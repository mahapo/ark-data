The purpose of this book is to revive the authoritative histori¬ cal, social and economic perspective needed to ensure compre¬ hensive legal reforms, abolish cannabis hemp/marijuana prohi¬ bition laws, and save the Earth’s life systems. I wrote my first book on marijuana, G.R.AS.S., in early 1973. At that time I had no idea this plant could do anything, except maybe make rope, let alone that it was earth’s most important resource for paper, fiber, fuel, etc. I first wrote the Emperor in 1985, after 12 years of recording hemp information. It was meant to be the culmination of a highly focused personal crusade with my long-time friend and associate, Captain Ed Adair, to win the right to smoke mari¬ juana for ourselves and our friends. It was Captain Ed who, since 1973, constantly encouraged me to record and compile the facts I obtained about marijuana and hemp. As I gathered a fact here and a fact there, a bigger picture of cannabis hemp and its suppression came together —one that I had not originally expected. What came together, fact after empirical fact was a picture of a world being destroyed by a malicious conspiracy to suppress, not a “killer-weed” but the world’s premier renewable natural resource, for the benefit of a handful of wealthy and powerful individuals and corporations. Over the years since the first publication of Emperor, thou¬ sands of more facts have surfaced, corroborating the informa¬ tion that was originally gathered, correcting some minor de¬ tails and adding substance, fact and insight to the hazier areas of my work. Esoteric details of conspiracy aginst mankind started to fall into place like the filling in of a giant jig-saw puz¬ zle. The entire text has been revised. Whole new sections and side bars have been added. This information has never been de¬ nied by the U.S. government and has been ignored by the me¬ dia. And more and more of my friends have been locked away in prison and/or had their homes, jobs and businesses taken from them as part of this escalating “War on Drugs” prohibition. This has become a draconian nightmare for many of our best citizens who, with trust in their own intellect and responsibili¬ ty for their own health, have defied this bad public policy and have become prisoners of conscience; prisoners of war. I hope after reading this book you will stand up with me and recog¬ nize them, not as outlaws, but as the heroes who saved the seed that will save the planet. New people have been drawn in to work on this project, giv¬ ing this project a scope and dimension I could only have hoped for at the beginning. They have brought with them skills and information that have been a major contribution to this effort. No egos surfaced as 4 or 5 of us stayed up night after night; only the best from each mind was brought forth. When you write a book like the original Emperor, because the information which should be common knowledge, is virtually unknown to our teachers and citizens, you always hope some¬ one of great energy and intellect will read it, make it their own and join in teaching others. Over the years, hundreds, perhaps thousands of people who have read The Emperor Wears No Clothes have thanked me for writing one of their favorite books. At a “Grateful Dead” show, one Yale graduate even thanked and hugged me as his favoite author of all time and was thrilled that I was still alive—he had first heard his mother read him The Emperor when he was a small boy (probably thinking of the 19th century children’s story, The Emperors New Clothes, by Hans Christain Anderson). One day in early 1989 Chris Conrad, of Los Angeles, CA, read The Emperor. He became my ally. With his endless energies, editing and publishing talents and willingness to work 40 hours per week for almost five months, all the while holding down full-time resonsibilities as production manager at a major weekly newspaper, as well as many other responsibilities for numerous organizations and causes. During all this time his girlfriend, Mikki Norris, lent her support in so many ways to this project. Chris did all this without any compensation, yet he worked like he was getting paid a million for it. Chris is one of the most powerful, energetic, skilled and organized human beings I have ever known. He is a light bulb for all mankind. He designed ev¬ ery inch of this book and was its main editor and enthusiast. Also, we want to extend endless thanks to the rest of our ded¬ icated entourage: Thanks to Chris’ and my associate editor and contributing writer, Lynn Osburn, who is both a great writer and mari¬ juana/hemp energy scientist. Lynn set out to see and learn if, indeed, hemp was one of earth’s primary renewable energy re¬ sources. He researched the technology needed to bring clean, renewable energy into use on the planet. His brilliant endeavor can be found throughout almost every page of this work. And an excerpt from his paper, Energy Farming In America, can be found in the appendix. Lynn’s work will teach people all over the world the beauty, neccesity and easiness of energy farming and conversion. While Lynn was researching this work he was arrested for a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"marijuana cultivation violation. He continued to work on this project day and night until Jan. 2,1990, when he was incarcer¬ ated in Ventura County, CA for a period of one year. He contin¬ ued to actively edit this book from behind bars. Tb another one of my great associate editors and contributing writers, Lynn’s wife, Judy Osbum. Judy has, out of necessity and outrage become a noted authority and author on seizure and forfeiture law. The neccesity arose from the government’s seizure and attempt to forfeit the home of the Osbum family, who worked out, with me, a scheme to save our children and planet. Judy’s book, Spectre of Forfeiture is state-of-the-art con¬ cerning this information and can be ordered through a coupon in the back of this book. *Ib Shan Clark, for his active participation: editing, catalogu¬ ing, inputting and for pushing this project and me forward when it or I might otherwise have stalled. 'Ib my assistant thoughout the last year and a half, Maria Farrow, who has accompanied me from the Libraiy of Congress to the Smithsonian Institution to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as we tracked down and interviewed dozens of government officials about hemp and hunted down hundreds of documents about hemp and the cover-up. Tb Dana Beal, for all his work and research brillance in con¬ necting the DuPont Dynasties by Jerry Colby with the informa¬ tion on the outlawing of hemp. 'Ib Jerry Colby for his brave ingenious work, which awakened us to the meglomania of the DuPonts. To Ben Masel, for his hard critiques and great assistance and research into the more esoteric abstracts on hemp cultivation world-wide and more.... To Julie Kershenbaum, for her excellent editorial assistance and proof-reading. To D.S.H., for his editorial assistance and meticulous concern for accuracy and readability. To Brenda Kershenbaum and Doug McVay, for proof-reading and editorial comment. To Steve Hager, John Holmstrom and their whole crew for their editorial assistance and total support, not only of this pro¬ ject but of their idea that the Earth could be saved and that each one of us can become a “Freedom Fighter” for this cause. To the Wiz Kids from KnoWare, Ron Lawrance and Vicki Marshal, who of their own volition, scanned into Mac comput¬ ers the old version of Emperor so when I came back from my fall, 1989 college hemp speaking tour, they handed me, as a surprise gift: the old book in word-processing form, which gave me the jump start I needed for this huge undertaking. To Timothy Leary, who encouraged them and me to do this job. To George Clayton Johnson, who for four years constantly brought me fresh edits of Emperor and loving encouragement to update and republish this book. Tb the selflessness of my landlords, Ed and Esther, who ex¬ tended me so much in deferred payments, so that this project which they believed in would not cease or bog down because of lack of money. Tb my friends, Doctors T>d Mikuriya and Fred Oerther, for their critique of the medical sections. T) Loey Glover, office manager at national NORML, for her constant support and warm encouragement. To Gatewood Galbraith and Mark Brennamen, of Lexington, Kentucky, for all their remarkable research on behalf of cannabis and their fight for Kentucky citizen’s birthrights and potential. To Barry for his extensive hemp archives which he made available to the hemp movement and ultimately, to this project. To my dear friends, Ron and Vicki Linker, of Starseed Collections of Athens, Ohio, who elequently taught state sena¬ tors and representatives and the people of Athens how ignorant (not knowing) they were about hemp and marijuana. Ron and Vicki are the truest of freedom fighters, who with Paul, Kevin and Cliff and the Ohio University Ecology Club have educated the citizens of Athens, as no other city in America. On November 19,1989, Ron Linker began serving a two year federal prison term for importing traditional Hindu smoking pipes, as he had for the past 15 years with the approval of Customs. The federal judge at sentencing said, after refusing any hemp information to be admitted at trial, “I only wish I could sentence you longer for all the lives you have destroyed with these [traditional Hindu! pipes.” Ron and Vicki know the hemp information and the injustice of his punishment. And to others who believed in this work and extended encour- agment, money and credit even when it hurt. They are: David and Gloria Smith, Marco, Allan and Regina, Jon and Carol, David and Debbie, Steve and Chuquette, Roger, Gary H., Rooster, Dudley, to Jim, Rose and Chris, Gail and Billy, the Friendly Stranger-Ed, Steve and Andrew DeAngelo, Rick Pfrommer, Peter A., Larry G., Floyd, Jean Michel Eribon, Ron Tisbert, Richard M., T.C., Mitchel from New Jersey, Beau and Rachael, Jonathan Drewel (who brought us all his incredible energy from Southern MO Univ.), and to everyone who has read or contributed to this work that I may have left out. Finally, I hope that this book helps everyone understand the true nature of cannabis hemp and that you, dear reader, decide to become active in the effort to end this crime against man and nature: marijuana prohibition. This book is meant to pro¬ vide you with the tools, the sense of outrage and the empower¬ ment needed to overcome the forces of personal repression. We have tried to be as factual and accurate as humanly possi¬ ble, but there will always be revisions and corrections needed. Please send me copies of any documents and materials that will make the next edition of Emperor even stronger. We have already won the day; only no one knows it yet. And once again to my 1992 readers and partners in discov¬ ery: thanks for all the documents, clippings and tips you, all our cannabis fans, have sent to us over the past year; keep sending us all the bits and tidbits that help us put the puzzle together for future editions. T) my four associate editors, Chris Conrad, Lynn and Judy Osbum, and Shan Clark for again be¬ ing the most outstanding editors, patriots and hempsters one could ever wish to work with to illuminate the human race with knowledge, integrity and perseverance. ( / Jack Herer \\National Director and Founder Help End Marijuana Prohibition. (HEMP)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PROLOGUE Marijuana has been known to humankind for untold thousands of years. Government has attempted to prohibit its use for the past 50. As with all previous attempts at prohibition, the attempt has been a dismal failure, peo¬ ple are simply not deterred from marijuana usage because of its illegality. Yet the prohibi¬ tion continues and vast amounts of time, energy, and money are spent in the effort. In Josephine County, Oregon, 20% of the felony cases processed through the Circuit Court involved marijuana; 75% of those cases involved marijuana possessed or grown for personal consumption. This reflects national trends, i.e., 600,000 arrested in 1984 alone. We must ask at this point, if it is worth the effort. Only in the light of knowledge, are we able to answer such questions. This enlightening book dfttnila the history of marijuana, the history of its prohibition, and the present state of the pharmacological facts about the herb. In the ffllm light of understanding, we realize that the effort to prohibit marijuana—bom in hysteria and racism, continued in self-righteousness and repression—has no substantial basis whatsoever: no fact, whether political, economic, medical, moral, or correctional, can justify the effort. This book is well-documented, often startling, and sometimes outrageous, but never less than fascinating, and above all, a thoroughly enjoyable, not to mention educational experi¬ ence. —Michael E. Rose Attorney at Law May 2,1985 ;"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"— PREFACE — By George Clayton Johnson Author of eight Twilight Zone episodes, Twilight Zone (The Movie), Logan’s Run (book and movie), Star Trek, Oceans Eleven, Rung Fu, etc. February 22,1990 Jack Herer has done it. With incredible precision, backed by voluminous research, he has placed his finger on the point where all of the trends that threaten to overwhelm the world come to¬ gether. And at the core of these complexities, he has found HEMP. The premise of Jack Herer’s book, The Emperor Wears No Clothes, is fanciful in the extreme: That the diverse properties of the scorned and condemned marijuana plant could provide sufficient clothing, oil, medicine, fuel, food, and shelter for all the peoples of the world, if completely legalized and commercialized; and that hemp might prove to be the means of saving the planet (us) from acid rain, global warm¬ ing and the depletion of our precious forests and fossil fuels. Further—that the dangers of marijuana smoking pale before the many advan¬ tages that are potential in the free commerce in hemp and its byproducts. Now that Jack has pointed out these facts to a changing world searching for truth—the people, of course, will quickly set things right by renouncing the 1961 Single Convention Treaty on drugs and marijuana, and tooling up to produce a wealth of quality, ecologically sound goods for an upwardly mobile society. As a science fiction writer, this view of an altered world of clean skies and lush forests, filled with freedom-loving people living in hemp houses, driving their hemp- fueled cars down hemp-lined freeways, dressed in their hemp finery, eating their hemp tofu salad is very appealing to me. Jack makes a very good case for it being possible. And in my reading his informa¬ tive book I find that I am charmed."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"— EDITOR’S NOTE — 7b the 1991 Edition of Emperor In 1989, when I first read Jack Herer’s 1985 version of Emperor, I knew I had uncov¬ ered a diamond in the rough, and resolved to polish it up. Since then, I’ve been honored to work with a dedicated core of talented people to bring out the many faceted gem within. We refined, expanded and consolidated the text, and organized the information into four major sections: the text, the bibliography/index, a smorgasbord of documents in the ap¬ pendix, and numerous order forms and resources in the back. The release of the 1990 edition of Emperor sent shock waves across the nation and has changed forever the way people think—and talk—about the cannabis hemp plant. It has been gratifying to see the incredible information that has been uncovered in the past year, as well as the development of my editorial associates, Lynn and Judy Osbum and Shan Clark, whose research and support have made this 1991 revision possible. So much has changed over the past year that what began as a modest update became almost a total rewrite of the book. Many people who own previous editions of Emperor will want to give away their old copy to get this new, even more powerful resource. This year’s edition has fewer illustrations, so as to make room for new material and still keep the information as accessible and readable as possible. Using the appendix may seem difficult at first. There was so much to include that we have had to shrink some of the documents down to where you need a magnifying glass or enlarged copies to read them. We tried this ourselves, and it worked quite well. We regret the poor quality of some documents we included, but these copies are the best we could lo¬ cate, and many have been virtually lost elsewhere. Almost daily updates have been incor¬ porated into the text to make it as current as possible. The amount of new information on hemp that is being developed borders on overwhelm¬ ing; but if you have any documented tidbits for future editions of Emperor, or better copies of documents found in the appendix, please share them with us. So, let me again thank everyone who helped compile and authenticate this information (you know who you are). May there never be the need for such a task again. And thank you for taking the time to read this important book. We hope this startling information gets you active in changing this gross injustice, hemp prohibition. Tbgether we shall carry the day. Sincerely, Chris Conrad, Founder and Director, Business Alliance for Commerce in Hemp April 10,1991 — EDITORS’ NOTE — To the 1992 Edition of Emperor It’s May 1992 and the April 1991 edition of the Emperor has completely sold out. Not long after the 1991 edition of Emperor was printed we uncovered and analyzed new in¬ formation about hempseed nutrition. We have completely rewritten most of Chapter 8: Hemp Seed as the Basic World Food to include this break-through hemp and health discovery. Also Chapter 9: Money, Energy and Environment has been extensively re¬ vised and updated. Every Chapter of Emperor has been updated for this 1992 edition. Chapters 15 and 16 were slightly rearranged, making room for additional information. We have gone through the text and reference bibliography and corrected typos and other production orrors, many of which were caught by readers who took the time to jot them down and send them to us. Many thanks to you. It is people from all over America (and the world) that have discovered classic hemp industry and medical papers in their local libraries and university archives and freely shared that information with us — they are the unsung heroes of the hemp move¬ ment. They are the ones that refuse to let prohibitions of government and big busi¬ ness bury the historic evidence for the many uses of hemp and its intimate and ageless relationship with humanity. It is in their honor that we proudly present this hemp knowledge in the Emperor Wears No Clothes — knowledge accumulated by so many dedicated — destined to be shared with so many more.

More mandatory (must-grow) hemp cultivation laws were enacted in Massachusetts in 1631, in Connecticut in 1632 and in the Chesapeake Colonies into the mid- 1700s. Even in England, the much-sought-after prize of full British citizenship was bestowed by a decree of the crown on foreigners who would grow cannabis, and fines were often levied against those who refused. Cannabis hemp was legal tender (money) in most of the Americas from 1631 until the early 1800s. Why? To encourage Amer¬ ican farmers to grow more. 1 You could pay your taxes with cannabis hemp throughout America for over 200 years. 2 You could even be jailed in America for not grow¬ ing cannabis during several periods of shortage, e.g., in Virginia between 1763 and 1767. WHAT’S IN A NAME? (U.S. Geography) HEMPstead, Long Island; HEMPstead County, Arkansas; HEMPstead, Texas; HEMPhill, North Carolina, HEMPfield, Pennsylvania, among others, were named after cannabis growing regions, or after family names derived from hemp growing. (Herndon, G.M., Hemp in Colonial Virginia, 1963; The Chesa¬ peake Colonies, 1954; LA. Times, August 12,1981; et al.) George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew cannabis on their plantations. Jefferson, 3 while envoy to Prance, went to great expense—and even consider¬ able risk to himself and his secret agents—to procure particularly good hemp seeds smuggled illegally into Turkey from China. The Chinese Mandarins (politi¬ cal rulers) so valued their hemp seeds that they made their exportation a capital offense. Benjamin Franklin started one of America*s first paper mills with cannabis. This allowed America to have a free colonial press without having to beg or justify paper and books from England. The United States Census of 1850 count¬ ed 8,327* hemp “plantations” (minimum 2,000 acre farms) growing cannabis hemp for doth, canvas and even the cordage used for bal¬ ing cotton. Most of these plantations were located in the South or in the border states, primarily because"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"of the cheap slave-labor available prior to 1865 for the labor-intensive hemp industry.

Benjamin Franklin started one of America’s first paper mills with cannabis. This allowed America to have a free colonial press without having to beg or justify paper and books from England. In addition, varying marijuana and hashish ex¬ tracts were the second or third most prescribed medicines in the United States from 1842 until the 1890s. Its legal medicinal use continued through the 1930s for humans and figured even more prominent¬ ly in veterinary medicines during this time. Cannabis extract medicines were produced by Eli Lilly, Parke-Davis, Tildens, Brothers Smith (Smith Brothers), Squibb and many other American and European companies and apothecaries. During all this time there was not one reported death from cannabis extract medicines, and virtually no abuse or mental disorders reported, except for first-time or novice-users occasionally becoming disoriented or overly introverted.

WORLD HISTORICAL NOTES “The earliest known woven fabric was apparently of hemp, which began to be worked in the eighth mil¬ lennium (8,000-7,000 B.C.).” (The Columbia History of the World, 1981, page 54.) The body of literature (archaeologists, anthropolo¬ gists, philologists, economists, historians, etc.) is in general agreement that, at the very least: From more than 1,000 years before the time of Christ until 1883 A.D., cannabis hemp—indeed, mar¬ ijuana—was our planet’s largest agricultural crop and most important industry for thousands of prod¬ ucts and enterprises; producing the overall majority of earth’s fiber, fabric, lighting oil, paper, incense and medicines, as well as a primary source of essential food oil and protein for humans and animals. And according to virtually every anthropologist and university in the world, marijuana was also used in most of our religions and cults as one of the seven, or so, most widely used mood-, mind- or pain-altering drugs taken as psychotropic, psychedelic (mind-man¬ ifesting or -expanding) sacraments. These sacred (drug) experiences inspired our super¬ stitions, amulets, talismans, religions, prayers, and language codes, almost without exception. (See chap¬ ter 10 on “Religions and Magic.”) (Wasson, R.

GREAT WARS WERE FOUGHT TO INSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF HEMP. For example, one of the primary reasons for the War of 1812 (that America fought with Great Britain) was access to Russian cannabis hemp. Russian hemp was also the principal reason that Napoleon (our 1812 ally) and his “Continental Systems” allies in¬ vaded Russia in 1812. (See chapter 12, “War of 1812 and Napoleon Invades Russia”) In 1942, after the Japanese invasion of the Philip¬ pines cut off the supply of Manila (Abaca) hemp, the U.S. government distributed 400,000 pounds of can¬ nabis seeds to American farmers from Wisconsin to Kentucky, who produced 42,000 tons of hemp fiber annually for the war effort until 1946. WHY HAS CANNABIS HEMP/MARIJUANA BEEN SO IMPORTANT IN HISTORY? Because cannabis hemp is, overall, the strongest, most-durable, longest-lasting natural soft-fiber on the planet. Its leaves and flower tops (marijuana) were—depending on the culture—the first, second or third most important and most-used medicines for two-thirds of the world’s people for at least 3,000 years, until the turn of this century. Botanically, hemp is a member of the most ad¬ vanced plant family on Earth. It is a dioecious (i.e., having male, female and sometimes hermaphroditic [male and female on same plant]) woody, herbaceous annual that uses the sun more efficiently than virtu¬ ally any other plant on our planet, reaching a robust 12 to 20 feet or more in one short growing season. It can be grown in virtually any climate or soil condi¬ tion on Earth, even marginal ones. Hemp is, by far, Earth’s premier, renewable natural resource. This is why hemp is so important.

M arijuana! 1. SHIPS AND SAILORS Ninety percent* of all ships’ sails (since before the Phoenicians, from at least the Fifth Century B.C. un¬ til long after the invention and commercialization of steam ships [mid- to late-19th centuryl) were made from hemp. (See picture.) * The other 10% were usually flax or minor fibers like ramie, sisal, jute, abaca. (Abel, Ernest, Marijuana: The First 12,000 Years, Plenum Press, 1980; Herodotus, Histories, 5th century B.C.; Frazier, Jack, The Marijuana Farmers, 1972; U.S. Agricultural Index, 1916-1982; USDA film, Hemp for Victory, 1942.) The word “canvas” 1 is the Dutch pronunciation (twice removed, from French and Latin) of the Greek word “Kannabis.”* * Kannabis—of the (Hellenized) Mediterranean Basin Greek lan¬ guage, derived from the Persian and earlier Northern Semitics (Quanuba, Kanabosm, Cana?, Kanah?) which scholars have now traced back to the new-found dawn of the 6,000-year-old, Indo- Semitic-European language family base of the Sumerians and Accadians. The early Sumerian/Babylonian word K(a)N(a)B(a), or Q(a)N(a)B(a) is one of man’s longest surviving root words. 1 (KN means cane and B means two-two reeds or two sexes.) In addition to the canvas sails, virtually all of the rigging, anchor ropes, cargo nets, fishermen’s nets, flags, shrouds, and oakum (the main sealant for ships against salt water for use between loose or green beams) were made from the stalk of the mari¬ juana plant until this century. Even the sailors’ clothing, right down to the stitch¬ ing in the seamen’s rope-soled and (sometimes) “can¬ vas” shoes were crafted from cannabis.* * An average cargo, clipper, whaler, or naval ship of the line, in the 16th, 17th, 18th, or 19th centuries carried 50 to 100 tons of cannabis hemp rigging, not to mention the sails, nets, etc., and needed it all replaced every year or two, due to salt rot. (Ask the U.S. Naval Academy, or see the construction of the USS Constitution, a.k.a. “Old Ironsides,” Boston Harbor.) (Abel, Ernest, Marijuana, The First 12,000 Years, Plenum Press, 1980; Ency. Brittanica; Magoun, Alexander, The Frigate Constitution, 1928; USDA film Hemp for Victory, 1942.) Additionally, the ships’ charts, maps, logs, and Bibles were made from paper containing hemp fiber from the time of Columbus (15th century) until the early 1900s in the Western European/American World, and by the Chinese from the first century A.D. on. Hemp paper lasted 50 to 100 times longer than most preparations of papyrus, and was a hun¬ dred times easier and cheaper to make. Nor was hemp use restricted to the briny deep. 2. TEXTILES AND FABRICS Eighty percent of all mankind’s textiles and fabrics for clothes, tents, linens,* rugs, drapes, quilts, bed sheets, towels, diapers, etc., including our flag, “Old Glory,” were made principally from cannabis fibers until the 1820s in America and until the 20th centu¬ ry in most of the rest of the world. For hundreds, if not thousands of years (until the 1830s) Ireland made the finest linens and Italy made the world’s finest cloth for clothing with hemp. * The 1893, 1910 Encyclopaedia Britannicas indicate—and in 1938, Popular Mechanics estimated—that at least half of all the ma¬ terial that has been called linen was not made from flax, but from cannabis. Herodotus (c. 450 B.C.) describes the hempen garments made by the Thracians as equal to linen in fineness and that “none but a very experienced person could tell whether they were of hemp or flax.” 5"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The fact that hemp is softer than cotton, warmer than cotton, more water absorbent than cotton, has three times the tensile strength of cotton and is many times more durable than cotton was well known to our forebearers. Homespun cloth was almost always spun from the family hemp patch into the early 1900s. In fact, when the patriotic, real life, 1776 mothers of our present day blue-blood “Daughters of the American Revolution” (the D.A.R.) of Boston and New Eng¬ land organized “spinning bees” to clothe Washington’s soldiers, the majority of the thread was spun from hemp fibers. Were it not for the historically forgotten (or cen¬ sored) and currently disparaged marijuana plant, the Continental Army would have frozen to death at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The common use of hemp in the economy of the ear¬ ly republic was important enough to occupy the time and thoughts of our first U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, who wrote in a Treasury notice from the 1790s, “Flax and Hemp: Manufacturers of these articles have so much affinity to each other, and they are so often blended, that they may with advantage be considered in conjunction. Sailcloth should have 10% duty.” fiber quality. If a farmer wanted soft linen-quality fibers he would plant his cannabis close together. As a rule of thumb, if you plant for medical or recreational use, you plant one seed per five square yards. When planted for seed: four to five feet apart. (Univ. of KY Ag. Ext. leaflet, March 1943.) Two hundred seeds to the square yard are planted for rough cordage or coarse cloth. Finest linen or lace is grown up to 900 plants to the square yard and harvested be¬ tween 80 to 100 days. (Farm Crop Reports, USDA international bstracts. CIBA Review 1961-62 Luigi astellini, Milan Italy.) Were it not for the marijuana plant, the Continental Army would have frozen to death at Valley Forge . By the late 1820s, the new Am¬ erican hand cotton gins (invented by Eli Whitney in 1793) were largely replaced by European-made “industrial” looms and cotton gins (“gin” is just short for engine), because of Europe’s primary equipment-machinery-technology (tool and die making) lead over America. For the first time, light cotton clothing could be pro¬ duced at less cost than hand retting (rotting) and hand separating hemp fibers to be handspun on spinning wheels and jennys. 4 (Herndon, G.M., Hemp in Colonial Virginia, 1963; DA.R. histo¬ ries; Able, E, Marijuana, the First 12,000 Years; also see the 1985 film Revolution with A1 Pacino.) The covered wagons went west (to Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Oregon, and California*) covered with sturdy hemp canvas tarpaulins, 2 while ships sailed around the “Horn” to San Francisco on hemp sails and ropes. * The original, heavy-duty, famous Levi pants were made for the California ’49ers out of hempen sailcloth and rivets. This way the pockets wouldn't rip when filled with gold panned from the sediment. 1 Homespun cloth was almost always spun from the “family” hemp patch until after the Civil War, and into the early 1900s, by Americans and people all over the world.* However, because of its strength, softness, warmth and long-lasting qualities, hemp continued to be the second most used natural fiber* * until the 1930s. * In case you’re wondering, there is no THC or “high\" in hemp fiber. That’s right, you can't smoke your shirt! In fact, attemptin g to smoke hemp fabric—or any fabric, for that matter—could be fatal! After the 1937 Marijuana Tax law new DuPont “plastic fibers” under license of 1936 German I.G. Corporation patents (with patent surrenders as part of Germany’s reparation payments to America from World War I) replaced natural hempen fibers. (Some 30% of Hitler’s I.G. Corps, e.g., Farben, were owned and financed by America’s DuPont.) Dupont also in¬ troduced Nylon (invented in 1935) to the market when they patented it in 1938. * In the 1930s, Congress was told by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics that many Polish-Americans still grew pot in their back¬ yards to make their winter “long johns” and work clothes, and greet¬ ed the agents with shotguns for stealing their next year’s clothes. The age and density of the hemp patch influences (Colby, Jerry, DuPont Dynasties, Lyle Stewart, 1984.) Finally, it must be noted that approximately 50% of all chemicals used in American agriculture today are used in cotton growing.

F IBER & PULP PAPER From 75-90% of all paper in the world was made with cannabis hemp fiber until 1883: books, Bibles, maps, paper money, stocks and bonds, newspapers, etc., including the Gutenberg Bible (15th century); Pantagruel and the Herb Pantagruelion, Rabelais (16th century); King James Bible (17th century); Thomas Paine’s pamphlets, “The Rights of Man,” “Common Sense,” “The Age of Reason” (18th centu¬ ry); the works of Fitz Hugh Ludlow, Mark Twain, Victor Hugo, Alexander Dumas, Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland (19th century); and just about every¬ thing else was printed on hemp paper. The first draft of the Declaration of Independence (June 28, 1776) was written on Dutch [hempl paper, as was the second draft completed on July 2, 1776. This was the document actually agreed to on that day and announced and released on July 4, 1776. ...On July 19, 1776, Congress ordered the Declar¬ ation be copied and engrossed on parchment (a pre¬ pared animal skin) and this was the document actu¬ ally signed by the delegates on August 2,1776. What we (the colonial Americans) and the rest of the world used to make all our paper from was the discarded sails and ropes sold by ship owners as scrap for recycling into paper. Hemp paper lasted 50 to 100 times longer than most preparations of papyrus, and was a hun¬ dred times easier and cheaper to make. The other reason that Oriental knowledge and sci¬ ence sustained superiority to that of the West for 1,400 years was that the Roman Catholic Church for¬ bade reading and writing for 95% of Europe’s people; in addition, they burned, hunted down, or prohibited all foreign or domestic books—including their own Bible!—for over 1,200 years under the penalty and often-used punishment of death. Hence, historians term this period “The Dark Ages.” (See chapter 10 on Sociology.) 4. R OPE, TWINE, AND CORDAGE Virtually every city and town (from time out of mind) in the world had an industry making hemp rope. 6 Russia, however, was the world’s largest pro¬ ducer and best-quality manufacturer, supplying 80% of the Western world’s hemp from 1740 until 1940. Thomas Paine outlined four essential natural re¬ sources for the the new nation in Common Sense (1776): “cordage, iron, timber and tar.” The rest of our paper came from our worn-out clothes, sheets, diapers, curtains and rags* sold to scrap dealers made primarily from hemp and some¬ times flax. * Hence the term “rag paper.” Chief among these was hemp for cordage. He wrote, “Hemp flourishes even to rankness, we do not want for cordage.” Then he went on to list the other essen¬ tials necessary for war with the British navy: can¬ nons, gunpowder, etc. Rag paper, containing hemp fiber, is the highest quality and longest lasting paper ever made. It can be torn when wet but returns to its full strength when diy. Rag paper is stable for centuries, barring extreme conditions. It will almost never wear out. Our ancestors were too thrifty to just throw any¬ thing away, so, until the 1880s, any remaining scraps and clothes were mixed together and recycled into paper. Many U.S. government papers were written, by law, on hempen “rag paper” until the 1920s. B It is generally believed by scholars that the early Chinese knowledge, or art, of hemp paper making (First Century A.D.—800 years before Islam discov¬ ered how, and 1,200 to 1,400 years before Europe) was one of the two chief reasons that Oriental knowl¬ edge and science were vastly superior to that of the West for 1,400 years. Thus, the art of long-lasting hemp papermaking allowed the Orientals’ accumu- From 70-90% of all rope, twine, and cordage was made from hemp until 1937. It was then replaced mostly by petrochemical fibers (owned principally by DuPont under license from Germany’s I.G.

P AINTS AND VARNISHES For thousands of years, virtually all good paints and varnishes were made with hemp seed oil and/or lin¬ seed oil. For instance, in 1935 alone, 116 million pounds (58,000 tons*) of hemp seed were used in America just for paint and varnish. The hemp drying oil business went principally to DuPont petro-chemicals. 8 •National Institute of Oilseed Products congressional testimony against the 1937 Marijuana Transfer Tax Law.

Oliphant was solely re¬ sponsible for drafting the Marijuana Tax Act that was submitted to Con¬ gress. 9 (See complete story in chapter 4, “The Last Days of Legal Cannabis.”) * As a comparison, consider that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), along with all America’s state and local police agencies, claim to have seized for all of 1988, 651,5 tons of American-grown mari¬ juana—seed, plant, root, dirt clump and all. (National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee, NNICC Report, 1988 DEA office release, El Paso, TX, April, 1989.) 7. L IGHTING OIL Until about 1800, hemp seed oil was the most con¬ sumed lighting oil in America and the world. From then until the 1870s, it was the second most con¬ sumed lighting oil, exceeded \"only by whale oil. Hemp seed oil lit the lamps of the legendary Aladdin, Abraham the prophet and in real life, Abraham Lincoln. It was the brightest lamp oil. WHEN HEMP SAVED GEORGE BUSH S LIFE One more example of the importance of hemp: Five years after cannabis hemp was outlawed in 1937, it was promptly re-introduced for the World War II effort in 1942. So, when the young pilot George Bush bailed out of his burning airplane after a battle over the Pacific, little did he know: • Parts of his aircraft engine were lubricated with cannabis hemp seed oil; • 100% of his life-saving parachute webbing was made from U.S. grown cannabis hemp; • Virtually all the rigging and ropes of the ship that pulled him in were made of cannabis hemp; • The firehoses on the ship (as were those in the schools he had attended) were woven from cannabis hemp; and, • Finally, as young George Bush stood safely on the deck, his shoes’ durable stitching was of cannabis hemp, as it is in all good leather and mil¬ itary shoes to this day. Yet Bush has spent a good deal of his career eradicating the cannabis plant and enforcing laws to make certain that no one will learn this infor¬ mation—possibly including himself.... (USDA film, Hemp for Victory, 1942; U. of KY Agricultural Ext. Service Leaflet 25, March, 1943; Qalbraith, Gatewood, Kentucky Marijuana Feasibility Study, 1977.) Hemp seed oil for lamps was replaced by petroleum, kerosene, etc., after the 1859 Pennsylvania oil dis¬ covery and “Rockefeller’s” 1870-on national petroleum stewardship. (See chapter 9 on “Economics.”) In fact, the celebrated botanist Luther Burbank stated, “The seed of [cannabis] is prized in other coun¬ tries for its oil, and its neglect here illustrates the same wasteful use of our agricultural resources.” (Burbank, Luther, How Plants Are Trained 2b Work For Man, Useful Plants, P. F. Collier & Son Co., NY, Vol. 6, pg. 48.) 8. B IOMASS ENERGY In the early 1900s, Henry Ford and other futuristic, organic, engineering geniuses, (as their intellectual, scientific heirs still do today) recognized an important point—that up to 90% of all fossil fuel used in the world today (coal, oil, natu¬ ral gas, etc.— should long ago have been replaced with biomass such as? corn¬ stalks, cannabis, waste pa¬ per and the like. When considered on a planet-wide, soil-wide, climate-wide basis, cannabis is at least four times and, more likely, 50 times richer in renewable biomass/ cellulose potential than its nearest rivals on the planet — cornstalks, trees, surgarcane, kenaf, etc. Biomass can be converted to methane, methanol or gasoline at a fraction of the current cost of oil, coal, or nuclear energy—especially when environmental costs are factored in—and its mandated use would end acid rain, end sulfur-based smog and reverse the green house effect on our planet—right now!* • Government and oil and coal companies, etc., will insist that burning biomass fuel is no better than using up our fossil fuel re¬ serves, as far as pollution goes; but this is patently untrue. _ Why? Because, unlike fossil fuel, biomass comes from living (not ex¬ tinct) plants that continue to remove carbon dioxide pollution from our atmosphere as they grow, through photosynthesis. Furthermore, — 8 —"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"biomass fuels do not contain sulfur. This can be accomplished if hemp is grown for biomass and then converted through pyrolysis (char- coalizing) or biochemical composting into fiiels to re¬ place fossil fuel energy products.* * Remarkably, when considered on a planet-wide, climate-wide, soil¬ wide basis, cannabis is at least four and could be many more times richer in sustainable, renewable biomass/cellulose potential than its nearest rivals on the planet—cornstalks, surgarcane, kenaf, trees, etc. (Solar Gas, .1980; Omni, 1983: Cornell University; Science Digest, 1983: etc.). Also see chapter 9 on Economics. One product of pyrolysis, methanol, is today used by most race cars and was used by American farmers and auto drivers routinely with petroleum/methanol options starting in the 1920s, through the 1930s, and even into the mid-1940s to run tens of thousands of auto, farm and military vehicles until the end of World War H. Methanol can even be converted to a high octane lead-free gasoline using a cat¬ alytic process patented by Mobil Oil Corporation. 9. MEDICINE From 1842 and through the 1890s, extremely strong mari¬ juana (then known as cannabis extractums) and hashish extracts, tinctures and elixirs were routinely the sec¬ ond and third most-used medi¬ cine in America for humans (from birth, through childhood, to old age) and in veterinary medicine until the 1920s and longer. (See chapter 6 on “Medicine,” and chapter 13 on the “19th Centuiy.”) As stated earlier, for at least 3,000 years, prior to 1842, widely varying marijuana extracts (buds, leaves, roots, etc.) were the most commonly used real medicine in the world for the majority of mankind’s illnesses. However, in Western Europe, the Roman Catholic Church forbade use of cannabis or any medical treat¬ ment, except for alcohol or blood letting, for 1200-plus years. (See chapter 10 on “Sociology.”) The U.S. Pharmacopoeia indicated cannabis should be used for treating such ailments as: fatigue, fits of coughing, rheumatism, asthma, delirium tremens, migraine headaches and the cramps and depressions associated with menstruation. (Professor William Emboden, Professor of Narcotic Botany, California State University, Northridge.) Queen Victoria used cannabis resins for her men¬ strual cramps and PMS, and her reign (1837-1901) paralleled the enormous growth of the use of Indian cannabis medicine in the English-speaking world. In this century, cannabis research has demonstrat¬ ed therapeutic value—and complete safety—in the treatment of many health problems including asthma, glaucoma, nausea, tumors, epilepsy, infection, stress, migraines, anorexia, depression, rheumatism, arthri¬ tis and possibly herpes. (See chapter 7, “Therapeutic Uses of Cannabis”) 10. FOOD OILS AND PROTEIN Hemp seed was regularly used in porridge, soups, and gruels by virtually all the people of the world up until this century. Monks were required to eat hemp seed dishes three times a day, to weave their clothes of it and to print their Bibles on paper made with its fiber. (See Rubin, Dr. Vera, “Research Institute for the Study Of Man;\" Eastern Orthodox Church; Cohen & Stillman, Therapeutic Potential of Marijuana, Plenum Press, 1976; Abel, Ernest, Mari¬ juana, The First 12,000 Years, Plenum Press, NY, 1980; Encyclopaedia Britt anica.) Hemp seed can be pressed for its highly nutritious vegetable oil, which contains the highest amount of essential fatty acids in the plant kingdom. These essential oils are responsible for our immune responses and clear the arteries of cholesterol and plaque. The byproduct of pressing the oil from the seed is the highest quality protein seed cake. It can be sprouted (malted) or ground and baked into cakes, breads and casseroles. Marijuana seed pro¬ tein is one of mankind’s finest, most complete and available-to-the-body vegetable proteins. Hemp seed is the most complete single food source for human nu¬ trition. (See discussion of edistins and essential fatty acids, Chapter 8.) Hemp seed was—until the 1937 prohibition law—the world’s number-one bird seed, for both wild and domestic birds. It was their favorite* of any seed food on the planet; four million pounds of hemp seed for songbirds were sold at retail in the U.S. in 1937. Birds will pick hemp seeds out and eat them first from a pile of mixed seed. Birds in the wild five longer and breed more with hemp seed in their diet, using the oil for their feathers and their overall health. (More in chapter 8 “Hemp as a Basic World Food.”) CANNABIS, U. S.

B UILDING MATERIALS AND HOUSING Because one acre of hemp produces as much cellu¬ lose fiber pulp as 4.1 acres of trees,* hemp is the per¬ fect material to replace trees for pressed board, parti¬ cle board and for concrete construction molds. * Dewey & Merrill, Bulletin M04, U.S. Dept, of Ag., 1916. Practical, inexpensive fire resistant construction material, with excellent thermal and sound insulating qualities, is made by heating and compressing plant fibers to create strong construction paneling, replac¬ ing dry wall and plywood. Conde Redwood Lumber near Eugene, OR uses hemp in this process. Mansion Industries uses wheat straw (See p. 172.) Hemp has been used throughout history for carpet backing. Hemp fiber has potential in the manufacture of strong, rot resistant carpeting—eliminating the poisonous fumes of burning synthetic materials in a house or commercial fire, along with allergic reactions associated with new synthetic carpeting. Plastic plumbing pipe (PVC pipes) can be manufac¬ tured using renewable hemp cellulose as the chemical feedstocks, replacing non-renewable petroleum-based chemical feedstocks. 12. S MOKING, LEISURE & CREATIVITY The American Declaration of Independence recog¬ nizes the “inalienable rights” of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Subsequent court decisions have inferred the rights to. privacy and choice from this, the U.S. Constitution and its Amendments. Many artists and writers have used cannabis for creative stimulation—from the writers of the world’s religious masterpieces to our most irreverent satirists. These include Lewis Carroll and his hookah smoking caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland , plus Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas; such jazz greats as Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington and Gene Krupa; and the pattern continues right up to modern day artists and musicians such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Eagles, the Doobie Brothers, Jefferson Airplane, Willie Nelson, Buddy Rich, Country Joe & the Fish, Joe Walsh, David Carradine, Ryan O’Neal, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Lola Falana, Neil Diamond, Hunter Thompson, Linda Blair, Peter Tosh and the Grateful Dead. Of course, smoking marijuana only enhances cre¬ ativity for some and not for others. But throughput history, various prohibition and “temperance” groups have attempted and occasionally succeeded in banning the preferred relaxational sub¬ stances of others, like alcohol, tobacco or cannabis. Abraham Lincoln responded to this kind of repres¬ sive mentality in December, 1840, when he said: “Prohibition...goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man’s appetite by legisla¬ tion and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes.... A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded.” 13. E CONOMIC STABILITY, PROFIT & FREE TRADE We believe that in a competitive market with all facts known, people will rush to buy long-lasting, biodegradable Pot Tbps or Mary Jeans. It’s time we put capitalism to the test and let the un¬ restricted market of supply and demand as well as “Green” ecological consciousness decide the future of the planet. A cotton shirt in 1776 cost $100 to $200, while a hemp shirt cost $.50 to $1. By the 1830s, cooler, lighter cotton shirts were on par in price with the warmer, heavier, hempen shirts, providing a competi¬ tive choice.

Tbday we have no such choice. The role of hemp and other natural fibers should be determined by the market of supply and demand and personal tastes and values, not by the undue influ¬ ence of prohibition laws, federal subsidies and huge tariffs that keep the natural fabrics from replacing synthetic fibers. Fifty years of government oppression has resulted in virtually no public knowledge of the incredible poten¬ tial of the hemp fiber or its uses. When legal, by using 100% hemp or mixing 20-50% hemp with 50-80% cotton, you will be able to pass on your shirts, pants and other clothing to your grand¬ children. Intelligent spending could essentially re¬ place the use of petrochemical synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester with tougher, cheaper, cool, ab¬ sorbent, breathing, biodegradable, natural fibers. China, Italy and Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia and Georgia currently make milli ons of dollars worth of sturdy hemp and hemp/cotton textiles—and could be making billions of dollars—annually. These countries build upon their traditional farming and weaving skills, while the U.S. tries to force the extinction of this plant to prop up destructive synthet¬ ic technologies. Even cannabis/cotton blend textiles are still not cleared for direct sale in the U.S. to this day. The Chinese, for instance, are forced—by tacit agree¬ ment—to send us inferior ramie/cottons. (National Import/Export Textile Company of Shanghai, Personal communication with author, April and May, 1983.) As the 1990 edition of Emperor went to press, gar¬ ments containing at least 55% cannabis hemp arrived from China—with a huge import fee attached. It had to be first imported into Hong Kong and then re-ex¬ ported to the U.S.—with quotas and a huge protective tariff to shield American synthetic fiber industries from competing with imported natural fibers such as hemp. In 1992 as we go to press, many different grades of 100% hemp fabric have arrived directly from China. Additionally, hemp grown for biomass could fuel a trillion dollar per year energy industry, while improv¬ ing air quality and distributing the wealth to rural ar¬ eas and their surrounding communities, and away from centralized power monopolies. Hemp holds the promise of a sustainable ecology and economy. IN CONCLUSION, We must reiterate our original premise with our challenge to the world to prove us wrong: I.Top of male plant in flower 2.

In early 1989, Jack Herer and Maria Farrow put this question to Steve Rawlings, the highest ranking officer in the U.S. Department of Agriculture who was in charge of reversing the Greenhouse Effect, at the USDA world re¬ search facility in Beltsville, MD. First, we introduced ourselves and told him we were writing for Green political party newspapers. Then we asked Rawlings, “If you could have any choice, what would be the ideal way to stop or reverse the Greenhouse Effect?” He said, “Stop cutting down trees and stop using fossil fuels” “Well, why don’t we?” “There’s no viable substitute for wood for paper, or for fossil fuels.” “Why don’t we use an annual plant for paper and for biomass to make fuel?” “Well, that would be ideal,” he agreed. “Unfortunately there is nothing you can use that could produce enough materials.” “Well, what would you say if there was such a plant that could substitute for all wood pulp paper, all fossil fuels, would make most of our fibers naturally, make everything from dynamite to plastic, grows in all 50 states and that one acre of it would replace 4.1 acres of trees, and that if you used about 6% of the U.S. land to raise it as an ener¬ gy crop—even on our marginal lands, this plant would produce all 75 quadrillion billion BTUs needed to run America each year? Would that help save the planet?” “That would be ideal. But there is no such plant.” “We think there is.” “Yeah? What is it?” “Hemp.” “Hemp!” he mused for a moment. “I never would have thought of it.... You know, I think you’re right. Hemp could be the plant that could do it. Wow! That’s a great idea!” We were excited as we outlined this information and de¬ lineated' the potential of hemp for paper, fiber, fuel, food, paint, etc., and how it could be applied to balance the world’s ecosystems and restore the atmosphere’s oxygen balance with almost no disruption of the standard of liv¬ ing to which most Americans have become accustomed. In essence, Rawlings agreed that our information was probably correct and could very well work. He said, “It’s a wonderful idea, and I think it might work. But, of course, you can’t use it.” “You‘re kidding?” We responded. “Why not?” “Well, Mr. Herer, did you know that hemp is also mari¬ juana?” “Yes, of course I know, I’ve been writing about it for about 40 hours a week for the past 17 years.” “Well, you know marijuana's illegal, don’t you? You can’t use it.” “Not even to save the world?” “No. It’s illegal,” he sternly informed me. “You cannot use something illegal.” “Not even to save the world?” we asked, stunned. “No, not even to save the world. It’s illegal. You can’t use it. Period.” “Don’t get me wrong. It’s a great idea,” he went on, “But they’ll never let you do it.” “Why don’t you go ahead and tell the Secretary of Agriculture that a crazy man from California gave you documentation that showed that hemp might be able to save the planet and that your first reaction is that he might be right and it needs some serious study. What would he say?” “Well, I don’t think I’d be here very long after I did that. After all, Fm an officer of the government.” “Well, why not call up the information on your computer at your own USDA library. Thatfe where we got the infor¬ mation in the first place.” He said, “I can’t sign out that information.” “Well, why not? We did.” “Mr. Herer, you’re a citizen. You can sign out for any¬ thing you want. But/am an officer of the Department of Agriculture. Someone’s going to want to know why I want all this information. And then FU be gone.” Finally, we agreed to send him all the information we got from the USDA library, if he would j ust look at it. He said he would, but when we called back a month lat¬ er, he said that he still had not opened the box that we sent him and that he would be sending it back to us un¬ opened because he did not want to be responsible for the information, now that the Bush administration was re¬ placing him with their own man. We asked him if he would pass on the information to his successor, and he replied, “Absolutely not.” In May, 1989, we had virtually the same conversation and result with his cohort, Dr. Gary Evans of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Science, the man in charge of stopping the global warming trend. In the end, he said, “If you really want to save the plan¬ et with hemp, then you (hemp/marijuana activists) would find a way to grow it without the narcotic (sic.) top—and then you can use it.” This is the kind of frightened (and frightening) irrespon¬ sibility we’re up against in our government. — 12"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Chapter Three: February 1938: Popular Mechanics Magazine: “NEW BILLION DOLLAR CROP” February 1938: Mechanical Engineering Magazine: “THE MOST PROFITABLE & DESIREABLE CROP THAT CAN BE GROWN” Modern technology was about to be applied to hemp production, making it the number one agricultural resource in America. Two of the most respected and influential journals in the nation, Popular Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering, forecast a bright future for American hemp. Thousands of new products creating millions of new jobs heralded the end of the Great Depression. Instead hemp was persecuted, outlawed and forgotten at the bidding ofW. R. Hearst who branded hemp the “Mexican killer weed, marijuana As early as 1901 and continuing to 1937, the U.S. Department of Agriculture repeatedly predicted that, once machinery capable of harvesting, stripping and separating the fiber from the pulp was invented or engineered, hemp would again be America’s Number One farm crop. This was reaffirmed in the pop¬ ular press when Popular Mech¬ anics published its February, 1938 article “Bilfion-Dollar Crop.” The first reproduction of this arti¬ cle in over 50 years was in the original edition of this book. The article is reproduced here exactly as it was printed in 1938. Because of the printing dead- fine, this article was prepared in the Spring of 1937, when cannabis hemp for fiber, pa¬ per, dynamite and oil, was still legal to grow and was, in fact, an incredibly fast growing industry. Also reprinted on these pages is an excerpt from the Mechanical Engineering article about hemp, pub¬ lished the same month. It originated as a paper pre¬ sented a year earlier at the Feb. 26, 1937 Agricul¬ tural Processing Meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New Brunswick, New Jersey. Reports from the USDA during the 1930s and Congressional testimony in 1937 showed that culti¬ vated hemp acreage had been doubling in size in America almost every year from the time it hit its bottom acreage, 1930—when 1,000 acres were plant¬ ed in the U.S.—to 1937—when 14,000 acres were cul¬ tivated—with plans to continue to double that acreage annually in the forseeable future. As you will see in these articles, the newly mecha¬ nized cannabis hemp industry was in its infancy, but well on its way to again becoming America’s largest agriculture crop. And, in fight of subsequent develop¬ ments (e.g., biomass energy technology, etc.), we now know that hemp is potentially the world’s largest industry and most important ecological tool. The Popular Mechanics article was the very first time in American history that the term “bilfion-dollar”* was ever applied to any U.S. agricultural crop. * Equivalent to $20-$40 billion now. Experts today conservatively estimate that, once fully restored in America, hemp industries will generate $500 billion to a trillion dollars per year, and will save the planet and civilization from fossil fuels and their derivatives—and from deforestation! If Anslinger, DuPont, Hearst and their paid-for (know it or not) politicians had not outlawed hemp—under the pretext of marijuana (see chapter 4, “Last Days of Legal Cannabis”)—and suppressed hemp knowledge from our schools, researchers and even scientists, the glowing predictions in these arti¬ cles would already have come true by now—and more benefits than anyone could then envision—as new technologies continue to develop. As one colleague so aptly put it: “These articles were the last honest word spoken on hemp’s behalf for over 40 years..

It is hemp, a crop that will not compete with other American products. Instead, it will displace imports of raw material and manufactured products produced by un¬ derpaid coolie and peasant labor and it will provide thousands of jobs for American workers throughout the land. The machine which makes this possible is designed for removing the fiber-bearing cortex from the rest of the stalk, making hemp fiber avail¬ able for use without a prohib¬ itive amount of human labor. Hemp is the standard fiber of the world. It has great ten¬ sile strength and durability. It is used to produce more than 5,000 textile products, ranging from rope to fine laces, and the woody “hurds” remaining after the fiber has been removed contain more than seventy-seven per cent cellu¬ lose, and can be used to produce more than 25,000 products, ranging from dynamite to Cellophane.

From the farmers’ point of view, hemp is an easy crop to grow and will yield from three to six tons per acre on any land that will grow corn, wheat, or oats. It has a short growing season, so that it can be plant¬ ed after other crops are in. It can be grown in any state of the union.

Retting is simply rotting as a result of dew, rain and bacterial action. Machines were developed to separate the fibers mechanically after retting was complete, but the cost was high, the loss of fiber great, and the quality of fiber comparatively low. With the new machine, known as a decorticator, hemp is cut with a slightly modified grain binder. It is delivered to the machine where an automatic chain conveyor feeds it to the breaking arms at the rate of two or three tons per hour. The hurds are broken into fine pieces which drop into the hopper, from where they are delivered by blower to a baler or to truck or freight car for loose shipment. The fiber comes from the other end of the machine, ready for baling. From this point on almost anything can happen. The raw fiber can be used to pro¬ duce strong twine or rope, woven into bur¬ lap, used for carpet warp or linoleum backing or it may be bleached and refined, with resinous by-products of high com¬ mercial value. It can, in fact, be used to replace the foreign fibers which now flood our markets. Thousands of tons of ■ hemp hurds are used every year by one large powder com¬ pany for the manufacture of dynamite and TNT. A large paper company, which has been paying more than a million dollars a year in duties on foreign-made cigarette papers, now is manufacturing these papers from American hemp grown in Minnesota. A new factory in Illinois is producing fine bond papers from hemp. The natural ma¬ terials in hemp make it an economical source of pulp for any grade of paper man¬ ufactured, and the high percentage of alpha cellulose promises an unlimited supply of raw material for the thousands of cellulose products our chemists have developed. It is generally believed that all linen is produced from flax. Actually, the majority comes from hemp—authorities estimate that more than half of our imported linen fabrics are manufactured from hemp fiber. Another misconception is that burlap is made from hemp. Actually, its source is usually jute, and practically all of the bur¬ lap we use is woven by laborers in India who receive only four cents a day. Binder twine is usually made from sisal which comes from Yucatan and East Africa. All of these products, now imported, can be produced from home-grown hemp. Fish nets, bow strings, canvas, strong rope, overalls, damask tablecloths, fine linen garments, towels, bed linen and thousands of other everyday items can be grown on American farms. Our imports of foreign fabrics and fibers average about $200,000,- 000 per year; in raw fibers alone we im¬ ported over $50,000,000 in the first six months of 1937. All of this income can be made available for Americans. The paper industry offers even greater possibilities. As an industry it amounts to over $1,000,000,000 a year, and of that eighty per cent is imported. But hemp will produce every grade of paper, and govern¬ ment figures estimate that 10,000 acres de¬ voted to hemp will produce as much paper as 40,000 acres of average pulp land. One obstacle in the onward march of hemp is the reluctance of farmers to try new crops. The problem is complicated by the need for proper equipment a reasonable distance from the farm. The machine can¬ not be operated profitably unless there is enough acreage within driving range and farmers cannot find a profitable market un¬ less there is machinery to handle the crop. Another obstacle is that the blossom of the female hemp plant contains marijuana, a narcotic, and it is impossible to grow hemp without producing the blossom. Federal regulations now being drawn up require registration of hemp growers, and tentative proposals for prev enting narcotic produc¬ tion are rather stringent. However, the connection of hemp as a crop and marijuana seems to be exagger¬ ated. The drug is usually produced from wild hemp or locoweed which can be found on vacant lots and along railroad tracks in every state. If federal regulations can be drawn to protect the public without pre¬ venting the legitimate culture of hemp, this new crop can add immeasurably to American agriculture and industry.

Improvements in tilling, planting, and harvesting mechanisms have materially helped the large farmers and, to a certain degree, the smaller ones, but the processes from the crop to the yam are crude, wasteful, land injuri¬ ous. Hemp, the strongest of the vegetable fibers, gives* the greatest production per acre and requires the least atten¬ tion. It not only requires no weeding, but also kills off all the weeds and leaves the soil in splendid condition for the following crop. This, irrespective of its own monetary val¬ ue, makes it a desirable crop to grow. In climate and cultivation, its requisites are similar to flax and, like flax, should be harvested before it is too ripe. The best time is when the lower leaves on the stalk wither and the flowers shed their pollen. Like flax, the fibers run out where leaf stems are on the stalks and are made up of laminated fibers that are held to- clockwise, and hemp to the left or counterclockwise. Before [World War I], Russia produced 400,000 tons of hemp, all of which is still hand-broken and hand-scutched. They now produce half that quantity and use most of it themselves, as also does Italy from whom we had large importations. In this country, hemp, when planted one bu. per acre, yields about three tons of dry straw per acre. From 15 to 20 percent of this is fiber, and 80 to 85 percent is woody material. The rapidly growing market for cellulose and wood flour for plastics gives good reason to believe that this hitherto wasted material may prove sufficiently prof¬ itable to pay for the crop, leaving the cost of the fiber suf¬ ficiently low to compete with 500,000 tons of hard fiber now imported annually. Hemp being from two to three times as strong as any of the hard fibers, much less weight is required to give the same yardage. For instance, sisal binder twine of 40-lb. tensile strength runs 450 ft. to the lb. A better twine made To meet world competition profitably, we must improve our methods all the way from the field to die loom. Early International Harvester mule drawn mechanical hemp reaper provided a tremendous savings in human labor. Mechanical harvesting was a major step in making American hemp a competitive natural fiber. MECHANICAL ENGINEERING February 26,1937 “Flax and Hemp: From the Seed to the Loom” was published in the February 1938 issue of Mechanical Engineering magazine. It was originally presented at the Agricultural Processing Meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in New Brunswick , NJ of February 26,1937 by the Process Industries Division. FLAX AND HEMP: FROM THE SEED TO THE LOOM by George A. Lower This country imports practically all of its fibers except cotton. The Whitney gin, com¬ bined with improved spinning methods, enabled this country to produce cotton goods so far be¬ low the cost of linen that linen manufacture practically ceased in the United States. We can¬ not produce our fibers at less cost than can other farmers of the world. Aside from the higher cost of labor, we do not get as large production. For instance, Yugoslavia, which has the greatest fiber production per acre in Europe, recendy had a yield of 883 lbs. Comparable figures for other countries are Argentina, 749 lbs.; Egypt 616 lbs.; and India, 393 lbs.; while the average yield in this country is 383 lbs.

Hemp is not subject to as many kinds of deterioration as are the tropical fibers, and none of them lasts as long in either fresh or salt water. While the theory in the past has been that straw should be cut when the pollen starts to fly, some of the best, fiber handled by Minnesota hemp people was heavy with seed. This point should be proved as soon as possible by plant¬ ing a few acres and then harvesting the first quarter when the pollen is flying, the second and third a week or ten days apart, and the last when the seed is fully matured. These four lots should be kept sepa¬ rate and scutched and pro¬ short tangled fiber then goes to a vibrating cleaner that shakes out some of the hurds. In Minnesota and Illinois, another type has been tried out. This machine consists of a feeding table upon which the stalks are placed horizontal¬ ly. Conveyor chains carry the stalks along until they are grasped by a clamping chain that grips them and carries them through half of the machine. j- -* ■ .+**,§/% International hemp harvester cut the rows to begin the natural dew retting hemp and laid it out in thin layered process near Mason City, Iowa. cessed separately to detect any difference in the quality and quantity of the fiber and seed. Several types of machine are available in this country for harvesting hemp. One of these was brought out several years ago by the International Harvester Company. Recently, growers of hemp in the Middle West have re¬ built regular grain binders for this work. This rebuilding is not particularly expensive and the machines are reported to give satisfactory service. Degumming of hemp is analogous to the treatment giv¬ en flax. The shards probably offer slightly more resistance to digestion. On the other hand, they break down readily upon completion of the digestion process. And excellent fiber can, therefore, be obtained from hemp also. Hemp, when treated by a known chemical process, can be spun on cotton, wool, and worsted machinery, and has as much absorbance and wearing quality as linen. Several types of machines for scutching the hemp stalks are also on the market. Scutch mills formerly operating in Illinois and Wisconsin used the system that consisted of a set of eight pairs of fluted rollers, through which the dried straw was passed to break up the woody portion. From there, the fiber with adhering shards -- or hurds, as they are called - was transferred by an operator to an endless- chain conveyor. This carries the fiber past two revolving single drums in tandem, all having beating blades on their periphery, which beat off most of the hurds as well as the fibers that do not run the full length of the stalks. The pro¬ portion of line fiber to tow is 50 percent each. Tow or A pair of intermeshing lawnmower-type beaters are placed at a 45-degree angle to the feeding chain and break the hemp stalks over the sharp edge of a steel plate, the object being to break the woody portion of the straw and whip the hurds from the fiber. On the other side and slightly beyond the first set of lawnmower beaters is an¬ other set, which is placed 90-degrees from the first pair and whips out the hurds. The first clamping chain transfers the stalks to another to scutch the fiber that was under the clamp at the beginning. Unfortunately, this type of scutcher makes even more tow than the so-called Wisconsin type. This tow is difficult to reclean because the hurds are broken into long slivers that tenaciously adhere to the fiber. Another type passes the stalks through a series of gradu¬ ated fluted rollers. This breaks up the woody portion into hurds about 3/4 inch long, and the fiber then passes on through a series of reciprocating slotted plates working between stationary slotted plates. Adhering hurds are removed from the fiber which con¬ tinues on a conveyor to the baling press. Because no beat¬ ing of the fiber against the grain occurs, this type of scutcher makes only line fiber. This is then processed by the .same methods as those for flax. Paint and lacquer manufacturers are interested in hempseed oil which is a good drying agent. When markets have been developed for the products now being wasted, seed and hurds, hemp will prove, both for the farmer and the public, the most profitable and desirable crop that can be grown, and one that can make American mills indepen¬ dent of importations. Recent floods and dust storms have given warnings against the destruction of timber. Possibly, the hitherto waste products of flax and hemp may yet meet a good part of that need, especially in the plastic field which is grow¬ ing by leaps and bounds. — 18 —"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The World’s Most Valuable & Versatile Natural Resource /f nAv?

DEWEY, Botanist in Charge of Fiber-Plant Investigations WHAT HEMP HURDS ARE. The woody inner portion of the hemp stalk, broken into pieces and separated from the fiber in the processes of breaking and scutching, are called hemp hurds. These hurds correspond to shives in flax, but are much coarser and are usually softer in texture. When the USDA published Bulletin 404 in 1916, it used for the first time hemp pulp paper (as opposed to hemp fiber paper) to demonstrate the outstanding qualities of using hemp hurds for pulp instead of using tree pulp; not only to reduce the cutting of trees but also to reduce the need for sulphuric acid compounds to break down the plant for the making of paper. The frontal piece over the cover of the bulletin (reproduced above) tells you that the document is printed on hemp pulp paper, although the frontal piece itself was not printed on hemp pulp. One acre of hemp equals 4.1 acres of forest land. Cannabis Sativa (I.) at three months."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter Four: THE LAST DAYS OF LEGAL CANNABIS As you now know, the industrial revolution of the 19th century was a setback for hemp in world commerce, due to the lack of mechanized harvesting and breaking technology needed for mass production. But this natural resource was far too valuable to be relegated to the back burner of history for very long. By 1916, U.S.DA.. Bulletin 404 predicted that a decorticating and harvesting machine would be developed, and hemp would again be America's largest agricultural industry. In 1938, Popular Mechanics, Mechanical Engineering and others introduced a new generation of investors the first fully operational hemp decorticating devices; bringing us to this next bit of history: BREAKTHROUGH IN PAPERMAKING If hemp was legally cultivated using 20th Century technology, it would be the single largest agricultural crop in the United States and world today. (Popular Mechanics February 1938; Mechanical Engineering, February 1938; U.S. Department of Agriculture.) **> In fact, when the preceding two articles were prepared early in 1937, hemp was still legal to grow. And those who predict¬ ed billions of dollars in new cannabis businesses did not consider income from medicines, energy (fuel) and food which would now add another trillion dollars or more annually to our troubled economy. Relaxational smoking would add only a relatively minor amount to this figure. The most important reason that the 1938 magazine articles projected billions in new income was hemp for “pulp paper” (as op¬ posed to fiber or rag paper). Other reasons were for its fiber, seed and many other pulp uses. This remarkable new hemp pulp technology for pa¬ permaking was invented in 1916 by our own U.S. Department of Agriculture chief scientists, botanist Lyster Dewey and chemist Jason Merrill. As the USDA bulletin suggested, this process had to stay in the laboratory until the invention of decor¬ ticating and harvesting machinery allowed for its economical utilization. Until this time hemp paper had only been made from rags and stalk fibers, while the fiber and cellu¬ lose-rich hurds were burnt to fertilize the soil. A PLAN TO SAVE OUR FORESTS Some cannabis plant strains regularly reach tree¬ like heights of 20 feet or more in one growing season. The new paper process used hemp “hurds”—77% of the hemp stalk’s weight, which was then a wasted by-product of the fiber stripping process. If the hemp pulp paper process of 1916 were in use today, it could replace 40 to 70% of all pulp paper, including corrugated boxes, computer printout paper and paper bags. In 1916, USDA Bulletin No. 404 (see picture), reported that one acre of can¬ nabis hemp, in annual rotation over a 20-year period, would produce as much pulp for paper as 4.1 acres of trees being cut down over the same 20-year period. This process would use only 1/4 to 1/7 as much pollut¬ ing sulfur-based acid chemicals to break down the glue-like lignin that binds the fibers of the pulp, or even none at all using soda ash. The problem of dioxin contamination of rivers is avoided in the hemp paper making process, which does not need to use chlorine bleach (as the wood pulp paper making pro¬ cess requires) but instead substitutes safer hydrogen peroxide in the bleaching process. All this lignin must be broken down to make pulp paper. Hemp pulp is only 4-10% lignin, while trees are 18-30% lignin. Thus hemp provides four times as much pulp with at least four to seven times less pol¬ lution. 21 —"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"As we have seen, this hemp pulp-paper potential depended on the invention and the engineering of new machines for stripping the hemp by modern technology. This would also lower demand for lumber and reduce the the cost of housing, while at the same time helping re-oxygenate the planet. 1 As an example: If the new (1916) hemp pulp paper process were legal today, it would soon replace about 70% of all wood pulp paper, including computer printout paper, corrugated boxes and paper bags. Pulp paper made from 60% to 100% hemp hurds is stronger and more flexible than paper made from wood pulp. Making paper from wood pulp damages the environment. Hemp papermaking does not. (Dewey & Merrill, Bulletin #404, U.S.DA., 1916; New Scientist, 1980; Kimberly Clark production from its giant French hemp-fiber paper subsidiary De Mauduit, 1937 through 1984.) CONSERVATION & SOURCE REDUCTION Reduction of the source of pollution, usually from manufacturing with petrochemicals or their deriva¬ tives, is a cost-cutting waste control method often called for by environmentalists. Whether the source of pollution is CFCs (chloro- flouro-carbons) from spray cans, computers and re¬ frigeration, or tritium and plutonium produced for military uses, or the sulfuric acids used by paper- makers, reducing the source of pollution is the goal. In the supermarket when you are asked to choose paper or plastic for your bags, you are faced with an environmental dilemma: paper from trees that were cut, or plastic bags made from fossil fuel and chemi¬ cals. With a third choice available—hemp hurd paper —one could choose a biodegradable, durable paper from an annually renewable source—the hemp plant. The environmental advantages of harvesting hemp annually—leaving the trees in the ground!—make papermaking from hemp hurds crucial for source re¬ duction of pollution, along with using hemp to re¬ place fossil fuel as an energy source. A CONSPIRACY TO WIPE OUT THE NATURAL COMPETITION When mechanical hemp fiber stripping machines and machines to conserve hemp’s high-cellulose pulp finally became state-of-the-art, available and afford¬ able in the mid-1980s, the enormous timber acreage and businesses of the Hearst Paper Manufacturing Division, Kimberly Clark (USA), St. Regis—and vir¬ tually all other timber, paper and large newspaper holding companies—stood to lose billions of dollars and perhaps go bankrupt. Coincidentally, in 1937 DuPont had just patented processes to make plastics from oil and coal, as well as new sulfate/sulfite processes to make paper from wood pulp which would, according to their own corpo¬ rate records and historians,* account for over 80% of all its railroad carloadings for the next 60 years. * Author’s research & communications with DuPont, 1985. The environmental advantages of harvesting hemp annually—leaving the trees in the ground!—make papermaking from hemp hurds crucial for source reduction of pollution. If hemp had not been made illegal, 80% of DuPont’s business would never have come to be; nor would the great majority of the pollution which has been inflict¬ ed on our Northwestern and Southeastern rivers have ever occurred. In an open marketplace, hemp would have saved the majority of America’s vital family farms and would probably have boosted their numbers, despite the Great Depression of the 1930s. Competing against the environmentally-sane hemp-paper and natural plastic technology would have jeopardized the lucrative financial schemes of Hearst, DuPont and DuPont’s chief financial backer, Andrew Mellon of the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh. “SOCIAL REORGANIZATION” A series of secret meetings were held. Mellon, in his role as Hoover's Secretary of the Treasury, in 1931 appointed his fu¬ ture nephew-in¬ law, Harry J. An- slinger, to be head of the newly re-or¬ ganized Federal Bureau of Narcot¬ ics and Dangerous Drugs (FBNDD), a post he held for the next 31 years. These industrial barons and finan¬ ciers knew that machinery to cut, bale, decorticate (to separate the fiber from the high-cellulose hurd), and process hemp into paper or plastics was becoming available in the mid-1980s. Cannabis hemp would have to go. In DuPont’s 1937 Annual Report to its stockholders, the company strongly urged continued investment in its new, but not readily accepted, petrochemical syn¬ thetic products. DuPont was anticipating “radical changes” from “the revenue raising power of govem- 22"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Man-Made Fiber ... THE TOXIC ALTERNATIVE TO NATURAL FIBERS. The late 1920s and 1930s saw continuing consolidation of power into the hands of a few large steel, oil and chemical (munitions) companies. The U.S. federal government placed much of the textile production for the domestic econ¬ omy in the hands of their chief munitions maker, DuPont. The processing of nitrating cellulose into explosives is very similar to the process for nitrating cellulose into syn¬ thetic fibers and plastics. Rayon, the first synthetic fiber, is simply stabilized guncotton, or nitrated cloth, the basic explosive of the 19th century. “Synthetic plastics find application in fabricating a wide variety of articles, many of which in the past were made from natural products,” beamed Lammot DuPont (Popular Mechanics, June 1939, pg. 805). “Consider our natural resources,” the president of DuPont continued, “The chemist has aided in conserving natural resources by developing synthetic products to supplement or wholly replace natural products.” DuPont’s scientists were the world’s leading researchers into the processes of nitrating cellulose and were in fact the largest processor of cellulose in the nation in this era. The February, 1938 Popular Mechanics article stated “Thousands of tons of hemp hurds are used every year by one large powder company for the manufacture of dynamite and TNT.” History shows that Dupont had largely cornered the market in explosives by buying up and consolidating the smaller blasting companies in the late 1800s. By 1902 they controlled about two-thirds of industry output. They were the largest powder company, supplying 40% of the munitions for the allies in WWI. As cellulose and fiber researchers, DuPont’s chemists knew hemp’s true value better than anyone else. The value of hemp goes far beyond line fibers; although recognized for linen, canvas, netting and cordage, these long fibers are only 20% of the hemp- stalks’ weight. 80% of the hemp is in the 77% cellulose hurd, and this was the most abundant, cleanest resource of cellulose (fiber) for paper, plastics and even rayon. The empirical evidence in this book shows that the feder¬ al government—through the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act- allowed this munitions maker to supply synthetic fibers for the domestic economy without competition. The proof of a successful conspiracy among these corporate and governing interests is simply this: In 1991 DuPont was still the largest producer of man-made fibers, while no citizen has legally harvested a single acre of textile grade hemp in over 50 years. An almost unlimited tonnage of natural fiber and cellu¬ lose would have become available to the American farmer in 1937, the year DuPont patented nylon and the polluting wood-pulp paper sulfide process. All of hemp’s potential value was lost. Simple plastics of the early 1900s were made of nitrated cellulose, directly related to DuPont’s munitions-making processes. Celluloid, acetate and rayon were the simple plastics of that era, and hemp was well known to cellulose researchers as the premier resource for this new industry to use. Worldwide, the raw material of simple plastics, rayon and paper could be best supplied by hemp hurds. Nylon fibers were developed between 1926-1936 by the noted Harvard chemist Wallace Carothers, working from German patents. These polyamides are long fibers based on observed natural products. Carothers, supplied with an open-ended research grant from DuPont, made a compre¬ hensive study of natural cellulose fibers. He duplicated nat¬ ural fibers in his labs and polyamides—long fibers of a spe¬ cific chemical process—were developed. Coal tar and petroleum based chemicals were employed, and different devices, spinnerets and processes were patented. This new type of textile, nylon, was to be con¬ trolled from the raw material stage, as coal, to the complet¬ ed product; a patented chemical product. The chemical company centralized the production and profits of the new “miracle” fiber. The introduction of nylon, the introduction of high-vol¬ ume machinery to separate hemp’s long fiber from the cel¬ lulose hurd, and the outlawing of hemp as “marijuana” all occurred simultaneously. The new man-made fibers (MMFs) can best be described as war material. The fiber making process has become one based on big factories, smokestacks, coolants and haz¬ ardous chemicals, rather than one of stripping out the abundant, naturally available fibers. Coming from a history of making explosives and muni¬ tions, the old “chemical dye plants” now produce hosiery, mock linens, mock canvas, latex paint and synthetic car¬ pets. Their polluting factories make imitation leather, upholstery and wood surfaces, while an important part of the natural cycle stands outlawed. The standard fiber of world history, America's traditional crop, hemp, could provide our textiles, paper and be the premier source for cellulose. The war industries—DuPont, Allied Chemical, Monsanto, etc.,—are protected from com¬ petition by the marijuana laws. They make war on the nat¬ ural cycle and the common farmer. _ Shan Clark Sources: Encyclopedia of Textile^ 3rd Edition by the editors of American Fab¬ rics and Fashions Magazine, William C.

In The Marijuana Convic¬ tion (U. of Virginia press, 1974), Richard Bonnie and Charles Whitebread II detailed this process: “By the fall of 1936, Herman Oliphant (general counsel to the Treasury Department) had decided to employ the taxing power [of the fed¬ eral government], but in a statute modeled after the National Firearms Act and wholly unrelated to the 1914 Harrison [narcotics] Act. Oliphant himself was in charge of preparing the bill. Anslinger directed his army to turn its campaign toward Washington. “The key departure of the marijuana tax scheme from that of the Harrison Act is the notion of the pro¬ hibitive tax. Under the Harrison Act, a non-medical user could not legitimately buy or possess narcotics. “To the dissenters in the Supreme Court decisions upholding the act, this clearly demonstrated that Congress’ motive was to prohibit conduct rather than raise revenue. So in the National Firearms Act, de¬ signed to prohibit traffic in machine guns, Congress “permitted” anyone to buy a machine gun, but re¬ quired him to pay a $200 transfer tax* and carry out the purchase on an order form. “The Firearms Act, passed in June 1934, was the first act to hide Congress’ motives behind a “pro¬ hibitive” tax. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the anti-machine gun law on March 29, 1937. Oliphant had undoubtedly been awaiting the Court’s decision, and the Treasury Department introduced its marihuana tax bill two weeks later, April 14,1937.” Thus, DuPont’s decision to invest in new technologies based on “forcing acceptance of sudden new ideas of in¬ dustrial and social reorganization” makes sense. * About $4,000 in 1992 dollars. A QUESTION OF MOTIVE This prospect was alluded to during the 1937 Senate hearings by Matt Rens, of Rens Hemp Company: Mr. Rens: Such a tax would put all small producers out of the business of growing hemp, and the propor¬ tion of small producers is considerable... The real pur¬ pose of this bill is not to raise money, is it? Senator Brown: Well, we’re sticking to the proposi¬ tion that it is. Mr. Rens: It will cost a million. Senator Brown: Thank you. (Witness dismissed.) HEARST, HIS HATRED & HYSTERICAL LIES Concern about the effects of hemp smoke had al¬ ready led to two major governmental studies. The British governor of Indi$ released the Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission 1893-1894 on heavy bhang smokers in the subcontinent. And in 1930, the U.S. government sponsored the Siler Commission study on the effects of off-duty smoking of marijuana by American servicemen in Panama. Both reports concluded that marijuana was not a problem and recommended that no criminal penalties apply to its use. In early 1937, Assistant U.S. Surgeon General Walter Treadway told the Cannabis advisory subcom¬ mittee of the League of Nations that, “It may be taken for a relatively long time without social or emotional breakdown. Marihuana is habit-forming... in the same sense as...sugar or coffee.” But other forces were at work. The war fury that led to the Spanish American war in 1898 was ignited and fanned by William Randolph Hearst through his na¬ tionwide newspaper chains, marking the beginning of “yellow journalism”* as a force in American politics. * Webster’s dictionary defines “yellow journalism” as the use of cheaply sensational or unscrupulous methods in newspapers and other media to attract or influence the readers. In the 1920s and 30s, Hearst’s newspaper chain led the deliberate new yellow journalism campaign to have hemp outlawed. From 1916 to 1937, as an exam¬ ple, the story of a car accident in which a marijuana cigarette was found would dominate the headlines for weeks, while alcohol-related car accidents (which out¬ numbered marijuana-connected accidents by more than 1,000 to 1) made only the back pages. This same theme of marijuana-related car accidents was burned into the minds of Americans over and over again (1936-1938) by showing marijuana related car accident headlines in movies such as “Reefer Madness” and “Marijuana— Assassin of Youth.” BIGOTRY AND APARTHEID Starting with the 1898 Spanish American War, the Hearst newspaper had denounced Spaniards, Mexican-Americans and Latinos. After the seizure of 800,000 acres of Hearst’s prime Mexican timberland by the “marihuana” smoking army of Pancho Villa,* these slurs intensified. * The song “La Cucaracha\" tells the story of one of Villa’s men look¬ ing for his stash of “marijuana por fumar!” (to smoke!) Non-stop for the next for three decades, Hearst painted the picture of the lazy pot-smoking Mexican—still one of our most insidious prejudices. W.R. Hearst — 24 —"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"He also did a similar racist smear campaign against the “Yellow Peril” of the Chinese. Hearst, through pervasive and repetitive use, brought the word Marijuana 9 into English. Hearst papers from 1910 to 1920 would say the ma¬ jority of Negroes raping white women could be traced directly tp cocaine. This continued for 10 years until Hearst decided it was not cocaine crazed Negroes raping white women—it was now marijuana crazed Negroes raping white women. Hearst and other sensational tabloids ran hysteri¬ cal headlines atop stories portraying Negroes and Mexicans as frenzied beasts under the influence of marijuana, who played anti-white “voodoo-satanic” music (jazz) and heaped disrespect and “viciousness” onto the predominantly white readership. This Jim Crow (apartheid) crime wave included: stepping on white men’s shadows, looking white people directly in the eye for three seconds or more, looking at a white woman twice, laughing at a white person, etc. For such “crimes,” hundreds of thousands of Mexi¬ cans and Negroes spent, in aggregate, millions of years in prisons and on chain gangs, under brutal segregation laws in effect throughout the U.S. until the 1950s and 60s. Hearst, through pervasive and repetitive use, pounded the obscure Mexican slang word ‘marijuana’ into the English-speaking American consciousness. ‘Hemp’ was discarded. ‘Can¬ nabis,’ the scientific term, was ignored or buried. The actual Spanish word for hemp is ‘canamo.’ But using a Mexican Sonoran colloquialism—marijuana, often Americanized as ‘marihuana’—guaranteed that no one would realize the world’s chief natural medi¬ cine and premier industrial resource had been out¬ flanked, outlawed and pushed out of the language. THE PROHIBITIVE MARIJUANA TAX In the secret Treasury Department meetings con¬ ducted between 1935 and 1937 prohibitive tax laws were drafted and strategies plotted. ‘Marijuana’ was not banned outright; the law called for an “Occu¬ pational excise tax upon dealers, and a transfer tax upon dealings in marijuana.” Importers, manufacturers, sellers and distributors had to register with the Secretary of the Treasury and pay the occupational tax. Transfers were taxed at $1 an ounce; $100 an ounce if the dealer was un¬ registered. Sales to an unregistered taxpayer were prohibitively taxed. At the time, “raw drug” cannabis sold for one dollar an ounce. 2 The year was 1937.

Ways and Means Chairman Robert L. Doughton,* a key DuPont ally, quickly rubber-stamped the secret Treasury bill and sent it sailing through Congress to the President. * Per Jerry Colby, author of DuPont Dynasties, Lyle Stewart, 1984. “DID ANYONE CONSULT THE AMA?” However, even within his controlled Committee hearings, many expert witnesses spoke out against the passage of these unusual tax laws. Dr. James Woodward, for instance, who was both a physician and an attorney, testified on behalf of the American Medical Association (AMA). He said in effect, the whole fabric of federal testimo¬ ny was tabloid sensationalism! No real testimony was being used in its passage! This law could possibly in ignorance deny the world a potential medicine, espe¬ cially now that the medical world was just beginning to find which ingredients in cannabis were active. He stated to the committee that the whole reason the AMA hadn’t come out against the marijuana tax law sooner was that marijuana had been described in the press for 20 years as “killer weed from Mexico.” The AMA doctors had just realized “two days be¬ fore” these Spring, 1937 hearings, that the plant Con¬ gress intended to outlaw was known medically as cannabis—the benign substance used in scores of ill¬ nesses, for 100 years in America, with perfect safety. “We cannot understand yet, Mr. Chairman, why this bill should have been prepared in secret for two years without any intimation, even to the profession,” protested Woodward, “that it was being prepared.” He and the AMA* were quickly denounced by Anslinger and the entire congressional committee, and curtly excused. 3 * The A.MA. and the Roosevelt administration were strong antago¬ nists in 1937. When the Marijuana Tax Act bill came up for oral report, discussion, and vote on the floor of Congress, only one pertinent question was asked from the floor: “Did anyone consult with the AMA and get their opinion?” Representative Vinson answering for the Ways and Means Committee replied, “Yes, we have, a Dr. Wharton [mistaken pronunciation of Woodward?] and [the AMA] are in complete agreement!” With this memorable lie, the bill passed, and be¬ came law in September, 1937. A federal police force was created, able to demand millions of wasted years in jail and even the deaths of individual Americans in order to save poison, polluting industries, and to rein¬ force some white politicians’ policies of racial hatred.

OTHERS SPOKE OUT, TOO Also lobbying against the Tax Act with all its ener¬ gy was the National Oil Seed Institute, representing the high quality machine lubrication producers as well as paint manufacturers. Speaking to the House Ways and Means Committee in 1937, their general counsel, Ralph Loziers, testified eloquently about the hemp seed oil that was to be, in effect, outlawed: “Respectable authorities tell us that in the Orient, at least 200 million people use this drug; and when we take into consideration that for hundreds, yes, thou¬ sands of years, practically that number of people have been using this drug. It is significant that in Asia and elsewhere in the Orient, where poverty stalks abroad on every hand and where they draw on all the plant re¬ sources which a bountiful nature has given that domain —it is significant that none of those 200 million people has ever, since the dawn of civilization, been found us¬ ing the seed of this plant or using the oil as a drug. “Now, if there were any deleterious properties or prin¬ ciples in the seed or oil, it is reasonable to suppose that these Orientals, who have been reaching out in their poverty for something that would satisfy their morbid appetite, would have discovered it.... “If the committee please, the hemp seed, or the seed of the cannabis sativa l., is used in all the Oriental nations and also in a part of Russia as food. It is grown in their fields and used as oatmeal. Millions of people every day are using hemp seed in the Orient as food. They have been doing that for many generations, especially in peri¬ ods of famine.... “The point I make is this—that this bill is too all in¬ clusive. This bill is a world encircling measure.

Last year, there was imported into the U.S. 62,813,000 pounds of hemp seed.

Anslinger,* director of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN). (This agency has since evolved into the Drug Enforcement Admin¬ istration [DEA]). * Harry J. Anslinger was director of the new Federal Bureau of Narcotics from its inception in 1931 for the next 31 years, and was only forced into retirement in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy af¬ ter Anslinger tried to censor the publications and publishers of Pro¬ fessor Alfred Lindsmith (The Addict and the Law, Washington Post, 1961) and to blackmail and harass his employer, Indiana University. Anslinger had come under attack for racist remarks as early as 1934 by a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, Joseph Guffey, for such things as referring to “ginger-colored niggers” in letters circulated to his department heads on FBN stationery. Prior to 1931, Anslinger was Assistant U.S. Com¬ missioner for Prohibition. Anslinger, remember, was hand-picked to head the new Federal Bureau of Narcotics by his uncle-in-law, Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury under President Herbert Hoover. The same Andrew Mellon was also the owner and largest stockholder of the sixth largest bank (in 1937) in the United States, the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, one of only two bankers for DuPont* from 1928 to the present. * DuPont has borrowed money from b anks only twice in its entire 170-year history, once to buy control of General Motors in the 1920s. Its banking business is the prestigious plum of the financial world. In 1937, Anslinger testified before Congress saying, “Marijuana is the most violence causing drug in the history of mankind.” This, along with Anslinger’s outrageous racist statements and beliefs, was made to the Southern- dominated congressional committee and is now an embarrassment to read in its entirety. For instance, Anslinger kept a “Gore File,” culled almost entirely from Hearst and other sensational tabloids—e.g., stories of axe murders, where one of the participants reportedly smoked a joint four days before committing the crime. Anslinger pushed on Congress as a factual state¬ ment that about 50% of all violent crimes committed in the U.S. were committed by Spaniards, Mexican- Americans, Latin Americans, Filipinos, Negroes and Greeks, and these crimes could be traced directly to marijuana. (From Anslinger’s own records given to Pennsylvania State University, Li Cata Murders, etc.) Not one of Anslinger’s marijuana “Gore Files” of the 1930s is believed to be true by scholars who have painstakingly checked the facts. 4 SELF-PERPETUATING LIES In fact, F.B.I. statistics, had Anslinger bothered to check, showed at least 65% to 75% of all murders in the U.S. were then—and still are—alcohol related. As an example of his racist statement, Anslinger read into U.S. Congressional testimony (without ob¬ jection) stories about “coloreds” with big lips, luring white women with jazz music and marijuana. He read an account of two Negro students at the University of Minnesota doing this to a white coed “with the result of pregnancy.” The Congressmen of 1937 gasped at this and at the fact that this drug seemingly caused white women to touch or even look at a “Negro.” Virtually no one in America other than a handful of rich industrialists and their hired cops knew that their chief potential competitor—hemp—was being outlawed under the name “marijuana”. That’s right. Marijuana was most likely just a pre¬ text for hemp prohibition and economic suppression. The water was further muddied by the confusion of marijuana with Loco Weed (Jimson Weed). The situa- , tion was not clarified by the press, which continued to print the disinformation into the 1960s. At the dawn of the 1990s, the most extravagant and ridiculous attacks on the hemp plant draw national media attention—such as a study widely reported by health journals in 1989 that claimed marijuana smokers put on about a half a pound of weight per day. Now in 1992 they just want to duck the issue. (American Health, July/August, 1989.) Meanwhile, serious discussions of the health, civil liberties and economic aspects of the hemp issue are frequently dismissed as being nothing but an “excuse so that people can smoke pot”—as if people need an ‘excuse’ to state the facts about any matter. One must concede that, as a tactic, lying to the pub¬ lic about the beneficial nature of hemp and confusing them as to its relationship with “marijuana” has been very successful. Footnotes 1.

Who are they protecting? From what?” —Fred Oerther, M.D., Portland Oregon, September, 1986. MOVING TO CRUSH DISSENT After the 1938-1944 New York City “LaGuardia Marijuana Report* refuted his argument, by report¬ ing that marijuana caused no violence at all and cit¬ ing other positive results; Harry J. Anslinger, in pub¬ lic tirade after tirade, denounced Mayor Fiorella LaGuardia, the New York Academy of Medicine and the doctors who researched the report. Anslinger proclaimed that these doctors would nev¬ er again do marijuana experiments or research with¬ out his personal permission, or be sent to jail! He then used the full power of the United States government, illegally, to halt virtually all research into marijuana while he blackmailed the American Medical Association (AMA)* into denouncing the New York Academy of Medicine and its doctors for the research they had done. * Why, you ask, was the AMA now on Anslinger’s side in 1944-45 after being against the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937? Answer: since Anslinger’s FBN was responsible for prosecuting doctors who pre¬ scribed narcotic drugs for what he, Anslinger, deemed illegal purpos¬ es, they (the FBN) had prosecuted more than 3,000 AMA doctors for illegal prescriptions through 1939. In 1939, the AMA made specific peace with Anslinger on marijuana. The results: Only three doctors were prosecuted for illegal drugs of any sort from 1939 to 1949. The 1938-1944 New York City “LaGuardia Marijuana Report” refuted the idea that marijuana caused violence, and cited other positive results. To refute the LaGuardia report, the AMA, at Anslinger’s personal request, conducted a 1944-45 study showing that 34 Negro GI’s (and one white GI for statistical “control”) who smoked marijuana be¬ came disrespectful of white soldiers and officers in the segregated military. (See Appendix p.lll, “Army Study of Marijuana,” Newsweek, Jan. 15,1945.) This technique of biasing the outcome of a study is known among researchers as “gutter science.” POT & THE THREAT OF PEACE However, from 1948 to 1950, Anslinger stopped feeding the press the story that marijuana was vio¬ lence causing and began “Red Baiting,” typical of the McCarthy era. Now the frightened American public was told that this was a much more dangerous drug than he origi¬ nally thought. Testifying before a strongly anti- Communist Congress in 1948—and thereafter con¬ tinually in the press—Anslinger proclaimed that marijuana caused its users to become so peaceful—and pacifistic!—that the Communists could and would use marijuana to weaken our American fighting men's will to fight. This was a 180-degree turnaround of the original pretext on which “violence causing” cannabis was outlawed in 1937. Undaunted, however, Congress now voted to continue the marijuana law—based on the exact opposite reasoning they had used to outlaw cannabis in the first place. It is interesting and even absurd to note that An¬ slinger and his biggest supporters—Southern con¬ gressmen and his best senatorial friend, Senator Joseph McCarthy* of Wisconsin—from 1948 on, con¬ stantly received press coverage on the scare. * According to Anslinger’s autobiographical book, The Murderers, and confirmed by former FBN agents, Anslinger had been supplying morphine illegally to a U.S. senator—Joseph McCarthy—for years. The reason given by Anslinger in his book? So the communists would not be able to blackmail this Great American Senator for his drug-dependency weakness. (Dean Latimer, Flowers In The Blood ; Harry Anslinger, The Murderers.) 28 —"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The communists had the potential to sell marijuana to American boys to sap their will to fight—to make us a nation of zombie pacifists. Of course, the com¬ munists of Russia and China ridiculed this American marijuana paranoia ev¬ ery chance they got—in the press and at the United Nations. In 1943, marijuana extracts were discontinued by Anslinger’s group as America’s first truth serum because it didn’t work all the time. People being interrogated would often giggle or laugh hysterically at their captors, get paranoid, or have insatiable desires for food. Unfortunately, the idea of pot and pacifism got so nj.uch sensational world press for the next decade that eventually Russia, China, and the Eastern Bloc communist countries (who grew large amounts of canna¬ bis) outlawed marijuana for fear that America would sell or give it to their peoples to make their soldiers pacifists. This was strange be¬ cause Russia, Eastern Europe, and China had been growing and ingest¬ ing cannabis as a medi¬ cal drug, relaxant and work tonic for hundreds and even thousands of years, with no thought of marijuana laws. (The J.V. Dialogue Soviet Press Digest, Oct., 1990 report¬ ed a flourishing illegal hemp business, despite the frantic efforts by Soviet law enforcement agencies to stamp it out. “In Kirghizia alone hemp plantations occupy some 3,000 hectares.\" In another area Russians are traveling three days into the “one of the more sinister places in the Moiyn-Kumy desert,” to harvest a special high grade, drought resistant variety of hemp or known locally as anasha.) A SECRET PROGRAM TO CONTROL MINDS & CHOICES Through a report released in 1983 under the Freedom of Information Act, it was discovered (after 40 years of secrecy) that Anslin- ger was appointed in 1942 to a top-secret committee to create a “truth serum” for the OSS, Office of Strategic Services, which evolved into the CIA, the Central Intel¬ ligence Agency. (Rolling Stone, August 1983.) Anslinger and his spy group picked, as America’s first truth serum, “honey oil,” a much purer, almost taste¬ less form of hash oil, to be administered in food to: spies, saboteurs, military prisoners and the like, to “spill the truth,” without their knowledge. Fifteen months later, in 1943, marijuana extracts were discontinued by An¬ slinger’s group as America’s first truth serum because it was noted that they didn’t work all the time: The people being interro¬ gated would often giggle or laugh hysterically at their captors, get paranoid, or have insatiable desires for food (the munchies?). Also, the report noted that Ameri¬ can OSS agents and other in¬ terrogation groups started using the honey oil illegally themselves, and would not give it to the spies. In Anslin¬ ger’s OSS group’s final report on marijuana as a truth- serum, there was no mention of violence caused by the drug! In fact, the opposite was indicated. The OSS and later the CIA continued the search and tried other drugs as a truth serum; psilo- cybe or amanita mushrooms and LSD, to name a few. The CIA secretly tested these concoctions on American agents for 20 years. THE BUSH/QUAYLE/LILLY PHARMACEUTICAL SELL OUT In America, marijuana’s most outspoken oppo¬ nent is none other than President George Bush, former Director of the CIA under Gerald Ford (1975-1977) and past director of President Reagan’s “Drug Task Force” (1981-1988). After leaving the CIA in 1977, Bush was made director of Eli Lilly by none other than Dan Quayle’s father and family, who owned controlling interest in the Lilly company and the Indianapolis Star. Dan Quayle later acted as go- between for drug kingpins, gun runners and gov¬ ernment officials in the Iran-Contra scandals. The entire Bush family were large stockholders in Lilly, Abbott, Bristol and Pfizer, etc. After Bush’s disclosure of assets in 1979, it became public that Bush’s family still has a large interest in Pfizer and substantial amounts of stock in the other aforementioned drug companies. In fact, Bush actively lobbied illegally both with¬ in and without the Administration as Vice President in 1981 to permit drug companies to dump more unwanted, obsolete or especially do¬ mestically-banned substances on unsuspecting Third World countries. While Wee President, Bush continued to illegal¬ ly act on behalf of pharmaceutical companies by personally going to the IRS for special tax breaks for certain drug companies (e.g. Lilly) manufac¬ turing in Puerto Rico. In 1982, Vice President Bush was personally ordered to stop lobbying the IRS on behalf of the drug companies by the U.S. Supreme Court itself. (See Appendix, page 147.) He did—but they (the pharmaceuticals) still re¬ ceived a 23% additional tax break for their com¬ panies in Puerto Rico who make these American outlawed drugs for sale to Third World countries.

Our government finally admitted to doing all this to its own people in the 1970s—after 25 years of de¬ nials: drugging innocent, non-consenting, unaware citizens, soldiers and government agents—all in the name of national security, of course. These American “security” agencies constantly threatened and even occasionally imprisoned individ¬ uals, families and organizations that suggested the druggings had ever occurred. Anslinger supplied illegal morphine to U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy for years. It was three decades before the Freedom of Information Act forced the CIA to admit their lies through exposure on TV by CBS’s 60 Minutes and others. However, on April 16,1985 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the CIA did not have to reveal the identities of either the individuals or institutions in¬ volved in this travesty. The court said, in effect, that the CIA could decide what was or was not to be released under the Free¬ dom of Information Act, and that the courts could not overrule the agency’s decision.

CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT Before Anslinger started the pacifist zombie-mari¬ juana scare in 1948, he publicly used jazz music, vio¬ lence, and the “gore files” for five to seven more years (1943-50) in the press, at conventions, lectures, and Congressional hearings. We now know that on the subject of hemp, dis¬ guised as marijuana, Anslinger was a bureaucratic police liar. For over 50 years now Americans have been grow¬ ing up with and accepting Anslinger’s statements on the herb—from violence to evil pacifism and finally to the corrupting influence of music. Whether this was economically or racially inspired, or even because of up-beat music or some kind of syn¬ ergistic (combined) hysteria; it is impossible to know for sure. But we do know the U.S. Government, e.g., DEA, information disseminated on cannabis was then, and continues to be, a deliberate deception. As you will see in the following chapters, the weight of empirical fact and large amounts of corroborating evidence indicate that the Bush/Quayle administra¬ tion, along with their unique pharmaceutical connec¬ tions (see “Bush/Quayle/Lilly Pharmaceutical Sell¬ out” sidebar in this chapter), have probably conspired at the highest levels to withhold information and to disinform the public, resulting in the avoidable and needless deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. And they did it, it seems, intending to save their own investment—and their friends’—in the pharma¬ ceutical, energy and paper industries; and to give these poisonous, synthetic industries an insane ad¬ vantage over natural hemp and protect the billions of dollars in annual profits that they stood to lose if the hemp plant and marijuana were not prohibited! As a result, millions of years in jail time have been wasted, and millions of lives have been and continue to be ruined by what started out as Hearst’s, Anslinger’s and DuPont’s shameful economic lies, vi¬ cious racial libels and bigoted musical taste.

Comprehensive compendia of these works are designated as the prime sources for this medical chapter, as well as ongoing personal interviews with many researchers. AFFORDABLE, AVAILABLE HERBAL HEALTH CARE For more than 3,500 years, cannabis/hemp/mari¬ juana has been, depending on the culture or nation, either the most used or one of the most widely used plants for medicines. This includes: China, India, the Middle and Near East, Africa, and pre-Roman Catholic Europe (prior to 400 A.D.). Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, NORML, High Times and Omni magazine (September 1982) all indicate that, if marijuana were legal it would immediately replace 10% to 20% of all pharmaceutical prescription medicines (based on research through 1976). And probably, Mechoulam estimates, 40% to 50% of all medicines, including patent medicines, could contain some extract from the cannabis plant when fully re¬ searched.

SUPERSTAR OF THE 19TH CENTURY Marijuana was America’s number one analgesic for 60 years before the re-discovery of aspirin around 1900. From 1842 to 1900 cannabis made up half of all medicine sold, with virtually no fear of its high. The 1839 report on the uses of cannabis by Dr. W.B. O’Shaugnessy, one of the most respected members of the Royal Academy of Science, was just as important to mid-19th century Western medicine as the discov¬ eries of antibiotics (like penicillin and Terramycin) were to mid-20th century medicine. The Committee on Cannabis Indica for the Ohio State Medical Society concluded, “the gall and vinegar, or myrrhed wine, offered to our Saviour immediately before his crucifixion was, in all probability, a preparation of Indian hemp. n From 1850 to 1937, cannabis was prescribed as the prime medicine for more than 100 separate illnesses or diseases in American U.S. pharmacopoeia. In fact, the Committee on Cannabis Indica for the Ohio State Medical Society concluded that “High Bib¬ lical commentators [scholars]” believe “that the gall and vinegar, or myrrhed wine, offered to our Saviour immediately before his crucifixion was, in all prob¬ ability, a preparation of Indian hemp.” (Transcripts, Ohio State Medical Society 15th annual meeting, June 12-14,1860, pg. 75-100.) During all this time (pre-1000 B.C. to 1940s A.D.), researchers, doctors and drug manufacturers (Lilly, Parke-Davis, Squibb, etc.) had no idea what the ac¬ tive ingredients were in cannabis until Dr. R. Mechoulam discovered THC in 1964. 20TH century research As outlined in the previous chapters, the American Medical Association (AMA) and drug companies tes¬ tified against the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act because cannabis was known to have so much medical poten¬ tial and had never caused any observable addictions or death by overdose. — 31 —"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"They argued the possibility existed that, once the active ingredients in cannabis (such as THC Delta-9) were isolated and correct dosages established, cannabis could become a miracle drug. Research revealed positive indications when using cannabis for asthma, glaucoma, nausea from chemotherapy, anorexia, and tumors, as well as a general use antibiotic; epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, anorexia, multiple sclerosis, dystrophy, and tumors—all these merited further clinical studies. Twenty-nine years, however, would pass before American scientists could begin to even look into cannabis medicine again. THC Delta-9 was isolated by Dr. Raphael Mechoulam at the University of Tfel Aviv in 1964. His work confirmed that of Professor Taylor of Princeton, who had lead the research and identification of natu¬ ral THC Delta-9 precursors in the 1930s. Kahn, Adams and Loewe also worked with the structure of cannabis’ active ingredients in 1944. Since 1964, more than 400 separate compounds have been isolated in cannabis from over a thousand suspected compounds. At least 60 of the isolated com¬ pounds are therapeutic The United States, however, forbade this type of research through the bureaucrat¬ ic authority of Harry Anslinger until 1961, when he was forced to retire. (Omni magazine, Sept., 1982.) GROWING ACCEPTANCE By 1966, millions of young Americans were using marijuana. Concerned parents and government, wanting to know the dangers their children were risking, started funding dozens and later hundreds of marijuana health studies. Entrenched in the older generation’s minds were 30 years of Anslinger/Hearst scare stories: Murder, atrocity, rape, and even zombie pacifism. Federally sponsored research results began to ease Americans’ fears of cannabis causing violence or zom¬ bie pacifism, and hundreds of new studies suggested that hidden inside the hemp plants’ chemistry lay a medicinal array of incredible therapeutic potential. The government funded more and more studies. Soon, legions of American researchers had positive indications using cannabis with asthma, glaucoma, nausea from chemotherapy, anorexia, tumors, and epilepsy, as well as a general use antibiotic. Cumulative results showed evidence or favorable anomalies occurring, for Parkinson’s disease, anorex¬ ia, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy, plus thousands of anecdotal stories all merited further clinical study. Prior to 1976, reports of positive effects and new therapeutic indications for cannabis were almost a weekly occurrence in medical journals and the na¬ tional press. NATIONAL CONFERENCE PRAISED CANNABIS THERAPY POTENTIAL In November 1975 virtually all of America’s leading researchers on marijuana met at Asilomar Conference Center, Pacific Grove, California. Seminars were sponsored by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to address a compendium of studies from their earliest to most recent findings. When the seminars were over, practically all the participants (scientists) concluded that the federal government, with the hard evidence collected so far on the therapeutic potential of marijuana, should be rushing to invest tax money into more research. They felt the taxpayers should be informed there was every legitimate reason for the field of public health to continue large scale research on cannabis medicine and therapies. All the participants, it seems, believed this. Many of them (such as Mechoulam) believed that cannabis would be one of the world’s major medicines by the mid-1980s. MARIJUANA RESEARCH BANNED However, in 1976, just as multi-disciplined mari¬ juana research should have been going into its sec¬ ond- third- and fourth-generation studies (see Therapeutic Potential of Marijuana and NORML fed¬ eral files), a “surprise” United States government policy again forbade all promising federal research into marijuana’s therapeutic effects. This time, the research ban was accomplished when American pharmaceutical companies success¬ fully petitioned the federal government to be allowed to finance and judge 100% of the research. The previous 10 years of research had indicated a tremendous promise for the therapeutic uses of natu¬ ral cannabis, and this potential was quietly turned over to corporate hands—not for the benefit of the public, but to suppress the information. This plan, the drug manufacturers petitioned, would allow our private drug companies time to come up with patentable synthetics of the cannabis molecules at no cost to the federal government, and a promise of “no highs.” In 1976 the Ford Administration, NIDA and the DEA said, in effect, no American independent (read: university) research or federal health program would 32 —"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"be allowed to again investigate natural cannabis derivatives for medicine. This agreement was made without any safeguards guaranteeing integrity on the part of the pharmaceutical companies; they were allowed to regulate themselves. Private pharmaceutical corporations were allowed to do some “no high” research but it would be only for Delta-9 THC research, not any of the 400 other po¬ tentially therapeutic isomers in cannabis. Why did the drug companies conspire to take over marijuana research? Because recent US government research (1966-1976) had indicated or confirmed through hundreds of studies that even “natural” crude cannabis was the “best and safest medicine of choice” for many serious health problems. 1988: DEA JUDGE RULES THAT CANNABIS HAS MEDICAL VALUE The DEA’s own conservative administrative law judge, Francis Young, after taking medical testimony for 15 days and reviewing hundreds of DEA/NIDA documents posed against the evidence introduced by marijuana reform activists concluded in September, 1988 that “marijuana is one of the safest therapeuti¬ cally active substances known to man.” But, despite this preponderance of evidence, DEA Director John Lawn ordered on December 30, 1989, that cannabis remain listed as a Schedule One nar¬ cotic—having no known medical use. WELL, IF IT’S KNOWN ALL THIS SINCE 1975, WHAT’S THE GOVERNMENT WAITING FOR? PROTECTING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES’ PROFITS NORML, High Times and Omni (September, 1982) indicate that Eli Lilly Co.; Abbott Labs; Pfizer; Smith, Kline & French; and others would lose hun¬ dreds of millions to billions of dollars annually, and lose even more billions in Third World countries, if marijuana were legal in the U.S.* * Remember, these drug companies, at their own insistence, specif¬ ically by lobbying, got the Federal Government to prevent all positive research into medical marijuana in 1976, the last year of the Ford Administration. PUTTING THE FOX INTO THE HEALTH CARE CHICKEN COOP The drug companies took over all research and fi¬ nancing into analogs of synthetic THC, CBD, CBN, etc., promising “no high” before allowing the products on the market. Eh Lilly came out with Nabilone and later Marinaol, synthetic second cousins of THC Delta 9 and promised the government great results. Omni magazine, in 1982, stated that after nine years, Nabilone was still considered virtually useless when compared with real, home-grown THC-rich cannabis buds, and Marinol works in only 13% of pa¬ tients. Some 500,000 people are poisoned each year in Third World countries by drugs, pesticides, etc. that are sold to them by American companies, but which are banned from sale in the U.S. Marijuana users agree, they do not like the effects of Lilly’s Nabilone or Marinol. Why? You have to get three or four times as high on Nabilone or Marinol for it to produce the same benefits as smoking one cigarette of good cannabis bud. Omni also states that after tens of millions of dol¬ lars and nine years of research on medical marijuana synthetics, “these drug companies are totally unsuc¬ cessful,” even though raw, organic cannabis is a “su¬ perior medicine” which works so well naturally, on so many different illnesses. Omni also suggested the drug companies petition the government to allow “crude drug extracts” on the market in the real interest of public health. The gov¬ ernment and the drug companies, to date, have not responded. Or rather, they have responded by ignor¬ ing it. However, the Reagan/Bush/Quayle Adminis¬ tration is absolutely refusing to allow resumption of real (university) cannabis research, except under the worthless pharmaceutical synthetic studies. Omni suggests, and NORML and High Times con¬ cur, the reason the drug companies and Reagan/ Bush/Quayle want only synthetic THC legal is that simple extractions of the hundreds of ingredients from the cannabis crude drug would be enjoyed with¬ out pharmaceutical company patents which generate windfall monopolized profits. UNDERMINING THE NATURAL MEDICINES COMPETITION Eli Lilly, Pfizer and others stand to lose a third of their entire, highly profitable, patent monopoly on drugs induing Darvon; to take losses in their Tuinal and Seconal lines (as well as other patent fines rang¬ ing from muscle ointments to burn ointments, to thousands of other uses already known in 1966-1976) from a plant anyone can grow: cannabis hemp. Isn’t it curious that American drug companies and pharmacist groups* supply almost half the funding for the 4000 “Families Against Marijuana” type orga¬ nizations in America? The other half is supplied by Action, a federal VISTA agency, and by tobacco com- 33 —"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"AN UNFAIR RAP FOR HEMP After 20 years of study, the California Research Advisory Panel (RAP) in 1989 broke with the state Attorney General’s office (A.G.), under which it works, and called for the re-legalization of cannabis. “There is no point to continuing unmodified, much less intensified, the policies and laws that have so ob¬ viously failed to control the individual and societal damages associated with drug use,” summarized Vice Chairman Frederick Meyers, M.D., in a letter released with the group’s recommendations after the attorney general had suppressed the report and panel members elected to publish it at their own expense. This was a complete turnaround from the RAP's long history of suppressing medical usage. The long term impact of this shift remains to be seen. Chairman Edward P. O’Brien, Jr, appointed by the A.G., who dissented from the panel’s conclusions, had for years dominated this group, rigidly controlling what research could be performed—and limiting those applications to control of nausea and vomiting that is secondary to cancer chemotherapy. Under O’Brien, the panel systematically welshed on its mandate to provide compassionate medicinal ac¬ cess to cannabis. Any applications for using cannabis including the control of pain, spastic neurological dis¬ orders, etc., have been rejected Cannabis used to be the treatment of choice for vascular or migraine headache. (Osier, 1916; O’Shaugnessey, 1839) Cannabis has the unique characteristic of affecting the vascular circulation of the covering of the brain—the meninges. The reddened eyes of the mari¬ juana user are a reflection of this action. Unlike other drugs, however, cannabis has no appar¬ ent affect on the vascular system in general, except for a slight speeding up of the heart during the onset of the effects of the drug. RAP has discouraged the use of smoking cannabis in favor of synthetic Delta-9 THC capsules, despite crude cannabis’ favorable comparative results reported to the Food and Drug Administration. This has been frankly misrepresented in their re¬ ports to the legislature and testimony in the NORML vs. DEA case. Additionally, these memoranda favor¬ ably comparing smoked marijuana to oral THC have been buried in appendices to their reports—available in only four locations in the entire state of California! On September 30,1989, the medical marijuana pro¬ gram quietly expired, based on the staff’s assessment that not enough people had been treated to justify its extension. —Tbd Mikuriya, M.D. Berkeley, CA, 1990 panies, and liquor and beer makers like Anhauser Busch, Coors, Philip Morris, etc., or as a ‘public service’ by the ad agencies who represent them. * Pharmacists Against Drug Abuse, etc. See appendices. POISONING THE THIRD WORLD Colombia’s largest newspaper, Periodical el Tiempo (Bogota) reported in 1983—and was not disputed by the U.S. government or American pharmaceutical companies—that these same anti¬ marijuana crusading American pharmaceutical companies are guilty of a practice known as prod¬ uct dumping, wherein they “sell on the over-the- counter markets of Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Chile, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, over 150 different illegal, dangerous drugs.” Some of these drugs have been forbidden by the FDA for sale or use in the U.S. or its counterparts in Europe because they are known to cause malnu¬ trition, deformities and cancer. Yet they are sold over the counter to unsuspecting illiterates! The World Health Organization backs up this story with a conservative estimate: They say that some 500,000 people are poisoned each year in Third World countries by items (drugs, pesticides, etc.) sold by American companies but which are banned from sale in the U.S. Mother Jones magazine, 1979, “Unbroken Circle” June, 1989; The Progressive, April, 1991; et al. DESTROYING THE PUBLIC RECORD Some 10,000 studies were done on cannabis, 4,000 in the U.S., and only about a dozen have shown any negative results and these have never been replicated. The Reagan/Bush Administration put a soft “feeler” out in September of 1983, for all American universities and researchers to destroy all 1966-76 cannabis research work, including com- pendiums in libraries. Scientists and doctors so ridiculed this unparal¬ leled censorship move that the plans were dropped...for the moment. However, we know that large amounts of infor¬ mation have since disappeared, including the origi¬ nal copy of the USDA’s own pro-marijuana film Hemp for Victory. Worse yet, even the merest men¬ tion of the film was removed from the official record back to 1958 and has had to be painstaking¬ ly re-established as part of our national archives. Many archival and resource copies of USDA Bulletin 404 have disappeared. How much more irreplaceable knowledge has al¬ ready been lost? — 34 —"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Chapter Seven: THERAPEUTIC USE OF CANNABIS There are 60 or more therapeutic compounds in cannabis that are healing agents in medical and herbal treatments . The primary known one is THC, and the effectiveness of therapy is directly proportionate to the herb's potency or concentration of THC, Recent DEA reports of more potent marijuana therefore represent a major medical advance; but, incredibly, the government uses these very numbers to solicit bigger budgets and harsher penalties. Here's how people will benefit once the judgement and freedom of choice of doctor and patient are once again respected: THIS WRITER, RESPONSIBLE SCIENTISTS AND DOCTORS WANT TO WARN YOU: There is no pharmacological free lunch in cannabis or any drug. Negative reactions can result. A small percentage of people have negative or al¬ lergic reactions to marijuana. Heart patients could have problems, even though cannabis generally relieves stress, dilates the arteries, and in gen¬ eral lowers the diastolic pressure. A small percentage of people get especially high heart rates and anxieties with cannabis. These persons should not use it Some bronchial asthma sufferers benefit from cannabis; however, for others it may serve as an additional irritant For the overwhelming majority of people, cannabis has demonstrated literally hundreds of therapeutic uses. Among them: 1. ASTHMA More than 15 million Americans are affected by asthma. Smoking cannabis (what the AMA called the ‘raw drug’) would be beneficial for 80% of them and add 30 to 60 million person-years in the aggregate of extended life to current asthmatics over presently le¬ gal toxic medicines—especially theophyline for chil¬ dren. “Taking a hit of marijuana has been known to stop a full blown asthma attack.” (Personal communication with Dr. Donald Tashkin, December 12,1989.) The use of cannabis for asthmatics goes back thousands of years in literature. American doctors of the last century wrote in medical papers that asthma sufferers of the world would “bless” Indian Hemp (cannabis) all their fives. Today, no Californian (or American, for that matter) receives or uses legal cannabis for asth¬ ma. (Tashkin, Dr. Donald, UCLA Pulmonary Studies, 1969-90; Ibid., asthma studies, 1969-1976; Cohen, Sidney, & Stillman, Therapeutic Potential of Marijuana, 1976\\ Life Insurance Actuarial rates; Life shortening effects of childhood asthma, 1983.) 2. G LAUCOMA Fourteen percent of all blindness in America is from glaucoma, a progressive loss of vision. Cannabis smoking would benefit 90% of our 2,500,000 glauco¬ ma victims, and is two to three times as effective as any current medicines for reducing ocular pressure. And, cannabis use has no toxic side effects to the fiv¬ er and kidneys, nor is there any danger of the occa¬ sional sudden death syndromes associated with the legal pharmaceutical glaucoma drugs/drops. Most California eye doctors will discreetly advise their pa¬ tients to use “street” marijuana in addition to (or to mitigate) their toxic legal glaucoma medicines. (Harvard; Hepler & Frank, 1971, UCLA; Medical College of Georgia; University of North Carolina School of Medicine, 1975; Cohen & Stillman, Therapeutic Potential of Marijuana, UCLA, 1976; National Eye Institute.) 3. T UMORS A tumor is a mass of swollen tis¬ sue. Researchers at the Medical College of Virginia discovered that cannabis is an incredibly success¬ ful herb for reducing many types of tumors, both benign and mal¬ ignant (cancerous). The DEA and other federal agen¬ cies had ordered these tumor stud¬ ies done after hearing of erroneous reports of possible immunicological problems associated with cannabis smoke. When, instead of health problems, an appar¬ ent medical breakthrough occurred in 1975 and suc¬ cessful tumor reductions were recorded, orders were handed down by the DEA and the National Institute of Health to defund all further cannabis/tumor re¬ search and reporting. 1 4. N AUSEA RELIEF (E.G. AIDS, CANCER THERAPY, SEA SICKNESS) Chemotherapy treatment can help control cancer and AIDS, but it has some bad side effects, including nausea. “Marijuana is the best agent for control of nausea in cancer chemotherapy,” according to Dr. — 35 —"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Thomas Ungerleider, who headed California’s Mari¬ juana for Cancer research program from 1979 to 1984. This is also true in AIDS and even the unset¬ tled stomach common in motion sickness. Pharmaceutical nausea control drugs come in pills that are often swallowed by the patient only to be thrown back up. Because cannabis can be ingested as smoke, it stays in the sys¬ tem and keeps working even if vomiting continues. Throughout the state’s 10 year Compassionate Mari¬ juana Medical law, George Deukmejian, both as attor¬ ney general and as gover¬ nor, made it virtually im¬ possible for any dying can¬ cer patients to get can¬ nabis, with no regard for their suffering. The next attorney gener¬ al, John Van DeKamp, con¬ tinued harassing medical users and punishing grow¬ ers and would not even look into the history of medical cannabis or accept a copy of the Marijuana as Medicine report at a KABC radio talk show in August 1983. 5. E PILEPSY, M.S., BACK PAIN & MUSCLE SPASMS Cannabis is beneficial for 60% of all epileptics. It is definitely the best treat¬ ment for many, but not all types of epilepsy, and for victims’ post-seizure men¬ tal traumas. Cannabis ex¬ tract is more effective than Dilantin (a commonly pre¬ scribed anti-epileptic with severe side effects). Medical World News reported in 1971: “Marijuana ... is probably the most potent anti-epileptic known to medicine today.” (Mikuriya, Marijuana Medical Papers 1839-1972, page xxii .) Cannabis users’ epileptic seizures are of less inten¬ sity than the more dangerous seizures experienced by users of pharmaceuticals. Similarly, smoking can¬ nabis has proven to be a major source of relief for multiple sclerosis, which affects the nervous system and is characterized by muscular weakness, tremors, etc. Cannabis, smoked or applied as a herbal pack or poultice, is also the best muscle relaxant, back spasm medicine and antispasmodic medication on our plan¬ et, short of morphine. (Cohen & Stillman, Therapeutic Potential of Marijuana, 1976; Consult U.S. Pharmacopoeia prior to 1937; Mikuriya, Tod H., M.D., Marijuana Medical Papers, 1839- 1972.) 6. A NTIBIOTIC/ ANTIBACTERIAL CBD DISINFECTANTS Young un-budded hemp plants provide extractions of CBDs (cannabidiolic acids). There are many an¬ tibiotic uses of the cannabidiols, including treatment for gonorrhea. A 1990 Florida study indi¬ cated its use in treating herpes. The acid side of tetrahy¬ drocannabinol, cannabidi¬ ols occur inversely to the amount of the plant’s THC and is therefore more ac¬ ceptable to prohibitionists because “it won't get you high.” For virtually any disease or infection that can be treated with ter- ramycin, cannabis deriva¬ tives did better in Czech¬ oslovakian studies, 1952- 1955. 3 The Czechs in 1989 still publish farm crop re¬ ports on strategies to grow Cannabidiol rich hemp. (Also see Cohen & Stillman, Therapeutic Potential of Mari¬ juana’, Mikuriya, Tod H., M.D., Marijuana Medical Papers-, Roffinan, Marijuana as Medicine, 1982; International Farm Crop abstracts.) 7. A RTHRITIS, HERPES, CYSTIC FIBROSIS & RHEUMATISM Cannabis is a topical analgesic. 2 Until 1937, virtual¬ ly all com plasters, mustard plasters, muscle oint¬ ments, and fibrosis poultices were made from or with 36 ONE MAN S DETERMINATION Patric Mayers, with his testimony and personal lobbying, was instrumental in getting the California Legislature to pass a state law allowing cannabis for medical use. Mayers’ life was saved in 1976 when his doctors illegally advised him to use marijuana for his chemotherapy nausea. At this point, Mayers weighed only 93 pounds. The easily smoked cannabis eased Patric’s nausea and gave him an appetite for food. This lifesaving function of Cannabis, if developed in a laboratory, would be hailed around the globe and in every medical pub¬ lication, it would be Nobel Prize material. Instead, there is a forced silence because there is no money to be made on it. Mayers received the “best flower tops of Thai and sinsemilla” free from dealers and students in his San Francisco law school where Mayers was class president when stricken with cancer in 1975. Healthy and happily married in L.A., Mayers was shocked in 1981 to learn that the state attor¬ ney general, in charge of the medical cannabis pro¬ gram, refused to supply federally grown or even police-impounded contraband marijuana to cancer patients; cannabis to which he had legal access for doctors to prescribe or obtain for dying patients. In 1982, Mayers got mad and caused the L.A. Times, other media, and Willie Brown, Speaker of the California Assembly to demand compliance with the state’s 1979 marijuana law. Following a few months of visible compliance, the policy to block medical access was back in full force. After 10 years of run arounds, refusals and harassment, the well intended “Compassionate Marijuana” program lapsed automatically."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"cannabis extracts. Rheumatism was treated through¬ out South America until the 1960s with hemp leaves and/or flower tops heated in water or alcohol and placed on painful joints. In fact, this form of herbal medi¬ cine is still widely used in ru¬ ral areas of Mexico, Central and South America, and by California Latinos for relief of arthritis pain. Direct contact with THC killed herpes virus in a University of South Florida (Tampa) 1990 research study by Dr. Gerald Lancz, who warns that “smoking mari¬ juana will not cure herpes.” However, anecdotal reports indicate a faster drying and healing of the outbreak after topical application of “strong bud,” soaked in rubbing alco¬ hol and crushed into a paste. 8. LUNG CLEANER & EXPECTORANT Cannabis is the best natural expectorant to clear the hu¬ man lungs of smog, dust and the phlegm associated with tobacco use. Marijuana smoke effectively dilates the airways of the lungs, the bronchi, opening them to allow more oxygen into the lungs. It is also the best natural dilator of the tiny airways of the lungs, the bronchial tubes—making can¬ nabis the best overall bronchial dilator for 80% of the population (the remaining 20% sometimes show minor negative reactions). (See section on asthma—a disease that closes these passages in spasms —UCLA Tashkin studies, 1969-83; U.S. Costa Rican, 1980-82; Jamaican studies 1968-74.) Statistical evidence—show¬ ing up consistently as anoma¬ lies in matched populations —indicates that people who smoke tobacco cigarettes are usually better off and will live longer if they smoke COMPASSIONATE CANNABIS & CRUEL COPS From 1979 to 1989, California had a law that was supposed to help people get canna¬ bis for medical purposes. Many states now have doctors in charge of their own, indepen¬ dent cannabis programs. (L.A. Times, 1982, et al.) However, instead of putting the Cali¬ fornia “compassionate cannabis” program un¬ der the health department, it was given to the attorney general—-the state prosecutor. As far as we know, no Californian receives or has received legal cannabis for glaucoma, even though California law allowed for ex¬ perimental cannabis medicine for 10 years (from 1979 to 1989). Its use in any illness other than chemotherapy nausea is rare due to the current federal government’s natural- medical marijuana prohibition. Both as state Attorney General and gover¬ nor, George Deukmejian deliberately and consciously thwarted doctors’ and re¬ searchers’ attempts to acquire federal cannabis from him and refused to carry out the program passed by California legislators. When the state’s bill authorizing medical cannabis lapsed in July, 1989 almost no one had benefited from it—and no legislator even bothered to try to extend or implement it. The federal government has had no coordi¬ nating program since 1976 to deal with the 30 states whose legislators have passed med¬ ical marijuana laws (over federal and DEA objections). Even worse, the Feds give these patients and doctors, consciously and with malice aforethought, the worst possible, harshest and least therapeutic cannabis: the broad leaf. Healing agents and therapeutic compounds are concentrated in the flower tops. For these patients to buy top-grade “grass” on the black market costs anywhere from $200 to $400 per ounce.When the 1937 Marijuana Tax Ait was passed, one ounce of cannabis, (what the AMA called the ‘raw drug,’) was available from the drugstore for one dollar. cannabis moderately, too. (Jamaican, Costa Rican studies.) Millions of Americans have given up or avoided smoking tobacco products in favor of cannabis, which is not good news to the powerful tobacco lobby—Senator Jesse Helms and his cohorts. A turn of the century grandfather clause in U.S. tobacco law allows 400 to 6000 addition¬ al chemicals to be added. Additions since then to the average tobacco cigarette are unknown, and the public in the U.S. has “no right” to know what they are. Many joggers and mara¬ thon runners feel cannabis use cleans their lungs, allow¬ ing better endurance. The evidence indicates cannabis use will probably increase these outlaw Ameri¬ can marijuana-users’ lives by about one to two years— but they can lose their rights, property, children, state licenses, etc., for using that safest of substances: Cannabis. 9. SLEEP & RELAXATION Cannabis lowers blood pressure, dilates the arteries and reduces body tempera¬ ture an average of 1/2 de¬ gree, thereby relieving stress. Evening cannabis smokers in general report more restful sleep. Using cannabis allows most people a more complete rest with the highest amount of “alpha time” possible in sleep as compared to pre¬ scription or sleep-inducing patent sedatives. Prescription sleeping pills (the so called legal, safe and effective’ drugs) are often just synthesized analogs of truly dangerous plants 37"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Merck Manual: WHAT DOES THE U.S. MILITARY’S OFFICIAL FIELD MANUAL HAVE TO SAY ABOUT CANNABIS HERB The Merck Manual, the US military's field guide to medicine states: “Chronic or periodic administration of cannabis or cannabis substances produces] some psychic de¬ pendence because of the desired subjective effects, but no physical dependence; there is no abstinence syndrome when the drug is discontinued. “Cannabis can be used on an episodic but continu¬ ous basis without evidence of social or psychic dys¬ function. In many users the term dependence with it's obvious connotations probably is misapplied. “Many of the claims regarding severe biologic impact are still uncertain, but some others are not. Despite the acceptance of the \"new\" dangers of marijuana, there is still little evidence of biologic damage even among relatively heavy users. This is true even in the areas intensively investigated, such as pulmonary, immunologic, and reproductive function. “Marijuana used in the USA has a higher THC content than in the past. Many critics have incor¬ porated this fact into warnings, but the chief oppo¬ sition to the drug rests on a moral and political, and not a toxicologic, foundation.” Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, Fifteenth Edition, 1987, Robert Berkow, M.D., Editor-in-Chief Published by Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories Division of Merck and Co., Inc. like mandrake, henbane and belladonna. As we go to press in 1992, doctors, pharmacists and drug compa¬ nies are fighting off new legislation to restrict these often abused compounds (L.A. Times, April 2,1991). Unlike Valium, cannabis does not potentiate the ef¬ fects of alcohol. It is estimated that cannabis could replace more than 50% of Valium, Librium, Thora¬ zine, Stelazine, other “-zine” drugs and most sleeping pills. It is unconscionable that, over the past two decades, tens of thousands of parents have committed their own children, aged 11 to 17, to be treated by massive doses of so-called “-zine” drugs in order to get them off pot, at the urging of parent groups, the Feds and administrators and doctors from federally approved, private and high-profit drug rehabilitation centers. Often, “-zine” drugs do work to stop these youths from using pot. They also stop a kid from loving his or her dog, too—and the child stands a one-in-four chance of suffering from uncontrollable shaking for the rest of their lives.* But at least they’re not high. * The U.S. Center for Disease Control in Atlanta said that 20% to 40% of “-zine” drug users have or will develop permanent lifetime palsies (shakes), November, 1983. These prescription neurotoxins are chemically related to pesticide and the warfare nerve gas Sarin. Hundreds of private drug-rehabilitation centers and their leaders keep this policy alive and in front of the media, often quoting discredited reports from NIDA or DEA (see chapter 16, debunking)—because they earn fat profits selling their useless or destruc¬ tive ‘marijuana treatment’ of children. After all, a relapse just means using marijuana again after a number of bouts with an ‘authority.’ This is mind-control and an attempt to destroy indi¬ vidual free will. 10. THERAPEUTIC EMPHYSEMA POTENTIAL Medical research indicates that light cannabis smoking might be useful for a majority of mild em¬ physema victims. It would improve the quality of life for millions of sufferers and extend their life spans. The U.S. government and DEA (since 1976) say the side effect, being ‘high,’ is not acceptable, no matter how many years or lives it saves. Even though some 60 million Americans have tried marijuana and 25 to 30 million still smoke marijuana relaxationally, or use it responsibly as a form of daily self-medication, without one single death from overdose—ever. All research into the oxygen blood transfer effects caused by cannabis indicates that the chest (lung) pains, extremity pains, shallowness of breath, and headaches we may experience on heavy smog days are usually alleviated by light cannabis smoking throughout the day. However, heavy pot smoking works no better. Dr. Donald Tashkin, the U.S. government’s leading scientist on pulmonary research, told us in Dec¬ ember, 1989* that you cannot get or potentiate em¬ physema with cannabis smoking. * See Tashkin’s marijuana pulmonaiy research, UCLA, 1969-1989. This author has personally taken part in these studies for 10 years and has continuously interviewed Tashkin on cannabis’s medical in¬ dications. 11. SUPERIOR RELIEF FOR STRESS AND MIGRAINES Most of all: it is best for the world’s number one killer—stress. It can safely curtail or replace Valium, Librium or alcohol for millions of Americans. While cannabis intoxication varies with psychologi¬ cal set and social setting, “the most common response is a calm, mildly euphoric state in which time slows and a sensitivity to sights, sounds and touch is en¬ hanced.” 4 38 —"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"In contrast to marijuana’s safe therapeutic action, Benzodiazepines (valium) abuse is the number one drug abuse problem in the country, and is responsible for more emergency room admissions in the United States than either cocaine-related problems or mor¬ phine- and heroin-related admissions combined. 6 While tobacco constricts arteries, cannabis dilates them. Because migraine headaches are the result of artery spasms combined with over-relaxation of veins, the vascular changes cannabis causes in the covering of the brain (the meninges) usually make migraines disappear. Evidence of vascular change caused by cannabis can be seen in the user’s red eyes, which are exten¬ sions of the brain. However, unlike most other drugs, cannabis has no apparent effect on the vascular sys¬ tem in general, except for a slight increased heart rate during the onset of the high. 12. TO INCREASE THE APPETITE, Marijuana users often (but not always) get “the munchies,” a stimulated appetite for food, which makes cannabis the very best medicine on the planet to date for anorexia. Hundreds of thousands of Americans in old age, convalescent wards or hospital situations have anorexia. Most could be helped by cannabis—yet these Americans are being denied a healthy life by governmental policy dictated by government police! This effect can also extend the lives of victims of pancreatic cancer (eat or die). However, the DEA and U.S. Government prevented any research or use of cannabis in pancreatic cancer therapy since 1976. They have collectively allowed tens of thousands of people to die each year, denied the right to live rela¬ tively normal, healthy and productive lives. 13. TO REDUCE SALIVA Marijuana smoking can help dry your mouth for the dentist. This is the best way to dry the mouth’s saliva non-toxically in what is known among smokers as its “cotton mouth” effect. It could replace the highly toxic Probathine com¬ pounds produced by Searle & Co., the Canadian Board of Dentistry reported in studies conducted in the 1970s. This may also indicate that cannabis could be good for treating peptic ulcers. AIDS, DEPRESSION & HUNDREDS OF OTHER PRIME MEDICAL USES One well known effect of THC is to lift the spirit, or make you “high.” Cannabis users in Jamaica praise — 39 ganja’s benefits for meditation, concentration, con¬ sciousness-raising and promoting a state of well-be¬ ing and self assertiveness. 5 This kind of attitude ad¬ justment, along with a healthier appetite and better rest, often represents the difference between “dying of” AIDS and “living with” AIDS. Cannabis also eases small pains and some big ones and helps senior citizens live with aches and pains like arthritis, insomnia and debilitating infirmities, and enjoy life in greater dignity and comfort. Legend has it, and medical evidence indicates, that cannabis is the best overall treatment for dementia, senility, and maybe Alzheimer’s disease, for long-term memo¬ ry “gain” and hundreds of other benefits. U.S. statistics indicate that you will live eight to 24 years longer if you substitute daily cannabis use for daily tobacco and alcohol use. New research is out¬ lawed, of course. ACCEPTABLE RISKS Every U.S. Commission or federal judge who has studied the evidence has agreed that cannabis is one of the safest drugs known. With all its therapeutic uses, it has only one side effect that has been exag¬ gerated as a concern: the “high.” The DEA says this is not acceptable, so cannabis continues to be totally illegal in utter disrespect for both doctor and patient. Every day we entrust physicians to determine whether the risks associated with therapeutic, yet potentially dangerous, drugs are acceptable for their patients. Yet, doctors are not allowed to prescribe the herb that Judge Francis Young called the “safest therapeutically active substance known to man.” We don’t put our doctors in charge of stopping vio¬ lent crimes. The police and prosecutors should not be in charge of which herbal therapies people may use to treat their personal health problems. Footnotes: 1.

No other single plant source provides complete protein in such an easily digestible form, nor has the oils essential to life in as perfect a ratio for human health and vitality. Hemp is the highest of any plant in essential fatty acids. Hempseed oil is among the lowest in saturated fats at 8% of total oil volume. The oil pressed from hempseed contains 55% linoleic acid (LA) and 25% linolenic acid (LNA). Only flax oil has more linolenic acid at 58%, but hempseed oil is the highest in total essen¬ tial fatty acids at 80% of total oil volume. “These essential fatty acids are responsible for our immune response. In the old countiy the peasants ate hemp but¬ ter. They were more resistant to disease than the nobility.” The higher classes wouldn’t eat hemp because the poor ate it. — R. Hamilton, EDD., Ph.D. Medical Researcher-Biochemist U.CLA. Emeritus. LA and LNA are involved in produc¬ ing life energy from food and the move¬ ment of that energy throughout the body. Essential fatty acids govern growth, vitali¬ ty and state of mind. LA and LNA are involved in transferring oxygen from the air in the lungs to every cell in the body. They play a part in holding oxygen in the cell membrane where it acts as a barrier to invading viruses and bacteria, neither of which thrive in the presence of oxygen. The bent shape of the essential fatty acids keeps them from dissolving into each other. They are slippery and will not clog arteries like the sticky straight shaped satu¬ rated fats and the trans-tmy acids in cook¬ ing oils and shortenings that are made by subjecting polyunsaturated oils like LA and LNA to high temperatures during the refining process. LA and LNA possess a slightly nega¬ tive charge and have a tendency to form very thin surface layers. This property is called surface activity, and it provides the power to carry substances like toxins to the sur¬ face of the skin, intestinal tract, kidneys and lungs where they can be removed. Their very sensitivity causes them to break down rapidly into toxic compounds when refined with high heat or improper storage exposes them to light or air. Nature provides seeds with an outer shell that sqfely protects the vital oils and vitamins within from spoilage. It’s a per¬ fect as well as perfectly edible container. Hempseed can be ground into a paste simi¬ lar to peanut butter only more delicate in flavor. Udo Erasmus, Ph.D. nutritionist says: “hemp butter puts our peanut butter to shame for nutritional value.” The ground seeds can be baked into breads, cakes and casseroles. Hempseed makes a hearty addition to granola bars. Pioneers in the fields of biochemistry and human nutrition now believe cardio¬ vascular disease (CVD) and most cancers are really diseases of fatty degeneration caused by the continued over-consumption of saturated fats and refined vegetable oils that turn essential fatty acids into carcino¬ genic killers. One out of two Americans will die from the effects of CVD. One out of four Americans will die from cancer. Researchers believe cancers erupt when immune system response is weakened. And more Americans are succumbing to immune deficiency diseases than ever before. Promising studies are now under way using the essential oils to support the immune systems of HTV virus patients. The complete protein in hempseed gives the body all the essential amino acids required to maintain health, and provides the necessary kinds 'and amounts of amino acids the body needs to make human serum albumin and serum globulins like the immune enhanc¬ ing gamma globulin antibodies. The body’s ability to resist and recover from illness depends upon how rapidly it can produce massive amounts of antibod¬ ies to fend off the initial attack. If the glob¬ ulin protein starting material is in short supply the army of antibodies may be too small to prevent the symptoms of sickness from setting in. The best way to insure the body has enough amino acid material to make the globulins is to eat foods high in globulin proteins. Hempseed protein is 65% globu¬ lin edestin plus quantities of albumin (pre¬ sent in all seeds) so its easily digestible protein is readily available in a form quite similar to that found in blood plasma. Hempseed was used to treat nutritional deficiencies brought on by tuberculosis, a severe nutrition blocking disease that caus¬ es the body to waste away. (Czechoslo¬ vakia Tubercular Nutritional Study, 1955.) The energy of life is in the whole seed. Hempseed foods taste great and will insure we get enough essential amino acids and essential fatty acids, to build strong bodies and immune systems, and to main¬ tain health and vitality.

It is grown in their fields and used as oatmeal. Millions of people every day are using hemp seed in the Orient as food. They have been doing this for many generations, especially in periods of famine.” Now we know hemp seed is the plant kingdom’s richest source of life-giving essential fatty acids, and may well be the cure for cancer and heart disease. HEMP SEED: HUMANITY’S BEST SINGLE FOOD SOURCE No other single plant source can compare with the nutritional value of hemp seeds. Both the complete protein and the es¬ sential oils contained in hemp seeds are in ideal ratios for .human nutrition. Only soybeans contain a higher percentage of pro¬ tein, however, the composition of the protein in hemp seed is unique in the vegetable kingdom. Sixty-five percent of the protein content in hemp seed is in the form of globulin edestin. 1 (The word edestin comes from the Greek “edestos,” meaning edible.) The exceptionally high edestin content of hemp seed combined with albumin, another globular pro¬ tein contained in all seeds, means the readily avail¬ able protein in hemp seed contain all the essential amino acids in ideal proportions to assure your body has the necessary building blocks to create proteins like disease fighting immunoglobulins—antibodies whose job is to ward off infections before the symp¬ toms of sickness set in. 2 Cannabis seed protein even allows a body with nu¬ trition-blocking tuberculosis, or almost any other nu¬ trition-blocking ailment, to get maximum nourish¬ ment.* *Cohen & Stillman, Therapeutic Potential of Marijuana, Plenum Press, NY, 1976; Czech. Tubercular Nutritional Study, 1955. Even more important to building a strong immune system, hemp seeds are the highest source in the plant kingdom of essential fatty acids. These essen¬ tial oils, linoleic and linolenic acids, are responsible for the luster in your skin, hair, eyes, and even your thought processes. They lubricate (clear) the arteries and are vital to the immune system. These essential fatty acids were used by Dr. Joanna Budwig (nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year since 1979) to successfully treat “terminal” can¬ cer patients, as well as those suffering from cardio¬ vascular disease, glandular atrophy, gall stones, kid¬ ney degeneration, acme, dry skin, menstrual prob¬ lems and immune deficiency.

Emeritus, to speak out on behalf of “the life- giving values” of cannabis hemp. They state: “These essential oils support the immine system and guard against viral and other insults to the im¬ mune system. Studies are in progress using the es¬ sential oils to support the immune systems with vic¬ tims of the H.I.V. virus. So far they have been ex¬ tremely promising. “What is the richest source of these essential oils? Yes, you guessed it, the seeds of the cannabis hemp plant. ... The insane prohibitions against the most valuable plant on Earth, cannabis hemp, must yield to public demand... The promise of super health and the possibility of feeding the world is at our finger¬ tips.” (December 29,1991) — 41"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Hemp seed extracts, like soybeans, can be spiced to taste like- chicken, steak, or pork and can be used to make tofu-type curd and margarine, at less cost than soybeans. Sprouting any seed improves its nutritional value and hemp can be sprouted and used like any other seed sprout for salads or cooking. Hemp seed can be ground and used like flour, or cooked, then sweetened and combined with milk to produce a nutritional breakfast cereal—like oatmeal or cream of wheat. This type of porridge is known as a gruel. (Like the fiber, consuming hemp seeds will not get you high.) “Hemp is a favorite [bird seed] because of its nour¬ ishing oily content.” (Margaret McKenny, Birds in the Garden, Reynal & Hitchcock, NY, 1939.) Incred¬ ibly, when cannabis hemp is grown for seed, half the weight of the mature, harvested female plant is seed! The byproduct of pressing hemp seed for its nutri¬ tious vegetable oil is a high protein seed cake. Hemp seed cake was one of the world’s principal animal feeds until this century.* Hemp seed can supply a nearly complete diet for all domesticated animals (dogs, cats), many farm animals and poultry, and al¬ low animals maximum weight gain for less than cur¬ rent costs. And without any artificial growth steroids or other drugs currently poisoning the human race and food chain. *U.S. Agricultural Index; Frazier, Jack, The Marijuana Farmers, Solar Age Press, New Orleans, LA, 1972. SPECTRE OF WORLDWIDE FAMINE By itself, widespread use of hemp seed food protein could save many of the world’s children now dying of protein starvation! An estimated 60% of all children bom in Third World countries (about 12-20 million a year) will die this way before reaching five years of age. Many times that number have their lives dra¬ matically shortened and/or their brains decimated. 3 Remember, hemp is a hearty plant that grows al¬ most anywhere, even in adverse conditions. Australians survived two prolonged famines in the 19th century using almost nothing except hemp seeds for protein and hemp leaves for roughage. 4 Furthermore, recent studies indicate that depletion of the ozone layer threatens to reduce world soya pro¬ duction by a substantial amount—up to 30% or even 50%, depending on the fluctuation of the density of the ozone shield. But hemp, on the other hand, resists the damage caused by increasing ultraviolet radia¬ tion and actually flourishes in it by producing more cannabinoids which provide protection from ultravio¬ let light. 5 It’s no wonder that some Central and South Amer¬ icans hate America and want us out: They see us as ignorant killers. For years, our government demand¬ ed the paraquat poisoning of their lands; lands these farmers had grown cannabis on by law since 1545, when King Philip of Spain ordered it grown through¬ out his empire to provide food, sails, rope, towels, sheets and shirts—as well as providing one of the people’s most important folk medicines for fever, childbirth, epilepsy, and poultices for rheumatism. Today, if anyone is caught growing their old staple, cannabis, their U.S. supported govemment/military expropriates their lands. The leaders then qualify for more American foreign and military aid in exchange for adopting this policy of wiping out marijuana—one of their peoples’ oldest livelihoods, folk medicines, food staples and joys. A FUNDAMENTAL BIOLOGICAL LINK IN THE FOOD CHAIN Our politicians who made these marijuana prohibi¬ tion laws based on years of disinformation, may have doomed not only birds but also the human race to ex¬ tinction from another direction. Many animals eat birds and their eggs. Birds in the wild are essential to the food chain; and they contin¬ ue to diminish in population due to—among other things, such as petrochemical pesticides—the lack of hemp seed! With hemp seed in their diet, birds will live 10-20% longer, have more offspring, and their feathers will have more luster and oil, allowing longer flight. Prior to 1937, there were more than 10 million acres of seed-laden cannabis hemp growing wild in the U.S. Hundreds of milli ons of birds fed off them as their fa¬ vorite and most necessary food until our government began its policy of total eradication of this most pri¬ mary link in the food chain. Oblivious to these inherent biocide (killing all life) dangers, our government continues this insane policy to exterminate the earth’s number one life-giving plant—hemp— both here and abroad.

Now, we must also consider the future of hemp. We predict the net effect from ending American hemp prohibition will be to generate ii ripple effect” economics—a revitalized American agriculture producing raw hemp; providing th? resource for a multitude of industries creating millions of good jobs for skilled and professional workers throughout America* The wealth remains in the local communities. ENERGY AND THE ECONOMY The book Solar Gas (1980), Science Digest, Omni Magazine, The Alliance for Survival, the “Green Party” of West Germany and others put the total fig¬ ure of our energy costs at 80% of the total dollar ex¬ pense of living for each human being. In validation; 82% of the total value of all issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange, other world stock exchanges, etc, are tied directly to: • Energy supply companies (Exxon, Shell, etc.) Wells/coal mines (Con Edison, and so forth); • Energy transportation, (pipeline companies, oil shipping and delivery companies) or; • Refineries and retail sales (Exxon, Mobil, Shell, So. Calif. Edison, NY Edison, et al.) Eighty-two percent of all your money means that roughly into 33 of every 40 hours you work going to pay for the ultimate energy cost in the goods and ser¬ vices you purchase, whichever way (transportation, heating, cooking, lighting). Americans—5% of world population—in their drive for more ‘net worth’ and ‘productivity’ use 25% to 40% of the worlds’ energy. The hidden cost to the environment cannot be mea¬ sured. Our current fossil energy sources also supply about 80% of the solid and airborne pollution which is slow¬ ly poisoning the planet. (See U.S. EPA report 1983-89 on coming world catastrophe from carbon dioxide im¬ balance caused by burning fossil fuels). The cheapest substitute for these expensive and wasteful energy methods is not wind or solar panels, nuclear, geo¬ thermal, and the like, but using the evenly distribut¬ ed fight of the sun to grow biomass. On a global scale the plant capable of producing the most biomass is hemp, the only annually renew¬ able resource capable of replacing all fossil fuels. The early Oil Barons (Rockefeller of Standard; Rothschild of Shell; et al), paranoically aware in the Twenties of the possibilities of Ford’s methanol scheme* and its cheapness, dropped and kept oil prices incredibly low, between $1 to $4 per barrel (there are 42 gallons in an oil barrel) for almost 50 years until 1970; so low, in fact, that no other energy source could compete with them. Then once they were sure of the lack of competition, the price jumped to almost $40 per barrel in the next 10 years. When hemp is grown for biomass as an energy crop, CO 2 is u breathed” in by the living plants, then when the hemp biomass is burned for energy the CO 2 is released back into the air. The CO 2 cycle is balanced. * Henry Ford even grew marijuana on his estate after 1937, possi¬ bly to prove the cheapness of methanol production at Iron Mountain. He even made plastic cars with wheat straw, hemp and sisal. (Popular Mechanics, Dec. 1941, “Pinch Hitters for Defense.\") (See photo, page 47.) Meanwhile, Rudolph Diesel invented the diesel en¬ gine, which he intended to fuel “by a variety of fuels, especially veg¬ etable and seed oils.” By the year 2000, the U.S. will have burned 80% of its petroleum resources, while our coal reserves may last 100 years or so longer. But the decision to con¬ tinue burning coal has serious drawbacks. This high- sulfur coal is responsible for our add rain, which al¬ ready kills 50,000 Americans and 5,000 to 10,000 Canadians annually. (Brookhaven National Laboratory, 1986.) 43 —"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Biomass conversion to fuels should begin immedi¬ ately to both stop planetary pollution and make us energy independent. CLEAN, RENEWABLE FUEL SOURCE Fuel is not synonymous with petroleum. Biomass energy systems can supply a sustainable source of fuel and will create millions of new jobs. Hemp biomass derived fuels can replace every type of fossil fuel energy product, (see chart p. 48) During transpiration the growing hemp plants “breathe in” CO 2 (carbon dioxide) to build cell struc¬ ture; the left over oxygen is breathed out replenish¬ ing earth’s air supply. Then when the carbon rich hemp biomass is burned for energy the CO 2 is re¬ leased back into the air. The CO 2 cycle comes close to ecological balance when the new fuel crop is grown the next year. (Not all of the biomass crop gets converted into fuels. Some leaves, stalk stubble and all of the roots remain in the field as crop residues. This carbon rich organic matter adds to the soil fertility, and with each passing season a little more carbon dioxide from the air enters the soil, so the biomass fuel crops slowly reduce the amount of car¬ bon dioxide from our polluted atmosphere.) Farming only 6% of the continental U.S. with biomass would provide all of America’s oil and gas energy needs , thus ending our dependence on fossil fuels. Hemp is the number one biomass source on Earth: capable of producing 10 tons per acre in four months. Biomass conversion through pyrolysis (applying high heat to organic material in the absence of air or in reduced air) produces clean burning charcoal to re¬ place coal. Sulfur emitted from coal-fired boiler smokestacks is the primary cause of acid rain. The rainfall in New England often falls between household vinegar and lemon juice in its acidity on the -pH scale. This is bad for every cell membrane it contacts, doing the most harm to the simplest life forms. Charcoal contains no sulfur, so when it is burned for industry no sulfur is emitted from the process. The biomass “cracking” process also produces non¬ sulfur fuel oils capable of replacing fossil fuel oils like diesel oil. And the net atmospheric CO 2 doesn’t rise when biomass derived fuel oils are burned. Pyrolysis uses the same “cracking” technology em¬ ployed by the petroleum industry in processing fossil fuels. The gasses that remain after the charcoal and fuel oils are extracted from hemp can be used for driving electric power co-generators, too! This biomass conversion process can be adjusted to produce charcoal, fuel oils and process steam, methanol, as well as chemicals important to indus¬ try: acetone, ethyl acetate, tar, pitch and creosote. The Ford Motor Co. successfully operated a biomass ‘cracking’ plant in the 1930s at Iron Mountain, Michigan. “Progress in Biomass Conversion” Vol. 1, Sarkanen & Tillman, ed¬ itors; Energy Farming in America, Osbum, Lynn, BACH pub., 1989. Hemp seed contains 30% (by volume) oil. This oil has been used to make high grade diesel fuel oil and aircraft engine and precision machine oil. Throughout history, hempseed oil was used for light¬ ing in oil lamps. Legend says the genie’s lamp burned hemp seed oil, as did Abraham the prophet’s. In Abraham Lincoln’s time only whale oil came near hemp seed oil in popularity for fuel. BIOMASS FOR ENERGY ABUNDANCE Hemp stems are 80% hurds (pulp byproduct after the hemp fiber is removed from the plant). Hemp hurds are 77% cellulose—a primary chemical feed stock (industrial raw material) used in the produc¬ tion of chemicals, plastics and fibers. Depending on which U.S. agricultural report is correct, an acre of full grown hemp plants can sustainably provide from four to 50 or even 100 times the cellulose found in cornstalks, kenaf, or sugar cane—the planet’s next highest annual cellulose plants. In most places, hemp can be harvested twice a year and, in warmer areas such as Southern California, Tfexas, Florida and the like, it could be a “year round” crop. Hemp has a short growing season and can be planted after food crops have been harvested. An independent, semi-rural network of efficient and autonomous farmers will become the key economic player in the production of energy in this country. Hemp is the only biomass source available that is capable of making the U.S. energy inde¬ pendent. The United States government pays (in cash or in “kind”) for farmers to refrain from growing on 89 mil¬ lion acres of farmland each year, called the “soil bank.” And ten mill i on to 89 million acres of hemp or other woody annual biomass planted on this restrict¬ ed, un-planted fallow farmland (our Soil Bank) would make energy a whole new ball game and be a real at¬ tempt at doing something to save the Earth. Each acre of hemp would yield 1000 gallons of methanol. Fuels from hemp, along with the recycling of paper, etc., would be enough to run America virtu- — 44 —"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"ally without oil. FAMILY FARMS OR FOSSIL FUEL? By the year 2000, when our petroleum resources have dwindled to 20% of their original size, America will have four choices to avoid economic ruin: • Use more coal further polluting the environment; • Convert forests into fuel permanently altering life sustaining ecosystems; • Go to war over foreign oil; • Establish energy farms to grow biomass fuels. Farming only 6% of continental U.S. acreage with biomass would provide all of America's gas and oil energy needs ending dependence upon petro-fuels. Manahan, Stanley E., Environmental Chemistry, 4th edition. Hemp is Earth’s #1 bio¬ mass resource; it is capa¬ ble of producing 10 tons per acre in four months. Hemp is easy on the soil,* sheds its lush foliage throughout the season, adding mulch to the soil and helping retain mois¬ ture. Hemp is an ideal crop for the semi-arid west and open range land. • Adam Beatty, vice president of the Kentucky Agricultural Society, reported instances of good crops of hemp on the same ground for 14 years in a row without a decline in yield. Beatty, A., “Southern Agriculture,” C.M. Saxton & Co., NY; 1843, pg. 113. USDA Yearbook, 1913. Hemp is the only biomass source available that is capable of making the U.S. energy indepen¬ dent. Ultimately, the world has no other ratio¬ nal environmental choice but to give up fossil fuels. SO, WHAT’S THE CATCH? The “catch” is obvious: The energy companies! They own most of the petro-chemicals, pharmaceutical, liquor, and tobacco companies, and are intertwined with insurance companies and banks. According to the press, many politicians now in power, are bought and paid for by the energy com¬ panies, and their U.S. government arm is the CIA—“The Company”— (Robert Ludlum, etc.). The Bush/Quayle administration is uniquely tied to oil, newspapers, pharmaceuticals—and the CIA. The world struggle for money is actually a struggle for energy, as it is through energy that we may pro¬ duce food, shelter, transportation aid entertainment. It is this struggle which often erupts into open war. If we remove the cause, these conflicts may never occur. (Carl Sagan; and U.S. EPA prediction, 1983, of world-wide disaster in the making within 30 to 50 years.) ENERGY SECURITY If introduced to Third World nations, hemp biomass could drastically cut our overseas aid and reasons for war, while raising the quality of life there by quantum leaps. New, non-polluting in¬ dustries will spring up everywhere. The world economy will boom like never before. The race of man would at last be bet¬ ting on environmental survival instead of in¬ dulging in the lemming¬ like consumption of fossil fuel, which threatens all life on the planet. FREE ENTERPRISE & HIGH PROFIT There are many other areas of the economy that would benefit from end¬ ing hemp prohibition and the resulting stimulation of commerce in re-discov¬ ered hemp products, ac¬ cording to the non-profit Business Alliance for Commerce in Hemp (BACH). Legal hemp would re¬ turn billions of dollars worth of natural resource potential back to the farm¬ ers and bring millions of good jobs in energy produc¬ tion to America’s heartland. Hemp energy farmers will become our producers of raw materials for many of the nation's needs. World War U: E THE MOST RECENT TI AMERICA ASKED ITS FARMERS TO GROW MORE MARI JUANA Our national energy needs are an undeniable na¬ tional security priority. Look what Uncle Sam can do when pushed into action: In 1942 Japan cut off our supplies of vital hemp and coarse fibers. Marijuana, which had been out¬ lawed as the ‘Assassin of Youth’ just four years ear¬ lier was suddenly safe enough for our government to ask the kids in the Kentucky 4-H club to grow the nation’s 1943 seed supply. The youths were urged to grow at least half an acre but preferably two acres of hemp each. (U. of KY Ag. Extension Leaflet 25, Mar., 1943) In 1942-43 farmers were made to attend show¬ ings of the USDA film ‘Hemp for Victory ,’ sign that they had seen the film and read a hemp cultivation booklet. Hemp harvesting machinery was made available at low or no cost. Five dollar tax stamps were available and 350,000 acres of cultivated hemp was the goal by 1943, (See transcript p. 104.) Farmers from 1942 through 1945 who agreed to grow hemp were waived from serving in the mili¬ tary, along with their sons; that’s how vitally im¬ portant hemp was to America during World War II. — 45 —"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Family farms will be saved. Crops can be tailored to the needs of the nation. Hemp can be grown for BDF (biomass derived fuels) resources at about $30 per ton. Hempseed crops will again supply the paint and varnish industries with an organic alternative to petrochemicals. Hempseed oil has chemical proper¬ ties similar to linseed oil. And the market is wide open for highly nutritious and delicious foods made from hemp seed and its health giving essential fatty acids and proteins. Hemp grown for fiber will bring the paper and tex¬ tile industry out of the hands of the multinational corporations, and back to the local communities. Research by this Los Angeles based business associ¬ ation indicates there are around 50,000 non-smoking commercial uses for hemp that are economically vi¬ able and market competitive. These include: A CHANGE IN HIGH FASHION The arrival of imported hemp-cotton blended cloth¬ ing from China* in 1989 marked the beginning of a new era for the rapidly changing world of fashion. And now the Chinese and Hungarians have many different 100% hemp fabrics available. * Joint Venture Hempery and Hemp Colony import blended hemp/cotton shirts and shorts. House of Hemp imports 100% hemp fabrics. These hemp clothes and fabrics can be found at a number of retail outlets or ordered by using the forms in the back of this book. Drawing on hemp fiber’s special attributes —absorbency, insulation and strength—clothing manufacturers and designers will once again put hemp into linen to produce new lines of durable and attractive clothing and textiles. Outerwear, warm bed sheets, soft towels (hemp is more water absorbent than cotton), diapers (even dis¬ posable ones that you don’t have to cut down trees to make), upholstery, wall coverings, natural rugs—all these can now be designed and made from 100% hemp: generally better, cheaper and ecologically safer. Trade barriers and laws restricting the use of im¬ ported cannabis fibers need to be removed. Right now textiles and apparel are the biggest share of imports into the U.S., at 59%. In 1989 textile imports accounted for 21% of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit. Foreign governments often subsidize their textile industries and do not require companies to follow environmental and health regulations.* Hardy hemp does not cause the environmental prob¬ lems associated with cotton. *The Washington Spectator, Vol. 17, No. 4, Feb. 15,1991 The United States imports more textiles than any¬ thing else, yet the government obstructs hemp textile and apparel importation. Hemp textiles will not be fully cost competitive until hemp fiber can be grown and processed domestically, to avoid bloated federal import fees and lower the costs of transporta¬ tion. STURDY PAPER PRODUCTS The devastated environments and job markets of the American Northwest and other timber regions stand to make a dramatic comeback once hemp is re¬ introduced to the domestic paper industry. Recent studies indicate that depletion of the ozone layer threatens to substantially reduce world loblolly pine production (the major source of pulp for pa¬ per)—by up to 30% or even 50%, depending on the fluctuation of the density of the ozone shield. But hemp not only resists the damage caused by in¬ creased ultraviolet radiation —it actually flourishes in it. * Increased UV radiation causes hemp to produce more glandular oils and increases the weight of the plant. (Teramura, Alan, University of MD study, Discover magazine, September, 1989.) Paper mills can return to full production levels and loggers will find new work in hemp trades. Truck drivers can continue to haul pulp to the mills, and lumber for construction, although the price of lumber will go down as other demands on our tim¬ ber resources are reduced by substituting farm- grown hemp for forest-grown wood pulp. (Oregon Hemp Products Inc., Jim Evans, Ashland, Oregon.) There will also still be a lot of work to do in re¬ forestation. Our rivers will go through a period of re¬ covery when hemp replaces wood pulp in the paper industry resulting in a 60-80% reduction of paper ma k ing chemicals being dumped into them. This means more fish and more fishing, as well as increased camping and tourism in the beautiful and vital new-growth forest regions—and the spared old- growth forests. A BIODEGRADABLE REPLACEMENT FOR PLASTIC Hemp paper is stronger and has greater folding en¬ durance than wood pulp paper.* Hemp cardboard and paper bags will last longer with more usefulness than similar products made from wood pulp or plas¬ tic. * Dewey & Merrill, Bulletin #404, U.S. Dept, of Ag., 1916. Hemp is also the most efficient source of cellulose, the first organic polymer to be investigated for mak¬ ing plastics including cellophane, celluloid and rayon, or chemically engineered into a multitude of plastic items. — 46 —"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Cellulose is a biodegradable organic polymer. Coal tar, the primary resource for synthetic polymers like nylon is a non-biodegradable fossil resource. It is not part of the living ecology of Earth. It smothers life wherever it is dumped or spilled. SPIN-OFF TRADES & TAXES Biochemical resources obtained from hemp can be used for literally tens of thousands of other uses from paints to dynamite. Each application means new business opportunities and new jobs for the flagging U.S. economy. As each new hemp trade develops, money will flow from it to re-energize seemingly unrelated areas of the economy. The American worker and soon-to- be-rich entrepreneurs will bring millions of new jobs and new products to the marketplace. They will also buy thousands of homes, cars and other non-hemp goods, thus stimulating a real economic expansion based on the ripple ef¬ fect, rather than trickle-down economics—pumping money directly into the bloodstream of the American heartland and ben¬ efiting all of society. Revived farms mean more purchases of equip¬ ment and each new business creates spin-off jobs in the shipping, marketing and commodities areas. Farms, banks and investment houses would also realize large profits, and the billions of hemp-dol- lars in the legitimate economy would increase tax revenues and increase the liquid capital available for investment and purchasing of consumer goods. Federal, state and local governments would real¬ ize a windfall of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues without raising taxes.* * “If the marijuana, cocaine and heroin markets were legal, state and federal governments would collect bil¬ lions of dollars annually,\" assistant professor of politics at Princeton University, Ethan Nadleman said. “Instead, they expend billions in what amounts to a subsidy of organized criminals.” (L.A. Times, November 20, 1989, pg. A-18.) GREEN ECONOMY When American farmers grow hemp to sup ply American industries with the primary feedstocks for fiber, fabric, fuel, food, medicines, plastics and recreational/relaxational herbal products we will see a rapid greening of the land and economy. The green economy based upon the use of agricul¬ ture resources to supply industry will create a diver¬ sified locally based system of production. This decen¬ tralized green economy will enable everyone to par¬ ticipate and share in the wealth of a truly free mar¬ ket democracy. For there can be no true democracy unless every citizen has the opportunity to share in the wealth of the nation. LAND & SOIL RECLAMATION Land reclamation is another compelling economic and ecological argument for hemp cultivation. Until this century, our pioneers and ordinary American farmers used cannabis to clear fields for planting, as a fallow year crop, and after forest fires to prevent mud slides and loss of watershed. Hemp seeds put down a 10- to 12-inch root in only 30 days, compared to the one-inch root put down by the rye or barley grass presently used by the U.S. Government. Southern California, Utah and other states used cannabis routinely in this manner until about 1915. It also breaks up compacted, overworked soil. In the formerly lush Himalaya region of Bangladesh, Nepal and Tibet there is now only a light moss covering left as flash floods wash thousand of tons of topsoil away. In 1964, Bangladesh (from bhang-cannabis, la-land, desh-people) signed an ‘anti-drug’ agreement with the U.S. not to grow hemp. Since that time the ‘marijuana-land-people’ have suffered disease, starvation and deci¬ mation, due to unrestrained flooding. Hemp seeds broadcast over eroding soil could reclaim land the world over. The farmed out desert regions can be brought back year after year, not only slowing the genocide of starvation but easing threats of war and violent revolution. NATURAL GUARD Instead of a National Guard, why not establish a Natural Guard of environmental sol¬ diers to be our front line for ' survival—planting trees, harvest¬ ing biomass (eg., hemp) from marginal farm lands? A Natural Guard of electricians, plumbers, engi¬ neers and laborers who work re-building the infra¬ structure of America: our roads, bridges, dams, canals, sewers, railroad tracks, etc. Isn’t this the humane, civilized and socially respon¬ sible way to use our human resources, rather than warehousing people like animals in prisons? — 47 —"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"xm(r FROM THE GROUND UP HENERY FORD’S BIOMASS CAR Henry Ford and the hemp fueled and fabricated car he “grew from the soil” are shown in this photo with the original caption as appeared in Popular Mechanics, Dec., 1941.

Hemp is ideal for pyrolytic conversion into all the prod¬ ucts illustrated in the center of the chart. The same basic thermochemical decomposition process is used to refine both biomass and fossil fuels. Municipal and agri¬ cultural wastes are also suitable for this process, and as a supplemental resource can supply up to ten percent of our energy needs. High moisture herba¬ ceous plants, such as sugar cane and corn, are best suited for biochemical digestion. The resulting fermented alcohols are valuable chemical feed¬ stocks. Bacterial digestion can also produce methane rich biogas, an excellent boiler fuel. J^Oiburn Biomass derived fuels can provide all U.S. energy needs currently supplied by fossil fuels. America has consumed 80% of her known oil and gas reserves.

Cannabis hemp is part of our heritage and was the backbone of our most stable and longest surviving cultures. Recent psycho-pharmacological studies have discovered THC has its own unique receptor sites in the brain, indicating man and marijuana have a pre-cultural relationship — indeed, human culture could very well prove to be the blossom of our symbiosis with cannabis. (See Appendix pages 144-145) WHAT’S IN A NAME (PART 2) The following is derived from the 1913 U.S.D.A. Agriculture Yearbook section on hemp by Lyster Dewey, p. 283- 293: The name “hemp,” derived from the Old English “hanf,” came into use in Middle English by 1,000 AD. and still belongs primarily to cannabis sativa. It is also used to designate the long fiber obtained from that plant: the earliest, best-known and, until recent¬ ly, the most widely used textile fiber on Earth. It has long been regarded as the standard among long fibers. As such, its name has come to be used as a generic term for all long fibers. Now commodity markets list names like “Manila hemp,” abaca; “sisal hemp,” sisal and henequen; “Mauritius hemp,” for Furcraea fiber, “New Zealand hemp,” phormium; “Sunn hemp,” Crotalaria; and “India hemp,” for jute. All these plants are unlike true hemp in appearance and in economic properties. Curiously, the name is never applied to flax, which is more nearly like hemp than any other commercial fiber. True hemp is known in different languages by the following names: cannabis, Latin; chanvre, French; cahamo, Spanish; canhamo, Portuguese; canapa, Italian; canep, Albanian; konopli, Russian; konopi and penek, Polish; kemp, Belgian; hanf, German; hennup, Dutch; hamp, Swedish; hampa, Danish; kenevir, Bulgarian; ta-ma, si-ma and tse-ma, Chinese; asa, Japanese; nasha, Turkish; kanabira, Syrian; kannab, Arabic. FIRST KNOWN CANNABIS USERS Ancient and modem historians, archaeologists, an¬ thropologists, philologists and the physical evidence they cite (artifacts, relics, textiles, cuneiform, lan¬ guages, etc.) indicate that cannabis is one of mankind’s oldest cultivated crops. The weaving of hemp fiber as an industry began 10,000 years ago, at approximately the same time as pottery making and prior to metal working.* * Columbia History of the World, Harper & Row, NY, 1981. From at least the 27th century B.C. until this century, cannabis was incorporated into virtually all cultures of the Middle East, Asia Minor, India, China, Japan, Europe, & Afiica. By the 27th century B.C., the Chinese cultivated “Ma” (cannabis hemp) for fiber, medicine and herbal use. 3,700 years later (circa 1000 AD.), China called cannabis “Ta-Ma,” or “great hemp,” to differentiate it from the minor fiber plants, which were grouped un¬ der the generic fiber term “Ma.” Their pictogram for true hemp is a large “man,” indicating file strong re¬ lationship between man and hemp.

AND 1000 B.C.: Nomadic tribes, probably from central Asia and Persia (Iran and Iraq), and referred to in legend as Aryans, invaded and overran virtually everywhere in the Mediterranean and Middle East and over the Caucasus and west into Europe. In the course of these movements and invasions the nomads introduced cannabis and its various uses north and west through Greece, Europe, the Middle East, to Egypt (and possibly even Africa) and south and East “over” the Himalayas to India. 49 —"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Cannabis was incorporated into the cultures of the Middle East and India for its vast food, oil and fiber uses.

Cannabis was undoubtedly used by the Scythians for many reasons. For example, the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe. Cannabis inhala¬ tion by the Scythians in funeral rituals was recorded by the Greek Historian Herodotus (Circa 450 B.C.) in the early Sixth century B.C. The nomadic Scythians introduced the custom to other races such as the Thracians. (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Flesh of the Gods, Praeger Press, NY, 1974.) HAREM LADY IN HER TRADITIONAL POSE Circa 1876. THREAD OF CIVILIZATION From at least the 27th century B.C. up until this cen¬ tury, cannabis was incorporated into virtually all the cultures of the Middle East, Asia Minor, India, China, Japan, Europe, and Africa for its superior fiber, medicines, oils, food and for its meditative, eu¬ phoric, and relaxational uses. Hemp was one of our ancestors’ most important overall industries, along with toolmaking, animal husbandry and farming. HEMP TO ENFORCE THE LAW The hemp plant has had a curious relationship with the world’s legal codes throughout the ages. As noted before, it has variously been illegal to grow hemp and not to grow it at different times. But hemp has also played a direct role in law enforcement. For example: The most serious punishment/rehabil¬ itation meted out in many African tribes for capital crimes was forcing the transgressor to smoke mas¬ sive amounts of dagga (cannabis) non-stop for hours on end in a small, enclosed hut until he passes out—literally unconscious from inhaling the fumes. The equivalent of a year or two’s supply for a heavy American smoker is consumed in just an hour or so. Does it work? African users say the rate of repeat criminal offenses after dagga treatment is virtually non-existent. European and American cultures used hemp to en¬ force their laws in a more terminal form of capital punishment: the hangman’s noose* of hempen rope. * “Merry boys are we/As e’re did sing/ In a hempen string/ Under the gallows tree.” John Fletcher Rollo, Duke of Normandy, Act HI, sc. 3; 1639. “We’re bound to stop this business, or hang you to a man/ For we’ve hemp and hand enough in town to hang the whole damn clan.\" From a horse thief’s tombstone in Rapid City, SD, 1877: Shushan, E.R.; Grave Matters; Ballantine Books, NY, 1990.

CANNABIS HERBAL MEDICINES The secret art of hemp medicine was found effective as wound healer, muscle relaxant, pain reliever, fever reducer and unparalleled aid to childbirth, not to mention hundreds of other medicinal applications. (Mikuriya, Tbd H., M.D., Marijuana: Medical Papers, 1839-1972, Medi-Comp Press, Oakland, CA, 1973; Shultes, R.E., Harvard Botanical; Ency. Brittanica; Abel, Ernest, Marijuana: The First 12,000 Years;. Plenum Press, 1980; Vera Rubin, Cannabis and Culture, Institute for the Study of Man; et. al.) Division of information about this sacred herb and industrial hemp uses was strictly maintained by the priests for thousands of years, up until the last few centuries. Those outside the priestly class who pos¬ sessed drug knowledge were considered (by the priests, of course) to be witches/soothsayers/outlaws and the ilk, and were often condemned to death. — 50 —"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE MYSTIC PHILOSOPHERS Cannabis legend and consumption are fundamental aspects of many of the world’s great religions. For example: SHINTOISM (Japan)—Cannabis was used for the binding together of married couples, to drive away evil spirits, and was thought to create laughter and happiness in marriage. HINDUISM (India)—The God Shiva is said “to have brought cannabis from the Himalayas for hu¬ man enjoyment and enlightenment.” The Sardu Priests travel throughout India and the world shar¬ ing “chillum” pipes filled with cannabis, sometimes blended with other substances. In the Bhagavad-gita, Krishna states, “I am the healing herb” (Ch.9:16), while the Bhagarat-purana Fifth Canto describes hashish in explicitly sexual terms. BUDDHISTS (Tibet, India and China)—from the 5th century B.C. on—ritually used cannabis; initia¬ tion rites and mystical experiences were (are ) com¬ mon in many Chinese Buddhist Sects. Some Tibetan Buddhists and lamas (priests) consider cannabis their most holy plant. Many Buddhist traditions, writings, and belief indicate that “Siddhartha\" (the Buddha) himself, used and ate nothing but hemp and its seeds for six years prior to announcing (discover¬ ing) his truths and becoming the Buddha (Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path). Regarding the ZOROASTRIANS or Magi (Persia, c. Eighth to Seventh Centuries B.C. to Third to Fourth Centuries A.D.), it is widely believed by many Christian scholars, commentators, etc., that the three “Magi” or Wise Men who attended the birth of Christ were cult references to the Zoroastrians. The Zoroastrian religion was based (at least on the sur¬ face) on the entire cannabis plant, the chief religious sacrament of its priest class, and its most important medicine, (e.g., obstetrics, incense rites, anointing and christening oils), as well as lighting or fire oils in their secular world. The word “magic” is generally considered derived from the Zoroastrians—“Magi.” The ESSENES (ancient Israel) used hemp medici¬ nally, as did the THERAPUTEA (Egypt), from whom we get the term “therapeutic.” Both are believed by some scholars to be disciples of, or in a brotherhood with, the priests/magicians of the Zoroastrians. SUFIS OF ISLAM (Middle East) are Moslem “mys¬ tical” priests who have taught, used and extolled cannabis for divine revelation, insight and oneness with Allah, for at least the last 1,000 years. Many Moslem and world scholars believe the mysticism of the Sufi Priests was actually that of the Zoroastrians who survived Moslem conquests of the 7th and 8th Pygmy ingesting dagga/ marijuana smoke centuries A.D. and subsequent conversion (change your religion and give up liquor or be beheaded). Some COPTIC CHRISTIAN (Egypt/Ethiopia) sects believe the sacred “green herb of the field” in the Bible (“I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.” Ezekiel 34:29) and the Biblical secret incens¬ es, sweet incenses and anointing oils to be cannabis. The BANTUS (Africa) had secret Dagga Cults,* so¬ cieties which restricted cannabis use to the ruling men. The Pygmies, Zulus and Hottentots all found it an indispensable medication for cramps, epilepsy and gout, and as a religious sacrament. ♦ Their “Dagga” cults believed Holy Cannabis was brought to earth by the Gods, in particular from the “Two Dog Star” system that we call Sirius A and B. “Dagga” literally means “cannabis.\" Interestingly, the surviving Indo-European word for the plant can also be read as “canna,” “reed” and “bi,” “two,” as well as ‘canna,’ as in canine; and ‘bis,’ meaning two (bi)-“Two Dogs.” The RASTAFARIANS (Jamaica and elsewhere) are a contemporary religious sect that uses “ganja” as its sacred sacrament to communicate with God (Jah). “NATURAL MIND” New United States government funded studies at St. Louis Medical University in 1989 and the Nation¬ al Institute of Mental Health in 1990 moved cannabis research into a new realm by confirming the human brain has receptor sites for in the bra in for THC and its natural cannabis cousins which, so far, no other known compounds will bind to. In order for a chemical to affect the brain it must 51"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"bind to a receptor site ca¬ pable of receiving it. (Omni, Aug., 1989, pg.144-145; Wash. Post, Aug. 9,1990.) Although morphine fits the receptor sites of beta- endorphin roughly, and amphetamines corre¬ spond loosely to dopa¬ mine, these drugs as well as tricyclics and other mood altering drugs pre¬ sent grave danger to the subtle balance of the nerve’s vital fluids. Obviously Omni and the NY Times cited no physi¬ cal dangers in natural cannabis. One reason cannabis is so safe to use is that it does not affect any of the involuntary muscles of breathing and life sup¬ port. Rather, it affects its own specific receptor cites for motion (movement strategy) and memory (mental strategies). On the molecular level THC fits into receptor sites in the upper brain that seem to be uniquely designed to accomodate THC. This points to an ancient sym¬ biosis between the plant and people. Perhaps these neuronal pathways are the product of pre-cultural relationship between man and cannabis.' Carl Sagan proposes evidence using the Bushmen of Africa to show hemp to have been the first plant cultivated by man dating to when he was a hunter-gatherer. Some scientists assume that these receptor sites did not evolve for the purpose of get¬ ting high: “There must be some kind of neuronal pathway in the brain that developed, whether there were cannabis plants or not,” speculated mystified St. Louis University pharmacology professor Allyn Howlett in 1989. But, maybe not. In his book Intoxication: Life in Pursuit of Artificial Paradise, Dr. Ronald K Siegel, psycho-pharmacologist at UCLA indicates the moti¬ vation to achieve altered states of consciousness or moods is a fourth drive akin to hunger, thirst and sex. And humans aren’t the only ones to get high. Siegel recorded numerous observations of animals in¬ tentionally getting intoxicated. Cannabis hemp is part of our cultural, spiritual and physiological heritage, and was the backbone of our most stable and long surviving cultures. So, if you — 52 want to know the long term effects of mari¬ juana use...look in the mirror! CLOAKED IN SECRECY The dawn of religious beliefs for all races and people—Japan, China, India, Egypt, Persia and Babylon, to Greek, Doric, Germanic and European tribes, and even those of Africa and North, South and Cen¬ tral America—derived from accidental discov¬ eries. There were near¬ death experiences, de¬ privations— starvation, fasting, breath control, thirst, fever—and un¬ controlled revelry due to accidental fermentation or extraction of wine, beer, psilocybe and Amanita mushrooms, cannabis wine (Bhang) and other psychoactives which, when con¬ sumed, induced inexplicable, elevated experiences (compared to normal brutish experience). Chemicals in these sacred plants and herbs gave our ancestors unexpected, unprepared for, unbelievable visions and journeys into the far comers of incredible conscious¬ ness and, sometimes, universal brotherhood. Understanding these drug-induced experiences and medications eventually became the most wondrous, desirable and necessary spiritual knowledge for each tribe. Healing! From which extraction? At what dose? Holding this mystical tribal knowledge for future generations was a priceless task. To know which plants induced which experiences at what level and mixture meant power! Thus, this “sacred store” of knowledge was jealously guarded by the herbal doctor/priest, and cryptically encoded in oral and written traditions and myths (e.g., plants with psychoactive powers were embued with human or animal attributes). To keep their political power, these traditions were deliberately withheld from the “common” tribal mem¬ bers (and all other tribes), by the witch doctors and medicine men of the priest/ shaman classes. This also prevented the dangerous “sin” of accidental inges¬ tion, concoction, or experimentation by the children of the tribe; nor could captured tribal members give Reference to cannabis and other spiritual drug use is often hidden in art during periods of repression.

These “old-time” drug and out-of-body religions and rituals, dating back to pre-history, were called “Oriental Mystery Religions” by the Romans from the Caesars’ time on. JUDAIC LINE Hemp was a major industry in biblical times. Like other cultures throughout the Middle East, the Hebrew tradition of mysticism (e.g., Cabala) was aware of, and entwined with, regional sects using nat¬ ural intoxicants in their rituals. As usual, they hid this knowledge behind rituals, symbols and secret codes to protect natural sacraments like “sacred mushrooms” and mind elevating herbs, including cannabis. Allegro, J.M.; Sacred Mushroom & the Cross, Doubleday Co., 1970. WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY? Finding the encoded references to cannabis and other drugs is made more difficult by the lack of botanical names, discrepancy in translations, use of different “books” by different denominations, commentaries added to original texts, and periodic priestly purges of material considered inappropriate. About 95% of the people were not allowed to learn Latin,- the language of the Bible, which effectively allowed those few priests who could read to inter¬ pret the scriptures as they pleased. However, we find that the use of cannabis is never forbidden or even discouraged in the Bible. Some pas¬ sages directly refer to the goodness of using herbs like cannabis—and it even predicted prohibition. “And the Earth brought forth grass and herb-yielding seed after its kind and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself after its kind: and God saw that it was good.” Genesis: Chapt. 1: Verse 12 (King James Version of the Bible, unless noted). “God makes the earth yield healing herbs, which the prudent man should not neglect.” Sirach: 38:4 (Cath¬ olic Bible.) “Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; That which cometh out of the mouth defileth a man.” Jesus, quoted: Matt. 15:11. “In later times, some shall...speak lies in hypocri¬ sy... commanding to abstain from that which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth ” Paul: 1 Tim. 1:4 EARLY CHRISTIANITY Historians, early artworks, Bibles, manuscripts, Dead Sea Scrolls, Gnostic Gospels, letters from early church fathers, etc., indicate that for the first 300 to 400 years A.D., many early Christian sects were gentle and loving. They were usually open, tolerant and un¬ structured: a poor man’s or slave’s religion. Rome considered Christianity to be simply another bothersome Oriental Mystery cult, like those of Mithra or Isis, then the most popular in the Empire. THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE Faced with a crumbling empire, political corruption and a series of ruinous wars with barbarians, the old Roman Empire hovered on the brink of disaster The religious contortions undertaken by the ruling body in Rome to maintain its earthly power led the political leaders to crack down on healthy diversity in the field of individual cults and religions. To save itself politically, the formerly pantheistic (meaning tolerant of different worships) government of the empire changed its policy. Starting in 249 A.D., various emperors launched a string of bloody persecutions, which included the trou¬ blesome Christians. By 306 A.D., it was clear that this was not working. Emperor Constantine called off the executions and began to patronize the Christian clergy, which promptly adopted a dogma lifted from “Mith- raism,” among other religions: \"Royal Blood by Birth,’ the \"Divine Right to Rule other humans.’ The ambitious Constantine saw that while under¬ ground, the church had developed into an intolerant, tightly-knit hierarchy; a well organized network sec¬ ond in influence only to his own. By combining church and state, each was able to double its power and seek out the crimes/sins of all its political rivals and ene¬ mies with the full support/blessing of the other. Columbia History of the World, Harper & Row, NY, 1981. Constantine soon converted to Christianity and de¬ clared one mandatory, monistic, state-empowered reli¬ gion: the Roman Catholic Church (R.C.Ch.); literally, the Roman Universal Church (“catholic” is latin for “universal”). This was now the absolute and official re¬ ligion of the empire. In one sweep, all secret societies were outlawed which might have threatened his (and Rome’s) mandate to rule the known world, as they had for the previous 400 consecutive years. CHURCH/STATE ARISTOCRACY After running from the Roman Empire’s police for al¬ most 300 years, Christian Orthodox priests had be¬ come their bosses. Starting in the Fourth and Fifth century A.D., pagan religions and all the different Christian sects, beliefs, knowledge, gospels, etc., such as the Essenes and Gnostics, were either incorporated into or edited out of official doctrine and hierarchy. 53 —"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Finally, in a series of councils, all contrary dogmas (e.g, that the earth was round, and the sun and stars were more than five to 17 miles away) were summarily outlawed and driven underground during the Dark Ages, 400 to 900 A.D. By the early Middle Ages, 10th and 11th centuries A.D., virtually all powers were placed in the hands of the Church and Pope; first, by Germanic conquerors and later by powerful Spanish and French Kings and powerful Italian merchants and nobles (the Borgias, Medicis and other megalomani¬ acs) probably to protect their trade secrets, alliances and sources of wealth. All European people were forced to ad¬ here to the “Holy” Roman Empire policy: Zero tolerance by a fundamentalist church/police-state with blind faith in one, unquestioned version of how to worship God...and the Pope’s infallibility. Political rulers aided and abetted the Church in this fraud, as their power now rested only on their new Christian dogma, the patriarchal “Divine right” to rule. They enacted laws with fantastically vi¬ cious punishments for even the slightest in¬ fraction or heresy.* Heretics were merci¬ lessly sought out by fanatical, sadistic in¬ quisitors using perverted forms of torture to extract confessions and as punishment. ♦ Webster’s dictionaiy defines “Her-e-sy (her'e se)” as 1: a religious belief that is opposed to church dogma. 2: any opinion (in philosophy, politics, etc.) opposed to official or established views or doctrines. 3: the holding of any such belief or opinion. This system kept most of the Western world's inhabi¬ tants in a state of constant terror, not only for their own physical safety and freedom, but also for their eternal spirit, with “Hell” lurking mere inches below the surface for those excommunicated by the church. THE POLITICS OF PAPER The masses of people, “the commons,” were kept in check through a dual system of fear and enforced igno¬ rance. All learning except the most rudimentary was controlled and strictly regulated by the priests. The commons (about 95% of the people) were forbid¬ den to learn to read or write—not even an alphabet —and often were punished or put to death for doing so. The people were also forbidden to learn Latin, the language of the Bible. This effectively enabled the few priests who could read to interpret the scriptures any way they pleased for about 1200 years, until the refor¬ mation in Europe. To prohibit knowledge, people were literally kept in the dark, without a piece of paper to write on. The monasteries preserved and guarded hemp’s secrets. They saw that it held two threats to this policy of abso¬ lute control: papermaking and lamp oil. Something had to be done. CANNABIS MEDICINES FORBIDDEN While embracing wine as a Sacrament, and tolerat¬ ing beer and hard liquor, the Inquisition outlawed cannabis ingestion in Spain in the 12th century, and France in the 13th. Many other natural remedies were simultaneously banned. Anyone using hemp to com¬ municate, heal or otherwise was la¬ belled “witch.” Saint Joan of Arc, for example, was accused in 1430-31 of using a variety of herbal “witch” drugs, in¬ cluding cannabis, to hear voices. LEGAL MEDICINES CONSISTED OF: Virtually the only legal medical cures allowed the people of Western Europe by the R.C.Ch. Fathers at this time were: 1. Wearing a bird mask (for plague). (See picture.) 2. Bleeding pints and even quarts of blood from all flu, pneumonia or fever patients (victims) was the most used treatment in Europe and America by doctors until this century. It does not work! and did not work for thousands of years (no matter how much blood they took). 3. Praying to specific Saints for a miraculous cure (e.g. St. Anthony for ergotism, St. Odilla for blindness, St. Benedict for poison sufferers, St. Vitus for comedi¬ ans and epileptics) was encouraged. 4. Alcohol was legal. In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII singled out cannabis healers and other herbalists, proclaiming hemp an un¬ holy sacrament of the second and third types of satanic mass. This persecution lasted for more than 150 years. Satanic knowledge and masses, according to the Medieval Church, came in three types: • lb Summon or Worship Satan; • To Have Witch’s Knowledge (e.g., herbalists or chemists) of making, using or giving others any unguent or preparation—including cannabis—as med¬ icine or as a spiritual sacrament; • The Mass of the Travesty, which can be likened to the Simpsons, In Living Color, rap music, Mel Brooks, Second City-TV, Monty Python, or Saturday Night Live (Father Guido Sarducci-type group) doing irreverent, farcical or satirical take-offs on the dogmas, Bird Mask filled with herbs to fend off plague. — 54 —"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"doctrines, indulgences, and rituals of the R.C.Ch. mass and/or its absolute beliefs. Because medieval priest bureaucrats thought they were sometimes laughed at, ridiculed and scorned by those under its influence—often by the most learned monks, clerics and leading citizens—ingesting cannabis was proclaimed heretical and Satanic. CONTRADICTIONS Despite this centuries-long attack by the most power¬ ful political and religious force in Western civilization, hemp cultivation continued in Northern Europe, Africa and Asia. While the church persecuted cannabis users in Europe, the Spanish conquistadors were busy planting hemp everywhere around the world to pro¬ vide sails, rope, oakum, clothes, etc. YET, HEMP ENDURED The sadistic Ottoman Empire conquered Egypt and, in the 14th century A.D., tried to outlaw cannabis—be¬ cause Egyptian hemp growers along the Nile were leading tax revolts. The Turks complained that cannabis use caused Egyptians to laugh and be disre¬ spectful to their Sultan and his representatives. In 1868, Egypt became the first modem(?) country to out¬ law cannabis ingestion, followed in 1910 by South Africa to punish and stop the blacks practicing their anciept Dagga cults and religions. In Europe, hemp was widely used both industrially and medicinally, from the Black Sea (Crimean) to the British Isles, especially in Eastern Europe. The papal ban on cannabis medicines in the Holy Roman Empire in 1484 was quite unenforcable north of the Alps, and to this day the Romanians, Czechs and Hungarians dominate world cannabis agronomy. In Ireland, already world famous for its cannabis linen, the Irish woman who wanted to know whom she would eventually marry was advised to seek revelation through cannabis. Eventually, the hemp trades once again became so important to the empire builders who followed (in the Age of Discovery/Reason, the 14th to 18th centuries) that they were central to the intrigues and maneuver- ings of all the World’s great powers. THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT The 18th century ushered in a new era of human thought and civilization; “Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness!” declared the colonists in America. “Lib¬ erty, Fraternity, Equality!” replied their French cousins. The concepts of modem constitutional govern¬ ment, guaranteed human rights and separation of church and state were unified into a policy designed to protect citizens from intolerant and arbitrary laws. ECONOMICS: THE VERY MODEL OF A MODERN INQUISITION For cannabis-related knowledge, or hundreds of other “sins”—owning a devil’s tool (dinner fork), reading a sorcerer’s book or speaking in tongues (foreign language), having a different faith, having the witch’s habit (taking a bath or falling into a riv¬ er), etc.—10% to 33% of the people in Western Europe were tortured or put to death without trial during the medieval Roman Catholic Church’s 500- year Inquisition. (11th to 17th centuries.) While most suffered, some profited handsomely. The Pope could declare anything “heresy,” and use it as an excuse to legally rob, torture and kill his ene¬ mies or anyone else accused. For over 300 years, in¬ quisitors divided up the property forfeited to them by suspected witches and heretics. Whoever denounced you got 1/3 of your property, 1/3 went to the govern¬ ment and 1/3 went to the Papal hierarchy.* “Beware the scribes which...devour widows’ hous¬ es.” Jesus, quoted: Luke 20:46 This perverted prosecution-for-profit model is used today by state and federal drug warriors just as self- righteously. Everyone from informant to the prosecu¬ tor now share in the bounty of forfeited goods. In fact, while British common law is the basis for our modem legal system, forfeiture law relies on the medieval concept of the cursed object—“deodand” (from the latin “deo,” god and “dare,” give; meaning that any object causing human death was forfeited to the crown)—is the basis for seizure and confisca¬ tion of property rather against persons. Why? Simple. People have guaranteed legal rights: property doesn’t. In his landmark essay, On Liberty, Ogden Livingston Mills, whose philosophy shaped our democracy, wrote that “Human liberty comprises, first, the inward do¬ main of consciousness in the most comprehensive sense: liberty of thought and feeling, ...scientific, moral or theological, ...liberty of tastes and pursuits.” Mills asserted that this freedom of thought or of “mind” is the basis for all freedoms. Gentleman farmer Thomas Jefferson’s immortal words, “I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man,” are engraved into the marble of his Memorial in Washington D.C. Abraham Lincoln was an avowed enemy of prohibi¬ tion. His wife was prescribed cannabis for her nerves after his assassination. Virtually every president from the mid-19th century up until prohibition routinely used cannabis medicines (See chapter 12: Nineteenth 55 —"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"JEFFERSON’S COMPARISON Thomas Jefferson wrote and acted on behalf of hemp many times, smuggling rare seeds into America, redesigning the hemp brake, keeping his farm journals and writing this on March 16,1791: “The culture {of tobacco} is pernicious.

Of course, it requires much manure, therefore other productions are de¬ prived of manure, yielding no nourishment for cat¬ tle, there is no return for the manure expended.... “It is impolitic. The fact well established in the system of agriculture is that the best hemp and the best tobacco grow on the same kind of soil. The for¬ mer article is of first necessity to the commerce and marine, in other words to the wealth and protection of the country. The latter, never useful and some- times pernicious, derives its estimation from caprice, and its value from the taxes to which it was formerly exposed. The preference to be given will re¬ sult from a comparison of them: Hemp employs in its rudest state more labor than tobacco, but being a material for manufactures of various sorts, becomes afterwards the. means of support to numbers of peo¬ ple, hence it is to be preferred in a populous country. “America imports hemp and will continue to do so, and also sundry articles made of hemp, such as cordage, sail cloth, drilling linnen and stockings...” century use). More recently, close acquaintances and entertainer associates of John Kennedy say he used cannabis regu¬ larly to control his back pain and actually planned on legalizing “marijuana” during his second term—a plan cut short by his assassination in 1963. “How Heads of State Got High,” High Times, April, 1980 (see appendix). More recently, former president Gerald Ford’s son and Jimmy Carter’s son Chip admit to having smoked pot in the White House.

Russia, because of its cheap slave/serf labor, produces 80% of the western world’s cannabis hemp, finished hemp products, and is, by far, the world’s best-quality manufacturer of cannabis hemp for sails, rope, rigging and nets. Cannabis is Russia’s number one trad¬ ing commodity—ahead of its furs, timber and iron. 1740 to 1807 Great Britain buys 90% or more of its ma¬ rine hemp from Russia; Britain’s navy and world sea trade runs on Russian hemp; each British ship must replace 50 to 100 tons of hemp every year or two. There is no substitute; flax sails, for example, un¬ like hemp sails, would start rotting in three months or less from salt air and spray. 1 1793 to 1799 on...

Britain ac¬ complishes the blockade of France by closing their (France’s) English Channel and Atlantic (Bay of Biscay) ports with its navy; also, Britain controls ab¬ solute access to and from the Mediterranean and Atlantic, by virtue of its control of the straits of Gibraltar.

Napoleon’s strategy—and his most important goal with the treaty—is to stop Russian hemp from reach¬ ing England, thereby destroying Britain’s navy by forcing it to cannibalize sails, ropes, and rigging from other ships; and Napoleon believes that eventually, with no Russian hemp for its huge navy, Britain will be forced to end its blockade of France and the Continent. 1807 to 1809 The United States is considered a neutral country by Napoleon, as long as its ships do not trade with or for Great Britain, and the United States considers it¬ self to be neutral in the war between France and Great Britain. However, Congress passes the 1806 Non-Importa¬ tion Pact: British articles which are produced in the U.S., but which could be produced elsewhere, are prohibited. Congress also passes the 1807 Embargo Act, to wit: American ships could not bring or carry products to or from Europe. These laws hurt America more than Europe; how¬ ever, many Yankee traders ignored the law anyway. 1807 to 1814 After the Treaty of Tilset cuts off their Russian trade, Britain claims that there are no neutral coun¬ tries or shipping lanes. Hence, any ship that trades with Napoleon’s “Continental System” of allies are the enemy and are subject to blockade. On this pretext, Britain confiscates American ships and cargo and sends sailors back to the United States at American ship owners’ expense. Britain “impresses” some American sailors into ser¬ vice in the British Navy. However, England claims that they only “impress” those sailors who are British subjects—and whose American shipping companies refused to pay for the sailors’ return fares. 1807 to 1810. Secretly, however, Britain offers the captured American traders a “deal” (actually a blackmail proposition) when they “overhaul”—board and confis¬ cate—an American ship and bring it into an English port. The deal: Either lose your ship and cargos forever, or go to Russia and secretly buy hemp for Britain, who will pay American traders with gold in advance, and more gold when the hemp is delivered back. At the same time, the Americans will be allowed to keep and trade their own goods (rum, sugar, spices, cotton, coffee, tobacco) to the Czar for hemp —a dou¬ ble profit for the Americans. 1808 to 1810. Our shrewd Yankee traders, faced with the choice of either running British blockades—and risking having their ships, cargo and crews confiscated—or acting as secret (illegal) licensees for Britain, with safety and profits guaranteed, mostly choose the lat¬ ter. John Quincy Adams (later to become president), who was American Consul at St. Petersburg, in 1809 noted: “As many as 600 clipper ships, flying the American flag, in a two week period, were in Kronstadt” (the Port of St. Petersburg, once called Leningrad in the former U.S.S.R.) loading principally cannabis hemp for England (illegally) and America, where quality hemp is also in great demand. (Bemis, John Q. Adams and the American Foreign Policy, New York, NY, Alfred A Knopf, 1949.) The United States passes the 1809 Non-Intercourse Act which resumes legal trade with Europe, except Britain and France. It is soon replaced with the Macon Bill resuming all legal trade. 1808 to 1810.

Britain also blockades all U.S. traders from Russia at the Baltic Sea and insists that American traders have to now secretly buy other strategic goods for them (mostly from Mediterranean ports), specifically from Napoleon and his allies on the Continent who by this time are happy to sell anything to raise capi¬ tal. 59"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"TIME: 1812 The United States, cut off from 80% of its Russian hemp supply, debates war in Congress. 3 Ironically, it is representatives of the Western states who argue for war under the excuse of “Impressed” American sailors. However, the repre¬ sentatives of the Maritime States, fearful of loss of trade, argue against war, even though it’s their ship¬ ping, crews, and states that are allegedly afflicted. Not one senator from a Maritime State votes for war with Great Britain, whereas virtually all Western senators vote for war, hoping to take Canada from Britain and fulfill their dream of “mani¬ fest destiny,” in the mistaken belief that Great Britain is too busy with the European wars against Napoleon to protect Canada. It’s interesting to note that Kentucky, a big support¬ er of the war which disrupted the overseas hemp trade, was actively building up its own domestic hemp industry. At this time, 1812, American ships could pick up hemp from Russia and return with it three times faster than shippers could get hemp from Kentucky to the East coast over land—at least, until the Erie Canal was completed in 1825. (See map.) The Western states win in Congress, and on June 18,1812, the United States is at war with Britain. America enters the war on the side of Napoleon, who marches on Moscow in June of 1812. Napoleon is soon defeated in Russia by the harsh winter, the Russian scorched-earth policy, 2,000 miles of snowy and muddy supply lines—and by Napoleon not stopping for the winter and regrouping before marching on Moscow, as was the original bat¬ tle plan. Of the 450,000 to 600,000 men Napoleon starts with, only 180,000 ever make it back. 1812 to 1814 Britain, after initial success in war with the United States (including the burning of Washington in retal¬ iation for the earlier American burning of Toronto, then the colonial Canadian capitol), finds its finances and military stretched thin—with blockades, war in Spain with France, and a tough new America on the seas. Britain agrees to peace, and signs a treaty with the United States in December, 1814. The actual terms of the treaty give little to either side. In effect, Britain agrees it will never again interfere with American shipping. > And the United States agrees to give up all claims to Canada forever (which we did, with the exception of “54-40 or Fight”). 1813 to 1814 Britain defeats Napoleon in Spain and banishes him to Elba, but he escapes for 100 days. 1815 Britain defeats Napoleon at Waterloo (June 18) and banishes him to St. Helena Island off Antarctica where, in 1821, he dies and his hairs and private parts are sold to the public for souvenirs. January 1815 Tragically for Britain, more than two weeks after the December 24, 1814 signing of the Ghent peace treaty between the United States and Britain, Andrew Jackson defeats a huge British attack force at New Orleans (January 8, 1815) while news of the treaty slowly makes its way across the Atlantic. 20th Century American, British, French, Canadian and Russian schools each teach children their own, completely dif¬ ferent versions of history, with virtually no mention of hemp in this war—or at any other time in history —in the American versions.

However, the 19th Century saw a dramatic re-discovery of the benefits of cannabis drugs, which grew in popularity across the U.S., bringing with it healthful elixirs and patent medicines, luxuriant Turkish Smoking Parlors and a fountain of literary creativity. MARIJUANA MEDICINE IN 19TH CENTURY AMERICA From 1850 to 1937, cannabis was used as the prime medicine for more than 100 separate illnesses or diseases in U.S. pharmacopoeia. During all this time (until the 1940’s), science, doctors, and drug manufac turers (Lilly, Parke-Davis, Squibb, etc.) had no idea of its active ingre¬ dients. Yet from 1842 until the 1890s, marijuana, generally called Can¬ nabis Indica or Indian Hemp ex- tractums, was one of the three liu* items (after alcohol and opium) most used in patent and prescrip¬ tion drugs (in massive* doses, usually by oral ingestion). ojv; t * Doses given during the 19th century to American infants, children, youth, adults, women in child birth, and senior citizens, in one day, were, in many cases, equal to what a current moderate-to-heavy American marijuana user proba¬ bly consumes in a month or two, using U.S. government’s 1983 guidelines for comparison. Violence was equated with alcohol use; addiction to morphine was known as the “soldiers’ illness.” And so, during that era, cannabis gained favor and was even recommended as a way of helping alco¬ holics and addicts recover. However, cannabis medicines had been largely lost to the West since the days of the Inquisition. (See chapter 10, “Sociology.”) Until, that is, W.B. O’Shaugnessy, a 30 year old British physician serving in India's Bengal* province, watched Indian doctors use different hemp extracts successfully to treat all types of illness and disease then untreatable in the West, including tetanus. * Bengal\" means \"Bhang Land,\" literally Cannabis Land. He then did an enormous (and the first Western) study,* in 1839, and pub¬ lished a 40-page paper on the uses of J cannabis medicines. At the same time, a French doctor named Roche was making the same re¬ discovery of hemp in Middle Eastern medicines. Papers written by users and doctors using cannabis told straight forward accounts of ■ -> >i( \\_ its usually euphoric, and j sometimes disphoric, mind- and time¬ expanding properties, as well as hilarity and increased appetites. * O’Shaugnessy used patients, animals, and himself for his re¬ search and experiments. Incidentally, O’Shaugnessy went on to be¬ come a millionaire and was knighted by Queen Victoria for building India’s first telegraph system in the 1850s. O’Shaugnessy’s medical paper and findings on hemp extracts stunned and swept through the Western medical world; in just three years...mari¬ juana was an American and European Super Duper Superstar.

Interestingly, during this whole period of time (1840s to 1930s) Lilly, Squibb, Parke Davis, Smith Brothers, Tildens, etc., had no effective way to pro¬ long its very short shelf life and had great difficulty standardizing dosages. Some temperance organizations even suggest hasheesh as a substitute for (wife beating) “Demon” alcohol As noted before, marijuana medicine was so highly regarded by Americans (including some Protestant theologians) during the last century that in 1860, for example, the Committee on Cannabis Indica for the Ohio State Medical Society reported and concluded that, “High Biblical commentators [scholars!” believe “that the gall and vinegar, or myrrhed wine, offered to our Saviour, immediately before his crucifixion, was in all probability, a preparation of Indian hemp [marijuana], and even speak of its earlier use in ob¬ stetrics.”* * * Reprinted from the transcripts of the 15th annual meeting of the Ohio State Medical Society, at White Sulphur Springs, Ohio, June 12-14, 1860, pg. 75-100. The main reasons that cannabis medicines fell into disuse in America was the difficulty of identifying and standardizing dosage. Also, doctors in the late 19th century could not find a way to inject it into humans with their brand new hypodermic needles...and still haven’t. By the 1890s, some of the most popular American marriage guides recommend cannabis as an aphro¬ disiac of extraordinary powers—no one ever suggest¬ ed a prohibition law against cannabis. And while there was talk of an alcohol prohibition law, a num¬ ber of women’s temperance organizations even sug¬ gested hashish as a substitute for “Demon” alcohol, which they said led to wife beating. A POPULAR INSPIRATION OF THE 19TH CENTURY LITERARY GREATS From the early 1800s on, some of the world’s fore¬ most romantic and revolutionary writers on individu¬ al freedom and human dignity extolled cannabis use. We study their works in school today as ‘classics’: Victor Hugo: Les Miserables, 1862, Notre Dame of Paris (Hunchback of...), 1831. Alexandre Dumas: The Count of Monte Cristo, 1844, The Three Musketeers, 1844. Coleridge, Gautier, De Quincy, Balzac, Baudelaire, and John Greenleaf Whittier (Barbara Fritchie), etc. Cannabis and mushroom imagery influenced Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, 1865, and Through the Looking Glass, 1872. (see picture) In the early 1860s, Mark Twain’s best friend and mentor was the already famous best-selling writer and advocate of cannabis, the young (mid-20s) Fitz Hugh Ludlow {The Hashish Eater, 1857). Ludlow extolled hashish eating as a wondrous mind adventure but warned strongly against over-indul¬ gence of it and all drugs. These authors’ stories usually had several things in common: A complete love of individual freedom; respect for the dignity of each human’s search for individual con¬ sciousness; and humorous contempt for the establish¬ ment, beliefs, bureaucracies and injustices of their day (for example, Les Miserables). The science of psycho-pharmacology started in France circa 1845 with Doctor J.J. Moreau DeTours, and cannabis became one of the first drugs used to treat the insane and depressed. Moreau was best friends with Dumas, Hugo, and Gautier, and in 1845 co-founded with them in Paris the first cannabis club in the Western World: Le Club Des Haschischins. MAPLE SUGAR HASHISH CANDY Starting in the 1860s, the “Ganjah Wallah Hash¬ eesh Candy Company” made maple sugar hashish candy, which soon became one of the most popular treats in America. It was sold over the counter and advertised in newspapers by Sears-Roebuck, as well as be¬ ing fisted in its own catalogs, as a totally harmless fun candy for 40 years.

TURKISH SMOKING PARLORS World Fairs and International Expositions from the 1860s through the early 1900s often featured a popu¬ lar Turkish Hashish Smoking exposition and conces¬ sion. Hashish smoking was entirely new for Americans; its effects came on much faster. However, smoking hashish was only about one-third as strong or long lasting as orally ingesting the cannabis ex¬ tract medicines that even American children were regularly prescribed. At America’s giant 100-year 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, fair goers took their friends and family to partake (smoke) at the ex¬ tremely popular Turkish Hashish Exposition, so as to “enhance” their fair experience. By 1883, similar hashish smoking parlors were open in every major American city, including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, New Orleans, and so on. The Police Gazette estimated there were over 500 hashish smoking parlors in New York City in the 1880s and it was estimated by the NYPD that there were still 500 or more hashish parlors in N.Y.C. in the 1920s—more of these parlors than there were “speakeasys” during the same 1920s alcohol prohibi¬ tion period. AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE By the start of this cen¬ tury almost four genera¬ tions of Americans had been using cannabis. Virtually everyone in this country was familiar from childhood on with the “highs” of cannabis ex¬ tract—yet doctors did not | consider it habit forming, anti-social or violent at all after 60 years of use. This leads us to an im¬ portant question: If it was not fear of health or social consequences that led to the eventual ban of can¬ nabis use in America (and later forced on the rest of the world), what did? THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN What socio-political force would be strong enough to turn Americans against something as innocent as a plant—let alone one which everyone had an interest in using to improve their own lives? Earlier, you read how the first federal anti-mari¬ juana laws (1937) came about because of William Randolph Hearst’s lies, yellow journalism and racist newspaper articles and ravings, which from then on were cited in Congressional testimony by Harry Anslinger as facts. But what started Hearst on the marijuana and racist scare stories? What intelligence or ignorance, for which we still punish fellow Americans to the tune of 12 million years in jail in just the last 50 years, (390,000 arrested in 1990 alone for mari¬ juana)—brought this all about? The first step was to introduce the element of fear of the unknown by using a word that no one had ever heard of before: “marijuana.” The next step was to keep the maneuverings hid¬ den from the doctors and hemp industries who would have defended hemp by holding most of the hearings on prohibition in secret. And, finally, to stir up primal emotions and tap right into an existing pool of hatred that was already poisoning society: racism. — 63 —"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The blackface team of McIntyre and Heath had audiences rolling in the aisles for decades.

SMOKING IN AMERICA The first known* smoking of female cannabis tops in the Western hemisphere was in the 1870s in the West Indies (Jamaica, Bahamas, Barbados, etc.); and arrived with the immi g ration of thousands of Indian Hindus imported for cheaper labor. By 1886, Mexicans and Black sailors, who traded in those is¬ lands, picked up and spread its use throughout all the West Indies and Mexico. * There are other theories about the first known “smoking” of hemp flower tops, e.g, by American and Brazilian slaves, Shawnee Indians, etc., some fascinating—but none verifiable. Cannabis smoking was generally used in the West Indies to ease the back-breaking work in the cane fields, beat the heat, and to relax in the evenings without the threat of an alcohol hangover in the morning. \"Negroes, Mexicans and entertainers,”—and their jazz and swing music—were declared an outgrowth of marijuana use. Given its late 19th century area of usage—the Caribbean West Indies and Mexico—it is not surpris¬ ing the first marijuana use recorded in the U.S. was that of Mexicans in Brownsville, Texas in 1903, and then in 1909 in the port of New Orleans, in the Black dominated “Storeyville” section frequented by sailors. New Orleans’ Storeyville was filled with cabarets, brothels, music, and all the other usual accouter¬ ments of “red fight” districts the world over. Sailors from the Islands took their shore leave and their marijuana there. BLACKFACE ... The Public Safety Commissioner of New Orleans wrote that, “marijuana was the most frightening and vicious drug ever to hit New Orleans,” and in 1910 warned that regular users might number as high as 200 in Storeyville alone. To the D.A. and Public Safety Commissioners and New Orleans newspapers from 1910 through the 1930s, marijuana’s insidious evil influence apparent¬ ly manifested itself in making the “darkies” think they were as good as “white men.” In fact, marijuana was being blamed for the first re¬ fusals of black entertainers to wear blackface* and for hysterical laughter by Negroes under marijuana’s influence when told to cross a street or go to the back of the trolley, etc. * That’s right, your eyes have not deceived you. Because of a curi¬ ous quirk in the “Jim Crow” (segregation; apartheid type) laws, black Americans were banned from any stage in the Deep South (and most other places in the North and West also). Negroes had to wear (through the 1920s) blackface—(like A1 Jolson wore when he sang “Swanee\") a dye which white entertainers wore to resemble or mimic black people. Actually, by “Jim Crow” law, blacks were not allowed on the stage at all, but because of their talent were allowed to sneak/en- ter through back doors, put on blackface, and pretend to be a white person playing the part of a black person... ...AND ALL THAT JAZZ In New Orleans, whites were also concerned that black musicians, rumored to smoke marijuana, were spreading (selling) a very powerful (popular) new “voodoo” music that forced even decent white women to tap their feet and was ultimately aimed at throw¬ ing off the yoke of the whites. Today we call that new music... Jazz! —65 —"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Blacks obviously played upon the white New Orleans racists’ fears of “voodoo” to try to keep whites out of their lives. Jazz’s birthplace is generally recognized to be in Storeyville, New Orleans, and home of the original innovators: Buddy Bohler, Buck Johnson and others (1909-1917). Storeyville was also the birthplace of Louis Armstrong* (1900). * In 1930—one year after Louis Armstrong recorded “Muggles” (read: “marijuana”)—he was arrested for a marijuana cigarette in Los Angeles, California and put in jail for 10 days until he agreed to leave California and not return for two years. American newspapers, politicians, and police, had virtually no idea, for 15 years (until the 1920s, and then only rarely), that the marijuana the “darkies” and “Chicanos” were smoking in cigarettes or pipes was just a weaker version of the many familiar con¬ centrated cannabis medicines they’d been taking since childhood, or that the same drug was smoked at the local “white man’s” plush hashish parlors. ANSLINGER’S HATRED OF BLACKS AND JAZZ After retirement, Harry Anslinger personally de¬ livered his papers from his 30 years as the world’s top narc to Penn State University. From the Anslinger papers and the Washington, D.C., DEA Library (containing the old F.B.N. papers and memos), we have this: From 1943 to 1948, Anslinger ordered all his agents throughout the country to watch and keep marijuana criminal files on virtually all jazz and swing musicians; but not to bust them until he could coordinate all the jazz busts on the same night. Anslinger kept files on Thelonius Monk, Louis Armstrong, Les Brown, Count Basie, Jimmy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, Andre Kostelanetz, Cab Calloway, the NBC Orchestra, the Milton Berle show, the Coca-Cola program, the Jackie Gleason show and even the Kate Smith program. His goal and dream was to bust them all in one gi¬ ant nationwide sweep! This would gamer the front page of every newspaper in America, and make Anslinger more well-known than his 20 year chief rival, the F.B.I.’s famous J, Edgar Hoover. The jazz and swing musicians would be shown to the youth of America for what they really were — “dope fiends.” Anslinger ordered his agents to keep files and con¬ stant surveillance on the following “low life” Americans and their bands, singers and comedians: Thelonius Monk, Louis Armstrong, Les Brown, Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Jimmy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, Andre Kostelanetz. Also under surveillance were the NBC Orchestra, the Milton Berle show, the Coca-Cola program, the Jackie Gleason program, and even the Kate Smith program. People we think of today as wonderful Americans and musical innovators. For five years they were watched and the files grew. From 1943 to 1948 the federal agents waited to make their move. Typical of a “small time” jazz musicians’ files is the following: “Defendant is a colored man in Camden, Texas, bom —, is 5’8” tall, 165 lbs., black complex¬ ion, black hair, black eyes. He has scars on left fore¬ head, and a tattoo of a dagger and the word—, on his right forearm. He is a musician and plays the trumpet in small Tot bands.’ He has a very large mouth and thick lips which earned him his name of——. He is a marijuana smoker” Other files are just as ridiculous, racist and anti-jazz. The only reason the big bust of the musicians didn’t go down? Anslinger’s superior at the Treasury Department, Assistant Secretary Foley, when in¬ formed by Anslinger of the nationwide jazz musician round-up, wrote back: “Mr. Foley disapproves!” Anslinger’s longtime and closest departmental as¬ sociate and probably his best friend, Dr. James Munch*, was interviewed in 1978 about Anslinger’s hatred for jazz musicians in the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s, by Larry Sloman for a book published by Bobbs- Merrill, “Reefer Madness,” in 1979. * Dr. Munch, a chemist for the FBN, was widely touted by the Government and press as America’s foremost authority on the ef¬ fects of marijuana during the 1930’s and 40’s. Sloman: “Why did he [Anslinger] want to go after them [the jazz/swing musicians] so much?” Dr. Munch: “Because the chief effect as far as they [Anslinger, FBN] were concerned was that it length¬ ens the sense of time, and therefore they could get more grace beats into their music than they could if they simply followed the written [musical] copy...” Sloman: “What’s wrong with that?” Dr. Munch: “In other words, if you are a musician, you are going to play the thing [music] the way it is printed on a sheet. But, if you’re using marijuana, you are going to work in about twice as much music in between the first note and the second note. That’s what made jazz musicians.

The real figures were undoubt¬ edly higher. It is estimated that one-third of these lynchings were for “insolence,” which might be anything from looking (or being accused of looking) at a white woman twice, to stepping on a white man’s shadow, even to looking a white man directly in the eye for more than thiee seconds, not going directly to the back of the trolley, etc. It was obvious to whites, marijuana caused Negro and Mexican “vi¬ ciousness” or they wouldn’t dare be “insolent”; etc... Hundreds of thousands of negroes and Chicanos were sentenced from 10 days to 10 years mostly on local and state “chain gangs” for such silly crimes as we have just listed. This was the nature of “Jim Crow” Laws until the 1950s and 60s; the laws Martin Luther King, the NAACP, and general public outcry have finally begun remedying in America. We can only imagine the immediate effect the Black entertainers’ refusal to wear blackface had on the white establishment, but seven years later, 1917, Storeyville was completely shut-down. Apartheid had its moment of triumph. No longer did the upright, up-tight white citizen have to worry about white women going to Storeyville to listen to “voodoo” jazz or perhaps be raped by its marijuana-crazed “Black adherents” who showed vicious disrespect (insolence) for whites and their “Jim Crow Laws” by stepping on their (white men’s) shadows and the like when they were high on marijuana. Black musicians then took their music and mari¬ juana up the Mississippi to Memphis, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, etc., where the (white) city fa¬ thers, for the same racist reasons, soon passed local marijuana laws to stop “evil” music and keep white women from falling prey to Blacks through jazz and marijuana. MEXICAN-AMERICANS In 1915, California and Utah passed state laws out¬ lawing marijuana for the same “Jim Crow” rea¬ sons—but directed through the Hearst papers at Chicanos. Mexicans under marijuana's influence were demanding humane treatment, looking at white women, and asking that their children he educated while the parents harvested sugar beets; and other “ insolent” demands . Colorado followed in 1917. Its legislators cited ex¬ cesses of Pancho Villa’s rebel army, whose drug of choice was supposed to have been marijuana. Which, if true, means that marijuana helped to overthrow one of the most repressive and evil regimes Mexico ever suffered. The Colorado Legislature felt the only way to pre¬ vent an actual racial blood bath and the overthrow of their (whites’) ignorant and bigoted laws, attitudes and institutions was to stop marijuana. Mexicans under marijuana’s influence were de¬ manding humane treatment, looking at white wom¬ en, and asking that their children be educated while the parents harvested sugar beets; and other “inso¬ lent” demands. With the excuse of marijuana (Killer Weed) the whites could now use force and rationalize their violent acts of repression. This “reefer racism” continues into the present day. In 1937, Harry Anslinger told Congress that there were between 50,000 to 100,000* total marijuana smokers then in the U.S. and most of them were “Negroes and Mexicans, and entertainers,” and their music, jazz and swing were an outgrowth of this mar- —67 —"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"ijuana use. He insisted this “satanic” music and the use of marijuana caused white women to “seek sexu¬ al relations with Negroes!” * Anslinger would flip to know there are 26 million daily mari¬ juana users in America now, and that rock & roll and jazz are en¬ joyed by tens of millions who have never smoked marijuana. SOUTH AFRICA TODAY In 1911, South Africa* began the outlawing of mari¬ juana for the same reasons as New Orleans: to stop insolent Blacks! And South Africa, along with Egypt, led the international fight (League of Nations) to have cannabis outlawed world-wide. * South Africa still allowed its Black min e workers to smoke dagga in the mines, though. Why? Because they were more productive! In fact, in that same year, South Africa influenced Southern U.S. legislators to outlaw cannabis (which many black South Africans revered as “dagga” their sacred herb). This is the whole racial and religious (Medieval Catholic Church) basis of where our laws against hemp arose. Are you proud? Twelve million years so far have been spent in jails, prisons, parole and on probation by Americans for this absurd racist and probably economic reasoning. (See chapter 4, “Last Days of Legal Cannabis”) Isn’t it interesting that in 1985 the U.S. incarcerat¬ ed a larger percentage of people than any country in the world except South Africa? In 1989 the U.S. sur¬ passed South Africa, and the 1992 incarceration rate is almost three times that of South Africa. President Bush, in his great drug policy speech September 5, 1989, promised to double the federal prison population again, after it had already doubled under Reagan. He succeeded in 1992 and wants to re-double the number of prisoners again 1996. Remember the outcry in 1979 when former UN Am- bassador Andrew Young told the world ihat the U.S. had more political prisoners than any other nation? (Amnesty International, ACLU.) LASTING REMNANTS Even though blackface disappeared as law in the late 1920s, as late as the 1960s, black entertainers (such as Harry Belafonte and Sammy Davis, Jr.) still had to go in the back door of theatrical establish¬ ments, bars, etc; by law! They couldn’t rent a hotel room in Las Vegas or Miami Beach—even while being the headline act. Ben Vereen’s 1981 Presidential Inauguration per¬ formance for Ronald Reagan presented this country’s turn of the century Blackface/Jim Crow laws in a great story, about black comic genius Bert Williams (circa 1890 to 1920). Vereen had been invited to perform for the Reagan Inauguration and had accepted only on the condition that he could tell the entire “Blackface” story—but the whole first half of Vereen’s show, depicting Bert Williams and blackface, wps censored by Reagan’s people on ABC TV, contrary to the special agreement Vereen had with the Reagan people.

An estimated 60,000 Americans smoke (i marijuanabut virtually everyone in the country has heard of it, thanks to Hearst and Anslinger’s disinformation campaign. 1945: Newsweek reports that over 100,000people now smoke marijuana. 1967: Millions of Americans regularly and openly smoke hemp leaves and flowers. 1977: Tens of millions smoke cannabis regularly, with many people growing their own. 1987: One in three Americans have now tried it at least once, and some 10% to 20% of Americans still choose to buy and smoke it regularly, despite urine tests and tougher laws. Throughout history, Americans have held the legal tradition that one could not give up one’s Constitutional rights—and if someone was stripped of these protections, then he or she was be¬ ing victimized. By 1989, if you sign up for an extracurricular activity in school or apply for a minimum wage job, you could be asked to forego your right to privacy, protection from self-incrimination, Constitutional requirements of reasonable grounds for search and seizure, presumed innocence until found guilty by your peers, and that most fundamental right of all: personal responsibility for your own life and consciousness. FACTORIES & THE NAVY V The Navy and the other Armed Forces, as well as many civilian factories, will boot you out if you smoke marijuana; even if you smoke it 30 days before test¬ ing and while off duty. These tests are done at ran¬ dom and often do not include liquor, tranquilizer or other speed-type drugs. However, according to OSHA and insurance actuarial findings, plus the AFL-CIO, it is alcohol that is involved in 90-95% of drug related factory accidents. In fact, numerous U.S. Army tests of the effects of cannabis on soldiers (through the 1950s and 60s) at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and elsewhere, show no loss of motivation or performance after two years of heavy (military sponsored) smoking of marijuana. This study was repeated six more times by the mili¬ tary and dozens of times by universities with the same or similar results. (Also, Panama/Siler study; Jamaican study; British Indian Hemp Report.) South African gold and diamond mines allowed and encouraged Blacks to use cannabis/Dagga in order to work harder. (U.S. Government Reports, 1956-58-61-63-68-69-70-76.) PRIVACY IS A RIGHT Groups like NORML, HEMP, ACLU, BACH and the Libertarian Party (for example) feel that as long as military personnel (unless on alert) or factory workers do not smoke cannabis while on duty or dur¬ ing the period four to six hours before duty, it's then- own business. This is consistent with the conclusions of the U.S. government’s own Siler Commission (1933) and Shafer Commission (1972) Reports, as well as the LaGuardia report (1944), the Canadian Government Study (1972), Alaska State Commission (1989), and the California Research Advisory Panel (1989), all of which held that no criminal penalties are in order for its use. INACCURATE URINE TESTING Military/factory worker marijuana urine tests are only partially accurate and do not indicate the extent of your intoxication. They indicate only whether you have smoked or been in the presence of cannabis smoke in the last 30 days. Whether you smoked an hour ago or 30 days ago—and sometimes if you haven’t smoked it at all—the test results are the same: Positive. John P. Morgan, M.D., stated in High Times (February 1989), “The tests are far from reliable. Tampering and high rates of false-positives, false- negatives, etc. are common and further these testing companies are held to no standards but their own.” At 20-50 nanograms (billionths of a gram) per milliliter of THC Carboxy Acid (a metabolite) these tests can be read as positive or negative—yet results 69"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"LAROUCHE DECLARES WAR ON ROCK ‘N’ ROLL If you thought Anslinger’s music craziness was over after he went after jazz in the 1930s and 40s, then consider this: One of the chief organizations among the 4,000 or so “Families Against Marijuana” type groups today is Lyndon LaRouche’s “War on Drugs” committee, supported by Nancy Reagan, Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart and other right-wing activists. In January, 1981, this author and five members of the California Marijuana Initiative (CMI) secretly at¬ tended the West Coast convention of this organiza¬ tion, whose guest speaker was Ed Davis, former Los Angeles Police Chief, who was at that time a fresh¬ man state senator from Chatsworth, California. As we each walked in separately, we were asked to sign a petition endorsing a Detroit reporter who had written an open letter to the new President, Ronald Reagan, asking him to give immediate presidential clemency and make a national hero of Mark Chapman, who had murdered John Lennon of the Beatles six weeks earlier. The letter stated that John Lennon had been the most evil man on the planet because he almost sin¬ gle-handedly “turned on” the planet to “illicit drugs.” The evils of rock-n-roll are a constant theme of the “War on Drugs” publications. To keep up with the part we were playing, we signed the petition. (John, forgive us—we were play¬ ing a clandestine role: under-cover CMI anti-narc. We remember you for “Give Peace a Chance,” “Imagine,” and all the rest.) After we signed the petition, their leaders took us to the back of the room to show us some of the goals that would be achieved when they would come to full power over the next decade. On five or so long tables set up in the back of the Los Angeles Marnott LAX meeting room were hun¬ dreds of recordings of Bach, Beethoven, Wagner, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Mozart, and others, and dozens of pro-nuclear power publications. They told us that along with new marijuana laws, they expected to implement their most important goal: anyone in the future playing any disco, rock & roll, or jazz on the radio, on television, in schools, or in concert, or just sold rock & roll records or any oth¬ er music that wasn’t from their approved classical lists, would be jailed, including music .teachers, Hisp jockeys, and record company executives. School teachers, if they allowed such music by students, would be fired. (LA Times; KNBC-TV.) They were dead serious. Their magazine “War on Drugs” has always spent more space denouncing music with the “evil mari¬ juana beat” than on heroin, cocaine and PCP com¬ bined! Ed Davis was genuinely shocked and embarrassed about this out-front aspect of their anti-music dog¬ ma and said, “Well, I don’t believe we could ever get legislation at this time outlawing these other types of music or their lyrics.... But I do believe with the new Reagan Law-and-Order Administration, we are going to be able to pass some new and stronger anti- marijuana paraphernalia laws, even recriminalize marijuana altogether in the states that have decrim¬ inalization laws now.... That’s the start.” The letter stated that John Lennon had been the most evil man on the planet . I called his office a few days later and was told by an assistant that Davis had no advance idea of this group’s musical fixation and that he had accepted the invitation based solely on the name “War on Drugs.” Most of what Davis predicted that day has come about. Those visionaries of anew society, one free from the influence of pot and any mention of it had their way in the 1980s. Remember James Watt and the Beach Boys in 1986? Since 1981, TV programs have been censored, cut and pulled from the air for having a pro-marijuana connotation or even making jokes about it. In an episode of Barney Miller, Detective Fish (Abe Vagoda) was told that some brownies he’d been eat¬ ing all day were laced with pot. He looked forlorn, for a moment, then said with a sigh, “Wouldn’t you know it, this is the best I ever felt in my life—and it’s illegal.” This episode has been pulled from distri¬ bution. And screaming comic the late Sam Kinison stood on the stage of NBC’s Saturday Night Live in 1986 and bellowed “Go ahead, you can have the cocaine! Just let us have our pot!” The line has been deleted from audio portion in subsequent re-runs. The Reagan/Bush drug czar, Carlton Turner, from his position as the White House Chief Drug Advisor quoted to the press passages of “The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire” and told police and interviewers that jazz musicians and rock singers were destroy¬ ing the America he loved with their marijuana drug- beat music. — 70 —"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"derived from this part of the scale are known to be meaningless, lb the untrained eye, any positive indi¬ cation sends up a red flag. And most testers are un¬ trained and uncertified. Still, the decision to hire, fire, detain, re-test or begin drug abuse treatment is made for you on the spot. “I believe the tendency to read the EMIT [the urine test for THC metabolites! test below the detection limit is one of the important reasons why the test was not often confirmed in published reports,” Dr. Morgan said. In 1985, Milton Wisconsin high school kids were or¬ dered to have urine tests weekly to see if they smoked pot. Local “Families Against Marijuana” type organizations were demanding this testing, but not for liquor, downers or other hazardous drugs. Hundreds of communities and high schools throughout the country were awaiting the outcome of constitutional challenges in Milton in 1988 before im¬ plementing similar testing programs in their own school districts. Testing for high school students par¬ ticipating in extra-curricular activities has since been widely adopted. For instance, in Oregon the testing of high-school athletes has spread by court order to any and all ex¬ tra-curricular activity. Band members and ma¬ jorettes—even debate team members, some debating on the marijuana issue—can now be tested at will. (NORML reports, High Times, ABC, NBC & CBS News, 1981- 1984, Oregonian, October 23, 1989.) AND ...BABB RUTH Former Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth in 1985 ordered all personnel, except unionized play¬ ers, to submit to these urine tests. From the owners to the peanut vendors to the bat boys, it is mandato¬ ry in order to be employed. By 1990, it had been in¬ corporated into all contracts, including ball-players. Whether you smoked an hour or 30 days ago, the urine test results are the same: Positive. Aside from the civil liberties questions raised, it is apparently forgotten that “Babe” Ruth would regu¬ larly invite reporters to accompany him while he drank 12 beers prior to playing a game, during alco¬ hol prohibition. Many “dry” organizations and even the League Commissioner implored him to think of the children who idolized him and stop, but the “Babe” refused. If Peter Ueberroth or his ilk had been in charge of baseball during prohibition, the “Sultan of Swat” would have been fired in shame and millions of chil- — 71 dren would not have proudly played in “Babe Ruth Little Leagues.” Lyndon LaRouche’s “War on Drugs” committee told us that, along with new marijuana laws, they expected to implement their most important goal: anyone in the future playing any disco, rock & roll or jazz on the radio, on television, in schools, or in concert, or who just sold rock & roll records—or any music that wasn't on their approved classical lists—would be jailed, including music teachers, disc jockeys and record company executives. Tens of millions of average Americans choose to use cannabis to relax during their time off the job, and therefore risk criminal penalties. Job performance should be the principle criterion for evaluation of all employees, not personal life style choices. The Babe Ruths of sports, the Henry Fords of in¬ dustry, the Pink Floyds, Beatles, Picassos and Louis Armstrongs of the arts, and one out of ten Americans have become criminals—and thousands unem¬ ployed—for smoking cannabis, even when merely un¬ winding in the privacy of their own homes. Robert Mitchum’s film career was almost destroyed by a 1948 marijuana arrest. Federal Judge Douglas Ginsburg was on the verge of being appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 when it was revealed that he had smoked grass while a university profes¬ sor and his name was withdrawn from nomination. However, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ 1991 a dmis sion that he smoked marijuana in college was not an issue in his controversial confirmation. DIVIDING COMMUNITIES ...& SPLITTING UP FAMILIES “Help a friend, send him to jail,” says a billboard in Ventura, California. This is an example of the ‘zero tolerance’ campaign’s inform-on-your-neighbor tactics being used to enforce the laws against the victimless crime of cannabis smoking. Here’s another example from TV: “If you have knowledge of a felony you can earn up to one thou¬ sand dollars. Your name will not be used and you will not be required to appear in court.”* One man re¬ ceived a postcard in jail saying, “Our informant re¬ ceived $600 for turning you in.

UNAMERICAN POLICIES & POLITICAL EXTORTION Richard Nixon ordered the FBI to illegally monitor John Lennon 24-hours a day for six solid months in 1971 because Lennon had given a concert in Michigan to free a student (John Sin¬ clair) from five years in jail for possession of two joints. (L.A. Times, August, 1983.) The drug and oil and pa¬ per and liquor companies want pot illegal forever, no matter whose rights they suppress. Politicians who are liberal are investigated and, we believe, are blackmailed to keep their mouths shut on this subject and others, or risk being exposed for some past indiscretion by themselves or members of their families—possibly sexual or drug-related. POLICE, SECRETS & BLACKMAIL A few years ago Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates ordered constant surveillance of City Councilman Zev YarsloYsky, and of then-City Attorney John Van De- Kamp and L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley, among oth¬ ers. He monitored their private sex lives for more than a year. (L.A. Times, August, 1983.) J. Edgar Hoover, as Director of the F.B.I., did this for five years to Martin Luther King Jr. and, in the most “sick” sit¬ uation, deliberately drove actress Jean Seburg to suicide with terrible ongo¬ ing federal letters and in¬ formation fed to tabloids exposing her pregnancies and private dates with Negroes. In fact, using the FBI, Hoover harassed se¬ lected targets, for as long as 20 years because of their civil rights stands. The former Director of the FBI and also direct overseer of the DEA, Wil¬ liam Webster, answered questions about the squandering of 50% of federal drug enforcement money on cannabis en¬ forcement this way: Oh, marijuana is an extremely dangerous drug and the proof is now coming in (brain studies, metabolite studies by Heath, Nahas). Webster then asked for more money and more un¬ restrained powers to stop pot. (Nightwatch, CBS, January 1,1985.) PUBLIC HUMILIATION Entertainers caught with cannabis have had to do a “Galileo” type recanting to stay out of jail or to retain paul McCartney & his BAND ON THE RUN Timothy White interviewed Paul McCartney, for¬ merly of the Beatles rock group, for a book and de¬ veloped it into a radio program called “McCartney: The First 20 years.” He asked the songwriter to explain his song “Band on the Run,” on the album of the same name. “Well, at the time, bands like us and the Eagles were feeling like and being treated like, outlaws and desperados, you know,” replied McCartney. “I mean, people were getting busted—for pot, that is. And that’s about all they were getting popped for. Never anything serious. “And our argument was that we didn’t want to be outlaws. We just wanted to be part of the regu¬ lar scene, you know, and make our music and five in peace. We didn’t see why we should be treated like criminals when all we wanted to do was smoke pot instead of hitting the booze. “And that‘s what the song was about; it was my reaction to that whole scene,... “And the county judge / who held a grudge / will search forevermore / for the hand on the run.” —From “The Pint 20 Years,” broadcast on KLSX 97.1 FM (Los Angeles) and other stations of the Westwood One radio network January *9,1990. m '/& ' t ss f ' A ■ \" * ‘ V - v. ‘‘ s \\ McCartney also wrote the famous line that got the song “A Day in the Life” banned from British radio: “Had a smoke.

To his credit, he has continued to speak out for pot smokers. — 72 —"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"their television, endorsement, or nightclub contracts, etc. Some have had to go on television and denounce marijuana to stay out of jail (e.g. Peter Yarrow of “Peter, Paul and Mary” and actress Linda Carter). Our courts and legislators have sold our American “guaranteed” Bill of Rights, written on cannabis, to secure a cannabis-free world. “Don’t suspect your neighbor, turn him in” Any heresy is to be reported. That which revolted us as children—the spectre of Nazis asking everyone to spy and inform on one another; Stalin’s secret police tak¬ ing people from their homes at night to administer stupefying drugs and extort information; a govern¬ ment spreading lies and creating a police state—has now become our everyday reality. And those who dare to stand against the tide of op¬ pression face the prospect of financial ruin. SEIZURE: FEUDAL LAW & ORDER When the federal government seizes cars, boats, money, real estate and other personal property, pro¬ ceedings are set into motion based on laws that origi¬ nated with medieval superstition. English common law of the Middle Ages provided for forfeiture of any object causing a man’s death. Known as a “deodand,” the object, such as a weapon or rusi-away ox cart, was personified and declared tainted or evil, and forfeited to the king. Today’s “in rem” (against things rather than against persons) forfeiture proceedings are civil suits against the property itself. Relying on analogy to the deo¬ dand, a legal ‘personification fiction,’declares the property to be the defendant. It is held guilty and condemned, as though it were a personality—and the guilt or innocence of the owner is irrelevant. By applying this civil label to forfeiture proceed¬ ings, the government sidesteps almost all the protec¬ tions offered by the Constitution to individuals. There is no Sixth Amendment guarantee of right to counsel. Innocent until proven guilty is reversed. Each violation of a constitutional right is then used as the basis for the destruction of another. The violation of the Fifth Amendment’s “innocent until proven guilty” due process standard is used to destroy the prohibition of double jeopardy. Even ac¬ quittal of the criminal charges the forfeiture is based upon does not prevent re-trying the same facts, be¬ cause, even though the government couldn’t prove a crime was committed, at the second trial the defen¬ dant must provide proof of innocence. The Supreme Court holds that it is constitutional to forfeit property in rem from a person who is com¬ pletely innocent and non-negligent in his use of the property. Lower courts accept prosecutors’ arguments that if it is permissible to forfeit property from com¬ pletely innocent people, then constitutional protec¬ tions could not possibly apply to anyone who is guilty of even a minor drug offense. Unlike civil suits between individuals, the govern¬ ment is immune to counter-suit. The government can use its unlimited resources to repeatedly press a suit in the mere hope of convincing one juror the defen¬ dant did not provide a preponderance of evidence. Forfeitures imposed by the English Crown led our nation’s founders to prohibit bills of attainder (forfei¬ ture consequent to conviction) in the first article of the American Constitution. The main body of the Constitution also forbids forfeiture of estate for trea¬ son. The first Congress passed the statute, still law today, stating that “No conviction or judgement shall work corruption of blood or any forfeiture of estate.” However, early Americans did incorporate in rem procedures under Admiralty and Maritime law, to seize pnemy ships at sea and to enforce payment of customs duties. It was not until the outbreak of the Civil War that these Customs procedures were radically changed. The Confiscation Act of July 17, 1862 declared all property belonging to Confederate officers or those who aided the rebels to be forfeitable in rem.. The U.S. Supreme Court held that if the Act was an exer¬ cise of the war powers of government and was ap¬ plied only to enemies , then it was Constitutionally al¬ lowable in order to ensure a speedy termination of the war. Today, the passions of the “War on Drugs” have caused Congress to once again use in rem proceed¬ ings to inflict punishment without the nuisance of the protections provided by the Constitution and Bill of Rights. “We have to save our Constitution,” says Vickie Linker, whose husband served two years in prison for a cannabis offense. “We have the truth.” ENTRAPMENT, INTOLERANCE & IGNORANCE When not enough people seem to be committing crimes, the DEA and police departments often resort to entrapment to make criminals out of unsuspecting and otherwise non-criminal people.

In an October, 1989 Louisville, KY address to the Police Chiefs of that state, drug Czar and social drinking nicotine-addict William Bennett announced that marijuana smoking makes people stupid.* * This is the same man who helped engineer a $2.9 million grant for the Ihxas National Guard to dress its agents up as cactus to pa¬ trol the Mexican border. He offered no proof, and although crack was not a major issue in Kentucky, proclaimed that more mon¬ ey was necessary for the war on drugs because of this new found marijuana-induced danger—stupidity! (Which, as far as we know, is still not a crime.) Bennett was seen to brace himself with a late- morning gin and tonic in December, 1989 as he tried to pitch a similar message to representatives of the broadcast and film industries in Hollywood, CA. (High Times, February, 1990. See “Booze Brunch” in appendix.) PDFA: SLICKLY PACKAGED LIES Another recent development has been the forma¬ tion of the PDFA (Partnership for a Drug Free America) by the Media PDFA, with primarily in-kind funding from ad agencies and media groups. The PDFA makes available (free of charge to all broad¬ cast and print media) slick public service ads directed primarily against marijuana. In addition to releasing such meaningless drivel as an ad which shows a skillet (“This is drugs.”) on which an egg is frying (“This is your brain. Get it?”), PDFA is not above lying outright in their ads. Outraged researcher Dr. Donald Blum of the UCLA Neurological Studies center told KABC news that the chart said to show the effects of marijuana actually show the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep —or in a coma. In one ad, the wreckage of a train is shown. Now, everyone will agree that no one should attempt to drive a train while high on marijuana. But a man’s voice says that anyone who tells you that ‘marijuana is harmless’ is lying, because his wife was killed in a train accident caused by marijuana. This contradicts the direct sworn testimony of the engineer responsi¬ ble for that disaster; that “this accident was not caused by marijuana.” And it deliberately ignores his admissions of drinking alcohol, snacking, watching TV, generally fading to pay adequate attention to his job, and deliberately jamming the train’s safety equipment prior to the accident. In another ad, a sad looking couple is told that they cannot have children because the husband used to smoke pot. This is a direct contradiction both of the clinical evidence developed in nearly a century of cannabis studies and of the personal experiences of millions of Americans who have smoked cannabis and borne perfectly healthy children. And in yet another ad, the group was so arrogant in putting out lies that it finally got into trouble. The ad showed two brain wave charts which it said showed the brain waves of a 14-year-old “on marijuana.” Outraged, researcher Dr. Donald Blum from the UCLA neurological studies center told KABC TV (Los Angeles) news November 2,1989, that the chart actually shows the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep—or in a coma. He said that he and other researchers had previ¬ ously complained to the PDFA, and added that cannabis user’s brain wave charts are much different and have a well-known signature, due to years of re¬ search on the effects of cannabis on the brain. Even after this public refutation, it took the sta¬ tions and PDFA weeks to pull the spot, and no apolo¬ gy or retraction had yet been offered for the deceit, as this edition of Emperor went to press.* * Groups including the American Hemp Council, the Family Council on Drug Awareness and Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) have decided to step up their pressure to expose PDFA lies and get their distortions banned from the airwaves or, better yet, re¬ placed with accurate information on the medical, social and commer¬ cial uses of hemp. Perhaps a more valid ad for the PDFA to produce and the networks to run would show a skillet (“This is the PDFA.”) and an egg frying (“These are the facts”). DARE: POLICE PROPAGANDISTS The DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) pro¬ gram, a national program that was initiated in 1983 by Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, has become yet another tool for disinforming the public on hemp. Typically, a police department spokes person will conduct a 17-week course at a local elementary school to promote personal responsible behavior by young people while irresponsibly giving them distort¬ ed information and outright lies about cannabis. Most of the course does not deal with drugs as such, but rather with making choices about how to act when there are opportunities or pressures to drink, smoke, steal, He, break laws, etc. However, the pro¬ gram’s truly useful support for good behavior is un¬ dermined by an undercurrent of lies and innuendo about marijuana’s effects and users.* * In an interview, LA.’s main DARE instructor, Sgt. Domagalski, 74"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"gave information on the program and made such unsubstan¬ tiated—and untrue—statements as marijuana leads to heroin, “The guy across the street or next door has been smoking marijuana for years and there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with him. There is something wrong, but it may not be obvious.” And, “People in the Sixties smoked marijuana and thought there was nothing wrong with it. Now it’s watered and sprayed and pampered—and they’re not concerned what they spray it with, either. But parents don’t know this. They got all their information in the Sixties, and they’re not interested in this new information.” (Downtown News, July 10, 1989. Also see letters section, July 31, 1989 for BACH’s reply.) See chapter 16, “Debunking” for the facts on his “new information.” - ! What makes the DARE program uniquely dangerous is that it provides some accurate information , but undermines itself and the public record by using lies and innuendo about marijuana. For example, according to teachers who sit in on the sessions,* the police officer will remark, “I can’t tell you that smoking pot causes brain damage, be¬ cause you all know people who smoke pot and they seem pretty normal. But that’s what it does. You just can’t tell—yet.” \" * Some of the teachers we talked to find themselves in the uncom¬ fortable position of knowing the real studies, or have used cannabis themselves and know its effects, but cannot openly present their case for fear of being urine tested or dismissed. No supporting evidence is then offered, and the lit¬ erature that goes home with the child (and is poten¬ tially seen by marijuana-sawy parents) tends to ap¬ pear more balanced, although it refers to mysterious “new studies” showing the dangers of marijuana. But throughout the entire course, the police officer refers to lung damage, brain damage, sterility and other unfounded claims of health damage and death being caused by marijuana. Or they report on studies detailing the cardio-pul- monary risks of using cocaine, then mention mari¬ juana smoke—unrelated except by context. Or the ‘well-intentioned’ officer tells anecdotes about people they claim to know who “started” with marijuana and ultimately destroyed their lives with hard drugs, crime and depravity; then lumps marijuana in with genuinely dangerous drugs and describes how young¬ sters or their fellow police officers were killed by these desperate, drug crazed criminals. Then they encourage the students to “help” their drug using friends and family by becoming a police informant. These kinds of indirect lies through innu¬ endo and implication are given in an off-hand man¬ ner calculated to leave a strong, permanent impres¬ sion on the sub-conscious mind, without basing it on any research or other sources that can be objectively studied or directly challenged—just a lasting, indis¬ tinct mental image. THE ULTIMATE HYPOCRISY While waging its self-styled “War on Drugs” against Third World peasants and American civil¬ ians, the Reagan/Bush/Quayle administrations have encouraged and covered up drug smuggling and distribution by high ranking officials of the U.S. government. On the one hand, Bush violated international law by invading Panama to bring reputed drug smuggler and long-time Bush/ CIA employee Manuel Noriega to the U.S. to stand trial. On the other hand, he has refused to extradite Oliver North, John Hull, Admiral Poindexter, General Secord, Lewis Tambs and other Ameri¬ cans to Costa Rica, where they are under indict¬ ment by that government for operating a drug smuggling operation there. (The Guardian, British newspaper, “Cocaine shipped by contra network,\" July 22,1989.) Federal hearings conducted by U.S. Senator John Kerry’s (MA) Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics in 1988 and 1989 documented widespread acts by the CIA and National Security Agency (NSA) to block investigations by the Customs Department and FBI into cocaine smuggling by “intelligence operatives” under the guise of national security. No indictments were ever handed down, and witnesses testified under grants of immunity with little media attention. Special Iran-Contra investigators failed to act on this information or evidence developed by the Christie Institute implicating government com¬ plicity in narco-terrorism. And when General Secord was convicted in January, 1990 for crimes related to the Iran Contra drugs-for-arms scan¬ dal, he was given a fine of $50 and a brief proba¬ tion when a federal judge decided that the poor fellow had already “suffered enough.” This from an administration that promotes the death penalty—even beheading—for marijuana dealers.* * . ■ * On the Larry King Show in late 1989, drug Czar William Bennett said he had no moral problems with beheading drug dealers...only legal ones. What makes the DARE program uniquely danger¬ ous is that it provides some accurate information and has genuine value for young people, but undermines itself and the public record by using these irresponsi¬ ble, underhanded tactics. If DARE officials want responsible behavior from students, they must also act responsibly. If they have — 75 —"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"information about marijuana that is hidden from the rest of us, let’s see it. But, so far as we know, no DARE organization has yet dared to debate any mar¬ ijuana legalization advocacy group* or include their literature in its program. * The Business Alliance for Commerce in Hemp (BACH) issued a standing challenge in early 1989 to publicly debate any DARE repre¬ sentative in the Los Angeles area, which has yet to be taken. It has also offered to provide free and accurate literature on cannabis for DARE’s use, but has still received no response. THE MEDIA IN A STUPOR Despite a strong injection of reason and fact into the cannabis debate by the media in the 1960s and 1970s, the national media has largely failed to distin¬ guish marijuana prohibition from the broader “drug war” hysteria, which ‘sold more copy* in the 1980s. Hemp activists have been ignored, their events cen¬ sored and excluded from calendar listings—even paid advertisements about events or legal, non-smoking hemp products are refused by news sources. What ever happened to fact checking? Instead of serving as the probing watchdogs of gov¬ ernment and keepers of the public trust, corporate news groups regard themselves as the profit-making tool for forging ‘consensus’ on national policy. According to groups like Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) and researchers like Ben Bakdik- ian and Michael Parenti, these corporations define and protect the “national interest”—often meaning their own vested financial interests and political agendas. It must be remembered that many of the largest publishers have direct holdings in timberland for paper development, and the pharmaceutical drug, petrochemical companies, etc. are among the media’s major advertisers. “Penalties against possession of a drug should not he more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself” —President Jimmy Carter August 2,1977 In an article published in the L.A. Times Magazine May 7, 1989 entitled “Nothing Works,” Stanley Meiseler laments the problem facing schools in drug education programs and inadvertently reveals the news media’s own assumptions and bias: “Critics believe that some education programs have been crippled by exaggerating the dangers of drugs. Principals and teachers, watched closely by city offi¬ cials, feel pressured not to teach pupils that mari¬ juana, although harmful,* is less addicting than cigarettes.... Failure to acknowledge such informa¬ tion means school programs can lose credibility. “But more honest programs could be even more harmful .” (Emphasis added.) The harm he predicts is an expected increase in consumption when people learn the health benefits and lack of physical or psychological risks involved with cannabis consumption. Many people decide that they prefer pot (which apparently does not need to advertise) to alcohol and tobacco, for which so many advertising dollars are spent. * No specific studies showing the alleged harmful effects were cited in the article. In fact, cannabis was barely mentioned except for this reference and a note that detoxification businesses report some suc¬ cess in \"breaking a mild dependence on marijuana and alcohol.” ONGOING INJUSTICE President Jimmy Carter addressed Congress on an¬ other kind of harm done by prohibition and the drug issue August 2, 1977, saying that “Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself. “Therefore, I support legislation amending federal law to eliminate all federal criminal penalties for the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana.” However, his efforts to apply even this bit of reason to America’s marijuana laws were derailed by a Congress determined to show that it is tough on crime, no matter whether an action is criminal or poses any real threat to society, no matter how many people are hurt in the process. And this attitude of intolerance and oppression has escalated in the post-Carter years. By 1990, 18 states had established “Special Alter¬ native Incarceration” (SAI) camps where non-violent, first time drug offenders are incarcerated in a boot camp-like institution, verbally abused and psycholog¬ ically worn down to break them of their dissident at¬ titude towards drug use. The inmates are handled with robotic precision, and those who don’t conform are subject to incarcera¬ tion in the state penitentiary. Most of these offenders are in for marijuana. At least 17 more states are con¬ sidering implementing similar programs.* * In These Times, “Gulag for drug users,” December 20,1989, pg 4. What has been used to “justify” this anti-American policy? A handful of official government reports and studies that are touted by the DEA, politicians and the media to show that marijuana really is “damag¬ ing to an individual.” Next, we look at some of the most famous of these studies. 76"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"I Chapter Fifteen: THE OFFICIAL STORY DEBUNKING “GUTTER SCIENCE” After 15 days of taking testimony and more than a year's legal deliberation, DEA Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young formally urged the DEA to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana in a September, 1988judgement. He ruled: “The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision.... It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this record. In strict medical terms, marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume...marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.” i Yet, on December 30,1989 DEA Administrator John Lawn refused to comply and his successors continues to deprive people of medical cannabis, based on anti-marijuana studies like these: WASTING TIME, WASTING LIVES Nearly 100 years have passed since the 1894 British Raj commission study of hashish smokers in India reported cannabis use was harmless and even helpful. Numerous studies since have all agreed: The most prominent being Siler, LaGuardia, Nixon’s Shafer Commission, Canada’s LeDain Commission and the California Research Advisory Commission. Concurrently, American presidents have praised hemp, the USDA amassed volumes of data showing its value as a natural resource, and in 1942 the Roosevelt administration even made Hemp for Victory , a film glorifying our patriotic hemp farmers. Yet even the humane use of hemp for medicine is now denied. Asked in late 1989 about the DEA’s fail¬ ure to implement his decision quoted above, Judge Young responded that administrator John Lawn was being given time to comply. More than a year after that ruling, Lawn officially refused to reschedule cannabis, again classing it as a Schedule One “dangerous” drug that is not even al¬ lowed to be used as medicine. Decrying this needless suffering of helpless Americans, the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws (NORML) and the Family Council on Drug Awareness quickly demanded Lawn’s resig¬ nation. His successor retains the policy. What hypocrisy allows public officials to scoff at the facts and deny the truth? How do they rationalize their atrocities? They invent their own experts. GOVERNMENT DOUBLESPEAK Since 1976, our federal government (e.g., NIDA, NIH, DEA* and Action), police sponsored groups (like DARE*) and special interest groups (like PDFA*) have proclaimed to public, press and parent groups alike that they have “absolute evidence” of the shocking negative effects of marijuana smoking. * National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Inst, of Health, Drug Enforcement Agency, Drug Abuse Resistance Education, Partnership for a Drug Free America. All subsequent researchers found Heath's marijuana findings to be of no value, because carbon monoxide poisoning and other factors were totally left out. When U.S. government sponsored research prior to 1976 indicated that cannabis was harmless or benefi¬ cial, the methodology of how each study was done was always presented in detail in the reports; e.g., read The Therapeutic Potential of Marijuana (1976) and you will see exactly what the methodology of each medical study was. However, when our government bureaucrats delib¬ erately sponsored negative marijuana research, time and time again Playboy magazine, NORML, High Times, etc. had to sue under the new Freedom of Information Act to find out the actual laboratory methodology these “experiments” employed. WTiat they found was shocking. — 77 —"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"DR. HEATH/TULANB STUDY, 1974 The Hype: Brain Damage and Dead Monkeys In 1974, California Governor Ronald Reagan was asked about decriminalizing marijuana. After producing the Heath/Tulane University study, the so-called “Great Communicator” proclaimed, “The most reliable scientific sources say permanent brain damage is one of the inevitable results of the use of marijuana.” (L.A. Times.) The report from Dr. Heath had con¬ cluded that Rhesus monkeys, smok¬ ing the equivalent of only 30 joints a day, began to atrophy and die after 90 days. And ever since, dead brain cells found in monkeys who were forced to smoke marijuana has been given maximum scare play in federal book¬ lets and government sponsored pro¬ paganda literature against pot. Senator Eastland of Mississippi used it throughout the mid 1970s to horrify and stop national legislators from supporting NORML’s decrimi¬ nalization bills in Congress, mostly sponsored by Senator Jacob Javitts of New York. Reports of the study have also been distributed by the hierarchy of drug rehabilitation professionals as part of their rationalization for wanting to get kids off pot, based on supposed scientific studies. It is used to terrorize parent groups, church organiza¬ tions, etc., who redistribute it still further. Heath opened the brains of the dead monkeys, counted the dead brain cells, then took control mon¬ keys who hadn’t smoked marijuana, killed them, and counted their dead brain cells. The pot smoking mon¬ keys had enormous amounts of dead brain cells as compared to the “straight” monkeys. Ronald Reagan’s pronouncement was probably based on the fact that marijuana smoking was the only difference in the two sets of monkeys. Perhaps Reagan trusted the federal research to be real and correct. Perhaps he had other motives. Whatever their reasons, this is what the govern¬ ment ballyhooed to press and PTA, who trusted the government completely. In 1980, Playboy and NORML finally received for the first time—after six years of requests and suing the government—an accurate accounting of the re¬ search procedures used in the famous report: When NORML/Playboy hired researchers to exam¬ ine the reported results against the actual methodol¬ ogy, they laughed. The Facts: Suffocation of Research Animals The Heath “Voodoo” Research methodology, as re¬ ported in Playboy: Rhesus monkeys had been strapped into a chair and pumped the equivalent of 63 Colombian strength joints in “five minutes, through gas masks,” losing no smoke. Carbon monoxide is a deadly gas that kills brain cells, given off by any burning object. At that smoke concentration the monkeys were, in effect, like a per¬ son locked in a garage with a car engine running for five, 10,15 minutes at a time every day! All researchers agree the findings in Heath’s exper¬ iment regarding marijuana are of no value, because carbon monoxide poisoning and other factors had not been considered in the report. This study and others, like Dr. Nahas’ 1970s studies, tried to somehow con¬ nect the THC metabolites routinely found in the fatty tissue of human brains, reproductive organs and oth¬ er fatty areas of the body to the dead brain cells in the suffocated monkeys. LINGERING THC METABOLITES The Hype: It Stays in Your System for 30 Days The government also claimed that since “THC metabolites” stay in the body’s fatty cells for up to 30 days after ingestion, just one joint was very danger¬ ous; inferring that the long range view of what these THC metabolites eventually could do to the human race could not even be guessed and other pseudo-sci¬ entific double-talk (e.g., phrases like: “might be,” “could mean,” “possibly,” “perhaps,” etc.)* * “May, might, could and possibly are not scientific conclusions.” Dr. Fred Oerther, M.D., September 1986. The monkeys were suffocating! Three to five min¬ utes of oxygen deprivation causes brain damage— “dead brain cells.” (Red Cross Lifesaving and Water & mm Safety manual). With the concentration of smoke used, the monkeys were a hit like a person running the engine of his car in a locked garage for 5,10,15 minutes at a time ...every day! The Heath Monkey study was actually a study in animal asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. Among other things, Heath had completely (intentionally? incompetently?) omitted discussion of the carbon monoxide the monkeys inhaled. 78 —"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Facts: Government's Own Experts Say That Metabolites Are Non-Toxic , Harmless Residue We interviewed three doctors of national reputation either currently working (or having worked) for the U.S. government on marijuana research: • Dr. Thomas Ungerlieder, M.D., UCLA, appointed by Richard Nixon in 1969 to the President’s Select Committee on Marijuana, re-appointed by Ford, Carter and Reagan, and currently head of California’^ “Marijuana Medical Program;” • Dr. Donald Tashkin, UCLA, M.D., for the last 14 years the U.S. government’s and the world’s leading marijuana researcher on pulmonary functions; and • Dr. Tod Mikuriya, M.D., former national head of the U.S. government’s marijuana research programs in the late 1960s.

This was based on the “Reefer Madness” studies done by the disreputable Dr. Gabriel Nahas of Columbia University in 1972. This is the same Dr. Nahas that claimed his stud¬ ies showed pot created chromosome, testosterone (male hormone) damage, and countless other horri¬ ble effects which suggested the breaking down of the immune system. Nahas’ background is in the OSS/CIA and later the UN where he worked closely with Lyndon LaRouche and Kurt Waldheim. Nahas is still the darling favorite of the DEA and NIDA (National Institute of Drug Abuse) yet no anti-marijuana studies of Nahas’ have ever been replicated in countless other research attempts. Columbia University specifically disassociated themselves from Nahas’ marijuana research in a specially-called press conference in 1975! Old, discredited Nahas studies are still trotted out by the Drug Enforcement Administration today, and deliberately given to unknowledgeable parents’ groups, churches, and PTA’s as valid research re¬ garding the evils of pot. The dissemination of Nahas’* dangerous horror stories is paid for with your tax dollar, even years af¬ ter the National Institute of Health (NIH) in 1976 specifically forbade Nahas from getting another pen¬ ny of U.S. government money for cannabis studies because of his embarrassing research in the early 1970s. ♦ Nahas, in December, 1983, under ridicule from his peers and a funding cut-off from NIDA renounced all his old THC metabolite build-up and unique chromosome petri dish tissue damage studies, conclusions, and extrapolations. Yet the DEA, NIDA, VISTA, the “War on Drugs,” and writer Peggy Mann (in Reader’s Digest articles and her book Marijuana Alert, with foreword by Nancy Reagan) have used these discredited studies on parent’s groups such as Parents for a Drug Free Youth, etc., often with Nahas as a highly paid guest lecturer, without a word of how his studies are really considered by his peers. This, we assume, is done to scare parents, teach¬ ers, legislators and judges, using scientific terminol¬ ogy, bogus non-clinical statistics, ultimately aimed at selling more urine testing equipment and creat¬ ing more profits for the drug-rehabilitation clinics and their staff of professionals, and to maintain funding for the DEA, local police, judicial, penal, cor¬ rections and other government pork barrel, police state interests. The War on Drugs’ is big money so the shameless petitioning for more police and more cells continue. And we still have thousands of judges, legislators, police, Reader’s Digest readers, and parents who have for years used and cited his studies in particu¬ lar as the prime reasons to continue these unjust laws and to jail millions of Americans over the last decade. The DEA, after Nahas’ 1983 waffling renounce¬ ment, consciously and criminally continues to use his studies to polarize ignorant judges, politicians, press, and parent groups, who are unaware of Nahas’ renouncement. These groups trust the gov¬ ernment to tell them the truth their tax dollars paid for. The media, press, and television commentators still use Nahas’ studies as gospel, and much of the frightening folklore and street myths that are whis¬ pered around school yards spring from this deceitful “scientists” work. Refuted and never replicated results are still taught, while the honest researcher faces prison if he attempts to test any thoughts about the medical use of cannabis. In fact, using Nahas’ refuted and unreplicated syn¬ thetic THC petri-dish studies on the immune sys¬ tem, “hysterical” Families for Drug Free Youth, or “Just Say No” organizations have gotten the press to say marijuana could cause AIDS—-which has no ba¬ sis whatsoever, but the press published all this cre¬ ating more Reefer Madness! — 79 —"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"through the liver. The leftover THC metabolites then attach themselves, in a very normal way, to fatty de¬ posits, for the body to dispose of later, which is a safe and perfectly natural process. Many chemicals from foods, herbs and medicines do this same thing all the time in your body. Most are not dangerous and THC metabolites show less toxic* potential than virtually any known metabolic left¬ overs in your body. * The U.S. government has also known since 1946 that the oral dose of cannabis required to kill a mouse is about 40,000 times the dose required to produce typical symptoms of intoxication. (Mikuriya, Tod, Marijuana Medical Papers, 1976; Loewe, journal of Pharmacological and Experimental Therapeutics, October, 1946.) THC metabolites left in the body can be compared to the ash of a cigarette: The inert ingredient left¬ over after, the active cannabinoids have been metabo¬ lized by the body. These inert metabolites are what urinary analysis studies show when taken to dis¬ charge military or factory or athletic personnel for using, or being in the presence of cannabis within the last 30 days. LUNG DAMAGE STUDIES The Hype: More Harmful Than Tobacco According to the American Lung Association cigarettes and tobacco smoking related , diseases kill 434,175 Americans every year. 50 million Americans smoke, and 3,000 teens start each day. The Berkeley carcinogenic tar studies of the late 1970s concluded that “marijuana is one-and-a-half times more carcinogenic than tobacco.” The Fact: Not One Documented Case of Cancer There are lung irritants involved in any smoke. Cannabis smoke causes mild irritation to the large airways of the lungs. Symptoms disappear when smoking is discontinued. However, unlike tobacco smoke, cannabis smoke does not cause any changes in the small airways, the area where tobacco smoke causes long term and per¬ manent damage. Additionally, a tobacco smoker will smoke 20 to 60 cigarettes a day, while a heavy mari¬ juana smoker may smoke five to seven joints a day, even less when potent high quality flower tops are available. While tens of millions of Americans smoke pot reg¬ ularly, cannabis has never caused a known case of lung cancer as of March, 1992, according to America’s foremost lung expert, Dr. Donald Tashkin of UCLA. He considers the biggest health risk to the lungs would be a person smoking 16 or more “large” spliffs a day of leaf/bud because of the hypoxia of too much smoke and not enough oxygen. Tashkin feels there is no danger for anyone to wor¬ ry about potentiating emphysema “in any way” by the use of marijuana—totally the opposite of tobacco. Cannabis is a complex, highly evolved plant. There are some 400 compounds in its smoke. Of these, 60 have therapeutic value. Cannabis may also be eaten, entirely avoiding the irritating effects of smoke. However, four times more of the active ingredients of smoked cannabis are ab¬ sorbed by the human body than is when the same amount is eaten. And the prohibition inflated price of black market cannabis, combined with harsh penal¬ ties for cultivation, prevent most people from being able to afford the luxury of a less efficient, though healthier, means of ingestion. Lab Studies Fail To Reflect the Real World Virtually all the carcinogens can be removed by us¬ ing a water pipe system. Our government omitted this information and its significance to the results of such studies when speaking to the press. At the same time politicians outlawed the sale of water pipes, la¬ beling them ‘drug paraphernalia.’ How Rumors Get Started In 1976, Dr. Tashkin sent a written report to Dr. Gabriel Nahas at the Rheims, France, Conference on Potential Cannabis Medical Dangers. That report be¬ came the most sensationalized story to come out of this negative world conference on cannabis. This surprised Tashkin, who had sent the report to the Rheims conference as an afterthought. What Tashkin reported to the Rheims conference was that one of 29 pulmonary areas of the human lung he studied found marijuana 15 times more an irritant than tobacco—the large air passageway. (Tashkin, Dr. Donald, UCLA studies, 1969-83; UCLA Pulmonary Studies, 1969-90.) However, Tashkin notes that tobacco has little ef¬ fect on this area and cannabis has a positive or neu¬ tral effect in most other areas of the lung. (See chap¬ ter 7, “Therapeutic Uses of Cannabis.”) Afterwards, the U.S. government resumed funding for ongoing cannabis pulmonary studies which they had cut two years earlier, when Tashkin reported en¬ couraging therapeutic results with marijuana/lung studies—but now limited the research to the large air passageway. We have interviewed Dr. Tashkin numerous times. In 1986 I asked him about an article he was prepar¬ ing for the New England Journal of Medicine, indi¬ cating that cannabis smoke caused as many or more pre-cancerous lesions as tobacco in ‘equal’ amounts. Most people do not realize, nor are the media told, that any tissue abnormality (abrasion, eruption, or even redness) is called a pre-cancerous lesion. Unlike — 80"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"lesions caused by tobacco, the THC-related lesions contain no radioactivity. We asked Tashkin how many people had gone on to get lung cancer in these or any other studies of long¬ term smokers like Rastas, Coptics, etc. Dr. Tashkin, sitting in his UCLA laboratory, looked at me and said, “That’s the strange part. So far no one we’ve studied has gone on to get lung cancer.” “Was this reported to the press?” “Well, it’s in the article,” Dr. Tashkin said. “But no one in the press even asked. They just assumed the worst.” Another Fact: Emphysema Sufferers Benefit During a later interview, Tashkin congratulated us on the tip that marijuana used for emphysema pro¬ duced good results among people we knew. He had presumed that marijuana aggravated em¬ physema, but after reviewing his evidence found that, except in the rarest of instances, marijuana ac¬ tually benefitted emphysema sufferers due to the opening and dilation of the bronchial passages. And so the relief reported to us by cannabis smok¬ ing emphysema patients was confirmed. Marijuana smoke is not unique in its benefits to the lungs. Yerba Santa, Colt’s foot, Hoarhound and other herbs have traditionally been smoked to help the lungs. Tobacco and its associated dangers have so preju¬ diced people against ‘smoking’ that most people be¬ lieve cannabis smoking to be as or more dangerous than tobacco. With research banned, these public health and safety facts are not readily available. AND SO ON Most of the anti-marijuana literature we have ex¬ amined does not cite as much as one single source for us to review. Others only refer to DEA or NIDA. The few studies we have been able to track down usually end up being anecdotal case histories, artificial groupings of data or otherwise lacking controls Reports of breast enlargement, obesity, addiction and the like all remain unreplicated, and are given little credence by the scientific community. Other re¬ ports, like the temporary reduction in sperm count, are statistically insignificant to the general public, yet get blown far out of proportion when presented by the media. Still others, like the handful of throat tumors in the Sacramento area and the high rate of injuries reported in a Baltimore trauma unit are iso¬ lated clusters that run contrary to all other statistics. The spurious results of Heath, Nahas and the preg¬ nant mice and monkey studies at Temple University RADIOACTIVE TOBACCO: THE UNTOLD STORY Tobacco smoking kills more people each year than AIDS, heroin, crack, cocaine, alcohol, car accidents, fire and murder combined. Cigarette smoking is as addictive as heroin, complete with withdrawal symptoms, and the percentage of relapses (75%) is the same as for “kicking” cocaine and heroin users. It is far and away the number one cause of pre¬ ventable death in- the U.S. today. Tobacco smokers have ten times the lung cancer of non-smokers, twice the heart disease and are three times more likely to die of heart disease if they do develop it. Yet tobacco is totally legal, and even receives the highest U.S. government farm subsidies of any agri¬ cultural product in America, all the while being our biggest killer! What total hypocrisy! In the U.S. one in seven deaths are caused by smoking cigarettes. Women should know that lung cancer is more common than breast cancer in wom¬ en who smoke and that smoking on the pill increas¬ es cancer and heart risks dramatically. Seven million dollars a day promotes the tobacco business, and it is estimated that the cigarette in¬ dustry needs about one thousand new smokers a day to replace those who die each day from smoking. Kentucky’s principal business and agriculture for 100 years (until 1890) was the healthful, versatile and useful cannabis hemp. It has since been re¬ placed by non-edible, non-fibrous, soil-depleting to¬ bacco, which is grown by law in soil fertilized with radioactive materials. U.S. government studies have shown that a pack- and-a half of tobacco cigarettes per day over a year for just one year is the equivalent to your lungs of what some 300 chest x-rays (using the old, slow x- ray film and without using any lead protection) are to your skin. But while an x-ray dissipates its radioactivity instantly, tobacco has a radioactive half-life that will remain active in the lungs for 21.5 years. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said on national television that radioactivity is probably responsible for most tobacco-related cancer. No radioactivity exists in cannabis tars.

SOME STUDIES THE FEDS DON’T TALK ABOUT THE COPTIC STUDY (1981) No Harm to Human Brain or Intelligence Hemp has been used in virtually all societies since time immemorial as a work motivator and to high¬ light and renew creative energies. (Jamaican study; Coptic study; Costa Rican study; Vedas; Dr. Vera Rubin, Research Institute for the Study of Man; et al) In 1981, a study showed that 10 of America’s heavi¬ est pot smokers (from the Coptic religion and resid¬ ing in Florida) actually believed that using 16 huge high potency spliffs* a day had improved their minds somewhat over a period of 10 years. They were studied by Drs. Ungerlieder and Shaeffer (UCLA) and showed absolutely no brain dif¬ ferences between them and non-smokers—nor did it confirm any increase in IQ that the Coptics had claimed. * One spliff is generally equal to five average American joints. Longer Life, Fewer Wrinkles Most studies (matched populations, past and pre¬ sent) indicate that—everything else being equal—an average American pot smoker will live longer than his counterpart who does no drugs at all; with less wrinkles, and generally have less stress—thereby having fewer illnesses to upset the immune system, and be a more peaceful neighbor. (Costa Rican and Jamaican Studies.) JAMAICAN STUDIES (1968-74, 1975) Definite Benefits For Marijuana Smokers The most exhaustive study of hemp smoking in its natural setting is probably “Ganja in Jamaica-A Medical Anthropological Study of Chronic Marijuana Use” by Vera Rubin and Lambros Comitas (1975; Mouton & Co., The Hague, Paris/Anchor Books, NY). “The Jamaica study, sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Center for Studies of Narcotic and Drug Abuse was the first project in medical anthropology to be undertaken and is the first intensive, multi-disciplinary study of marijuana use and users to be published.” “Despite it’s illegality, ganja use is pervasive, and duration and frequency are very high, it is smoked over a longer period in heavier quantities with greater THC potency than in the U.S. without delete¬ rious social or psychological consequences. The major difference is that both use and expected behaviors are culturally conditioned and controlled by well es¬ tablished tradition.” (From the introduction.) “No impairment of physiological, sensory and perceptual-motor performance, tests of concept formation, abstracting ability and cognitive style and tests of memory.” Positive Social Attitudes The study outlines the positive reinforcement given socially to ganja smokers in Jamaica, the universal praise for the practice among users, who smoke it as a work motivator. Subjects described the effects of smoking making them “brainier” lively, merry, more responsible and conscious. They reported it was good for meditation and concentration, and created a gen¬ eral sense of well-being and self-assertiveness. No Link to Criminal Behavior Vera Rubin and her colleagues found no relation of cannabis to crime (except marijuana busts), no im¬ pairment of motor skills, and that smokers and non- smokers alike had identical extroversion scores with no difference in work records or adjustment. Heavy use of ganja was not found to curtail the motivation to work. From the psychological assessment the smokers seemed to be more open in their expressions of feel¬ ings, somewhat more carefree and somewhat more distractable. There was no evidence of organic brain damage or schizophrenia. No Physiological Deterioration Marilyn Bowman, in a battery of psychological tests on chronic cannabis users in Jamaica in 1972 found “No impairment of physiological, sensory and percep¬ tual-motor performance, tests of concept formation, abstracting ability and cognitive style and tests of memory.” These Jamaicans had smoked anywhere from six to 31 years (16.6 mean average) and the av- — 82"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"erage age at the first puff was at 12 years and six months. In the 1975 study between users and non-users, no difference was found in plasma testosterone, no differ¬ ence in total nutrition, slightly higher performance on the intelligence sub-tests (not statistically significant) and “A basic measure of cell-mediated immunity ...was no less vigorous in the users...” Finally, “Users in our matched pair sample smoked marijuana in addition to as many tobacco cigarettes as did their partners. Yet their airways were, if anything, a bit healthier than their matches. “We must tentatively conclude either that marijuana has no harmful effects on such passages dr that it ac¬ tually offers some slight protection against the harm¬ ful effects of tobacco smoke. Only further research will clarify which, if either, is the case.” No “Stepping Stone”I Gateway Effect As to the stepping-stone or gateway drug charges lev¬ eled against cannabis: ‘The use of hard drugs is as yet virtually unknown among working class Jamai¬ cans—no. one in the study (Rubin’s) had ever taken any narcotics, stimulants, hallucinogens, barbiturates or sleeping pills...” In America during the late 1800s cannabis was used in treating addiction. Opiate, chloral hydrate and alco¬ hol addicts were successfully treated with potent cannabis extracts. Some patients recovered with less than a dozen doses of cannabis extract. 1 Likewise, smoking cannabis has been found to be valuable in modem alcohol addiction treatment. 2 COSTA RICAN STUDY (1980) The Jamaican results were largely confirmed by an¬ other Carribean study, the 1980 “Cannabis in Costa Rica—A Study in Chronic Marijuana Use” edited by William Carter for the Institute for Study of Human Issues. (ISHI, 3401 Science Center, Philadelphia.) Again researchers found no palpable damage to the native population’s chronic cannabis smokers. Alcoholic social problems, so evident on neighboring cannabis-free islands, are not found in Costa Rica. This study makes clear that socially approved ganja use will largely replace the use of alcohol (rum) if available. THE AMSTERDAM MODEL Since adopting a policy of tolerance and non-prosecu¬ tion of cannabis/hashish smokers (it is available in cafes and bars) and rehabilitation and diversion pro¬ grams for hard drug users, Holland has seen a sub¬ stantial reduction in cannabis consumption among teenagers 3 and a 33% drop in the number of heroin ad¬ dicts. The strategy of separating cannabis sales from hard drug dealers by bringing pot above-ground has been quite successful. (L.A. Times, August, 1989.)

Scientific American reported in 1990: “the alarm¬ ing statistics cited by testing advocates to demon¬ strate the high costs of drug abuse ... do not always accurately reflect the research on which they are based. In fact, some of the data could be used to ‘prove’ that drug use has negligible or even benefi¬ cial effects.” (March, pg. 18, see appendix pg. 176.) One of the examples given is the often used statis¬ tic President George Bush utilized in 1989: “drug abuse among American workers costs businesses anywhere from $60 billion to $100 billion a year in lost productivity, absenteeism, drug-related acci¬ dents, medical claims and theft.” Yet according to a 1989 assessment by NIDA all such claims derive from a single study that grew out of a 1982 survey of 3,700 households. The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) found that households where at least one person admitted hav- Yet the RTI survey also included questions about current drug use.

In all the research this author has done about the misapplication of public funds and trusts, nothing, it seems, compares with the either totally ignorant or willful manslaughter of fellow Americans by the bu¬ reaucrats and politicians of the following story: ONE MAN & HIS DRUG SCAMS The U.S. government policy, starting in the Nixon and Ford administrations and continuing under Carlton Turner* (Drug Czar under Reagan 1981- 1986), allowed federal medical marijuana, supplied to the individual state marijuana medical programs, to consist only of the leaf of the marijuana plant, even though it’s usually only one-third as strong as the bud and doesn’t contain the same whole spectrum of the “crude drug,” i.e. the THC and CBNs. • Prior to becoming Special White House Advisor (read: National Drug Czar) Carlton Turner, from 1971 to 1980, was the head of all U.S. govt, marijuana grown for drugs by reason of his position at the University of Mississippi. The U. of Mississippi Marijuana Research Program is directed by state charter to discover —initiate or sort out the constituents of THC—a “simple” crude Cannabis drug that works as a medicine—then synthe¬ size the substances with beneficial medi¬ cal properties to attain their full potential for pharmaceutical companies. For example, the leafs’ relief of ocular pressure for glaucoma patients is much shorter lasting and therefore unsatisfactory, compared to the bud. Also, the leaf sometimes gives smokers a headache. The federal govern¬ ment until 1986 used only the leaf. Turner said to the pharmaceutical companies and in interviews, that leaf is all Americans would ever get—although the bud works better. The reasons given: • Buds are too hard to roll through a cigarette ma¬ chine. (Forget the 25 million Americans who do quite well at rolling bud everyday.) • By extracting compounds from the “crude drug” of the bud, there would be no pharmaceutical patents, therefore no profits. Therefore, his program would have worked against his former employers, the Miss¬ issippi University’s legislative charter and funding. (Interviews by Ed Rosenthal for High Times Magazine; Dean Latimer, et al; National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.) Although buds work better for chemotherapy, glau- It also became evident the famous marijuana ‘munchies’ (appetite stimulation) were not working for the cancer chemotherapy patients using federal leaf. And even though no studies have been allowed to compare leaf with bud, we know of doctors who unof¬ ficially recommend bud and watch their wasting can¬ cer patients put on weight (NORML). Poisoning Pot Smokers In August and September, 1983, Turner went on national television to justify the illegal marijuana spraying (by plane) of paraquat in Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee by the DEA. He said it was a kid’s deserved punishment if he died from paraquat poisoned pot, to teach him a lesson. Turner was forced to resign after announcing his conclusions in public that marijuana caused homosexuality, the breakdown of the immune system and, therefore, AIDS. Looking into the therapeutic potential of cannabis is the most controlled and discour¬ aged research, but any tests pursuing negative or harmful effects of cannabis are promot¬ ed. Since these tests often back¬ fire or are inconclusive, even this research is rare. Turner quoted “The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire” to show how jazz (rock) singers are eroding the America “he” loves with this hallucinogenic drug— marijuana! which he meant to stamp out. Phony Paraquat Kits During the 1978 Mexican marijuana paraquat scare, and while still a private citizen working for the State of Mississippi marijuana farm, this same Carlton Turner called High Times magazine to ad¬ vertise a paraquat tester. Unknown to Turner, High Times was not accepting ads for any paraquat testers because all evidence showed the testers didn’t work. Dean Latimer—then a High Times associate editor, BUSH STRIKES AGAIN President Ronald Reagan, at the urging of then \"Vice President George Bush, ap¬ pointed Carlton Turner as the White House Drug (czar) Advisor in 1981. At conventions (1981-1986) of pharma¬ ceutical companies and their lobbyist the American Chemical Manufacturers, Turner promised to continue the research ban on the 400 chemical compounds of cannabis. Bush has managed to continue to direct this effort, simply by not allowing any grants for private or public research with a positive implication to be issued by NIDA or NIH, or approved any recent FDA applications unless they pursue negative results. 84 —"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"strung Turner along in virtually daily phone conver¬ sations for a month, listening to Turner talk about how much money Turner was going to make from sales of the device.

When Turner delivered his prototype version of the paraquat test kit to High Times, it was a to¬ tal “Rube Goldberg” type rip- off, “just like the dozen or so phony kits other companies tried to buy ad space for at this time.” wrote Latimer in an article published in 1984. Turner apparently never thought High Times was eth¬ ical enough to check the con¬ traption out. He assumed they would just take the ad money and run—print the ad and make Turner rich. He didn’t care if some kid died or was bilked out of money believing in his bogus paraquat test kit. After this attempted mail fraud, this man became President Reagan’s national drug czar in 1981, recom¬ mended by George Bush and Nancy Reagan. A Wanton Disregard For Life Turner even said that he doesn’t even care if hundreds of kids die from smoking pot the federal government has deliberately sprayed with paraquat. Then at the April 25, 1985 PRIDE conference in Atlanta, Georgia, with Nancy Reagan and 16 foreign First Ladies in attendance (including Imelda Marcos), Turner called for the death penalty for drug dealers. Turner was, after all, Reagan’s, Bush’s and the pharmaceutical companies’ own hired gun, who saw his entire mission as not against heroin, PCP or co¬ caine, but to wipe out pot and jazz/rock music...

This kind of business de¬ nies the basic rights of privacy, self-incrimination (Fifth Amendment) rights, unreasonable search and seizure and the presumption of innocence (until proven guilty). Submission to the humiliation of having your most private body parts and functions observed by a hired voyeur is now the test of eligibility for private em¬ ployment, or to contract for a living wage. Turner’s new money making scheme demands that all other Americans relinquish their fundamental right to privacy and self-respect. COMPARISON TO ALCOHOL There are many terrible drug habits. The worst of which is alcohol, in both numbers of users and the anti-social behavior associated with extreme use. Alcoholism is the leading cause of teen-age deaths. 8,000 American teenagers are killed each year and 40,000 are maimed from mixing alcohol and driving. (MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving; SADD, Students Against Drunk Driving; NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse; etc.) In fact, U.S. goverament/police statistics con¬ firm the following strange numbers: The mortality figures for alcohol use are 100,000 annually, compared with zero mari¬ juana deaths in 10,000 years of consumption. From 40% to 50% of all murders and high¬ way fatalities are alcohol related. In fact, high¬ way fatalities that are alcohol related might be as high as 90%, according to the Chicago Tribune and LA Herald Examiner. Alcohol is also indicated in the majority (69% to 80%) of all child rape/incest cases; wife beat¬ ing incidents are in the great majority (60% to 80%) alcohol influenced. Heroin is indicated in 35% of burglaries, rob¬ beries, armed robberies, bank robberies, grand theft auto, etc. And there were 324,000 arrests for simple marijuana possession in the U.S. in 1988, ac¬ cording to the Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics of the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"PEOPLE HAVE PEACEFULLY SMOKED MARIJUANA FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS What does it mean to drive a plant species to extinction?

In this chapter, we bring to light some research that the government does not like people to know about. Then we talk about some realistic alternatives. But first, a brief fable: THE STORY OF THE EMPEROR’S NEW CLOTHES * There once was a terrible king who heavily taxed his subjects in order to pay for his incredibly fine wardrobe of expensive clothing. One day, two swindlers, representing themselves as great tailors from afar, arrived and sought an audi¬ ence with the king. They told of an amazing new fab¬ ric they had invented, made of a very expensive gold fiber that only the best, purest and wisest of people could see. Excited, the king asked to see a sample, and the men brought forth an empty spool. “Ah, isn’t it lovely,” they asked the king. The king agreed, afraid to admit that he did not see anything because that would mean he was a dull and stupid person. So, to test his ministers the king brought them all in to get their opinions. Once the power of the fabric was explained to them, all agreed that this was, in¬ deed, the finest and most beautiful cloth in the world. The king ordered a new outfit be made for him, so the tailors took his measurements and ordered the gold from the treasury be given to the tailors to be spun into thread. They set about at once working day after day, pretending to cut and sew, while the king and his ministers periodically came by to admire their handiwork—and to pay the enormous bills the merchants were running up in the course of their ac¬ tivities. Finally, the big day came when all the people in the land were ordered gathered to see the king’s new outfit, which they had paid so much for and heard so much about. When he nakedly strode forth, all the people looked in disbelief and said nothing. Then they sang the praises of the miraculous new cloth. “It’s the most beautiful work I’ve ever seen!” “Magnificent!” “I wish I had such lovely fabric!” They all cheered, afraid of being denounced and called stupid if they did otherwise. And the king proudly paraded in front of his sub¬ jects, secretly worried—afraid that he would lose the crown if the people knew that he, himself, could not see the cloth that draped his body. Until he passed a small boy, who in his innocence cried out, “But he has nothing on!” “Just hear what the innocent says!” said the father. And each person whispered to another what the child had said. Then, everyone knew that the king and all his min¬ isters had been tricked by swindlers. Now the people realized that the swindlers had not only tricked the king, but he had spent all their tax money, wasted on this farce. The king heard the people murmuring. He knew they were right, but he was too proud to admit he was wrong and had been made the fool. So he contin¬ ued to be the fool. The king held his head high and looked down his nose at the crowd, determined to save his royal face from public himiliation. The king continued the pro¬ cession acting as though he were oblivious to his nakedness, and his ministers held the train of his in¬ visible cloak higher than ever. The people looked on in disblief and did nothing as the king and his minis¬ ters kept marching down the street parading their naked ignorance. * Paraphrased from Hans Christian Andersen’s Fairy Tale. — 87 —"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE LOGICAL ANALOGY We say the marijuana/hemp laws are like the em¬ peror, and he wears no clothes! Like tyrants and pro¬ hibitionists in the past, this emperor relies on brute force and a police state to maintain his authoritarian, despotic reign while draining the federal treasury and dismantling all vestiges of the Bill of Rights. This great country was founded on the principles that each person has “inalienable rights” to “life, lib¬ erty, and the pursuit of happiness,” and that each person has the responsibility of maintaining these rights by casting their individual ballot. It is a criminal offense for officials or executives of the U.S. Government to direct or conspire to wage a deliberate campaign of misinformation, omissions and outright lies with our tax dollars. George Bush (the Emperor), Nancy Reagan (the Queen of Hearts of Alice In Wonderland —“sentence now, verdict later”), Bill Martinez (the Prime Minister), and their advisors are all wearing the “pure fabric that only the ‘purest eyes’ may see,” wo¬ ven for them by Anslinger/DuPont/Hearst and their police-state bureaucrats and now maintained by en¬ ergy, pharmaceutical, drug re-hab professionals, testers and DEA police-state interests. When a government bureaucrat deliberately acts or conspires this way—be they President, Vice Pres¬ ident, National Drug Czar or head of the FBI, or CIA—they should be jailable, at least in an honest American society. Our Federal bureaucracies and the U.S. Supreme Court have taken away more of our Bill of Rights freedoms (written on hemp paper), us¬ ing marijuana as their principal excuse than all oth¬ er crimes, spies, and wars for the last 200 years com¬ bined! And it is worse in our satellite Central and South American countries, where their leaders have done this at America’s official bidding. In Conclusion: TRUTH & CONSEQUENCES OF PROHIBITION When DuPont tells you that they bring “Better Living Through Chemistry,” they don’t tell you that it’s only for 100 years, then the entire planet dies while they profit. England and Holland treat their substance abusers as people—keeping them supplied with enough so they don’t disrupt the activities of others. These poli¬ cies are now firmly established, effective and popular in those countries. Switzerland has begun its own ex¬ periments in localized tolerance of public drug use. So, why should otherwise peaceful hemp growers and users be labeled and persecuted as lifetime crim¬ inals while 35% of all robberies and burglaries are committed by heroin addicts, 40% to 50% of murders, rapes and highway fatalities are alcohol related* and heroin is more available in jail than on the streets? * FBI Statistics, 1986. In fact, aside from cannabis usage, take the mob and the dealers out of heroin and other drugs and you reduce much of the crime that is not alcohol re¬ lated. The murder rate rose consistently throughout the “Roaring Twenties” era of alcohol prohibition, then dropped every year for the next 10 after its re¬ peal.* * FBI Statistics. Let’s find another way to deal with drug usage; or be prepared to give up our freedoms, books, songs, and keep our escalating energy bills. Accept the fact that all crime related to drugs decreases if you treat addicts without taking them out of society. Instead, help them be financially productive. HIGH-TECH REPRESSION In order for America to be marijuana free, all of us, smokers and non-smokers alike, will have to give up our Bill of Rights...forever! You will have to conform to the likes of Lyndon LaRouches, Jerry Falwells Nancy Reagan Edwin Meese and minds of that ridiculous ilk. The computer that should be our friend will allow the police to finish, today, the job the Roman Catholic Church’s Inquisition started because the church could not stand the “commons” laughing at them, or knowing the secrets of, among other things, hygiene, hemp, etc.;* and by blackmailing and bribing politi¬ cians and judges (and other VIPs) for their private sex lives in order to have more power to bring Orwell’s nightmare “1984” to fruition. * See chapter 11, “Dark Ages.” WASTING OUR TAX MONEY Yet approximately 50% of all drug enforcement money, federal and state, is directed at marijuana....

Hearst’s and Anslinger’s propaganda and lies have been relentlessly jammed down the throats of all of us—for the last three generations of Americans—as unimpeachable gospel truth... Some radio and television preachers have called rock music “satanic and voodoo.” They want to out¬ law rock, bum albums and books, and lock up every¬ one who doesn’t agree with them. So does Carlton Turner. So does Lyndon LaRouche. So does William Bennett. And virtually every state is in the midst of the biggest prison expansion in its history, while political vultures demand that we build more prisons and ex¬ pand tax bases to pursue this madness with vigor... DOUBLE STANDARDS As an example the physical dependency and mental effects of using opium, morphine, heroin, Dilaudad, Placidyl, Quaaludes, et al., are virtually the same. In essence, they disturb the body’s \"endorphin\" (pain-receptors and nullifiers) balance. However, when U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist was “nodding off’ in court—and sending other druggies to prison for their habits—he just kept feeding his “eight-a-day\" Placidyl habit: the equivalent in dollars, “high,” and mental effect of a $70 to $125 a-day “street abuser” heroin habit. Placidyl, quaalude’s cousin, is a ‘heavy down,’ popu¬ lar on the streets for its placid nature. Rehnquist wasn’t seen robbing liquor stores, physi¬ cally injuring his fellow citizens, or doing any of the anti-social behaviors attributed to “junkies.” His habit was easily maintained because the Placidyl was both available and within his normal in¬ come limits. It was also well labeled as to amount and dosage, while people with outlawed drug habits have to get by on a “dime of tar” or some such dan¬ gerous estimate. The government also acknowledges that 80% of overdoses by illegal drugs would probably be avoided with accurate labels and appropriate warnings. POLICIES BASED ON IGNORANCE While researching this book, we talked with and questioned senators, legislators, judges, police, D.A.S, scientists, historians, Nobel Prize winners, dentists, and M.D.s. All knew little bits and pieces of the histo¬ ry and uses of cannabis, but virtually no one knew any depth about marijuana in its 360 degree entirety except long term medical researchers, such as Ungerlieder, Mikuriya, et al; and writers like Ed Rosenthal, Dean Latimer, Michael Aldrich, et al. At a large California NORML fundraiser in Febru¬ ary, 1983, we spoke privately with then Senate Majority Whip Tom Rutherford, of New Mexico. He has been a leading pro-marijuana politician for a decade and was then probably the most knowledge¬ able elected government representative regarding hemp in the United States. We asked him why the government didn’t just come out and legalize hemp, especially with everything we knew medically, indus¬ trially and historically about hemp. We were shocked when he replied there really isn’t much argument for the legalization of hemp, that he knew—just decriminalization. So we outlined the entire story of hemp/marijuana to him, figuring he must have heard some of it be¬ fore. He sat in awe of what was being said. When we finished, he said, “If I had that knowledge outlined for me as you just told it, the government, police and judicial system would be through...on pot. “But is it true?” This was in February, 1983 and here were Ameri¬ ca’s politicians who literally didn’t know enough about hemp to fill a couple of pages of a book with generalities, yet they left office before they felt they could publicly back marijuana. But they do know the present laws are unjustifiable and that the government’s position on pot is menda¬ cious (false) yellow journalism. WHAT IS THE LAW? “All laws which can be violated without doing any one any injury are laughed at.” —Spinoza, (c. 1660.) To control marijuana is to give up our freedoms, for ourselves, our kids, and our kid’s kids, forever. And that, my friends, is called fascism; and simply put, if the laws on cannabis are not overturned im¬ mediately, our planet dies at the hands of these igno¬ rant (not-knowing) politicians who think they have a right to pass more and more Draconian laws to fill more and more Draconian jails with some of our most patriotic citizens. But to truly understand why tens of millions of de¬ cent Americans are scared silly of pot after 50 years of disinformation that continues to this day, consider the character of Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, who has admitted to helping direct a program of squashing accurate hemp information and order¬ ing the arrest and harassment of California Marijuana Initiative workers for doing their civic and Constitutional duty to collect petition signatures. 89"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE SMITHSONIAN’S SUPPRESSION OF FACTS ABOUT CANNABIS HEMP It should be noted that, even though 50-80% of all their displayed fibers for paper and cloth from their \"Life in America; 1780s to the 1800s” exhibit and \"American Maritime Exhibit, 1492-1850” were made of hemp, the Smithsonian Institution has re¬ moved all mention of cannabis hemp as it was used in paper and textiles, referring to it only as \"other fibers” while cotton, wool, flax, sisal, jute, Manila hemp, etc. are specifically named. Museum curator Arkadero’s response when ques¬ tioned on this topic was that, “Children don’t need to know about hemp anymore, it confuses them,” and the director of the Smithsonian said that even though hemp was the primary fiber, “We are not a fiber museum.” He did not mention how they had determined .... ...... ......... ■ ■ . . ■ .• v. . .. • ■ .*.• w ■ • ■ . •. .•.•.v.*.-.- that children do need to know about the minor fiber crops in American history. Were children’s innocent questions about hemp and marijuana making the Smithsonian tour guides uncomfortable? And in a June 20, 1989 letter, Institution secre¬ tary Robert McCormic Adams wrote that, “We do not see a cataloging of fibers in early America as part of our task” in presenting these exhibits. “At times this focus does lead curators to mention fabrics—such as linen, wool or others.” He returned copies of this book and the U.S. gov¬ ernment’s own 1942 pro-marijuana film, Hemp for Victory to us, apparently without reviewing any of the information. In January, 1984, Gates was asked by a parent at a San Fernando Valley, CA, public school, “What can I do if I find out my child has used marijuana?” He replied, “It’s too late. Once they’ve smoked one mari¬ juana cigarette, they are lost to us forever!”* * These exact words were also used by LA County DA. Ira Reiner in his 1990 campaign for State Attorney General. He lost. In September, 1983, on television and through a po¬ lice spokesman, Gates called hemp reform advocates “well-intentioned but terribly naive regarding mari¬ juana and really don’t know much about it.” A few months after California attorney general Van de Kamp suppressed the August 17, 1990 report by his own advisory panel that called for hemp re-legal¬ ization, Gates testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on September 5 that pot smok¬ ers should “be taken out and shot.” He held to this position for almost a week, until public outcry for his dismissal* forced him to modify his comment to a call for stricter penalties on smokers. A few months later, on March 3, 1991, the world was shocked to see a video of Los Angeles police savagely beating Rodney King, accused of speeding. A urine test later revealed traces ofTHC.... * Reiner was almost the only official to publicly support Gates. CONCLUSION On the basis of the information provided in this book, we demand an end to the enforcement of these prohibition laws. All laws respecting the cultivation of the plant must be stricken from the books, inclu¬ ding the UN’s Single Convention Treaty of 1961. We owe an apology to all people who did jail or prison time, had to go through the courts, had their education, families and professions torn apart and their fives, wealth and health often destroyed. We even owe an apology to honest-but-ignorant po¬ lice and judges for our willingness to keep them igno¬ rant by letting our government bureaucrats act ille¬ gally in censoring or denying the true nature of hemp which has resulted in their deliberate misuse of tax revenues intended for studies to find out the truth of hemp for 60 years now. WHAT JUSTICE DEMANDS Nothing but the lifting of all penalties (criminal and civil) and restraint upon the cultivation and use —both smoking and non-smoking—of this remark¬ able plant will be acceptable. Prisoners being held for the peaceful possession, sale, transport or cultivation of cannabis hemp must be released immediately. Money and property seized must be returned. Criminal records must be wiped clean, and reparations paid for time served; for these are the real victims of this monstrous crime called the “War on Drugs.” In the end, half measures will not be acceptable. In the meantime, we must have a moratorium on hemp law enforcement. And we must move swiftly to restore and expand the national archives and histori¬ cal record on hemp and its valuable uses. WHAT YOU CAN DO We think that, now that you’ve had a good look at our side and the government’s side (both as we see it and as the media projects it), you’ll want to join us in putting this issue onto the ballots and into the legis¬ latures of this country, where everyone can express their opinions in the straight forward manner set 90"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"forth in our United States’ and individual state con¬ stitutions.

Give credit for good votes and coverage, and complain about bad. Register and vote. Run for office. Demand that our prisoners of conscience be freed and rewarded and honored. They deserve a hero’s welcome, all the veterans’ benefits and rights of this ‘war on drugs’—not the DEA or police. For if these outlaw citizens had not defied the government and preserved the hemp seed, our government and its prohibitionist policies would have eradicated this plant from Earth. So, our Robin Hood hero is not William Bennett or Nancy Reagan, but those who defied them. They must have their life and property returned. These people must be remembered for all time by each one of us for defying these tyrannical laws. For they saved the seed that’s going to save the planet. Hemp for Victory. Let our people go. Let our people grow. And never let us or our politicians again impose these fanatical prohibition laws against any natural substance in its natural form. We almost lost the seed and knowledge to save the planet. Democracy doesn't work—ever—unless it is honest.

Bock | ‘ ve just finished watching a film made in 1942 for the US Dept, of Agriculture. “Hemp for Victory” was made to encourage US farmers to grow hemp and showed in detail how to grow, harvest, and process it. According to the film, “patriotic farmers, at the government’s re¬ quest, planted 36,000 acres of seed hemp\" in 1942, and the goal was 50,000 acres in 1943. The government also exulted over 14,000 acres of fiber hemp in 1942 and urged farmers to go for 300,000 acres in 1943. Did you read about any of this in your government school history books? Hemp, of course, is marijuana. The federal campaign to stamp out marijuana began in 1937. Why the 1942 glamorization of this plant which, as the film put it “was al¬ ready old in the service of mankind” thousands of years ago? The reason, of course, was World War H. The Japanese held the Phili- pines (source of Manila hemp, made from a different plant) and much of eastern Asia (source of hemp and other fibers). The Navy needed rope and the Army needed thread for shoes and boots. Hemp was also used for fire hoses, parachute webbing, tents, and backpacks. Chances are when George Bush bailed out over the South Pacific, he relied on a parachute webbing made from a marijuana plant. It turns out that hemp is one of the most useful and versatile plants around, and people have known this for thousands of years. For centuries all the ships that sailed the Western seas were rigged with hempen rope and sails. (The very word “canvas” is derived from the Greek and Latin words for hemp, “cannabis.” Check any decent dictionary.) Most of the linen made before 1937 was made from hemp, rather than flax. The prairie schooners that opened the West were covered with hempen can¬ vas; the Bibles the pioneers carried were probably printed on hemp pa¬ per. The first two drafts of the Decla¬ ration of Independence were written on hemp paper; the final version went onto parchment. Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were required by law to grow hemp, because every part of the plant is useful. The seeds are al- S i n ce 1937, about half the forests in the world have been cut down to make paper. If hemp had not been outlawed, most would still be standing, oxygenating the planet. most as good a source of protein as soybeans and are much cheaper; oil from the seeds was widely used for paints and varnishes. All this is not too hard to discover. The Encyclopaedia Britannica has most of it if you check cross-refer¬ ences for a couple of hours. But hard¬ ly any American knows any of it, and most Americans will find it incredi¬ ble. The history and useful aspects of hemp have been shoved down the American memory hole almost as ef¬ fectively as knowledge was sup¬ pressed inthe-Dark Ages or erased in Orwell’s 1984. Most history books, if they discuss useful fibers in our early history, will refer to cotton, wool, flax, jute, sisal, manila, and “other fibers.” “Other fibers\" means hemp, which was, in fact, the dominant fiber crop in the US until about 1840. It began to be displaced by cotton after the inven¬ tion of the cotton gin, which enor¬ mously reduced the cost of removing the seeds from the usable fiber. Hemp fiber had to be beaten out of the stalks by hand, a physically wearing and labor-intensive job. As US farmers became more afflu¬ ent and farming more mechanized, hemp cultivation gradually died out here, surviving in countries with very large, poorly paid peasant work forces. In 1916, the US Dept, of Agriculture (Bulletin No. 404) announced a new method for making paper from hemp “hurds” or pulp, and predicted that if a machine for stripping hemp were developed, it would be unnecessary to cut down forests to make paper. By the mid-1950s, state-of-the-art stripping and pulp-saving machinery was available. According to an arti¬ cle in the February 1938 Popular Me¬ chanics magazine, this new technol¬ ogy shoul! have opened up a hugely profitable new crop that didn’t com¬ pete with domestic crops but dis¬ placed imports. “Fish nets, bow strings, canvas, strong rope, overalls, damask table¬ cloths, fine linen garments, towels, bed linen, and thousands of other ev¬ eryday items can be grown on Amer¬ ican farms.” said Popular Mechan¬ ics. “The paper industry offers even greater possibilities. As an industry it amounts to over $1 billion a year, and of that 80 percent is imported. But hemp will produce every grade of paper, and government figures es¬ timate that 10,000 acres devoted to hemp will produce as much paper as 40,000 acres of average pulp land.” The magazine knew about federal regulation of hemp as a drug, but hoped that “if federal regulations can be drawn to protect the public without preventing the legitimate culture of hemp, this new crop can add immeasurably to American ag¬ riculture and industry.” That hope turned out to be empty. Not only did Harry Anslinger of the post-prohibition Bureau of Narcotics bully Congress into outlawing hemp with his campaign of lies ana hardly veiled bigotry, almost all knowledge of the unequivocally useful aspects of the plant was suppressed. The gov¬ ernment still knew about them in 1942, and may still know. It doesn’t want you to know. Since 1937, about half the forests in the world have been cut down to make paper. If hemp had not been outlawed, most would still be stand¬ ing, oxygenating the planet. Hemp pulp could be used for methanol at competitive prices; hempseed oil would be used instead of petrochemi¬ cals for hundreds of uses, meaning less pollution. We might not be facing the Greenhouse Effect. Outlawing hemp has been an agri¬ cultural, industrial, and environ¬ mental disaster. What punishment fits this crime against humanity? I would recommend clemency myself, but it would be unmitigated folly to continue this misguided effort at pro¬ hibition.

The fiber derived from hemp has long been of value for rope and cordage. Cyrus Hall Mc¬ Cormick and his father invested heavily in time and money trying to perfect a hemp brake during the 1830’s. Hemp harvesting by mechanical means remained an un- solvable problem until the early 1900’g. During World War One, there wa9 a renewed interest in domestic hemp. Wartime demands for rope and cordage exceeded a limited overseas supply, and the possibility ex¬ isted that even these sources might be lost. The Interna¬ tional hemp harvester was designed to cut the hemp and leave it nicely placed for retting. This natural process separated the usable fiber from the woody material in the stems. *35 After retting, a hemp gathering machine tied the material into bundles for further curing and an eventual trip to the hemp mill. During the 1918-20 period, International Harvester Company devoted considerable attention to hemp machinery, and perfected a hemp brake, hemp harvester, hemp scutcher, and hemp tow cleaner. With the end of military hostilities, enthusiasm for domestic hemp declined. A closeup view of the International hemp binder shows the travel of loose hemp over the front of the machine. An ordinary grain binder knotter was used to tie the bundles. This machine was being operated on the Axel Anderson farm near Mason City, Iowa. A hemp mill was located at that city, under the auspices of the War Hemp Industries, Inc., a Government-owned organization. Some 4,000 to 5,000 acres of hemp was planted in the area surrounding each mill. Forty two such installations were built across the United States. . Responding to wartime needs, International Harvester Company developed a new hemp gatherer-binder by 1943. The cut material shown here underwent a suitable retting period. This ranged from two to six weeks, depending on the weather conditions. The basic design of this hemp gatherer-binder differed little from the 1918 machine. 'Zii; — 103 —"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Long ago when these ancient Grecian temples were new, hemp was already old in the service of mankind. For thousands of years, even then, this plant had been grown for cordage and cloth in China and elsewhere in the East. For centuries prior to about 1850 all the ships that sailed the western seas were rigged with hempen rope and sails. For the sailor, no less than the hangman, hemp was indispensable. A 44-gun frigate like our cherished Old Ironsides took over 60 tons of hemp for rigging, including an anchor cable 25 inches in circumferance. The Conestoga wagons and prairie schooners of pioneer days were covered with hemp canvas. Indeed the very word canvas comes from the Arabic word for hemp. In those days hemp was an important crop in Kentucky and Missouri. Then came cheaper imported fibers for cordage, like jute, sisal and Manila hemp, and the culture of hemp in America declined. But now with Philippine and East Indian sources of hemp in the hands of the Japanese, and shipment of jute from India curtailed. American hemp must meet the needs of our Army and Navy as well as of our industry. In 1942, patriotic farmers at the government's request planted 36,000 acres of seed hemp, an increase of several thousand percent. The goal for 1943 is 50,000 acres of seed hemp. In Kentucky much of the seed hemp acreage is on river bottom land such as this. Some of these fields are inaccessible except by boat. Thus plans are afoot for a great expansion of a hemp industry as a part of the war program. This film is designed to tell farmers how to handle this ancient crop now little known outside Kentucky and Wisconsin. This is hemp seed. Be careful how you use it. For to grow hemp legally you must have a federal registration and tax stamp. This is provided for in your contract. Ask your county agent about it. Don’t forget. Hemp demands a rich, well-drained soil such as is found here in the Blue Grass region of Kentucky or in central Wisconsin. It must be loose and rich in organic matter. Poor soils won t do. Soil that will grow good com will usually grow hemp. Hemp is not hard on the soil. In Kentucky it has been grown for several years on the same ground, though this practice is not recommenced. A dense and shady crop, hemp tends to choke out weeds. Here’s a Canada thistle that couldn't stand the competition, dead as a dodo. Thus hemp leaves the ground in good condition for the following crop. For fiber, hemp should be sewn closely, the closer the rows, the better. These rows are spaced about four iftches. This hemp has been broadcast. Either way it should be sewn thick enough to grow a slender stalk. Here’s an ideal stand: the right height to be harvested easily, thick enough to grow slender stalks that are easy to cut and process. Stalks like these here on the left yield the most fiber and the best. Those on the right are too coarse and woody. For seed, hemp is planted in hills like com. Sometimes by hand. Hemp is a dioecious plant. The female flower is inconspicuous. But the male flower is easily spotted. In seed production after thepollen has been shed, these male plants are cut out. Tnese are the seeds on a female plant. Hemp for fiber is ready to harvest when the pollen is shedding and the leaves are falling. In Kentucky, hemp harvest comes in August. Here the old standby has been tbe self-rake reaper, which has been used for a generation or more. Hemp grows so luxuriantly in Kentucky that harvesting is sometimes difficult, which may account for the popularity of the self-rake with its lateral stroke. A modified rice binder has been used to some extent. This machine works well on average hemp. Recently, the improved hemp harvester, used for many years in Wisconsin, has been introduced in Kentucky. This machine spreads the hemp in a continuous swath. It is a far cry from this fast and efficient modem harvester, that doesn’t stall in the heaviest hemp. In Kentucky, hand cutting is practicing in opening fields for the machine. In Kentucky, hemp is shucked as soon as safe, after cutting, to be spread out for retting later in the fall. In Wisconsin, hemp is harvested in September. Here the hemp harvester with automatic spreader is standard equipment. Note how smoothly the rotating apron lays the swaths preparatory to retting. Here it is a common and essential practice to leave headlands around hemp fields. These strips may be planted with other crops, preferably small grain. Thus the harvester has room to make its first round without preparatory hand cutting. The other machine is running over com stubble. When the cutter bar is much shorter than the hemp is tall, overlapping occurs. Not so good for retting. The standard cut is eight to nine feet. The length of time hemp is left on the ground to ret depends on the weather. The swaths must be turned to get a uniform ret. When the woody core breaks away readily like this, the hemp is about ready to pick up and bind into bundles. Well-retted hemp is light to dark grey. The fiber tends to pull away from the stalks. The resence of stalks in the ough-string stage indicates that retting is well underway. When hemp is short or tangled or when the ground is too wet for machines, it’s bound by hand. A wooden bucket is used. Twine will do for tying, but the hemp itself makes a good band. When conditions are favorable, the pickup binder is commonly used. The swaths should lie smooth and even with the stalks parallel. The picker won't work well in tangled hemp. After binding, hemp is shucked as soon as possible to stop further retting. In 1942, 14,000 acres of fiber hemp were harvested in the United States. The goal for the old standby cordage fiber, is staging a strong comeback. This is Kentucky hemp going into the dryer over mill at Versailles. In the old days braking was done by hand. One of the hardest Jobs known to man. Now the power braker makes quick work of it. Spinning American hemp into rope yam or twine in the old Kentucky river mill at Frankfort, Kentucky. Another pioneer plant that has been making cordage for more than a century. All such plants will presently be turning out products spun from American-grown hemp: twine of various kinds for tying and upholster’s work; rope for marine rigging and towing; for hay forks, derricks, and heavy duty tackle; light duty firehose; thread for shoes for millions of American soldiers; and parachute webbing for our paratroopers. As for the United States Navy, every battleship requires 34,000 feet of rope. Here in the Boston Navy Yard, where cables for frigates were,made long ago, crews are now working night and day making cordage for the fleet. In the old days rope yarn was spun by nand. The rope yam feeds through holes in an iron plate. This is Manila hemp from the Navy’s rapidly dwindling reserves. When it is gone, American hemp will go on duty again: hemp for mooring ships; hemp for tow.’ lines: hemp for tackle and gear; hemp for countless naval uses both on ship and shore. Just as in the days when Old Ironsides sailed the seas victorious with her hempen shrouds' Jfhd hempen sails.

A good practice in planting hemp for fiber production is to sow around the edgo of the field nest to the fence a 1C- to 18 fool width of small grains, which may be harvested before the hemp. Space is thus provided for live harvester to enter the field and begin cutting without injuring the hemp. It also prevents lietnp plants at the edgu from growing too rank. Uniform plants are necessary for uniform fiber quality. Culture Fall plowing in Wisconsin gives better results with hemp titan spring plowing. Hemp for fiber production requires little or no cultivation or care after planting until the harvest; but if. after seeding ami before the seedlings emerge, the ground crusts badly it may be advisable to roll the field to bieak I lie cruet, llemp for seed production should be \\ cultivated (lie same as corn: tliat is, sufficiently to keep back tiie weeds.

BOTH YEAS HEMP WOOD AS A PAPERMAKING MATERIAL Abstbacted by C. J. West If the composition of hemp wood »s reported by Schwalbe and Becker in Z. mngcw Chew. 32, 127 (1919) is correct, it thou id be a very promising raw materia! for paper mills They reported a •urprisingly high content of pure cellulose, namely, 517 per cent, while Heuser and Haug (Z. ongew. Chew. 31, 99, 103, 160, 172 <1918) found only 43 per cent for the cellulose content of straw. Since straw has lately bc.omc an important raw material for the manufacture of pulp, it must be supposed that hemp wood, because of its higher cellulose content, would be even more suitable for this purpose. Because of the importance of the question, B. Rassow and Al¬ fred Zschenderlein (Z. angru. Chew 34, 204-206 (1921) have re¬ investigated the question of the composition of wood from hemp. The material used in the investigation consisted, first, of the prod¬ uct as obtained in the ordinary process of retting (from the Deutschen Hanfbaugesellschaft), and second, of a product pre¬ pared by the method of Krais (Z. angew. Chem. 32, 25, 160, 326; 33, 102) in which tenth normal sodium bicarbonate solution is used. Krais' method (the \"Sicherheitsrdste,\" as Krais calls it) for the digestion of the bast fibers is readily applicable to bemp. The bast fibers dissolve completely in from three to three and a half days when the air-dry stalks are treated with a tenth normal aodium bicarbonate solution at 35 to 37* C and the resulting product shaken with hot water. The first step in determining the suitability of the bemp wood for pulp manufacture was a stud) of the chemical composition of tbe two products. Schwalbe's scheme of analysis (Z. angrw. Chem 31. 50. 193; 32, 125) was used; the results were as follows: Table I—Composition of Hemp Wood Shavings ing amounts of chlorine and dificren'. methods of washing were used The supposition that Schwalbe and Becker used an entirely different material was ruled out by analyzing some of the origin^ mait-rial which they used, and obtaining result; comparable with tbi lower one* here rejortci!. A comparison of the- figures reported iy Schwalbe and Becker for various wood* with those of other investigator;, such as Kdnig and Bcckcr or Heuser and Sirber (Z. ongei.. Chew., 26 . 801 ) showed that, while a part of the number! agreed fairly well, the values for crudi cellulose, cellulose pcntosais and pure cellulose were consistently higher. The only explanation cf this is that the crude cellulose of Schwalbe and Becker is not completely chlor- mated and therefore contains considerable amounts of lignin. Three experiments were carried out in order to determine tig influence of the velocity of the chlorine stream: (1) 1 bubble a second; (2) y 3 bubbles per second, and (3) a lively stream. The method of Cross and Bevan as modified by Heuser and Haug was used, in which the products formed during the chlorination art washed out with 1 per cent sodium hydroxide. Hydrochloric acid is formed in the chlorination process, which, according to Heuser and Siebcr, is a measure of the reactivity of the chlorine. The chlorinated produc: is washed with warm water (not higher than 30° C) until the filtrate is chlorine-free. The combined fil¬ trate is warmed carefully to drive off free chlorine, and the iolo- tion of hydrochloric acid made up to volume and titrated with tenth normal sodium hydroxide. The results show that the yield ot crude and pure cellulose is the same, but that the course of the reaction depends upon the velocity of the chlorine stream.

It must be remembered that these values cannot he compared in the same way that results from inorganic analysis are compared, since the methods employed do not have the •ame degree of precision. The two samples analyzed by Rassow and Zschenderlein have practically tbe same composition. This is of great practical im¬ portance, since it indicates that the composition is independent of the method of preparation. Hemp wood resembles ordinary wood in composition, as shown by the figures obtained by Schwalbe and Becker (Z. angrw. Chem. 32, 230) and Konig and Becker (Z. mngrw Chem. 32, 157.) It resembles in particular the decidu¬ ous trees, which is seen by exar-tning the values for pentosans and lignin, the two values which are characteristic for tbe difference between deciduous and coniferous trees. Comparison of the values in the above table shows that the figures obtained by Schwalbe for crude cellulose, cellulose pento¬ sans and pure cellulose vary considerably from those reported by Rassow and Zschenderlein. Even though the cellulose determina¬ tion is not a very exact one, thi; fact can scarcely explain the difference between the two values for crude cellulose: 5209 and 71.38 per cent. In attempting to explain these differences, the va¬ rious methods for determining cellulose were compared with each other. Approximately the same result* were found when vary- These results indicate that, in order to prepare a lignm-ftot crude cellulose, the fourth chlorination is necessary. They abe show that even by the use of a rapid chlorine stream, as fa m there is little if any oxycellulose formed, since Heuser and Hflg have shown that the amount of hydrochloric acid formed incrcafll with the formation of oxycellulose.

A fifth efti^ ination is not necessary because the product from the dissolves to a elear solution in concentrated sulphuric acid.

Finally, experiments were undertaken to determine the valoe of the hemp wood for the preparation of pulp. Cooking with water gave a product which might find use as a kraft pulp.

The soda pulp contained as high as 20 per cent, while sulphite pulp, de¬ pending upon the manner of cooking, may contain up to ,0 per cent. The Rittcr-Kellner method is the most suitable.

The result will be a boon to users of cordage—and a headache for law-enforce¬ ment officers. A Jekyll-and-Hyde plant, hemp provides twine and rope urgently needed for military purposes. But it also yields marijuana, a drug that makes de¬ praved creatures of its addicts. What can be done to keep these enormous new supplies, from which there almost inevitably will be \"leaks,\" out of their twitching hands? \"Drugless hemp\" is the bold proposal of the Department of Agriculture for solving the problem. In short, it is attempting to breed a strain of hemp of good fiber quality, but containing a negligible amount of the baneful marijuana drug. For aid, it has ertlisted the expert services of Dr. H. E. Warmke, at the Cold Springs Harbor, N. Y., experimental station of the Carnegie In¬ stitution. First of Dr. Warmke's problems has been to develop a method of determining reliably the amount of marijuana in individual hemp plants. With undesirables weeded out, he then cross-pollinates and breeds the desir¬ able, or relatively drug-free, plants. Only a little more time will be needed to learn whether he can establish a pure, self-perpet¬ uating race of them. Fish serve as test animals for determining the potency of marijuana extracts.

In a low, dreamy whisper, he continued: “The Army’s all right as long as I keep my stuff on hand. I can’t live without it.” Doctors diagnosed the case as drug addiction (Cannabis sativa, or marihuana) and confined the man to the Army Air Forces Regional Station Hospital, March Field, Calif. There he became one of a group of 35 confirmed marihuana smok¬ ers, subjects of an intensive seven-month Army medical study. This was probably the first intimate scientific investigation, either of a civilian or military nature, of the cause and treatment of this little- understood habit. Last week in the magazine War Medi¬ cine, two of the hospital’s psychiatrists, Capt. Eli Marcovitz and Capt. Henry J. Myers, made their first official report on the experiment. It added up to the fact that marihuana smoking, a notoriously troublesome civilian problem,* becomes even more serious when combined with military service. “In effect,\" the doctors reported, \"the soldiers felt and acted like enemy aliens toward society.” The Reefer Men: Of the experimental group 34 were Negroes and one was white. They were referred to the hos¬ pital’s neuropsychiatric service because of (1) chronic physical complaints, chiefly headaches; (2) intoxication, with uncon¬ trolled behavior or a state of near-stupor; (3) open demands to superior officers that they be given passes to go out for marihuana; (4) violence or self-mutilat- ing action (mainly wrist-slashing) in the guard house. As a group, the soldiers had civilian histories packed with adverse family, so¬ cial, and economic factors. Only five had graduated from high school. For 24 there were records of arrests and sentences to reform schools and jails. The offenses ranged from assault to burglary, drunk- eness, vagrancy, and carrying concealed weapons. Of 32 subjects seventeen were single and fifteen married. Ten of the fifteen married men were either separated or di¬ vorced. In most cases, sexual activity be¬ gan as early as 13 or 14 years. Many of the soldiers had never worked at all. Some were supported by their * Rough estimate* uy there ve 100,000 addicts in the white jazz musicians, Hariem habitues, and criminals. women friends and some by gambling or drug peddling. One had had twenty jobs in three years. Another, who had never held a job longer than a month, said: “1 ain’t for working.” The Marihuana Personality: Unlike alcoholics, these marihuana users showed no sense of guilt or remorse. They were indifferent to opinion, and they frequent¬ ly tried to persuade the doctors that they and other “squares” (non-users) ought to try marihuana because they were missing “the greatest thing in life.” A great many of them attempted to form a compensatory image of themselves as superior people. “I could be a general like MacArthur,” one asserted. “He looks smooth—like he’s high all the time.” Toward women their attitude combined indifference with extreme promiscuity. Most of them said they would take mari¬ huana instead of girls if they had to make a choice. On the other hand, some spoke glowingly of the “reefer pads’’ (mari¬ huana dens) and the “freakish women” there-women who, with or without drugs, were uninhibited sexually. Some said frankly that marihuana increased their feeling of sexual potency. “After you smoke it,” said one, \"you feel that no woman can resist you.” In civilian life the men were unable to stand frustration, deprivation, or author¬ ity. Their response to such situations was “explosive aggression.” Even though some began their Army service with attempts to be good soldiers, the old patterns re¬ asserted themselves. Either their \"smok¬ ing\" increased or they ran into trouble with their superiors. Bad Soldiers: In addition to inade¬ quate performance, there was the prob¬ lem of discipline in the marihuana group. Many could not stand being reprimanded. Commanding officers' reports included these quotes: “A potentially dangerous man, under constant observation for un¬ toward behavior.\" “It is difficult to as¬ sign him to a duty which he will fulfill without continued prodding.” The Way Out: In the hospital these men revealed “the usual behavior of the outlaw who rejects and rebels against the authority from which he really wants love and of which he longs to be a part.\" After a few weeks of sedatives, cer¬ tain freedoms, and sympathetic encour¬ agement, “hostility diminished and they showed evidence of better rapport.” They were still not able or willing to United States, mainly high-school students, Negro and do any useful _ there was sufficient change in their atti tude to make it seem reasonable that a patient, long-term therapeutic program carried out under favorable conditions might help to rehabilitate the majority of the group. How to deal with this problem stumped Army officials. Only rarely does a marihua¬ na addict develop a chronic psychotic state calling for medical discharge. Only a few behave so aggressively that they are court-martialed and sentenced to long confinement where a rehabilitation pro¬ gram might have good effect. Because the marihuana smokers inter¬ fere with Army efficiency, separation from the service eventually becomes necessary. But this solution, according to the March Field doctors, “merely releases the addict to civilian life where he can continue to have his difficulties. Also, he tends to foster the use of marihuana by others.” Instead of discharge the officers con¬ ducting the March Field survey recom¬ mended the creation of special govern¬ ment institutions to which these men can be committed. “Such therapy must in¬ clude not only psychotherapy, ’ they con¬ cluded, “but tne provision of a social situation, a community in which the in¬ dividual is given the opportunity to take his place as a productive normal member of society. Only after succeeding in such a situation should he be discharged from custody.” O Newsweek, November 18, 1946 Marijuana and Mentality Although only 700 to 800 persons are arrested each year in the United States for using marijuana, the drug’s reputa¬ tion as a public menace has touched off a bitter medical controversy. When a marijuana committee ap¬ pointed by former Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York City announced in 1945 that the drug’s dangers were greatly overrated, the American Medical Association called the report “thoroughly unscientific\" and charged it with doing “great damage.” Acting as umpire, the Treasury’s Bureau of Narcotics admitted that the use of marijuana had fallen off slightly since 1940 (18,500 marijuana reefers were confiscated in 1940, 17,000 in 1945), but warned that the drug was still “an important cause of crime.” Last summer, the United States Pub¬ lic Health Service decided to conduct its own marijuana experiment at the USPHS hospital at Lexington, Ky. Six addicts, ranging in age from 24 to 33, were al¬ lowed to smoke a daily average of 17 reef¬ ers supplied by the Bureau of Narcotics for a period of 39 days.

Later they began to-complain of head¬ aches, dry mouths, irritated throats, and swollen eyelids. After a few days, they grew lethargic and careless about person¬ al hygiene. None became violent, but most of them sulked when subjected to exhaustive mental and physical tests. From the USPHS experiment came these significant medical facts: C The senses of touch, smell, and sight were not affected by marijuana. C Body temperature and pulse rate de¬ creased; weight increased slightly. C Although mental vigor increased, in¬ telligence ratings fell. C Musical ability was not improved, al¬ though most patients thought so while under the drug’s influence. This confirms other medical opinions on the effect of marijuana on musical talent (Newsweek, Oct. 28, 1946). C After the first burst of exhilaration, pa¬ tients lost interest in work and spent most of their time sleeping. C With prolonged usage of the drug pa¬ tients developed a tolerance to it but gave no definite proof that it is habit-forming.

Most addicts are people with unstable backgrounds-pov- erty, broken homes, or criminal records- and for them, marijuana may increase the chance for crime. The drug is more harm¬ ful than habit-forming opium in inducing fits of temporary insanity, but it ^seldom leads to permanent derangement. In the various studies, no definite con¬ clusion seems to have been reached on the aphrodisiac qualities of marijuana. The general opinion indicates that the drug causes a release of all inhibitions, similar to that of alcohol though more intense. In other words, marijuana may not ac¬ tually stimulate the sex centers. But it dulls the higher centers which control sexual behavior and, in many cases, sex activity of a perverse nature results. MARIHUANA October i9k0 By S. R. WINTERS M ARIHUANA, according to the Bureau of Narcotics, United States Treasury Department, is the government’s most formidable and versatile criminal outlaw. It has, like most criminals, a variety of aliases collected from world wide travel, hut is best known on the Western Hemisphere as Mari¬ huana, a euphonious name of Spanish-Mexiean origin. In botanical circles it is known as Canabis saliva, while in pharmocopeia it is referred to as cannabis. Xontechnicallv, this “coquette of drugdom” is known all over the world as hemp or Indian hemp. The Indian government permits drugs of hemp origin to be smoked, .eaten and drunk in moderation. These drugs, known in India for over thirty centuries, are widely used there for social and religious functions. But the name that betrays the real character of this outlaw culprit is hasheesh, commonly spelled hashish. About this there is a story: llassan ben Sabah, a boyhood friend of Omar Khayyam, after unsuccessfully plotting for dictatorial power in 1090, was exiled from Persia to Kgypt. Incensed, he introduced “purging” or the secret murder of enemies. According to medieval folklore, the Old Man of the Mountains organized youths in a group known as Devoted Ones, who were stupefied with hashish before being sent forth to avenge him. The word “assassin” is derived from the Arabian term hashhashin, meaning a hashish eater. Supremacy of this secret murder ring lasted until the middle of the thirteenth cen¬ tury, but today marihuana assassins still run amuck. And consumption of this drug is still supplied throughout the world by illicit traffic. Marihuana is especially difficult to control because, like a weed, it grows wild, matures rapidly and requires no attention to grow pro¬ fusely. It was known in America as early as 1030, but its use as a narcotic did not become prevalent until the last decade. In 1937 the Marihuana Tax Act was passed, providing for the control of cannabis and its deriva¬ tives, and required any one dealing with the drug to register and pay a special tax. Viola¬ tions are punishable by either a $2,000 fine or 5 years in prison, or both. Another complication in controlling the use of marihuana is that the fibers of this plant are used legitimately by industries to manu¬ facture rope, twines, hats, and paper. The plant's long fibers are also used to make textiles and plastics, but when the stalk is cut before the plant reaches maturity, little or no resin, from which the narcotic substance is made, has been able to develop. The seeds of the plant arc used for bird foods; the oils obtained from the seeds are used in the prepa¬ ration of pharmacal emulsions, paints, var¬ nishes, soap and linoleum. The residue of the hempseed. after pressing, is used for both a livestock feed and a fertilizer. — 112 —"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"T,*mes > yy.yiftL HlGHWTTNESS NEWS NEW YORK CITY E | r.

Working at Columbia, in conjunction with Dr. Colette Lager at the Hospital Fer¬ nand Wide! in Paris, the Na¬ has group shot up rats with intramuscular doses of radio- actively labeled THC and measured the residual ac¬ cumulations of the labeled THC in various organs, after “sacrificing” the animals at various intervals after ad¬ ministration. Several inter¬ esting data emerged. Far one thing, it was shown that THC hardly en¬ ters the reproductive organs at all; THC concentrations in testes and ovaries were the lowest of any body organs, barely achieving one nano- per gram of tissue,_ almost entirely eliminated within 24 hours after a single dose. The THC concentra¬ tion in the brain was only slightly higher, and was elim¬ inated at an even more rapid rate. Most THC was trapped and neutralized in the liver and digestive system, just like vi tamins As to accumulation of THC in the body over a peri¬ od of regular ingestion, it was found that it does not accum¬ ulate in brain or reproductive tissues at all “Cannabinoid concentration in the brain and testis ..did not reflect any significant increase in storage in these tissues,” the paper noted. “Concentra¬ tions of cannabinaids in brain and testis remained lower than that in blood and did not reflect any significant ac¬ cumulation of the drug in those tissues.” Accumula¬ tion occurred in the liver and “neutral fat,” as would be ex¬ pected of any other lipophilic substance. Considering that canna- boids like THC are indeed strongly attracted to body fat, their rapid elimination from twain tissue and afar failure to enter testes and ovaries is quite remarkable. The Nahas group therefore concludes that further investi¬ gations into this phenome¬ non may well turn up new dues to how the body natur¬ ally protects itself from a broad variety of potentially toxic substances. “These data illustrate the efficiency of the blood-brain barrier and the blood-testicu¬ lar barrier in limiting the ac¬ cess and accumulation of this highly lipophilic substance into brain and testis,” the re¬ searchers conclude. “The mechanisms which limit the storage of cannabinaids in these organs de s e rve addi¬ tional investigation.” In layspeak, what this means is that no, marijuana end products don’t pile up in your brain and balls and ova¬ ries, sitting there for weeks after a single joint, snapping nerves ana defarming sperm and egg cells.

For years he has done this, enjoying the puff and the smoke and the glow, though dimly aware of publicity about chemical hazards. But if his eyes could detect what scientific instruments can, he would see radioactivity coming from his cigarette and from his body—from his lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, sex glands and even from the bones of his skeleton. Cigarettes contain so much radioactivity, according to Dr. Thomas H. Winters, director of an occupational health center in North Quincy, Mass., and Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, that a pack-and-a-half-per-day smoker gets a early dose of radiation in parts of his lungs equal to what is skin would be exposed to in about 300 chest X rays. Scientists arc only beginning to discover how much harm the radioactive isotopes in cigarettes do. Estimates vary dramatically as to the number of cases of lung cancer in smokers that are caused by radiation in cigarettes. Dr. DiFranza, however, believes that “radiation alone could account for about half of all lung cancers in smokers.” (In 1985, 180,000 Americans are estimated to have died l READERS DIGEST March from smoking-related cancers— most from lung cancer.) Radioactive Footprints. How Hid radioactive elements get into cigarettes? T. C. Tso, a former researcher for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, tracked these radir - active footprints to the fields where tobacco is grown. For many dec¬ ades, farmers have fertilized to¬ bacco crops with phosphates rich in uranium. Ry decay, this uranium generates radium-226, which in turn spawns radon-222, and even¬ tually lead-210 and polonium-210. Tobacco plants readily absorb ra¬ dioactive elements from the fertil¬ izer and from naturally occurring radiation in the soil, air and water. Rreez.es and farm equipment whip these dangerous elements into the air, where they arc absorbed by the sticky resin tips of hairs that grow on each tobacco leaf. When a smoker lights up, the heat of the cigarette’s glowing tip fires the hair rips of the tobacco into insoluble particles, which, incorpo¬ rating the radioactive isotopes, are then inhaled deep into the smoker’s lungs. Inside the lungs the airways branch out into smaller and smaller passageways. It is especially at each branching, many scientists claim, that the particles in the inhaled smoke tend to accumulate, much as floating river debris piles up on sand bars. As a smoker consumes cigarette after cigarette, these particles may be deposited at the same points in the lungs. According to Edward A. •*4 Martcll, a specialist in radiochemis¬ try at the National Center for At¬ mospheric Research, these points become \"hot spots\" of radioactivity. Martell believes it is no coincidence that most lung cancers begin at these branch points where radioac¬ tive debris gathers. A healthy body's defenses are usually able to clear away the smoke, ash and poison-gas pollu¬ tion from a single cigarette within hours. Rut the accumulated smoke particles are much harder to re¬ move from the moist protective coating of lung tissues, the bronch¬ ial epithelium, and remain in the lungs usually for three to six months—in some instances for many years—emitting radiation. Eventually the body's immune- system cells clean these particles from the lungs, hut in the process the radioisotopes are carried into the bloodstream and to other parts of the body—the liver, pancreas, kidneys, lymph nodes, thyroid and bone marrow. Here, too, the radio¬ active particles accumulate year af¬ ter year, emitting radiation that can damage nearby cells. Martcll notes that the calcified plaques in the blood vessels of smokers suffering atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) show high levelsoflead-210and polonium-210, the same radioactive isotopes in¬ haled with tobacco smoke—and he speculates that the radiation in cigarettes may also be a contribut¬ ing factor in smokers’ developing atherosclerosis, which itself can i<>M RADIOACTIVITY': THE NEW FOUND DANGER IN CIGARETTES lead to early coronaries and also to strokes. Dangerous Interaction. How long does such radioactivity persist in a smoker’s body? Radioactive lead-210 has a half-life of 21.4 years. Reverly S. Cohen and Naomi H. Harley of the New York University Medical Center discovered that smokers who quit still had, five years later, almost as much lower- lung radioactivity from lead-210 as did active smokers. And most smokers do not quit permanently. Indeed, each year the average smoker in the United States con¬ sumes more than 11,000 cigarettes. The most harmful radiation in cigarettes, however, comes not from lead-210, which emits the rel¬ atively weak beta radiation, but from its radioactive \"granddaugh¬ ter,” polonium-210, which emits highly localized, ionizing alpha ra¬ diation, the same sort given off hy the plutonium of atom bombs. Al¬ pha radiation smashes into atoms, turning them into ions that can readily damage the genetic blue¬ print of living cells, killing them or turning them into cancer cells. Sci¬ entists have recognized the danger to living things in beta radiation, but alpha radiation can be 20 times as damaging. The human body evolved on a planet with low levels ol natural radioactivity from,such sources as cosmic rays, and therefore it has some ability to heal radiation injury. But with each cigarette, a smoker inhales almost as much polonium- 210 as he would get from natural sources in 24 hours. Thus the aver¬ age smoker exposes himself each day to about 30 times more of this long-lived radioactive element than do most non-smokers. For more than 20 years. Dr. John B. Little and his colleagues at the Harvard University School of Pub¬ lic Health studied the effect of polo- nium-210 on the lungs of laboratory animals and humans. They found that alpha radiation from inhaled polonium-210, at doses the same as those inhaled by long-time smok¬ ers, can cause lung cancer. Uranium miners on the job inhale short-lived radon daughters as well as poloni- um-210 and other alpha-emitting isotopes, and some studies have shown that those miners who also smoke tend to get lung cancer five to ten years sooner than non-smok¬ ing co-workers do. Can this radioactivity in ciga¬ rettes cause cancer in humans by itself, as it can in laboratory ani¬ mals? Scientists are not yet sure. Many researchers suspect, howev¬ er, that it can combine with other factors to cause cancer. When a smoker lights up, he inhales more than 4000 chemicals with his first puff. Some, such as the |»>lvcyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzr>(a)py- rene, are powerful carcinogens. When Dr. Little and his Harvard colleagues exposed animals sequen¬ tially to alpha radiation from polo¬ nium-210 and to benzo(fl)pyrene. they found that the two substances together acted synergistically and 'IJ"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"caused malignant lung tumors at “about twice the rate expected from the simple additive effect\" of polo- mum-210 and benzo(<i)pyrene. Radioactive elements in cigarette smoke can also accumulate in areas important to a body's immune de¬ fenses. There is evidence indicating that smoking can undermine the body's ability to light off poisons, cancer and other diseases. Menace in the Home. Recently scientists discovered another deadly mixture in smoking. Soil gives off small amounts of radon, a radioac¬ tive gas derived from radium. New weather-sealing technologies to help conserve energy in our homes can also trap and concentrate this dangerous gas indoors.* The Envi¬ ronmental Protection Agency esti¬ mates that up to 20,000 Americans each year may be dying Irotn lung cancer caused by inhaling radon in homes and work places. But when indoor air already pol¬ luted with invisible, odorless radon gas is also polluted with cigarette smoke, something even more frightening happens. In clean air the radon’s short-lived daughters tend to attach themselves to walls, rugs and draperies. But with tobac¬ co smoke in the air, the radon daughters condense onto smoke particles and remain aloft to be inhaled by smokers and those who breathe secondhand smoke. As a result, the combination of indoor radon pollution and indoor ciga- •See “The Menace of Indoor f\\>llulion.\" Reader’s Digest, February '83. 126 March rette-smoke pollution may create yet another synergy deadlier than each of the pollutants separately. Even without radon, those who breathe smoke-clouded air will be dosed with radioactivity from to¬ bacco. At least 50 percent of the radioactive isotopes in cigarette smoke wind up in the air, and a smaller percentage of this and other elements in the smoke are inhaled by those around the smoker. Dr. Takeshi Hirayama of the Institute of Preventive Oncology in Tokyo studied records of more than 91,000 women and found that non-smok¬ ing wives of heavy smokers had more than double the risk of dying from lung cancer than did the non¬ smoking wives of non-smokers. Nothing can remove all the radio¬ activity from cigarettes, but steps can be taken to reduce this hazard: • Tobacco growers could switch to fertilizers low in radioactivity and to tobacco-plant hybrids with less tendency to concentrate radio¬ active elements in their leaves. Denser planting also seems to re¬ duce the radioactivity in each leaf. • Cigarette companies should be encouraged to continue improving their filters so that even more radio¬ activity is removed. • Since polonium -210 seems to be the single element in smoke that causes cancer by inhalation in lab animals, the Surgeon f !eneral should add a new warning on cigarette labels to alert smokers to this peril. • Smokers can educate them- RADIOACTIVITY: TUI: NEW-FOUND DANCER IN CIGARETTES selves to the hazards of radioactivity in tobacco. Smoking more fre¬ quently and inhaling deeply, for example, expose them to much more danger from the volatile ra¬ dioactive elements in smoke. Many believe that filtered \"light\" ciga¬ rettes are safer, but research shows that smokers tend to inhale these more deeply and to smoke a larger number of them. • More funds should be made available to researchers so that they may investigate further the effects on human health of the radioactiv¬ ity in cigarettes. With all that scientists have learned about radioactivity in ciga¬ rettes, however, the best way to protect yourself is not to let tobacco smoke into your lungs at all. for information on reprints of this article, see page 222 DIAZEPINES (VALIUM): #1 IN ABUSE Crack and coke and heroin kill and hurt people and get talked about in the news media, but they’re not the biggest drug abuse problem in the U.S. Street dope is the biggest illegal drug abuse problem. In 1985. emergency room admissions for cocaine-related problems added up to 13.501; there were 14.696 for morphine and heroin combined; but 18,492 were admitted for the number one drug abuse problem in the country—benzodiazepines, a prescription tranquil¬ izer family best known by the best seller Valium (23 million prescriptions filled in 1985, of a total of 81 million for these types of sedatives). Many people are addicted to benzodiazepines; slop taking them and you get nervous, agitated. Physicians, however, routinely prescribe these drugs for long¬ term use, without a full understanding of long-term effects. Many people don’t need Valium and could benefit more by understanding the cause of anxiety, by counseling, and perhaps by just a brief treatment with the drug.

Whole Life Times, Mid-April/May 1985 Would You Still Rather Fight Than Switch? In spite'of recent government moves to make the warnings on cigarette packages stronger the new findings that second-hand smoke is also haz¬ ardous to your health, many smokers and non-smokers alike are still un¬ aware that the main cause oflung can¬ cer in smokers is probably not tar and nicotine, but radioactivity. ‘Americans are exposed to far more radiation from tobacoo smoke than from any other source,* according to Dr. R. T. Raven- holt, former director of World Health Surveys at the Center for Disease Con¬ trol. A pack-and-a-half-day smoker ab¬ sorbs a daily dose of radiation equal to the amount he would have received standing downwind of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor for 21 hours af¬ ter the infamous accident. A regular smoker absorbs more radiation annual¬ ly than the maximum exposure allowed nuclear-power-plant workers. Tbbacco in any form emits alpha radi¬ ation from polonium-210, a radioactive isotope linked to a variety of ailments, including cancer, premature aging, and artherosclerosis. The polonium-210 is the end result of several radioisotopes naturally present in air and soil, which collect on the sticky tobacco leaves and come through the plant’s roots. The phosphate fertilizers used to grow to¬ bacco contain especially high concentra¬ tions of these radioisotopes. There is enough polonium-210 in cigarettes to cause at least 95% of the lung cancer reported in smokers, ac¬ cording to Dr. Edward Martell, a radio¬ chemist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Biophysics, and Biological Science, March 1983). The radiation circulates in the bloodstream and also contributes to cardiovascular degenera¬ tion. Radioactivity in cigarette smoke might explain why, oddly smokers of low-tar and nicotine cigarettes have the same death rate from lung cancer as smokers of other cigarettes. Studies show that 50% of the radiation in tobac¬ co is discharged into the air. This could explain why non-smokers married to heavy smokers have an increased risk oflung cancer-as do subjects whose mothers smoked according to a 1983 National Institute of Health (NIH) study (Lancet, September 1983; also see “Thumbs Down on Second Hand Smoke,* Newsviews, September 1984). More than 20 chemical compounds in tobacco have also been identified as car¬ cinogens. But even the most potent one, benzopyrene, is only present in quantity sufficient to account for 1% of the cancer found in smokers. The presence of radioactive isotopes in tobacco has been known for 20 years. Research at top institutions-Harvard University, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, New York University-repeated- ly confirm its existence, yet the public remains unaware of the danger. The press has largely ignored the subject, perhaps, as Elizabeth Whelan, execu¬ tive director of the American Council on Science and Health, charges, for fear of offending its biggest advertiser, the to¬ bacco industry. Magazines that accept tobacco advertising, she found in a re¬ cent study, give the health hazards of smoking almost no coverage. She strongly suspects Newsday of watering , down a recent 18-page supplement so as to delete all negative references to smoking. The mqjor cancer-research institu¬ tions focus their efforts on chemical hazards in tobacco; the National Cancer Institute, for example, with a yearly budget of $986 million, allocated noth¬ ing for radiation research last year. The U.S. Surgeon General in his 1981 and 1982 reports acknowledged that polonium is present in tobacco but dis¬ missed it as a minor risk. A Harvard researcher, Vilma Hunt, originally discovered polonium-210 in tobacco in 1964. Network news picked up the story; headlines screamed “Ra¬ dioactivity in 'Ibbacco* On the day of the announcement, Hunt recalls, it seemed that every chemist and physi¬ cist she knew quit smoking. “They un¬ derstood immediately the implication* she recounts. “They said, Tf there’s ion¬ izing radiation in this stuff, that’s it.

Nearly all ol tbs hemp in the United States Is dew retted. The stalks are spread on tbs ground in swathe, as grain Is laid by the cradle. The action ol the weather, dew, and rain, aided by baotaria, dissolves and washes out the green coloring matter (chlorophyll) and most ol the gums, Isa ring only lbs fibrous bark and the wood. The plants In this process lose about 30 per cent ol their green weight, or about 40 per neat of their air-dry weight. T!»e sulks ars sometimes set up In shocks to ours before retting, and niter reunig they are set up in shocks to dry. Each time the stalks are handled they are chucked down on the ground to keep the butts even. In these operations sand and day are often driven up into the hollow at the base ol the stalks, and this dirt, which often dings tenaciously, may constitute an objectionable feature in tbs use of beiup herds for paper stock. In Italy and in moot localities in Russia and Austria-Hungary where hemp is extensively cultivated, it is retted In water, but water retting has never been practiced in the United 8tates except to a Uiuitfd extent before the middle of the last eantury.

Most of tho hump in Kentucky is still broken hy hand brakes. These small brakes are moved from shock to shock, so that the hurds are scattered all over the field in small piles of Icaa than 60 pounds each, and it is the common practice to set fire to them as soon as the lirako is moved.

Hemp hurds an> used to a limited extent fur barnyard litter and atahlo lieddmg, as a substitute for sawdust in packing ice, and, in ram inslniices, for foci. They am not regarded as having a commer¬ cial value for any of Ihcao uses, though they are doubtless worth at lou>l Si |a*r ton on tlio farm when nwal for stabki bedding. They ars a wa>in product, without value for other pur]MMiw which might cum- |a u» with tleur use for ps|a»r nUn k. During the last soason, 1016, about 1,600 acres of homp have boon harvested outsids of Ksntuckj and in regions where machine brakes are used. Estimating ths yield of hurds at 2| tons per acre, this should give a total quantity ol about 3,760 tons. L*rge quantities of hemp from ths crop of 1014, which ars still unbroken in these areas, and large piles of hurds undisturbed where ths machines have been used during ths last two or three years, increase ths total to mors than 7,000 tons. Hemp is now grown outside of Kentucky in ths vicinity of MoQuffoy, east of lima, Ohio; around Nappanos, Elkhart County, and tioer I'iurceton, in Koeciusko County, Ind.; about Wau- pun and Brandon, Wis.; and at Rio Vista and Stockton, CaL In Kentucky, bemp is grown in most of tho counties within a radius of 60 mil— of Lexington. No accurate Etelistica of the acreage are collected, but ths crup harvested in 1016 is estimated at 7,000 ac es. A machine brake will probably be used in Bourbon County and also In Clark County, but most of tbs bemp in Kentuoky will be broken ou band brakes. BALING POE SHIPMENT. The hurds will have to be baled to facilitate handling in transpor¬ tation and to economise storage space at ths paper mills. Tbs bales will neod to be covered with burlap or some material to keep them from she king out. They may ba baled In ths same p r esses that ars wed for baling bemp fiber, but cars must be exercised to avoid break¬ ing tbs press, for tbs hurds ars mors resistant than hemp fiber. A bale of bemp 8 by 8 by 4 feot weighs about 600 pounds. A bale of hurds of ths same sixs will weigh about one-third leas, or approxi¬ mately six bales per ton. Rough bemp fiber as It Is shipped from lbs farm is not covered; therefore, ths covering material must be purchased especially fur tho hurds. A piece of burlap about 36 by 46 inches placed on either side of tbs bale will be sufficient, but these pieoee, weighing about 3 pounds each, cost about 40 cents a pair. Baling rope, in addition to jute covering, will cost at least 6 cents par bale, making tbs total cost of covering and ties 82.70 or more per ten. Possibly chip board, coating about 833 per ton, or not more than 6 cents for the two pieces for each bale, may be used in place of burlap. Chip board, burlap, and also rope ties may all be used for paper stock. Burlap covers might be returned, to be used repeatedly until worn out, but cl ip board could not be used more than once. may be reduced to about 82 per ton. Tbs cost of hauling and loading on the cars will vary frum 81 to 83 per ton, depending upon the dis¬ tance and the roads. The fanner must therefore receive from 84 to 86 per tou for the hurds, baled, ou board ears at hie home station. SUMMARY. Hemp hurds ars ths woody inner portion of the hemp stalk, broken into pieoee in removing the fiber. They are not used at present for any purpoeo that would compote w ith their use for paper. Hurds are available only from mschine-brokon homp, for the cost of collecting them frum the hand brakes would be too groat. About 7,000 tone ars now available in restricted localities in Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and California. Hie quantity is likely to increase ee the use of machine brakes increases. The hurds may be baled in bamp-fiber presses, with partial burlap covers bke those on cotton baloe, or possibly chip-board ooverv. It is estimated that the formers may deliver tbs bales on board cars profitably at 84 te 86 por ton. TliE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER FROM IIEMP IllIRDS. By Jason L Uiiiiu, 1‘ufxi l‘U *ai I'mpa-J'ltoti INTRODUCTION. Tho purpoeo of I bin paper i* to report preliminary leuls which wore conducted U> deter mine the paper-making value of bt'inp Imrda, a crop waste of tho huiup-lihor industry. The search fur plant materials capable of being ulili/.i'd in paper manufacture is a cumpiffutivuly recent but world-wide activity a im h has for iU object the husbanding of pnwonl source* of pu|x*r-*!o« k supply by tlio substitution of new materials fur somu of those wlucb sro rapidly becoming 1ms plentiful and mure cnaily. The abstract idea of utilising that which is st proton l a waste call play no important rAle in such activities, tlio auccossful commercial uutcomo of which muat be baaed on the throe fundamental factors— market or demand for product, oaliafaclory raw material, and cost. Sinco hump hurds aro to ho troalod in this rr|mrt as a raw material for tho manufocluro of book and printing pa|mra, tlio qualities, supply, probable future, and enst of the material will bo couaidored m com¬ parison with wood, with which it must compote. There seems to lie little doubt that the prceeiil wood supply can not withstand in¬ definitely llm demands placed upon it, and with increased scarcity economy in the use of wood will Ihcuiiik imperative. This effect i* already apparent in many wood-using indust lies, and although the papor industry censuuies only about 3 |*or cent of the total forest rut, it is probable that it will be affected through tins economy. Our forests are being cut three turns* as fast ss they grow, and as w«mmJ becomes more expensive proper growing and reform!iug will receive nmro attention. Thus, naturally, a balance will bo rwluldishcd ho- twoon production and consumption, but as this condition approach** its Uiiiiling values tlio price of wood may rise to such levels that there Will be a demand for other raw materials. Tlio use of waste paper iu conjunction witli clminical wood pulp has increased to enormous proportions, and it is probable that the increase will coutiuuo. Although it is a choapcr raw material than wood, it is ruuNonaldo to aiqqmao that as tho wood supply dis reases and tho price of wood pulp ad vane**, tlio price of waste paper will COBT or BALING. If burlap covers ore used the cost of baling, including covering, ties, use of hiding prsee, power, and labor will amount to at least 60 oem* per bale, or »l.oul *3,7* par Ion.

To l>o of substantial value th* instigations should include not only a determination of the quality and quautity of pulp and paper which the material is oapahle of produoing, hut ebouid embrace a consideration of auch relevant fee tore as agricultural con- ditions, farm practioe, aesecnbling conditions, transportation, and probable future supply. Con am cultivated pleats seem particularly promising, because in the harvesting of the regular crop that portion which might be utilised for paper manufacture uocoseardy is oilbor wholly or partially as¬ sembled. To this olass of plants belong corn, broom coru, sorghum, auger cane, bagasse, flax, hemp, and the coreal straws. 1 It is generally conceded that the employment of dillerout raw materials would probskly yield products of s somewhat different qui Uty than those now prevailing in the markets, but the qualities of pet ora end the publio domauds ero so divoreifiod and numoroua that tliii possible objootion should not be serious. Ton yoers ego eul- phu e manufacturers would not’ecoopt consign metals of epruco logs if they contained over 6 per cant of fir, while to-day many manufac¬ turers tolerate 60 per cent. Rope papers are found to contain not oid; jute, but when this raw materiel is not plentiful, chemical pulp of v * nous kinds. “ Linen paper\" is often no inoro than a trade term. Not long ago printing papora were made entirely from chomicel wood pulp, but to-day if it is desired to secure paper which is freo from ground wood the specifications must so stipulate. Writing papers, formerly made entirely from rags, now are likely to contain either chemical or even ground-wood pulp unless the specifications prohibit it. Witjmut doubt, many paper manufacturers have maintainod cer¬ tain papers up to a fixed standard for a long aeries of years, but it is equally true that competition has lowered the standard of a great many papers, some of which had acquired a distinctive recognition. The employment of plant fibers will not uoceaaerily lower the present quality of papers, but if their employment does result in products whoire qualities are somewhat different from our aorcallod standard paper* does not nscesaarily follow that such papers will uot find a ra> dy market. FACTORS JUSTIFYING AN INVESTIGATION OF HEMP HURDS. Hemp hurde form a crop waste, in that they necessarily are pro¬ duced in 1 the raising and preparation of hemp fiber, and their preeont use and yalue are comparatively insignificant. The assembling of the hurde may bo efloctod with economy, since die eras in which lioiup is handled with the use of machine brakes is restricted. Although it must bo stated that the present annuel * r-.liM»ipie— n Mmumti ISm* m is* IM W puUSMloM M IW «Mi ws bwUaUa UKMF IIUMM AH I'Al’KIt- MAKING MAT tU IAI.. 0 supply would not bo hii( lieionl to justify llm iiinl mIImI i**n of s pulp noil nor would its Iraiequirlalinn to o vist mg mill* up|M*ur fnmoldo, it is exported Unit the available hiiiiiihI loiuiiigo, cHprr.iully tit rt ilntii genera) HortioiiH, will iiicrnuKc, duo to the inrn*u*ctl line of the machine brake. The present Imuiugc prr niiiiuin is approximately ha follows: 111 the region of Ohio and India mi, 2,/UN) Iona; in the Wise •main sen- lion, l,tHN) tons; in tho California regain, I,UNI Ions. Ill yours of lulvorso weather mndilinii* I Imre are often largo areas of Itoiup which are not harvested on account of it* |smr quality; there Aro also lingo aroua of cut hemp which become overrent'd, duo to inclement wculhur. It haa hern auggesU'd by somo of lim hemp ruiscra that this large amount of muieiial might l»o utilized an s paper stock. In those cases tho cost of (ho whole material would prohuhly ho soniowhut higher than tinti of the liurds, be< auso either all or purl of tho cost of harvesting nod the total cost of breaking Would have to bo Ikorno by tlm paper maker. Moreover, the quality of lina material would bo so very irreguiai and tho supply so uncertain tluit. it prob¬ ably would not appeal to (he paper manufacturer. Without doubt, hemp will continue to lm mio of the staple agri¬ cultural cro|Mi of Uto United Stuu*. The wholc*ule dcHlriicliou of tlio supply by firo, as friM|Uciilly bappena in the ease of wimmI, is pre¬ cluded by tho very iinture of lim liiTiqi-raiNUig industry. Since only one year’s growth can Im harvested annually Urn aupply ia uot endangered by tho pomiciou* practice of «ivercropping, which has contributed so much to tlm present liigli ami increasing cost of pulp wood. The pornunioiicy of tho eup|dy of liomp liunls tlius seem* assured. Tho favorablo location go •graphically of tho hemp regions in re¬ lation to tho pulp and paper industry is a factor of coiisnletablo imjHirlanco. Tho Kentucky regi«ui is not at pri'sent in a position to supply Kurds, as machine motlmtls have uot been adopted (hero to any appreciable degree. Tho Ohio and Indiana region, which at present has the greatest annual toiuuige, with llm pro«|»ect of an »n- crouso, is situated south of Uio Wisconsin and Michigan wtaal-pulp producing region and at a distance from tho eastern Woml-pulp producuig regions; Uierefure, it is in a favorable |aaiilioii to coiu|ale in the large Ohio and Iudiami marketa. Since, aa will he shown, Urn liurd pulp acts far more like sods |aiplar stock than aulphiie st4>ek, eoni|Htlilion would bo stmugeal from the casino mills; m fact, tlm liurd stock might very |M>ssibly mis t with favor na a laaik- stock fumish in the Miclugaii and Wimonsiii paper mills, which are within tlm sulpiiilo fiber-producing region. Hecaiise of its very cloan proximity to paper mills, this latter possibility applies with fur greater force to tho Wisconsin hemp region, where a considerable extension of tho heuip industry is anticipated. *——*«n•-—«*««*a— m lmIOh nlf K .itirwi^ >1 UXMI’ II Ulll'H AH I'A l*i:M - M A Kl NO IIA'I l Ml/L. 11 CHARACTER OF TIIK MATERIAL As received from l’iorcelou, lml , Um liurds consisted i»f a mixture of longiod hump bust fibers and pieces of broken wooil of llm hemp stalk. (Fig. 3.) No reliable data were secured as to llm propor¬ tion of bast fibor ill tlm total sliipmeiil of I loos, although two baud sops rations of small representative samples gave results aver¬ aging 8 per cent. Tlio clmum al character id Hie material was such ami Um quantity was so small that any appreciable variation of tlm proportion ahould not affect materially Uio treating process** finally adopted, yet its presence ill varying proportions undoubtedly would modify to somo extent tlm quality of tho reuniting pa|M*r product. Since Ute length of the ultimate bast liber »verugo* about 22 mm. ami Uto length of tho ultimate Immp wood filter average* 0.7 mm., it is natural to ussumo Hint Um bast fiber would tend to increase tho •IrcngUi of paper produced from Urn liurds. (Fig. 4.) 'llm broken pieces of wood contained in Um liurds varied in length from mere particles which were women hat finer Hum sawdust to piece* about 3J inches long, oxcepliomd piecea Iwing found which nica*iire«l 0 inches ill length. Tlm majority of tlm long pieces were la'lweeii 2 ami 3 inches in length. In lltickiiciM tlm pieces ranged from oiic cighlli of an inch, in case Umy went derived from flic base of Um lump stalks, to about ouo sixty-fourth of an inch in those pieces which were derived from Um top and brunches of Um alalks. in cross section tlm 12 BULLETIN 404, U. S. DEPAKTMBNT OF AOEIOULTUBE. pieces often were found to be a quarter or half of the rounded rectan¬ gular woo«ly shell of the stalk, although there appeared to ha no regularity in Uiia respect. From Uie pulp-maker's standpoint the great irregularity ui tliick- ueas, length, and mass of tbs woody pieces militates decidedly against economy in pulp production. The smaller pieces reduce by chemical treatment sooner than Uie larger fragments and are thoreby ovor- trested, which results in a lower yield of cellulose fiber and a product coioposod of under Ires uxi and over treated fibers, the production and ueo of which are uot satisfactory or economical. It probably would be found more satisfactory, therefore, to screen or sort the hurde and treat the various sixes separately and differenUy. Associated with Uie hurde was a small quantity of chaff and dirt, nmt|Hieod chiefly of sand, sod, particles of hemp leavra and flowora] and other extraneous matter. The sand and soil were present Imcause of the practico of placing the stalks In shocks in the field, the butte of the etalke beiug in contact with the soil. It is a simple matter, however, to remove the chaff and dirt by sieving, and this practice was followed in most of Uie paper teste conducted with this material. CHARACTER OF THB TESTS. £, tea use of Uie similarity of homp hunts to olhor materials which havi been tested by the Office of Paper-Plant Investigations, aemi- coin imrcial teats were conducted in cooperation with a paper manu- factirer without preliminary laboratory teste. Laboratory pulp and paper tests are regarded ouly aa a preliminary to aemioommercial tests and therefore are not employod unless the material in question proot uts new features which ahould receive inveeUgatiou before largi • sued teste are undertaken. Tl i advantages of cooperative mill tests are many, among which may be mentioned the counsel aud advice of the mill management and employees, the services of specialized and skilled labor, facilities for comparing Uio processes and Uie results of teste with commercial procoosea aud results, eud the use of commercial or eemicom- mercisl typos and sixes of mac binary. Teste conducted in this manner and on this scalo are of a different quality than is pos¬ sible in thooo conducted in a laboratory, and the results are suscep¬ tible of commercial interpretation with a fair degree of reliability. It is found, in general, that the cost of securing such equipment aud service for a complete and comprehensive test does not exceed 6600 while the installation of an equally satisfactory equipment alone would cost si I oast, 660,000 and in many cases vary much more, luots conducted in Una manner constitute a direct demonairaUon to the manufacturer, and the results obtained are found to carry more weight whon presented to olhor manufacturers for consideration. UfcMP 11UII Us AS 1‘AI'EII-MARlXti MATERIAL. 13 It is well known that tlio method of condm ting tests necessarily varies with Uio size of Uio test. In Uie matter of yield determination, for example, laboratory tost* may lw on auclt a small acalo that (lie weighing and sampling of Uio nwtdling cellulose lilwra may la* con¬ ducted by moans of diomicu! laboratory apparatus ami analytical balance, while iu teats involving a matter of 6 L» 10 jmiind* of material largor and different types of equipment aro niMawaury. When the teste sro so increased in size m to employ .ton nr 400 jmmiu'I*. still other typos of cquipmoul are noceaaary for (lie treatment of tho material and for a determination of Uio yield of liber. Iu teats involving tons of material Uie equipment involves Uie u*e id machines. Accuracy in degree of control ami in results will vary materially with the size of the lost. As Um size of Hie lest i.irreu*o*, curtain factors will vary in a beneficial manner, while others will vary in a dotriuioiital manner, so it is a qiicsUon for each investigator to docido, after Ukiug all factors into cons* lor* lion, os to (lie size of test which will givo Uio most satisfactory reaults. In work of this nature It Is found, on th* whole, that better results are obtained is large tests, although Ute control of Uie factors aud the determination of Uie yield of fiber are more difficult Utan in smaller tcate. In Uio test* described in this bulletin, the Department of Agricul¬ ture employed a rotary digester of its own design, 1 comprising a ahull 6 foot 6 inches in longUi by 4 foot in diameter, capable of holding about 300 pounds of air-dry liunls. It is believed Hist a UmI of Ibis suo ia lurgo enough to givo satisfactory result* and Hist Uio reaulU aro susceptible of commercial interpretation, while at Uie aatim time Umy aro aulliciunUy small for complete control and to afford iilmr- yiold figures which uio both accurato and reliable.

Cooking. —Cooking ie the tocbuical term for the operation by which fibroue raw materiale are reduced to a residue of cellulose pulp by m ea n s of chemical treatment. In those testa about 300 pounds of burda were charged into the rotary with the addition of a cauetic- aoda eoiuuon, such aa is regularly employed in pulp mills and which tested an average of 109.5 grama of cauatio soda per liter, or 0.916 pound per gallon, and areragod 86 per cent causticity. Sufficient caustic solution waa added to furnish 35 or 80 per cont of aotual cauatio aoda, calculated on the bone-dry weight of burda in ilia charge. After closing the rotary hoad, it waa started rotating at tlio rate of joe-half revolution per minute, and in about five in in u toe steam at 30 pounds per aquae* inch wae admitted at such a rate that the charge was heated in one hour to 170* C., which ie the theoretical equivalent of 100 pounds of eteara pressure per square inch. It waa found, howavar, that whan the temperature reached 170* C. the premure wee usually 116 or 120 pounds instead of 100 pounds, dus to air and geese incl o sed in the rotary. At this point tha rotary was stopped and steam and air relievod until the pressure dropped to 100 pounds, or a solid steam pressure. The temperature was maintained at this point for tbs number of hours required to reduce the horde, which waa found to be about five, after which the rotary wae stopped and teem relieved until the pressure wee reduced to aero, when the head waa removed and tha stock waa emptied into a tank under¬ neath, measuring 6| by A by 3 feat deep, where it wae drained and washed. Samples of waste sode solution or “black liquor,\" which w^ra taken from some of the “cooks\" for anslysis, wore drawn while the stock was being thus emptied into the drainer. Determination gf yidd.—For determining the yield of cellulose fiber the stock in the drain tank waa washed with water until free from waste soda solution, when, by means of a vacuum pump communi¬ cating with the apace between the bottom and the false perforated bottom, the water wae sucked from the stock, loaring the fiber with a very uniform moisture content throughout its entire mass and in a condition suitable for removing, sampling, and weighing for a yield dal. «rmina lion. Teats have shown that it ia possible to sample and calculate the yield of bone-dry fiber within 0.05 per cent of the actual amount. It has boon found that stocks from different materials vary greatly la Uieir ability to mat in the drain tank, thereby euabling a good vacuum to be obuinod, some slocks permitting a 36-inch vacuum to be obtained, while others will not permit more than 6 inches. For this reason the moisture commit of the stock will vary from 66 to 86 percent. 11 tM t UUMUS AH I'AI'KM tlAKIMl MAlfcClAl.. ]7 Discussion of ilut various C4u»ks will lut given in cmim-clinii with llm diwcri plums of those pupor loti* in which Ihoalia-k* from lhe<<«ik* wore uminI, sinco s stock end its cooking condition mu Ini judged ad.- 1 quitloly only sfior it has boon put llirougli tlio various processes and into I ho finished sheet of paper.

A medium Jordan brush was given the stock snd it acted well on the paper machine, which was speeded to 76 feet per minute. 'Hiere seems to be a tooduuoy in the hurd stock to crush a little at tho \"dandy rull,\" and although tho murks are not removed by the calen¬ der ataok which was omploysd in those testa it wss found that ons \"nip\" on tho super calender* rendors them practically imperceptible and it IS boheved that the proper site and weight of calender stack would entirely remove these marks.

COMPARISON OF THE TESTS AND COMMERCIAL PRACTICE. In work of this nature and on this scale it is practically impo^dde to uiTtvu at a cost liguru which would ho susceplildo of coiiiliieivial interpretation, and ill this preliminary publication nothing Mill ho attempted beyond a comparison of tho process used with the holds with that process commercially applied to poplar wood. The process last used with the hurds should not lie regarded as linal, satisfactory, or most suitable, as it has boon shown that progress wss Iming made up to tho conclusion of tho work. Ill comparing tho inolhod of n»iug hinds with tho met Inal of han¬ dling poplar wood, a difference is apparent on iho delivery id taw material at the mill. Ordinarily, |Miplur is received at the mill in tho form of lugs a hunt t feet in length, wliich may lm stored in piles in the open. Hin ds vory likely would la* received haled, ami it would seem advisable to storo them under cover for the following reasons: (u) Haled hurds would probiddy absorb ami rein in more wait l' during wet weather than logs of wood, thereby causing i'MvmIvo dilution of tho caustic liipior; (6) prolougod excessive ilinupm** might cresle healing snd deterioration unless tho hemp Mere pn.p. rly retted; (c) wet hurds could not bo »iovod free from asm! ami chair. Should further work show that tho liral two reasons need not lie taken iuto consideration, the third objection might ho overcome by sieving tbo hurds licforo haling. Even then, it is probable llnit haled hurds stored in the open would ncctumiluiu ami retain cun- siderahlo dirt from factory chimneys, locomotive*, ami aunl.

Thors would be a note¬ worthy difforonco in tho instaUation, operating, and depreciation costa of tlte two equipmeuts, and tlua dilference would counterbal¬ ance to a considerable extent the difference in cost of raw materiel storage. It is possible that in the use of the cliip loft more care would have to he exercised in using hurds because of the tendency of tho bast til*, r to cause lodgments, but this should not be considered a serious dilliculty. Ttie weight of hurda which are capable of being chargod into a rotary is a decidedly unfavorable factor. The weight of a cubie foot of hurds varies aoniowhat with the proportion of bast fiber, but averages about 6.4 pounds, which, compared with a cubic foot of |M«pl*r chips at 8.U3 jamiid*, represents a digester charge of 00.6 )**r cent of the weight of a |>oplar-wood charge, or, in terms of filler ca|>acity, tho hurds charge would yield 38.6 por cent aa much fibor as lbs wood charge. 'Hie hurds upon being balod fur transporta¬ tion may be broken and crushed to such a degree that the weight of the charge may be increased, and it might be found possible to incroaso the charge weight by steaming or by the employment of Uniping devices. This small weight of charge constitutes one of the most serious objections to lbs use of hurds in paper manufacture. In tiiose tests in which tbo most satisfactory reaulte were obtained, the cooking conditions were 20.6 per cent of caustio soda at a concen¬ tration of 107 grams por liter and a causticity of 84.0 per cent acting at a temperature of 170* C. fur five bourn, or a total time of seven hours. Tho steam condensation in the rotary uaod for these test^ was abnormally high, duo to the fact that the steam supply pipe wsa uncovered for a considerable distance and the roUry was entirely uncovered. It is believed, therefore, that a larger amount of caustio was necessary than would otherwise have been the case. This belief is strengthened by the quality of the weaU liquor from one of tlio later cooks, wluch gave on analyse 18.86 grama per liter of free caustic soda end showod e causticity of 27.76 per cent. Those date show tlist only 67.3 per cent of the total caustic employed was actu¬ ally consumed in the cooking operation, which percentage is lower than obtaiu* in practice. Tbs slock from this cook was bloached witii 11.5 pe r cont of blesch. Out even aa the figures staud, the comparison with poplar cookiug practice is se follows: 28.6 per ceut caustic soda used as sgaiust 22 to 26 per cent; 107 grams per liter as against 100 to 110; 84 por cent causticity is little different thau obtains in practice; 170° 0. is about commercial praotice; five hourf at pressure se against four to six hours; eevan hours' total time eg tlEM 1’ IIUKbti AS 1'AI‘KII-MAKING MATIUIAI.. 23 against |M>HHibly Mix to oiglil hums; 11.6 |>cr cunt hluurli u* agalii*l 8 to 1U por cent. Thus, it is evident that the cooking comhlimm omployud were slightly more severe and uX|»eu*ivo limn llm-ai in commercial use with |Miplur wood. The yield of lotul liber obtained fioin the hurds may be pill red at 35 per cunt of boiio-ilry liber udrubilcd oil ibo Is.nu-dry weight of hurd# used, or 33.1 per cunt of uir-dry lilmr cnlciilalcil mi air-dry hurds.

From a small test on a largo calender stack it was readily shown that tlio pu|Mir produeod is c.upalilo of taking a satisfactory lini-.li. This comparison, satisfactory in many ros|Mtc.ls, develops two factors which aru decidudly iinfavorahlo to hemp hinds, namely, raw- uiaterial storage and digester capacity, and they must ho taken into full account in considering tho paper-making value of this materia), although it should ho recognized tlmt investigation may result in the material improvement of those conditions. Moreover, it is not at all iinprohuhlo that further investigation would dovnlnp more satisfac¬ tory treating conditions and inure suitable funu-di compositions, ami tlio belief in this possibility is strengthened by the fact that material progress was being luudo lit the conclusion of this preliminary work.

Tliey are manufnelured illicitly, and that ia the price that the peddlers generally pet for them. Senator Davia. That la per ciparette, and not per parkageT Mr. 11 rstcr. That ia per ciparette. Senator Davih. For one ciparette? Mr llr.BTCfi. That ia right. Inhibitions are releaaed. Aa a reault of theae etTcets, many violent eriinea have l»een ami are being committed by peraona under the influence of thia drug. Not ooly ia marihuana uaed by hardened criminala to eteel them to eommit violent crimes, hut it ia alao Iming placed in tha hands nf high-achool children in the form of marihuana cigarettes by unacmpuloua peddlera. lta continued use reaulta many times in impotanoy and insanity. •Two objectives have dictated the form of H. R. 600fi, flrat, tha development of a plan nf taxation which will raise revenue and at tho aaine time render extremely difficult the acquisition of marihuana by peraona who desire it for illioit uaea, and second, the development of an adequate means of publicising dealings in marihuana in order to tax ami control tha traffic e(Teclively This hill ia modeled upon both the Harriaon Narootio Act ami the National Firenrma Act, which were designed to accomplish these same general objectives with respect to opium and coca leaves, and firearms, respectively. Under the provisions of thia hill all legitimate handler* of marihuana are required lo pay occupational taxes aa follows: Manufacturera, compounders, and importers, $24 |wr year; producers, $fi per year: dealers, $3 per year; practitioners (doctors, dentists, vetorinariea, an« other of like character), ami peraona who use marihuana for experi¬ mental purposes, SI per year. These persona, in addition to paving the occupational tax, must register with tho collector of internal rev¬ enue and file information returns aa to their dealinge in marihuana. However, aa an additional means of hringinp the traffic in marihuana into the open, the hill require# all transfers of marihuana to he made in pursuance of offirial order forms issued hy the Secretary of tho Treasury, upon which the details of the transaction are act forth. In order to raise additional revenue and to prevent transfers to persona who would use marihuana for undesirable purposes, a transfer tax is imposed U|>ou aach transfer of marihuana. Upon transfers to regis¬ tered |*eraons, this tax is $1 per ounce, while, upon transfers to non- registered person, who under ordinary circumstances will Ire the illicit users of marihuana, a heavy tax of $100 j*er mines ia imposed. Heavy erimiual penalties are provided for manufacturing, producing, or deal¬ ing in marihuana without registering and paying the special /a.xea, for IratiatiMTinp nuiriiiuaim not in pursuance of an oruei loim, sou lor acquiring marihuana without payment of the transfer tax. Thus, the loll is designed, through the occupational tax and the order form procedure, to publicise legitimate dealings in marihuana and through the $100 transfer tax to prevent the drug from coming into the hands of those who will put it to illicit uses. The production slid sale of hemp and its products for industrinl piirpnir* will not l>e adversely affected hy this hill. In general, I lie term \"marihuana\" ia defined in Hie hill so ss to include only the flower- ing lops, leaves, and eeeda of the hemp plant and to exclude the nurture stalk, oil, ami meal obtained from the seeds of tlie plant, and sterilized •eed, incapable of fferminatinn. Under this definition of \"luarihusna' , the hemp producer will pat - a small occupational tax hut his fihor products will he entirely exempt from tho provisions of the bill, including the order form and transfer tax provisions. Senator IIhown. That meant the farmer will pay $5? Mr llpoTen. That is right Senator linnwN. That is all ha will have to pay? Mr. IIbstka. That is all he will have to pay. Senator Drown. And it makes no difference how extensive his acreage is? Mr. IIs*Trn. No. *5 it the limit. Senator Drown. It it $5 whether he cultivates en ecre or 10 seres? Mr HrsTr.n. That ia right. The same is true of aeed produced by tha hemp grower for sale for the furt her production of the plant, for the manufacture of oil or for birdseed, except that aueh trsnsfers will be made subject to regulations designed to prevent diversion of the seed for illegal usee. Similarly, the manufacturera of oil and the byproduct# of aeed, aueh •« hemp seed cake and meal, will pay an occupational tax. hut their purchases of seed and aalea of aueh oil, oake, and meal will he entirely exempt from the proviaiona of the bill except that purchases of surli seed will he subject to regulations designed to prevent diversion. Manufacturer# of birdseed will aieo pay an occupational tax, but their purcltaaes of seed will be exempt from the transfer tax and order form proviamna of the bill, if carried out in accordance with regula¬ tion*. Further, under the definition of marihuana, the hill will not apply to their tales of kirdoeed, if the hemp aeed contained therein ia •terilixed so aa to be incapable of germination. 1 might any at thia point that thia provision with respect to the birdseed was worked out with tbs birdseed people, ami those who appro red before the Ways and Means Committee approved that provision. Now, this ia an important provision, this particular provision riplik, here that we are discussing. Not withstanding, as already shown, that under Hie hill the pm- dueers of Itetitn will only pay a small occupational tax and make their purr I macs ami sales of aeed subject to regulations, some suggestion lias been made that the producer! he entirely eliminated from the bill. Such an exemption, however, it believed to be impossible. The mip«isition of an occupational tax enahles the Government constitutionally to make it illegal to engage in the occupation without payment of tlie tax. Thus, unless the Congresa’in this hill imposes «r an ««t-M|i*uonal Us upon Use producers of hemp, f’ungrrsa cannot make tha production of heinp lor illicit pnr|w>ses illegal. Hence, if the occupational Ux ia not imposed upon producers, marihuana niay lie legally produced for illicit puqmaes Furthermore, the imposition of an occupational tax enables the Government to rcqujre the Ux- paver to furnish information in 1 connection with the business taxed. This would permit the Government to ascertain where the legitimate production of henip is being carried on, and, having this information, it can strtmp out the illicit product ion more effectively. Obviously, therefore, the legitimate producers of hemp cannot be furl her exempted from the proviaiona of the bin. < Hherwise, the hill cannot be enforced. Aside from tho reasons sUled na to why it is believed to lie impossible to further exempt the producers of hemp from the provisions of tho lull, attention is invited to the fact that the primary pur|Nwo of this legiMlatinn is to raise revenue. That completes my sUicment, ami we have witnesses prnaent. Senator Davis. Do 1 nndereUnd you to say that the primary purpose of the bill ie to rmiee revenue? Mr. IIestk*. The primary purpose of this legislation must lie to raise revenue, because we are resorting to tho Uxinjr clause of the Constitution and the rule is that if nn the fare of the hill it appears to lw a revenue hill, the courts will not inquire into any other motives tluit the Congress may liava had in enacting this legislation. This bill ia modeled’on the Harrison Narrolice Act and the National Firearm# Act. The Harriaon Narcotics Aot lias been suaUiuiod by tha Supreme Court, the fire! lime hy a 6-to-4 decision, and a second time by a tWto-3 derision. Tlie Supreme Court in March of this veer sustained tlie ronstitutionalily of the National Firearms Act, insofar as it related to the occupational Ux. . Senator Davis. Tlie Harriaon Narcotice Act you say waa before the Supreme Court twice. Was tliere a change in the judges between the time of the first decision and the time of the second derision? Mr. Hbstkn. I do not know whether there was a now judge placed upon the liencli at that time or not, hut the vote was (V to 3 the second time. That was ennie years later. .... Senator Davis. What was the date of tha 0-to-3 derision. Mr. If Ratten. ITC7. ... Senator Davis. Justien Slone went on the Court at that time? Mr. II wrrnn. He went on the Court in the Coolnlge administration. Senator Davis. That is right. Mr. IlnsTtn. Yes; he was on. Senator Davis. When wse the first derision? . Mr. IIrstkr. The first decision was about 1018. I think it wae about that time. . Sennlor Drown. Mr. Heater, will you give us a iiimmary of the history of SUte legislation respecting marihuana? Mr.' IIrstrr. Kvery SUte in the Union has legislation regulating the traffic in marihuana. Senator Drown. Is there fairly uniform law on the subject among the States? .. . „ Mr. IIrstrr. Yea; it is fairly uniform. In aoine States they pro¬ hibit entirely all production of marihuana. 1 think there are six States that prohibit the production nf marihuana, and it probably could he constitutionally done hy the Congreaa. Senator DroWn. That is, there could be a prohibition? Mr. Ilr.sr>:ii. That is rigid. Hut you would luiye lo prohibit it entirely, and of coume you would put all of these legitimate imluslrh * out of buaineee. Tim Auprrme Court lisa held that where on the lacr of act it appears lo be a taxing measure, the fact that it happens to he prohibitive in character will not slfeet the ronstitutionalily of it. Dot we have tried throughout this measure not to interfere materially * ith the production of marihuana, hut to permit it, and to do it in a manner which will enable the Government to stamp out this illicit traffic m the sale of it. Senator Drown. Say you ere in thia situation: You hare a plant that produces Severn) articles that are valuable commercially. Mr. II rstrr. That is right. Senator RnowN. At the same time, ss a byproduct the leaves and tho seeds ran be used for innrihuana7 M r. 11 rstrr. That ia right. Senator Drown. That is the deleterious part of it. Mr. II bster. That ia correct. Senator Drown. Aa Senator Davie auggeete, I think it would U valuable if you would summarise the state legislation, first informing us as to what the fairly uniform general legislation is upon the subject, and then giving us the names of tlie States that have prohibited (lie use of marihuana. Mr. 11 rstrr. Mny we prepore a memorandum for inclusion in Hie record on that because we really do qot have that at the moment? Senator Drown. Yce.

Thwt is terrible. Mr. Anslinobr. That is one of the worst rases that has mm* to my attention, and it is to show you it* relation to crime that 1 am putting those two letters in the record. Senator Brown. The first letter is also very interesting. Mr. Anslinorr. This first letter wa* from an attorney at Houston, In June of this year, at Oeneva, an international committee of ex¬ pert* in going over the reports receivod from all over tho world said tiiat the report* thus far indicate that the medical value of the cannaht* derivative* i* very doubtful. There i* another report here from Dr. I‘mil Nicholas fjpcc.li— — Senator Brown. That is, to make if perfectly clear, its medical value is not very groat, and there are many other drugs that may be used in place of it that are fully a* good if not better? Mr. Ansmnuku. Yes, sir; it i* not indispensable. Senator Brown. 1 think some medical men sav that if wo hail no aueh drug at all the medical profession would not he very greatly hamlieapiied. Tlnil is. medieai seienee would not be very greatly handicapped. Mr. ANSMNor.ii. I think liter are pretty generally in agreement that ils use could he nhnmloncif without any suffering. 1 have a few rase* hero that I would just like to tell the committee about. In Alamosa, Colo., they seem to Im having a lot of difficulty. The citizens petitioned l.’ongivs* for Itcln, in addition to tho help that i* given them under the State law in Kansas and Now Mexico also we have had a great deni of trouble Here is a typical illustration: A 15-year-old boy, found mentally deranged from smoking marihuana cigarettes, furnished enough information to th* |N#lieo officers to lead to the seizure of 15 pounds of mntiloians. That was seized in s garage in an Ohio town. These hoys hail I teen gelling marihuana at a playground, ami the *u)>ervi*nr* there Imd horn peddling it to children, hut they got rather alarmed when they saw these lioys developing the habit, and particularly when this'boy began to gn insane. In Florida some years ago we hod the rase of a 20-year-old bov who killed lu* brothers, a sister, anti his parents whilo under tho influence of marihuana. i Kecently, in Ohio, there ws* a gong of very young men, all under 20 years of sge, every one of whom confessed I hat they had committed some .1.8 holdups while under the influence of the drug, In another place in Ohio a young man shot Ilia hotel dork while trying to hold him up. His defense was that he waa under the influence of marihuana. Senator Brown. When a person smokes tho cigarette, how long lines the influence of the drug continue? Mr. Anslinobr. From report* coming to me, I think it might last as long as -IK hours before the effect* of (lie drug fully wear o/r. Senator Brown. 1 do not know whether it wn* your arlielo I rend, or an article from aomo other source, but I understand that experi¬ ments have been conducted, in which Hie persons smoking tho mnri- hunna have been kept under control nfter taking the drug. Do you know whother or not that demonstrated how long tho drool would be fell? Mr. Ansmnorr. Ab 1 rememlier it, the effect* in those roses were something like 48 hours, before they fully returned to their norinsl *00*4**. Ilrre is a case in Usllimore, where a young man committed rape while under the influence of marihuana. He was hanged for if. J>nst fall, about September, wo uncovered a field of several arms, growing right outside the city limits of Baltimore. Those men were selling it to New York, sending it all over the country, at $21) a pound. Senator Davis. And now many pounds to tli« acre? Mr. Anslinobr. That all would depend, Senator. If they ju-i took the flowering tops the yield would not be so big,; but room of them strip off the leaves and the flowering tops and grind them up. 9enator Dana. Do the leave* bar* the seme effect a* the llowenng top? ... Mr. Anslinobr. Yes, sir; one of the Treasury's chemist* is here, who can verify that, sir. It has been proved by experts in other countries, *ho have analyzed the leaves. They find that the resin is also present in the leaf. Our experiments have not shown the pres¬ ence of anv drug in thematuresUlk, though. At one time we thought that the dnngerous principle was only in the flowering top, hut that ia not true. What fed us to the study aa to whether there was re*in in the leaves ws* the fact that we hail seen so much of this stuff rollnl up. In some cases only the leaves had been crushed, and they •reined to be giving the effect. In New Mexico officers sent us about 4 or A pounds of nothing but leaves, and some of that particular shipment nail Iroen the cause of the killing of a police officer, and also the killing of a man within the ring. Every day we have such seizure* reported. Senator Brown. Is the cigarette that is made from the flowering ton more pofont than the one made from the leaves? Mr. Anslinobr. Yes, sir; it would be, because the tope hare the reein concentrated. Senator Brown. Do I understand that the seed ie ground up, ton, and used to any extent? Mr. Ansunobr. Well, we have heard of them smoking the seed. .Senator Brown. Does it produce the tame effect? Mr. Anslinobr. I am not qualified to say. We hare not made any experiments a* to that, but we do know that the seed has born smoked I think that the proposition of the seed people sterilizing the seed by heat and moisture will certainly do a lot to kill this traffic. I think that that one thing might cut this traffic in half, bemuse much of the trouble we encounter ia due to the trafficker going to a feed store snd buying the birdseed end planting cannabis, and else due to birdseed being scattered during the winter. Hempsoed is thrown out in the garden or in the recant lot. Tlie following year you have a growth of cannabis. That ia wbat happened in Baltimore, and particularly in Philadelphia. I know of a case there where the State officers got over 200,000 pounds of growing plant*, a* the result of dissemination by birdseeds. A lot of that growth wa* being u«ed illicitly. The trafficker* knew where to get it. The plant resee d ed itself. The action that will b* taken under thia bill by the birdseed people in sterilizing the seed should bare a remarkable effect in killing thia traffic. Senator Brown. The sterilised eeed will not reproduce? Mr. Anslinobr. It will re-seed iteelf. Senator Brown. 1 xm referring to the birdseed. What are they going to do to the birdeeed? Mr. Anslinobr. They are going to kill the germinating power. Senator Brown. When the Reed is then thrown out, what will happen? Mr. ANeuNoxR. Nothing will happen. Senator Davis. Will it be of any use aa a birdseed? Mr. Ansi.inobr. Oh, yes. It will still hare fowl properties. JTRG-4T-• A 4 * 10 TAXATION Or MARIHUANA Senator Drown. The birds will sing ju*t the same? Mr. Anslinurti. There ie annie question almul that. Sterilization is a voluntary action l»y the birdseed (icoiile. Senator Brown. That ia not in thia hill? Mr. Anslinobr. It is not in there. They voluntarily agreed to do thnl under this art. Mr. IIritkr. Yes. it is in the hill. Senator Brown. I want to bring out one fact that you have not touched upon yet. Aa I understand it mnnhtinnn is not s habit- reducing drug, at least to |he same extent that opium ia, for instance, t is somewhat easier to hrenk the habit in the nine of marihuana than it i* in the case of opium smoking? Mr. Anslinobr. Yes, you have stated that correctly. Senator. Tt is s very difficult matter to hrenk the opium habit. However, this habit cun ho broken. There ia some evidence thnl it ia hsbiInforming. The experta have opt gone very far oil that. Senator Brown. There ia the impression that it is stimulating to a curiaiu extent? ft ia used hy criminals when they want to go out and icrfonn some deed that they would not commit in their ordinary mine of ntind? Mr. Anslinobr. That wae demonstrated hy these seven boy*, who said they di<l not know wliat they were doing after they smoked marihuana. They conceived Hie seriee of crimes whilo in a state of innrihunna intoxication. Senator Davis. How many cigarettes would you have to smoke before you got this vicious mental attitude towsnl your neighbor? Mr, Ansunobr. I believe in some ra*e* one rignrette might de¬ velop a homicidal mania, probably to kill his brother. It ffopenda on llie physical characteristics of the individual. Every individual react* differently to the drug. It stimulates some and others it depresses. It is im|»ossihle to sav just what the artion of the drug will l»e on a given individual, or the amount. Probably some people could smoko live before it would teke effect, hut all the export* agree that the continued use leads to insanity. There ore jmany caeca of insanity. Senator Hrrrino. Ia it every type of hemp that contains thia drug, -or is it just some psrticular type? Mr. Anslinobr. There is only one species. Senator Hbriuno. There ia only one species of hemp? Mr. Ansunobr. Yes, sir; there are different forms, but only one sporiee. Senator Brown. This thought ha* impressed mC: 1 read with rare the supplemental statement which you placed iu the record before tho Ways and Means Committee, in which you brought out quite clearly that the use, which will he \"illicit\" if we may describe it that way, in the event this hill heroines a law, tin* hern known to the peoples of Europe and Mexico and the United States for centuries. Mr. Anblinokr. That ia right. Senator Brows. Do you think that the recent great increase in the use of it that has taken*placo in the United States is probably duo to the heavy hand of the law, in it* effect upon the use of other drugs, and that persona who desire a stimulant are turning to thia because of enforcement of the Harrison Narcotics Act and the State laws? Mr. Ansunobr. We do not know of any case* where the opium user has transferred to marihuana. There is an entirely new class of people using marihuana. The opium user ia around 35 to 40 years old. Theso users ere 20 years old, and know nothing of heroin nr morphine. Senator Brown. What has cawed the new disBwniocUmi of it? We did not hear anything of it until the last year or bo. Mr. Ansunobr. I do not think that the war againet opium has tery much bearing upon the situation. That same question has been discussed in other countries; in Egypt particularly,*where a great deal of hasheesh is used, they tried to show that the marihuana user went to heroin, and when heroin got sliort he jumped back to hasheesh, but thnl ia not true. Thia is an entirely different class. 1 do not know just why th* abuse of marihuana has spread like wildfire in the last 4 nr 5 years. -Senator Brown, Could you gw lie any retimate of the number of person* that are engaged in this illicit traffic? Please state that as nearly ns you can. Mr. Ansunobr. I can only give you what our records show, Senator. Thor* were about 400 arrest* throughout the Slates in the year. Senator Brown. That ia for violations of Slate law? Mr Ansunobr. For violations of 8tnt* law. That would not include the arrest* in California, where l understand they have several hundred a year; but the figure 1 am giving you of 400 arrest* would he about the average mimlwr that are being picked up now, under just n noncoonlinated enforcement policy, every Stele doing it* own work, and bringing us in occasionally. When thev run into \"d«|H*\" we go down and say, \"It is marihuana and you take the rase.” The State of Ohio recently seised what we cell a \"plant.\" It wa* a seizure of marihuana. Those people had a mailing list of 0,000 cus¬ tomers scattered throughout the State*. Senator Davis. How were they dispensing it? Mr. Ansunobr. They were selling it in lot* from a pound down, just selling it by mail. Senator Brown. There wa* nothing in the law to prevent a man in Columbus. Ohio, u*ing the mail in aeiling it to a person in Lnuin- ville, Kentucky? Mr. Ansmnorr. No: they are doing it every day. Sonntor Davib. Is there anything in tho present bill to prevent thorn using the mail? Mr. Anslinobr. Under Ihia bill it would have to be tax-paid, and all of Hint would be illicit, sir. Sonntor 11 BRntNO. You any there ere several hundred arrest* in California alone, and about that same number throughout tho rr*t of the United States? Mr Ansunobr. There are about that same number in the rest of tho United State*. Senator Herring. How do you*Recount for that? Is it because of their State law? M r Anrunoir, It ia because they have r Stale enforcement a gene v there They vigorously enforce the law. I might any thnl Peuusvi- vnnia is doing important work nl»o. Senator Hr.RRiN0.Jt might be just as prevalent in other Slates, but for the fact that we do not have the lew enforced m efficiently? Mr. Ansungbr. I would not ear it ia a* prevalent, hilt certainly llw use has increnaod in th* 1**1 few year*. In Penoerlvania tha enforcement peop.e ,*re very active tndar, particularly at Pittsburgh And Philadelphia, and they arc constantly calling upon us. Senator Davis. Ara they enforcing the Harrison Narcotic* Act in a mu 11 nor satisfactory to you? Mr. Anrlinoer. Yaa, air; that is satisfactory, hut they arc asking us for help every now and then when they run into a rather large ritual ion. -* ■ 011811 r Brown. I Hi ink* that while y r it are on that point you had hetti r make clear the need for Prderel legislation. You say the States have asked you to do that. I pre-ume if is because of the freedom of interstate traffic that the 8 tele* require this legislation? Mr. Anslinobr. We have hail request* from State* to step in be¬ cause they claimed it wa* not growing in that State, hut that it wa* coming in from another Slate. Senator Brown. And they onuld not tourh that? Nir. Ansunobr, And they could not touch it and we could not touch it There ia need for coordinated effort. We are required to report to the League of Nations, under a treaty arrangement, all of th* seizure* of marihu«na made throughout the United State*. It is rather difficult to got, I would *ay, half of them. One particular reason ami ono primary r*a*on for this ia—usually these complaint* come to us first—that there ia \"dope\" being used in a certain place, and that there ia a supply of it on a certain street. Our men gn nnd investigate it, and they find it ia marihuana. Well, we have to call in the State officers, ami there ia a lot of lost effort. Very often hv the time the Slate officer come* the case is gone. I would **j in most of thee* case* we get the information firal and turn it over to the State officer. Now, we want to coordinate all of that work throughout the States. By State and Federal cooperation we can make a good dent in this traffic. ► or instance, all State* had narcotic law* before the enactment of the Harrison Narcotics Act, hut until the Federal Government stepped in no substantial progress waa made. Senator Brown. What haye you U> say about the extent of tha production of hemp? May it be produced in practically any State hi Hie Union? Mr. Analinorr. Yea, air; it can be produced. Senator Brown. Thera ia climatically no reason why it could not be produced everywhora in the United States? Mr. Anslinobr. No. Senator Brown. Growing aa a weed, could take place anywhere? Mr. Ansunobr. Anywherejyae, air. That ha* been demonstrated. Senator Davib. A moment ago l asked you what waa the yield per acre, and you then told me so much nt the flower and ao much of the leaves.

Now, Commissioner Analinfrr, 1 do not know whether you ere the heetmen to answer lliia question, or Mr. Heater. What danger*, if sny, doe« this hill here for the persons engaged in the legitimate tiers of the hemp plant? Mr. Anri.inokr. 1 would sny they are not only ainplr pro ter ted under thin act, hut they can go ahead and raise hemp just a* thev have Always done it. Senator Drown. It has been represented to me that the fanner might hesitate to grow hemp when he is not only subjected In a fft tax hut also to the supervision by the Government, or what vnu might call the \"nosing'’ of the Government into his business. \\V)»al have you to say as to Uist proposition? Mr. Ansmnobr. Well, I would aay the answer to that is the fart that they are already controlled under State legislation. Senator Drown. In praolirally every Slate in the Union. Mr. ANatiNOBR. Not all the Statee, but cerlainlv in a lot of hemp- growing State* they are controlled. In most of the State* cultivation is prohibited, hut in some States they are regulated by liennae. Senator Drown Administratively, it seems you have charge of the administration of the tax and the collection of the ta<? Mr. Anslinobr. Yes, sir. Senator Drown. Just what would happen? We will taka a farmer living the other side of Alexandria, over in Virginia. Just what would happen to him if he wanted to grow 2 acre* of hemp? What would he have to do? Mr. Anslinobr. He would go down to the collector of internal revenue and put down his $5 and get a regietration, a stamp tax. That would permit him to grow under the act, and at the end of the year- Senator Brown. That is a stamp tax similar to ths one a doctor gets who usee a narcotic? Mr. Anslinobr. Yea, sir' ths same kind of s tax. .Senator Drown. Hs would hang that up in hit house? Mr. Anslinobr. Yet, sir. At the end of ths year we would just ask him how much he grew. Senator Baoww. Would you not go down and look hie field over, to ascertain whether or not he was making any illicit use of the otherwise worthless byproduct? As I understand it there is no legielslion about the use of thepetals or the (lower or of these leaves. Mr. Anslinobr. & far yery few of these hemp people have been involved. Well, they have not been involved in the illicit traffic st all Tide case in Texas is the onJv case I know of. We were not going to supervise his crop. It would not be possible. Senator Drown. 1 do not mean that, hut suppose Uiat some fellow comes along and eays, \"I will give you 1100 to let me go in end strip your leaves and top flower* from your hemp cron.\" I low would vnu cover that? How would you meet a situation of that kind? Mr. Anslinorr. Certainly under the act, if the farmer agreed In ths*. they would both he guilty of conspiracy to violate ths set. Senator Drown. Hut you would exercise no particular supervision over the growing of that crop? \\ ID TAXATION or MAflfflfTANA Mr. Anslinokr. The exerrise would he in this way: If we see Mr. Dewey Do-**, the phntngrnph of sinew place I showed you. go in and pay l r » lo I he collector, we would wit felt Hint We would l*e very careful to see what dis|»osiiion he made of that, lint we would certainly know the sheep from Ihe goals without any dose general supervision. Senator Drown. I do not think you would have any trouble with legitimate manufacturers, because they are dealing with the Govern¬ ment; hut the fanner himself might he a little disposed not to grow the hemp, kmming of the illicit, use that, might !*e made of a part of his rmp. Mr. .\\NaLiNnr.R. It is just an infnnnation return. 'Hint is all we would he interested in, iiideae he would conspire with someone else to have the crop stripped. But one saving feature aliout this whole thing so fer as the farmer it concerned is that the crop is rut before the resin reaches the nth state. Senator ItnowN. Before it reaches its greatest potency? Vr Ansi.inokr. In oilier words, before it reaches its greatest potency. 1*here is some resin thst comes tin through the plant, hut if ho is a, legitimate hemp producer he will cut it down before the resin makes its nppeeranco. I Senator Drown. You had before the Ways end Means Committee two sntnplrs of the plant. Do you happen to have sny of those samples here? Mr. Hrstkr. >Ve do not have them hare this morning. Ws ran get t|m*e \"n'nples for vnu. Mr. Anslinokr. The plant which I have in iny hand now ran he easily distinguished as you are going along Uie road. Senator Davis. You can see that along all the highways of the country, Mr Anslinokr. Well, Senator Davis, that will grow up 10 feet. Senator Daws. How high? Mr. Aksi.inohr. Sixteen feet. Senator Davis Sixteen feet? Mr. Anslinokr. Sixteen feel. Of course, when they are email like that you eaminl distinguish them. Senator Drown. At what height are they usually harvested? Mr. Anklinnkh. Almul 14 or 1(1 feet. Senator Drown. At that height? Mr. Ansi.inokr. Not for homp production. That is for resin. Senator Drown. I mean for hemp production. Mr Anslinokr. Oh, for hemp production, l would say around 10, 12, 14 fuel; hut it ie certainly before the re*in get* up there to do the damage. Senator Drown. Are there any other questions that any member wants to ssk Mr. Amdingrr? Mr Anklinorr. What is the return In the farmer per acre? Mr. Anslinokr. I do not know. The hemp people hero could tell yon what ilir return is, hut I understand it is around *3(1. Senator Drown. Dors it require intensive cultivation? Mr. Anslinokr. I do not think so. Senator IlKnniNO. It is a reed that will grow, is it not? Mr. Anslinokr. H will grow without any trouble. In fact, a lot of these illicit Irn flicker* will try to hide llieir field with com. They will grow com all around it. Well, the hemp will shoot right up above the com, and will grow 4 or 5 feet higher. TAXATION Or MAIIIMUANA |q Mr, IImtkr. Before we complete our raae I think we ought to sav one word on the regulations, if 1 may? Senator Drown. Yea: we shall be glad to have that. Mr. IIkstkr. From time immemorial it has been Hie policy of Congresa in imposing tstes and in providing for exemptions under certain conditions from the itupxmitinn of those taxes, to provide that the exemptions will be made under regulations to he prrwrilmd liv the ComniiMMuticr of Internal Revenue. Take for example in this particular esse, in the Revenue Act of 1032 thev provided that automobile parts and accessories should U* exempt from taxes if the manufacturer sells them to a manufacturer who is going to make a complete automobile or truck. In order lo get that exemption the manufacturer who in going to yell that part of an automobile or truck to the other manufacturer, who is going to tnnke a completed truck, cannot got that exemption except under regulations Vo be proscribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Commissioner merely requires him to obtain a certificate from tho other manufacturer that this part w to he used in the manufacture of a completed truck. In this pnrticulsr we have exacllv the same situation here, ami we nre simply following the practice, I sar, that Congress has followed for time iiutnemorisl in revenue acts. The fanner here will not even have to go to the Collector’s office. All he will have to do * ill lw merely to mail in his 1ft, and they will send him the stamp fax ami Hie registration. At the end of the year he will make an information return as to how much land he lies under cultivation tnd what dis¬ position lie has marie of it, «* When ho wants to sell his crop of seeds all he will have to do finder the regulations of the Treasury Department will he to obtain mmii*- evidence from the person to whom he selle it, Uiat that itermw is entitled to the exemption. That ia the situation with respect to the eeed, which is Hie important Hem involved here so far as Uie domestic interests are concerned. Of course the fiber products are entirely out of the hill. That completes our esse. Senator Drown. Mr. Hester, what or* you going to do with rrspecl to the Urge number of farmers who are not going to know about this law in its earlier stages of enforcement? it seems lo me that with the lack of dissemination of informaUon, a great many of them are going lo engage perhaps in a legitimate production of it, not knowing of Hus law. Are you rather harsh toward those fellows, or can you lie reasons hie and generous toward them? Mr. IIkstkr. No, the bill will not become effective for fiO days, ami there are not a great many of these hemp producers in Hie United States. Of course Uie Treasury Department would do everything it possibly could to notify these people. There would be no hardship imposed upon Uiem. pi is would be administered exactly as sm¬ other revenue act ie administered, and frequentlv there srr r\\n«e taxes imposed where the ordinary individual does hot know anrthing •bout it. Senator Drown. What legitimate uses are now made of the hnnp plant, in the United States. That ia, what causes the farmer to raise v 20 taxation ok MMUMUANA Mr IIkstbr. Some raise it for seeds Senator Drown. Do von mean birdseeds? Mr. IIcatbr. Yet. They raise the seeds for use in the maniifiirture of birdseed. They make oil out of it. Most of the seed, however, thst is used in the luanufurture of oil is imported from Manchuria, but it inav develop in this country Then after Uie seeil is used for Uie making of oil, they lake Uml seed ami crush it, and make meal and meal cake, and that is sold to cattle rwi’M'rs. The oil is uaed in the manufacture of vemish and paint and snnp and linoleum, and Uirn in ths case of the mature stalk they use Hint for making liber and liber product*. Of courso, Uiey aru entirely outside the hill. Senator Davis. While primarily you are placing a tax, it ie for the •ole pur|HMs of getting an enforcement of the law, and getting a plan for enforcing it? Mr. Hestbr. That ie correct. Senator Davis. If it should lie II, what difference would Uiat make? Mr. IlhaTBR. Well, the situation ie ennply this- Senator Davis, l am only talking now of the farmer*# point of view, of charging him II instead of 15. Mr. If kstkm- I am glad yon raised that point, Senator Davie. When Uin Damson Act wna first before the Supreme Court the occupational lax was only 11, and Uie vote was ft to 4. In other words, Uie Supreme Court said, \"This ia a rovenue measure\", although the lux woe only II Uut the vote woe 6 to 4. After that Congress raised the occupatioipil lax and then when the case came before the Supremo Court Uie vote was 0 to 3, and the Court said, \"We now have moro reason to sustain the constitutionality of tliia act Uian we had liefore, because it w more of a revenue act than it wne then.\" In llio csaeoif producer*, under tho Harrison Narcotics Act, although there are no poppies grown in this country, thore ie a classification in Uio ilarnson Narcolice Act for producers. The rate ie $24. If fanners raise poppies in this country, if they could develop it so that thov could raise poppies, ao that Uiey could get opium from it, the farmer wuuld have to pay $24; but in Una case the producer only T e have left Uie practitioner at St, because that was the situation of the llarriaon NarcoUcs Act, and that is the real reason why the figures are set in this hill at $24, $6,13, and 11, ao that wa can have a real revenue-raising measure. Senator Davis. You charge $6 an acre under this? Mr. Hbstbb. Ob, no—a year. Senator Da via. 1 meant to say this: You charge $6, whether he produces on 1 acre or oo 1,000 acres? Mr. llaeTKK. That ie right. Senator Drown. Have you worked out the Canal Zone matter with Uie Department? Mr, 11 kstch. We have. They wish to be exempted, and they have agreed not to proposo their amendment providing lor direct regulation of marihuana m the sons because as I pointed out to you the other day it might indicate on the face of the hill that it ia a regulatory measure, hut they wish to he exempted, and we havo no objection. We wo preparing to change that. iA.tAlHM VI liAtUUVAit.k Koiiulor Drown. Juat one or two more matter*. Why should they ho cxniiinted? Mr. IIkhtkh. There is no legitimate buaineae in the Canal Zone, sod Uiey say Uiat Uiey have •ufficiant control over tbe marihuana iinddcm in Uio xmtu at Hue time under existing legislation, and they object to general legislation being applied. Senator Umown. It would probably be coiuidarable duplication of effort down there Mr. IIkhtkr, There might he aome. The Harrison Narroties Art applies Ui the Canal Zone, aud that ia the reaeou why it was included in tliia hill. But Uie Treasury Department baa no objection if the Cansl Zone goes out. Somitor IIhown. Will Una entail any considerable increase in |ier- •onnol fur (lie Department? Mr. ) Ilsur. No, l do not Uiink so. Mr. Anklinusr. No, sir Senator Drown. J understand tliia measure baa lb# approval of the Treasury Department. Mr. IIkstkr Yes Oh, yes; it ia strongly recommended by the Treasury Department. Senator Drown, la there anything further from the Government? Do you desire to have a r.liomwt testify? Mr. II c an, ii. 1 think we linva finished our esse. Senator Drown. Very well.

This company was organised 3 years ago by Bell Bros., of Munrie, Ind., and tlie Sloan Interests, who are textile |ieoplf ill New York. They had in mind developing a process wliereh* a fiber that is now being used for rope and cordage could he furl tier processed to go into textiles, and aleo that tho hurd or the woody part rould be proreesexl and made into plastic*. Three years ego ue planted 4,200 nerrs, last year 1,200 acres, and this year 7,000 acres, and we lire in operation. The capacity of the plant is If),000 acres. We have to contract our seed from the growers in Kentucky, that was covered by Mr. Kens, and their acreage runs anywhere from a quarter of au acre up, and we have ho objection to the bill. In fact, any attempt to prevent the paaaage of a bill to protect tho narcotic traffic would be unethical ami un-American. That is not the point, but we do bclicx’e that a tax of *6 ia going to be prohibitive for the small dealer ns well ns the man that grows the hemp; not nnlv the seed dealer, but the man that grows the crop, because he will average— 1 do not know what the average will be, hut they raise ns little ns 2 acres.

FEUKUAKY II. IV9U In Global-Warming Debate, Skeptics Corral Bush With a Policy of Inaction ■ Environment: A small group of conservative scientists tell the President there is no problem; a substantial body of scientific testimony argues otherwise. >Y Donell* H. Meadows PLAINFIELD. Nil W h at's happening to the Earth* climate is not certain. What * happening to U.S. policy on global climate change is becoming clear. Last week President Bush ducked yet another opportunity to exert even mini¬ ma! leadership on the issue. Hij speech Monday to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was a resolute call for more study. Last November the United States and Japan blocked an international agreement on climate change by refusing to discuss specific reduction of greenhouse gas pol¬ lutants by any target date. At that meeting, too. Bush's team supported only further study. That do-nothing stance is the result of a White House power struggle being won by conservatives led by Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. Sununu is greatly aided by a group of conservative scientists who have turned technical uncertainties about the greenhouse effect into pseudo-scien- Ufic politicking. They argue, to the dis¬ tress of many of their colleagues, that there may not be any global warming. The greenhouse skeptics, according to Science magazine, “number less than a dozen .... Most have not specialized in greenhouse research and have only re¬ cently entered the fray.\" But they are sought out and quoted liberally by anyone who wishes the greenhouse effect would go away—by Forbes magazine, for exam¬ ple. in a recent cover article titled “The Global Warming Panic: A Classic Case of Overreaction.\" Three skeptics—William A. Nieren- berg. director emeritus of Scripps Institu¬ tion of Oceanography; Robert Jastrow, former director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and Frederick Seitz, president emeritus of Rockefeller Uni¬ versity—have produced a 35-page report widely circulated in the White House. The report says, basically, that there is no evidence for global warming now, no certainty that there ever will be and even a possibility of cooling in the next centu¬ ry Thai’s half the argument that Sununu is putting into the President's mouth. The other half, advanced by conservative economists, is that anti-greenhouse mea¬ sures will be so expensive that only the greatest scientific certainly could justify them. And in the opposite comer we have James E. Hansen, current Go-ldard direc- The do-nothing stance results from a White House power struggle being won by conservatives led by Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. Donella H Meadows is on ad; ■■ met professor of environmental and policy studies at Dartmouth College. tor. who also produced scientific shock waves by testifying before Congress that, \"with 99% confidence,\" greenhouse warming is already here. We have Steve Schneider of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who puts the confidence level at 80%. and who has written a blistering critique of the Ni- erenberg Jastrow/Seitz report. We have Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, who calculates that the cost of reducing greenhouse gases through energy-efficiency measure* could be negative— saving so much money and reducing so many other kinds of pollutants that the measures could pay for themselves. And a distinguished array of the nation's ecologists—George Wood- well, Paul Ehrlich. E.O. Wilson and others—are convinced that greenhouse warming is one of the most serious threats to the Earth’s ecosystems. The primary action necessary to com¬ bat a greenhouse effect is to use fossil fuels much more efficiently. Whether there is a greenhouse effect or not, energy efficiency would improve the environment, the balance of payments and the general economy. But it would greatly inconvenience the oil. coal, elec¬ tricity and automobile industries, among others. Hence the eagerness in some political camps not to believe in the greenhouse effect, and to cite only the side of the argument that feeds such bias. Some scientists play directly into that political eagerness. Like the rest of us. they have genes, glands, emotions, val¬ ues, whatever predisposes people to pre¬ fer nature to oil companies or vice versa. Many of the protagonists in the green¬ house debate have been combating one another for decades Whether the issue is nuclear energy or nuclear winter, popu¬ lation policy or global warming, they are arrayed predictably, some advocating so¬ cial reform, others defending the current order. The last time Nierenberg, Jastrow and Seitz made a public statement, it was to promote the Strategic Defense Initia¬ tive. Schneider, Ehrlich, and Lovins have never taken anything but a dim view of the environmental effects of untram¬ meled industrial society. That does not make them wrong or manipulative or insincere, it makes them human. Their fault comes only when they pass off their values as science Suppose (a large supposition Indeed) we nad an administration or citizenry that wanted to sort out whatever truth there is in the scientific brouhaha, and choose the wisest course of a ion for the whole society. Would that be possible ? jjlEUki XiUNlAiVulNOAi. J ANu/m-' i jp, Marijuana backers urge production of dioxin-free paper made from hemp By BILL Q RAVES and OAVIO HOGAN of Tho Orotonltn tuft If government win not let Ameri¬ cans grow marijuana to smoke, It should at least let them cultivate it commercially for products such as dtoxin-ftee white paper, speakers at a marijuana activists conference said Saturday. Most in the group of about 30 attending the Marijuana Activists Regional Conference at Lewis and Clark College wish the government would allow both uses. But one pan¬ el on the second day of the three-day conference focused on various com¬ mercial uses of marijuana, also known as hemp. Hemp can he used to produce (Pel, Mnenlike fiber for fabric and pulp for various grades of paper, the spea ker ; said.^tost QSMin OmnnrTnmTronrninp, and it lasts four to five times longer than paper made from wood, said Paul Stanford of Portland, who im¬ ports Chinese hemp products. Further, cellulose-rich hemp can be made into white paper using hydrogen peroxide rather than the chlorine-bleaching process used by U.S. pulp mills, said Jim Evans, 35, an Ashland education student who hopes to plant commercial hemp crops in the Willamette Valley this spring. The chlorine procedure leaves traces of dioxin tn white paper prod¬ ucts and In waste discharges. The Oregon Department of Environmen¬ tal Quality has proposed forcing three Oregon pulp mills to cut their dioxin emissions. Jack Herer of Los Angeles, head of a political action group seeking to make marijuana legal, said the mills can eliminate dioxin and save for¬ ests by switching to hemp “You can make every grade of paper from toilet paper to newspa¬ pers at one-fourth the cost,” said, Herer, wearing a broWn hemp shirt and holding a book about hemp made of hemp. Mary O’Brien, a Eugene scientist fur the Northwest Coalition for Al¬ ternatives to Pestlctdea, said hemp is worth considering as a paper source, particularly if there are species free of the substance that makes people high. “The question of hemp as paper just adds to this interesting ferment of ideas as to multiple ways to make papers for multiple purposes,\" O’Brien said. Chris Conrad of Los Angeles, director of the Business Alliance for Commercial Hemp, said he expects to see hemp legalized for commer¬ cial use within five years. Evans thinks he has found a legal path through the Internal Revenue Serv¬ ice that will allow him to grow hemp commercially this year. The discussion among marijuana activists came against the backdrop of a report Thursday tn Portland by Doug McVay, projects director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. McVay predicted illegal marijuana produc¬ tion will continue to increase in the United States In the 1990c, with Ore¬ gon remaining one of the top grow¬ ers. He said Oregon's marijuana crop led all states in 1937 and 1988. based on reports from growers, govern¬ ment agencies and the media. No es¬ timates Were available for last year. Estimates of Oregon's marijuana crop range from 1600 million to $1 billion annually, placing Oregon among the three leading states for marijuana growing. U.S. Attorney Charles H. Turner and Multnomah County District Attorney Michael Schrunk said In a report last year. McVay claimed the Oregon crop Is worth as much as |1.5 billion a year, not counting plants seized by police.

It would The way to separate values from science is to do what Sununu is not doing—listen openly and critically to all sides. Listen for agreement (scientific certainty, as fur as it goes) and disagree¬ ment (scientific uncertainty, all mixed up with values). In the case of giobal warming, there is absolute agreement that human activities are rapidly Increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere There is near-agree¬ ment that more greenhouse gases mean a climate wanner than it would otherwise be There is no agreement about what it would otherwise be. Other forces besides greenhouse gases—such as the sun’* energy and wobbles in the Earth s orbit— also affect the climate. Those other forces could be moving in a warming direction just now, or they could be about to plunge us into an ice age. That we don’t know. We also don't know what feedbacks warming might set off. A hotter Earth would evaporate more water, which could make more clouds, which could cool the Eanh again. Or a hotter Earth could release methane locked in frozen tun¬ dra-methane is a greenhouse gas; that would make the Earth still hotter. The computerized climate models, from which most greenhouse fore:asts derive, include few of these feedback-, which could bring on the greenhouse effect much faster than we expect, or much slower. In short, we know we are doing some¬ thing that, all else equal, will lead to warming Whether all else will be equal, how fast a climate change could happen. what it would mean for rainfall and sea levels, droughts and hurricanes, ecosys¬ tems and human settlements, all that we don't know. Therefore we know almost nothing about costs. I have yet to see a cost estimate on thi matter done honestly— which is to say, done by comparing what greenhouse gas reductions would cost versus what it would cost to endure a global warming The job is virtually impossible But I believe that every anti-greenhouse policy—energy efficien¬ cy. solar energy, forest preservation and reforestation, chlorofluorocarbon reduc¬ tion, population control—is worth pursu¬ ing in its own right, even if there is no greenhouse effect. So here we are, causing large changes in our atmosphere and highly uncertain about the consequences. The dynamics of the planet are such that if we wait for certainty, it will be too late to do anything—If anything ought to be done. Our choice boils down to a judgment about the value of the current society, whose blessings and faults we know, versus an attainable alternative society that could be better, or worse, or better for some and wor.^e for others. Who gets to define better and worse? Where should the burden of our uncer¬ tainty be placed? On a few sectors of the human economy, on the Earth's eco¬ systems or to some extent on both?

When the energy crop is growing it takes in CO 2 from the air, so when it is burned the CO 2 is re¬ leased, creating a balanced system. Biomass is the term used to describe all biologically produced matter. World production of biomass is estimated at 146 billion metric tons a year, mostly wild plant growth. Some farm crops and trees can produce up to 20 metric tons per acre of biomass a year. Types of algae and grasses may produce 50 metric tons per year. This biomass has a heating value of 5000-8000 BTU/lb, with virtually no ash or sulfur produced during combus¬ tion. About 6% of contiguous United States land area put into cultivation for biomass could supply all current de¬ mands for oil and gas. The foundation upon which this will be achieved is the emerging concept of “energy farming,” wherein farmers grow and harvest crops for biomass conversion to fuels. Pyrolysis is the technique of apply¬ ing high heat to organic matter (ligno- cellulosic materials) in the absence of air or in reduced air. The process can produce charcoal, condensable organic liquids (pyrolitic fuel oil), non-con¬ densable gasses, acetic acid, acetone, and methanol. The process can be ad¬ justed to favor charcoal, pyrolytic oil, gas, or methanol production with a 95.5% fuel-to-feed efficiency. Pyrolysis has been used since the dawn of civilization. Ancient Egypt¬ ians practiced wood distillation by col¬ lecting the tars and pyroligneous acid for use in their embalming industry. Methanol-powered automobiles and reduced emissions from coal-fired power plants can be accomplished by biomass conversion to fuel utilizing pyrolysis technology, and at the same time save the American family farm while turning the American heartland into a prosperous source of clean ener¬ gy production. Pyrolysis has the advantage of using the same technology now used to pro¬ cess crude fossil fuel oil and coal. Coal and oil conversion is more efficient in terms of fuel-to-feed ratio, but biomass conversion by pyrolysis has many en¬ vironmental and economic advantages over coal and oil. Pyrolysis facilities will run three shifts a day. Some 68% of the energy of the raw biomass will be contained in the charcoal and fuel oils made at the facility. This charcoal has nearly the same heating value in BTU as coal, with virtually no sulfur. Pyrolytic fuel oil has similar proper¬ ties to no. 2 and no. 6 fuel oil. The charcoal can be transported economi¬ cally by rail to all urban area power plants generating electricity. The fuel oil can be transported economically by trucking creating more jobs for Americans. When these plants use charcoal instead of coal, the problems of acid rain will begin to disappear. When this energy system is on line producing a steady supply of fuel for electrical power plants, it will be more feasible to build the complex gasifying systems to produce methanol from the cubed biomass, or make synthetic gasoline from the methanol by the ad¬ dition of the Mobil Co. process equip¬ ment to the gasifier. Farmers must be allowed to grow an energy crop capable of producing 10 tons per acre in 90-120 days. This crop must be woody in nature and high in lignocellulose. It must be able to grow in all climactic zones in America. And it should not compete with food crops for the most productive land, but be grown in rotation with food crops or on marginal land where food crop production isn't profitable. When farmers can make a profit growing energy, it will not take long to get 6% of continental American land mass into cultivation of biomass fuel —enough to replace our economy’s de¬ pendence on fossil fuels. We will no longer be increasing the CO 2 burden in the atmosphere. The threat of global greenhouse warming and adverse cli¬ mactic change will diminish. To keep costs down, pyrolysis reac¬ tors need to be located within a 50 mile radius of the energy farms. This necessity will bring life back to our small towns by providing jobs locally. Hemp is the number one biomass producer on planet earth: 10 tons per acre in approximately four months. It is a woody plant containing 77% cellu¬ lose. Wood produces 60% cellulose. This energy crop can be harvested with equipment readily available. It can be \"cubed\" by modifying hay cub¬ ing equipment. This method condenses the bulk, reducing trucking costs from the field to the pyrolysis reactor. And the biomass cubes are ready for con¬ version with no further treatment. Hemp is drought resistant, making it an ideal crop in the dry western re¬ gions of the country. Hemp is the only biomass resource capable of making America energy independent. And our government outlawed it in 1938. Remember, in 10 years, by the year 2000, America will have exhausted 80% of her petroleum reserves. Will we then go to war with the Arabs for the privilege of driving our cars; will we stripmine our land for coal, and poison our air so we can drive our au¬ tos an extra 100 years; will we raze our forests for our energy needs? During World War n, our supply of hemp was cut off by the Japanese. The federal government responded to the emergency by suspending marijuana prohibition. Patriotic American farm¬ ers were encouraged to apply for a li¬ cense to cultivate hemp and responded enthusiastically. Hundreds of thou¬ sands of acres of hemp were grown. The argument against hemp produc¬ tion does not hold up to scrutiny: hemp grown for biomass makes very poor grade marijuana. The 20 to 40 million Americans who smoke marijuana would loath to smoke hemp grown for biomass, so a farmer's hemp biomass crop is worthless as marijuana. It is time the government once again respond to our economic emergency as they did in WWII to permit our farm¬ ers to grow American hemp so this mighty nation can once again become energy independent and smog free.

It is suggested that raw material consumption could be reduced by: in¬ creased recycling of waste paper; greater use of semi-chemical, chemi-mechanical and thermo-mechanical pulps; and more use of fibers such as straw, hemp, waste wood, young and unbarked wood VARIATION IN THE CONTENT OF CELLULOSE DUR¬ ING THE VEGETATIVE PERIOD OF HEMP R.

Pressed sheets from papyrus were made in Egypt as early as 500 B. C. Paper making techniques related to present processes were based primarily on annual fibers such as cot¬ ton, flax, and hemp. Cellulose is commercially available from annual fiber crops, by-products, residues. Typical crops are cotton, reeds, esparto grass, jute, hemp, and kenaf; they may be cultivated or of natural growth. By-products include cere¬ al straws, bagasse, oilseed stalks, and similar cellulosic materials associated with principal agricultural wastes.

The hardwood species is shown to be well suited to NSCC and bisulphite pulping, giving pulps with breaking lengths of up to 9400 m. Refiner groundwood obtained form the species had a breaking length of 2200 m, a tear factor of 0.2, a burst factor fo 35.3, and a GE brightness of 70. Data from refiner groundwood and thermomechanical pulp production using the woody core of hemp indicate that this material should also be of commercial interest as a pa¬ permaking raw material. Breading length ran as high as 3620 m; GE brightness, as high as 64.5 (bleached thermomechanical pulp). DROUGHT HELPS HEMP The Official Record, USDA, December 25,1930, p. 3 This year’s drought has had a good effect on one crop at least. Hemp grown in Kentucky, Illinois, and Wisconsin, in fields that were well prepared and planted early, is giving a remarkable yield of fiber of exceptionally good quality, say the fiber plant spe¬ cialists of the department Some of Wisconsin’s 1930 crop show a yield of about 1,000 pounds of fiber an acre; the average yield in that State for the preced¬ ing 10 years was about 800 pounds an acre.

While few of them abandoned their advocacy of the drug as a recrea¬ tional substance, they raised another argument for making it legal — the marijuana plant's al¬ leged usefulness as a fiber and energy crop. Drawing on the research of author Jack Herer, they claimed that the hemp plant — the source of marijuana — could be no less than an ecological panacea. Planted in bulk, they contended, the sturdy, fast-growing hemp plant could provide a better source of clothing and paper fiber than cotton, as well as plentiful bio¬ mass (a fancy name for \"organic stuff\"! and a potential source of chemicals, proteins and cheap, clean fuel. In the vision of those who called for widespread hemp cultivation, running the country on renewable hemp-derived fuel would go a long way toward eliminating the dan¬ gerous pollution associated with burning petroleum. Some continue to question the motives of those who present hemp as an avenue toward environ¬ mental sanity. An Ohio University botany professor, however, said Monday that for the most part, the claims being made on hemp s behalf are probably not overblown. \"It's a big crop In some parts of the world,\" confirmed Professor Jim Cavender. They used to use it for rope and clothing. Hemp was your predominant fiber In some parts of the world ... it's a very useful plant.\" In hl9. writings and speeches. Herer has maintained that hemp is far and aw^y the best plant choice for producing biomass, as it grows faster and bigger than most plants, and does well In a variety of conditions. \"He could be right there.\" musec Cavender. \"I haven't seen any data.\" The botanist did confirm, though, that hemp \"produces a lot of mass In one growing season — it produces a lot of bulk.\" and added, \"at this latitude there probably wouldn't be anything to compete with It ... It's a pretty vigorous plant. It grows like a weed. It doesn't have too many enemies.\" Herer has said also that Kemp is much preferable to cotton as a source of fiber for clothing, being softer and stronger, and causing very little depletion of the soil in which It grows. \"It Is a good fiber.\" Cavender acknowledged. “I think it's a little rougher (than cotton)... Of course, cotton is the worst, as far as effect on the soil Is concerned. About one-half of the chemicals used ip| American agriculture are used oij cotton. Someday we may have to get away from cotton, and hemp might be an alternative.\" In what may Come as sad news to those at NORML, Cavender added that hemp grown for fiber and energy need not be worth much rolled in a Joint. Attaining a high concentration of the plant's active drug ingredient requires selective cultivation and specific growing procedures, he said. The stuff that grows wild in India is no good (as a drug),\" he noted. “And I think the stuff that used to grow wild here (in the United States) was no good ... It could be grown with a very low drug content, and 1 think that probably would be a very good idea, if this were permitted.\"' Athens Police Capt. Clyde Beasley suggested that the entire environmental angle on pot may be just one more facet of a public- refatlons push on the drug's be¬ half by dealers and users. \"Ifyou're a user, you're going to be for it. right?\" he asked. \"It's Just like politics — you hire people to be yoiir lobbyist... You kno* why NORML's doing what it's doing.\" Beasley said of legalization that he would \"hate to see It come about. What’s it going to do for society? ... You legalize It... you make It more readily accessible. Now there are some restraints.\" One argument made in sup¬ port of marijuana — especially in this area, known as a major culti¬ vation spot — is the amount of economic activity pot growing generates. (By some estimates, marijuana is the nation's number two cash crop; in places like Athens and Meigs counties, it may be number one.) Beasley, how¬ ever, contended that any local monetary benefit from pot is illu¬ sory. \"I've never seen any of that money stay in this area,\" he de¬ clared. \"It goes to people in the business. It goes out of here in grocery sacks or whatever. It doesn't help pump up the econ¬ omy put here.\" The Ohio University Ecology Club co-sponsored the \"Just Say Know\" conference with NORML. Ecology Club treasurer Craig Goldstein said Wednesday that his group does not support the use of hemp as a drug, but would like to see the plant utilized for its many useful properties. \"WeVe gone through some in¬ credible evidence\" regarding hemp’s potential as a fuel, Gold¬ stein said, adding that if the facts he has read are true, “I'm against anything that would prevent fur¬ ther research.\" According to the research, he added, hemp pro¬ ducts 40 times the biomass of other plants, such as com, that have been proposed as energy sources. By a process called py¬ rolysis, he explained, the plant is turned into methanol, which could be used to run engines — includ- ‘ng those in cars. Among other sources, Gold¬ stein cited a paper by Lynn 'Osburn, \"Energy Farming In America.\" In that paper, Osbum points out that \"hemp grown for biomass makes very poor grade marijuana. The 20 to 40 million Americans who smoke marijuana would be loath to smoke hemp grown for biomass.\" State Rep. Mary Abel, D- Athens, who attended a senate subcommittee hearing on drug legislation at which Herer pitched the hemp-for-energy idea, cau¬ tiously praised the \"diversity of opinion\" heard at the session. However, she added that she feels the dangers pf marijuana as a drug may outweigh any value it has environmentally. “People are concerned that drugs like marijuana really be¬ come a gateway drug.\" Abel said. \"We know we've got an abuse that is growing.

Congress announced Thursday that a first-ever conference of legislators from 33 nations will be convened in Washington next •pring to consider global warming and other environmental issues. While it will precede by six months an international meeting on global wanning to be hosted by President Bush, Senate sponsors of the April 29-May 2 meeting Said it is intended to spur international cooperation, not to upstage the President \"We believe the time for action is now,” said Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn ), chairman of the Senate delegation to the conference. “We are ready to move.\" Gore insisted that the conference was not an exercise in one-upman¬ ship. “This is in no way partisan.\" he said. \"We are not taking an adversarial position against the Administration.\" Others in the aeven-member Senate delegation said the meeting would give the United States a chance again to assume leadership on worldwide environmental issues that had been lost during the Reagan Administration.

IV90 LOS ANGELES TIMES Hot Air and the Greenhouse Effect Bush was right to ask Congress for one thing that is essential to answer questions like those, money. His new budget would increase this country’s Global Change research program by 60%, to more than $1 billion. Caution on the greenhouse also can cause little trouble as long as Bush does not slow down programs that could retard global warming be¬ cause they make sense on other grounds, such as making electrical generators and automobiles more efficient and saving tropical rain forests. But the President was on rather shaky ground when he talked of making absolutely certain that future efforts to deal with the greenhouse effect are consistent with sound principles of economics. Nearly a century ago, a British economist, A. C. Pigou. developed the now widely held theory that industries could not expect to pay hard cash for raw materials, land. labor and the rent of money and then use air and water as if they were free goods. Principles of economics don't get any more sound or venerable than that. It doesn't take a degree in meteorology to see that the White House is cooling off on global warming. The question is. Why? If this reflects only President Bush’s customary caution, there is no harm done. Even if it reflects skepticism about being able to come up soon with precise measurements of anything as vast as the planetary atmosphere, there is no real cause to strip Bush of his environmental epaulets. But if it represents a backing away from concern that man-made carbon dioxides are forming an envelope around the Earth that eventually will raise temperatures in strange places by trapping heat that now escapes into space, then the environmentalists are right to worry. Few scientists question the validity of the theory that various gases, most of them generated by burning fuels for energy, a 1 -- creating a monster greenhouse effect.

August 7: began to separate the male from the female hemp —rather too late. While it is unlikely that George Washington, who penned these diary notes 200 years ago, smoked any of the scraggly rope- dope he was growing on his Mount Vernon plantation, he cer¬ tainly dreamed of hemp as a cash crop. After all, it had a solid for¬ eign market and was perfect for cottage industry, baaketmaking and such. He won over Thomas Jefferson, who began importing hemp seeds to MonticeUo, but failed to win the support of early American farmers, who favored tobacco cultivation. If, by some historical quirk, they had instead followed Washington's advice, early U.S. history might have been considerably headier. As it turned out not until the 19th century did Americans — including presidents—really turn an. The patent-medicine boom in the mid1800s was largely responsible: Virtually everyone sampled various opium-, canna¬ bis- and cocaine-based remedies and elixirs. If the president had the flu, a stomach ache, piles or a hangover, the prescribed remedy was tincture of opium: laudanum. Also prescribed for all manner of \"female complaints,\" lau danum found its way into first ladies' medicine chests too. A century before Betty Ford got strung out on Valium and vodka, Mary Todd Lincoln was portrayed by presi¬ dential biographer William H. Herdon as a virtual patent- medicine junkie. On the whole, however, records of bummere an these 19th-century elixirs are far out¬ weighed by the good trips. Ulysses S. Grant burned out by years of boozing, was miraculously revi¬ talized near the end of his life by daily doses of Mariani tea, one of chemist Angelo Mariani's delight¬ ful cocaine-based products. It so bolstered the aging ex-president that he was able to put in hours of work a day on his memoirs, valued as one of the finest ac¬ counts of the Civil War. During the 1880s, coca wine, another Mariani tonic, enjoyed unsurpassed popularity on the patent-medicine market The en¬ terprising Mariani eventually rounded up glowing endorsements from the prince of Wales, the czar and czarina of Russia, the kings of Norway and Sweden, and Pope Leo Xm. In the United States, Pres. William McKinley's secre¬ tary noted that a case of Vin Ma- JFK's most effective space program was the one he conducted on himself. riani had received an enthusiastic reception from the president All this came to an end—sort of —with the election of Theodore Roosevelt in 1901, under whose “progressive\" administration the first federal controls on what peo¬ ple drank, swallowed and smoked were instituted and the stage was set for Prohibition. Still, the rough-riding, trust-busting Teddy may not have been the straight ar¬ row he claimed to be. One day in 1912, according to the account of one Harford Cowling, a 91-year- old retired newsreel cameraman, the retired president halted a motorcade on its way to the Roosevelt Dam when he spotted a stand of \"cactus fruits” growing in the middle of the Arizona desert. According to Cowling, reporters watched bewildered as he rushed to the site and com¬ menced \"p ulling off the little green bulbs and eating them.\" Still by the time Teddy Roose¬ velt left office in 1909, the nation's first antidrug campaign was real¬ ly rolling. First came the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, prohibiting over-the-counter sales of opiates and cocaine. However high-mind¬ ed their pitch to save children from Mother Baily's Soothing Syrup and other kiddie narcotics, and to regulate the quality of med¬ icine, some of the prohibitionists concealed darker motives. This countryT b first official drug policy was instituted against a back¬ ground of Hearst-syndicate “yel¬ low peril\" journalism, portraying Chinese as shifty, no-good dope fiends. The hidden objective waB racial and financial: to halt the flood of Chinese immigrants into the U.S. labor pool. Racism also underscored cocaine prohibition, as characterized by Dr. Christo¬ pher Koch's statement before Congress in 1910 that “moat at¬ tacks upon white women in the South are the direct result of a cocaine-crazed Negro brain.” Hysteria and hypocrisy have all too often characterized drug policy since then. The Volstead Act (passed 1919, repealed 1933) banned alcohol, but didn’t pre¬ vent Pres. Warren Harding from hosting regular booze parties. And 50 years later, Richard Nix¬ on launched his \"war on drugs” while the CIA was actually run¬ ning shotgun for opium traders in Southeast Asia to prevent the well-armed opium dealers from supporting the Communists. There was a reassuring note of cosmic justice as the curtain fell on Tricky Dick, stoned on downs, talking to the presidential por¬ traits in the White House. Even his spiritual adviser, Billy Graham, had to lament that it was “sleeping pills and demons” that caused Nixon's decline and fall in 1974 (see High Times, “The High ft Mighty,” August ’79). Among other recent presi¬ dents, chemical preferences have been varied. According to Wil¬ liam Burroughs, Dwight Eisen¬ hower swore by the rejuvenative qualities of placenta serum, a compound rich in endorphins (natural body opiates) derived from the placentas of Bheep. John Kennedy's favorite tonics are by now widely documented. He received regular injections of megavitamins and amphetamines from Dr. Max Jacobson (“Dr. Jake\"), who has since—many ex¬ patients feel, unfairly—been barred from practice.

The smugglers were tried by to other accounts, JFK was also fond of the procaine-novocains derivative \"gerovital” (CHj), which advocates tout as a dandy antidepressant libido stimulator and longevity drug. (The Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve it for general use.) And in 1962, according to Judith Exner's account he became the first pres¬ ident to smoke dope in the White House. No less enlightened was broth¬ er Bobby. Psychedelic pioneer Dr. John Beresford (writing in the in¬ troduction to Peter Stafford's Psy¬ chedelic Encyclopedia) notes that in the spring of 1963, Bobby was known to be taking LSD or psilo¬ cybin and providing psychedelic entertainment for foreign digni¬ taries. This at a time when the CIA was organizing its own secret acid tests. Once upon a time none of this would have been considered at all shocking. Among primitive peoples, the heads—sbamanic healers and prophets—have always been among the most highly regarded tribal members. The pharaohs revered opium so much they took jarfuls of it with them on their journeys to the land of the dead. Not only were the leaders in ancient Greece famil¬ iar with the many healing and mind-expanding properties of drugs, their gods and goddesses turned an too: According to Greek myth, Demeter was the first opium eater. And in the 11th cen¬ tury, Hasan-i-Sabah, the Old Man of the Mountain, rose to lead the Moslem faithful against the Cru¬ saders. According to legend, his fabled Assassins (Hashashans) topped off their battle-weary days by smoking hashish in lovely pleasure gardens. So why not presidents? The point is simply this: While attitudes regarding specific highs may change, the turn-on goes on, right cm up to the top. —Jeff Goldberg Islamic revolutionary courts, which are charged with carrying out the anti-drug campaign, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said. It is believed that about 950 convicted smugglers have been executed under the new laws. IRNA said 10 traffickers, includ¬ ing a woman, were hanged Satur¬ day in Tehran’s Qasr prison.

It said that 426 of every 100,000 US residents are incarcerated, at an annual cost of $16 billion. For black American men, the rate is 3.109 per 100,000. South Africa has the world’s second-highest imprisonment rate, with 333 people imprisoned per 100,000 residents, the report said. Its incarceration rate for black males is 729 per 100,000. The Soviet Union ranks third in overall incarceration with 268 per 100,000 residents. incarceration rates in Europe generally range from 35 to 120 per 100,000 residents and in Asian coun¬ tries from 21 to 140 per 100,000, the report said. Marc Mauer, assistant director of The Sentencing Project, who wrote the report, said it shows that \"the same policies that have helped make us a world leader in incarcer¬ ation have clearly failed to make us a safer nation.” \"We need a fundamental change of direction, towards proven pro¬ grams and policies that work to reduce both imprisonment and crime,” Mauer said. Commenting on the report, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. and chair¬ man of the House Government Op¬ erations Committee, said: \"We've got to stop jailing and start rehabilitating. ... We can build all the jails we think we need and slam the doors down on thousands of people, but it won’t make a bit of difference until we address the fun¬ damental causes of crime.” The U.S. incarceration rate jumped ahead of South Africa’s and the Soviet Union’s over the last decade as states and the federal government adopted mandatory minimum sentences, tightened pa¬ role eligibility criteria and other¬ wise relied more on imprisonment and less on alternatives, the report said. • 426 of every 100,000 U S residents are incar¬ cerated • 333 South Africans are imprisoned per 100,000 residents. • 268 per 100,000 Sovi¬ et Union residents are in¬ carcerated. It acknowledged that the U.S. crime rate is higher than in many countries. The nation’s murder rate is at least seven times higher than in most European countries. There were six times as many robberies and three times as many rapes in the United States as in West Germa¬ ny prior to unification with East Germany. The report noted that the overall U.S. crime rate has fallen 3.5 per¬ cent since 1980, while the nation’s prison population doubled. Forty-six states now have laws requiring prison time for some of¬ fenses. The U.S. Sentencing Com¬ mission says new sentencing guidelines and tougher penalties for drug-law violations may result in a 119 percent increase in the federal prison population from 1987 to 1997, the report said. Research b» P A FuzsvPORTLAND FREE PRESS The proportion of criminals sen¬ tenced to prison jumped 54 percent from 1980 to 1987, the report said. In 1980, the rate was 196 offenders imprisoned for every 1,000 arrests for serious crimes. The 1987 rate was 301 per 100,000. Drug-related crime is the biggest cause of the prison population explo¬ sion and helps explain the dispro¬ portionately high rate of black male incarceration, the report said. Thirty-eight percent of the people arrested on drug charges in 1988 were black, up from 30 percent in 1984. In Michigan, drug arrests have doubled since 1985 while drug-relat¬ ed arrests of blacks have tripled. \"With the war on drugs primari¬ ly waged through the criminal jus¬ tice system and disproportionately targeting inner-city drug users, the end result is an increasing number of prisoners and an even larger share of black male inmates,” the report said. Alternative punishments are less costly than imprisonment, the re¬ port said. A 1989 Delaware study found that the annual cost of impris¬ oning a criminal was $17,761, while putting the person on probation cost only $569 a year. For every drug offender sen¬ tenced to prison, three could be treated in an inpatient program and 16 could be treated as outpatients, the study said.

It dulls pain, inhibits movements, lowers body temperature, fools time. It sets memory chasing its own tail and turns thought and perceptual processes awry Why? For decades there were as many theories of how people got high on pot as there were researchers interested in testing the 421 compounds found in marijuana's serrated green leaves. Some scientists thought the weed's active compounds just dissolved into the membranes surrounding brain cells. Others believed the compounds worked through receptors, specialized areas on the membranes that fit lock-and-key style with specific molecules. One prominent neurochemist confessed to three notebooks of experiments that had failed to find a neuronal lock for a Cannabis sativa key. No one was able to figure out exactly how marijuana really did work until last year. In the fall of 1988 pharmacology professor Allyn Howlett and her group at St. Louis University Medical School announced that they had found the receptor for a major cannabinoid molecule. The story of Howlett's discovery began in the Sixties, when Rafael Mechoulam of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem determined that the main psychoactive compound in extracts of marijuana was a substance called delta- 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Although not especially potent, THC represented a new class of compounds structurally different from those found in other psychoactive drugs. Drug companies were intrigued. \"If you look in an old pharmacology text from, say, the Twenties, before the Reefer Madness business,\" Howlett explains, \"extracts of cannabis were about the only compounds that could be used for pain relief and anxiety.\" Subsequently pharmacologists began synthesizing THC analogs called cannabinoids, which were chemicals structurally and biologically similar to the naturally occurring chemicals but more powerful. In the mid-Seventies Ross Johnson and Larry Melvin worked with synthetic cannabinoids at Pfizer, a Connecticut- based pharmaceutical company. They were trying to develop a THC-like analgesic. The problem, Melvin explains, was that they couldn't detach the painkilling from pot's psychoactive properties. They developed several compounds 100 times more potent than THC, but the animal (and, in one case, human) subjects were zonked. This meant the drugs could be used only in hospitals, where opiates had already cornered the painkiller market. In the early Eighties Pfizer stopped the research project. The academic community took over and began studying the Pfizer cannabinoids. When a compound locks into its receptor on a cell membrane, it changes the activity of structures in the membrane, which in turn alters the way the cell processes information. Howlett wanted to see if the Pfizer cannabinoids worked the way some other analgesics do: by affecting a molecule called cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is a \"second messenger\": It regulates the way the inside of the cell responds to messages received at the membrane. Howlett found that the Pfizer cannabi¬ noids—especially the potent Levonan- tradol—affected cAMP production in cultured mouse neurons by inhibiting a key enzyme. The more effectively the compound inhibited cAMP in the test tube, the more effectively it killed pain in animals. Howlett’s next step was to see if the cannabinoids actually attached to neuronal membranes. She labeled the compounds radioactively, and by tracking the radioactivity, she was able to show that the cannabinoid molecules bound tightly to the membranes. \"The compounds that bound most strongly were the ones most active at the cellular level, and in the animals. And that,\" she says, \"is what really defines a receptor.\" She also found—potheads might be interested to know—that the cannabinoids did not hurt the cells. After exposure for several hours, however, the cells no longer re¬ sponded to the drug. That suggests, de¬ spite what ganja smokers might say, that it takes increasingly large doses to get the same buzz. Billy Martin, a cannabinoid researcher at the Medical College of Virginia, tested the Pfizer cannabinoids on a variety of animals to see if alterations in cAMP pro¬ duction were related to painkilling power alone or to the panoply of behavioral ef¬ fects that make up a THC high. \"It looks as though the structure of the com¬ pounds might be correlated with other behavioral effects besides analgesia,\" Martin says carefully. In the words of an¬ other researcher, “Probably we've seen people at parties who were like these an¬ imals: out to lunch.\" If the investigators could prevent THC effects by stopping up the cell receptor sites, they would be able to prove con¬ clusively that the binding of cannabi¬ noids to cell membranes cayses the high. \"We need an antagonist.\" Martin ex¬ plains. (An antagonist is a chemical key that fits into the same receptor lock as the drug but will not trigger the same re¬ sponse—in this case, getting stoned.) Antagonists could provide a power tool for drug research: By selectively block¬ ing some, but not all, cannabinoid ef¬ fects, they could help scientists tease apart THC's complex activities. Antagonists and analogs might also have therapeutic value. Scientists might discover more refined versions of the cannabinoid compounds now being used to treat glaucoma and decrease nausea during chemotherapy. The compounds could be used for brain research as well. “It has been noted in people who use marijuana that they can’t remember later things they learned while high,\" says Howlett. “You see something similar in the dementia of aging or the first stages of Alzheimer's.\" THC analogs, she specu¬ lates, might be used as a model for studying what happens in Alzheimer’s. And an antagonist might help treat the disease. \"We also could learn more about pain mechanisms and pathways,\" she continues. “This receptor suggests that opioids are not the only drugs involved in the regulation and processing of the pain response in the central nervous system.” Miles Herkenham of the National Insti¬ tute of Mental Health has used autora¬ diography—a technique allowing pre¬ cise location of binding sites—to map the distribution of the Pfizer analogs in the brain. Noting the arrangement of binding sites in areas associated with movement, he wonders if THC analogs and antago¬ nists can relieve symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea. If THC analogs or antagonists prove to have therapeutic properties, it will be be¬ cause they mimic or block the action of natural endogenous substances that use these pathways. Howlett's next project is to look for the brain chemical that nor¬ mally binds to the cannabinoid receptor. She has ruled out all known neurotrans¬ mitters. Scientists presume these recep¬ tors did not evolve so that animals could get stoned. \"There must be some kind of neuronal pathway in the brain that devel¬ oped whether there were cannabis plants or not,\" she says \"We looked at hormones, steroids, glu¬ cocorticoids, peptides, and found noth¬ ing else that would bind to the site,\" notes Howlett, who found the same response in chickens, turtles, frogs, and trout. “Cannabinoid binding sites in their brains CONTINUED ON PAGE 64 — 144 —"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"aninjD CONTINUED FROM PAGE 10 were nearly as dense as in later-evolved mammals. We even found some in fruit flies.\" In rats Howlett found the highest density of cannabinoid receptors in the cortex and hippocampus (areas of the brain associated with memory, percep¬ tion, and cognition) and in the cerebel¬ lum and striatum (both areas associated with movement). Miles Herkenham found that the pat¬ tern of distribution Howlett saw in rats also characterized the human brain. The re¬ ceptor sites were densest in the hippo¬ campus, cerebral cortex, and areas of the cerebellum. \"What really struck me,\" he says, “was the front-brain loading It's sort of a high-brow receptor.\" Herkenham was also impressed by the sheer quantity of receptors. \"The binding sites are incred¬ ibly numerous compared with other neu¬ rotransmitter systems,” he says, \"which suggests they are receptors for an im¬ portant, ubiquitous transmitter.\" Unraveling the mystery of this ubiqui¬ tous pot transmitter will help us under¬ stand how humans and other vertebrates manage the extraordinary juggling act of living. The chemistry of reefer madness will give us another way to look inside the hungry, horny, drowsy, excitable, glad, anxious, musing, giggly, cogitating, per¬ fectly sober brain.OO Teens can use yet not abuse drugs — maybe osa to-is-*e> * Pro-pot police teacher o GAINESVILLE, Fla. <AP) — The head of a police academy In North ' Florida says he smokes marijuana and would like it legalized for home use. Eut he admitE. his stand may cost him his job. \"It’s just a pleasurable experience that I and everybody else ought to ,be able to enjoy if they want to,\" said Bob Phillips, coordinator of . Sante Fe Community College's Po¬ lice Academy. Phillips, 39, has participated in training many police officers in a 14-county area the past three years and has been in law enforcment for 15 y ears. _ __ , , ^ *T*ve never known a policeman «3e-\\ strayed by marijuana, but I've seen \\ a lot of them destroyed by alcohol* t ism,\" said Phillips, who called him- / self a reformed alcoholic. ym* 1 <** *&*&*****+ ■ * He said he uses pot like some peo¬ ple use cocktails to relax after work. \"I've enjoyed it and I've smoked it off and on for 2»/ a years,\" he said. Police Chief Nolen W. Freeman, informed of Phillips' statements, 6aid Phillips' position as top man at the academy should be reviewed. \"I feel if it is against the law and the man is going to teach people to enforce the law, he should abide by it himself,\" said Freeman. \"If he wants the law changed, he should work toward that, not violate it.\" Phillips said private use of mari¬ juana should be decriminalized but the drug should not be legalized to¬ tally. He suggested laws to permit personal production and consump¬ tion of marijuana patterned after laws which allow small amounts of beer and wine to be produced for personal use. Phillips said he expects some fric¬ tion because of his statements, but he said he will net resign his post. However, he added that he may he pressured out of the job. By Karen S. Peterson T opA f USA TODAY Teei. drug users aren't nec¬ essarily drug abusers, says the author of a controversial gov¬ ernment-sponsored study. And the best way to deal with Idds who use drugs may be to focus on those who gel In trouble at school or elsewhere — and leave the rest alone, says Harvey Joanning. asso¬ ciate professor of family thera¬ py at Texas Tech University at Lubbock. If left to their own devices, adolescents who use drug; re- creadonally and are still func¬ tional will tend to grow out of It,” says Joanning, who has worked with about 130 kids ages 8-20 under a four-year, 4500,000 grant from the Na¬ tional Institute on Drug Abuse. He presents his approach to drue and therapy Oct 23 at the four-day American Associ¬ ation for Marriage and Family Therapy In Orlando, Fla. He expects the hotly debated topic will “raise some eye¬ brows.\" Charles Schuster. NIDA di¬ rector, already is alarmed. \"It fe very risky to talk about _ drug use among adolescents as OK as long as It doesn't become abuse,” he warns. “The minute we adopt that attitude we ex¬ pose a number of kids to drug abuse ” Joanning disagrees. He says that many youngsters using druff like marijuana and beer are fully functional and shouldn't be labeled abusers \"We should not assume that any kid using drugs Is an abus¬ er and needs treatment,” be says. \"In many instances use does not equal abuse.\" Joanning’s research team of 11 has been working two years. Their focus: finding out why some kids can use some drugs safely and others get into trou¬ ble; and finding an effective way to help. The key, Joanning says, may be working with parent^ peers and the community — a kid's total environment. He says that approach fe ef¬ fective two-thirds of the time In helping a teen quit drug or move to “appropriate use.\" “We have learned the hard way that if you want to reach kids, you can’t say. 'We want you to stop using drugs,’ ” Joan¬ ning says. “They will tune you out You say, ‘We know you are going to keep using them. Let's talk about how.' * But says Schuster, “The sim¬ ple fact fe we can't predict now who fe going to go on to use drug In a destructive fashion and who will walk away un¬ scathed. \"Any kid who starts experi¬ menting with drug may be the one who finds the experience so compelling that his whole life will revolve around (ft). \"It is simply not normal for a 12-year-old to be smoking mar¬ ijuana,” Schuster adds. \"We can’t afford to condone it” The Washington Post H *1Q Marijuana Receptor Exists in Brain, Study Confirms Scientists Predict Discovery Will Lead to New Drugs That Mimic Medicinal Effects By William Booth W»*hn)gton Po*l Staff Writer Researchers have confirmed the existence of a receptor in the brain that serves as a target for marijua¬ na, a discovery that could lead to new drugs that mimic marijuana's medicinal powers while avoiding some of its mind-altering effects. The finding, reported today in the scientific journal Nature, im¬ plies that the body may produce a natural marijuana-like substance that acts on the brain. The exis¬ tence of these natural cannabinoids, as they would be called, is still un¬ certain, but researchers suspect they must exist because a receptor for them exists in the brain. The discovery is expected to spark a race to find the substances. The discovery should help re¬ searchers understand how marijua¬ na affects the brain. The research reported today by Lisa Matsuda and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health deals with the cloning of the marijuana receptor, which sits on the outside of brain cells and is shaped specifically to grab mole¬ cules of the active ingredient in marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocan- nabinol or THC, and produce a spe¬ cific reaction within the brain cell. Until now, the putative existence of a specific marijuana receptor was controversial and considered by many researchers to be un¬ proven. \"I'd say it’s one of the most im¬ portant discoveries in marijuana research,\" said Solomon Snyder of Johns Hopkins University, the neu¬ roscientist who almost two decades ago helped discover that the brain harbors receptors for opiates such as heroin and morphine, as well as — 145 natural brain opioids such as the endorphins, which produce the oft- touted “runner's high.\" Lewis Judd, director of the Na¬ tional Institute of Mental Health, where the research was accom¬ plished, said, “Now scientists may be able to develop drugs that pos¬ sess marijuana’s positive medicinal effects without its negative effects, such as an intoxicated feeling, dis¬ orientation, and impaired precep- tion and memory.” Marijuana is legendary among recreational users for its mood-al¬ tering effects, which can include feelings of calm and giddiness and can shift preceptions of time and space. But among physicians and researchers, marijuana is also known to prevent nausea, reduce blood pressure, stimulate appetite, kill pain and suppress convulsions. But efforts to create synthetic ver¬ sions of the drug have been frustra ted by a poor understanding of how marijuana works in the brain. Traditionally, the study of mar¬ ijuana has been limited to relatively few researchers. With the latest advance—finding and cloning the gene for the marijuana receptor— scientists say they now have a pow¬ erful tool for understanding how the drug operates in the brain and for designing more sophisticated ver¬ sions of therapy. “1 bet the field will explode,” Sny¬ der said. The work ends a long-running de¬ bate over marijuana’s method of action in the brain.

The findings by Berkeley psy¬ chologists Jonathan Shedler and Jack Block might fly in the face of the “Just Say No” anti-drug cam¬ paign, but their peers agreed Tues¬ day that casual drug experimentation often is part of having a healthy personality and doesn’t always lead to addiction. “This may be hard for some people to take, but the real issue is knowing when to put the brakes on,\" said Shirley Feldman, deputy director of the Stanford University’s Center for Study of Family, Chil¬ dren and Youth. “There’s a whole big world out there and, psychologi¬ cally speaking, experimentation is healthy in most youths.” Shedler, perhaps nervous about the study being misinterpreted, said his and Block s careful research that tracked 101 San Francisco youths from age 3 to age 18, doei-''t advocate illegal drug experimenta¬ tion. “These findings absolutely do not mean drug experimentation is something that is beneficial,” he said. “But it does mean that some limited drug experimentation may not be catastrophic. It could be a sign of trouble to come or simply a sign \"of normal adolescent explora¬ tion.” Brian Flay, director of drug pre¬ vention research in the public health department of the University of Illinois, said, “The ‘Just Say No’ campaign has always been off the mark.” “We can’t stop kids from trying everything,” Flay said. “The ‘Just Say No’ campaign is extremely simplistic. It should be, ‘leam how¬ to moderate your behavior, leam how to resist the pressure to go overboard.’ ” Psychologists, including Shedler, said a more effective anti-drug ef¬ fort would identify children who have traits that signal possible drug problems later in life, and Jthen counsel those “at risk” youths. Australians Want to Make Paper From Pot WILSON DA SUVA -;kjd Iney GROUP of Australian farmers and en¬ vironmentalists want to make paper without cutting down trees. Problem ^ is . they want to replace wood with mar¬ ijuana, a plant they say is superior to wood and more environmentally friendly. Researchers agree, but marijuana’s narcotic properties have authorities in Australia’s island state of Tasmania worried. I m sure we would become a very popular state if we started growing Indian hemp legally and on a large scale,” said lan Colvin of the iasmanian premier’s office. The consortium, Hemp for Paper, submitted a proposal to Tasmania’s government in early February to plant 37,000 acres of marijuana and produce 100,OOO tons a year of pulp for making paper. Hardwood is not needed for paper. Any fiber high enough in cellulose will do, and hemp is one of the best,” said Patsy Harmsen, a spokes¬ woman for the 12-member consortium. “It’s been used for paper for hundreds of years. Forestry companies are afraid of what this could do to them. It’s cheaper for them to cut dow n existing foresis for next to nothing than to grow their own fiber,” she said from Hobart. Tasmanian development authorities are studying the proposal. The slate is already home to the country’s only legal farms for opium pop¬ py, a plant grown for pharmaceutic j I uses in Tasmania but used elsewhere for the manufac¬ ture of heroin. An Australian authority on non-wood fibers for making paper, lan Wood of the Common¬ wealth Scientific and Industrial Research Orga¬ nization, says a lot of the world’s paper and rope was made from hemp until about J35o. Today 93 percent of the world's p.prr is made from wood, and only 29 percent ?.f il.e paper is recycled. Some 7 percent of paper*is made from bamboo, grasses, bagasse sugar resi¬ due and even wheat stalks left after harvesting. Some 226 million tons of wood were pulped lor paper in 1968, and at current rates oi demand growth, this will triple by 2020. Hemp paper has a liie-span of hundreds of • • * -- —— -r— w, uunui eua uj years, compared with only 25 lo 80 years for the many grades of wood paper.

Re¬ searcher Wood says hemp, when grown in tem¬ perate climates like that of Tasmania, would yield low amounts of the alkaloid resin that gives the plant its narcotic qualities. “You’d probably have to smoke 100 kilos (220 pounds! of it to get high, and you would probably just end up with a sore throat,\" Wood said from Brisbane, where he studies non wood production a the Commonwealth Research Organization’s division oi tropical crops. But grow hemp in a tropical climate. Wood says, and it becomes a potent narcotic. SUNDAY PUNCH/MARCH 24, 1991 MONDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1990 Drug Charges Now that we have captured Panamanian Gen.

New South Wales state Minerals and Energy Minister Neil Pickard told Parliament on Tuesday that he had asked the Electricity Commis¬ sion to examine the possibility of burning confiscated pot crops to generate electricity. \"Marijuana burns at extremely high temperatures and gives off considerable heat energy,\" he said. Pickard's comments were greeted with uproarious laughter, but he said it was a serious proposition. He said burning marijuana would be cheaper than coal and produce about as much energy. The Elec¬ tricity Commission would look into what modifications would be needed for power stations to handle marijuana as well as coal, Pickard said. ■ Sandoz Pharmaceuticals of East Hanover, NJ., which offers doctors $100 to use Sandimmune, !an immune-suppressing drug, to treat psoriasis, even though it was not FDA-approved for that ailment.

He was promoting street railways when, through the insistence of his cousin, Alfred I. du Pont, he headed the reorganized Du Pont business and engineered the moves by which the firm became the largest manufac¬ turer of explosives in the United States. He sold his interests in 1914. Appointed U.S. senator in 1921 to fill an unexpired term, he was elected in 1924 and resigned in 1928 because of ill htalth. DUPONT, borough, NE Pennsylvania, Luzerne County, on the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad, near the Susquehanna River about mid¬ way between Wilkes-Barre and Scranton in a coal mining region. The borouzh was founded in 1917 and named for the du Pont familv which operated a pow¬ der plant near by. Pop. (19301 4,10'’. DU PONT (E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS & CO., INC.). This company was founded in 1802 as a manufacturer of black powder by Eleuthere Irenee du Pont de Nemours, a student of Lavoisier. Thomas Jefferson urged the founding of the company on the young French refugee to provide the struggling new nation with powder for hunting, land clearance, min¬ ing, quarrying, and defense. It operated as a partner¬ ship until 1899 at which time it became a corporation. Until 1857, Du Pont made only black powder, when Lammot du Pont developed “soda powder,” with a sodium nitrate base, for blasting. In 1880 Du Pont began the manufacture of nitroglycerin and dynamite. Du Pont’s development of smokeless pow¬ der from cellulose launched the companv into re¬ search on other cellulose products. In 1904, Du Pont began producing special nitrocellulose for lacquers, belt cement, leather finishes, and the like. \"Artificial leather” was added in 1910. “pyroxylin\" or nitro¬ cellulose plastics in 1915. and ruhhcr-coated textiles in 1916. Next vear. Du Pont entered the acids, heavy chemicals, pigments, dry colors, mixed paints and lithopone fields, and became interested in dvestuffs to release America from dependence upon (tcrman sources for coal-tar products. In World War I , Du Pont turned out 40 per cent of the smokeless powder fired bv Allied guns, but at the end of that war terminated all its military explosives activities except for two small plants working for the government security program. The ammonia department’s fixation of atmospheric nitrogen helped relieve the nation of its dependence on Chile for nitrates for explosives and fertilizers, and developed processes for manufacturing methanol, glycol', urea, higher alcohols, and other chemicals. Du Pont spent 543,000,000 before receiving any profit on its coal tar developments, but out of them came such products as Cellophane (1920’s). Nylon (1930’s), Orlon (1940’s), and Dacron (1950’s). Ni¬ trocellulose lacquers and neoprene synthetic Rubber were Du Pont developments. Du Pont became a leader in such diverse industries as paints, rayon, plastics, ©lectrochemicals, photographic film, insec¬ ticides, and agricultural chemicals. Du Pont was entrusted with a principal role in the development of atomic energy, thus taking the com¬ pany into the field of nuclear physics. Du Pont de¬ signed, constructed, and operated the Hanford. Wash., Engineer Works, producing plutonium, the fissionable material of the “Nagasaki-type” Atomic Bomb. Work on this project, involving by far the biggest plant Du Pont ever built or operated, involved an expenditure of 5350,000,000 for which the company received a profit of only one dollar, and agreed to the return of all patent rights to the government. Construction of the plant was begun in June, 1943, and operation of the first of the three “piles” began in September, 1944. In 1950. when the government decided to build its first plant for the manufacture of materials to be used in the hydrogen bomb. Du Pont was again chosen to design, build, and operate the plant, on the Savannah River in South Carolina, at a fixed fee of one dollar. See Carothers, Wallace Hume; Nieuwland.

Two hundred years ago plant mat¬ ter, not fossil fuels, provided our tools, houses, clothing, fertilizers, paints, dyes, machines, and energy. While low prices and political machinations caused the demise of many plant-based products, some old techniques are resurfacing and new technologies—from soy ink to plastics made from sugar—are arising. Advocates say the future could bring far more advances, such as sugar cane paper, that could aid farmers here and abroad as well as lessening damage to the cm ironment. The simple fact is that anything made from a hydrocarbon can also be made from a carbohy¬ drate (not so difficult to under¬ stand since fossil fuels are, as their name connotes, the densely com¬ pacted remains of living matter), and at one time or another, it was. In the 1880s, the first plastics were made from the cellulosic fi¬ bers of cotton. Its name reflected its feedstock: celluloid. Twenty years later much stronger plastics were made from wood. Post- World War I car radios were made from this material, called bakelite. The first synthetic fiber was not nylon, but wood-derived rayon. The first film plastic is still famil¬ iar: cellophane. Hydrocarbons, first coal, then petroleum and natural gas. achieved supremacy over carbohy¬ drates because they were cheaper to produce, easier to transport, and more convenient to use. But one might argue that politics, not economics, was the deciding factor in the competition between plant matter and fossil fuels. As 1 have pointed out in the St. Paul Pioneer Press (Dec. 3, 1990). one of the ironies of materials history is that we turned a blind eye to the poi¬ sons generated by a hydrocarbon economy, while imposing consider¬ able obstacles on carbohydrates because they can give us physical pleasure. The tortuous path of fuel alco¬ hol illustrates the point. In 1860, ethanol (made from plants) was a widely used and economically competitive fuel for lighting and solvent for industrial uses. Two years later, as the first oil wells be¬ gan operating, the federal govern¬ ment imposed a stiff tax on liquor to pay for the Civil War. Ethanol, being liquor, suffered the tax, but its competitor kerosene (a by¬ product of petroleum) did not. The tax, not lifted until 1906, priced ethanol out of the emerging liquid fuel markets. A May 22, 1906, New York Times editorial insisted, “It is only the heavy tax imposed by the United States that has prevented the use of a large number of vegetable products for the manufacturing of an exceed¬ ingly cheap and available alco¬ hol.’’ In 1919, with ethanol again poised to compete with gasoline, Prohibition descended on the na¬ tion. (For more information see Forbidden Fuel: Power Alcohol in the 20th Century by Hal Bemton, William Kovarik, and Scott Sklar, Boyd-Griffin, New York, 1982.) Hemp, the world’s number-one crop in the 19th century, suffered the same kind of discrimination. Jack Herer provides the historical overview in his monumental book The Emperor Wears No Clothes (available from HEMP, 5632 Van Nuys Blvd., Suite 210, Van Nuys, CA 91401). For hundreds of years hemp oil was used to make paints, and -hemp fibers and “hurds” (a by product of this fiber-stripping process) were made into clothing, rope, and canvas (derived from the word cannabis). In 1914 the Department of Agriculture praised hemp as a possible source of pa¬ per. But hemp’s potential was lim¬ ited by the lack of a machine like the cotton gin to separate the fi¬ bers from the rest of the plant. Such a machine was invented in 1937, and in February 1938 Popu¬ lar Mechanics predicted a billion- dollar market for hemp. That same year prohibition was imposed on the hemp flower, marijuana. In the last 20 years we’ve taken off our blinders when it comes to the environmental costs of hydro¬ carbons. Acid rain, global warm¬ ing, air and water pollutants of all kinds result primarily from the use of fossil fuels. We’ve begun to real¬ ize the cost of this pollution, and the resulting rise in the price of hy¬ drocarbon-derived products and fuels, coupled with the increasing ability to improve biological pro¬ cessing technologies, gives new hope for a carbohydrate economy. Phasing out leaded gasoline opened up a market for octane¬ enhancing ethanol. Ethanol pro¬ duction increased 50-fold be¬ tween 1980 and 1991. Similarly, phasing out ozone-depleting chlo- rofluorocarbons (CFCs) created the opportunity for one small Florida firm to make a solvent for cleaning semiconductor boards out of citrus fruits; the citrus solvent is cheaper than CFC-based solvents. A federal threat to impose pollu¬ tion costs on petroleum-based printing inks galvanized the farm community to develop soybean- based inks that have already cap¬ tured one-third of the colored ink market among newspapers. Veg¬ etable paints are making a come¬ back. (For an analysis of commer¬ cial opportunities for using plant matter, done for the state of Ne¬ braska, see “Substituting Agricul¬ tural Materials for Petroleum- Based Industrial Products,” Institute for Local Self-Reliance, 1986.) And yes, plant-matter-based plastics are back. Popular Science (April 1990) reports that a number of companies are producing de¬ gradable plastics with 6 to 12 per¬ cent starch. The British chemical giant 1CJ makes a high-quality plastic that is produced by a bacte¬ ria that feeds on sugar. This plastic is now used in making bottles. Plant matter seems poised once again to wage a serious struggle for supremacy with hydrocarbons, and there is also competition among crops themselves. Since the 1850s we have been making paper primarily from slow-growing trees. Gar Smith in Earth Island Journal (Fall 1990) argues for treeless pa¬ per. Why make paper out of 100- ycar-old trees that grow at the rate of a ton per acre per year, he asks, when equivalent-quality paper can be made from annual crops like hemp or kenaf or sugar cane that grow to maturity in one season and produce three to five times more yield per acre than trees? A plant-mattcr-based economy might revive the hopes of Third World countries blessed with long growing seasons and abundant sunlight. The Biomass Users Net¬ work Newsletter (May/June f990) notes that a 25-acre sugar cane re¬ search project in Puerto Rico has achieved yields of more than 45 tons of dry matter per acre, five times more than fast-growing tree varieties in the United States. —David Morris — 151 —"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Seizure & Forfeiture Laws:--- \" Take Your Hands Off My Assets by Judy Osburn When the federal government seizes cars, boats, money, real estate and other personal property, the proceedings, are set into motion based on laws whose origins date back to me¬ dieval superstition. These “in rem” forfeitures are a civil suit against the property itself. The property is held guilty and condemned, as though it were a personality instead of being inanimate and insentient Through this legal ‘personification fiction,’ the property is the defendant—and the guilt or innocence of the owner is irrelevant. By ap¬ plying a civil label to forfeiture proceedings, the government sidesteps almost all the pro¬ tections offered by the Constitution to indi¬ viduals. There is no Sixth Amendment guarantee of the right to counsel. Twenty days after seizure, the property is automatically forfeit¬ ed, without review by a judge or jury—unless the owner has the resources available to inter¬ vene in the proceedings. Civil attorneys’ retainers are high, and those with knowledge in this area of law are few. Those who are able to halt the automatic non-judicial forfeiture process find them¬ selves in a “Through the Looking Glass” world of law, where the property is presumed guilty until proven innocent; the innocence of the owner (now claimant) is not a defense; heresay is admissible to prove the property “guilty,” but not admissible in its defense; and the government’s claim to the property “re¬ lates back” to the time of the illegal act, so that anyone with a subsequent interest in the property is subject to the government’s prior claim of forfeiture. This “relation-back doctrine” is used not only against unknowing purchasers and lien holders of the “tainted” property, but also against fees paid to defense counsel. Property is subject to forfeiture through its “intended use” to facilitate a drug offense, extending the law from the regulation of action to the regu¬ lation of thought. Each violation of a constitutional right is then used as the basis for the destruction of another. The violation of the Fifth Amendment’s “Innocent until proven guilty” due process standard is used to destroy the prohibition of double jeopardy. Even an acquittal of related criminal charges does not bar re-litigation of the same facts, because the defendant must furnish the proof at the second trial. Because the Supreme Court holds that the Constitution permits in rem forfeiture of prop¬ erty belonging to a person who is completely innocent of criminal activity and not negligent in his use of the property, lower courts reason that the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual of excessive punishment or fines could not apply to anybody guilty of even a minor drug offense. The right to a jury trial is automatically waived unless demand is made within the specified time. It the property was seized on navigable waters, there is no right to trial by jury. An incarcerated claimant does not necessar¬ ily have the right even to be present at the for¬ feiture proceeding. If the property is valued under $100,000 or is a conveyance accused of transporting contraband, the right to trial must be purchased through a ‘cost bond’ equal to 10% of the value of the property. The govern¬ ment retains custody of the property and is not responsible for its deterioration. Unlike civil suits between individuals, the government as plaintiff is immune from counter-suit. English common law of the middle ages provided for forfeiture of any object causing a man’s death. Known as a deodand, the object, such as a weapon or run-away ox cart, was personified and declared tainted or evil, and forfeited to the king. Forfeitures became the Crown’s principle means of tax enforcement Forfeiture of the estates of traitors and felons added substantially to the Crown’s domain. Forfeitures imposed by the English Crown led to the prohibition off bills of attainder (forfeiture consequent to conviction) in the first article of the American Constitution. The main body of the Constitution also for¬ bids forfeiture of estate for treason. The very first Congress passed the statute, still law to¬ day, stating that “No conviction or judgement shall work corruption of blood or any forfei¬ ture of estate.” However, early Americans did incorporate in rem procedures under Admiralty and Maritime law, to seize enemy ships at sea and to enforce payment of customs duties. It was not until the outbreak of the Civil War that these customs procedures were radi¬ cally changed, in order to punish Confederate rebels. Opponents of the Confiscation Act of July 17, 1862 called the use of in rem proceedings “no more than ‘hocus pocus,’ designed to avoid the Constitutional requirements of a criminal trial,” and predicted that if it were passed, “a total revolution [will be] wrought in our criminal jurisprudence...despite all the safeguards of the Constitution.” The Act did pass, and was soon challenged. The Kentucky State Supreme Court held it unconstitutional, stating, “These [in rem] pro¬ ceedings may today be the engines of punish¬ ment to the rebels but, in the future, they may be the instruments of oppression, injustice and tyranny.” But the Supreme Court held that, if the Act was an exercise of the war powers of govern¬ ment and was only applied to enemies, then it was Constitutionally allowable, in order to en¬ sure a speedy termination of the war. Today, the passions of the “War on Drugs” have caused Congress to once again use in rem proceedings to inflict punishment without the nuisance of the protections provided by the Constitution and Bill of Rights. NATION Bush Rejects Shultz Drug Plan WASHINGTON—President Bush’s spokesman rejected a suggestion.today by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz that drugs be legalized and jokingly said, “He’s been on the West Coast too long.” \"Clearly, we do not believe that drugs should be legalized,” said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. “The President feels very strongly that [legalization] is the wrong direction, the wrong time.” Shultz, in an Oct. 7 address at Stanford University Business School, where he is on the faculty, expressed fear that Bush’s war on drugs, like previous such offensives, may fail. Shultz said although he welcomes increased efforts, he believes that authorities must take the profit motive out of the multibillion - dollar drug trade. \"We need to at least consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs,” Shultz said, adding, “I find it very difficult to say that.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1989* Drug Legalization: Interest Rises in Prestigious Circles By STANLEY MEISLER TIMES STAFF WSITED WASHINGTON—Hours before the Stanford-Notre Dune football game OcL 7, a relaxed and candid George P. Shultz, wearing a Stan¬ ford-red polo shirt, outlined some of his philosophical ideas to a group of alumni of the Stanford Business School at Memorial Auditorium in Palo Alto. “Now that I am out of govern¬ ment 1 can say this,\" the former secretary of state began, speaking thoughtfully. Then, in a suggestion that would astound and infuriate former c oll e agues in the govern¬ ment, he told the alumni: \"We need St least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs.” “1 find It very difficult to say that.” Shultz said. \"Sometimes at a reception or a cocktail party 1 advance these views and people head for somebody else. They don't even want to talk to you.” He screwed up his face in mock imita¬ tion of the shock he has caused, drawing a roar of laughter from the alumni. But no one ever associated wild and wooly ideas with the cautious and conservative Shultz when he served more than six years as secretary of state in the Ronald Reagan Administration and two years as secretary of the Treasury in the Richard M. Nixon Adminis¬ tration. And Shultz’s current position on drugs does not put him in deepest left field. Interest is mounting in academic and scientific circles in the idea of legalizing drugs, and the number of those willing to be counted is increasing markedly Azide from Shultz, the list of Please sac DKUQ&, AJ8 George P.

To them, making drugs illegal merely fosters crime and violence while failing utterly to stop drug use, just as Prohibition of alcohol failed in the 1920s. Opposition Exists The Bush Administration, how¬ ever, regards the arguments for legalizing drugs as anathema. .\"There is even a question (among Administration officials] that the rfifiriifisinn in itself is a little riskv.” —Enforcing the drug laws suc¬ ceeds only in driving prices up and thus aggravating the violence bred by the heavy profits earned by dealers. \"If the marijuana, cocaine and heroin markets were legal, state and federal governments would collect billions of dollars annually in tax revenues,\" Nadelman said. \"Instead, they expend billions in what amounts to a subsidy of organized criminals.\" —The government has no moral right to treat drugs differently from alcohol and tobacco. “Enforcement of drug laws makes a mockery of an essential S rinciple of a free society, that lose who do no harm to others ahould not be harmed by others Ind particularly not by the state,\" giadelman wrote. \"Most of the 40 Miillion Americans who illegally ponsume drugs each year do no direct harm to anyone else; indeed, most do relatively little harm even to themselves.\" Glaucoma Victim Pushes Legal Use of Marijuana By BRIAN MURPHY, Associated Press HOLLYWOOD, Fla.-Elvy Mu- zikka begins most days as she ends them—smoking a legal joint and hoping others like her can some day do the same.

One quarter of 1 percent? By Michael Isikoff Wuhmftofl Post Staff Writer A Drug Enforcement Administration ad¬ ministrative law judge, calling marijuana “one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man,\" r ecommended yesterday that the drug be made legally available for some medical purposes, includ¬ ing treatment of cancer patients. If adopted, the opinion by Judge Francis L. Young would mean that doctors could prescribe marijuana—a fundamental change in the drug’s legal status that some special¬ ists said could aid tens of thousands of pa¬ tients suffering from nausea-inducing che¬ motherapy and muscle spasms of multiple sclerosis. The opinion is not likely to have any im¬ mediate effect because DEA Administrator John C. Lawn is considered almost certain to reject Young's conclusions. Neverthe¬ less, coming after a 16-year legal battle, the 69-page ruling marks the first time a gov¬ ernment official has accepted a medical role for the country’s mostly widely used illicit drug. “The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision,* Young wrote. ‘It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to contin¬ ue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of the ev¬ idence in this record.* The long-awaited ruling was immediately criticized by DEA lawyers and antidrug groups who said it would send a confusing message at a time the federal government is attempting to wage a war on drugs. DEA officials also said the ruling ran counter to the body of accepted medical opinion. “This totally ignores the bulk of the med¬ ical evidence,” said Stephen E. Stone, as¬ sociate counsel of DEA, which had fought -changing marijuana’s classification. “The judge seems to hang his hat on what he calls a ‘respectable minority of physicians.’ What percent are you talking about?

'“This is a significant break¬ through for persons afflicted with AIDS and for all those seeking legal, medically supervised access to prescripUon marijuana,\" said Robert Randall, president of the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeu¬ tics, the Washington-based group thiat disclosed the approval. FDA spokesmen said they did ndt know of the approval, but ofpctals at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, which must ship the marijuana to the patient's doctor, confirmed that the FDA had ap- From our point of view, marijuana has not been established as a safe and effective drug,* Stone added. Young’s ruling, which cites medical re¬ searchers from Harvard, New York Univer¬ sity and other leading medical schools, comes in the form of a recommendation to Lawn to change the status of marijuana un¬ der the| 1970 Controlled Substance Act. Ever siiice the act was passed, marijuana has been classified with heroin and LSD as a Schedule I controlled substance, which means it is an illegal drug with no known medical use. Young recommends that Lawn use dis¬ cretionary authority to make marijuana a Schedule II substance. This means it would become a drug—like morphine i and co¬ caine—that, while still unavailable to the general public, can be prescribed by doctors for limited purposes. ' A DEA spokesman said yesterday that Lawn would not comment on the ruling un¬ til he has a chance to review it. Even if he Rejects the recommendation, however, law¬ yers for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and other pro-marijuana groups said Young's ruling would provide a powerful evidence to overturn a rejection in federal court “This is the most significant victory that' one can imagine* said Robert C. Randall, president of the Alliance for Cannabis Ther¬ apeutics, a group that joined with NORML and the Drug Policy Foundation in petition¬ ing DEA (or the ruling. “For the first time in over half a century, the federal govern¬ ment is viewing marijuana in a rational con¬ text ... not just saying it’s something evil.* In his opinion, Young cited a number of medical experts and patients as a basis for his conclusion that marijuana’s medical use was “clear beyond any question.\" Their tes¬ timony showed that marijuana helped sup¬ press nausea and vomiting experienced by chemotherapy patients, was a “highly suc¬ cessful appetite stimulant’ and was wide¬ ly—if illicitly—used in some hospitals. “This successful use of marijuana has giv¬ en many cancer chemotherapy patients a much more positive outlook on their overall treatment,* Young wrote, adding that smoking marijuana was far more effective than taking pills with synthetic THC, the active ingredient in the drug. Young found similar benefits for using marijuana to control muscle spasms suf¬ fered by patients with multiple sclerosis, spasticity and hyperparathyroidism, a pain¬ ful horomonal disorder that causes bone spurs. But Young rejected permitting mar¬ ijuana for treatment of glaucoma, saying there is insufficient evidence that many physicians support such a move. At the core of Young’s ruling, however, was his conclusion that the dangers of mar¬ ijuana do not outweigh its medical benefits. While agreeing that marijuana “can be harmful\" and “abused,\" he noted there is still not a documented death caused by the drug. “In strict medical terms, marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume,” he wrote. 1 I 1 I I 1 I I 1 I j§ I 9 n 1 I 1 1 Lit | I I i i i I i 1 1 1 i I 1 i s I I 1 1 1 I 1 I I 1 1 I I — 153"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"CALIFORNIA JNITIATIVE Name, Summary & Analysis of the Measure: Hemp: Restoration & Regulation Restores the right to farm and use hemp as a natural resource for paper, textile, fabrication, construction, seed, fuel, seed oil and medical industries, etc., in competition with the petroleum, timber and other industries. Makes herbal hemp and medicinal extracts available to people with arthritis, asthma, cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, etc. Protects the privacy of home and family. Sets 21-year age limit on consumption of hemp intoxicants (called grass, reefer, marijuana, pot, etc.) and regulates them like the California wine industry. Restricts consumption in public and driving while intoxicated. Limits drug testing. Sets $10 fee for clearing out-of-date police records. Requires a one-year study to consider feasibility of settling grievances. Financial Impact Analysis: Tremendous benefit. Potentially up to $100 billion in new hemp industries brought into the state, along with thousands of jobs. Tens of billions of dollars in tax savings, which the legislative analyst predicts will be used to fight violent crime. Cost of study offset by savings and billions of dollars in new tax revenue paid into the state general fund, which is used to fund schools, public transit, trauma centers, etc. A more just, speedy and efficient legal system. Less prison crowding without more prison bonds. Environmental Impact Analysis: A drought resistant, environmentally friendly cash crop for California. Every 1,000 acres of hemp used for paper or construction saves 4,100 acres of trees from being cut. A cleaner source of fuel than petroleum, without oil spills or offshore drilling. Offers new biodegradable alternatives to plastic and synthetic fibers. Uses fewer chemical pesticides and fertilizers than crops like com, tobacco and cotton, so it reduces water pollution from contaminated runoff. Less dioxin, air pollution, acid rain, etc. * Notice: This is a full, accurate and honest description of the hemp initiative.

The trial of William Penn and William Mead resulted in one of the most important devel opments of the rofnmmM ‘If a juror accepts as the law that •which the judge states then that juror has accepted the exercise of absolute authority of a government employee and has surrendered a power and right that once was the citizen's safeguard of liberty.' — 1788 — (‘Elliots ‘Debates, 94, ‘Bancroft, flistory of the Constitution, 267.) common law jury. During the previous six years English juries often acquitted Quakers for violating Parliment’s command that all religious services conform to Anglican ritual. The King’s Bench frequently responded to ver¬ dicts for acquittal in such trials by fining jurors. When the common law juries refused to enforce the Crown’s religious intolerance, London soldiers locked and guarded the doors of the Quaker Church. Penn and Mead preached in the streets and were arrested when a large crowd came to listen. Rather than pay a fine they demanded a jury trial. Many historically significant trials were held at the Old Bailey in London. This is the only one that is commemorated by a memorial plaque on the present courthouse: Near this site William Penn and William Mead were tried in 1670 for preaching to an unlawful assembly in Gracechurch Street. This tablet commemorates the courage and endurance of the Jury, Thomas Vere, Edward Bushell and ten others, who refused to give a verdict against them although they were locked up without food for two nights and were fined for their final verdict of Not Guilty. The case of these jurymen was reviewed on a writ of Habeas Corpus and Chief Justice Vaughan deliv¬ ered the opinion of the court which established the Right of Juries to give their Verdict according to their conviction. September 5 th is National Jury Rights Day Celebrating the Acquittal of William Penn Sponsored by the Fully Informed Jury Association The Fully Informed Jury Association (FIJA) wants to require that courts resume the practice of informing jurors about their inherent right, power and responsibility to judge whether a law is unjust or unjustly applied in a particular case. Thus defendants’ motives would be admis¬ sible as evidence, and the jury’s authority to acquit or convict according to the dictates of conscience would be reaffirmed. “Jury nullification of the law” is a traditional right dating back to the Magna Carta and was intended by America’s founding fathers as the final test a law must pass before it gains the authority to punish violators. John Adams, our nation’s second president, in 1771 said of the jury, “it is not only his right, but his duty...to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment, and con¬ science, though in direct opposition to the direction of the court. (74, Yale Law Journal, 1964:73) The trial jury’s veto power continues to be recognized by the state Constitutions of Maryland and Indiana. And, “[the jury has an] unreviewable and irreversible power...to acquit in disre¬ gard of the instruction on the law given by the trial judge...The pages of history shine on instances of the jury’s exercise of its prerogative to disregard instructions of the judge; for example, acquittals under the fugitive slave law.” (U.S. Court of Appeals, 1972,473 F.2d, 1130.) Jury veto power decided the seditious libel trial of Peter Zenger in 1735, and is celebrated as a hallmark of freedom of the press in America. Colonial juries’ refusal to enforce for¬ feitures under the English Navigation Acts is another example. And jury nullification in liquor law trials was a major contributing factor in ending alcohol prohibition. Due to special interest pressure, juries have been misin¬ formed of their right to judge law as well as fact for almost 100 years. Jurors now swear in their oaths to judge only the facts of the case according to the the law as dictated to them by the judge. The majority of judges will not allow attorneys to tell jurors of their power to say “no” to unjust laws. In most cases juries are no longer allowed to hear the defendant’s motives. T consider trial by jury as the only anchor yet imagined by man, by zvhich a government can be hetd to the principles of its constitution. ” —Thomas Jefferson (1789) In a historic Supreme Court civil forfeiture jury trial, first Chief Justice John Jay instructed the jury that the facts of the case had been determined and the only judgment remaining for the jury to make was upon the law itself. “The jury has the right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy.” (Georgia vs. Brailsford, 1794:4.) Fully informed juries are essential for justice, rebuilding respect for the law, protection of individual rights and control of government by the people. FUA publishes both informational and political materials, assists grass roots efforts to inform jurors of their rights, assists state-level lobbying and/or ballot issue efforts, and sponsors conferences toward the goal of telling every potential juror the truth.

Concentrated cannabis oil (grass oil) Concentrated cannabis pollen (kif) Concentrated cannabis resin (hashish) Deacrlptlon: Cannabis Is the crude vegetable preparation of the plants Cannabis satlva L. and Cannabis Indlca. The pharmacologically active components of the drug are cannablnolds, Including delta-9 trans-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabldlol, cannablnol, tetrahydrocannablvarln and perhaps 60 other cannablnolds of varying pharmacological properties. Unique both in botany and pharmacological action, cannablnolds are not nitrogenous alkaloids, and their site and mode of action In the body are unknown, though they clearly modify neurotransmission In the CSN. Cannablnolds worksynergistlcally, In that the effects of delta-9 trans-tetrahydrocannablnol In Isolation, for example, are very greatly modified by Its Interaction In crude cannabis with cannabidlol, which antagonizes some effects of the tetrahydrocannabinol and potentiates others. Cannabis also necessarily comprises a broad variety of nonpharmacological substances common to vegetable matter in general; however, most or all of these extraneous materials can be substantially eliminated, before the drug is ingested, by appropriate filtering devices. Precautions: Cannabis Is proscribed under the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act of 1972. Its possession Is a felony under federal law and physicians who facilitate Its use by patients are subject to prosecution under conspiracy statutes; merely advising a patient where he or she might obtain cannabis renders a physician liable to arrest. Patients who use cannabis should be advised of the risk of prosecution and Imprisonment and the material health hazards posed thereby. Contraindications: Persons suffering from viral or bacterial pulmonary Infections should not Ingest cannabis by Inhalation until remission of the Infection. Extended and regular administration to persons with emphysema and lung fibrosis may aggravate these conditions. Adverse Reactions: Idiosyncratic anxiety crises, dysphoric dissociation and depersonalization syndromes may occur In a very few patients experiencing acute onset of cannabis’s mental effects for the first time; dosage should be lowered and an attempt should be made to determine the root emotional cause of the reaction. If the reaction persists long after the drug wears off or dependably occurs with succeeding administrations, a preexisting premorbld psychotic condition may be suspected and therapy should be discontinued. Raw cannabis contains significant levels of mutagenic hydrocarbon condensates, toxins that Irritate pharyngo-laryngeal, bronchial and alveolar tissues; water-soluble cytotoxlns exist In canna¬ bis that inhibit the bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages; and the heat of the smoke from a cigarette depresses the activity of ciliated esoph¬ ageal cells. While none of these effects poses any material hazard to patients free from pul¬ monary dysfunction or disease, the use of smok¬ ing devices that both filter and cool the smoke Is recommended over cigarettes for therapeutic administration. Oral administration of cannabis has shown considerable effectiveness, particularly with glaucoma and antlemesls; but the physician cannot determine the dosage dependably when cannabis Is eaten, since the drug Is absorbed very unevenly through the G.l. tract and Its decarboxylation there by HCI may alter its psychic and physiological effects in ways not yet adequately studied. The minimal untoward effects of cannabis upon lung function and tissues renders Inhalation of its smoke a superior route of administration for therapeutic purposes; the patient Is able to self-titrate the dosage, inhalation by inhalation, until the precise therapeutic effect Is achieved. Tachycardia, showing a pulse-rate Increase of 30 to 60 percent, dependably occurs during the drug’s onset In patients previously unexposed to cannabis; this usually persists 30 to 45 minutes. The rise and decline in heart action Is smooth and uniform. Cannabis-Induced tachycardia may render the drug Inadvisable for use with p&tlents who are receiving Digitalis In cardiac therapy. Cannabis commonly promotes lassitude and drowsiness and has been shown to significantly prolong reaction time In human subjects. Patients receiving It should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery. Drug Interactions: While the site and nature of cannabis's mental effects In the CSN are largely unknown, It appears to raise the free levels of serotonin in the Intersynaptlc gap, probably by blocking its reuptake Into the presynaptic neuron. Thus It appears to Intensify and facilitate the effects of tricyclic antidepressants by promoting a higher Intersynaptlc ratio of serotonin to norepine¬ phrine and dopamine. Its Interaction with monoamine oxidase Inhibitors is similarly felicitous, since both medications work to raise free serotonin levels. With the benzodiazepines, It has been suggested that cannabis may exert some yet-undetermlned influence on the brain hormone GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) to facilitate the penetration of benzodiazepine metabolites Into brain tissue and to potentiate their anxiety-alleviating action there. (Note: By Itself, cannabis is not an antidepressant but a potentiator of moods. As an adjunct to antidepressant therapy, It should be employed only by physicians as part of a broad program of personal counseling.) Cannabis has no known adverse reactions with any other drug. Suspicion exists, however, that In the liver cannabis metabolites may react with alcohol metabolites to promote an unwholesome modification of both drugs' psychotropic effects. Dosage and Administration: Psychophyslological responses to cannabis are greatly dependent on the Individual patient's experience with the drug: After an Initial period of three to five weeks of regular administration, a subject will exhibit a measure of habituation to some acute effects such as euphoria and tachycardia, while other effects, such as intraocular pressure reduction and antlemesls, will remain constant. Therefore It is advisable In most cases to have the patient determine the dosage for himself until the desired therapeutic effect Is realized. Inhaling cannabis smoke Is the most dependable known way to accomplish this. Due to the nature of cannabis as a crude vegetable material, a standard uniform dose is virtually Impossible to establish. The erratic provenance of street cannabis, which can originate from anywhere In the world, complicates It even further. Cannabis grown in northern latitudes, as a rule, will generally produce a pronounced sedative effect and Its physical effects will typically be muted though prolonged. Equatorial cultivars of cannabis, by contrast, may exert a decided tonic effect with Immediate and conspicuous physical effects of relatively brief duration per single dose. Of the cannabis cultivars most widely available on the street market to patients In the United States, the commonest commercial Colombian cultlvar— “Santa Marta gold—probably has the most dependable uniform effect per dose. Usage In pregnancy: Cannabis has no proven teratogenic properties. Due to the illegal status of the drug, however, no longitudinal epidemiological statistics are available in this regard. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare has imposed an arbitrary cannabls-testlng ban on all women “who are or may become pregnant,” rendering It Impossible to scientifically Investigate the influence on this or any other health concerns unique to women. The antiemetic properties of cannabis have been widely exploited by pregnant women to counter¬ act morning nausea, but until more Is known of Its precise action In the body, It should not be recommended for regular use during pregnancy. Recent research has suggested that all psychotropic drugs may exert some measure of subtle teratogeny, and there Is no substantive reason to believe that cannabis escapes this category. □ (Reprinted from High Times, July, 1980.) | — 158 —"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"OPINION O.C.ft 5*^ c r j J&-Mnaoj ‘Collective conscience’ breeds Dutch tolerance By OAVIO MORRIS Holland. Every conservative's ni ghtmar e come true. Legal prostitution. Coffeehouses that sell marijuana to teen-agers. Free abor¬ tions on request Free needles for heroin ad¬ dicts. Special rooms for prisoners to conduct liaisons with outside partners, even of the same sex. Euthanasia in hospitals. To Americans, such policies represent a moral breakdown. They are a prescription for social anarchy: promiscuity, drug addic¬ tion. family breakdown, AIDS. To Amster¬ dam Judge Frits Ruter, such policies are \"above all, pragmatic and undogmatic.\" You cannot solve social problems “by making them taboo,\" he insists. The Dutch don't drive their human weak¬ nesses underground. Amsterdam’s Utopia coffeehouse, where you can choose among 10 kinds of hashish and grass for about $6 a gram, is five doors from the neighborhood police station. The Royal Symphony Hall backs into a red-light district that houses not only prostitutes in well-lit windows, but also sex shops that would make Hugh Hefner blush. The minis ter of justice of Holland’s con¬ servative government explains: The aim is to “prevent as much as possible a situation in which more harm is caused by criminal pro¬ ceedings than by the (activity) itself.” Legalization allows the government much more flexibility than criminalization. Prosti¬ tutes must undergo regular health examina¬ tions. One result is an astonishingly low rate of AIDS infection: less than 1 percent, com¬ pared to 30 percent to 40 percent among America’s illegal but probably equally plen¬ tiful hooker population. Clean needles for intravenous drug users slows AIDS trans¬ mission among a group that now accounts for half the AIDS population in New York. Allowing prisoners sex with loved ones re¬ duces prison tension and curbs aggressive in-prison homosexuality. As for drugs, allowing the sale of marijua¬ na gives the government much more credi¬ bility when it warns the young about the dangers of hard drugs. Indeed, says the Dutch secretary of drug policy, \"Cannabis used to be the symbol of the youth culture — it was attractive because it was forbidden. Our aim was to turn it into an unsensational item.” It worked. The proportion of Dutch teen agers using marijuana has dropped substantially. It is a fraction of U.S. use. Crack is virtually non-existent David Morris, an author, lecturer and consultant, writes for the St Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. He spent a week in the Neth¬ erlands this fall. All Dutch schools teach sex educatioa A year’s worth of birth control pills costs about $10. Yet Dutch girls are no more sex¬ ually active than American girls. And 90 percent of those teen-agers who are active use contraceptives. Holland’s teen-age preg¬ nancy rate is one-seventh that of America’s. American teen-agers have 12 to 14 times more abortions than Dutch teen agers. The Dutch treat prostitutes, drug addicts, teen-age pot smokers and the terminally ill with respect. Not surprisingly, respect breeds responsibility, not license. The hero¬ in addict uses a clean needle. The prostitute does not transmit disease. The teen-ager uses birth control. Doctors assist a patient’s death only after a long, close relationship with that patient Where does this sense of mutual respect and collective responsibility come from? His¬ torian Simon Schama looks to Dutch history in “The Embarrassment of Riches.” In the 1600s, tiny Holland was the most prosperous nation on earth. Riches bred a \"collective conscience” that demanded gen¬ erosity for the needy and tolerance for those with different religions and different habits. Obligations to community, to society came first Today the Dutch continue that 300-year tradition. They know the most fertile breed¬ ing ground for irresponsible behavior is the slum. Thus they offer the world’s most com¬ prehensive social support programs. Medi¬ cal care is free; child care plentifuL Unem¬ ployment insurance is nearly forever. Amsterdam suffers a bousing problem incomprehensible to U.S. urban planners. Sufficient housing exists for those of modest means, but there’s not enough for the rich. Such generosity of spirit and purse has not undermined Dutch prosperity. They live longer than Americans. Their economy is robust, their businesses competitive. This prosperous country of 14 million has much to teach us, for tolerance has never been an American trait. We have a long his¬ tory of demanding moral purity of our neighbors and eagerly locking them up if they transgress. We rely on force to solve our social problems, not wisdom. Why we do so is up to the historians and sociologists to ponder. That we do so seems not to be in question. Today America impris¬ ons a larger proportion of its citizens than any country except South Africa, and Presi¬ dent Bush now vows to double the number of federal prisoners. The Dutch watch in amazement our descent into social anarchy. They cannot understand why a nation would willfully destroy itself to control its citizens’ personal behavior. There’s no solution to drugs or ‘the war’ Legalization would force us to face a serious problem in a realistic way By William F. Buckley Jr. T h e release last month by Judge Robert Sweet of New York of his opinions on drug policy brought on a furious response from most quarters, who roiled at his suggestion that we would be better off under a program of legalization than under the auspices of our present war on drugs. He did find support here and there; columnist Earl Caldwell, without exactly endorsing Judge Sweet's opinions, found them responsible, serious, and worth considering; Ann Landers and Dear Abby, once again without committing themselves, asked the question, \"Is le¬ galization the answer? Lord knows that what we are doing now isn’t working.” George Crockett of Detroit became the first congressman to come out for legal¬ ization. In doing so, he did not cite the speech of Judge Sweet, but he used most of Sweet's arguments. Columnist Rich¬ ard Cohen summarized his views by writ¬ ing: “The cries for legalization may re¬ flect an irrational impatience with the unsuccessful war on drugs. Possibly, though, they reflect some sound thinking — an alternative route that might work and save lives. Not even to consider such an option — given the carnage in the inner city — is not wise. Wr.ise, it may even be what drug czar William Bennett calls legalization proposals: ‘morally scandalous.’ ” What strikes the eye of one observer of the drug controversy is a point or two not conventionally raised. The Wall Street Journal , in an agitated reply to Judge Sweet and others, made the point, inter¬ esting in itself, that people should stop comparing drugs such as crack and her¬ oin with cigarettes and alcohol. We must concede what we have no alternative than to concede, namely that tobacco <270,000-320,000 deaths per year) and al¬ cohol (50,000-150,000) shouldn't be com¬ pared with the hard stuff for the following reason, namely that when people sit down to light up or to have a drink they do not become psychologically or emotion¬ ally deranged, which is a good point and true. When the average social drinker or¬ ders a margarita, he anticipates a light elevation of the spirit. When the crack user smokes a rock, he wants the equiva¬ lent of what the man who ordered a mar¬ garita would want if instead of ordering one at the bar, he ordered 20 — clearly intending to pass out. In doing so, he de¬ sires a kind of escapism that we never associate with the cigarette smoker, the rational functioning of whose mind is un¬ affected by cigarettes, never mind the. biological attrition he is inviting. The exercise reminds us that it is diffi¬ cult to compare any experience to any other experience, because all of them are in some way different. Assuming that the only consideration was how many deaths does it cause, then unquestionably the first drug to be outlawed would be tobac¬ co. But the tobacco people would counter by pointing out precisely the differences here outlined, namely that tobacco users don’t go about dropping out, and some¬ times causing mayhem. . 1 Where some legalizers make a mistake is in suggesting that legalization might constitute a “solution” for the drug prob¬ lem. That is careless, given that there is no solution to the drug problem. Conser¬ vative philosophy, by the way, rejects absolutely the use of the word “solution” except in narrow situations. One can cor¬ rectly speak of the solution to the small¬ pox problem, one of the great boons of science. Science will never come around with a packaged solution to the search for escapism. The person who takes drugs because for a few moments he is made psycholog¬ ically free of the awful impositions of life in the ghetto, is indulging an impulse which, mulatis mutandis, is not unrelat¬ ed to that of the woman who picks up A volume of poems to relieve her of preoc¬ cupation with quotidian concerns. The drives are not unrelated: watching a soap opera on television, reading a thrill¬ er, smoking a cigarette, taking a drink smoking a crack rock have in common the desire to remove oneself from the immediate scene. The differences that engage our attention have to do with the effect of the one form of escapism on the individual, compared to other forms of escapism. There is no \"solution\" to the problem in legalization. What legalization advocates seek is a heavy mitigation of the concom¬ itant consequences of the war on drugs: crime, the pre-emption of the energies of the justice system, and the engagement of society in a futile exercise. Legaliza¬ tion advocates are saying not that they have a solution to the drug problem, but that they are better off facing the situa¬ tion that would eventuate after legaliza¬ tion than what they face today as drug warriors.

Experts acknowledged that the drug, theophylline, is vitally impor¬ tant to the 10 million Americans who suffer from chronic asthma and lung disease. But if taken when an asthma sufferer has a high fever or the flu, the drug becomes toxic and can result in'seizures and permanent injuries. In a letter sent last week, the American Trial Lawyers’ Associa¬ tion (ATLA) is asking the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration to ban five over-the-counter asthma drugs, in¬ cluding Primatene Tablets, Bronk- otabs, Bronkolixir and Bronkaid Tablets, that contain theophylline. “Theophylline is one of the top three medicines that are most diffi¬ cult for physicians to use,” said Dr. Howard Zeitz, an allergist at Grant Hospital in Chicago. “Neither of the other two are in over-the- counter-drugs.” Drug manufacturers, on the other hand, say the lawyers are launching a “publicity campaign aimed at alarming asthma pa¬ tients.” “Properly used, under physician supervision and in accordance with approved labeling, serious theophylline side effects have been very rare,” said officials at the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical Schering-Plough Corp. “Our pro¬ ducts have been prescribed appro¬ ximately 60 million times since 1985 alone, and in that time the reported incidence of serious adverse drug events . .. has been only 1.3 per 100,000 prescriptions.” While the drug, which occurs commonly in tea, has been used for nearly 50 years to relieve breathing problems, the trial lawyers charged that the 40 U.S. manufac¬ turers of theophylline have known of its dangers for at least a decade and have failed to adequately warn doctors. The life of Jennifer Pollock, a 7- year-old from Everett, Wash., will never be the same because of the deadly combination of the drug and high fever, her father told repor ters at a press conference here—a combination that her physician was not aware of. “Theophylline wjs a big help to Jennifer when she needed it to help her breathing,” Jeffry Pollock said. “But it also caused severe brain damage that Jennifer will never be able to fully overcome.” When Jennifer caught the flu as a three-year-old, her doctor gave her an additional dose of theophylline to help her breathe, Pollock said. Soon after, the child suffered con¬ vulsions and permanent brain damage. She now functions as if a 6-month-old child. “I just don’t want this to happen to other families,” Pollock said when asked about the nationwide theophylline awareness campaign. “It shouldn’t have to happen.” Pollock sued and settled with Jennifer’s doctor, James Kripcera, who in turn successfully sued the Fisons Corp. for failing to warn him of the drug’s dangers. Dr. Peter Young, senior vice president at the Fisons Corp., a British pharmaceutical company headquartered in Rochester, N.Y., said the company will no longer manufacture theophylline. “For commercial reasons, we’ve either stopped or are in the process of discontinuing products with theophylline,” he said. “We can’t add any other comment to that.” In 1989, more than 6,500 cases of theophylline overdose were re¬ ported to poison control centers across the country, according to ATLA. Nearly 100 of those cases re¬ sulted in serious injury, and 34 in death. Not all of these cases are in litigation, lawyers said. Lawyers are asking that drug companies and the FDA make all doctors and patients aware of the potentially harmful side effects of theophylline. While the Physicians Desk Reference mentions that theophylline is difficult to elimin¬ ate from the body during high fev-. ers, that information not listed under the “Warning” section, but rather in general information of the make-up of the drug. “I firmly believe that what ATLA is doing is of vital importance,” said Paul Luvera, Pollock's attor¬ ney. “Just as a result of our case, we heard from physicians, some of whom were taking the drug them¬ selves or giving it to their children, that they didn't know of the dangers either.” — 162 —"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"MUSIC The Weed One of thr more nervous beroes of bot jazz, Gene Krupa, went to California's San Quentin Prison this week to serve a sentence of one to six years. Drummer Krupa bad been sentenced on two counts. The first was a felony: employing a minor, one John Paleakos, to transport narcotics. The second and lesser count was a mis¬ demeanor : possession of the drug marijua¬ na, a violation which, if it could be uni¬ versally detected, would land a great many jazz musicians behind prison bars. It is no secret that some of the finest flights of American syncopation, like some of the finest products of the symbolist poets, owe much of their expressiveness to the use of a drug. But the nature and effects of marijuana, specifically, are a good deal more of a secret than they need be. To its users, the drug has many names —many of them evasive. Marijuana may be called mugples, mooter, Mary Warner, Mary Jane. Indian bay, loco weed, love weed, bambalacha, mohasky, mu, moocah, grass, tea or blue sage. Cigarets made from it are killers, goof-butts, joy-smokes, gig¬ gle-smokes or reefers. The word marijuana is of Mexican origin and means “the weed that intoxicates.\" It is made from the Indian hemp plant, a spreading green bush resembling sumac. Known to the pharma¬ copoeia as Cannabis saliva, it is a source of important paint ingredients and rope fiber as well as narcotics. It can be grown easily almost anywhere, hence tends to be inexpensive, as drugs go. Its recent prices (to)* to sot* a rigaret) have placed it be¬ neath the dignity of big-time racketeers. But its furtive preparation and sale afford a modest living to thousands. In most U.S. cities the marijuana sales¬ man peddles his cigarets to known clients in public places. He is known to his clients as a “pusher.\" His clients are known as ‘•vipers.” Etiquette between pushers and vipers is necessarily delicate. When he wants to buy, the viper sidles up to the pusher and inquires “Are ya stickin’?\" or “Are ya layin’ down the hustle?\" If the answer is affirmative, the viper says. “Gimme an ace” (meaning one reefer), “a deuce' (meaning two), or “a deck” (meaning a large cumber i.

In some form, hemp has been smoked since long before the beginning of the Christian Era. It was familiar to the ancient Hindus and Pc:- sians. It is smoked widely by the Arabs. Eminent European vipers have included De ljuincey. Baudelaire (who once, under the influence, sketched a self-portrait, with the Colonne Yendome in hurirish re¬ spective —see cur, p. 34 1 , Dumas, Gautier. The L'.S. vogue, precisely coincident with the vogue tor hot jazz, began in New Orleans a generation ago, moved up the Mississippi to Chicago, thereafter spread east and west. Despite its lurid reputation, marijuam seems no more harmful than alcohol Though habitual criminals often use it. psychiatrists and police narcotic experts hat e never been able to prove that it in¬ duces criminal tendencies in otherwise normal people. It is less habit-forming than tobacco, alcohol or opium. The most confirmed vipers have no particular crav¬ ing for the drug. They just enjoy its effects. Like alcohol, of course, it can raise hell with orderly living release bad as well as good personality traits. But in spite of the legends, no case of physical, mental or moral degeneration has ever been traced exclusively to marijuana. Because of its non-habit-forming char¬ acter, doctors have recently been experi¬ menting with the drug as an aid in curing opium addiction. In the world of hot jazz, marijuana's relatively benign effects are attested by long experience. Lushes oiten die young from cirrhosis of (he liver or apoplexy, often spend their final days in delirium tremens. But vipers frequently live on to enjoy old age.

Knight Aldrich, U. S. Public Health Service, reports. (Public Health Reports, March 31.) The tests were made with 12 healths white male patients who volunteered for the experiment. AH were serving prison sentences for violation of the Marihuana Tax Act and had used the drug for an average of nine and one- half years. Of the 12, two were pro fessional musicians and two had musi cal ambitions. The Seashore tests, played on phono graph records, were used \"because thc\\ seemed to offer the most carefully stand ardized tests available of musical ca¬ pability.\" Each man was given the test three times at intervals of one week. The first two were given without any drug, (he third /our and one-half hour* after the drug. The dose and time in¬ terval produced a “kick\" comparable to a satisfying amount of marihuana in most cases. When asked whether they noticed any differences in their own perform¬ ances on the tests, eight said they felt sure they had improved with the drug, three felt they remained the same, and one “couldn’t say.\" Actually, however, nine of the 12 had lower scores on the tests after the drug than on the second trial without it. “The Seashore test,\" Dr. Aldrich points out, “measures only sensory mu¬ sical capacity and leaves out of account such factors as motor-speed and coordi¬ nation, release of inhibitions and fa¬ tigability, which could conceivably in¬ fluence the playing of present-day music.\" Charles Baudelaire.

This is seen from a War Production Board order prohibiting die use of domestically produced hemp seed for any purpose except the growing of hemp fiber or the growing of additional hemp seed. The officially stated reason is to conserve and increase the domestic hemp supply. In thr past the hulIC of this country’s hemp requirements for rope and sacking have come from the Philip pines.

THE OREGONIAN. WEDNESDAY, APRIL 17,1985 VATICAN CITY (AP) - First lady Nancy Reagan brought her anti-drug campaign to the Vatican in a 30-minute audience Saturday with Pope John Paul II, who deplored the “tragic and debilitating” effects of drug abuse. The Vatican and Italian security of¬ ficials cleared half of St. Peter's Square of pilgrims and tourists to let the Rea¬ gan motorcade pass through an arch adjoining the largest church in Chris¬ tendom. At the start of the meeting, the 64- year-old pope handed Reagan a three- page speech in English in which he lauded her “participation in the fight against drug abuse and in the rehabi- liation of those whose lives have been affected by this social evil.\" A Vatican spokesman, Monsignor GiuUo Nicolini, said the pontiff did not read the speech in order to be able to devote more time to talking to Reagan. The undelivered speech, distributed by the Vatican while the audience was under way, called drug abuse \"a great social evil\" and said “the consequences for the family and for society in gener¬ al are tragic and debilitating.\" It called on world leaders to cooper¬ ate \"with a view to arresting, and eventually eliminating, this great social evil.\" In an exchange of gifts, Reagan gave the pope the book “Scribes and Sources,” described as a scholarly work by A.S. Osley, and a rectangular crystal box with the White House and Reagan's signature etched on the top. Reagan was given a silver and mother-of-pearl rosary by the pontiff. After the audience, the pope and the first lady walked out of the library hand in hand, and the pope was over¬ heard saying: \"God bless you Thank you very much for your visit.\" After the audience, she toured the Sistine and Pauline chapels for 20 min¬ utes. Reagan flew back to Bonn in the afternoon to rejoin President Rea¬ gan for a state visit to West Germany. Torts of f}\\ r) K; Court gives CIA power to cloak sources in secrecy DOONESBURY By Garry Trudeau By PHILIP HAOER LA Tl—»-» ■ *»»]« e» WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the Central Intelligence Agency has sweeping authority to maintain the secrecy of Its far-ranging sources of intelligence data. The court said that even when disclosure would not affect national security, the CIA may refuse requests under the Freedom of Informa¬ tion Act for the names of scientists, researchers and others who provide intelligence for the books, journals and other documents the agency analyzes. “Congress intended to give the director of central intelligence broad power to protect the secrecy and Integrity of the intelligence proc¬ ess,\" Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote for the court. “The reasons are too obvious to call for enlarged discussion; without such protec¬ tions the agency would be virtually impotent.\" The justices overturned a federal appeals court ruling that said the CIA could withhold the identity of only those sources who provided information that could not be obtained without guaranteeing confidentiality. They said the forced disclosure of any Intelligence source could have a “devastating impact” on the agen¬ cy. Twp Justices, while agreeing in a concurring opinion that the appellate ruling had been too restrictive, argued that the Supreme Court had gone too far. Justice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Justice William J. Brennan Jr., said the justices' broad grant of authority to the CIA will “mangle, seriously,\" congressional efforts to balance the public's interest in Information with the gov¬ ernment's need for secrecy. The decision also was denounced by a law¬ yer representing a group that bad sought the names of private researchers and institutions involved In a controversial CIA drug experi¬ ment begun in the 1950s “This comes close to being a complete ex¬ emption of the CIA from the Freedom of Infor¬ mation Act,\" said Paul Alan Levy of the Public Citizen Litigation Group of Washington. “It Is a severe setback for the public's right to learn about abuses by national security agencies.” Levy said the ruling would enable the CIA and, perhaps, other intelligence-gathering agen¬ cies not only to refuse to reveal sources of In¬ formation but also to “hide me details of almost any program that It would prefer the public not know about — so long as It claims disclosure of the information might lead to disclosure of the persons who provided 1L” The ruling came In a case (CIA vs. Sims, 83- 1075) involving an attempt by the Ralph Nader Public Citizen Health Research Group to obtain the names of 185 college professors and other researchers and 80 Institutions that participated in CIA project involving mind-altering drugs.

The California cost is $5.8 billion. By MARLENECIMONS TIMES STAFF WRITER W A SHINGTON-Health care expenses and productivity losses associated with smoking-re¬ lated disease cost the nation more than $52 billion every year, ac¬ cording to a government report released Tuesday. The Department of Health and Human Services, in a national status report to Congress, estimat¬ ed that illnesses caused by smoking impose an average economic bur¬ den of $1 billion per slate, although some states run much higher tabs than others. California, the most populous state, has the highest estimated smoking cost, $5.8 billion, the re¬ port said. Alaska was lowest, with $82 million annually. Following California, in order, were New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio and Michigan. The annual expenses of smok¬ ing-related disease average $221 for every man, woman and child in the nation, ranging from a low of $56 a person in Utah to $284 in Rhode Island, the report said. M e anwhile, congressional sponsors of a law banning smoking on virtually all domestic airline flights vowed Tuesday to fight for no-smoking rules on other forms of transportation and to attack U.S. trade policies that en¬ courage tobacco exports. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N. J.) and Rep. Richard J. Dur¬ bin (D-Ill.) said that they would next press their campaign to apply to Amtrak train service and other transportation. The airline smoking ban, which begins Sunday, will apply to do¬ mestic flights of six hours or less. Longer flights, charter flights and overseas flights are exempt. The law expands and extends a temporary smoking ban on short domestic flights that was adopted in 1987. The HHS report said that ex¬ penses related to smoking are borne indirectly by all Americans in the form of higher private and public insurance premiums and the Increased burden on publicly sup¬ ported health care facilities and personnel. \"Each and every American, in¬ cluding those who don't even smoke, is paying a hidden lax . . . for the consequences of smoking,” HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said in testimony before a Senate committee considering anti-smok¬ ing legislation. \"My view,” Sullivan said, \"is straightforward and simple: no smoking.\" The report was immediately as¬ sailed by the Tobacco Institute, which said that “to assume that smokers impose a cost on society is a misapplication of a valid econom¬ ic theory.\" Brennan Dawson, a spokeswom¬ an for the industry group, said that \"smokers pay their own [insur¬ ance] premiums, so they cover their own costs. And, just because they file a claim, it doesn’t mean it's a smoking claim.” Further, she said, \"if people are less productive, that's not a cost to society—they bear the burden through lower pay, less frequent job promotions or getting fired.\" T he report said that smoking causes more premature deaths than cocaine, heroin, alcohol, fire, automobile accidents, homicide and suicide combined. Sullivan said that smoking kills nearly 400,000 Americans each year and is responsible for more than one of every six deaths in the United States. In addition, he said, smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated among low-income, less-educated Americans. \"I am especially concerned that we make more progress in reach¬ ing young people, women, minori¬ ties and blue-collar workers with accurate and compelling informa¬ tion about smoking and its devas¬ tating impact on their health,” he said in a statement. Dr. Ronald M. Davis, director of the HHS Office on Smoking and Health, said that deaths caused by smoking have increased during the last 20 years, despite a dramatic decline in the number of smokers. In 1965, 40% of all U.S. adults were cigarette smokers, compared to 29% in 1987, he said. , Nevertheless, \"it takes a good 20 to 25 years after the smoking rates go down before we begin to see a decrease in smoking-related deaths and costs,\" he said in an interview. Sullivan recently criticized plans by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. to test-market in Philadelphia a new cigarette, called Uptown, targeted at black smokers. The firm quickly announced that it had canceled the marketing campaign. Sullivan told members of the Senate Labor and Human Re- sources Committee that he was just as upset by the company's plan to introduce another new cigarette,’ called Dakota, reportedly aimed at young blue-collar women. < \"I’m outraged,” he said when questioned about Dakota \"No one believes the tobacco companies when they say they are not target¬ ing young people.” In 1985, the average number of deaths attributed to smoking was 6,097 per stale, ranging from 271 in Alaska to 28,533 in California. , ANNUAL REPORT 1937 j.

By RALPH FRAMMOLINO TIMES STAFF WRITER SACRAMENTO—Led by an unprece¬ dented return of convicted drug dealers, the number of felons paroled to Los Angeles County has increased more than 100% in the last five years, according to statistics released last week by the state Department of Corrections. According to civil libertarians and some parole officials, the rising tide of parolees in the county, as well as elsewhere in Califor¬ nia, may prove ominous news for law-and- order advocates like Gov. George Deukme- jian, who found strong public support in pushing mandatory prison sentences and appointing hard - line judges. As convict' sent off in record numbers to overcrowded state prisons over the last decade return home, observers say, experi¬ ence is showing that more than half of the parolees will be incarcerated again for using drugs or committing other crimes. \"The result of the Deukmejian get- tough-on-crime approach is now coming home to roost. It’s now coming back to haunt us,” said John Hagar, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles. \"Prosecutors told the public that if we put people away for longer sentences in our clean, modern, safe prisons that you—the public—will be safe,” said Hagar, who has represented inmates in lawsuits against the state. \"That wasn't true.

Carter's last two years in office saw an anti-marijuana blit/ sweep the country, abetted by cocaine incidents in voicing Carter staffers, conveniently turned up by Ben singer's DEA. By November of 1980. whatever credibili¬ ty decrim and Carter once possessed had been leachec away. Chapter 3 THE TRUTH ABOUT NAHAS, LAROUCHE & WALDHEIM With Reagan's takeover, Bensinger and Dupont, who left federal government to form a company making urinalysis tests, were replaced as drug policy heavies by Carlton Turner and Ed Meese. But Lyndon LaRouche embarked on the most respectable period of his career, with his candidates running unchallenged as neo¬ conservative Democrats right through the early '80's. According to researcher Dennis King, LaRouche early on gained unique access to the Reagan White House, providing weekly briefings on supposed terrorist plots against Administration figures. Although White House interest flagged after a year or two. as the spurious nature of these false alarms became apparent. LaRouche's policy access through the DEA has con¬ tinued unimpeded to this day. In 1983. LaRouche was officially cleared to meet with Reagan in the White House by the FBI. despite evidence that he might he in violation of the foreign agents' registration act for accep¬ ting millions of dollars from shadowy Latin American sources. The Attorney General declined to send the case to a Grand |ury. But by '83, the Administration had already imple¬ mented the current model marijuana eradication pro¬ gram. committing 80 per cent of its enforcement budget to wiping out domestic growing as well as the flow from Columbia and Mexico. Critics soon were pointing out that this policy was encouraging the Columbians to shift, en masse, to smuggling cocaine. A cocaine glut was in¬ evitable. The view of many feds involved was that with the success of a model marijuana program, they would be able to go back to the taxpayers and get appropriations 168"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"I . 1 YEARBOOK OF THE UNITED .STATES DERARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 1913 2M Yearhook o f the Department of AgrirvUvre.

At a Na¬ tional Research Council conference in Irvine, Calif., researchers presented strong evidence linking acidic rain and snow—usually viewed as an eastern phe¬ nomenon — to salamander deaths in the western United States. Others argued that global climate changes may play a role in the amphibian deaths now plaguing such diverse habitats as the open woodlands of southeastern Australia, the mountain country of northern Colorado and the tropical forests of Costa Rica and Brazil. Behind the mysterious decline, which apparently began 10 to 20 years ago but only recently received unified attention, lies the possibility that the dying animals are an ominous indicator of human-made environmental problems. “There are some things about [amphibians] that make them a very good ‘canary in the coal mine,’” asserts zoologist Henry Wilbur of Duke University in Durham, N.C., referring to the traditional mining practice of detecting toxic gases through their deadly effect on canaries. Amphib¬ ian skin readily absorbs chemicals pres¬ ent in soil and water, he says, and the insects these animals eat may harbor other toxic compounds. Moreover, water “Low level” radioactive waste not worthy of concern WASHINGTON. DC— Radioactive waste could soon join the old tires, banana peels and coffee grounds in Amer¬ ica's landfills if the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission the Envi¬ ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) go through with a policy treating nu¬ clear waste as though it were not radioactive. The NRC in 1986 developed a pol¬ icy called Below Regulatory Concern (BRC) lor deregulating radioactive waste. Although the policy has not yet been implemented, an applica¬ tion lor implementation is expected this spring from the Nuclear Utilities Management and Resource Council. Once the application is approved, more than 30 percent of the nation’s currently regulated \"low level\" nu¬ clear power-plant waste could be dumped as ordinary non-nuclear trash. Under tire BRC label, loads of radioactive waste would travel with regular garbage on highways, rail¬ ways and rivers and could be emp¬ tied in landfills and sewers, burned in incinerators and spread in the form of radioactive sludge on farm¬ lands. The EPA has also included the BRC deregulation policy'in its pro¬ posed radioactive-waste dump stan¬ dards. The deregulation plan does not provide lor notification of haulers, waste handlers or other workers. Several unions have opposed the plan. When the proposal surfaced several years ago, the United Steel¬ workers of America stopped recy¬ cling radioactive metal. In addition, there will be no monitoring once the waste leaves the nuclear power-plant site and communities will not be in¬ formed that they are receiving radio¬ active waste. The major rationale behind dereg¬ ulation is to save nuclear power- plant owners money. The EPA esti¬ mates that the industry's disposal costs will be reduced by $620 million over the next 20 years if one-third of the waste is deregulated. The EPA also notes the human cost—one death per 10,000 people exposed to deregulated waste. The Illinois Department of Nu¬ clear Safety has severely criticized the EPA for its proposed exposure levels. \"Any level of exposure to de¬ regulated nuclear waste is too much, because mere is no plan to verify or enforce that the level won't be ex¬ ceeded,” says Michael Mariotte, dir¬ ector of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service. \"There is no safe level of exposure to radiation, so waste should be isolated lor as long as it remains hazardous.\" Some ol the waste that could be deregulated—including irradiated piping, sewage sludge, sandblasting grit, soils, oils, resins and evaporator bottoms from filtering radioactive water—could remain hazardous for centuries. If the material is burnable, it could be incinerated. If it's water soluble, it could go down the drain. Solid waste could go to landfills, and recyclable metals could be melted down for reuse. Several important questions re¬ main unanswered: why add radioac¬ tive waste to already crowded land¬ fills? How will the public know when and where radioactive waste is being burned or dumped? How will abuse?, such as dumping more radioactive waste than permitted, be prevented?

Wilbur adds that “frogs naturally have great fluctuations in population size” — per¬ haps reflecting an inherent sensitivity to environmental changes. The key to ex¬ plaining the scattered distribution of decline among various regions and spe¬ cies, he maintains, is that many amphibi¬ ans, particularly frogs, need access to several interconnected habitats in order to survive, jumping from pond to pond or from tree to tree when the going gets tough. When alternative dwellings are destroyed, often by human activities, frogs may become sitting ducks for other environmental assaults. Habitat isolation might help explain the demise of the golden toads that virtually carpeted a small rain forest reserve near Monte Verde, Costa Rica, as recently as 1983, says biologist Marc Hayes of the University of Miami. These creatures, he notes, have an unusual characteristic: They lay eggs only during a 10-day “window” between rainy and dry seasons. Recent fluctuations in that inter¬ val could have disrupted the golden toad’s life cycle, Hayes suggests. Sim¬ ilarly, rapid melting of acidic snow in the Colorado Rockies can severely damage tiger salamander eggs during a critical five-day period in development, reports John Harte of the University of California, Berkeley. Hayes and others say stocking lakes with game fish that prey on tadpoles has contributed substantially to the decline of frogs in many U.S. lakes. This, he suggests, might help explain why certain frog species long accustomed to fish-free lakes are the hardest hit in the West. “The interaction [causing the decline] may differ from region to region, but there is clearly a global problem of some kind—some kind of climate effect,” Hayes adds. Researchers point to several inter¬ related trends: a worldwide warming, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane, and a slight increase in ultraviolet light due to thinning of strato¬ spheric ozone. But they admit that no one really knows how such trends might affect amphibian survival, or whether several small factors added together can devastate an existing population. For now, says biologist Harold J. Morowitz of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., the decline may serve as an environmental rallying point for both scientists and the public. “Who cares if 1,000 arachnids become extinct in an Amazon rain forest? That’s dynamite to a scientist,\" he says, “but the public can relate better to Kermit.” - /?.

Today, a Public Interest Group, BACH, Intends to Deregulate Cannabis by Promoting \"Hemp\" and Showing How Everyone Benefits From This Reform. We start with a natural core constituency: Civil libertarians, Rock-n-Roll/Rasta/Jazz music fans, paraphernalia makers and users, medical users, sympathetic media and officials, Vietnam vets, entrepreneurs, the art community and the \"Sixties Generation.\" We can rapidly win over farmers, economists, environmentalists, holistic/natural medicine advocates, the unemployed, hunger relief projects, tax reformers and free market/anti-Big Government forces and others. The Farming Community is our linchpin, linking the Northwest, Midwest and South. It is in financial trouble and will be the first major beneficiary of hemp commerce. Shipping, Investors, Commodities Markets and Banks link these regions, create a role for the ICC* in de- regulating hemp and add to the financial • . pressure for reform. Campaign Summary Textile, Fuel, Paper Industries and - Markets, Medical and Recreational Users are concentrated in coastal ■ •: ■ ■ and urbanized population centers. s j We anticipate strong resistance in pharmaceuticals and plastics, where entrenched forces stand to lose a share of the market when hemp products come into common use. But this pressure will soon be * offset by the support of hemp industry consumers, investors and workers who benefit from new spin-off industries. V Phase One: Organization: Develop and target literature and lobbying campaigns, alert our natural constituency, explain the economic and social significance of this reform to potential allies and win \"celebrity\" endorsements. We need to demonstrate an interstate supply and demand network to establish the economic viability of hemp commerce, thereby drawing financial and political support and setting the stage for ICC intervention against state laws that impede trade. Phase Two: Public Relations: Launch a program of speaking engagements and advertisements (PSAs and paid) to redefine the hemp debate, sway the general public and create a climate of support based on people's self-interest. Our goal is to disassociate hemp from \"drugs\" and align it with jobs, prosperity and traditional American self sufficiency. Phase Three: Deregulation: Introduce non-threatening deregulation legislation, support initiatives/referenda, set up test cases to pursue legalization through the courts and use business pressure to win ICC action. * The federal Interstate Commerce Commission Business Alliance FOR Commerce in Hemp P.O.

By Vincent H. Miller Karl Hess shows us his Pyramod home in West Virginia. A problem facing much of the world today is the availability of decent, affordable housing. We at L.I. have observed this first hand in the 3rd world and in areas like the South African black townships -- and even in the 1st world where great numbers of people are coming to realize that, alter taxes, owning a home is becoming an increasingly more hopeless dream. Happily there are some rays of hope on the horizon, thanks to LI. member Bob Glassco and Mansion Industries Inc. of Industry. California, USA. A VISIT WITH KARL AND THERESE A few weeks ago we had the pleasure of visiting with our dear friends Karl and Thcresc Hess in the hills of West Virginias 1. to help Karl celebrate his 66th birthday and, 2. to see the Hess's new “straw\" house! Straw as a construction material of course is not unknown. It has been used since ancient times and is known for its toughness and durability. But for a modern 21st century family like the Hess’s with a modern office full of Macintosh computers?? Rest assured this is not the same straw construction that in mythology has been huffed and puffed away by malevolent wolves. Glassco and his company have used modern technology and combined a number of unique concepts to produce a practical, inexpensive . . . and yes. revolutionary elegant product THE RIGHT COMBINATION The secret of the success of this form of construction is based on specially compressed and heated pre-formed panels (a process called Envirocor ) and on a uniquely strong pyramidal construction design called Pyramod. The panels are constructed of agricultural fibres such as rice or wheat straw — although sugar cane rind can also be used when properly separated from the pulp. These fibres are heated to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C), compressed under extremely high pressure in special machines and bonded with heavy kraft paper with a plastic adhesive. The resultant 4.75 inch (12cm) thick panels, are then cut to finished dimensions, including window, door, skylight cutouts, etc. with a diamond saw. According to specification sheets provided by Mansion Industries, these panels are remarkably strong, and have the highly desirable characteristic of being able to act as primary load bearing structural materials. They are highly flame resistant, have good insulating qualities and are immune to termite infestation. They are also more resistant to mold and decay than wood and will not emit toxic fumes. Probably the most interesting aspect of the straw house is that construction with the precut panels can be done very Libertarian International is an association of individuals and organizations dedicated to building a free and peaceful world, respect for Individual rights and liberties, and an open and competitive economic system based on voluntary exchange and free trade.

The interior may be painted or wallpapered and a number of finishes may be applied to the exterior, including inexpensive fibreglass matting saturated with a special acrylic. latex compound which can be applied with a roller. Standard systems for water, electrical and climate control are easily incorporated into the floor design. The end result is quite strong and features outstanding resistance to the the type of shock forces encountered during earthquakes and hurricanes. Very important, however, is the fact that the finished product is quite aesthetic. The modern pyramidal vaulted ceilings are not only beautiful but give a great sense of space.

Members of Help End Marijuana Prohibition held a rally on the steps of the state Capitol as part of a 60- dty tour calling for Its legalization. Calling marijuana prohibition **a crime against the American farm¬ er,” group spokesman Shan Clark said an acre of hemp, or marijuana, will yield as much paper as four acres of trees or as much energy as 25 barrels of oil and called it “one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.” “I say there is no public health danger associated with legalization at all.” Clark said. Tve smoked It for years and I can see no ill effects.” be said, adding, “1 represent )0 (million) or 40 million Americans.\" Hemp grows in more soils and climates than any other commercial crop and is naturally resistant to Insects and weeds, making herbi¬ cides and pesticides unnecessary, Gark said. He said hemp was an important cash crop until the late 1930s, and its prohibition was urged by alcohol and synthetic fiber companies. - The paintings of the masters, the U5. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are all 00 hemp, and the USS Constitution was rigged with 60 tons of it in its sails, Clark said. He said marijuana is also a safe stress reliever, and called the Part¬ nership for a Drug-Free America the \"partnership for no competition on the drug market” saying the group’s support from alcohol and pharma¬ ceutical companies has been report¬ ed in the New York Times.

Passed through the ’60s without a single pair of tie-dyed bell-bottoms. Identified more with Merle Haggard’s “Okie from Muscogee” than Jim Morrison’s “Light My Fire.” Yet, I believe that Indian hemp (Cannabis sativa —yes, that Cannabis) has more to offer the paper industry than we are taking advantage of (or more correctly, we are allowed to take advantage of). Tradition, if not federal law, is on the side of hemp, starting with Ts’ai Lun himself. According to the book, The Emperor Wears No Clothes, by Jack Herer, from 75% to 90% of the world’s paper manufactured before 1883 was made from Cannabis hemp fiber, including the Gutenberg Bible and the first two drafts of the Declaration of Inde¬ pendence. Augmenting the tradition of hemp fiber, the USDA in 1916 predicted a papermaking future for nonfiberous portions of the hemp stalk in its Bulletin No. 404, Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material. Hemp hurds are 0.5-in. to 3-in. pieces of the woody inner portion of hemp that have been separated from the fiber. Hurds contain more than 77% cellulose. Reporting on papermaking tests with hemp hurds, the bulletin concluded, “Hemp- hurd stock acts similarly to soda-poplar stock, but will produce a somewhat harsher and stronger sheet and one of higher folding endurance-In fact, the hurd stock might very possibly meet with favor as a book-stock furnish in the Michigan and Wisconsin paper mills, which are within the sulphite fiber- producing region.” A long-awaited mechanized breakthrough in removing the fiber-bearing cortex from the rest of the hemp stalk “without a prohibitive use of human labor” was described in a three- page article in the February 1938 issue of Popular Mechanics entitled, “The New Billion-Dollar Crop.” Written at the time of the passage of the federal Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, the article included the challenge, “If federal regulations can be drawn to protect the .public without preventing the legitimate culture of hemp, this new crop can add immeasurably to American agriculture and industry.” This was not to be, however. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Tax Act uprooted the billion-dollar crop (1938 dollars) before it could be planted. It is the dried flowers and top leaves of the female Cannabis sativa, of course, that constitute marijuana. Without opening the debate on its legalization or the psychotropic effects of its delta-9 tetrahydrocannibal (THC) content, it is worth noting that interest in papermaking from hemp continues as our fiber, energy, and environmental concerns increase. The ’70s was a decade of intensive study of Cannabis papermaking, particularly in Italy, France, Spain, and Holland. Different varieties of hemp have been developed for various papermaking applications, depending on the cooking process and end use of the pulp. Concurrent research and selective breeding reduced THC content. In France, farmers must obtain low-THC Cannibis seed directly from the National Hemp Producers Federation, inform the Ministries of Health and Agriculture of their intent, and have a guaranteed purchaser of their crop. The high cost of limited production currently restricts hemp to specialty use such as European and Asian cigarette papers. Cannibis hemp can probably be pulped in existing kenaf-pulping equipment, but it will take more than imported stock to make it economically feasible. Hemp is the world’s primary biomass producer, growing ten tons/acre in approximately four months. It can produce four times the amount of paper/acre than 20- year-old trees can and will grow in all climatic zones of the contiguous 48 states. Pyrolysis of hemp can be adjusted to produce charcoal, pyrolytic oil, gas, or methanol with a claimed 95.5% fuel-to-feed efficiency. Pyrolytic fuel oil has properties similar to Nos. 2 and 6 fuel oil. Burning charcoal does not cause acid rain. U.S. hemp-growing restrictions were set aside to meet material shortages during World War EL They should now at least be modified to meet pending shortages of fiber, energy, and environmental quality. — 176 — JIM YOUNG is technical editor o/Pulp & Paper %cornpvtarpd^togyt6f^f fpndk^vajniprevenU^i monitoring sysleim;how-ux : ^report m ftseze rprooShg a - 'zcontrolaltmrkQ ‘temperatures {PROCESSING (ProBle ofvnodyud rebtrikjM FederafPeper Boards 'FAugQBta,4a. r t)i9acim rTownsend Paper tostaH"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. © 1991 Dow Jones (3 Company, Inc.

California What Is as Versatile As the Soybean But Illegal Anyway? • • • Hemp Plants Yield Marijuana But Guru Jack Herer Sees Lots of Commercial Uses By Sonia L. Nazario Staff Reporte r of The Wall Street Journal Marijuana isn’t just for smoking any¬ more. The hemp plant has about as many uses as the soybean. It can be made into a food something like tofu, or into a fabric not unlike linen. It can fire the pistons in your Ford. It can be made into plumbing and paper. It has medicinal properties. Indeed, the many real and conceivable uses of hemp strike some people as new and sufficient grounds to legalize mari¬ juana. More than 20 years of failed efforts to legalize the drug call for new tactics, en¬ thusiasts say. Time has pretty much passed the legal- ize-pot movement by. Alaska, which decri¬ minalized the possession for personal use of small amounts of marijuana in 1975, de¬ cided last fail to recrimlnalize. As of March 3, possession isn’t legal any longer in the 49th state; it’s a misdemeanor pun¬ ishable by up to 90 days in jail and a 11,000 fine. Budding Renaissance But Jack Herer, leaning back in his Venice, Calif., bungalow to light his mari¬ juana pipe, continues to believe In hemp. He as much as anyone else is responsible for its budding renaissance. Mr. Herer, 51, has inspired more than 20 grass-roots groups across the country that proselytize hemp. Cannabis saliva, hempsters say, can \"save the world\" and thus should be legalized. The flowering tops and leaves are the parts of the hemp plant people smoke. Mr. Herer spent 17 years researching the uses of the fibrous stalks and oily seeds of the plant native to Asia, which histori¬ cally has been used to produce fiber and pulp for cordage, canvas and paper. It still is cultivated legally in such countries as It¬ aly and Yugoslavia. Mr. Herer hhs docu¬ ments purporting to prove that the real reason the U.S. outlawed marijuana In 1937 was that a new hemp-harvesting machine had so enhanced the plant’s commercial possibilities that it threatened the politi¬ cally powerful producers of wood pulp. During one of his eight stays in jail (a two-week sojourn in 1983 on a civil-disobe¬ dience charge), Mr. Herer turned his body of hemp lore into a 181-page man¬ ifesto, \"The Em¬ peror Wears No Clothes,” which since its 1990 re¬ printing has sold 35,- 000 copies at 312.95. He also has filed 36,- 000 signatures on pe titions to get a hemp initiative on the Cal¬ ifornia ballot next Jack Herer year. (Needed: 385,- - 000 signatures by July 20.) Pot Guru Jack Herer Has New Reasons to Promote The Hemp Plant: Food, Fuel and Fashionable Attire In recent months hemp groups inspired by Mr. Herer have begun turning up on college campuses, trying to rework hemp's image. \"We realized that smoking pot (while) dressed in tie-dyes in front of the White House wasn’t getting us anywhere,\" con¬ cedes Chris Conrad, founder of the Busi¬ ness Alliance for Commerce in Hemp. Believers in San Francisco scrawl \"bum pot, not oil\" graffiti, even though the line has a whiff of the '60s about it. And from Washington to Los Angeles, activists hoist \"Hemp for Fuel\" signs at rallies. Kentucky lawyer Gatewood Galbraith, a orofessed prolific pot smoker, hopes to ride Continued From First Page his Hempmobile, a 1980 Mercedes-Benz that runs on hemp-seed oil, to victory In this month’s Kentucky Democratic guber¬ natorial primary. He isn’t expected to win. Country star Willie Nelson, before his recent \"HempAid” concert for Mr. Gal¬ braith in Louisville, remarked: \"It's a shame farmers can't grow hemp.\" He says he’s concerned about the family farm. The hemp lobby reveres history. Co¬ lumbus trusted hempen sails. The founding fathers did their rough drafts of the Decla¬ ration of Independence on hemp paper. Hemp \"is as much a part of the human condition as walking upright,\" insists Ron¬ ald Miller, a tool grinder in the aerospace Industry who greases his long gray hair with oil pressed from hemp seeds. Advocates calculate that by planting 6% of the U.S. in hemp, enough oil could be produced to meet the country’s energy needs. Hemp \"tofu\" (\"bempfu\") and hemp gruel could help end world hunger. Hemp-based paper could save entire for¬ ests. (The argument here Is that hemp plants yield four times the pulp of forested acreage.) Kimberly-Clark Corp. confirms that its French unit harvests hemp to make paper for Bibles and cigarettes. Experts in fuel and fiber (unlike enthu¬ siasts ) aren’t all that high on hemp, how¬ ever; they say it costs too much to use. Fiber Importer Frank Ricclo says that hemp costs three times as much as wood pulp for paper production. But Mr. Herer, calling himself a \"hemp savant,” in his book offers 310,000 to any¬ one who can prove him wrong about Can¬ nabis. Source of Financing In the 1970s, Mr. Herer sold his Los An¬ geles sign-lighting maintenance business and opened and acquired two head shops, stores that sell drug paraphernalia. He used some of his profits to finance never- successful attempts in California and Ore¬ gon to legalize marijuana. Mr. Herer, who says he smokes four joints a day, has protested marijuana laws by smoking grass outside the Los Angeles offices of the Federal Bureau of Investiga¬ tion and the Drug Enforcement Adminis¬ tration. He and fellow advocates march in parades wearing tri-comered hats and playing fife and drum to recall Colonial days when hemp was freely grown. Some of Mr. Herer’s friends defected aldng the way, but he has remained'true to his cause. Take, for instance, the matter of \"Hemp for Victory,\" a 1942 film produced by the Agriculture Department that urged patriotic farmers to cultivate hemp for wartime (nonsmoking) uses. When the USDA a few years back denied that any such film existed. Mr. Herer journeyed to Washington and found an uncataloged copy at the Library of Congress. Reading Matter \"This is a bigger cover up than Iran- Contra,\" growls artist Genie Brittingham- Erstad, a husky-voiced San Gabriel, Calif., hempster sitting outside the main federal building in downtown Los Angeles at a ta¬ ble heaped high with Hungarian hemp twine and copies of Mr. Herer's book. Mr. Herer hai some authoritative back¬ ing when he talks up the medicinal benefits of marijuana, which have nothing to do with drug abuse. Cancer specialists say that tetrahydrocannabinol, the active in¬ gredient of marijuana, can be helpful in treating nausea and in stimulating pa¬ tients’ appetites. According to a survey re¬ ported this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine, nearly half of doctors polled said they would prescribe marijuana If it were legal. (There are rare legal exceptions.) Hemp Shirts Hemp has so many commercial possi¬ bilities. Sativa Creations Inc., of Vancou¬ ver, sells Stoned Wear shorts and shirts, in the popular 45% cotton, 55% Imported hemp blend. They come with or without the marijuana leaf logo prominently dis¬ played, for customers who do or don’t wear their sentiments on their sleeves. “Wrap yourself up in marijuana legally.\" the company advertises. Theodora Kerry, a California masseuse who says she has smoked bud and leaf for 25 years, is another die hard, still optimis¬ tic about legalization. Her town, Santa Cruz, was once \"hemp Ignorant,\" she says. So she helped found Cannabis Conversa¬ tions and the Holy Hemp Sisters, which sponsored the recent Great Santa Cruz Hemp Revival and Community Extrava- Ganja. Hundreds of locals gathered in the town community center, forming a sacred circle as the Holy Hemp Sisters beat drums and recited the virtues of hemp in producing food, fuel and clothing for a cold and hun¬ gry world. 177"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"SCIENCE Test Negative A look at the “evidence” justifying illicit-drug tests M o re than eight million work¬ ing .Americans had their urine tested for illegal drugs in 1989, and as many as 15 million will undergo such testing this year, ac¬ cording to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (nida). The fraction of companies that subject employees or job applicants to testing has jumped from 21 percent in 1986 to more than 50 percent last year, according to the American Management Association. The trend seems likely to continue: a majority of the respondents to a re¬ cent Gallup poll favored random drug testing of all workers. What underlies the broad accept¬ ance of a practice that conservative Supreme Court Justice .Antonin Scalia has called a “needless indignity ”? One factor may be the alarming statistics cited by testing advocates to demon¬ strate the high costs of drug abuse. Examination of some of these claims suggests that they do not ahvays accu¬ rately reflect the research on which they are based. In fact, some of the data could be used to “prove” that drug use has negligible or even benefi¬ cial effects. Consider these examples. • Last year President George Bush declared that “drug abuse among American workers costs businesses anywhere from S60 billion to $100 billion a year in lost productivity, absenteeism, drug-related accidents, medical claims and theft.\" Variants of this statistic abound in discussions about drug abuse and are commonly repeated without qualification by the media. Yet all such claims derive from a single study, one that “was based unon assumptions which need addi¬ tional validation,” according to an as¬ sessment last year by nida, the chief federal agency sponsoring research on substance abuse. The study grew out of a survey of some 3,700 households by the Re¬ search Triangle Institute ( rti) in 1982. The rti group found that the average reported income of households with at least one person who admitted to having ever used marijuana daily (20 days or more in a 30-day period) was 28 percent lower than the average re¬ ported income of otherwise similar households. The rti researchers de- 18 Scientific American March 1990 AND THE (] 26 PHYSICAL SCIENCES 28 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 32 TECHNOLOGY 35 MEDICINE 36 OVERVIEW fined that difference in income as \"loss due to marijuana use”; the to¬ tal loss, when extrapolated to the gen¬ eral population, came to $26 billion. The researchers then added on the estimated costs of drug-related crime, health problems and accidents to ar¬ rive at a grand total of $47 billion for “costs to society of drug abuse.” This figure—“adjusted” to account for in¬ flation and population increase—rep¬ resents the basis of Bush’s statement, according to Henrick J. Harwood, who headed the rti study and is now in the White House drug-policy office. The rti survey included questions on current drug use (at least once within the past month). Yet accord¬ ing to Harwood there was no signifi¬ cant difference between the income of households with current users of any illegal drug—including marijuana, cocaine and heroin—and the income of otherwise similar households. Does this mean that current use of even hard drugs—as opposed to perhaps a single marijuana binge in the distant past—does not lead to any “loss\"? “You would be on safe ground saying that,\" Harwood replies. • Officials of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have testified before Con¬ gress and at national conferences on drug abuse that employees who use drugs are “3.6 times more likely to injure themselves or another per¬ son in a workplace accident... [and] five times more likely to file a work¬ ers’ compensation claim.” The phar¬ maceutical giant Hoffmann-La Roche, which is leading an antidrug cam¬ paign among businesses (and has a big share of the drug-testing market), also promulgates this claim in “education¬ al” literature. In fact, the study on which the claim — 178 — ITIZEN is based has “nothing to do with [illegal 1 drug useps,” according to a 1988 article in the Unhersity of Kan¬ sas Law Review by John P. Morgan of the City' University of New York Medi¬ cal School. Morgan, an authority on drug testing, has traced the Chamber of Commerce claim to an informal study by the Firestone Tire and Rub¬ ber Company of employees undergo¬ ing treatment for alcoholism. • In an interview with Scientif¬ ic American, J. Michael Walsh, who heads nida’s applied research division and is a strong supporter of workplace testing, singled out two studies that he said showed drug users are more likely to cause accidents, miss work and use health benefits. The studies were done at two utilities: the Utah Power and Light Company and the Georgia Power Company. The 12 work¬ ers in Utah and the 116 in Georgia who served as the primary research sub¬ jects were tested “for cause\": they had either been involved in accidents, exhibited other “problem” behavior (commonly, high absenteeism) or sub¬ mitted to treatment for alcoholism or drug abuse. Critics point out that it should not be terribly surprising if these subjects exhibited the cited traits at a higher-than-average rate. What may be surprising is that, ac¬ cording to a report published by nida last year, Utah Power and Light actual¬ ly “spent $215 per employ ee per year less on the drug abusers in health insurance benefits than on the control group.” Those who tested positive at Georgia Power had a higher promotion rate than the company average. More¬ over, Georgia workers testing positive only for marijuana (about 35 percent of all the positives) exhibited absen¬ teeism some 30 percent lower than av¬ erage. Nationwide, Morgan says, mar¬ ijuana accounts for up to 90 percent of all positive findings, both because it is by far the most widelv used illegal *• drug and because it persists in urine for up to a month (compared with two days for most other drugs). • Perhaps the study most publicized of late by testing proponents involves employees of the U.S. Postal Service. The service tested 4,396 new hirees in 1987 and 1988 and—keeping the test results confidential—tracked the per¬ formance of positives (9 percent of the total) and negatives. By last Sep¬ tember, the service reported, 15.4 per¬ cent of the positives and 10.5 of the"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"negatives had been fired, the positives had also taken an average of six more sick days a year. This study may be distorted by more subtle biases—related to race, age or gender—than those displayed by the utility studies, according to Theodore H. Rosen, a psychologist and a consultant on drug testing In¬ deed, Jacques L. Normand, who head¬ ed the study, acknowledges that mi¬ nority postal workers tested positive at a much higher rate than nonminori¬ ty workers and that previous studies have shown minorities to have higher absenteeism. Morgan points out, moreover, that the Postal Service st.dy (like all those cited above) has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. In fact, he says, only one study comparing the work of dnig-test positives and nega¬ tives has passed peer rev iew. Last \\ ear, in the Journal of General Internal Med¬ icine, David C. Parish of the Mercer University' School of Medicine in Geor¬ gia reported on a study of 180 hospital employees, 22 of whom had tested positive after being hired. Parish ex¬ amined supervisor evaluations and other indexes and found “no differ¬ ence between drug-positive and drug¬ negative employ ees\" at the end of one year. He noted, however, that 11 of the negatives had been fired during that period and none of the positives. • Proponents of testing often imply that drug use among workers is grow¬ ing. A Hoffmann-La Roche brochure, for example, quotes Walsh pronounc¬ ing that “the problem of drug abuse has become so widespread in America that every company must assume that , its employees will eventually be faced with a substance abuse problem.\" Yet in 1989 nida reported that illegal drug use has been decreasing for 10 years and that the decline has accelerated over the last five years. From 198S to ' 988 the number of current users (at least once in the last month) of mari¬ juana and cocaine dropped by 33 and 50 percent, respectively . To be sure, a subset of this group of current users is increasing: nida es¬ timated that from 1985 to 1988 the number of people using cocaine at least once a week rose from 647,000 to 862,000 and daily users increased from 246,000 to 292,000. nida found that addiction to cocaine (including \"crack\") is particularly severe among the unemployed—who are beyond the reach of workplace testing. Clearly, the U.S. has a drug-abuse problem. Could it be that neither indiscriminate testing of workers— which could cost upward of $500 mil¬ lion this year—nor the dissemination of alarmist information by testing advocates is helping to resolve that problem? —John Morgan 179- UCLA RESEARCHERS CALL FOR ENDING CANNABIS PROHIBITION: HEMP HOLDS PROMISE OF SUPER HEALTH AND FEEDING THE WORLD It is no longer a matter of ignorance verses politics. There is no time left to argue. We have reached- a turning point and we must intervene now if we are to have a world left to live in. The truth must be known. The insane prohibitions against the most valuable plant on Earth, cannabis hemp, must yield to public demand and hopefully very soon. The promise of super health and the possibility of feeding the world is at our fingertips. The applications for the wonder plant hemp are continually being discovered and rediscovered as earth’s number one natural resource for food, housing, fuel, clothing, paper, shoes, etc., etc., to name a few. Medical applications are will researched. Studies by Dr. Joanna Budwig, M.D. (nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year since 1979) have shown unparalleled results in the use of essential fatty aids in the treatment of terminal cancer patients. What are essential fatty acids? The term ‘essential’ is the tip-off. Truly, there can be no life anywhere without the essential oils, linoleic and linolenic acids. These essential oils support the immune system and guard against viral and pther insults to the immune system. Studies are in progress using the essential oils to support the immune systems with victims of the H.I.V. virus. So far they have been extremely promising. What is the richest source of the essential oil? Yes, you guessed it, the seeds of the cannabis hemp plant. The seeds contain 25% LNA acid and 51% LA acid. What better proof of the life-giving values of the now illegal seed. Fortunately, when the creator made the hemp plant there were no politicians and lobbies for multinational corporations around to advise, and no ignorant congressional committees setting in executive session to declare it illegal. What the world needs now is intelligent legalization of cannabis hemp, especially for medical intervention. William Eidlman, M.D., U.C. L.A. and R.

The author was plunged into the nightmare world of government forfeiture when her husband was arrested for cultiva¬ tion. Their home was seized though police found no marijuana on their property. Judy Osbum, jewelry designer and instructor, mother of two and 4-H leader spent over 1000 hours in law libraries uncovering the truth about for¬ feiture law to defend their home and expose this injustice. Spectre... is written for lay readers, yet is a valuable refer¬ ence used by attorneys. It details the statutes, protecting and defending prop¬ erty, stopping automatic default judg¬ ment, startling history; contains sample forms, case citings, constitutional defenses, and more: Forfeiture law is based upon medieval superstition and legal fiction that declares property responsible for illegal acts, depriving owners of constitutional protections.

I jccess l Inlimlt “Criminal defense attorneys confronting their first civil forfeiture case feel like they are in an Alice-in- Wonderland world where the property owner generally has the burden of proof, the innocence of the owner is not a defense, rank hearsay is admissible to prove that the property is ‘guilty,’ and the government’s right to the property vests at the time it is used illegally rather than at the time of the forfeiture judgment. [Therefore third party’s interests are subject to the government’s prior claim of forfeiture.] “Civil forfeitures allow the government to impose economic sanctions on persons who are beyond the reach of the criminal law...” David B. Smith Former Associate Director of the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Office “Spectre of Forfeiture is an effective tool for any individual whose property has been seized and is facing a forfeiture lawsuit, and will lend a perspective to understanding the emotional, practical as well as legal aspects of forfeiture proceedings. ... I fully expect that this book will be utilized not only by litigants but by defense counsel and prosecutors as well.” Irwin R. Miller Attorney at Law Unlimited p.o.box1900 Frazier Park.

Only recendy have scien¬ tists rediscovered the astonishing nutritional value of hemp seeds. Besides being 25% protein, the seeds also contain up to 40% high-quality oil. The sustain¬ ing essential fatty acids make up 81% of this oil. No other plant comes close to these proportions. The essential fatty acids are needed by but not produced in the human body. Some physicians blame the lack of essential fatty acids in today’s diet as the source of the degenerative diseases that plague our society. To promote our seeds as food and to educate the public on hemp issues, we have developed The Hemp Seed Cookbook. This new book in¬ cludes traditional and contemporary recipes, such as Hemp Tahini, Hemp Seed Milk, and the delicious Choco¬ late-Almond Hemp Seed Torte. Also included are nutritional information on the unique properties of hemp seeds and a plea for the legalization of com¬ mercial cultivation of Cannabis crops. Each cookbook comes with a 1-pound sample of pre-cooked hemp seeds. We are also distributing larger quantities of hemp seeds at very competitive prices. Until we can convince the nation’s food stores to carry our products, we may be your only source.

This is the first time real linen has been offered in 50 years. Two laboratories have certified this mate¬ rial to be 100% Cannabis sativa. Hemp linen is produced without chemical fertilizers or pes¬ ticides. After harvest, the crop is field retted, a process that returns all nutrients except the fiber to the soil. This is in contrast to cotton, which depletes soil and requires the maximum use of agricultural chemicals. This is heavy material, suitable for a variety of uses includ¬ ing quality pants, shirts, suits, table linens and draperies. Hemp linen is authentic for period costumes and has been the canvas of fine artists for centuries. Its durability makes it ideal for utility items such as tarps, boat covers, awnings, and tepees. We hope to encourage the creation of home-based businesses, sewing the material into finished goods for wholesale and retail markets. This remarkable material comes in 100-meter bales and is sold by the meter (approximately 39 by 60 inches—almost two square yards). There is no better way to demonstrate hemp s amazing potential than to wear clothes made from this beautiful fiber. Price does not include shipping costs.
