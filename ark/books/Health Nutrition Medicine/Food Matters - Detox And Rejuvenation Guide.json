Bibliography and Recommended Reading \" “It starts with a single cell, the first cell splits to become two, and the two become four and so on. After just forty-seven doublings you are ready to spring forth as a human being. Every - one of those cells knows exactly what to do to preserve and nurture you from the moment of conception to your last breath.” - Bill Bryson (from A Short History of Nearly Everything) www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Principals of Cellular Health The principals of the Food Matters ‘Detox and Rejuvenation Guide’ lie in understanding the very make up of our bodies and what exactly constitutes health. What is health? We’ve come to accept that health is simply the “state of being free from illness or injury” (Ox - ford American Dictionary). But it is not difficult to see that you can be free from illness and in - jury and far from healthy, would you agree? Health is indeed much more but what exactly is it then? Health is the ultimate force in the universe, it is energy. In fact “the body is an energy system. Organs are simply collections of cells with identical vibrational patterns and it is a disruption in cellular energy that we label disease.” (Taub, M.D., F.A.A.P.) This is exactly what most ancient healing systems in the world have based their philosophy towards wellbeing on, and if we’re looking at track record here then we’ve got thousands of years to go by. So if a lack or dis - ruption of energy causes disease, and to be free of disease is health then health is energy. So if health is energy where does this energy come from? Energy comes from the little powerhouses in the body called cells of which there are over 75 trillion, right now all working together to produce the living breathing you (Hendler, 1990). In these cells all the nutrients from our food are processed, the waste eliminated and energy is produced. So in looking at health and what constitutes the best food for us to eat we need to look at exactly what it is that causes our cells not only to survive, but more importantly, to thrive. To find the ultimate recipe for health we need to break down what it is that every cell in our body needs to thrive. The recipe for healthy cells 1. Oxygen 2. Nutrients 3. The ability to detoxify It makes sense that in order to maximize our overall health, maintain our optimal weight and assist in reversing or preventing aging and disease we must maximize the functioning and efficiency of each of the cells in our body. One of the easiest and most efficient ways to posi - tively impact your health is through the food choices you make. And the founding premise and question for all the foods and dishes that you will be learning about in the program is: What is the most natural and efficient way to bathe the cells of my body with the nu - trients they need to thrive and allow them the room they need to detoxify? www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Healing Foods Based on the premise of cellular health there are particular foods and dietary approaches which are exceptionally effective in activating the body’s own healing system, regardless of the disease or illness. It is these particular methodologies which have not only been verified by modern science but also proven its worth over the long term with some of the healthiest cultures in the world such as the Hunzans, Okinawans, Abkhasians to name but a few. (See studies in the great book Healthy at 100 by John Robbins) The Food Matters ‘Detox and Rejuvenation Guide’ is designed to unite the power of these healing foods in a way that makes it fun and practical to apply to your everyday life. Food is our most potent medicine. ! Various clinical studies have concluded that proper nutri - tion plays a central role in disease prevention and the restoration of health. ! Studies on the naturally occurring pharmacological properties in food (nutraceuticals and phytonutrients) show a wealth of evidence to support the fact that our diets can nourish as well as heal us. Whole food nutrition allows the body to use its built-in restorative ability and will assist the body's capacity to heal itself. There is an abundance of documented evidence and research on people the world over heal - ing themselves using nutritional therapies. Cancer, arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illnesses have been successfully treated by allowing the cells to detoxify and subse - quently delivering nutrients to the cells of the body with wholesome life giving foods. If poor nutrition and an accumulation of toxins initiates disease in the body. Then the re - verse must also be true. In understanding that the body works both ways, it makes sense to conclude that the prevention is the same as the cure ( Andrew Saul, Phd ). We believe that awareness and education are the first steps in addressing our health prob - lems as grave or simple as they may be. Improving how we eat and our habits of lifestyle is one of the most critical things we can do in improving the quality of our life immediately and into the future as we age. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Part 1 - Detoxification In much the same way you need a holiday from work, your body needs a break from time to time, especially when you are feeling tired, sick, heavy or just plain run down. Detoxification is a normal process within the body as it neutralizes and eliminates toxins through the major organs such as our colon, liver, kidneys, lungs, lymph and skin. Our bodies do it naturally every day, in fact it is one of our most basic automatic functions. But what if our self-cleaning system is overloaded by our unhealthy lifestyle and exposure to environmental toxins? According to many healing experts detoxification through special cleansing programs may be the missing link to disease prevention, especially for immune-deficiency diseases like cancer, arthritis, diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome and candida. Our chemical-laden diet, with an overabundance of animal protein, too much saturated fat and too much caffeine and alcohol radically alters our internal ecosystem. However even if your diet is good, a cleanse can re - store your immune system and protect yourself against environmental toxins that pave the way for disease bearing bacteria, viruses and parasites. In the animal kingdom and in traditional cultures routine fasting which allows the body time to clean itself out has been normal practice. Just think how many showers you take in a year to clean the outside of your body and then how many cleanses you do in a year to clean the in - side of your body? Do You Need to Detox? Here is a little checklist we like to use to see if you’re in need of a detox: Do you feel bloated, constipated and congested? Have you gained unwanted pounds even though you are not eating more food? Do you feel tired and low in energy? (signs of an acidic diet) Has your digestion worsened? (a sign your body isn’t absorbing its nutrients well) Is your hair and skin looking not as healthy as it used to? Do you frequently get mouth sores, yeast infections, urinary tract infections, un - usual allergies? Do you feel foggy and out of sorts? Do you feel like you need to clear the cobwebs from your brain? If you have ticked yes to three or more of the above then a detox might be just what your body needs to regain balance. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The 3 Day Detox Although 7 to 10 days allows the most time for your body to really begin the detoxification process properly we’ve found that most people can only manage up to 3 days if they have a busy lifestyle. If you can do 7 days that’s great, if you can do 10 days that’s even better, if you can only do 1 day than that is better than none. However, we recommend that if you at least commit to 3 days you will begin to see the real value in detoxification. So what are the benefits? ✓ You eliminate stored wastes and for some that means they will lose weight ✓ Improved vitality and energy levels right away ✓ Improved circulation through purifying the liver, kidneys and blood ✓ Enhanced mental clarity ✓ You will turn around bad eating habits and your stomach will have the chance to re - duce to a normal size for weight control ✓ People with heart problems notice a more regular heartbeat www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"✓ A fiber rich cleansing diet with sea vegetables, that eliminates meat and dairy protein, almost invariably reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (the single largest cause of death) There are many different detoxification products and programs on the market however we believe that a program that is not too extreme and one that does not leave you starving is one which is most achievable and easiest to commit to. At the end of the day a program which is easy and effective is better than a program which is difficult and ineffective. Incorporating the principals of a macrobiotic brown rice cleanse and a vegetable juice cleanse results in a fiber rich cleansing detox which leaves you feeling clean and satisfied. This 3 day cleanse is a great way to assist the transition from an unhealthy diet to a healthy one. The cleanse uses brown rice as a nutrient building food, and vegetable juices as con - centrated cleansers. Brown rice is high in potassium, natural iodine and other minerals, so most people notice improvement in their hair, skin texture and nail growth. Brown rice is also high in fiber which helps to sweep the bowels from accumulated wastes. Sea greens help to boost weight loss and deter cellulite build up and help to balance thyroid function, which aids in metabolizing fat. Vegetable juices help to deliver concentrated enzymes and nutrients di - rectly to the cells of the body which assist in the detoxification process. The Program On Rising Take a large glass and add the juice of 1 lemon and crush a thumbnail size piece of fresh ginger. Fill the rest of the glass with filtered water at room temperature. Before breakfast Prepare a Green Drink: Mix wheatgrass or barley grass powder and filtered water to make a green drink to alkalize and energize the cells of your body and accelerate the cleansing process. It will taste a little different to start with but as your bloodstream PH levels balance out your taste buds will adjust to the flavor. Follow the recommended serving size on the la - bel. Breakfast ‘Break your Fast’ with a fresh vegetable juice of 4 medium size carrots, 1 beetroot, 1 cucum - ber, 1 handful of baby spinach, # cup parsley. Take 1000 mg of Vitamin C and 2 x 1000 mg flax seed oil capsules. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Between Breakfast and Lunch Have a caffeine-free detoxifying tea of peppermint, ginseng, licorice root, ginger or chamomile or a special natural laxative tea. Drink more green drinks as you need it! Lunch Have a small to medium serving of brown rice with a mixture of raw and steamed vegetables (choose from broccoli, shiitake mushroom, bok choy, radish, arugula (rocket) leaves, spring onion, watercress, garlic and ginger) season with sea greens and flavor with 1 cup of miso soup or lemon juice and extra virgin olive. Take 1 x 1000 mg of Vitamin C. Mid-Afternoon Have another vegetable juice of carrot, apple and ginger to boost your energy levels. Early Dinner Have a freshly squeezed vegetable juice of 2 carrots, 2 tomatoes, handful of spinach leaves, 2 celery stalks, $ cucumber, $ red bell pepper (capsicum). Add one tablespoon of wheat - grass or barley grass powder. Take 1 x 1000 mg of Vitamin C. Before Bed Relax your body with a detoxifying tea of peppermint, lemon balm, licorice root, ginger or chamomile tea or fresh mint and green tea with cardamom pods. There you have it! Follow this program as closely as possible for a minimum of 3 days to really see the results. You can experiment with the vegetable juices throughout the day but just make sure you are not adding too many sweet fruits (ideally none at all) as these add to the sugar (acidic) load placed on the body which is what we are trying to avoid during this cleanse. If you get unbearably hungry then snack on a handful of almonds. You may also alternate the vegetable juice for lunch with a vegetable soup if desired (if you live in a cold climate then this will feel better). Throughout the detox you will notice that after the second day your body will be getting used to the routine and will not get such cravings. Most of all stick with it and the results will soon follow. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Healthy Lifestyle Suggestions Along with the detox program outlined above, all of the suggestions below will aid the body’s natural detoxification processes and also boost your mood and energy levels. Try some of the options listed below during your cleanse and you will feel so good that you will want to incor - porate them into your new healthy lifestyle. ✓ Go for a brisk 60 minute walk at a place you feel most pleasant such as the beach or a nice park. ✓ Go for a swim for 30 minutes. ✓ Use the sauna or steam room after exercising to increase circulation and to assist the elimination process through the skin. ✓ Before your main meal of the day try a 30 minute to 1 hour yoga session. A couple of sun salutations followed by a shoulder stand which stimulates the thyroid gland and regulates metabolism or at least a few simple stretches. ✓ Take 10 deep breaths 3 times a day to the following ratio: Inhale for a count of 4, hold for 8 and exhale for 16 (using your diaphragm so your stomach sticks out as you in - hale). As you exhale visualize the exhale to be a detoxifying breath. ✓ Before you hop in the shower do 5 minutes of skin brushing for your whole body. Use small strokes from your feet up. This increases circulation and helps break down fatty deposits. Use a soft bristled skin brush. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"✓ Get a massage: any type is good to get the blood flowing however a lymph draining massage is ideal during a detox. ✓ Take a steamy bath and exfoliate your body with a loofah or add clay to the water. ✓ Begin the day with 5 minutes of meditation. Sit quietly and focus on your breathing. Visualize your body detoxifying itself, with every breath in, visualize healthy oxygen en - tering your lungs and bloodstream and with every breath out visualize the toxins leave the body. ✓ Avoid coffee, black teas, alcohol, smoking and sweets. Sip on green tea or lemon wa - ter to help fire up the liver’s waste elimination process. ✓ Eliminate your consumption of meat and dairy for the cleanse period and reduce con - sumption thereafter. ✓ Drink at least 2 liters of filtered water (preferably with wheatgrass or barley grass pow - der) each day to help flush the system. It is important not to drink water with meals as it dilutes the digestive enzymes thereby slowing the process of assimilation of nutri - ents. Drink water 30 minutes before eating and then allow one hour or more after - wards before drinking again. ✓ Use all natural body care products including natural toothpaste, body lotion and de - odorant (no sodium laurel sulfate, no aluminum and no fluoride). Our rule is that if you can’t eat it then you shouldn’t be putting it on your body. ✓ For those that are willing to try something new – schedule a colonic (colon irrigation) with a certified, licensed Colon Hydrotherapist. Professional health clinics will offer colonic irrigation for an affordable price. A colonic session will help to remove the mu - coid plaque found building up on the walls of your colon. Some people notice their stomach area will appear more flattened. If a colonic does not appeal to you but you would still like to help cleanse the colon then you can give yourself an enema at home. Most chemists or drug stores will sell enema kits which will help to clear out your bowels. Make sure you take a high quality probiotic supplement after any enema or colonic. This will help to replace any good bacteria lost from your colon cleanse. Your colonic hydrotherapist or health food store nutritionist or naturopath will be able to ad - vise you on this. ✓ If you’re not up for a colonic or enema then we can suggest an oral detox program which will help clean out the colon, please visit www.DrNatura.com for more informa - tion.

Fruits and vegetables are at their most healthful state when they are eaten raw and fresh from the earth. What most people don’t know is that heat destroys more than 85% of the nutrients and totally kills off the enzymes. When you eat cooked foods your body must call on its own \"enzyme bank\" in order to digest food; which explains why after eating a cooked meal many people feel heavy, tired, and lacking in energy. ! The constant depletion of the body's enzymes by eating primarily cooked foods is the precursor to disease and the degenerative conditions we have come to consider a normal part of getting older. Adding more raw foods to your diet helps restore vitality and the \"life-force\" energy to the entire system. ! What are enzymes? Enzymes make everything work in our bodies, without them we would be a pile of lifeless at - oms. Enzymes form the catalyst for all the chemical reactions in the body – digestion, immu - nity and all other metabolic and re-generative functions. Think of them as the body’s work - horses helping you to walk, talk, breath, digest food and operate. Chemically they drive the metabolism to use the nutrients we take in. Biologically, they are our life energy. The Three categories of enzymes Metabolic enzymes occur naturally in the body and act as catalysts enabling us to see, hear, feel, move and think. Metabolic Enzymes speed up the chemical reaction within the cells for detoxification and energy production. Digestive enzymes are produced by our bodies. They are in charge of breaking down the food we eat and assimilating all the nutrients. If we eat a diet of predominantly cooked and processed foods we overload our pancreas to produce more digestive enzymes. If the pan - creas is too weak and no longer able to secrete enzymes, it will rob other organs of life-giving enzymes. Once this happens our simple daily tasks become difficult. Food enzymes come from the food we eat. All fruit and vegetables come equipped with their own enzymes needed to digest them. The foods with the highest food enzymes are mango, papaya, banana, pineapple and avocado. At birth we are born a full deposit of enzymes. Think of this as your “enzyme bank account”. If we do not make regular deposits to this account from raw foods rich in enzymes and we continue to eat cooked foods that use up our enzyme supply, we become more susceptible to aging, disease and premature death. Without the proper enzymes to break down the foods we eat we begin to accumulate undi - gested materials in our system. This leads to weight gain, inflammation, stagnation, digestive disorders and fatigue. Enzyme depletion, lack of energy and disease all go hand in hand. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"What is Raw? Raw foods include any natural food which has not been heated above 48 degrees Celsius or 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Common heating processes include frying, boiling, grilling, steam - ing, BBQ’ing, microwaving and even pasteurization. Just about every processed, canned, packaged and convenience food has been heat treated ‘for our safety’ to prolong its shelf life but reduce ours. Now that we understand the benefits of increasing your intake of raw fruits, vegetables and sprouts, whenever you do eat cooked food, make the meal as healthy as possible and bal - ance it out with a crunchy salad, fresh juice or fresh smoothie. You can aim to drink at least 1 glass of vegetable juice or blend a green superfood smoothie with any cooked meal. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Fresh Coconut Whole young coconut Meat Cleaver/ Chef’s Knife Method: Look for a whole young coconut with the husk trimmed off so it sits flat with a pointed top. To open these coconuts use a meat cleaver or a chef’s knife is your best bet. Lay the coconut on its side, securing it so it won’t roll. Use the knife to remove the small layer of husk around the pointy end of the coconut. Set the coconut upright. Hold the knife high and bring it down sharply near the top of the coconut (Be very careful to aim for the pointy tip). The knife should sink into the shell, breaking through the inner shell. Rotate the coconut around and repeat the action, until the top cap of the coconut shell comes off. Now drain the coconut water into a bowl. The opening should be big enough to get a spoon into the coconut to get the flesh out. The flesh will range from soft to firm. Scoop the flesh out with a spoon and eat right away or blend for use in a smoothie. Young Coconut Water: Young coconuts are one of the highest sources of electrolytes in nature and scientists have discovered that the molecular structure of coconut water is identi - cal to human blood plasma (David Wolfe, Eating for beauty). Our blood is made up of 55% plasma and 45% hemoglobin. Ingesting coconut water is like giving your body an instant blood transfusion. In fact, during World War II in the Pacific, both sides in the conflict regularly used coconut water, siphoned directly from the coconut, to give emergency plasma transfu - sions to wounded soldiers. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Fresh Juices Think of juices as liquid vitamin supplements, only better tasting. They are nutrition in its most concentrated form, we call it the FedEx of foods - a delivery service that gets the nutrients to the cells in half the time. Juices give the body a break from digestion, which is why they are great for cleansing. If there is one thing that has the most positive and immediate impact on your health it’s starting your day with an organic green juice. Juicing can be messy and time consuming but the rewards are long lasting.

Spiralize (using a spiralizer) zucchini into pasta ribbons and place in a large serving bowl. 2. For the sauce, place remaining ingredients in a food processor/blender until smooth. 3. To serve place the zucchini ribbons into bowls and pour the raw sauce over the top, just like a bowl of pasta. Tomatoes: Along with its many vitamins, minerals and antioxidant qualities the tomato contains lycopene. Studies show lycopene prevents prostate cancer and heart disease. Lycopene is the substance in plants which protects them from the sun’s UV rays, it does the same in our bodies, kind of like a natural sunscreen. Yes it’s true that some tomato sauces and canned tomatoes also contain this protective quality but fresh is still best. Olive Oil: Extra Virgin Cold Pressed olive oil is one of the highest natural sources of Vitamin E. This nutrient has been known to erase fine lines on the face, repair connective tissues, repair the circulatory system and soothe the digestive tract. In many studies olive oil has also been shown to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, our two biggest killers. No wonder the Mediterranean diet is so beneficial. Sea Salt: Sea Salt is our friend, it is packed with nutrition containing more than 80 minerals, including calcium. The sodium in salt is necessary for brain function and for balancing our system. However, getting sodium from table salt or sodium found in canned, preserved and highly processed foods is damaging as it lacks a complete array of minerals. Table salt has a bad reputation because it has been dried at scorching temperatures, chemically bleached and then often enriched with iodine. It’s a similar story for rock salt and kosher salt. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Pesto Mushrooms Serves 2 20 button mushrooms or 4 Portobello mushrooms 1 cup walnuts 1/2 cup pine nuts 3 cups basil 1/2 cup olive oil 2-3 cloves of garlic 1 teaspoon of sea salt 2 tablespoons of lemon juice Substitutes: You can use arugula (rocket) leaves to fill out the basil if you are short. Method: 1. Wash and remove the stem from the mushrooms and lay out on a serving plate. 2. Place all remaining ingredients in a food processor or blender and blend until smooth. 3. Fill the mushrooms with pesto and serve fresh. Mushrooms: Mushrooms are one of the best natural sources of niacin which is essential for energy production, brain function and the skin. It also helps in balancing blood sugar levels and lowering cholesterol. Nuts and Seeds: Contrary to popular belief fat is essential to health and even to weight loss. Not all fats are equal however. Nuts, seeds and their cold pressed oils should be included in your diet on a regular basis as they contain high levels of the essential fatty acids (EFA’s), or good fats. Nuts are also a powerhouse of nutrients and contain high forms of digestible protein, antioxidant Vitamins A,B,C and E, calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, selenium and manganese. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Black Olive Tapenade Makes 3 cups 3 cups of pitted black olives 1/2 cup olive oil 1 small handful parsley (optional) 2 tablespoons lemon juice 3 cloves garlic 1 teaspoon sea salt Method: 1. Process everything except olives in a blender or food processor until smooth. 2. Add olives and pulse until olives are roughly chopped. 3. To serve: use as a dip with flax seed crackers (see the recipe in the ‘Superfoods and Sprouting’ chapter). Olives: Olives and olive oil are in very rich in antioxidants. Antioxidants deactivate free radicals allowing us to live longer, overcome illness and maintain more acute mental and muscular faculties. Olives display anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties and are used in a detoxifying diet. Garlic: Garlic contains high doses of natural sulphur (MSM). MSM provides elasticity, movement, healing and repair within the tissues. It greatly enhances the structural integrity of connective tissue and joint cartilage and has been shown to reverse arthritic conditions including pain and inflammation. MSM is renowned as a beautifying nutrient, the best natural food cosmetic in the world. MSM, through its ability to continuously build and rebuild perfect collagen and keratin is able to make our hair, nails and skin shine with radiance. You can buy MSM on its own which we recommend as a supplement to a healthy diet (the powder tastes very bitter) so we suggest trying it in capsules. Parsley: Parsley is a nutrient powerhouse containing more Vitamin C than citrus fruit. It even contains Vitamin B12, mostly thought to be only bioavailable in dairy and meat products. B12 is also available in blue green algae and Spirulina and is normally synthesized in the intestine when an abundance of healthy bacteria is present. B12 is needed by the body for making use of protein and helps the blood carry oxygen. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Open Faced Guacamole and Cos with Marinated Mushrooms Serves 4 8 button mushrooms or 4 Portobello mushrooms 1/2 cup tamari (wheat free soy sauce) or soy sauce 1/2 red onion sliced in rings 1 handful cos (Romaine) lettuce 1 zucchini, julienned 1 carrot, julienned Guacamole 2 avocados 2 tablespoons of lime juice 2 tablespoons of olive oil 1 teaspoon of sea salt 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 cup dill or cilantro (coriander) (optional) 1/4 cup red onion Method: 1.

Onion: Onions contain high concentrations of sulphur (MSM) which stimulate the mucus lining of the stomach and digestive organs. Cutting up onions, as we know, can sometimes lead to tears. Internally this stimulating oil increases the flow of digestive juices creating a greater absorption of nutrients. Because of their high sulphur content, onions are beautifying foods as they cleanse the liver and skin, release antiseptic compounds and help to rebuild connective tissue. An age old remedy suggests a mixture of onion juice and honey on infected wounds for rapid healing. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Berry Ice Cream with Raw Chocolate Sauce Serves 4 3 frozen bananas 1 1/2 cups of frozen mixed berries 1 vanilla pod or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 tablespoons raw honey Sauce $ cup hazelnuts 2 tablespoons raw cacao powder 1 tablespoon agave or 1/4 teaspoon stevia to sweeten 2 tablespoons of tahini (sesame seed paste) Pinch sea salt 2 tablespoons extra virgin coconut oil 1/2 cup of warm water 1/2 cup ice www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Method: 1 Blend the bananas, mixed berries, honey and vanilla in a high speed blender. 2.

Berries: Berries (strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, blackberry) are very high in antioxidants (Vitamins A,C,E and selenium). For example, one strawberry is higher in Vitamin C than one orange. Antioxidants fight against free radicals in your body thus giving you better protection against diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Berries contain many phytonutrients that boost the immune system. Best of all, berries have a low glycemic index (GI) which means they create sustained slow releasing energy as opposed to creating a spike in your blood sugar levels which is often associated with weight gain. Stevia: Stevia is an all natural sugar alternative. The stevia leaf is from a plant found in South America. Most notably it is 300 times sweeter than sugar but does not affect your blood sugar levels in the same way sugar does. It is thus a wonderful addition to the pantry, especially anyone suffering from diabetes, candida yeast infections or gum disease. Because of its potency the saying “a little, goes a long way” definitely applies here. Stevia is effective for weight control because not only does it not affect your blood sugar levels it also contains no calories. Other benefits of this amazing herb include decreased tooth decay, improved mental alertness and improved digestion. Stevia comes in powdered form or in a liquid form. The powdered form is preferred as it comes in packets and has a milder taste. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Superfoods and Sprouts Why Superfoods? Superfoods are a category of foods found in nature; they are superior sources of essential nutrients - nutrients we need but cannot make ourselves. We all may be adding more salads and vegetables to our diets, but concern for the quality of foods grown in mineral depleted soils makes superfoods a wise choice. They are nutritionally more potent than regular foods and are wonderful source of antioxidants for healthy healing. “Superfoods are the most powerful nutrient-dense foods on the planet and have virtually no calories, no bad fats or harmful substances. Thus they are powerhouses for any transformation to a slender more healthier you.” - Gillian McKeith, You Are What You Eat Superfoods can be divided into 5 main groups 1. Green Superfoods 2. Bee Superfoods 3. Seaweed Superfoods 4. Herb Superfoods 5. Fruit and Nut Superfoods www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Green Superfoods Greens are good for you but green superfoods are even better! Green Superfoods have the highest concentrations of easily digestible nutrients, fat burning compounds, vitamins and minerals to protect and heal the body. They contain a wide array of beneficial substances including proteins, protective phytochemicals and healthy bacteria helping you to build cleaner muscles and tissues, aid your digestive system function and more effectively protect you against disease and illness. Green superfoods are extremely rich in chlorophyll – the pigment that gives plants their green color. The molecular structure of chlorophyll is very similar to that of human blood and studies show that when this is consumed, the production of hemoglobin in blood is increased. Higher amounts of hemoglobin in the bloodstream means more oxygen-rich blood, the first and most important element that cells need to thrive. The Grasses Wheatgrass - Wheatgrass is the sprouted grass of a wheat seed. Unlike the whole grain, because it has been sprouted, it does not contain gluten or other common allergic agents. Wheatgrass is super-alkalizing and is excellent for promoting healthy blood. It normalizes the thyroid gland to stimulate the metabolism thus assisting digestion and promoting weight loss due to its high enzyme content and cleansing effect. Barley grass - Barley grass has 11 times more calcium than cow’s milk, 5 times more iron than spinach and 7 times more Vitamin C and bioflavonoids than orange juice. It contains significant amounts of Vitamin B12 which is very important in a vegetarian diet. Barley grass juice has anti-viral activities and neutralizes heavy metals like mercury in the blood. The Algae’s Wild blue-green algae - Algae was the first form of life on earth and its power is immense. Wild blue-green algae is a phytoplankton and contains virtually every nutrient known. With a 60% protein content and a more complete amino acid profile then beef or soy beans. It contains one of the best know food sources of beta carotene, B vitamins and chlorophyll. It can help you think more clearly, improve your memory, strengthen your immune system and combat viruses, colds and flu. Spirulina - Spirulina is a cultivated micro-algae which has been consumed for thousands of years by the indigenous people in Mexico and Africa. It is one of the highest known protein sources on earth as it contains 70% complete protein in comparison to steak which consists of only 25% protein once cooked. Studies have shown that Spirulina can help control blood sugar levels and cravings thus making it a key food for diabetics. Spirulina can be used to www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"assist in weight loss and is recommended as a general nutritional supplement in a healthy diet regime. Chlorella - Chlorella is a fresh water algae and like its other algae cousins contains a complete protein profile, all the B vitamins, Vitamin C and E and many minerals. It is amazing for the immune system and for reducing cholesterol and preventing the hardening of arteries, which is a precursor to heart attacks and strokes. Green Leafy Vegetables - Green leafy vegetables are so readily available and so highly nutritious, however most people do not eat enough of them. Recent studies continuously confirm that populations that eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables run a far lower risk of heart disease and cancer. Fresh raw green leafy vegetables contain high doses of chlorophyll, easily digestible proteins, enzymes and a wide range of vitamins and minerals. These vegetables act as mini-transfusions for the blood, a health tonic for the brain and immune system and a cleanser of the kidneys. Try any of the following: arugula (rocket), spinach, dandelion greens, kale, watercress, parsley, lettuce, endive, chicory, broccoli sprouts and mustard sprouts. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Bee Superfoods The Egyptians wrote about the healing components of bee products back in 5500 B.C. People from India have used it since 1000 B.C. in their religious ceremonies. And even the Babylonians have been noted to use it in their medicinal practices. The western world actually discovered the benefits of bee superfoods by accident during an investigation of native Russian Beekeepers who regularly lived past 100 years of age who ate raw honey, rich in bee pollen, everyday. \"If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years of life left. No more bees, no more pollination, no more plants, no more animals, no more man.\" !!!!!!!! - Albert Einstein Royal Jelly - Royal Jelly is a milk-like secretion from the head glands of the worker bees. The Queen Bee lives almost exclusively on royal jelly and she lives around 40 times longer than the rest of the bees. Royal Jelly is a powerhouse of nutrients containing every nutrient necessary to support life. It is the world’s richest source of panothenic acid (Vitamin B5), which is known to combat stress, fatigue and insomnia and is a vital nutrient for healthy skin and hair. Bee Pollen - Bee pollen is collected by bees from flowering plants and formed into granules. Bee pollen is the one of the most complete foods found in nature and has 5 to 7 times more protein than beef. It is especially beneficial for the extra nutritional and energy needs of athletes and those recovering from an illness. It is a natural antidote for fighting allergies, particularly hay fever and sinusitis. Research shows that bee pollen counteracts the signs of aging and increases both mental and physical capability. Propolis - Propolis is the substance that bees coat the walls of their hives with and bee hives have often been referred to as the most antiseptic places in nature. The powerful antibiotic properties of propolis help to protect humans against bacteria and strengthen the immune system. Propolis works against viruses, something that antibiotics cannot do. Research shows that taking propolis during high risk ‘cold and flu’ seasons reduces colds, coughing and inflammation of the mouth, tonsils and throat. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Seaweed Superfoods Seaweeds are the most nutritionally dense plants on the planet as they have access to all the nutrients in the ocean. They can contain up to 10 times more calcium than milk and 8 times more protein than beef. The chemical composition of seaweeds is so close to human blood plasma, that perhaps their greatest benefit is regulating and purifying our blood system. They help to alkalize our blood, neutralizing the over acid effects of our modern diet and protect us from a wide array of toxic elements in the environment, including heavy metals, pollutants and radiation by-products converting them to harmless salts that the body can then eliminate. But the most remarkable results with seaweeds we see in boosting weight loss and deterring cellulite build up. The high concentration of natural iodine help to stimulate the thyroid gland so that food fuels are used before they can be turned into fatty deposits. At the same time, the minerals act like electrolytes to break the chemical bond that seals the fat cells allowing trapped wastes to escape. Both by eating sea vegetables or bathing in them helps reduce cellulite and stimulates lymphatic drainage. Seaweeds have been part of the Asian diet for thousands of years. Studies in Japan show that a diet containing as little as 5% seagreens inhibits cancer growths sometimes causing the remission of active tumors. Seaweeds are available in health food stores and Asian supermarkets. Try to incorporate them into your diet to boost nutrition and add flavor. Nori - Is best known for the seaweed used to make sushi rolls. You can make your own sushi at home by using untoasted nori rolls for maximum nutrient content. Cut up dried nori into pieces to add a salty flavor to your soups instead of using salt. Kelp - Is available in powder or capsule form for those who do not enjoy eating seaweed. It is also the most common seaweed found along the ocean shores. Due to their thick leaves they are perfect addition to a detoxifying seaweed bath. Dulse - A red seaweed, available in flakes. There is no need to cook or soak dulse. Use as a seasoning on salads, vegetables and soups instead of salt. Arame - Consists of brown stringy seaweed. Soak in hot water for 5 minutes before eating. Wakame - Has a sweet flavor makes a great accompaniment to sandwiches. Soak for 5 minutes in hot water. Kombu - Used in Japan for centuries as a mineral rich flavor enhancer. Add a strip of kombu when cooking beans to make them more digestible and as a carminative (reducing gas). Add a strip of kombu to your sprouts when soaking them to allow them to soak up the minerals. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Herb Superfoods Herbs as nourishment offer the body a whole host of nutrients it may not have received either because of poor diet or environmental deficiencies in the soil or air. Herbs as medicine are essentially body balancers that work with the body as it functions so that it can heal and regulate itself. Herbs have been used for centuries as part of the wisdom of natural healing methods. Herbs are best used in their whole form rather than isolating the effective plant constituents also known as the “active ingredients”. Since all body parts and most disease symptoms are interrelated, it is wise to use herbs which can affect each part of the problem. Nettle - the bowel mover. These plants are best known as stinging nettle plants. However, when the nettle leaves are dried and eaten the saliva neutralizes the sting. Nettles are incredibly effective in removing unwanted pounds. A cup of nettle tea in the morning is ideal to get things going in the bowel department. The nettle leaves increase the thyroid function, increase metabolism and releases mucus in the colon allowing for the flushing of excess wastes. Aloe vera - Aloe vera is a perennial succulent that grows in a wide range of climates and seems to do best in tropical and sub-tropical areas. It has been deemed a superfood after research studies identifying its seventy-five healing compounds including natural steroids, antibiotic agents, amino acids, minerals and enzymes. Aloe Vera has been used since Egyptian times as a skin moisturizer, and healer for burns, cuts, bruises, acne and eczema. This is mostly due to the high concentration of natural sulphur (MSM) that it contains. Aloe juice alkalizes the digestive tract preventing over-acidity, a common cause of indigestion, acid reflux, heartburn and ulcers. Echinacea - Echinacea is a household name when it comes to warding off colds and flu. This herb is used as a natural antibiotic and immune system stimulator, helping to build up resistance. The reason for its effectiveness is because of its ability to stimulate the lymph flow in the body. Lymph runs parallel with our bloodstream and carries toxins out of the body. Consume in liquid or capsule form for 2-3 week periods during “high risk” flu season. The tea from this herb has also grown in popularity for treating infections and cancers such as skin cancer. Ginseng - Ginseng is the quintessential herb for handling stress. This ancient healing herb has been widely used throughout Asia as an energizing tonic. This special herb is particularly beneficial when recovering from an illness or surgery due to its restorative and anti-infection properties. It promotes regeneration from stress and fatigue. Drink as a tea daily or consume in a capsule form. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Fruit and Nut Superfoods Free radicals may sound a little like an extremest terrorist group evading capture and wreaking havoc across the globe and in fact within the context of your body you would be right. They are in part a natural occurrence through normal metabolism however an extra and unnecessary free radical load can be put on our bodies by external factors including pollution, cigarette smoke, radiation, burnt and deep fried foods and cooked foods. The best way to combat free radicals in our system is by increasing our intake of foods with high antioxidant properties. When antioxidants react with free radicals their destructive properties are eliminated. Antioxidants are naturally occurring chemicals in foods. They include vitamins A, C and E, carotenoids such as beta-carotene, some minerals, phenolic compounds and other naturally occurring chemicals. Fruit and nut superfoods are not only nutrient dense but have very high antioxidant properties. Goji Berries - Goji berries are grown on vines in the protected valleys of inner Mongolia and Tibet. The distinctively flavored red berries are a very rich source of Vitamin C, having 500 times more Vitamin C per ounce than oranges. They are a superb source of Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6 and E and contain a full complement of protein with 18 amino acids and 21 trace minerals. Most of all they are an excellent antioxidant, making it an ideal natural whole food for reversing aging and protecting against disease. Raw Cacao - For this nut we could easily dedicate a whole page, if not a book. A word of warning before we start however, most cocoa powder and commercial chocolate is processed via the “Dutch method” meaning it is subjected to scorching temperatures of up to 150°C with the additional aid of chemical solvents which destroy most of the nutrients and antioxidants. Be sure to attain certified organic raw cacao in a powder, nib or whole bean form as the temperature will not have been allowed to exceed 40°C thus allowing all the heat- sensitive vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to remain intact. Raw cacao beans contain possibly the worlds most concentrated source of flavor compounds and antioxidants found in any food. Cacao is extremely high in magnesium which has been found to be the most common deficient mineral lacking in most people despite following a balanced diet – it is estimated that over 80% of Australians are chronically lacking this important mineral. Cacao beans are also one of the best snack foods for those looking to shed the extra weight as they contain very few calories, are satisfying and are natural appetite suppressors. For those concerned about not getting enough iron it should be pleasing to know that one small 28 gram serving of raw cacao beans gives 314% of the recommended daily allowance of iron. And if that’s not enough raw cacao beans have an antioxidant score (ORAC) of 95,500. To put that into perspective, that’s 14 times more antioxidant flavonoids than red wine, 21 times more than green tea, and 7 times more than even dark chocolate! Who would have ever thought that chocolate could be so healthy. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Maca - Maca powder is from the Maca root, a flavorful ancient superfood from Peru. Maca has been cultivated for at least 2000 years and consumed by Inca Warriors to increase strength and endurance. It is a highly nutritious food that has been used traditionally to gain increased energy, promote sexual desire, support fertility and enhance immune system function. It continues today to be a significant staple food and medicinal plant for the Peruvian people and is now widely available the world over as a whole food supplement. Acai - Acai berries have long been a main staple in the diet of tribes within the Amazon. This berry has the appearance of a purple grape and the taste of a tropical berry and has been shown to have powerful antioxidant properties due to a high level of anthocyanins, pigments also found in red wine. The ORAC rating of Acai is 1,027. Make sure to look for the freeze- dried Acai fruit in which the nutrients are kept intact or when buying the juice ensure it’s a brand that has not been pasteurized. Coconuts & Coconut Oil - Young coconuts are one of the highest sources of electrolytes in nature. Electrolytes are ionized salts in our cells that transport energy throughout the body. Through perspiration we can easily deplete our electrolyte supply making us feel tired and weak. We can replenish them by drinking fluids high in electrolytes, like coconut water, which is a much better alternative to commercial sports drinks laden with artificial sugars and colors. The molecular structure of coconut water is identical to human blood plasma, which means that it is immediately recognized by the body and put to good use. Drinking the juice from a young coconut is like giving your body an instant blood transfusion. In fact, this was a common practice during World War II in the Pacific, where both sides in the conflict regularly used coconut water, siphoned directly from the coconut, to give emergency transfusions to wounded soldiers. Coconut oil's saturated fat is of the medium-chain fatty acid variety, which are digested more easily and utilized differently by the body than other saturated fats (like butter, meat and eggs). Whereas other saturated fats are stored in the body's cells, the medium chain fatty acids in coconut oil are sent directly to the liver where they are immediately converted into energy. Coconut oil will actually speed up metabolism so your body will burn more calories in a day which will contribute to weight loss. Coconut oil is primarily composed of Lauric acid, with concentrations of up to fifty-three percent (53%). Interestingly enough, the only other substance in nature that has a comparably rich composition of Lauric acid is mothers' milk. Studies show that this high Lauric acid content is beneficial in warding off and destroying viruses, bacteria and other pathogens. It also actively strengthens the body's immune system. Pacific islanders deem coconut oil to be the cure-all gift from nature for all illnesses. Cold pressed coconut oil has been used in India as a key ingredient in Ayurvedic medicine for over four thousand years and is still a primary form of medical treatment for millions of people. In South America, virgin coconut oil is drunk by the glass as a means of overcoming illness and speeding up recovery. It is used in hospitals around the world to treat digestive or malabsorption problems, and is commonly given to infants and children who have problems digesting other fats. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Coconut oil is the premier oil for cooking. It is much more stable than other vegetable oils under normal cooking temperatures and does not break down into free radicals as quickly as other vegetable oils. It is also naturally more resistant to rancidity and oxidation than other edible oils. As with all oils, the ‘Extra Virgin Cold Pressed’ type is superior because of its processing at low heat thereby retaining all of the nutrients and protective health properties within the oil. Noni - This fruit has been used by Polynesian islanders as a regenerative medicine for more than 1500 years. Research documents that the noni fruit has astounding anti-bacterial properties, even against E-coli. It has anti-tumor activity, anti-inflammatory properties, is effective as a pain reliever, generates cell repair and strengthens the immune system. Noni contains a multitude of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, co-enzymes, plant sterols, antioxidants, phytonutrients and bioflavonoids. Many believe that the synergistic effect of the multi- spectrum nutrients is what gives it its potency. It has been proven beneficial for colds and flu, digestive disorders, skin disorders, pain relief, headaches, infections and more. Noni has gained worldwide popularity and has become widely available.

Sprouts are the most concentrated form of living foods. They are the young seedlings germinated from the seed of almost any living vegetation. ! Essentially any seed or bean with the genetic makeup to reproduce has the potential to be sprouted. !! Some of the most common sprouts are alfalfa, wheatgrass, barley grass, mung bean, soy bean, chickpea, aduki bean, radish, lentil, sunflower seed, fenugreek, buckwheat, quinoa, corn, oats, green peas and ! lima ! beans to name just a few. ! ! Why Sprout? Sprouting is the process of soaking, then germinating and eventually eating the growing live seedling. Think about this, when you eat a sprout, you are eating the life force energy that is needed to create a full grown healthy plant. When you soak a seed in water and place it in the sunlight it will begin the sprouting process and the seeds’ natural enzymes are released. Even though nuts and seeds are raw, their enzymes still lie dormant so when you eat them the body will have to draw on its own enzyme reserves to break them down. Fortunately the process of soaking the seeds activates their enzymes and deems them as living. ! ! Upon soaking, the seed absorbs the water and swells to at least twice its size. Not only does it swell in size but it swells in nutrient content. ! The eventual germination process effectively pre-digests the seed; complex carbohydrates and proteins contained within the seed are converted into easily digestible forms so there is less likelihood of food allergies. What results is a highly nutrient dense superfood with high levels of protein, vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, fiber and enzymes in the most digestible form, even vitamin B12 which is difficult to find in plant sources. Sprouting can be lots of fun. ! All you need is a glass jar, some seeds or beans, filtered water and a cheesecloth. You can also buy a sprout kit available from a health food store – this is a miniature sprout farm, with a three tiered growing tray. ! Sprouts and Their Uses Adding sprouts to your diet is an easy way to gain energy, vitality and health all year round.

Wheatgrass juice, heralded by Dr. Ann Wigmore for its healing properties, was used in her clinic where she was treating seriously ill patients. Essentially wheatgrass is the young grass from the sprouted wheat berry. High in minerals, protein, enzymes and Vitamins A, B- complex, C, E and K, it is a vital component to rebuilding the immune system.

Omega 3, which is also found in other nuts and seeds and some fish species, helps to improve brain function, vision, coordination and mood. Flax seeds are high in fiber and help to sweep the bowels and prevent constipation. Smart animals - from parrots to humans - eat seeds. Here’s a top tip to make sure you have your daily seeds: Fill a glass jar with an airtight lid half full with flax seeds and half with a combination of sesame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds.

Macrobiotic as translated from Greek means long life - \"macro\" (large, long) and \"bios\" (life). T he Macrobiotic way of life has been practiced by many of the ancient traditional cultures, such as the Incas and the Han Dynasty Chinese and is still followed today by many Asian cultures. The Macrobiotic way of life is m uch more than a diet. It is a philosophy that considers the seasons, climate and a person’s level of activity in determining how to eat. A macrobiotic diet encourages harmony in the body by living in accordance with nature. It is a realization that we create our health through our lifestyle choices. Macrobiotics emphasizes locally grown whole grain cereals , pulses , vegetables , seaweed s, fermented foods, and fruit s, combined into meals according to the principle of balance (known as yin and yang ). It constitutes foods low in saturated fat, non-mucus forming and rich in plant fiber and protein. It is alkalizing and nutrient rich. Below are outlined some major beliefs of a macrobiotic diet: 1. Organic and local whole foods whenever possible . This is often more of a chal - lenge than it may seem, because it means reading labels, changing shopping habits and finding new stores. One of the cornerstones of macrobiotics is eating with the seasons, so to remain in balance with our bodies own ecosystem. Luckily buying or - ganic, local foods also supports our local organic farming community ensuring ade - quate supply and in the long run cheaper prices. 2. Eliminating foods not suited to internal body balance . This means staying away from fried foods, highly processed and refined foods, chemical-laden foods with artifi - cial colors and preservatives. Avoiding white sugar and cutting down on sweet tropical fruits. Eliminate soft drinks and caffeine. Avoiding most animal protein with the excep - tion of wild fish and seafood. Avoiding dairy products with the exception of fermented dairy i.e. yogurt and kefir for its healing probiotic properties. 3. Preparing foods in their whole form . This is harder for those people that are so used to cooking with pre-prepared foods. It means buying fresh foods and preparing them in a simple way to keep all the nutrients intact. For example with grains, try to use grains in their whole form and avoiding the refined grains like pasta, white bread or white rice. www.FOODMATTERS.tv"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"4. Chew your food carefully and eat with intention . Chewing is highly important in a high fiber, high grain based diet. Grains are acidic by nature, however mixed with our saliva, which is alkaline, it counteracts the acidity. Chewing is also an integral part of the digestive process. Digestion starts from the moment you place food in your mouth. Your saliva produces enzymes which help to break down the food. So the more you chew your food, the more you aid the digestive process. Grains – when preparing grains try to use the whole grain rather than the refined grain. Avoid the processed white flours contained in pastas, and white bread. Use brown rice instead of white rice as white rice is missing the husk which is the nutritious and fibrous part. Experiment with quinoa, whole wheat, oats, barley, millet, buckwheat, amaranth, spelt, corn and rye. Vegetables and Fruits – These can be raw or cooked. Raw in salads and on their own. Or try lightly steaming them with olive oil and lemon juice or with sesame oil. Eat every color of the rainbow but the most alkalizing to the body are green colored varieties. Try having a fresh vegetable or fruit juice several times a week. With fruits its best to stick to those that are alkalizing in nature, like lemon, grapefruit, avocado, tomato, apricot, cantaloupe, kiwi, peaches, melons, red grapes, strawberries, blackberries or other berries in season . Go easy on the sweet tropical fruits and dried fruits which are high in enzymes and nutrients but are acidic in nature due to the concentrated sugar content and can be destructive in a healing diet. Beans - try black beans, chickpeas and lentils for protein. Also excellent are sprouted beans such as mung beans, chick peas, lentils, and aduki beans. Seagreens – Experiment with seagreens such as kombu, kelp dulse, nori and wakame. Add them to miso soup, salads and rice dishes. Seafood - If you are not a vegetarian, seafood is a great source of protein, B12 and omega 3 essential fatty acids. Its very important to source wild caught seafood as the toxicity levels in farmed fish can be harmful. Good choices are salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna, flounder, cod, sole and halibut. Try daily supplementing of cod liver or krill oil for an omega 3 essential fatty acid (EFA) boost.
