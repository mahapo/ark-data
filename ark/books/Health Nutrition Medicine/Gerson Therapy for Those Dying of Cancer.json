It is a remarkable fact that, according to the manner in which it is taken, it has two entirely different effects. If a diluted mixture of coffee is taken in an enema, it opens up the bile ducts so toxic sub- stances can be emptied out of the liver. For about 54 years, Dr. Max Gerson used coffee enemas to do this—and found no other side effects. Instead, he found that diluted coffee enemas would save lives, when nothing else would. “Where do we begin? The most important first step is the detoxification. So let us go into that. First we gave some different enemas. I found out that the best enema is the coffee enema as it was first used by Prof. O.A. Meyer in Goettingen. This idea occurred to him when, together with Prof. Heubner, he gave caffeine solution into the rectum of animals. He observed that the bile ducts were opened and more bile could flow . . “These patients who absorb the big tumor masses [from the tumor into the blood stream into the liver] are awakened with an alarm clock every night because they are otherwise poisoned by the absorption of these masses. If I give them only one or two or three enemas, they die of poisoning. I did not have the right as a physician to cause the body to absorb all the cancer masses and then not to detoxify enough. With two or three enemas they were not detoxified enough! They went into a coma hepaticum (liver coma). “Autopsies showed that the liver was poisoned. I learned from these disasters that you can’t give these patients too much detoxification . . When I didn’t give these patients the night enemas, they were drowsy and almost semi-conscious in the morning. The nurses confirmed this and told me that it takes a couple of enemas till they are free of this toxic state again. I cannot stress the detoxifi- cation enough. Even so with all these enemas, this was not enough! I had to also give them castor oil by mouth and by enema every other day, at least for the first week or so. “After these two weeks you wouldn’t recognize these patients any more! They had arrived on a stretcher, and now they walked around! They had appetite. They gained weight and the tumors went down.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 407- 408. In strong contrast, if a cup of coffee is swal- lowed, it has entirely different effects—and all of those effects are extremely negative: “A cup of coffee taken by mouth has an entirely different effect . . It heightens the reflex response, lowers the blood pressure, increases heart rate, per- spiration, causes insomnia and heart palpita- tion.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 191. Checking a standard 1,450-page textbook (pp. 374-377 of Mosby’s Pharmacology in Nursing ) which deals with the subject, the effects of drinking coffee or other caffeine products are well-known. “More frequent side effects include increased nervousness or jittery feelings and irritation of GI tract resulting in nausea. More frequent adverse reactions in neonates abdominal swelling or dis- tension, vomiting, body tremors, tachycardia, jit- ters, or nervousness.”— Mosby’s Pharmacology in Nursing, p. 375. It is an intriguing fact that not one of these terrible side effects occurs when a coffee enema is given! Max Gerson said that “a cup of coffee taken by mouth has an entirely different effect.” That was his observation from about 1925, onward to his death in 1959. A diluted coffee enema has one, different, and powerful effect: the strong dilation of the bile ducts. This never occurs when coffee is drunk by mouth. It is clear that drinking coffee by mouth and taking a diluted mixture of it, temporarily into the lower bowel, have totally different effects. Why is this? Here are four reasons why: First, God made the stomach and small in- testines to be the normal means of absorbing substances from the food. This includes carbohy- drates, amino acids, fats, and other nutrients. Apparently, the lower bowel was not designed to absorb substances as well. It does not have the lacteals, found in the small intestine, which absorb nutrients into the blood stream. Second, coffee drunk by mouth, passes through the entire gastro-intestinal system. In contrast, a diluted coffee enema only enters the lower part of the large bowel. Max Gerson’s consistent practice (continued"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 today by the Gerson Institute and all patients) is never to give high colonics, but only low enemas. The fluid enters and is retained only in the lower bowel. Third, coffee, when drunk, remains in the body for up to 5-6 hours, until it is entirely ab- sorbed by the lacteals and has passed into the blood stream, thence to be carried throughout the body and into every organ, wreaking havoc on the entire system. But, in accordance with consistent Gerson di- rectives, a diluted coffee enema only remains in the lower bowel 12 to 15 minutes—and then it is ex- pelled. Fourth, in order to produce so many differ- ent effects, coffee taken by mouth would have to enter the bloodstream, Yet it is quite obvious that a diluted coffee en- ema does not enter the bloodstream—for if it did, it would produce the very same effects,— which it does not. Instead it produces a single, entirely different effect: the powerful opening of the bile ducts, so poisons stored in the liver can be released. What is the mechanism by which this occurs? Max Gerson has stated that the diluted coffee in the enema, instead of actually traveling to the liver in the bloodstream, may only send a signal to it. The present author suggests that it would have to be the latter. If the coffee entered the blood stream and was carried to the liver,—that same coffee would also travel throughout the body and produce all those negative effects which coffee taken by mouth does (heart palpitations, body tremors, etc.). But since a coffee enema produces none of these bad effects, it must be that coffee only sends a sig- nal, via the nerves, to the liver. Thus we are confronted by the fact that cof- fee enemas apparently are not harmful to the system. This conclusion may be incorrect. But that is where the observable facts lead us. However, let us take this matter one step fur- ther: I know any number of people who would never drink a cup of coffee, yet who are quick to take an antibiotic when they are sick. Yet drinking a cup of coffee is far less dangerous! I have never drunk coffee nor taken a coffee enema, yet it is clear to me that we are here dealing with saving human lives. If taking diluted coffee enemas will help save the life of a cancer patient who is dying, then I for one will not be the one to tell him he should not take them. And I do not believe I am wrong in making this decision. The Physiology of Coffee Are there other problematic substances used in the Gerson Therapy? There are several other Gerson “medications” which are not needed by those who are healthy, but which are given to help the sick recover health. The Gerson therapy is focused on but two ob- jectives: filling the body with nutrients and ex- pelling toxic substances from the body. In the process of doing these two things, the cancer is totally eliminated. Everything is done to achieve these two goals. 1 - Liver extract is given because of the continu- ally lowered quality of fresh fruits and vegetables. Gerson began using such a product in 1950, be- cause he found that lab reports revealed that, by the late 1940s, fresh fruits and vegetables no longer had as much nutrients as they had in the early 1930s! If you think you can obtain enough nourishment from fruit and vegetables, then skip the liver. 2 - Pancreatin tablets are given. These help to reduce digestive problems during the heavy detoxi- fication process. But if you do not need it, do not take it. 3 - In addition to iodine (Lugol’s solution), thy- roid is also given. The purpose of this is to ensure that enough iodine is obtained by the cells. (It is the potassium and iodine which starve the sodium out of the cancer cell, killing it.) If you think you are likely to obtain enough io- dine from the Lugol’s, then do not use the thyroid. 4 - Castor oil is given to help flush the poisons out of the intestinal tract, which have been poured into it from the liver through the bile ducts. The effect of castor bean oil is similar to the laxative herbs, except that it is more efficient. You would be very wise not to skip it. In all these matters, you are the boss. But know that Gerson worked out a formula which produces terrific results—but primarily in those who care- fully remain on the full program for 18 to 24 months."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Summary of the Gerson Therapy This book is written for all those on the other side of hope, for the weary, and for those who despair of holding on to life—yet want to cling to it. There is hope in this book. There is a way out of the dark tunnel, back into the land of the living. But it will take dedication and work. If you are not living in the shadow of death, then this book is not for you. Pass it on to someone who will value it. Dr. Albert Schweitzer, the missionary physician to Africa, wrote this about his friend of many years, Dr. Max Gerson: “ . . I see in Gerson one of the most eminent medical geniuses in the history of medicine. He pos- sessed something elemental. Out of deepest thought about the nature of disease and the process of heal- ing, he came to walk along new paths with great success. Unfortunately, he could not engage in sci- entific research or teach; and he was greatly im- peded by adverse political conditions. In ordinary times he would have been able to expound his ideas for many years as professor at one of the impor- tant German universities; would have taught pu- pils who could carry on his research and teach- ings; would have found recognition and encourage- ment . . All this was denied him. “His was the hard lot of searching and working as an uprooted immigrant, to be challenged and to stand as a fighter. We who knew and understood him admired him for working his way out of dis- couragement again and again, and for undertak- ing to conquer the obstacles.”— Dr. Albert Schweitzer, quoted in Journal of the Gerson In- stitute, Fall 1981, p. 14. The following two statements will provide re- searchers with a better idea of the success rate of the Gerson therapy—and the difficulties: “By application of these principles, the Gerson therapy is able to achieve almost routine recovery— 90% or better—from early to intermediate cancer. When cancer becomes incurable by orthodox meth- ods ( i.e ., involves the liver or pancreas or is metas- tasized inside the body), about 50% recoveries can be achieved by the Gerson method. “Norman Fritz gives laetrile as an example of other good nontoxic therapies. It has a good short- term response—relief from pain, remission of ma- lignancy, improvement in appetite and sense of well- being or increase in strength—in 70% or 80% of cancer cases. The long-term recovery rate, however, is about 15% or less. In most cases degeneration progresses to where the laetrile is no longer suffi- cient. In some cases other nontoxic therapies may be constructively combined with the Gerson therapy. “The other big advantage of the Gerson therapy is that it usually heals the body of all the degenera- tive diseases rather than just healing cancer. Many cancer patients are suffering from other degenera- tive conditions also—arthritis, heart conditions, diabetes, etc.”— Cancer News Journal, 1983 Up- date. Of the many, many cases which could be de- scribed, here was one among several where the patient had do everything by himself: “Fifteen years ago, at age 70, Earl Taylor of Cairo, Illinois, was sent home to die by his doctor. Earl had prostate cancer which was spreading exten- sively as a large mass in the groin, in spite of the harmones his doctor had been giving him. His doc- tor told him to get his affairs in order, as there was nothing that could be done to save him. “Earl had read about Dr. Gerson and the Gerson Therapy in Prevention magazine. He contacted Dr. Gerson’s daughter in New York. She sent him Dr. Gerson’s book, A Cancer Therapy — results of 50 cases. Earl had completed the sixth grade as a boy and spent all of his life working in a junk yard. He called Dr. Gerson’s daughter again and told her that he couldn’t understand the book. She suggested that he just follow the treatment outlined on page 235 in the book (page 236 in the latest edition, now gives an hourly schedule). “Earl said it was the hardest thing he ever did in his life. His wife had died years before, so he was all alone. (The institute tells people they should have help with the therapy, to have the best chance of winning.) “Earl was in pain, and the easiest thing to do was to stay in bed; but, he thought, ‘If I do that, I’ll Preface"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 just die.’ So he forced himself out of bed, to grind and press the hourly raw juices and to do the rest of the therapy. Soon the pain was gone. In a month his doctor could no longer feel any of the large mass. “In a few months he felt well enough to go each day to help his friend, Gwinn Dunbar, who was dying of cancer spread through both lungs. Both patients recovered on the Gerson therapy and are still alive 15 years after being hopeless.”— Journal of the Gerson Institute and the Gerson Therapy, Fall, 1981, 5. Here is a second comment on Earl, which clari- fies his case still more: “Earl Taylor, 85, metastasized prostate cancer. Prostate cancer diagnosed by biopsy, 1963. Treated with female hormones. In 1966, mass spreading to groin, much pain, told to go home and get his Preface affairs in order. At age 70, started Gerson therapy. In one month, mass no longer palpable by physi- cian. In 1980, accident caused rib fracture. Bone scan showed no sign of cancer. Remains in good condition, still working part time at 85.” —Op. cit., 4. Birger Jansson, Ph.D., of the University of Texas, found that patients with a higher sodium to potassium ratio in their diets were the ones most likely to have cancer. Stephen Thompson, Ph.D., at the University of California, San Diego, found that in- creasing the sodium content of the diet—would ac- celerate the rate at which metastasis of colon cancer in animals occurred. “Cancer is now the only major killing disease in the industrialized world whose rates are sharply rising. Just by way of quantitative contrast, mortality from AIDS, another eminently preventable dis- ease, although highly alarming if not catastrophic, is relatively low. About 30,000 cases, more than half already fatal, have been re- ported since 1981 when the disease was first detected; additionally, it is estimated that 2-3 times as many Americans suffer from ad- vanced symptoms of the AIDS-related complex which often progresses to frank AIDS. Rapidly increasing numbers of cases, totaling some 270,000 are projected by 1991. In contrast, there have been major reductions in deaths from cardiovascular disease, still the number one killer in the U.S., probably because of a recent de- cline in smoking and attention to diet and exercise. “With over 900,000 new cases and 450,000 U.S. deaths last year, cancer has now reached epidemic proportions, with an incidence of one in three and a mortality of one in four. Analysis of overall cancer rates, standardized for age, sex and ethnicity, has demonstrated steady increases since the 1930s, with more recent sharp annual increases in incidence rates by some 2% and in mortality rates by some 1%. “Can c er is an age-old and ubiquitous group of diseases. Its rec- ognized causes and influences are multifactorial and include natu- ral environmental carcinogens (such as aflatoxins and sunlight), lifestyle factors, genetic susceptibility, and more recently industrial chemicals. Apart from modern lifestyle factors, particularly smok- ing, increasing cancer rates reflect exposure to industrial chemicals and runaway modern technologies.”— Samuel Epstein, M.D., profes- sor of occupational and environmental medicine, University of Illi- nois Medical Center of Chicago, quoted in 1987 Congressional Record, 133(135):E3452-3453."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Summary of the Gerson Therapy Max Gerson, M.D., was born in Germany on Oc- tober 18, 1881. For his graduation tests, at the age of 19, Max wrote a totally new approach to a math- ematics problem. His teacher could not figure it out, so sent it to the University of Berlin. They wrote back, that it was the work of a brilliant mathemati- cian and that Gerson should be directed into higher mathematical studies. But Gerson had other plans. He wanted to become a medical doctor. Max wanted to help people. Graduating from the University of Freiburg in 1907 as a physician, he received advanced training under five of the leading medical experts in Germany. Shortly after completing medical school, Ger- son began experiencing severe migraine headaches. He was only 25, yet he would have to lie in a dark- ened room for two or three days in pain. The doctors had no answer. One told him, “You will feel better when you are 55.” But that was not much of a solution. Then Max read about a woman in Italy who had changed her diet, and her migraines lessened. This gave him an idea, so he began tinkering with his diet. In his case, he had excellent feedback: If he made a beneficial change, the migraines reduced in intensity and frequency; if he made a mistake, one would be- gin within 20 minutes. First, he tried a milk diet, but that was useless. Then he went off all milk, and that helped a little. Then he tried eating apples only—raw, cooked, baked—and that was a great help. Slowly he added other things, till eventually he had totally eliminated his migraines. So he told his migraine patients about his diet. He called it his “migraine diet.” When they returned, they would tell him theirs was gone too. But one said it had also eliminated his lupus ( lupus vulgaris, or tuberculosis of the skin). Gerson knew the man could not have had lupus since it is incurable, but the pa- tient showed him his medical records. The year was 1922. It was obvious to Gerson that the medical theory, that there is but one medicine for each disease, was incorrect. As he later stated it, the great truth was this: “Nourish the body and it will do the healing.” So Max treated some other lupus patients, and their problem vanished also. But patients came back with the news that their other problems had disap- peared as well. The careful dietary program he de- vised was successful in treating asthma and other al- lergies; diseases of the intestinal tract, liver, and pan- creas; tuberculosis; arthritis; heart disease, skin con- ditions, and on and on! Some of his most striking successes were in liver and gallbladder diseases. In Germany at that time, trains often had pri- vate compartments, each one seating six. One day, as a train was about to pull out from the station, a man entered one of the compartments. The only other person there was a distinguished-appearing gentleman who said nothing. As the train got un- derway, the man started chattering to no one in par- ticular. The gentleman tried to ignore him. Soon the man jovially got on the subject of health, and the gentleman wished he could get to his destina- tion a little quicker. Then, opening his shirt slightly, the man said, “And you know, I had this lupus, right here on my chest. And this doctor, he cured it. Now it’s gone!” At this, the gentleman jumped up, lunged at the man, reached for his shirt and said, “Let me see that!” The gentleman was Ferdinand Sauerbruch, M.D., one of Europe’s leading skin and tuberculosis doc- tors. He well-knew that lupus cannot be cured! Obtaining Gerson’s name and address from the man, Sauerbruch contacted Gerson as soon as he reached his office. A friendship was started, and Sauerbruch, impressed with his humility and sincer- ity, arranged a test using Gerson’s remarkable diet on 450 “incurable” lupus patients. But after a week or so, it was obviously a failure. Sauerbruch did not think it would come to this; he had hoped against hope. So he penned a letter to his friend Gerson and, then, slowly walked back across the hospital grounds after posting the note. He was on his way to cancel the test; but, on the way, met a woman carrying two large trays full of meat, gravy, sugary foods, and all the trimmings. Asking her what she was doing, she replied airily: “Oh, the people over in this building are starving, so we’re sneaking food in to make them happy. They have a crazy doc- tor!” Sauerbruch quickly set guards to keep the diet the way Gerson had prescribed it, and then wrote a second letter informing Gerson the test was still in progress. Result: 446 of 450 incurable patients (99%) re- covered. Lupus had been shown to be curable by diet The Story of Max Gerson"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 therapy. But Gerson still had not tried his therapy on cancer patients. Even in Germany, physicians were careful about trying out new cancer remedies. When a couple of cancer victims came to him, he turned them down. But one day, a lady called him to her home, but would not tell him what was wrong with her. Arriving, she told him she had cancer and pled for him to help her. She was in bed, weakened, and in terrible condition. He told her he could not do so. “Please, she said, just write out your dietary for- mula, and I will sign a paper not holding you re- sponsible for what happens.” Gerson did so and left. It was obvious she was too weak to even follow the directions. All alone, the sick woman struggled to follow the program—and recovered totally from cancer. Learning of this, Gerson began treating other can- cer patients. The year was 1928. Of his first 12 cases, 7 responded favorably, remaining symptom free for seven and a half years. (Some of these facts we know because of testi- mony presented by him and others at the July 1-3, 1946, senate hearings, conducted by Claude Pepper of Florida.) Gerson also treated Dr. Albert Schweitzer, his wife, and daughter for various health problems. Gerson saved Mrs. Helene Schweitzer from hopeless lung tu- berculosis in 1931; and, several years later, he healed their daughter of a rare, serious “incurable” erupting skin condition that defied diagnosis. Dr. Schweitzer himself came to Gerson at the age of 75, depressed and weary with advanced diabetes. In five weeks, Dr. Schweitzer had cut his insulin dos- age in half, and in ten was completely off of it. Healed, and with new energy, he returned to Africa where he worked past the age of 90. In response, the world- famed Schweitzer declared, “I see in him one of the most eminent medical geniuses in the history of medi- cine.” Schweitzer afterward required that his physi- cians in Lambarene, Africa, study Gerson’s book, Therapy of Lung Tuberculosis, before they started to treat the patients in his hospital. Gerson was remarkable. Geniuses tend to focus their thoughts, whereas most people scatter theirs. Because of this trait, Gerson could not ride a bicycle. He would be so deep in thought that he would smash it. After having destroyed four of them, his family for- bade more of that. For the same reason, he could not drive a car. His mind was continually at work, devis- ing ways to help his patients. One day while walking in the woods in the Harz Mountains near Bielefeld (before moving to Kassel), Max met a man who raised foxes. The rancher told him that he ran a very successful fox farm. He would buy sick, tubercular foxes for almost no cost, and later sell them. He said his foxes had the finest coats and their pelts brought the highest prices. Gerson asked him how he could do this. Mentioning that it was a secret which must not be shared with the other fox farmers, he said there was a doctor, somewhere in Germany, named Max Gerson who had a nutri- tional cure for disease. The farmer bought sick foxes which had lung tuberculosis, healed them with Gerson’s diet of organic vegetables and fruits, and then sold them at a good profit because they produced such high-quality fox furs. Both men were happy when Gerson introduced himself. At the age of 51, Gerson was asked to present his findings, by appointment, at a meeting of the German Medical Association. At last he would have an opportunity for the world to learn of his work to save people. On April 1, 1933, as he sat in the rail- road car, on his way to Berlin, the train stopped at a station and Hitler’s SS troups entered. When a young, inexperienced SS officer asked Gerson where he was going, Gerson, not knowing there was any danger, enthusiastically showed him X-rays and told him about his work. Impressed, the young man replied that he hoped Gerson would suc- ceed, forgot to ask the question, and passed on to the next man just behind Gerson. For the first time, Gerson heard the question the troops were asking each passenger on the train: “Are you a Jew?” Immediately, Max sensed the terrible danger. All the passengers except Gerson were asked that ques- tion, and Max saw one young man, a Jew, led out- side, where he was gunned down as Gerson watched through the window. He had just seen the first large- scale action to collect 6,000,000 Jews for extermina- tion in the Nazi concentration camps. As the train continued on, Max completely changed his plans. Instead of getting off at Berlin, he contin- ued on the train to Vienna, Austria. From there, he contacted his wife and told her to immediately come with their three girls, which she did. He also contacted all their brothers, sisters, and relatives, and offered to send money for them to leave. But they laughed at his concerns. They had their homes, their businesses, and there was nothing to fear from Hitler. Max Gerson, his wife, and their relatives were Jews. All of those relatives (15, plus children) later perished. From Vienna, Gerson later went to Paris. In 1936, he emigrated to America, and went to school to learn English. In January 1938 he received his medical license and began practicing in New York City. By this time, Gerson could enlarge or shrink surface cancers at will. He knew exactly what was needed to help his patients. The only question gener- ally was whether they were in earnest enough to fully follow his program when they went home. His first contact with medicine in America was The Story of Max Gerson"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 Summary of the Gerson Therapy enlightening. Called as a consultant to physicians treating a wealthy industrialist for arthritis, Gerson outlined what he would do to bring a fairly quick re- covery. There was an awkward pause, and then one of the doctors said, “Dr. Gerson, you are new here. You don’t understand. This man is a wealthy member of the W.R. Grace family. They own steamship lines, banks, chemical companies, and so on. You don’t cure a patient like this. You treat him.” In New York, he treated 90% of his cancer pa- tients without charge and financed his own researches in chronic diseases. From 1946 to 1948 he saw pa- tients at the Gotham Hospital. At the Senate hearings, he testified that he be- lieved the liver held the key to the cure of cancer— and that if the liver was too far gone, treatment was useless. This would be understandable, since the liver, an astounding chemical laboratory, is the primary detoxifying agency in the body. Appearing with him on July 3, 1946, at the three- day Senate hearings were five of his patients, each of whom had fully recovered from some of the most com- mon forms of cancer in America. He also came with X-ray photographs, pathology reports from leading hospitals, and testimonials from many other patients and relatives of cancer victims. In reaction, on November 16, 1946, in its “Frauds and Fables” category, the Journal of the AMA hope- fully dismissed the Gerson’s unprecedented Senate presentation with the words, “Fortunately for the American people this presentation received little, if any, newspaper publicity.” In its January 8, 1949, issue, the Journal wrote, “There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to indi- cate that modifications in the dietary intake of food or other nutritional essentials are of any specific value in the control of cancer.” During his lifetime, Gerson wrote 51 articles, published in medical journals. (All of his publica- tions are listed at the back of S.J. Haught’s book, Has Dr. Max Gerson a True Cancer Cure? ) But, for the most part, Gerson worked alone. Other physi- cians generally feared to help him or duplicate his work, for fear of reprisal. Eventually, Gerson’s medical privileges at Gotham Hospital were revoked, and he was unable to find an affiliation with any other hospital in the city. In 1953 his malpractice insurance was discontinued. One $100,000 malpractice lawsuit would have wiped him out. Because the larger number of those who sought him had advanced cancers, some of them died. Yet their relatives knew that they died with dignity, free from pain and brain-numbing narcotics. Gerson’s needs were simple. Patients were shocked to learn that he would generally charge $25 for the first visit and $5 or $10 for subsequent visits. (They had earlier been told he charged high fees, $1,000 or $2,000 for each visit.) Refusing to stop his work, Gerson treated pa- tients at his own facilities. In October 1954 at the age of 73, he wrote his former patient and close friend, Albert Schweitzer, “Those who say they would like to help, often tell me they cannot. They regret not being able to assist me for fear of losing their position in hospi- tals and laboratories. I have long abandoned thoughts of attaining any kind of recognition, none- theless I continue on my way.”— Journal of the Gerson Institute, Fall 1981, 16. Some of his best-documented, recovered patients died, when they were urged back by their former phy- sicians for examination, and then told they must have surgery or radiation—when they were totally free of cancer symptoms or evidence. On two occasions Gerson became violently ill af- ter being served coffee by a group supposedly sup- porting him. Later laboratory tests showed unusu- ally high levels of arsenic in his urine. Some of Gerson’s best case histories mysteriously disappeared from his files. In 1956, the manuscript and all of its copies for Gerson’s almost completed book (A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty Cases) were stolen and never recovered. Separating himself from that group, Gerson, now quite aged, raced against time to completely rewrite the book. In 1958, the book was published. On March 4 of that same year, he was finally suspended for two years from the New York Medi- cal Society. At a meeting of the New York Academy of Medicine, the surgeons, radiologists, and physi- cians condemned a colleague who was living by Hippocrates’ dictum: “Above all, do no harm.” Gerson died a year later (March 8, 1959), shortly after he fell down the stairs in his house. He was 78 years old. Upon Gerson’s death, Albert Schweitzer, the Nobel prize-winning physician and missionary, and a pa- tient of Gerson’s, made this statement: “I see in him one of the most eminent medical geniuses in the history of medicine . . Many of his basic ideas have been adopted without having his name connected with them. Yet he has achieved more than seemed possible under adverse condi- tions. He leaves a legacy which commands atten- tion and which will assure him his due place. Those whom he cured will now attest to the truth of his ideas.”— Albert Schweitzer, M.D., Ph.D., quoted in S.J. Haught, Has Max Gerson a True Cancer Cure? 1962. That prediction was to prove true. At the urging of many individuals who recognized that a revival of Gerson’s therapy was urgently needed, Charlotte Gerson Strauss (the youngest of Gerson’s three daughters; born March 27, 1922), headed up a"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 new venture, called the Gerson Institute, in a clinic/ hospital in Tijuana, Mexico. The Gerson Institute was incorporated on June 27, 1978, twenty years after the publication of Gerson’s book, A Cancer Therapy, and nineteen years after his death. The Gerson Institute headquarters is located in Bonita, California, near San Diego. The hospital, is in a suburb of Tijuana, Mexico.

People who go on this program are frequently close to death. Unlike some other “cancer rem- edies,” THIS PROGRAM SAVES LIVES . If the reader does not like the program, or wish to go on the pro- gram, that is his choice. But he should not reprove those who do, so they can continue living. They need encouragement, not reproof. There are medicines used in this therapy to help recover the sick. You and I do not take those medicines. They are not for us. We are well. But, for the greater part of a century, Dr. Gerson and associates found that these special substances brought people back from the brink of death—for those substances provided the ill with a combina- tion of abundant tissue nourishment and intense tissue cleansing. Like all medicines, they are used for a time by sick people to help make them well. After that, they can be set aside. To friends and loved ones of the sufferer with advanced cancer, we would say: This person is bat- tling for his or her life, and needs your help. He or she may die without earnest efforts. Let’s pitch in and help. If the situation were to be reversed, is not this what you would want others to do for you? 1 - INTRODUCTION The reasoning behind this therapy Although this book was written for researchers and historians, it is able to make many other people better informed on these issues. Since there are over fifty cancer treatment meth- ods surveyed in this complete book of over 200 pages, in searching for the best ones to work with— what are the essential points we should keep in mind, in order to find the best remedial program for cancer? (In the following overview, we will frequently re- fer to the cancer as a “tumor,” knowing that not all types of cancer are in that form.) FOUR SPECIAL PROBLEMS— In dealing with cancer, what are the areas which need correcting? 1 - Wasting away: Medical experts know that cancer victims starve to death. Their systems be- come so disorganized, due to poisons thrown into the system by the malignancy, that they cannot prop- erly assimilate the food they eat. This problem must be dealt with. 2 - Reduce the tumor: The tumor must be downsized or shrunk. In the medical route, this is done by applying surgery, chemotherapy, or radia- tion to the tumor. In the process, severe damage is done to surrounding tissue and, generally, to the entire body. Natural remedies accomplish this task by gradually dissolving the tumor, so that it is car- ried off in the blood stream. 3 - Clean the liver: As the tumor breaks up, it is carried by the blood to the liver, which is the pri- mary blood-cleaning organ. But this results in a pileup of toxic substances in the liver. So much waste is being carried to it, from the tumor, that the liver cannot eliminate it fast enough. So shrinkage of the tumor requires an urgent, ongoing cleansing of the liver. The poisons in it must be removed. If this is not done, the person will become drowsy and go into a hepatic coma. He will slip into unconscious- ness, and die from liver poisoning. 4 - Clean the bowel. As the poisons are expelled from the liver, they must be rapidly taken out of the body through the intestines and large bowel. It is vital that the body be aided in this function. Just because toxins have passed from the tumor to the liver, and into the intestinal tract—does not mean they are out of the body. We know, from how the body works in other disorders, that when the bowel is overloaded, toxic substances are reabsorbed from it—and carried to the liver and kidneys for removal. To summarize the above: Good nutrition cleans the tumor, gradually emptying it into the blood- stream, where it travels to the liver, which cleans the blood. Help is needed to clean the liver, which then empties the poisons through the gall bladder into the small intestine. That waste must be quickly hurried out of the body. Reading through the more than fifty cancer treat- ment methods in this book, we find that all of them claim to reduce the tumor tissue. But very few of them deal with all five factors; indeed, most appear to not be aware that all five"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 must be dealt with. In order to have the highest rate of success, all five factors must be dealt with, and on an ongoing basis, every day! SOLVING THE FOUR PROBLEMS— Let us now consider each of these five factors more closely: 1 - Wasting away: Part One of this present book provides a wealth of information on nutrition needed to prevent cancer and aid in eliminating it. Of the several dozen treatments described in Part Two, some strongly emphasize nutrition. These include Bulkley (47), Bell (48), Ozias (50) Hindhede (55), Chase (59), Kloss (66), Drosnes and Lazenby (71) Evers (82), Wigmore (84), Kelley (85), Knekt (89), Livingston (95), Schrauzer (99), Issels (102), Asai (106), Karmali (107) Krebs (118), and Gerson (142). But, of these, most provide us with only vague data on nutritional changes needed or focus on the use of a single vitamin or nutrient. Here are the few which actually had a nutritional program which was highly organized: Chase (59), Kloss (66), Drosnes and Lazenby (71), Kelley (85), Krebs (especially see 126-129), and Gerson (142 onward). Of these, the Krebs and Gerson nutritional pro- grams are to be noted. But the Gerson nutritional program is the most carefully structured and adapted to the needs of the cancer sufferer. 2. Reduce the tumor: All of the more than fifty remedial programs discussed in this book claim to reduce the tumor mass. A number of them use special chemicals, herbs, serums, vitamins, or oxygen to do it. An excellent, brief survey of what each uses to reduce the tumor will be found on pp. 167-168. Of the various methods used, one of the best is nutrition. Good food can not only reverse the wast- ing away problem; but, in addition, it is the primary way the tumor is dissolved! Because the Gerson therapy provides the best nutrition, it is, in this respect, the best of more than forty programs for reducing the tumor. 3. Clean the liver: Surprisingly, although many methods have been devised to dissolve the tumor, very little attention has generally been paid to the need to come to the rescue of the overworked liver,— and remove the toxic buildup developing there as it cleans dissolving cancer tissue from the blood stream. To our knowledge, only the Gerson program systematically deals with this problem. 4. Clean the bowel: Once again, the Gerson program is one of only a few which give careful at- tention to this need. As an important added ben- efit, as the liver and bowel are cleansed, pain is found to be reduced, and the person feels much better. BETTER IN SEVEN WAYS— One might imag- ine that the present writer is prejudiced in favor of the Gerson program. Yet he wants you to know that he came to this conclusion after having written the present 200-page survey of all the better-known al- ternative cancer therapies and their results. Why is the Gerson therapy superior? Here are several very important reasons: Number of people helped: This is the outstand- ing factor: the pragmatic test. Does it really work? How many people has it helped? The Gerson pro- gram has helped more people recover from cancer than any other method that we know of. Length of time it has been used: In the twen- tieth century, the Gerson therapy has been used longer than any other. Max Gerson first began us- ing the method about the year 1910, and contin- ued doing so until his death in 1959. In 1978 his daughter, Charlotte, teamed up with a medical group and opened a clinic in Tijana, Mexico, which has continued on down to the present. That is a span of 70 years! Continual improvement for 70 years: As Gerson and those who followed him have tried to help cancer patients, they have gradually improved on the method. They were not satisfied to stop with one or two discoveries. They have considered ev- ery approach used by others and have found a few which are useful (many which were not). Not a single substance: A large number of the forty alternative cancer remedies discussed else- where in this large book are single-item prepara- tions. Yet it requires a broad nourishment and cleansing approach to both remove the cancer and rebuild the body. The Gerson program is broader than any other the present writer has, to date, found. No strange chemicals: Other than potassium and iodine, both elements which the body needs, the Gerson therapy does not use chemicals. There are no laboratory-prepared extracts, no horse se- rums. Nearly all the foodstuffs can be purchased in a grocery store. No pain opiates needed: Daily cleansing of the liver and bowel removes the pain. This enables the person to be much more cheerful and positive, and 1 - Introduction"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Summary of the Gerson Therapy obtain better rest during sleep, during the recovery process. A cancer therapy is moving in the right di- rection when it reduces the accompanying pain. The removal of pain shows that the buildup of toxins in the body is being lowered. Willingness to share: Gerson and his associ- ates have been willing to share all they know, so folk can use it at home. That is a quality one does not find very often. We do not have here a secret formula, which is kept hidden for personal profit. FIVE DANGERS— Yet, not even the Gerson therapy can heal every cancer sufferer. It should be kept in mind that certain factors reduce the likeli- hood of healing: 1 - Progression: How far the cancer has ad- vanced. If a person begins on a nutritional/cleans- ing program early, he is far more likely to achieve a full recovery. (However, much of Gerson’s success- ful work was with patients which the other physi- cians had given up on.) 2 - Location: The cancer site. Some types of carcinomas are more difficult to heal than others. Therefore, as soon as one recognizes that he has cancer, it is best to begin a full healing program. 3 - Chemotherapy and/or radiation: Has the individual received any chemotherapy or radiation for cancer? If so, his body has been heavily poisoned and weakened. Chemotherapy and radiation oper- ate on the principle of trying to kill more cancer cells than the other cells. In the process, all kinds of cells are damaged or destroyed. But even if all the cancer cells were to be eliminated by chemo or radiation,—if the body has been greatly weakened in the attempt, and if nothing has particularly been done to cleanse the system of impurities or rebuild it with the best of food, the person would probably relapse into cancer again. 4 - Fully on the program: If the person does not fully go on the Gerson program (the choice of many), he/she is so delighted with the early relief that they only do the program partially or quit after a few months. 5. After a relapse: If the person goes on a can- cer-reduction program (Gerson, Laetrile, Essiac, etc.), then reduces or terminates it before the can- cer is fully gone, and later tries to go on the pro- gram again after the cancer returns—he can find himself in very real trouble. Frequently, after a re- lapse, the cancer can not be controlled as it earlier had been. WHY DID GERSON SUCCEED?— Max Gerson succeeded where many have failed because he spent decades trying to improve his clinical work and watched closely to see what worked instead of what the researchers, working with rats, had concluded. “The physician . . hesitates to take risks for his patients by applying a not-recognized treatment . . I was in a more favorable position. Ninety to ninety- five percent of my patients were far advanced (ter- minal) cases without any risk to take; either all recognized treatments had failed or the patents were inoperable from the beginning.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. xiv. “Retrospectively, I think the results were arrived at because I did not follow most of the scientific literature nor the laboratory findings, as far as they did not accord with the clinical confirmations. ‘Der Erfolg am Krankenbett ist entscheidend,’ Profes- sor Kussmaul said. (‘The result at the sick-bed is decisive.’) I do not want to make the mistake Win- ston Churchill expressed so clearly: ‘Men occasion- ally stumble over Truth, but most pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing had happened.’ ”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 212 [cf. p. 207] “The scientifically accepted method is that these [cancer] symptoms alone will be treated locally wherever they appear. [If there is cancer of the mouth, treat the mouth, etc.] That is what we phy- sicians learn and how we are trained in university clinics. All research work adheres mostly to these local symptoms. This is, in my opinion, the reason why decisive progress in cancer treatment has been impeded.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 37. “ ‘Symptomatic treatment is harmful wherever in nature it is applied to the soil, plants, animals or human beings, or in medicine. Each part is im- portant, but the whole in its infinitely fine order is more important.’ ”— Dr. Werner Kollath, quoted in Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 5. “As Dr. Gerson expresses it, cancer is not spe- cific. It is a degenerative condition of the total me- tabolism, including damage to the liver and all es- sential organs, which then makes it possible for cancer to develop. Similar damage also precedes other chronic diseases.”— Charlotte Gerson Straus, Appendix 1, A Cancer Therapy, p. 391 [Gerson’s youngest daughter]. Max Gerson recognized that God’s plan was for man to eat wholesome food. In order to provide food for the plants, God gave us the soil, and then He gave us a gardener to till it! “In Readers Digest, Dr. Thomas Barrett referred to the earthworm and soil. A French peasant told Dr. Barrett, ‘ Le Bon Dieu knows how to build good earth and He has given the secret to the earth- worms.’ ”— Thomas Barrett, Readers Digest, May 1948, quoted in Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 184. GERSON EXPLAINS HIS METHOD— The fol- lowing statements will help you understand Max Gerson’s work: “The experimental causation of cancer, first ac-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 complished by Yamagiva and Itchikawa, through rubbing tar substance on the ears of rabbits for about nine months, is of importance insofar as they found that before the cancer started to appear, the liver was damaged and showed pathological changes, together with the kidneys, spleen and the lymphatic apparatus. The long period was required to poison the liver, before the damaged cells could perform the ‘mutation’ into cancer.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 40. “Cancer means: (1) Slow intoxication and alter- ation of the whole body, especially the liver. (2) In- vasion of the Na-group [sodium and chloride], loss of the K-group [potassium and iodine], followed by tissue edema. (3) Lower electrical potentials in vi- tal organs, more edema, accumulation of poisons, loss of tension, tonus, reduced reactivation and oxi- dation power, dedifferentiation [lack of differentia- tion] of some cells. (4) Cancer starts: general poi- soning increases, vital functions and energies de- crease. Cancer increases. (5) Further destruction of the metabolism and liver parenchym [the distin- guishing or unique cells of the liver are destroyed]. Cancer rules, is acting, spreading. (6) Loss of last defense [the liver]. Hepatic coma. Death.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 102. “The cancerous body is anergic, which means that it cannot prevent cancerous growth nor re- spond and defend itself against it. The treatment, therefore, has the task of restoring these normal functions, . . and finally, the conditions are restored for production, activation and reactivation of oxi- dizing enzymes.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 124. “From the beginning, I felt that the tumor had to be killed while some scientists were satisfied to ar- rest the growths for as long a time as possible. In one of my articles I enumerated eleven points of difference between normal and cancer cells. “The most important points are: cancer cells have more Na (ionized) [Cancer cells have more ionized sodium], live on fermentation (not on the normal oxidation), are negatively charged electri- cally, do not have the normal exchange with blood and serum, and grow and spread uncontrolled. “Studying these, I felt there must be a way to prevent the fermentation, that is, to eliminate the basic facts upon which fermentation is built and can function. The fermentation is vital for the life of the cancer cell. That is the object upon which we could base further tests and explorations. How could this be done? The most Na-free [sodium free] diet has to be applied to extract Na from cancer cells through the blood and lymph stream. Instead of Na, potassium and the oxidizing enzymes have to be brought in with the help of an allergic inflam- mation.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 195. “According to Dr. Gerson’s research, the begin- ning of all chronic disease is the loss of potassium (K) from the cells and invasion of sodium (Na) into the cells, and with it water. This causes edema and the resulting malfunctions—loss of electrical po- tentials in the cells, improper enzyme formation, reduced cell oxidation, etc. The building of almost all enzymes requires K as a catalyst (activating agent) and is inhibited (slowed or stopped) by Na . . “In order to initiate healing then, it is essential to remove excess Na from the cells, reintroduce large amounts of K, and detoxify the system of ac- cumulated intermediary substances and other tox- ins. This is best accomplished by large amounts of K from fresh fruit and juices, detoxification through the kidneys and by enemas, and reactivation of the liver by special liver therapy. “If this were only a theoretical assumption, it would not be worth mentioning. However, in Dr. Gerson’s many years of experience with all types of chronic disease, this process worked in practice. Degenerative disease could be reversed, eliminated, and the body healed.”— Charlotte Gerson, Appen- dix 1, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 392-393. “A precancerous development [in the body] . . does mean the pre-stage of any kind of skin can- cer, but it does mean a gradual intoxication with a loss of the normal content of the potassium group and the iodine from the tissues of vital organs. That chronic loss opens the door for the invasion of so- dium, chloride and water into the cells, producing a kind of edema. “In my opinion, it must be assumed, as a rule, that sodium and iodine favor undifferentiated, quicker growth, seen in embryos and cancer; while potassium and iodine assure a more differentiated, slower growth with normal cell division. “Here sodium and potassium are the exponents of two minerals groups with opposite electrical potentials, keeping the body in a controlled equi- librium . . “Iodine is necessary for higher differentiation and increased oxidation and could be used for that rea- son against cancer development, but not alone.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 197. So starving the cancer cells of their sodium was an important factor in killing the cancer cell. An- other was abundant, good nutrition—which would fill the body with potassium. “Reading all the [medical] literature, I saw that all the scientists treat the symptoms. These, I thought, are only symptoms. There must be some- thing basic behind them . . Through my work with tuberculosis, I learned that in tuberculosis and in all other degenerative diseases, one must not treat the symptoms. The body—the whole body—has to be treated . . I came to the conclusion that the most important part of our body is the digestive tract . . And at the same time eliminate all the waste prod- ucts . . The liver plays an important role. It elimi- nates the toxins from the body, prepares them so they can enter into the bile ducts, and can thus be 1 - Introduction"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 Summary of the Gerson Therapy eliminated with the bile;—that is not an easy job . . “The digestive tract is very much poisoned in cancer. How can we handle that? Detoxification is an easy word, but it is very difficult to do in cancer patients. These cases, when they are far advanced, can hardly eat. They have no stomach juice, the liver doesn’t function, the pancreas doesn’t func- tion, nothing is active. “Where do we begin? The most important first step is the detoxification. So let us go into that. First we gave some different enemas. I found out that the best enema is the coffee enema as it was first used by Prof. O.A. Meyer in Goettingen. This idea occurred to him when, together with Prof. Heubner, he gave caffeine solution into the rectum of animals. He observed that the bile ducts were opened and more bile could flow . . “The patients [I worked with] reported that this was doing them good. The pain disappeared even though in order to carry through the detoxification, we had to take away all sedation. I realized that it is impossible to detoxify the body on the one hand and put in drugs and poisons on the other . . One patient told me that he had one grain of codeine every two hours and he got morphine injections— how can you take these away? I told him that the best sedation is a coffee enema. After a very short time he had to agree with that , , [Gerson then mentions that his treatments cause the tumors, as they dissolved away, to begin shrinking] . . “These patients who absorb the big tumor masses [from the tumor into the blood stream into the liver] are awakened with an alarm clock every night because they are otherwise poisoned by the absorption of these masses. If I give them only one or two or three enemas, they die of poisoning. I did not have the right as a physician to cause the body to absorb all the cancer masses and then not to detoxify enough. With two or three enemas they were not detoxified enough! They went into a coma hepaticum (liver coma). “Autopsies showed that the liver was poisoned. I learned from these disasters that you can’t give these patients too much detoxification . . When I didn’t give these patients the night enemas, they were drowsy and almost semi-conscious in the morning. The nurses confirmed this and told me that it takes a couple of enemas till they are free of this toxic state again. I cannot stress the detoxifi- cation enough. Even so with all these enemas, this was not enough! I had to also give them castor oil by mouth and by enema every other day, at least for the first week or so. “After these two weeks you wouldn’t recognize these patients any more! They had arrived on a stretcher, and now they walked around! They had appetite. They gained weight and the tumors went down.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 406- 408. “In former periods when there was not enough detoxification in my treatment, after the tumor was killed, the patient did not die of cancer—but of a serious intoxication with coma hepaticum caused by absorption of necrotic [dead] cancer tissue, as several autopsies have shown. “The solution is that all these former failures can no longer occur if there is an intensive detoxi- fication [through enemas] maintained long enough and a potassium plus iodine predominance [through nutrition] kept present . . Only a detoxi- fied body has both power of resistance and heal- ing.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 197- 198. Gradually, the tumor shrinks and dissolves. But more is required than merely killing the tumor cells. Next must come the task of cleaning those dead cells out of the system, and killing cancer cells elsewhere in the body. “But now we have to deal with a mass of dead cells in the body, in the blood stream—and they have to be eliminated wherever they may be. And that is not so easy! The ripe [cancer] cells, the mature cells, are very abnormal. They are much more easily killed than the other cells which are unripe, not yet mature, and not so well developed. “And there are other cancer cells in lymph ves- sels. These are clogged at both ends by cancer cells. No blood and no lymph can reach them. There are cancer cells in the glands. They are hidden there, protected from regular circulation. So it isn’t easy to reach these. “At first it is only the big [tumor] mass which is killed. But this dead mass now has to be absorbed wherever it is . . This absorption is only possible through the blood steam. I call this ‘parenteral di- gestion.’ [In contrast,] Enteral digestion is in the intestinal tract. Parenteral digestion takes place out- side the digestive tract, through the blood stream. It becomes important then to continually carry on detoxification day and night in order to bring the parenteral digestion to the highest point . . How can this be done? “ . . [Gerson says the key is in building good soil and only eating good food.] . . But our modern food, the ‘normal’ food people eat is bottled, poisoned, canned, color added, powdered, frozen, dipped in acids, sprayed—no longer normal. We no longer have living, normal food . . One cannot cure very sick people by adding poisons to their systems. We cannot detoxify our bodies when we add poisons through our food, which is one of the reasons why cancer is so much on the increase.” Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 410. But an important key is whether the liver can be saved. “I should like to tell you what we do to prove that this treatment really does work on cancer. Number one, the results. I think I can claim [in 1956] that I have, even in these far advanced cases,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 50% results. The real problem arises when we can- not restore the liver. Then there is no hope. The liver—the restoration of the liver and its functions— are so important that some of the patients whose livers cannot be restored die some six months to 2 ½ years later from cirrhosis. Autopsies show no cancer cells in the body. They did not die from can- cer. They died from a shrunken liver.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 411. But can we not use drugs and hormones to stimulate the liver? “We have to separate the state of pre-cancerous condition form the state where the cancer appears. In the pre-cancerous condition, all is prepared. “The liver is sufficiently damaged and the other organs of the intestinal tract are damaged enough and then later the symptoms appear. Until then we have the pre-cancerous condition—and this con- dition cannot be cured with hormones and en- zymes, etc. “We can to a certain degree stimulate the liver with hormones. We can stimulate the liver with cor- tisone. We can stimulate the liver with adrenalin, etc., but then we take out the last reserves. We empty the liver instead of refilling it. What we have to do in cancer—a degenerative, deficiency disease—is to refill the organs which are empty and poi- soned.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 414. “Q. [Question from audience] Your treatment worked in advanced cases of cancer of the liver? A. [Dr. Gerson’s reply] If more than half to three-quar- ters of the liver is gone, you can’t restore its func- tion enough to save the patient. You may save them for half a year to a year, but then the liver may shrink and the patients die of a shrunken liver, cirrhosis of the liver. “The liver is such an important organ that when it has to eliminate its own cancer, this has to be done by the healthy liver tissue. Yet the process of elimination can damage the healthy liver tissue, if we don’t detoxify constantly day and night, espe- cially in these cases . . [He then tells of a woman who was brought to him with an apparently hope- less liver in terrible shape,—but he was able to save her because she kept taking the coffee enemas, ev- ery hour or two, and castor oil enemas twice a day— instead of the normal regime of 5 coffee enemas every 24 hours, and one castor oil enema every two days.]”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 416. “The Damacles Sword of cirrhosis hangs over all cancer patients who have far advanced malig- nancies in their abdominal organs. We know that all these organs send their blood through the por- tal veins into the liver where tumor cells settle very frequently as soon as the liver, working as a filter, has lost its defense power.”— Max Gerson, A Can- cer Therapy, p. 68. 2 - THE BASIC THERAPY What is included in the program The present writer could find the full Gerson program, clearly presented, only in the middle and back of the two Gerson books. Yet people with can- cer are frequently too weary to search through all those pages to find the complete program. Therefore a distillation of this data has been gathered here. This may be the only place the en- tire program is available in a single location. Doubt- less, the Gerson Institute will eventually publish a book with all of the following information in one place. Our sources are as follows: Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 187-248, 391-422, and scattered portions of pp. 3-185. The Gerson Institute, The Gerson Primer, pp. 3-18, 36-46, 101-102. Charlotte Gerson, several explanatory lectures and demonstration videos. HOW TO BEGIN— If you decide to go on the Gerson program, it is best that you make an ap- pointment and go to the Gerson Institute. ( Gerson Institute 888-4-GERSON (888-443-7766) / 619- 267-1150 / P .O. Box 430, Bonita, CA 92002.) Life is short enough, and you are in a crisis. Time could be very short. You and your helper will learn what to do, and your special needs will be ascertained. The costs are nothing compared with what you would pay for an equivalent amount of time in a regular hospital. However, if you cannot do this, the folk at Gerson are very willing for you to care for yourself at home. For more pre-preparation ideas, read Initial House Preparation, under Schedules, near the back of this book. DO THIS FIRST— If you plan to go to the Gerson Institute, it would be well to first read this section very carefully. If you plan to go on the program at home, you will find here a brief overview of all as- pects of the therapy. 1 - Thoughtfully read through the following for- mula. Keep in mind that every part is important, and that it is the result of 70 years of research, field testing on human beings (not rats), multiplied thou- sands of healings, with continual modifications and improvements in formula. 2 - Order the mail-order supplies (flax oil, po- tassium, etc.). They are listed at the back. 3 - Purchase several-days worth of local sup- plies (carrots, apples, etc.) 4 - Borrow or purchase a Norwalk juicer. It will combine the pulping and pressing operations. Or 2 - The Basic Therapy"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 Summary of the Gerson Therapy obtain a lower-cost juicer (such as a Champion), which will make the pulp, and a separate manual press. (Norwalk juicers have electrically operated presses, which are very nice!) 5 - Begin taking the juices and enemas while you wait for the other supplies. 6 - Add on the other features of the program as additional supplies arrive. It is vital that you keep in mind that there is danger in not remaining on the program. The Gerson Institute finds that some drop out when, several months later, they begin feeling so much bet- ter. Yet the underlying problem has not yet been corrected. Later, when they experience a relapse, a return to the therapy is frequently not as success- fully made. Therefore it is urgent that you stay with the pro- gram for a year and a half to two years. SPECIAL NEEDS— Here are two very special needs, which could be overlooked: Rest: A cancer patient needs a lot of rest. Do not try to do much exercise or work in the early stages of the program. Do not overdo. As energy returns, you can start on some very mild exercise, such as a five-minute walk—but not in extreme heat or cold. This can later be extended to 8-10 minute walks. When tired, stop, and return to shorter walks. Do not do strenuous exercise (tennis, etc.) for a year or two. Avoid swimming pools, which are chlori- nated. Ocean water is too salty. Only swim in a clear mountain stream or lake, with no pollutant runoff into it or above it. Danger of infections: Beware of taking cold and getting sick! Cancer patients have greatly weak- ened immune systems. Be very careful in this re- spect. FORBIDDEN FOODS FORBIDDEN FOODS— Read the labels of ev- erything you put in your body or on your body. Junk foods: Do not use sharp spices (fresh or dried herbs are permitted), tea, coffee, instant cof- fee, cocoa, chocolate, tobacco, alcohol, refined sugar, white flour, refined flour, candies, ice cream, cream, or cake. More junk foods: Do not use foods that are bottled, canned, frozen, preserved, refined, salted, smoked, or sulphured. Do not use commercial bev- erages. Heavy foods: Do not use nuts, mushrooms, soy beans and soy products, pickles, cucumbers. Oil, meat, dairy products: Do not use fats, oils, or grease. Do not use meat, fish, eggs, milk, butter, cream, cheese. Do not use avocados or nuts (too much fatty acid). Lecithin: Because of its fat content, lecithin should not be used while on the program. “Q. Soy products and soy beans are forbidden. But is lecithin forbidden, which is made from soy- beans? A. Since soy beans contain fats, I had to forbid them. Cancer patients are not able for a long time to digest fats to the end product. When some intermediate substances are left in the body, they work as carcinogenic substances. Therefore we had to cut out fats, oils, and goods containing them . . Q. Is fat-free lecithin okay? A. Yes, but not in the beginning. After six weeks, fat-free lecithin is okay.” —Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 411. [Note: Gerson made that statement in 1956; in 1959, he discovered that flaxseed oil greatly helped cancer patients, so he began prescribing it.] Certain fruits: Do not use berries or pineapple. Their aromatic acids cause unfavorable reactions. (Red currents are all right.) Do not use sulphured dried fruits. “Q. Why are all berries prohibited? A. Some of the patients are hypersensitive, especially in the beginning, against berries which are a little diffi- cult to digest. Therefore I cut them out.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 411. Salt products: Do not use salt products, such as table salt, sodium bicarbonate, soda, and all salt substitutes. Salt is now added to many different types of food. Spices: Do not use spices (paprika, all types of pepper). Alfalfa seeds and sprouts: Never use alfalfa seeds and sprouts. They contain canavanine , which may cause flare-ups (reactions) in rheumatoid con- ditions. Certain leaves: Do not use leaves of carrots, radishes and mustard greens. Water: While on the full program, drink no wa- ter. The full capacity of the stomach is needed for juices and soup. (However, do not imagine that this applies if you are not fully on the program. If you are only taking, say, 4 cups a juices a day, and do not want to bother making more—you had better drink additional water! Of course, if you are not on the full program, you are far less likely to solve your cancer problem.) Fasting: In most cases, fasting is also forbid- den. Cancer is a chronic disease and serious nutri- tional deficiencies exist. Good food is urgently needed. “Q. What is your conception of a prolonged [food] fast or periodical three-day fast? A. You can’t let the cancer patient fast. In the cancer patient the body is so depleted if you let them fast they go down- hill terribly.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 417. Vitamin and mineral supplements: Here is what Dr. Gerson had to say about taking supple- mentary vitamins and minerals while on the Gerson therapy: “Q. Are vitamin and mineral supplements okay [when a person has cancer]? A. No, they are wrong because calcium and many other minerals cannot be added so easily. They bring the system out of harmony. With calcium you can produce cancer . . No calcium, no magnesium, no other minerals. I tried it . . One should not change the mineral me- tabolism, especially in cancer. Only the two most important minerals potassium and sodium must be balanced. This is the need of the cancer pa- tient.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 415. “On the basis of my treatment . . hormones, some vitamins [A, D, and E named], calcium phosphate compositions and caridin [a type of synthetic io- dine] had a carcinogenic effect.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 220. Dr. Gerson accidently overlooked the above question on vitamins; so additional questions were later asked about them: “Q. Is folic acid treatment contraindicated dur- ing treatment of cancer? A. Yes, folic acid did dam- age.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 417. “Q. What vitamins are okay to take with your treatment? A. With the vitamins we have a similar situation as we saw with the hormones. It dam- aged patients with vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B and B 6 . Patients get really damaged. Vitamin A and D is picked up by the cancer cells immediately. Nia- cin we can use.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 418 [more about niacin on page 23]. “Several times I observed that vitamins in good combinations, with or without minerals, produced a regrowth of cancer or new spreadings in a few days. The patient felt better for a shorter or longer period through what may be regarded as the stimu- lation of the entire metabolism. However, the can- cer regrew, caused by what some other authors explained as the greater attraction power of the can- cerous tissue.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 210. “[In young boys and girls] Ten to fourteen days after the administration of calcium compound, the cancers started a rapid regrowth and were beyond cure. I had the impression that calcium-composi- tion worked in the cancer body like Na. [sodium].”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 210. “Other failures [in saving cancer patients] re- sulted from a substitution of so-called caridin for Lugol’s and thyroid, as well as from the applica- tion of some other harmones and vitamins, ova- rian substance, vitamin E, A, D, etc. . . I adminis- tered calcium and phosphate compositions in a number of cases where the X-rays showed far ad- vanced decalcification and in three cases of hemo- philia, complicated by osteosarcoma tumors. The bleedings had been stopped with this medication, but the tumors started to grow immensely. Several of these cases were lost.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 220. In summary, when malignant tumor growth is occurring, do not take single vitamins, with the ex- ception of the above-mentioned niacin, vitamin C and B 12 . Be guarded about taking calcium. FORBIDDEN NON-FOOD SUBSTANCES— Do not take hormones, especially opposite-sex hor- mones! For more on this, see Gerson’s A Cancer Therapy, p. 210. Do not take raw liver juice, be- cause it may be infected with bacteria (see pp. 421- 422 in the 5th edition of A Cancer Therapy .) The Gerson Institute now uses desiccated liver tablets. Skin: Do not use cosmetics. They clog the pores, and keep the skin from breathing and eliminating toxins. While on any intensive therapy, use no skin lotions, creams, etc. of any kind, nor nail polish. Do not use lipstick. Deodorants: Do not use any deodorant or anti- perspirant. They are harmful, block lymph pas- sages, and are absorbed and poison the system. To block the lymph passages is to force the toxins back into the body. Do not use perfumes or perfumed substances. Salt products: Do not use salt products, such as sodium bicarbonate (in food, toothpaste, gargles, etc.), soda, epsom salts, and all salt substitutes. Do not brush your teeth with baking soda. Do not gargle with it. Do not use toothpaste which has it. Salt is now added to many different types of food. Fluorine: Do not use fluoridated toothpaste. Do not use fluorine gargle, hair dying, and permanents. Do not use any other hair dyes. Hair: Do not use hair sprays, including lacquers. Do not use hair dyes or permanents. Sprays: Get all aerosol sprays, air fresheners, perfumed items, insecticides, paint fumes, and simi- lar materials out of the house. TV: Avoid television radiation. Other toxic substances: Eliminate from your home the following: asbestos, cigarette smoke, pes- ticides and herbicides, fluoride in the water, new carpeting, urea formaldehyde insulation (insulation boards). Also get rid of synthetic materials in rugs, draperies, bedding, and clothing. Teeth: It is best that you care for all dental root problems. It is possible for tooth infections to not be noticed, yet be gradually sending poison through- out the body. Solve dental root canal and abscess problems. Tooth fillings: Mercury (amalgam) dental fill- ings are another source of poisoning. Mercury is a 2 - The Basic Therapy: Forbidden Foods"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Summary of the Gerson Therapy highly toxic heavy metal. However, removing amal- gam fillings can cause temporary mercury poison- ing. So it is best not to eliminate those filings until 6-12 months after going on the program. Beware of gold crowns, which have been placed on top of amalgam fillings! Have them removed later. Sunscreens: Do not use sunscreens. When ex- posed to the sunlight, it is now known that the sun- screen becomes a carcinogen! Sunlight: Do not take too much sunlight. FOODS The Gerson diet is remarkably different than that given to cancer patients in the hospitals of the land. For example, medical experts advise that can- cer patients can eat most anything and do just fine— as long as they have the operation and/or take the chemotherapy. “Once the patient has survived the operation and the convalescence has followed, the diet is very lib- eral and practically without restrictions. Patients who have suffered partial resections of the stom- ach can manage practically the same diet as nor- mal persons.”— Dietotherapy Clinical Application of Modern Nutrition, quoted in Max Gerson, A Can- cer Therapy, p. 57. “Auler (1937-1941) recommended [for cancer] a non-sparing diet, rich in salt and spices, raw meat several times weekly . . Bruenings, Frankfurt a/Main (1930s) recommended a diet poor in carbohydrates and rich in proteins, aided by insulin; he believed in improvement by an acidifying effect.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 55. FOODS TO USE— The Gerson diet is filled with good food! Larger amounts: Because the Gerson diet has fewer calories and digests better, therefore larger and more frequent meals must be served. Cancer has starved the body, and additional food is needed in order for proper rebuilding to occur. Some even eat at night. The primary objective of this diet is to detoxify the entire system, and restore the functions of the liver and the metabolism. In the beginning, some patients may find it difficult to consume all the pre- scribed food and juices. But, in about 2 weeks, af- ter a good detoxification is beginning to take effect, the metabolism should improve and the appetite increase. Individually adapted: So the treatment has to be adapted to how far advanced the malignancy, the flare-ups, and other complications and interferences are. Limited diet: The Gerson diet is limited to cer- tain things. The primary foods are these: • Fresh juices: Juices of fruits, leaves, and veg- etables. • Raw fruit and vegetables: Large quantities either in their natural form, finely grated, or salads of fresh leaves and vegetables. • Stewed fruits and vegetables: Vegetables stewed in their own juice, stewed fruit, potatoes and oatmeal, the special (Hippocrates’) soup, saltless rye bread, oatmeal. Saltless: All must be prepared fresh and with- out added salt. After the first 6-12 weeks, some who feel they need it may wish to add the following dairy prod- ucts: cottage cheese (saltless and creamless), yo- gurt from skimmed milk, buttermilk. (Charlotte Gerson says it is now extremely difficult to find cot- tage cheese, yogurt, and buttermilk which does not have added salt; foods with added salt must not be used.) [ Our note: Although the above paragraph con- tains the recommendation of the Gerson Institute, the reader should be reminded of the danger of re- turning to cancer-causing dairy products.] The restricted Gerson diet provides fresh, natu- ral foods, with no sodium and the highest amount of potassium. It stimulates the elimination of toxic substances from the body. MORE ON FOODS TO USE— Here is additional information on the foods to be used while on the Gerson program: Fresh fruit: F resh (never canned) apples, grapes, cherries, mangoes, peaches, oranges, apri- cots, grapefruit, bananas, tangerines, pears, plums, melons, papayas, persimmons, etc. Stewed fruit: P ears and plums are more easily digested when stewed. Other freshly stewed fruit may also be used. Dried fruit: All types of dried fruit (apricots, peaches, raisins, prunes, mixed fruit) are accept- able—but never sulphured! Wash, soak, and then stew dried fruit before eating it. Flax Oil: Flaxseed oil is very beneficial. —But you must not use any other kind of oil! Flavorings: To vary the flavors, you may also use very small quantities of the following ( but no others! ): Allspice, anise, bay leaves, coriander , dill, fen- nel, mace, marjoram, rosemary , sage, saffron, tar - ragon, thyme, sorrel, summer savory. Spices must be used sparingly, since they may counteract the healing reaction. In larger amounts, chives, onions, garlic and parsley can be used. They often help flavor the food. Raw vegetables: The following raw vegetables"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 may be included in salads. They can be chopped, mixed, finely grated, or eaten separately: Mix raw into salads: a pples with carrots, lettuce, chicory , tomatoes, escarole, cauliflower , romaine, radishes, scallions, endive, knob celery , chives, green peppers. T omatoes are acceptable. “Q. Are tomatoes okay? A. Tomatoes are okay.” — Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 414. Salad dressing: Here is an optional salad dress- ing: Mix 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 2 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, a little diced on- ion, grated horseradish (not bottled). You will find 35 pages of recipes at the back of the Gerson Primer , published by the Gerson Insti- tute. Organic foods: Max Gerson and the Gerson In- stitute urge that all fruits and vegetables be organic. “Cancer is not a local but a general disease, caused chiefly by the poisoning of foodstuffs pre- pared by modern farming and food industry.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 199. “Have vegetables and fruit for the diet and juices been organically grown? Nutrient content of organic produce is often several times that of non-organic produce. Insecticides can stop healing.”— Norman Fritz, added note in 3rd ed., A Cancer Therapy, p. 218. FOODS TO EAT EACH DAY— Here is addi- tional helpful information: Fruit and vegetable juices: Fruit and vegetable juices (in their raw form and in the soups) must be eaten each day—at least in the quantities ordered by the physician. Sometimes doing so may present some difficulties during the reaction period. When reactions occur: When these reactions occur, the patients sometimes ask for raw, uncooked foods or apple juice and raw, grated apples without peel, mixed with finely mashed bananas (whipped with a fork into a light puree). Because of the hypersensitivity of the intestinal tract, even the raw juices must sometimes be mixed with a thin, filtered oatmeal—sometimes mixed half and half. Later, only 2 tablespoons of the liquid oatmeal should be added, until the reaction period is overcome. Apples: Raw, grated apples should be taken in large quantities. When eaten raw, it is best to peel them to ease digestion and reduce gas formation. Apples should be eaten in every form: raw, finely grated, baked, apple sauce, or stewed with raisins. Carrots: Carrots should be used raw, finely grated (best with the same amount of raw grated apple). They should also be cooked, lightly baked, and sprinkled with honey or bread crumbs. Potatoes: Potatoes should be baked in the oven, with their skins on, until they are soft or mashed. The baked potatoes can also be put in a potato salad, with celery salad and lemon juice dressing. They may be eaten with apple sauce or yogurt (when it is all right to eat yogurt). Potato salad: Peel; slice; and, while hot, add dressing to freshly baked potatoes. Sweet Potatoes: Sweet potatoes are permitted once a week (no color added). Oatmeal: Oatmeal is a very good food, and a large portion can be eaten daily. Use old-fashioned oats: Scotch, Irish, or plain Quaker Oats. Use ½ cup oatmeal to 1 cup water. Cook slowly in water until done (about 5 minutes). Eat oatmeal (no milk) with any of following: raw grated apples, brown sugar or honey, blackstrap molasses, stewed prunes, apricots, bananas, apple sauce, raisins, peaches, etc. Bread and flour products: Use some saltless rye bread each day. The following can occasionally be used: brown or wild rice, potato flour, corn starch, barley, lentils, bread crumbs (grate unsalted pumpernickel leftovers). Sugar and sweetening: raw sugar, brown sugar (be careful: not the kind which is white sugar plus added molasses), maple sugar, syrup, light honey, unsulphured molasses. SAMPLE MENU— Here is a sample one-day menu. You may wish to adapt it to your personal prescription: Breakfast 1 glass juice Large portion oatmeal Bread, dark rye, toasted or plain, with pre- scribed honey or stewed fruit (no preservatives) Lunch Salad (raw food) 1 glass warm soup 1 glass juice Large baked potato Vegetables, cooked Dessert: fruit, stewed or raw Supper Salad (raw food) 1 glass warm soup 1 glass juice Large baked potato 2 vegetables, cooked Dessert: fruit, stewed or raw SODIUM-POTASSIUM RATIOS— There is a sodium-potassium chart in Gerson’s book (A Can- cer Therapy, pp. 225-229) which is worth study- ing. You will discover that the good food has more 2 - The Basic Therapy: Foods"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 Summary of the Gerson Therapy potassium than sodium and all the junk food has more sodium than potassium! It is quite obvious that God’s plan was that we eat more potassium than sodium. Here are but a few at the top of the list (from A to C), which are low in sodium and high in potas- sium. Each of them is a natural product from the garden: Dried apricot 11s / 1,700p Banana 5s / 420p Dried navy beans 1s / 1,300p Fresh green beans 0.9s / 300p Frozen green beans 2s / 110p Fresh lima beans 1s / 680p Raw beets 110s / 350p Low sodium commercial bread 76s / 200p Fresh broccoli 16s / 400p Frozen broccoli 13s / 250p Fresh brussels sprouts 11s / 450p Frozen brussels sprouts 9s / 300p Cabbage 5s / 230p Cantaloupe 12s / 230p Caraway seed 17s / 1,400p Dry rolled oats cereal 2s / 340p Here are a few at the top of the list, which are high in sodium. They all are processed in some way: Anchovy paste 9,800s / 200p Baking powder 10,000s / 150p Heinz baked navy beans with tomato sauce 400s / 140p Canned green beans 410s / 120p Canned lima beans 310s / 210p Frozen lima beans 310s / 580p Corned beef 1,30s / 60p Dried beef 4,300s / 200p Raw lean, koshered beef 1,600s / 290p Cultured buttermilk 130s / 140p Candy bars 220s / 150p Canned carrots 280s / 110p Tomato catchup 1,300s / 800p Salt celery 28,000s / 380p All-Bran cereal 1,400s / 1,200p Corn flakes cereal 660s / 160p Wheat flakes cereal 1,300s / 320p Here are a few other samples of processed foods. You may have thought that some of them were safe: Ry-Krisp (probably salted) 1,500s / 600p Cottage cheese 290s / 72s Popped, oiled, salted popcorn 2,000s / 240p Graham crackers 710s / 330p Jell-O 330s / 210p Mayonnaise 5,90s / 25p Meat extract 11,000s / 6,000 Canned mushrooms 400s / 150p Mustard paste 1,300s / 130p Oleomargarine 1, 100s / 58p Green, pickled olives 2,400s / 55p Dill pickles 1,400s / 200p Pretzel (one) 1,700s / 130p Rice flakes 720s / 180p For your information, table salt (pure NaCl) is 39,342s, and baking soda (pure NaHCO 3 ) is 27,373s. As with the entire chart, these figures are based on mg./100 gm. (milligram of the element per 100 grams of the substance being tested). It is of interest that processed breakfast cereals are very high in sodium. Yet people value them; no preparation, pour on the sugar, add some milk, swallow them down quick, rush off to work. “Throughout the survey, it was noted that varia- tions in sodium content were much wider than in potassium content. This was true not only for dif- ferent products, but for different samples of the same product.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 229. So sodium content of junk foods can be much higher than indicated on the food charts! It is easy at the processing plant to dump in more salt—and sell more of the product. The consumers love it. MEDICATIONS - 1— The following special sub- stances (called “medications” by the Gerson Insti- tute) are taken to help the nourishing, cleansing, and healing process. ( Medications - 2 is to be found on pages 27-28.) Flax oil: Dosage: During the first month of therapy, take 2 tablespoons a day; thereafter take 1 tablespoon. Store the Barlean’s Flax Oil bottle in the freezer. When taking it out, set it on the table for about 20 minutes. Then shake it, and pour off about 1 cup- ful into a 1 pint wide-mouth glass jar. Put the Barlean’s bottle back in the freezer, and keep the pint jar in the refrigerator until it is used up. Make sure your source of supply keeps their flaxseed oil refrigerated. If necessary, order it by mail. Barlean’s Flax Oil is the best brand, and is cold- pressed (address given later in Gerson Supply Sources .) It is the very best dietary oil there is, and is sometimes referred to as linseed oil. However, the linseed oil available in a paint store is not what you want to eat! (Although made from flax seed, it is a crude, dirty, oxidized product, with added poi- sonous chemicals.) Flaxseed oil is the best source of lenolenic acid, and helps the body lower choles- terol and utilize vitamin A."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 Potassium: This is a 10% solution of potassium. Dosage: First 3-4 weeks: 4 tsp. solution in each of 10 orange, carrot/apple, and green-juice cups daily. (10 x 4 tsp. daily [=10 times a day, 2 tsp. each time]). Thereafter: 10 x 2 tsp. for 20 weeks, then 8 x 2 for 12 weeks; then 6 x 2 for the duration of treat- ment. Here is how to work with it at home: Place one 100-gm. container of potassium compound salts into a one-quart glass jar, and fill to the top with distilled water. Store the bottle in a dark place. It does not need refrigeration. Patients with chronic illnesses showed a marked decrease of potassium, one of the substances im- portant in muscle contraction. Gerson found that increasing the potassium in the body was extremely important in dissolving tumors. Those who are se- riously ill need many months, sometimes as much as two years, to restore normal potassium content to the vital organs. For more on this, see Gerson’s A Cancer Therapy, pp. 207-208. “Then we gave the patients large amounts of potassium. It took about 300 experiments until I found the right potassium combination. It is a 10% solution of potassium gluconate, potassium phos- phate (monobasic), and potassium acetate. From that solution the patient is given four teaspoons10 times a day in juices. That large amount of potas- sium is introduced into the body.” —Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 409. Niacin: Dosage: 50 mg. at least 6 times daily for 6 months. In advanced cases, Gerson used 50 mg. every hour around the clock. It is very important that niacin be taken from the beginning in sufficient amounts, without too much interruption, and only slowly diminished (not before 5-6 months). It helps restore glycogen into the liver cells, aids protein metabolism, and opens small arteries and capillaries. It also increases the electrical potentials in the cells. This is a B vitamin, and very important in the elimination of cancer. Do not substitute niacinamide for it! Niacinamide does not accomplish the needed results. Reactions (flushing, hot, red skin for a couple minutes, caused by the niacin) are tempo- rary and harmless. Possible minor bleeding is no cause for concern,—but it should be discontinued during menses or in case of hemorrhage. (To avoid heat reactions, dissolve the tablet on the tongue af- ter a meal or take in a glass of juice.) “The results can be further improved by adding niacin which dilates the capillaries and in that way is helpful in the exchange between serum and cells. Niacin is also necessary for the function of the oxi- dation system.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 32. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid): This is used in the Gerson therapy during infections. A crystalline (pow- dered) form such as Bronson’s is preferred. Supple- mental vitamin C should not normally be necessary, since there is so much in the Gerson diet. A daily dose of 1 to 1 ½ grams are permissible. Royal Jelly: This is optional. Dosage: 100 mg. in capsules or honey, ½ hour before breakfast. Do not take with hot food. Bee Pollen: Initial dosage: ½ tsp. per day. This can be used in treating cancer from about the 10th to 12th week. Non-cancer patients may start ear- lier. Some may have allergies to bee pollen. FOODS TEMPORARILY FORBIDDEN— Ac- cording to the Gerson Institute, the following should be added at (but not before) the 6th to 8th week of full treatment: milk, cheese, butter, fish, meat, eggs. [ Our comment: It would be better to avoid meat and dairy products entirely, since livestock and chickens frequently have cancerous masses in their bodies. As he concurred in the above view about animal proteins, in his lengthy research work, Max Gerson recognized that meat and dairy products can intensify and even cause a regrowth of cancer. Consider these three statements:] “As for nutrition, it is necessary to keep away all substances from the sick body which can produce allergic and other biologically stronger reactions (such as fats, animal proteins, vitamins—except vitamin C and niacin—and hormones, because they counteract the normal allergic healing reaction which is so necessary in the beginning to kill the tumor tissue.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 136-137. “Further experiments showed that cod liver oil and other oils and fats, including egg yolks and cream also had a carcinogenic capacity—in these advanced cases.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 220. “She had cancer of the breast which regrew. Ev- ery time the family insisted that she was ‘so much down’ [in weight]. She weighed only 78 pounds. She was skin and bones and they wanted me to give her egg yolks. I gave her small amounts of egg yolks—the cancer regrew. Then they insisted that I give her meat, raw chopped meat. I gave her this and the cancer regrew. The third time, they wanted me to give her some oil. I gave her the oil and the third time the cancer regrew. But, anyway, three times I could eliminate the cancer again and cure.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 405. FOOD PREPARATION PURCHASE OF FOOD— Do not buy carrots, fruits, or vegetables which are in plastic bags. Food- 2 - The Basic Therapy: Food Preparation"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 Summary of the Gerson Therapy grade plastics often have added preservative chemi- cals to keep the food “looking fresher.” You will find this in items in plastic that are prepacked in small quantities. Do not buy potatoes or oranges to which color has been added. Try to buy “organic” produce. Sprayed insecti- cides (poisons) cannot be removed by washing, as they have been taken up by the roots, from the soil, and absorbed into the plant and fruit. KITCHEN EQUIPMENT TO USE— Stainless steel, glass, enamel, earthenware, cast iron, and tin- ware is acceptable. Use the Norwalk juicer or two other machines which do the same task: a grinder (triturator) which grinds the vegetables and fruit, and a press (prefer- ably stainless steel) which presses juice from the ground pulp. (A detailed list of sources will be found later under Gerson Supply Sources. ) KITCHEN EQUIPMENT NOT TO USE— Do not use pressure cookers or steam cookers, aluminum pots or pans. Avoid anything else made of alumi- num. Do not use a centrifugal juicer (the kind which whirl in a circle, throwing the juice outward). Do not use one-piece juicers such as liquifiers, centri- fuges, juice mixers, or juice masters. These cause the juice to be oxidized, and render it unfit for the remedial treatment of cancer. (But centrifugal juic- ers are permitted by Gerson Institute for non-can- cerous conditions.) “They had to drink orange juice, grapefruit juice, and apple and carrot juice. This had to be pro- duced in a special machine—a grinder and a sepa- rate press—because I found that in centrifugal juic- ers or liquefiers, I couldn’t obtain the kind of juice which cured patients.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 405-406. “At first, I had thought that liquefiers would be the most wonderful thing. All the material was there, nothing was lost. But it didn’t work. Then I found out through a physicist that in the liquefier, in the center, there is positive electricity and in the fluid there is negative electricity. This electricity kills the oxidizing enzymes. And that is also true for the centrifugal juicer and the other apparatus. The juice must therefore be made by a grinder and a sepa- rate press—if possible, made of stainless steel.”— Op. cit., p. 406. “Centrifugal machines in which air has insuffi- cient access to the grinding process, cannot be used. When the grinding wheel rotates against a resis- tance with insufficient access of air, positive elec- tricity is produced and induces negative electricity on the surrounding wall. The exchange of the posi- tive and negative electricity kills the oxidizing en- zymes and renders the juice deficient.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 217. JUICES— Juices must be prepared fresh. It is best if they are drunk the same day. If not drunk immediately, the juices must be quickly refrigerated. Place the refrigerated juices in 8-oz. screw-on glasses. This reduces oxidation to the minimum. Start with smaller amounts of juices, and gradually increase the quantity. Here are the types of juices which can be used, and always in 8-oz. servings: Apple and carrot / green leaf / orange / grape / grapefruit / tomato / apple. Never place Lugol’s solution in green leaf juice. How fresh must the juice be? Some Gerson sources say it can be stored in the refrigerator in pint jars for three days. However, for terminal cases which are being treated, the situation is far differ- ent: “We often find that patients are helped by per- sons who have to leave the house to go to work at a certain time and, therefore, prepare most of the day’s juice supply in advance and the evening sup- ply upon their return home. This renders the juices largely ineffective, for the following reasons: “(1) Juices consist of living matter with active ferments, fast neutralizing oxidizing enzymes, which are most necessary for the sick body. “(2) The body needs an equilibrium of active oxidizing enzymes, supplied throughout the day. These cannot be maintained active except by freshly pressed juices, given at hourly intervals.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 216. “Q. Can too much vegetable juice cause alkalin- ity? A. No.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 418. PREPARATION OF CARROT AND APPLE JUICE— Use apples and carrots in equal portions. Wash apples, without peeling them. Cut and remove core with seeds. Wash carrots, but do not scrape them. Then run them through a grinder and, after that, through the press. (More information on how to make carrot juice, using a Norwalk juicer, is given on page 25.) If the patient has to go back to work, apple and carrot juice only may be taken and kept in a ther- mos no longer than 2 to 3 hours (when the juice cannot be kept in a refrigerator). Certain types of apples juice better and produce better results: “Tart applies (McIntosh, pippin, Granny Smith, winesap, etc.) [should be] used for juices when pos- sible, rather than ‘delicious’ apples.”— Norman Fritz, 3rd ed., A Cancer Therapy, p. 218."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"NORWALK INSTRUCTIONS— SUPPLIES — In addition to Norwalk equip- ment : 2 or 3 1 qt pyrex cups (1 for pulp and 1-2 for juice [if not working rapidly at mul- tiple duties, will only need 2 cups, total]), baking tray to lay cloths in, carrot tray , wet rag or two for spills, washed vegetable s (assuming here only carrots), juice jars , 2 zip- lock bags ASSEMBLY (pp 6-8) — 1 - Install and arrange everything • Install grid on top and push to back of grid slide 2 - Plug in / Turn on switch PULPING — 1 - Fill 1 qt (4-cup) pyrex cup with pulp (will make about 3 cups of juice).

Do not use any juicer into which the half orange is inserted with the skin. This is because the skin is also pressed out, it emits harmful fatty acids and aromatic sub- stances from its surface. Do not use an aluminum juicer. PREPARATION OF GREEN LEAF JUICE— Ob- tain as many of the various kinds of green leaves, listed below, as possible. But do not use any other types. Lettuce, red cabbage leaves (2-3 leaves), beet tops (young inner leaves), swiss chard, escarole, endive, romaine, green pepper (1/4 of small one). [ Our note: Beet greens and swiss chard have a lot of oxalic acid, whereas kale and collards are both very nutritious—have less oxalic acid. For some rea- son, unknown to us, the Gerson Institute favors the first two and not the second two. Kale and collards are especially nutritious garden greens.] When grinding, add 1 medium apple for each glass of green juice. The grinding process: Grind twice (unless grinder has a fine grind, able to grind fine and al- most liquify the pulp), press, and drink immedi- ately. (The Norwalk has the correct grid, so grind- ing needs be done only once.) The pressing process: Take 1 or 2 coarsely wo- ven cloths—nylon, about 12\" square. Place a cupful of pulp into center of the moistened cloth and fold in thirds in both directions; then turn it upside down, lay in press, and let it squeeze out the juice. Rinse the cloths after each juice preparation. Each night boil the cloths in soapy water, and rinse thoroughly. Keep the machine clean. On page 25, the present writer, who has a Norwalk juicer and regularly uses it, presents his own findings on how to use this valuable machine. Even better: Contact the Gerson Institute and pur- chase their video (by Charlotte Gerson) on how, in the kitchen, to prepare the vegetables and make salad, special soup, and the juices in a Norwalk. PREPARATION OF COOKED VEGETABLES— Vegetables must be cooked slowly, over an open flame, and without the addition of water. This slow cooking process is important. It preserves the most nutrients and flavors, and makes them more digest- ible. Fast cooking bursts the cells and causes the minerals to leave their colloidal composition and become more difficult for the intestines to absorb. A steel mat may be placed over the fire to re- duce the heat still more, and prevent the pan from burning. (Asbestos mats are toxic and are best not used.) If more fluid is needed in the pan, add a little of the special Hippocrates’ soup, tomatoes, or apple slices. Do not use spinach water, for it has too much oxalic acid. Stew tomatoes, leeks, and onions in their own juices because they have so much residual fluid. Cook potatoes in their jackets in water; do the same with red beets. Carefully wash and clean all vegetables. Do not peel or scrap them, for important mineral salts are just beneath the surface. The cooking pot must not be aluminum, must close tightly, have heavy, well-fitting lids, and be tightly covered—to prevent the escape of steam. When raw fruit or vegetables are shredded or finely grated, they must be used fresh and as quickly as possible. Do not store raw food after it has had any kind of preparation done to it. Patients should only have freshly cooked foods. (But we are also told that, if the food has been cooked (soup and fruit), it may be kept in the re- frigerator for up to 48 hours.) “Cooked vegetables must be prepared in an ap- petizing manner. It must be borne in mind that a complete change in the accustomed taste is in- volved; therefore, vegetables must be prepared with much care and imagination. It is not possible just to omit water, salt, fat, condiments, etc. Vegetables can be made tasty by means of fresh and dried herbs and different fruits.”— Max Gerson, A Can- cer Therapy, p. 217. PREPARATION OF SPECIAL SOUP (HIPPO- CRATES’ SOUP)— For one person, use a 2-quart pot and the following vegetables, then cover with water: 1 medium celery knob (If not in season, use 3-4 stalks of branch celery; pascal celery is preferable.) 1 medium parsley root 2 small leeks (substitute 2 small onions) 2 medium onions Little parsley 1 ½ lbs. tomatoes or more 1 lb. potatoes Garlic may be used at liberty for cooking or squeezed fresh into hot soup. Do not peel any of these vegetables, but wash and scrub them well, cut them coarsely, cook slowly for 3 hours, then put through a food mill in small portions; scarcely any fibers should be left. Vary the amount of water used for cooking according to taste and desired consistency. Let the soup cool before storing. Keep it well- covered in the refrigerator for no longer than 2 days. Warm up as much as needed each time. “Hippocrates . . gave these patients a special"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27 soup. I should like to tell you, we use that soup at the present time! That soup from that book, out of the practice of Hippocrates—550 years before Christ! . . He [Hippocrates] had the idea that the patient has to be detoxified with the soup and with some enemas and so on.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 404. The Gerson Institute recommends purchasing a Foley Food Mill, obtainable from the houseware department at a store, for making the special soup. PREPARATION OF PEPPERMINT TEA— Add one tablespoon dried peppermint leaves to 2 cups (1 pint) boiling water. Let it boil for 5 minutes, then strain. Add brown sugar or honey and/or a little lemon juice, to taste. This should be used when food is not well-toler- ated, in case of indigestion or during reaction pe- riod (flare-ups), nausea, or gas. MEDICATIONS - 2— Here are the other special substances (called “medications” by the Gerson In- stitute) which are taken to help the nourishing, cleansing, and healing process. ( Medications - 1 is listed on pages 22-23.) Lugol’s Solution: Dosage: First 3-4 weeks only: 3 drops in each of 6 orange and carrot/apple juices (6 x 3 daily). Never put Lugol in green juice! This is the way that an additional intake of io- dine is obtained by the body. Lugol’s is always used in half-strength, and only during the first weeks of therapy. Lugol’s solution contains 5% iodine and 10% potassium iodide in water. In order to fight cancer, it is vital that both io- dine and potassium be increased in the body. Io- dine (its chemical name is “I”) is part of the positive minerals traveling to the negative pole, or negative tissues, while potassium (K) is the leading mineral of the negative group traveling to the positive pole or tissues. To help the cells function, the minerals must be activated or ionized. In the Gerson therapy, iodine is administered in two forms: Lugol’s solution and thyroid. A larger dose (as described above) of Lugol’s is favorable in inhibiting any excessive cancer growth. For more information on this, see pp. 205-206 of Cancer Therapy, by Gerson. Read this remarkable testimony: “At the same time [we gave] 5 times [a day] of one grain of thyroid and 6 times three drops of Lugol’s solution, ½ strength. That’s 18 drops of Lugol’s which is a large dose. Nobody was observed to develop heart palpitations from that, even if some patients told me that they could previously not take thyroid because they would develop heart palpita- tion. And all allergies disappeared! Some patients claimed that they could previously not take one teaspoonful of lemon juice or orange juice—they were allergic. But when they are well detoxified and have plenty of potassium, they are not allergic. Al- lergies and other hypersensitivities are elimi- nated.” —Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 409. “Since 1938, after several setbacks, I have been able to develop a more successful therapy by add- ing . . iodine medication, first in organic form as thyroid, and later also in inorganic mineral, in Lugol’s solution . . Iodine is a decisive factor in the normal diferentiation of cells, and can be used in order to counteract the decrease of cell differentia- tion as seen in the cancerous tissues.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 32. Thyroid: Dosage: First 3-4 weeks only: 5 x 1 grain daily [5 times a day, 1 grain each time]. Dos- age is best adjusted by physician. It is generally re- duced downward, often frequently. Tachycardia [pulse over 120] may indicate overdosage. Discon- tinue temporarily during menses. “When introduced into the system, thyroid and Lugol’s solution go immediately into the cancer mass. These ripe [cancer] cells take it up fast and they perhaps grow a little faster but they soak in more with great greed—as much as they can—to- gether with a little bit of sodium, probably. But there isn’t much sodium left. So then these cells pick up potassium and the oxidizing enzymes and die by themselves. You have to realize that cancer cells live essentially on fermentation, but potassium and oxidizing enzymes introduce oxidation. And that is the point at which we can kill cancer cells, be- cause we take away the conditions which they need to continue to live.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 409. Acidol Pepsin: If you find that you need this, take it before meals, not during or after! These cap- sules provide supplemental hydrochloric acid, which is needed to help your stomach break down protein foods. Pancreatin: Dosage: 3 tablets 4 times daily or according to need. This amount is later reduced. Some do not tolerate pancreatin well, but most ben- efit with less digestive trouble, gas spasms, and less difficulty regaining weight and strength. Liver Extract (crude) and B 12 : This is given by injection. Dosage: 3 cc liver and 1/10 cc B 12 com- bined in a single syringe, injected into gluteous medius daily, for 4-6 months or more. [ Our note: It is best that a professional teach you how to do this. A person needs to know where to inject into the buttocks, because a vein or the sciatic nerve might be penetrated! See “Instructions for Giving Injec- tions,” later in this section. Those who go to the Gerson Institute are carefully taught how to do this, 2 - The Basic Therapy: Food Preparation"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 Summary of the Gerson Therapy before they leave for home.] Vitamin B 12 helps amino acids combine to form proteins, a function which is not working properly in people with cancer. Liver was added to the formula because of the continually lowered quality of fresh fruits and veg- etables. ( Our note: So liver is not needed to save the lives of terminal patients, if good quality pro- duce can be obtained.) “Dr. Max Gerson added raw liver juice to his di- etary therapy in 1950 to compensate against a downturn in nutritional qualities of fresh fruits and vegetables, on which his therapy had relied since its introduction in the early part of the century. Modern fertilization and pest control techniques have resulted in foods toxic and inferior to those grown by more intelligent methods.”— Appendix 3, A Cancer Therapy, p. 421. Special note: In October 1989, the Gerson In- stitute stopped using raw liver because it was so contaminated with bacteria. Desiccated liver tab- lets now replace it, taken with carrot juice. “Carrot juice replaces liver juice in all U.S. pa- tient schedules, each glass supplemented by two 500 mg. desiccated liver tablets and two tablets of spirulina.”— Appendix 3, A Cancer Therapy, p. 421. Coffee enemas: Dosage: first six weeks mini- mum: every 4 hours. While lying on right side, re- tain for 12-15 minutes. For limited periods of time, where there is pain, these enemas may be used as often as every two hours. However, physician should monitor serum electrolytes frequently. (See three sections below: Coffee Enemas, Preparing the En- ema Mixture, and Taking the Enema .) Castor oil: Dosage: Every other day, take 2 tbsp. by mouth, and five hours later a castor oil and soap enema. Later, as necessary or as prescribed. (See Taking the Castor Oil Enema, below.) Other Gerson-prescribed medications: There are three other items which Gerson physicians may prescribe, in order to assist the patient in absorb- ing food nutrients, or cleansing the tissues. These include Acidol (hydrochloric acid), ox bile (a liver aid), and Ion Min (a clay powder). These Gerson medicines are used to aid the body in absorbing nutrients and expelling toxins. Because they are medicines, later they will no longer be needed. People who are well do not take medicine. Lab tests: Blood chemistry, Complete blood count, T3, T4 [T3 and T4 are thyroxin tests], Uri- nalysis. All tests should be taken before beginning treatment and at 4-6 week intervals for at least the first 6 months. Test results may be affected by heal- ing reactions and flare-ups. If you are a Gerson Institute patient, mail or fax copies of all blood works to them. Details are ex- plained in the Gerson Primer. Medications prescribed by other physicians: You may be taking medications prescribed by regu- lar physicians. It is recommended that you not abruptly discontinue any medications you were tak- ing prior to using the Gerson therapy. In certain cases, Gerson-trained physicians will advise gradual discontinuance. DETOXIFICATION PHYSIOLOGY OF COFFEE ENEMAS— Prepar- ing and taking a coffee enema will be discussed just after this section. Here is the physiological effect of a coffee enema: “The effect is an increased production of bile, an opening of the bile ducts and greater flow of bile. At the start of the treatment and during flare- ups, the bile contains poisons, produces spasms in the duodenum and small intestines, and causes some overflow into the stomach, with resultant feel- ings of nausea or even vomiting of bile. In these cases, great amounts of peppermint tea are neces- sary to wash out bile from the stomach. Thereafter patients feel better and more comfortable.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy. [A Cancer Therapy, p. 191.] It is an interesting fact that coffee, when drunk by mouth, has a totally different physiological ef- fect on the body,—one which is quite negative. “A cup of coffee taken by mouth has an entirely different effect . . It heightens the reflex response, lowers the blood pressure, increases heart rate, per- spiration, causes insomnia and heart palpita- tion.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 191. Max Gerson has found that a diluted coffee so- lution, taken in the form of a low enema, produces none of the negative physiological effects, named above—which drinking coffee by mouth always does. In connection with this, please note that Gerson and the Gerson Institute always give low enemas, never high colonics, which fill the entire bowel, and only for 12-15 minutes at a time. “High colonics cannot be administered, because too much of the sodium from the mucous mem- brane in the colon is washed out.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 194. Cleaning out the accumulated poisons in the system is extremely important. “In the beginning, the most important part of the therapy is an intensive detoxification of the en- tire body.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 193."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29 “In more advanced cases it takes a long time, about one to one and a half years, to restore the liver as near as possible to normal. For the first few weeks or months, the liver has to be consid- ered as weak and unable to resume its normal func- tions, especially that of detoxification and of reac- tivation of the oxidizing enzymes. For that reason, it is necessary to help the liver with the continua- tion of coffee enemas and castor oil treatments in a slowly diminishing degree, according to the ad- vanced condition of the disease. We have to bear in mind that there are still unripe cancer tissues in the body.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 196. In practice, Gerson found that the enemas were indispensable, if he wanted to clean out the tumor and totally rid it from the body, while, at the same time, protecting the integrity of the very important liver. “ I lost several patients by coma hepaticum [un- consciousness induced by a poisoned liver], since I did not know, and therefore neglected, the vital importance of frequent and regularly continued elimination of poisonous substances, with the help of juices, enemas, etc.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 191. The pain-relieving effect of coffee enemas is as- tounding. The enema removes the poisons from the liver so it, the liver, can better clean the blood (all the blood passes through it every three minutes). It is the accumulated poisons in the system which cause the generalized pain of cancer! “Difficult as this may be to believe, experience has proved that frequent enemas completely elimi- nate the need for sedation.”— Max Gerson, A Can- cer Therapy, p. 191. PREPARING THE ENEMA MIXTURE— It is very important for all fluids which are placed in the rectum to be sterile. Use only boiled , distilled wa- ter in making the coffee and for the enema water. Make sure it is cooled to body temperature be- fore using. 1 - Here is the Gerson preferred coffee en- ema recipe: This recipe is to be used total strength! Do not dilute it! Take 3 tablespoons of ground (drip) coffee (not instant!) to 1 quart distilled water. Boil it for 5 min- utes, with the lid off. (This drives off oils from the coffee.) Then cover the pan, lower the heat, and sim- mer an additional 15 minutes. Strain and allow to cool. Add enough distilled water to make a full quart. Use at body temperature. 2 - Alternate coffee recipe: Instead of a freshly made mixture, this formula uses a coffee concen- trate. It is recommended that it only be used as an alternative to the above recipe for convenience when traveling. Three rounded tablespoons of coffee are to be used per 1 quart enema. A concentrate of correct proportion is prepared in this manner: 1. Place 1 cup (12 rounded tablespoons) fine or drip ground coffee into a sauce pan. 2. Add 1 quart distilled water. 3. Boil 5 minutes, uncovered. 4. Cover, lower heat and simmer 20 minutes or more. 5. Strain into a one-quart jar, allowing the grounds to drain well. 6. Add distilled water, to make a full quart. 7. Mark the jar for convenience with tape or paint, indicating one cup increments. (Home canning jars have markings.) This is enough concentrate for 4 enemas (one cup concentrate plus 3 cups boiled, distilled per enema). Multiply recipe to prepare additional con- centrate at one time. This will keep up to 2 days in the refrigerator. Using the coffee concentrate: 1. Put the following into the bucket: 1 Cup (8 oz.) coffee concentrate 3 Cups (24 oz.) distilled water The fluid should be warm enough to make solution body temperature. Apply the enema, following instructions given just below. Be sure to boil all fluids before placing them in the rectum . The fluid should be given at body temperature. TAKING THE ENEMA— Here are several brief instructions on the actual taking of the enema and its frequency: “In practice, it seems necessary to apply frequent coffee enemas, four to six times in 24 hours; in more advanced cases every four hours day and night—or even more in the first two weeks.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 193. “Always keep the pot with the distilled water on the warmer. It will not boil and will always be ready. “If your bucket’s plastic hose becomes kinked, run a small amount of hot water through it to soften it. “[1] The coffee solution should be body tempera- ture. [2] Run a little of the solution through the tube into the toilet to warm the tube; close the stop- cock. “[3] Lubricate, about 2 inches of, rectal end of enema tube with petroleum jelly [Vasoline]. [4] Hang enema bucket not over 2 feet above you. “[5] Laying on the right side, draw both legs close to the abdomen, relax and breathe deeply. “[6] Insert tube into rectum 5-8 inches. Open stopcock and allow fluid to run in very slowly to avoid cramping. Retain solution 12-15 minutes. 2 - The Basic Therapy: Detoxification"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 Summary of the Gerson Therapy “[7] Do not place tube back into bucket until you have thoroughly cleaned it (using biodegradable food-use detergent, then rinsing well). Rinse daily, or as often as needed, with hydrogen peroxide 3%. The bucket and tube are very good growing grounds for bacteria.” —Gerson Primer, 3rd ed., p. 3. “At the same time [that the coffee enemas are given], a castor oil treatment is applied every other day, consisting of two tablespoons of castor oil . . and five hours later a castor oil enema.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 193-194. The next two sections deal with castor oil. TAKING CASTOR OIL BY MOUTH— Here is the formula for this: “Every other day, 2 tablespoons of castor oil are given by mouth at about 5:30 a.m.” —Gerson Primer, 3rd ed., p. 3. Gerson Institute recommends that a cup of black coffee (coffee without cream or sugar) with raw sugar in it, be drunk immediately afterward. It is said that this will stimulate the stomach to empty the castor oil quickly into the intestine. [ Our note: There are those who are quite successful in taking the castor oil without following it with a drink of coffee. Notice that, in the following statement, Gerson calls drink- ing coffee a possible alternate procedure.] “Some patients do not tolerate castor oil well after breakfast. An alternate protocol is as follows: 7 a.m.—2 large tablespoons castor oil, 1 cup cof- fee with brown sugar—7:05 a.m., coffee enema.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 247. [ Our note: Keep in mind that coffee taken by mouth produces significant physiological harm.] “A cup of coffee taken by mouth has an entirely different effect . . It heightens the reflex response, lowers the blood pressure, increases heart rate, per- spiration, causes insomnia and heart palpita- tion.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 191. TAKING CASTOR OIL BY ENEMA— This pro- cedure is done 5 hours after taking the castor oil: “At about 10:30 a.m., 5 hours after your castor oil by mouth, the castor oil enema . . [is taken]. The castor oil should be poured down the enema tube first. Insert and instill the castor oil until no more remains in the bucket. Close the plastic ring. Add the 8 oz. of coffee concentrate and 16 oz. of distilled water at body temperature. As the warmed solution flows though the tube, it will wash the bal- ance of the castor oil into the intestinal tract. You may retain this for a short time, but it is not re- quired.” —Gerson Primer, 3rd ed., p. 3. For optimum results, swish a bar of non-deter- gent soap in the bucket, This will help the castor oil mix with the water better. DEALING WITH PAIN In the later stages of cancer, there is much pain. There is likely to also be pain in the first few weeks on the Gerson program. Max Gerson discovered that this was caused by the high volume of poisons in the system. He found—quite consistently!—that coffee enemas and castor oil not only helped the liver, but also greatly reduced the pain. PAIN TRIAD— However, in the first few weeks of treatment, the pain can become severe since the tumor is breaking down and so many toxic sub- stances are circulating through the body. When needed, the Gerson specialists give three sub- stances, which they call the “pain triad.” “For cancer patients, even in advanced stages, pain relief was promptly obtained by the use of cof- fee enemas, given every two hours in some cases. In the first few days of the therapy, it was some- times necessary to add ‘pain relief.’ In these cases, Dr. Gerson allowed the use of the following, used together: one tablet of aspirin (5 gr .), one vitamin C (100 mg .) and one niacin (50 mg .) up to four times in the course of 24 hours. [You will note below, that the Gerson Institute has changed this dosage some- what.] “These ‘three pills’ also produced restful sleep. Their action is surprisingly effective once spasms and edema are eliminated through large doses of potassium given immediately at the start of the treatment with detoxification. “The relief obtained through the use of the con- stantly given coffee enemas is quickly noted by the patients and they often voluntarily take more than the number prescribed.”— Charlotte Gerson, Ap- pendix 1, A Cancer Therapy, p. 397. Several years later, the Gerson Institute pub- lished its Gerson Primer, in which the triad formula was slightly changed, by increasing the vitamin C dosage: “Pain triad. The triad should be used sparingly. Do not exceed 6 dosages in a 24-hour period un- less prescribed by your physician: “ 50 mg . niacin / 500 mg . ascorbic acid / 5 gr . aspirin. “The pain triad becomes progressively more ef- fective as the body undergoes detoxification [elimi- nation of poisons through enemas]. It can be used at bedtime to assist in going to sleep for those pa- tients with substantial pain.”— Gerson Primer, 3rd ed., p. 11 . CASTOR OIL PACK FOR PAIN— Another Gerson aid in counteracting pain is the castor oil pack. This is used during severe flare-ups involv- ing liver pain, spasms in the bile system, or strong"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 pain elsewhere. This treatment can also be used by arthritic patients who have swollen, painful joints. Although messy, when used on the hands and feet, it is still very effective. “1. Soak 3 pieces of white flannel with castor oil. Squeeze out excess castor oil. “2. Place flannel over liver or other affected area. “3. Place slightly larger sheet of plastic over the flannel. “4. Use medium temperature heating pad over area. Do not let the pack get cold or uncomfortably hot. “5. Keep it on for 1 to 1 ½ hours. Apply it every four hours. You can reuse the castor oil pack.” — Gerson Primer, 3rd ed., p. 11. HYDROTHERAPY FOR PAIN— Another Gerson treatment for pain is water therapy. This can be in the form of a hot tub bath or hot fomentations (hot, damp cloths) laid over the painful area. Hydro- therapy treatments are excellent for dulling and calming the pain. They also assist in improving blood and lymphatic circulation. But patients with nervous system disease (such as multiple sclero- sis) should not receive high temperatures. Cool com- presses are better for them. (For detailed instructions on hydrotherapy treat- ments, see the present writer’s 294-page book, The Water Therapy Manual ; $9.95+$1.50.) HEAT ABOVE THE ABDOMEN FOR UPSET INTESTINAL TRACT— A heating pad can be placed over the abdomen. This tends to calm the irritated, hyperactive intestinal tract. CHAMOMILE TEA ENEMA FOR UPSET IN- TESTINAL TRACT— Place 4 tbsp. dried chamomile flowers in 1 quart water. Boil 5 minutes and sim- mer for 10 minutes. Strain. Use it when it has cooled to body temperature. Use full strength, and give just before a regularly scheduled coffee enema. Retain the tea for about 5 minutes. Upon releasing it, start the coffee enema. In severe cases, chamomile con- centrate can be added to all coffee enemas. Here is how to make chamomile concentrate: Mix 1 cup dried chamomile flowers in 2 cups (1 pint) distilled water. Simmer 30 minutes in covered saucepan. Strain and press the flowers to extract all the liquid. Add enough distilled water to bring the total again to 1 pint. Keep in closed glass jar not longer than 3 days. To use it: Pour 4 oz. concen- trate into enema bucket; then fill with distilled wa- ter. POTASSIUM ADDED TO ENEMA WATER— Another helpful tip is to add 2 tbs. potassium com- pound to each enema bucket. This will help relieve spasms and help promote bile flow. But it should be discontinued after 10 to 14 days. FLARE-UPS AND REACTIONS— The dissolv- ing of the tumor causes a toxic buildup. As efforts are made to detoxify the body, reactions occur. Sud- den, stronger reactions—known as flare-ups—may occur. It is encouraging to know, when these hap- pen, that they are signals that the body is gradually throwing off the poisons. Here is a description of some of them: Aches, pains, sore muscles and joints, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. There may be diarrhea, pain, chills, fever, foul odors, depression, and/or jaundice. Here are a few suggestions; more are to be found in The Gerson Primer, pp. 14-15, and A Cancer Therapy, pp. 201-203 . (If a person is serious about going on the Gerson program, he should either go to the Gerson Institute and/or consider purchasing those two books. At the back of the Primer are 35 pages of recipes.) Aches, pains, sore muscles and joints: Use clay packs, castor oil packs, hydrotherapy, the pain triad, and bed rest. Usually not over 24-48 hours. Nausea: Increase intake of peppermint tea and oatmeal. Possibly reduce the intake of other solid foods or exchange them for grated and mashed food. May last several days. Vomiting: Greatly increase peppermint tea in- take to as much as a gallon or more. Substitute oatmeal for regular meals. Generally less than 24 hours. Diarrhea: Potassium gluconate (1/8 tsp. in tea every 2-4 hours), and clay (1/4 tsp. in tea every 3-6 hours). Usually not over 24-48 hours. Pain: Increase the number of enemas. Use the other pain suggestions mentioned earlier in this section. May signal a flare-up, starting 48-72 hours beforehand; lasting up to 72 hours afterward. Chills and fever: Bed rest for both. Warm baths for chills; cool water rubdown and damp cloth on forehead for fever. If the fever continues to rise, use chamomile enemas, pain triad. Do not let the fever go above 103 o F. A partial fever actually helps burn out—kill—the cancer; but, of course, it does not eliminate the toxic remains. May last 24-48 hours. Foul odors (breath, body odor, smelly en- emas): No special precautions need be taken. Eat garlic, drink extra juice or tea, bathe, change clothes more often, and increase the number of enemas. This generally occurs after a reaction for up to 24- 48 hours. Depression: Provide encouragement; pray with them. A depression may signal a flare-up, for it be- 2 - The Basic Therapy: Pain"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 Summary of the Gerson Therapy gins up to 72 hours ahead of the flare-up, and lasts up to 72 hours afterward. Jaundice: Increase juices and enemas. Gener- ally lasts up to 48 hours after a flare-up. Greater frequency of enemas: It is important to understand that sometimes there must be a re- turn to a strict, intensive program, as carried out during the first 3-4 weeks of the program. CLAY POULTICE— When there is inflammation, stomach or intestinal problems, diarrhea, or toxic overload, clay poultices are helpful. Clay powder is similar to charcoal in its adsorp- tive strength; that is, its ability to pull out toxic sub- stances and lock with them, so they can be carried away. Here is how to apply a clay poultice to a sore or inflamed part of the body: Place a needed amount of clay in just enough hot water to make a paste. To prevent cooling, quickly place it on a square of clean muslin or cot- ton cloth. Lay it on the problem area. Cover with plastic, and place a wool cloth over that. Pin it in place, and leave it on overnight. In the morning, remove it, rub the area with ice or a very cold, wet cloth. Repeat when needed. OTHER POINTS GREEN LEAF TEA ENEMA— This enema is used for localized cleansing. “In cancerous diseases of the colon, we use half a quart of the usual green leaf juice, as prepared for drinking, at body temperature. Let it flow in very slowly and keep as long as possible, since it is best when it is entirely absorbed by the colon. “Where there is a colostomy, we use a catheter and let it flow into the diseased part, very slowly. In diseases of the vagina or cervix, or urine bladder, we let smaller quantities flow into these parts to help rid the body of odorous necrotic [dead] tissue discharges. Little bleedings are no contraindication. This procedure is actually requested by patients as it brings them much relief from pain, discom- fort and offensive odor.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 194-195. MASSAGE— To what degree should cancer pa- tients receive massages, and should they be given over the tumor site? “Q. What do you think of deep manipulation? A. Cancer patients should not be massaged [hard; or over the cancer site]. Rubbing of the skin to open the capillaries and to help the body to stimulate the circulation is very valuable. We give the patient a rub two or three times a day before meals with a solution of ½ glass water with two tablespoons rub- bing alcohol and two tablespoons of wine vinegar. To rub the whole body is very refreshing and helps the circulation.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 418. THE WILL TO LIVE AND PUSH THROUGH— Max Gerson said, “The chief concern is the patient’s will to live and to be cured.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 214. Some do not realize how serious the disease is, and either do not want to bother going on the pro- gram or are quickly satisfied when they see a few good days and go off of it. Some reject the treat- ments outright. Others do not want to give up their present way of life. A few feel hopeless and pessi- mistic. They have experienced so many disappoint- ments in the past, they do not wish to try again. Others have family problems. This may include rela- tives who oppose their being on the program. “People go to hospitals for operations or serious illness; the family considers them recovered upon their return. It is different with cancer. Cancer is a degenerative disease, not an acute one, and the treatment can be effective only if carried out strictly in accordance with the rules for one and a half to two years.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 215. “It is not easy to keep strictly to the treatment if a convalescent patient does not have enough help. In all cases a life is at stake.”— Max Gerson, A Can- cer Therapy, p. 217. “After a remarkable improvement and a renewal of faith and hope, some patients discontinue the treatment because of mistaken advice and family aversion.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 217. We all need faith, love, and encouragement. If you cannot get it from anyone else, I assure you that you can get it from God! Cry to Him as a little child. Tell Him all your troubles. He can strengthen you to push on through to a successful conclusion. And, regardless of how everything ultimately turns out, being with Him and resting in His love is the most important part of all. INSTRUCTIONS FOR GIVING INJECTIONS— If you go to the Gerson Institute, you will receive injections of B 12 and crude liver. While there, they will teach you how to give them to yourself. Upon arriving home, you will probably be administering your own injections. You have a legal right to treat yourself. If you need guidance, find a health profes- sional in your area to help get you started. Here is additional information: These are the items you should have on hand. Alcohol Cotton Syringe Extra needle (Each needle is 25 gauge, and 5/8\" or 1\" length)"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33 Crude liver injection Vitamin B 12 Keep the alcohol, cotton, syringe, and extra needles together on a tray in a clean place, where chil- dren cannot reach it. Either keep it on a high shelf with a clean cloth over it, or in a clean drawer which rodents cannot penetrate. Keep the open liver and B 12 ampules (bottles) in new baggies in refrigerator. Also store unopened liver bottles in refrigerator. 1 . Remove covers: Remove protective metal cov- ers from rubber stopper on either, or both, the crude liver bottle and the vitamin B 12 bottle. 2. Wipe bottle tops: Wipe the top of both bottles clean with alcohol. 3. Keep needle and syringe sterile: Make sure the needle and syringe are kept sterile. This is very important. 4. 3cc air into liver ampule: Draw 3cc of air into the empty syringe. Turn the crude liver bottle upside down and push needle up through center of stopper. Push 3cc of air into crude liver bottle. This will pressurize the ampule and permit easy withdrawal of fluid. Remove needle from crude liver bottle. 5. 1/10cc fluid from B 12 ampule: Turn B 12 bottle upside down and push syringe needle through stop- per. Pull out 1/10cc (just a few drops, to the first small line on the barrel of the syringe). Withdraw needle from B 12 . 6. 3cc from liver ampule: Reinsert syringe needle into inverted crude liver bottle and pull out 3cc of liver extract (pull plunger to first line below 3cc marking to allow for B 12 ). 7. Change needles: Remove and discard needle. It is no longer sharp enough for use in injecting your- self. Screw a new needle into syringe. 8. Prepare syringe for injection: Gently tap the side of the syringe to gather bubbles to the top of the syringe. When bubbles are gathered, press plunger until a tiny bit of fluid spurts from the needle. Sy- ringe is now ready to be used. (Put needle cover on loosely.) 9. Clean injection area: Clean the general injec- tion area well with alcohol and cotton. 10. Locate the specific injection area: How to locate the injection area: Find your waist, put your finger on your waist at the side seam, go down three finger widths, and straight back 3 finger widths, ex- periment by pressing in with a fingernail to find an area about the size of a nickel which has few nerve endings, and doesn’t hurt—that’s where the needle goes. (Each time you give an injection, alternate sides.) 11. Spread skin, inject slowly: Spread skin and push needle in. Push plunger down slowly. 12. Pull, alcohol, cotton: Pull needle out and rub area with alcohol for 30 seconds. If bleeding occurs, press cotton to wound. It will stop bleeding very shortly. 13. Dispose of needles: Break needle and disas- semble syringe. Keep broken needles in a small card- board box. Tape box shut when full and discard. 14. Store alcohol, cotton, syringe, and needles: As mentioned earlier, keep these (along with unopened B 12 ampules) in a clean, safe place. 15. Clean and store ampules: Clean open liver and B 12 bottles with alcohol and store in refrigerator. Protect with fresh baggie after each use. Store un- opened liver extract bottles in refrigerator. +++++++ DIAGRAM OF BUTTOCKS - p 39 +++++++ 3 - Schedules and Supplies: Other Points +++++++ Fundamentals of Nursing - p 1328 +++++++"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"35 WHY DO SOME CANCER PATIENTS DO BET- TER AFTER SURGERY?— The removal of the tu- mor takes away a lot of poisons, and the patient may feel better for a time. But his habits have not changed, his body has not been cleansed, and he has been weakened by a deep wound. Here is Dr. Gerson’s comment: “[Following surgery] Some patients have only temporary damage of the liver and the liver is then able to restore itself. But that is not in a majority of the cases. Sometimes if you remove, say a breast cancer, the removal of these toxins and poisons which the cancer itself generates is sufficient in some cases to relieve the temporary damage from the liver. Then the liver can recover. But these are exceptions. And it is not basic. Also some of these patients get recurrences later. Many of my patients, after an initial operation, had stayed well for three or sometimes even five years. Then the cancer re- curred. They were inoperable and orthodox medi- cine was helpless. [Then they came to me for help.]”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 417. Charlotte Gerson acknowledges that individu- als who have undergone chemotherapy or radiation are so poisoned and weakened thereby that the Gerson therapy is less likely to succeed. HOW TO PREVENT CANCER— Here is how Dr. Gerson answers this question: “Q. How can we prevent cancer? A. Cancer must be prevented by preventing damage to the liver. The basic measure of prevention is not to eat the dam- aged, dead, poisoned food which we bring into our bodies. Every day, day by day, we poison our bod- ies. The older people still have a better liver and resistance from the [better] food they had when they were young. The younger people get worse and the babies, now the second generation on canned baby foods, are still worse. They get leukemias. First of all, eat as much as you can of raw food, keep the potassium level up, and take some iodine.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 418-419. 3 - SCHEDULES AND SUPPLIES Putting it all together SCHEDULES We have seen all the different parts; now it is time to see how it all comes together. INITIAL HOUSE PREPARATION— For those who plan to go to the Gerson Institute for their ini- tial therapy, it is best to have someone do the fol- lowing before completing your stay and returning home: 1 - Locate sources for organic produce, includ- ing organic coffee, and purchase some. 3 - Set up the juicer. 4 - Reorganize the kitchen (see Kitchen Sup- plies section, below). 5 - Remove all aluminum pots and pans. Get all aerosol sprays, air fresheners, perfumed items, in- secticides, paint fumes, and similar materials out of the house. 6 - With the exception of the juicer and cutting boards, clear the kitchen counters. There will need to be room to work. 7 - Make sure the knives are sharp, for much cutting will have to be done. 8 - Locate a source for distilled water and pur- chase some. Better yet, purchase a home distiller. (See later section, Improving Your Water Supply .) 9 - The bedroom and bathroom may need to be arranged, to accommodate the enema taking. If movement is impaired, a bench may be necessary. SAMPLE ENEMA SCHEDULE— Here is a sample daily enema schedule: NORMAL DAYS CASTOR OIL DAYS Morning 5:00 ———— Wake-up 5:30 Wake-up Castor oil by mouth 6:00 Coffee enema Coffee enema 8:00 Breakfast Breakfast 10:00 Coffee enema ———— 10:30 ———— Castor oil enema Afternoon 1:00 Lunch Lunch 2:00 Coffee enema Coffee enema 3:00 6:00 Coffee enema Coffee enema 7:00 Dinner Dinner 10:00 Coffee enema Coffee enema DAILY SCHEDULE— On the previous page you will find two daily schedules. The top one is a sample for a typical patient. However, you might not be the average. Below it is a blank schedule, which you can make photocopies of for personal use. Here is a more detailed schedule for carrying out the Gerson therapy at home: A.M. 7:00 Awake. 7:15 Eat a little fruit. Take coffee enema. 7:45 1 - Start oatmeal and coffee concentrate. 2 - Make citrus juice (with Lugol’s and potassium). 3 - Sort medications for the day. 8:00 Eat breakfast. 8:30 1 - Wash vegetables and fruits to be used for the day’s juices and meals. 2 - Strain the coffee. 3 - Start the Hippocrates’ soup. 9:00 Drink green juice (with potassium). Put veggies in oven, at 150 o F., for lunch. 3 - Schedules and Supplies: Schedules"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"36 Summary of the Gerson Therapy Be sure to use a tightly covered casserole. 9:30 Drink carrot-apple juice (with Lugol’s and potassium). 10:00 Drink carrot-apple juice (with Lugol’s and potassium). 11:00 Carrot juice (with 2 liver tablets) 11:15 Coffee enema P .M. 12:00 1 - Green juice (with potassium) 2 - Prepare lunch. salad vegetables (check oven) Hippocrates’ soup 1:00 Eat lunch.

Coffee enema A.M. 3:00 If it seems best to do so: Eat some fruit. Coffee enema The above schedule is keyed to a regular day on full therapy, which includes 13 8-oz. cups of juice and 5 coffee enemas. However, remember the woman Dr. Gerson mentioned, who was so far gone that he feared to begin treatment,—but she pulled through because she kept taking the coffee enemas every hour or two (instead of only 5 a day), and castor oil enemas twice a day (instead of once every two days). —She kept her liver and bowels so cleaned out that very advanced cancer was not able to take her life (A Cancer Therapy, p. 416). Hers was an extreme case, yet she conquered because she was extremely con- cerned to live. Whoever is doing the kitchen work should al- low about 10-15 minutes to prepare a juice and to clean up the juicer. Therefore, begin making juices about 15 minutes before the hour. In the above list, medications are listed in pa- rentheses after juices. Those medications may be added, if it is thought best to do so. Never exceed total medication totals prescribed by your Gerson physician. SUPPLIES KITCHEN SUPPLIES— In their continuing work to help people recover from cancer, the Gerson In- stitute kindly provides a checklist of kitchen items which will be found useful in caring for a person on the Gerson program. (As with everything else, the most complete collection of such data will be found in books available from the Gerson Institute, espe- cially their Gerson Primer .) Most of the following items may be purchased locally at a general department store, health-food store or hardware store. Appliances Juicer (press type) water distiller Liquid warmer: low temperature burner plate a second refrigerator (optional) Yogurt maker (optional) Orange juicer reamer type Blender (with some recipes, this can be used instead of the rotary food mill) Cookware Stainless steel pots and pans with tight fitting lids l qt. saucepan 2 qt. saucepan 3 qt. saucepan 4 qt. saucepan 8 qt. saucepan Pyrex or Corningware baking dishes (with covers) Note: Teflon and other inert nonstick surfaces are allowed. But do not use damaged pans. (Teflon is rather easily torn away, revealing the poisonous aluminum underneath.) Of course, wherever it might come in contact with food, absolutely no aluminum is to be used. But aluminum-clad stainless steel pots are accept- able.

GERSON SUPPLY SOURCES— Here is a brief summary of Gerson supply sources. Former Gerson hospital patients may obtain some of these items at lower prices, if they so notify the vender. Gerson Institute, Gerson Books and Videos, etc.: Gerson Institute 888-4-GERSON (888- 443-7766) / 619-267-1150 / P .O. Box 430, Bonita, CA 91908. Ask for information on attending the Institute, and a list of their books and videos. Gerson Rx prescriptions and supplies: STAT, S.A., Apartado Postal 2392, Tijuana BCN, Mexico Ph: 011-526-680-1103 Gerson supplies: Baja Hosp. Services, P .O. Box 3535, Chula Vista, CA 91911 Ph: 619-425- 1557. Here are examples of what is meant by “supplies”: Lugol’s [iodine] solution, potas- sium compound, potassium gluconate, acidol [HCl], niacin, flaxseed oil, castile soap, enema buckets, food mill, etc. Some of these supplies (such as Lugol’s) would be difficult to obtain elsewhere. Organic foods: Gerson emphasizes eating, if at all possible, organically grown fruits and vegetables. In order to learn whether this is feasible in your area, and if you can afford them, you may wish to contact OFPANA, Box 1078, Greenfield, MA, 10301; Ph: (413) 774- 7511. Or you can order a U.S. directory of sources: The book is called Organic Wholesaler’s Directory and Yearbook , com- munity Alliance with Family Farmers, Box 464, Davis, CA 95617; Ph: 916-756-8518. c. $35, plus $5 shipping. California residents, add $2.53 tax. Flaxseed oil: If you cannot obtain it at your health-food store, here are addresses for ordering it direct (it might even be fresher ordered direct): Omega Nutrition, 5373 Guide Meridian, Bldg. B, Bellingham, WA 98226 Ph: 800-661-3529. Keeps unopened in freezer up to 6 months, and in refrigerator 3 months. After opening, keep it no longer than three weeks. / One of the best flaxseed manufactur- ers is Barlean’s high lignan Flax Oil, 4936 Lake Terrell Rd., Ferndale, WA 98248 Juicer (triturator and press): Gerson says centrifugal juices are all right for most dis- eases; but, for cancer and bone-deformity conditions, a pulp grinder and press are needed. If you have the money ($2,000), the Norwalk Juicer and electric hydraulic press is the best: Norwalk Juicer, c/o Richard Boger, (800) 405- 8423, in U.S., or (619) 755-8423 outside U.S. However, you can purchase a rebuilt one under warranty from Norwalk for about $1,500. Norwalk Mfg Co., P .O. Box 829, Lowell, Arkansas 72745 / 800-643-8645. If you want a used, later model Norwalk Juicer, call Richard Boger at 519-755-8423. Also phone 619-585-7600 and ask for their used Norwalk Juicer list. At the present time, they run about $1,500; saving you over $500. Rebuilt juicers can also be purchased for about $1,500 from the Norwalk factory. Unlike used Norwalk juicers from other sources, these carry a warranty. Norwalk Mfg Co., P .O. Box 829, Lowell, Arkansas 72745 / 800-643- 8645. When purchasing a used model, make sure you obtain the latest model. Lower-cost non-Norwalk juicers have a separate grinder and manual press (which requires much work!): K&K Grinder and Press, c/o Al Hasser, 14410 Big Canyon Rd, Middletown, CA 95461 Ph: (707) 928-5970. Shredder, $750, and press, $275. You can substitute the Champion juicer as a lower-cost shredder: Lodi Health Foods, 521 S. Central Ave., Lodi, CA 95240 Ph: (209) 334-3868. $189 plus shipping. Ozone generators: To purify the air, give off ozone and negative ions. Mountain Fresh Services, P .O.

These are useful, but the dial should be set so that you do not detect the odor of ozone. It is said to be harmful to your brain, if you can smell it. LOCATING ORGANIC FOOD— There is an in- herent problem in consuming larger quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables: the amount of residual pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, or chemical fer- tilizers which may have been absorbed by the plant. “Here is a record of the average quantity of in- take of some [Gerson] patients in the course of one year; a very great part of which is converted into juices: “1800 pounds of carrots, 1300 pounds of apples, 145 heads of red cabbage, 400 heads of lettuce, 125 pounds of green peppers, etc.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 143. Fortunately, there are organizations which spe- cialize in telling you where you can obtain organi- cally grown produce: 1 - Check the local yellow pages for “Health- Food” stores and co-ops. Call and inquire whether they supply organically grown produce. If not, they may know where you can go. 2 - Contact OFPANA (Organic Food Produce Association of North America), Box 1078, Greenfield, MA 10301 / 413-774-7511. (1) Ask for names, addresses, and phone numbers of organic organizations in your area (OCIA, CCOF, TILTH, etc.) (2) Ask about distributors, growers, and possible retailers. 3 - Order a copy of the Organic Wholesaler’s Directory and Yearbook, from Community Alliance with Family Farmers, Box 464, Davis, CA 95617 / 916-756-8518. The book is about $35, plus $5 p&h. California residents add $2.53 tax. It has the most exhaustive list available of organic wholesalers, ar- ranged by state. Contacting those wholesalers, they can tell you who their retailers are. 4 - It is possible to order organic foods through the mail. If you are able to do this, you would want to obtain Americans for Safe Food, from Center for Science in the Public Interest, 1875 Connecticut Ave., NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20036 / 202- 332-9110. Send them a self-addressed, stamped envelope and ask for their organic mail order list . On it you will find organic food suppliers willing to mail you organic produce. 5 - Organic coffee is also important, since regu- lar coffee can contain pesticides, herbicides, etc. Listed below are three sources of pure organic cof- fee. (If you have been a Gerson patient, that is, hav- ing been to their hospital, you should identify your- self as a “Gerson patient” when ordering organic coffee, for a price break.) Cafe Marino, Baja Hospital Service, Box 3535, Chula Vista, CA 91911 / 619-425-1557 Cafe Altura, Terra Nova, Box 5145, Ojai, CA 93023 / 415-883-8378 Harbor House Coffee, P .O. Box 1879, Clearlake Oaks, CA 95423 / 707-998-4654 or 800-541-4699 It is wise to demand proof of organic certifica- tion. If the produce is not clearly marked with a printed label, it is probably not organic. Demand proof! On the bottom of this page are the identify- ing logos of five organic certification organizations. LAB TESTS— We have repeatedly mentioned that it would be wise to order the Gerson Primer. A number of medical laboratory tests are discussed on pp. 48-66 of that book. IMPROVING YOUR WATER SUPPLY— De- pending on regional water supplies, various forms of water purification may be purchased or leased at"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"41 considerable savings over purchased bottled water. Various combinations of distillation, carbon filtra- tion, and reverse osmosis should be considered. Lead, radon, nitrate, fluorides, and chlorine are all significant water contaminants. Labs which can test your water: The following three laboratories are approved by Consumer Union (which publishes Consumer Reports ), and can test your drinking water by mail. However, the tests are expensive and can cost up to $200. National Testing Laboratories, 6151 Wilson Mills Rd., Cleveland, OH 44143 / 800-458-3330 Water Testing Laboratories, 4600 Kutztown Rd., Temple, PA 19560 / 800-433-6595 Water Test, 33 S. Commercial St., Manchester, NH 03101 / 800-426-8378 Water cleansing devices: Here is some data on these home water purification methods. According to Consumer Reports, of the three methods, no one approach to the problem will remove all the con- taminants from your water: There are (1) distillers, (2) reverse osmosis units, and (3) carbon filtration units. Distillers and reverse osmosis units are better at removing organic hazards (plant and animal con- taminants) than do reverse osmosis units. But dis- tillers miss the volatile ones, such as benzene, car- bon tetrachloride and tricholorotheylene. The best way to solve this problem is to couple either a dis- tiller or a reverse osmosis unit, with a carbon fil- tration unit. In this way, the water is first run through a distiller or reverse osmosis unit, and then through a carbon filtration unit. Carbon filtration is the only way to remove chlo- rine, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethyl- ene, and radon from your water. But they cannot removed inorganic health hazards. Either distillers or reverse osmosis units will remove arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, fluo- ride, lead, nitrate, and selenium. Here are other facts to keep in mind: Distillers generally draw 1,500 watts, and cost about $1.50 in electricity per five gallons. For Gerson patients, the cost can be about $30 per month. Reverse osmosis units waste about 80% of the water! It runs down the drain. If you have a well, that could be a serious problem. When it is time to replace the membrane (usually once a year), the cost runs between $40 to $240. Carbon filters must be frequently replaced. Know in advance how much the replacement filters will cost. Some companies charge $5 for each re- placement filter, while others demand up to $100. It is also possible to purchase bottled water, or rent equipment. In keeping down yearly costs, some- times renting is the best route to go. Check your Yellow Pages. GERSON THERAPY RECIPES— You may wish to obtain a copy of the Gerson Primer, and make use of the 35 pages of recipes near the back of the book. IN CONCLUSION— It would be best if, accom- panied by a helper, you could go to the Gerson In- stitute for several weeks, before continuing on with the program at home. ———————————————————— 4 - NON-CANCER DISORDERS Milder measures for non-malignancy In order to round out this presentation, it would be well to briefly mention how the Gerson therapy is modified in working with non-malignant condi- tions. Cancer is so devastating to the body, that it requires special care. But a number of other condi- tions can be alleviated with a somewhat milder Gerson therapy. However, it should be kept in mind that, for all physical problems the Gerson therapy deals with, the strictest program will always accom- plish the best results, and more quickly. “With the ‘strictest cancer diet,’ other chronic diseases respond more rapidly than with the less intensive treatment.”— Charlotte Gerson, Appen- dix 1, A Cancer Therapy, p. 398. WHAT OTHER CONDITIONS CAN THE GERSON THERAPY HELP?— It is remarkable how many conditions can be helped by the Gerson method. Consider this: “Initial evidence of the healing process brought about by the Gerson therapy takes various forms. For instance, edemas go down with astonishing ra- pidity; skin afflictions recede and heal quickly; in areas of old scars, adhesions, lumps, or bone de - formations, ‘healing’ often begins as a hyperemia, i.e ., the body produces dilated blood vessels with redness and tenderness in the affected area. The newly oxygenated blood, now freshly supplied with enzymes and other healing substances, is brought into the damaged or sick areas.”— Charlotte Gerson, Appendix 1, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 394- 395. By 1932, Max Gerson was able to list over 30 different diseases that his less-intensive therapy was alleviating! (In the following quotation, italics are ours.) “ ‘My results with the Gerson Therapy [that] have been very satisfactory is arthritis deformans. X-ray examination shows that the structure of the dis- 4 - Non-Cancer Disorders"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"42 Summary of the Gerson Therapy eased bones changes with the use of the Gerson diet. The compacta becomes denser and more sharply outlined. Subjectively, the patients’ symp- toms improve, their motility and ability to work returns. In these cases, it is particularly important to restrict protein intake. “ ‘Epilepsy reacts very favorably. Previously in 1900 the two French scientists, Toulouse and Richet, used the saltless diet in cases of epilepsy with good results. With the addition of phospho- rus-enriched cod-liver oil and strictly limited pro- tein intake, healing was speeded visibly. Mental dis - ease was helped. Neurasthenia was greatly im- proved. Even in cases of neurasthenia with male impotence, potency returned. On the other hand, patients with unusually strong libido returned to a more normal condition. “ ‘In the tremendously extensive area of skin dis - eases, the saltless therapy is extremely valuable - i.e ., in acne, eczema, urticaria, prurigo, pemphi- gus, etc., as already stressed by Luithlen. However, the use of the Gerson therapy in lupus vulgaris and psoriasis is a first and is extremely effective, even in severe cases with already partial sclerodermy. It is particularly interesting to note the scar-dissolv- ing effect of the treatment in old scars and adhe - sions as well as in cases of K eloid acne. “ ‘Multiple sclerosis responds well. The ulcer- ations or scar tissue are absorbed and healed. However, where there is destruction of nerve tis- sue, obviously this cannot be restored. ‘Many other chronic diseases respond extremely well to the Gerson therapy even though in many cases their origin is obscure or unknown. Exophthalmic goi- ter (Grave’s disease) responds well. However pa- tients must be given proteins after about four weeks or weakness and loss of weight may result. “ ‘Dysmenorrhea, vaginal discharge, atypical menstrual periods (of 21 days or 5 to 6 weeks) re- turn gradually to normal cycles of 28 days. “ ‘The use of the therapy in kidney disorders should be obvious. It is also important to note that diseases of the respiratory organs, such as asthma, respond very well. Bronchiectasis, also chronic cases, react well without exception. “ ‘One important field of application of the therapy is in heart and circulatory diseases where the results are excellent, also in arteriosclerosis and connected kidney diseases . In these cases, it is im- portant to limit protein intake. “ ‘It is interesting to note here that in almost all cases of serious migraine the presence of paraden- tosis was noted. This always disappeared together with the migraine. I found later that the presence of paradentosis was often true in cases of severe arthritis deformans , too.’ ”— Max Gerson, A Can- cer Therapy, pp. 395-397. CONDITIONS WHICH MUST BE TREATED USING THE INTENSIVE CANCER THERAPY— It is important to keep in mind that some diseases require the intensive Gerson therapy used for can- cer! “An intensive Gerson Therapy is indicated in cases of serious degeneration or intoxication (in- cluding previous long term [medicinal or street] drug usage) . . (1) Intoxication during pregnancy, (2) tuberculosis, (3) osteoarthritis, (4) mental dis - ease and bodily asthenias, (5) spastic conditions, especially angina pectoris, (6) asthma, (7) malig- nancies, (8) spinal cord degenerative changes.”— Charlotte Gerson, Appendix 1, A Cancer Therapy, p. 401. TREATMENT FOR NON-MALIGNANT CONDI- TIONS— Here, very briefly, is an overview of how to treat non-cancerous diseases. Medicinal drugs: Other drugs, currently being taken, will have to be discontinued. “With the start of the Gerson therapy, all of the usual drugs have to be discontinued. This includes not only the highly toxic pain killers often admin- istered to terminal cancer patients but also che- motherapeutic agents, cytotoxins, blood thinners vasodilators, cortisone, antihistamines and others too numerous to mention. These drugs are materi- als foreign to the body. They place an additional burden on the liver which must eliminate foreign materials. Also these drugs contribute nothing posi- tive toward rebuilding the diseased organs. The pur- pose of the therapy is to reduce and eliminate the load of toxic materials which have accumulated. Obviously one must not add to this load.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 396-397. Relieving pain: The Gerson enemas—given as often as every 2 hours,—do an outstanding job of pain reduction. However, the “pain triad,” mentioned earlier [one tablet of aspirin (5 gr.), one Vitamin C (100 mg.) and one Niacin (50 mg.) up to four times in the course of the first 24 hours], is used to help initially reduce pain. But soon the cleansing effect of the enemas takes effect and the pain is reduced. Spasms and edema are eliminated through large doses of potassium given right away at the start of the detoxification. Diabetes: Insulin intake should be continued. Careful monitoring of blood and urine will reveal when the pancreas begins functioning normally again. The insulin dosage can often be cut in half with the first 10 days of therapy, and generally elimi- nated entirely within a month. “Dietary adjustments made for diabetic patients were to reduce the number of baked potatoes given from two to one a day, to use grapefruit juice for breakfast instead of orange juice, and to give more green juice than apple and carrot juice.”— Char- lotte Gerson, Appendix 1, A Cancer Therapy, p. 397."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"43 Circulatory conditions: It is important that a total of 3 tbsp. of flaxseed oil be included in the diet. (This is the amount in the regular cancer therapy.) In combination with the rest of the therapy, this will eliminate the danger of clotting—even though regular medications (blood thinners and capillary dilators) have been discontinued. Gerson used flaxseed oil to reduce the high cholesterol level in cancer and arteriosclerosis patients. In cancer patients it also speeded up the reduction and ab- sorption of the tumors. Multiple sclerosis: Egg yolks are used early in the treatment; whereas, in cancer therapy, they should not given for over a year. Arthritis: Protein must be kept to a minimum for a lengthy period of time. Goiter: Protein must be added after only 3-4 weeks. Muscular dystrophy: It is important that suffi- cient amounts of iodine and thyroid be given, to re- establish the iodine metabolism by the thyroid. THE STRICT THERAPY IS ALWAYS BET- TER— Charlotte Gerson advises that it is best to go on the strict, cancer-reduction program, not a milder version. We will quote her statement once more: “With the ‘strictest cancer diet,’ other chronic diseases respond more rapidly than with the less intensive treatment.”— Charlotte Gerson, Appen- dix 1, A Cancer Therapy, p. 398. THE MILDER THERAPY— Here are several as- pects of this milder program: Permitted and forbidden foods remain the same, except that fresh berries can be used. The number of juices and enemas can be reduced, and the pa- tient can return to work sooner. “1. [Foods:] Forbidden foods and stimulants can- not be introduced into the diet with the exception of some fresh berries and safflower oil. [ Our note: It is better if only flax oil is used.] “2. [Enemas:] Detoxification must be carried on regularly, although 2 to 3 coffee enemas a day are sufficient. “3. [Juices:] The amount of fresh juices can be reduced to 4 or 5 glasses a day plus one glass of citrus juice (always freshly prepared just before drinking). Also, carrot and apple juice may be mixed in the course of preparation with the green leaf juice, and a centrifugal juicer type may be used. In order to speed up healing, more juices and press- type juicers are recommended. “4. [Soup and vegetables:] The special soup and menus should be adhered to. After initial improve- ment, usually the patient can go back to work and adjust his lunch to include soup (brought from home in a vacuum bottle), fresh juice a baked po- tato, fresh mixed salad, and fruit. Much fresh fruit should be eaten during the day.”— Charlotte Gerson, Appendix 1, A Cancer Therapy, pp. 398- 399. Toxic substances forbidden: It is extremely im- portant that all types of poisonous substances, in food, air, and water supplies be avoided. This in- cludes fluorides in both drinking water and tooth- paste. Other toxic substances such as insect sprays, paint sprays, underarm deodorants, and toxic or pore clogging grooming substances must be avoided. Centrifugal juicer permitted: A centrifugal type juicer may be used, instead of the press type. Juice may be made of a combination of carrots, apples, green leaves, etc.,—instead of the carrot-and-apple juice and green-leaf juices made separately. Remain on strict medications: The medica- tions on pp 400-401 of A Cancer Therapy have been omitted from the latest editions of this publication, so it would be best to adhere to those in the stricter version of the therapy. Here are two other statements gleaned from Max Gerson’s comments on treating non-malignant con- ditions: “Would not detoxification be advisable in the ma- jority of illnesses? Is this not comparable to what is called “a cleansing program?” A. We have to detoxify the body in all degenerative diseases, in acute diseases too. But not to the extent as is re- quired in cancer. Even most of the arthritis cases are not so toxic. I found that almost all of the ar- thritis cases have a weak liver or damaged liver. This is also true of coronary disease.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 415. “Can fibroid tumors be dissolved in the same manner? A. Fibroid tumors are mostly benign. Be- nign tumors take 10 to 20 times as much time to absorb as malignant tumors. This goes for adhe- sions and scars. Fibroid and benign tumors are dissolved only very slowly because they are not ab- normal. It is difficult for the parenteral system to bring its digestive powers to bear on these benign tumors. But when they turn malignant, then they are quickly dissolved.”— Max Gerson, A Cancer Therapy, p. 413."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"• Nearly four hundred preventive factors • Over fifty cancer treatment methods • Based on the findings of eighty cancer researchers • The three primary methods used today • Over fifty special herbs • The four leading herbal formulas • Anti-cancer organizations and clinics • Sources of supplies – and much more 8-1/2 x 11 - 198 pages ALTERNATIVE CANCER REMEDIES Facts for Historians and Medical Researchers OTHER BOOKS BY THIS PUBLISHER — One copy - $19.95, plus $2.50 p&h / Two copies - $18.00 each, plus $3.00 p&h In Tennessee, add 9.25% tax NATURAL REMEDIES ENCYCLOPEDIA • Topically arranged • Home remedies for over 500 diseases • Old fashioned remedies, plus modern nutritional aids 8-1/2 x 11 - 483 pages One copy - $16.00, plus $4.00 p&h In Tennessee, add 9.25% tax WATER THERAPY MANUAL • Over 100 ways to give simple water treatments • Step-by-step explanations and diagrams 5-1/2 X 8-1/2 - 294 pages One copy - $9.95, plus $2.50 p&h In Tennessee, add 9.25% tax EIGHT LAWS OF HEALTH • The eight basic principles needed for good health • Plus inspirational help you will appreciate 8-1/2 X 11 - 64 pages One copy - $5.00, plus $2.50 p&h / Ten copies - $4.50 each, plus $6.00 p&h In Tennessee, add 9.25% tax"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"If you are not dying from cancer, this book is not for you.
