To Travis, for the loss of his young life, and to the manyother Morgellons patients who have suffered in isolation and fear, I dedicatethis work.FOREWORDThere is a rapidly growing interest in Morgellons disease as evidenced by thefact that research papers on the topic have been among the most highly accessedscientific research on the Internet for the past few years. As director of theCharles E. Holman Morgellons Disease Foundation (CEHMDF), I hear from 5 to 10new patients daily who have symptoms consistent with the disease and who havehit brick walls trying to access medical care.In our early years, the CEHMDF would field calls from hostile doctors,disgruntled that we were validating the symptoms reported by Morgellonspatients. Today we hear more often from doctors who are baffled and at a lossto know what to do for the patients presenting to their practices with thedebilitating symptoms of this new and misunderstood disease. As more and moreresearch is published in the medical literature, Morgellons disease is slowlygaining acceptance as an infectious disease despite an unusually fierceopposition that strives to keep it tucked away and dismissed as purelypsychiatric in origin.Dr. Ginger Savely was the first pioneering medical provider to take herMorgellons patients' symptoms seriously and work to legitimize the disease. Shetook on this very challenging patient population and stood by them in theirdarkest hours. Dr. Savely listened to her patients and looked at the blatantobjective evidence. She was the first to speak out publicly about this serioushealth crisis and she has continued throughout the years to stand up for thereality of Morgellons disease through her numerous published articles,interviews, and presentations at medical conferences. Dr. Savely has been alifeline for hundreds of suffering people who have lost their way and given uphope of ever receiving medical attention for their unusual and agonizingsymptoms. She has worked to educate her peers and has been committed to helpingher patients.At a time when interest in Morgellons disease is at an all time high, thisdetailed first-hand account of the Morgellons journey is a much-neededresource. With clarity, personal style and years of experience, Dr. Savely hastaken on a challenging and highly controversial subject. Using up-to-the-minutescientific findings, color photographs and sweeping examples she has illuminatedthe path to recognition of this debilitating and disfiguring disease, previouslyorphaned by the medical community.We have come a long way against great odds on our journey to legitimizeMorgellons disease. Dr. Savely paved the earliest path on the rockiest road tomake this progress possible. I have no doubt that Morgellons disease willeventually be fully recognized worldwide by health agencies and the medicalcommunity at large because the scientific evidence has reached an undeniablepoint. I firmly believe that in time the truth will prevail.This book provides long-awaited answers to the vital questions being posed bythousands of patients and clinicians about this unthinkable disease. In readingDr. Savely’s poignant narrative, you will learn to separate fact from myth andrumor from reality. This book will be a valuable resource for Morgellonspatients and their families and friends and will serve as a guide for clinicianswho are open-minded and committed to the health of their patients.Cindy Casey-Holman, RNDirector, The Charles E. Holman Morgellons Disease Foundationwww.MorgellonsDisease.org [http://www.morgellonsdisease.org]“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change theworld;indeed it's the only thing that ever has.” — Margaret MeadINTRODUCTION In 2003 I was working as a primary care nurse practitioner in a family practiceclinic in Austin, Texas. A few years earlier I had become interested in treatingLyme disease after my teenage daughter became very ill with it. Lyme disease, atickborne infection caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi , is mostcommonly seen in the northeastern United States but cases have been reported inall 50 states. By 2003 about 30% of my patients were Lyme disease patientsbecause as I became more interested and knowledgeable about the disease, peoplewho suspected that they had it began to seek me out.One of my Lyme disease patients had previously been diagnosed with ALS(amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), a progressive and fatal neurodegenerativedisease involving gradual atrophy of muscles of the body. When he first becameill he had been an active young man who led hikes through the mountains inColorado. By the time I saw him he was expected to live no longer than anotheryear. I began treating him with antibiotics after discovering that his LymeWestern Blot blood test was positive. Almost miraculously, he slowly began toimprove.Jim Bergamo, a news reporter with an Austin TV station, caught wind of the storyof this young man who was improving from an incurable condition, and thought itwould make a compelling human-interest story for the evening news. He and hiscrew came to my office and taped a TV news segment about this ALS patient, hisillness and my treatment of him. As Jim left the office and thanked me for thestory I said, “If you think this was interesting you’ve GOT to come back and doa story on Morgellons disease!”Of course, I had to explain what I meant by this because at that point no onehad heard of Morgellons (pronounced with a soft G) disease. I explained that adozen or so of my Lyme patients had mysterious, spontaneously appearing,slow-healing lesions with unusual colored filaments embedded in and/or extrudingfrom their skin. Other doctors had diagnosed these patients with “Delusions ofParasitosis” but I was beginning to have some success treating them withantibiotics. Their symptoms were varied, unexplainable and bizarre. I knew thesepatients were not delusional because I had observed the filaments myself usinglighted magnification. I had tried to extract the embedded filaments but sincethey were firmly and deeply attached my attempts to remove them caused patientsdeep, radiating pain.I had learned from my colleague William Harvey, M.D. of Houston, TX (nowdeceased) that there was a name for the filament condition – Morgellons disease.The name was given by a microbiologist in Pennsylvania whose 3-year-old son hadthe symptoms. So, Jim Bergamo and his team returned once more to my office tomake what was to become a powerful, award-winning news segment about Morgellonsdisease. The day after the segment aired, dozens of people began calling myoffice, excited to know that there were other people with their unusual symptomsand that there was actually a name for their condition.That was the start of an influx of patients with the unusual symptoms ofMorgellons disease. What impressed me right away was that all of these peopledescribed the EXACT same long list of perplexing symptoms. This was before thedisease had developed media notoriety so patients could not have been telling methe “right” symptoms in order to gain my attention. In fact, these patients wereoften hard-working West Texas ranchers who certainly didn’t have hypochondriacaltendencies or a habit of surfing the net to find the disease du jour, as wasbeing suggested by the naysayers in the medical establishment.At first, I panicked. I was not an expert on this disease (not that anyone was)and I had no idea what I was going to do with all of these people. Since I hadfirst noted the symptoms in a subset of my Lyme disease patients I decided thatthe first thing I would do would be to test these filament disease patients forLyme disease. So, I began ordering blood tests to look for Lyme and othertickborne diseases and almost all of the Morgellons patients were positive forat least one of the tickborne infections. With antibiotic treatment, they beganto improve. They came from all walks of life, from all over the state of Texas,neighboring states and even California. There were ranch hands from west Texas,landscapers, attorneys, physicians, nurses, secretaries, carpenters and collegeprofessors. Every career, race, age and socio-economic group was represented.Then the barrage of publicity began. About 10 years ago, Morgellons diseaseenjoyed a brief flurry of notoriety when the media first became aware of itsattention-grabbing salability. I published numerous journal articles and wasinterviewed for articles in The Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, LosAngeles Times , and Dallas Observer . Magazines such as Psychology Today, TheTexas Monthly and Popular Mechanics published articles on the topic and radioand television interviews I gave were played extensively on affiliated networks.One of my patients and I were featured in a segment of the Animal Planet series,Monsters Inside Me , as well as an episode of Discovery Heath Channel’s MysteryER. A taped interview of us was shown on the Rachel Ray Show.In 2006, my work was featured in a 6-minute segment taped for the Diane RehmShow . When the network’s crew arrived to spend 3 days taping in my SanFrancisco office, it was clear from the looks on their faces and their tones ofvoice that they were highly skeptical and expected to produce a segment aboutpeople with delusions. By the time they left to fly back to New York City theywere believers – they could not deny the existence of MD after what they hadobserved.I naively assumed that dermatologists around the world would be very excitedabout this new Morgellons disease. I thought they would be fascinated andintrigued to learn about a novel skin condition, which would presumably offer awelcome relief from the monotony of treating teenaged acne. I could not havebeen more mistaken. Instead of being captivated by the uniqueness of thedisease, dermatologists would refer patients to psychiatrists without evenexamining the skin or asking further questions of the patients. Intellectualcuriosity, I soon learned, is no longer a strong suit of the majority of thosepracticing medicine.I was harshly criticized by my colleagues who accused me of “playing into” thepsychosis of these patients by diagnosing them with a medical condition andtreating them with antibiotics. It did not matter that patients were gettingbetter – my critics claimed this was probably a placebo reaction to patientsbeing heard and validated.Meanwhile, there still remained the baffling questions: what was causing theseunusual symptoms and why did some patients respond better to treatment thanothers? In fact, as time went on it became clear that many did not respond toLyme disease treatment, resulting in my early experimentation with otheranti-infective medications such as anthelminthics, antiparasitics, antifungals,antivirals and many different types of antibiotics, hoping to discover theperfect medication cocktail to deliver these poor souls from their misery. But,without knowledge of the causative pathogen, I was flying on a wing and aprayer.This book is a result of my experience treating hundreds of Morgellons patientsfor over a decade. Most of what I chronicle here is based on personal clinicalexperience. At one point 80% of my practice was devoted to treating Morgellonsdisease. I have learned through trial and error but mostly through the feedbackof my courageous patients. Far from being a group of “crazy people” (as most ofthe medical world has labeled them), I have found my patients with Morgellonsdisease to be good-willed, sane, brave, hard-working people, trying to make thebest of a horrific situation. I thank them all for willingly becoming “lab rats”in an ongoing treatment experiment. I will forever be humbled by their strengthand perseverance and honored by their trust and faith in me.TABLE OF CONTENTSPART ONETRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION1. Cindy’s Story2.

Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is acceptedas beingself-evident”.— Arthur SchopenhauerCINDY’S STORY“Oh, my gosh…. that is so bizarre!” “What could possibly cause that?” “Have youseen a dermatologist?” “What are you going to do?” A group of nurses gathersaround the nurse’s station examining their co-worker’s arms. They are intriguedyet somewhat frightened by the unusual skin condition that is causing theirfriend’s skin to erupt and produce brightly colored filaments.A 60x-powered, hand-held lighted magnifier enables the nurses to see the unusualfilaments that are intertwined in masses beneath their co-worker’s skin. One ofthe nurses motions for the doctor on call to come and take a look. It is notunusual at this teaching hospital for staff to gather to assess a patient withan unusual condition, learn about a new monitoring device, or brainstorm about aproblematic wound. But what is unusual this time is that the patient is one oftheir own, a respected and experienced member of the team.No Help From the DermatologistsCindy Casey, RN had worked as a staff nurse and charge nurse in this MedicalSpecialty Intensive Care Unit for over 15 years. She had already seen fourdermatologists for her peculiar symptoms and none of them was even willing tolook at the filaments she described. She was hastily dismissed as delusional orself-mutilating and was offered no more than antipsychotics. Despite herdisfiguring lesions and debilitating symptoms, Cindy was released to continueworking in her job as staff nurse/relief charge nurse in a 21-bed critical careunit. The lesions continued to appear spontaneously and the symptoms intensified. Theitching and crawling sensations became unbearable and soon Cindy’s entire bodywas covered with painful, oozing, disfiguring lesions. Various antihistaminesand medications for neuropathies were all ineffective in controlling theinsatiable itch and crawling sensations. Black specks and bizarre filaments inwhite, clear, black, red, and blue emerged from unbroken skin and the edges ofthe open lesions turned black. Cindy’s co-workers, friends, and family could seethese strange exudates with their own eyes. They knew Cindy as a calm,competent, and well-adjusted woman and certainly not delusional.The 5 th dermatologist Cindy consulted took her seriously enough to conduct athorough medical workup including comprehensive blood work, chest x-ray, aseries of stool specimens and referral to a neurologist to rule out neuropathyas a cause of the unusual sensations. Yet even this dermatologist had nointerest in looking carefully at the microscopic debris that was torturing Cindyday and night. Cindy could only guess that the doctor’s reluctance to examineher skin had something to do with not wanting to encourage her “delusion”. Askin biopsy was performed at Cindy’s insistence but the report described thefilaments as textile contaminants. All test results were normal and again, therewere no answers.When In Doubt, Diagnose a Psychiatric Condition?Cindy continued working and was very open about her illness with her colleagues.Her nurse manager became concerned that Cindy’s condition might be contagious,putting the hospital unit’s immune-compromised patients at risk. Furthermore,the open lesions that Cindy was unable to occlude would put her at risk forhospital-acquired infections. Cindy’s nurse manager consulted the infectiousdisease specialists in the unit for advice. Initially, these specialists seemedconcerned but after making a call to Cindy’s dermatologist, they too suspectedher problems were psychiatric in origin.The last dermatologist and his residents had alluded to a possible psychologicalorigin of Cindy’s illness but had never come out and said anything definitive.When Cindy’s husband Charles asked directly for a diagnosis, the residentsbecame uneasy and evasive. Charles asked again and was told: “It is known asdifferent things in different countries”. Charles replied with “Okay…. so let’sstart with what it is referred to in the United States”. In a meek voice andwithout making eye contact, one of the residents reluctantly replied “Delusionsof Parasitosis.”Delusions of ParasitosisDelusions of Parasitosis (DOP), also known as Delusional Parasitosis or Ekbom’sSyndrome, is a psychiatric disorder in which patients mistakenly believe theyare infested with parasites. In medical school physicians learn of the “matchboxsign” of DOP, so named because in earlier times patients would present thedebris from their lesions in a matchbox. DOP is actually very rare and oddlythose diagnosed with it have no prior history of mental illness. In fact,patients seem cognitively intact in every way while insistent that there issomething inside of them causing itching and other disturbing sensations. Someof the earliest patients with these symptoms expressed the belief that theirsymptoms were due to a parasite. However, because a known parasite could not beidentified on a superficial exam, doctors assumed that the patients wereimagining things.In Search of AnswersCindy and Charles were stunned by the DOP diagnosis. Cindy had never mentionedparasites nor did she have a belief that parasites were the cause of herproblems. She had no personal or family history of mental disorders and in fact,she was a newlywed and the happiest she had been in her life. If the doctorsbelieved she had a psychiatric problem, why had they not referred her to apsychiatrist? Charles asked the dermatologist for treatment recommendations. Hisreply was: “There is nothing we can do for the condition of her skin. We canonly offer medications that may help her to perceive her skin differently.”Unfortunately, the prescribed medications caused incapacitating sedation and thehorrifying symptoms remained unchanged.Refusing to accept the DOP diagnosis, Cindy and Charles continued to search foran explanation for Cindy’s frightening and debilitating symptoms. Charlescreated a website and began maintaining a blog detailing the trials andtribulations of their quest. When they first heard the term Morgellons disease(MD), found out there was a website and realized that Cindy had thecharacteristic symptoms, they had their first glimmer of hope. At least Cindywas not alone and if there were others afflicted with her condition, surely helpwould follow. But finding a name for Cindy’s condition and knowing that therewere others in her situation were only the first steps in what was to become afrustrating and wearisome journey. Few healthcare providers were willing to evenadmit the disease was real, much less try to help the patients who weresuffering from it.Cindy started granting interviews for television and newspapers regarding hermysterious illness. After her first appearance on TV, Cindy began hearing frompatients all over the United States. It was then that she knew she had done theright thing by going public with her symptoms. At the same time, she realizedthat her life would never be the same.The Charles E. Holman FoundationCindy worked her last shift as a nurse in November 2005. She misses her job andthe people she worked with for 16 years. Although she has improved considerablyby taking antibiotics, Cindy still struggles with Morgellons symptoms daily andher disfigured body bears little resemblance to the vibrant, healthy nurse thatshe once was. She now lives on Social Security Disability Insurance and hasbecome a passionate advocate for Morgellons patients all over the world. In 2007Cindy started a non-profit foundation named The Charles E. Holman MorgellonsDisease Foundation (CEHMDF) in honor of the husband she had just lost to anuntimely death. Charles had seen Cindy through her most difficult times and shestill feels fortunate that she had his support as well as that of her family andfriends who took her symptoms seriously from the beginning. Since its inception,the CEHMDF has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the disease and has heldan annual conference in Austin, Texas for health care providers and patients tonetwork, learn new research findings and share theories of etiology andtreatment strategies.As the CEHMDF continues to educate health care providers about MD. most aresurprised to learn that the disease is not a new phenomenon. It has onlyrecently gained media notoriety but some version of the disease has been arounda long time. In the next chapter, I will review what we know about the historyof this bizarre disease.MORGELLONS: NOT A NEW DISEASEA 17th-century British physician, Sir Thomas Browne, was the first to describe adisease resembling what we currently think of as Morgellons disease. Browne wasa veritable Renaissance man with interest and expertise in history, philosophy,religion, linguistics and pathology. In a 1674 letter to a friend, Browne wrotethe following perplexing passage, referring to a time when he was a medicalstudent in France:“HAIRS WHICH HAVE MOST AMUSED ME HAVE NOT BEEN IN THE FACE OR HEAD, BUT ON THEBACK, AND NOT IN MEN BUT CHILDREN, AS I LONG AGO OBSERVED IN THAT ENDEMIALDISTEMPER OF LITTLE CHILDRENIN LANGUEDOCK, CALLED THE MORGELLONS, WHEREIN THEYCRITICALLY BREAK OUT WITH HARSH HAIRS ON THEIR BACKS, WHICH TAKES OFF THEUNQUIET SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE, AND DELIVERS THEM FROM COUGHS AND CONVULSIONS”.The condition had been known as pilaris affectio (“hair affection”) byphysicians as far back as 1544 and was associated with pain, itching,convulsions, and wasting in its young victims. In some writings, the “hairs”were referred to as “little worms with black heads.”Why Browne referred to the condition as “the Morgellons” in his writings is notclear, although it may have been his English derivation of the term“Mousquelons”, meaning the tiny hook at the end of a spindle, and the Frenchprovincial name for the disease in the 17 th century. But, C.E. Kellett, MD(1908-78), pediatrician and owner of a collection of books and essays on 16 thand 17 th- century European medicine, postulated that the word may have derivedfrom the Provincial word “muscula”, a tiny fly.Although similarities exist between the disease currently known as Morgellonsand the disease described in the 17 th century, the old illustrations do notexactly match what is seen today. Moreover, the modern day illness is seen inadults as well as children and convulsions are not reported as one of thesymptoms.Dr. Michele Ettmuller’s 1682 microscopic drawings of objects associated withwhat was then believed to be a worm infestation of children appear somewhatsimilar to microscopic views of filaments from present-day sufferers of MD.Ettmuller’s drawings exhibit a long narrow segmented filament with a bulbousend, from which emanate little hooks and hairs (see picture on next page).Morgellons patients often describe a similar appearance of the filaments thatexit their lesions but none of us who have been treating these patients orresearching their condition have seen anything that exactly matches Ettmuller’sdrawings.In the June 22, 1946 edition of the British Medical Journal , a letter to theeditor entitled “ Myasis, 'Fillan' and 'The Morgellons' “ was written by A.H.Emslie-Smith, a microbiologist with the Royal Army Medical Corps and thedepartment of bacteriology at King’s College, Newcastle upon Tyne. Smithproposed that what had previously been known as Morgellons disease may haveactually been an infestation by larvae of the cattle pest, Hypoderma bovis(gadfly), working their way through the skin. We now know that this is not thecase.[Image00000.jpg]Morgellons disease was not mentioned again until Mary Leitao brought it tomodern day attention in 2001. A microbiology-trained mother of three, living inPennsylvania, Leitao noted a non-healing lesion on the lower lip of her youngson. The child complained that there were “bugs” under his skin and when Leitaolooked at a scab from his lesion under magnification she noted deeply embeddedblue and red filaments that fluoresced under ultraviolet light.Unable to find answers for her son’s perplexing condition from the physiciansshe consulted, Leitao, like many others who are faced with unidentifiablediseases, began scouring the Internet for answers. When she uncovered Dr. ThomasBrowne’s writings she thought that his 17 th -century description soundedsimilar to what was happening to her young son. In 2002, Leitao re-birthed thename Morgellons disease (MD) to describe her son’s ailment and proceeded tofound a not-for-profit organization named The Morgellons Research Foundation(MRF) with the goal of garnering serious attention for the disease. The websiteincluded a database where patients could report their symptoms.The organization’s website began to disseminate information and ask those withMD symptoms to come forward and be counted. By 2009 the number of self-reportedcases exceeded 14,000 with the tally rapidly increasing daily. The originalfocus was on skin symptoms but soon other symptoms within the patient groupbecame recognized, such as disabling fatigue, life-altering cognitive decline,musculoskeletal pain, and mood disorders. Leitao's website and the original MRFbecame inactive in early 2012 and the website domain name was taken over bypromoters of the chemtrail theory of Morgellons (more about this later). Thosewho search for the MRF website these days are not seeing the website originallyfounded by Mary Leitao.My suspicion is that Morgellons disease goes back many centuries, probably evenbefore the mention of it by Sir Thomas Browne in the 17 th century. During the19 th and 20 th centuries patient complaints of crawling sensations andfilaments resulted in a delusional diagnosis because it was believed thatpatients were imagining bugs crawling on them and that the filaments and otherdebris from their skin were environmental contaminants. By the 21st century,patients learned to keep quiet about their symptoms for fear of being diagnosedpsychotic, ruining their chances of a respectable job and place in society. Thedisease did not decrease in incidence; people just did not want to deal with thenegative reactions to their complaints.One of my MD patient’s symptoms date back to 1954 – you will read his story inthe next chapter. Thus, there are reasons to believe that Morgellons disease isnot new to this century or even to the last. What has changed is awareness,thanks to the rapid spread of information through the Internet, enablingthousands of people to come out of the shadows and be validated. Morgellonspatients, who have suffered for more than 15 years, before a name was given fortheir condition or their disease was discussed in the media, have experiencedthe worst isolation and prejudicial treatment. Bill Pitt was one such patient.WHEN NOTHING SEEMS RIGHT, CRAZY MAKES SENSE“Poster boy for Morgellons disease.” That is what I used to call him. He grinnedand bore the title proudly. None of the patients I have treated for Morgellonsdisease have suffered as long as Bill Pitt did. He first came to my SanFrancisco office in 2005, a tall, good-looking man with a booming laugh andlanguage that would make a sailor blush. Bill was big and tough and street smartbut underneath his bulletproof exterior was a thoughtful, intelligent andsensitive soul.It was impossible not to love Bill and all of us in the office did. He was acharacter, that’s for sure. He made us laugh with his sarcastic wit and broughttears to our eyes with his honest, self-deprecating insights. Not surprisingly,there was anger and resentment beneath his jovial exterior and at times it wouldbreak through as he recounted the many years of suffering he had endured due toa medical establishment unwilling to open their eyes to the strange malady thatplagued him.He used to call me “Dr. Doll”. Others might have seen this as chauvinistic but Ididn’t take it that way. He was always appropriate with me and I knew it was histender way of showing me respect. He worried about me constantly. He was afraidthat by helping bring MD to the public eye I had put myself at some kind ofrisk. He told me not to drive on back roads alone. (He saw me as another ErinBrockovich and feared I would meet her same fate.) At the 5-year anniversary ofour doctor/patient relationship Bill sent me a gift – a beautiful slice ofpetrified wood. He had searched online and discovered that 5 years is the woodenanniversary. He was known for sweet gestures like this.Despite what you will read in his personal account that follows, Bill not onlyconsidered suicide but attempted it on several occasions. Each time that asuicide attempt failed he would joke and say that he was not even able to dosuicide right. I pointed out to him that maybe the reason he did not succeed wasthat his presence here on earth was essential to unlocking the key to thismysterious disease.I urged Bill to write about his life with Morgellons disease because I felt itwas vital for people to know how long its victims have been suffering insilence. Having recently learned with great sadness of Bill’s passing due tonatural causes, I was moved to retrieve his notes and review them. My lastdoctor-patient encounter with him was 2 months before his death. Re-reading hiswords made me sad and made me smile. I was obliged to edit his writing somewhat(punctuation was not his forte) and clean up the language here and there (he hada predilection for four letter words) but I believe his raw narrative is movingand gives insight into the isolation suffered by MD patients. [Note: Bill chose to use the term fiber where I use the word filament. I amconcerned that the word fiber is suggestive of textiles and I choose not to useterminology that promotes the continued incorrect belief that the filaments inMD patients are textile fibers. However, I want to present Bill’s narrative justas he wrote it.] Here is Bill’s story in his own words:For me, it started at an early age. I was just 6 years old in 1954 when I firstnoticed \"things\" would appear on or in my skin, disappearing as quickly as theyappeared. By the age of 7, I was seeing spinning, moving hairs on my skin. Mymom would yank them out when she felt I was getting too fascinated by what these\"hairs\" were doing. Around this same time, my father became ill with sores onhis feet and legs. He spent long nights digging into his sores. He was sure thatthere was something deep inside of him causing his sores and his pain and hewasn’t going to stop until he could remove the source of his torture. In fact,he had little time for anything else but trying to prove to himself and hisdoctors that something unusual was going on.[Image00001.jpg]Bill, Christmas of 1958, 10 years old.My Dad continued like this until he died when I was 12 years old. He died on theoperating table at Los Angeles General Hospital when the doctors said there wasnothing left to do but amputate his legs to remove the gaping sores and histormenting belief that something was boring its way through his skin. This wasthe cure in 1960. The doctor that led the team on my father’s case resignedshortly after Dad died and he and his family moved out of California. He waskind enough to stop by our house to say how sorry he was and that something likethis should not have happened in an age of modern medicine.I look back now and laugh. I think it was right then that I realized if I wasgoing to survive this mystery disease I would need to rely on myself and what Iknew to be the truth. I realized that I was alone in this and it seemed theworld was against me. Shortly before he died my Dad told me to stay strong nomatter what other people might say about our strange affliction.So began decades of back glances, snide remarks and doctor referrals to mentalheath professionals who supposedly knew what to do with “delusional” people likeme. As a kid, I was in and out of a galvanized metal tub where I soaked invinegar or baking soda or whatever other suggestion was given for my almostconstant rashes. It appeared that I had allergies and everyone would call me“poor Billy, the little rash boy”.Once, when I was 11 years old, I laid on the floor of our living room crying inpain. My bones and all of my joints hurt so badly that all I was able to do waslie on the floor curled up in a ball. My mother talked with the family doctorand he thought it best that I be taken to Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles. Wedidn't have a car so I was put in a shopping cart and wheeled to the bus stop.On the bus I lay on the floor writhing in pain. Less than half way to Children’sHospital the bus driver pulled over and called a taxi for my mom and me. He waskind enough to pay the taxi fare since we didn't have money for such things. Ican remember the ride but little of anything but pain and tears after we arrivedat the hospital. I was released from the hospital a day and a half later with adiagnosis of “growing pains”. That was “modern medicine”.Life became more or less normal and when I got older and enlisted in the Navy in1965 I passed all the physicals. How could anything be wrong with me when I gota stamp of approval from the US Government? Yet, I became more cautious aboutwhat I said or did about my itching and fibers and I knew with greater intensitythat something was wrong with the system. I began to think of myself as astranger here on earth and that this disease and I shared a different reality.My military enlistment ended and I was now in my 20's. I was scrubbing my skinand spending hours in the water at the beach chasing these darned fibers. Ispent all my free time working out, soaking in the steam room and sauna andscrubbing away at my skin. The rashes still came and went and new feelings camethat made me feel as if I was being eaten alive and my body and my mind werebeing snatched away from me. I couldn’t help but think that a new life form hadtaken over my body and was capable of stealing my life right in front ofeveryone. And I was the only person who could see it.It was insanity. I played with that in order to survive. I hid in plain sight -sometimes I hid even from myself. I was that crazy dude with weird stories. Soas I went into my 30s and 40s what I know now as Morgellons disease took me tomore doctors than most people ever see in a lifetime. I even went to othercountries searching out folk healers. In Mexico, they packed me in lard, coatedme in flour and bathed me in milk all to draw out the \"devils fingers\". Theywere familiar with what was going on with me and told me I had “cactus mandisease”. And still, the rashes came.As the fibers increased my skin became alien to me, as though I was beingencased in reptilian gauze. I could have gone stark raving mad at any time butinstead, I became a warrior against everything that stood in my way. Nothing wasmore important than giving this thing a name and finding one other person onthis planet that could see and believe what I was living with. Family, friends,and anyone who dared look sideways at me I now perceived as against me. Everyonebecame my enemy as much as the disease inside me. Was I the harbinger of aplague that would destroy or forever change the world in some evil way? I wasalone, just “Melvins” and me. That was the name I had given to my disease. Idon't know why. I just needed it to have a name. It was probably my Mom whofirst coined the name by saying \"Billy is having a Melvin fit\".For most of my life, I worked as a machinist on different railroads here in theU.S. There would be periods of being laid off and during one of those times Ifound work as a heavy machine operator and mechanic at a surface mine in VenturaCounty, CA. Just after completing a new clearing out on a high ridge it wasfantastic to look out over the Pacific, the sunset casting gleaming beams intothe cab of my D10 dozer.One day at work I was bitten by some kind of bug and it stung like crazy. Withinthe first hour, a bull’s eye rash formed on my leg [a bull’s eye rash is theclassic diagnostic feature of Lyme disease]. The boss sent me to an urgent carecenter where I was given antibiotics and told to go home, put the leg up andrest. I stayed in bed for a couple of days and the bull’s eye rash turned into afestering mass of what looked like a French pastry gone mad. I called the doctorand he sent me to another doctor who said \"Wow!” put me on stronger antibioticsand sent me home again. Fourteen days went by and the bull’s eye rash began todisappear - until the antibiotics ran out. Then the rash came back with avengeance.This time, I was sent to the UCLA Medical center where I took part in a doctor’sround table event. There were about 100 physicians with lots of looking andhmm’ing. Some had cameras and snapped shots with different colored backdrops tomake the bull’s eye rash \"pop\" in the photos. More antibiotics were prescribedand in the end, I was told my Lyme test was negative. It remained negative foranother 10 years until I finally saw a Lyme expert and had a better test done.Of course, this delayed-diagnosis worked well for my employer because by thentime had expired for me to file any type of a claim. The good news was that Iwas able to go back to work at my regular job and the insurance company couldnot write it off as a pre-existing condition. This is all interesting because ithas now been seen that a large percentage of Morgellons patients have Lymedisease and co-infections, which I refer to as the \"bacterial coalition\". MyLyme expert told me that I had a number of different coalition bacteria workingtheir way through my body.During the time from the late 70s into the mid-90s I lived an almost nomadiclife. My home, at first an oversized camper, later became a 36-foot 5th wheeltrailer with all the amenities. I would move from spot to spot sometimes stayingin hotels or nicer motels. I was buying new clothes about 5 times a week, newsheets too. Socks and underwear I just tossed in the trash. And I say I wasnever crazy! All I was trying to do was stay ahead of the fibers and the dirtyfeeling and the crawling, biting madness that stole my sleep. I lived indriveways and in back alleys. Even though I still held my job some peoplethought that I was a fugitive of some kind. So yes, there was the crazy butthere was a lot of comedy involved too! If you can't laugh you won't survive!As the 1990s rolled on I realized I needed to settle somewhere. A change inrailroad jobs took me to Barstow, California of all places – Barstow, known fortaking advantage of the traveler in distress. But it was also in Barstow that Imet and worked with a guy who while at work one day asked if I felt OK. “Why?” Iasked. “Well, because you’re several different colors and it looks like s**t iscoming out of your skin”. Yep, he actually said that. He was right and he couldsee it for what it was. So things were changing - someone other than me also sawit and knew it was real and very strange.By now, I’m into my 50s and the fibers are everywhere, not just on me buteverywhere around me, stuck to the headliner of my car and all around the housecovering everything. When I wasn't struggling to keep my job I was struggling toclean everything I lived with. Sweat would pour out of me, as I sat doingnothing. I was in and out of Emergency Rooms, suffering from toxic shock ordehydration. I carried an Epinephrine pen as an accessory. Morgellons wouldravage my feet and legs 24/7 with crawling and biting. “Sounds like restless legsyndrome” the doctors would say. Right. Nights were spent scratching and gettingin and out of the shower. My back felt like it was alive, living a separate lifethan my own. I realized that if I didn't find help I would soon end my life andmove on.So with a bit of help here and there I arrived at the end of my 57th year. Thensomething happened that turned my life around. The phone rang and a good friendscreamed excitedly telling me to turn on the TV news channel. When I did I washit like a bolt of lightening. There on the TV were pictures of my fibers andsomeone somewhere was treating it like a disease of the body! WOW! I thought atfirst this was a trick but soon found it to be the path to the next 8 years of atreatment.Of course, the few medical professionals who were offering treatment knew verylittle about the disease but at least they believed in it and were committed tohelping. I was warned that since no hospitals accepted this as a “real” disease,treatment would take place at home and might make me feel better but could makeme feel worse at first. Even if the treatment would make me worsen to the pointof dying, it still sounded great, as long as I got a chance to call it by it'sname and kick it's a**!So that's what I have been doing for about 8 years now and starting to see moreimprovements with each passing day. I had to retire from my job – yes, with allthis going on I still managed to work nearly 35 years at the same place. Medicalbills have eaten up my savings over the years but I do ok. The VA [veteran’sadministration] recently admitted me for care and medications so I am thankfulfor them.Whatever causes Morgellons disease takes its time and doesn't rush to destroythe host. It sure brings about destructive behavior by those of us sufferingwith the disease since we are pre-judged by the medical community who seemsatisfied with overlooking the physical illness and sending victims off to beplaced on mental health watches. It's all very nerve-wracking to the newlyinfected, the freshly unclean, the shunned ones. Shunned people commit suiciderather than face another day of hearing \"Now take it easy, you know the doctorsaid it’s all in your mind”.Some people choose suicide, but not me. I am a fighter. The only fear I ever hadwas that when death came I would still not know this disease by name. One thingabout antimicrobial drugs is that, given the right combination, you can actuallyget better. Eight years now and every day things change and when things turn badit isn't long before there comes an overall improvement in my condition. I hearthat treatment may last for at least as long as you've had symptoms. I seriouslydoubt that I'll live to be 130, so treatment for me is going to be for life.Over the years I have lost numerous friends to all kinds of ways to die but the5 that stick with me are the deaths of guys I grew up with living in northeastLos Angeles. Each and every one of the 5 had \"undiagnosed bacterial infections\"listed on the autopsy reports and nobody seemed surprised or even cared. Whereare the medical people that look into this type of reporting or does it just getlisted and forgotten? I don't see the CDC [Center for Disease Control] rushingout to check dead people who have \"Undiagnosed bacterial infections”. WHY NOT?Undiagnosed means that while alive these guys were infected and their doctormissed it. Boy, I can't wait to read my autopsy report. I wonder what percentageof the population has to die and have \"undiagnosed\" and \"contributing\" listedbefore someone at the CDC sits up and listens. I guess we'll have to wait andsee.Each day brings on new changes and new problems and nobody knows how this willend for me. I know that it took over 50 years for me to get the chance to fightthis disease and for that I am thankful. Morgellons disease is still very much amystery but it can only continue to hide if we continue to ignore those whosuffer from its unforgiving rampage and the toll it takes on the victims itchooses to invade. I refused to be ignored or convinced that I was a mentalcase. I thank my Dad for that resolve and ask each of you to please notvictimize the next person who tells you there are “strings” coming out of theirfingers. Don't do what has been done before. Make the changes to change lives!It's important that you understand that all of what I am saying here ispersonal, my opinions, my views and all true to me, a half-century in themaking. The people who know me have always said: \"if you don't want to hear thetruth don't ask Bill\". A very good friend of mine when asked why she alwaysadvises others to \"ask Bill\" replied, \"Because when nothing seems right, crazymakes sense\". About 5 years into treatment with a specialist I dropped by my primary caredoctor’s office for a visit. The look on his face, the way he went speechlessmade all the nurses laugh. He said, \"You've done it!\" “It” being that I hadproven to him that I wasn't nuts. But again that's just between him and me. Ithas not changed anything for the next person who suffers with Morgellonsdisease.I can't tell you how many times I have been asked about what it has been like tolive like this and survive in a world that seems to be against me. You come toaccept the ignorance that surrounds you even when it costs you family andfriends. It's part of the cost of being first on your block with an unknowndisease.About 2 years after I started treatment I entered my doctor’s waiting room andit was full of sad, sick suffering people. After about 10 minutes a young girlwas asked what she wanted out of treatment. She pointed at me and said, \"I wantto smile like he does\". She had come from Australia to the U.S. looking forhelp. That was a while ago and I hope she got that smile she wanted. This iswhat Morgellons is and what it does and it happens every day somewhere and maybeeven to somebody you love. We need to change the way we all look at the wayspeople suffer. We need to change ourselves to help others change as well.From the writings of Bill Pitt[Image00002.jpg]William Bruce PittMay 13, 1948 – January 29, 2015RIP, BillReading Bill Pitt’s story, and the story of Cindy Casey in the first chapter,gives the reader a feel for the horror and isolation of Morgellons disease andintroduces some of the disease’s primary symptoms. Unfortunately, there are manymore agonizing symptoms that MD patients share, one of them being insatiable anduntamable itching all over the body. The next chapter discusses the phenomenonof itching, not only as a symptom, but also as a potential diagnostic sign ofnumerous diseases.ITCHING: BOTH SIGN AND SYMPTOMFundamental to Morgellons disease is an intense urge to scratch, also known asitching or pruritis. Itching can either be the cause of a skin ailment (throughscratching) or a result of it. Intense scratching can cause reddened orexcoriated skin confounding the issue of cause versus effect. Many heath careproviders persist in believing that the typical Morgellons lesions are a directresult of scratching even though patients continually report that the lesionsappear independently. A basic review of pruritis as sign or symptom demonstratesits many causes.Pathophysiology of ItchingItching, like other skin sensations, is a self-protective mechanism. The itchsensation serves to warn the body of harmful external threats such as plants,insects, and parasites. The origins of itching can be dermal (irritation to theskin), neuropathic (due to damage to sensory nerves), neurogenic (originating inthe central nervous system without evidence of nerve damage), psychogenic, ormixed. Itching can be elicited by external mechanical factors (e.g., insectbites, sunburn) or by internal, chemical mediators including histamine,neuropeptides, prostaglandins, tryptase, bradykinin, serotonin, acetylcholine,Substance P, Prostaglandin E, leukotrienes, or cytokines. Regardless of itscause, itching can be exacerbated by hot weather, psychological stress, skininflammation, and skin vasodilation.Itching and pain share a common neural pathway. Inflammatory mediators such asbradykinin have been shown to sensitize nociceptors (sensory nerve cells thattransmit messages of discomfort to the spinal cord) for both itch and pain. Thesensations of itching and pain interact antagonistically; the induction of pain(e.g., intense scratching, heat, or cold) inhibits itching through centralmechanisms, whereas the reduction of pain (with centrally-acting opioid painmedications) enhances the itch sensation by disinhibition.Itching as an Indicator of Systemic DiseaseIn the absence of a rash, itching can be an early indication of underlyingsystemic disease. Studies have shown that as many as 36% of pruritic patientshave underlying systemic diseases and that itching is often the first symptom ofthe disease. Before initiating an investigation into the dermatologic,neurologic, or psychosomatic origins of a pruritic condition, the followingsystemic diseases should be considered: gall bladder disease, hepatitis,systemic lupus erythematosus, uremia, lymphoma, hypothyroidism, hepatitis C,human immunodeficiency virus, neoplasms, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diabetes,hepatitis B, and iron deficiency anemia. It is incumbent upon primary careproviders, psychiatrists, and dermatologists to investigate the possibility ofsystemic diseases when patients complain of severe itching. Itching should neverbe considered psychopathic until systemic diseases have been ruled out.Unfortunately, Morgellons patients suffer many other symptoms besides intenseitching. These will be reviewed in detail in the chapter that follows.THE SYMPTOMSThe symptoms of Morgellons disease are unusual and unlikely-sounding and it isnot surprising that anyone hearing about them for the first time would bedoubtful and incredulous. I know that I was. The thing that made me a believermany years ago was the consistency of patients’ descriptions of the exact samebizarre symptoms. When I first began seeing MD patients in my office there hadbeen no media coverage of the disease and it was not being discussed on theInternet. It was implausible that this diverse group of patients wascollaborating about what they were going to tell me! When I started to hearidentical symptoms from dozens of people from all walks of life I began to payattention and take a closer look at what was going on.The following list of symptoms is based on data that I have collected over theyears from hundreds of patients. There are actually more symptoms than arelisted here but these are the ones that are most frequently reported. Allpatients have filaments but not all have every one of the following symptoms. Inregard to the photographs, I know there will be disbelievers who think that thephotographs have been altered or that the items that have already come out ofthe skin are actually debris found in the environment. However, I have seen allof these things in my office and know that the photographs you will see and thesymptoms I am about to describe are very real.1. Intense itching (this symptom has been reviewed in the previous chapter).2. Disfiguring, spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions. In a smallpercentage, these lesions turn into large, deep wounds that will not heal.3. Tough, difficult-to-remove scabs with keratin projections on the under side.4. Blue, white, red, and black hair-like filaments extruding through the skin orseen just under the epidermis using magnification. Some filaments are flattenedand ribbon-like.5. Thicker, translucent filaments that are visible without magnification and arevery resistant to extraction.6. Filaments that look like “feathers” because of the many fine projections fromeither side of the filament.7. Shards” of keratin that project down into the dermis causing pain until theyare removed.8. Black specks, “fuzz balls” and seed-like objects on clothing, skin and bedlinens.9. Hyper-pigmented, hypertrophic scars when the lesions first heal. These scarseventually become hypo-pigmented.10. A waxy film on the skin all over the body as well as gobs of “gelatinous”material.11. Occasional black tar-like exudate from the pores.12. Metallic “glitter” on the face and other parts of the body.13. Crystal-like exudates from the skin.14. A change in the texture or color of the hair.15. Hair loss, to the point of total baldness in some.16. An awareness of tiny flying insects around the body.17. Blackening and crumbling of the teeth.18. Fine markings on the skin that appear spontaneously but look like catscratches or paper cuts.19. Slightly raised, liner “tracks” on the skin.20. What look like small “cocoons” coming from the scalp.21. A soft, mushy “mound” on the crown of the head.22. Susceptibility to static shocks and inability to wear watches of sit infront o a computer.23. Systemic symptoms including profound fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, joint andmuscle pain, headaches, loss of balance, dizziness and cognitive disturbancessuch as loss of short-term memory, and inability to concentrate or comprehend.24. The constant and unnerving aggravation of feeling as though there are bugsor worms crawling through one’s body, biting, stinging, and causing unbearablediscomfort.As if the symptoms of the disease were not challenging enough, patients areforced to endure ridicule and abandonment by family, friends, and health careproviders. Typically patients have futilely consulted as many as 20 to 30different clinicians. With no hope in sight, it is no wonder that mostMorgellons patients have depression, anxiety and/or suicidal thoughts and manyhave ended their lives. A discussion of what is currently known about thesymptoms follows.The lesionsThe unusual thing about the lesions of MD is that they appear spontaneouslyalthough they look as though aggressive scratching may have caused them. Somepatients do not have the lesions but the majority do and some have very fewwhile others are literally covered by them. The lesions are very slow to healand are therefore unlike similar-looking lesions caused by other conditions.Another interesting aspect of these lesions is that they do not tend to developsecondary infections with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, aswould be expected if the lesions were caused by scratching.Some patients report that a certain part of their body is particularly affectedand covered with lesions. I have seen a predominance of lesions on the face,arms, hands, back and/or legs of the MD patients I have examined. For manypatients the heavily affected area is the scalp. Patients have been known toshave their heads in an effort to keep hairs from becoming matted in the seepagefrom these open sores. Having a shaved head also facilitates application oftopical medications or soothing creams to the lesions.Patients have reported that when they apply a bandage to a lesion or even to asimple cut on the skin, the bandage becomes “shredded” by filaments. Totalocclusion of the lesions seems to help them heal, at first, but when theocclusive dressing is removed the lesion and filaments reappear with avengeance. At least 4 different types of pathogenic bacteria have been found inthe lesions. This will be discussed in a later chapter when current research isreviewed.[Image00003.jpg] Image 1: Patients often present to the office looking likethis. Color versions of all photographs in this book are available onwww.gingersavely.com/morgellons-book[http://www.gingersavely.com/morgellons-book][Image00004.jpg]Image 2: Lesion with black filaments.[Image00005.jpg]Image 3: Lesions on scalp with hair loss.The ScabsThe tough scabs or calluses that form over many of the lesions not only containmasses of intertwined filaments of various colors but, most peculiarly, thick,firm, gelatinous projections on the inner side of the scabs as shown in thephotos that follow. Using Gomori Trichrome stain, Middelveen and colleaguesfound these “plugs” (as patients refer to them) to consist primarily of keratinand to gradually harden in consistency over time. Significant pain relief occurswhen patients are able to remove the scabs containing these projections. Forthis reason, patients are often seen picking, which is perceived as moreevidence that the disease is psychopathic when relief of excruciating pain isthe actual objective.Of the following photographs, the first 3 show thin scabs containing intertwinedfilaments and the next 5 show tougher scabs with keratin projections or casts onthe underside. Look carefully at these keratin projections that are found underthe scabs of MD patients. I can think of no other human disease where somethinglike this is seen and it would certainly not be expected in someone with apurely psychiatric disorder!The photograph below, Image 4, when visualized in color, shows bright bluefibers intertwined within a patient’s scab. See this photograph in color onwww.gingersavely.com/morgellons-book[http://www.gingersavely.com/morgellons-book] .[Image00006.jpg]Images 5 and 6 [Image00007.jpg][Image00008.jpg]Images 7 and 8: Follicular casts seen at 100x magnification on the underside ofremoved calluses. from MD patients.[Image00009.jpg][Image00010.jpg] Images 9 and 10: Although these scabs showing keratin “plugs” were removed fromone of my patients, they look very much like those seen in cows with BovineDigital Dermatitis.[Image00011.jpg] [Image00012.jpg] Image 11: A scab with keratin projections underneath as well as a filament thatwas growing down into the dermis.[Image00013.jpg]Large, deep, non-healing lesionsA picture is worth a thousand words when it comes to this symptom. Photographson the following pages are not for the faint of heart. Luckily, few MD patientshave lesions this deep and large, although most patients have at least onesmaller version of a deep lesion, which usually starts out as a circular “hole”.I have primarily seen these types of lesions on the face but they can be onother parts of the body as well. Not surprisingly, facial lesions this dramaticare quite an embarrassment to the patient.These deep wounds often appear to go down to the bone and they do not heal formany years. Wound care experts are baffled because every kind of wound healingmethod imaginable does not work. Biopsies reveal “non-identifiable fibers” andpatients are accused of inserting these into their wounds. Interestingly, I haveheard of several instances of these large wounds finally starting to heal once abiopsy is performed on them. I can only guess that the biopsy, being a newinjury to the skin, stimulates the immune system to begin the healing process.There is no doubt that these wounds are like nothing ever seen before and arejust one more peculiar aspect of this curious disease.The following 5 photos are of an ill-fated male patient who suffered a series ofthese deep lesions. Unfortunately, this man’s profession requires him to meetthe public daily, making his appearance a constant source of embarrassment. Thefirst photograph shows a hole on the left side of his face, the first of manydeep lesions that appeared later in the same area. The next 3 photographs showthe progression as the lesions take over the left side of his face. The fifthphotograph shows what the area looked like after all the deep lesions he hadsuffered there had temporarily healed.Image 12[Image00014.jpg]Image 13[Image00015.jpg]Image 14[Image00016.jpg]Image 15[Image00017.jpg]Image 16: Same patient after his numerous facial lesions had temporarily healed.Later his face opened up again in several new places.[Image00018.jpg]Following this paragraph is a photograph of one of these deep lesions on thetesticle of one of my patients ( Image 17 ). If these wounds are self-inflicted(as many clinicians say they are) can you imagine that any man would want to dothis to his testicle? Filaments and thick shards of keratin work their waythrough this patient’s wound causing him extreme pain. He spends hundreds ofdollars per month on bandaging supplies because there is a constant stickydischarge from the lesion. This man had seen many specialists before he saw meand none of them were able to diagnose his problem or help him in any way. Mostwere downright insulting to him.[Image00019.jpg] The filamentsOriginally thought of as “textile contaminants” the filaments are now known tobe composed of the body’s own proteins, collagen and keratin, resulting fromproliferation and activation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes in the epidermisand stemming directly from these cells. Collagen is the most abundant protein inthe human body and is what holds the body together. Keratin is a key componentof nails, hair and the outer layer of skin.A problem for researchers is that textile fibers tend to attach themselves tothe lesions and to the Morgellons filaments, adding confusion to the overallpicture. Textile fibers actually do look like MD filaments under microscopy. Itis only with the use of Gomori Trichrome and other specific stains thatfilaments can be clearly differentiated from textile fibers.Filaments come out of MD patients’ bodies in every way imaginable. They are inthe mouth, gums, tongue and inner side of the cheeks. They come out of the eyes,ears and nose. Filaments are in urine and in seminal and vaginal secretions.They frequently grow out from under fingernails and toenails. Since agastroenterologist told me that he has seen the filaments in the colons of 2 MDpatients, there is every reason to believe they are present throughout the body.Interestingly, whenever an MD patient sustains an injury to intact skin such asan abrasion or even a paper cut, before long the injury becomes a new site offilament proliferation.Researchers have seen retained cell nuclei at the base of filaments where theystem from the cell. Like human hair, on cross section MD filaments have acortex and a hollow medulla. Using electron microscopy, the blue Morgellonsfilaments are shown to have scales much like a normal human hair. In contrast,some MD filaments have a smooth outer surface. The filaments are thick and tough, fine and hair-like or flat and “ribbon-like”.The thicker ones can be seen without magnification and I have always comparedthem to the look of nylon fishing line – translucent, tubular and very strong.These tougher filaments cannot be cut with scissors and are highly resistant toextraction. One of my West Texas patients said, “I wish I could market thesefilaments because I swear they would be strong enough to pull a tractortrailer”.The fine filaments can be black, white, blue or red and occasionally evenorange, green, or purple. These filaments are nearly impossible to see withoutmagnification. The fine filaments are strong as well: it is very difficult toobtain a punch biopsy from an MD patient since the intermeshed filaments willnot break.Patients have told me that of all the colored filaments, the red ones cause themost pain as they move through the skin. The red MD filaments are an unusualcolor of red and are actually more of a magenta/pink color. It is unknown howthe magenta filaments get their color. The blue Morgellons filaments have beenshown to contain granules of melanin, which may be responsible for theircoloration. (Melanin is the pigment that gives color to human eyes, hair andskin.) Research has shown that the colors of the filaments are actual pigmentsrather than dye. Since dye is the origin of color in textile contaminants, thisis one more piece of evidence that the filaments are not textile, as has beencontinually suggested by those who do not believe in the disease.Many patients think that the filaments are alive and are infective agents. Thisis not the case. The filaments are inanimate objects and are not capable oftransferring MD to others. They may be thought of as by-products of the diseaseprocess. It is my assumption that there may be an electrostatic charge, whichmakes the filaments appear to move after they are extracted. Patients oftenrefer to the filaments as worms, an unfortunate mistake that leads to furtherdoubt and mistrust by their medical providers.When I have tried to extract filaments of all kinds, MD patients describe a painthat radiates over an extended part of their body. The description I frequentlyhear is that it feels as though there is a connected web of filaments, so thatwhen one is pulled it affects a larger network. These filaments are clearly notbeing implanted by the patient, as has often been suggested. Once doctors seethese filaments for themselves and try to cut or extract them, they will beconvinced that they are dealing with something very strange indeed.Image 18: Black and red filaments are seen in the web between a patient’s thumband forefinger. The color version of this photograph is on the book’s frontcover.[Image00020.jpg]Image 19: Clear to white filaments are often seen growing from the underside ofnails of MD patients.[Image00021.jpg]Image 20: Black and white filaments as seen under the epidermis at 200x.[Image00022.jpg]Image 21: A flat ribbon-like filament, this one from a vagina.[Image00023.jpg]Feather-like filamentsIt is not known why certain filaments have this appearance. Following thisparagraph are a few photographs of this type of filament extruding from apatient’s skin. When patients report that feathers are coming out of their body,health care providers understandably take this as evidence that they arementally unstable. Rather than saying that feathers come out of their skin,patients need to be careful to say that they have filaments that vaguelyresemble feathers.Image 22[Image00024.jpg]Image 23[Image00025.jpg]“Shards” of KeratinTheses objects can vary in appearance but are a source of extreme pain forpatients since they project down into the dermis. It is very difficult to removethem but patients are motivated to do so because once they are removed there isgreat relief of pain. I have seen hundreds of photographs of these objectsthrough the years that patients have taken after they are finally successful inremoving them. These shards are similar to filaments in the sense that they aremade from the body’s own proteins due to a proliferation of keratinocytes. Theirsize makes them more painful and difficult to remove than the filaments. Images24, 25 and 26 on the next pages demonstrate the appearance of these keratinshards.[Image00026.jpg][Image00027.jpg]Image 26: A keratin “shard”. [Image00028.jpg] The black specksMorgellons patients are sometimes accused of sprinkling ground black pepper orcoffee grounds upon their skin when they complain of “black dots” on intact skinand in lesions. At the 2010 Morgellons disease conference Randy Wymore, M.D.presented slides demonstrating the difference between coffee grounds, pieces ofground black pepper and the black specks of Morgellons disease as seen byelectron microscopy. The microscopy slides make it clear that the black specksare no more than black filaments coiled up into a tight ball, appearing uponmagnification like a wound-up ball of string. On the other hand, Wymore’s slidesdemonstrate that coffee and pepper sprinkles have sharp edges showing that theywere cut by a grinder.I have watched these black specks appear suddenly upon the skin of my MDpatients. If the patient brushes the specks off of the skin they suddenlyreappear. They may be coming through the pores of the skin but there is no proofof this. The black specks are definitely not , as some patients suspect, tinyinsects that are responsible for their disease.Image 27: A black speck amidst fibers in a skin sample from an MD patient. 70xmagnification. Courtesy of M. Middelveen.[Image00029.jpg]“Fuzz balls”The fuzz balls, like the specks, are tangled masses of fine filaments but arelooser with the appearance of tiny “dust bunnies”. The following photo shows oneof these fuzz balls at a magnification of 60x with the point of exit from theskin at 12 o’clock. ( Image 28 ).[Image00030.jpg]Gobs of gelatinous materialMorgellons patients report that there is gelatinous material coming out of theirlesions and orifices. Clinicians and researchers have received samples frompatients that become covered with what appears to be clear gelatin afterremaining in a container. As mentioned in a previous paragraph, the scabsremoved from MD patients’ lesions have gelatinous projections on the undersideof the scab, which become harder and more painful the longer the scab stays inplace.Some patients who believe they are infested with biting insects have erroneouslyconfused the gelatinous plugs under the scabs with a type of larva or grub.Research shows that this is not the case; larvae are easy to dissect andidentify. Hair follicles of MD patients are covered with gelatin, which can beclear, blue or red. Patients complain that their hair always looks dirty becauseof the exudate from their hair follicles. The researchers Marianne Middelveenand Dr. Eva Sapi both surmise that the gelatinous material is likely alginate,an element of the biofilm produced by the bacteria found in the lesions of MDpatients. I will discuss this further in the chapter on research. The photographon the next page ( Image 29 ) shows the slimy “goop” (as patients often refer toit) with embedded blue, red, white and clear fibers. As a reminder, the colorversions of these photographs may be seen on gingersavely.com/morgellons-book[http://www.gingersavely.com/morgellons-book] . Following the slime photographis a photograph of a single gelatinous plug from the underside of a small scab,immediately after having been removed by one of the CEHMDF nurses (Image 30 ).[Image00031.jpg][Image00032.jpg]Film on the skinWe can only guess what causes the waxy film that patients report on their skin.Morgellons patients tell me that they feel like they should bathe four to fivetimes a day because shortly after bathing they feel unclean again. I have heardthis called “sticky sweats” and some even describe it as slimy. It has beenpostulated that the alginate that is a part of the gelatinous material may alsobe on the skin, causing this waxy feeling. We still do not have an explanationfor this puzzling symptom.I have wondered if there may be acidity to this waxy coating. Acidity on theskin would help explain the common complaint of MD patients regarding cottonclothing. Patients report that when they wear cotton socks or T-shirts theybecome covered with tiny holes after only one wearing. Many MD patients switchto wearing only clothes made with synthetic fabrics.Black tar-like liquid coming out of the skinAbout one-third of my MD patients report this symptom. Some say that this wasone of their early symptoms that gradually disappeared over time. We do not knowwhat this thick black liquid is or why it is present in some but not all of theMD patients.One day as I was speaking with one of my MD patients in the office I recallseeing a bead of black liquid suddenly came out of one of the pores on her face.An MD patient once told me that when she went to the hospital to have alaceration sutured the doctor was horrified to see black fluid coming out of thelesion and stopped mid- procedure, refusing to continue. I have had a fewpatients show me that their brand new white socks were black after one wearingdue to their feet being wet with “black sweat”. Other MD patients have saidthat if they scratch their skin after they have been perspiring, they noticeblack fluid underneath their fingernails.Image 31: The following photo shows this black liquid.[Image00033.jpg][Image00034.jpg]Glitter and Crystal-Like ExudatesThis is one of the most puzzling and difficult-to-understand symptoms that MDpatients report. I have seen the fine glitter myself on the skin of my patients,usually visible only under certain light. I think that the larger clumps thatresemble clear or opaque crystal are somehow related. Sometimes the little“crystals” are hard (Image 32 on previous page ), other times they are sodelicate and fragile that they disintegrate into dust. Patients have placedthese crystals in bottles to send to researchers but the bottles arrive empty;the samples appearing to have vaporized. The researcher Marianne Middelveenplans to do x-ray crystallography of these exudates.Change in the texture of the hairAt the 3 rd annual Morgellons disease conference in 2010, Dr. Randy Wymoreshowed an electron microscope image of several hairs from the scalp of an MDpatient that clearly showed a filament coiling itself tightly around eachindividual hair. This probably accounts for the change in hair texture thatpatients often complain about, saying that their hair has become thicker andcoarser. If black filaments are coating the hair this also explains why MDpatients sometimes say that their white or gray hair has turned dark again. “Myhair is not my own” is something that I frequently hear from MD patients.Patients make this statement in an attempt to describe what is happening to thembut unfortunately, it leads doctors to think that they are mentally unstable.When black filaments grow out of the scalp and replace hair that is white orlight blonde it may appear as though the hair has been dyed black. The short,white hair of one of my elderly male MD patients turned black, leading hisfriends to tease him about having dyed it. My patient knew that the black“hairs” that his friends were seeing were actually black filaments growing outof his scalp.A complaint that I hear from patients who have long hair is that it can beperfectly combed and an hour later, even if the patient has been sitting stillthe whole time, there will be a tangled, matted mess of fine hairs at the napeof the neck. Facial hair undergoes a change as well. Both male and femalepatients describe a thick growth of “peach fuzz” on their cheeks, in other wordsblonde, downy hair that is sometimes growing towards the ears instead ofstraight down. I have seen this on men and it is an entirely different type ofhair than their normal beard growth.Image 33: Filaments tightly wound around a human hair at 200x.[Image00035.jpg] Hair lossMost MD patients report hair loss but only about 5% become totally bald. Somehave a patch of baldness, usually on the crown of the head (a photo of this willsoon follow). Hair may die and fall out because the filaments grow out of hairfollicles and probably compete with hair for nutrients. Another possible reasonis that the hair becomes brittle and unhealthy due to being encircled byfilaments. My patients who have bought wigs to wear after suffering significanthair loss tell me that filaments growing into them cause a tangled mess, quicklyruining their wigs. I saw this for myself once when a patient removed her wig inmy office.Awareness of tiny insects flying around the bodyAbout half of my MD patients share this complaint. Patients may indeed have anincrease of tiny flying insects around them due to a different scent coming fromtheir body but there is no way to know this for sure. Many of my Morgellonspatients say that they have noticed a different and strange body odor since theinitiation of their symptoms. Plus, there are the open, often oozing lesionsthat may somehow attract small insects. Unfortunately, some MD patients telltheir doctors that these minuscule flying insects are the cause of theirtroubles, believing that the insects are laying eggs under their skin. However,none of the researchers believe that these insects are the cause of MD. It isvery difficult to convince some MD patients that tiny flying insects are not thereason for their symptoms.Blackening and crumbling of the teethDentists have called me from all over the United States perplexed as to whypatients with the symptoms of Morgellons disease have teeth that are black alongthe gum lines and falling apart. The teeth are not decaying; they are literallycrumbling into pieces or becoming hollow on the inside so that they are nothingmore than thin shells. We do not know why this is but I have had a hunch thatwhatever is causing MD may be leaching calcium from the body. I have also heardpatients complain of tiny holes in their fingernails. It would be interesting toconduct research on this, looking at the dental records as well as the bonedensities of MD patients.[Image00036.jpg]Image 34: Blackening of teeth close to gum line.Photo courtesy of Katie Yussuf.“Scratch Marks” on the SkinBelow is a photograph of a woman’s left breast showing an example of themysterious “scratches” that spontaneously appear on MD patients’ skin (Image 35). Patients have actually watched as these markings occur right before theireyes. The explanation for these scratches is unknown but at times they doresemble the “striae” that are typical skin manifestations of Bartonellosis, asseen in the photograph that follows on the next page.[Image00037.jpg] [Image00038.jpg]Image 36: Streaks on an MD patient’s skin consistent with Bartonella striae.Linear, raised “tunnels” or “burrows”These raised areas are the same color as the surrounding skin and are not red,as would be expected in someone with dermatographism (a hypersensitivityreaction that occurs when someone’s skin is scratched and a red welt is leftexactly where the scratch mark was made). There are no theories as to whatcauses this type of marking. The photograph below (Image 38 ) and the photographon the next page (Image 37 ) demonstrate this finding.[Image00039.jpg][Image00040.jpg]“Cocoons”Morgellons patients shed material from their scalps that they believe to be\"cocoons\". Researchers have shown these to be follicular sheaths in which thefilaments are forming. Often the filaments are tightly wound around thefollicular sheath and can have the appearance of a small, white cocoon. It isimportant that patients not refer to these objects as cocoons, even if there isa strong resemblance, because this terminology can prejudice health careproviders against them. A photograph follows (Image 39 ).[Image00041.jpg]Soft Mound on the Crown of the HeadMD patients often complain of a soft mound on the crown of their head that feels“mushy” to the touch. This mound is a particularly intense area of all of thepatient’s unpleasant sensations. The soft, mushy feeling of this mound isbelieved to be due to the gelatinous material present in the base of the hairfollicles. On the following page is a photo of one of my patients who shaved hishead allowing this mound to be clearly seen. If a patient experiences partialbalding it is almost always in this circular area at the crown of the head.Image 40, shows this mound on the crown of a shaved head.. [Image00042.jpg]Image 41: Mound with lesions, showing loss of hair in that region.[Image00043.jpg]In the case of only one of my patients this mound “erupted” into a round lesion,with a diameter of about 4 inches, deep enough to expose the skull. For cosmeticreasons, the patient convinced a plastic surgeon to surgically close the woundby. A few days after surgery the sutures burst open at which time my patient wasaccused of pulling them out herself. This allegation both shocked and offendedher since she wanted nothing more than to have the unsightly lesion closed andhad paid quite a bit of money to see that it was.Crawling sensations under the skinThe crawling, biting and stinging sensations that MD patients experience aremore than likely a combination of two processes. First, as the filaments pushthrough and finally exit the body there is considerable discomfort due to injuryto the skin. Patients have told me “I feel like I’m being stuck with pins butfrom the inside out”. Also, a large part of the discomfort may be neuropathiescaused by inflammation of the peripheral sensory nerves. Damaged small nervefibers can cause sensations that are perceived as biting, stinging and crawling.Due to the inflammatory nature of Lyme disease, Lyme patients who do not have MDoften have feelings of crawling, biting and stinging as well. But, in the caseof Lyme disease, these sensations are solely neuropathic in nature and there areno lesions or filaments. That which MD patients experience is far worse, becausethey actually have clear evidence of filaments working their way through theskin.Propensity to static shocks and inability to wear watches or sit in front of acomputerI have noted clinically that a significant number of MD patients havebelow-normal levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the hormone that gives amessage to the kidneys to reabsorb some of the fluid that passes through them.Patients with low ADH have a condition called Diabetes Insipidus (DI) , anunfortunate name since it has nothing to do with “sugar” diabetes which isDiabetes mellitus . About 1 in 25,000 people in the general population developDI but I see it to some degree or another in about a fourth of my MD patients.People with DI feel thirsty all the time and urinate frequently. They cannotstay hydrated because they eliminate fluids as fast as they drink them. Thesepatients have saltier skin, which predisposes them to increased static shocks, asymptom often reported by MD patients.Saltiness of the skin would also help explain the electrostatic movement thatpatients report when their filaments appear to move on their own as theyprotrude from the epidermis. It may also explain patients’ reported inability towear watches (because they stop) or sit in front of a computer screen (becausethey feel increased movement in their bodies when they do). This is allconjecture on my part.Systemic SymptomsAlmost all of the MD patients I have treated have had systemic symptoms alongwith their skin symptoms. These symptoms are essentially the symptoms of Lymedisease and tickborne co-infections. The malaise and fatigue are profound. It isdifficult to sleep and patients wake up in the morning feeling like a truck hitthem. There is mental confusion including attention deficit, processingproblems, and poor short-term memory. A new onset of anxiety and panic attacksis typical. There is pain in the joints and/or in the muscles. Many patientshave neuropathies – nerves that are painful, burn, tingle or feel icy cold.The list of tickborne infection symptoms experienced by MD patients goes on andon and includes cardiac symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath andpalpitations; gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea anddiarrhea; urinary symptoms like frequent and painful urination; and neurologicalsymptoms like muscle twitching, dizziness, loss of coordination,hypersensitivities and difficulty walking.A comprehensive list of the symptoms of Lyme disease, available atwww.lymedisease.org [http://www.lymedisease.org] will leave the reader amazed tosee dozens of symptoms affecting every body system. The fact that MD patientsexperience so many systemic symptoms that are typical of Lyme and othertickborne diseases strengthens the speculation that MD is a physiological ratherthan a psychosomatic illness and that it has some kind of connection withtickborne infections.SummaryAfter hearing about the symptoms of Morgellons disease you are either eager tocontinue reading to find out more about this enigmatic disease or you havedecided to put this book down, having reached the conclusion that the writer haslost her mind. I hope that your decision is not the latter, although I certainlywouldn’t blame you if it were. Please have faith that what you are about tolearn will be eye opening, even though at times disturbing and unbelievable. Ifit is difficult to read about the symptoms of MD and see photographs of itsravages, only try to imagine how dreadful it must be to be one of its victims,suffering not only the pain of the symptoms but the indignity of being labeled adrug abuser or a delusional psychotic. The next chapter will discuss these twodiagnoses, the most common misdiagnoses conferred upon Morgellons patients:drug-induced formication and delusions of Parasitosis.THE MOST COMMON MISDIAGNOSESThe con diti ons most often confused with Morgellons disease are drug-inducedformication and delusions of parasitosis. Both of these diagnoses are frequentlygiven to MD patients who present to hospital emergency departments in a state ofpanic, agitation, and extreme discomfort.Drug-induced FormicationDrug-induced formication is a sensory hallucination initiated bypsycho-stimulant drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines. Abusers ofpsychostimulant drugs often have a sensation of bugs crawling all over theirbodies, referred to as “coke mites,” “meth mites,” or “amphetamites” dependingupon the offending agent. Patients with this drug-induced disorder often createopen lesions on accessible areas of their skin due to picking and scratching.Morgellons patients who present to hospital emergency departments covered withlesions and complaining of “bugs” biting them are usually accused of being drugaddicts.The majority of patients with Morgellons disease have no history ofpsycho-stimulant drug use and their skin lesions appear spontaneously. Mostimportantly, MD patients, as opposed to patients with drug-induced formication,have filaments that perforate their skin in locations throughout the body,including areas that a patient would not be able to reach with his own hands.Delusions of Parasitosis (DOP)In the late 19 th and early 20 th century medical literature, the condition thatwe now know as DOP was referred to as parasitophobia (fear of parasites).Karl-Axel Ekbom, MD, a Swedish neurologist, proposed a new way of thinking aboutthe condition in his 1938 paper published in Acta Psychiatrica et NeurologicaScandinavico . Ekbom, whose legacy includes the naming of the condition“Restless Leg Syndrome”, published a literature review and seven detailed casehistories of Scandinavians diagnosed with parasitophobia. He pointed out thatnone of the patients whose cases he described suffered from sensorymisperceptions, delusions of reference, grandiosity, substance abuse or symptomsof schizophrenia, as would have been expected had they truly been delusional.Ekbom cautioned that a delusional diagnosis should never be given to a patientwithout first performing a thorough physical exam. He advised against thefurther use of the term parasitophobia pointing out that none of these patientshad a fear of having bugs in their skin – they were sure that they had them.Since most of the patients in Ekbom’s review of the parasitophobia literatureranged in age from 50 to 70, he proposed a new name for the condition - “Presenile Delusion of Infestation”.Apparently, the new name did not catch on. In fact, after the publication of his1938 paper, the disease began to be known as Ekbom’s Syndrome. It is unfortunatethat his name became associated with a delusional condition since Ekbomspecifically wrote that he did not believe these patients to be delusional (itis not clear why he used the word in his proposed new name). In fact, hesurmised that these supposedly delusional patients had legitimate physicalsymptoms (probably paresthesias) that they perceived incorrectly. Ekbom statedhis case that these patients are not delusional by making the following points: 1. “The symptoms are concrete, detailed and convincingly described.” Furthermore, the symptoms do not fit neatly into any of the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric illnesses. 2. Each patient reports that symptoms are worse in a certain part of their body and they do not waver in this description. 3. Some patients do not blame their symptoms on insects or other pests. 4. Scratching does seem to temporarily alleviate the itch. 5. The sensations remain unchanged for long periods of time. 6. Most patients are able to distinguish between their complaints and their interpretations (can be convinced that the symptoms are not due to “bugs”). 7. The symptoms can disappear with a change in environment. 8. A single hallucination not accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms is very rare.It is interesting that of the seven cases Ekbom described, three reported ahistory of syphilis, a disease that was rare in Sweden. He did not know what tomake of this finding although he did point it out in his paper. Ekbom madereference to a 1935 paper by J. Vie in which six of eight reported cases of this“delusional” infestation reported a history of syphilis. This association isfascinating considering that syphilis is caused by the spirochetal bacteriumTreponema pallidum , the cork-screw-shaped first cousin of Borrelia burgdorferithat causes Lyme disease.I was stricken by the fact that in all of the reported cases, despite detaileddescriptions of physical exams, patients’ skin was never examined with lightedmagnification. Furthermore, the fact that Ekbom’s patients did not complain offilaments suggests that they may not have had MD. As will be discussed in thenext chapter, people who have neurological paresthesias (unusual sensationscaused by damaged nerves), including biting, crawling and stinging sensations,do not have MD if they do not have filaments. In fact, I am often asked if Idiagnose everyone with Morgellons disease who comes to me expecting that theyhave it. The answer is no, because some of these patients have paresthesiaswithout filaments and therefore do not qualify for an MD diagnosis.In the DOP literature, one learns that DOP patients often refuse to accept apsychiatric diagnosis for their skin symptoms, and continue to insist that theyhave a parasitic infestation. In medical school, physicians learn about the“matchbox sign” of DOP, so-called because patients used to bring samples of“hair,” “lint,” or “fuzz” to the physician in a matchbox in an attempt toprovide evidence of the agent responsible for their torment. When two peopledescribe symptoms of DOP, the condition is termed folie à deux (madness of two).Folie à trois (madness of three) and folie à quatre (madness of four) may alsooccur. Delusional parasitosis affecting all members of a family is consideredfolie à famille (madness of family). A new term, cyberchondria describes thosewho become so sympathetic to what they read about a disease on the Internet thatthey begin to have the symptoms themselves.Morgellons disease differs from DOP in a number of ways. First, MD is seen inchildren and children are not known to develop delusional disorders. Second, DOPoccurs in patients with normal physical functioning, whereas almost allMorgellons patients have significant impairment in physical functioning.Finally, the association with Borrelia burgdorferi and other bacteria suggeststhat Morgellons disease has a somatic rather than a psychiatric etiology.Antipsychotic medications such as pimozide or risperidone are often prescribedfor DOP patients but are rarely effective. It has been postulated bypsychiatrists that the reason antipsychotics are not helpful is that patientsare reluctant to take them as directed. Of course, the other obvious possibilityis that they do not work because the patient is not psychotic!The diagnosis of DOP is rare in the United States with a prevalence estimated at2.37 to 17 per million per year. It affects both sexes equally beneath the ageof 50 but over the age of 50 the male to female ration is 1:3. The most commonage of onset ranges between 55 to 68 years. The average duration of DOP is 3years with symptoms resolving spontaneously. In some cases, it may last fordecades. There are no particular predilections for DOP and patients have noprior history of psychiatric problems. Many sufferers are high functioning,intelligent professionals including doctors, lawyers, and psychologists.A review of the literature on DOP reveals a couple of other interesting findingsabout DOP: 1) onset is more likely in warm weather months, and 2) onset usuallyoccurs after a severe psychological stress. So, in review, we are looking at acondition that has always been very rare but is now increasing in incidence,that is seasonal, that follows immune-suppressing stressful events, that happensto people with no psychiatric history, that resolves spontaneously in some ofits victims, and that may occur in more than one family member at a time. Thissounds more like an infection than a delusion, does it not? In fact, a recentexplosion in the number of patients with the symptoms of Morgellons disease hasgiven rise to a virtual epidemic of “Delusions of Parasitosis”. The suddenprevalence of DOP raises suspicion that these unfortunate people may actuallyhave had a real, unrecognized disease all along.Relationship of Morgellons Disease to PsychopathologyThe psychopathology observed in Morgellons patients appears to be attributableto the disease itself, with the disease ultimately affecting the ability of somepatients to distinguish reality from delusion. This aspect of the disease mightbe compared to the clinical course of infection with Treponema pallidum , thespirochetal cause of syphilis, which in the early stages exhibits skinmanifestations, and left untreated, can result in severe neuropsychiatricpathology. Unfortunately, when a patient presents with obvious psychopathologythere is a tendency on the part of the clinician to assume that thepsychopathology is the primary rather than secondary condition.The syphilis model highlights a basic premise of psychosomatic dermatology: thediagnosis of a delusional disorder must be based on the presence of a primarypsychiatric illness rather than the absence of known disease. At the 2016Morgellons disease conference in Austin, Texas, Robert Bransfield, M.D., apsychiatrist who specializes in treating Lyme disease patients, gave apresentation in which he stressed that a psychiatric diagnosis should never be adiagnosis of exclusion. If a health care provider is unable to narrow down thecause of a patient’s symptoms, an automatic referral to psychiatry is notappropriate.The prevalence of delusional disorders in the United States is estimated in theDSM-5 to be about 0.02% and the prevalence of mood disorders about 5% (AmericanPsychiatric Association, 2013). Dr. Bransfield reviewed the backgrounds of 3000self-reported cases of MD and found pre-existing delusional disorders and mooddisturbances to be no more prevalent than would be expected in the generalpopulation. In the case of MD, it has been my conjecture, based on clinicalobservation, that the factor inducing the skin disease triggers secondarypsychopathology that may be erroneously confused with a primary delusionaldisorder.Thus, when psychopathology is observed in MD patients it is the result of thedisease rather than the cause of it. I have noted that patients often developOCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), becoming obsessed with their affliction andcompulsive about removing their painful filaments. Patients become extremelyanxious and a new onset of panic attacks is common. Many MD patients arediagnosed with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) because of the cognitivedysfunction that is a symptom of their illness. I roughly estimate that about athird of MD patients develop some degree of bipolar disorder, fluctuatingbetween severe depression and hypomania. I do not have statistics on thedevelopment of psychopathology in MD patients but the CEHMDF and I have observedthat a small percentage of patients ultimately become paranoid delusional. Inthese situations, a psychotropic medication can assist the patient in copingwith the disabling anxiety stemming from the delusions. The psychotropicmedication will not cure their disease but it will help the patient to morecalmly approach what they need to do in order to heal.Drug-abuse and DOP are not the only misdiagnoses conferred upon Morgellonspatients even though they are the ones most frequently made in urgent caresituations. The next chapter reviews the many different skin conditions that maybe confused with Morgellons disease and the ways in which each of these skindiseases differs from this new filament disease.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF MORGELLONS DISEASEWhen a patient presents to a health care provider with an array of symptoms, thefirst thing the practitioner does is to formulate a differential diagnosis. The“differential” (it is usually shortened this way) includes all of the conditionswith similar symptoms that need to be ruled out in order to arrive at a correctdiagnosis. For example, the differential for abdominal pain is extensiveincluding, but not limited to, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroenteritis,appendicitis, gallstones, diverticulitis, mesenteric thrombosis, or cancer.Morgellons disease is almost always misdiagnosed leading to prolonged sufferingfor the patient and a reduced chance of recovery. It is important to review thedifferential diagnosis for Morgellons disease because it is essential tounderstand the differences between MD and other similar skin diseases. Includedin this differential diagnosis are psychosomatic, drug-induced, allergic,neurologic, metabolic, autoimmune, and primary or secondary infectiousdermatological processes.Systemic diseases, as discussed previously, should be ruled out beforeinvestigating the cause of any skin condition. The psychosomatic anddrug-induced conditions in the differential were reviewed in the last chapter:drug-induced formication and delusions of parasitosis. The rest of thedermatological differential will be listed below, focusing specifically on skinconditions that are characterized by itching, multiple lesions, and pervasivediscomfort.Contact or Atopic DermatosesXerosisAlso called asteatotic eczema, xerosis is the name for skin that itches due todryness and flakiness. Xerosis occurs more often in older adults and during thewinter months. Patterns of redness are observed in the areas that are mostfrequently scratched.Allergic contact dermatitisContact dermatitis occurs when a patient comes in direct contact with asubstance that is an allergen. Common culprits are cosmetics, laundrydetergents, latex, nickel, and poison ivy or oak. Contact dermatitis rashes areconfined to the exposed area and vary in severity according to the dose per unitarea exposed.Atopic dermatitisReferred to as the “itch that rashes”, atopic dermatitis is a skin manifestationof systemic allergy, usually occurring in those with a personal or familyhistory of allergies or asthma. The presence of a profuse or highly localizedarea of dryness or redness, rather than intradermal filaments and discrete,randomly located lesions, differentiates Morgellons disease from rashes due toxerosis, allergic dermatitis, or atopic dermatitis.Neurological DermatosisCutaneous Sensory Disorder (Cutaneous dysesthesia). Patients with diabetes andcertain neurotoxic infections may experience paresthesias, which includefeelings of crawling, biting, stinging, and profuse itching. The condition issometimes known as cutaneous sensory disorder. In contrast to Morgellonspatients, these patients have no visible skin manifestations and no filaments orother unusual objects extruding from their skin. Even Lyme disease patients whodo not have Morgellons disease often have paresthesias.Hereditary or Disease-Associated DermatosesThe perforating dermatoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by theelimination of elastic or collagen fibers from the upper dermis through the skinand include the following five diagnoses: Kyrle’s disease, perforatingfolliculitis, reactive perforating collagenosis, elastosis perforansserpiginosa, and acquired perforating dermatosis. The perforating dermatoses areassociated with hereditary diseases including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,osteogenesis imperfecta, Down’s syndrome, and Wilson’s disease. They may also beseen in patients with brittle diabetes mellitus or dialysis-dependent renalfailure.The perforating dermatoses are distinct from Morgellons disease because theprotruding filaments are made up of elastic or collagenous tissue that is easilyidentified by histopathology. In addition, Morgellons patients rarely have theunusual hereditary conditions or severe metabolic abnormalities associated withthe perforating dermatoses. Conversely, systemic and neuropsychiatric symptomshave not been associated with the perforating dermatoses, and they do notrespond to antimicrobial therapy.Skin Conditions with Infectious CausesThe differential diagnosis for Morgellons disease includes the following skininfections: Scabies; bed bugs; Tropical Dermatoses; Strongyloides; CutaneousLeishmaniasis; Bacillary Angiomatosis; Endemic Treponematoses and Herpes Zoster.A review of these dermatoses follows.ScabiesScabies is a transmissible skin infection caused by infestation with themicroscopic mite Sarcoptes scabei and characterized by extreme itching at night,superficial burrows, and a secondary hypersensitivity reaction . The infestationis found primarily in the webbing between the fingers and in the skin folds onthe wrist, elbow, or knee. MD patients are often misdiagnosed with scabies atfirst but the lack of the typical scabies skin distribution or mite infestation,the absence of easy person-to-person transmission, and the presence of filamentsdistinguishes Morgellons disease from scabies.Bed BugsBed bugs ( Cimix Lectularius ) are parasitic insects of the Cimicid family thatfeed exclusively on blood. Many Morgellons patients are misdiagnosed with bedbugs or are convinced that that is what they have after researching on theInternet. It is easy to see how this mistake could be made since both aretypified by very itchy lesions with the sensation of something crawling underthe skin. I did once remove a bed bug from an MD patient’s lesion but I am surethat it had adhered to the patient’s sticky lesion when she had come in contactwith it. People suffering from bed bugs do not have the filaments in theirlesions that are characteristic of Morgellons disease.Tropical DermatosesThe tropical dermatoses are caused by parasitic infections, includingfilariasis, onchocerciasis, and cutaneous larva migrans. These dermatoses areprevalent in the tropics, and the skin lesions are associated with eosinophilia(elevation in a specific type of white blood cell), lymphatic obstruction (infilariasis), subcutaneous nodules (onchocerciasis) or serpiginous skin lesions(larva migrans). Diagnosis is made when the causative nematode is detected inskin biopsy samples. In contrast, eosinophilia is not reported in Morgellonspatients, and nematodes have not been identified in skin biopsies of Morgellonspatients. However, the tropical dermatoses may respond to treatment withanthelminthic medications (used to treat worms and nematodes) such as ivermectinand thiabendazole and anecdotally, antihelmintic therapy has been shown to beuseful in treating Morgellons disease.Strongyloides stercoralisMany of the MD patients I have examined have been convinced that they areinfested with Strongyloides parasites, commonly known as threadworms. It hasbeen my experience, that when Morgellons patients are treated with ivermectin,the drug of choice for threadworms, many report a decrease in symptoms. However,Morgellons disease patients do not have stool cultures that are positive forovum or parasites, and the filaments found in the skin of Morgellons patientsare not worms, but rather inanimate objects.Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CT)CT is a skin infection caused by one of about twenty different species of theleishmania protozoa and transmitted through the bite of a female sandfly. Thedisease may present viscerally, although the cutaneous (skin) form is moreprevalent. CT occurs primarily in the Middle East, Northern Africa, and in theAmericas from Texas to Argentina. The presence of ulcerated lesions, which formatrophic scars, is one characteristic CT shares with Morgellons disease.However, CT is rare in the United States (in the absence of recent travelhistory to an endemic region), the lesions are not painful as they are inMorgellons disease (unless they become secondarily infected), and there are nofilaments reported or visualized on exam.Bacillary angiomatosis (BA)Caused by a cutaneous or visceral infection with the bacteria Bartonellahenselae or Bartonella Quintana, BA is characterized by red, sometimesulcerated, papules or nodules all over the body. In my experience many MDpatients do test positive for antibodies to one of the Bartonellas, however, BAusually responds dramatically to the antibiotics doxycycline or erythromycinwhereas MD does not. The appearance of BA may be similar to that of Morgellonsdisease, however, a careful examination of BA lesions with magnification doesnot reveal the filaments characteristic of MD patients.The Endemic TreponematosesThe endemic treponematoses are forms of non-venereal syphilis and include yaws ,bejel, and pinta . They are caused by spirochetes of the genus treponema andthey all manifest in multiple stages involving the skin. Although threedifferent kinds of spirochetes have been found in the lesions of MD patients,B.Burgdorferi, H.pylori and T. denticola, the specific treponema spirochetesresponsible for the endemic treponematoses have not been found in tissuebiopsies of MD patients.Herpes zosterCommonly known as shingles, herpes zoster is a painful and pruritic cluster ofvesicular (fluid-filled) lesions and is a reactivation of the varicella-zostervirus, which resides in the nerves long after the patient’s first infection withthe virus (“Chicken-pox”). Unlike Morgellons lesions, the lesions of shinglesare vesicular and tend to erupt along neural dermatomes. Shingles usuallyresolve spontaneously but the disease course may be ameliorated by anti-viralmedications. In contrast to MD, there are no filaments in zoster lesions.Dermatoses Secondary to Skin TraumaThe diagnoses in the differential that are skin problems resulting fromscratching or other trauma are folliculitis, prurigo nodularis, and impetigo. Adiscussion of each of these conditions follows.FolliculitisFolliculitis is a minor infection that starts in the hair follicles and oftenoccurs in both men and women in body parts that have been shaved. Raised,inflamed, bumps may occur all over the affected area . Morgellons patients areoften misdiagnosed with folliculitis because at first glance there is asimilarity between the two conditions. However, Morgellons lesions occursporadically all over the body, and not necessarily in shaved areas, and containthe characteristic filaments that are lacking in the lesions of folliculitis.Prurigo NodularisThe cause of prurigo nodularis is unknown and therefore it is unclear as towhether it is a skin infection in its own right or one that is the result ofintense itching and scratching. Pruritic, discrete nodules often begin in thehair follicles and when scratched, form an excoriated, flattened top, followedby a hard crust. Treatments are usually topical and include glucocorticoids,topical vitamin D3, and capsaicin. Thalidomide and cyclosporins have also beenused. Treatment response is variable and lesions are slow to heal, forminghyper-pigmented scars. Confusion with MD is understandable as the two diseasesshare many similarities. In fact, there is a dermatology professor who lecturesthat what MD patients actually have is prurigo nodularis. However, in contrastto biopsies of Morgellons lesions, biopsies of prurigo nodularis lesions revealeosinophilia and do not contain the filaments diagnostic of MD.ImpetigoWhen insect bites or other itchy lesions are scratched, there is a risk ofsetting up an infection in the open wound by the resident skin bacteria,Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus . The infection, calledimpetigo, is more likely to occur when the skin or nails are dirty and thus ismore commonly seen in children. Victims have excoriated lesions with crustyyellow scabs. In contrast to MD lesions, impetigo lesions do not containfilaments and the lesions will often heal with the application of a topicalantibiotic that targets Staphylococcus aureus , the predominant cause ofimpetigo. The bacteria that cause impetigo have not been found in the lesions ofMD patients and the MD lesions do not heal when a topical antibiotic is applied.SummaryIn summary, the factor that differentiates Morgellons disease from all of theseother skin conditions in the differential is the presence of filaments under andprotruding from the skin. This particular feature of MD is the disease’s unique,identifying factor. That is why a skin examination with lighted 60x to 100xmagnification is crucial because to miss the filaments is to miss the disease.But how do you diagnose a disease that doesn’t exist in medical textbooks andhas no known cause and therefore no reliable lab tests for diagnosis? Thefollowing chapter provides insight into this challenge.DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIAClinical Case DefinitionDiagnosis of a disease without a known cause or valid diagnostic test requires aclinical case definition in order to assist clinicians inexperienced with thedisease in validating the presenting patient’s concerns. A clinical casedefinition is also required to determine who qualifies as a “case” for purposesof epidemiological inclusion. Furthermore, formulating a clinical casedefinition is a required first step for clinically based research to ensure thatpatients being studied are a homogenous group. In the absence of a diagnostictest, the current understanding of Morgellons disease is based primarily on thefrequency and consistency of the symptoms that are characteristic of itssufferers.Clinical case definitions of diseases are traditionally based upon a list ofsymptoms and physical abnormalities that are most commonly seen in the disease’ssufferers. The list is formulated with the consensus of the health careproviders who have the most experience with the disease.The Morgellons Research Foundation established a draft case definition for MD in2007 that included the following 3 criteria: 1. Skin lesions, both spontaneous and self-generated with intense itching. Lesions progress to open wounds that heal abnormally or incompletely. 2. Crawling sensations both within and on the skin surface. Often conceptualized as “bugs moving, stinging or biting” intermittently. May involve scalp, nostrils, ear canal, mouth, head and body hair. 3. Fatigue significant enough to interfere with activities of daily living.This preliminary clinical case definition was inadequate. The distinctive anddiagnostic feature of Morgellons disease is the presence of microscopic,subcutaneous filaments that work their way through the skin causing itching,pain, and open lesions. The filaments were not even mentioned in this early casedefinition. I propose that the clinical case definition simply be that patientsmust have filaments under and protruding from the skin, since this is thedistinguishing feature. Patients with MD present with many different symptomsand not every case is the same. The presence of the filaments is common to allof them and crucial to an MD diagnosis.Laboratory AnalysisPatients often ask why I do not send a biopsy of one of their lesions to acommercial laboratory for diagnosis. Skin biopsies of MD patient lesionsanalyzed by commercial laboratories have revealed non-specific pathology or aninflammatory process with no observable pathogens. Unfortunately, commerciallaboratories look for what is already known and use a basic algorithm to narrowdown pathogens into known categories. When a new pathogen appears on the scene,commercial laboratory pathologists are not oriented towards or equipped todiscover new organisms. Only research laboratories do this and researchlaboratories cannot legally diagnose patients.Biopsies that are performed on MD patients have included fibrous materialprojecting from inflamed epidermal tissue which laboratories label as “textilefibers”. However, a more thorough analysis of the filaments, performed by theFederal Bureau of Investigation forensics lab, revealed that MD filaments do notresemble textiles or any other man-made substance. Furthermore, as we willdiscuss in a later chapter, research by Middelveen et al shows the filaments tobe made of the inert, organic materials, collagen and keratin.If a clinician were to send MD patient scabs or tissue to a commerciallaboratory, it would be most helpful to order examinations using silvernitrate-based histochemical stains like Dieterle or Warthin-Starry . This is astraightforward technique for pathologists and would allow spirochetes to bevisualized in the samples. Although the type of spirochete cannot bedifferentiated using these stains, at least the presence of a bacteria notnormally found in the skin could sway a clinician against a delusionaldiagnosis!SummaryIf all health care providers were to utilize a systematic, non-judgmentalapproach with each and every patient, despite the patient’s appearance,behavior, race, color, creed, or symptom oddity, the risk of neglecting ormisdiagnosing patients would be greatly reduced. It has been my experience thatpatients with rare and unusual symptoms report that the lack of reassurance andvalidation they experience is as painful as is the disease itself. Documentingthe subjective symptoms of Morgellons disease patients and taking them seriouslywill enable sufferers of the disease to have a voice, to feel respected andvalidated, to experience hope, and to contribute towards their ultimatevalidation – the legitimization of their disease.In summary, diagnosis of Morgellons disease involves: 1. The practitioner having an open mind and taking the time to investigate 2. Validating the patient’s concerns and committing to help 3. Ruling out the conditions in the differential 4. The patient reporting classic symptoms of MD (as described in detail earlier) 5. The practitioner seeing filaments, with the assistance of lighted magnification, either protruding from the patient’s skin or just underneath the outer layer of skin.If a patient does not have filaments, they do not have Morgellons disease.Unfortunately, many patients and their health care providers do not take thetime to carefully examine the skin with lighted magnification and, when they do,they lack the confidence and experience to differentiate what they are seeing.The next chapter explains how to examine the skin of an MD patient. Expensiveequipment is not necessary; patience and perseverance are the keys.SEEING IS BELIEVINGWhen I first started examining patients with MD I would break out in a coldsweat and feel my pulse rise and the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Thereare certain things you are not supposed to see coming out of a human body andall of a sudden I was seeing the strangest things, making me question my sanity.In fact, in my early years of examining MD patients, I would always call in acolleague to verify that I was seeing what I thought I was seeing.A Confusing Picture – at FirstRarely are the filaments of Morgellons patients visible with the naked eye.Dermatologists usually carry a dermatoscope in their pockets but these scopesare typically only capable of 10-14x magnification. A magnifier that is at least30x but preferably 60x to 100x is required and it should be lighted to help withvisualization. Having a UV (ultraviolet) light on the magnifier is particularlyhelpful in differentiating filaments from human hairs because MD filamentsfluoresce under UV light.With a little experience, it becomes easier to see the difference between hairsand filaments without a UV light. Hairs come to a fine point at the end whereasthe filaments have a tubular or ribbon-like look to them. The filaments areusually smaller in diameter than hairs and are often seen intertwined. Thedermatologists who have looked at Morgellons skin at 60 - 100x magnificationreport that it is easy to distinguish between the two once the filaments havebeen seen a few times. Accidental contaminants from the environment can sometimes stick to any sort ofopen wound. It is not uncommon to find some actual textile from clothing and/ordust contaminant from the air in the lesions of MD patients. This can beconfusing to health care providers and researchers at first. However, once theysee the unique patterns of Morgellons filaments, they are able to easilydistinguish the difference. Dermatologists, who are used to seeingenvironmental contaminants embedded in skin lesions, say that it is notdifficult to distinguish MD filaments from accidentally attached debris.After years of searching for filaments in MD patients and trying many differenttypes of magnifiers to achieve this, both the nurses with the CEHMDF and I havenarrowed the choices down to two options – one that is very inexpensive and onethat is not. The latter is not necessary but is helpful if you are a health careprovider wanting to document your findings. I will discuss these two optionshere.The Magnifier Everyone Can AffordThe inexpensive but nonetheless effective way to look for filaments in and onthe skin is a gadget that you can find on eBay. This tiny hand-held 60x lightedmicroscope is easy to hold and work with and even has a UV light. These littlescopes are sold new on eBay and I last saw them there for $3.27 each with freeshipping, which is affordable by anyone’s standards. The price varies and issometimes as low as $2.09. When the battery dies it costs about the same toorder a new magnifier as it does to replace the battery, so order several atonce!The exact name of the item for your search on eBay is “Jewelry Loupe LEDMagnifier 60X Mini Microscope Pocket Magnifying Glass UV Light”. One drawback ofthis low-cost magnifier is that you cannot show exactly what you are seeing toanyone else and you cannot photograph what you see for documentation. Anotherpotential drawback is that the magnifier ships from China and so you may wait 4to 6 weeks for delivery.The ProscopeThe more expensive yet unrivaled method for finding and documenting skinfilaments is the ProScope HR or HR2 by Bodelin Technologies . Placing thishandheld device on the skin allows everyone in the room to see the same image asit displays on the computer screen. At any point in time, a photograph may betaken of an image to save to the computer’s hard drive. This feature makes iteasy for patients to send digital photographs to their doctors and for doctorsto transport images into the patient’s medical record. Costs at this writing are$400+ for the HR and $700+ for the HR2, which has higher resolution andtherefore clearer photographs.There are other options besides the Proscope that are very similar in function.I have not taken the time to compare them so I am not familiar with the pros andcons of each. You may want to look around on the Internet for what you can find.I can only speak for the ProScope having successfully used that one. I have nofinancial interest in any of these products.The most important thing for practitioners to do is to take the time to look.The filaments are often not seen on the first try and many different parts ofthe body may need to be examined. It is unfortunate that MD patients presentthemselves in such a way to health care providers that their symptoms are oftendiscounted and an exam of the skin is never conducted. A later chapter discussesthis unfortunate situation. PART TWO DEMOGRAPHICS “Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can becounted counts.— Albert EinsteinPREDISPOSITIONS TOMORGELLONS DISEASEPredispositions to Morgellons disease, based on my clinical observations and theresults of my descriptive study, are a compromised immune system, cigarettesmoking, and Lyme and/or other tickborne diseases. Psychopathology, contrary tothe opinion of many clinicians, is NOT a predisposition to MD. A discussion ofthese disease predispositions follows.Compromised Immune SystemMy experience has shown that when patients begin to develop symptoms of MD theyusually have immune systems that are suppressed due to chronic infection (eitherovert or indolent), toxic exposures (physical or psychological) and/orimmunosuppressant therapy. Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome(AIDS), autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoidarthritis, organ transplants, hepatitis C, or other viral or bacterial illnessesare among those who have come to my office with classic MD symptoms. There arealso patients who unknowingly live in a mold-infested home, are exposed totoxins at work or suffer from a disabling psychosocial environment such as PTSD(post traumatic stress disorder) or living with an abusive spouse. These immunechallenges are often not immediately obvious until evaluation of the skinsymptoms occurs, at which time the thorough clinician should tirelesslyinvestigate to detect the root causes of the patient’s debilitated condition.Cigarette Smoking and Compromised Skin ImmunityThere is strong evidence in numerous studies that smoking cigarettes isassociated negatively with many skin conditions, including poor wound healing,premature aging of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma, psoriasis, hair loss, oralcancers, and other oral conditions. Therefore, patients who smoke cigarettes areat increased risk for numerous skin conditions and skin manifestations ofdisease and/or will experience delayed healing time for these infections. Ofinterest is that my research findings revealed that 39% of my MD subjects weresmokers as opposed to the 17.8% expected for a similarly matched group in thepopulation at large.Relationship to Tickborne diseasesMany patients with Morgellons disease have positive blood tests for tickbornepathogens including Borrelia burgdorferi ( Bb ), the spirochetal bacteria thatcause Lyme disease. Furthermore, Bb was cultured from the skin lesions of 24 of25 Morgellons patients sampled in the research of Middelveen et al. Othertickborne diseases in Morgellons patients, diagnosed by blood tests, includeinfection with the parasites Babesia microti or Babesia duncani , therickettsiae Ehrlichia chafeensis or Anaplasma phagocytophylum , and the bacteriaBartonella quintana or Bartonella henselae . Since ticks are known to harborfungi, parasites, viruses, rickettsiae, and numerous other types of human andplant pathogens, the pathogen that causes MD may prove to be another in agrowing list of tickborne co-infections or it may be a dermatologicalmanifestation of Lyme or one of the other tickborne diseases. More about therelationship of MD with tickborne diseases is discussed in a later chapter.PRECIPITATING FACTORS FOR MORGELLONS DISEASEVarious precipitating events were reported in my study group of 122 MD patientsbut in many cases (24%), subjects were unaware of an association of any eventwith the initiation of their symptoms. The most frequent precipitating eventswere, in descending order of frequency: an infestation of biting insects such aslice or fleas; a recent visit to a 3 rd world country; a splinter, thorn, ordirty cut; working in dirt or exposure to dirty water. Of note is that mostinvolve exposure to unclean situations.Anecdotally, here are some of the reports I have heard from patients in regardto what occurred shortly before their Morgellons symptoms began. 1. A squirrel infestation after the home was vacated for a month while on vacation 2. Cleaning bird nests out of an attic 3. Moving into an apartment that was infested with fleas (this is a common one) 4. Swimming in the Ganges River in India 5. Working in the garden with fertilizer without wearing gloves 6. Wading through a dirty pond 7. Being stuck by a splinter, cactus or rose thorn while working outsideThe fact that patients tend to have been exposed to dirty situations beforeinitiation of their symptoms is another factor raising suspicion that MD has apathogenic rather than a psychosomatic cause.EPIDEMIOLOGY AND DEMOGRAPHICSMuch of the early epidemiology and other characteristics of Morgellons diseasewas based on the data collected by the MRF on their now-defunct website wheresufferers were invited to register and complete a questionnaire. The totalnumber of registrants on the MRF website at the time it shut down in early 2012was over 20,000, which is believed to be a small fraction of the actual numberof cases of MD. In 2012 the OSU Center for Health Sciences Morgellons DiseaseRegistration Database became the new online self-reporting site for MD patients.The OSU registration database went off-line in 2015 at which time it had over12,000 registrants. The CEHMDF is in the process of setting up a newregistration website for MD patients.Inherent selection bias exists in internet-based data collection systems such asthe MRF and OSU websites. Users of Internet resources may over-represent awell–educated, middle to upper-middle class faction of society. This potentiallybiased representation of the population could skew the demographic data.Furthermore, in a self-report, disease-registration system, there is the riskthat participants who register do not actually have the disease or that theirsymptoms are exaggerated to fit what the registrant feels is appropriate to thedisease.In 2012, California, Texas, and Florida were the states with the highestself-reported incidence of Morgellons disease based on both the MRF website andmy published descriptive study. This finding appears to be independent of thefact that these are the states with the largest number of inhabitants becausethe percentage of the population infected was also higher in these states. Forexample, California contains 12% of the US population, but 26% of theregistrants on the MRF web site were from California (MRF). Likewise, Texasmakes up 7.4% of the US population, but 10% of MD registrants were from Texas.In contrast, New York includes 6.7% of the US population, but only 2.3% ofreported Morgellons cases. The OSU website statistics are quite different, withOklahoma, Nevada, and Oregon, being the 3 states with the highest per capitaincidence, based on self-reported data. It is not clear why there is such adiscrepancy in the findings of the OSU database.According to the MRF database, an approximately equal number of males andfemales registered claiming to be affected with the symptoms of MD. The OSUwebsite reported two thirds of registrants identifying as female and one thirdas male. On both sites, there were registrants in all age groups and from allwalks of life: the rich and the poor, professionals and manual laborers, peoplewith basic educations and with those with advanced degrees.In my descriptive study, more female than male patients had Morgellons disease(84.4% female) based upon my in-office examination of their skin. In fact, mysample group consisted primarily of middle-aged Caucasians. My clinic does notaccept any form of insurance and the cash-only visits may have biased towards anupper-middle-class socioeconomic group. This, in turn, may have predisposedtoward Caucasian race and older, more economically stable subjects. There aremany diseases that appear to be predominantly female but this may be due to thefact that females present more often for medical care, a phenomenon that isthought to skew the statistics of many illnesses known to be predominantlyfemale, including chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, lupus, rheumatoidarthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, migraines, gallbladderdisease, and irritable bowel syndrome.In my Morgellons disease study cohort the average age was 47.8 years with arange of 22 to 85. However, I have treated children as young as 9 months oldwith MD and as old as 88. Professions of patients in my study group were variedand did not seem to suggest any particular high-risk profession other than thosewho worked outside and were exposed to dirt. Earlier statistics based on the MRFwebsite self-reporting tool showed a predominance of patients who were employedas nurses. The findings of my study did not bear this out. There may have beenmore respondents to the MRF self-report tool who were nurses and therefore awareof the importance of completing the form in order to make their voices heard.It is now evident that Morgellons disease is seen all over the world. We haveheard reports from all over the United States, South and Central America,Canada, Africa, Asia, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and all ofEurope. I have been asked to speak on the topic at medical conferences in TheNetherlands, Belgium, Austria, England, Finland, and Germany. When I do speakfor these European conferences the doctors who attend are urgently searching foranswers, knowing that their MD patients are experiencing a legitimate disease.There are still skeptics in these other countries, but the fact that manydoctors understand that MD is a grave physiological disease and want to learnmore about it provides hope that other health care providers may soon see thelight. PART THREE THE INTERNET: FRIEND & FOE“Don’t believe everything you hear.There are always 3 sides to every story –Yours, theirs and the truth”.— UnknownJUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS: WHY MORGELLONS PATIENTS ARE OFTEN THEIR OWN WORSTENEMIESIn an earlier chapter, we learned that the Swedish neurologist, Dr. Ekbom,proposed that patients who have been diagnosed with delusions of parasitosis arenot delusional: they are simply inept at describing the very real sensationsthey are experiencing. Unfortunately, in an attempt to explain their unusualsymptoms, Morgellons patients often use descriptions that lead to prejudicialtreatment by clinicians, who automatically assume they have a mental illness.Examples of typical patient expressions are: “parasites have taken over mybelly”, “there are cocoons in my hair”, “tiny shrimp come out of my skin”, “myhair moves and has a life of its own”, or “the skin you see on me is not reallymy skin.” I am constantly coaching my MD patients to list their symptoms in amore descriptive way when speaking to health care providers without giving namesto the things that come out of their bodies. So instead of “shrimp come out ofmy skin”, I advise them to say, “tiny, pink, firm crescent-shaped tissue comesout of my skin”. Unfortunately, patients can be their own worst enemies when notdescribing their symptoms accurately.Due to an abundance of medical information (and misinformation) on the Internet,there is a tendency for patients with all sorts of symptoms to self-diagnose. However, it is best for a patient to list and describe symptoms rather thanprovide diagnoses to their health care provider. Clinicians are trained to knowthe differential diagnosis for each and every symptom and patients who are good“historians” (able to report the history and description of their symptoms indetail) are more likely to be taken seriously than those who come in with a firmbelief in a certain diagnosis.The Parasite ConfusionMorgellons patients often present to health care providers having diagnosedthemselves with a parasitic infection. Patients tend to be confused about thetopic of parasites and understandably so. Let us briefly review the topic inorder to help clear up some of the misunderstandings.In the broadest sense of the term, a parasite is an organism that depends onanother organism for its survival, at the expense of the organism that it isdependent upon. So, the term parasite does not specify a particular type ofpathogen. There are 3 main categories of parasites that cause disease in humans:1. Helminths, 2. Ectoparasites and, 3. Protozoa. These different categoriescould not be more dissimilar. The fact that they all fall under the term“parasite” shows what a broad category the word represents and why there is somuch confusion surrounding it.Helminths are commonly known as worms. Examples of worms that are parasites tohumans are flatworms (flukes and tapeworms), thorny headed worms and round worms(aka nematodes such as filariae). Many MD patients believe that they areinfested with a parasitic worm (a helminth) due to the fact that the filamentsare long and thin, look similar to a worm, and appear to move. The filaments,however, as was reviewed in a previous chapter, have been proven not to beworms, so patients should not jump to this conclusion when describing theirsymptoms to their health care provider.Ectoparasites are arthropods and include lice, mites, bed bugs and other smallbiting insects. Ectoparasites have an exoskeleton (external skeleton), asegmented body and jointed appendages. The term “infestation” is used whenreferring to an ectoparasitic infection. There are many MD patients that areconvinced that an ectoparasite is the cause of their symptoms. The bitingsensations that they experience make them feel as though they are infested withtiny biting bugs so it is not difficult to understand why MD patients would jumpto this conclusion. However, ectoparasites have been ruled out as the cause ofMorgellons disease. Therefore, MD patients should not tell clinicians that theyare infested with “bugs” because they will likely be treated prejudicially.Finally, there are the unicellular, protozoan parasites that, unlike thehelminths and ectoparasites, are not visible to the naked eye. Microscopicprotozoan parasites cause diseases like malaria, amoebic dysentery, giardia,babesiosis, leishmaniasis, and toxoplasmosis. We do not yet know for certainwhether protozoa cause MD although none have been isolated so far in theresearch. However, Morgellons patients who tell clinicians that they haveparasites are usually thinking of helminths or ectoparasites, rather thanprotozoa.Just to confuse the topic even more, certain bacteria can also be parasites and,like protozoa, are microscopic. If a bacterium lives in the human body and usesthe human host in order to thrive and multiply so that the bacterium can then goon to infect others, it is said to be parasitic. Examples of human diseasescaused by parasitic bacteria include salmonella, syphilis, Lyme disease,gonorrhea, cholera, small pox and Bubonic plague. Just to be clear, not allbacteria are parasites!The cause of MD may very well prove to be a parasitic bacterium. But bacteriaare microscopic and, once again, when MD patients state that they haveparasites, they are usually referring to the visible-to-the-naked-eye helminthsor ectoparasites (both of which we know do not cause Morgellons disease) ratherthan the microscopic protozoa or parasitic bacteria. Even health care providers,upon hearing the word “parasite”, have a tendency to think primarily ofhelminths or ectoparasites. This is why it behooves patients not to use the wordin order to avoid confusion or prejudicial treatment by clinicians.In summary, Morgellons disease is not caused by a helminth or by anectoparasitic infestation and when patients use the word parasite, they areusually referring to one of these two categories. Unfortunately, patients can betheir own worst enemies when they describe their symptoms in an inaccurate wayor jump to conclusions about what is causing their symptoms. Health careproviders tend to discount these patients and, unfortunately, jump to theconclusion that these same patients are mentally unstable.DISPELLING THE MYTHSAs mentioned in the previous chapter, the Internet is awash with diversespeculations about the cause of Morgellons disease. It is understandable thatsufferers would spend many hours online researching the cause of their symptoms.Unfortunately, they are often exposed to misinformation. In this chapter, I willlist the most commonly held myths promulgated on the Internet about Morgellonsdisease and how they have been disproven over the years.Myth #1. Morgellons disease is caused by Springtails (Collembola)The earliest research on Morgellons disease was in 2004 when the insectCollembola was suggested as the possible causative pathogen in a paper byAltschuler et al, published in the Journal of the New York Entomological Society. The authors of the paper had found collembola in the skin scrapings of 20patients previously diagnosed with DOP. However, further research by 3 differentresearchers, Wymore, Middelveen, and Sapi, has not corroborated this finding. IfSpringtails were the cause of MD they would be fairly easy to identify. Plus,this type of infestation would not explain the filaments, which are thedistinctive feature of Morgellons disease.Myth #2. Morgellons disease is caused by a GMO (genetically modified organism)The first Food & Drug Administration (FDA)-approved GMO appeared on the marketin 1982. It was Humulin, a type of insulin for diabetics, genetically engineeredby E.coli bacteria. Over the years since then, tobacco and food crops have beengenetically modified with the goal of making crops more resistant to weeds andinsects and promoting longer shelf life of foods.To quote the 1970’s Chiffon margarine commercial, “It’s not nice to fool MotherNature.” Genetically modified foods are a great concern for our health andwelfare since the body reacts with inflammation to ingested substances notrecognized as pure food.It is tempting to believe that the pathogen causing MD could be a GMO. There hasbeen no proof for or against this theory. But the main argument refuting thisposition is that MD has been around much longer than GMOs have, as explainedearlier in this book. GMOs are a relatively new phenomenon. Morgellons diseaseis not.Myth #3. Morgellons disease is caused by something distributed by chemtrailsAccording to the chemtrail theory, long-lasting trails behind high-flyingaircraft contain aerosolized particulate used for geo-engineering,weather-modification and military purposes. It is proposed that this spraycauses the general population to be over - exposed to aluminum oxide and othertoxic metals and chemicals. Heavy metal toxicity is known to burden the immunesystem making those exposed more vulnerable to all kinds of disease.Furthermore, studies have shown specifically that Lyme patients with a heavyaluminum load have more difficult-to-treat infections.So, if in fact there were a relationship between MD and chemtrails, it wouldsimply be that those with immune systems burdened by metal toxicity are moresusceptible to it or to any other disease. Furthermore, we run into the sameconundrum that we face with the GMO theory: the chemtrail discussion startedappearing on the Internet in the 1990s. Morgellons disease has been around muchlonger than that. In summary, chemtrails and GMO’s do not cause Morgellonsdisease. However, they may make certain susceptible individuals more vulnerableto any number of immune challenges, one of which could be Morgellons disease.Myth #4. Morgellons disease is due to mold exposureExposure to toxic molds also places an extra burden on the immune system, makingthose who are exposed more susceptible to all kinds of infections andinflammatory conditions, particularly if they are genetically predisposed tohave difficulty clearing mold toxins. The pioneering work of Richard Shoemaker,M.D. taught us that mold toxicity and Lyme disease are a particularly ominouscombination with exposure to both simultaneously making treatment of either morechallenging. Mold exposure does not cause Morgellons disease but it cancertainly make someone more likely to become ill with it or have a more severe,difficult-to-treat case.Myth #5. Morgellons filaments are filarial worms or another thread-like wormA large number of patients continue to be adamant that MD is caused bythread-like worms called microfilariae. Although filariasis is typically spreadby mosquito bites, it has been known for quite some time that filarial worms arealso in the tick gut along with dozens of other types of pathogens. Therefore,proponents of this theory believe that the microfilaria infection that theypurport causes MD is a tickborne co-infection and therein lies the connection toLyme disease.Patients will often find earlier writings of the late Dr. William Harvey when heserved on the MRF Board of Directors in which he proposed that worms might causeMD. Recent reports that Dr. Alan McDonald has discovered filarial worms alongwith Lyme spirochetes in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients has caused manyMorgellons patients to fear that the fibers of MD are actually filarial worms,just like those found by Dr. McDonald in human brains (photographs of the two dolook very similar).Morgellons disease may very well be caused by a pathogen that is parasitic innature (requires a host in order to survive). However, parasitic worms do notcause MD. The filaments are inanimate objects made of collagen and keratin,normal proteins of the human body. The filaments are not filariasis or any otherthread-like worm. The fact that the filaments occasionally appear to move doesnot mean that they are alive – the movement is most likely due to anelectrostatic charge.Myth # 6. Morgellons disease is associated with the fungus Glomus-versiforme orcaused by some other fungusIt has been tempting from the start to label MD a fungal infection. Thefilaments fluoresce under ultraviolet light, which is true of fungi. The networkof filaments under the skin branch out in different directions similar to thebranching of fungi. Moreover, some MD patients are even helped by antifungals.However, all of the research performed so far has not been able to detect anykind of fungal pathogen.There are many patients who become downright angry upon hearing that theresponsible pathogen for MD is not fungal. They remain quite sure that it isbecause in their particular case antifungals helped them to heal. I am quitesure that I have treated more Morgellons patients than anyone else in the worldand I can guarantee that the vast majority of MD patients do not respond toantifungals.I suspect that in the few cases where patients appear to have derived benefitfrom antifungals it is because they had an indolent, co-existing, fungalinfection and by removing the burden of this underlying infection the immunesystem was able to battle the pathogen responsible for MD. Myth #7. Morgellons disease is caused by allergenic dental materials There is a parasitologist who believes that MD results when dentalamalgams that are incompatible with the human body cause inflammation andneurotoxicity. The resultant damage to the nerves purportedly causes a type ofneuropathy that leads patients to believe that there are bugs crawling on orunder their skin. This theory posits that when the lymphatic system tries toeliminate these toxins, sores break out on the skin that attract other organismsto adhere to them, like fungal spores which cause growths.There has been much written about metal amalgams in the mouth purporting thatthey impair functioning of the immune system due to their toxic nature. So, forthose with metals in their mouths, there may be an increased susceptibility toany number of chronic, fatiguing illnesses – possibly even Morgellons disease.But the sensations that Morgellons patients experience are not merelyneuropathies. There is a reason for the discomfort – there are filaments growingunder the skin. These filaments are deeply embedded and not caused by somethingadhering to the open lesions. Furthermore, as stated previously, research hasshown no fungal component to Morgellons disease.Myth #8. Morgellons disease is caused by an agrobacterium, a bacterium thatinfects treesThe idea that agrobacteria might be the pathogens responsible for MD wasproposed by Raphael Stricker, MD in 2007 and research looking for agrobacteriain Morgellons lesions was performed by Vitaly Citovsky, Ph.D. at the StateUniversity of New York at Stoney Brook that same year. One early study by theMRF had proposed that MD filaments were composed of cellulose, making the ideathat a plant pathogen might be the culprit an enticing idea to investigate. InDr. Citovsky’s preliminary study, all 7 of my Morgellons patients whose skinbiopsies were analyzed revealed evidence of infection with Agrobacteria, whereasbiopsies of 7 control subjects did not.This finding could never be duplicated in other laboratories and contaminationwas suspected in Dr. Citovsky’s lab since he specialized in studyingagrobacteria. Furthermore, it has been discovered that filaments are composed ofkeratin and collagen, rather than cellulose, making the agrobacterium ideahighly unlikely. Therefore, this theory was never substantiated and wasabandoned. Many people today read the old information on this theory andincorrectly conclude that agrobacteria are the cause of MD.Myth #9. Morgellons disease is caused by a Dermacentor or other type ofbarely-visible mite.Most Dermacentor mites are not seen by the naked eye. Many Morgellons patientsare convinced that they have mites because the sensations they experience feellike bites. People certainly can have mite infestations but this is an entirelydifferent issue than Morgellons disease. Again, it comes back down to thefilaments and the fact that if mites were the culprits they would be able to beseen with magnification.Myth #10. Morgellons disease is caused by myiasis (infestation of fly larvae) ofa very tiny flyMyiasis is caused by an infestation with larvae of the human botfly or tambu flyand is most commonly found in tropical areas. The larvae (maggots) can be seenwithout magnification, being 1 to 2 cm long and growing to the size of a gooseegg. The idea that there may be a myiasis infection caused by very tiny maggotsof very tiny flies is a theory that some have come up with to explain Morgellonsdisease, a theory that very many patients firmly adhere to. So far, research hasnot identified any type of insect larva in the skin of MD patients. Plus, onceagain, there is the issue of the filaments, which have no logical explanation ina myiasis theory of MD.Myth #11 Morgellons is a man-made disease, developed for biowarfare that hasaccidentally (or purposely?) been released into the population at large.There has been no evidence that substantiates or disproves this theory. Thisseems unlikely to me but only time will tell.BEWARE OF FALSE PROPHETSAs discussed in the previous chapter, there are numerous unscientific theoriesand rumors regarding the cause of Morgellons disease. Patients are exposed tothese ideas when they search the Internet trying to understand what is happeningto them. Even more unscrupulous than these purveyors of unscientific informationare the “snake oil salesmen” who lead patients down blind alleys and rob them oftheir finances. Any desperate, uninformed group of downtrodden people easilyfalls prey to entrepreneurs without scruples who see a great opportunity to takeadvantage of their vulnerability and misfortune. There have been all sorts ofinternal and external treatments marketed to MD patients with the promise ofmaking them whole again. Desperate people are willing to try any treatment ifthere is the slightest chance of a cure.Patients should be wary of any product salesman who says he can heal them. Manyof these sales people will actually say that they have TREATED thousands of MDpatients. Salesmen do not treat patients. They sell products and will use anymethod that works to make a sale. If a sales person says that every MD patientwho has bought their product has improved, remember that they do not have thelong term follow up with patients that a health care provider does. They are notinterpreting lab results, seeing and examining patients on a regular basis, andfollowing patient symptoms in detail. You can have confidence in a treatment ifa health care provider who has treated many MD patients and tried numerousdifferent treatment methods recommends it. You can be particularly reassured ifthey have no financial incentive to endorse it.Over the years, sales representatives for products marketed to MD patients haveapproached me about endorsing their products or selling them in my office. Whenthey tell me how miraculously effective their products are, I ask if they havepatient follow-up statistics. Usually, their follow up with patients has been nomore than 2 weeks after the patient has started their product. I have noticedthat every topical product an MD patient tries works well for 2 weeks and thenstops working. The same is true for most “natural” antimicrobials. So, unlessthere is long-term follow-up showing continued improvement over many months, Ihave no interest in the product. Petroleum jelly works well as a topicaltreatment for Morgellons patients too – for 2 weeks – and is very inexpensiveand easy to come by! PART FOURTOWARDS UNDERSTANDING “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the timeto understand more, so that we may fear less.”— Marie CurieRESEARCHING A NEW DISEASEResearch on the cause of a new disease involves a considerable amount of timeand money. Expenses include salaries of the researchers, use and maintenance ofa laboratory facility, lab equipment and supplies such as vials and reagents.Most people are unaware of the expensive involved in acquiring lab supplies andthe hundreds of professional staff hours that go into taking just a small stepforward in research.Morgellons disease is still considered a non-disease by most of the medicalcommunity. In other words, it is believed to be a psychoneurotic conditionrather than one with an underlying physical cause. For this reason, obtainingfunding from the usual sources is virtually impossible. About 10 years ago a fewcolleagues and I applied to the National Institutes of Health for grant money tostudy the disease and the reply was “We do not provide funding for research ondiseases that do not exist”.So we are caught in a Catch-22. We cannot prove the disease’s existence as atrue medical condition until we obtain funding for research and we cannot obtainfunding for research until we prove that the disease is a true medicalcondition. The research that has been performed has been thanks to privatedonations and the valuable non-paid time of interested professional researchers.This chapter will review the research on Morgellons disease that has beenconducted so far. There will be some scientific terms that will be difficult forthe lay reader to understand but everyone can benefit from knowing that thereare scientists and clinicians who are working diligently to put together thepieces of this diagnostic puzzle. The reality of Morgellons as a physiologicdisease is becoming increasingly difficult to refute.Jenny HavertyIn late 2004, Jenny Haverty, a clinical microbiologist at Marin General Hospitalin Marin County, California, examined filaments from skin samples of 4 differentMD patients from the San Francisco Bay area. She found that samples containedclear tubular-shaped filaments; clear, red or black ribbon-like filaments; brownfilaments with ladder-like rungs, and smaller filaments that were clear, white,black, red or blue. The red and black filaments did not fluoresce underultraviolet (“black”) light whereas all of the other filaments fluoresced abright aqua color. Ms. Haverty proposed that the similarities in the filamentsof these patients suggested that the causative agent for all 4 cases wasepidemiologically the same.Center for Investigation of Morgellons DiseaseRandy S. Wymore, Ph.D., was the first scientist to perform serious research intothe causative pathogen of MD at the Center for Investigation of MorgellonsDisease established at the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciencesin Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2005.Dr. Wymore was the first researcher to ascertain that: * The filaments are NOT textile or any other manmade substance * The cause of Morgellons disease is NOT fungal * Both Collembola and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia can be ruled out as possible causative pathogens of Morgellons disease * The black “specks” that patients complain of and often think are “bugs” are nothing more than fibers wound up in tight balls * Filaments coil themselves tightly around the hairs of Morgellons disease patients * In contrast to Dr. Vidal Citovsky’s findings, Agrobacteria are not found in biopsies of Morgellons patientsDr. Wymore’s research continues today. In the Wymore lab, they are using acombination of microbiology and molecular biology strategies to further examinethe details of the infective process. In addition to Bartonella henselae (thecausative pathogen of Bartonellosis or “Cat Scratch Fever”), Dr. Wymore and histeam have isolated 3 other bacteria in Morgellons samples collected from adispersed geographic area. These 3 bacteria are all spirochetes: Borreliaburgdorferi (the causative pathogen of Lyme disease), Treponema denticola andHelicobacter pylori ( the last two are discussed below ) . Spirochetes arebacteria that often live in a coiled shape, a shape that is highly motile andable to penetrate deep into the tissues (much as a corkscrew enters the densecork at the top of a wine bottle).T. denticola, a spirochete that is usually associated with periodontal disease,is a genus relative of the Syphilis spirochete ( Treponema pallidum ). H.pylori, the other spirochete isolate in MD biopsies by Wymore’s team, is most commonlyassociated with stomach ulcers. Half of the world’s population is infected withH.pylori but only 10-20% of these people develop an ulcer. Other than stomachulcers, H. pylori have also been associated with autoimmunity, migraines,adrenal fatigue, muscle spasms, tooth decay, allergies, chronic sinusitis,chronic infection, mineral depletion (from neutralizing stomach acid), liver andgall bladder problems. Clearly, there is more that we need to learn about thesetwo spiral-shaped bacteria and their effects in places other than the mouth andthe stomach. Dr. Wymore is in the process of finalizing the confirmation andsequencing of these samples prior to submission of a manuscript for publication.Georgia Department of Public HealthIn 2006, in a response to an outcry from MD patients in Georgia, the Georgiahealth department initiated a surveillance study of “Unidentified DermatosisSyndrome (UDS) aka Morgellons Disease”. A surveillance database was establishedto collect epidemiologic information about patients in Georgia with MD symptoms.The study was never completed and results never published because the Center forDisease Control (CDC) in Atlanta stepped in and started investigating thedisease on a national level.However, the Director of the Chemical Hazards Program of the Division of PublicHealth presented preliminary results of the surveillance study at a Georgiahealth department meeting in September 2007. Collected data revealed that themale-female ratio of responders was about 50-50, there were no notableprecipitating factors to the disease, and the disease had no significantcorrelation with having outdoor hobbies. The majority of reported cases were inthe northern half of Georgia and involved recent contact with upturned soils.No etiological theories were proposed but patients were strongly urged to avoidharsh chemicals to self-treat. According to the Georgia survey, patients hadreported using the following caustic chemicals topically in an effort to stoptheir torturous symptoms: bleach, ammonia, insect spray, dog flea dip, gasoline,kerosene, WD40, Windex, and Lysol.The CDC StudyThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated an investigationinto MD in January of 2008 because they had received so many phone calls aboutthe disease and complaints that they were doing nothing about it. For unclearreasons they did not release results until 2012, two years after the study wascompleted. After spending close to a half million dollars, the CDC was unable tofind a pathogen associated with the symptoms and concluded, “No commonunderlying medical condition or infectious source was identified.”Unfortunately, the press took this information and distorted it, presumably forsensational purposes, with headlines claiming that the CDC study found that“Morgellons disease exists only in patients' minds.” To be clear, this was notthe finding of the CDC study. Absence of proof does not equal proof of absence!In my opinion, the CDC's commitment to research on this topic was disingenuous.The study was poorly designed and previous research on the topic was ignored andnot cited. The researchers looked only for typical skin pathogens and it wasalready obvious that this endeavor would reveal nothing new. Many Morgellonspatients had had their skin biopsies analyzed in commercial laboratories andnothing but “inflammatory changes” had been identified. Furthermore, the CDC’slab analysis methods were far less sophisticated than those being done byvolunteer researchers today.I had offered the CDC my group of pre-screened subjects to use as a study group,thinking that they would be grateful to work with a cohort of patients who allshared the same symptoms and clinical presentation. Rather than taking me up onmy offer, the CDC chose to use the Kaiser-Permanente medical group in the SanFrancisco bay area as their source of subjects. This was perplexing as Kaiserwas not even diagnosing MD. There was no consistency to the CDC study groupbecause subjects included anyone who had presented to a Kaiser clinic withfeelings of biting, crawling and itching! You cannot have a valid research studywithout a homogenous group of subjects with clear inclusion and exclusioncriteria. Furthermore, since Kaiser had become infamous for not acknowledgingMD, my Kaiser patients with MD would not participate in the study because theyrefused to ever go near a Kaiser clinic again after the mistreatment they hadsuffered there.My descriptive studyIn 2009 I completed a detailed descriptive study of 122 clinically confirmedcases of Morgellons disease as a part of my doctoral candidacy work. Therequirement for inclusion as a study subject was the presence of filaments underthe skin, as seen by me in my office. When the results were published in the May2010 edition of Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigative Dermatology it was thefirst time that a peer-reviewed study published in a medical journal suggestedan association between MD and Lyme disease. Of the 122 patients included in thestudy 97% either tested positive for Lyme disease (53%) or were highly suspectfor it, based upon clinical diagnostic criteria (44%). The clinical diagnosticcriteria for a Lyme diagnosis were as follows (5 out of the 9 were required):* History of a Lyme disease diagnosis at any time in the past* History of a tick bite at any time in the past* High exposure risk (living in an endemic area, hiking in the woods, etc.)* Equivalent result on a Lyme Western Blot or presence of bands on the blot thatare specific for Bb, despite the fact that the test result was negative * Positive lab result for any of the tickborne coinfections (Babesia,Bartonella, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, etc.)* Below-normal CD57-positive Natural Killer cell count (a blood test marker thathas been found to be below normal in Lyme disease patients)* Above-normal C4a complement protein, a marker that is elevated in chronicinflammatory infections* Classic Lyme symptoms such as joint pain, exhaustion, cognitive decline, sleepdisturbance, muscle aches, etc.* Flu-like symptoms 4 to 5 days after starting antibiotics signaling a die-offreaction of the spirochetes (called a Jarish-Herxheimer reaction)It is important to note that 3% of my sample neither tested positive for Lymedisease nor were suspect for it based on the clinical diagnostic criteria statedabove. This 3% had absolutely no systemic symptoms along with their MD skinsymptoms and did not react to antibiotics the way that Lyme patients areexpected to.However, the 3% (4 subjects) had other challenges suppressing their immunesystems, including treatment with high dose prednisone for an autoimmunecondition (2), treatment with immune-suppressing, anti-rejection medications foran organ transplant (1) or AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) (1).Marianne MiddelveenIn 2010, after speaking with a few patients in my waiting room, a Canadianmicrobiologist named Marianne Middelveen, became fascinated with Morgellonsdisease and motivated to study the illness on her own time. Ms. Middelveen’sbackground had been in tropical and veterinary diseases and Morgellons remindedher of a spirochetal infection she had known in cows called Bovine DigitalDermatitis (BDD), also known as Mortellaro’s Disease and commonly called “hairyheel warts”.In BDD, ulcerative lesions and keratin filaments are found on the hooves ofinfected cows and collagen/keratin projections are seen under the scabs formedon the lesions. The disease also causes lameness, weight loss and decreased milkproduction in its bovine hosts. Cheli and Mortellaro first described BDD inItaly in 1974. The disease is a serious economic problem in Europe, affecting asmany as 1 in 3 cattle in some European countries. Several bacteria have beenpurported to be responsible for BDD including a spirochete in the Treponemegenus (the genus that includes Treponema Pallidum , which is responsible forsyphilis).My association of MD with Lyme disease intrigued Ms. Middelveen. She went on tocollaborate with several medical doctors and scientific researchers resulting in5 papers published between 2011 to 2015 revealing valuable informationsupporting the legitimacy of the disease as an infectious rather than apsychiatric process. Middelveen and team found Borrelia spirochetes in the skinof every one of 25 MD patients sampled and Borrelia burgdorferi specifically(the causative pathogen of Lyme disease) in 24 of the 25, once again raising theinteresting association of MD with Lyme disease.[Image00044.jpg]Middelveen’s group was also the first to use Gomori Trichrome stain to show thatMD filaments are composed of the body’s own proteins, collagen, and keratin. Thephotograph above ( Image 42) shows a cross section of a Morgellons patient’sskin stained with Gomori Trichrome stain, known to turn keratin red and collagenbluish-green. If you look at the color version of this photograph ongingersavely.com/morgellons-book, you will see the cross sections of keratinfilaments (stained red) and collagen filaments (stained bluish-green) just belowthe keratin rich epidermis (stained red). Photograph used with permission of M.Middelveen.Eva Sapi, PhDEva Sapi, Ph.D. is studying Morgellons disease with the assistance of hergraduate students at the University of New Haven, CT, Department of Biology andEnvironmental Sciences. Using nested PCR (polymerase chain reaction), wholegenome direct sequencing with metagenomic analyses, immunohistochemical and insitu methods, Dr. Sapi’s group has found the presence of two spirochetalbacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi ( Bb ) and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) inMorgellons patients’ lesions. Sapi’s current work is geared towards genotypingthe species of Bb found in MD lesions and finding genetic commonalities in theMD subjects sampled .The photograph that follows ( Image 43 ), at 500x magnification, reveals thepresence of spirochetal structures in MD patients’ skin lesions usingfluorescent immunohistochemical analyses with Borrelia specific monoclonal andpolyclonal antibodies. (Used by permission of Dr. Eva Sapi).[Image00045.jpg]It is important to note that metagenomic analyses, such as those done atPerkinElmer, Inc. for Dr. Sapi, look for all of the genomes present in a sample.All sorts of microbes may be picked up including those that are unculturable oreven unknown. Morgellons researchers have sometimes been accused of findingspirochetes in MD samples because that is what they are looking for. With ametagenomic analysis of a human sample, human DNA will always be present, ofcourse, but there is no way to know what microbial genomes will show up. Inother words, it is impossible to examine the sample with any sort of prejudice.Genomes present in the sample will always be a surprise.Both of the bacteria found by Dr. Sapi, Bb, the cause of Lyme disease andH.pylori, known for causing stomach ulcer s, are spirochetes, the spiral-shapedbacteria that were discussed earlier. Spirochetes prefer not to be in theircoiled form because they are more vulnerable this way. Biofilms are protectivecolonies in which bacteria live. Dr. Sapi’s latest data shows that most of thepathogens found in MD lesions are in biofilm form, a form that is well known tobe antibiotic resistant. One of the major protectors of biofilm is a sugarcalled alginate and Sapi’s group has found this marker in the biofilms of MDpatients. Alginate is gelatinous and may be responsible for the gobs ofgelatinous material on the skin reported by MD patients. Dr. Sapi’s recent work shows that Bb and H.pylori aggregates (dense clusters)and fibers can co-exist in Morgellons disease lesions. Bb and H.pyloriaggregates contain both alginate and amyloid markers such as phospho-tau,suggesting that there are biofilms with amyloid-like changes in the skin samplesof Morgellons patients. Phospho-tau in the MD skin suggests that there could bea specific genetic variation in Morgellons patients making the Bb/H.pyloriinfection produce collagen and keratin filaments. This is all conjecture at thispoint.Epidemiologic studies regarding the percentage of Lyme patients who have MDTwo different epidemiologic studies, one by Peter Mayne, M.D. of Australia(2015) using an Australian cohort and another by Melissa McElroy, FNP of SanFrancisco, California (2016) using a North American cohort have both revealedthat 6% of Lyme patients become victims of MD. This statistic is interesting tome because my guestimate all along, based on my clinical experience, has beenabout 5-10%. These early epidemiological statistics help answer the questionposed by many Lyme disease patients: “Am I doomed to get Morgellons diseasebecause of my Lyme disease?” The connection between Lyme disease and Morgellonsdisease continues to be compelling but if the spirochete of Lyme disease is theculprit, why do only 6% of Lyme patients get Morgellons disease? Dr. Sapi andher team are exploring this conundrum by looking for genetic variants that MDpatients may share in common.Jyotsna Shah, Ph.D. with IGeneX LaboratoriesSince my first involvement with MD in 2003, I had been speaking with Dr. Shah ofIGeneX, Inc. Laboratories in Palo Alto, California about the need for researchinto the connection between Lyme disease and MD and asking for her time andexpertise in researching the cause. Dr. Shah was interested and intrigued but,as director of a large laboratory, time constraints precluded her involvement insuch a project for many years. In early 2016 Dr. Shah came on board and donated her time and lab services to apilot study examining whole blood, serum and skin scraping samples from 10 MDpatients using three laboratory techniques: Immunofluorescenc e Antibody Assay(IFA), Western blot and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Dr. Shah was interestedto find if there were other Borrelia species, besides Borrelia burgdorferi, (theLyme pathogen) involved in Morgellons disease. She was particularly interestedin the tickborne relapsing fever group. Tickborne relapsing fever (TBRF) was first recognized just over a hundred yearsago. The top symptoms are headaches, muscle aches and chills. The diagnosis isoften missed and therefore underreported and new regions of endemicity continueto be identified. Currently, California and Texas are the most highly endemicstates in the US. In 1986, Barbour and Hayes associated TBRF with at least 17different Borrelia species. Four species of Borrelia that cause TBRF are knownin the US: Borrelia hermsii, Borellia perkerii, Borellia turicate and Borreliamiyamotoi . Borrelia myamotoi is closely related to the other bacteria thatcause tickborne relapsing fever but is more distantly related to the Borreliathat causes Lyme disease.In Dr. Shah’s pilot study, samples from all 10 MD study subjects were positivefor antibodies to Borrelia of some kind, either Bb (the Lyme disease spirochete)or one of the relapsing fever spirochetes. Relapsing fever Borrelia were commonto 7 out of 10 samples. Dr. Shah’s recommendation, based on her pilot studyresults, is to perform the following tests on MD patients: Lyme IFA and WesternBlot on serum; Lyme PCR on skin scrapings, whole blood and serum; TBRF WesternBlot on serum and TBRF PCR on skin scrapings, whole blood and serum.In summary, many people who have Lyme symptoms but negative test results may beinfected with other types of Borrelia species that are not being detected on thetests that are currently being used. It has been suggested that the reason thatsome patients in my previously mentioned descriptive study were negative forLyme’s Bb spirochete is that the testing did not include the parameters forother Borrelia infections.Research ContinuesIn September 2016, a group of European researchers and post-doctoral studentsmet in Leipzig, Germany as the first step in a collaborative effort to researchBovine Digital Dermatitis (BDD - the spirochetal cow disease discussed in anearlier paragraph), its relationship to Morgellons disease and possibleeffective treatments for both diseases. Present at the meeting was theveterinary researcher who first described BDD in 1974, Professor Carlo MariaMortellaro of Italy. Also in attendance was Professor Christoph Mülling ,Germany’s leading expert on BDD and director of the University of Leipzig’sdepartment of veterinary research, as well as Carsten Nicolaus, Ph.D., M.D.,owner of the Borreliose Centrum clinic in Augsburg, Germany. Dr. Nicolaus, whoinitiated the collaboration, is an expert on the treatment of tickborne diseasesand an advisory board member for the CEHMDF. Obtaining funding should berelatively straightforward since BDD has caused a significant drain on theEuropean economy.Clearly, more research is needed to unravel the mystery of Morgellons disease.An understanding of the disease’s cause and the discovery of an effectivetreatment is urgently needed since MD patients suffer significant disability. Inorder to progress with research, the first step is recognition of the problem bythe medical community so that funding may be obtained for more expansive andsophisticated studies. This is why the Charles E. Holman foundation and all ofus who are on its board of directors and advisory board continue to work toraise awareness and educate medical professionals about the legitimacy of thedisease.Due to a dearth of funding, research has been progressing in baby steps.However, slowly but surely, researchers are making headway. What continues tosurface in all investigations is the intriguing association of MD withspirochetal bacteria of various types. What are spirochetes and why are theybeing mentioned so often in this book? The next chapter will give an overview ofthis particular phylum of bacteria.THE MORGELLONS / SPIROCHETE CONNECTIONSpirochetes are long, slender bacteria that are coiled into a helical shape.They look somewhat like a mattress spring, except, of course, they cannot beseen by the naked eye. Some Morgellons patients have told me that they seespirochetes in their eyes or in their lesions. This is impossible consideringthat spirochetes are so thin they can rarely be seen even under a regular lightmicroscope (darkfield microscopy is required).An unusual feature of spirochetes is that the flagellum (a “whip-like” appendagethat bacteria use for movement) is internal, which enables this bacterium tomove like a Slinky toy. The ability to alternate between lengthening andrecoiling allows spirochetes to enter deeply into tissues. This motion isfacilitated by the fact that the width of this bacterium is only a fraction of amicron whereas the length is 5 to 250 microns. When seen under a microscope,spirochetes appear to wiggle as they undulate across the field of vision.The most notable genera (plural of genus) of spirochetes are Treponema,Leptospira, and Borrelia. A close cousin, the genus Helicobacter (also helicalshaped), is technically not a spirochete but is often included when discussingthem because of the many characteristics they share in common . The diseasesmost commonly associated with these bacteria are Lyme disease, Syphilis,Leptospirosis, Rat Bite Fever, Relapsing Fever, Bejel, Pinta, Yaws and stomachulcers.The most often discussed of the Treponemes is Treponema pallidum that causesSyphilis; the most well-known Borrelia is Borrelia burgdorferi that causes Lymedisease; and the most disease-associated of the Helicobacter are Helicobacterpylori that cause stomach ulcers. Treponema , Borrelia, and Helicobacter generahave been mentioned throughout this book. Even in Ekbom’s work nearly a centuryago an association with Treponema pallidum was noticed in those who were beingdiagnosed with a disorder known as “parasitophobia”, an earlier name for thosewho we now believe to have Morgellons disease.Bovine digital dermatitis (BDD), the previously discussed cow disease thatshares features with Morgellons disease in humans, is caused in part by aTreponeme . Dr. Wymore and his team found 3 different spirochetes in Morgellonslesions: Treponema denticola, Borrelia burgdorferi and Helicobacter pylori . Dr.Eva Sapi’s group discovered the spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi andHelicobacter pylori in their biopsies from MD patients. Ms. Middelveen andcolleagues have found Borrelia spirochetes in 25 out of 25 Morgellons patientssampled. Finally, Dr. Jyotsna Shah has uncovered 2 different species of Borreliaspirochetes in the samples she has tested.Spirochetes are not the only bacteria found in MD patients’ biopsies –Bartonella species , gram-negative bacteria that are not spirochetes, have beenfound as well. However, one cannot help but wonder about this strikingconnection between spirochetes and Morgellons disease. With future research, wewill watch the resolution of this puzzle slowly begin to unfold.Of all of the spirochetes we have discussed so far, Borrelia burgdoferi (Bb ),the spirochete responsible for Lyme disease, has surfaced most frequently incorrelation with Morgellons disease. In the next chapter we will look at theconnection between Bb and MD and review the evidence that either supports orrefutes the hypothesis that Morgellons disease is a dermatological manifestationof Lyme disease.[Image00046.jpg]Image 44: Photomicrograph of a spirochete (in this case, Treponema pallidum), byBill Schwartz, CDC, Courtesy: Public Health Image Library. Public domain.THE LYME DISEASE CONNECTIONWhat is Lyme disease?Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete, Borreliaburgdorferi ( Bb ). It was named for the town of Lyme, Connecticut, where anoutbreak occurred in 1975. Lyme disease is almost always spread through the biteof a tick although other biting insects may also be culprits. When it isdiagnosed promptly it is not a particularly difficult infection to treat. Theproblem is that Lyme disease is usually missed in its early, more treatablestage.Fifty percent of patients do not get the characteristic and diagnostic “bull’seye rash” and at least that many do not even recall a tick bite. The nymphaltick that spreads the disease is the size of a poppy seed and very easy to misswhen on dark skin or a hairy part of the body. Early symptoms are non-specificand often confused with a virus. Even if a health care practitioner does thinkto test for Lyme disease, current tests have an unacceptably large percentage offalse negatives.When missed in its acute stage, Lyme disease can quickly disseminate throughoutthe entire body wreaking havoc with every body system. It masquerades as manydifferent conditions so the disseminated, persistent form of the disease is evenmore confusing to diagnose than the acute form. When I first evaluate aMorgellons patient they often say something like, “I’ve heard about theassociation between Morgellons disease and Lyme disease, but there is no way Icould have Lyme disease. I would know it if I did, right?” Actually, the answeris no. Most people with persistent Lyme disease do NOT know they have it and aremisdiagnosed with labels like Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Lupus,Multiple Sclerosis, Early Onset Alzheimer’s, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Migraines,Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Interstitial Cystitis, and the list goes on and on.How Lyme disease relates to Morgellons DiseaseI noted the connection with Lyme disease when I first became aware of MD in2003. As reported earlier in this book, 97% of my MD study group had beendiagnosed with Lyme disease, either through positive blood work or high clinicalsuspicion. In addition to the various skin symptoms described in an earlierchapter, almost all MD patients have symptoms that are classic for Lyme diseaseincluding extreme fatigue, malaise, mental confusion, insomnia, muscle and jointpain, muscle twitches, and neuropathies.Fibroblasts are cells that produce collagen and, as discussed earlier, it hasbeen proposed that fibroblasts are where the proliferation of collagen, seen inMorgellons disease, begins. As long ago as 1992, Georgilis, Peakcocke & Klempnerreported that fibroblasts protect Bb from antibiotics and provide a place wherethe spirochetes can continue to survive. In 1993, Klempner, Noring & Rogersreported the ability of Bb to adhere to, penetrate and invade human fibroblasts.The fact that Borrelia bacteria have an affinity for collagen has beendemonstrated in several papers, including one by Wood et al in 2015 (seebibliography).Further strengthening the Lyme association, the work of Middelveen et al showedpositive tests for Bb in 24 of 25 MD patients sampled and the work of Dr.Jyotsna Shah of IGeneX found either Bb or another related Borrelia in all of the10 subjects in her pilot study. Dr. Eva Sapi found Bb to be one of 2 pathogensthat she consistently found in her MD subjects even in the metagenomicsequencing she had performed at PerkinElmer Biotechnology Company in Waltham,Massachusetts.Many people mistakenly believe that Lyme disease is a relatively new phenomenon.Although the name “Lyme disease” and the fact that it is caused by Borreliaburgdorferi came to attention in the late 20 th century, human infection by theBb spirochete has been around for thousands of years as evidenced by the factthat Bb was found in the knees of “Otzi the ice man”, the 5000 year old mummyfound frozen in a northern Italian glacier in 1991. There may not have been acatchy name for the disease until 1975 and an awareness of the causativepathogen until 1982 but even people incorrectly diagnosed with DOP in the early1900s could have been infected with the Bb spirochete that causes what we nowknow as Lyme disease.It is tempting to assume that Morgellons disease is a dermatologicalmanifestation of Lyme disease based on what we know so far. The association iscertainly there. But there is still the possibility that MD may be discovered tobe yet another in a growing list of co-infections of Lyme disease, spread byticks and possibly other biting vectors. Not to disprove the assertion that MDis a manifestation of Lyme, but in an attempt to look at the situationobjectively, I will review some of the findings that may lend doubt to the Lymecausation theory of MD.Playing Devil’s Advocate to the Lyme Causation TheoryThe presence of a bacterium in an ill patient does not necessarily mean that thebacterium is the cause of the patient’s symptoms. This was dramaticallydemonstrated more than 20 years ago when it was surmised that Epstein-Barr Virus(EBV) was the cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Because EBV titers wereelevated in CFS patients, patients were told that EBV caused their illness.Years later we learned that EBV titers are present in nearly everyone and riseopportunistically when the immune system is challenged. Correlation does notimply causation. After a cursory look at the search engine PubMed, I was able to find journalarticles reporting 10 other skin conditions in which biopsies of lesions wereculture positive for B. burgdorferi spirochetes when the patient also happenedto have Lyme disease. B. burgdorferi were found in the skin biopsies of patientswith the following skin conditions when the same patients were seropositive forBb (Lyme):Cutaneous sarcoidosisPrurigo PigmentosaGranuloma AnnulareNecrobiosis lipoidicaNecrobiotic xanthogranulomaErythema annulare centrifugumInterstitial granulomatous dermatitisMycosis fungoidesLobular panniculitisCutaneous sclerodermaSome may claim that this indicates that all of the above-named dermatoses arecaused by the spirochete that causes Lyme disease, in other words, that they aredermatological manifestations of Lyme. This seems unlikely to me. A more likelyexplanation, based upon our awareness that Bb spirochetes tend to seek outweakened and injured parts of the body, is that the Bb that caused thesepatients’ systemic Lyme disease was drawn to their co-existing dermatoses. Isthis the same case with Bb in Morgellons lesions? We are not yet prepared toanswer this question definitively.Later, in the chapter on treatment, I will explain that Lyme disease treatmentdoes not cure MD patients. Treatment that focuses on management of the bacterialinfection Bartonellosis has a much higher clinical efficacy. Eight Bartonellaspecies and subspecies are known to cause disease in humans. Bartonellosis canbe transmitted by cat scratches or by the bites of ticks, mosquitos, sand fliesor fleas. (Interestingly, many Morgellons patients recount that their symptomsbegan following a flea infestation.) Bartonella henselae was the mostfrequently found of 4 pathogens identified in MD lesions by Dr. Randy Wymore.Besides Borrelia , Dr. Shah of IGeneX found Bartonella in 3 out of 10 subjectsin her pilot study. Please note that I am not suggesting that Bartonellabacteria cause Morgellons disease. I am just noting that there are otherbacteria besides Bb that are associated with it.Furthermore, if Lyme disease causes MD, why do only 6% of Lyme patients becomeill with MD symptoms? This could be due to immune susceptibilities or geneticpredispositions but it still leaves pause to wonder.I am not claiming to know what causes Morgellons disease nor am I in a positionto positively refute another’s premise. However, I feel it important to keep anopen mind and not be trapped by logical fallacies as has often happened inmedical research. I am the first person who brought the correlation ofMorgellons disease and Lyme disease to public attention; however, I still do notthink that we can say with certainty what this correlation implies. PART FIVE SWIMMING AGAINST THE TIDE “Do what you feel in your heart to be right-for you'll be criticized anyway.You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.”— Eleanor RooseveltTRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF A TROUBLE MAKER“First, they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then youwin”. (One of the 10 most famous quotes that no one ever said).Philosopher Thomas Kuhn proposed that scientific communities operate within arigid set of assumptions and therefore are not susceptible to a paradigm shiftwhen confronted by an anomaly. Since the beginning of time, anyone with aradically new idea in the field of science or medicine (or in any field, forthat matter) has been ridiculed and persecuted. It comes with the territory.During the early years of my involvement with MD, when none of my colleaguesbelieved or showed interest in what I was seeing in these unusual patients, Iexperienced times of disillusionment, especially when I heard derogatorycomments about me. In his book Chaos: Making a New Science, James Gleick writes:“Ideas that require people to reorganize their picture of the world provokehostility.” Provoke I did. And hostility surely followed.I was raising my children at the time and they were upset when they would readnegative things about me on the Internet. I was being called a quack and wassaid to be taking advantage of patients or even killing patients with mytreatment methods. My children knew that nothing could be further from thetruth. But they worried, as did Bill Pitt, that I might meet some kind ofterrible fate for sticking to my guns and refusing to accept what I knew to bewrong. I regret that my children had to endure those difficult times but nowthat they are adults they admit that seeing their mother stand up for what shebelieved to be right was a lesson of value that far outweighed any discomfortthey may have experienced.Added to these frustrations was the daunting fact that I was treating a diseasewith no known cause and no accepted treatment. Despite the impediments, I couldnot in good conscience let these patients suffer without trying something,anything to help. Patients signed treatment consent forms indicating that theywere fully aware of the experimental nature of the treatment. These weredesperate people and desperate times call for desperate measures. Every singleone of my MD patients told me that they would gladly try any treatment, even ifit posed a 50% risk of death. They were at a point where all they wanted to dowas get better or die.Of course, all of my treatments were with FDA-approved medications and I nevertried anything that I thought would pose a danger. I followed patients’ lab workmonthly and was available to them around the clock to answer their emails aboutany side effects or problems with the medications. My actions were seen asreckless only because I was not following the standard of care in terms of whatis known as evidenced based medicine (more about this in a following chapter).The medications I was prescribing were not “indicated” for MD. But how couldthey have been? The disease didn’t “exist”!Actually, rather than harming patients, I was saving many patients from thedisastrous consequences of self-medicating with caustic, toxic chemicals.Morgellons patients were doing things like ingesting turpentine and mothballs,dousing their skin in gasoline or lawn fertilizer and putting lighter fluid ontheir lesions and lighting them on fire. These actions were driven by anintense desire for relief but, not surprisingly, were interpreted by the medicalcommunity as more indications of mental instability.Furthermore, I was helping patients by taking care of their basic care needs.Many would no longer see their PCP for check-ups or any other reason becausethey did not want to be lectured about their skin and accused ofself-mutilation. Female MD patients have told me that they have not had papsmears or mammograms for 10 years or more because of their embarrassing andpainful lesions and their desire not to be questioned about them.Treating a “nonexistent” disease with antimicrobials was not highly looked uponby the regulatory boards and health insurance companies balked at the unheard ofcombinations of medications I was prescribing for off-label use. Sometimeshealth insurers refused to pay, leaving patients to suffer, but as long as I sawthat a medication was helping I kept pushing to have it covered. Unfortunately,some patients had no insurance or had a large deductible to meet, obligating meto use a medication combination that did not work as well. To add to theseobstructions, struggling to defend my treatment decisions in order to maintainmy professional license consumed my time, energy and finances and was notsomething that my training had prepared me to do.Even the dermatologists who thought MD might indeed be a physiological conditionwarned me that it was unethical to treat a condition without knowledge of thecause. I would answer, “Then what do you propose we do with these patients?” Iwas told to do nothing until a cause or cure could be discovered. In my opinion,it was unethical to leave these patients to suffer for who-knows-how-many yearswithout trying to help. But I must admit that it was nerve wracking not having aprotocol to follow or an expert to consult.There were days when I wanted to give up. I was beaten down with the criticismsand overwhelmed with the huge responsibility of taking care of these very illpatients without support. It’s tiring to swim against the tide. For moralsupport, I taped the following Dr. Martin Luther King quote to my desk and readit several times during the day when I was in my office. It became my guidingmantra.\"Cowardice asks the question - is it safe?Expediency asks the question - is it politic?Vanity asks the question - is it popular?But conscience asks the question - is it right?And there comes a time when one must take a position That is neither safe, norpolitic, nor popularBut one must take it because it is right.”PSEUDOSCIENCE VERSUS SCIENCE: WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE?Hypotheses are proposed explanations for natural phenomena. The scientificmethod is a process that includes formulating a logical and testable hypothesis,controlling for confounding variables and experimenter bias as much as possible,and executing unbiased testing, the results of which support or do not supportthe hypothesis. (Note that experimental results are not said to prove ordisprove a hypothesis).Pseudoscience, on the other hand, is described as a collection of conjectures ortheories that cannot be accepted or refuted using the scientific method. Thissounds pretty clear-cut but, in reality, there is a fuzzy line between scienceand pseudoscience. No matter how deeply based in logic a hypothesis may be orhow many repeated observations it is based upon, it is not always possible totest it due to ethical or logistical impediments. If testing cannot beperformed, does this mean that a theory is based on pseudoscience? Not necessarily. The ultimate discerning feature between science andpseudoscience, as proposed by Karl Popper, a 20 th -century philosopher ofscience, is whether a hypothesis passes the test for falsifiability . Thisdiscerning criterion is still widely used by scientists today. Falsifiabilitymeans that it is possible to conceive of an argument that could refute theproposed hypothesis. For example, if a hypothesis states that all swans arewhite, the discovery of even one black swan would immediately refute thehypothesis, meaning that the hypothesis passes the test for falsifiability andcannot be considered pseudoscience.It is believed that pseudoscientists promote unfalsifiable theories that theydeclare to be scientifically true. An example of a pseudoscience theory wouldbe: “Morgellons disease has been sent down to us from aliens in outer space toslowly wipe out our planet”. This hypothesis cannot be supported or refuted. However, the hypothesis that Morgellons disease is caused by the Lyme bacteriaBb is not pseudoscience. It is an idea that can be tested and supported orrefuted. Researchers have already taken the first step in testing thishypothesis by showing the presence of Bb in the lesions of MD patients. Asresearch continues, the next step will be a systematic process to support orrefute Bb as the cause of MD.However, even the test for falsifiability does not always make a cleardemarcation between science and pseudoscience. There are many elegant and widelyaccepted theories that have not and cannot pass the test of falsifiability. Oneexample is string theory, a theory that has been accepted and respected bytheoretical physicists. String theory, in the strictest definition, should beconsidered pseudoscience since there is no way to refute the theory using thescientific method. But in the case of string theory, the fact that it islogical, intellectually supported, and widely accepted by experts in the fieldleads to it not being seen as pseudoscience.Quantum theory is a respected theory in the field of physics. However, when theideas of quantum thinking are transposed into medicine (energy healing, forexample) the medical elite routinely labels these ideas as pseudoscience ratherthan showing intellectual curiosity about a possible new paradigm of medicine. Ihave trouble understanding quantum theory and how it relates to medicine myselfbut I do not refute it out of hand. I find it more appropriate to say, “I don’tunderstand it”.As a person who has always been open to new ideas, I take issue with the medicalcommunity hastily labeling new ways of thinking about health as pseudoscience.Many of the new approaches to health care being used by holistic or integrateddoctors are valuable additions to the arsenal of techniques used to diagnose andtreat disease. These new approaches are often based upon nothing more thanrepeated clinical observations and have therefore not been studied using thescientific method. However, repeated clinical observations are not completelywithout merit in the world of scientific inquiry and may, in fact, form thebasis of new testable hypotheses. Just because a theory has not run the gauntletof the scientific method does not necessarily make it pseudoscience.Michael D. Gordon, Ph.D., professor of scientific history at Princeton, writesin his book The Pseudoscience Wars that “individual scientists (as distinct fromthe monolithic ‘scientific community’) designate a doctrine a ‘pseudoscience’only when they perceive themselves to be threatened—not necessarily by the newideas themselves, but by what those ideas represent about the authority ofscience, science’s access to resource or some other broader social trend. If oneis not threatened, there is no need to lash out at the perceived pseudoscience;instead, one continues with one’s work and happily ignores the cranks.”Pseudoscience clearly incites an angry and appalled reaction whereas poorlyexecuted science is simply discounted. Conservative thinkers who do not liketheir worldview challenged incite the backlash to new ideas that threaten thestatus quo. Those of us who are interested in new information that challengescurrent thought are considered to be “on the fringe”. We prefer to think ofourselves as being “on the cutting edge”!The bastion of medical conservancy considers the concept of Morgellons diseaseto be pseudoscience or “fringe medicine” not only because its existence is basedon the observations of a few renegade clinicians and researchers but clearlybecause it seems implausible and illogical within medicine’s current frameworkof understanding.In summary, there is a fine line between what is considered science andpseudoscience. In a textbook sense, a theory may be called pseudoscience if itspremise is not testable. However, the scientific community accepts someuntestable theories. A criterion for defining pseudoscience has never been thata premise is strange, hard-to-believe, or unlikely.So, it appears to come down to this: in practice, an idea is being consideredpseudoscience when: 1. Its premise seems highly unlikely by the medical establishment and 2. The top scientists in the idea’s particular field do not subscribe to it.To assure that Morgellons disease is not viewed as pseudoscience but rather as arespected scientific model of disease it appears that what is needed is: 1. An elegant and logical sounding theory of etiology and pathological mechanisms, that has been tested using the scientific method, and 2. Prominent thinkers in the field of medicine, particularly in the areas of dermatology and psychiatry, embracing and supporting the theory.With meager funds at their disposal, a few devoted researchers are workingtowards #1. This book along with continued awareness campaigns by the CEHMDF anda documentary-in-the-making by Pi Ware (morgellonsmovie.org) are aiming towards#2.In the next chapter, we will discuss skepticism and how it relates to thescientific method. We will see that skepticism, by definition, involves usingthe scientific method to determine the truth or significance of a claim. Neitherscience nor skepticism should involve prejudice or bias of the observer. Theseare emotions, and there is no room for emotion in science.REFUTING THE SKEPTICSWe have come to think of a skeptic as a negative person who will not believeanything unless it is obvious or concrete. Actually, skepticism is defined byBrian Dunning of The Skeptoid as “ the process of finding a supportedconclusion, not the justification of a preconceived conclusion”.The skeptics of Morgellons as a legitimate disease have not gone through theprocess of looking into the research in order to support or refute it. What theyhave exhibited is a knee-jerk reaction to something that sounds implausible.Skepticism should not be about debunking – it should be a rational andthoughtful process that aims for the truth based on testable findings.Since skeptics, in the purest sense of the term, arrive at conclusions throughthe scientific method, they do not see anecdotal information or personalaccounts as valuable to their process. So, the answers I list below to thedoubts I often hear are not going to change the mind of a true skeptic. What Ihope to do is open their minds, so that they may take the time to investigaterather than simply to discredit.The skeptics say…“These patients are delusional! Don’t waste your time with them!”However…I have examined children as young as 9 months old with objective signs ofMorgellons disease. There are no documented cases of delusional 9-month-oldbabies! In a previous chapter, I have described in detail the differencesbetween delusions of parasitosis and MD.The skeptics say…“These lesions are caused by aggressive scratching and picking.”However…The lesions are often seen in places on the back where patients cannot reach toscratch. Furthermore, I have spoken with a gastroenterologist in Boston who hasfound unusual lesions in the colons of 2 different MD patients. He told me thatthe lesions he saw in these patients’ colons were like nothing he has ever seenbefore on colonoscopy. The California gynecologist of another of my MD patientswas amazed to see unusual lesions in the patient’s uterus saying that she hadnever seen anything similar in her 20-year career.The skeptics say…“Those filaments are nothing more than textile threads that are stuck to thelesions!”However…In 2006, forensic scientist Ron Pogue at the Tulsa Police Crime Lab in Oklahomachecked a Morgellons filament sample against known substances in the FederalBureau of Investigation (FBI) national database. The lab's director, Mark Boese,said that the filaments were \"consistent with something that the body may beproducing.\" He added, \"These filaments cannot be manmade and do not come from aplant. This could be a byproduct of a biological organism.\". In fact, recentresearch by Middelveen et al has found the filaments to be composed of thebody’s own proteins collagen and keratin, as described in an earlier chapter.The skeptics say…“The filaments are shoved under the skin by the patient.”However…It would be physically impossible for anyone to implant filaments under theirskin as deeply rooted and difficult to extract as these filaments are.Furthermore, the filaments are found under the skin in places that a patientcannot even reach. (One dermatologist’s answer to this was that the patient’sspouse must have been inserting the filaments!). Moreover, I have spoken with agynecologist in Chicago who has reported removing filaments from the cervixes of2 women with MD and an ophthalmologist in San Francisco has removed filamentsfrom the eyes of one of my MD patients. Another of my MD patients had a lymphnode removed and the pathology report stated there was a red “thread” in thelymph gland. IN SUMMARY, THERE IS TOO MUCH CLINICAL AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR ANYONE TOCONTINUE DOUBTING MORGELLONS AS A PHYSIOLOGICAL DISEASE. IT IS TIME FOR SKEPTICSTO CAST ASIDE THEIR UNSUBSTANTIATED DOUBTS AND PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY SEEAND HEAR.“IN THE FACE OF OBVIOUS PHYSICALABNORMALITIES, SKEPTICISM IS INAPPROPRIATE”(RICHARD SHOEMAKER, M.D.)“EVIDENCED BASED MEDICINE”: WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE FOR IT?The current use of the term “evidence based medicine” means that a treatment hasbeen tested in randomized, controlled trials, using equally matched,double-blinded, placebo-controlled study groups. Evidence-based practice (EBP)is defined by the Institute of Medicine (2001) as the integration of 1.Best-researched evidence, 2. Clinical expertise, and 3. Patient values. Thus,EBP would be in contrast to a medical practice based on tradition, convention,belief, or anecdotal evidence. EBP has become the gold standard to which mostmedical practices aspire.There are those in health care who believe that the medical field has becomeoverly invested in the idea that all procedures and treatments should beevidence based in order to be considered legitimate for clinical use. Theimportance of the 2 nd and 3 rd aspects of EBP – clinical expertise and patientvalues – is being overlooked.There is no doubt that evidence that is based on randomized, double-blinded,placebo-controlled studies is an application of the scientific method at itsfinest. However, this rigorous testing is often not feasible. For one thing, itis sometimes unethical (for example, putting very ill patients in a controlgroup thereby denying them a possible cure). In other incidences, there aresimply too many confounding variables to result in a meaningful outcome.There are many regularly used medications and treatment options that are notevidence based in the sense described above. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA),commonly known as Aspirin (a Bayer trademark), is an over-the-counter painrelief medication that is one of the most commonly used medications in theworld. Often recommended by physicians, ASA has been in use for thousands ofyears and it is used because it has always worked, not because it has beentested according to the principles of evidence-based-medicine. If a treatment iseffective, widely used and appears to do no harm isn’t this evidence enough ofits clinical worth?Eminence Based MedicineIn reality, what is known as “eminence based medicine” often trumps evidencedbased medicine in the world of day-to-day medical practice. Eminence basedmedicine relies on the clinical expertise of respected specialists or those whohave been in practice for many years. In his August 2, 2016 “CardioBrief” columnin the online magazine, MEDPAGE Today, Larry Husten writes:“…..the responsibility for eminence-based medicine goes well beyond the elitecoterie of experts. The real problem is the culture of medicine, which rewardsthe hubris of eminence and actively punishes or offers subtle disincentives toanyone who questions this process. … Medical training is disturbingly similar tomilitary training, where immediate and unreflecting obedience is the goal. …… Inboth, the submission to authority is a central tenet.”Eminence Based Medicine in ActionWhen PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) first came on the market in the late 1980sthey were indicated to inhibit gastric acid secretion for the purpose of healingsevere gastrointestinal reflux and stomach ulcers. This means that the clinicaltrials for PPIs showed efficacy and safety for short-term (approximate 2 week)use of the medication. However, throughout the past 25 years,gastroenterologists have increasingly prescribed PPIs for long-term or permanentuse by patients with heartburn. This use of PPIs is off-label since the drug wasnot indicated to permanently inhibit stomach acid production. Since obstructionof acid production is a convenient and quick fix for patients with heartburn,long-term use of PPIs has become almost standard of care. In fact, it hasfiltered down from the “expertise” of gastroenterologists to the day-to-daypractice of primary care, despite the fact that the use of PPIs on a permanentbasis is not evidenced-based and probably even dangerous.Acid is needed for proper digestion and shutting down acid production for therelatively brief time it takes to heal an ulcer makes sense. Turning acidproduction off permanently does not. Because PPIs were never tested forlong-term use, we do not know how severely malnourished this patient group mayhave become. Furthermore, a search of PubMed.com reveals numerous peer-reviewedarticles regarding the relationship between long-term use of PPIs and stomachcancer. This example of the current clinical use of PPIs demonstrates thatevidenced based medicine is extolled when politic and yet overlooked by expertswhen clinically convenient to do so.Interestingly, alternative practitioners of what the medical establishment calls“fringe” medicine have discovered that about a third of people with heartburnactually have an acid deficit rather than an acid surplus, a condition known ashypochlorhydria. Patients with hypochlorhydria have heartburn because their foodsits undigested in the stomach for too long since the stomach does not containenough acid to propel the food along the digestive tract. When these patientstake hydrochloric acid tablets with their meals, their heartburn disappears. Thedouble blind, placebo-controlled trials are not there – but giving a patienthydrochloric acid is both a diagnosis and a treatment. If it helps, the patienthas hypochlorhydria. Physicians scoff at practitioners who suggest thathypochlorhydria is a rampant problem but no one is watch-guarding thegastroenterologists who abuse PPIs. This is an example of eminence basedmedicine, defined in the tongue-in-cheek, A Skeptic’s Medical Dictionary, as“making the same mistakes with increasing confidence over an impressive numberof years.”In short, the medical establishment derides those who practice medicine that isnot evidence based and considers it malpractice to prescribe treatments in adifferent way or for a different purpose than their FDA designated indication.Clearly, however, this does not reflect what actually goes on in clinicalpractice. My point is that condemning those of us who treat Morgellons patientswith off-label use of antibiotics is hypocritical when off-label use oftreatments takes place in doctors’ offices every day. We may not be fulfillingthe “best-researched evidence” part of the criteria forevidenced-based-practice, but those of us who regularly work with MD patientsare fulfilling the criteria of clinical expertise and patient values.Medical decision-making should be left to the discretion of individual healthcare providers enabling them to make the best decisions for their patients basedon patient needs, situation and response. This is what they have been trained todo. If health care decisions were nothing more than algorithms, we would be ableto go to a Robot for our health care. Likewise, patients should be allowed tochoose among treatment options based upon informed consent.As medical decision-making is increasingly being taken over by insurancecompanies it has become ever more exasperating to practice medicine. But theultimate travesty lies in what is happening to the patients. When their healthcare providers’ hands are tied to provide them with the best care for theirunique case, patients suffer and sometimes die.Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and personalphysician to President George Washington, predicted this medical crisis. In hisintroductory remarks to a course lecture at the University of Pennsylvania onNovember 3, 1801, he listed 24 “causes, which have retarded the progress of ourscience”. The 22 nd cause read:“Conferring exclusive privileges upon bodies of physicians, and forbidding menof equal talents and knowledge, under severe penalties from practicing medicinewithin certain districts of cities and countries. Such institutions, howeversanctioned by ancient charters and names, are the bastiles of our science.”It is unfortunate that Dr. Rush’s brilliant foresight about the dangers inherentin medical elitism did not prompt him to insist on a provision in theDeclaration of Independence to protect patients’ “right to choose.” PART SIX FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS “The important thing is tonot stop questioning.”— Albert EinsteinIS MORGELLONS DISEASE CONTAGIOUS?Whether person-to-person transmission is a concern with Morgellons disease is aquestion that has raised tremendous anxiety in both patients and health careworkers. Most patients report no symptoms in their loved ones despite the factthat they continue to sleep with their spouses and care for their childrenthroughout their illnesses. Sadly, many patients with symptoms of MD have becomehermits, afraid of contaminating their environment or spreading their disease tofriends, family, and even total strangers. I once took care of an MD patient whohad not hugged her own son for 5 years due to her fear of contaminating him.Eighteen percent of my MD patients have reported at least one family member withsymptoms similar to theirs. Patients often ask, “If it is not contagious, why doseveral people in my family have it?” I believe strongly that this is due tocommon exposure to the source of contagion.Most of the patients with close family members who share their symptoms reportthat symptoms started after one of the following situations affecting all familymembers: a lice or flea infestation in the home; common exposure to dirty water;recent return from a 3 rd world country, or camping. It bears noting that I didnot examine subjects’ family members reported as having symptoms and so they maynot have actually had Morgellons disease. I have noticed a tendency for MDpatients to fear and suspect that family members are also infected, despitetheir denial of symptoms.Patients say “I know this is contagious because when I’m in a group of people Inotice everyone close to me begins scratching their nose, eyes, face or head.”Please know that the filaments themselves are not contaminants – think of themas “debris” or byproducts of the infection but they are not infectious agents.However, filaments are sometimes expelled into the air from an MD victim andbecome irritants to those around them. This is why MD patients notice peoplearound them scratching – the filaments are irritating to mucous membranes anddelicate skin. Whenever I see an MD patient in my office I notice that my staffand I feel itchy for 15 to 20 minutes after the patient leaves. However, thissensation subsides as the filaments in the air begin to settle down.In summary, here is what we know so far about contagiousness: Morgellons diseaseis not spread through casual human contact. Sufferers do not need to worry aboutinfecting people who ride the bus with them or friends who accompany them todinner. Whatever the causative pathogen may be, it needs to get underneath theskin to contaminate the victim. Symptoms begin after a bite or other type ofpuncture wound or introduction of contaminated water or dirt into an opening onthe skin such as a non-healed cut or open lesion. Is it sexually transmitted? Wedo not yet know the definitive answer to this question but many patients withsevere disease have continued to have sexual relations with their partner whilethe partner remains asymptomatic.If Morgellons disease were spread by casual contact, I would surely havecontracted it by now. I have examined close to a thousand MD patients since2003, without using any special precautions, and I have not developed thesymptoms, even though I have a personal history of Lyme disease.One of my most difficult tasks is convincing MD patients that people around themare not at risk of contracting their disease. This is very important forpatients to know because human contact is crucial for psychological and physicalwellbeing. Morgellons patients should reach out to others for help and comfortand family and friends should not be afraid to hug and support their loved oneswith MD.SHOULD PATIENTS DISINFECTTHEIR HOMES?Quite a few MD patients report that they spend many hours a day ondecontamination routines, cleaning and disinfecting their homes. They vacuumseveral times per day, change the sheets on their beds daily, wash clothes withscalding hot water and tirelessly scrub and clean. Their personal hygieneroutines are exhaustive too. Patients have told me that they spend 2 to 3 hoursat night performing self-care rituals just to get ready for bed. Many MDpatients are convinced that pests in their environment are causing theirsymptoms and believe that eliminating them is the only way to get well. I havehad patients who are financially able to do so move from place to place to“escape” their torturers .The CEHMDF nurses and I advise patients against doing this. These cleaningrituals do not help and they never have. Furthermore, these routines areexhausting, taking away precious energy and creating stress for a person who istrying to heal. Remember that the fibers and other exudates are not infectiveagents and will not re-infect a patient or contaminate anyone else. The cause ofMD patients’ torment is within them, not around them. ARE PETS VULNERABLE?Many people have reported that their pets have lesions and filaments consistentwith MD. So far we have heard reports of cats, dogs and horses with thecharacteristic lesions and filaments. Since animals are not known to bedelusional, this finding should serve as more evidence that MD is not adelusional disorder.[Image00047.jpg]Image 45: Dog with MD lesions. Photo courtesy of Edward C. RasmussenPeople often wonder what they should do for their pets with this disease.The first step would be to visit a veterinarian and provide him/her withinformation about Morgellons disease. Ask that your pet be tested for Lymedisease. Lyme disease is very rare in cats (although they are vulnerable toother tickborne diseases) but common enough in horses and dogs. If your pet ispositive for Lyme disease the vet will treat with antibiotics and hopefully theantibiotics will help the MD.[Image00048.jpg]Image 46 on previous page: Dog whisker with gelatinous material at the root,similar to what is seen in humans with MD. Photo courtesy of Lee M. LaskowskyWHY ARE SOME PATIENTSSICKER THAN OTHERS?There is a huge range in presentation of MD patients from those with no lesionsand minor symptoms all the way to those who are completely disfigured anddisabled by their disease. No one knows for sure why this is the case. In alldisease states, a weak immune status in the host facilitates more seriousdisease. I assume that this is the case with MD as well. Furthermore, geneticresearch continues to reveal new information about genetic predispositions todifferent types of maladies. In fact, we may even discover that the causativepathogen of Morgellons disease is ubiquitous with only a small segment of the(immune-suppressed and/or genetically susceptible) population vulnerable to itseffects.The worst case I ever saw of MD was a man who needed to take high daily doses ofprednisone in order to manage his autoimmune disease. Prednisone is an immunesuppressant and when taken over a long period of time allows infections of manykinds to go unchecked. This patient had lesions that were 3 to 4 inches indiameter and his response to treatment was minimal. He eventually succumbed tohis autoimmune disease. I have treated other MD patients who were on immunesuppressant medications or had AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). Thesepatients are particularly resistant to treatment. This is why an importantaspect of treatment is doing everything possible to strengthen and relieveburdens from the immune system.DO ALL MORGELLONS DISEASE PATIENTS HAVE LESIONS?As mentioned in the last chapter, MD is highly variable in presentation with theone constant being the presence of sub-dermal filaments. I have examined many MDpatients who have symptoms of biting, stinging, crawling and itching and havefilaments under the skin seen with careful examination but who do NOT havevisible lesions. In a sense, these are the lucky ones because they do not haveto worry about the reaction of people who see them in public. I would guestimatethat about 15 - 20% of my Morgellons patients do not have lesions. And othershave only a few. The reason for this is unknown but is most likely a factor ofthe previously discussed topic – certain people are just more affected by thedisease than others.So, in a word, the answer to the question posed in the title is “no”. Not allMorgellons disease patients have lesions. Again, the filaments are the decidingfactor in a Morgellons disease diagnosis. Unfortunately, some patients whoactually have MD may not even know they have filaments if they have notcarefully examined their skin with lighted magnification.IS MORGELLONS DISEASE FATAL?Since I have been treating Morgellons disease, 10 of my patients have died butthey have not succumbed to the physical illness itself. Most commonly, patientshave accidentally taken too many sedating medications in search of relief oftheir pain, insomnia, and heightened anxiety. In two cases I am sure that thepatients overdosed due to severe cognitive dysfunction and likely forgot thatthey had already taken their sleeping pills and took them again. An 88-year-oldMD patient of mine died of a heart attack and two patients died due to theillness that caused them to have to take immune suppressants (autoimmune diseaseand organ transplant). One died of colon cancer. There are a couple of caseswhere I suspected suicide.I cannot say for certain that MD is never fatal but it would appear that wayfrom what I have seen so far. This would support the notion that the cause isparasitic in nature. As was discussed earlier, bacteria, nematodes, arthropods,worms and fungi can all be parasites but parasitic bacteria are the parasitessuspected in the causation of MD. A parasite does not define the type ofpathogen but merely that the pathogen cannot live without the host. It would becounterproductive for a parasite to intentionally kill its host. PART SEVEN HEALING THE WOUNDED “There are many medicines and cures for all kinds of sick people. But, unlesskind hands are given in service and generous hearts are given in love, I do notthink there can ever be a cure for the terrible sickness of feeling unloved.”— Mother TeresaTHERE IS HOPEPending more understanding of the cause and risk factors, a total cure forMorgellons disease is elusive. Treatment focuses on symptom management and, whena patient is willing (and most are), treatment with experimental combinations ofantibiotics, antifungals, antiparasitics, and anthelminthics. Many have improvedwith treatment but not without enduring temporary symptom intensification andthe need for frequent medication changes due to an apparently uncanny ability ofthe organism to adapt or mutate. Every patient is unique so treatment involvestrial and error and months of frustration for both the patient and thepractitioner.In patients who have had symptoms for less than a year or whose symptoms are notsevere, I see a vast improvement after about a year of treatment. Treatment ofserious or long-lasting cases has taken as long as 6 years. Most patients’recoveries happen somewhere in between the two extremes with an average of 2-3years.All of the MD patients I have treated have improved – the difference is in theamount of improvement and the time it takes to get there. About 5 to 10% of mypatients have become completely asymptomatic after treatment and have stayedthat way for as long as 5 years. The majority of my treated patients are leftwith some residual symptoms but their situation is vastly improved and they areable to function and live a normal life. About 10-15% improve very little. Thesetend to be the patients with the most serious symptoms who have been sick a verylong time or have environmental or psychosocial stresses suppressing theirimmune systems.So, there is definitely hope, and this point should be stressed to every patientwith this disease. Patients have a higher chance of recovery when they arestrictly compliant with the treatment protocol and do everything they can tostrengthen their immune systems (more about this in the chapter on treatment).The difficult part is sticking with the long treatment. It takes a real leap offaith. But those who have beaten the disease say that this is what is needed:faith and a stubborn refusal to give in.SYMPTOM MANAGEMENTThis chapter focuses solely on symptom management rather than treatment methods.The symptoms of MD are so stressful for the patient that relieving them becomesan important part of the overall treatment. Reduction of discomfort and anxietyallows the immune system to function more effectively.These are products that have been successfully used by my patients over theyears.

Validation of patient symptoms is the humane andmedically responsible way to approach every patient encounter. It is the firststep in the process of healing. Patients often walk away from their first visitwith me saying that they already feel better. Likewise, when they leave theoffices of those who treat them with disdain, their symptoms worsen. Stressplays a huge role in disease and a health care provider can immediately relievea patient of the stress of being unheard and disbelieved.Having treated over 900 patients with Morgellons disease since 2003, I have madeobservations that may be of use to other health care providers. The informationthat I provide here is intended for physicians, nurse practitioners, physicianassistants, naturopaths or other health care providers who are able to prescribemedications.My suggestions in this chapter are not based upon controlled research studiesbut rather upon clinical observations with all of the possibilities foruncontrolled variables that this implies. Patients, please do NOT take thesuggestions presented here as a substitute for a visit with your health careprovider. None of these medications should be taken without the carefuloversight of your provider. Taking treatment into your own hands is a dangerousmatter and patients who try this usually do more harm than good.Because of the close association of MD with Lyme disease and other tickborneinfections, it is imperative to test for these infections using a reputable,specialty lab. I use IGeneX, Inc. Laboratory in Palo Alto, California,1-800-832-3200. I have no financial interest in this laboratory. Whenpractitioners read the Lyme Western Blot results they should not pay attentionto the “bottom line” of a positive or negative result. Test results are basedupon criteria for surveillance, NOT diagnosis. It is important that health careproviders be well versed in reading Lyme Western Blots in order to recognize thevarying degree of significance of the different bands. An explanation of how toread a Lyme Western Blot is beyond the scope of this book.Less severe cases of MD have clearing of skin lesions when their underlyinginfections are treated with the appropriate antibiotics or anti-parasitics. Inmore severe cases, or cases where no underlying infections are discovered, theaddition of an anti-helminthic can be beneficial. To be clear, anthelminthics,commonly known as “de-wormers”, are not prescribed because we think that a wormcauses MD! No research has found any indication of this. Medications often workfor purposes other than those for which they were originally intended. AnthelminthicsAnthelminthics that have been used with success are (in order of most to leasteffective) ivermectin, albendazole, praziquantel, and mebendazole. Thiabendazoleis rarely given due to poor patient tolerability and its having been removedfrom the commercial market. However, thiabendazole may be compounded and I havehad a few cases for which its efficacy has been nothing short of miraculous. Theover-the-counter anthelminthic, Pyrantel Pamoate, may be tried but I have rarelyseen it be effective.There are several veterinary anthelminthics that are not available for humanuse, notably moxidentin and fenbendazole. I have known patients to take theseveterinary medications because they are readily available and much lessexpensive than Rx medications. However, this is not advisable since they havenot been cleared for human use, the dosages are not intended for the size of anaverage human and they may contain fillers that are harmful or intolerable.First, Do No HarmA complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, which includes liverfunction tests, are checked monthly and to date, no liver toxicity has beenobserved and side effects are minimal. Rarely, eosinophilia is seen whenpatients are on a high dose anthelminthic. This situation resolves when themedication is withdrawn. This tends to happen more frequently with ivermectinthan with the others. Unfortunately, ivermectin also seems to be the mosteffective of them all.Clinical experience has shown that patients who take probiotics for intestinalhealth as well as milk thistle and alpha lipoic acid for liver protection havefew if any problems. I give a prescription for fluconazole to use as needed foryeast infections. A yeast infection is a signal that the patient is not takingenough probiotics so these should be titrated to individual patient need.Clostridium difficile has never been observed except in one case where thepatient was NOT taking probiotics as advised. Saccharomyces boulardii , abeneficial yeast, is a particularly good probiotic when it comes to avoidingC.difficile.Treatment duration is until resolution of symptoms which can be as little as oneyear and as long as 6 years. Treatments must be changed frequently due to theapparent adaptability of the pathogen. In some patients, resistance to thetreatment method develops as quickly as two weeks. Therefore, frequentfollow-ups and treatment changes are necessary.It is interesting to me that from a clinical standpoint I have not found Lymedisease treatment to be nearly as helpful for MD patients as is the treatmentfor another tickborne infection, Bartonellosis. The best approach to thetreatment of Bartonellosis , and therefore MD, is to give three intracellularantibiotics simultaneously (your prescriber will know what this means) or twointracellular antibiotics and an antiparasitic (like metronidazole, tinidazole,nitazoxanide or atovaquone). I have not found the cell-wall antibiotics (i.e.the penicillins and cephalosporins) to be as effective for MD as they are forLyme disease. Following are examples of combination therapies that have beensuccessful. I have placed them in order of most effective to least effective. Itis best to rotate through these protocols. Each of these may be given with orwithout an anti-helminthic.Clarithromycin and DS sulfa with or without atovaquoneDoxycycline and rifampin with or without nitazoxanideDoxycycline and ciprofloxacin with or without tinidazolePharmacists usually balk at the quantities of anthelminthics that I prescribebecause anthelminthics are usually used for just a few days under normalcircumstances. Although I have patients who have taken them daily for manymonths, I have surprisingly seen no issues with tolerability or toxicity.When I consider patients psychiatrically and cognitively intact, I will givethem prescriptions for the top 3 anthelminthics and instruct them to use justone of them at a time and to change to another when one stops working. Often,2-week cycles of each seem to work best. (Many patients tell me that they noticethat a particular anti-helminthic will cease to be effective after 2 weeks ofconsecutive use).Anti-Virals and AntifungalsFor a few of my Morgellons patients, the addition of an anti-viral or ananti-fungal has been helpful, so it is always worth giving these each aone-month trial. Again, I believe that when these help it is probably due tolowering a viral or fungal burden from the immune system promoting the enhancedfunctioning of the patient’s natural immunity. I do not think that MD is causedby a virus or a fungus nor do any of the researchers.Herbal Adjunctive Treatments1. BLt Microbial Balancer by Researched Nutritionals can be beneficial. I findit to be helpful in treating Bartonellosis and Lyme disease. I usually give thisalong with antibiotics. Researched Nutritionals products need to be purchasedthrough a health care provider who has a contract with the company.2. Try any of the other herbs that target Bartonella infections such as Sidaacuta tincture, Hawthorne tincture, houttuynia powder and EGCg green teaextract. Consult your alternative care practitioner about dosages.3. I have found that a protocol of 5 different Beyond Balance herbal tinctures(listed below) is a good approach for those who will not or cannot takeantibiotics. I usually give herbals along with antibiotics as I have found intickborne disease and Morgellons disease that it is a rare patient who does notneed both to recover.My Beyond Balance protocol for Morgellons disease consists of the following 5products, taken together but not simultaneously: MC-BAR 2; TOX-EASE; TOX-EASEGL; PRONAN; and ENL-TX. Each one should be taken separately in about an ounce ofwater, preferably on an empty stomach. The company supplies dosing instructions.All Beyond Balance products are alcohol and gluten-free and need to be purchasedthrough a health care provider who has a contract with the company. I havenothing to gain personally by suggesting any of these products.General ConsiderationsIn general, there is very high variability to response. What works perfectly forone, won’t work at all for another. It is constant trial and error. Patients’feedback is the most important guide to treatment.Patients need to know that an intensification reaction in early treatment ishighly likely. All symptoms, including the skin symptoms of biting and crawling,will worsen before they improve and there is often a mass exodus of fibers. Insome patients, the intensification reaction is unbearable requiring medicationdosages to be temporarily reduced. Patients need to be aware of this potentialreaction and encouraged to “ride it out”. Those who do, see results sooner thanthose who do not.Images: Next 2 pages: Leg of patient before treatment (Image 47) and legs ofsame patient after treatment (Image 48).[Image00049.jpg][Image00050.jpg] For symptom management, I usually prescribe low dose prescription doxepin atnight to help with sleep and itching. The prescription pregabalin has also beenhelpful for the uncomfortable sensations. It is often beneficial to give ananti-depressant with anti-anxiety properties to help patients cope with thediscomforts and stress of the illness. Anti-psychotic medications are notappropriate except in very rare cases. Other suggestions for symptomatic careare listed in the previous chapter.When patients are compliant, take their medications as directed and maintainregular follow-up appointments, treatment is highly successful. All showimprovement and approximately 10% have total resolution of symptoms. I have somepatients who have now been off of treatment and symptom-free for five years.The patients who do not get well are often the ones who are erratic about takingtheir medications. Unfortunately, there are quite a few of these patients due tothe cognitive and psychiatric disabilities inherent in the illness. It is bestto involve family members and other loved ones in the patient's care so thatthey can assist the patient to be compliant.Any treatment plan must involve uncovering and treating all burdens to thepatient’s immune status. Strengthening the immune system is at least asimportant for healing as is giving bactericidal herbs or prescriptions. Examplesof possible immune challenges follow. There are entire books written about eachof these immune challenges: describing each of the following in detail isbeyond the purview of this book.1. Smoking or exposure to cigarette smoke. Patients must avoid this exposure.2. Living with high stress. Patients should make every effort possible to removestressors and when unable to do this should be in therapy to learn to cope.3. Mold toxicity. Discover if the patient is currently exposed to mold,remediate the situation or remove the patient from the source and detox. Go towww.survivingmold.com [http://www.survivingmold.com] for more information.4. Eating inflammatory foods. Patients on an anti-inflammatory diet will improvefaster. The first thing that must be eliminated is foods containing sugar. Formore information see: www.recipesforrepair.com/lyme-inflammation-diet[http://www.recipesforrepair.com/lyme-inflammation-diet] .5. Occult infection in the sinuses – either bacterial or fungal. Test usingwww.microbiologydx.com [http://www.microbiologydx.com] and treat with compoundedantibiotic or antifungal nasal sprays.6. Food allergies. Uncover what they are with the elimination diet and avoidoffending foods. Removing gluten from the diet is often helpful for allpatients. See www.precisionnutrition.com/elimination-diet[http://www.precisionnutrition.com/elimination-diet]7. Metal toxicity. Testing and treatment by an environmental medicine specialistis necessary.8. Hypercoagulability or “thick blood”. Test and treat.9. GI problems. SIBO (small intestinal bowel overgrowth), which leads to IBS(irritable bowel syndrome) and leaky gut should be identified and treated. Allpatients should be on probiotics. Intestinal parasites may be present in thosewho least expect it. This immune burden should be investigated and treated.Patient should not see a traditional gastrointestinal specialist for this butrather a naturopath or another alternative practitioner who specializes in theseissues.This chapter has provided a superficial look at the treatment of a very complexdisease. Those health care providers interested in knowing more details mayemail me at MorgellonsBook@gmail.com [MorgellonsBook@gmail.com] . I cannotprovide this information directly to patients so patients should ask theirhealth care providers to email me directly.Management of Morgellons disease is demanding, so it is not surprising that eventhose clinicians who believe it to be a physiological illness may not want toaccept the challenge of treating it. There is no set protocol to follow,patients are very ill and sometimes have frightening reactions, a tremendousamount of support and availability to the patient is required, and patients’cognitive dysfunction results in non-compliance and dangerous mistakes infollowing directions. Furthermore, on top of all of the difficulties of actuallytreating these patients, health care providers have to fear for their licensesdue to sanctions by regulatory boards for those treating outside the “standardof care”. The fact that there are so few health care providers willing to takeon MD patients is not difficult to understand.FINAL WORDSThe first step in solving the puzzle of Morgellons disease is acceptance of itas a legitimate entity. Health care providers must avoid the temptation tohastily categorize MD patients as delusional, which is happening in medicaloffices around the world every day. When patients present with unusual symptoms,it is unjust to summarily discount them and relegate them to a psychiatrist’soffice without a thorough and proper history and exam. If health care providerswould take the time and effort to really look at these patients’ skin withilluminated magnification they would be amazed and confounded by the unusualthings they would see.The responsibility for a psychiatric diagnosis should not rest in the hands of aprimary care provider or a dermatologist. The proper procedure is to refer to apsychiatrist but only after every effort has been made to examine a patientcarefully and methodically in order to rule out physiologic abnormalities. Thedistinguishing characteristic of Morgellons disease is the presence ofmicroscopic subcutaneous filaments, which can be visualized by the examiner withlighted magnification using diligence and patience. The dermatologist must atleast make an effort to find the filaments before initiating a psychiatricreferral. These filaments are rarely seen without the assistance ofmagnification.The diagnosis of a delusional disorder is not one that should be made lightly.Once patients are diagnosed as delusional, the label prejudices other healthcare providers against them in a never-ending struggle to be taken seriously. Adelusional diagnosis can lead to alienation of family and friends and loss ofemployment. Furthermore, in some cases, children have been removed from theparent with purported DOP. The despair caused by being disregarded leads toisolation and hopelessness and in some cases, suicide.There are many more “orphan diseases,” as they have come to be known, with“orphan” patients abandoned because they did not have the good fortune to comedown with a known and socially accepted condition. Throughout the history ofmedicine we have seen this patient mistreatment due to ignorance on the part ofthe medical team – patients with tertiary syphilis locked away and put instraight jackets; epileptics believed to be possessed by the devil; gastriculcer patients advised to learn relaxation techniques because they wereinflicting their ailment upon themselves. When patients present with unusual anddifficult-to-believe symptoms, health care providers should make sure they aretreated with the dignity, attention, and respect that they deserve.We are David fighting Goliath in this war for the legitimization of Morgellonsdisease. We are small in numbers but garnering strength from our sense ofpurpose and righteousness. Our tireless drive is to rescue this group ofmarginalized patients who do not have the strength nor the influence to stand upfor themselves. I agree with the late Swedish neurologist, Dr. Ekbom, andstrongly believe that those afflicted with this disease are not and never havebeen delusional. Their only failing has been in misinterpreting their symptomsand explaining them in a way that does not engender acceptance. In this sense,MD patients have been their own worst enemies. Furthermore, in the few caseswhere mental illness is involved, it is clearly a consequence rather than acause of the illness. I would urge that the diagnosis of DOP be abolished fromthe medical lexicon.I will end with one last patient story exposing the tragic loss of a sensitiveyoung man with Morgellons disease. May his story impress upon us the urgency ofcoming to terms with this enigmatic disease.TRAVIS’ STORYTravis had a way with words. A gentle, timid soul, he was not particularly adeptwith people but was expressive and insightful in his many writings. He wasbright, so much so that despite his young age of 22 he often became impatientwith the ineptitude of his fellow humans and the inconsistencies of anirrational world.Why he developed a mysterious disease that consumed him and made him lose hisway is beyond comprehension. “Bug”s, “worms” or things that he couldn’t describeseemed to be infesting his body and his brain, tormenting him with itching,biting and stinging sensations. Strange things were occurring that made no senseto his rational mind: fuzz balls, filaments of different colors and blackpepper-like dots were emanating from his pores and making his skin feel like itwasn’t his own. He couldn’t sleep, he couldn’t concentrate, he couldn’t work orenjoy life in any way. He went from doctor to doctor in desperation, seeking todiscover the cause of his misery, hoping to find a diagnosis to explain hisbizarre symptoms. He hoped that even if none could diagnose his malady, someonemight at least listen, look, and try to understand and help him.Hope slipped away with each succeeding office visit. He appeared pale, thin,anxious, fearful and covered with open sores. Immediate diagnoses of “delusionsof parasitosis”, “self-mutilation” or “methamphetamine abuse” were conferredupon him without a proper history or physical. Health care providers would shaketheir heads in judgmental haste and refer him on to a psychiatrist.Was he crazy? It sure seemed that way. But his craziness didn’t cause theillness. The illness caused the craziness. He became obsessed with every littledetail of his hygiene and of his surroundings. He tirelessly scrutinized everyinch of his body, looking for signs of his invader and hoping to extract theinstruments of his torture. He felt terribly sick emotionally and physically. Hehad to drop out of school and quit his job as a pharmacy technician. The lesionsthat covered his body were an eyesore. He was embarrassed to be seen in publicfor fear that others would think he was contagious or unclean. For over a yearhe stayed locked up in his room, hiding from the world, unable to live a normallife or look forward to a promising future. His only connections to the outsideworld were the web blog that he faithfully maintained and the chat groups he wasa part of.This is an excerpt from one of many emails that Travis sent me during this time:“Since I've had this disease, I've never laughed, I've never felt content orhappy and I've never had a good time. I always think of suicide when I haveMorgellons attacks because of the highly traumatic nature of them. They make mewant to jump out of my skin and just make me feel like I'm in Hell. I've staredinto the abyss for so long that it's not just staring back at me anymore; we'vebecome one single entity. So I’ve said goodbye to the idea of me ever beingable to use my Super-ego or even my Ego. I have become my Id. [In Freudianpsychology the Id is the primitive and instinctive component of personality withsurvival and fulfillment of basic needs the driving forces. The personality of anewborn baby is all “Id”].The turning point for Travis came when he read an article that I wrote about the“mysterious skin condition known as Morgellons disease”. As he read, he gaspedas he recognized every one of his symptoms. For the first time in severalyears, he felt a glimmer of hope. Finally, someone would take him seriously andwould treat him with respect. He came to see me and after a thorough history andexam I informed him that he fit the criteria for this unusual and little-knowndisease, a disease for which there was no test or cure, a disease that, althoughdescribed over 300 years before, was not even recognized by the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) or state health departments.Validation of his illness was a huge step but there were more obstacles toovercome. I explained to Travis that since the causative agent of MD has yet tobe discovered, its treatment is a shot in the dark. The patient must surrenderhimself as lab rat, willingly taking different concoctions of antibiotics thathave been helpful to others with the same affliction, but never knowing whetherhe will be one of the lucky ones who respond. I explained that some patientswith MD, especially those with long-standing illness, have worsening symptomswith treatment. Their condition becomes aggravated and their sensitivitiessharpened. Anxiety peaks, discomfort heightens and the unusual objects flowforth with a vengeance.This was the case with Travis. His response to treatment was such anintensification of symptoms that on several occasions his mother took him to thelocal psychiatric hospital, not knowing how to handle his agitation and hisinability to cope with the pain. If he then stopped treatment his manic episodeswould disappear but the return to baseline was a return to the same lonely lifeof despair. From past experience, I knew that our only hope was to treat withantibiotics, but his reaction to treatment was insupportable so it was difficultto know how to proceed. I believed that his case was too complex for me tohandle, but there were no doctors in the entire country that would know what todo or even take his disease seriously.We seemed to be caught between a rock and a hard place. We’d take one stepforward and two steps back. Meanwhile, other MD patients of mine were havingsymptom flares but getting past them and going on to notice a marked improvementwith antibiotics. But without improvement, there was no hope. Eventually, lifewith pain and fear and without dignity or hope seemed pointless and unbearable.One Sunday afternoon the horror of it all became too much for Travis to bear. Insearch of sleep and pain relief he took what proved to be an excess of sedatingmedications and slipped away from his earthly prison. His mother found him a fewhours later and through the shock and sorrow, she couldn’t help but notice thatit was the first time in several years she had seen a peaceful look on his face.A strange mix of feelings overcame her – the gut-wrenching agony of a motherlosing her only precious son mixed with a sense of relief that his suffering wasfinally over.What happened to Travis should make everyone in the medical field pause andconsider the ways that they treat patients. Patients deserve to be listened toand taken seriously. To confer a hasty psychiatric diagnosis when a patient’ssymptoms seem too unusual to categorize is as much a transgression againsthumanity as it is medical malpractice. Since Travis’ untimely death, other MDpatients have died under similar circumstances – desperately trying to findrelief from suffering to the point of overdose, often by accident andundoubtedly, at times, on purpose.Soon before he died Travis sent me the following email. His words are a sadtestament to modern health care. Patient advocacy should be at the top of everyhealth care provider’s priority list. “Most doctors seem cold and distant and treat patients like something other thanhuman beings. The doctor that I saw in the ER who diagnosed me with DelusionalParasitosis comes to mind the most since he only talked to me for about 2minutes, refused to examine me, and did not care in the slightest about whetherI was doing alright or not. You made me realize that passion for patients’health is not a lost art and this gives me hope”.The tragedy of young Travis’ life and death should serve as an admonition tohealth care providers not to abandon a patient by disregarding his concerns,ignoring his feelings, or discounting his suffering. That is not the way thatanyone would want to be treated nor would anyone tolerate that kind ofdisrespect for someone they love. Unfortunately, there are tens of thousandsmore like Travis. Let us not forsake them; let us devote our time and resourcesto researching this horrific disease so that others may be spared itsdevastating effects.[Image00051.jpg]GLOSSARY OF TERMSAND ACRONYMSAlginate - aka Alginic Acid, is a sugar and a gelling substance.ALS - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, aka Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a type ofmotor neuron disease involving the death of nerve cells that control muscularmovement.Anthelminthic - A type of medication used in the treatment of intestinal wormsor nematodes.Atrophy - v.
