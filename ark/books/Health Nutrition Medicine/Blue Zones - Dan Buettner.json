Never mind that we werein Naha, a high-tech city of 313,000 on the main island in Okinawa, Japan. WhenI gently poked fun at her by saying that I could see she was ready foradventure, she didn’t blush. Instead, she responded with one of her joyous,staccato laughs, wagged a finger at me, and scolded, “I’ll get even with you,Mr. Dan.” But I never saw the pith helmet again.At the time, in the spring of 2000, Sayoko was a young, fast-climbing executivein Tokyo. Her company had brought me to Japan to explore the mystery of humanlongevity, a topic that would likely spark the imagination of a large audience.For more than a decade, I’ve been leading a series of interactive, educationalprojects called “Quests,” in which a team of Internet-linked scientistsinvestigated some of Earth’s great puzzles. Our goal was to engage theimaginations and brainpower of tens of thousands of students who followed ourdaily dispatches on the web. Previous Quests had taken me to Mexico, Russia, andthroughout Africa.I’d first learned about Okinawa’s role in longevity studies a few years earlier,when population studies indicated it was among the places on our planet wherepeople lived the longest, healthiest lives. Somehow Okinawans managed to reachthe age of 100 at a rate up to three times higher than Americans did, suffered afifth the rate of heart disease, and lived about seven good years longer. Whatwere their secrets to good health and long life?I landed in Okinawa with a small film crew, a photographer, three writers, and asatellite technician to keep us connected to about a quarter million schoolkids. We identified gerontologists, demographers, herbalists, shamans, andpriestesses to contact, as well as centenarians themselves, who were livingemblems of Okinawan longevity.Each morning our online audience voted to decide whom we should interview andwhere the team should focus its research. Each night we reported back to theaudience with a variety of dispatches and short videos.Sayoko had brought a team of translators with her, a computer filled withspreadsheets, and an intimidating plan to make sure that our daily reports andvideos were translated into Japanese and transmitted by midnight to Tokyo. Wespent ten hectic days asking questions about life on Okinawa and summing up whatwe found. I met lots of fascinating people, which made me happy. Sayoko made herdeadlines, which made her happy. And when the project was over, her team andmine celebrated with karaoke singing and sake and then parted ways. That wasthat.THE BLUE ZONES QUESTFive years later, I returned to Okinawa with a new team of experts. I’d justwritten a cover story for NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC about the “Secrets of Long Life,”which profiled three areas of the world with concentrations of some of theworld’s longest-lived people—areas we dubbed “Blue Zones.” Demographers hadcoined the term while mapping one of these regions on the island of Sardinia. Weexpanded the term to include other longevity pockets around the world. Okinawastill ranked among those at the top of the list.I was determined to delve deeper into the lifestyle of Okinawans as part of anew online expedition—the Blue Zones Quest. More than a million people a daywould follow our progress online. It was a huge opportunity to make adifference, and I knew we couldn’t miss any deadlines. I decided to track downSayoko.She wasn’t easy to find. I tried her old e-mail address and queried all of myold teammates concerning her whereabouts. I contacted her former boss, who toldme she’d left her high-powered job behind to become a full-time mom. This newsblew me away. By now I expected her to be a senior executive at Sony or Hitachi.Instead, she’d left Tokyo, he said, and moved to the island of Yaku Shima, whereshe lived with her husband, a schoolteacher, and their two children. When Iphoned her, she was ebullient.“Mr. Dan!” she said. “It makes me happy, really, to hear your voice.” I told herabout my new project in Okinawa and said I hoped she could join us.“Dan,” she replied, “you know I loved Quest, and for me it was really somethingquite powerful in my life. But now I have two small children, and I cannot leavethem.”We talked for a few more minutes and then I hung up, disappointed. I’d have tofind someone else. But a few days later, she called me back and abruptlyaccepted the offer. I had no idea why. I was just relieved to have her back onthe team.We set up our Blue Zones headquarters in a traditional guesthouse on the remotenorthern half of Okinawa. I’d recruited a team of scientists, writers, videoproducers, and photographers, and Sayoko had arrived with a team of Japanesetranslators and technicians. Gone was Sayoko’s fashionable expedition wear. Nowshe wore sandals and earth-toned cottons. A few strands of gray streaked herhair, and she exuded calm. But when she opened her computer to a spreadsheet, Icould see she’d lost none of her organizational zeal.“Okay, Mr. Dan, let’s talk about our deadlines.”For the next two weeks, we rarely saw each other face-to-face. During the day,my team gathered information and produced stories. Each night Sayoko’s teamtranslated them and published them to the Web. Since I was waking up about thetime she was going to bed, we saw each other only at dinnertime, when both ofour teams—20 of us—ate together. Our midnight deadline dominated all the dinnerconversation. Sayoko and I never really got around to catching up on ourpersonal lives.LIFE CHANGESMidway through the project, our online audience voted for my team to travel toOgimi, a tiny fishing village, to interview a 104-year-old woman named UshiOkushima. Sayoko and I had visited with her before when I had profiled her in myNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC article. She’d impressed us with her amazing vigor, sayingshe grew most of her food and hosted drinking parties for her friends. Sinceturning 100, she’d somehow become a media darling. It seemed like every majornews organization in the world, including CNN, the Discovery Channel, and theBBC had come to see her.When Sayoko heard about our plans to visit Ushi again, she asked to come along.On the hour-long car ride to Ogimi, we had our first opportunity to really talk.We were sitting in the back seat as the vivid foliage of northern Okinawa zippedby.“You know Dan, Ushi really changed my life,” she began. “I’d been working in thecenter of Tokyo. I’d go from 7:30 in the morning until late at night, five toseven meetings a day, then dinner and karaoke until one or two in the morning.It was hard work, and I loved it. I did a good job. I made lots of money. But mylife lacked something. I felt empty right here.” She brought her hand to herchest.“Dan, you remember,” she recalled, “when we met Ushi I first saw her big smile.You were a man from another country, but she talked to you like a friend. InJapan, we’re usually wary of strangers. Ushi immediately welcomed you. Theatmosphere was like a big hug. You could tell that she made everyone happyaround her—her family, her friends, and now even strangers. And even though shenever even talked to me, I felt a big energy from her.”After our first meeting with Ushi, Sayoko said, she had gone into the street todrink some juice. “I was thinking, ‘This is something for me.’ For the rest ofour trip in Okinawa, I thought of Ushi—the simplicity of her life, how she madepeople around her feel good, how she was not worried about getting something inthe future or sad that she had missed something in the past. Gradually I wasstarting to think, ‘I want to be like her. That is my goal.’“When I returned to Tokyo, I told my boss that I was quitting. My dream hadalways been related to business. But I realized that I was like a horse chasinga carrot. I realized that I wanted to be like Ushi. I thought, ‘How can Iorganize this?’ I called my boyfriend in Yaku Shima and told him I wanted tovisit. I moved to Yaku Shima and learned to cook. A year later, we were married.“When my first child was on the way, my husband and I came back to Okinawa tomeet Ushi again. I wanted her to bless my child. I don’t think she rememberedme. But my baby was born healthy. Now I have two children, and they are my life.No one knows about my career in Tokyo.”By this point, we’d almost reached Ogimi on a road that ran parallel to the sea.“What have you done to be like Ushi?” I asked.“I’ve learned to make my own meals for the family,” Sayoko said. “I put loveinto my food. I care for my husband and my children, the husband comes home, andI have a good family. Also, I try to mentally check to make sure that I haven’thurt anyone, that the people around me are okay. I take time each night to thinkabout the people around me, and think about what I eat, and what is important tome. I also do this during dinner. I take time to reflect. I’m not chasing thecarrot any more.”RETURN TO USHIBy the time we arrived at Ushi’s house, it was mid-afternoon. She lived in atraditional Okinawan wooden house with a few rooms separated by sliding ricepaper doors and tatami mats on the floor. We removed our shoes and steppedinside. Though it is customary to sit on the floor, Ushi sat queen-like andserene on a chair in the middle of the room. When I first met her, she’d beenanonymous. Now she had become a celebrity—a sort of “Dalai Lama” of longevity.Wrapped in a blue kimono, she motioned for us to sit down. So likekindergartners around a teacher, we sat cross-legged at her feet. I noticed thatSayoko, however, barely entered the room. For some reason, she seemed reluctantto get too close to Ushi.By way of greeting, Ushi raised her arms above her head as if to show off herbiceps and shouted, “Genki, genki, genki,” or “Vigor, vigor, vigor!”“What a treasure,” I thought. So many people fear getting older. But if theycould see this vibrant woman, they’d look forward to it. I showed Ushi thephotograph of her in NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. I was beaming with pride that thestory I’d written had made the cover. She looked at it blankly, put it down, andoffered me a piece of candy.I interviewed Ushi again, asking about her garden, her friends, and how thingshad changed in the five years since we’d last visited with her. She’d cut backon gardening some, she said, but had taken a job bagging fruit at a nearbymarket. She still spent much of her day with her grandchildren and the threesurviving women in her circle of friends she’d had since childhood. She stillate a dinner of mostly vegetables and drank a cup of mugwort sake before bed.That was her secret, she told me. “Work hard, drink mugwort sake before bed, andget a good night’s sleep.”As I spoke with Ushi, I caught Sayoko’s eye. She was sitting off to the side,watching my interview. “Sayoko,” I said, conscious of the fact that I wasraising my voice inappropriately, but also figuring that Sayoko was too politeto approach Ushi without being beckoned. “Don’t you want to tell Ushi yourstory?”Sayoko hesitated but then came forward and knelt in front of Ushi. “Five yearsago I came here, and you changed my life,” she said. “Because of you, I decidedto quit my job and get married. I owe you a big debt of thanks.” Sayoko’s eyeswelled up with tears as she spoke. Ushi looked bewildered. She didn’t remembertheir meeting.“Then I came back a few years later,” Sayoko continued. “You touched my bellywhen I was pregnant.” This recollection now sparked recognition. Ushi smiled andthen grabbed Sayoko’s hands. Her thumb caressed Sayoko’s thumb. “You inspiredme, and now I am very happy,” the younger woman said. “I had to come to thankyou.” Speechless, but understanding, Ushi patted Sayoko’s hand. “I share myblessings with you,” she said.On the street outside Ushi’s house, I caught up with Sayoko, who looked dazedbut serene. I asked her what she was thinking. She smiled. “I feel likesomething is a little bit closed,” she said in her own poetic Japanese-tingedEnglish. “I feel complete.”CENTENARIAN WISDOMThis book is about listening to people like Ushi who live in the world’s BlueZones. The world’s healthiest, longest-lived people have many things to teach usabout living longer, richer lives. If wisdom is the sum of knowledge plusexperience, then these individuals possess more wisdom than anyone else.So we’ve packed this book with insights from centenarians about living lifewell. Their stories cover everything from child rearing to learning how to belikable, from getting rich to finding—and keeping—love in your life. From them,we can all learn how to create our own personal Blue Zones and start on the pathto living longer, better lives.When it comes to the science of living longer, however, centenarians can no moretell us how they reached age 100 than a seven-foot man can tell us how he got tobe so tall. They don’t know. Does Ushi’s nightly cup of sake infused withmugwort provide some healthful benefits? Perhaps, but it doesn’t begin toexplain why she doesn’t have cancer or heart problems or why she possesses suchvigor at age 104. The way to learn longevity secrets from people like Ushi is tofind a place where there are many Ushis—to find a culture, a Blue Zone, wherethe proportion of healthy 90 or 100-year-olds to the overall population isunusually high. Then science can kick in.Scientific studies suggest that only about 25 percent of how long we live isdictated by genes, according to famous studies of Danish twins. The other 75percent is determined by our lifestyles and the everyday choices we make. Itfollows that if we optimize our lifestyles, we can maximize our lifeexpectancies within our biological limits.When we first set out to investigate the mysteries of human longevity, we teamedup with demographers and scientists at the National Institute on Aging toidentify pockets around the world where people live the longest, healthiestlives. These are the places where people reach age 100 at rates significantlyhigher, and on average, live longer, healthier lives than Americans do. Theyalso suffer a fraction of the rate of killer diseases that Americans do. Weworked with some of the world’s top longevity experts to distill lifestyles intothe characteristics that could help explain their extraordinary longevity.LONGEVITY LESSONSThis book begins by tackling the realities of aging. What are the chances thatyou will actually reach 100? What promises do supplements, hormone therapies, orgenetic intervention offer? What are some of the scientifically proven ways foryou to increase your years of healthy life?In the following chapters, we’ll take you to the world’s confirmed longevityhotspots, the Blue Zones themselves: the Barbagia region of Sardinia in Italy,Okinawa in Japan, the community of Loma Linda in California, and the NicoyaPeninsula in Costa Rica. In each of these places we’ll encounter a differentculture that has taken its own unique path to longevity. We’ll meet longevityall-stars like Ushi and the experts who study their lifestyles and cultures.We’ll show how history, genes, and time-honored traditions conspire to favoreach population. We’ll tease out the lifestyle components and let scienceexplain why they seem be adding good years to people’s lives.The final chapter boils it all down into nine lessons, a cross-culturaldistillation of the world’s best practices in longevity. This, we believe,amounts to a de facto formula for longevity—the best, most credible informationavailable for adding years to your life and life to your years.Of course this information will do you no good unless you put it into practice.So, leading behavior experts will also offer an action plan to put theselongevity secrets to work in your own life. And here’s the good news: You don’thave to do it all. We present an à la carte menu of sorts. You can pick andchoose the most appealing items, follow our advice for converting items from thelongevity menu into everyday habits, and know that whatever you choose, chancesare you’ll be adding months or years to your life.Encoded in the world’s Blue Zones are centuries—even millennia—of humanexperiences. I believe that it’s no coincidence that the way these people eat,interact with each other, shed stress, heal themselves, avoid disease, and viewtheir world yields them more good years of life. Their cultures have evolvedthis wisdom over time. Just as nature selects for characteristics that favor thesurvival of a species, I believe that these cultures have passed on positivehabits over time in a way that most favors the longevity of their members. Tolearn from them, we need only be open and ready to listen.Sayoko was ready to listen. Her brief time with Ushi led to a transition,helping her change from being a chronically stressed, marginally healthyprofessional to becoming a more serene, physically fit person living a life thatmatches her values.Maybe you’re ready to listen too. Who knows? It may change your life just asprofoundly."},{"pageContent":"1THE TRUTH ABOUT LIVING LONGER"},{"pageContent":"THE TRUTH ABOUT LIVING LONGERYou May Be Missing Out on Ten Good YearsWHEN JUAN PONCE DE LEÓN LANDED ON the northeast coast of Florida on April 2,1513, he was searching, it’s been said, for a Fountain of Youth—a fabled springof water that could bestow everlasting life. Historians now know there was moreto the story. The reason the Spanish explorer set out to investigate lands northof the Bahamas was probably because Spain had reinstated Christopher Columbus’sson Diego as military governor, effectively removing Ponce de León from theoffice. Nevertheless, the legend behind Ponce de León’s voyage stuck.The idea of discovering a magic source of long life still has so much appealtoday, five centuries later, that charlatans and fools perpetuate the sameboneheaded quest, whether it comes disguised as a pill, diet, or medicalprocedure. In an all-out effort to squash the charlatans forever, demographer S.Jay Olshansky of the University of Illinois at Chicago and more than 50 of theworld’s top longevity experts issued a position statement in 2002 that was asblunt as they could fashion it.“Our language on this matter must be unambiguous,” they wrote. “There are nolifestyle changes, surgical procedures, vitamins, antioxidants, hormones, ortechniques of genetic engineering available today that have been demonstrated toinfluence the processes of aging.”The brutal reality about aging is that it has only an accelerator pedal. We haveyet to discover whether a brake exists for people. The name of the game is tokeep from pushing the accelerator pedal so hard that we speed up the agingprocess. The average American, however, by living a fast and furious lifestyle,pushes that accelerator too hard and too much.This book is about discovering the world’s best practices in health andlongevity and putting them to work in our lives. Most of us have more controlover how long we live than we think. In fact, experts say that if we adopted theright lifestyle, we could add at least ten good years and suffer a fraction ofthe diseases that kill us prematurely. This could mean an extra quality decadeof life!To identify the secrets of longevity, our team of demographers, medicalscientists, and journalists went straight to the best sources. We traveled tothe Blue Zones—four of the healthiest corners of the globe—where a remarkablyhigh rate of the longest-living people manage to avoid many of the diseases thatkill Americans. These are the places where people enjoy up to a 3 times betterchance of reaching 100 than we do.In each of the Blue Zones, we used a survey developed in collaboration with theNational Institute on Aging to identify the lifestyle components that helpexplain the area’s longevity—what the inhabitants choose to eat, how muchphysical activity they get, how they socialize, what traditional medicines theyuse, and so forth. We looked for the common denominators—the practices found inall four populations—and came up with what I consider to be a cross-culturaldistillation of the best practices of health, a de facto formula for longevity.Herein lies the premise of The Blue Zones: If you can optimize your lifestyle,you may gain back an extra decade of good life you’d otherwise miss. What’s thebest way to optimize your lifestyle? Emulate the practices we found in each oneof the Blue Zones.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LONGEVITY PIONEERIn 1550, Italian Luigi Cornaro wrote one of the first longevity “best sellers.”His book, The Art of Living Long, said that life could be extend throughpracticing moderation. His book would be translated into French, English, Dutch,and German. Cornaro may have been on to something; sources differ on his exactage, he lived well into his 90s and possibly beyond.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FACTS ABOUT AGINGWhen taken together, the Blue Zones yielded nine powerful lessons to achieve alonger, better life. But before we get into the details, I think it’s crucial tounderstand a few things about just how people age and establish some basicprinciples and definitions. How long can each of us expect to live? What reallyhappens to our bodies when we age? Why can’t we just take a pill to extend ourlives? How can we live longer? How can we live better? And why does changing ourlifestyles add more good years?To answer these and other fundamental questions, I’ve asked some of the world’sexperts to describe their latest research in everyday terms. Together thesescientists represent the best thinking in biology, geriatrics, and the scienceof longevity. Steven N. Austad, Ph.D., studies the cellular and molecular mechanisms of agingat the University of Texas Health Center at San Antonio. A professor at the Samand Ann Barshop Center for Longevity and Aging, he is the author of Why We Age:What Science is Discovering About the Body’s Journey Through Life. Robert N. Butler, M.D., is President and CEO of the International LongevityCenter-U.S.A., a policy and education research center in New York City. Aprofessor of geriatrics and adult development at Mount Sinai Medical Center, heis the author of Why Survive: Being Old in America. Jack M. Guralnik, M.D., Ph.D., is chief of the laboratory of epidemiology,demography, and biometery at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda,Maryland. Robert Kane, M.D., is director of the Center on Aging and the MinnesotaGeriatric Education Center at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. He isa professor in the School of Public Health, where he holds an endowed chair inLong-term Care and Aging. Thomas T. Perls, M.D., M.P.H., is director of the New England Centenarian Study,an associate professor of medicine and geriatrics at the Boston UniversitySchool of Medicine, and author of Living to 100: Lessons in Living to YourMaximum Potential at Any Age. I interviewed each of these experts separately, then sorted the best of theiranswers to each question. Here’s what they told me.WHAT EXACTLY IS AGING?Robert Kane: That is a very profound question. Number one, aging starts atbirth. If you think about it, there is a constant development that occurs withinall species. You can think of it as the balance between the individual and theenvironment. In essence, we can think of aging as a loss of coping mechanism, afailure to be able to maintain internal control and balance.We start out as children, and we gradually accrue various changes in ourcharacteristics. Children are susceptible to the environment and must beprotected. In the case of humans, we probably peak in our mid-20s. We hold ourown for a while, then at some point, perhaps in our mid-40s, we start todecline. Some people would say we actually begin to decline at age 30. Itdepends on the system that you track.image [Images/32.jpg]The skin is often where we first notice the outward signs of the aging process.Old age is another period when the balance favors the environment; older peopleneed help in protecting themselves. The frailty we associate with old age isbasically the loss of autonomy, the inability to withstand external pressuresand perturbations.Aging includes both the positive and negative changes that occur. Agerontologist would define aging as the risk of dying. Irrespective of thepresence of disease, there is, given this finiteness of a life span, acontinuous risk of dying. In most cases this increases as our age increases.Other factors can change your risk of dying as well as aging, so it’s not thataging alone is the determiner, but it is the overarching change. People havebeen searching for biological markers of aging, and so far nobody has found anythat are absolutely constant and separate from the onset of diseases.People look at, for example, the loss of accommodation in the lens of the eye.Most people become farsighted, usually in their early 40s. It doesn’t happen toeveryone, so you can’t say it’s a universal sign of aging. Graying of hair, lossof collagen in the skin, all of these are changes that have been described withregard to aging. There’s a change in body composition as people get older. Itcan obviously be influenced by exercise and diet, but in general, we lose musclemass and gain body fat. The immune system changes with age and becomes lesscompetent, but again, not in any universal way that we can say is acharacteristic of aging. Steven Austad: I would define aging as the gradual loss of physicalcapabilities, whether you’re talking about the ability to run, to think, allthose things. It’s a gradual and progressive loss of physical and mentalabilities, the ability to do things that you previously could do. What it meansis that basically, you’re not designed to maintain your physical integrityforever. Robert Kane: There are several theories about aging. One is that there are genesin your system that turn on and turn off, either to ameliorate or to expediteaging. Another theory is the “Garbage-Dump Syndrome,” which theorizes that youaccumulate toxins as you go along and things happen.But again, the question you have to ask is why does the body accumulate toxins?Well, you probably accumulate toxins because some of the intracellularmechanisms that were working at one point have stopped working. So are thetoxins really a sign of aging or merely a concomitant of some other biologicalprocess that has changed, presumably driven by some genetic clock that existsinside the body? We honestly just don’t know.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PEARLY WHITESA vital part of your digestive system, a bright smile can last a lifetime.Healthy teeth allow us to eat the wide variety of foods found in a balanceddiet, but cavities, ill-fitting dentures, and other oral problems can makechewing painful and may sometimes even lead to eating disorders. Be sure to makeregular dental visits and brushing and flossing a priority to keep your smilehealthy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHAT IS THE AVERAGE AMERICAN LIFESPAN?Robert Kane: I would imagine that a 30-year-old person today has a reasonablechance of living—depending on whether a man or a woman—to his or her late 70s orearly 80s. If you took away major risk factors such as heart disease, cancer,and stroke, you would be adding, I would guess, maybe 5 to 10 years to thatinitial life expectancy. Tom Perls: For most of us, our bodies are like cars built to go 100,000 miles. Afew cars can go 150,000 or more miles with the right genetic makeup. But they dodeteriorate over time, even with the best upkeep. With that deterioration comesfrailty. When you hit a bump in the road, you are less capable of bouncing back.There comes a point, with continued decline, where there’s no bounce back, andthat’s when you pass away.WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF LIVING TO?Jack Guralnik: Well, they are small of course, probably less than one percent.Again, figuring it out depends on what age you currently are. If you’re talkingabout someone at birth, it’s a different estimation than for someone who’salready made it to 80. Also, if you want to consider health status, that plays alarge role. Most people who make it to be centenarians when you look back, theywere quite healthy at 80. Tom Perls: I used to equate living to 100 to picking all five numbers in thelottery: The odds are pretty small. If you have longevity running in your familypaired with good health behaviors, your chances are greater.Centenarians today are the fastest growing segment of our population, partlybecause we’re doing a better job of screening for high blood pressure. That’sone important lottery ball that we don’t need to leave to chance. Now instead offive numbers, it’s down to four.Another one that we’ve pretty much gotten rid of is substantial childhoodmortality. With much better public health measures like cleaner water supplies,more years of education, improved social-economic status, these things are allreducing the number of lottery balls.The best way to think about reaching 100 is: “The older you get, the healthieryou’ve been.”image [Images/36.jpg]Ponce de León’s legendary search for the Fountain of Youth is one of the manytales that illustrate the desire to overcome aging.Steven Austad: The question is—and here’s where I think the best healthpractices are really important—if you live to be 100 years old, what sort of100-year-old are you going to be? Are you going to be bedridden and unable totake care of yourself? Or are you going to be reasonably independent and alert?To me, that’s what the best health practices can really have an impact on.IS THERE A PILL THAT CAN EXTEND LIFE?Robert Kane: There are a lot of nostrums out there. None of them hascredibility. None of them has been even close to rigorously tested, everythingfrom to human growth hormone to antioxidants. Every time anyone has studied themwith any degree of rigor, they do not pan out. That does not mean that some newdiscovery may not be just over the horizon, but at the moment that is probablynot the path.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LEADING KILLERS * Heart Disease: For both U.S. men and women, the leading cause of death * Cancer: The second largest killer of American men and women * Prevention: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advocates practicing a healthy lifestyle and regular medical check-ups and screenings--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just think about it: If antioxidants were so healthful, the whole generationthat grew up eating Twinkies, Wonder Bread, and the like (the kinds of foodsthat are loaded with antioxidants to assure that they had a long shelf life andwould never spoil) should never grow old. Robert Butler: DHEA, human growth hormone, and melatonin are all extremelyquestionable, and are probably ill-advised. Using human growth hormone in humanbeings bulks them up. But it does not just mean more muscle mass. With it cancome hypertrophy of the heart, fluid retention, and other problems. And ofcourse there’s a disease, acromegaly, which is actually characterized by anexcess of human growth hormone. DHEA is what’s for years been called the “junkhormone.” In large quantities in our bodies, it converts to both testosteroneand estrogen. Most of the studies on almost all of these hormones have been veryshort-lived, that is six months to a year. So the long-term effects are not wellknown.The best source of information on hormones is Marc Blackman at the Washington,D.C., Veterans Affairs Medical Center, or Mitchell Harman at the KronosLongevity Research Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. They’ve done the mostsophisticated studies and probably the best ones we presently have on thehormone story.ARE VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS HELPFUL?Robert Butler: Of course you should maintain your basic daily vitaminrequirements. But you shouldn’t get carried away either. Vitamin E was understudy by the National Institute on Aging in the hopes that it would prove to bevery valuable with Alzheimer’s disease. But it was not.So I think, like so many things in nature, it’s a matter of amount, what mightbe called proportionality, or just plain wisdom. People used to think if amultivitamin was good for them, then more of it would be even better, but that’sjust not true, unfortunately.Most vitamin requirements are best achieved by eating six to nine servings offruits and vegetables a day. Very few people do that, so probably the cheapest,least expensive multivitamin you can buy is not a bad idea to help achieve them.If you’re an older man, you should not have a supplement with iron because ironaccumulates in the heart and can lead to a condition called hemosiderosis. Lookon the market for vitamin supplements that do not have iron that are designedspecifically for men.WHAT’S A SMART DIET FOR LONGEVITY?Robert Kane: Eating a reasonable diet makes a lot of sense. Again, it doesn’tmean that I think you have to be a vegetarian. One of the goals to a healthylifestyle is moderation in all things. What one is looking for is moderation,taking in a level of calories that is necessary and balancing those caloriesacross carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Taking in really what you need. Thereare some things we know that are just generally bad. Most fast foods are notnecessarily healthy. We seem to like a lot of the things that are bad for us:salt, sugar, fat. There is something about humans that is inherentlyself-destructive, at least when it comes to eating.The best diet is basically one of moderation. You hear about all these peoplethat live on legumes and plant foods and that’s probably okay, but I don’t thinkit’s necessary. One certainly can metabolize a certain amount of meat, but againit’s a question of are you eating European portions or American portions? Areyou eating meat a couple of times a week, or are you eating it every day for twomeals a day? Are you eating processed meats that are filled with fat? Or are youeating good cuts of fairly lean meat?To me, I just come back to moderation. Assuming that you were in pretty goodshape in your 20s, if you could maintain that weight, you would be in goodshape. The truth is at 20, you could for all sorts of reasons, eat all sorts ofterrible things and maintain that weight, because you were more physicallyactive, because your system was just more resilient. As you get older, you losethat resilience. So you are more susceptible to lifestyle behaviors that can doyou harm than you were when you were younger.WHAT CAN ADD ON MORE GOOD YEARS?Robert Kane: Rather than exercising for the sake of exercising, try to makechanges to your lifestyle. Ride a bicycle instead of driving. Walk to the storeinstead of driving. Use the stairs instead of the elevator. Build that into yourlifestyle. The chances are that you will sustain that behavior for a much longertime.And the name of the game here is sustaining. These things that we try—usuallyafter some cataclysmic event has occurred, and we now want to ward off whatseems to be the more perceptible threat of dying—don’t hold up over the longhaul. We find all sorts of reasons not to do it.The second thing I’d tell you is don’t take up smoking. The biggest threat toimproving our lifestyles has been cigarette smoking. That trumps everythingelse. Once you’re a nonsmoker, I would try to get you to learn to develop amoderate lifestyle in regard to your weight to build into your daily routineenough exercise to keep you going.DOES GOING TO THE GYM HELP?Robert Kane: Exercise has several quite distinct functions. You havecardiovascular exercise, which we describe as aerobic exercise, which increasesyour body’s capacity to process oxygen. That’s where you go out and work reallyhard and raise your heart rate. Swimming would be a good way to get that kind ofexercise.There’s also antigravity exercise. For example, if you’re trying to preventosteoporosis, swimming isn’t the optimal activity, because it doesn’t increasethe strength of your bones. There, working against gravity, walking, standingdoes more to increase bone metabolism than swimming does.image [Images/41.jpg]Frank Shearer first put on water skis in 1939. At age 99, he still enjoys theactivity. “I like the outdoors and the exercise,” he says.Then there are exercises designed to improve your balance. Tai Chi is one peopletalk about, or yoga. Those are exercises that have been associated with reducingthe risk of falls.Then there are strength exercises, which run all the way from weightlifters, whoprobably put themselves into a disadvantageous state from overdeveloping theirmuscles, to people who do some modest amount of weightlifting or antigravityexercise that strengthens their muscles.The data suggest that a moderate level of sustained exercise is quite helpful.There are studies that show that people who run marathons tend to have muchbetter cardiovascular systems than people who don’t. You could say that thatsays more is better, but those exercises generally take a toll on your joints.So marathoners have good cardiovascular systems, but they will probably have tohave their joints replaced. But in general, if somebody could do a minimum of 30minutes—maybe we could raise it to 60—of exercise at least five times a weekthat would help. And it doesn’t appear to have to be all at one time, althoughthat seems to be better. If you did that and you could sustain it, that would begood.HOW CAN WE MAXIMIZE THE GOOD YEARS?Robert Kane: Again, there are two issues here. How long can I live? The otheris: How well can I live? And those are different questions. Living an extra twoyears on life support may not necessarily be your goal. The question is: Can youdelay the onset of disability? “Good years” is a very important concept.There are some things I’d certainly recommend for what people would callsuccessful aging. One of them is, in fact, to have a sense of socialconnectedness. Most people enjoy the company of other people, particularly otherpeople who they feel care about them. That seems to give you a sense of wellbeing, whether that raises your endorphin level or lowers your cortisol level.We don’t know why. People have looked for biological markers, and they haven’tbeen successful at finding them. But something happens that makes life moreworthwhile. The days take on more meaning.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SMOKING & SKINThe most preventable causes of death and disease in the U.S.A. are caused bysmoking tobacco. In addition to the damage done to internal organs, smoking alsoprematurely ages the skin and makes people look older. Recent studies have shownthat a smoker’s skin bears more wrinkles and other signs of premature aging. Thecauses are still under investigation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The other thing that helps a lot of people is doing something they feel iseither interesting or worthwhile. Again, different people have different thingsthey like to do. For instance, people talk about workaholics as being at higherrisk for stress-related illness. But there is no evidence that workaholics arenecessarily a higher risk if they really are enjoying what they’re doing. Ifthey are driven by some externality and feel like they have to earn more money,it creates stress in their lives, which is probably not very healthy. So it’svery individual when it comes to what people want to do.For example, you can’t just say family support is good, because some familysupport is good for some people, and some isn’t for others. There are people whoderive great satisfaction from being with their families. And then there arethose who become very anxious and upset when they are with their families. It isa complex model, which is also very interactive.But if we’re talking about things that give you a sense of fulfillment, a goodlife, the sense of being valued, the sense of being cared for, and the sensethat you are liked—these are all very positive. Tom Perls: A good start to adding more good years to your life would be to getrid of the anti-aging quackery.Some people provide this very pernicious, ugly view of old people that’scompletely false in order to get you worried about getting older. They say theycan stop—and even reverse—aging, claims which are absolutely false. You’ve got abunch of people who are professing to be physicians or scientists, who aresaying that they can stop or reverse the aging process. I will tell you thatreal scientists cannot do such a thing, so what makes the public think thatthese people can?It is mostly hucksterism and charlatanism. They will cost you a lot of money,and these things do not work and, in some instances, can be bad for you. So stayaway from it. These guys are just trying to sell you stuff. What does work isliving the lifestyle of those who we know are living longer, like those people,I suppose, living in the Blue Zones.INTO THE BLUE ZONESWhich brings us back to the Blue Zones project. Over the course of seven years,my team circled the globe, making several trips to each of the four Blue Zonesand meeting the remarkable people who lived there. In each place we confirmedthat people were as old as they said they were, interviewed dozens ofcentenarians, worked with local medical experts, and methodically studied eachof the local lifestyles, habits, and practices.Each Blue Zone revealed its own recipe for longevity, but, as we were todiscover, many of the fundamental ingredients were the same. These commoningredients, our nine lessons of living longer, are deeply embedded in thecultures we studied. I suppose you could say that our quest was for a truefountain of youth, though this fountain does not spring from the ground butcomes to us through centuries of trial and error.For us, it all began on a small island off the coast of Italy."},{"pageContent":"2THE SARDINIAN BLUE ZONE"},{"pageContent":"THE SARDINIAN BLUE ZONEWhere Women Are Strong, Family Comes First,and Health Springs from the Rugged HillsIN OCTOBER 1999, A SLIGHT, BESPECTACLED Italian doctor and medical statisticiannamed Gianni Pes stepped to the podium at an international longevity conferencein Montpellier, France, and presented an astonishing paper. For the previousfive years, he reported, he’d traced the history of 1,000 Sardiniancentenarians, personally examining about 200 of them. During the course of hisresearch, he’d noticed a curious concentration of male centenarians in themountainous Barbagia region, a kidney-shaped area in the administrative districtof Ogliastra. The population there appeared to be the longest-lived in Italy,perhaps even in the world.In one village of 2,500 people, he said, he’d found seven centenarians—astaggering number, given that the ratio for centenarians in the U.S. is roughlyone per 5,000. “All of the demographers attending the meeting were skeptical,”Pes recalls. They remembered all too well the longevity claims made decades agoabout populations in Georgia in the Soviet Union, in Pakistan’s Hunza Valley,and in Ecuador’s Vilcabamba Valley, which had all turned out to be overstatedand based on faulty data. “I had a hard time convincing them,” he recalled.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------RECORD SETTERBorn on February 21, 1875, Jeanne Calment lived for a record-setting 122 years,164 days. Calment, a Frenchwoman, stayed mentally and physically active for mostof her life. She attributed her longevity to port wine, olive oil, and a senseof humor.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Among those in attendance was Dr. Michel Poulain, a Belgian demographer who’ddedicated much of the past 15 years to studying pockets of long-lived peoplesaround the world. Among other things, he’d helped devise a widely acceptedtechnique for verifying ages, which he’d used successfully throughout Europe andparts of Asia.“I did not believe it,” Poulain told me later. “The number of centenarians inSardinia was too high to be true. I suspected misreporting. But someonenominated me to go check it out. As it was, I was traveling to Italy anyway, andso I said OK, I will have a look.”A REPUTATION FOR LONGEVITYBy the time he arrived in Sardinia in January 2000, word had reached the villageof Arzana about its growing reputation as a place with an unusually high numberof centenarians. Residents in the village had organized a ceremony honoring fourof them. “They invited me to participate, but I had no data,” Poulain said. “Icould not publicly confirm that theirs was a long-lived village. I am ascientist, and with no data, no conclusion.But a half hour before the ceremony, I stopped by the city hall and looked atthe birth and death records, and right away I found some preliminary indicationsthat these documents were very accurate. I began to believe Gianni’s findings,and so I participated in the ceremony and decided to go on with a large study toprove the exceptional male longevity in Sardinia.”Three months later, Poulain returned to Sardinia for the first of ten visits tocheck more records and interview centenarians. He visited 40 municipalities toestablish something called the Extreme Longevity Index (ELI). This indexconsidered birth and death records of all centenarians born between 1880 and1900. Little by little, he realized that this region had a phenomenally highindex. As he zeroed in on municipalities that had the greatest numbers oflong-lived people, he circled the area on a map with blue ink—giving rise to theterm “Blue Zone,” which was later adopted by demographers.Four years later, Poulain, Pes, and six colleagues published a paper in thejournal Experimental Gerontology, in which they identified the Barbagia regionas one that had some of the longest-lived people in Sardinia. The Blue Zonephenomenon primarily affected men, they reported. These men appeared to retaintheir vigor and vitality longer than men almost anywhere else. In most developedparts of the world, women centenarians outnumbered men four to one. Here, theratio was one to one.Their study had shown that the geographic distribution of longevity in Sardiniawas not homogeneous. In at least one geographic area, the Barbagia Blue Zone,the probability of becoming a centenarian was higher than in other parts of theisland. This area of extreme longevity was located in a mountainous region thathad been relatively isolated until recent times. “The specific mechanism bywhich persons living in this territory were more likely to reach extremelongevity remains unknown,” the researchers concluded.As a demographer, Poulain’s work was describing populations with data, notjumping to conclusions. Other than pointing out that other areas of extremelongevity existed in mountainous areas, his paper did not attempt to explain whythe inhabitants of this Blue Zone were able to live so long. Unraveling thismystery would require a multidisciplinary approach to the history, diet, andlifestyle of local populations, he believed. Did people in this regionexperience stress? And if so, how did they shed it? Did religion play a role?Traditional medicines? Pure air? Something in the water? Did the Blue Zone holdany secrets that might help the rest of us live longer?BLUE ZONE’S BEGINNINGIn October 2004, National Geographic photographer David McLain and I landed inSassari, a university town near Sardinia’s northwestern coast, to look moredeeply into this Blue Zone’s mystery. Two young Italian journalists, GianlucaColla and Marisa Montebella, went with us to help set up interviews, translate,and handle logistics. Our plan was to interview at least 20 centenarians whopersonified the Blue Zone culture of longevity. From these interviews we woulddistill cultural characteristics, then meet with local experts who could helpexplain why these characteristics might contribute to the extraordinarylongevity on the island.Luckily for us, a Stanford University–trained evolutionary anthropologist namedDr. Paolo Francalacci—“Please, call me Paolo”—was teaching genetics at SassariUniversity. Cutting the image of a dashing young professor in his sporting bluejeans, tweed jacket, shirt open wide at the collar, and longish brown hair theday I met him, he led me through the narrow cobblestone streets of the town ofAlghero, past a large piazza with a fountain and outdoor cafés, to a dimly lit400-year old bar. We sat on benches at a corner table and ordered a couple ofbeers. A man of incandescent intelligence, Francalacci was one of those rareacademics able to explain complex concepts in simple, compelling terms, oftendelivered with an auctioneer’s exuberance and wild gesticulations.He had first become interested in human evolution as a biology student at theUniversity of Pisa, he said. That interest led him to join the laboratory ofrenowned geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza at Stanford, where he studiedhuman populations by looking at their genes. His specialty was analyzingmitochondrial DNA to identify the origins of peoples—dead or alive. He hadexamined mummies found in China’s Taklimakan Desert and revealed that they wereof Indo-European origins, a discovery that had brought him fame.“We have 46 chromosomes, half from our mother and half from our father,” heexplained, hands flying about like those of an orchestra conductor. “That meansthat for each gene we receive two copies, one from each parent, and these twocopies interact. This is not true for two small pieces of our DNA: the Ychromosome, inherited from male to male (the females do not have it), and themitochondrial DNA, inherited from female to female (the males do have it, butthey cannot pass it to their offspring). This peculiarity makes it much easierto trace back the history of a population through the female (in the case ofmitochondrial DNA) or male (Y chromosome) to its founding ancestors. Using DNA,we’ve traced every human being on Earth back to founding female lineages.”Francalacci had used this technique on Sardinians to trace their origins backroughly 14,000 years, he said. At that time, the world was warming after an iceage. As the snows retreated, a small band of genetically related people inIberia began a journey out of the Pyrenees Mountains to the Mediterranean Sea.They followed the coast eastward, through what is today the French Riviera andTuscany, and across the sea to Corsica, where they stayed briefly. Finally theysettled in Sardinia’s coastal foothills.“Eighteen thousand years ago, during the period called the Glacial Maximum,humans could survive in Europe only in two refuges, one in Iberia and one in theBalkans,” he said. With the retreating of the glaciers and warming of theclimate, people started to repopulate Europe. They moved westward from theBalkans and eastward from the Iberian Peninsula. Sardinia was populated almostexclusively by the Iberian wave—people with the M26 lineage of Y chromosome.image [Images/55.jpg]Photographed almost a century ago, this child and three Sardinian women dressedin traditional garb gather outside a doorway in 1913.“This M26 genetic marker is found in 35 percent of the Sardinians today, and isvery rare elsewhere,” Francalacci said. Given the genetic purity of people inthis Blue Zone, he theorized that the first Sardinians did not intermarry muchwith other Mediterranean peoples. They probably survived by hunting, gathering,and fishing. Agriculture came to Sardinia about 6,000 to 7,000 years ago with aNeolithic people from the Levant, where agriculture had been developed at least3,000 years earlier.“Our Y-chromosome data suggests that contact with these people from the Levantwas mainly cultural rather than genetic,” Francalacci said. For that reason, thepeople of Sardinia remain genetically distinct from the rest of Europe. Some oftheir unique traits are negative, such as higher incidences of type 1 diabetesand multiple sclerosis. But others are positive, such as resistance to malariaand high longevity rates, especially among males.When we finished our beers, I needed a break. Interviewing Francalacci was a bitlike witnessing a verbal volcano; I hadn’t had to prompt him at all. He invitedme back to the small rooftop apartment he shared with his lovely Greek wife,Christina. The view from their kitchen window looked out across a jumbledplateau of red clay shingles to the sea.Francalacci popped a disk of Barbagia folk music in his player and the apartmentfilled with the nomadic, faraway sounds of Sardinia’s highlands—shepherds’voices harmonizing to the multi-pipe instrument called launeddas. The musicianplays it by producing a constant airflow by inhaling through his nose andexhaling out his mouth. Francalacci opened a bottle of Sardinian Cannonau redwine, and his animated conversation resumed.During the middle Bronze Age, a tribal culture called the Nuraghic civilization(in a sense, the root culture of the Sardinian Blue Zone) began in Sardinia, hesaid. The Nuraghi people are named after the stone towers found all over theisland.By the time of Christ, other civilizations had also discovered Sardinia’s richesand charms, and for most of its early history the island was knocked around likea rugby ball—invaded, conquered, and exploited by outsiders. The Phoenicians andRomans arrived with their superior military might, taking over the coasts andlowlands of the south. Native Sardinians, who had lived throughout the island,escaped to the hilly central area. By most accounts, the invading barbarianswere nomadic and largely interested in tending their flocks.The etymology and meaning of the word Barbagia derives from the Latin name“Barbaria,” land of the Barbarians. Latins called a foreigner barbarus, from theancient Greek word barbaros, which supposedly mimics the sound of someone tryingto speak Greek. They had no interest in the arduous tasks associated withagriculture, although they possibly learned rudiments of farming from theRomans. “Even if ancient Sardinians knew of farming techniques, it didn’t take,”Francalacci said. “They carried on largely as hunter-gatherers and later asshepherds.”Perhaps that’s why Sardinians developed an intense wariness and disdain forvisitors. Newcomers had always meant subjugation, exploitation, and taxes. Sothey turned inward, developing an intense dedication to their families andcommunity and earning a reputation for toughness. One Barbagia proverb said itall about foreigners: Furat chie benit dae su mare (He who comes from the sea ishere to steal).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SARDINIA FACTS * Nation: Italy * Location: Island located 120 miles west of mainland Italy * Sardinia Population: 1.6 million people--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As the centuries, passed on the island, the isolated native Sardinians evolvedin their own unique environment. Many villages even retained their pre-Romannames. “In this region,” says Francalacci, “the names of the Sardinian villagessuch as Ollolai, Illorai, Irgoli, Ittiri, Orune, to name a few, sound veryexotic to a continental Italian ear like mine.” The region north of Alghero iscalled Nurra, which some linguists think comes from nur, meaning “heap ofstones” in the Nuraghian language. It is also a good description of the nuraghi,the Bronze Age towers found all over Sardinia.The original Sardinians, in fact, did not keep their ancient Nuraghic languages.The Romans had subjugated them long enough that by the time they escaped to themountains they had adopted Latin, which has survived the centuries remarkablyintact. In the Sardinian dialect spoken in the Blue Zone, for example, the wordfor house is still the Latin word domus. Their pronunciation more closelyresembles Latin too. The English word sky is cielo in Italian but it is kelu inSardinian, preserving the hard K sound as it was pronounced in the originalLatin caelum (ka-AY-lum). The same goes for sentence structure. A modern-dayItalian says io bevo vino (I drink wine) but Sardinians would say it as anancient Roman would have, io vino bevo (I wine drink).What does this have to do with longevity? “It suggests that the Sardinians’lifestyle in the Blue Zone hasn’t changed much since the time of Christ,”Francalacci said. “The laws of evolution dictate that a species will not evolvein a comfortable, isolated environment where reproduction is easy. By contrast,a species will evolve quickly in a tough environment where individuals ofdifferent backgrounds and conditions interact. Similarly, in a place like theSardinian Blue Zone, there is less pressure to adapt. The people theremaintained not only their genetic features, but also their economic isolationand traditional social values, such as the respect for elders as a source ofexperience, the importance of the family clan, and the presence of unwrittenlaws—all of which proved to be effective means for avoiding foreign dominationover the centuries.”In other words, the self-imposed isolation of Sardinia created a geneticincubator of sorts, amplifying certain traits and subduing others. Somepreliminary genetic studies, for example, seem to show that the red blood cellsof an unusually high proportion of Blue Zone centenarians are smaller thannormal, providing both a resistance to malaria and a lesser chance of dangerousblood clots. But genetic and cultural isolation go hand in hand, Francalaccisaid, putting down his wine glass and clasping his hands. “When you put the twotogether you get a very interesting result.”Francalacci and I stayed up well past midnight that night and continued ourconversation later via e-mail. Before 1950, I learned, Sardinia had looked morelike a backwater than a centenarian’s Shangri-la. Poor hygiene, poor waterquality, and a scarcity of water led to rampant infectious diseases. Dysentery,plague, tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrhea killed many young Sardinians. AsEnglish traveler William Henry Smyth wrote in his 1828 Sketch of the PresentState of the Island of Sardinia, “it is surprising that with such inconvenientresidences, and uncleanly habits, the natives should remain so generally healthyas they do.”IS IT IN THE GENES?When D.H. Lawrence traveled across Sardinia in 1921 in search of a lifestyle ofsimplicity, he found a Barbagia suited to his imagination. “Here, since endlesscenturies man has tamed the impossible mountainside into terraces, he hasquarried the rock, he has fed his sheep among the thin woods, he has cut hisboughs and burnt his charcoal, he has been half domesticated even among the wildfastnesses. This is what is so attractive…. Life is so primitive, so pagan, sostrangely heathen and half-savage.”Prosperity came to Sardinia after the late 1940s. The Rockefeller Foundationfinanced an effort that wiped out malaria, and a post-war economic boom in Italybrought jobs and paved roads to Barbagia. Along with them came vaccinations,antibiotics, and modernized health care. Only now could the Sardinian BlueZone’s combination of genes and lifestyle work its real magic on the population.Before we left Sassari, photographer David McLain and I picked up a few moreuseful bits of information. Dr. Luca Deiana, a local politician who headed theAkea study, one of the first investigations of Sardinian centenarians (akea is aSardinian greeting that means roughly “may you live to be 100”) pointed us inthe direction of the G6PD gene. A defect on the gene is connected to favism, adisease triggered by consuming fava beans. We know the G6PD gene also protectssome Sardinians from malaria, said geneticist Dr. Antonio Cao, who was himself aposter boy of healthy aging at 78. Diet probably plays an important role, headded. “Barbagia is not like the rest of the Mediterranean. They don’t eat aMediterranean diet.”Dr. Gianni Pes, the scientist who first delivered the Blue Zone data todemographers, also told us that environment and lifestyle might be moreimportant factors than genetics to explain the longevity of Sardinians.“Consider, for instance, the genes of inflammation. We expected to findsomething interesting in Sardinian DNA. We studied several tens of gene variantsrelated to inflammation but we didn’t find any evidence of their role insurvival of Sardinians. The same for genes related to cancer, and those relatedto cardiovascular disease. I suspect that the characteristics of theenvironment, the lifestyle, and the food are by far more important for a healthylife.”Armed with these insights and a backpack full of academic papers, David,Gianluca, Marisa, and I finally left the coast for Sardinia’s Blue Zone. As wedrove into the island’s central highlands, we entered quite another world. Theroad snaked upward through increasingly rocky terrain that showed littleevidence of human impact. Indeed, Sardinia consisted almost entirely ofmountainous terrain as it rose toward the massive Gennargentu range to the east.Except for patches of hardwood forests where blackthorn, yew, oak, and ash treesgrew, and the occasional vineyard, we saw only rough pastureland.image [Images/62.jpg]“My tongue still works perfectly,” says Raffaella Monne, 107. “I can talk alot.”I recalled the many warnings we’d seen or heard about Barbagia. “You might thinktwice about wandering around many of the desolate villages of the interior,especially in Nuoro province,” wrote the author of one guidebook.Our friend Franco Diaz from Cagliari, Sardinia’s largest city, confirmed ourinitial impression of Barbagia as a difficult place where people eke out aliving from a rugged land by raising sheep and goats. The residents there have areputation for kidnapping, stealing, and settling scores at the end of very longknives, he said. “A vendetta can last generations. A son of one family might getshot today for something his father did decades ago.” Franco’s daughter agreed.“If a boy catches you looking at his girl, expect to be confronted,” she warned.“And remember, everyone in Barbagia has a knife in his pocket.”DUELING CENTENARIANSAs we drove into the village of Arzana on a drizzly October day, we saw smokecurling out of chimneys into the lingering mist. Villages at the heart ofSardinia’s Blue Zone—Fonni, Gavoi, Villagrande Strisaili, Talana, andArzana—have evolved over the centuries from clusters of shepherd huts to moderncommunities of a few thousand residents. Most towns still possess a precariouscharm, with ancient whitewashed houses cascading down cobblestone streets. Thestreets of Arzana seemed all but deserted.I could see why residents here might be physically fit. A trip to a friend’shouse or the local market meant a workout more rigorous than a half hour on aStairMaster. But the ominous creep of modernization was easy to see. Cars andtrucks were parked in front of most houses, satellite dishes faced out fromrooftops, and pizza, hamburger, and ice cream shops dotted the main street. Tounlock Sardinia’s longevity secrets, we needed to focus on Barbagia’straditional lifestyle—the one that existed before prosperity arrived in the1950s.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------EQUAL EXERCISEEveryday hikes taken by Sardinian shepherds can burn up to 490 calories an hour;to get the equivalent, try 120 minutes of brisk walking (about 3.5 mph), 90minutes of gardening, 2 hours of bowling, or 120 minutes of golfing (be sure tocarry your bag).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our plan was to track down as many as a dozen Blue Zone centenarians. Everybodyin town knew them, we discovered, and people treated them like celebrities. Ontavern walls, instead of posters of bikinied women or fast cars, you’d seecalendars featuring the “Centenarian of the Month.”All we needed to do was ask a villager where the centenarians lived and ahelpful finger would point out the house. We’d knock on the door, introduceourselves, and invariably be invited in. During the first week, I met 17centenarians—8 men and 9 women. Most centenarians, we discovered, spent theirtime somewhere between their bed and their favorite sitting chair. Their dayswere punctuated by meals with their families and perhaps a stroll to meetfriends. As a rule, they had worked hard their whole lives as farmers orshepherds. Their lives unfolded with daily and seasonal routines. They raisedfamilies who were now caring for them. Their lives were extraordinarilyordinary—with one exception.In Silanus, a village of some 2,400 people on the slope of the GennargentuMountains whose origins date to Nuraghic prehistory, David and I met102-year-old Giuseppe Mura. We stepped out of the hard, hot midday sun into the19th-century whitewashed home Giuseppe shares with his 65-year-old daughterMaria and her family. Inside it was cool and pleasantly damp; it smelled vaguelyof sausages and red wine. Giuseppe sat at the end of an ancient, wooden table,flanked by Maria and his son, Giovanni, who’d stopped by for a visit.Both father and son wore shepherd’s caps, wool suit coats, and black boots—thedaily uniform of the Sardinian peasant. Muted afternoon sunlight sifted throughfinely embroidered, diaphanous curtains. Giuseppe’s eyes caught mine and henodded agreeably.“These men are from America,” Maria shouted in her father’s ear. “They’d like tointerview you for National Geographic magazine.”“What?” He shouted back.“They want to interview you for a magazine article. The National Geographic!”“Fine with me,” Giuseppe snapped. “But if they want money, tell them they can goto hell.”I blanched, but Maria and Giovanni burst out laughing. They understood theirfather’s biting sense of humor, which was, I’d soon learn, characteristicallySardinian. I had some questions that Drs. Paul Costa and Luigi Ferrucci from theNational Institute on Aging had given me to pose to centenarians. They werenonleading questions, carefully crafted to tease out the lifestyle by elicitinga narrative. Instead of asking a man what he ate when he was a child, thequestion would inquire, “Can you think about things you do every day or havedone most days of your life?”I posed my questions to Maria, who translated them for her father. I learnedthat Giuseppe had worked steadily his whole life, first as a farmer, and then asshepherd. He’d usually put in a plodding, 16-hour day tilling the earth orfollowing his sheep into pasture. On most days he came home for lunch, took anap, and then spent an hour or two in the late afternoon with his friends in thevillage square. He’d return to the fields until dark. He never much busiedhimself with raising his eight children. He left that and all other affairs ofthe house to his wife.Giuseppe’s diet consisted largely of fava beans, pecorino cheese, bread, andmeat as he could afford it, which was rarely in the early days. Maria estimatedthat her father drank a liter of Sardinian wine every day of his adult life, andmore during festivals, when he tended to be the life of the party.“Is there anything unusual about Giuseppe’s upbringing?” I asked.Giovanni paused and looked questioningly at Maria. “Yes, there is,” Giovannianswered. “Giuseppe was raised by a single mother. His father got his motherpregnant and then went off to war. When he returned, he took up with anotherwoman and soon got her pregnant too, leaving my father’s mother to have her babyalone.”Giuseppe listened to the story staring down at his folded hands, head hangingdown. I could tell that even though more than a century had passed, the storywas a source of shame for the family.“Well, it looks like Giuseppe turned out all right,” I added hopefully.“Yes,” Giovanni replied. “But there’s more. One Sunday morning, when Giuseppe’sfather was on his way to church with his new wife, Giuseppe’s mother interceptedhim and shot him dead, murdered him right on the church steps. The police puther in jail, but everyone in the village knew that her honor had been violated.The police let her out after only four months.”What happened to the other woman and her child then? I was guessing that lifewas pretty difficult for a single mother in the village in first few years ofthe 20th century.“That’s another story in our village’s lore,” Maria said, taking up the tale.“The other child, Giuseppe’s half brother, was named Raimondo Arca. Giuseppe didnot even know he had a half brother until one day when he was 17 years old andwas playing a Sardinian game with other boys in the village square.“It was a game of elimination,” she continued, “much like rock, paper, andscissors, but the Sardinian version often turns aggressive. Giuseppe andRaimondo found themselves in a final round of elimination when a dispute eruptedand a fistfight ensued.“Raimondo was giving my father a licking when a passing villager who knew thestory of their mothers broke them up saying, ‘Brothers shouldn’t fight.’ Thesecret was out, and once they learned it, they became friends and remained soever since. In fact, Raimondo is still alive and lives right down the street.The whole village celebrated when then two of them turned 100 two years ago.”David and I looked at each other slack-jawed. In the United States only aboutone male in 20,000 reaches age 100. The chances that there would be twocentenarians in the same family is astronomically unlikely, unless of coursetheir father passed down an extraordinary set of genes to both of his sons.The interview continued another 90 minutes. Maria served us wine and cured ham,followed by cups of hot coffee. In the course of our conversation, we learnedthat Giuseppe had a special box where he kept his meager life savings and otherimportant objects that he had collected through his long life. He wore the keyto the box on a string around his neck, which he closely guarded.David, always on the lookout for a telling picture, envisioned a portrait ofGiuseppe with his life’s treasures. He asked Maria if it were possible forGiuseppe to open up the box for us.“Papa,” Maria again shouted in her father’s ear. “These men want to see what’sin your box.”“What?” Giuseppe murmured back.“These men want to see what’s in your treasure box, where you keep your money,”she repeated, this time reaching for the key around his neck and holding it upfor him to see.“You tell those Americans to go to hell,” he shrieked, slapping the key out ofher hand. Spittle shot from his mouth and splattered on the table before me. “Ishow them what’s my box, all right. Right up their nose!”Even though Maria and Giovanni once again laughed at their father’s outburst, wetook this as our cue to leave.WINE GOAT’S MILK AND MASTIC OILThough most centenarians we met were sharp enough to hold a conversation andanswer questions, a majority of them were homebound and under the care of adaughter or granddaughter. What I learned directly from them was limited bytheir imperfect memories.I realized that if I wanted to get a sense of the authentic Sardinian lifestyle,I needed to spend time with someone younger who was still working and living inthe traditional way. I suspected that clues to the extraordinary longevity inthis Blue Zone were the kind I needed to observe rather than hear described inan interview. I figured if I could participate in a day in the life of a trueBarbagian Sardinian I could observe nuances.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FLAVONOIDSSardinian red wine isn’t the only place to find flavonoids. Brightly coloredfruits and vegetables and dark chocolate also contain them. Studies have shownthat a diet high in flavonoids is associated with a reduced incidence of certaincancers and heart disease.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As it happened, photographer David McLain had already met such a person. While Ihad been working my way through interviews in the eastern part of the Blue Zone,David had been canvassing the western part for situations to illustrate ourstory (National Geographic photographers and writers rarely travel together). Hecalled me on the phone one afternoon to say he’d met a 75-year-old shepherd inthe 3,000-year-old village of Silanus who still tended his own sheep, made hisown wine, and lived in a traditional Sardinian home. His name was Tonino Tola,David said, “but I call him ‘The Giant.’”When I caught up with Tonino a week later, he was slaughtering a cow in the shedbehind his house, his arms elbow-deep in the animal’s carcass. A strapping,barrel-chested man, he withdrew his fist from the steaming mess and thenstrongly gripped my hand, vise-like, with a moist, bloodied handshake.“Good morning,” he boomed, then plunged his hands in again, this time to reelout several yards of glistening intestines. It was 9:45 a.m. on a cool Novembermorning. Tonino had been up since 4 and had already pastured his sheep, cutwood, trimmed olive trees, fed his cows, and eviscerated this 18-month-old cowthat was now hanging spread-eagle from the rafters. Members of his familysurrounded him.Tonino’s son and three sons-in-law helped while his daughter cradled hisfive-month-old, wide-eyed grandson, Filippo, who regarded the scene with acooing glee. With rolled-up sleeves and high-water pants, Tonino jumped frompulling cow’s intestines to tickling his grandson with equal exuberance.The men joked as they followed the age-old ritual of reducing the cow to meatfor their family. The butchering was timed for late fall, when coolertemperatures minimize maggot-laying flies and make the meat easier to preserve.The cow would provide meat for two families for the season as well as forseveral friends who would receive gift packages of beef.Butchering cows within city limits was illegal, Tonino told me, but this giantof a man lived by a more traditional Sardinian code. What would happen if thepolice caught him, I asked. “We’ll pay a fine,” Tonino replied breathlessly,addressing a gaping cavity, the insides of which he was scraping with a menacingblade, “or give him a piece of meat.”image [Images/71.jpg]Shepherd Tonino Tola, 75, has climbed the hills of Sardinia for his entire life.Regular physical activity is one reason why Sardinians live so long.Later I was invited into his low-ceilinged kitchen for papassini—a Sardiniancookie made with raisins, almonds, and a jam made from cooked wine (saba).Inside, a small fire from a wood burning stove heated the room. Tonino’s wife,Giovanna, a heavyset woman with quick, intelligent eyes, sat at the table. Sheoffered us wine. (“No thank you” was not an option.) Tonino may have ruled thebutcher shed, but Giovanna ruled the house. I posed questions to Tonino, and sheanswered them.“Tonino lives to work,” she told me, with her husky arms folded, “from earlymorning to late night. Look at him; he’s aching to get back to butchering thecow right now.” Sure enough, Tonino was drumming his fingers impatiently on thetable; his eyebrows arched guiltily when his wife pointed at him. “Meanwhile, Itake care of the house, the children, and the finances. I make sure we don’t runout of money,” she sighed. “He works, I worry.”I asked Tonino and Giovanna both about their past. They often finished eachother’s sentences. Tonino had raised sheep since he was five years old. He andGiovanna married when they were in their early 20s, and they quickly had fourchildren. When their family was young, in the 1950s, they were very poor. Theyate what they produced on their land—mostly bread, cheese, and vegetables(zucchini, tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, and most significantly, fava beans).Meat was at best a weekly affair, boiled on Sunday with pasta and roasted duringfestivals.They usually (Giovanna made the call) sold their animals to buy grain staples,from which they made their pastas and traditional breads—the flat, squarishpistoccu made with barley or bran flour and potatoes, and the famous lined,paper-thin carta da musica (also known as pane carasau) named for itsresemblance to sheet music. Sheep and goat milk products contributed most of theprotein. Their small vineyard grew Cannonau grapes for wine.Their diet was fairly typical of families in the region before theAmerican-style food culture arrived, as surveys from before the 1940s revealed.“Shepherds and peasants in Sardinia have an exceptionally simple diet, which isextraordinarily lean even by Mediterranean standards,” a 1941 survey reported.“Bread is by far the main food. Peasants leave early in the morning to thefields with a kilogram of bread in their saddlebag…. At noon their meal consistsonly of bread, with some cheese among wealthier families, while the majority ofthe workers are satisfied with an onion, a little fennel, or a bunch ofravanelli. At dinner, the reunited family eats a single meal consisting of avegetable soup (minestrone) to which the richest add some pasta. In most areas,families ate meat only once a week, on Sunday. In 26 of 71 municipalitiessurveyed, meat is a luxury eaten only during festivals, not more than twice amonth. Interestingly for a Mediterranean culture, fish did not figureprominently into the diet.”The report went on to say that shepherds drank wine daily. “In the fields, somepeasants drink wine; most of them drink wine only at the evening meal, and nomore than a quarter bottle.” The region’s Cannonau grapes endured the harshSardinian sun by producing more red pigment to protect from the ultravioletrays. These grapes traditionally were allowed to macerate longer than in anyother part of the island during winemaking. The result was a red wine with twoto three times the level of artery-scrubbing flavonoids than other wines.Goat’s milk and mastic oil may be Sardinia’s other two longevity elixirs.Research at the University of Sassari is looking at the question of whetherproteins and fatty acids in Sardinian goat milk may help protect people from thetypical diseases of aging such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease.Mastic oil (with its antibacterial and anti-mutagenic properties) was used insome parts of Sardinia in place of olive oil.Back at Tonino’s house, we washed down a dozen cookies with a few glasses ofwine. After a sedentary hour, Tonino could take it no more and erupted out ofhis seat. Almost every day for the past 70 years, he had walked or ridden hisdonkey the 5-mile journey to tend his sheep on his family’s mountaintop pasture.But today, because he invited me, we would drive.The road snaked up several hundred feet through forests and around tight curvesand many unprotected drop-offs that promised a quick death. In America such aroad would be illegal—or at least labeled “dangerous.” Here it was business asusual.We stopped at a high plateau fenced in by an ancient rock wall where 200 sheephad gnawed vegetation down to nubs. At the highest point of the pasture, ateepee-shaped rock-and-stick structure called a pinnetta commanded a 360-degreeview of the property. In this structure, the likes of which dated back to theBronze Age, Tonino slept with his sheep most summer nights. At the moment,though, he was looking jaunty in his leather spats, shepherd’s cap, and ridingcoat as he strode through a narrow opening in a stonewall, counting his sheep asthey followed him.When three sheep tried to squeeze through, they knocked over a section of thewall. With disquieting ease, Tonino hoisted the heavy rocks back into place.Then he leaned back on a rock outcropping and assumed the age-old role ofsentinel, cutting a distinguished profile against the emerald green plainsbelow.“Do you ever get bored?” I asked impulsively. Before the words left my mouth, Irealized I’d uttered a heresy. Tonino swung around and pointed at me, driedblood still rimming his fingernail. “I’ve loved living here every day of mylife,” he boomed. After a pause, he continued. “I love my animals and takingcare of them. We don’t really need the cow that I butchered today. Half of themeat will go to my son, and most of the other half we’ll share with ourneighbors. But without the animals and the work it takes to raise them, I wouldbe sitting in my house doing nothing; I would have little purpose in life. WhenI think of them, I think of my children. I like it when my kids come home andthey find something here that I have produced.”THE POWER OF LOVING?From everything I had seen in this Blue Zone, Tonino’s values were also those ofthe region’s population in general. People here possessed a reverence forfamily. Perhaps it had something to do with their historic isolation, surroundedas they were by hostile outsiders; they had to depend on one another. All thecentenarians I met told me la famiglia was the most important thing in theirlives—their purpose in life.In America, seniors tend to live apart from their children and grandchildren,often sent off to retirement homes when they become unable to care forthemselves. But that rarely happened here. A combination of family duty,community pressure, and genuine affection for elders kept centenarians withtheir families until death. This gave people over 80 a huge advantage: Theyreceived immediate care when injured or ill, and perhaps most significantly,felt loved and a sense of belonging. A happy by-product was that grandparentsstayed involved in children’s lives.Maria Angelica Sale and her family were a perfect example of this. I met Maria,called Nona by her family, in Gavoi, one of the island’s highest villages. Shewas sitting in her living room, a clean, well-lighted place with embroideredtablecloths, colorful carpets, and a large window that looked out onto thestreet. Her 60-year-old daughter, Pietrina, served me coffee and translated myquestions from Italian into Sardinian, the only language most of thecentenarians speak.Maria had raised her four daughters, survived life under the Fascists, andworked alongside her husband from 4 a.m. to dusk. When her husband died, shemoved in with her daughter at age 54. Then she helped raise her grandchildren,cooking food, cleaning house, and, until just two years ago, knitting theirclothes.On the day of my visit, Maria seemed subdued. Mostly blind, deaf, and unable towalk by herself, she was confined to a chair. But she was lucid, serene, andexuded a certain feeling of satisfaction with her life. Her gray hair was pulledback in a bun, revealing the soft wrinkles in her face. Leaning forward slightlyto hear my questions, she would then sit back and seem to savor the memoriesthey sparked before answering with a smile. The whole time, Maria’s daughterheld her mother’s hands, which lay folded in her lap.I asked Pietrina how her mother had managed to live so long, and she gave me aone-word answer: grandchildren. “It’s about loving and being loved,” she said.“Not only has Nona helped raise the children, but she has also always told themthey must get educated. Sometimes she gives them money, and she always prays forthem. In return the children have felt this love and have returned it. They knowthat Nona expects them to succeed, so they try harder.”Two years ago, when she was at age 100, Nona got very sick. “She was in bed fordays,” said Pietrina. “I thought she was going to die, so I called the family.Everyone came—4 daughters and 13 grandchildren—many of whom traveled back fromthe mainland. On the day we thought she was going to die, everyone had gatheredaround the bed to say goodbye. We didn’t actually think she could hear us. Butwhen my nephew, who was a failing student, leaned over to say how much he wasgoing to miss her, Nona opened her eyes and said, ‘I’m not going anywhere untilyou’re done with the university.’ Nona got better and my nephew went back andgraduated.”It would be hard to overestimate the importance of family in the Blue Zone.According to Dr. Luca Deiana, who has studied centenarians for more than adecade, some 95 percent of those who live to 100 in Barbagia do so because theyhave a daughter or granddaughter to care for them. Grandparents provide love,childcare, financial help, wisdom, expectations, and motivation to perpetuatetraditions and push children to succeed. This may add up to healthier, betteradjusted, and longer-lived children, and it seems to certainly give thepopulation a healthy bump in longevity.“SARDONIC” IS RIGHTBut what is it about men in the Sardinian Blue Zone? Statistically, their storyis the most extraordinary. In the Blue Zone, 47 men and 44 women lived pasttheir 100th birthdays in a population of 17,865 born between 1880 and 1900—arate of centenarians that exceeds America’s by about a factor of 30. If theratio of men to women among Sardinian centenarians was typical, the regionshould have produced only 10 male centenarians during the period. But it didn’t.So why are men so extraordinarily long-lived here and not women?Perhaps it has something to do with the different burdens they carry. The menwere “quiet, and kind, and sensitive to the natural flow of life, and quitewithout airs,” D. H. Lawrence observed, while women had “dangerous and hardassurance as they strode along so blaring. I would not like to tackle one ofthem.”Sardinian men seem to possess a temperament that enables them to shed stress.They are at once grumpy and likable, and often joke at the expense of oneanother. (It’s probably no coincidence that the word sardonic has its roots onthis island.) The things they have in common, according to physician Gianni Pes,are strong will, high self-esteem, and great stubbornness. “This is actually thenational character of Sardinian men,” he says, “and may well explain theirsuccess in surviving in unfavorable circumstances.”In Talana, one of five whitewashed villages that hang along Barbagia’s coastalmountains like a string of pearls, Marisa and I met a 90-year-old shepherd namedSebastiano Murru. We had heard about his extraordinary vigor and had spent anafternoon searching for him. Early in the evening someone pointed him out to usstanding at a bar with a half dozen friends, all much younger. He was wearing ashepherd’s cap, tweed blazer, and black work boots. Though short in stature, hehad an erect posture and his sly smile gave him a commanding presence. “Are youSebastiano Murru?” Marisa asked, approaching him tentatively.“I don’t know. I was too young to remember when they named me,” he repliedmatter-of-factly. Sebastiano’s friends all laughed.Then she asked how old he was.“Sixteen,” he responded, smirking. His friends erupted in laughter.We noticed an empty beer glass in front of him, and asked him if he drinks. “No,my doctor told me not to drink. Especially not milk.” He accepted a beer anywayand toasted my health. He was standing next to Marisa, who was 39 andattractive, so I returned the toast, recalling Groucho Marx: “May you alwaysfeel as young as the woman you’re with.” He looked at Marisa, examined her fromhead to toe and rejoined, “Do I look like a cradle robber?”HUMBLED BY A HUNDRED-YEAR-OLDAt 103, Giovanni Sannai was good-natured, but lacked the edge. He lived alone insmall house close to his son in the village of Orosei. He received us at hiskitchen table, where he greeted us with open arms and a tumbler of wine—which heinsisted we drink with him. It was 9:30 in the morning.image [Images/80.jpg]Giovanni Sannai, 103, sits at the head of the table surrounded by his extendedfamily.With his husky frame and full head of graying hair, he projected the image of aman 30 years younger. He had an easy smile that made us feel sincerely welcome.I interviewed him for about two hours, during which time about a dozen neighborsstopped in to say hello. He greeted each of them with the same smile and tumblerof wine. Soon we had an audience.He had an inexplicable quality that made you want to be around him; he wasinteresting and interested and up for new experiences. At one point, after hetold me how strong he used to be, I gamely challenged him to an arm wrestle. Heaccepted. His friends surrounded us. I figured I’d just let him win. After all,I was 60 years younger.I clasped his thick hand, fixed his gaze, and easily got the jump, taking hishand off-center. But it was a trick. He held my arm at about a 45-degree anglefor several long moments until I tired and let up. Then he slammed my arm downon his side of the table. I couldn’t have won if I had wanted to. Everyonelaughed.He confirmed many of the same things other centenarians had told me. He drankgoat’s milk for breakfast, walked at least six miles a day, and loved to work.For most of his life, he woke early and spent his day in the pastures. In thewinter months, from November to April, he would herd his sheep over 100 miles tograssier lowland pastures. He made these journeys on foot, sleeping in pinnettasat night and eating only carta da musica bread, pecorino cheese, wine, sheep’smilk, and the occasional roasted lamb—which they could obtain along the way.When I asked if he’d ever been stressed in his life, he looked flummoxed. Iasked the question in a different way.“Sometimes, but my wife was in charge of the house, and I was in charge of thefield,” he said. “What’s there to worry about in the field?” Then he added,“Mostly I’ve always tried to remember that when you get good things from life,enjoy them, because they won’t be there forever.”Gianni’s words were poignantly prescient. Sardinians today have already taken onmany of the trappings of modern life. Mechanization and technology have replacedlong hours and hard work; cars and trucks have eliminated much of the need towalk long distances; a culture disseminated by television is replacing the onethat put the emphasis on family and community; and junk foods are replacing thewhole-grain breads and fresh vegetables traditionally consumed here. Youngpeople are fatter, less inclined to follow tradition, and more outwardly focused(which also could lead to a dilution of this amazing gene pool). In 1960, almostno one in Sardinia’s Blue Zone was overweight. Now 15 percent of adolescentsare. The most important and unique longevity factors have disappeared or aredisappearing quickly from residents’ everyday lives.SARDINIA’S LONGEVITY SECRETSSo what was the secret to longevity in Sardinia? Did it begin in the Bronze Age,when islanders retreated into the mountains, turned inward, intermarried, anddeveloped a strong allegiance to community and family? Did that explain theirtraditional social values, such as the sense of hospitality, the importance ofthe family clan, the presence of unwritten laws, which were developed over thecenturies? Perhaps their self-imposed isolation had created a genetic incubatorof sorts that amplified certain traits and subdued others over the generationsin a combination that favored longevity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------GOAT’S MILKWhen compared to cow’s milk, goat’s milk delivers a powerful nutritional punch:One glass contains 13 percent more calcium, 25 percent more vitamin B6, 47percent more vitamin A, 134 percent more potassium, and 3 times more niacin.Results of a 2007 University of Granada study found that it may also be betterat preventing iron deficiencies and mineral losses in bones.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gianni Pes thinks it might be something that Sardinians get, of all things, fromgoat’s milk and cheese. He wrote to me recently to tell me that he’s found aplant, Sardinian dwarf curry, that grows on the slopes of the GennargentuMountains and around the village of Arzana. An anti-inflammatory andbactericidal substance has been recently extracted from this plant.“It represents one of the natural molecules of greatest interest as a newanti-tumor and anti-AIDS drug,” Pes wrote. “It’s also one of the most powerfulanti-inflammatory drugs ever found. During my recent trip to Ogliastra, I spoketo a guy who told me that sheep do not eat this kind of plant, while goats do.Therefore one may ask whether goat’s milk in this region is richer in arzanol,thus acquiring anti-inflammatory properties.”The region’s unique geographic properties certainly provide a piece of thepuzzle too. The Blue Zone’s rocky, sun-beaten terrain, cut by deep valleys, wasnot suited for large-scale farming. So over the centuries, shepherding offeredthe best profession. The work was neither stressful nor strenuous, but it didrequire miles and miles of walking a day. (Walking five miles a day or moreprovides the type of low-intensity exercise that yields all the cardiovascularbenefits you might expect, but it also has a positive effect on muscles andbones—without the joint-pounding damage caused by running marathons ortriathlons.) Indeed. Sardinian male centenarians seemed to avoid bone loss andfractures. One Italian study has shown that Sardinian centenarians reported lessthan half as many fractures as the average Italian centenarian.Meanwhile, Sardinian wives were more sedentary. Women here tended to stay homecaring for children, doing home repairs, managing household finances, andworrying about their husband’s safety. Unlike marriages in many Mediterraneancultures, Sardinian women wore the pants. They bore more than their share of themarital stress load, which, perhaps, enabled their husbands to live longer.The Sardinian diet was lean and largely plant-based with an emphasis on beans,whole wheat, and garden vegetables, often washed down with flavonoid-richCannonau wine. Goat’s milk and mastic oil, common in the diet 30 years ago, mayalso have provided powerful compounds.Finally, for me, Sardinia’s most important longevity secret lies in the uniqueoutlook and perspective of its people. Their hardship-tempered sense of humor,which may seem caustic and persnickety to outsiders, helps them shed stress anddiffuse feuds before they the start. Their fanatic zeal for their families hasalways protected them from a historically hostile world by providing cooperationin times of difficulty.Consider the virtuous circle Tonino set up for himself: the relentlessdedication to his family, the lifelong drive to work, and how those habitsyielded protean health and robust vitality in his eighth decade. Remember alsohis capacity to take a few moments each day to admire the view of the islandform his pastureland perch—though he’s seen the same vista nearly every day foralmost 80 years. How often do our hard-pressed lives allow us to take the timeto appreciate the subtle beauty around us? Sardinians have the presence of mindto savor what they have—and perhaps they are calmed by this.A final and subtle, yet powerful, Sardinian attribute is their positive attitudetoward elders. In America, being young is celebrated, and growing old is oftendreaded. I have heard that most seniors polled said they’d rather die than beput in an assisted living facility. But in America, we are increasingly havingto care for our seniors outside the family: People over 65 in the U.S. will needlong-term care for an average of three years, and more than a third of them willnot rely on help from family.There are no long-term care facilities in the Sardinian Blue Zone. There,respect increases with age. Younger generations feel an affectionate debt to theparents and grandparents who raised them. All but one of the 50 or socentenarians I interviewed had a daughter or granddaughter who actively caredfor them. Remember Giuseppe? After the second time he suggested that David and I“go to hell,” I gingerly commented to his daughter Maria that perhaps he’d bebetter off in a retirement home. “That would dishonor my family!” she retortedsternly. “Moreover, he would not be happy there.”Is there a connection between respecting elders and longevity? Absolutely.Seniors who live at home are more likely to get better care and remain engaged.In Sardinia, they are expected to help with childcare and contribute to thefunctioning of the household. They have strong self-esteem and a clear purpose.They love, and they are loved. And as we shall see in forthcoming chapters,purpose and love are essential ingredients in all Blue Zone recipes forlongevity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SARDINIA’S BLUE ZONE LESSONSTo live like a Sardinian centenarian, try the following practices.Eat a lean, plant-based diet accented with meat.The classic Sardinian diet consists of whole-grain bread, beans, gardenvegetables, fruits, and, in some parts of the island, mastic oil. Sardiniansalso traditionally eat pecorino cheese made from grass-fed sheep, whose cheeseis high in omega-3 fatty acids. Meat is largely reserved for Sundays and specialoccasions.Put family first.Sardinia’s strong family values help assure that every member of the family iscared for. People who live in strong, healthy families suffer lower rates ofdepression, suicide, and stress.Drink goat’s milk.A glass of goat’s milk contains components that might help protect againstinflammatory diseases of aging such as heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease.Celebrate elders.Grandparents can provide love, childcare, financial help, wisdom, andexpectations/motivation to perpetuate traditions and push children to succeed intheir lives. This may all add up to healthier, better adjusted, and longer-livedchildren. It may give the overall population a life expectancy bump.Take a walk.Walking five miles a day or more as Sardinian shepherds do provides all thecardiovascular benefits you might expect, and also has a positive effect onmuscle and bone metabolism without the joint-pounding of running marathons ortriathlons.Drink a glass or two of red wine daily.Tonino, Sebastiano, and Giovanni all drank wine moderately. Cannonau wine hastwo to three times the level of artery-scrubbing flavonoids as other wines.Moderate wine consumption may help explain the lower levels of stress among men.Laugh with friends.Men in this Blue Zone are famous for their sardonic sense of humor. They gatherin the street each afternoon to laugh with and at each other. Laughter reducesstress, which can lower one’s risk of cardiovascular disease.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"3THE BLUE ZONE IN OKINAWA"},{"pageContent":"THE BLUE ZONE IN OKINAWASunshine, Spirituality, and Sweet PotatoesTHE SIMPLEST WAY TO IMAGINE OKINAWA is to envision it as a Japanese Hawaii—anexotic laid-back group of islands with a warm, temperate climate, palm trees,and sugar-sand beaches hemming a turquoise sea, where the cities ping and humwith an electronic din, and a favorite dish is a SPAM-and-vegetable stir-fry.For nearly a millennium, this Pacific archipelago nearly 1,000 miles from Tokyohas maintained a reputation for nurturing extreme longevity. Reports fromChinese expeditions referred to these tiny islands as the land of the immortals.Despite the ensuing years of Chinese, and then Japanese, domination, adevastating world war, famines, and typhoons, Okinawa can still claim to be hometo some of the world’s longest-lived people.In February 2005, I made my second journey to the Okinawan Blue Zone to researcha story for National Geographic. I’d used Okinawa’s incredible profile oflongevity to convince the editors that there were indeed pockets of longevityaround the world. In Okinawa people enjoy what may be the highest lifeexpectancy (in 2000 figures that worked out to be 78 years for men and 86 yearsfor women), the most years of healthy life (the Japanese have the greatestnumber of disability-free years at 72.3 for men; 77.7 for women), and one of thehighest centenarian ratios (about as high as 5 per 10,000). They suffer fromdiseases that kill Americans, but at much lower rates: a fifth the rate ofcardiovascular disease, a fourth the rate of breast and prostate cancer, and athird the rate of dementia.The economic impact of cardiovascular disease on the U.S. health care systemcontinues to grow as the population ages. The cost of heart disease and strokein the United States has been estimated at $432 billion for 2007, includinghealth care expenditures and lost productivity. Imagine how much America mightsave if we could bring our heart disease rates down to those of Okinawa.Since lifestyle, not genes, is the chief determinant of how long we live, Iargued that the Okinawan Blue Zone offered the world’s best practices in healthand longevity. During my first trip in 2000, I spent time with 13 centenariansand heard their stories. They seemed to eat lots of vegetables and possessed astrong connection to their ancestors. Many were prodigious gardeners, going intothe fields every morning and returning with tasty greens and tubers in theafternoon. But did any of this explain their extraordinary longevity?This time, I intended to take a closer look. I’d use a survey developed by theNational Institute on Aging to systematically interview another few dozenOkinawans in search of common lifestyle characteristics. And I’d consult withscientists to find out how those characteristics connected to longevity. Dr.Greg Plotnikoff, one of those experts, agreed to travel with me. I’d met Gregyears earlier at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Spirituality andHealing, where he served as the medical director.“In America we focus on battling diseases once they occur,” says Greg, 46, whocompleted residencies in both internal medicine and pediatrics at the Universityof Minnesota, holds a divinity degree from Harvard, and is one of the world’sleading experts on Kampo, Japan’s traditional herbal medicine. “However, intraditional Asian thought, the highest, most honored form of medicine wasprevention, and the lowest was treatment. Today in Japan, the focus is onavoiding disease in the first place. There are massive national and localefforts underway to prevent diabetes and heart disease. Japan’s prioritiesrepresent a profoundly different way of understanding medicine.”At the University of Minnesota, Greg taught medical students the science ofherbal medicines and dietary supplements as well as issues in cross-culturalclinical care. There, he was also the principal investigator of the largestclinical trial ever undertaken in the West of a Kampo formula. He obtained FDAapproval to import and study in human volunteers keishi bukuryo gan, an1,800-year-old remedy consisting of four herbs and a mushroom for treatingmenopausal hot flashes.Recently he’d accepted an invitation to serve as an associate professor atTokyo’s Keio University School of Medicine, where he taught and studied thepharmaceutical efficacy of traditional medicines. His training, in my book,supremely qualified him to help us tease out Okinawa’s lifestyle of longevity.No wonder I wanted him along.AN UNLIKELY PARADISEI joined Greg in Tokyo, spent a few days interviewing Japanese longevityexperts, and then the two of us flew to Okinawa together. When we landed inNaha, Okinawa’s capital city, we hailed a taxi and made our way through theslanting rain to the center of town. The streets were lined with a profusion oflow-slung, typhoon-proof concrete structures that increased in height as wereached downtown. Towering electronic lights blinked on every building: Sony,Hitachi, Coca-Cola. As our taxi crept down gridlocked streets, raindropssplattered on the windshield in garish red, blue, and green blotches ofrefracted light. At an intersection near our hotel, we passed a bubble teastand, a shop selling electronic merchandise, a Pizza Hut, and a McDonald’s. Ithought: This is the longevity Shangri-la?The first morning, Greg and I caught up with photographer David McLain andassistant Rico Noce for breakfast in the hotel restaurant. David greeted me bypointing outside to rain that had fallen relentlessly through the night andsnapped, “It’s been like this for three days. I can’t shoot in this.” This was abad omen. David, with whom I’ve worked on eight expeditions, has anirrepressibly good nature.image [Images/95.jpg]Okinawan Seiryu Toguchi, 105, soaks up a few moments of sunshine, which helpshis body manufacture vitamin D.I turned to Rico, who shook my hand energetically and demanded, “How are you?”We’d corresponded by e-mail, but I’d never actually met her in person. “Sitdown,” she instructed. Somewhat relieved, I could see she had the can-do pluckwe needed to get the job done, rain or no rain. Over a breakfast of fermentedsoybeans, pickled cabbage, and raw fish, David, Greg, and I came up with a gameplan. Meanwhile, Rico frantically took notes, occasionally stabbing at herbreakfast of bacon and eggs.Later that day, I’d arranged to meet Craig Willcox, a world renownedgerontologist and co-author of the New York Times best seller The OkinawaProgram, at the hotel. In the early 1990s, Craig and his identical twin brother,Dr. Bradley Willcox, were doing a study on nutrition and healthy aging at theUniversity of Toronto when they met a man who was to become the oldest in theprovince of Ontario. He was an immigrant from Okinawa named Toku Oyakawa, who atthe time was 105 and still ate the diet of his homeland, fished every day, andkept his 92-year-old wife happy.Toku got the Willcoxes thinking of two things: One, they wanted to see the realplace that produced these long-lived people; and two, if an Okinawan living infreezing Canada could be healthy at the ripe old age of 105, what about the restof us? Could Blue Zone behaviors travel?In Okinawa, the Willcox brothers met Dr. Makoto Suzuki, a demure Japanesemedical doctor who had discovered this Okinawan Blue Zone. He took the youngscientists under his wing. In 1975, Dr. Suzuki had been sent to the main islandfrom Tokyo to help open Okinawa’s first medical school. While there, he’d heardabout a famous centenarian living in the countryside and decided to investigate.Arriving at the centenarian’s village, he realized that all he had was thewoman’s name, no address. “I saw this healthy-looking woman walking down thestreet with a hoe, looking like she was on her way to farm,” Suzuki told melater. “So I stopped to ask her if she’d heard of the centenarian woman. Shesaid, ‘I am her.’ I could not believe it! She looked like a woman of 70. Butlater I did the investigation and it was true.”The experience piqued Suzuki’s curiosity enough to conduct a survey of theentire island. He identified 40 centenarians on Okinawa, an extraordinarily highnumber for such a small place. (Okinawa’s main island is about 15 miles acrossat its widest point and a little more than 60 miles long.) But what reallyastounded him was the proportion of healthy centenarians. In the United Statesor Europe, you can expect only about 15 percent of centenarians to beindependent in their activities of daily living. Although later cohorts ofcentenarians tend be less functional than earlier cohorts, amazingly, of the 32centenarians Dr. Suzuki was able to track down for the second part of hissurvey, all but 4 were functionally independent.During the past few years, the Willcox brothers and Suzuki had received ongoinginternational attention and they had grown weary of the endless interviewrequests and film crews. Luckily, I knew Craig from his precelebrity days, andhe agreed to help me during my stay as much as his schedule permitted.“Danmeister!” I heard him shout from across the hotel lobby. I was glad to seehim, still the athletic academic, with a sleek physique, sharp features, andround, owlish glasses—a top-notch scientist with a boyish streak. I never knewhow he got that name for me, but I let it stick.“Craig,” I shouted back. “You haven’t changed.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------OKINAWA FACTS * Nation: Japan * Location: Ryukyu Islands between the North Pacific and the East China Sea * Okinawa Population: 1.3 million--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I told him what I had discovered in Sardinia, and he told me about his findingsover the past five years. He told me that the Okinawan culture of longevity wasbeginning to disappear with the encroaching American food culture. KentuckyFried Chicken and McDonald’s were the last calamity to befall Okinawa; thefast-food invasion has threatened many of the positive behaviors that led toOkinawan longevity. It really rests with women over 70, he told me. “Men under55 in Okinawa are now among the most obese, and do not live much longer than theJapanese average. So you better work fast.” I asked him if he could help me meeta couple dozen centenarians as soon as possible.“The privacy laws have tightened quite a bit since the last time you were here,”he said. “It is going to be much harder for you to talk to centenarians andharder for me to help you.”“What about Dr. Suzuki?” I asked.“Same thing,” he replied.The situation only seemed to worsen over the next two days. I went upstairs andbrainstormed with Rico. If Craig Willcox, Dr. Suzuki, and the various governmentoffices couldn’t help make connections, the whole Okinawan part of the NationalGeographic story might be a bust.Rico took on the challenge. The government was reluctant to release names fromthe koseki, the family register system that is the Japanese equivalent of ourbirth registration system among other roles, but she had found a list ofOkinawa’s top 100 centenarians (there were some 700 among Okinawa’s 1.3 millionpeople) in the archives of a local newspaper. She figured we’d just look uptheir telephone numbers and start calling—but whether from hearing loss ortradition, many centenarians didn’t have phones.Those who did have phones frequently lived with protective children who were notinclined to grant access to foreigners. It wasn’t a good way to communicateunder the best of circumstances. We called one rather well-known centenarian,announced that we were from National Geographic, and that we wanted to interviewhim. He replied that he was fed up with telemarketers and hung up on us.A bright spot opened up on the third day when Craig phoned to say that he’d setup a dinner meeting for us that night with Suzuki at a nice sushi restaurantoverlooking Naha’s concrete expanse. It was loud, and the rice paper screen thatseparated our table from the main dining room did little to muffle the noise.Having just endured a fairly discouraging day, I sat down right beside Suzuki. Iknew that he had personally visited more than 700 of the approximately 2,000centenarians in Okinawa during his 25-year study; that he knew where many stilllived, but would understandably be protective of their privacy. “Can you help usfind centenarians?” I asked him directly.“Very difficult,” he replied in rudimentary English, although I know he canspeak it fluently and understands even nuances of the language.So he didn’t know of any I could contact?“No, no, can’t do that!” he responded. “I can’t give you any names, of course,but there is nothing that would prevent you from following me as I go visitthese people….”I needed the hopeful boost Suzuki had provided. In Sardinia, I could go intoalmost any village in the morning and have three centenarian interviewscompleted by noon. Okinawa is different. Protocol required us to first receivethe blessing of the mayor or another high-ranking official, wait a day or twofor his office to arrange the interview (or not), and another day or two tofacilitate our request.I also knew that meeting centenarians was just part of the job. Piecing togetherthe cultural recipe for how these centenarians lived throughout their lives waswhere the true answers lay. For that, I needed to get a feeling of how Okinawanslived before fast-food restaurants arrived on the island. Naha’s concrete chaosdidn’t feel like part of that equation. But it was where I could find experts.On day two, Rico and I visited Dr. Kazuhiko Taira, an M.D. and faculty member inthe Department of Tourism Sciences at University of the Ryukyus. For 20 years hehad studied residents of the Okinawan village of Ogimi and compared it to placesin the Akita and Aomori prefectures in northern Japan. Every year he updated hissurvey of centenarians in Okinawa and found that Okinawans suffer significantlyfewer strokes. He believed that it was related to diet, specifically the eatingof less salt and more pork.“Okinawa people are able to grow vegetables in gardens all year long,” he said,referring to the island’s comparatively tropical climate. “They don’t need tomake pickles and preserve food as people do in Japan’s northern islands.”A salt-heavy diet may contribute to high blood pressure and weaken cerebralarteries, he said, causing micro-tears that are precursors to strokes. Consuminga balance of both animal and plant protein through pork may help repair orretard those tears. It has long been an Okinawan custom to butcher a family pigin celebration of the lunar New Year. The pig is cooked for a long time, the fatis skimmed off, and the rest of the animal is used in a stewlike dish.“Okinawa people eat most every part of the pig,” Taira said. “There is a lot ofvitamin B1 and B2 in it, and collagen, which is good for you.” This wasdifferent from many Japanese, who derive more of their protein from fish. Toomuch animal protein can increase your chances of obesity; the Okinawancentenarians traditionally ate meat only during infrequent ceremonial occasions.THE POWER OF THE GARDENOn our fifth day, I got an unexpected call from Craig. Dr. Suzuki and somemedical students were planning to check on Kamada Nakazato, a 102-year-old womanliving on the Motobu Peninsula. Would Greg and I like to join? You bet!We drove in Craig’s car, following Suzuki north past Naha’s concrete jumble. Wetook the expressway along the island’s backbone, past the enormous Americanmilitary base and through Nago City. Then we turned onto Motobu Peninsula, whichon a map looks like a knobby appendage on the island’s side. Here the roadsnarrow and the open spaces flanking them widen. We hugged the coast for a whileand saw the blue, glimmering sea and a few beaches. In some areas, houses hemmedthe coast, but semitropical vegetation fringed most of the shore. Inland,enormous vegetable gardens ringed the villages and old people wearing enormousconical hats bent over their crops. The air smelled like things ripening.Kamada Nakazato’s home was typical of those in the region—equal parts fortressand cozy enclave. Surrounded by a low, coral-rack wall, the house was somewhatsunken, with a steep, slanted roof—all architectural defenses against thehalf-dozen or so typhoons that blow in from the seas during Okinawa’s typhoonseason. Greg, who has crystal-blue eyes and an inclination toward bursts ofenthusiasm, was craning his neck to take in the expansive gardens behind thehouse and motioning for me to do the same.“There are herbs galore!” he said in a loud, faux whisper. “I’ll bet herlongevity secret is growing right out there.”We made our way inside the stone walls and onto the step-up deck in front. Ricepaper screens served as a front door. Closed screens mean do not disturb; openscreens are an invitation to the village to stop by for a visit. Kamada’sscreens were wide open. We called out a greeting and heard a yelp in reply. Wetook that as an invitation to enter.Kamada was wrapped in a kimono and sat next to two of her children, both intheir 70s. Her cottony, white hair was brushed straight back, revealing her highcheekbones and deep brown eyes, which widened as we walked through the door.When she saw us, she gleefully raised her hands and began singing, holding herhands up and swaying back and forth. Her children, taking the cue, clapped inunison. I felt an instant affection for her. She struck me as warm andapproachable, yet possessing a commanding charisma.Craig had told us in the car that Kamada was the village noro, a priestess whocommunes with the gods and ancestors and serves as spiritual adviser to thetownspeople. Starting in the 15th century, the noro had become an official partof Okinawa’s political structure, appointed by the court and assigned to certainvillages. The succession of noro within a family became a basic rule, and theposition was passed down to a niece, daughter, or granddaughter. Kamada was thelast in her family’s 400-year noro lineage.Her regal title stood in sharp contrast to her home, a traditional, three-roomstructure made of weather-beaten wood. In one corner, an urn, some pine boughs,old family pictures, and a lunar calendar sat on what appeared to be an altar.Except for a bed, no furniture cluttered her house. Everyone, including Kamada,sat on the floorSuzuki opened his medical kit and took her blood pressure, measured herpercentage of body fat, and drew blood that he siphoned into little vials andput in his box for later analysis. He tested Kamada’s mental acuity. “What yearis this?” he asked.“The year of the chicken,” she shot back.“What season is it?”“That’s a stupid question,” she quipped. We all laughed.“What day is it?”image [Images/104.jpg]Okinawan families honor their ancestors by having a meal at the family tomb.“Today is the fifth of February, the thirteenth of the lunar calendar.” Her noroduties required her to track festivals using the lunar calendar.Satisfied, Suzuki invited me to ask a few questions. I asked her about her past,about what it was like being a young girl in Okinawa before World War II.Kamada’s father, a rice and sugarcane farmer, could barely feed his family, soin the third grade, Kamada dropped out of school to help her mother raise thefamily.“Life was hard,” she began. “We had famines, times when people starved to death.Even when times were good, all we ate was imo (sweet potato) for breakfast,lunch, and dinner.”Her story matched what I had read of the island’s history. Okinawan peasantslike Kamada’s family had lived hard lives. Most of them scraped out a living bycultivating millet, rice, and barley, which were poorly suited for the island’srocky soil. Though Okinawa’s warm, semitropical climate provided for growingseasons, the half dozen annual typhoons that whipped through destroyed crops.The Okinawan farmer and his family worked ceaselessly to keep up, and oftensuffered chronic malnutrition. The five-year-old child helped weed the ricefield. The grandmother tended the vegetable garden. The grandfather carried woodfrom the hills. The idea of retirement never occurred to the Okinawan peasant.To this day there’s not a word for it in their language.Things improved a little in 1605 when an Okinawan brought the sweet potato backwith him from China. This hardy miracle tuber thrived just fine in Okinawa’sstingy soil and weathered its typhoons and monsoons. It was a boon for peasants,quickly becoming a staple. Boiled, it also provided food for livestock, so eventhe poorest Okinawan could now afford meat—albeit only during the annual lunarfestival. By the time of Kamada’s birth in 1902, Okinawans got 80 percent oftheir calories from sweet potatoes.At age 18, Kamada entered into an arranged, political marriage with a man fouryears her senior. Their union produced three sons and three daughters. When thechildren were still small, Kamada’s husband frequently traveled to mainlandChina and Palau in search of work.“Raising children by myself was a big job,” Kamada admitted. “At times there wasno income. I had to weave straw hats to make money on the side.” She pantomimedpushing a needle through thick straw to make a tight weave. I noticed that therepetition had permanently bent her right index finger at a 45-degree angle. Herhusband eventually returned and they raised their children to adulthood. Twomoved away but two still lived on the same street in rural Motobu. Her husbanddied ten years ago, at age 96.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SWEET POTATOESSweet potatoes are a delicious way to pack in vitamins and minerals. High infiber, vitamin A, potassium, vitamin C, and folic acid, “sweets” are also easyto prepare. Prick one with a fork, microwave it for about five minutes, and justseason with salt and pepper.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The secret to surviving 75 years of marriage?“I learned to be patient,” she said.I asked Kamada to describe her morning routine. “I wake up at about 6 a.m. andmake a pot of jasmine tea and eat my breakfast—usually miso soup withvegetables. Then,” she pointed toward her door, “I go to the sacred grove topray for the health of the village and thank the gods for making it safe.” Ilater learned that this sacred grove was a clearing in the forest about 650 feet(200 meters) from the house with a gazebo-like structure. Craig leaned over tome. “In her mind, she is very much convinced that the health of the villagedepends upon her paying attention to the stars and the moon and the spirits ofher ancestors. Even as a centenarian, it is a job she undertakes veryseriously.”At noon, Kamada said, she wanders into the kitchen garden behind her house toharvest some herbs and vegetables for her lunch. “I’ll use mugwort to give myrice flavor or turmeric to spice my soup,” she said. “I don’t eat very much anymore. Usually just stir-fried vegetables and maybe some tofu.”“And meat?” I asked.“Oh yes, I like meat, but not always. When I was a girl, I ate it only duringthe New Year festivals. I’m not in the habit of eating it every day.”“Have you ever eaten a hamburger or had a Coke?” I asked. I knew that Okinawahad more fast-food restaurants per capita than anywhere else in Japan; what maybe the biggest A&W restaurant in the world was just 30 miles south of here.Perhaps she had visited one?Kamada’s forehead wrinkled. She leaned over to her daughter, for interpretation.“She never drank a Coke in her life,” the daughter answered. When she first sawa hamburger a few years ago, Kamada had asked, “What do you do with that?”“My mother eats in the tradition of women her age,” the daughter continued.“They are not used to rich foods, but rather the foods that they ate as youngwomen, before the war. She mostly eats vegetables from her garden—daikon, bittermelon, garlic, onion, peppers, tomatoes—and some fish and tofu. All day long shenurses a pot of hot, green tea. Before each meal she takes a moment to say harahachi bu, and that keeps her from eating too much.”“Hara hachi bu?” I repeated.“It’s a Confucian-inspired adage,” Craig chimed in. “All of the old folks say itbefore they eat. It means ‘Eat until you are 80 percent full.’ We write about itin The Okinawa Program.” He continued, “Okinawa may be the only human populationthat purposefully restricts how many calories they eat, and they do it byreminding themselves to eat until they’re 80 percent full. That’s because ittakes about 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it is full.Undereating, as the theory goes, slows down the body’s metabolism in a way suchthat it produces less damaging oxidants—agents that rust the body from within.”How about sweet potatoes? Did she eat them anymore? I was test-driving ahypothesis that sweet potatoes may be part of Okinawa’s longevity theory. Thetuber was so ubiquitous that before World War II, instead of saying hello,islanders greeted each other by saying, Nmu kamatooin, which translates as, “Areyou getting enough imo?” They even erected a statue to the man, Sokan Noguni(now known as Lord Sokan or the Imo King), who first brought the sweet potato tothe island. The tuber is incredibly healthy, extremely high in vitamin C, fiber,and beta-carotene—an agent shown to have cancer-fighting properties.“No,” she snorted. “I ate imo for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 50 years. Igot tired of it.”“No one really eats it anymore,” Craig said. “It largely disappeared from thediet when the American food culture took over after WWII. It’s hard to make acase for it being a longevity food.”Most afternoons Kamada naps, does some light gardening, and then, at 4 p.m. orso, joins a group of lifelong friends—her moai—for sake and gossip. She eats avery light dinner before 6 p.m. that might include some fish soup, whatevervegetables are in season, some spring onions, salad, and rice. She’s usually inbed by 9 p.m.“So what’s the secret to living to age 102?” I ask, finally. I knew the questionwasn’t scientific, but sometimes it provoked insightful answers.“I used to be very beautiful,” Kamada replied. “I had hair that came down to mywaist. It took me a long time to realize that beauty is within. It comes fromnot worrying so much about your own problems. Sometimes you can best take careof yourself by taking care of others.”“Anything else?”“Eat your vegetables, have a positive outlook, be kind to people, and smile.”I looked over at Craig, who was sitting next to me, to see what he thought ofher response. “Well, Danmeister,” he said looking through his owlish glasses.“It took us almost 500 pages in our book to say what she said in threesentences.”Before I left, I wandered around Kamada’s home. Her bedroom was furnished withonly a thin futon rolled out on the tatami mats (thick, wall-to-wall pads madeof rice grass). In her kitchen, a bamboo steamer hung from the ceiling justbeneath an electric rice cooker. Small plates and tall narrow cups were neatlystacked and ordered on the shelves. There were no candy, cookies, or othertempting foods under the counter. If she had any junk food, it was hidden awayin the cupboards.Between Suzuki’s tests and my interviews, we stayed with Kamada for about twohours, and then we let her rest. Ignoring a possible etiquette breach, Iembraced Kamada before we left, which she enthusiastically returned. Beneath herkimono, I could feel her delicate bones. Her breath was warm on my neck. Itoccurred to me that I was embracing a century of life, and there was somethingin that knowledge that inspired profound affection and respect. I asked her ifwe could return. “Of course you may,” she said. “I’m not going anywhere.”SOY AND A SENSE OF PURPOSEAfter the interview, we stopped at a village restaurant for a late lunch. Themeals were served in bento boxes, the Japanese equivalent of an individuallysized picnic basket. I sat next to Suzuki and began plying him with questions,beginning with why he took Kamada’s blood samples.When compared to Americans of the same age, “we have found that the blood ofmale and female centenarians seems to have higher levels of sex hormones,”Suzuki said.“So is that why people are taking these hormonal supplements?” I asked, thinkingabout DHEA supplements, precursors to sex hormones (androgens and estrogens),which some believe can slow the effects of aging.“Yes, but it doesn’t work that way. The supplements are not the same as thehormones your body generates. DHEA probably has no effect on age-related changesin body composition and function.”Soy products that contain phytoestrogens are probably better than hormonesupplements, he said. Some researchers speculate that they may impart many ofthe benefits of estrogen without the cancer dangers. Okinawans eat an average ofthree ounces of soy products per day. Tofu, their main source of soy, may play arole in reducing the risk of heart disease.Greg Plotnikoff recommended that consumers select fermented soy products overnonfermented soy products whenever possible. “The medical literaturedemonstrates comparatively much better nutritional content in fermented soy,” hesaid. “And Okinawan tofu has a greater concentration of protein and good fatthan even its Japanese or Chinese counterparts.”I asked Suzuki if he thought Kamada’s vitality came from hormones or somethingelse.“I think the fact that she still retains her duties as a noro is veryimportant,” he replied. “Roles are very important here in Okinawa. They call itikigai—the reason for waking up in the morning. A sudden loss of a person’straditional role can have a measurable effect on mortality. We see thisespecially among teachers and policemen who die very soon after they quitworking. Police and teachers have very clear senses of purpose and relativelyhigh status. Once they retire, they lose both of those qualities and they tendto decline rapidly. I believe the reverse is true too. Kamada remainsfunctioning longer because she feels needed.”CENTENARIAN CLUTCHRico and I returned to Motobu twice more to follow up on Kamada’s story. Iwanted to meet Kamada’s moai and talk to the rest of her family. I wasespecially interested in how the younger generation regarded the rapidlydisappearing older generation. Did they respect their elders? Was there anyregard for the old ways in the age of fast food and text messaging?I met Kamada’s great-granddaughter, 14-year-old Kurara, in a village park whereshe was taking part in a school track meet. She blew away the competition in thefirst leg of an 800-meter relay race. As she passed the baton to her teammate,she threw her arms victoriously into the air and then ran to the finish line tocheer on her teammates. Kurara was still breathing hard when I caught up withher.“Champions!” she shouted in her confident, deep voice, pointing to her teammateswho smiled beside her. Kurara agreed to walk with me back to hergreat-grandmother’s house and answer a few questions. I wondered what mostimpressed her about her grandmother.“Straightforward.” Kurara answered in a word. She was wearing a green T-shirt,white shorts, and Nike shoes; her short-cropped hair and healthy smile gave hertomboyish good looks. “Grandma doesn’t keep stress. Sometimes she is sostraightforward it could sound harsh. Like when we offer to take care of her,she’ll say, ‘No, I’ll take care of myself!’” Then Kurara paused, realizing thatperhaps she was sounding disrespectful. “I love my Grandma’s sense of humor themost,” Kurara added. “Sometimes she farts, and she tells me it was a train goingby outside.”At Kamada’s house, I took my shoes off outside the door and climbed gently ontothe tatami mats. Kurara flew past me with her hand in the air, headed right toKamada who, wrapped as usual in her regal kimono, sat serenely on a chair. “Giveme five, Grandma!” Kamada raised her hand and slapped her great-granddaughter’s.The she turned to me and beamed a smile.Kurara told me about her family, her friends, and her affection for theBackstreet Boys. She said she loved watermelon, purple sweet potatoes, and natto(traditional fermented soybeans). She loved running and basketball and wouldrather be exercising than playing video games. When I asked Kurara what shewanted to be when she grows up, she puckered her lips and threw her head back.“I want to be a fashion model.” She stood up and sashayed across the yard,swaying her hips as if she were on a runway. “I practice everyday.”“But I also love kendo (Japanese fencing)” she said. “I am a samurai.” Switchingroles in less than a second, she extended her imaginary sword as if she wereready to attack. “Those are my dreams. But I think I will probably become aphysical education teacher. I want to teach kids to enjoy school. Mostly,though, I want to teach kids how valuable life is. I can introduce them to mygrandmother so the students can hear stories of their lives. Of course I don’tknow if she will still be around.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOY SHOPPINGSoy has the ability to lower the level of “bad” (LDL) cholesterol in the bodyand the potential to reduce the risk of heart disease.

I am shooting for150.”I waited a few days before returning to Motobu. It was late afternoon, and threedays of rain hadn’t let up. I had intentionally timed my visit for the gatheringof her moai—the group of lifelong friends who meet at Kamada’s every day. Iwalked past the coral stone wall and up to the house. Light shone through a ricepaper screen, creating the silhouettes of several animated ladies. I stopped aminute to listen to the chatter of voices, followed by squealing laughter. Iwanted to see the moai because I thought it might figure into Okinawanlongevity.The notion of moai—which roughly means “meeting for a common purpose”—originatedas a means of a village’s financial support system. If someone needed capital tobuy a parcel of land or take care of an emergency, the only way was to poolmoney locally. Today the idea has expanded to become more of a social supportnetwork, a ritualized vehicle for companionship.I meekly pulled aside the screen. Inside, Kamada’s moai sat in a circle dimlylit in the glow of the kitchen light. Kamada—clearly the queen—sat in thecenter, coaxing heat from a small charcoal stove. She was now sitting in alarge, wooden chair while the other four women sat primly on low stools or onthe floor itself. “May I come in?” I interrupted. The group fell silent. Kamadaraised her hands overhead to welcome me in.For over an hour I sat in a corner and observed, with Rico whisperingtranslations into my ear. The women gossiped and cracked jokes. Conversationranged from romantic intrigue (“She stopped seeing him after she found him withsomeone else. Big surprise, eh?”) to chatty news (“She got in a fight with herson-in-law because he is treating her daughter badly”) to job postings (“My sonneeds some help with his market stall so if any of you have a hardworkinggrandson….”).“Is this all about gossip?” I interrupted.“No,” replied 95-year-old Matsse Manna after a long pause. “If someone passesaway, the village knows to come here for help. If we hear that someone isdepressed we will go visit them.”“But how about you? How does this moai help you?”“Chatting like this is my ikigai,” said Klazuko Manna after a long pause. At 77,she was the youngest of the group. “In the morning I do the wash, so in theafternoon, I get to come here. Each member knows that her friends count on heras much as she counts on her friends. If you get sick or a spouse dies or if yourun out of money, we know someone will step in and help.” Klazuko fanned her armtoward the other women. “It’s much easier to go through life knowing there is asafety net.”“I get lonely on days when the group doesn’t meet,” Kamada added. “I go to thedoor every day at 3:30, and if my friends don’t come, I’m sad.”As I listen, it occurred to me that this little group of five women, whorepresented more than 450 years of life, might be the world’s greatestrepository of longevity wisdom. Japanese women on average were doing somethingspecial to live almost 8 percent longer than American women. Their moai may verywell be part of the equation. Chronic stress takes its toll on overall health,and these women have a culturally ingrained mechanism that sheds it everyafternoon at 3:30 p.m. Books like Bowling Alone chronicle how people in theUnited States are increasingly alienated from their neighbors. On average, anAmerican has only two close friends he or she can count on, recently down fromthree, which may contribute to an increasing sense of stress.GARDEN SECRETSFrom Motubu, Craig, Greg, Rico, and I ventured back inland and headed northalong the coastal highway toward Oku. We’d heard about several centenariansliving in remote villages on the island’s northern extreme. On one side of theroad, rain fell on mountains that sloped steeply upward, disappearing in theclouds; on the other, a leaden sky hung over the steel-blue Pacific. We passedthe village of Ogimi, where Sayoko and I had met Ushi Okushima five yearsearlier. I made a note to stop and see her on the way back.“What most impressed you guys about Kamada?” I asked, seeding a conversation.These car rides, I found, were excellent opportunities to tap into Craig’s andGreg’s expertise.“Did you see what Kamada ate?” Greg began. I looked back at him from the frontseat. His blue eyes widened as he spoke. He wore a short sleeve, plaid shirt andspoke with a slight, endearing lisp. “Some boiled vegetables and daikon, somecarrots and miso soup. Maybe some stir-fried vegetables. All very simple, withnothing processed. People don’t realize how bad sugar and meat are for them overtime.”“Why’s that?”“Its called bio-ecological prevention, or risk. Let me explain. Simple,nonprocessed foods, often found in rural societies are associated with positiveecology of friendly bacteria in our intestines. These friendly bacteria includeimmunomodulating and fiber-fermenting lactic acid bacteria,” Greg said.“Stressors of this healthy ecological system,” he continued, “such as surgery,certain medications, and consumption of meats and processed foods disrupt anatural balance and shift from friendly to unfriendly bacteria. This shiftresults in increased risk for diseases of urban or ‘sophisticated’ societies,such as inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and more. It’s associated witha low-grade systemic inflammation that is related to increased risk for alldiseases of aging, like osteoporosis, heart disease, and dementia.”image [Images/117.jpg]“To be healthy enough to embrace my great-great-grandchild is bliss,” saysKamada.“Aren’t these diseases occurring because people who eat junk food get fatter?”“Obesity is certainly a risk factor,” Greg replied. “But eating junk food alsocreates chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The inflammatoryresponse is good if we have an infection, but triggering it all the time byeating bad foods causes the body to produce chemicals that wreak havoc on ourorgans and arteries. People think that our skin is the main way our bodiesinteract with the outside world, but it is actually through our digestivetract—our stomach, large intestines, and small intestines. It has a surface areaabout the size of a tennis court. That’s a lot of inflammation for our bodies todeal with.”“I noticed lots of mugwort,” he continued. “Lots of turmeric, lots of garlic.Most people think mugwort is only for the Harry Potter books. Okinawan mugwortis one species of the genus Artemisia, which contains the most powerful naturalsubstance for fighting malaria. The World Health Organization recently made it atop priority for one form of Artemisia to be available in developing countries.”“Here in Okinawa it is nearly a weed,” Greg said. “It grows everywhere. Peopleeat it all the time and use it for medicine, including the treatment of fevers.Did you notice all the turmeric? Turmeric is one-fifth as powerful as cisplatin,which is one of the most powerful drugs in chemotherapy. Turmeric is ananti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer. This comes back to inflammation.Many age-related diseases are caused by an immune system out of balance.Excessive or unnecessary inflammation accelerates heart disease, bone loss,Alzheimer’s disease. Antioxidants found in vegetables and herbs are alsoimportant, because the same oxidation process that rusts our cars alsodeteriorates our bodies. Antioxidants mop up highly charged oxygen-free radicalsthat cause this sort of rust.“Kamada’s garden where she gets her breakfast, lunch, or dinner is more than anatural grocery store. It’s a pharmacy.” Now, Greg was gesticulatingexpansively, making great circles with his hands. He had an endearing way ofgetting very excited about matters of health and complementary medicines.“Okinawans see vegetables. I see powerful anti-inflammatory, antiviral,anticancer drugs,” he said. “You know, you don’t just wake up one day and havecancer. It’s a process, not an event. And prevention is the same way; it has tobe a daily activity. We’re used to a world of options, and we think, ‘Of all theoptions, what are the best?’ Okinawans are just born into a lifestyle thatpromotes health. They have been blessed by access to year-round fresh, organicvegetables, strong social support, and these amazing herbs that amount topreventive medicines.”Craig had been sitting next to Greg, listening patiently. Now he jumped in. “Itis not only what Okinawans eat, but how much. Their food has a very low caloricdensity, yet it is very nutritious. Compare a typical Okinawan meal—a tofustir-fry, some miso soup, and some greens to an American hamburger. The Okinawanmeal has three or four times as much volume and more nutrients but only abouthalf the calories of a burger. So you’re feeling fuller but getting leaner andliving longer. And if you remember Kamada’s hara hachi bu and eat only untilyou’re 80 percent full, you’ll even do better.”“How do you think this idea of hara hachi bu came about?” I asked. “After all,it’s not natural to want to quit eating before you’re full.” I explained mytheory of cultural evolution. After leading 17 expeditions to explore ancientmysteries, I noticed that over time, customs and traditions of successfulcultures seem to undergo an unconscious but intelligent natural selection:Practices not good for a society tended to disappear while beneficial ones oftensurvived—no matter how counterintuitive they may seem. I remember a story abouta tribe in sub-Saharan Africa that cooked over open fires inside their huts. Thehuts filled with smoke that the villagers breathed. When a Peace Corps workersaw this he reasoned that the people’s lungs were blackening with smoke. Heasked them why they cooked indoors. When no one had an answer for him, heconvinced them to move their cooking fires outside. Soon the people startedcontracting malaria at an alarming rate. It turns out that the smoke keptmalaria-carrying mosquitoes out of the huts. This outweighed the negative healtheffects of the smoke.Similarly, I don’t think the first person who ever chewed a hot pepper thought,“Mmm, good.” Capsaicin, pepper’s active ingredient, is literally caustic to theflesh. But somehow, human taste has evolved to enjoy the taste of pepper. Why?Because capsaicin is a natural disinfectant, and it kills many types offood-borne bacteria. Put hot pepper in slightly rancid meat, and it inhibitsbacteria. The person who eats the meal with the pepper lives. The person whoeats the meal without the pepper gets sick and could die. Over time, thesurvivors acquire a taste for it, and a healthy culture evolves. “Can we sayOkinawan longevity came with a similar cultural evolution?” I asked my travelingmates.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TERRIFIC TURMERICOften encountered today in spicy curries and mustard, turmeric has a longhistory of use as a culinary spice and an herbal medicine; the Ayurvedic, Unani,and Siddha systems, as well as traditional Chinese medicine, advocated its use.Research has shown this spice’s most active component, curcumin, has antioxidantproperties and may help ease inflammatory ailments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“It makes sense to me,” replied Craig. “Mugwort tastes horrible; it is verybitter. But somehow, Okinawans have developed a taste for this bitter herb andcommonly use it as seasoning in their rice. Is that because they have alwaysliked it or because their taste has evolved with what is really good for them?The same thing has happened with the vegetable known as goya (bitter melon),come to think of it. Goya looks like a wart-covered cucumber. It’s bitter ashell. Its juice is actually an astringent, the kind of food that makes youwince. But it contains high amounts of antioxidants and three compounds thatlower blood sugar. Are Okinawans eating goya because it holds some kind ofprimal appeal to human taste buds? I don’t think so.”As we came into the northern extreme of the island, and the road narrowedthrough thick jungle. This, I thought, must have been what Okinawa looked likewhen centenarians were living the first halves of their lives.We arrived at Oku in early evening. I passed a convenience store on theoutskirts of a very small town and stopped to buy some snacks. As I paid for mywasabi peas, I asked the teenage girl in the school uniform if she knew anyonein the area who was over 100. I knew at least two centenarians lived in thearea.“Across the street,” she replied. “Gozei Shinzato.”Greg, Craig, and I checked into a hotel down the block, knowing where our firstcall in the morning would be.OUTER LIMITS OF THE HUMAN MACHINEAt 7 a.m. the following day, we walked from the road, crossed the bridgespanning a burbling stream, and passed through a garden to a simple, two-roomdwelling on stilts. The rice paper screen was open, indicating that the occupantwas up.“Gozei!” I shouted.We waited outside. It was raining, of course; a curtain of water fell from theroof and spattered on the mud at our feet. Moments later Gozei emerged from herbedroom. She was elfin, barely over four-and-a-half-feet tall, and wrapped in akimono and overcoat. Her bare feet padded softly on tatami mats. She saw us,three huge American men wearing blaze-colored raincoats, and flinched. Then sheburst out laughing—chortling actually—exhaling visible puffs of mirth into thecold morning air. Her tanned, wrinkled skin squeezed into a puffed-cheek,squinty-eyed smile.“Come in,” she said. We removed our shoes, stepped up into her house, and satdown. She warned us that she spoke the Okinawan dialect and only a littleJapanese, so conversation might be difficult. Nevertheless, I managed, with afew dozen questions, to tease out her story.For most of her life, Gozei had worked in the mountains barefoot, cuttingfirewood and carrying it back to the village to sell. When she was 18 herparents arranged a marriage to a local farmer. He had four children, whom sheraised through two famines and many hard times.Once when she was working in the mountains, she came upon a much bigger womanwho had been bitten by a habu—a potentially deadly poisonous viper indigenous tothe island. Gozei, who weighs about 85 pounds, cut off a strip of her dress toapply a tourniquet to the bite, then hoisted the woman onto her back. Shecarried the woman four-and-a-half miles back to sea and into a boat that sherowed to a neighboring village for help. The woman survived. Gozei was 62.Now, 40 years later, Gozei still lived independently in a tinywood-and-rice-paper house. Her husband died after 51 years of marriage. Shetends a vegetable garden daily and harvests three times annually—mostly garlic,bitter melon (goya), scallions, and turmeric. She reads the comics hergrandchildren give her and loves watching baseball games on television. Lateafternoon is her favorite time of the day, when neighbors stop by for a visit.As the conversation dwindled, we smiled nervously at each other. “Look at herface,” Greg whispered. “That deep-skinned tan that comes from constant sunexposure. Did notice how Kamada’s skin was the same? That probably means they’veboth had steady doses of vitamin D their whole lives.”“So?”“I think vitamin D is an important ingredient in the longevity recipe,” he saidenthusiastically, as if just struck by an epiphany. “Your skin manufacturesvitamin D when it comes into contact with the sun. Without that vitamin D, weincrease our risk for nearly all age-related diseases including many types ofcancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and even autoimmune diseases like MS(multiple sclerosis).“Insufficient vitamin D markedly accelerates heart disease in kidney patients.For everyone, without enough vitamin D, bones become brittle, key hip and legmuscles become weak, and the chance of falling and breaking bones soars. Whenpeople this old break hips,” Greg nodded toward Gozei, “they usually die veryquickly.”“But I thought staying out in the sun too long gave you cancer, especially withall these changes in the ozone layer,” I said.“Sure, if you burn easily and don’t get much sun in the first place,” Gregrejoined, still whispering. “It’s different now than it was for our parents—youdon’t want to go out and fry yourself. Burns are bad but staying inside beingafraid of the sun isn’t healthy either.”“Someone like Gozei,” Greg continued, “who has a deep tan and is used to beingoutside all of the time, is optimizing her vitamin D. People who stay inside allthe time would have to drink gallons of fortified milk every day to optimizetheir vitamin D. The amount of vitamin D in a multivitamin is not enough,especially if you are living in relatively northern cities such as New York orChicago or have dark skin or work long hours or have celebrated many birthdays.Vitamin D in our bodies controls key elements of the immune system, bloodpressure, and cell growth, and is important for cancer regulation. And in thetest tube, vitamin D kills the cancers that most often kill Americans.”Gozei, who had waited patiently as Greg and I talked, hoisted herself to herfeet and ambled into the next room. I waited a moment then followed her. She’dgone into the kitchen, a narrow room illuminated only by a small open windowthat admitted feeble light from the rainy day.I stood quietly and observed. She reached under the sink, folded down a batteredwooden box that served as a step, and climbed up to reach the faucet. She filleda teapot, pivoted to put it on the stove and turned on the burner. On thecounter sat two clear jars, infusions of some sort—medicines I later learned.One of them contained garlic cloves; the other some green herb.As she waited for the water to boil, she energetically washed a few dishes and,while she was at it, removed her dentures and scrubbed them too. When the potwhistled, she removed it from the stove, squatted in the corner, and pouredboiling water over tea leaves. The room filled with the delicate, sweet aroma ofjasmine tea. Her movements were slow and deliberate with a patient resolve. Sheseemed completely oblivious to me.Back on the tatami mat, we sipped tea and made a futile attempt to restart ourconversation. We were complete strangers from different hemispheres, indeeddifferent centuries and were now at a loss for words. She smiledunderstandingly. Then she remembered the snacks! She stood up in one fluidmotion and disappeared into the kitchen again. She emerged much later with twoplates; one with lumps of raw sugar (a favorite of her grandchildren) andanother of dried minnows (her favorite). She pinched off the head of one with athumbnail and popped it into her mouth, instructing me to do likewise. Theminnow was chewy, salty, and predictably fishy-tasting, but not unpleasantly so.I chased it with a sugar lump and a sip of tea. We smiled at each other somemore.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------HOW MUCH SUN?The body needs sunlight to manufacture vitamin D, but too much sun can damagethe skin. To find balance, the National Institutes of Health advises 10–15minutes of sun exposure twice weekly, then applying sunscreen with an SPF of 15or higher afterward. This should provide enough sun to produce vitamin D withoutexposing the skin to too many damaging UV rays.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Moments later she sprang up again. This time it was to make the daily offeringto her ancestors, a ritual that is a cornerstone of Okinawa spiritual life. Shestood in front of the far wall where a built-in shelf held a collection of vaseswith flowers, urns, and old photographs. Gozei lit a few sticks of incense andset them down in front of an ancient photograph of a sullen-looking peasantcouple. A ribbon of smoke curled upward and filled the room with the smell ofsandalwood. Again, I seemed to disappear. For the next ten minutes she recited aseries of prayers bowing toward the altar. Then she sat back down and smiled.“Do you see what’s going on here?” Craig asked me. “This is what we callancestor veneration. Older Okinawan women have great respect for their deceasedancestors. They believe that if they make the proper offerings in the morning,the ancestors will watch over them for the rest of the day. It’s like ifsomething bad happens, it was meant to happen; if something good happens, it’sbecause the ancestors were looking out for them. It’s a great stress reducer forthese people. They relinquish worries to a higher power.”“Cool,” I said.“Also,” continued Craig, “do you see how she springs up and down from the mat?”How may 80-year-olds back home can get up from the floor like that? Gozei’s over100 and probably gets up and down 30 times a day. For her age, she hasincredibly good lower body strength and balance. That makes a huge difference inold-age mortality because falls and broken bones are usually fatal when seniorsreach a certain age.”At around 9 a.m., she excused herself to go make breakfast. Hoisting herself toher feet for the ninth time during our visit, she hobbled to the kitchen stovewhere she lit a flame under yesterday’s soup. She spooned in fresh carrots,radishes, tofu, a tablespoon of miso paste, and let it heat. Meanwhile, shemoved up and down the kitchen wiping clean the counters, sink, and even thewindow. Then she pulled up a chair facing the stove to wait for her soup. Theflame cast a feeble light on Gozei’s face. It occurred to me that I waswitnessing the happy limits of the human machine. I sensed neither the frailtynor the wistfulness of impeding death but rather serenity—a certain satisfactionwith a life now free of the ambition and commitments that dog younger years—alife achieved.She poured her warmed soup into a bowl, gazed at it for a few long moments andmurmured, “Hara hachi bu.” She threw me a quick glance and then looked back atthe steaming bowl, seemingly waiting for something. Then I realized: Perhaps shewanted to eat in private? I announced that I had to leave. “Thank you verymuch,” I said to her, bowing slightly. “May I come back and visit again?”“If you must,” she quipped. And she chortled again, with her broad smile.POWER OF NOWGreg and Craig returned to Naha, but before they left, Craig gave me a lead onanother location in the Okinawan Blue Zone: He told me to go back to Motobu andtake the ferry to Ie Shima, a tiny island about ten miles off the mainland.There, his records showed, I would find 8 people over 100 living among apopulation of 5,300—an astounding number of centenarians. “Good luck,Danmeister. Tell me what you find.”That afternoon, Rico and I took the 30-minute ferry ride to Ie Shima and watchedthe tiny island, dominated by a solitary 551-foot-high volcano, come into view.Until now, we’d focused on Okinawa’s emerging fame as a Blue Zone, but for manyAmericans, it has a darker reputation. The Battle of Okinawa was the largestamphibious assault of the World War II Pacific campaign. From April to June of1945, the Allies mounted 1,300 ships and tens of thousands of troops against theJapanese. Some 70,000 American soldiers and Navy personnel were wounded or losttheir lives; estimates for Okinawan civilian deaths range from 100,000 to150,000.We tend to lump Okinawans with the Japanese, but they’re actually a distinctrace—largely peasants—of the Ryukyu Kingdom subjugated by the Japanese in thelate 19th century. They possessed none of the imperial ambitions of theirTokyo-based overlords, who forced them to fight in World War II. Centenariansrecount how Japanese soldiers used their Okinawan draftees as human shields,forced to confront GI machine guns though armed only with bamboo spears.American warships rained down some 600,000 shells and fired more than 1.7million rounds from the ground in the battle known as the “typhoon of steel.”The assault literally changed the island’s topography.Ie Shima’s part in the Battle of Okinawa lasted six days. Many Okinawans werekilled. But one of the dead was Ernie Pyle, the Pulitzer Prize-winning warcorrespondent whose dispatches captured the heroism and humanity of the AmericanG.I. during World War II. His heartbroken comrades erected a wooden crossmarking the place where he died from a bullet wound to the head. Today aninscription on a stone monument reads: “At this spot, the 77th Infantry Divisionlost a Buddy, Ernie Pyle, 18 April 1945.”When Rico and I landed, we rented bicycles and peddled to city hall to make anappointment with the mayor. We needed to ask permission to set up interviewswith centenarians. We fully expected an overnight wait for a meeting. Instead,an assistant brought us right in to see the mayor in his large, fan-cooledoffice and offered us green tea.“How can I help you?” the mayor asked.An affable man of perhaps 35, he seemed removed from the crushing protocol ofNaha. We asked him if he knew any of the eight centenarians that we had heardwere living on the island.“I know one,” he told us. “Kamata Arashino. She’s an incredible lady. Everybodyknows her as a local hero.” He went to a file cabinet and pulled out a bookletof local history, then thumbed through to the page about Kamata and beganreading. Rico translated:It was a rainy day in April. Forty-three-year-old Kamata Arashino and her 3children were hiding with 130 other villagers in a cramped cave. Five daysearlier, American troops had stormed Ie-jima and had killed nearly half of ourisland’s population. Battleships were shelling the island from offshore. Theonly hope for these poor peasants was to take shelter in a cave. They were toldthat if American soldiers captured them, they’d be tortured to death. So in theevent of capture, villagers were given suicide bombs they could detonate for apainless ending. After several days, American troops landed on western shores ofthe island. Troops advanced from the beach toward the cave. The villagers made ahasty decision to detonate the bomb. But a split second before the bomb wentoff, Kamata decided that she wanted to live. She rushed her children to the backof the cave. There was a white flash, an ear-shattering blast, and the cave’sroof collapsed….“That was an amazing story,” I said. “And is Kamata still alive?”“Yes,” the mayor said to me. “She still lives right here in the village.”“Can I see her?”“Why, yes.” The mayor led us outside city hall and pointed down the street to asimple house close by. It was only about a block away.Seventy-four-year old Shigeichi, a bald man with a permanent smile opened thedoor. “Kamata is my mother,” he said when I told him I was looking for the womanwho had survived the cave blast. “I was in that cave with her.” He invited usinto his living room, where we took off our shoes and sat cross-legged at a lowtable. He poured us green tea.He laughed good-heartedly at my questions about his life and that of his mother.“Our life was very difficult before the war,” he began. “Like most people here,we had to live off of what we produced. We ate sweet potatoes three meals a day,and maybe some fish. Once a year, during the lunar New Year, we’d slaughter thefamily pig and eat pork. Mostly we were hungry, though.” He chuckled.“Then the war came. There was no food. We ate miso and drank rainwater. When theAmerican troops landed here in April 1945, they ran up the beach firing machinegun—tot, tot, tot,” Shigeichi mimicked machine gun fire. “Battleships shelled usfrom the sea. Over half of the people on the island died.”“Does it feel strange to have an American in your house?” I asked, feelingmildly guilty for representing “the other side” of that war.“No.” He dismissed the question with a wave. “That was a different time.” Then Iasked him about the cave and how the mayor had told us his mother’s story.image [Images/132.jpg]Okinawans maintain strong social connections through regular gatherings of amoai.“It was misery,” he said, the smile leaving his face. “We were hiding fromAmerican bullets. We had no food, little water; it was so crowded you couldbarely lie down. Then somebody shouted that the Americans were coming. My motheris a strong woman. She wasn’t going to let us die. Just before the bomb wentoff, she threw us to the ground and put a futon over us. I heard a bang so loudthat my ears still ring today.” He tapped his hearing aid. “Big chunks of theceiling fell on us.”“What I most remember was the terrible silence after the bomb went off. Over 110people died. Miraculously, my family lived.“The Americans captured us but did not hurt us. Instead, they fed us rations.Eventually, the war ended and prosperity came. My mother lives with my wife andchildren. Every afternoon after school, the grandchildren visit with theirgrandmother.”Months later on a return trip to Okinawa, I was to meet Kamata in the old-agerecreation center where she spends her days. Inside, 30 or so seniors sat attables chatting or doing crafts. It looked like a bright, cheerful kindergartenwith hand-drawn pictures on the walls and board games on the table. But itsmelled, as these places often do, of urine. Bent old men hobbled by withwalkers; one lady slouched in a chair with a string of drool hanging from hermouth like clear spaghetti. Though Kamada and Gozei don’t have access to thistype of recreation, it struck me that they were better off with their gardens,their moais, and the weekend visits from grandkids.We found Kamata sitting off to the side folding towels and chatting with threeother women about her age. She was small—no taller than four feet—and dressed ina colorful shirt. She had short, white hair that she combed straight back fromher forehead. Her century-old face was wrinkled like a pumpkin after a hardfreeze. She was nearly deaf, but she was sharp, quick-witted. Her eyes dartedabout in a way that showed she was aware of everything going on around her. Shesmiled when I sat down next to her.I told her that I’d traveled the world interviewing centenarians and that herstory was the best one that I had heard. Could I ask her about it?“I endured great misery,” she said, striking a chord common to many Okinawancentenarians. “I was hungry all the time for many years. My husband and my firstson were killed in the war.”I asked her about the cave. “Yes, I was there. There was a great explosion and Ilived, my children and I.” She looked up and saw me taking notes. “This isenough!” she said, chopping the air with her hand. “I’m tired of the past. Idon’t want to talk about it. I’m happy now. I have enough to eat. I’m surroundedby my friends. Why relive misery when better times have arrived? I’ve livedthose hardships, and now they serve me well because they allow me to enjoytoday.”LIFE: A POPULARITY CONTEST AFTER ALL?Was Kamata’s ability to put the past behind her and live in the moment one ofthe stress-coping mechanisms that explained her longevity? Or was it thehardship, meager diet, and sense of belonging that came with living withfamily—and being there for grandchildren? With few exceptions, the healthiestcentenarians possessed lifestyles and temperaments very similar to those ofKamada, Gozei, and Kamata.Over the next three weeks, Rico and I were to meet dozens of centenarians—alldifferent variations of each other. We interviewed Yoshiei Shiroma, a tanned,leather-skinned man from Naha, who told us that candy was the secret to hislongevity. He not only ate it every day, he also made his own, crushing sugarcane and boiling it down in his backyard.“If you eat so much candy,” I asked him, “how come you have such nice teeth?”“They’re false,” he laughed, tapping his white dentures.Sitting on the floor was part of the daily routine for 94-year-old KoutokuKinjo. It helped keep him flexible so that he could still practice bojutsu (amartial art using a stick) and ride his motorcycle to his garden every day.Fumi Chinen has never used a dirty word—not once—in all her 99 years. We met herat her clothing stall in the Naha market. With her sweet smile and hair pulledback in a bun, she looked like the kind of grandma everyone would want. Heradvice for longevity included: “Eat eel every day, work in a place where you cansocialize, and if anyone ever gives you something and tells you it’s healthy,don’t eat it!”To stay young, innkeeper Ishikichi Takana prays every day. “My ancestors arewatching over me,” the 99-year-old told me. “I never pray for a long life, but Ijust express my gratitude for another day. It reminds me that every day isimportant.” We visited Seiryu Toguchi, a 105-year-old man whose ikigai wastending his garden and playing his lute. His neighbors all looked after him outof affection.I spent a morning on a Naha beach working out with Fumiyasu Yamakawa, a one-timebanker. Every day at 4:30 a.m., he cycled to the beach, swam a half hour, ran ahalf hour, did yoga, and then met with a group of other Okinawan seniors whostood in a circle and laughed.“Why is that?” I asked.“It’s vitamin S,” he said. “You smile in the morning and it fortifies you allday long.”ALL DIFFERENTThe common attributes of these Okinawan centenarians—their hard-edged humor,affably smug dispositions, hardship-tempered appreciation for what is, not whatcould have been, and their purpose-driven, tradition-based lifestyle—might looklike clues to their longevity. But they wouldn’t hold much scientific sway. Youcan’t generalize about a whole population from a few stories. That’s where Dr.Nobuyoshi Hirose, one of Japan’s foremost centenarian researchers, came in.Earlier during my stay in Tokyo, Greg had set up a dinner with Dr. Hirose. Ashort, amiable scholar with an odd sense of humor and a wheezing laugh, Hirosedescribed 15 years of centenarian research. During the past 40 years, he said,Japan’s centenarian population had mushroomed. I asked him if he could explainwhy.“The only common factor we could find is the heterogeneity of centenarians,” hesaid. “In other words, they are all different.”Like all credible longevity experts, Hirose avoided definitive conclusions. Butas the night wore on, and the sake flowed, he loosened up. Hirose had discoveredthat the daily intake of protein, fat, carbohydrates, and total calories waslowest among centenarians (mostly because of their lower body weight). The bigdifference between centenarians and younger populations was the greater appetitefor vegetables, and especially for dairy products, among centenarians. Theydidn’t necessarily eat more or less than others, relative to body weight, butwhat they did eat was rich in calcium, vitamins, and iron.Hirose reached down for his briefcase and pulled out a map with tiny red dots toillustrate the distribution of centenarians in Japan, each dot representing tencentenarians. In the northernmost islands, there was a sparse scattering ofdots. But the dots thickened toward the south, and in Okinawa, the cluster wasso dense that it appeared as a red blotch on the map.“Japan has seven semi-supercentenarians per million people,” Hirose said,referring to those over age 110. In Okinawa, the rate is 35semi-supercentenarians per million. “Perhaps it’s because in the north, whereit’s colder, old people are more likely to die of respiratory infections. Orbecause in Okinawa they can grow vegetables year-round and therefore eat fewersalty pickles and canned meat. Or perhaps exposure to more sun gives Okinawansan advantage?” That would support Greg’s vitamin D theory.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“SUPER”A nonagenarian is a person who is in his or her 90s, a centenarian is someonewho reaches the age 100 and older, but a supercentenarian is a person aged 110and higher. Today, the exact number of supercentenarians in the world isunknown, but studies show that worldwide their overall numbers have beenincreasing steadily since the 1980s.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------He shifted gears to describe the work he and his researchers had been doing onhappiness.“We see that people over 40 tend to get less happy with age, until about age80,” he said, drawing a U-shaped curve on a piece of paper. “That’s when theirwell-being begins to curve upward again. By the time a woman reaches 100, she ishappier than a 40-year-old, even though she’s probably functioning poorly. Thisis due to our favorable social environment. Americans emphasize biologicalaging. You tend to age alone. In Japan we focus on social, environmental aging.We think about aging in the context of a family or community.”Centenarians also tend to be decisive, he continued. “They know what they wantand then stay on course. But when life circumstances force them to adapt, theybecome flexible thinkers, able to embrace the change. Almost always, they arevery likable people too.” Even those who may have been cantankerous in theiryouth learn the value of good humor and grace in cultivating the loyalty andpatience of their friends and caregivers as their level of functioning declines.They make it fun and rewarding to be around them.”ANOTHER VISIT WITH USHIBefore I left Okinawa, I paid one final visit to 104-year-old Ushi—Okinawa’semblem of its Blue Zone. After three weeks of rain, it was a wet, gloomyafternoon when I arrived in Ogimi. I spent some time wandering through thepatchwork labyrinth of garden-and-hut-lined streets. People were inside, Iimagined, sitting on the floor, drinking green tea, or napping warmly in theirbedrolls. From one low, wooden house with a dripping, slanting roof I heard theringing of laughter—big, hee-hawing, belly laughing. Ushi.Inside her house, Ushi sat snugly wrapped in a kimono. Her hair was combed backrevealing her bronzed forehead and alert, green eyes. Her smooth hands layserenely folded in her lap. At her feet, her 77-year-old daughter, Kikue, andbest friends, 90-year-old Setzu Taira and 96-year-old Matsu, sat cross-legged ontatami mats. Kikue, who I later learned was very protective of her mother,dutifully poured me a green tea. I began to ask questions.Since I’d visited Ushi with Sayoko, Ushi had taken her first paying job, triedto run away from home, and had begun wearing perfume.“Perfume?” I asked.“She has a new boyfriend,” Setzu offered. “He’s only 75 years old.”I look at Ushi as she clapped a hand over her mouth and unleashed one of herblessed hee-haw laughs. When the echoes faded, I sat quietly and let the ladiesresume their conversation.The house looked the same as it did during my last visit: the low table whereUshi takes meals, the ancestor shrine in the main room, the simple futon rollvisible through the open bedroom door, the age-browned wooden wall, the tatamimats worn smooth with decades of use. Near a back door I saw soiled gloves,wooden thongs, and the large conical hat—Ushi’s garden wear. For the next fewminutes, I was happy to immerse myself in the exotic simplicity of hot jasminetea on a cold day, sheltered from the rain in the simple conviviality of ruralOkinawa.I looked over at Setzu, who was sitting cross-legged next to me. Gray strandsstreaked Setzu’s otherwise inky-black hair. I was sitting several feet away fromher, but could smell the fields she’d been working that morning, the scent ofperspiration and earth. With a gentle hand on Ushi’s arm, she drew herself closeto her old friend’s ear to recount some memory. (Perhaps of my last visit?)After a moment, she noticed me staring at her, and with a side glance, smiled atme. But then she quickly turned away, shyly. No doubt she remembered the secretshe had told me five years earlier.The first time I met Ushi and Setzu, we’d had lunch together. I was here for the2000 “IslandQuest” interactive expedition. Over a meal of stir-fried bittermelon, kelp, millet rice, and fennel tea, I had interviewed them about theirlongevity. The conversation started off predictably enough, with me askingquestions of the what’s-your-secret variety. They answered dutifully. Each ofthem had come from a life of hardship. As children, they nearly starved. Duringthe war, they’d hidden in the mountains and lived on berries. Setzu remembersbeing caught by an American soldier while she was searching for food. Thesoldier told her to get into a line with other Okinawans. She thought she wouldbe shot. Instead, the Americans handed out chocolate and biscuits to them.“When I tasted that chocolate,” she’d said, her eyes welling up, “I knew mychildren would live.” She’d looked down and sobbed silently, then looked upagain. “I’ve waited all my life to thank someone for that. So now I thank you.”Now, seeing her again at Ushi’s house, I remembered feeling a strong sense ofembarrassment and pride at hearing Setzu’s story. As an American, I was looselyconnected to both the cause of her suffering and her salvation. I also knew Iwas inexorably linked to the beginning of the end of her way of life.In prewar Okinawa, hardship had tempered the majority of people who lived tobecome centenarians: periods of hunger, of discipline, of physical exertion, ofeating bitter-tasting but healthy foods, like goya. When America won the war andestablished a military base on Okinawa, it brought peace, prosperity, jobs, anda culture of rich fast food and huge portions. But as is the case with moststories of development, prosperity arrived as a paradox: The end of economichardship also brought an end to the same disciplines, lifestyles, workrequirements, and the diet that had helped foster the culture’s extraordinarylongevity.After being starved for so many centuries, Okinawans seized this new foodculture. They quickly developed a taste for canned meat (Hormel to this daystill exports approximately five million pounds of SPAM a year to Okinawa) andfast food (Okinawans eat more hamburgers per capita than any of Japan’s other 47prefectures). A sharp increase in obesity-related diseases such as diabetes hasensued. Okinawa now has Japan’s highest rate of obesity, and, among middle-agedmen, one of the highest rates of premature deaths from cardiovascular diseases.While Okinawan women are still among the longest-lived people on earth, men aredragging down the region’s average life expectancy. Formerly the longevityleaders (and still the leaders in remaining life expectancy at age 65), by theyear 2000, Okinawan men had dropped to the middle of the pack, sitting in 26thplace among 47 prefectures in life expectancy at birth. In other words, we cannow witness two distinct groups in Okinawa: A healthy, older generation with alonger life expectancy, and a distinctly less healthy younger generation whoselife expectancy growth has slowed such that they are losing ground in comparisonto other Japanese prefectures. One of the main culprits: a brand of prosperityimported from the United States.I sat with Setzu, Matsu, Ushi, and her daughter for another hour. Outside, duskwas falling. Ushi’s daughter shot me a glare that meant, “You’ve overstayed yourwelcome.” Ushi, Matsu, and Setzu seemed to take the cue and fall silent inunison. These women belonged to the same moai for nearly a century, and now theyseemed to communicate wordlessly. I had one more question.What was Ushi’s ikigai, her pervasive sense of purpose? “It’s her longevityitself,” blurted Ushi’s daughter. “She brings pride to our family and thisvillage, and now feels she must keep living even though she is often tired.”I looked at Ushi for her own answer.“My ikigai is right here,” she says after a moment with a slow sweeping gesturethat takes in Setzu, Matsu, and her simple surroundings. “If this goes away, Iwill wonder why I’m still living.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------OKINAWA’S LONGEVITY LESSONSAmong the centenarians in Okinawa’s Blue Zone, these practices are common.Embrace an ikigai.Older Okinawans can readily articulate the reason they get up in the morning.Their purpose-imbued lives gives them clear roles of responsibility and feelingsof being needed well into their 100s.Rely on a plant-based diet.Older Okinawans have eaten a plant-based diet most of their lives. Their mealsof stir-fried vegetables, sweet potatoes, and tofu are high in nutrients and lowin calories. Goya, with its antioxidants and compounds that lower blood sugar,is of particular interest. While centenarian Okinawans do eat some pork, it istraditionally reserved only for infrequent ceremonial occasions and taken onlyin small amounts.Get gardening.Almost all Okinawan centenarians grow or once grew a garden. It’s a source ofdaily physical activity that exercises the body with a wide range of motion andhelps reduce stress. It’s also a near-constant source of fresh vegetables.Eat more soy.The Okinawan diet is rich foods made with soy, like tofu and miso soup.Flavonoids in tofu may help protect the hearts and guard against breast cancer.Fermented soy foods contribute to a healthy intestinal ecology and offer evenbetter nutritional benefits.Maintain a moai.The Okinawan tradition of forming a moai provides secure social networks. Thesesafety nets lend financial and emotional support in times of need and give allof their members the stress-shedding security of knowing that there is alwayssomeone there for them.Enjoy the sunshine.Vitamin D, produced by the body when it’s exposed on a regular basis tosunlight, promotes stronger bones and healthier bodies. Spending time outsideeach day allows even senior Okinawans to have optimal vitamin D levelsyear-round.Stay active.Older Okinawans are active walkers and gardeners. The Okinawan household hasvery little furniture; residents take meals and relax sitting on tatami mats onthe floor. The fact that old people get up and down off the floor several dozentimes daily builds lower body strength and balance, which help protect againstdangerous falls.Plant a medicinal garden.Mugwort, ginger, and turmeric are all staples of an Okinawan garden, and allhave proven medicinal qualities. By consuming these every day, Okinawans may beprotecting themselves against illness.Have an attitude.A hardship-tempered attitude has endowed Okinawans with an affable smugness.They’re able to let their difficult early years remain in the past while theyenjoy today’s simple pleasures. They’ve learned to be likable and to keepyounger people in their company well into their old age.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"4AN AMERICAN BLUE ZONE"},{"pageContent":"AN AMERICAN BLUE ZONEThe Longevity Oasis in Southern CaliforniaMARGE JETTON BARRELED DOWN THE San Bernardino Freeway in her rootbeer-coloredCadillac Seville. Peering from behind dark sunshades, her head barely clearedthe steering wheel. She was late for one of the several volunteer commitmentsshe had that day, and she calmly but firmly goosed the Caddy’s throttle to moveit along.It was early on a Friday morning, and Marge had already accomplished quite alot. She had walked a mile, lifted weights, and eaten her oatmeal breakfast. “Idon’t know why God gave me the privilege of living so long,” she said, pointingto herself. “But look what he did!”Marge, born September 29, 1904, is one of some 9,000 Seventh-day Adventists wholive in and around Loma Linda, California, 60 miles east of Los Angeles. For thepast half century, members of this community, whose faith endorses healthyliving, have participated in a groundbreaking health and dietary study ofCalifornians over the age of 25. The results of this study hold promising cluesto another remarkable fact about these Adventists: As a group they currentlylead the nation in longest life expectancy.Marge Jetton, I decided, was the Adventist poster girl. She had sucked me intothe whirlwind of her 100-year-old orbit an hour earlier at the Plaza Place hairsalon just outside of Loma Linda. For the past 20 years, Marge has kept an 8a.m. Friday appointment with stylist Barbara Miller.“You’re late!” Marge shouted as I burst through the door at 8:25. She’d beenflipping through a copy of Reader’s Digest as Barbara uncurled the bluish-whitelocks of hair that now dovetailed around Marge’s head like a small cumuluscloud. Behind Marge, a line of stylists coifed hair on other ancient noggins.“We’re a bunch of dinosaurs around here,” Barbara whispered to me.“You may be,” Marge shot back. “Not me.”Half an hour later, Marge led me to her car. She didn’t walk, quite, but scootedwith a snappy, can-do shuffle.“Get in,” she ordered. “You can help.”The mission: Deliver recyclable bottles to a woman on welfare who will laterredeem them for deposits. But first we hopped on the freeway and drove to theLoma Linda adult services center, an activity center for seniors, most of whomare several decades younger than Marge. She popped open her trunk and heaved outfour bundles of magazines she’d collected during the week.“The old folks here like to read them and cut out the pictures for crafts,”Marge explained.Old folks?ISLAND IN THE BIG CITYDespite its location in the smoggy orbit of greater Los Angeles, Loma Lindaappears to be one of the few places in the United States where a true Blue Zonehas taken root. Adventists like Marge Jetton follow a faith that expresslydiscourages smoking, alcohol consumption, or eating foods deemed to be uncleanin the Bible, such as pork. In fact, the religion discourages the consumption ofmeat in general, as well as rich foods, caffeinated drinks, and even“stimulating” condiments and spices.Some of the most conservative Adventists don’t believe in going to the movies orthe theater or indulging in any other form of popular culture. All of thesetenets seem to have helped turn Loma Linda into a longevity oasis right in themiddle of America’s second largest city.Driving to America’s Blue Zone from Los Angeles International Airport was aclassic California freeway experience. As I sped along in my lane no more than afoot or two from vehicles on either side, I felt as if the road itself waspropelling us along. Looking at the brownish-yellow air draped over themountains beyond the strip malls, it wasn’t hard to figure out where all theexhaust was settling. When I took the Anderson Street exit for Loma Linda, Ipassed a smorgasbord of fast-food franchises all fighting for attention. Couldthis really be the doorstep to an American Blue Zone?After just a half mile of steadily climbing up the road (Loma Linda is Spanishfor “lovely hill”), I found myself surrounded by the manicured lawns, parkinglots, and large buildings of the Loma Linda University and Medical Center(LLUMC). Privately owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, andfounded in 1905, LLUMC is a modern facility with a proud tradition of service. Iknew that physicians at the medical center had played key roles in the AdventistHealth Study and had collected a wealth of data on Adventist behaviors.Julie Smith, LLUMC’s director of public and media relations, took me on a quicktour, starting on the roof of the medical center where a pair of busy helicopterpads serves the only Level 1 trauma center in the area. In the basement of theChildren’s Hospital Pavilion, the world’s first hospital-based proton radiationtreatment system treats about 160 patients five days a week (many for brain orprostate cancer) and provides research for NASA scientists. Down the hall is awall covered with pictures of happy, healthy children. Through the pioneeringwork of Dr. Leonard Bailey, a few hundred of the United States’ infant hearttransplants have occurred at LLUMC. The photographic display is a montage ofsurvivors, including a strapping young man in his early twenties who was theworld’s first successful infant-to-infant heart transplant recipient in 1985.After the tour, I made a long trek through the courtyard to a far corner of thecampus. There I found a side entrance to Evans Hall, a building that once housedunassuming classrooms for medical and dental students and now housed theuniversity’s Center for Health Promotion. The stairs under the frayed carpetcreaked and moaned as I made my way to the second floor offices of Dr. GaryFraser and Dr. Terry Butler.As soon as the introductions were made, Dr. Butler asked me if I’d like a drink.Since it was a hot day, I said yes, imagining a cold soda or iced tea. Butlerdrew me a glass of room-temperature water from a large jug on his desk. Morethan a gesture of hospitality, this act was Butler’s way of practicing what hepreaches—and he and Fraser had shelves full of data to buttress their dietarymessage.When LLU researchers first embarked on a study of the dietary habits of nearly25,000 Adventists in California a half century ago, it was good news to theAmerican Cancer Society, which had just initiated its own study of the effectsof tobacco smoke on lung cancer. Because the overwhelming majority of Adventistswere nonsmokers, they provided an ideal control group, and they were promptlyfolded into the ACS study.As we now would expect, the subsequent data (collected from 1958–1966) revealedthat Adventists contracted lung cancer at a rate of only 21 percent of that ofthe original ACS group. But what caught even early anti-smoking advocatesoffguard was that the Adventists also had a much lower incidence of othercancers, as well as less heart disease and diabetes. Even when compared tononsmokers in the original ACS group, the Adventists produced generallyhealthier outcomes.The results were intriguing. If the Adventists had created a longevity culture,was it possible to determine which of their dietary and lifestyle behaviors wasmost responsible for it? That was the thrust behind what became known as theAdventist Health Study-1 (AHS-1), a survey funded by the National Institutes ofHealth that examined nearly 34,000 California Adventists over age 25 from1974–1988.Dr. Fraser came to LLU to teach medicine and epidemiology in 1979, shortly afterAHS-1 was initiated. Since 1987 he has been the principal investigator of theAdventist Health Study projects. (A second version, AHS-2, began gathering dataon 97,000 Adventists in 2002 and will start reporting results in the next yearor two.) A slim man with a precise manner, he is frequently asked to sit onpanels that review grant proposals for other NIH studies.Born and raised in New Zealand, he started out as a cardiologist, an endeavor hedescribes as “seeing people who after 40 or 50 years of not taking care of theirbodies were reaping the results. It was like trying to close the door to thebarn after the horse has bolted—very frustrating. When I discovered I was verygood at math,” he continued, “I decided to become an epidemiologist and see if Icould help ward off heart disease on the front end, which is much moresatisfying.” His coinvestigator, Dr. Terry Butler, is an Adventist pastor aswell as an epidemiologist. Fraser credits him with helping to stimulate highlevels of Adventist participation in the AHS studies.“There are a lot of things in AHS-1 to hang our hats on,” Fraser said with aprominent down-under accent. “First, we can say with certainty that Adventistslive longer.” In California, the study showed, a 30-year-old Adventist malelives 7.3 years longer than the average 30-year-old white Californian male. A30-year-old Adventist female lives 4.4 years longer than the average 30-year-oldCalifornian white female. “If you go to Adventists who are vegetarian,” saidFraser, “it becomes 9.5 years longer for men and 6.1 years longer for women. Itis not surprising why this is so. About two-thirds of people either die of heartdisease or cancer, and the Adventists do a number of things to protectthemselves from heart disease and different cancers.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LOMA LINDA FACTS * Nation: United States of America * Location: Southern California, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles * Loma Linda Population: ca 21,000 people--------------------------------------------------------------------------------One of the key discoveries of the AHS-1 survey was that approximately half ofthe Adventists were vegetarians or rarely ate meat, which gave Fraser and Butlera solid demographic foundation to look at the advantages of a plant-based diet.“We learned that nonvegetarian Adventists had about twice the risk of heartdisease as vegetarian Adventists,” Fraser said, “particularly men but alsoyounger and middle-aged women.”Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, that finding was relativelycontroversial. “It didn’t automatically mean that meat did the damage by itself,so we dug deeper,” Fraser said. “But meat remained a consistent contributor toheart disease, which isn’t that surprising, because it has a high level ofsaturated fat. So out of that we started asking questions about other fattyfoods, and one of the ones we focused on was nuts.”At the time, clinical nutritionists were telling people to stay away from allfatty foods and snack foods, including nuts. “But,” Fraser said, cleaving theair with both palms for emphasis, “it turns out that most of the fat in nuts isunsaturated fat. And when we looked at that data, it was really so clear: TheAdventists who consumed nuts at least five times a week had about half the riskof heart disease of those who didn’t. This was true of men, women, vegetarian,nonvegetarian—we split the population up about 16 or 17 different ways and eachtime asked the question, ‘Does nut consumption matter?’ And every time we sawthat it did.”Since their findings were published in 1992, at least four major studies haveconfirmed that eating nuts has an effect. The American Heart Association has apositive recommendation about nuts. “So now everybody’s asking, what is it aboutnuts?” Fraser said. “I’m not sure we have all the answers, but one thingcertainly is that they have an effect on lower blood cholesterol.”“What about nuts that are roasted in oil?” I asked, glancing quickly behindButler to see if there’s a bag of cashews or almonds beside his jug of water.“Doesn’t matter,” Fraser replied. “Nuts have hard, thin skin, so that doesn’thave much impact.”“Now when you talk about AHS-1 and cancer, it gets a little more controversial,”he cautioned. “Because, despite hundreds of studies and huge amounts of press,what epidemiologists know with certainty about diet and cancer can be stated ina single paragraph. And that would say that consuming fruits and vegetables andwhole grains seems to be protective for a wide variety of cancers.”AHS-1 was one of the first studies to really demonstrate that, Butler added.“But exactly which fruits and vegetables and how protective they are with whichcancers is hard to say with certainty, although we have some very interestingdata. For example, we found that women who consumed tomatoes at least three orfour times a week reduced their chances of getting ovarian cancer by 70 percentover those who ate tomatoes less often. Something like that gives you prettygood evidence that there is protection, but because of our limited sample size,knowing the degree of protection may be more up for grabs. Eating a lot oftomatoes also seemed to have an effect on reducing prostate cancer for men.”“Colon cancer also,” Fraser said. “We found that the Adventists who ate meat hada 65 percent increased risk of it compared to the vegetarian Adventists. AndAdventists who ate more legumes like peas and beans had a 30 to 40 percentreduction in colon cancer.”For pancreatic cancer there was again a small sample size, but researchers didsee that those who ate fruits and legumes had a much lower risk. “Those who atemeat were at twice the risk of getting bladder cancer and a 65 percent increasein the risk of getting ovarian cancer,” Fraser said.“For lung cancer, we found an extensive relationship with smoking, which is nosurprise, although most Adventists are past smokers if they smoked at all. Wenaturally have a large percentage of Adventists who never smoked, and when welooked at them, the ones who ate two or more servings of fruit per day had about70 percent fewer lung cancers than those nonsmokers who ate fruit only once ortwice a week.”“Tell him about water,” Butler prompted.“Right,” Fraser said. “My personal view is that this is a potentially veryinteresting—although overall still tentative—finding. But if you look at theAHS-1 data, it is very clear that men who drank five or six glasses of water aday had a substantial reduction in the risk of a fatal heart attack—60, 70percent less—compared to those who drank considerably less water. The differencefor women hasn’t been seen as much. Yet if you looked at drinking nonwaterfluids, consuming a lot of soft drinks, coffee, cocoa, seemed to be hazardousand increased the risk of attack. Imagine if you could really make a sizabledent in heart attack rates just by increasing the number of glasses of water youdrink! That would be a major public health finding.”Fraser stared into his lap for a moment and pursed his lips. “For whateverreason, people just aren’t looking into this,” he said simply. “But we arelooking at it again with AHS-2, and with 97,000 people, we should find it muchmore strongly if it is real. If it is proven again, it is huge for publichealth.”He grabbed his glass and offered a toast. “I’ll tell you this: As a result ofwhat I’ve seen, I make sure I drink five or six glasses of water a day.”BENEFITS OF A LIFESTYLESo what were the key Blue Zone lessons about longevity from the Adventiststudies? Fraser and Butler listed five things we can do to add as much as anextra decade to our lives.“First, vegetarian status will get you about two years,” Fraser said. “Noteating meat is clearly important, and our studies have shown us it is because itseems to have an impact on heart disease and some cancers.“Second, we found that nut eaters also had a two-year advantage, which seemed torelate largely to heart disease. Of course there are causes of death not relatedto cancer and heart disease, and we suspect some of these behaviors might alsobe protective for some of those causes.”“Third is being a smoker,” added Fraser. “Or even a past smoker, as we foundamong the Adventists. If you have ever been a smoker, it has a moderately strongimpact on lung cancer and some impact on heart disease.”“Fourth is physical activity,” he continued, “which again accounted for an extracouple of years, and that seems to run very clearly to heart disease and tocertain cancers like breast and colon cancer. The evidence is fairly clear thatmost of this benefit comes from modest but regular physical activity. It reallyflattens out once you get to the marathoner level, which is not necessary forlongevity.”The fifth and final recommendation is to maintain a fairly normal body weight,an increasingly important issue in the United States. “It turns out a lot of thevery active chemicals that relate to inflammation probably have some impact onincreasing the likelihood of cancer developing,” Fraser said. “Those chemicalscould well come from fat cells. One huge advantage of a vegetarian diet is howmuch it is associated with lower body weight. In fact we just cracked somenumbers from AHS-2 that show that Adventists who are what we call lacto-ovovegetarians, meaning they eat eggs and other dairy products, still are anaverage of 16 pounds lighter than Adventists of the same height who arenonvegetarian. And Adventists who are strictly vegan, which is only 4 percent,are 30 to 32 pounds lighter than nonvegetarian Adventists of the same height.That has a huge impact on cardiovascular disease, on blood pressure, on bloodcholesterol, on inflammation related to hormones and the way it stimulates cellsin the body.”I noted with a pang of regret that my nonvegetarian body was starving and couldalso still use a shot of caffeine. I drained my second glass of water, hopingthat one of these good gentlemen would break out the nuts. But Fraser wasn’tquite finished. “If I could stress just one point to you, it would be this,” hesaid. “The Adventist experience, or lifestyle, we are studying doesn’t have tobe that unique. In many, many ways they are fairly typical Americans. I thinkthe most exciting thing about our results is that even with modest changes thereis no reason why non-Adventists can’t benefit from these things in the sameway.”GENESIS OF THE ADVENTIST WAYDirectly across from the hospital is the Loma Linda Market, as large as mostnational chain grocery stores but stocked with soy “beef jerky,” egg-free icecream, and more than 80 bins of various seeds and nuts. Lest you think this isan anomaly or the sole epicenter for the health food crowd, about a mile away isClark’s Nutrition Center, another supermarket-sized outlet for organic foods andsupplements. One entire wall at Clark’s is devoted to gluten-free nourishment.Another aisle contains huge, 50-pound bags of organic carrots, andcoffee-table-sized flats of organic wheatgrass that could be mistaken forminiature lawn plots. And everywhere you look there are nuts: showcased inplastic-sealed gift boxes; in heaping piles beside the onions and potatoes inthe produce section; and sorted—raw cashews, dried pistachios, honey-roastedalmonds, yogurt-dipped peanuts, shelled and unshelled walnuts—in dozens anddozens of hanging bins that can be emptied into flask-sized paper bags with thepull of a lever.Most of us have the best intentions of getting more exercise or eating morenutritiously. But religion has provided Adventists with the extra nudge thatseems crucial for turning intentions into habits. We’ve all heard the phrase,“Cleanliness is next to Godliness.” For Adventists, healthiness is next toGodliness.“Being healthy has always been a fundamental part of the Adventist message,”said Dr. Daniel Giang, vice president for medical administration at LLUMC. I metGiang in a spacious conference room in the Chan Shun Pavilion. “Maybe it’sbecause I grew up in Takoma Park, Maryland, which is one of the worldheadquarters of the Adventists, but I’ve always been very interested in thehistory of our church, which is really fascinating when it comes to health,” hesaid. An amiable man of Chinese-American ancestry, Giang was both enthusiasticand easygoing as he sketched out the Adventist story.“I think most Adventists, especially if they grew up in the 1950s and 60s, thinkthe church was formed simply because God spoke to Ellen G. White and she wrotedown what He said,” Giang told me. “But if you go and read the history, theearly Adventists said there was a lot of hammering things out as the church wasbeing formed in the 1840s, 1850s, and 1860s, with Ellen White being influentialin saying whether people were on the right track or the wrong track,” he said.That was especially true of the period between 1844, when White had her firstvision from God, and 1863, when the Adventist Church was officially organized.“Along with Ellen G. White, there were two people crucial to the way the churchwas formed. One was James White, Ellen’s husband, who provided theadministrative genius and ran a publishing company. The other major figure wasJoseph Bates, a very successful sea captain and intellectual who introduced thiswhole health emphasis,” Giang said. “Long before it became a part of theAdventist religion, Bates had decided to give up smoking, alcohol, and consumingany meat, coffee, tea, or spices. Imagine: As far back as the 1820s, Bates ran atemperance ship; he wouldn’t allow his crew to drink on a voyage across theocean.”Bates was much older than the other early church leaders, yet he was the onlyone who stayed healthy, Giang continued. “There’s actually a picture from the1860s of all these church leaders in their twenties who were sick in hospitalsand sanitaria, and the guy running the show is this sea captain in his sixties,which back then was really old.”James White had a series of strokes in his 30s and 40s. Ellen G. White took himto a sanatorium, or “water-cure place,” and helped him rehabilitate throughphysical therapy baths and massages and walking. Then she had this propheticvision that the body is important. “Adventists believe in the body and soul asone,” Giang said, “that when you die there isn’t a conscious soul floatingaround, but that you are lying in an unconscious state and God will resurrectyou later upon the return of Christ. We truly believe that the body is thetemple of the Holy Spirit, and that God communicates to us through our bodies.So the things you do to impair your thinking and impair your health are cuttingyou off from God’s revelation.”image [Images/161.jpg]Ellen G. White was one of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WATER NEEDSAbout 60 percent of your body’s total weight is water. According to the MayoClinic, it takes an average of 8 cups of water (along with a healthy diet) toreplace what your body uses normally every day. Moderate exercise increases theamount by 1 to 2 cups. Strenuous exercise (lasting an hour or more) ups theaverage intake by 2 to 3 cups per hour exercised.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Many of the ideas Bates adopted were thus based on health reasons as well asreligious ones, and a number of them became centerpieces for Adventistpractices, Giang explained. Many focused on preventative medicine. “Whatstrengthened this health message, of course, was that it seemed to work. Godwants us to be healthy, and if we did these things, people were healthier.”The Adventists’ affinity for health and longevity didn’t stop at personal dietand exercise. A respectful emphasis on medical science also became a part oftheir religious outlook, in part because of their low tolerance for frivolityand their realization that it provided opportunities to evangelize their faith.As much as Ellen G. White and other church leaders embraced the healing done at“water-cure” spas and sanitaria, they frowned upon the dancing and card playingthat frequently took place at such facilities and decided to provide a morestraitlaced, Adventist alternative.In 1866, a hydrotherapy clinic known as the Western Health Reform Institute wasfounded in Battle Creek, Michigan. After doing sluggish business during itsearly years of operation, White determined that the place needed a crediblemedical professional, and chose the smartest young prodigy from a staunchAdventist family she could find, sending him off to medical school at thechurch’s expense. The young man’s name was John Harvey Kellogg.When Kellogg returned to Battle Creek in 1876, he shifted the focus of theinstitute from water cures to a mixture of Adventist-oriented preventativemedicine based on a combination of diet and exercise and cutting-edge medicaland surgical procedures. He also changed the name of the place to Battle CreekSanitarium (a clever variant on sanatorium, the common word for water-curefacilities at the time), which, as business boomed over the next few decades,became known as the San.Kellogg was a tireless, somewhat eccentric innovator who authored nearly 50books and was eventually credited with inventing everything from granola andcorn flakes to electric blankets and a mechanical horse for exercise—and perhapspeanut butter, which he certainly refined and popularized if not outrightoriginated. By 1888 the rich and famous were making the pilgrimage to the San,which had expanded its dorms and treatment facilities to accommodate more than600 patients at a time.Kellogg also had started sanitariums in other places, which perpetuated a demandfor more trained people, Giang said. “But again, he and Ellen G. White realizedthat the worldly medical schools might not offer the same mix of preventativeAdventist medicine with traditional therapeutic practices, so he started theAmerican Medical Missionary College in Chicago in 1895.” By the end of thecentury, the Adventists had their own medical and nursing schools. They had alsodiscovered that medical missions could be very effective at reaching people theymight not otherwise reach, who weren’t necessarily interested in the theology.And it was consistent with the church message of compassion.Soon, when they went on missions to China or to other countries, they sentmedical professionals to perform curative and restorative medicine as well aspreachers to teach theology and preventative medicine. “The term Ellen Whiteused was ‘the right arm of the church.’ That was her phrase for the healthmessage,” Giang said. “I think what she meant was that this right arm couldreach across cultures and shake hands and open doors. And it also became a goodway for paying the bills.”Later Kellogg grew skeptical of White’s visions and teachings and was eventuallyexcommunicated from the Adventist Church. He continued to operate the San, whichin the early 20th century counted some celebrities among its clientele—includingAmelia Earhart, Sarah Bernhardt, Thomas Edison, and President William HowardTaft. While experimenting with shredded wheat cereal, Kellogg and his brother,W. K. Kellogg, accidentally discovered the process for creating flaked cereal.W. K. formed the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company in 1906. Kellogg wasalso convinced by his younger brother Will to market his new breakfast foods inwhat became the wildly successful Kellogg Company, still one of the largestemployers in Battle Creek. He died in 1943 at the age of 91.Ellen G. White, meanwhile, decided to close the Adventist-sponsored medicalschool in Battle Creek and open another one, to be named the Loma Linda Collegeof Medical Evangelists. CME eventually changed its name to Loma LindaUniversity.A LITTLE EXERCISE TO STAY YOUNGMarge Jetton always wanted to be a nurse. “I was working in a cannery when thepreacher came and saw me,” she said. “He told me, ‘Margie, you know you want tobe a missionary, and I’ll take care of it for you.’ Well, that changed my life.I had dreamed of becoming a nurse since I was a little girl, and this was mychance. I feel God arranged for me to get my way.”We sat in Marge’s cozy apartment at the Linda Valley Villa, and she kept her endof a bargain we’d made: If I helped on her volunteer rounds about town, she’dtell me her life story.Marge had been in high gear since 4:30 in the morning. After getting dressed,she did what she called “my devotions,” reading lyrics in the song hymnal, andthen the Bible. “Every morning,” she said, “because who is my friend?” Shesmiled, then answered her own question. “If you don’t have Him, you’re out ofluck.”After prayers and reflection, it was power-walking time. Marge’s cornerapartment was in the independent-living facility. If she made her customarybeeline down the hallway to the other end of the building and back six times, itworked out to a mile. “I circle through the dining room and get a glass of watereach time; six glasses of water before breakfast. Then I come back and get myface on, make the bed, clean up the bedroom, and go to breakfast,” she said.Most mornings, she eats oatmeal, but since the Adventists operate Linda ValleyVilla, the cafeteria has no shortage of healthy options.image [Images/166.jpg]Marge Jetton, 100, begins every day with a mile walk, a stationary bicycle ride,and some weight lifting. “I’m for anything that has to do with health,” saysJetton.“I can have whatever I want,” said Marge. “There isn’t anything you can eat thatcan’t be made out of something healthy. My daughter just sent me some wafflesmade out of soy and garbanzo beans. Mostly I just eat the oatmeal in themorning, and then make up a nice raw fruit and vegetable salad for later in theday.”After breakfast, Marge came back to her room to reflect on the Lord and Hisblessings. Then she did her exercises. “Today I knew you were coming so I savedsome for you,” she said. “Let’s go.”Marge hit the carpet with both feet before the words left her mouth and led meout the door and down the hallway (past the big, framed poster celebrating her100th birthday, adorned with dozens of signatures and well wishes) and into theelevator to the basement.“This is our laundry and exercise area,” she said, shooting her left arm out inthe direction of the washers and dryers as she wended her way through rows ofchairs made festive by brightly colored, patterned ties hanging from the armrestof each chair—props for sitting isometric exercises.She hopped on the lone exercise bicycle, quickly adjusted the resistance with aspin of the thumb and forefinger, and started churning.“I ride between six and eight miles a day, except for the Sabbath,” she saidover the whirring bike. “But yesterday I only rode five because another girl wasin a hurry and wanted to get on, so I’ll go a little longer today. I set thetimer for 15 minutes and try and keep the speed between 25 and 30 miles anhour.” She glanced down, saw the speedometer hovering between 20 and 25, andpicked up her pace. Then she looked over at me expectantly and nodded at my taperecorder. She began to recount her life story almost nonchalantly, withoutgasping, never letting up on the pedals.She grew up poor in what was then rural California, close enough to SanFrancisco to have a vague memory of water sloshing around in the family animaltrough during the great 1906 earthquake. Her father was a mule skinner. Hermother converted to Adventism when Marge was 9 months old, so Marge rarely atemeat and hadn’t now for more than 50 years. “My father was a fun man; he’d laughand pull jokes on us and torment my mother. I’m like him a little bit. I alwayswanted to do things for people. When I was a little girl I used to tell mymother to go to bed so I could bring her things. I waited on tables when I was14, and then I worked in a fruit cannery to help the family, but I knew I had tostay in school to become a nurse. My father died of pneumonia before Igraduated, but I knew he was proud of me.”Marge met her husband while she was at nursing school in Napa Valley. “He was 16and I was 18 and he followed me around for three years, if you can call thatcourting. I told him, ‘I’m not going to marry anyone until I’m an RN.’ But afterthat happened, I told him, ‘If you really want to be a doctor, we’ll get marriedand I’ll support you.’” And she did, through two years of college and then fourmore of medical school. When her husband was called to serve in World War II fornearly five years, she stayed at home with two small children. (“My children areboth 72 now—a son and a daughter we adopted when she was three. I had a hardtime having one child and wanted another,” she said.)For 30 years, they lived in Bellflower, California, where her husband was asurgeon and she was a nurse. In accordance with Adventist philosophy, theyvolunteered together for two international missions, spending three months eachin Ethiopia and Zambia.Always ready to tackle new things, Marge began riding a bicycle at age 12 on adare from her father, who called her too fat, and she’s never stopped pedaling.She took up golf at age 40 and played for decades. At 90, she decided to go toDisneyland and sit in “one of those rides that swirl you around.” When she was96, she finally decided she was tired of cooking and cleaning and moved with herhusband into Linda Valley Villa. One day in August of 2003, she returned totheir apartment after carrying his food tray back to the cafeteria and he waslying on the floor. “He said, ‘I hit my head,’ and then his arms went…[Margeslumped her shoulders], and he was gone.” It was two days before their 77thanniversary.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------NUTS FOR NUTSLooking for a way to get a daily serving of nuts? Add toasted whole walnuts orpecans to a green salad. Try roasted cashews in a chicken salad. Finely choppednuts can also make a delicious coating for fish filets, but popping them rightin your mouth works, too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CONVERTING STRANGERS TO FRIENDS“It took me a year to realize that the world wasn’t going to come to me,” Margesaid. “That’s when I started volunteering again, and it was the best thing toever happen to me. I found that when you are depressed, that’s when you dosomething for somebody else. There, that’s eight miles,” she said, abruptlychanging her mood and the subject. “See what you can do on this bike—one of thegirls here taught me this.” She cackled, suddenly pedaling furiously in theother direction. “It uses a whole different set of muscles.”“I can’t believe you aren’t the slightest bit winded,” I told her. “I would be.”“Really?” she answered, and in the space of a few seconds I saw three reactionsmove across her face: contempt that I’d let my body go, skepticism that I waspulling her leg, and then genuine concern that I was telling her the truth.“Well then, let’s get you going,” she announced, hopping off the bike and movingtoward a series of hand weights in the corner. “Pick up a pair of five-pounders;that’s what I’m using. Now go sit in that chair.” She demonstrated aneight-part, dual-hand, lift-and-stretch exercise as she counted it off, andbarked for me follow along. Then we started with twisting trunk contortions,followed by side-to-side stretches with the weights held over our heads. “I’vegot to go to the bathroom,” she said, after about ten brisk minutes. “Why don’tyou take a little ride on that bike while I’m gone?” Although I can’t be sure, Ithink I heard her linger an extra minute or two out of sight in the basementhall while I dutifully pedaled.“All that water,” she said by way of explanation as she returned. “C’mon, I wantto show you our garden.” On the way up, I asked if she ever got lonely. “Well,sure, you miss people. Most of my friends have died. My husband is dead,” shesaid matter-of-factly. “But I just like to talk to people. My motto is: Astranger is a friend we haven’t met yet. I don’t know a lot of non-Adventists. Idon’t go to movies or dances. But I still have a lot of friends around thisplace and other places in town. I think I was probably shyer when I was younger.There are days when my forgetter is working overtime. I remember just as manythings as I did before, but after a hundred years or more, I have so many thingsin my computer I don’t know what button to push.” She walked off the elevatorlaughing at herself.“Look at this: I have an ear of corn! This is the first time I have ever growncorn,” she said, as we walked in the courtyard. Plants, flowers, and vegetableswere growing in long rows against all three walls of the fence that squared offthe yard from the main building. “These are my tomatoes—oh, look, I’ve got aripe one! See that hydrangea over there? When I first came here, there were someas tall as me. Then somebody cut ‘em down, and now they are growing back.”Some people walked by and Marge waited until they were out of earshot, thensaid, “There are some folks in here who are 80 years old. I was out stillworking when I was 80. I tell them, ‘I’m old enough to be your mother!’”“Ahh, the roses,” she gushed, leaning forward into a brilliant red trio of them.“I can’t look at a rose without thinking of Jesus. When I was a girl, we used togo on long family walks on the Sabbath and look at all the wildflowers. It wassuch a special time. And the Sabbath still is special you know,” she said,finally stepping back from the flower. “It is a time to come apart from thethings of the world. It is something to look forward to. You get to go on hikes,stop pushing. I don’t know how to describe it to you. I think the Sabbath givesyou peace, and that contributes to your health.”A few minutes later, it was time for me to go. When I complimented Marge on herfirm handshake bidding me adieu, she replied, “I’m a strong woman. That comesfrom all the massages I have given in my life. Say, you need to remember to sendme what you write. People come and talk to me because I’m old, and that’s thelast I hear from them. They probably think I’m going to die, or have alreadydied. But I’m still here.”SANCTUARY IN TIMEInspired by Marge’s pep talk about the Sabbath, I decided to attend an Adventistservice at the church on the Loma Linda University campus. Adventists observethe Sabbath from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. The number ofAdventists in Loma Linda is high enough to warrant that postal carriers delivermail only from Sunday through Friday.At first, the tenor and content of the service itself didn’t seem so different.As in many “mega-churches,” video cameras swung over the pews on boom cranes,their images shown on large screens over the stage as well as being broadcast toviewers at home. Hymns were sung. A sermon was delivered. The collection platewas passed. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for—signs of why this faithpromotes a longevity culture, I guess—but I wasn’t finding it.After the service, the hundreds in attendance seemed to hang around longer thanusual, and in larger groups. It was the social equivalent of comfort food. Onecluster of eight to ten young people, a diverse mix of race and gender but allbetween their teens and their thirties, had locked arms and were standing aroundthe Good Samaritan sculpture near a side entrance of the church. More than halfof them were chanting the biblical parable cited on the plaque of the sculpture,from Luke 10: 25-37. The passage is about helping the downtrodden.But what was striking was not the message, so much as the variety ofexpressions. One student was reading from a Bible; another had her eyes shut andwas reciting it from memory; two others were only occasionally chiming in, andmostly doing can-can kicks in clownish, spontaneous choreography. It was an adhoc, perhaps fleeting community, and everyone seemed happy. It reminded me ofwhat Marge Jetton had told me about why she volunteered so much: “Because itmakes me feel good,” she’d said. “Don’t you like to help people up when theyneed a hand?”Randy Roberts, the pastor of Loma Linda University Church, told me more aboutthe spirit of the Sabbath and why he thinks it helps people live longer. “Ithink even for those who may slip away from the faith and from the AdventistChurch, observing the Sabbath remains a lingering reality, a way to stayconnected,” he said. “It is meant to be a sanctuary in time for rest andrejuvenation, and I think it accomplishes that on a number of levels.“Ellen White had this whole-health emphasis that you should use the time tovalue exercise, get out in nature, and move around. Another way it is healthy—Idon’t have any studies or hard numbers for this, just a lifetime of observing itmyself—is as a pure stress reliever that allows some peace to occur.”“I’ve heard over and over again from students in rigorous programs like medicineand dentistry, and from faculty too, that they can’t wait for the Sabbath tocome because they have a guilt-free time when they don’t have to study or dosome other obligation. They can just be with their family and friends and withGod, and just relax and rejuvenate. When you have that as a pattern in your life52 times a year, it can make a big difference. Some call it a ‘sanctuary intime.’ Another part of Adventist beliefs is that the Sabbath reminds us we arecreatures and not creators,” he said. “It reminds us that we don’t need to haveall the answers, that we recognize our finite capabilities, and that we aredependent on God. That also is part of the sanctuary.”Roberts said he’d seen studies showing that people with two or three significantties in their lives, to family and friends and community, tended to behealthier, both emotionally and physically. “The Sabbath gives most Adventists atime to do that: to shut off the television, not think about your work orbusiness, and just spend time with the people who are important to you.Unfortunately, this is becoming more unique. You used to see it more in otherfaiths that set aside Sunday—it would be like old Andy Griffith Show reruns.That doesn’t happen as often now. But it is still an important part of ourfaith.”OPEN-HEART SURGERY ON TUESDAYSIt was a hot, breezy afternoon on a rare, smog-free day in the San BernardinoValley when I dropped in on Dr. Ellsworth Wareham, who was hard at work in hisbackyard. From his property on Crestview Drive you can look out on the valley’smountains receding like brown waves, and when the air is as clear as it was thatday, you could even make out the shirt colors of people walking on the LLUMCcampus a mile and a half away.For all the sweat rolling into his eyes, however, Wareham couldn’t see much ofanything. When he wiped his brow with his forearm, it was as if he had used asqueegee to send water down the rest of his body, soaking his clothes. Hisshoulder muscles showed through his clinging T-shirt as he struggled tocorkscrew the post-hole digger through the packed soil. Recently, a contractorhad presented Wareham with an estimate of $5,000 to install an eight-foot-highwooden fence along a steep hillside on the edge of his property.By consulting his local discount hardware store, he had learned that the fencematerials would cost only about $2,000. So he decided to do the work himself.Thus far he’d sunk a couple of poles and sealed a couple of holes, but there wasan imposing pile of posts and fence sections left. There was also a potentiallysignificant complication: Ellsworth Wareham was in his 90s. He was born in 1914.Four days later, Wareham was in open-heart surgery at a community hospital onthe edge of Los Angeles. But he was not the one on the table. He had a scalpelin his hand.“I am a man of good fortune,” he said, when we next met for our first extensiveconversation. “My hands are still steady, my vision is good, and I don’t haveAlzheimer’s disease, which may occur in about 50 percent of the people my age.“Now, I want to make it clear that I am no longer the lead surgeon; I am eitherthe first or second assistant, and I do the minor parts of the operation. If Ihad to, I could step in and do the major parts—that’s one of the reasons I’m inthe room. But cardiac surgery is inclined to be long and sometimes quite taxing,lasting anywhere from three to six hours.“Sometimes I’ll go out and rest for a half hour, and that’s very refreshing. Toincrease my endurance I exercise regularly by doing my own landscape maintenanceand gardening. But in recent years, in spite of adequate exercise, my stamina isdecreasing. The hormones that build the muscles are diminished.image [Images/176.jpg]Dr. Ellsworth Wareham, 91, assists during a heart surgery procedure, somethinghe does about two to three times per week.“So yes, I am sensitive about my age,” he said. “If someone tells you theassistant on your heart surgery is in his 90s, well, that’s not a comfortablethought. But the way I see it, the cardiac surgeons who want me there to assistthem can judge my ability better than I can. And when I start to do less thantop-quality work, I trust them not to use me.” Eventually, he won’t renew hislicense, he added. “And a deficit in mental or physical ability may appear atany time and make the decision for me.”As I parked on the steep hill near his driveway, I spotted Wareham on his handsand knees, cleaning leaves out of the gutter in the road. Tall, thin, clad in ashort-sleeve red shirt and khakis, he greeted me with a firm handshake and aready smile. His face was framed by a mustache and hair that was balding in themiddle but thick on the sides. As we entered the house to the cacophony of threedogs (a mutt, a golden retriever, and a Chihuahua), Wareham’s wife was unpackingsuitcases from a trip to Canada to celebrate the centennial of tiny CanadianJunior College (now Canadian University College) in Lacombe, Alberta, where hegraduated from a two-year premedical course in 1933. Wareham had driven themhome from the airport last night.“I think it is important for me to keep active,” he said, gesturing for me totake a seat in his study. “People say, ‘Oh, I don’t drive at night.’ Well, Idrive over 2,000 miles a month on Southern California freeways, much of it atnight. I think it keeps me alert.” Through the double doors over his shoulderand past the patio, I noticed the long, regal, wooden fence in the backyard.The walls of Wareham’s study are laden with prestigious academic and honorarydegrees, along with photographs from his missions abroad. As a doctor in theNavy during World War II, he once took out an officer’s appendix on a destroyerbeing tossed around in a typhoon off the coast of Okinawa. Later, on a medicalmission to Pakistan sponsored by the U.S. State Department in 1963, he was asurgeon on the Loma Linda heart surgery team that brought open-heart surgery tothat country for the first time. He pointed to a photograph of a girl who, withher family, had walked 100 miles to get an operation. In Vietnam, a year beforeSouth Vietnam fell, the work of the heart surgery team in Saigon was featured onthe Walter Cronkite TV program.As a surgeon he was a pioneer of open-heart procedures. (Dr. Leonard Bailey, whohas performed more infant heart transplants than anyone in the world,unabashedly refers to Wareham as “my mentor.”) When rudimentary open-heartsurgery was first practiced in the early 1950s, Wareham saw the emergence of anew field and extended his residency to acquire the necessary expertise. Butwhat he saw on the operating table would have a profound effect on his ownhealth habits.“In the early days, when we used the heart-lung machine, we connected thearterial line to a cannula in the leg artery, later it would be straight intothe aorta,” he said. “But I observed when I was cutting into the thighs of thesepatients that those who were vegetarians had better arteries.”“When we did the surgery,” he continued, “if it was a nice, smooth artery, Iwent back later and asked the patient, and it turned out that he or she was avegetarian. And those who really had a lot of heavy calcium and plaque in thearteries, their diet would not be toward the vegetarian side. Now that wasn’ttrue 100 percent, and I didn’t keep any statistics or write any papers oranything; it was just something I observed. But I began thinking about it. And Isaw people getting their toes cut off or their feet cut off because of vasculardisease, and that motivated me. So it was a gradual thing.” In middle age, hedecided to become a vegan.“Now, I must admit, it is no problem for me to be a vegan,” Wareham said,leaning forward. “My mother was an Adventist, and my father was not. I grew upon a farm, and I milked the cows, and I never did care for milk. I don’tparticularly care for eggs either.”“For quite a few years, I read the concerns about vegans not getting enoughvitamin B12 or protein or calcium; you know how it goes,” he said. “They saideven the amino acids in vegetables were not adequate. But we began to find outthat much of these were old wives’ tales. With the exception of lack of B12being of some concern, you aren’t going to become deficient in protein and allthese things. I use soymilk, and as far as eggs are concerned, my wife knowssuitable substitutes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------EXERCISE TYPESA combination of four types of exercise will keep the body balanced and strong.Endurance: Activities like walking, hiking, swimming, and cycling improve thehealth of the cardiovascular system. Strength: Lifting weights builds up andmaintains muscles. Flexibility: Stretching keeps us limber and flexible.Balance: Practicing balance through activities like yoga will help avoid falls.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“My wife is not a vegetarian, but she is changing. Again, it is no credit to methat I am a vegan—I just love it. There are so many tasty fruits, vegetables,and nuts. This morning we had wonderful strawberries, for example.”The longer Wareham talks, the more apparent it became that he’s a walkingadvertisement for the Blue Zone lifestyle of the Adventists. “I am very fond ofnuts, all kinds of nuts,” he said happily. “I have to restrain myself. Most daysI eat two meals, first around ten in the morning and then again around four inthe afternoon, so I can keep my weight down. When I eat, I really enjoy it, andtwice a day is enough. Nuts are usually part of the menu. I know walnuts arereported to be very good for you, but I don’t eat them because I enjoy peanutsand cashews and almonds so much. Sometimes I get purist and think I should eatthem raw, but really, whatever is handy. I am not a nutritionist, and I don’tprofess to be.”Another thing that helps keep the weight off is drinking water, Wareham noted,as, almost in gentle rebuttal, his wife entered and gave us both a glass ofcranberry juice. “I became aware some years ago that water is highly importantto health, and I do make an effort to drink a lot of it. I’ll drink maybe threeglasses of water when I first get up, because I want to make sure before I getbusy and forget to have some. Then when I get home I have some more. And one ofmy little rituals is to never pass a water fountain without having a drink. Itadds up.”“But there is something else,” Wareham said, lowering his juice glass justbefore he was about to take a sip. “I know people that have had problems who arejust as careful in health habits as I am. There’s a colleague my age, who inaddition to his M.D. has a doctoral degree in public health from HarvardUniversity, and he has followed a good program—he walks, eats right. Now thisfellow has had cancer of the prostate and the neck, and two heart attacks, eachfollowed by heart surgery and bypass grafts. Why wasn’t he protected? Luck?Genes? Maybe stress. Remarkably, ten years after the last onslaught of thesediseases, he is alive and active. I would conjecture his good health habitshelped him recover. I know that it really helps me to have purpose to what I’mdoing, to have a job and finish the job and have another job, and to enjoy thatprocess. As I say, I am blessed.” But the tone was not totally content thistime. It was hard for me to tell whether Wareham was gloating, feeling guilty,or experiencing a little of both.“A few individuals relating anecdotes about their lifestyles and healthhistories do not prove anything. But the Adventist health study by Dr. Fraserand his coworkers is a highly significant work,” he said. “It examineslifestyles and health outcomes of more than 34,000 people over a period of 12years. The study should have serious consideration.”As we negotiated our way through the dogs and walked toward my car, Warehamclosed with his own little pep talk. “It is so simple just to get on a goodprogram. I don’t have great genes. I just try to observe broad principles thatanybody can pick up, and I still don’t take any blood pressure medication. Weare especially blessed out here in California, where there are so many goodthings to eat.”“People talk about curing cancer and heart disease, and of course it is animportant and worthy goal that can’t happen soon enough. But there are simplethings everyone could be doing right now that would save so much money andsuffering—like drinking enough water every day, exercise, and eating healthyfood. But hey,” Wareham said, suddenly catching himself in his fervor,“everybody has his own idea about these things—it’s their lives, after all. Youcan tell somebody what to do, but it’s up to them whether they do it. But youcan tell them how good you feel.”PART OF THE CLUBShortly after three on Friday afternoon, I visited the Mock family in Yucaipa, aburgeoning hillside town about seven miles east of Loma Linda. I was hoping tosee how a typical Adventist family observes the Sabbath to witness how it mightcontribute to a culture of longevity. When I knocked on the door of a large newsuburban home on a cul-de-sac, the door opened and I was met by threemales—Jesse Mock and his two sons, Justin, 15, and Austin, 13—who lookedremarkably alike, with lithe, athletic builds, full faces with toothy smiles,and thick, fair, curly hair. Jesse’s wife, Rhonda, greeted me from the kitchen,where she was getting dinner ready.Inside, the conversation flowed easily, as Jesse and Rhonda told me how they hadjust moved here a few months ago from Denver, Colorado, so Jesse could take ajob as a vice president at LLUMC. They’d lived in the area years ago, and werehappy to be back in an area with a robust church school program, which gave themoptions after a positive, six-year experience with home-schooling. (Adventistsbelieve in a parochial education and operate a large, church-sponsored schoolsystem in the United States.)The family was vegetarian, Jesse informed me, “But I think the boys have hadmeat before. Remember that birthday party, Justin?”“Yeah, I’ve had meat,” Justin said with a shy smile, and added, with a tone ofsurprise, “It wasn’t that bad.” Austin disagreed. “Uhhhh, I didn’t like it much.I don’t know. It just didn’t taste right.”The doorbell rang, and it turned out to be Dr. Daniel Giang, with whom I talkedearlier at LLUMC, and his wife and two children. His son and the two Mock boysdashed outside to play basketball, while his younger daughter stayed behind withthe adults. Again, the conversation flowed easily. The women caught up on thepast week, while Jesse and I took turns explaining how we knew Dr. Giang. Eversince they moved to Yucaipa, the Mocks have received helpful advice from theGiangs about local schools, recreational opportunities, and all the otheraspects of daily living in the community. That both Giangs are medical doctorsand both Mocks are not seemed less important than their common religion and thesimilar ages of their sons. After about 15 minutes, Jesse called in the boys,and the families sat around the living room to listen to a brief Bible passage.Then it was time to eat.image [Images/183.jpg]A shared family meal often begins the Seventh-day Adventists’ Sabbath.Everyone grabbed a plastic plate and loaded up in the kitchen before heading tothe dinner table. There were soy “chicken” salad sandwiches in small, not quitebite-sized buns, and a beautiful salad that included some of the largest, mostsucculent blackberries I’ve ever seen. I enjoyed the sandwiches much more than Iexpected, and was a little embarrassed to realize that some of it was thepresentation: The soy was served American style, slathered on a bun with somecelery for crunch, and perhaps some mayo for creamy richness. Among the dessertswas dried hibiscus, something Rhonda picked up on a lark, she said. It tastedcandied, like dried apricots or mangoes.The Giangs lingered a while after dinner, and the two couples gossiped about theuniversity and the Giangs’ daughter’s dance classes. There was also someintelligence sharing about which sports teams the sons should try to play for insummer.After the Giangs left, I was invited to accompany Justin and Austin to arehearsal, or jam session, with other youth members of the church the Mocksattend, as they prepared for a performance at the service the next morning.Austin’s drum set was loaded into the van. Jesse drove over with me, talkingmostly about college basketball and how the boys have adjusted to the move.The ten or so members of the youth band aren’t about to top the charts anytimesoon. But it was entertaining listening to the music director good-naturedlycajole slight refinements on two or three takes of a song, while his chargesalternately ignored or obeyed him with about equal results—especially with theparents gathered around the back of the garagelike rehearsal room. Two coltishgirls, close friends and tandem vocalists, spiced things up by acting out someof the lyrics. For Bill Withers’s “Lean On Me,” for example, they leaned againsteach other on the chorus and flexed their biceps on the line, “when you’re notstrong,” and cradled their arms for imaginary babies during, “I’ll help youcarry on.”So this was a slice of the Adventist Sabbath. If you’re not part of thecommunity, it might seem almost quaint. But for members of the community, thiskind of repetitious, casual intimacy provokes good memories and a subtle senseof safety and well-being—the same kind of constant, subtle reinforcement ofhealthy habits that seems to give Adventists a better chance for longer life.It’s no wonder that most Adventists seem to hang out with other Adventists.HOLD THE BACONI’m never going to be an Adventist. But you don’t have to convert to their faithto admire how they have generated a Blue Zone out of whole cloth by stickingtogether and reinforcing the right behaviors for longevity. Having spent morethan a week in Loma Linda, I’d met some amazing characters: Marge Jetton andEllsworth Wareham, of course, and more.Just down the hill from Ellsworth’s place was a rambler owned by Minnie Wood,who will turn 100 in May 2008. Minnie was a 1925 beauty contest winner and saidshe would have gone into acting had she not converted to Adventism. Yet she hadno regrets. “How many actors have gotten to perform in front of threepresidents?” she thundered, ticking off Truman, Eisenhower, and Nixon as thosewho heard the choirs she directed while living in Washington, D.C. Minnie taughtmusic while traveling with her husband in China and Singapore. She continued toteach some students, driving to their homes in her Oldsmobile, and could stillcarry a tune as long as she could synchronize the key on the piano. “I love whatI do. I always have. I wouldn’t do anything else.”There was Letha Graham, born in 1906, who lived in a home at the top of amountain ridge and rented out rooms to patients undergoing proton radiationtreatments at the medical center. Letha used to sell medical encyclopedias onhorseback in Alberta, Canada. In recent times she lived with her 94-year-oldsister, taking a daily walk around the house grounds, and pausing for a dip inthe Jacuzzi.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LOVE TO LAUGHStudies have found that a belly laugh a day may keep the doctor away. In 2005,researchers at the University of Maryland showed that laughter helped relaxblood vessels, linking it to healthier function and a possible decreased risk ofheart attack. Others have found that laughter may lower blood pressure andincrease the amount of disease-fighting cells found in the body.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just down the hall from Marge Jetton at Linda Valley Villa was 94-year-old Dr.Wayne McFarland, creator of the first—now famous and highly successful—five-dayanti-smoking plan. A wiry firecracker of a man, McFarland slapped things—hishands together, the back of a chair, your shoulder—for emphasis when he wasexcited. Remembering when he and Dunbar Smith were both staff physicians at theBattle Creek Sanitarium and Hospital conducting five-day plans to stop smoking,Wayne recalled finding two pamphlets, “More Nuts & Less Meat” and “The SimpleLife in a Nutshell” by Dr. Kellogg. Indeed, the apartment he shared with hiswife had numerous bowls filled with nuts. Later, McFarland took me out to thesame garden where Marge showed off her corn and tomatoes, and he slapped thecement wall with glee when he noticed how much his own tomatoes had ripened.Then there was Ethel Meilicke, 108, who lived in the nursing home part of LindaValley Villa. With a history remarkably similar to that of Marge Jetton, shegrew up on farms, worked in a cannery, and became a nurse as a young woman. WhenI visited, she was frail and hard of hearing, but when I asked what she enjoyedmost during her days on the dairy farm, she blurted out the word “shneckens,” aGerman pastry her daughter (now 80) said she always used to make. Ethel passedaway less than a month after my last visit to Loma Linda, on July 1, 2007.It still amazes me that Ethel Meilicke, Wayne McFarland, Minnie Wood, LethaGraham, Ellsworth Wareham, and Marge Jetton all lived within a three-mile radiusof one another, the youngest of them 93 (and still practicing open-heartsurgery). As I prepared to leave Loma Linda, I remembered something Dr. Fraserfrom the AHS had told me. “Some Adventists get personally offended if they getcolon cancer or some other disease,” he said. “They have a reputation foravoiding these things now, of course, but it begs the question, what do youexpect to die of? And when we looked, we found that, by and large, theproportions of deaths from different causes in Adventists are about the same aseverybody else. It is just that they die later.”What does that mean? Are Adventists hitting some kind of fundamental rate ofaging? “We see people get to age 98, or 103, or whatever, and as physicians weask, what did they die of?” Fraser said. “We see they were experiencing heartfailure, and their kidneys weren’t so good, and everything was slowlydeteriorating. So aging seems to be about deteriorating cellular function andmetabolism and so forth. And what I am saying is that with the Adventists italmost looks as if that general deterioration and cellular function may beimpacted by lifestyle. If so, that would be very interesting.”My last stop in Southern California was a pancake house. Tempting pictures ofmaple syrup slathered over sausage and pancakes adorned the menu. I was hungry,and the waitress had her pencil poised. “I’ll take the oatmeal with fruit,” Isaid. “And just water.” We’ll see how long that lasts.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LOMA LINDA’S BLUE ZONE SECRETSTry these tactics practiced by America’s longevity all-stars.Find a sanctuary in time.A weekly break from the rigors of daily life, the 24-hour Sabbath provides atime to focus on family, God, camaraderie, and nature. Adventists claim thisrelieves their stress, strengthens social networks, and provides consistentexercise.Maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI).Adventists with healthy BMIs (meaning they have an appropriate weight for theirheights) who keep active and eat meat sparingly, if at all, have lower bloodpressure, lower blood cholesterol, and less cardiovascular disease than heavierAmericans with higher BMIs.Get regular, moderate exercise.The Adventist Health Survey (AHS) shows that you don’t need to be a marathonerto maximize your life expectancy. Getting regular, low-intensity exercise likedaily walks appears to help reduce your chances of having heart disease andcertain cancers.Spend time with like-minded friends.Adventists tend to spend lots of time with other Adventists. They findwell-being by sharing values and supporting each other’s habits.Snack on nuts.Adventists who consume nuts at least five times a week have about half the riskof heart disease and live about two years longer than those who don’t. At leastfour major studies have confirmed that eating nuts has an impact on health andlife expectancy.Give something back.Like many faiths, the Seventh-day Adventist Church encourages and providesopportunities for its members to volunteer. People like centenarian Marge Jettonstay active, find sense of purpose, and stave off depression by focusing onhelping others.Eat meat in moderation.Many Adventists follow a vegetarian diet. The AHS shows that consuming fruitsand vegetables and whole grains seems to be protective against a wide variety ofcancers. For those who prefer to eat some meat, Adventists recommend smallportions served as a side dish rather than as the main meal.Eat an early, light dinner.“Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper,”American nutritionist Adelle Davis is said to have recommended—an attitude alsoreflected in Adventist practices. A light dinner early in the evening avoidsflooding the body with calories during the inactive parts of the day. It seemsto promote better sleep and a lower BMI.Put more plants in your diet.Nonsmoking Adventists who ate 2 or more servings of fruit per day had about 70percent fewer lung cancers than nonsmokers who ate fruit only once or twice aweek. Adventists who ate legumes such as peas and beans 3 times a week had a 30to 40 percent reduction in colon cancer. Adventist women who consumed tomatoesat least 3 or 4 times a week reduced their chance of getting ovarian cancer by70 percent over those who ate tomatoes less often. Eating a lot of tomatoes alsoseemed to have an effect on reducing prostate cancer for men.Drink plenty of water.The AHS suggests that men who drank 5 or 6 daily glasses of water had asubstantial reduction in the risk of a fatal heart attack—60 to 70percent—compared to those who drank considerably less.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"5DISCOVERING COSTA RICA’S BLUE ZONE"},{"pageContent":"DISCOVERING COSTA RICA’S BLUE ZONETortillas and Beans, Hard Work, and Something in the Water?IT WAS SEVEN IN THE MORNING IN THE village of Hojancha, Costa Rica, and alreadythe tropical sun was bearing down as I opened the squeaky front gate and calledinto the pastel-pink house for Tomás Castillo—Tommy to his friends.A moment later, Tommy emerged with his big, white-toothed grin, his brown pantstucked into his boots, a T-shirt, and his New York Yankees baseball cap pulleddown low over his forehead. “Listo? (Ready?)” he asked, with no intention ofwaiting for an answer. We mounted a pair of bikes and, with a truant’s delight,rolled out into the hot Costa Rican morning.Tommy leaned forward over his handlebars as we swooped down the street with thewind whistling past our ears and the blurred line of aqua, pink, and ocean-bluehouses swooshing by. We squeezed our hand brakes and slowed at the town square,where men at the Café Central eating their pico de gallo and eggs called out toTommy. He waved back, blushing. I wasn’t sure if he was proud or embarrassed tobe cycling with a six-foot-tall gringo. On the plaza corner, a pushcart vendorsqueezed fresh orange juice and sliced mango and papaya for the morning’scustomers. We turned right.Our route took us by the town clinic, past a mechanic where the rhythm of localcowboy music blared into the street from tinny speakers. We swooped down anotherhill past the village school, and from there, the houses thinned out. On oneside of road, buildings gave way to a wall of jungle. The road dipped to wherethe pavement bridged a creek and continued up a steep incline. Tommy stood uphard on his pedals and pulled ahead of me. I was breathing heavily. Sweattrickled down my back.We followed an unmarked dirt road into the forest. Our bike wheels tracedparallel ruts past a horse barn and a vegetable garden. The road stopped at aclearing with a raised chicken coop, a tin-roofed wooden house, and a woodshedstacked high with split logs. Out front, a woman wearing a bright pink dress,hoop earrings, and carnival beads vigorously swept the jungle floor, sending upa dust cloud. Behind her, a few long, golden pencils of light angled through thetrees.“Hola, Mamá!” shouted Tommy as he dismounted his bike. Tommy’smother—Panchita—dropped her broom in surprise and gleefully greeted her son withan embrace, and then turned to me. “OyEEE, God blesses me!” she exclaimed. “Ihave foreign visitors!” Then she hugged me.She took us both by the hand and led us to her porch, where she jumped up on abench and dangled her legs in the air. It was only 7:30 a.m., but Panchita wasready for her midmorning break. She’d been up since four and had already kneltnext to her bed to say her morning prayers, fetched two eggs from the chickencoop, ground corn by hand, brewed coffee from well water drawn from thelimestone bedrock beneath her house, made herself a breakfast of beans, eggs,and tortillas, split wood, and using a machete almost as tall as her five-footframe, cleared the encroaching bush around her house. She asked if she couldprepare breakfast for us. “No,” said Tommy, who was sweating lightly under hisbaseball cap. “I’m not hungry.”“Oh, you know better,” Panchita scolded. “Let me make you some eggs.” And shejumped off the bench.“No, no, Mamá,” Tommy said, shifting uncomfortably on his bench. “I’m fine.”Panchita pulled herself back up and now began to stroke Tommy’s knee. “How isyour leg, my son?” A few days earlier, he had injured it working around thehouse.“Mamá, I’m fine, please!” he said, grimacing.As the scene unfolded, I sat by and smiled to see an exchange between a lovingmother and a son who didn’t want to be embarrassed in front of a new friend.Under the circumstances, I could see Tommy’s point. He was, after all, an80-year-old man and a great-grandfather himself. His mother, Panchita, hadrecently celebrated her 100th birthday. Hojancha, where they live, has one ofthe healthiest, longest-lived populations on the planet—a place where sons cantake their time growing up.SEARCHING IN CENTRAL AMERICAIn 2002, as demographer Luis Rosero-Bixby was doing routine work with CostaRican population data, he noticed that men here seemed to be living longer thanthose in more developed countries around the world. This remarkable fact hadgone unnoticed because in developing countries and in Central America—a part ofthe world notorious for malaria, dengue fever, and revolutions—most mortalitystudies didn’t even ask if anyone lived past age 80, which was considered wellbeyond the life expectancy of the area.Moreover, organizations like the United Nations had assumed that many CostaRicans often exaggerated their ages, so that any finding would be consideredinvalid. Nevertheless, Rosero-Bixby, the director of the Central AmericanPopulation Center in San José, decided to investigate further. Instead oflooking at census data (in which respondents can misreport their age), he used aforgotten but foolproof method of determining how long a population of elderslives. The “quasi-extinct cohort” method was based on using the well-documenteddeath records of Costa Rica’s voting population and birth records to computeages. (Unlike many places in Latin America, the depoliticized office ofstatistics and census has been free of government meddling since 1883.)Put simply, he took a sampling of births recorded between 1890 and 1900 and thenfound the death records. From that, he calculated the average age of death (lifeexpectancy) and the chance of dying at any given age (mortality rate).Comparing these findings with data from developed countries, Luis figured that aCosta Rican man at age 60 had about twice the chance of reaching age 90 as did aman living in the United States, France, or even Japan. He also found that if amale reached 90, he could expect, on average, another 4.4 years of life—again alife expectancy higher than in most developed countries. If Rosero-Bixby’snumbers were correct, it was an extraordinary find. Costa Rica spends only 15percent of what America does on health care, yet its people appeared to beliving longer, seemingly healthier lives than people in any other country onEarth.In 2005, Rosero-Bixby traveled to France to present his findings to a group ofhis peers at a world congress on population studies. A subset of thedemographers at the congress study long-lived populations, and many attendedRosero-Bixby’s talk. They listened attentively, but few seemed to trust hisfindings: Infectious diseases and political instability are known to shortenpeople’s lives in Central America. How could these demographers be expected tobelieve that any of the region’s populations could outlive their counterparts inmore developed countries? Rosero-Bixby received polite applause, and then theaudience scattered. He returned to Costa Rica and continued his work, mostlyfocused on population growth in Central America, and his longevity findings wenton the back burner.Not long after the conference, I phoned demographer Michel Poulain. My articlein National Geographic, “The Secrets of Long Life,” had met with success, and Iwas curious to find more of the world’s undiscovered Blue Zones. I knew thatMichel maintained a personal database of the world’s oldest populations, and Ifigured he might have some good ideas.“Yes, there are other places” he said in his heavy French accent, and he told meabout his recent travels to Crete and Majorca to investigate claims oflongevity. “But not so special as Sardinia.”I asked him if he’d ever considered places in the developing world. “Theproblem,” he replied, “is that these places have usually very poor recordkeeping, and it’s impossible to verify ages.” He paused. “Maybe,” he said in thevoice that accompanies an “ah-ha” moment, “there is one place.”Michel had attended the world congress on population studies, and he told meabout Rosero-Bixby’s paper. He said that Rosero-Bixby had struck him as a goodscientist whose data had perhaps been dismissed too quickly. I made a deal withMichel. If he’d examine Rosero-Bixby’s data and validate it, I’d find the moneyto finance an investigative trip.After our initial conversation, Poulain contacted Rosero-Bixby, explained ourwork in other Blue Zones around the world, and said we were interested insearching for a Blue Zone in Costa Rica. Would he work with us? He agreed. Infact, Michel checked his detailed data and, based on it, identified a group ofvillages around the Nicoya Peninsula where the proportion the oldest people wassignificantly higher than the rest of the country.Rosero-Bixby agreed with this, as he had already begun work on comparingdifferent regions in Costa Rica using a technique that involved drawingthousands of circles on a map of Costa Rica and checking the life expectancy andmortality rates of all the people living in those circles. Indeed, it producedone region in the northwest of the country including the Nicoya Peninsula thatwas significantly different from any other (e.g., in that region, people die ofcancer at a rate 23 percent lower than in the rest of the country). Accordinglyit was agreed that another potential Blue Zone might be identified and thatthese preliminary indications justified a trip.A NEW BLUE ZONE?Eight months later, with a grant from National Geographic’s Expeditions Council,Michel, videographer Tom Adair, and I arrived in San José for what amounted to aweek-long blind date. On a steamy Tuesday morning in August, our taxi wovethrough a labyrinth of streets near the University of San José and came to astop at an impressive, three-story building on the University of Costa Ricacampus.Inside the Central American Center for Population Studies, Rosero-Bixby waswaiting for us. A pleasant-looking man of 54 with graying black hair andwire-rimmed glasses, he was dressed in khakis and a polo shirt. He grabbed ourhands and greeted us in perfect English and with the ebullient hospitalitycharacteristic of Latin America. Did we want lunch? Coffee? Was our hotelreservation okay?He had taken three days’ vacation and borrowed the Center’s Toyota Land Cruiserto join us on an exploratory journey to Nicoya. He had also personally mined hisdatabases to find the names of 30 people over 90 years old and had theirprofiles and photographs loaded in the PDA he wore around his neck.He and Michel had mapped out a plan: We’d travel to Nicoya, interview a randomsample of at least 20 people over 90 years old to verify their ages, and get afeeling for their lifestyle. Then we’d return to San José and further verifytheir ages in the national archive. If ages checked out, we’d assemble a biggerteam and return on a second trip to try to explore further why people wereliving so long.Our route out of San José took us north along the Pan-American Highway. Iremembered the road well. Two decades earlier, I had traveled it from theopposite direction on a bicycle expedition from Alaska to Argentina. Then it hadsnaked pleasantly through the forested mountains that rose upward from theNicaraguan plains. Few cars passed and even fewer trucks. Unlike thePan-American Highway in most other countries, the road here cuts through veryfew villages (a surveyor had told me back then that a wealthy landowner hadconvinced government officials to route the highway past his land instead ofthrough a lower, more populated route). Now, long trains of diesel-belchingsemis clogged the road, heaving slowly up the hills and coasting cautiously downthe other side.But for Luis at the wheel, this was travel as usual. He was telling us the storyof his childhood in Ecuador and how he had fallen in love with a Costa Ricanwho’d brought him to San José, where he’d worked as a lecturer in demography andlearned English.He made his way to the United States, earned a Ph.D. in demography, and thensecured a position at Princeton University where he worked in the office ofOffice of Population Research. He established the Central American PopulationCenter with grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000 and hasrun it ever since. “It’s really nothing,” he concluded with a modest shrug.At Las Juntas, three hours north of San José, we turned off the Pan-AmericanHighway and drove westward toward through progressively drier and hotterterrain. The forests eventually gave way to cow pastures dotted with humped-backBrahman cattle and occasionally the massively crowned guanacaste trees afterwhich the region is named.We crossed the Taiwan Friendship Bridge spanning the alligator-infestedTempisque River and onto the roughly 80-mile-long finger of land south of theNicaraguan border along the Pacific coast—the Nicoya Peninsula. “Until veryrecently, this was one of the most isolated parts of Costa Rica,” Luis said.“You can see it’s a long way from the highways, and before this bridge wasbuilt, most people had to take a ferry to get here.”This in fact was our first clue to Nicoya’s longevity. Sardinia’s Blue Zones hadbeen similarly isolated. Could the population here have been isolated and thenevolved a genetic makeup that favored longevity as had happened in Sardinia, wewondered? “Probably not,” replied Luis. “It’s a pretty mixed-blood race livinghere.”“What else distinguished the people here from everyone else in Costa Rica?” Iasked.Luis thought for a minute. As a demographer, he tended to be focused more onnumbers than on the people behind those numbers. He had led teams of surveyorswho had interviewed people, but that was mainly to compile survey data. The ideathat he had stumbled upon a Blue Zone was new to him.image [Images/202.jpg]All Costa Rican citizens carry a cedula de identidad, an identification cardlisting both name and date of birth (making verifying the centenarians’ agesmuch easier).“First, you have to realize that Nicoya, like all of Costa Rica, has the bestpublic health system in Central America,” he said. “We have good sewage systems,immunization programs, and clinics in almost every village. Nevertheless, inCosta Rica we also have one of the highest rates of stomach cancer in the world.Many people die from it. But for some reason, it’s the cancer mortality ratethat is much lower in Nicoya. Perhaps they are eating something—or not eatingsomething?”I asked if there was anything else. Luis demurred and threw me a side glancefrom the driver’s seat. He’s a top-notch scientist, but sometimes he reminded meof a shy schoolboy, like the smartest kid in class who often had the rightanswers but was afraid of showing off. “You know in Latin America, we takemarriage very seriously. If you get married, there’s great pressure to staymarried your whole life. But here,” he hesitated. “Well, men here have veryliberal attitudes toward sex. They tend to have many sexual partners throughoutlife.”That theory was a new one for longevity.FIRST FORAYLuis, Michel, Tom, and I set up headquarters in a hotel outside the city ofNicoya. Over the next three days, we searched for every centenarian or personclose to the 100-year milestone within a 20-mile radius. Most of the 21 peoplewe identified were easy to locate. Some four or five among these had diedrecently, but this proportion was extraordinarily low considering the ages. Luishad addresses and often phone numbers; the centenarians usually lived in simple,rural villages in cement houses located on streets laid out in a grid.Invariably, we’d be welcomed in and offered a seat.Then Michel would get to work verifying people’s ages. Since there arerelatively few demographers in his specialty—long-lived people—he has inventedseveral of the techniques now widely used to verify ages. Here, he asked to lookat the birthday on the national identification card (cedula). Then he asked aseries of questions about the parents’ and children’s ages to make sure theycoincided. (For example, a 100-year-old woman who claimed that she had a30-year-old son indicated a problem.) He’d take notes, including birth and deathdates of all relatives and the numbers on their national identification cards.Then I asked some questions about diet, lifestyle, and life history. Havinginterviewed more than a hundred centenarians in other places around the world, Iwanted to get a general impression of how people aged here compared to people inOkinawa, Sardinia, and Loma Linda, California.As a whole, the people I met in Nicoya seemed sharper and more active thananywhere else. They all believed in God, seemed to have a strong work ethic(like the Okinawans), and possessed a zeal for family second only to theSardinians. All of them seemed to be taking advantage of Costa Rica’s excellentpublic health system, receiving vaccinations, and using local clinics whenevernecessary. Their diet consisted largely of corn, beans, pork, garden vegetables,and an abundance of fruit (papaya, mango, chico zapote, oranges), much of itgrown in and around their yards. And the majority of the men, and a smallpercentage of the women, admitted to having lovers besides their spouses. Noneof them were officially divorced. They just started living with someone else.Among the centenarians we met during our first week:• Rafael Ángel Leon Leon, 100, who lived at the top of the winding road in thehills above Nicoya. Behind his basic wooden farmhouse, he still grew a garden,harvested his own corn and beans, and kept some livestock. He played the guitar,had an excellent voice, and true to Luis’s observation, fancied himself a lady’sman. He’d had several lovers before he finally married an Indian woman 40 yearshis junior—when he was 94.• Ofelia Gómez Gómez, who lived with her daughter, son-in-law, and twograndchildren. At 102, she recited from memory a six-minute poem by PabloNeruda.• Francesca Castillo (Panchita), who was 99 the first time we met her, livedalone outside Hojancha, cut her own wood, and twice a week walked a mile intotown (once to attend Sunday Mass and a second time to go to the market).At week’s end, we gathered all of our notes and returned to San José. Michel wasvery excited. We all agreed that, along with Sardinia’s Blue Zone, this was oneof the most extraordinary regions of longevity we’d seen. Before we announcedour findings and committed to a more thorough research trip, however, Michel hadone more task to satisfy his scientific skepticism. We had an appointment todescend into the basement of the national archives and double-check the age ofeach person we met in Nicoya.The process involved crosschecking each subject’s national identification numberto the corresponding entry in a sequentially numbered ledger located in thearchive. This sort of eye-glazing detail made me hate science as a kid, but herewe were about to enter the tomb containing the “Holy Grail” of data. It tookabout an hour to get the necessary clearance, and then two functionaries led usto the basement of the building where the vital information of every person bornin Costa Rica since 1888 is recorded in floor-to-ceiling rows of leather-boundbooks. Hours later, after we checked every name in the ledger and thecorresponding birth certificate, Michel emerged from the archives into the lateafternoon like Rocky Balboa.“This is a great success!” he announced triumphantly. There was no ambiguity:Nicoya, Costa Rica, was—along with the Sardinian Blue Zone—an area with one ofthe longest-lived populations in the world.But the question remained: Why?RETURN TO NICOYAWhen Michel and I returned to Nicoya in January 2007, we came armed with a planand a team of experts. We set up our headquarters at Dorati Lodge, a cluster ofrough-planked, tin-roofed dormitories on the forested edge of Hojancha, nearNicoya’s core. Run by a doting family, the lodge was close to villagers living atraditional lifestyle and small enough that we could take over the compound. Itcame with its own troupe of howler monkeys and was just down the road from acentenarian. (Michel had spent much of the intervening five months studying mapsand spreadsheets to better define Costa Rica’s Blue Zone and found that it waslocated only in the midsection of the peninsula, excluding both the southern andnorthern extremes and the Pacific Coast.)The family gave us permission to install a high-speed wireless Internetconnection and to convert the open-aired dining pavilion—a sheltered,bush-flanked slab of cement—into a longevity laboratory and video-productionhouse. Each night we’d create reports and short videos for an online audiencewho’d track our progress and offer their insights.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SLEEP TIGHTGetting enough sleep keeps the immune system functioning smoothly, decreases therisk of heart attack, and recharges the brain. Adults both young and old needbetween 7 to 9 hours per night. To help get it, go to bed at the same time everynight and wake up the same time each morning; keep your bedroom dark, quiet, andcool; and use a comfortable mattress and pillows.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our first recruit was Dr. Gianni Pes, who discovered with Michel the first BlueZone in Sardinia. Like Michel, he was a careful, skeptical scientist, notinclined to jump to conclusions. He brought a suitcase full of academic papersand the Spanish translation of a survey he had used to assess Sardiniancentenarians. He also had developed several hypotheses from other long-livedpopulations around the world that he wanted to test. Among them, Gianni observedthat the more daughters a man has, the longer he lives; that people born inwinter seem to live longer than those born in the summer, and that people whothink they’re going to live longer actually do. Would these findings also holdtrue in Nicoya?Luis Rosero-Bixby (who could not join us because of a minor surgery) connectedus with Dr. Elizabeth Lopez, a former psychologist with the World Bank whospecialized in well-being. She developed a simple test that would help usdetermine levels of self-esteem, sense of purpose, and well-being among Nicoya’scentenarians.Eliza Thomas, a California-based researcher and health writer, would focus onidentifying components of the Nicoya diet. Atlanta-based Sabriya Rice, a CNNproducer and fluent Spanish speaker, would help with interviews. We also had afilm and photography crew that included Damian Petrou, Tom Adair, Joseph VanHarken, Nick Buettner, and Gianluca Colla to help document our findings. JorgeVindas, a Costa Rican who had interviewed many of Nicoya’s centenarians as partof Rosero-Bixby’s research team, would join us as a facilitator and translator.After dinner the first night, I gathered the team and presented the plan. Theysat at a long table, with the remnants of our bean, chicken, and tortilla dinnerin front of them and listened. “We’ll have two teams,” I began. “Michel andGianni will lead one team. Their goal will be to find and interview as many ofNicoya’s elderly as possible. As results come in, they will report back to therest of us on their general condition, what they eat, and any other observationsthat occur with regularity.”“You must know,” Michel interrupted, his skin already pink from just a day oftropical sun. “Finding these things is a very slow process. You can’t expectresults right away—and maybe no results at all.” Gianni, who was 48, with aneatly trimmed moustache, glasses, brown hair, and an air of shy intelligence,nodded in agreement.“Thank you,” I replied, meaning it. Though Michel’s thoroughness wasinconvenient, I knew that his findings would pass muster with other researchers.“The rest of us will be charged with finding people who fit the longevityprofile and interviewing them to get their stories.”“Where do we start?” Sabriya asked.“Here’s what we know,” I replied, not sure where I was going with my answer.Before arriving in Nicoya, Michel, Gianni, and I had spent several days at theUniversity of San José talking to geologists, historians, epidemiologists,geneticists, and medical doctors. They had given us some strong ideas.“Nicoyans have lived in relative isolation for the last four centuries, so theirculture has developed differently from the rest of Costa Rica. But they are notgenetically different. They have the country’s lowest rate of cancer, so they’redoing something here that protects them. And this part of Costa Rica has astrong indigenous influence. Finally, Gianni found a geology atlas at theuniversity that showed the peninsula’s unique physical feature,” I said,noticing that the team was staring at me blankly. “Okay,” I said, taking a stepback. As a team, we needed to walk before we ran. “We’ll give you names andaddresses of centenarians. Why don’t you take a couple of days to go out and getto know some of them?”I took my own advice, and during the first week randomly chose a few of thedozen or so centenarians we had on our list to meet. On day three, I decided tovisit 101-year-old Don Faustino, mainly because I had heard that he routinelytook a bus each Saturday to Santa Cruz for market day, where every week hebought the exact same items on a grocery list.Tomorrow was Saturday.THE FIRST CLUESThe sun was just rising over the prickly pastures outside the village ofVeintisiete de Abril when I arrived at the three-room wooden house that DonFaustino shared with his grandson Jorge and his 15-year-old great-grandson,Marco. They were already outside, waiting for the 7:30 a.m. bus to take them totown.Don Faustino, who gets up at four on market day to get ready, wore ashort-sleeve plaid shirt, floppy hat, and pants rolled up above his gnarledsandaled feet and sinewy ankles. He nodded an indifferent “yes” when I asked ifI could join him on his trip to the market. Moments later, an old Greyhoundpulled up with a hissing belch, and the doors swung open. We nudged onto apacked bus, where the temperature was considerably warmer than 98.6 degrees. DonFaustino’s eyes met mine and he nodded again, this time as if to say, “Youwanted to come.”We disembarked a block away from the farmers market where Faustino struck off ona serious quest for perfect red peppers and platanos. He touched perhaps a dozenvegetables before he bought six of each, paying with a few tattered bills. Nextstop: the butcher.“Why don’t we just buy it here?” I asked Jorge, a portly, middle-aged man with around, affable face. There were rows of stalls selling meat. “He has his ritualshe doesn’t like to break,” Jorge sighed, mopping a sweaty forehead with a dirtyrag. The tropical midmorning sun was already hot. “Moreover, the butchers arehis friends.”So we walked another half mile, Faustino leading the way, resolutely shufflingdown the street 20 feet ahead of us. I was thinking: “This guy is a machine.”Most people Faustino’s age couldn’t get out of a chair.image [Images/211.jpg]Every week, centenarian Don Faustino buys groceries for his family’s Sundaymeal.“You don’t forget your friends, do you Don Faustino?” shouted the butcher with asmile as we approached. Faustino shook his head “no,” handing two-liter plasticbottles to the butcher to fill with liquefied lard. Then the butcher sliced offtwo slabs of pork from a dangling pig carcass and wrapped them in newspapers.Faustino paid with exact change and shuffled off again.Down the block, in a general store stocked with canned goods and wilted produce,he bought sweet corn bread. This was not for him. “It’s for my son,” uttered DonFaustino in his soft voice. “It’s his favorite.” (This bit of thoughtfulnessconjured images of a little kid receiving a much-awaited treat until Jorgereminded me that Faustino’s son is 79.)This time before paying Faustino made what seemed like an impulse buy—acalendar. He picked it up, flipped through it, paused to study the cover shot ofa tranquil, forest stream, and tossed it on the checkout counter next to thebread. The title of the calendar: “The River of Life.”Back near the bus stop, we broke for an early lunch. Over a bowl of soup I askedFaustino about his life. He told me he loved to work, mostly because the fruitsof his labor have provided for his family. For most of his career, he worked asa mule driver, hauling logs out of the forested hills and acting as a courieracross the largely roadless Nicoya Peninsula. He also grew corn, beans, andvegetables to feed his wife and six children. “I also had two kids with avillage girl,” he said matter-of-factly, out of nowhere.“Didn’t your wife care?” I ask.“I don’t know,” he shrugged. “We didn’t talk about it.” He went on to tell me,unapologetically, that he never gave the children his name nor did he eversupport them. “How do I know if they’re going to turn out okay?” he exclaimed asif explaining his actions.On one hand, it seemed callous. On the other hand, Jorge Vindas, who was withme, had interviewed about 650 seniors in Nicoya and calculated that 75 percentof the men had had sex outside the marriage. He told me that Faustino was justbeing Nicoyan. Faustino fell into a pensive silence, then looked up, concludingwith a non sequitur: “I’ve had a tranquil life.”On the bus ride home, I felt as though I was getting my first glimpse into thehardscrabble lives of these Nicoya men, these cowboys who worked hard and lovedfreely. Perhaps the isolation permitted a looser set of values to become thenorm? Or perhaps this guy was a macho jerk who happened to survive a long time?I didn’t think so.Back at Veintisiete de Abril, I saw the truth. We stopped at Faustino’s son’shouse, just down the street from his place, to deliver the sweet bread. Likemost of the village houses, it was a dusty, three-room shack with walls ofwooden planks, a tin roof, and chickens roaming freely in and out. There Iwitnessed Faustino’s genetic cascade: his daughter, granddaughter,great-granddaughter, and great-great-grandson—five generations—all together inthe same room. When Faustino walked in, his daughter Maria Jesus—a rotund78-year-old—lit up and hugged her father. “Oh Papá, thank you!” she exclaimed.“You know I wait all week for this.”We moved into a dimly lit, rose-colored living room and settled into dustysofas. Faustino’s great-great-grandson, six-year-old Elias, curled up in hislap. Although Faustino was not part of room’s chatter, his presence there madethe family seem complete now. I asked why Don Faustino made this weekly shoppingexpedition.“He buys these ingredients for the exact same Sunday soup,” replied Jorge.“After church, the family will all gather for dinner. He’s been doing this for40 years; it’s the highlight of his week. We all look forward to it too, thoughwe wouldn’t mind a menu change once in a while.”“Why doesn’t Maria Jesus make soup?” I asked.“She would, but he won’t let her. He still feels the need to provide.”This fact was interesting. A week earlier, I had met Dr. Xinia Fernández, anutritionist who’d studied Nicoya. I had contacted her about dietary surveys ofthe peninsula but soon realized that over the years of talking with Nicoyans,she had gathered keen insights into their character as well.“We notice that the most highly functioning people over 90 in Nicoya have a fewcommon traits,” she told me. “One of them is that they feel a strong sense ofservice to others or care for their family. We see that as soon as they losethis, the switch goes off. They die very quickly if they don’t feel needed.”Indeed, in every Blue Zone, centenarians possess a strong sense of purpose. InOkinawa it was ikigai—the reason to wake up in the morning. Here, saidFernández, the Costa Ricans called it plan de vida.I looked over at Don Faustino. He was across the room with José sittingcrossways on his lap. Absently or perhaps instinctually, he caressed the boy’sbare foot as he stared out into the air. Was he thinking of the two kids he’dfathered 70 years ago? Or could this just be the look of tranquility? He had notbeen a perfect man by my definition, but he did possess a crystalline notion ofpriorities. He knew his plan de vida. They were seated in this room.Here was a man who still pushed himself to rise at four every Saturday morning,travel to the market, and buy the food to provide for his family. Maybe it’s theinertia of duty that keeps him going or the sense of caring and feeling goodabout doing something for others. Or perhaps it’s the human imperative to feelneeded that keeps the river of life running through Don Faustino.CHOROTEGA FACTORThe days of our expedition unfolded with satisfying progress. We’d wake eachmorning at seven and gather in the dining pavilion, where we’d take a breakfastof tropical fruit, beans, rice, and tortillas. Then we’d disperse like billiardballs after the break. Gianni, Michel, and Elizabeth struck out to do theirinterviews; their goal was nine a day. Eliza, Sabriya, and I would split up thevideo crews and photographers to track down leads. Just before sunset, the teamwould return, heat-flushed and dusty from the day, but also flush with some newdiscovery, and converge on the dining pavilion, which now was a sea of laptopcomputers, cables, and power cords, with a cooler in the corner.After dinner, each team member shared their findings with the rest of the group.We hung a bed sheet from the rafters and took turns presenting our findings,using a projector. The video team made a three-minute Internet movie of onestory that highlighted a component of Nicoyan longevity. Then Gianni and Micheltook their turns, usually flashing a series of pie charts and bar graphs thatrevealed what their interviewees were eating and how they performed on physicaltests.By the end of the first week, Gianni and Michel had interviewed about 20 of theoldest Nicoyans. They asked them about diet and hours of sleep. They took bloodpressure, pulse rate, and put each subject through short physical tests. Atfirst blush, the Nicoyans were an impressive bunch. For Michel, a hypothesis wastaking shape: “We’re seeing a Chorotega factor,” he said. “I think this issomething very important.”He was referring to the Chorotega Indians who thrived in Nicoya before theSpanish arrived in 1522. They lived in simple thatched-hut communities ringed byvegetable gardens, fruit trees, and, farther out, milpas (fields of corn andbeans). There, using slash-and-burn agriculture, they grew maize and many kindsof beans. They were mostly subsistence farmers, but they also depended on wildgame and fish. Like other Mesoamerican cultures, the Chorotega were religiousand apparently lived low-stress lives. And according to him, their influence wasstill alive.“You see it over and over again; these people have Chorotega ancestry,” he said,making a characteristic chopping motion with his hand. “These people are eatingthe same food and living with relatively little stress. But of course, we needto do more study….”Meanwhile, Eliza and Jorge had spent the day with 91-year-old Aureliano Rosalesin the village of Santa Ana, and they were prepared to report on what they’ddiscovered. Eliza is a 27-year-old science writer from California with thewholesome good looks of a farmer’s daughter. As a writer and editor of healthmagazines, she is familiar with every fad diet and “health supplement” that hascome along in the past decade.The countless stories she had researched on health and wellness had galvanizedher belief in the subtle, long-term power of eating unprocessed foods. For thistrip, she’d done several months’ research into the nutrient values of fruits andvegetables that we’d expect to encounter in Nicoya. So when she heard aboutAureliano’s yard, which Jorge had described as “a private Garden of Eden,” Elizaleaped at the opportunity to meet him.Eliza stood up with a stack of notes and began clicking through a series ofimages. As we saw pictures of Santa Ana, Aureliano’s wood-plank house, hisfamily and garden, she narrated his story. Aureliano’s life and that of DonFaustino were strikingly similar. Both lived in small villages, each with acentral plaza and surrounded by vast cow pastures that dissolved into rollinghills on the horizon. An early life of hardship had tempered them into strongmen with a zest for work (Aureliano’s parents had died, leaving him an orphan).Both worked as mule drivers and subsistence farmers. They boasted of havingraised big families but were quick to admit to the romantic adventures of theiryouths.Aureliano, a decade younger than Faustino, was still an ebullient, sturdy manwith an enviable head of white hair and a contagious belly laugh. He shared atwo-room house with his wife, daughter, granddaughter, and nephew, and he stilllived a traditional Nicoyan lifestyle.image [Images/218.jpg]Freshly cooked tortillas are a regular part of the Nicoyan diet.“Aureliano led me into the garden behind his home with a machete in hand,whacking weeds, pruning trees, and chasing away vermin. The garden had dozens offruit trees,” she said, clicking through images of banana, lemon, and orangetrees. “But then he showed me these wildly exotic fruits.” There was themarañón, a red-orange fruit five times richer in vitamin C than oranges; anona,which looks like a misshapen, thick-skinned pear known to have selectivetoxicity against various types of cancer cells; and wild ginger, a great sourceof vitamin B6, magnesium, and manganese. “All of these are antioxidantpowerhouses associated with disease prevention and longer life,” Eliza informedus.“At the edge of the garden, Aureliano showed me the corn and bean field he tendsand harvests twice a year. He showed me how the low-growing beans providemoisture-capturing ground cover and fix nitrogen in the soil and, in turn, howthe corn provides stalks for the bean vines to climb.“He took me back to the house where he showed me how the corn is dried, thensoaked in water with ash and lime, to loosen the tough outer skin,” Elizaexplained. “Then his wife demonstrated how the corn is ground, made into dough,patted into tortillas, and served with beans and squash. This creates thefoundation of perhaps the best longevity diet the world has ever known,” Elizasaid with some excitement. “This food combination is rich in complexcarbohydrates, protein, calcium, and niacin. Recent research shows that in highdoses maize can reduce bad cholesterol and augment good cholesterol.”Eliza looked up at us and shuffled her papers. “In San José I interviewedProfessor Leonardo Mata, who proposed that the most significant component ofthis food triangle is maize (corn). Here, the fact that they use lime—which iscalcium hydroxide—to cook the kernels makes all the difference. It infuses thegrain with a high concentration of calcium greater than in untreated maize andmost other foods, and unlocks certain amino acids for the body to absorb.Nicoyans call the resulting maize dough maíz nixquezado.“Mata has been studying diets in Guatemala where people prepare corn in thatmanner,” she continued. “Populations consuming maíz nixquezado (maíznixtamalizado in Guatemala, Mexico, and other countries) appear to have very lowrates of rickets and also suffer fewer fractured bones and hips. This might alsoexplain why Aureliano was so robust and strong while living all his life inrelative poverty. So his fresh, organic, nutrient-rich diet with nixquezadoexplains why this 91-year-old looks like he’s 60.” She ended the talk with aslide of Aureliano kissing his smiling wife on the cheek. We had only been therea week, and it seemed like Eliza had found Nicoya’s longevity secret inAureliano’s garden.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORANGESOne of the most popular fruits consumed in Costa Rica’s Blue Zone is one of theeasiest to find at home—the orange. Suppliers of vitamin C, fiber, potassium,and folate, oranges have been credited with helping prevent heart disease,cancer, and stroke.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“Unfortunately, it’s not so simple,” interjected Gianni, who had been listeningquietly. “We don’t know how much of the foods that grow in his garden Aurelianohas eaten throughout his entire life, and we don’t know what else he has alsoeaten. It could be something you didn’t even see. In fact, we can associate hislongevity more easily to the fact that Aureliano lives with a daughter than whathe grows in his garden.” Then Gianni went on to describe a study done in ruralPoland showing that every daughter increases a man’s life expectancy by 75weeks.Eliza, the good-natured soul that she is, accepted the feedback and asked Giannihow we could tease out Nicoya’s diet of longevity.“You must begin by finding out what most centenarians have eaten for most oftheir lives,” he replied.Over the next week, we worked to draw a bead on the Nicoyan diet. Gianni andMichel’s interviews yielded some answers. They asked centenarians what they ateand heard “beans, rice, tortillas, and fruit” over and over. This was animperfect source: People’s memories can be inaccurate. (Quick—what did you eatfor lunch a week ago Tuesday?) But they would offer clues.Eliza had a better source. In a pile of academic papers given to her by Dr.Fernández, she had found three national nutritional surveys dated 1969, 1978,and 1982. Costa Rica’s Minister of Public Health, we discovered, periodicallysurveyed people in each of the country’s five rural regions to determine whatand how much they ate.The surveys focused on one town the ministry considered representative of theregion and measured how many grams of each of 20 foodstuffs people ate—thingslike dairy products, grains, tubers, and fruits. In 1969 the survey focused onVeintisiete de Abril (Don Faustino’s town) and in 1978, the survey took place inLa Mansión—two miles from the Dorati Lodge!I had another source. In preparation for the trip, I had found a University ofCalifornia Press report from 1958 entitled Nicoya: A Cultural Geography by aBerkeley anthropologist named Philip Wagner. I had a photocopy of it in myluggage. Eliza and I thumbed through it, and on page 241 we struck researchgold—a chapter that described a day in the life of an average Nicoyan—50 yearsago. It read:The day of the country people begins before sunrise, when the women rise toprepare coffee. The family meets about dawn to take its cup of black coffee, orcoffee with milk, heavily sweetened, and perhaps to eat a cold tortilla. Thetime from dawn to eight o’clock is for chores and beginning the day’s work. Ateight there may be a complete breakfast with rice and beans and eggs. In seasonsof heavy work the men take with them to the fields tortillas with gallo pinto(rice and beans fried in pork fat). Work may end on very hot days at twelve, orat two in the afternoon. The workers come home from the fields or the woods andwait about an hour for their meal.The midday meal often begins with a pot of soup in which there are a few bits ofmeat, fat, boiled plantains, tisquisque [sic] or yuca, and perhaps a few greens.After the soup come rice and beans, usually accompanied by fried eggs. Onoccasion there may also be some vegetable: pipián or ayote (Cucurbita moschata)or calabaza (Lagenaria), cabbage, the flower of piñuela (Bromelia pinguin) orsome other wild product. Meat sometimes appears on even the poorest table, andthere is usually cuajada, a milk curd. Tortillas come with this meal andafterward the men sip heavily sweetened black coffee, made from local berries orfrom the mashed seeds of ñanjú (Hibiscus esculentus).The evening meal is simpler, since the custom is to spend the afternoon inidleness, and appetites are less hearty. Rice and beans, tortillas, and perhapseggs are served just at dusk.Wagner also made detailed sketches of gardens, showing more than 40 differentedible plant species (many still growing today in Aureliano’s garden), buthighlighted yucca, tiquisque, papaya, bananas, yams, and nanpí as mainstays ofthe local diet. Nicoayans also ate a variety of exotic forest fruits like jobo(Spondias), guayabo (Psidium guajava), caimito (Chrysophyllum cainito), andpapaturro (Coccoloba).So what’s the upshot? One night after dinner, I went back to my cabin to sortthings out. I sat cross-legged on the wood plank floor and spread out my papersin a huge semicircle. I had Wagner’s accounts, the dietary surveys, academicpapers, and my notes on diet in Costa Rica.A few characteristics of Nicoya’s diet stood out. Like the people in most otherBlue Zones, Nicoyans ate the emblematic low-calorie, low-fat, plant-based diet,rich in legumes. But unlike other Blue Zones, the Nicoyan diet featured portionsof corn tortillas at almost every meal and huge quantities of tropical fruit.Sweet lemon (Citrus limetta), orange (Citrus sinensis), and a banana variety arethe most common fruits throughout most of the year in Nicoya. Mata’s explanationof nixtamale seems to explain the connection between maize and longevity, buthow do fruits contribute to longevity?Luis had told me on our first trip that Nicoya had lower rates of stomachcancer—a major killer in the country. In San José, I had tracked down ProfessorRafaela Sierra, a Spanish-born epidemiologist from the Institute deInvestigaciones en Salud (INISA) to see if she could tell me why. Sierraexplained that stomach cancer is closely linked to the Helicobacter pylori (Hp)bacteria. She did a study comparing people living in the area with the highestincidence of stomach cancer (near San José) and the lowest rate of stomachcancer (Nicoya) to try to identify the cause. “I found that school kids in bothplaces were equally infected with Hp,” she said. “So we knew that it wasn’t justthe bacteria. The cancer comes from how people react to it, and there are manythings that mix.”When I asked her to venture a guess as to why the incidence of cancer is so muchlower in Nicoya, she hedged. “We don’t know anything for sure, but I can tellthat the populations of both zones were dominated by peasants. Near San José,they tended to be migrant workers, moving around as seasonal work presenteditself. In Nicoya, the peasants tended to be sedentary. We know that the biglandowner often let them grow a garden, which gave them access to freshvegetables.“We also believe that vitamin C and beta-carotenes may help prevent stomachcancer or at least subdue the effects of the Hp. You find these nutrients infruits and vegetables like papaya, carrots, calabazas (squash), oranges,pineapples.”I wasn’t familiar with all the different kinds of fruits and vegetablesavailable to Nicoyans, but all of our team’s research and everything we hadobserved directly in the field pointed to Nicoyans being big consumers of freshfruit. Our research also suggested that fruits’ role in preventing stomachcancer seemed to offer a piece in Nicoya’s longevity puzzle.SOMETHING IN THE WATER?Near the end of our second week in Nicoya, Gianni and Michel were putting acouple other pieces in place. In San José, they’d followed their noses into thebasement of the university library, where they’d found an atlas illustratingdifferent features in each of the country’s regions. They were looking foridiosyncrasies, characteristics that distinguished Nicoya from the rest of CostaRica. The atlas provided three leads: 1) Nicoya was the hottest and driestregion; 2) It received more hours of sunlight on average during the year; and 3)The water percolating up from Nicoya’s limestone bedrock was very different thanother water in Costa Rica.When Gianni matter-of-factly mentioned that Nicoya’s water was special, itimmediately conjured up notions of Juan Ponce de León and his legendary16th-century search for a Fountain of Youth. Indeed, though Ponce de León’squest began in what is today Florida, the rumors originated with the ArawakIndians, who inhabited islands off Costa Rica’s Caribbean coast. But how wasNicoya’s water special?“What the atlas showed, specifically, was the mineral content of the water,” hereplied. “It revealed that the water hardness, the calcium and magnesiumcontent, was higher in Nicoya than anywhere else in Costa Rica.” To confirmthis, Gianni used a water-testing kit; in each of the 20 or so households wherehe conducted interviews, he tested the drinking water. The result: “The waterhad such high levels of calcium and magnesium that I had to dilute it by 50percent with distilled water just so that I could test it.”Gianni then calculated that if the average Nicoyan consumed (through drinking,cooking, or making coffee) six liters of water daily, he or she would ingest agram a day—for most people their daily requirement of calcium. And how doescalcium-rich water explain longevity?Gianni pushed his plate aside to make room for his laptop. He opened a file andshowed me a 2004 World Health Organization paper that examined a host of studiesover the past 50 years. Populations with hard water, it found, have up to 25percent fewer deaths from heart disease than populations with soft water. Iasked him how he explains this. “The heart is a muscle, and all musclecontractions depend on calcium,” he said. “Inadequate calcium means weakmuscles—including the heart. Old people often have too little calcium in theirbodies. So having extra-hard water may help keep Nicoyans’ hearts strong forlonger.”image [Images/226.jpg]Panchita, 100 years old, rests after a day spent cooking, splitting logs, andusing a machete to clear brush from her yard.Also, calcium is important for bones, he continued, looking at me over hisglasses. I could tell he was making a good-natured effort to simplify theexplanation. “Our bones are constantly losing mass and building it back up. Whenwe are young, our bones build faster than they deteriorate. After we are about40, the reverse occurs, and we lose bone faster than we build it. Calcium mayhelp slow that loss. Lastly, loss of bone strength can also make older peoplemore susceptible to hip fractures, which is one of the leading causes of deathfor older people. Adequate levels of calcium might explain why Nicoyans areavoiding risks that kill other populations. “But (there was always a “but” withthe ever-cautious Gianni) before we can say for sure that Nicoya’s water is partof the explanation of its longevity, we must do more tests.”SAFETY NETSOne night toward the end of the expedition, it was my turn to stand up afterdinner and present a report to the team. I told the story of Abuela Panchita,the 100-year-old woman whose 80-year-old son, Tommy, biked to see her each day.In many ways she represented everything that I’d learned so far about Nicoyanlongevity: Successful centenarians here were religious, family oriented,unconcerned with money, flexible but ultimately decisive, and consummatelylikable. I clicked through pictures of Panchita chopping wood, clearing bushwith a machete, and walking through town in her bright pink dress and carnivalbeads. I told everyone that of the 200 centenarians I have interviewed aroundthe world, Panchita was the most extraordinary. “You’ve got to introduce me toher,” said Elizabeth Lopez after my talk. Elizabeth was our team psychologist,who specialized in well-being. “I’ve done 20 interviews so far, and I’ve neverseen anyone like her.”Panchita lived just a few hundred meters from the Dorati Lodge, so Elizabeth andI left the next morning on foot. We walked past the howler monkeys in the mangotrees overhead, out the driveway, and into the village of Hojancha. There,mothers walked their white-shirted, uniformed kids to school, and old men swungon hammocks on porches. Something about the Costa Rican morning—the ever-presentsoundtrack of sabanero music, the faint aroma of tortillas roasting, or theradiant sunshine instantly makes me happy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CALCIUMNicoya’s drinking water is richly packed with calcium, giving the locals an easysupply of this important mineral. Calcium is the most abundant mineral found inthe human body and vital to keeping bones strong. For those without calcium-richwater, yogurt, milk, and cheese are great natural sources of calcium. For dairyalternatives, try sardines, kale, and broccoli.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Elizabeth had come to us by way of Luis. She had read an article in the CostaRican newspapers about the Blue Zone project, and, having recently retired fromthe World Bank, she was looking to get involved with something, her new plan devida. So Luis put her in touch with me, knowing our project was short on localexpertise. When we met, I immediately recognized her as a godsend. A Costa Ricannative, she spoke fluent Spanish, and thus served as a perfect liaison betweenGianni and Michel (who did not speak Spanish) and the interviewees. Moreover,she could help them expand their questionnaire to include a way to measurepsychological factors—like happiness and faith levels in long-lived people. Aswe walked, I asked her what she was finding.“Dan, these people are so incredible,” she answered enthusiastically. “They areso positive and so devoted to their families. All but one of the 33 Nicoyans wehave met live with their family.” Elizabeth was looking at me, gesticulating aswe walked. “They have a wonderful support network. They also tend to have alarge number of visitors that they receive almost every afternoon, which is botha physical and psychological safety net.”We walked over the same bridge that Tommy and I had biked over a few daysearlier. Toward the edge of the village, the houses were simpler, with polewalls, tin roofs, and small yards. The poorest and most “Indian” families livedon the outskirts of Hojancha, where the rectangular street pattern gave way towinding paths and roads that often followed the banks of streams. In one suchhouse Panchita lived.As we turned down Panchita’s drive, I asked Elizabeth if she’d observed anythingelse. She thought a moment and replied. “Yes, two things. The first is—and thisis just my impression—but I think that men live with less stress than women do.They don’t tend to worry about the children…and we’ve all seen how common it isfor men to have lovers outside the marriage.”GOD WILL PROVIDEAs we neared Panchita’s house, we loudly called out for her. She pushed open awooden shutter and, when she recognized me, raised her hands in unmitigated joy.She hurried out into the courtyard to hug both of us. “Panchita,” I said in araised voice (she is partially deaf and blind). “This is Elizabeth. She’s ascientist from San José. She wants to visit with you.”“Oooo!” she whooped. “Of course. Come sit down.” She was wearing a festivelyfrilly dress like the one she wore the first time I met her, but this time itwas green instead of pink. Long, green earrings dangled from her ears, and shehad pulled her gray-tinged hair back with a rhinestone-studded comb. She led usto the two wooden benches that line her porch.Elizabeth quickly established a rapport with Panchita and asked her about herlife as a child and young woman. Panchita told her that she was a descendant ofa Cuban revolutionary hero and that she’d had a beautiful childhood.“In those days, there were no roads in Nicoya. My father owned a guesthouse, andoccasionally mule trains would come by. I woke up at three each morning to makecoffee and tortillas for the men who stayed overnight. I took care of myparents,” she said. Then, turning to me, she scolded congenially, “It’s likethis, Papi. Those who honor their parents are rewarded by God.”Panchita eluded our direct questions about her husband and the father of herchildren. From her answers, we were able to ascertain that she did raise herchildren mostly by herself. They all lived with Panchita’s parents until theydied, then Panchita inherited their farm. There, the family grew most of theirown food. When they needed salt or sugar, Panchita would walk the 18 miles totown and back to get it.“Life was hard those days, Papi.” She always called me Papi. “You can no longercook me with a little bit of water,” she said, referring to her age and that oldtough meat takes longer to cook. As she spoke, she waved a finger at me. Spittleflew from her mouth, and her dangling legs kicked reflexively.At one point during our conversation, her normally festive demeanor turnedserious. She put her hand on my arm; she had an endearing habit of gently,instinctually touching people to make a point. I looked down at her long, smoothfingers and neatly trimmed nails. She wore a dented silver band on her ringfinger.“They killed my son,” she said fixing me with a brown-eyed gaze. The lines inher lightly creased face reflected the sadness of a 50-year-old tragedy. “Whenhe was a beautiful 20-year-old man, he got into a stupid fight with a friend,and he killed my son.” She sat silent for a minute, her dangling legs stillswinging back and forth. “God does everything for a reason, though,” she resumedbrightly. “I am a blessed woman today.”Elizabeth turned to me and smiled in a way that said: “See what I mean?”Another telling story: One day when Panchita was about 70, she was bathing in ariver just south of town. She heard some rustling in the bushes and then noticeda man was watching her. “I rapidly put on my clothes and picked up a stick,” shesaid, swinging an imaginary limb over her head. “And then I chased him down andalmost beat him to death.” She finished the story and her mood turned wistful.“Oh Papi,” she said finally. “That was a very bad thing. I had to ask the priestfor forgiveness. But still, God blesses me.”Late in the morning, the neighbor boy, 10-year-old Luis, arrived, as he doeseach day, to help Panchita catch her free-range chickens and put them in thecoop. Later, her 31-year-old neighbor, Carmen Gómez, stopped by to help Panchitasweep her floors. “I don’t come here because I have to,” she told me when Iasked. “Panchita has a way of making my day happier. Everyone in Hojancha lovesher.”At noon, Panchita told me it was time to make lunch. Elizabeth and I followedher into her simple house: a room with a table and chairs; a bedroom withtattered sheets and blankets, and pictures of Jesus on the wall; and a kitchen,where she led us.The kitchen was simple and pleasant: a small, well-lit room with two windowsthat opened to the yard, a small pantry, a wood counter, a soapstone sink withrunning water, and a small refrigerator. A bowl of bananas and papaya sat on thecounter for easy access, and everything else—beans, onions, garlic, greens,corn, which all required preparation—remained out of sight. Cheese and tomatoeswere the only things in her refrigerator. She had no packaged or processedfoods; everything required preparation except the fresh fruit.Panchita still cooked on a wood-burning fogón, the traditional Chorotega clayoven that looks a bit like a wide-mouthed volcano atop a wooden platform.Elizabeth and I silently watched as Panchita prepared the food. She moved slowlyand deliberately, heating up beans and seasoning them with garlic and onions.From an earthen pot she scooped out grayish corn that had been soaking in limeovernight, rinsed the kernels and ground them with a hand crank into dough. Shepatted out tortillas and roasted them over the open fire. She melted a dollop oflard on an iron griddle and fried eggs. Finally she cut paper-thin slices offresh cheese—an impressive feat given the fact she could barely see the cheese,much less her fingers.In about 30 minutes she presented us with lunch—small portions of beans, corntortillas, and one egg on a small plate. The serving looked huge, but itamounted to about half of what you’d get if you ordered the breakfast special atyour local diner. “Food gives life!” she shouted and told us to sit down andeat. I felt both humbled and privileged to be served a meal prepared by acentenarian. But after much polite arguing, I managed to convince Panchita thatshe and Luis should eat the meal. Elizabeth and I had lunch waiting for us backat the Dorati Lodge.On the walk back, I told Elizabeth that I agreed with her observations regardingfaith and longevity. Panchita’s faith was amazing—her unwavering belief that nomatter how bad things got, God would take care of everything. Indeed, thinkingback, I realized that most of the 200 centenarians I had met believed in asimilar guiding power. The Seventh-day Adventist faith was rooted in a strongfaith tradition; Okinawan elders believed that their deceased ancestors watchedover them; and Sardinians were devout Catholics. Panchita was yet anotherexample, it seemed, of the power of faith. I asked Elizabeth if faith really hasa profound impact on longevity.“Absolutely,” she said. “When Gianni and I were doing our interviews, we noticedthat when you ask the most highly functioning seniors how they are, they alwayssay, ‘I feel good…thanks to God.’ Yet they may be blind, deaf, and their boneshurt. Psychologists call this an external locus of control. In other words, theytend to relinquish control of their lives to God. The fact that God is incontrol of their lives relieves any economic, spiritual, or well-being anxietythey might otherwise have. They go through life with the peaceful certitude thatsomeone is looking out for them.” I had heard of a study that echoed theirfindings: In this study, participants who attended religious services about oncea month or more had up to a 35 percent reduced risk of death for the next 7years.Later in the afternoon, Elizabeth visited Panchita again and asked her some morequestions. “I wasn’t going to share this with you,” she told me that night atdinner when I asked her about her experience with Panchita. “I was alone withthis lovely, magical person. She doesn’t live in a nice home. She’s so poor yetso satisfied with what she has. There was a total acceptance. But I wanted tohelp her anyway. So, I handed her twenty dollars.”“And…what happened?” I asked.“She told me, ‘I had no money to buy food. But I knew God would provide,’squeezing my arm. ‘And now He has.’”DOCTORS’ DIAGNOSISOn the next to last night of the expedition, Gianni and Michel stood up in frontof the team to present their final findings. They had prepared one of theirelaborate pie-chart-and-graph PowerPoint presentations with a soundtrack. Thetwo had been inseparable during the trip. They always sat at the same table withtheir laptops open, discussing their work earnestly, always in French. They werethe first ones up in the morning, they did interviews together, and ended up atthe same table at night, where they consolidated their findings in a giantspreadsheet. They had both made sacrifices to join us in Costa Rica (it tookmonths for Gianni to apply for permission from his university to get the timeoff) and they had both taken a chance that their efforts would bear fruit. Buttoday they were excited, and standing before the team, they looked like two bigkids on a particularly special day of show-and-tell. Michel began by flashing ascreen that read: Costa Rican Blue ZoneFirst Results of the SurveyHojancha, 02/07/07 “We did not know if we’d be successful with our investigations,” Michel began.“We managed to find all the oldest of the old people living in Nicoya, and amongthese, eight females and six males were centenarians. This is important becauseit is not a sample but rather an entire population!” he said triumphantly,making big circular gestures. “And we managed to verify all of their ages—thisis very important—in either the local church baptismal record or in themunicipal hall.”He flashed a series of slides that showed the characteristics of the Nicoyans heinterviewed. “More than half were of Chorotegan descent. They tended to sleepabout eight hours a day. They got maximum exposure to the sun. The long-livedwomen were likely to be the firstborn. And we also noticed that these peoplewere extremely positive, which we can associate with their longevity.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------COOKED CORNCosta Ricans have eaten maize (corn) since the time of the Chorotega Indians.Lime (calcium hydroxide) is used to cook the kernels, which infuses them withhigher concentrations of calcium. But just exposing corn to heat can alsoincrease its nutritional value. A recent Cornell University study found thatcooked corn contains higher levels of antioxidants than raw kernels.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now Gianni took the floor. “In order to assess the Costa Rican centenarians, wedecided to compare them with Sardinian centenarians, about whom we have gooddata,” he began. “What is surprising is the greater fertility of thecentenarians from Costa Rica in comparison to the Sardinians. This does not meanthat these differences are necessarily related to longevity. They might simplyreflect the family structure in the two populations,” he said. Unlike Michel,Gianni’s hands remained folded motionlessly in front of him. Gianni, like mosttrue longevity scientists, was reluctant to make absolute statements. Andbesides, longevity is an exceedingly complex field.“Gianni,” I interjected. “I know that it’s premature to make concreteconclusions, but you’ve studied centenarians for almost two decades. What’s yourgut feeling as to why these Nicoyans are doing so well and living so long?”“One moment please. I’ll show you,” he replied. He displayed bar graphs thatcompared body weight, blood pressure, and the results of physical tests. TheCosta Rican centenarians, as a rule, were taller, weighed less, and had slightlyhigher blood pressure.The Nicoya Peninsula, he and Michel had concluded, was, in fact, among theplaces in the world with the longest-lived populations, and Nicoyans performedsignificantly better on physical tests. Together with the mountainous part ofSardinia, Nicoya had to be considered as the second validated longevity BlueZone.Their trip to Costa Rica had been worth all the trouble, after all.WHAT LITTLE IS SAVEDBefore I left for home, I wanted to accomplish one more thing. Neither CostaRica nor the once-isolated Nicoya had eluded progress. Each year more and moreAmericans were finding their way to Nicoya’s coast, with its dependably dry,sunny winter and its dramatic coastline and white-sand beaches. Young familiescome to Tamarindo in the north for winter vacation; meanwhile the backpackingset heads farther south to beach towns like Montezuma for cheap rooms andexcellent surf.Along with the tourist dollars have come development and an influence on youngerpeople. As with many of the Blue Zones, Nicoya’s longevity culture is adisappearing phenomenon. I wanted to experience it as purely as I could beforeit was gone. Were there any more Nicoyans still living the authentic traditionallifestyle? And if so, could I find them? And could they offer any more insightsinto the region’s incredible longevity?Of course I had Wagner’s manuscript to help me recognize the traditionallifestyle if I found it. In a chapter titled “Settlement and Land Use,” heoffered some glimpses:Men work slowly but steadily in the fields. The workday begins about six in themorning and runs until twelve or sometimes two in the afternoon. Few men workafter two. Men may observe a break about nine in the morning to eat a little andto drink from the nambiro (water vessel). After the work is over for the day,they are content to sit about until dark, smoking, conversing, or napping.In the comments and conclusion section he wrote:The individual lives in close relation with a world of plants and still turnsdirectly to nature for the satisfaction of his wants. The subsistence economy,and the resources and techniques it employs, strongly resembles the Choroteganpattern at the time of conquest. Although gods, rulers, tongues, and even raceshave succeeded one another, the old basic ways of life persist, and in the dailybusiness of living, local forms and traditions maintain a stubborn continuity….I shared this passage with our ever resourceful Costa Rican assistant, Jorge,and asked him if he could find anything like it. “Give me a day,” he said. Thatnight, he returned to the Dorati beaming. He’d spent an afternoon in Nicoya citytalking to seniors, museum curators and domestic workers who typically come fromthe surrounding countryside. He’d gotten a lead from a policeman. “There’s oneplace left,” Jorge chirped in Spanish. “It’s in the hills above the city ofNicoya. A place called Juan Díaz. We’ll need to walk several hours.”image [Images/239.jpg]This Nicoyan woman bakes tortillas and walks five miles to the village to sellthem.The next day, following a map the policeman had drawn, we drove up a steep,rutted road that snaked into the forested hills along the peninsula’s spine. Ata roadside shack we parked and got out. Three little kids stared at us as westarted walking along a footpath that led into the bush.We hiked for about an hour and a half through a corridor of dense vegetation.The sun beat down and sweat soaked our clothes. Occasionally the jungle wouldopen and we’d catch a sweeping view of Nicoya, spilling down the mountain totoast-brown flats that stretched all the way to the slate-blue line of thePacific Ocean.Perhaps an hour into our trek, we rounded a bend and came upon a two-room shackoutside of which a shirtless man was fiercely chopping wood in a small jungleclearing. “Hello, I’m Dan Buettner,” I said, extending my hand. “Do you knowwhere we might find the village of Juan Díaz?” He put his sweaty, calloused handin mine and let me shake it. He wore rolled-up trousers and rubber boots withoutsocks; his ripped, tea-colored torso glistened with sweat. I guessed him to beabout 60. “I’m Juvenil Muñoz, and you’re in Juan Díaz,” he replied flatly. Ilooked around. We were in a small jungle clearing. A flock of chickens, twocows, and an ox roamed freely. This was a town?“May we stop for a visit?” I asked. Juvenil looked at Jorge, then back at me. Helooked as if he thought we were playing a trick on him, but in the typicalunquestioning character of the region, he replied, “Why not?” and dropped hisax. His house looked much like Panchita’s—except it lacked running water andelectricity. The kitchen looked pure Chorotega: a fogón, corn kernels soaking ina black earthen pot, hollowed gourds for drinking, a packed-dirt floor, a dogsniffing for crumbs. The second room was for both sleeping and storing feed.He dutifully answered our questions: What do you eat? (“Beans, tortillas, fruit,and once a year, beef when I butcher a cow.”) When do you go to bed? (“When thesun sets.”) When do you wake up? (“When the sun rises.”) He kept looking over athis ax, as if it were waiting for him. “I should finish my work,” he saidapologetically.After three weeks in Nicoya, it seemed perfectly natural of me to ask to see hishouse, and natural that he’d say yes. But this was the first time I’d stopped tothink about what I’d do if two sweaty strangers stopped at my house, interruptedmy work, and started asking me inane questions. I’d probably call the police.“Of course,” I said. “I’m sorry for the interruption.”Juvenil went back to his wood chopping, heaving his enormous ax in the air andbringing it down mightily. “By the way,” I asked leaving. “How old are you?”“I just completed my 90th year,” he replied, not looking at me. Then he broughtdown his ax with a whoosh and thud that sent up plumes of woodchips.A half hour further up the path we came to the second house. The scene lookedexactly as Wagner had described Nicoya a half century ago: crude wood buildings,a raised chicken coop, a barn the size of a single-car garage, a mule-drivensugar cane press, and a small house of vertical planks. The tin roof providedthe only hint that the 20th century had come and gone. An old man nappedlanguidly in a hammock on the porch. Inside, we could hear talking and laughing.“Buenas tardes,” Jorge called out. The talking stopped abruptly. An old portlywoman wearing a housedress and an apron pulled aside the sheet covering thefront door and looked out at us. “My name is Jorge Vinda and this is DanBuettner, a journalist. Can we come in?”“Si, si,” she said in a “What are you standing out there for?” sort of way.Inside it smelled like roasted corn and coffee. A small fire burned in thefogón. On a shelf, pottery jugs held drinking water. A calendar hung on onewall. A cool, dry breeze blew through the room from open shutters, sendingcurtains fluttering. A middle-aged couple sat at a wooden table staring at uswith a bewildered look. Jorge introduced us and explained our project.This was the farm of 91-year-old Ildifonso Zuniga and his wife, Segundina.Ildifonso was napping in a hammock on the porch; Segundina was hosting theguests. Ananias Baltoano and his wife, Aida—the middle-aged couple—had stoppedby for a visit, which seemed normal enough until I learned that this visit hadoccasioned a two-hour, five-mile walk. They were, in the words of Segundina,neighbors. She told us to sit down, poured us a cup of coffee, and cut us giantpieces of sweet cornbread. We were now part of the family.Instead of launching into interview mode, as I usually do, I just sipped mycoffee and listened. The conversation moved languidly from the weather to thecondition of Aida’s 12-year-old daughter, who had broken her leg (“The poorlittle thing!” Segundina exclaimed.), to the birth of a neighbor boy, to thebean harvest. “We cut down bush and plow. I brought in over 50 kilos last week,”said Ananias, who was a timid-sounding man with ruddy cheeks and jet-black hair.The conversation served no purpose, it seemed, other than to connect thesefriends and generate some idle entertainment. I wrote in my notebook: “The roomhas a feeling of timeless congeniality.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------NICOYA FACTS * Nation: Costa Rica * Location: Peninsula on Costa Rica’s Pacific Coast * Nicoya Population: ca 47,000--------------------------------------------------------------------------------After a quarter of an hour, I finally butted in. I told my hosts what we weredoing with the Blue Zones and admitted that we’d come here because we’d heardthat we could maybe see how people in Nicoya have lived for centuries. Theynodded their heads. “For example, could you tell me how a typical day unfolds?”“Well,” said Aida, who wore a tattered brown dress and her gray-flecked hairunder a scarf. She had the pink-blushed countenance of a face you’d see in a16th-century Flemish oil painting. “We wake up when the sun rises. I makebreakfast for the family and then Ananias takes our boys into the fields.Meanwhile the girls and I stay home and clean up. At noon or so, the men comeback. We eat our ‘strong’ meal and then relax. We maybe visit someone like todayor someone visits us. We have a light dinner. Usually we’re in bed by 8:30,” sheconcluded. “Since we don’t have TV, there’s not much for us to do after sunset.”Segundina poured us another cup of coffee, not bothering to ask if we wantedone. A cool breeze blew through, fluttering the curtains. Ananias drew in a deepbreath as if taking a long drink of water on a hot day.“And for food, what does one eat in Juan Díaz?”“Beans and rice,” replied Aida, and after a well-timed pause added: “Or rice andbeans. It depends how we feel.” Everyone laughed.“We eat what God provides,” Ananias said, now serious. “Eggs, rice, beans.Sometimes we kill a chicken.”“How often do you eat meat?”“It depends how the pocketbook is,” Ananias replied, patting his pants. “If it’sgood, maybe once or twice a week.” Later I learned that their only annual cashincome came from the couple hundred pounds of sugar the village press producedeach year.“We don’t need much,” Aida interjected, heading off an implication of poverty.“We’re satisfied….” Here Aida’s answer trailed off and she fell silent for amoment. “You have to keep busy,” she resumed, now answering a question I did notpose. “When people have too much time they get involved with vices. Here we haveenough to do. We stay busy enough to keep the Devil away, but not so much thatwe get stressed. It’s a clean, pure life.”“But don’t you ever get bored?” I looked around. There was no TV, no radio, orelectronic entertainment of any sort. I could not think of a single place I’dvisited during the past decade—not the Sahara, the Amazon, the Congo—that didn’tat least have satellite TV. “What do you do to entertain yourself?”“I find a patch of shade and eat an orange,” she answered, not skipping a beat.Jorge and I hung out for another hour or so. For once, I decided to turn off thejournalist mode and just experience the afternoon. We drank more cups of coffeeand ate another piece of cornbread. I showed my new friends wallet photos of myfamily, and they swooned.Soon talk gravitated back to village life, the forthcoming rains in May, theharvest later on, and then a community celebration in September. I resisted theurge to look at my watch or to think about what I wanted to write about thisexperience or about checking my email. I finally gave up and said I had toleave.“Already?” said Segundina. “You should stay for dinner.”Jorge and I made our way back toward the Dorati Lodge. It was now late afternoonand the cooler, downhill hike felt good. We jumped into in a van that wasblast-furnace hot from the afternoon sun. Jorge turned the key, and the enginestarted with a jolting roar. A CD began to blare. I quickly turned it off androlled down the windows. We coasted pleasantly back down the hill until wereached the main road. There we accelerated abruptly and joined the stream ofcars headed south.We passed a string of truck-stop bars that doubled as brothels, the NuevoTempique Hotel (aire acondicionado!), the cement factory with its mountainsidestrip mine, and, near Nicoya city, the “Gran Apertura” of the Burger King—thepeninsula’s first. I regarded it all with mild disgust. “Enduring” just onequotidian afternoon in Juan Díaz had recalibrated my tolerance for our world’sdin and made the idea of quietly eating an orange in the shade of a tree seemgenuinely appealing.I now wish I had accepted Segundina’s invitation and stayed for rice, beans, andmore simple conversation. I imagined stepping outside and looking up into thestar-spangled cobalt night, unsullied by light pollution, having a good night’ssleep in a simple bed, and waking with the sun for a day of hard work as Ananiasor Juvenil or Don Faustino have for their entire lives.I reached into my courier bag for a bottle of water and saw Wagner’s article,which I’d bound with a green cover. I plucked it out and flipped through it. Onthe last pages, I read something I’d highlighted earlier:The commercial revolution is coming to Nicoya, and the growing availability andprestige of commercial products are creating a new demand for money which can beobtained only by producing crops or manufactured goods for sale. The smallsubsistence farmer, fully occupied with the task of securing a bare livelihood,possesses neither the land necessary for growing commercial crops, the time totend them, nor the capital to finance the technological improvements essentialfor successful commercial production…Little attention has been paid to thepossibilities of extending the cultivation of the crops of the Nicoyan garden,which require little land and slight care and yield abundantly…When the old waysdisappear, as perhaps they must, it is regrettable that so little is saved fromthem, so that those who practice them suffer the penalty of obsolescence, as thepoor folk of a new and more efficient world.For nine months, our team of scientists and researchers studied the amazingpeople of this tiny peninsula in northern Costa Rica. Their choices andtraditions revealed new insights into the mysteries of longevity. Their uniquephysical environment coupled with their time-honored lifestyle have cometogether to yield the world’s healthiest, longest-lived people, the inhabitantsof a new, true Blue Zone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------COSTA RICA’S LONGEVITY SECRETSTry these common practices from Costa Rica’s Blue Zone.Have a plan de vida.Successful centenarians have a strong sense of purpose. They feel needed andwant to contribute to a greater good.Drink hard water.Nicoyan water has the country’s highest calcium content, perhaps explaining thelower rates of heart disease, as well as stronger bones and fewer hip fractures.Keep a focus on family.Nicoyan centenarians tend to live with their families, and children orgrandchildren provide support and sense of purpose and belonging.Eat a light dinner.Eating fewer calories appears to be one of the surest ways to add years to yourlife. Nicoyans eat a light dinner early in the evening.Maintain social networks.Nicoyan centenarians get frequent visits from neighbors. They know how tolisten, laugh, and appreciate what they have.Keep hard at work.Centenarians seem to have enjoyed physical work all of their lives. They findjoy in everyday physical chores.Get some sensible sun.Nicoyans regularly take in the sunshine, which helps their bodies producevitamin D for strong bones and healthy body function. Vitamin D deficiency isassociated with a host of problems, such as osteoporosis and heart disease, butregular, “smart” sun exposure (about 15 minutes on the legs and arms) can helpsupplement your diet and make sure you’re getting enough of this vital nutrient.Embrace a common history.Modern Nicoyans’ roots to the indigenous Chorotega and their traditions haveenabled them to remain relatively free of stress. Their traditional diet offortified maize and beans may be the best nutritional combination for longevitythe world has ever known.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"6YOUR PERSONAL BLUE ZONE"},{"pageContent":"YOUR PERSONAL BLUE ZONEPutting the Blue Zones Lessons to Work in Your LifeYOU’VE JUST READ STORIES ABOUT THE remarkable people of the world’s Blue Zones.You’ve taken the time to get to know them and perhaps feel inspired by theirexperiences. Maybe you’ve noticed that the world’s longevity all-stars not onlylive longer, they also tend to live better. They have strong connections withtheir family and friends. They’re active. They wake up in the morning knowingthat they have a purpose, and the world, in turn, reacts to them in a way thatpropels them along. An overwhelming majority of them still enjoy life. Andthere’s not a grump in the bunch. But what does all this mean for you?If you live the average American lifestyle, you may never reach your potentialmaximum lifespan. You might even fall short by as much as a decade. But what ifyou could follow a simple program that could help you feel younger, lose weight,maximize your mental sharpness, and keep your body working as long as possible?Indeed, what if you could get back that extra decade of healthy life that youmay unknowingly be squandering?This chapter presents the “Power Nine”—the lessons from the Blue Zones, across-cultural distillation of the world’s best practices in health andlongevity. While these practices are only associated with longevity and don’tnecessarily increase it, by adopting them you’ll be adopting healthy habits thatshould stack the deck in your favor.FIRST STEPSStart down the road to longevityTo begin, go to the Blue Zones website at www.bluezones.com. There, you’ll findthe the Vitality Compass™, a tool that asks you 33 questions and, based on youranswers, calculates 1) your potential life expectancy at your current age, 2)your healthy life expectancy—the number of good years you can expect to live, 3)the number of extra years you’re likely to gain if you optimize your lifestyle,and 4) a customized list of suggestions to help you with that plan. Completingthe Vitality Compass™ is the first step to figuring out where you are on yourpersonal longevity journey.The second step is to create a pro-longevity environment—your own personal BlueZone—in your home. The goal will be to make positive behaviors convenient and,in some cases, unavoidable. Our strategies will put you in the way ofpro-longevity practices so that if you make the effort now, you won’t have tothink about it later. We’ll recommend nine deceptively simple but powerfulthings you can do today to create a lasting Blue Zone in your own life. They’redesigned to reinforce the lessons you’ve learned in this book without yourhaving to keep track of anything.The Power Nine covers the following life domains: What to do to optimize yourlifestyle for a longer, healthier life; how to think; how to eat; and how tobuild social relationships that support your good habits. These lessons arepatterned after the lifestyles of Blue Zones centenarians but modified to fitthe Western lifestyle.Research shows that if you dedicate yourself to a new practice for as little asfive weeks, the practice is more likely to become a habit. (Another school ofthought, called Relapse Prevention, suggests that for indulgent or addictivebehaviors—overeating, gambling, drug use—the first three months of the initialchange in behavior are crucial. If you make it past those first 12 weeks, yourchances of relapse are greatly reduced.) So there’s probably a time frame forbehaviors to become habitual that ranges from 5 to 12 weeks.Dr. Leslie Lytle of the University of Minnesota, a registered dietitian with aPh.D. in health behavior, says that all of the habits we’re recommending arerelatively easy to adopt once you commit to making them work. She offers thisadvice to help you succeed: Pick the low-hanging fruit. All nine lessons offerthe chance to gain more good years, so pick the ones that are easiest to dofirst. For example, try something you may have been successful at doing in thepast. If you could do it then, focusing on it now might be easier. Another tip:Don’t try more than three secrets at a time. If you work on all nine once,you’ll be more likely to fail. Start with three that have the best chance ofsuccess, and then gradually add more as a pattern of success emerges. Lytle alsorecommends that you enlist a friend or family member in your program. If youhold each other accountable to a 12-week goal, you’ll have a greater chance ofsucceeding. Remember to reward yourself, she says. Don’t focus on your slip-ups;behavior change is hard at first. Focus on your small victories and celebratethem!At first blush, this à la carte approach may seem too easy to work. But itreflects what current research tells us about effective long-term behavioralchange. We’re not proposing a timed program in this book because many peoplefind it difficult to follow a highly prescriptive plan. Our lives are busy andoften complicated, and a rigid plan with weekly goals may be too difficult tofollow.Early successes help keep us motivated, while early failure can make anythingtoo difficult. If a nine-week program demands that you do something as simple aswalk ten minutes a day during the first week, but you know you have troublewalking or you live in a neighborhood where you don’t feel comfortable, you maynot be able to succeed at that small change, and the whole plan may fall by thewayside. Even if we are committed to change, failing early can lead todiscouragement and quitting.Our approach allows you to pick and choose among the strategies that most appealto you from the start. We emphasize changing your environment to help shape goodhabits. See where you can make small changes that will help create your BlueZone. It’s much easier to maintain healthy habits if your environment is set upfor them.LESSON ONE: MOVE NATURALLYBe active without having to think about itLongevity all-stars don’t run marathons or compete in triathlons; they don’ttransform themselves into weekend warriors on Saturday morning. Instead, theyengage in regular, low-intensity physical activity, often as part of a dailywork routine. Male centenarians in Sardinia’s Blue Zone worked most of theirlives as shepherds, a profession that involved miles of hiking every day.Okinawans garden for hours each day, growing food for their tables. Adventiststake nature walks. These are the kinds of activities longevity experts have inmind when they talk about exercising for the long haul. “The data suggests thata moderate level of exercise that is sustained is quite helpful,” says Dr.Robert Kane.An ideal routine, which you should discuss with your doctor, would include acombination of aerobic, balancing, and muscle-strengthening activities. Dr.Robert Butler recommends exercising the core muscle groups at least twice aweek. Balance is also important since falls are a common cause of injuries anddeath among seniors (in the U.S.A., about one in three adults over age 65 fallseach year). Just practicing standing on one foot during the day (maybe whenbrushing your teeth) would be a small step toward improving your balance.Yoga, when done properly, will help increase balance. It also strengthens allmuscle groups, increases flexibility, is good for your joints, and can lessenlower back pain. It may also provide the same kind of social support andspiritual centering that religions do.In all longevity cultures, regular, low-intensity activity satisfies all of theabove, while going easy on the knees and hips. Dr. Kane says the name of thegame here is sustaining the effort. “You’ve got to be a miler, not a sprinter.You can’t say, ‘This year I’m really going to exercise like hell, and I can takeit easy next year because I’ve done my exercise.’” The overall goal is to getinto the habit of doing at least 30 minutes (ideally at least 60 minutes) ofexercise at least five times a week. It doesn’t have to be all at once, althoughthat seems to be better.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON ONE STRATEGIESTo get moving in your Blue Zone, try some of these tips.Inconvenience yourself.By making life a little tougher, you can easily add more activity to your days.Little things, like getting up to change the channel or taking the stairs, canadd up to a more active lifestyle. Get rid of as many of the following aspossible: TV remote control, garage door opener, electric can opener, electricblender, snow blower, and power lawn mower. Be ready to use as many of these aspossible: bicycle, comfortable walking shoes, rake, broom, snow shovel.Have fun. Keep moving.Make a list of physical activities you enjoy. Rather than exercising for thesake of exercising, make your lifestyle active. Ride a bicycle instead ofdriving. Walk to the store. At work, take a walking break instead of a coffeeand donut break. Build activity into your routine and lifestyle. Do what youenjoy. Forget the gym if you don’t like it—you’re not likely to go there if it’sa chore. Don’t force yourself to do things you dislike.Walk.This is the one activity that all successful centenarians did—and do—almostdaily. It’s free, easier on the joints than running, always accessible, invitescompany, and if you’re walking briskly, may have the same cardiovascularbenefits as running. After a hard day, a walk can relieve stress; after a meal,it can aid digestion.Make a date.Getting out and about can be more fun with other people. Make a list of peopleto walk with; combining walking and socializing may be the best strategy forsetting yourself up for the habit. Knowing someone else is counting on you maymotivate you to keep a walking date. A good place to start is to think, whosecompany do I enjoy? Who do I like to spend time with? Who has about the samelevel of physical ability?Plant a garden.Working in a garden requires frequent, low-intensity, full-range-of-motionactivity. You dig to plant, bend to weed, and carry to harvest. Gardening canrelieve stress. And you emerge from the season with fresh vegetables—a BlueZones trifecta!Enroll in a yoga class.Be sure to practice it at least twice weekly.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON TWO: HARA HACHI BUPainlessly cut calories by 20 percentIf you’re ever lucky enough to eat with Okinawan elders, you’ll invariably hearthem intone this Confucian-inspired adage before eating: hara hachi bu—areminder to stop eating when their stomachs are 80 percent full. Even today,their average daily intake is only about 1,900 calories (Sardinianstraditionally ate a similarly lean diet of about 2,000 calories a day).Dr. Craig Willcox postulates that this simple but powerful practice may amountto a painless version of caloric restriction—a strategy that has been shown toprolong life in laboratory animals and has been associated with better hearthealth in humans. Some of the benefits of cutting calories may lie in reducedcellular damage from free radicals. But there’s another happy by-product: Youlose weight. Losing just 10 percent of one’s body weight helps to lower bloodpressure and cholesterol, which reduces the risk of heart disease. But how do weachieve this? Most of us don’t live on a Japanese archipelago or surrounded bythousand-year-old cultural norms.Our traditional solution for an expanding waistline is to start a diet. None ofthe centenarians we met were ever on a diet, and none of them were ever obese.“No diet yet studied works for most people,” says University of Minnesota’s Dr.Bob Jeffery. “You can get a diet to work for about 6 months, and then about 90percent of all dieters run out of gas.” Even the best programs are effective inthe long run for only a small percentage of participants.A secret to eating right for the long run is emulating the environment andhabits of the world’s longest-lived people. Dr. Brian Wansink, author ofMindless Eating, is conducting perhaps the most innovative research on whatmakes us eat the way we do. As Okinawan elders instinctively know, the amount offood we eat is less a function of feeling full and more a matter of what’saround us. We overeat because of circumstances—friends, family, packages,plates, names, numbers, labels, lights, colors, candles, shapes, smells,distractions, cupboards, and containers.In one of Wansink’s experiments, he invited a group of people to view a tape andgave each one either a one-pound bag of M&Ms or a half-pound bag of M&Ms to eatas they pleased. After the video, he asked both groups to return their uneatenportions of candy. Those given a one-pound bag ate an average of 137 M&Ms, whilethose given a half-pound bag ate only 71. We typically consume more from bigpackages. Wansink’s lab examined 47 products in this experiment, and the samething happened over and over. He also found that the size of the plates andglasses we use has a profound impact on how much we consume. Aboutthree-quarters of what we eat is served on plates, bowls, or in glasses.Wansink’s experiments showed that people drink 25 percent to 30 percent more ifthey drink from a short, wide glass rather than from a tall, narrow one, and 31percent more if they eat from a 34-ounce bowl compared to a 17-ounce one.While most Americans keep eating until their stomachs feel full, Okinawans stopas soon as they no longer feel hungry. “There’s a significant calorie gapbetween when an American says, ‘I’m full’ and an Okinawan says, ‘I’m no longerhungry,’” explains Wansink. “We gain weight insidiously, not stuffing ourselves,but eating a little bit too much each day—mindlessly.”Most of us have a caloric “set point” of sorts, a level of calories we canconsume each day without gaining weight. We tend to gain weight by eating justslightly beyond the caloric set point week after week. For most of us, thesolution is to eat enough so that we’re no longer hungry, but not so much thatwe’re full. Wansink asserts that we can eat about 20 percent more or 20 percentless without really being aware of it. And that 20 percent swing is thedifference between losing weight and gaining it.image [Images/260.jpg]Okinawans, like this 88-year-old fisherman, often remind themselves not toovereat.Food volume is only one part of the equation. The other is calories. A typicalfast-food meal of a large hamburger, large fries, and a large soft drinkcontains nearly 1,500 calories. Craig and Bradley Willcox estimate that theaverage Okinawan meal has one-fifth the caloric density. In other words, ahamburger with fries and a heaping plate of Okinawan stir-fried tofu and greensmay have the same volume, but the Okinawan meal will have one-fifth thecalories.Most people are terrible at estimating how many calories they’ve eaten today,yesterday, or last week, Wansink cautions. Caloric content of food is typicallyunderestimated by about 20 percent. The larger the meal, the worse theunderestimation. In one of his studies, Wansink had people estimate how manycalories were in a meal. It actually contained about 1,800 calories, but theaverage person’s guess was around 1,000 calories. The trick to maintaining ahealthy weight is to eat foods with low caloric density. If we look at our foodand think it will fill us, it probably will. As Wansink writes, volume trumpscalories.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON TWO STRATEGIESTo help follow the 80 percent rule in your Blue Zone, try the following tips.Serve and store.People who serve themselves at the counter, then put the food away before takingtheir plate to the table, eat about 14 percent less than when they take smalleramounts and go back for seconds and thirds. Learn to recognize when you haveenough on your plate to fill your stomach 80 percent.Make food look bigger.People who eat a quarter-pound hamburger that has been made to look like ahalf-pounder with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions feel equally full after eating.Students who drank a smoothie whipped to twice the volume with the same caloriesate less for lunch 30 minutes later, and reported feeling fuller.Use small vessels.Drop your dinner plates and big glasses off at a charity, and buy smaller platesand tall, narrow glasses. You’re likely to eat significantly less without eventhinking about it.Make snacking a hassle.Avoid tempting foods. Put candy bowls, cookie jars, and other temptations out ofsight. Hide them in the cupboard or pantry. Wrap tempting leftovers in an opaquecontainer.Buy smaller packages.When given large packages of spaghetti, sauce, and meat, Wansink’s subjectsconsumed 23 percent more (about 150 calories) than when they were given mediumpackages.Give yourself a daily reminder.The bathroom scale can be a simple yet powerful reminder not to overeat. Put thescale in your way so you can’t avoid a daily weigh-in. In fact, weighingyourself is one of the most surefire ways to reduce your weight and keep it offin the long run. One study that followed 3,026 women who were trying to loseweight and keep it off found that after 2 years, women who weighed themselvesdaily lost an average of 12 pounds. Women who never weighed in actually gainedan average of 5 pounds. In other words, at the end of 2 years, women who weighedthemselves every day were (on average) about 17 pounds lighter than the womenwho never weighed themselves.Eat more slowly.Eating faster usually results in eating more. Slowing down allows time to senseand react to cues telling us we’re no longer hungry.Focus on food.A guaranteed way to eat mindlessly is to do so while watching your favorite showon TV or while emailing a friend at the computer. If you’re going to eat, justeat. You’ll eat more slowly, consume less, and savor your food more.Have a seat.Many of us eat on the run, in the car, standing in front of the refrigerator, orwhile walking to our next meeting. This means we don’t notice what we’re eatingor how fast we’re eating it. Making a habit of eating only while sittingdown—eating purposefully—better enables us to appreciate the tastes and texturesof our food. We’ll eat more slowly and feel more nourished when we’re through.Eat early.In the Blue Zones, the biggest meal of the day is typically eaten during thefirst half of the day. Nicoyans, Okinawans, and Sardinians eat their biggestmeal at midday, while Adventists consume many of their calories for breakfast.All Blue Zone residents eat their smallest meal of the day in late afternoon orearly evening. Some Adventists believe that if you eat a big breakfast with theright ingredients (whole grains, fruits, milk, nut butter), you’ll fuel yourbody for most of the day and have fewer cravings for sugary or fatty foods.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON THREE: PLANT SLANTAvoid meat and processed foodsMost centenarians in Nicoya, Sardinia, and Okinawa never had the chance todevelop the habit of eating processed foods, soda pop, or salty snacks. For muchof their lives, they ate small portions of unprocessed foods. They avoidedmeat—or more accurately, didn’t have access to it—except on rare occasions.Traditional Sardinians, Nicoyans, and Okinawans ate what they produced in theirgardens, supplemented by staples: durum wheat (Sardinia), sweet potato(Okinawa), or maize (Nicoya). Strict Adventists avoid meat entirely. They taketheir dietary cues directly from Genesis 1:29…Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is onthe surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; itshall be food for you.”Indeed, scientists analyzed six different studies of thousands of vegetariansand found that those that restrict meat are associated with living longer. Somepeople worry that a plant-based diet may not provide enough protein and iron.The fact is, says Dr. Leslie Lytle, that those of us over 19 years of age needonly 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram (2.2 pounds) of our weight, whichfor most of us would amount to only 50 to 80 grams (1.8 to 2.8 ounces) ofprotein daily.“Our bodies can’t store protein,” she says. “Extra protein gets converted tocalories, and if not needed for activity or to maintain our bodies, iteventually becomes fat. While we don’t need a lot of protein in our diets, weshould eat some protein at every meal. Protein helps us feel fuller, and helpsus avoid the peaks and valleys in our blood sugar levels that make us feelhungry.” Similarly, most of us (except pre-menopausal women) can get plenty ofiron from fortified grains. Too much iron can actually be bad for us because itmay play a role in generating oxygen-free radicals.Beans, whole grains, and garden vegetables are the cornerstones of all theselongevity diets. Sardinian shepherds take semolina flatbread into the pastureswith them. Nicoyans eat corn tortillas at every meal. And whole grain is part ofthe Adventist diet. Whole grains deliver fiber, antioxidants, potentialanti-cancer agents (insoluble fiber), cholesterol reducers, and clot blockers,plus essential minerals. Beans (legumes) also provide a cornerstone to Blue Zonemeals. Diets rich in legumes are associated with fewer heart attacks and lesscolon cancer. Legumes are a good dietary source of healthy flavonoids and fiber(which can reduce the risk of heart attack) and are also an excellent nonanimalsource of protein.Tofu (bean curd), a daily feature in the Okinawan diet, has been compared tobread in France or potatoes in Eastern Europe, the difference being that whileone cannot live by bread or potatoes alone, tofu is an almost uniquely perfectfood: low in calories, high in protein, rich in minerals, devoid of cholesterol,eco-friendly, and complete in the amino acids necessary for human sustenance. Anexcellent source of protein without the side effects of meat, tofu contains acompound, phytoestrogen, which may provide heart-protective properties to women.In addition, phytoestrogen seems to modestly lower cholesterol and promotehealthy blood vessels.All of which is not to say that people who live a long time don’t eat meat:Festive meals in Sardinia include lots of meat. Okinawans slaughter pigs duringlunar New Year festivals. And Nicoyans raise family pigs as well. But meat istypically eaten only a few times a month. And most warnings concern red meat orprocessed meat like bacon. Both Dr. Robert Kane and Dr. Robert Butler say thatwhen establishing a diet, it’s important to balance calories between complexcarbohydrates, fats, and proteins, minimizing trans fats, saturated fats, andsalt.“The key is taking in what you need and avoiding the extremes,” explains Dr.Kane. “You could go to a nonanimal diet, but an awful lot of vegetarians take inmore cholesterol through cheeses and milk and various products than they everwould take in eating meat at a modest level.” Oddly, pork was common to three ofthe four Blue Zones diets. But it was not eaten regularly. Nuts are perhaps themost impressive of all “longevity foods.” Recent findings from a large study ofSeventh-day Adventists show that those who ate nuts at least five times a weekhad a rate of heart disease that was half that of those who rarely ate nuts. Ahealth claim about nuts is among the first qualified claims permitted by theFood and Drug Administration. In 2003, the FDA allowed a “qualified healthclaim” that read: “Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating1.5 ounces per day of most nuts as part of a diet low in saturated fat andcholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.”Studies have indicated that nuts may help protect the heart by reducing totalblood cholesterol levels. In a large, ongoing population study from HarvardUniversity’s School of Public Health, people who often ate nuts had lower risksof coronary heart disease than those who rarely or never ate nuts. The AdventistHealth Study (AHS) showed that the person who ate nuts at least five times perweek, two ounces per serving, lived on average about two years longer than thosewho didn’t eat nuts.“We don’t know if there’s something magical in nuts or if it’s that people whoare eating nuts are not eating junk food. But the positive effect is clear fromthe data,” says Dr. Gary Fraser, director of the AHS study. One explanationmight be that nuts are rich in monounsaturated fat and soluble fiber, both ofwhich tend to lower LDL cholesterol, he says. They are also relatively goodsources of vitamin E and other possibly heart-protective nutrients. The bestnuts are almonds, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, hazelnuts, walnuts, and some pinenuts. Brazil nuts, cashews, and macadamias have a little more saturated fat andare less desirable. But all nuts are good.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON THREE STRATEGIESTry these tips to incorporate more plants in your diet.Eat four to six vegetable servings daily.Blue Zone diets always include at least two vegetables at each meal.Limit intake of meat.The centenarians in the Blue Zones consume limited quantities of meat. Toemulate their diet, try to limit serving meat to twice weekly, and serve noportion larger than a deck of cards.Showcase fruits and vegetables.Put a beautiful fruit bowl in the middle of your kitchen table. At the bottom ofit, leave a note that reads “Fill Me.” Instead of hiding vegetables in therefrigerator compartment that says “Produce,” put them front and center onshelves where you can see them.Lead with beans.Beans are a cornerstone of each of the Blue Zone diets. Make beans—or tofu—thecenterpiece of lunches and dinners.Eat nuts every day.The Adventist Health Study shows that it doesn’t matter what kind of nuts youeat to help extend your life expectancy. Caution: A 1-ounce serving of nutstypically ranges from 165 to 200 calories, so 2 ounces could be almost 400calories.Stock up.Keep nuts available in your home, ideally in packages of two ounces or less.(You might want to store them in the refrigerator to keep oils fresh.) Or keep acan of nuts in the office for an afternoon snack, which may help avoid snackingright before dinner.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON FOUR: GRAPES OF LIFEDrink red wine (in moderation)Epidemiological studies seem to show that people who have a daily drink per dayof beer, wine, or spirits may accrue some health benefits. But the secrets ofthe Blue Zones suggest that consistency and moderation are key. In Okinawa, it’sa daily glass of sake with friends. In Sardinia, it’s a glass of dark red winewith each meal and whenever friends meet.image [Images/268.jpg]Sardinians share a toast with glasses of Cannonau, a locally produced red winethat has higher concentrations of polyphenols.A daily drink or two has been associated with lower rates of heart disease, butalcohol use has also been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer, forinstance. It does appear to reduce stress and the damaging effects of chronicinflammation. What’s more, having a glass of wine with a meal creates an“event,” and thus makes it more likely you’ll eat more slowly.Red wine offers an extra bonus in that it contains artery-scrubbing polyphenolsthat may help fight arteriosclerosis. For an extra antioxidant bump, choose aSardinian Cannonau. Beware, however, of the toxic effects of alcohol on theliver, brain, and other organs—along with increased risk of accidents—when dailyconsumption exceeds a glass or two. In that case, the risks of drinking canoutweigh any health benefits. A friend recently asked me if he could save up allweek and drink 14 glasses of wine on Saturday night. The answer is no.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON FOUR STRATEGIESIntroduce a glass of wine into a daily routine.Buy a case of high-quality red wine.The Sardinians quaff Cannonau in their Blue Zone. This variety might be hard tofind in parts of the United States, but any dark red wine should do.Treat yourself to a “Happy Hour.”Set up yours to include a glass of wine, nuts as an appetizer, and a gatheringof friends or time with a spouse.Take it easy.A serving or two per day of red wine is the most you need to drink to takeadvantage of its health benefits. Overdoing it negates any benefits you mightenjoy, so drink in moderation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON FIVE: PURPOSE NOWTake time to see the big pictureOkinawans call it ikigai, and Nicoyans call it plan de vida, but in bothcultures the phrase essentially translates to “why I wake up in the morning.”The strong sense of purpose possessed by older Okinawans may act as a bufferagainst stress and help reduce their chances of suffering from Alzheimer’sdisease, arthritis, and stroke.Dr. Robert Butler and collaborators led an NIH-funded study that looked at thecorrelation between having a sense of purpose and longevity. His 11-year studyfollowed highly functioning people between the ages of 65 and 92 and found thatindividuals who expressed a clear goal in life—something to get up for in themorning, something that made a difference—lived longer and were sharper thanthose who did not. It was also reported that immediately following December 31,1999, demographers saw a spike in deaths among elders. These older people, inother words, may have willed themselves to stay alive into the new millennium.A sense of purpose may come from something as simple as seeing that children orgrandchildren grow up well. Purpose can come from a job or a hobby, especiallyif you can immerse yourself completely in it. Claremont University psychologistDr. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi best describes this feeling in his book, Flow: ThePsychology of Optimal Experience. He defines flow as a Zen-like state of totaloneness with the activity at hand in which you feel fully immersed in whatyou’re doing. It’s characterized by a sense of freedom, enjoyment, fulfillment,and skill, and while you’re in it, temporal concerns (time, food, ego/self,etc.) are typically ignored. If you can identify the activity that gives youthis sense of flow and make it the focus of your job or hobby, it can alsobecome your sense of purpose.A new activity can give you purpose as well. Learning a musical instrument or anew language gives you a double bonus, since both have been shown to help keepyour brain sharper longer. “Exercising your brain is important,” says Dr. ThomasPerls of Boston University Medical School. “Doing things that are novel andcomplex. Once you get good at them, and they are no longer novel, then you moveon to something else. So you’re kind of doing strength training for the brain,and that has been shown to decrease your rate of memory loss, and maybe evendecrease the rate at which one might develop Alzheimer’s disease.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON FIVE STRATEGIESTo realize your purpose, try the following tips.Craft a personal mission statement.If you don’t have a sense of purpose, how do you find it? Articulating yourpersonal mission statement can be a good start. Begin by answering this questionin a single, memorable sentence: Why do you get up in the morning? Consider whatyou’re passionate about, how you enjoy using your talents, and what is trulyimportant to you.Find a partner.Find someone to whom you can communicate your life purpose, along with a planfor realizing it. It can be a friend, a family member, a spouse, a colleague—aslong as it’s someone who can help you honestly assess your plan and yoursuccesses.Learn something new.Take up a musical instrument or learn a new language. Both activities are amongthe most powerful things you can do to preserve your mental sharpness.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON SIX: DOWN SHIFTTake time to relieve stressSardinians pour into the streets at 5 p.m., while Nicoyans take a break everyafternoon to rest and socialize with friends. Remember Ushi and her moai? Theygather every evening before supper to socialize. People who’ve made it to 100seem to exude a sense of sublime serenity. Part of it is that their bodiesnaturally slow down as they have aged, but they’re also wise enough to know thatmany of life’s most precious moments pass us by if we’re lurching blindly towardsome goal. I remember watching Gozei Shinzato pause to watch a brilliantthunderstorm as she washed her breakfast dishes in Okinawa, and Sardinianshepherd Tonino Tola stop to take a long look over the emerald green plateausbelow. He’d seen that same sweeping view for almost 80 years, yet still tooktime every day to appreciate it.For Adventists, the Saturday Sabbath means many things. One is that the Sabbathcan be a powerful stress reliever. From sunset Friday to sunset Saturday,Adventists create a “sanctuary in time” during which they focus on God, theirfamilies, and nature. They don’t work. Kids don’t play organized sports or dohomework. Instead families do things together, such as hiking, that bring themtogether and make them feel closer to God. For the Adventists, it’s a time toput the rest of the week in perspective and to lessen the din and confusion ofeveryday life.The result seems to be a greater sense of well-being. But how does slowing downhelp you live longer? The answer may have something to do with chronicinflammation. Inflammation is the body’s reaction to stress. That stress cancome in the form of an injury, an infection, or anxiety. Small amounts of stresscan be good—for fighting off disease, helping us heal, or preparing us for atraumatic event. But when we chronically trigger inflammation, our bodies canturn on themselves. Italian endocrinologist Dr. Claudio Franceschi has developeda widely accepted theory on the relationship between chronic inflammation andaging. Over time, he believes, the negative effects of inflammation build up tocreate conditions in the body that may promote age-related diseases such asAlzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.Slowing life’s pace may help keep the chronic inflammation in check, andtheoretically, the related disease at bay.Apart from such health benefits, this Blue Zone lesson does much to add richnessto life. Slowing down ties together so many of the other lessons—eating right,appreciating friends, finding time for spirituality, making family a priority,creating things that bring purpose. I remember sitting one cloudy afternoon withRaffaella Monne in the Sardinian village of Arzana. Outliving most of herchildren, this woman had enjoyed a full life; at age 107, she stayed in her homefor much of the day, venturing out to a nearby plaza some afternoons. Though shecould only muster a whisper, her loving, serene demeanor attracted people.Children would make a point of visiting her on their way home from school.The day we met, Raffaella sat peeling an apple as I peppered her with dozens ofquestions about her diet, level of physical exercise, the relationship to herfamily, and so forth. Her answers were laconic and unrevealing. Finally,exasperated, I asked her if after 107 years she had any advice for youngerpeople. She looked up at me, eyes flashing. “Yes,” she shot back. “Life isshort. Don’t run so fast you miss it.”Once again, though, we’re confronted by an environmental catch-22. In theWestern world, accomplishment, status, and material wealth are highly reveredand require most of our time. Americans employed full time work on average 43hours a week and take the shortest paid vacations in the industrialized world.Then when they do take time off, according to one source, 20 percent of themstay in touch with the office. We generally hold working and being productive inhigh regard; being busy often wins us esteem. Few cultural institutions exist toencourage us to slow down, unwind, and de-stress.Finding time for our spiritual side can create a space to slow down, andpractices like yoga and meditation can also give the mind a respite. SteveHagen, who was ordained in the Soto Zen school of Buddhism and who wroteBuddhism, Plain and Simple, regards meditation as a cornerstone of slowing down.“Meditation provides us a mechanism to step out of the self-focus and find truefreedom.”Regular meditation can allow us to slow down our minds, ridding them of theincessant chatter in our heads. It focuses concentration and allows us to seethe world as it really is, instead of how we imagine it to be. It sets up ourday and helps us to realize that rushing, worrying, and the urgency we give toso many things in our lives really aren’t so important. With that realization,all other strategies for slowing down come much easier.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON SIX STRATEGIESUse these tips to find a quiet space to slow down in your Blue Zone.Reduce the noise.Minimizing time spent with television, radio, and the Internet can help reducethe amount of aural clutter in your life. Rid your home of as many TVs andradios as possible, or limit them to just one room. Most electronicentertainment just feeds mind chatter and works counter to the notion of slowingdown.Be early.Plan to arrive 15 minutes early to every appointment. This one practiceminimizes the stress that arises from traffic, getting lost, or underestimatingtravel time. It allows you to slow down and focus before a meeting or event.Meditate.Create a space in your home that is quiet, not too hot and not too cold, not toodark and not too light. Furnish the space with a meditation cushion or chair.Establish a regular meditation schedule, and try to meditate every day no matterwhat (but also not stressing out if you fail to do so). Start with 10 minutes aday, and try to work up to 30 minutes a day. Try to meditate with othersoccasionally.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON SEVEN: BELONGParticipate in a spiritual communityHealthy centenarians everywhere have faith. The Sardinians and Nicoyans aremostly Catholic. Okinawans have a blended religion that stresses ancestorworship. Loma Linda centenarians are Seventh-day Adventists. All belong tostrong religious communities. The simple act of worship is one of those subtlypowerful habits that seems to improve your chances of having more good years. Itdoesn’t matter if you are Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, or Hindu.Studies have shown that attending religious services—even as infrequently asonce a month—may make a difference in how long a person lives. A recent study inthe Journal of Heath and Social Behavior followed 3,617 people for seven andhalf years and found that those who attended religious services at least once amonth reduced their risk of death by about a third. As a group, the attendeeshad a longer life expectancy, with an impact about as great as that of moderatephysical activity.The NIH-funded Adventist Health Study had similar findings. It followed morethan 34,000 people over a period of 12 years, and found that those who went tochurch services frequently were 20 percent less likely to die at any age. Itappears that people who pay attention to their spiritual side have lower ratesof cardiovascular disease, depression, stress, and suicide, and their immunesystems seem to work better.Put generally, the faithful are healthier and happier. What’s the rationale? Inhis book Diet, Life Expectancy and Chronic Disease: Studies of Seventh-dayAdventists and Other Vegetarians, Dr. Gary Fraser cited several reasons tosupport this claim. People who attend church are less likely to engage inharmful behaviors and more likely to take on healthful behaviors. They werephysically more active, less likely to smoke, do drugs, or drink and drive.People who attend church have a forced schedule of self-reflection,decompression, and stress-relieving meditation, either through regular prayer orfrom sitting quietly during religious services.Belonging to a religious community can foster larger and denser social networks.People who attend services may have higher self-esteem and self worth becausereligion encourages positive expectations, which in turn can actually improvehealth. When individuals undertake and successfully act in ways prescribed bytheir roles, their self-concept and sense of well-being are reinforced. To acertain extent, adherence to a religion allows them to relinquish the stressesof everyday life to a higher power. A code of behavior is clearly laid outbefore them. If you follow it, you have the peace of mind that you’re engagingin “right living.” If today goes well, perhaps you deserve it. If today goespoorly, it’s out of your hands.image [Images/277.jpg]Seventh-day Adventists worship at the University Church in Loma Linda,California.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON SEVEN STRATEGIESTo strengthen the spiritual dimension of your Blue Zone, try these tactics.Be more involved.If you already belong to a religious community, take a more active role in theorganization. The longevity-enhancing effect may be a function of how you attendrather than the fact that you just attend. Getting involved in activities likesinging in the choir or volunteering might enhance well-being and possiblyreduce mortality.Explore a new tradition.If you don’t have a particular religious faith, commit to trying a new faithcommunity. If you don’t subscribe to any specific denomination, or if youhaven’t found a positive religious experience, you may want to explore a beliefthat is not based on strict dogma. Unitarian Universalism, for example, is opento anyone who believes in the inherent worth and dignity of every person and inthe acceptance and encouragement of each individual’s own spiritual journey.Buddhism is another tradition to consider if you are looking for a religiouscommunity. There is also the American Ethical Union, which describes itself as a“humanistic religious and educational movement.” The Union was inspired by theideal that the supreme aim in life is to create a more humane society. Membersjoin together in ethical societies to assist one another in developing moralideas.Just go.Schedule an hour a week for the next eight weeks to attend religious services.Don’t think about it. Just go, and do so with an open mind. Studies show thatpeople who get involved with the service (singing hymns, participating inprayers or liturgy, volunteering) may find their well-being enhanced.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON EIGHT: LOVED ONES FIRSTMake family a priorityThe most successful centenarians we met in the Blue Zones put their familiesfirst. They tended to marry, have children, and build their lives around thatcore. Their lives were imbued with familial duty, ritual, and a certain emphasison togetherness. This finding was especially true in Sardinia, where residentsstill possess a zeal for family. I asked the owner of one Sardinian vineyard whowas caring for his infirm mother if it wouldn’t be easier to put her in a home.He wagged his finger at me, “I wouldn’t even think of such a thing. It woulddishonor my family.”Tonino Tola, the Sardinian shepherd, had a great passion for work, but told us,“Everything I do is for my family.” In Nicoya, families tend to live inclusters. All 99 inhabitants of one village were descended from the same85-year-old man. They still meet for meals at a family-owned mountaintoprestaurant, and the patriarch’s grandchildren still visit him daily to help himtidy up or just to play a game of checkers.The Okinawan sense of family even transcends this life. Okinawans over 70 stillbegin the day by honoring their ancestors’ memories. Gravesites are oftenfurnished with picnic tables so that family members can celebrate Sunday mealswith deceased relatives.How does this contribute to longevity? By the time centenarians becomecentenarians, their lifelong devotion has produced returns: their childrenreciprocate their love and care. Their children check up on their parents, andin three of the four Blue Zones, the younger generation welcomes the oldergeneration into their homes. Studies have shown that elders who live with theirchildren are less susceptible to disease, eat healthier diets, have lower levelsof stress, and have a much lower incidence of serious accidents. The MacArthurStudy of Successful Aging, which followed 1,189 people between the ages of 70and 79 for more than 7 years, showed that elders who lived with their familieshad much sharper mental and social skills.“Families represent the highest degree of social network,” says Dr. Butler.“Parents that give you a sense of reality, of how to behave healthwise, offer asense of goals and purpose, and then if you become ill, or problems emerge, thatbasic support of family becomes incredibly important.” Much of life is makinginvestments, he says. You make investments when you go to school and you geteducated in a particular field. Investing in our children when they are younghelps assure they’ll invest in us when we’re old. The payoff? Seniors who livewith their families stay sharper longer than those who live alone or in anursing home.America is trending in the opposite direction. In many busy families withworking parents and active kids, family time can become rare as everyone’sschedules become more and more packed with things to do. Shared meals andactivities can drop off the daily routine, making time together difficult tocome by.How do you buck the trend? Gail Hartman, a licensed psychologist, believes thekey is for all generations of a family to make of point of spending timetogether. “Successful families make a point of eating at least one meal a daytogether, taking annual vacations, and spending family time. Everything does notneed to stop. Kids can be doing homework, and parents can be preparing dinner,but the point is that there is a ‘we-ness’ to the family.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON EIGHT STRATEGIESThese tips can help you create your family’s Blue Zone.Get closer.Consider living in a smaller house to create an environment of togetherness. Alarge, spread-out house makes it easier for family members to segment themselvesfrom the group. It’s easier for families to bond and spend time together in asmaller home. If you live in a large home, establish one room where familymembers gather daily.Establish rituals.Children thrive on rituals; they enjoy repetition. Make one family meal a daysacred. Establish a tradition for a family vacation. Have dinner with Grandmaevery Tuesday night. Make a point to purposefully celebrate holidays.Create a family shrine.In Okinawan homes, the ancestor shrine is always displayed in the best room inthe house. It showcases pictures of deceased loved ones and their importantpossessions. It serves as a constant reminder that we’re not islands in timesbut connected to something bigger. We can pick a wall to display pictures of ourparents and children, or take annual family pictures and display them inprogression.Put family first.Invest time and energy in your children, your spouse, and your parents. Playwith your children, nurture your marriage, and honor your parents.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON NINE: RIGHT TRIBEBe surrounded by those who share Blue Zone valuesThis is perhaps the most powerful thing you can do to change your lifestyle forthe better. For residents of the Blue Zones it comes naturally. Seventh-dayAdventists make a point of associating with one another (a practice reinforcedby their religious practices and observation of the Sabbath on Saturdays).Sardinians have been isolated geographically in the Nuoro highlands for 2,000years. As a result, members of these longevity cultures work and socialize withone another, and this reinforces the prescribed behaviors of their cultures.It’s much easier to adopt good habits when everyone around you is alreadypracticing them.Social connectedness is ingrained into the world’s Blue Zones. Okinawans havemoais, groups of people who stick together their whole lives. Originally createdout of financial necessity, moais have endured as mutual support networks.Similarly, Sardinians finish their day in the local bar where they meet withfriends. The annual grape harvest and village festivals require the wholecommunity to pitch in.Professor Lisa Berkman of Harvard University has investigated socialconnectedness and longevity. In one study, she looked at the impact of maritalstatus, ties with friends and relatives, club membership, and level ofvolunteerism on how well older people aged. Over a nine-year period, she foundthat those with the most social connectedness lived longer. Higher socialconnectedness led to greater longevity. Those with the least socialconnectedness were between two and three times more likely to die during thenine-year period of the study than those with the most social connectedness. Thetype of social connectedness was not important in relation to longevity—as longas there was connection. Even a lack of a spouse or significant other could becompensated for by other forms of connection.A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine showed just how powerfulan immediate social network can be. Looking at a community of 12,067 people overa period of 32 years, researchers found that subjects were more likely to becomeobese when their friends became obese. In the case of close mutual friends, ifone became obese, the odds of the other becoming obese nearly tripled. It seemedthe same effect occurred with weight loss.“I think a superior social support network is one of the reasons that women livelonger than men,” says Dr. Robert Butler. “They have better and stronger systemsof support than men, they’re much more engaged with and helpful to each other,more willing and able to express feelings, including grief and anger, and otheraspects of intimacy.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LESSON NINE STRATEGIESTry these tips to build up the inner circle of your Blue Zone.Identify your inner circle.Know the people who reinforce the right habits, people who understand or live byBlue Zone secrets. Go through your address book or your contact list of friends.Think about which ones support healthy habits and challenge you mentally, andwhich ones you can truly rely on in case of need. Put a big “BZ” by their names.Ideally, family members are the first names on that list.Be likable.Of the centenarians interviewed, there wasn’t a grump in the bunch. Dr.Nobuyoshi Hirose, one of Japan’s preeminent longevity experts, had a similarobservation. Some people are born popular, and people are naturally drawn tothem. Likable old people are more likely to have a social network, frequentvisitors, and de facto caregivers. They seem to experience less stress and livepurposeful lives.Create time together.Spend at least 30 minutes a day with members of your inner circle. Establish aregular time to meet or share a meal together. Take a daily walk. Building astrong friendship requires some effort, but it is an investment that can payback handsomely in added years.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [Images/284.jpg]Fumiyasu Yamakawa, 84, finds his ikigai, or purpose, in his daily exercises.THE CHOICE IS UP TO USI’d like to end this book with a tribute. The very first centenarian I met was a112-year-old Seventh-day Adventist named Lydia Newton. At the time, she was oneof the 35 oldest people on the planet. I traveled to the outskirts of Sedona,Arizona, to talk to her in the triple-wide mobile home that she shared with her91-year-old daughter, Margarite. When I walked into the living room, Lydia waswearing a dress with embroidered lilies that she had sewn herself 70 yearsearlier.“Now, what kind of dirt are they spreading about me?” she said by way ofgreeting and chuckled. I spent two days with her, asking her questions about herlifestyle (she started her day with buttermilk, oatmeal, and quiet prayer),listening to stories (she recounted a 107-year-old memory of a bull goring herfather, including a description of the “crimson” blood staining his cottonshirt), and watching her as she carried out her everyday life. She and Margaritewere best friends; they could sit and talk and find each other’s companycompletely entertaining.When I left, I asked if I could hug her. She said of course. As I bent down,nearing her face, I could see her veins through parchment-paper-thin skin. Iembraced her, feeling the birdlike bones of her back, and felt the universalwarmth of life within her embrace. It felt like hugging a delicate child.“The way you live,” I told her, “I’d be surprised if you don’t make the GuinnessWorld Records for the oldest person who ever lived.”“Oh, go on,” she said with a wave of supreme indifference.A few months into writing this book, I got a call from Margarite. Her mother haddied. Lydia had peacefully dozed off and never woke up. She was the first ofthree centenarian friends I met while writing this book who died before Ifinished it. None of them wanted to die, but they didn’t fear it either. They’dall mastered the art of life and accepted the inevitability of its end.To me, they offered a lesson about decline. I know that our bones will softenand our arteries will harden. Our hearing will dull and our vision will fade.We’ll slow down. And, finally, our bodies will fail altogether, and we’ll die.How this decline unfolds is up to us. The calculus of aging offers us twooptions: We can live a shorter life with more years of disability, or we canlive the longest possible life with the fewest bad years.As my centenarian friends showed me, the choice is largely up to us."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYBOOKSCorder, Roger.
