This included all of the herbal formulas I tried. I was constantly amazed at the weakness of these so- called intense herbal formulas that were supposed to change my life. They didn't. I would take them diligently and nothing would happen. Out of frustration, and my own illness, I remember taking 20 to 100 times the dosages, the whole bottle, and still little or no effect. In order to get myself well from a terminal heart disease, I had to break all the rules and make it up as I went. Because I broke the rules, I got well. · I n the 1970's, I started helping others get well and opened up my clinic. From the early days of my clinical practice, I was especially interested in helping people with serious illness and degenerative diseases. Almost all other graduates from the various institutes I attended worked mainly on young, healthy people who wanted to be a bit healthier, but I was obsessed with emergency treatment and the sick and dying. The same useless herbal formulas that failed me years before were now failing to help any of my patients. They thought they were doing something wrong and this is why they were coming to see me. I was forced to improve upon the crude formulas I had developed to heal myself and also create new formulas that worked. Why were all the herbal formulas useless? Why didn't they work? As far as I could see, there were three main reasons for this. · · · Many of the herbal formulas available were designed in the middle-to-late 1800's, some even earlier. The 1800's were very different times. Today, we have junk food restaurants on every corner, get less exercise and have more stress than probably ever before in history. What it took to stimulate and cleanse Wyatt Earp and Buffalo Bill 150 years ago doesn't work today. Even some of the more modern herbal formula available were still designed in the 1940's or l950's. This is still over 40 years ago when herbs were looked at as a cute little hobby to alleviate headaches and tired feet, not cure life- threatening disease. Many other modern formulas are just remakes of these ancient formulas; the herbs are just shuffled and a so-called new formula is dealt. These formulas just don't work. · · M ost modern American natural healers and herbalists have been educated and grew up in a hostile legal and political environment. Recent history"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"reveals that the AMA and other organizations have been on a witch-hunt for practicing herbalists and have jailed many. Out of fear, most herbalists and manufacturers want to make sure that no one ever gets a strong action or has any reactions with their products, even a cleansing reaction . They feel it's far safer to make products that have little or no effect. Like medical doctors today, treatment and therapy parameters are designed by the hospital legal departments to minimize financial repercussions and malpractice law-suits, not always what is best for the patient. · O ne way these herbal manufacturers assure their safety, not your health , is to design formula with very small amounts of the potent herbs, or none at all. Then, to be really safe, they suggest a dosage that is so low it's useless. They don't want to take any risks. To further weaken any potency, many manufacturers have abandoned the tried-and-true methods of old herbalists for quick extraction processes, high tech (high heat) machinery, freeze-dried herbs, ignoring the moons and seasons, mostly to make a quick buck. The result, most herbal products I see today are worthless junk. Many manufacturers are more concerned that their product tastes good or has a great-looking label than with whether you will get well using it. I also see labels loaded with sophisticated laboratory-testing results for potency, trying to convince you that the colorless, tasteless and odorless water inside will actually benefit you. How stupid do they think we are? · O ne of the worst aspects of many herbal formulas today is the poor quality of herbs used. The vast majority of herbal products are made from herbs grown outside the US. There is only one reason for this: they are cheap. Herbs brought in from India, China, Egypt, Mexico or Eastern Europe cost literally pennies a pound. I never used these poor quality herbs in my clinic. I always used American organically grown herbs that can cost over 20 times as much. I have visited these countries and found filthy, disgusting growing conditions, toxic pollution and out-of-control use of pesticides and insecticides. When we travel to these countries, we don't drink the water, don't even eat the food. Then why would we want to use herbs grown there? · I n the last two years, there have been numerous people getting sick after using famous herbal formulas because the herbs were contaminated with human fecal waste. If this isn't bad enough, most of these contaminated herbs, when brought into the United States, are gassed with Ethylene Oxide, an antibacterial gas that is known to cause cancer and also cause mutations in unborn children. In fact, the vast majority of organic herbs are even sterilized with this gas because the manufacturers are scared to use unsterilized herbs. In the last two years, I have done much to expose this corruption and I have been attacked by almost everyone in the herb industry, even my so-called friends. Even though they are well-aware of the problems, I have affected their income and they are plenty mad. Even the ones who haven't attacked me wont go on record to expose the industry or speak the truth. Most of my colleagues, out of fear of prosecution, write books and magazine articles, gather at meetings of their guilds, run schools and teach, but rarely have ever worked with a patient. It is illegal for an American herbalist to run a clinic and cure patients from illness and disease using American Herbs. This leads to the 3 rd reason why most herbal formulas don't work."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"· · W hy is it that most modern herbal formulas, designed by many of my colleagues, don't work? As I walk down the isles of modern day health food stores, I see hundreds of herbal products and recognize many of the names on the bottles. Many are my students and many are friends, but few of these armchair herbalists ever ran a clinic and would know the difference between a heart attack and indigestion. What they don't tell you on the bottle is that they developed these formulas after countless hours of research reading books and searching computer data bases, but they have had no clinical results or cures. You may be the first human to ever put these formulas in your mouth. A few of their herbal hypothesis are good, and in years, probably decades, some might prove to be important discoveries. I also know most of these formula will be tossed in the garbage where they belong. · Running my clinic, I learned very quickly what it takes to get people well. Theories don't, hypothesis don't, but quality herbs, potent formulas and large dosages do. The formulas, dosages and programs on the following pages are the result of 10 years of healing myself and an additional 18 years of clinical experience. They work!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MOVING TOWARD PERFECT HEALTH Your First Three Months as My Patient I. RESPONSIBILITY The First Step in Natural Healing In my many years of practice I have seen tens of thousands of patients recover from any and all disease using Natural Healing. Some from just minor irritations, some from killer diseases. Many people think that their particular disease or illness is unique, the exception to the rule I assure you I have treated people just like you with your same disease. I have treated people with every illness known, and some unknown ones, and everyone got well if they did the work. If you are seriously ill you may think that you are an exception, because of your serious condit ion. You are NOT. You are no exception, your disease or illness is no exception, the severity of your disease is no exception. I have seen people sicker than you, people at deaths door, people who all the doctors said would be dead a year before I ever met them. And I have seen these walking dead, recover, and outlive their doctors, but I never healed any of them, they ALL healed themselves. I cannot get anyone well. I am a teacher. I can show you the path to great health, energy and vitality. I can take you on an adventure to a new life free of illness and pain. I can show you how to live longer and enjoy health beyond your wildest imagination but you have to the work. I can teach you the lessons and show you the tools you need. But you are the one in control of your future health, not me. II. BUILDING LASTING HEALTH TAKES TIME Many people that walk into my clinic must think I am a priest, they want to confess their sins, and have me tell them to say few Hail Mary's, and then all is forgiven. After years of too much of the good life, or too much unconscious living, they want to make it all better, fix all the damage, by doing some intensive 24 hour detoxification program, and then get back to living their degenerating lives. I have never seen quick fixes work or help anyone get well. You may get a temporary boost for a few days but there will be no real or long lasting health benefits. I am not interested in some quick fix, just to get you back in action again. If I see you doing this I will refer you to one of my many colleagues who will gladly take your money, lie to you, let you fiddle around for years, give you the illusion that you are making some progress and then drop you like a hot potato when you get a serious illness, or when your current illness really tries to kill you."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I am interested in showing you a new way to live, a new healthy lifestyle that will change your life. I am looking for patients that want to have a life transformation, who are ready to be reborn. III. Why You Must Get Perpared Many people ask, why can't I do a particular cleanse now, then I'll follow your basic program next month. This approach not only doesn't work, but it can make you very ill. One of the basic rules of Natural Healing, and I teach this all over the world, is you FIRST must open up, strengthen and tone the elimination organs, especially the bowel, liver and kidneys. Why! The whole purpose of doing any type of cleansing or detoxification program is to get the toxins out of your fat, muscle, and blood. The point is, how are all these poisons supposed to get out of your body! Evaporate? I don't think so. These toxins once dissolved must be eliminated by your bowel, liver, and kidneys, and if these organs are not ready to handle the load, you may wish you never thought of getting healthy. I have seen many patients who attempted to do deep cleansing programs before their bodies were able to eliminate waste and they didn't get well, in fact they got worse. What can happen is that all these toxins and poisons that you begin to dissolve and remove have no place to go, recalculate, reabsorb. I am sure you all know someone who started to do a deep cleanse and felt worse instead of better. This is why I always say you have to earn the right to do a thorough cleansing and detoxification program. To earn this right you have to spend two months doing my Foundational Programs. IV. Why the Foundational Health Programs? When I studied herbal and natural healing, like most students I was attracted to the complex herbal formulas and intricate natural healing routines to treat rare and bizarre diseases. I wanted to be a specialist. I couldn't wait to design very complicated treatments for my patients. But I also learned from my great teachers the importance of beginning EVERY patient, regardless of what was wrong with them, with the basics of good health. I learned the good common sense to know that ALL my patients had to start here first. SUPER NUTRITION CLEANSING AND DETOXIFICATION OF THE ELIMINATION ORGANS, IMMUNE BOOSTING, I knew I had to begin here before we could start any advanced routines. Then THE BIG SURPRISE HAPPENED. 95% OF MY PATIENTS, AFTER FINISHING THE BASICS, WERE WELL!"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"That's right, the vast majority of my patients, before I ever got to treat their specific problem, their problem WAS GONE. 80% OF MY PATIENTS WERE WELL JUST AFTER DOING MY THOROUGH BOWEL CLEANSING PROGRAM. The big surprise I got was that after my patients followed the basic for a few months, they had the nerve to get well. I wasn't ready for this to happen, but regardless, they were healed before I ever got a chance to do any advanced specialized treatment. For this reason I began to call these programs my Foundational Programs. The vast majority of my patients didn't need to go any further. Also, following the Foundational Programs makes my other entire herbal formula even more effective. For this sole reason, I cannot over-emphasize the importance for everyone to begin with the programs and formula on the next few pages called my Foundational Programs. If you do, you will probably forget what was wrong with you in the first place. I REPEAT ... Everyone, who came into my clinic, I MEAN EVERYONE, started with the same basic program for the first TWO MONTHS. I may have added some of the specific herbal Formulas; listed in this handbook, but nobody escapes doing ALL of the basics, The Foundational Programs. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS ON THE FOUNDATIONAL PROGRAMS MONTHS 1 AND 2 Dr. Schulze's SUPERFOOD This is the way to start your day, EVERYDAY. The adult dosage is 2 rounded to 4 rounded tablespoons per day. If you need extra nutrition, because of an illness, you can take an additional 2 tablespoons in a drink in the afternoon. In the morning, I suggest to take a blender, put in 8 ounces of fresh fruit juice, 8 ounces of purified or distilled water, ½ to 1 cup of fresh organic seasonal fruit and two rounded tablespoons SuperFood. I have started my day for the last 20 years with this morning drink. If you choose to have another dosage of SuperFood in the afternoon I suggest 8 ounces of carrot juice, 4 ounces of a vegetable combination (beets, greens, etc.) and 4 ounces of purified or distilled water. You can also do the same fruit drink as in the morning. SuperFood can be mixed with either fruit or vegetable juice. BOWEL CLEANSING & DETOXIFICATION PROGRAM INTESTINAL FORMULA #1:"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Patient Type #1: The sluggish bowel type . This formula is for 97 % of my patients. The ones who need a help getting their bowel working frequently enough. Follow the directions for Intestinal Corrective Formula #1 on page 15 of this handbook. Patient type #2: The irritated bowel type. This is only a small percentage of my patients. This is the exception to the rule, those with bowels that work too often, more than 3 bowel movements a day. This includes those that have colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, Chrones disease, etc. If your bowels are irritated, hot or are working too frequently, skip this formula and go to the Intestinal Corrective Formula #2. INTESTINAL FORMULA #2: Patient type #1: The sluggish bowel type. Continue to use Intestinal Corrective Formula #1 until your bowels are moving 2 to 3 times a day and the consistency is softer. Wait at least one week before adding the Intestinal Formula #2, but you can wait a month if necessary. Once you have achieved 2-3 bowel movements a day, begin the Intestinal Corrective Formula #2. You want to use up the entire 8 ounce jar within one week. That's about 1 heaping teaspoon 5 to 6 times a day. Follow the mixing directions on the can or the directions in the Intestinal Detoxification Program sheet. Repeat this the second month by consuming 1 more 8 ounce jar in a week. Patient type #2: The irritated bowel type. Since you will not be taking the Intestinal Corrective Formula #1 at any time during this program, unless you get constipated, you can use the Intestinal Corrective Formula #2 on a daily basis, to sooth your bowel and solidify your bowel movements. You can use this formula continuously during the first two months of this program, you can use this formula forever if you wish. You may find that 1 teaspoon a day does the job, you may need three. Experiment to see what dosage is best for you. IMMUNE SYSTEM STIMULATING ECHINACEA PLUS Use at least 1 bottle of Echinacea Plus each month for the first two months. Follow the dosages later in this handbook. The Third Month Once you have succeeded making these lifestyle changes, stopped the old bad habits, added the new healthy ones and conscientiously taken the herbal formulae for two months, are have done the preparatory work necessary to get the most out of your detoxification program and have had a safe thorough cleansing.

Synthetic vitamin and Mineral supplements never helped any of my patients get well, but the juicer did.

It should be the foundation of any health program because it is nutrients that build your body and your health. Spirulina Blue-Green Algae S pirulina is one of the most concentrated, nutritious foods on this planet. It is the highest natural source of complete protein (75%). We use the only organically grown spirulina in the world, from Hawaii. The high amount of sunshine there makes this spirulina higher in Beta Carotene than any other. It is also a rich source of B-Vitamins, especially B-12. Grown using water pumped from 2000 feet deep in the ocean, this spirulina is one of the richest sources of minerals, also. One of the oldest types of algae, it has a soft cell wall for easy digestion and assimilation. Chlorella C hlorella is second only to Spirulina in nutritional content. Another of the algaes, it is an extremely concentrated source of nutrition and complements Spirulina well. The cell wall has been cracked to make the nutrients more available and increase its digestibility. Chlorella cell (600 X Magnification) Alfalfa, Barley and Wheat Grasses T hese are the Vitamin/Mineral herbs. They are mildly cleansing and the greatest sources of nutrition of any grasses. Grain grasses are more potent than the grains themselves, offering us a rich array of vitamins, minerals and chlorophyll.

Many seaweeds taste fishy and are offensive to vegetarians. Beet Root and Spinach Leaf B eets and Spinach are some of the richest, most assimilable sources of organic iron.

Both of these plants are famous for their blood-building ability. Rose Hips. Orange and Lemon peels Revered as some of the best sources of vitamin C, these fruits are also a balanced Complex source. They contain bioflavonoids, rutin, hesperidin, calcium and all of the trace elements that are now known to be necessary to assimilate vitamin C. The citrus peels are also one of the highest sources of pectin which has been proven to remove heavy metals ( mercury, lead, etc. ) from the body, even remove radioactive contamination like strontium 90. NON-Active Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nutritional Yeast This yeast is grown on beets and pure molasses.

Therapeutic Action: This formula is a mild, great tasting liquid laxative for the whole family. I designed this formula primarily for children. Every year hundreds of patients bring their babies, toddlers and children into my clinic. Some are very constipated. This formula has never let them down. In the clinic this formula saved hundreds of children and teenagers from having torturous, disfiguring, life-ruining surgeries. Kids love the taste, a sweet fig-tangerine flavor. And they don't have to worry about swallowing a capsule. It's gentle, not gripping, and even powerful enough for many adults. This formula increases the normal muscular contractions of the gastro- intestinal tract, especially the colon. It promotes soft easy bowel movements. It will help strengthen the colon for better future elimination. It relieves gas, cramping, colic, indigestion, nausea and stomach aches. It promotes proper, normal functioning of the bowels and will expel parasites.

Therapeutic Action: Echinacea is one of the strongest immune simulators and enhancers known. It can double and triple the amount of T-cells and Macrophages in your bloodstream with in a few days. It can also increase the amount of Interferon, Interleukin, Immunogloblin and other important natural immune chemicals present in your blood. This is how Echinacea works, by boosting the number of immune cells and the amount of natural immune chemicals, then stimulating them into more activity. The benefit of immune stimulatation is a shorter duration of existing colds and flu and/or prevention of future infections. It also initiates and speeds up recovery from chronic and long-term immune-related depression illnesses, diseases and degeneration. Cayenne is the best herb to stimulate circulation and makes these already powerful immune herbs many times more effective. Garlic is the best, most effective broad spectrum antibiotic, anti-viral, anti-fungal herb known. Echinacea and Garlic are the Herbal Dynamic Duo. Dosage: General: For general protection and immune stimulation, especially when you are not ill. This could even be when you're feeling fine but many around you are ill. People asked me for years, how can you be around so many sick people all the time and stay healthy yourself? Well, I live a very healthy lifestyle and takes lots of Echinacea Plus.

It also may mean that your body is fighting something off but in either case it is a good time it give it some help. In this scenario I suggest taking two dropperfuls six times daily until you consume two fluid ounces. This will take approximately six days. I know I am sick. This is when you actually have some observable, clinical symptoms. Sore throat, fever, nasal or lung congestion, toxic bite or sting, wound or trauma. Anytime there is anything wrong with you, your immune system must go to work. In this case I suggest an initial blast of 1 dropperful every waking hour or about 16 dropperfuls in a day, until you consume a total of two fluid ounces. This will take approximately four days. I am REALLY sick: This is when you are suddenly sweating, have the chills, a cold, food poisoning, cancer, whatever, but you are really ill. There is not time to waste fooling around and immediate aggressive herbal treatment can save you days of agony. In this case I suggest drinking an entire fluid ounce of Echinacea tincture immediately. For those who might have a hard time doing this, it can be diluted in juice or drunk ½ an ounce one hour and the other ½ ounce the next. Remember that this is 1 ounce of alcohol so keep that in mind and don't drive. Than consume an additional two droppersfuls every waking hours until you finish two fluid ounces. I suggest to continue taking Echinacea tincture at this rate and consume an additional two fluid ounces totaling four fluid ounces. This will take two to four days. REMEMBER, all of the above suggested dosages can be doubled, meaning you can consume more than two fluid ounces.

And while you are doing your best to keep your child healthy and strong, other parents are unconsciously doing everything they can to destroy the health of their children, your child's playmates.

Therapeutic Action: The herbs in these formulae are famous for their abiltiy to stimulate, cleanse and protect the liver and gall bladder and rid the body of parasites. Milk Thistle has certain chemicals not only bind to and coat liver cells. These phytochemicals not only heal previous liver damage but also protect the liver from future damage. Oregon Grape rootbark, Gentian root, Wormwood leaves and Dandelion root are all classic bitter liver tonic herbs. These herbs not only stimulate digestion but also stimulate the liver to excrete more bile which in turn cleans both the liver and gall bladder. If you have been exposed to any toxic substances, had constipation, eaten large amounts of animal food or drunk alcohol or other harmful beverages this formula is for you. It is also beneficial if you have had high cholesterol, blood fats or any family history of liver or gall bladder problems. Many believe that anyone who has cancer or any immune dysfunction had a weak congested liver to begin with. Even if a person has had their gall bladder removed these herbs will still be effective to clean the liver and bile ducts. The Black Walnut hulls, Wormwood and Garlic are strong ANTI-PARASITICAL plants. Parasite infestation is a fact of life. One cubic inch of beef can have over 1,000 living parasites larvae waiting to hatch in your body. Over 65% of fresh fish tested has toxic levels of bacteria and parasites. Chicken is even worse. I've had hundreds of patients expel bowels full of intestinal parasites, tape worms over 30 FEET LONG and also kill cellular parasites with these formulae.

(See details later in this handbook...) Top Ten Herbs for Medical Emergencies Lecture by Dr. Richard Schulze. Published by: The University of Natural Healing, Inc. 355 West Rio Road, Suite 201, Charlottesville, Virginia 22902 (804) 973-0262 Liver and Gall Bladder Herbs: Milk Thistle and Barberry. Use seed of Milk Thistle and the bark of root or root for Barberry. Latin name and genus is Silybum marianum and Berberis vulgarus. Uses: Protects you from liver damage, hepatitis, liver inflammation, liver disease and liver degeneration. I have had patients that were scheduled for liver transplants and did not have them because of this great healing herb. The late Dr. John Christopher always said that whenever you have cancer anywhere in the body, you have a toxic liver that isn't doing its job. Bitter herbs stimulate the digestion, stimulate the liver, and promote the secretion of bile, thus flushing the gall bladder. Although I only mentioned barbarry, its next-of-kin, Oregon Grape root, can be used in place of it. Other favorites of mine are Chaparral, Wormwood leaf, Dandelion leaf and root, Artichoke leaf (not flower), Gentian root. Emergency liver formula: Mix 50% milk thistle, and 50% bitter Aloes. Make a tea with one tablespoon each herb per 16 ounces of water, and take 2 cups. Do a liver flush or add 2-3 cloves raw garlic if not immediately doing a liver flush. Otherwise, use milk thistle tea with garlic and the emergency herb bitter aloes as given above. Emergency liver problems are usually gall bladder attacks, colic, or cramping. For severe gallbladder attacks, do immediate liver/gallbladder flush as follows: 2-3 tablespoons olive oil blended with 2-3 cloves of garlic and a big chunk of ginger. Swallow. Fifteen minutes later, take 2 cups of DeTox Tea (formula to follow) or use grated ginger root tea or mint tea. If no results, repeat in an hour from first olive oil dose. You can repeat this every hour until the pain subsides. Dr. Schulze has never had a patient do this more than twice for total pain relief, even when patients were doubled over in tears. No patient ever needed emergency surgery after doing this. Right after flush, you can put an ice bag on the liver, just below right rib cage. Do this for ten minutes on, then hot water bottle for ten minutes, then do ice bag again. If person hasn't pooped recently, give an enema to relieve any pressure from the colon."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Repeat liver flush next morning. Then repeat every morning for a week to heal the liver. In a gall bladder attack, remember to work the bottom of the feet hard , for it will help spasms to let go. Dig in and search for painful points. Work the entire bottom of the foot, as much as the person can tolerate. Also, in a liver emergency, a person can always add a castor oil pack. Soak a piece of wool or cotton flannel in warm castor oil and place over the liver. Cover with plastic to keep in the castor oil, and place a heating pad over the castor oil to drive the castor oil into the body through the skin. The castor oil acts like a transdermal patch to purify the liver. Daily castor oil packs along with milk thistle tea (6 to 10 cups/day) can also help drive down dangerously-high cholesterol, since the liver is where cholesterol is processed.

Therapeutic Action This tea has numerous health benefits. First, it is based on an ancient East Indian digestive tea formula. Over the years in my clinic I have seen my patients eat almost anything and survive if they drank a cup of this tea before, during and after the meal. It is a stimulant to the entire digestive process, especially the stomach during the first stages of digestion. This tea also mildly cleanses the blood, skin, liver, and gall bladder and is the perfect tea to use after the liver flush. It flushes out the bile and fats that the liver flush purged from your liver and gall bladder. It is also a mild diuretic and disinfectant to the kidneys and bladder and will cause you to urinate a little more within an hour after ingestion. This tea is also an excellent coffee replacement. It is a hot beverage, dark in color and tastes good. It's even better when a little pure maple syrup is added to the final brew. It also increases your circulation but has no caffeine. I used it in my clinic successfully for years to help people get off the coffee habit. Dosage: 2 cups of the tea consumed 15 minutes after doing your Liver/Gall Bladder Flush. It can also be drunk at any other time during the day, as many cups as desired. Put 1 tablespoon (medium) or 2 tablespoons (strong) of this tea into 20 ounces of distilled water. Be sure to use only stainless steel or glass cookware. Let the tea sit in the water overnight. In the morning heat up to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer for 15 minutes. Strain the herbs, do not discard them, let cool a bit but use hot. Put the used herbs back into the pot, add 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs and 20 ounces of pure water. Let sit overnight and repeat whole process again. Keep adding new herbs to old ones for three days, then discard all herbs and start over."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Kidney & Bladder Formula Formulae: Uva Ursi leaves, Juniper berries, Corn silk, Horsetail herb, Pipsissewa leaf, Burdock root and seed and Goldenrod flower tops.

According to medical reports the herbs in this formula destroy the bacteria that cause kidney and bladder infections. More importantly, whenever I used this formulae in my clinic, it cured every patient with urinary tract infection, even after antibiotics had failed. It worked 100% of the time.

Every patient I treat and put on my 5 Day Cleanse consumes 1 bottle of this formula during the week of this program. This formula is based on the famous Hoxey Formula, Dr. Christopher's Red Clover Tonic formula and many similar formulae from around the world. These herbs are famous for scrubbing the accumulated toxins and poisons out of the body's blood, fat and cells. As mentioned, it works best if used along with my 5 Day Cleanse . When using this formula make sure to consume a gallon of water, juice and herbal tea each day. After one of the late Dr. Jon Christopher's arrests he was instructed to never use thie word cancer again. In a private conversation I had with him regarding Red Clover Blossoms he said \"I just can't help myself, Red Clover is the antidote for cancer.\" Chaparral is one of nature's most powerful anti-oxidants and has proven itself in the clinic to break-up, destroy and dissolve all types of tumors.

If needed you can increase to 6 dropperfuls daily, but spread them out. If your symptoms intensify during a particular time of the day or evening, use more of the tonic during that time. For example, for nighttime sweats, take 2 to 3 dropperfuls before bedtime to offset this situation. Dosage for PMS: For a regular 28 day cycle on the 18 th day after the start of your last period, take 1 dropperful (35 drops). On the 19 th day take 1 dropperful in the morning and 1 in the evening.

This is the only herb that Dr. Christopher devoted an entire chapter to in his herbal book. Although currently in America the F.D.A. has cautioned us on using this plant, in Europe it is an important over the counter drug sold in many modern drug stores. To begin with, alkaloids are one of the most powerful of all plant chemicals. Not all plants have them. Some have a few, but Lobelia ranks high, with 14 different alkaloids.

My experience, and that of my patients, is that you rub in the oil, and in a day or two your problem is gone. A very powerful oil. To intensify the treatment take a hot bath or shower before application and then rub in the oil for 15 minutes. Also don't forget your hot and cold hydrotherapy. Every day until you are well, alternate very hot water over the injury for 1 minute and then ice cold over the injury for 1 minute. Alternate this hot and cold 7 to 10 times. This alone will heal you, but with the Deep Tissue Oil you will have a miracle. Many patients call it, \"a miracle in a bottle.\" Dosage: Use 1 or more dropperfuls on the body and rub in well. Use with caution on sensitive areas of the body."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Anti-Infection Tincture Formulae: Fresh Garlic juice, Goldenseal root, Usea lichen, Myrrh gum, Pine resin, Echinacea root juice, Tea Tree oil, Kelp, Black Walnut inner hulls, Oak galls and Cayenne pepper in 80% grain alcohol. Therapeutic Action: In 20 years of use, I have never seen any infection occur when using this formula. It's excellent for treating any cut or wound and is antibacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal. The tree resins in the formula leave an invisable, protective, antibacterial coating over the wound. Last year in England I used this formula on a man who had the top of his knee torn off in an auto accident. In 24 hours it literally gued his knee back together. A nurse from Ireland on the scene said in all of her years in the hospital, she had never seen such a severe wound close right up and heal, and with no infection! Dosage: Generally for external use but can be used in the oral cavity. Soak a cotton swab in the tincture and scrub into the infected area, let air dry. It has a burning sensation.

It increases blood circulation to the eyes and will remove toxic waste in and around the eyes and reverse eye diseases and destroys bacterial infections. Dosage: Mix 5 to 10 drops of tincture into an eyecup and the fill up with room temperature distilled water. Hold the eyecup up to your eye and tip your head back. Open your eye under the solution.

Diseases of the digestive tract are on the rise. In 1994 the #1 Cancer among men and women was Colon Rectal. M odern lifestyle has taken its toll on our digestive/elimination organs. Refined, processed, low fiber foods, animal fats, a lack of exercise and an ever-increasing level of stress all contribute to our current gastrointestinal health crisis. T he frequency at which a normal, healthy person should move their bowels has been a great misconception among the public and most medical professionals. For years, doctors have thought that anywhere between 1 bowel movement a day and 1 a week was normal. In the examinat ion of more primit ive peoples, we find that their bowels mo ve much more frequently, 2 to 3 times daily on the average. This is due to the fact that these people eat better, get more exercise and have much less stress. What we have learned is that it is normal to have 1 bowel movement a day for each meal you eat, (if you eat 3 meals you should have 3 bowel movements). T he Merck Manual, the medical industry's standard text for the diagnosis and treatment of disease, tells us that colon degeneration is on the rise. The incidence of diverticulosis has increased dramatically over the last 40 years. It states, that in 1950, only 10% of adults over the age of 45 had this disease, in 1955 15%, in 1972 30% and in 1987 almost ?. The latest edition states that the incidence \"increases rapidly\" over age 40 and that \"every person will have many\" if they live long enough. Every American adult will have herniation of the large intestine. D iverticula are saccular herniations that protrude through the wall of the colon. These \"bowel pockets\" are almost always asymptomatic, (you can't feel them). They are caused by a sluggish constipated bowel. These pockets fill with old fecal material which can be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. This can infect the entire body causing all types of toxic reactions. A sluggish bowel can retain pounds of old, toxic and poisonous fecal matter. Many times the real cause behind sickness and disease is this retention and reabsorption of this toxic waste."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"T he first step in everyone's health program should be stimulating, cleaning and toning all the elimination organs, and the bowel is the best place to begin. Day #1: S tart with only one capsule of Intestinal Corrective Formula #1 during or just after dinner. This formula works best when mixed with food. Day #2: T his morning you should notice an increase in your bowel action and in the amount of fecal matter that you eliminate. The consistency should also be softer. If you do not notice any difference in your bowel behavior today or the difference wasn't dramatic, then tonight increase your dosage to two capsules. You can continue to increase your dosage every evening by one capsule until you notice a dramatic difference in the way your bowel works. It has taken most of us years to create a sluggish bowel so let's be patient for a few days and increase by one capsule each day only. B y the end of the first week you, should know what your dosage is. If not, then remain on this formula alone for an additional week to get regulated before you go on to the next step. Week #2: A t the beginning of week two is when we begin to start the Intestinal Corrective Formula #2 . We will take this formula 5 times each day beginning in the morning. One hour after your morning nutritional drink, mix 1 heaping teaspoon of Intestinal Corrective #2 powder with 8 ounces of diluted juice. It mixes best if you shake it in a small jar. Do the same ½ hour before lunch, between lunch and dinner, ½ hour before dinner and 1 hour before bed, so that you are consuming a total of 5 heaping teaspoons each day. D uring or after dinner, take your Intestinal Corrective Formula #1 as usual but increase the dosage you discovered the first week by 1 additional pill. If you feel a bit bound by the #2 formula, you can increase your dosage of the #1 formula even more. Helpful Hints: I t is helpful to drink additional liquid after each dose of Intestinal Corrective Formula #2, at least 8 more ounces. Drink plenty of pure water, herb teas and diluted fruit and vegetable juices during this two-week colon cleanse. A good amount is between 64 and 128 ounces of liquid each day.

INTESTINAL FORMULA #2: Patient type #1: The sluggish bowel type. Continue to use Intestinal Corrective Formula #1 until your bowels are moving 2 to 3 times a day and the consistency is softer. Wait at least one week before adding the Intestinal Formula #2, but you can wait a month if necessary. Once you have achieved 2-3 bowel movements a day, begin the Intestinal Corrective Formula #2.

Open Letter From Dr. Richard Schulze On Healing and Responsibility Naturopathic Doctor / Medical Herbalist D ear Interested Reader, T hank you for your letter. I wish I could answer your questions personally and directly but I am legally gagged. I will make the following suggestions: J ust follow the basic information in these courses; forget the specifics at first. It will make a dramatic change in your health, and will change your life. I developed and used these programs myself for my own dramatic personal healing. The same routines and formulae in my clinic healed tens of thousands worldwide. These programs work on everybody and for everything. The results you will get on these programs will be a perfect reflection of the amount of time, dedication and energy you put into doing the programs themselves. I know that we are all different, and our specific problems seem very unique, but I assure you they are not, and I have most likely seen hundreds of people with your same problems, in your same dilemma, in my clinic, and I have seen them all get well. I know that I can't offer you the same personal service, but I can offer it other ways such as the videos, audios and written material. E veryone wants the specifics, but the basics of getting and staying well are so powerful, that 98% of the time the specifics are not necessary. The specifics rarely work on their own anyway, or only give temporary results. Getting well is not as difficult as you may think; it is not complicated. It usually takes a lot more dedication, time and energy to make yourself sick. Follow the basic principals of Natural Healing, be patient, and you will get well."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"M aybe the doctors say you are dying, we are all dying and have been since the day we were born. I am not trying to stop death, I am talking about increasing the quantity and quality of life. If you are out of time and are at death's door, or even if you or your loved one still dies, these programs will make death more comfortable, peaceful and usually pain-free. Physical death, the eventual physical end for all of us, we will all experience it. I strongly feel that this is something that we should experience at home, with our loved ones, blessed out, happy, and reflecting on the wonder of life and giving thoughts to our loved ones. All of my patients who have had a loved one die at home, using natural healing, have had a blessed, beautiful experience, and without pain. Who wants to die in a hospital, with strangers, and tubes stuck everywhere and doped up with drugs, incoherent for this beautiful experience? P robably the only reason you are sick is because the life you led was not healthy enough for your particular constitution. I don't care what your relatives, neighbors or friends eat or do, they are not you, and some people have stronger constitutions and can get away with more than others. Who cares what George Burns does; his lifestyle would have killed me by 20. So, stop blaming yourself or others, get rid of your excuses, your why ME's and your cop- outs; they won't help you get well. I am not saying this is you, but most people who write, in fact most of the patients I saw for 20 years, and my students and even myself at times, want to work on the specific problems and skip some, or most, or all of the basics. This is what doctors do and why we are fed up with medicine. This is why most of us have the same problems coming back to haunt us, or worse ones. T he following is a review of the basics that most people skip. Natural Healing must be a broad spectrum program, a lifestyle, not just an herb for a disease. If my patients did not achieve the following basics within one month of their first visit, I would throw them out of my clinic. I am a hard ass, a butt kicker, because hard work, not sympathy, gets people well. I have tossed little old greyhaired ladies out the door, I have shoved others out in their wheelchairs and told them to enjoy their life as a cripple. Many people write me and say they wish they could only talk to me, or see me one time for a consultation. Some even weep and say if only I would have known of you when you were still in practice. I tell most of you that I would have thrown your butt out the door too. Don't think I'm a nice guy, I am a very tough Natural Healing Evangelist. Only 10% of my patients ever made it through the first month. Everyone said they were willing to do anything to get well, but when they found out what anything was, they wiped out. Ninety percent of the people who came to see me didn't have what it takes to get well using Natural Healing, and I sent them packing. Why do you think that medicine and pharmaceuticals are a trillion dollar industry? It's because people don't want to take responsibility for their own health or \"just say no to drugs.\" People want the temporary \"quick fix\" of medicine. For many, life isn't worth living if they have to give up too much of the \"good life\". Most people wouldn't make near the sacrifices I made to overcome my heart disease. B ut, that 10% who stayed, and did the work, well you have heard the miracle stories. Almost every one of them got a miracle healing. They came looking for a good doctor; I was looking for good patients!

I don't care how little of it you eat, or if you think that it is normal to eat a little, or what your parents did or your protein-need fantasy, or even if you eat animal food that is organic and the animal was allowed to pray before its head was cut off. Eating animals is wrong for health and environmental reasons, not to mention moral reasons; so stop it. Our ancestors ate this food to survive; it is not necessary anymore. This is 1995 not 1895, let's move on to a cleaner, more nutritious food program. I know it may be difficult for you but don't fool yourself for a minute, If you are eating anything that had a face or came from anything with a face, I would throw you out of my office, get it? Believe me, I know what I am asking. It is un-American, and may be difficult for you to achieve after a life of eating blood, but I also know it will give you the results you want. Also, get a juicer and use it; it can save your life - and use SuperFoods every day. CLEANSING : Clean the bowel, clean the liver and clean the blood. EXERCISE : Move every day, sweat and move more! Do your hot and cold showers! EMOTIONAL: Quit blaming the program, the herbs, the routines, the doctors and me. Take a good look into the mirror. There is the person who is responsible for your current health. I know you may hate the doctors and blame them, but you walked into their office in the first place. You are the only person who can help you, so get a grip, stop feeling sorry for yourself and get to work. HOW MUCH CAN YOU TAKE? Many people spend 30 or 4O years killing themselves with cigarettes, beer, wine or whiskey, coffee, black tea or soft drinks, high fat, sugar and low-fiber diets, junk food, no exercise,negative television and a bad attitude. These same people then worry if a herb may hurt them, if they are getting enough protein on a vegetarian diet or if they can physically take a health routine. Get real! You're lucky to be alive after what you have done. I have always found that a person's breaking point is about a million times past where they think it is. Most people who are taken hostage, starved and given forced labor end up healthier. Maybe you should consider getting kidnapped by a hostile government. I know I have been tough, but that is the only way I have seen miracles happen, and I want more than anything for you to have one. Good Luck and God Bless You, Dr. Richard Schulze"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Why You Must Get Prepared - Dr. Schulze. M any people ask, why can't I do a particular cleanse now, then I'll follow your basic program next month. This approach not only doesn't work, but it can make you very ill. O ne of the basic rules of Natural Healing, and I teach this all over the world, is you FIRST must open up, strengthen and tone the elimination organs, especially the bowel, liver and kidneys. Why! The whole purpose of doing any type of cleansing or detoxification program is to get the toxins out of your fat, muscle, and blood. T o clean out your body of accumulated poisons and waste. The point is, how are all these poisons supposed to get out of your body! Evaporate? I don't think so. These toxins once dissolved must be eliminated by your bowel, liver, and kidneys, and if these organs are not ready to handle the load, you may wish you never thought of getting healthy. I have seen many patients who attempted to do deep cleansing programs before their bodies were able to eliminate waste and they didn't get well, in fact they got worse. W hat can happen is that all these toxins and poisons that you begin to dissolve and remove have no place to go, recalculate, reabsorb. I am sure you all know someone who started to do a deep cleanse and felt worse instead of better. T his is why I always say you have to earn the right to do a thorough cleansing and detoxification program. To earn this right you have to spend two months doing my Foundational Programs."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Introduction: Curing Oneself of an \"Incurable\" Illness THE NEW INCURABLES PROGRAM (THE FIRST 30 DAYS) I highly suggest for anyone who has been diagnosed as incurable or hopeless to throw out the diagnosis.

Consume at least 3 cloves of FRESH RAW Garlic every day. I f you do only one program or use only one herb, it should be Garlic. In the many years at the clinic, I have seen it heal many, hurt no one, and create miracles. G arlic is one of the most potent and reliable herbal healers known. It is a powerful broad spectrum antibiotic. It is also anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-parasitical and has proven itself to rid the body internally and externally of any antigen or pathogen. G arlic has been proven in hospitals and laboratories worldwide to destroy cancer and break up tumors, thin the blood and normalize blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Hundreds of my female patients used vaginal garlic implants to do everything from heal infections to eliminate cancer. G arlic externally is an herbal surgeon. Its 75 various sulfur compounds will destroy infection and, if used full strength, will burn off anything in its way. Garlic nutritionally is a great strength-builder and has been revered throughout history in numerous cultures as a food to increase health and energy. I t can be eaten raw, swallowed whole, chopped up and mixed with food and put through your juicer. Just get it in. T he best Garlic is the hottest, and, of course, Organic. If none is available, which is rare, use your hottest onions, which is Garlic's next of kin. Hydrotherapy Program: High Enemas : You must use a high enema 2 times a week with an implant afterwards. Use only distilled water for the high enema The implant can be: 8 ounces of Aloe Vera gel and 8 ounces of distilled water (soothing) or 2 ounces wheatgrass juice with 16 ounces of water (Detoxifying ) or 1 - 2 cloves of garlic blended into 8 ounces of raw apple cider vinegar and 8 ounces of distilled water (Antibacterial, Antiviral and Antifungal). Hot and Cold Showers: (the most effective way to move the blood and create circulation ) Once daily, you must do a complete hot and cold shower. You will start with hot water for 1 minute, then cold for 1 minute. Re-peat this 7 times so the shower should last about 15 minutes. Another time, daily, you can do a complete hot and cold shower routine again or a partial one just applying the water directly to the affected area. Make sure while you are doing both hot and cold showers that you pay special attention to the affected area and massage it vigorously. If the shower is impossible then use Hot packs and Ice packs. Hot Castor Oil Packs : (breaks up congestion ) U se hot Castor Oil packs in the evening over the affected area and leave on all night long. They can be kept warm with a hot water bottle."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Cold Sheet Treatment : D o the new Cold Sheet treatment once weekly. Massage/Bodywork: M assage the entire body every day with special emphasis on deep foot reflexology and all around the problem areas. Don't be afraid to touch your sore or sick parts. Put some life back there. Alternate castor bean oil and olive oil for your massage oils. SKIN BRUSH with a natural bristle skin brush and SCRUB yourself thoroughly every day. Exercise: Y ou must exercise everyday. Do whatever you can but push yourself. Increase the amount everyday. You should breathe hard and work up a sweat. 1 hour each day is to be your eventual goal. If you rest, YOU RUST! Attitude: I highly suggest for anyone who has been diagnosed as incurable or hopeless to throw out that diagnosis and start on a healing program IMMEDIATELY. The incurables program has no power unless you put all the time and energy you have into it. You must give l00%. L ove, giving it and receiving it, is the most powerful cleansing and healing tool. Be responsible for yourself. You created this problem and you can get rid of it. No one ever got better by feeling sorry for themselves. The doctors were wrong; you can get well. Forgive everyone in your past, including all the doctors. The main function of your body is to repair and heal, so let's get started. There are NO incurable diseases . Get positive, right now, Believe, START NOW! Additional Routines E very day strip naked and take a sun and air bath for 10 to 15 minutes. Every day take a walk outside in your bare feet and shuffle them in the grass or dirt, even lie down on the earth. Do deep breathing while you are outside; fresh air will help you heal faster. Use only natural soaps, shampoos and toothpastes. Never use any deodorants, perfumes, colognes, etc. You may use pure herbal essential oils if you smell. Wear only natural fiber clothing, cotton, wool and silk. No polyester, nylon or even blends. Drink as much of the Potassium Broth as you can stand, the recipe is in the 5-day cleanse and detox program. This is a great tasting addition to your cleansing program. It will flush your system of unwanted salts and acids while giving you a concentrated amount of vitamins and minerals. Final Thoughts, a Natural Death W e all eventually experience a physical death. For all of us, this beautiful time will come. By using Natural Healing, Herbs and my programs we are not trying to cheat death; we are increasing the quality and prolonging a quantity of life. M edical Universities tell us the human body should last 125 years. We are lucky today if we make it to half that. There have been many people who have lived to 150 and even a few over 200. Looking at this miraculous being that we have been blessed with, I know that the ages in the Old Testament of the Bible are correct. I know that we should live 300, 400, 500 years, maybe more. I don't think that you or I will achieve this in our lifetime but what about in 20 or 30 generations of better living? When we finally die after living a healthy natural lifestyle, what I have seen is we go with no pain, a big smile on our face and in a room with our loved"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ones. Considering the screaming hospital death drama, my patients preferred the natural death."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Letter to a Friend Natural Healing and Power of Choice D ear F riend, W e received your letter regarding your concern for your very sick or dying friend/relative. I would like to share with you the following thoughts. Please keep in mind that what I am about to tell you I learned from many years in the clinic, the school of hard knocks. At first, it may sound a bit cold or cruel. I assure you it is not and I send this message with love. In fact, what you may be about to do could be cruel. F irst of all, I know you are excited about the possibility of your friend or loved one being healed. So am I, and you are probably a great believer in the healing power of herbs and natural healing. So am I, and I am sure your friend or loved one doesn't want to die, but trying to save someone's life is usually the same as trying to force an alcoholic to stop drinking. It rarely works. T he first thought that enters my mind is why didn't your friend or relative contact me personally, instead of you? And why are you the one who bought the Save Your Life Collection, or the herbal products, and not they. Now you probably have a few excuses for them but I have heard them all. I actually know why they didn't contact me barring that they can't speak or write. The reason you are contacting me is because you are much more of a believer in me, herbs and natural healing than they are. If fact, most of the suffering they are currently experiencing is due to the countless drugs and medical procedures they have volunteered for and are probably only interested in what you have to say as a last ditch effort. I know you are probably willing to do anything to be well, but are they? The fact is, they didn't even attempt to contact me themselves, which in my experience shows they will probably never complete the programs. I suggest to back off; give them a few telephone numbers, some of my literature, one of my video tapes or the catalog from the American Botanical Pharmacy. Then just sit back, bite your tongue and see what they do with this information. Chances are probably little or nothing. If there is any chance for their success on the programs, they must make all of the first steps. The majority of the time you will hear plenty of excuses, and they will decide to go with what their medical doctor says. I have had many students who have regretted that the last days they spent with mom, dad or uncle Harry was forcing them to undergo some natural therapy, swallow some bad tasting herbs, and listening to them complain as they dragged and tortured them through the programs. Dr. Christopher used to warn, never work on your relatives or friends, and this is why. Hopefully, this information will save you from a bad experience and a life of bad memories."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"R emember, there are many paths to follow, and natural healing isn't for everybody. Give your friend/relative the right to drown themselves in chemical poisons and cut and burn their diseases away until they look like Frankenstein, if this is their choice. It is always O.K. to point out alternatives, but a good friend supports you in your decisions, and holds your hand while you are making them. My own brother usually chooses medical torture over my guidance, and I support him 100% and give him my love. It took me a few years to learn how to do this and now we really love each other and have a better relationship than ever. F orcing someone to submit to natural healing is no different than someone forcing you to take drugs and have surgery. I f you still feel I am wrong, sleep on it a few days. If the person, doesn't have a few days, well, it is probably too late anyway. If, in a few days, you still want to go ahead with this, then this is the first step. I do believe that everyone can be healed of ANY disease. Is it too late? Who knows? Make sure and watch the last 2 videos in the Save Your Life Collection that deal with the mistakes people make on the incurables program and the positive things I say about natural death. A s I said before, just give them a little information and see if they act on it themselves. In order for natural healing to be effective, the patient must totally believe in what they are doing and be 100% committed and self-involved. I t is very important that you constantly monitor how much time and energy you are putting into helping them and to always make sure they are at least matching your time and energy; preferably, they are doing more than you and are more excited than you. If they are not, BACK OFF. I f it is still a \"go\", then get out the Save Your Life Collection and watch the video tapes with your friend/relative day and night. If you don't have this collection, order one from us immediately. PLEASE remember, I cannot offer you any specific health advice. I can only suggest what material we have for educational purposes only. Good Luck and God Bless You, Dr. Richard Schulze"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" Children vary dramatically in size and shape. One 5 year old can be very different from another. In my clinic, I found the most effective and safest way to dose children was by weight. After all we want to adjust their dosages by how much their metabolism can handle. The surest way to do so is by weight. Simply make a fraction and put the child's weight over 150 pounds. Look at the following examples and I am sure they will clarify what I am saying. If a child's weight was 50 pounds they would take 1/3 of the adult dosage. You can use this same formula to dose animals. A small dog or cat of 10 pounds would be 1/15 the adult dose and a horse of 1500 pounds would be 10 times the adult dose. Additional notes for Children I have seen thousands of kids over the years in my clinic. I have bruises on my shins from being kicked by some of the more stubborn ones. I am also a dad myself. I have found that by mixing most herbal tonics 1/2 and 1/2 with pure maple syrup, you can get it down any kid. Call it candy if you need too. By diluting it 50% just take this into consideration and give the child twice as much as the children's dosage you already figured out. I have also noticed how smart children are. You must convince the child that the herbal tonic taste good and if you have a scary look on your face they will know your are lying. Making herbal popsicles or having a tea party is far better than strapping them down with a funnel. Love, hugs and kisses can go a long way too."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Index of Ailments and Herbal Remedies After each ailment listed in this section is the formula abbreviation on the following page. Some pages have two or more formula listed. All remedies are listed in order of priority so start with the first formula listed. You may use all of the formula listed at once also. If you start with just one and after a reasonable period of time you do not get the desired results, try the second and third formula recommendations. Continue to use the first formula when adding the second and third formula suggestions. P lease note: I have much hesitation and resistance to writing an index of this type. My fear is that you will take it out of context and try to cure diseases with herbal remedies. Herbal Doctoring rarely works, and even when it does it is only a temporary fix. True healing comes from creating a lifestyle that is healthy. Stopping the things you did that made you sick and beginning new programs of health and wellness. My 5 Day Cleansing and Detoxification Program should be done as a foundation to almost every formula, and then repeated every three months for prevention purposes.

He operated natural cure clinics in New York, Southern California and Europe for almost 20 years up until 1994. He still teaches throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia and has for the past 17 years. He has designed natural therapy programs, which have assisted tens of thousands of people worldwide to create miracles and regain their health. When he was 11, his father died in his arms of a massive heart attack. At 14, his mother died of a heart attack. They were both only 55 years old. At 16 years of age, he was diagnosed with a genetic incurable heart deformity. After curing himself of this so-called incurable disease through changes in his life-style, and NO surgery, he set out on a mission to help others. He continues this healing crusade today through his daily work to expose the truth, to reveal the unlimited healing power of our being, to educate on the use of herbs and the fundamentals of natural healing, to help people to help themselves and to expose the medical, pharmaceutical and even herbal industries. He is considered an innovator, a purist, and even an extremist by many of his colleagues, but to his patients he is considered \" The man who has the guts to say and do what the others were afraid to\". In the field of natural healing, he dared to pioneer new techniques and therapies which went far beyond what most people thought possible with Alternative Medicine. The outcome of his work has been the achievement of miraculous and unprecedented results. His formulae and incurables program are used at clinics worldwide to help people heal themselves from degenerative diseases such as Heart Disease, Cancer, Arthritis, Neuromuscular disease and even A.I.D.S. These results have caused reverberations in both the Natural and Medical communities. Dr Schulze apprenticed with the late Dr. John Christopher and taught with him at his prestigious School of Natural Healing in Springville, Utah. He continued to teach at the school after Dr. Christopher's death for another 12 years. He has been the Director of the College of Herbology and Natural Healing in the United Kingdom for 12 years and is also Co-Director of the Osho School for Herbalists and Natural Healers in France and founder of his own School of Natural Healing in Southern California. He has taught and lectured at numerous universities including Cambridge and Oxford Universities in England, Trinity Medical College in Ireland, Omega Institute in New York, Cortijo Romero in Spain and other natural therapy and herbal institutes worldwide. He has been the guest speaker on numerous radio and television shows in the United States and Europe. As a teacher, he is loved for his intensity, passion, and dedication to students, sense of humor,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"creativity, and his exciting, enthusiastic and evangelistic teaching style. He is most recognized for his unequaled understanding of Natural Healing. In the 1970's, he was the creator of Professor Cayenne's Herbal Products and, today, the American Botanical Pharmacies line of industrial strength pharmaceutical botanical extracts. He has manufactured these herbal products in the United States and Europe for over 17 years and also designs herbal formulae for natural clinics and natural product companies worldwide. His herbal formulas are famous for their strength and efficacy. He served an internship with the famous natural healer Dr. Bernard Jensen. Besides having a Doctorate in Herbology and a Doctorate in Natural Medicine, he also holds a degree in Herbal Pharmacy and three degrees in Iridology. He is certified in eight different styles of Body Therapy and holds three Black Belts in the Martial Arts. He has written many clinical research papers on the topics of Botanical Pharmacognosy, Pharmacology and the making of Herbal Preparations. He has written for Sam Biser's famous newsletter, has done many video and audio tapes and has co-authored books in Europe."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"HYPERTHERMIA How I do The \"COLD SHEET\" Treatment, explained by Espen The \"COLD SHEET\" Treatment is several hundreds of years OLD, NATURAL and POWERFUL Healing Method By inducing an Artificial Fever known as HYPERTHERMIA, you can cure many diseases! It is one of the most powerful of all cancer treatments! HYPERTHERMIA can be used with Common Health Problems, such as Flus and Colds, and DEFINITELY should be used with MORE SERIOUS Pathogenic Disease Processes, such as Pneumonia, Cancer, and AIDS!! It is important to do all 8 steps! Espen: Here is exactly what I do, when doing \"COLD SHEET\" Treatment. My wife is helping me. You will have to have someone to help you, it is too complicated to do it alone! It shuld be done inside house, and you definitively need a bath. STEP 1 : COLD Enema to clear LOOSE Fecal Matter out of my Colon, before I begin \"COLD SHEET\" I add Herbs to the Water, such as Catnip or Red Raspberry. A COLD Enema causes the Rectal Area to contract, which HELPS to RETAIN the Fluid LONGER, before I EXPEL the Herbal Tea and the LOOSE Fecal Matter. STEP 2:"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"After expelling the Herbal Tea, the next Step of the \"COLD SHEET\" Treatment is the \"GARLIC INJECTION\"! I take Rectal Syringe from the Drug Store (a wider tube), that allows not only water, but also small particles of garlic to enter colon. I take 8-10 LARGE Organic Garlic Cloves in a Blender with 50% Apple Cider Vinegar and 50% clean Water. Dr. Richard Schulze says it's like NAPALM in your Rectum! I put this Solution in with the Rectal Syringe, but I get it in QUICKLY ALL at once, because once it is inside, I don't feel like keeping it there ... I want it out ! \"It's POWERFUL and it BURNS! I RUN to the Toilet, but it doesn't ALL come out. In about 2 minutes, the Burning and the Cramping go away. STEP 3: I take a HOT Bath, which is as HOT as I can support, without burning my skin! Before I enter the Tub, my wife place the following Herbs in the HOT Water: 1 oz. or more of Cayenne Pepper 1 oz. or more of Ginger, and 1 oz. or more of dry Mustard. Get GOOD HIGH-POTENCY Mustard, since MOST of the American Mustard is quite WEAK! I coat my Genitals with PLENTY of Vaseline for Protection, because Olive Oil ALONE can't do the Job! The Cayenne, Ginger, and Mustard, that I use in the \"COLD SHEET\" Treatment are NOT LOOSE in the Water, but are put in a VERY LARGE (made-up) Tea Bag. If you put them in LOOSE, you'll plug up the Drain and create a REAL MESS! I use a small cotton pillow case, and I put all herbs inside, and inside hot bath water. Squeezing it several times for as long as 10 minutes will make more of it get into the water. The Water turns a Yellowy Orange, and the scent is very strong! These HOT Herbs HELP to induce HYPERTHERMIA."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"To further ACCELERATE HYPERTHERMIA, I drink HOT Herbal Tea, while I am inside, in the Bath. According to Dr. Schulze, \"For adults, the BEST bitter Diaphoretic (fever-inducing) Tea is Yarrow, which was what Dr. Christopher suggested.\" I prefer Ginger instead, since it is a taste, that I and most People KNOW and LIKE! Ginger really ACTIVATES the Digestive System, makes you SWEAT, and it's also readily AVAILABLE! I'm always looking for the Herbs, that really WORK and are EASY-to-get at your local Health Food Store. You can even get minced, dehydrated Garlic Cloves, if you have NO other choice. Now you've got the Garlic for the Rectal Injection, and everything that you will need for the \"COLD SHEET\" Treatment, from the Grocery Store. Drink as many Cups of the Herbal Tea as you can get down, but the MINIMUM is 6! If you get LIGHT-HEADED and you feel like FAINTING, have your Helper place a COLD Towel or Washcloth on your Forehead. Also, there are 2 Herbal Tinctures (Home-Made), that you should ALWAYS have on hand: CAYENNE and LOBELIA! CAYENNE PREVENTS People from fainting and LOBELIA STOPS FULL Body Spasms, that can occur SOMETIMES! When I get to the Point, where I know that I can't stand it 1 Minute MORE, my wife makes sure I stay for about 5 MORE minutes! STEP 4: Now, My wife helps me out of the Tub, and then wrap me in the \"COLD SHEET\"!. This is a Double bed-size, clean, White Cotton Sheet (NOT Synthetic Fabric), that has been soaking in a Bucket of 20 Pounds of ICE, so that this \"COLD SHEET\" is definitely ICE- COLD! I don't even NOTICE it though, because I am in ANOTHER World! \"COLD SHEET\" signals the Body to raise it's Temperature even HIGHER! The sides of the Sheet are then pinned, so that I can NOT throw it off. This \"COLD SHEET\" draws-out the POISONS and TOXINS, that have come to my Skin's Surface as a result of the HOT Bath! STEP 5:"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Now, my wife helps me go into Bed. The Bed has been prepared by putting a Plastic or Rubber Sheet over the Mattress, then a Cotton, Wool, Linen, or Silk Sheet (ANY Material that BREATHES - NO Synthetics) is laid over that. I lie down, while wrapped in the \"COLD SHEET\" and another dry, Non-Synthetic Sheet is put over me, and then I am covered with Non-Synthetic Blankets. STEP 6: Lastly, with my Feet uncovered, my Feet and Ankles are oiled with Olive Oil, a thick Paste of Vaseline (VEGELATUM - Vegetable-based Substitute is preferable) is then applied and the Garlic Paste. Garlic Paste is made with Vinegar, is applied to the Bottoms of my Feet to help get RID of ANY Infections in the System. I use 2-inch gauze or torn, White Cotton Strips as a Bandage to hold the Garlic Paste on the Sole of the Foot. White, Cotton or Wool Socks are placed over the bandaged Feet. Then, my feet are again COVERED with the \"COLD SHEET\". The bottom of this \"COLD SHEET\" is pinned, so I am in a WET Sack. Then the DRY Sheets and Blankets are pulled over my Feet for WARMTH. If you have to urinate, then just do it where you are, and do NOT take the \"COLD SHEET\" OFF!! The Urine won't HURT anything, and it's NOT worth being REWRAPPED in the \"COLD SHEET\" and then having the Garlic Paste REAPPLIED! STEP 7: I stay in the Sheets OVERNIGHT and, by the Morning, the Sheets have turned Multi- Colored from ALL of the POISONS and TOXINS, that have been drawn OUT of the body. Dr. Christopher said that sometimes the Sheets turn ALL Shades of Purple, Yellow, Black and Green. These are the different POISONS and TOXINS, that have been in the Person for Years - sometimes for the Person's WHOLE Life! STEP 8: In the Morning, I get brushing with a sponge from my wife. I love this part."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"I take 1 Part each of WARM Apple Cider Vinegar and Distilled Water to get the remaining POISONS and TOXINS out of the Pores. Then, I get dressed into CLEAN Clothes and I am back to Bed. I only eat Fruit and Vegetable Juices, Herbal Teas, and lots of Distilled Water for the next 3 days, s to provide a TOTAL Cleansing. Juice fasting is something that youy should definitevly try before you try hypertermia!"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Why Most Herbal Formulas Don't Work! A Message from Dr. Richard Schulze - A Master Herbalist When I first started my own healing journey in the 1960's, one of my first great shocks was that most health products didn't work. This included all of the herbal formulas I tried. I was constantly amazed at the weakness of these so-called intense herbal formulas that were supposed to change my life. They didn't. I would take them diligently and nothing would happen. Out of frustration, and my own illness, I remember taking 20 to 100 times the dosages, the whole bottle, and still little or no effect. In order to get myself well from a terminal heart disease, I had to break all the rules and make it up as I went. Because I broke the rules, I got well. In the 1970's, I started helping others get well and opened up my clinic. From the early days of my clinical practice, I was especially interested in helping people with serious illness and degenerative diseases. Almost all other graduates from the various institutes I attended worked mainly on young, healthy people who wanted to be a bit healthier, but I was obsessed with emergency treatment and the sick and dying. The same useless herbal formulas that failed me years before were now failing to help any of my patients. They thought they were doing something wrong and this is why they were coming to see me. I was forced to improve upon the crude formulas I had developed to heal myself and also create new formulas that worked. Why were all the herbal formulas useless? Why didn't they work? As far as I could see, there were three main reasons for this. Reason #1: Antique Formulas Many of the herbal formulas available were designed in the middle-to-late 1800's, some even earlier. The 1800's were very different times. Today, we have junk food restaurants on every corner, get less exercise and have more stress than probably ever before in history. What it took to stimulate and cleanse Wyatt Earp and Buffalo Bill 150 years ago doesn't work today. Even some of the more modern herbal formula available were still designed in the 1940's or l950's. This is still over 40 years ago when herbs were looked at as a cute little hobby to alleviate headaches and tired feet, not cure life-threatening disease. Many other modern formulas are just remakes of these ancient formulas; the herbs are just shuffled and a so-called new formula is dealt. These formulas just don't work. Reason #2: Weak formulas, wimpy dosages, poor manufacturing and poor quality herbs Most modern American natural healers and herbalists have been educated and grew up in a hostile legal and political environment. Recent history reveals that the AMA and other organizations have been on a witch-hunt for practicing herbalists and have jailed many. Out of fear, most herbalists and manufacturers want to make sure that no one ever gets a strong action or has any reactions with their products, even a cleansing reaction. They feel it's far safer to make products that have little or no effect. Like medical doctors today, treatment and"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"therapy parameters are designed by the hospital legal departments to minimize financial repercussions and malpractice law-suits, not always what is best for the patient. One way these herbal manufacturers assure their safety, not your health, is to design formula with very small amounts of the potent herbs, or none at all. Then, to be really safe, they suggest a dosage that is so low it's useless. They don't want to take any risks. To further weaken any potency, many manufacturers have abandoned the tried-and-true methods of old herbalists for quick extraction processes, high tech (high heat) machinery, freeze-dried herbs, ignoring the moons and seasons, mostly to make a quick buck. The result, most herbal products I see today are worthless junk. Many manufacturers are more concerned that their product tastes good or has a great-looking label than with whether you will get well using it. I also see labels loaded with sophisticated laboratory-testing results for potency, trying to convince you that the colorless, tasteless and odorless water inside will actually benefit you. How stupid do they think we are? One of the worst aspects of many herbal formulas today is the poor quality of herbs used. The vast majority of herbal products are made from herbs grown outside the US. There is only one reason for this: they are cheap. Herbs brought in from India, China, Egypt, Mexico or Eastern Europe cost literally pennies a pound. I never used these poor quality herbs in my clinic. I always used American organically grown herbs that can cost over 20 times as much. I have visited these countries and found filthy, disgusting growing conditions, toxic pollution and out-of-control use of pesticides and insecticides. When we travel to these countries, we don't drink the water, don't even eat the food. Then why would we want to use herbs grown there? In the last two years, there have been numerous people getting sick after using famous herbal formulas because the herbs were contaminated with human fecal waste. If this isn't bad enough, most of these contaminated herbs, when brought into the United States, are gassed with Ethylene Oxide, an antibacterial gas that is known to cause cancer and also cause mutations in unborn children. In fact, the vast majority of organic herbs are even sterilized with this gas because the manufacturers are scared to use unsterilized herbs. In the last two years, I have done much to expose this corruption and I have been attacked by almost everyone in the herb industry, even my so-called friends. Even though they are well-aware of the problems, I have affected their income and they are plenty mad. Even the ones who haven't attacked me wont go on record to expose the industry or speak the truth. Most of my colleagues, out of fear of prosecution, write books and magazine articles, gather at meetings of their guilds, run schools and teach, but rarely have ever worked with a patient. It is illegal for an American herbalist to run a clinic and cure patients from illness and disease using American Herbs. This leads to the 3 rd reason why most herbal formulas don't work. Reason #3: Theory, not practical, clinical experience Why is it that most modern herbal formulas, designed by many of my colleagues, don't work? As I walk down the isles of modern day health food stores, I see hundreds of herbal products and recognize many of the names on the bottles. Many are my students and many are friends, but few of these armchair herbalists ever ran a clinic and would know the difference between a heart attack and indigestion. What they don't tell you on the bottle is that they developed these formulas after countless hours of research reading books and searching computer data bases, but they have had no clinical results or cures. You may be the first human to ever put these formulas in your mouth. A few of their herbal hypothesis are good, and in years, probably decades, some might prove to be important discoveries. I also know most of these formula will be tossed in the garbage where they belong."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" Running my clinic, I learned very quickly what it takes to get people well. Theories don't, hypothesis don't, but quality herbs, potent formulas and large dosages do. The formulas, dosages and programs on the following pages are the result of 10 years of healing myself and an additional 18 years of clinical experience. They work!"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Natural Mineral and Vitamin Supplements The HONEST STORY. Dr. Richard Schulze: From a letter by Dr. Richard Schulze, the formulator of SuperFood. \"In my many years as a Nutritional Consultant I have seen many philosophies and products come and go. I have seen the fads, the cure-alls, and the laziness in all of us that wants a pill to replace a sound nutritional program. Nutritional fads can even be dangerous by consuming large amounts of trace elements that we only need in microscopic amounts, or maybe none at all such as the latest toxic fads of silver and chrome. \"I used to prescribe only the best vitamins and minerals to my patients. I knew that these products were in a base of natural ingredients and herbs, but wondered what the actual vitamins and minerals were made out of, I had assumed food. \"All vitamin and mineral supplements currently made are NOT blended foods. In fact most are made from very undesirable, even horrifying substances. If you look on your current bottle of nutrients, it will state it contains many vitamins, minerals, and a long list of no's like starch, wheat, cellulose, soy, lactose etc. It will even be in a base of herbs but you will notice that it doesn't state what the actual vitamins and minerals are made from. I can tell you right now no one is grinding up fresh raw vegetables and organic grains to make these pills. \"Commercial grade vitamin and mineral concentrates are synthesized by the big pharmaceutical and chemical industries from the same starting material that drugs are made from, (coal tar, petroleum products, animal by-products / waste and fecal matter, ground rocks, stones, shells and metal. They are then wholesaled out to the various nutrient manufacturers. The manufacturers are just mixing middlemen. Most of them don't even know how these various vitamins and minerals are made, or from what, nobody asks. Everybody just assumes a vitamin is a vitamin. \"After all The United States Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.) states that if a product looks similar under a microscope, or in analysis, that it is the same regardless of what it is made out of. For instance salicylic acid u.s.p. is considered identical whether it comes from wintergreen leaves or by boiling coal in carbolic and sulfuric acids. It also considers glycerin u.s.p. identical whether it is made from fresh vegetables, toxic minerals or boiled down animal carcasses, cartilage and feet. Does it make a difference to you? \"The Vitamins: Many so-called natural vitamins are made from horrible substances. \"All the vitamin B-12, cyanocobalamin, on the market is made from either ground up toxic cow livers or activated sewage sludge. These cow livers are overloaded with steroids and antibiotics, and the pesticides the cow assimilates while eating. The sewage sludge is just"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"that, fecal matter. In today's environment of depressed immune diseases I can think of hundreds of reasons that these materials would be a health risk, not benefit. Just because a so- called natural substance, (fecal matter is natural), is high in a particular vitamin, does that also mean it is a good food? \"Vitamin A from fish liver juices loaded with toxic PCB's and mercury, B vitamins from coal tar and petro-chemicals known central nervous system depressants, respiratory irritants and carcinogens, Vitamin C from acid blends irritating to the lining of the digestive tract, Vitamin D from radiated oil, Vitamin E from Eastman Kodak, need I say anymore? \"The Minerals: All minerals used in nutrient manufacture are basically dirt. The iron, calcium, zinc etc. are just mined ore, pulverized and powdered to a fine dust. This doesn't make it any easier to assimilate. Some calcium is made from ground up oyster shells. This reminds me of when I was a kid watching the Three Stooges fix dinner, they would throw the oysters away and try and chew the shells. We all laughed at them and now we are doing the same thing. Modern research shows us that minerals of this type are 99% inassimilable. The manufacturers response to this is to add pig digestive enzymes, which supposedly pre-digests it or chelates it, in their attempts to force our body to accept this toxic material. Is this practice of chelating minerals really to our benefit or a dangerous act of ignorance? \"We are currently entering a new era of nutrition. It is no longer a matter of how many milligrams you take of a particular nutrient but how much of what you are taking is actually getting into your bloodstream, and the organs that need it. And even more important, what are these vitamins and minerals made from and do they have toxic side effects. If you are like me, and are horrified by this information, then try my SUPERFOOD. \"Let's stop eating toxic chemicals, animal waste and rocks and get back to eating food, SUPERFOOD!\" Dr. Schulze’s formula for Super Foods calls for the use of only Organic and Wildcrafted ingredients. There are 12 ingredients in all and is best described as an Herbal Vitamin and Mineral Foods Concentrate. Dr. Schulze himself has this to say about it, \"This perfectly balanced blend of SuperFoods is specifically formulated to supply you with Natural Foods Source Vitamins, Minerals, Amino Acids and Essential Trace Nutrients. These are Nature’s Nutrients, not man made synthetic vitamins. All ingredients are from the richest, whole food sources on the planet. This zero fat formula will give you quick energy and not slow you down. It tastes great and should be the foundation of any health program because it is nutrients that build your body and your health. Dr. Schulze had a clinic which specialized in patients which were considered \"hopeless and incurable\" and he cured thousands by first having them eat his SuperFood formula each day – 4 tablespoons. Those of us who are in better health condition also see great benefit from using the ingredients in Dr. Schulze’s SuperFood Formula. Very few of us eat a regular diet that is comparable in quality to SuperFood."}]
