Receiving a degree in Theoretical Physics from Washington State University in 1966, he spent over a decade in bio-medical research and development for some of the most prestigious and technically sophisticated corporations in the United States, including The Boeing Company and E. I. Dupont de Nemours Co. He worked for several years in the department of anesthesiology of the University of Washington, incorporating his skills both in medicine and physics, and has been published in several international journals for his work both in physics and parapsychology. He has taught parapsychology for credit in the natural sciences at several universities and colleges. He has also taught courses in shamanism, magic, alchemy, and growing herbs as a cash crop. In 1972 he formed The Beltane Corporation, now The Beltane Herb Company, specializing in the selling and study of herbs, spices, and books focusing on herbs, health, and the occult. He later became agricultural scientist and buyer for Western Herb Frams, Inc. As a physicist he has invented several critical pieces of farm machinery to assist the small farmer in harvesting and processing. As an agricultural scientist he has developed specific farm plans and crop sources to compete with currently imported spices and herbs, and he publishes a newsletter, The Herb Market Report, which is considered one of the best on the subject. He is also contributing editor to Acres USA. He continues to research and employ the best of highly technical methods in a harmonious and non-injurious way."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction Purpose To provide the explorer with concise information on various legal psychotropic botanicals currently available. Orientation To provide ritual use of mind-altering sacramental herbs. Ritual is the outward manifestation of the need in man to break the barriers of the ego in order to become a part of something greater. It is the visible form of an inward or spiritual grace. Rites are calculated to arouse the sentiments that support a given goal. Ritual is valuable because 1. It organizes experience. The manner in which an experience is \"perceived\" will determine possible ways that experience might be used. This allows more conscious control of our growth and development. 2. It lends grace and style to action, preventing clumsy uncertainty, wasted energy, and distractions. 3. It enhances the general atmosphere by using specific symbolism. In psychology, ritual is considered the celebration of a myth, which is achieved through a carefully constructed enactment of the myth. Because ritual is the externalization of something internal, myth has a more archetypal (*) than logical structure to it. Rituals reveal values at their most fundamental level. Man expresses in ritual what moves him most. Therefore: The symbol always originates on the inside and is projected outward. Ceremonies and rituals are the means provided by society for periodically drawing up the energy attached to symbols. As symbols sink back into the unconscious, ritual serves as a technique to bring them back into a more common awareness. Magic has been defined as \"the science and art of causing changes to occur in conformity with will.\" What this means is that conflict occurs when people are not living their true will. The purpose in learning magic is to discover that true will (not necessarily desire) and then live it. Therefore: Every intentional act is a magical act. Whenever individuals change their perception of reality, they also change the ways reality can affect them. This has to do with attitudes, expectations, and projections. Therefore: Whenever individuals take a mind alterant, they are (by definition) performing an act of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"magic. Rituals can thus be used to \"program\" a religious awakening to create a deeper awareness of the spiritual. The art of magic is science combined with ritual. The chemistry of each herb in this book has been thoroughly examined to determine how it affects conscious perception of reality. This information will enable individuals to control their experience, and as a result, give them more control over who they become. ---- [*] \"... the archetypes, as structural forming elements in the unconscious, give rise both to the fantasy lives in individual children and to the mythologies of a people.\" — C.G.Jung ---- Some of the materials discussed are quite dangerous. Notes of caution are included because many people have already shown interest in experimenting with them. I feel it is important to discuss these botanicals, while at the same time making sure their potential dangers are understood. Although I am confident about the accuracy of this information, I cannot assume responsibility for the experiences of people following these traditions for personal drug use. It is wise to use very small portions at first when experimenting with unfamiliar substances. The biochemistry of one person may be different from that of another. Some individuals are allergic (*) to substances upon which others thrive. Also, one's body needs may vary at different times. If any undesirable effects are felt, it is advisable to discontinue use of that substance. If there are no effects, desirable or undesirable, gradually and cautiously increase the quantity of the herb. Experimentation is what this is all about. Spirituality does not lie in what you are doing, but rather in how you do it. There is no greater reflection of true will than personal experience. As Aleister Crawley quoted Rabelais in his Liber al vel Legis, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\" ---- [*] An allergic study can be made by scratching the skin with a sterilized pin and a sample of the herb considered. Scratches should be one-half inch long and not draw blood. If the scratch creates an irritation within an hour, you will probably experience an unpleasant side effect from the herb in question. ----"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"1 - Stimulants Damiana - A sacrament to improve and tone sexuality l Family: Tumeraceae. l Botanical Name: Tumera diffusa. l Synonyms: Mexican damiana. l Geographical Location: Tropical parts of the Americas, particularly Texas and Mexico.

The leaves are smooth and pale green on the upper side and smooth on the undersides except for a few hairs on the ribs. The flowers are yellow, arising singly from the axilla of the leaves"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"followed by a one-celled capsule splitting into three pieces. The flower has an aromatic smell and a bitter taste. History Many women in Mexico have found that a cup of damiana tea taken one or two hours before intercourse helps to immerse them in the sex act. It is believed to have a tonic effect upon the sexual organs and the nervous system. Most effective when used in combination with saw palmetto berries (Serenoa repens) in a 1:1 ratio. Chemistry The leaf contains 0.2-0.9% volatile oil, 14% resin, approximately 3.5% tannin, 6% starch, and a bitter substance called damianian. Primary Effects Mild aphrodisiac and marijuana-like euphoria, lasting about an hour and a half. Preparation In his book, A Manual of Sex Magick, Louis J. Culling describes a damiana drink preparation: Take 2 heaping tablespoons of dried damiana leaves and boil them in 1 cup of water for five minutes. Cool, strain, and drink in the evening. He recommends continual use over a two-week period for significant results. Ritual Use Below is a fine recipe for an aphrodisiacal cordial of damiana. Soak 1 ounce of damiana leaves in 1 pint of vodka for five days. Pour off the liquid, strain, and filter through a conical paper coffee filter. Soak remaining alcohol-drenched leaves in 3/4 pint of distilled or spring water for another five days. Pour off the liquids, strain, and filter as before. Warm water extracts to 160ºF and dissolve in 1/2 to 1 cup of honey. Combine alcoholic and aqueous extractions. Age for one month. During the aging a sediment will form as the liqueur clarifies. The sediment is harmless but you may wish to siphon the clear liqueur from it. For best results, take 1 or 2 cordial glasses of the beverage nightly. The taste is exquisite. Small quantities of liqueur are excellent for any ritual oriented toward sex magic. Although its chemistry is unknown, damiana can be used as a sacrament to improve and tone sexuality.

The leaves have three to five lobes with finely serrated edges and solitary white flowers containing a purple, blue, or pink crown in the center. The ripe fruit, oval-shaped and orange, is called a maypop. The maypop berry contains many seeds and the yellow pulp inside is sweet and edible. History The name passionflower, from the Latin passiflora, comes from the symbolic relationship between the anatomical and numerical arrangement of the flowers and the elements of the crucifixion, the passion of Jesus Christ. The finely cut corona in the center of the blossom resembles the crown of thorns; the petals and sepals symbolize the Apostles."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Chemistry Harmine and related alkaloids. Called a psychic sedative. Isomer harmaline has been tried in Parkinsonism. It is a very potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor. (See Yohimbe, Note of Caution) Harmine Primary Effects When smoked, a very mild, short-lasting marijuana-like high occurs. It acts as both a sedative and a tranquillizer. In larger quantities, it acts more like a hallucinogen. Preparation Usually smoked in combination with damiana, scullcap, and spearmint or peppermint (for flavor). (See recipe for Yuba Gold) Ritual Use Alchemy has a number of interesting faces. With symbolism, various elements are classified into a system of qualities. By appropriately mixing these qualities, new elements are created. An example would be combining the heat of fire with the wetness of water, thus creating air which is hot and wet. A more contemporary example is: \"Although the person had never lectured before, he was excellent because he had the qualities of enthusiasm and knowledge about the subject.\" Imagination is one of the great pointers to reality. It is the creative part which enables us to survive and \"progress.\" By taking imagination seriously, beyond the level of mere personal fantasy, it tends to structure itself to major archetypal patterns. Synchronicity is the key. By using tables of correspondences (Liber 777, for example) to project and create the archetype, a literal reality is created.

History"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"In 1930 it was estimated that there were at least 20 million betel chewers in India. One betel palm produces about 250 seeds or nuts per year and millions of these trees are under cultivation. It is one of the world's most popular plants, yet few Western people have ever heard of it. The leaf is converted into paper for rolling tobaccos and herbs. Regular use of betel nut, in time, stains the mouth, gums, and teeth a deep red. Asain betel chewers, however, are quite proud of these stains. Chemistry Arecoline, a volatile oil, is released from the nut by saliva and lime (calcium oxide). Betel leaf contains chavicol, allylpyrocathechol, chavibetol, and cadinene. Arecoline Arecoline is in the same cholinergic alkaloids group as muscarine, found in the divine mushroom, soma. (See Fly Agaric.) Primary Effects Mix 1/2 gram of burnt lime (hydrated calcium oxide) with one betel nut, preferably in a semi- powdered form. Place in the side of the mouth like a plug of tobacco for two hours, spitting the saliva occasionally. Because of the primary effects of arecoline, betel nut is well suited for manual labor. This central nervous system (CNS) stimulant also makes a journey more vivid because it affects one's perception of time. The herb is perfect for weekend journeys to friends in the country, or for ceremonial work on your land. Ritual Use The Malayan technique for using betel nut is to mix a mashed or powdered betel nut, some catechu gum from the Malayan acacia tree (Acacia catechu), a pinch of burnt lime, and a dash of nutmeg, cardamom, or turmeric for flavor. This mash is then rolled up in a leaf from the betel vine (Piper chavica betel)."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"These betel morsels are sold on the streets in markets as candy (with no current government control). Note of Caution: Excessive arecoline from either overuse or chewing unripe areca nuts, which contain larger quantities of the oil, can cause inebriation, dizziness, and diarrhea. Also, prolonged use causes damage to the teeth and soft tissues of the mouth. ~~~~ Betel nut is considered an aphrodisiac because it stimulates available energy and elevates moods. It is currently used like coffee or cigarettes in this country. ~~~~ Mormon Tea - A stimulant sacrament to improve breathing l Family: Gnetaceae l Botanical Name: Ephedra nevadensis. l Synonyms: Stick tea, desert tea, squaw tea, brigham weed, teamsters tea, and popotillo. l Geographical Location: Native to the southwestern United States and Mexico. The variety of ephedra presently used in most commercial preparations is Ephedra gerardiana (Wall.) Satpf., commonly known as ma Huang. It is imported directly from China. Two similar plants, E. sinica and E. equisentina, are found in northern China from Sinkian to Hopen Province and north to outer Mongolia."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"l Habitat: Prefers deserts and dry mountainsides with good drainage. l Botanical Description: The herb has both male and female flowers. The males, with stamens, are found on catkins, while the females, with pistils, rise from a two-leaved flower branch supported on axillary stalks coming from the stems. The fruit consists of two pistil-like capsules containing a juicy cone-shaped seed in each capsule. The stems or branches are slender and erect with small leaves somewhat like scales on the stem. History Chinese ephedra has been used medicinally for more than five thousand years. In 2700 B.C., Shen Mung, the father of Chinese medicine, used the dried roots and stems as a decongestant to treat coughs, colds, headaches, and fever. Its Chinese name is ma huang. Some species of ephedra were made into a fermented drink and used ceremonially by Vedic and Zoroastrian priests for Tantric lunar rites. Chemistry Mormon tea contains ephedrine, d-norpseudoephedrine, and tannin. Ephedrine produces most of the effects of sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Ephedrine Sulfate (Ma Huang) Ma Huang has four times the effect of ephedrine to Mormon tea because pseudoephedrine has less vascular action, but maintains bronchial effect. They both cost the same per pound. Primary Effects Powerful decongestant and stimulant. Blood pressure may rise moderately; heart rate and cardiac output are increased. Bronchi are relaxed and dilated."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Preparation The Chinese technique is to bring a large pan of water to boil. Put 1 to 2 ounces of Mormon tea (or ma huang) into the boiling water and cover. Allow to boil for five minutes, then turn down the heat. Three or 4 cups of the liquid should produce the desired effect. Ritual Use The breath is considered the source of life in China. Any herb that improved breathing was considered a sacrament. A simple ritual used today involves the herb ma huang and Tiger Balm (an ointment containing camphor): The herb is left on the stove for several days so that fermentation occurs. The water is usually brought to a boil at least once a day. After the fourth day, the brew becomes quite strong and is considered a stimulant. Breathing is improved by placing Tiger Balm on the lip under the nose and inhaling the fumes of ma huang. After doing this for five minutes, drink 3 to 4 cups of the liquid. It will be obvious that the resultant increase in energy is directly related to more relaxed breathing. Note of Caution: If used in excess (i.e., every day for three weeks), there is the possibility of losing elasticity in the blood vessels and bronchial tubes. Also, Mormon tea and Chinese ephedra produces vertigo, nervousness, and insomnia with prolonged use. It should not be used if one suffers from high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or thyroid problems. ~~~~ Ephedrine is used extensively in cases of asthma to produce bronchial dilation. Epenepherine and Empirin with codeine contain ephedrine as the principle activant. ~~~~"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Guarana - A sacrament for fasting l Family: Sapindaceae (Soapberry family). l Botanical Name: Paullinia cupana. l Synonyms: Panela supana, Brazilian cocoa, and uabano. l Geographical Location: South America, particularly north and west Brazil and Venezuela. l Habitat: Tropical jungles. l Botanical Description: A climbing shrub with divided compound leaves. The flowers are yellow in an open cluster. The three-celled capsuled fruit contains seeds resembling small horse chestnuts. The fresh seeds are flesh-colored and are easily separated from the fruit after drying. These seeds are washed and roasted for six hours before use. History Many weight problems in the United States stem from diet and eating habits and patterns. An example is the tradition of having three daily meals. An ancient Chinese legend says that once God requested the Ox-god to tell man he needed to eat only once every third day. The Ox-god was forgetful and accidentally told man he needed to eat three times each day—hence our myth of three meals per day. This was nine times more food than man needed to eat, and there was no way that quantity of food could be produced. As punishment, God made the Ox-god a beast of burden, to serve man and help produce the huge quantity of food. The ox is considered sacred in most Eastern countries today.

It was also used by Brazilian miners as a preventative for many diseases. Mainly, though, guarana is one of the main ingredients in a favorite diet beverage in Brazil. Chemistry Guarana falls into the methylated purine group containing 5% caffeine, three times as much as is found in normal coffee. Guarana is considered the strongest naturally occurring methylxanthine. It has the same chemical composition as caffeine, theine, and cocaine, and the same physiological action. Other methylated purines are: l 1. Coffee. From Coffea arabica, an Arabian bush; beans contain 1% to 2% caffeine. l 2. Tea. From Camelia sinensis, an Asian bush; leaves contain 2% to 4% caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. l 3. Cacao.

Mate In many traditions, the physical body is considered a temple. It is a direct mirror of the state of mind, reflecting whether a person is happy or not. In most societies, fasting has long been considered one of the finest disciplines for uniting mind and body. Guarana can be used as a training sacrament for achieving conscious control over the physical body through the technique of fasting. Consider the following schedule as an exercise: l 1. First month, fast one day per week, arbitrarily chosen but adhered to rigorously. This means no food, only water or tea (with guarana). Keep a journal, reporting psychological outlook. l 2. Second month, fast two days—not consecutively—each week. l 3. Third month, add a third day of fasting every other week. Observe change in your psychology. Develop your own schedule.

A small piece of seed is chewed before meals to promote digestion and to improve the flavor of anything eaten after it. The powder is also applied to cuts. Chemistry Kola nut contains 3% caffeine, as well as theobromine and kolanin (a glucoside). It also contains some tannin and starch. Caffeine stimulates all parts of the central nervous system, especially the cerebral cortex and medullary center. Kolanin is a source for carbohydrates, the \"fuel\" needed for the body's energy. This combination of theobromine and kolanin aids the combustion of fats and carbohydrates. It also reduces combustion of nitrogen and phosphorus in the body. Caffeine + Theobromine Primary Effects Stimulates and economizes muscular and nervous energies; considered a strong stimulant.

It is the single,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"strongest emotion-alterant available that can be disciplined and it is the foundation of Tantra. A path to the use of this psychosexual power begins by recognizing and then overcoming restrictive sexual prejudices. The first place to start is by cultivating intense gonadal awareness through the conscious tightening of the pelvic region. This is accomplished through deliberate contraction and relaxation of the anal and urethral muscles. Two suggested exercises in Sexual Occultism by John Mumford have been used in Tantric yoga for thousands of years in India and the Middle East. These particular exercises can be used as a ritual to heighten orgasms. Exercise One: To control ejaculation and orgasm (Muladhara Bandha). This exercise is a pelvic contraction lock that begins at the anal muscles and spreads forward to the genitals. The correct feeling of the anal lock is like the sensation you feel when you retain an enema or hold back the passage of stool from the bowel. The method: l 1. Sit erect in a comfortable position, hands palm-up on thighs. l 2. Focus attention on anal region. Begin with an awareness of the chair exerting pressure up against your behind. Pinpoint consciousness to anus. l 3. Inhale one-half lungful of air, swallow, and hold breath. l 4. Slowly contract the anus while holding breath. Continue to hold breath. l 5. Women should spread the pelvic area forward from the anus until a distinct twitch is felt in the vaginal lips. Men should spread the pelvic region forward from the anus until a distinct pull is felt on the testicles. l 6. Now release pelvic contraction totally. Inhale and then exhale fully. l 7. Repeat ten times when first practicing this exercise. Gradually increase to fifty repetitions per exercise period. The advantages of this exercise are as follows: l 1. It tightens slack vaginal walls in women, and it reduces tendency for premature ejaculation in men. l 2. It sends a blood flush to the urogenital system. l 3. It tones anal muscles, which can prevent and even cure hemorrhoids and other anal disorders. l 4. It awakens the Muladhara chakra. Exercise Two: To increase erectile potency and clitoral sensitivity (Vajroli Mudra). This exercise involves the urethral sphincter closure, with which you cut off the flow of urine in midstream while voiding. As a preliminary step to this exercise, drink several pints of water or beer on an empty stomach. In one hour empty the bladder. As you do, practice cutting off and restraining the urine flow at least a dozen times while the bladder drains. The method: l 1. Sit erect in a comfortable position, hands palm-up on thighs."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"l 2. Focus attention on urethral sphincter. This is below the clitoris for women and at the base of the penis in men. l 3. Inhale one-half lungful of air, swallow, and hold breath. l 4. Contract the urethral orifice exactly as if cutting off the urine flow. At the same time, pull up on the lower abdomen, as if attempting to suck your genitals into the pelvis. Relax contraction and repeat as many times as possible while holding your breath. Allow sexual excitement to occur. l 5. Cease contractions, relax abdomen, inhale, and then exhale fully. A woman may check to see whether she is performing the exercise correctly by inserting one or two fingers into the vagina during the exercise. If performed correctly, contractions should cause the vagina to close on the fingers. A man may perform the exercise naked in front of the mirror and watch to see whether the head of the penis twitches or elevates slightly with each contraction. The advantages of this exercise are as follows: l 1. It increases clitoral sensitivity in women and erectile potency in men. l 2. It sends a blood flush to the urogenital system. l 3. It tones the urethral sphincter, curing urinary stress incontinence. l 4. It awakens the Svadhisthana chakra. Muladhara Bandha should be followed by Vajroli Mudra daily, starting with ten of each. You should add five of each per day each week until you are doing sixty of each per day. These exercises develop pelvic thrust ability in males and pelvic gripping power in the females. This enhances sensitivity and control in both sexes during intercourse. Note of Caution: Excessive use of caffeine over long periods can be debilitating to the sexual function. It may also cause nervousness, insomnia, and habituation. ~~~~ Kola nut is classified as a nerve stimulant and true aphrodisiac.

The erect, angular stem grows from 6 inches to 3 feet tall and is hairy with a milky sap. The leaves are thin and light green in an ovoid shape, hairy with blunt sawlike teeth on the edge. Numerous small blue flowers growing in spinelike pods are arranged in succession at the top of the stem. The fruit is a two-celled oval capsule containing numerous small brown seeds. History In North America, lobelia found its way into medicine in 1785. Cutler, in his account of herbs, states that when the leaves were chewed, they \"produced giddiness and pain of the head, with trembling agitation.\" The Penobscot of eastern North America used it as a tobacco in the early nineteenth century. A similar species was smoked by the Mapuche of Chile for the narcotic effect. They called the weed tuba or tobaca del diablo. Chemistry Active alkaloids are lobeline, lobelanidine, and norlobelanidine. Although these constituents are not known to have hallucinogenic effects, d-lobeline is a carotid body stimulant. Lobeline Sulfate (Nikoban) Primary Effects When very small quantities are added to a cigarette and smoked, the effect is a mild marijuana-like euphoria.

Botanical Name: Scuttellaria laterifoli. Synonyms: Mad dogweed, blue pimpernel, hoodwort. Geographical Location: East coast of United States from Connecticut south to Florida and as far west as Texas. Also found in Europe. Habitat: Indigenous herb, growing in damp places, meadows, ditches, and alongside ponds. Flowers in July and August. Botanical Description: A perennial with a big porous, yellow rootstock that produces a branching stem growing from 1 to 3 feet in height. The leaves grow in opposite pairs up the stem and have sawlike points on the edge and a point at the end. The flowers grow from axils at the stem and are two- lipped; pale purple or blue in color. History Ancient herbalists named this herb scullcap because blossoms resembled the human skull. It has also been known as mad dogweed and madweed because it cured hydrophobia. The herbalist's guide for determining the use of a herb such as scullcap was termed \"the doctrine of signatures.\" They took into consideration the shape and color of the plant's leaves and flowers and used them as clues to which organs of the body would respond to medicines prepared with these herbs. 1. Red is the color of the blood. It was concluded that plants bearing red flowers would act on the blood. As research now indicates, red-flowered plants are rich in iron for the hemoglobin of the blood. An example is red clover. 2. Blue is a soothing sedative color. Plants with blue flowers are rich in potassium and phosphorus, minerals that are helpful to the brain and nerves. Examples are scullcap, valerian, and vervain. 3. Yellow suggests bile; so herbs with yellow blossoms were given for digestive, liver, and gall bladder disorders. Yellow-flowered plants have an abundance of sodium, the mineral associated with digestion and liver secretions.

If it is smoked, the effects are similar to those of marijuana. It is most soothing to the mind and nerves and should be considered in all fear states, when there is mental confusion and inability to concentrate. Preparation Steep 1 ounce of scullcap in a pint of very hot water for twenty minutes. Drink 3 to 4 cups for the most pronounced effects. Ritual Use Tantric yoga techniques have traditionally been used for self-development, using the male-female concept as a source of energy. There are a number of techniques in this system that can be used to physically heal ailments that range from urinary infections to mental disorders. The ritual described below is a healing exercise that only works if the visualization required is strong. l 1. Drink scullcap tea. l 2. Face each other, man and woman, naked, and in a comfortable sitting position. l 3. The woman sits with her hands in her lap. The man places his right hand on the top of her head, his left hand over her stomach. l 4. The man then visualizes a large white ball of light originating over his head. This white ball then descends down into his head, through his right hand, down the woman's body, and out through his left hand. This energy is then visualized as circulating up his body, through his right hand, and down her body, again, forming a circular path. l 5. The woman visualizes this energy going down her body. She then directs it to the place that needs healing, chosen before the ritual. When she feels the energy in that place, she chants AUM once. l 6. When the woman has finished chanting, the couple repeats the ritual, reversing roles. The man does not chant AUM until he feels more energy at his chosen site for healing than he gave her; when he does, he then chants AUM once. l 7. When the man is finished chanting, he repeats this ritual back to the woman, again with her chanting AUM only when she feels more energy than she did the first time. l 8. This ritual is continued four to five times until each falls back exhausted. A slower form of lovemaking may occur at this time. If this exercise is repeated each night for one week, the possibilities for healing are limitless. Note of Caution: It is not recommended that scullcap be used in combination with any pharmaceutical tranquillizers. It is strong in itself, and the chemistry has yet to be identified. ~~~~ Scullcap is good for eliminating headaches and easing fitful sleeping."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"~~~~ Valerian Root - A sacrament for muscle relaxation and massage l Family: Valerianaceae (Valerian family). l Botanical Name: Valeriana Officinalis. l Synonyms: Valerian and vandal root. l Geographical Location: Northern Hemisphere— America, England, and especially Europe. l Habitat: Warm temperate regions near stands of water.

The flowers are small and clustered together at the top of the stem and are rose-colored to reddish, sometimes white. History The dried rhizome and roots of this herb were historically used as a nerve sedative and antispasmodic and a remedy for hysteria and other nervous complaints. It was also used for menstrual periods, and to heal both internal sores and outside wounds. Boiled with licorice, raisins, and anise seed, it was used as an expectorant for phlegm in difficult coughs and lung congestion. Its odor is very unpleasant, much like that of dirty feet. Cats, however, find it preferable to catnip, and"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"it can be stuffed into pillows for them. Chemistry The plant contains several alkaloids and glycosides as well as several resinous bodies and a brownish- yellow volatile oil. The oil is very similar to that found in valium. The total alkaloid content is only 0.1% and is composed primarily of chatinine and valerine. The volatile oil consists of formic, acetic, butyric, and valeric acid esters of borneaol, as well as pinene and camphene. Exposure to air causes decomposition of the oil. Valium The oils seem to excite the cerebrospinal system -making the head and spine perfect places for a massage! Primary Effects Muscle relaxant and mild tranquillizer.

Be sure to cover the pan so that the oils won't evaporate. Normal quantities are 1 tablespoon of valerian root per cup of water, which is approximately equivalent to a #10 Valium (10 mg)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Ritual Use Massage is one of the single most important therapies used in healing. The visualization of chi, or \"life force,\" being manipulated is a valid method for moving healing energies through the body. This life force is thought to originate in the spine with its movement going either down the legs and out through the toes, or up the back and along the arms and then out through the fingers. In all techniques of massage that use visualization of chi there are some very basic rules: 1. Once you begin to touch the body, the movement should always be away from the spine, either up the body and out through the fingers or down the legs and out through the toes. If you begin to massage the neck, then you must visualize that energy moving out through the arms and then the fingers. You should not make any movement down the back. The flow and direction of chi are very important. 2. Keep at least one hand on your partner's body (if you are reaching for oil, for example). Once you begin touching the body, you should continue that movement until the energy is brought out through the feet or the hands. 3. Eventually your hands will become tired and cramped. According to conventional medical wisdom, you have strained them from overuse. Chinese practitioners believe, however, that when this happens you have simply taken the nervous energy from your partner and brought it into your own aura. Their technique is to shake both hands, snapping the excess nervous energy off into space. It works. You relieve your cramps and your partner feels a definite loss of nervous energy. 4. The more you are able to visualize the movement of this energy, chi, the more vibrant the experience of massage is to your partner. She or he will literally feel the energy—to the point of being really surprised! 5. Foot and ear massages are more important than neck and back massages. There are more meridian points in the ear than most of the rest of the body combined. The ear symbolizes the body in a fetal position. The foot also symbolizes the entire body as well, and by learning reflexology you can enhance the healing of internal parts of the body through correct massage of the feet. Note of Caution: If you boil valerian root in water, the oils are lost, leaving only an unpleasant odor. Although the brew may smell bad, the addition of peppermint or spearmint and honey improves the taste.

It has been used for nervousness and as a sedative. It is considered milder than opium but just as \"dreamy.\" Lettuce opium was often used by Native North Americans who smoked the dried resin or sap obtained from the plant. They cut off the flower heads, gathered the sap that drained, and then let it air dry. This process was done repeatedly over a two-week period by cutting a little off the top of the remaining stem each time. Chemistry"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The leaf contains a milky juice made up of 0.2% lactucin; 50% lactucerol; lactuic acid; caoutchouc, a volatile oil; and mannite. There is also a high concentration of nitrates. The active ingredient, lactucarine (also known as lettuce opium), is very similar in structure to opium. These ingredients appear in domestic lettuce as well, but in less than one order of magnitude to wild lettuce. Primary Effects Mild narcotic and analgesic. Sedative that induces low alphoid activity rather than deep sleep. (See Thorn Apple, Primary Effects, page 102.) Most dreams occur during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, a state which is characterized by low alphoid activity. Preparation The easiest method is to dry the leaves and roots and smoke them in a large pipe. The general commercial technique, however, is to heat (not boil) the leaf in water for at least eight hours, and remove the liquid. The lactucarine goes into solution with water. A heat lamp is placed over the bowl of liquid and a fan is used to drive the water out of the extraction. The result will be a blackish gum that can be smoked best with a water pipe and hot torch. The gum should be rolled in small balls and sealed in plastic to prevent them from drying out. The hotter the flame, the better the high. A general amount is approximately 1 ounce of wild lettuce or about l/2 to 1 gram of the extract per person. Ritual Use The northern Indian schools of Tantra have a popular internal cleansing method known as shank prakshalana. This ritual is particularly well-suited to the chemical makeup of opiates. The technique almost totally flushes out the gastrointestinal tract by passing several gallons of saline solution from the mouth through the numerous convolutions of the intestinal tract and then out through the anus. This passage and then expulsion of the fluid is assisted by special asanas (postures) that squeeze the stomach and wring out the gut. Marijuana (bhang) or opium (lettuce opium could be used) is added to the shank prakshalana water at the beginning. This produces the desired trance state as the cleansing process reaches levels beyond the physical. The Hopi believe that induced dream states contain more information about reality than the conscious waking state. Their emphasis on dreams is so great that dreams are recorded for their information content and discussed each day at breakfast. Lettuce opium enhances the vividness of dreams when smoked prior to sleep. It is a good idea to keep a dream diary and review the contents at least once a week. Note: Some important details are likely to emerge that can be used to assist you in controlling your conscious states and attitudes.

And in each of us there is another whom we do not know. He speaks to us in dreams and tells us how differently he sees us from the way we see ourselves. When, therefore, we find ourselves in a different situation to which there is no solution, he can sometimes kindle a light that radically alters our attitude—the very attitude that led us into the difficult situation. Note of Caution: Homeopathic medicine recommends that anyone suffering from any form of stomach disorder, especially ulcers, should not ingest any form of lettuce. All lettuces, even domestic, contain a lettuce opium product that coats the stomach wall and reduces the digestive process; it also represses the sex drive.

A common tonic recipe is to boil 1 ounce of calamus root in 1 pint of water. Drink daily before meals. The asarone is more easily converted to TMA-2 on an empty stomach. The root deteriorates with age and should not be used after two years. The asarone has, by that time, become useless. Ritual Use Calamus was one of the constituents of an ointment that Moses was commanded to rub on his body when approaching the tabernacle: Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying 'Take thou also unto thee the chief species, of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty, and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a kin. And thou shall make it a holy anointing oil, an essence compounded after the art of the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.' (Exodus 30:22-25) The psychoactive aspects of asarone in small quantities create the effect of a stimulant. In Canada it is customary for Cree over the age of forty to chew calamus regularly in small amounts as an anti- fatigue medicine. In larger amounts it can be used as a mind-altering sacrament for the initiation of a boy into warrior status. Note of Caution: Some experiments indicate that large quantities of calamus produce tumors in rats. The amount given to produce this effect, however, is astronomical for the weight of the rat. No ill effects have been reported in any of the Cree who use it daily. In fact, they seem to be in good health. ~~~~ During the Depression, calamus root was chewed as a tobacco substitute in England.

History Kava kava has a history of religious and spiritual implications. The following Samoan legend epitomizes man's relationship to the sun, sky, water, and earth, as well as to the \"Divine Being\" or immortal self and the life cycle. It incorporates the alchemical marriage of fire, wind, water, and earth to the spiritual \"other\" of the soul. A girl of great beauty, Ui, was offered to the Sun during the annual sun ceremony. The Sun was so pleased he took her for his wife. Later she was allowed to return to her people to give birth to their child. Ui was sent flying through the sky and miscarried. The fetus, however, floated upon the water and was cared for by a hermit crab. The boy child, Tagaloa Ui, grew up and taught mortals how to make kava and to show reverence for the ceremony. Pava, the first mortal participant, had a son who laughed watching his father chew and spit the brew. Tagaloa Ui, angry at the irreverence, cut Pava's son in two. He then gave Pava the correct procedure. Pava offered the drink to Tagaloa Ui. Instead of drinking it, Tagaloa Ui poured half of the brew on the head of Pava's son, uttering \"soyva\" (life), making the boy whole again. The legend is included in the kava ceremonies of the Samoans even today. Chemistry Active components in kava are six resinous alpha pyrones: kawain (C 14 H 14 O 3 ), dihydrokawain, methysticin (C 15 H 14 O 5 ), dihydromethysticin, yangonin (C 15 H 14 O 3 ), and dihydroyangonin. None of these is water soluble except when emulsified. They are soluble in alcohol, oil, and other fat solvents, including gastric juices."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Kawain Primary Effects Small amounts produce euphoria; larger amounts produce extreme relaxation, lethargy, and eventually sleep. It does not impair mental alertness. Often there are visual and auditory hallucinations, lasting two to three hours with no hangover. Kava is similar to marijuana, as the effects are not noticed when it is used the first few times. Used habitually, kava is similar to cocaine in that it causes the mouth to feel numb. Preparation The part of the kava plant just below the surface of the ground reaches 3 to 5 inches thick in 2 1/2 to 4 years. After 6 years, the root will weigh as much as 20 pounds; after 20 years, 100 pounds. After harvesting, the root-stocks are scraped, cut into pieces, and dried in the sun on platforms. Traditionally, the root was made into a tea. With the water-soluble components released, it acted as a mild stimulating tonic. If the material is first chewed, then spit into a bowl, and mixed with coconut milk, more powerful narcotic-type resins are released in emulsion. For maximum effects, mix 1 ounce kava with 10 ounces of liquid (water or preferably coconut milk), 2 tablespoons coconut oil or olive oil, and 1 tablespoon lecithin. Blend until the liquid takes on a milky appearance. Serves one to two people. Resins may be extracted with isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol in a heat bath. The solvent is removed by evaporation. Re-dissolve in just enough warmed brandy, rum, vodka, or honey. This is a more potent method because alcohol swiftly carries the resins into the system. Ritual Use Kava's history and chemistry indicate that its euphoric qualities are best shared with special guests or friends. The narcotic affects the \"feeling\" centers where warm emotions are generated toward those involved in the ritual. Therefore, kava has been used as a sacrament for welcoming special guests and friends. The following ritual is designed for maximum results: 1.

The left hand is placed behind the back while serving the cup to the guests. He then returns to the center of the room while the guest drinks. 3. The guest receives the cup with both hands, pours a little kava onto the floor and says, \"May our guardians be with us today.\" The cup bearer raises the cup and says, \"Life.\" AU others say, \"Blessed be.\" He then drinks his kava in one gulp. The others are served. In silence, they receive the cup and drink the contents in one gulp. 4. If one accepts kava, but does not finish it, the remainder must be discarded before returning the cup. 5. When all have drunk, the lead guest says, \"The ceremony is complete. The bowl will hang with the cup and strainer.\" Light food should then be served and the party begins. Note of Caution: Continual chewing eventually destroys tooth enamel. Constant and excessive use of the fresh root with alcohol can become habit-forming and after several months results in yellowing of the skin, bloodshot and weak eyes, emaciation, diarrhea, rashes, and scaly, ulcerous skin.

Most of the Bantu-speaking peoples have traditionally used inner shavings of the bark as a stimulant and aphrodisiac. It is only used when mating rituals occur. These orgies have been known to last up to fifteen days, with doses of yohimbe increased gradually over that period. Chemistry The active constituents are yohimbine, yohimbiline, and ajmaline, all being indole-based alkaloids. The major alkaloid yohimbine can also appear as hydrochloride.

Yohimbine hydrochloride is also known as quebrachine. Primary Effects Yohimbe acts as both a central nervous system stimulant and a mild hallucinogen. Yohimbine is a sympathomimetic indoletype alkaloid with cholinergic and adrenergic blocking properties. It also inhibits serotonin, the \"fine tuning\" chemical of the brain. The first effects are a lethargic weakness of the limbs and a vague restlessness, similar to the initial effects of LSD. Chills and warm spinal shivers may also be felt, accompanied by dizziness and nausea. MDA produces a similar reaction and effect. A relaxed and somewhat inebriated mental and physical feeling, accompanied by slight auditory and visual hallucinations follows. Spinal ganglia are affected, causing an erection in males. The effects last from two to four hours. Preparation There are several techniques for preparing yohimbe. The traditional way is to bring 2 cups of water per person to a boil. One ounce of yohimbe is then added to the boiling water and allowed to boil for less than four minutes. The heat is turned down and the brew simmered for twenty minutes. Strain the liquid and sip slowly about one hour before effects are desired.

It is also recommended that you fast for eighteen hours before ingesting yohimbe. The second technique is much more efficient. For one person, soak 1 ounce of yohimbe bark shavings in ethyl alcohol or any drinking alcohol (gin or vodka works well) for an eight-hour period. Strain the shavings and pour the liquid onto a flat cookie sheet, and let the alcohol evaporate. Use low oven heat (150º-250ºF) to speed evaporation. The residue, amounting to 1 gram to 1 1/2 grams, will be yohimbine hydrochloride. This can be snuffed or placed under the tongue. The effects are more pronounced and the reaction occurs within ten to twenty minutes, rather than one hour. Ritual Use Yohimbe is the finest sacrament that can be used for a pagan wedding ceremony. Whereas Christianity uses the duality of good/evil, the pagan draws energy from the male/female duality. One type of pagan altar is arranged by marking a circle on the ground, large enough to surround those who will participate in the ceremony. The altar is set in the center of this circle. An incense burner and six candles are placed on the altar. One candle is set at each quarter, (North, East, South, and West), and two remain on the altar during the rite. An image is chosen by the betrothed and this is also placed on the altar with a wand, usually fashioned from a willow branch. The image and the material of the wand are really your choice. The marriage rite is best performed at the time of the new moon, when energy (soma) is flowing inward rather than outward. For this type of ritual, the altar is traditionally placed at the eastern edge of the ritual area. All candles are generally white, and the incense has a flower scent of the couple's choice. An ancient Celtic custom has the bride wear a veil or net and an article of red or scarlet. The couple come with gifts for each other. These are placed on the altar before the ceremony. Wine and cakes should also be present for the orgy that follows. The pledge rings are fitted over the wand and given to the priest or priestess before the ritual. To begin, the priest or priestess lights the candles and incense. They stand together with their backs to the altar (facing west), the priestess to the right of the priest. The priest holds his right hand aloft and says: May the place of this rite be consecrated before the gods.

The cap is red to reddish orange with white warts even when young. Amanita can be found in other colors ranging from orange to light brown to yellow or white, but these species can be poisonous. The gills are tree and spaced apart and are white in color. A veil is present in young specimens that forms a white collar with age. The spore print is ellipsoid and creamy white. The stem is from 1 1/2 to 12 inches high by 3/8 to 2 1/4 inches thick. It is white to yellowish white in color with small hair-like tufts along the sides of the stem. The stem is anchored to the ground by a whitish bulb. The inner flesh of the mushroom is firm and white. History The name \"fly agaric\" is derived from the amanita mushroom, which is made into a decoction to kill flies. Probably the oldest of the hallucinogenic plants and perhaps the most widespread, the amanita has been employed for centuries as an orgiastic or shamanistic inebriant by both the Ostyak and Vogul (Finno-Ugrian peoples in western Siberia), the Chukchi, Koryak, and Kamchadal of northeastern Siberia, and several Native American tribes along the Pacific Coast. It has been suggested that some ancient \"berserkers\" of Scandinavia who went on periodic orgies of killing were thrown into a mad frenzy from ingesting fly agaric. An early account of a curious Koryak custom states: When they make a feast, they pour water on some of these mushrooms and boil them. They then drink the liquor, which intoxicates them; the poorer sort, who cannot afford to lay in a store of these mushrooms, post themselves on these occasions round the huts of the rich and watch for the opportunity of the guests coming down to make water and then hold a wooden bowl to receive the urine, which they drink off greedily, as having still some virtue of the mushroom in it; and by this way they also get drunk. -Public Health Service Pub. #1645- Some 3500 years ago, Aryan people came down from the north into the Indus Valley of India, bringing with them the cult of soma (the only known plant to be deified). They worshipped this holy inebriant, drinking an extract of it in religious rites. More than a thousand hymns were composed and printed in the sacred texts known as the Rig Veda, 120 of which were devoted exclusively to soma. The Aryans were aware of the urine-drinking phenomenon as evidenced by the following quotes: Like a stag, come here to drink! Drink Soma, as much as you like. Pissing it out day by day, O generous one, You have assumed your most mighty force."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"-VIII 4.10 Rig Veda- Soma, storm cloud filled with life, Milked with milk and butter, Navel of the Path; immortal Concept, Which springs to life far from here In unison those charged with the task, The blessed do honor to Soma.

John Allegro, who wrote The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross, traces this mushroom (using Sumerian tablets from Arcad and Erech) through several cultures and finds it to be a focal point in the Christian tradition. One strong point in favor of Allegro's assertion is a fresco, circa 1291, discovered on the wall of a deserted church in Plaincourault (Indre, France) that shows Adam and Eve posed on either side of the \"Tree of Life.\" The \"Tree of Life\" is depicted as a large branched Amanita muscaria with a serpent wrapped about it. The forbidden fruit in the mouth of the serpent is clearly an apple. Allegro has also found data indicating that the entire book of Revelation, written by John the Apostle, was written entirely under the influence of soma, the fly agaric! Heaven above does not equal one half of me. Have I been drinking Soma? In my glory I have passed beyond earth and sky. Have I been drinking Soma? I will pick up the earth and put it here or there. Have I been drinking Soma? -X 119, 7-9 Rig Veda- Chemistry The main toxic constituents are muscimole, a CNS hallucinogen, ibotenic acid, a precursor to muscimole, and muscayone. Ibotenic acid easily decarboxylates and loses water to be transferred into muscimole at about 165º-175ºF. Muscimole, not a genuine constituent of living A. muscaria, is probably produced during the drying process.

Ibotenic Acid + Muscimole + Muscazone Other alkaloids present are muscaradine and muscarine. Muscarine, a psychoactive tropane, was at one time believed to be responsible for the mental effects of the mushroom. It is now understood to be present in relatively small amounts. It is difficult for this molecule to pass the blood-brain barrier, the third filter of the Vedic poets. Muscarine Primary Effects Dizziness, twitching, and possible nausea after thirty minutes followed by numbness of feet and twilight sleep for two hours, hallucinations both visual and auditory. The experience lasts from four to ten hours. Muscarine is a highly toxic hallucinogen, being a tropane. Muscimole is a CNS hallucinogen. Ibotenic acid causes flushing of the skin and lethargy or drowsiness."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Preparation The fresh mushroom should be sliced vertically in 1/2-inch segments and heated in an oven at 165º- 175ºF until dried. The muscarine will mostly evaporate out of the mushroom and the ibotenic acid alter to muscimole. It is recommended that you have a friend available to help you in any emergency. The amount eaten should be conservative, perhaps a 1/4 to a 1/2 of one mushroom with an 8-inch diameter, until you have personal data on your own body's reaction. Fasting is critical. The body does filter the muscarine, so you may wish to save the urine. Mushrooms that have dried unplucked in the ground are believed to be the most potent. Ritual Use Soma has been regarded as spiritual food, which aids the growth of the spiritual body. Initiation (where the spirit comes out anew) occurs when this chemistry affects your psychic body. It is a major hallucinogen that defies comparison. Soma is the \"flesh of the gods.\" It is therefore used in initiation ceremonies and for spiritual growth. Among the Koryaks, the women prepare the mushrooms for the men by moistening and softening them in their mouths and then by rolling them in their hands into sausage-shaped morsels. The men either chew these or swallow them whole. Usually three agarics are taken, one large and two small. Sometimes ten to twelve are eaten, but this could easily be a lethal dose. Mushrooms are also added to soups, sauces, reindeer milk, or bogberry (similar to blueberry) juice. The Kamchadals prepare a wine by fermenting a mixture of amanita and bogberry juice. The Aryans, as described in the Vedic hymns, gathered the mushrooms by the light of the full moon. The juices were then pounded out, filtered through a woolen cloth, mixed with water, milk, honey, or barleycorn infusion, and drunk during magical and religious rites. The magical balance can be seen between muscimole and muscarine: although both are hallucinogens, they produce opposite effects on the body. One counters the effect of the other. One is a food for the spiritual body, the other a poison for the physical body. Note of Caution: Although relatively small quantities of muscarine exist in A. muscaria, this is not true with other species, including A. pantherina, which is a white to yellow-white variety. Proper identification is extremely important. The standard antidote for muscarine poisoning is atropine. If one of the more lethal amanitas (A. phalloidso or A. verna or A. verosa) has been ingested, there may be some chance of saving the victim's life if l 1. There is immediate medical attention. l 2.

In their ceremonies, a willing victim was thought to be more valuable than an unwilling one, so the sacrament was used to create a more receptive atmosphere. The seed was known as tliltliltzen, the Nahuatl word for black, the suffix indicating that it was revered as sacred. Fernandez wrote of the morning glory seeds in 1573, and a Spanish record of 1629 reports that the seed in an infusion \"deprives a man of his senses and is very powerful.\" Those who used it were said to have \"communicated with the devil, believed in the owl and sucked blood.\" Today, the Mazatecs grind the seeds in a metate, wrap the meal in a linen bag, and soak it in cold water. The decoction is fairly potent and provides a curandera (healer) with information about the illness possessing the patient. It has also been used to locate lost objects. Chemistry Active ingredients are d-lysergic and d-isolysergic acid amides, lysergol, chanoclavine, elymoclavine, and ergonovine. d-Lysergic acid amide is the principle alkaloid. It is present in the seed in the form of a salt and is therefore soluble in water, but not in ether or alcohol, unless it is first hydrolyzed with a 10% ammonium hydroxide solution.

The powder should be placed in a small saucer of water and soaked for one hour. Use 1/2 ounce per person with a weight of 150 pounds. Three hundred seeds are equal to about 300 micrograms of LSD-25. l 4. While you are waiting for the seeds to soak, take two to three dramamine (airsickness pills). A librium or scullcap tea should also be taken at this time to eliminate anxiety. l 5. Put the water and the powdered seeds into a milkshake and drink.

Ritual Use A person who takes a major mind alterant is actually performing an act of magic. The first and most important question that should be asked is, \"Why am I performing this act?\" In other words, \"What is the goal?\" Classical Hinduism suggests four possibilities: l 1. Increased personal power, intellectual understanding, improvement of life situation, or insight into \"self.\" l 2. Duty, to help others, providing care or rehabilitation. Healing. l 3. Fun, sensuous enjoyment, and pure experience. l 4. Transcendence, liberation from the three basic illusions: space, time, and ego. Attainment of mystical union. Once a goal has been selected and defined, the next most important question should then be asked: \"What is your method of reprogramming?\" I recommend reading The Psychedelic Experience by Timothy Leary. This manual guides one through the intermediate stages between death and rebirth. It systematically lists the levels of consciousness met after normal consciousness leaves the place of routine reality. It attempts to forewarn and prepare the voyager for the range of visions to be encountered. Leary's manual is based on the Bardo Thodol. The Bardo Thodol, which first appeared in English as the Tibetan Book of the Dead in 1927, is used in Tibet as a breviary to be read or recited on the occasion of death to help the dying person concentrate on the experience he or she is about to undergo. It is a road map to the cycles of events after death that lead to either liberation or reincarnation. In highly symbolic language, the spirit is told what to expect in each of the three stages between death and rebirth. The first stage describes psychic happenings at the moment of death; the second stage describes the dream state that follows and the \"karmic\" illusions that occur; and the third step describes the beginnings of prenatal feelings, or the return of the ego. Leary's The Psychedelic Experience is the perfect book written for this form of magic. He has"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"modularized each point correctly, including the ability to literally create rebirth! With this manual, one can actually reprogram attitudes, behavior patterns, and goals in life. Everyone should experience a controlled programmed LSD trip once. It is a form of initiation.

Called a psychic sedative. Potent MAO inhibitor. l Iboga - From Tabermanthe iboga, an African plant containing ibogaine and ibogamine. Said to relieve fatigue. l Methyltrytamine (indole amphetamine) - Produces rise in serotonin in brain, as does LSD. l Myristicin - From nutmeg, produces bizarre CNS symptoms. l N, N-dimethyltryptamine - Powerful hallucinogen, five times as active as mescaline; effects appear in three to five minutes and disappear in one hour.

Gordon Wasson has presented evidence depicting mushroom worship dating to A.D. 300. Mushroom stone images have been found in Guatemala dating back to perhaps 1000 B.C. Some of these stones depict a young woman sitting under a mushroom with a metate. Although they were formerly thought to be connected with a form of phallic worship (due to their peculiar form), they are now associated with ancient mushroom rites. Mushrooms were doubtlessly consumed in rituals over much of Central America in ancient times, but the only tribe that is definitely known to have used teonanacatl (\"flesh of the gods\") is the Chichimecas. There are six tribes in Oaxaca today that consume sacred mushrooms: Mazatecs, Chimantecs, Chatinos, Zapotecs, Mixtecs, and Mijes. Other tribes using sacred mushrooms are the Nahoas of Mexico, the Tarascans of Michoacau, and the Otomis of Puebla.

Peak occurs from one to one and a half hours after ingestion. Total experience is approximately six hours. Preparation There is really no preparation other than making sure all manure or dirt is off the mushroom. They should not be stored in a plastic bag and frozen. If you wish to store them, the only correct way is to string them by the stems and hang them upside down, free to air dry. Once they have completely dried, then they can be powdered and placed in a bag that can \"breathe.\" The best way to serve the dried mushroom is to powder it and mix it with a favorite liqueur. Heat over 150ºF will destroy much of the psilocin. In other words, spaghetti dinners are nice only if the mushrooms are added to the sauce at the last moment."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Ritual Use Sex magic : The first use of sex within the rituals of western traditions of magic began with the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), an 800-year-old Masonic order in Germany. Members had studied the Hindu traditions of Tantra and found that the energy contained in those rituals was greater than in any other known technique. At the turn of the century, Aleister Crowley became their new Outer Head of the Order (O.H.O.) and rewrote those rituals for a more contemporary application. For a clear picture of this technique, it is recommended that the student first read chapter 16 of The Tree of Life by Israel Regardie, followed by pages 82-86 of Liber Aleph, The Book of Wisdom or Folly by Aleister Crowley. The \"Mass of the Holy Ghost\" is described on page 86: de Formula Tota on the complete formula. Here then is thy Schedule for all Operations of Magick. First: thou shalt discover thy True Will, as I have already taught thee, and that Bud therefore which is the Purpose of this Operation. Next, formulate this Bud-Will as a Person, seeking or constructing it, and naming it, according to thine Holy Qabalah, and its infallible Rule of Truth. Third: Purify and consecrate this Person, concentrating upon him, and against all else. This Preparation shall continue in all thy daily Life. Mark well: make ready a New Child immediately after every Birth. Fourth: make an especial and direct Invocation at thy Mass, before the Introit, formulating a visible Image of this Child, and offering the Right of Incarnation. Fifth: perform the Mass, not omitting the Ipiklesis, and let there be a Golden Wedding Ring at the Marriage of thy Lion with thine Eagle. Sixth: at the Consumption of the Eucharist accept this Child, loosing thy Consciousness in him, until he be well assimilated within thee. Now then do this continuously, for by Repetition cometh forth both Strength and Skill, and the Effect is cumulative, if thou allow no time for it to dissipate itself. I will now describe in simple terms how this formula is applied to sex magic: 1. Discover your true will. What is the purpose of the operation? Or perhaps you wish to have some event occur, etc. 2. \"Name it\" - as a person, an entity which has its own personality. It could be that wish to change a"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"habit. If that is the case, then treat this new proposed change as a new entity, a new person who is not you. This is the detail to the purpose. 3. Purify and consecrate this new person. This is the point where you and your mate generate the desire, the foreplay with each reminding the other continuously of the purpose of the operation. This is the bud-will. 4. Formulate an image of this bud-will into a child (a magical child). With entry, you both begin to redefine the child. The proper term for this is synergy: the creation of new information to add and supplement the original intent. It is the invocation. You begin to live what you create. For visualization, the Red Lion is the male essence and the White Eagle is the female menstruum. 5. Form a bond with the gold ring. This is the climax! The Red Lion becomes the White Lion and the White Eagle becomes the Red Eagle. 6. Consume the eucharist and know that no other energy is necessary. After the climax, both male and female should eat the semen and menstruum. The eucharist in alchemical terms is the Philosopher's Stone. Repetition of the thought and act brings strength and skill. Note : The thought during a sexual climax ... happens! (This is the Masonic secret.) In this ritual it should be noted that only odd numbers of mushrooms should be eaten, never even numbers. Mexican Love Feast : Each adult takes four, five, six, or thirteen pairs of mushrooms and experiences his or her own inner ecstasy while sharing feelings of brotherly love with the others. The curandero may chant or dance periodically during this event. Mexican Prophecy Ritual: Before the ceremony a chocolate beverage is usually served. Women sing, dance, and clap hands. The curandero gathers some corn, parrot feathers, cacao beans, copal resin, green tobacco, and bark paper. He has fasted since noon of the proceeding day. For five days he has abstained from sex, alcohol, meat, and salt. This will continue for another five days after the ritual (otherwise he believes that he risks going mad). At sunset the altar candles are lit. Those present are seated on the floor. The question for prophesy is decided and clarified. The mushrooms are then eaten in pairs during a period of one hour. As many as fourteen pairs can be eaten. No one is allowed to leave. Silence is maintained. The curandero rubs green tobacco on his head and stomach and on the back of his neck. He blows out the candles. At 1:00 A.M. the prophecy begins. Note of Caution : Make absolutely positive identification of the species of mushroom to be used. Also note that P. baeocystis contains other alkaloids that should not be used by any one with respiratory problems. In Mexico it is said that the mushroom is capable of driving a person mad if certain precautions are not taken.

It has a long thick and whitish root with many fibers. The stem is smooth and erect with many branches. The leaves, large and angular and 4 to 6 inches long with a coarsely toothed margin, grow singly in the forks of the branching stems. The flowers are large, about 3 inches in length, and encased in a calyx; they are long and tubular and swollen below, ending in five very sharp teeth. The top part of the flower, the corolla, is pure white and half-opened in a runnel shape with six prominent ribs extending into six sharp pointed segments at the top of the flower. History The name datura originated from early Arabian names such as datora and tatorah. Early Sanskrit writings refer to these drugs as dhurstura and unmata. The name \"Jimson weed\" comes from Jamestown, Virginia, where a colonist found datura growing near a pile of rubbish discarded by the ships at dock. In India, women known as \"mundane ladies\" (prostitutes) would use \"knockout drops\" (D. metel) for intoxicating, then robbing, their clients. It is a powerful narcotic. Old Chinese herbal medicine texts state that if equal amounts of Jimson weed and Cannabis sativa are gathered in the seventh and eighth moon, dried in the shade, pulverized, and taken in wine, the preparation ingested would produce a narcotic anesthesia so effective that operations and cauterizations could be performed with little or no pain. The Algonquians of eastern North America would make a drink containing Jimson weed, wysoccan, for young boys to take when initiated into manhood. A type of violent madness would occur for about twenty days with a total loss of memory of their former life. When the boy regained consciousness, he would start adulthood forgetting that he was ever a child. Chemistry The principal active component is scopolamine (hyoscine). Other alkaloids are atropine, hyoscyamine, mandragorine, and other tropane alkaloids. These are all parasympathetic depressants."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Scopolamine Hydrobromide (Hyoscine) + Atropine Sulfate (Tincture Of Belladonna) Primary Effects Parasympathetic depressant. Hallucinogen and hypnotic. A hypnotic produces low alphoid and spindal alpha brain activity. This does not allow deep sleep to occur although it does lower brain patterns to states where dreams occur. Preparation Do Not Ingest! The leaves are smoked (Don Juan's \"little smoke\"). Cannabis sativa may be added. The dose should be less than 2 grams per session, taken less than once per week. Ritual Use In 1658, Porta wrote in his book Natural Magick that a potion containing henbane, mandrake, stromonium, and belladonna was drunk to make a man act like a beast—probably one of the origins of lycanthropy. A traditional technique for witch's flying ointment was to take the fat of an animal or even a child and simmer it in the fresh juice of stromonium, water parsnip, aconite, Cinquefoil, and deadly nightshade. Soot was added to blacken the mixture and then the ointment was rubbed over the entire body. A broom was sometimes used to put more of the ointment up into the vagina—by this time the witch was really hallucinating and experienced \"flying on her broomstick to the sabbath.\" This is a classic"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"example of astral projection. To control the experience of astral projection, the recommended procedure is to fast the day before the experiment (abstaining from drugs also). In the afternoon secure your room from sound and other possible distractions: telephone, visitors, etc. Smoke two large joints of datura, about 1 gram each. Then lie back and allow the effects to occur. To get a better idea of the expected effects and what you might do with this experience, I recommend the book Journeys Out of the Body by Robert Monroe. Note of Caution : Datura can be detrimental to the heart because of the tropanes. A tolerance is built up to the tropanes in the parasympathetic system, thus requiring more datura to achieve the same effects. This is not true with their effects on the heart and severe damage may occur. This is why this and related tropanes should never be ingested. They are extremely toxic. Other tropane - containing herbs which may be used similarly: l 1. Belladonna (Atropa belladonna)—also known as deadly nightshade. Used originally to dilate pupils attractively, hence belladonna. l 2. Henbane (Hysocyamus niger)—also known as devils' eye. Traditional use was as a flying ointment for ritual. l 3. Mandrake (Mandragora officinarum)—also known as may-apple. Believed to be magical because its root structure resembled a man. l 4. Monkshood (Aconitum napellus)—also known as wolfs bane or aconite, was traditionally considered to be the most important of the Solanaceae group as it was used to fight the werewolf. l 5. Mint Bidis (non-tobacco cigarettes from India). The ingredients are spearmint, gigantic swallow wort, thorn apple, holy basil, marjoram, sour orange, and papaverine. Mint Bidis contains 65 milligrams scopolamine and 16 milligrams atropine per cigarette. The first four can be made into extracts with ethyl alcohol. A smoke is then prepared by dipping a cigarette or herbal into the extract and letting it air dry.
