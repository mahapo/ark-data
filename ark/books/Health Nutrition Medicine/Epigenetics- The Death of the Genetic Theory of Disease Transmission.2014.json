Bland’sundergraduate thesis advisor was Nobel Laureate (chemistry) F. Sherwood Rowland,who was credited with discovering the adverse effects of fluorocarbons on theozone layer.In 1967 Jeffrey Bland entered the University of Oregon, Department of Chemistry,as a National Science Foundation Scholarship doctoral student. Bland completedhis doctorate degree in synthetic organic chemistry in 1971.A nutritional biochemist and registered clinical laboratory director, he heldthe position of professor of biochemistry at the University of Puget Sound andheld the post of Director of Nutritional Research at the Linus Pauling Instituteof Science and Medicine.In 1978 Dr. Bland became the president of the Northwest Academy of PreventiveMedicine, which resulted in his becoming editor and author of the 1983 textbookThe Medical Applications of Clinical Nutrition. Since 1978 Bland has authoredfour books on nutrition and health for the general public and six books forhealth professionals. His 1982 book, Nutraerobics, was a Book-of-the-Month Cluboffering. Bland has also been the principle author of more than 100peer-reviewed research papers on nutritional biochemistry.In Epigenetics, Drs. Wallach, Ma, and Schrauzer have combined more than 100years of aggressive and proactive scientific pursuits in agriculture, veterinarymedicine, comparative pathology, and human medicine; bench science in tracemineral and rare earth research and biochemistry; pathology and veterinary andhuman clinical nutrition; and international conservation projects (white rhino,African elephant, etc.) to document the slow grinding and often bumpy path ofscience and medicine into the 21st century.Medical science, by its very nature, is resistant to change, even in the face ofoverwhelming facts and truth because of individuals in places and positions ofpolitical and academic power. In Epigenetics, classic documented examples ofresistance to the acceptance of clinical and nutritional truths are presented tolead to the current battlefields of nutritional truths versus the dogma ofsingle-mindedness in the fields of animal and human genetics and nutrition.I’ve known Dr. Joel Wallach, BS, DVM, ND, since the late 1970s. In fact, in 1979he took over from me the position of head of the Therapeutic and ClinicalNutrition Program at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland,Oregon. From my first meeting with Joel, I found him to be a totally engagedresearcher in the area of nutritional sciences with a strong focus on clinicalapplications. It is this dedication to clinical application that led him tocomplete a doctorate in naturopathic medicine after successfully completing hisdoctorate in veterinary medicine, and followed this with a postdoctoralfellowship in comparative pathology.Cystic fibrosis (CF) is widely “known” as the second most common life-shorteninginherited disorder of children in the United States after sickle cell anemia. In1978, as a researcher at Emory University’s Yerkes Regional Primate ResearchCenter in Atlanta, Georgia, Dr. Wallach was the first to observe, document, andreceive conformation of pancreatic, liver, and lung lesions in inadequately-fedrhesus monkeys identical to those found in human cystic fibrosis patients. Thissuggested that, at the very least, some forms of CF could be the result of aselenium deficiency, and that some forms of CF might be preventable andreversible.The stunning discovery that he could create a condition in monkeys that was verysimilar, if not identical, to the clinical disease and pathology found in thehuman disease cystic fibrosis by removing the trace element selenium from themonkeys’ diets was considered revolutionary. Before this observation, it wasthought that cystic fibrosis was strictly a genetically-transmitted disease andhad no known environmental or dietary associations. Dr. Wallach’s observationschallenged this dogma.Old medical concepts and dogmas that are entrenched over periods of decades,centuries, and millennia change only with great difficulty, and so it was in1977 that this occurred with the acceptance of Dr. Wallach’s originaldiscoveries surrounding a nutritional contribution to the genesis of humancystic fibrosis. In 2011 Dr. Wallach (a 1991 Nobel Prize nominee) received theKlaus Schwarz Commemorative Medal, awarded by the International Association ofBioinorganic Scientists for his meritorious discovery of the important role ofthe trace element selenium in maintaining human (embryonic and postnatal)pancreatic, skeletal muscle, cardiac, and hepatic physiology and function.In the awards committee’s announcement of Wallach’s 2011 award they stated,“From a historical perspective, Wallach is to be regarded as one of the firstpractitioners, if not founders of, (the science of) epigenetics, the newresearch discipline that investigates heritable alterations in gene expressioncaused by mechanisms other than changes in DNA sequence. With the award of theKlaus Schwarz Medal, Wallach is belatedly honored for a serendipitous discoverythat will be of benefit to many.” I have recognized the passion and commitmentthat Joel has brought to this focus over the more than thirty years that I haveknown him.This discovery launched Dr. Wallach forward in his lifelong pursuit of theunderstanding of the role that other nutrients have on modulating geneticexpressions through epigenetic influences. His work and advocacy havecontributed to the increasing understanding of the role of trace elements andthe effects they have on influencing intermediary metabolism as cofactors, andthe pathology and clinical diseases that occur when they are deficient in animaland human diets.It is a significant honor and acknowledgment of Dr. Wallach’s contributions tothe field of nutrition and epigenetics that he received the Klaus Schwarz Awardfor 2011. Dr. Schwarz, who was born in 1914 and died in 1978, was aninvestigator at the University of California, Los Angeles, was a leading tracemetal/trace element researcher, and was known for his discovery of thenutritional essentiality of the trace mineral selenium. Dr. Schwarz would havebeen very pleased to have seen Dr. Wallach receive a medal in his name for thepioneering work done on the relationship between selenium deficiency and thepathophysiology and genesis of cystic fibrosis.The combined efforts of Drs. Wallach, Ma, and Schrauzer in this book thatdocuments the nutritional implications of epigenetics, represents the nextchapter in the understanding of how nutrients influence health and disease inways that were not understood only a few years ago.Dr. Gerhard Schrauzer is an iconic and legendary researcher and educator in thefields of trace element and rare earth biochemistry and physiology in bothhumans and numerous laboratory animal species, known particularly for selenium,lithium, and the entire family of light and heavy rare earths. He has had morethan 300 peer-reviewed and refereed scientific papers published inwidely-respected scientific journals. Dr. Schrauser has been listed twice as oneof the most frequently-quoted scientists in America. He held the post ofProfessor and Head of the Department of Chemistry at the University ofCalifornia, San Diego, and is currently active as an international lecturer as aProfessor Emeritus at UCSD.Dr. Ma Lan, who taught and carried on research at the Harvard School of Medicinein Boston, the Texas Medical Center, at the University of Texas in Houston, theUniversity of Wisconsin and the University of California, San Diego, is highlyregarded internationally as a widely published scientist in the fields ofmicrosurgery, biochemistry, pathology, and nutrition.Jeffrey Bland, PhD, FACN, FACB, CNSPresident, Personalized Lifestyle Medicine Institute"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe efforts of many have provided the data and the energy necessary for theconception, development, and birth of this book, Epigenetics.Many people (Steve Wallach, Michelle Wallach, Char Murphy, Blake Graham, ToddSmith, Marvin Ropp, Judy Bell, Michael Zwerling, Doug Wynfrey, Dr. PeterGlidden, ND, Brandy Brogdon, the Steele brothers: Sammy, Johny, Daniel, Josh,and “Jivers;” Carl Casale, Judy Bell, and Norm Burt) contributed tirelessly byproviding a continual stream of information from hundreds of media sources,including newspapers, magazines, the Internet, and well-recognized scientificjournals.Technical assistance was expertly provided by John Taylor, Richard Renton,Brandy Brogdon, and Ted Anderson.The employees of my publisher, SelectBooks, Inc., contributed their professionaleditorial, book production, and marketing skills to make this book possible.The attractive jacket design was created by Brian Davis."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHORSJoel Wallach, BS, DVM, NDDr. Wallach has been involved with biomedical research for more than fiftyyears. He received his bachelor of science degree in agriculture in 1962 fromthe University of Missouri with a major in animal husbandry (nutrition) and aminor in field crops and soil physiology. In 1964 Dr. Wallach received a DVM, adoctorate in veterinary medicine, from the University of Missouri. He was apathologist and instructor for the Iowa State Diagnostic Laboratory andInstructor (Pathology) for the Department of Pathology, Iowa State University(Department of Veterinary Pathology) in 1964/65, and then received apost-doctoral fellowship from the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems(comparative pathology and comparative medicine) at Washington University, St.Louis Zoological Garden and Shaws Botanical Gardens in St. Louis, in 1967. Hecontinued his veterinary and research work at the Yerkes Primate Research Centerat Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1977–1978.He then studied naturopathic medicine, receiving an ND (a doctorate to practicemedicine as a naturopathic physician) from the National College of NaturopathicMedicine in Portland, Oregon, in 1982, and attained the rank of Lt. Colonel inthe US Air Force/Air National Guard and Air Force Reserves (MOS: nuclear,biological, and chemical warfare; NBC: veterinary and human medicine).Dr. Wallach’s research has resulted in the publication of more than 75peer-reviewed and refereed articles in veterinary journals, human medical andbiochemistry journals, and pathology journals. He has contributed chapters toeight multi-author textbooks and his signature primary authorship of a 1,200page text/reference (NIH sponsored research) on the subject of comparativemedicine and pathology (The Diseases of Exotic Animals: W. B. SaundersPublishing Co., 1983.) This text is featured by the Smithsonian Institute as a“National Treasure.”Dr. Wallach has held teaching, pathology service, and research appointments atthe graduate level in human and animal anatomy, nutrition, and pathology at theUniversity of Missouri, Iowa State University, Yerkes Regional Primate ResearchCenter (Emory University, Atlanta, GA), the University of Tennessee, theNational College of Naturopathic Medicine, Portland, Oregon and Harbin MedicalUniversity (Peoples Republic of China).Dr. Wallach was Project Veterinarian and Capture Officer for the Natal Parks andGame Service (Umfolozi and Hluhlue Game Parks) for Operation Rhino(Rescue/Conservation project for the white rhino), Republic of South Africa andOperation Elephant (conservation project for the African elephant) for WankieGame Reserve, Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe).Dr. Wallach’s research in comparative medicine and pathology is based on morethan 17,500 autopsy cases on 454 species of animals from zoos and African GameParks (Natal Fish & Game Department, Natal, Republic of South Africa) and morethan 4,700 humans (including 1,700 children under ten years old) through theUniversity of Missouri, Iowa State University, the Center for the Biology ofNatural Systems, Washington University (St. Louis), the St. Louis ZoologicalGardens; the Chicago Zoological Gardens (Brookfield, IL), the Lincoln Park Zoo(Chicago, IL), the Shedd Aquarium (Chicago, IL), Yerkes Regional PrimateResearch Center, Emory University, (Atlanta, GA), the University of Tennessee(Memphis, TN), The Memphis Zoo (Memphis, TN), the Jacksonville, Zoo(Jacksonville, FL), the Detroit Zoo (Detroit, MI), the National Zoo (Washington,D.C.), The New York Zoological Gardens (Bronx, NY), the Denver Zoo (Denver, CO),the National College of Naturopathic Medicine (Portland, OR) and the HarbinMedical University (Harbin, Hei Long Jiang, People’s Republic of China).Dr. Wallach was a member of NIH site visit teams for four years and was a memberof the 1968 NSF ad hoc committee that authored the 1968 Animal Welfare Act (forthe humane housing and care of laboratory and captive exotic species),Consulting Professor of Medicine (Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Hei LongJiang, People’s Republic of China). Dr. Wallach was the founder and editor ofthe Journal of Zoo Animal Medicine and an associate editor of Quantum Medicine,the Journal of the Association of Eclectic Physicians, and the editor of thenational alternative-health magazine, Health Consciousness.Dr. Wallach, along with Clinton Miller (lobbyist for the National HealthFederation and deceased July 2013 at age 92), was one of the coauthors andengineers of the twenty-five year battle to create and secure passage throughthe U.S. Congress of the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act (DSHEA1995)to ensure that nutritional supplements were legally categorized as food ratherthan pharmaceuticals. Day and night, Wallach and Miller would hand out petitionsto the audiences where they attended thousands of health lectures throughoutAmerica, and they then gathered up the signed petitions and sent them toCongressional Committee members and their personal U.S. Representatives andSenators.Dr. Wallach has received numerous awards for his contributions in advancing ourknowledge in the areas of animal and human health, including the 1988 WoosterBeach Gold Medal Award for a significant breakthrough in the basic understandingof the cause and pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (from Association ofEclectic Physicians). He was nominated for the 1991 Nobel Prize in Medicine forhis work with the trace mineral selenium and its relationship (deficiency) tothe congenital and neonatal genesis of cystic fibrosis (Association of EclecticPhysicians). Dr. Wallach received the 2011 Klaus Schwarz Commemorative Medal(Biological Trace Element Research Institute) for his 1977 discovery of theanimal model for cystic fibrosis in primates and elucidating the etiology andpathogenesis of CF in humans; the awards committee also noted that, “From aHistorical perspective, Wallach is to be regarded as one of the firstpractitioners, if not founders, of epigenetics, the new research discipline thatinvestigates heritable alterations in gene expression caused by mechanisms otherthan changes in DNA sequence. With the award of the Klaus Schwarz Medal, Wallachis belatedly honored for a serendipitous discovery that will be of benefit tomany.”Dr. Wallach has been the plaintiff and/or co-plaintiff in eight lawsuits andclaims requests lodged against the FDA in federal courts (Federal DistrictCourts, Federal Appellate Courts, and up to the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court)to ensure that proper information regarding supplementation with selenium,omega-3 essential fatty acids, folic acid, and antioxidants that could preventand reverse human diseases was available to all Americans.Since 1989 Dr. Wallach has given 300 free health lectures each year throughoutthe world and has been the host of two live interactive and syndicated AM talkradio shows (Dead Doctors Don’t Lie and Let’s Play Doctor) two hours per day,five days each week, for eighteen years, and as of 2011 is listened to on asmany as 1,342 Genesis Communication Network (GCN) hardwire and Internetstations.Dr. Wallach, along with coauthor Dr. Ma Lan, has written twelve popular booksdesigned to educate the general public on how to prevent and reverse disablingand deadly diseases, generally thought to be genetically transmitted by medicalscience, with simple dietary changes and evidence-based nutritional supplementprograms.Ma Lan, MD, MS, TCMDr. Ma Lan was educated in the Peoples Republic of China.

To get rid ofthinking that one knows; for it is impossible to get a man to begin to learnthat which he thinks he knows.—PlatoPlato (427–347 BC): Philosopher and mentor of Aristotle and friend of Socrates.Through his works, Plato was responsible for preserving Socrates’ memory andteachings. Plato’s dialogues are composed as conversations between friends andcolleagues in an attempt by the author to “lighten up” the heavy philosophicalquestions examined. His theory of forms, the theory that there exists a completecosmos of ideas, or forms, on which our material universe is based, influencedlater generations of philosophers. Plato wrote on various ethical, political,and philosophical topics. Among his extensive works are the “Socratic” dialoguesEuthyphro, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo, which narrate Socrates’ trial andexecution; The Republic, Laws, and Symposium, as well as letters to colleagues.Ignorance and pettiness ... belongs to small-mindedness to be able to beareither honor or dishonor, either good fortune or bad, but to be filled withconceit when honored and puffed up by trifling good fortune, and to be unable tobear even the smallest dishonor and to deem any chance failure a greatmisfortune, and to be distressed and annoyed at everything. Moreover thesmall-minded man is the sort of person to call all slights an insult anddishonor, even those that are due to ignorance or forgetfulness.Small-mindedness is accompanied by pettiness, querulousness, pessimism andself-abasement.—AristotleVirtues and VicesAristotle (384–322 BC): Philosopher: one of the greatest philosophers andscientists of all time. He was born in Stagyra, in northern Greece, and at theage of seventeen joined Plato’s Academy in Athens. Plato’s sobriquet for hisstudent was “the mind of the Academy.” After Plato’s death Aristotle leftAthens. He was hired by Philip II to tutor his son Alexander (the Great). AfterPhilip’s death, Aristotle moved back to Athens, where he founded the Lyceum, aphilosophic academy complete with a gymnasium and a library. He wrote on nearlyevery topic and every science. Among his surviving works are Physics,Metaphysics, Eudemian Ethics, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, Magna Moralia,Rhetoric, and Poetics.Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex ... It takes atouch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.—Albert EinsteinAutobiographical NotesThroughout time, humans have toppled “age old” beliefs and truths and replacedthem with new beliefs and truths as new information or new interpretations oflong known facts and observations are brought to bear on a previously unansweredquestion or wrong assumption (such as, the earth is flat!, the sun revolvesaround the earth, life is produced by “spontaneous generation,” or a man’s heartwill explode if he travels faster than forty miles per hour).These dramatic changes in thinking and shifts in belief were not quickly andeasily accepted by the defenders of the prevailing thought. Careers werederailed and people were jailed and tortured, sometimes suffering unspeakablepunishments; they were killed by burning at the stake, hanging, beheading,impaling, and were drawn and quartered in the name of defending the old “truth.”One of the purposes of this book is to reveal how the understanding of thecauses and reasons for human and animal disease and illnesses and theirtreatment concepts have changed over the millennium as critical observations,new tools, and technologies have appeared to allow the creation of a new truth—afact is a fact, but truth changes as greater numbers of facts appear. Previouslyisolated and seemingly meaningless dots become connected and the correct pathultimately becomes clear and unimpeachable even to the most vociferous andvicious defenders of the old “truth”—if they are honest.Historically, proponents of a universally believed “scientific health truth”will eventually overreach the facts in their zeal to solve all problems withtheir new-found “expertise.” The result is a ruthless suppression anddestruction of useful facts of more complete contradictory truths frommessengers with an epiphany who dare to offer a correction. It has been saidthat “science advances one funeral at a time,” because as defenders of the falseor incomplete truth die, this false truth will eventually give way to thecomplete and ultimate truth.Starting in 1962 Dr. Joel Wallach, as a veterinary student and already anaccomplished and published comparative pathologist, realized that many diseases,long thought by the scientific and medical communities to be geneticallytransmitted, were in fact caused by a congenital, neonatal, or acquirednutritional deficiency later in life as a child, teen, or adult.Through fifty-one years of performing anatomical and comparative pathologystudies; blood and tissue chemistry; histopathology with special stains; andelectron microscopy with a special emphasis on familial histories, clinicalrecords, and dietary histories; Wallach deduced and then proved that thediseases held up as the “classic examples of Mendelian genetically-transmitteddiseases” and many diseases for which the etiology was classified as“autoimmune” were in fact diseases caused by specific nutritional deficienciescombined with inflammation, including the following:Alzheimer’s diseaseCeliac diseaseCerebral palsyCleft palate, cleft lipCrohn’s diseaseCystic fibrosisDementia (vascular, Korsakoff’s syndrome, Wernike-Korsakoff’s)Diabetes (type 2)DiverticulitisDown syndromeGay behaviorHeart disease (cardio myopathy, congestive heart failure, etc.)High blood pressureHuntington’s diseaseIntersex babiesIrritable bowel syndromeInflammatory bowel diseaseInsanityKawasaki diseaseLupusMacular degenerationMarfan’s diseaseMetabolic errorsMuscular dystrophyMultiple sclerosisObesityParkinson’s diseaseRetardationSickle-cell anemiaUlcerative colitisVascular disease (e.g., coronary artery disease, vascular dementia, aneurysms,varicose veins, “kidney failure,” etc.)The fact that the falsely branded “genetic diseases” frequently occurred ingenerations of families contributed to the false belief that they were“genetically transmitted.”The familial appearance of certain diseases have now been explained by thematernal transmission of gluten intolerance to offspring by gluten passingthrough cord blood and or breast milk. The intestinal changes (contactenteritis) produced by chronic gluten exposure significantly reduces theindividual’s absorption efficiency, and if by chance is combined with local andregional mineral soil deficiencies and dietary preferences that includeinadequate minerals, this will produce specific diseases through generations.The purpose of Epigenetics is to track the evolution of human thought andbeliefs as they relate to science and health. The path from beliefs in diseasecaused by evil spirits to beliefs in alchemy, witchcraft, sorcerers, physicians,the germ theory, genetics, the elucidation of the double helix, the mapping ofthe genome, and finally to belief in epigenetics has taken thousands of years.And the unnecessary loss of millions of lives and disruptions of millions offamilies before finally connecting all of the dots—for instance, the advent ofelectricity, with the resultant disappearance of the traditional source ofessential dietary minerals (plant minerals–aka–wood ashes) and the appearance ofhealth insurance that pays doctors to treat the patient rather than curethem—becomes the perfect storm.Ultimately, we are what’s in (or isn’t in) the food we eat and what we absorb.Therefore, it matters not whether one follows the concepts of the Beverly HillsDiet, the South Beach Diet, Dr. Atkin’s Diet, the Fit for Life Diet, theMediterranean Diet, Dr. Berger’s Immune Power Diet, The Pritkin Diet, theMacrobiotic Diet, Pearson’s and Shaw’s Life Extension Diet, The 120 Year Diet,or become a vegan or a carnivore and eat blubber like an Eskimo or eat dozens ofburgers each day from Wimpy (the original “junk food junky” from Popeyecartoons).If you don’t supplement daily with optimal amounts of each of the 90 essentialnutrients (according to your body weight) you’re throwing away from 50 percentto 75% of your life as sure as if you jumped in front of a speeding commutertrain for the purpose of relieving a headache.In contrast to the methodical, science-based approach to veterinary formulationof animal rations for disease prevention, maximum fertility, longevity andproduction (by work efficiency of feed conversion for maximum production ofeggs, milk, and meat), humans have unfortunately relied too heavily on “theWisdom of the Body” theory, and as a result have recommended consuming the “fourfood groups,” the “seven food pyramid,” and “a variety of foods” as “the way” to“ensure” a healthy diet.The “wisdom of the body” theory was first proposed by Dr. Clara Davis, apediatrician, in 1928 when she published the results of a “feeding experiment”in newly weaned seven- to nine-month-old human babies. In the study the babieswere offered a great variety of simple natural foods, and they chose thehealthier combinations of food without prompting. Davis was sure that thisexperiment proved that “our bodies know best from the beginning.”Dr. Curt P. Richter, a highly respected psychologist, gave Davis’ work his sealof approval in the 1940s, after which “the wisdom of the body’ theory rapidlyfound its way into the annals of human nutrition texts, medical curriculum,medical belief, and finally medical dogma.Richter published one of his own cases in 1940 in which a young boy demonstrateda “morbid craving for salt.” The child had begun licking salt off of sodacrackers at the age one year and he then ate salt from the shaker at 18 monthsold. At age three-and-a-half years, the boy was hospitalized to restrict hissalt intake. Forty-eight hours after being denied salt the boy died (anothergreat victory for psychology). His autopsy revealed that he had had Addison’sDisease (adrenal cortical insufficiency). The boy’s salt cravings (pica) werecorrect and had kept the boy alive, but when the hospital restricted the boy’sintake of salt he died.Pregnancy associated cravings (pica) support the “wisdom of the body”theory—that the increased demand for minerals by the developing embryo/fetusfurther deprive minerals from an already mineral-deficient mother-to-be withlimited mineral reserves, thus accentuating her cravings. In fact, salt and fatcravings typically increase with advancing pregnancy. Pregnant women do requirea net increase in salt, minerals, and protein consumption to keep water fromleaving the blood vessels (osmotic gradients) and seeping into the surroundingbody tissue (causing what is called edema or “swelling,”); therefore, a cravingfor salty food such as pickles, chips, crackers makes sense. Pregnant women willalso crave fat (such as ice cream, chocolate, and fatty meats) and sweets(candy, sugar, soft drinks, pastry, etc.) in their first trimester of pregnancy.These pica type of cravings represent a misinterpreted craving for minerals.Chocolate appears to be the number one sweet craving in premenopausal women(39%) as opposed to only 14% in the male population at the same age as thewomen. Women as a group tend to be more depleted of minerals than men because oftheir additional mineral losses as a result of their cyclic menstrual periods,pregnancies and lactation.But in general, human diets are “formulated” by cultural, ethnic, and religioustradition which was originally dictated by the length of the local growingseasons, altitude of the fields, the average daily ambient temperature duringthe growing season, soil types, average rainfall, and so forth. As a result ofthe environmental, social, ethnic, and religious limits, human nutrition isbogged down with catch phrases based on little understanding about nutrition,such as “just follow the Mediterranean diet” combined with other personaldietary restrictions.All human societies have integrated strict dietary rules into their religionsand religious practices and devised taboos against certain food plants oranimals that in the past were either venerated (totemism) or feared(witchcraft), as these were incorporated into fasts and detailed rituals foranimal and human sacrifices prior to feasts. There have always been societal orreligious laws against overindulgence of certain stimulant drinks like alcohol,coffee, and tea, and rules against gluttony (“The seven deadly sins”).Today, American orthodox medical “health experts” are hopelessly out of touchwith reality. They pontificate in the news media about how you can geteverything you need nutritionally from your diet, they warn that “takingvitamins and minerals just gives you expensive urine,” that they themselves relyon their food choices, and they brag that they do not take supplements. As aresult, America is not calorie deficient, but we are malnourished because of alack of the 90 essential macro-and micro-nutrients.The April 16, 2012 issue of the journal Food Chemistry, reported that “America’swell thought of baby and infant formulas and packaged diets contain less than20% of the required minerals and vitamins for human infants!”America’s great interest in food, fast food, fad foods, snack foods, deserts,caffeine, alcohol, drugs, and tobacco is a symptom and a direct result ofmineral deficiencies. These mineral deficiencies are the direct cause of Americabeing the most obese nation in the world—we’re number one!If you look to the American medical system and/or your allopathic physician forhelp with your personal nutrition program (diet), you are putting yourself ingrave danger. Their interests and expertise go only so far as having the falsebelief in the role of genetics in health, their promotion of “the four foodgroup diet,” and recommendations of cholesterol testing and management. And eventhis limited interest disappears with a martini at their high-priced countryclub.“The proof is in the pudding,” and therefore it is reasonable to examine howwell orthodox doctors perform when it comes to avoiding nutritional-deficiencydiseases and the resultant early death from preventable diseases. If doctors aredoing all of the correct dietary and health practices they should all live to bebeyond 120 years of age.The first task in grading the health and longevity success of orthodox doctorsis to look at their average age at death when compared to the general U.S.population (75.5 years of age). An examination of the monthly obituaries listedin the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in January of 1993showed an astounding average life span for medical doctors of 58 years of age(theoretically one could gain 20 years of average life span by not going tomedical school) when all causes are examined. A second look in 1999 by theorthodox medical system themselves, showed that the average life span of medicaldoctors was only 56 years of age.Another purpose of Epigenetics is to convince readers to understand the purposeof naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) primarily differ from theMD community because of their goal of strict adherence to the philosophy:“First, do no harm.”While American medical doctors claim to believe in this same philosophyaccording to their Hippocratic Oath, many patients are harmed by their oftenunnecessary surgical practices and dangerous prescriptions for illness.According to a CDC report of Feb. 5, 2007, that was also reported in the Journalof the American Medical Association, American MDs kill, injure, and infect 15million patients each year in hospitals and clinics in the United States alone.There are numerous lawsuits and financial settlements; however few go to jail.In the meantime, there are no laws to direct or insist that MDs cure a patientwhen there is a cure available, and there is little financial reward to a doctorto administer a two-week cure versus a 25-year treatment.Because the pharmacy industry pays doctors to use high-priced, risky drugs thathave not been adequately tested for their rates of success or adverse sideeffects, in September, 2012 the Institute of Medicine reported that American MDsdefraud the American people of about $750 billion each year with unnecessarytreatments and prescriptions!In contrast to this, patients under the care of naturopathic physicians arefirst offered choices of therapies that have a very low risk of injuring people,and their doctors perform surgery and prescribe medicines only when absolutelynecessary.MDs are the people who deep-sixed the research findings behind the storiesWallach tells in Epigenetics of his research for a cure for cystic fibrosis andfor muscular dystrophy because of their egos, the threat to their medicalcareers, and their desire to maintain the “genetic cause” of disease theories tokeep their labs funded.The medical system has failed the American people, the world population, andthemselves. Through misinformation and misguided advice it has created a“perfect storm” that has resulted in a string of physician-caused diseases thatcontribute to the mind-boggling complexity of health care."},{"pageContent":"PART1The Seeds and Evolution of Medical Thinking"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEEVIL SPIRITSThe fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious.—Albert EinsteinThe World As I See ItJoyous feasts alternate with solemn sacrifices and everything is accomplished bymagical operations that free the soul from fear and stimulate man’s imagination.It was for magical purposes (to fend off and cure diseases) that images werecarved, poems were written, music played and public monuments erected.—Kurt SeligmannThe History of Magic and the OccultWe all know that as we are beneficent toward nature, it becomes beneficenttoward us.—XenophonXenophon (428–354 BC): Historian. An associate of Socrates, Xenophon fought inCyrus’s army against Cyrus’s older brother, Artaxerxes, in the Battle of Cunaxain 401 BC. Cyrus was defeated and killed. Xenophon’s adventures in reachingGreece from the midst of Asia after the defeat are documented in his March ofthe Ten Thousand. He also wrote a history of Greece entitled Hellenica, thememoirs of Socrates, Memorabilia, as well as a dialogue on estate management,entitled Oeconomicus.From the beginning of time, humans feared unseen evil spirits and thecondemnation and evil spells of all-powerful supernatural beings. To protecthimself, man developed magic, spells, and rites to prevent disease andsuffering, prevent catastrophic events of nature, and to repel evil and sinisterbeings.As Kurt Seligmann describes in The History of Magic and the Occult, it seemed tothe first humans that evil spirits that cause pain, disease, and death could befound behind every rock and tree and lurking in every blade of grass:Spirits lurked everywhere. Larvae and lemurs lived beneath the earth; vampiresescaped from the dead to attack the living; Namtar (pestilence) and Idpa (fever)plagued the cities. Night was ruled by the demons of evil, of the desert, of theabyss, of the sea, of the mountains, of the swamp, of the south wind. There werethe succubi and the incubi, carriers of obscene nightmares; the snare-settingMaskim; the evil Utoq, dweller of the desert; the bull demon Telal; and Alal thedestroyer.Geologists (Greek for “talkers about the earth”) believe that the earth is4,500,000,000 years old. There have been four Ice Ages, when glaciers coveredlarge portions of the earth’s Northern Hemisphere, and four global warmings. Thelast global warming and glacial retreat was 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.A December 5th 2013 article in the Wall Street Journal reported that geneticistsfrom the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany extractedthe oldest known human DNA, dating back to more than 300,000 years ago, from afossil femur obtained from a cave shaft located in northern Spain. The Sima delos Huesos (the pit of bones) contained the skeletal remains of 28 ancienthumans from a species never before reported.Physically, these earliest humans looked like Neanderthals. However, a geneticanalysis reported in the journal Nature revealed that their maternal DNAextracted from bone marrow mitochondria was different from that of bothNeanderthals and more modern humans. Their DNA was more closely related to arelatively unknown human species—the Denisovans.Anthropologists theorized that the people in the Sima cave could have been adistinct human species that had interbred with the Denisovans; they may havebeen directly related to the ancestors of the Denisovans or the relatives ofboth Denisovans and Neanderthals, or even related to a species of humans thathad occupied parts of Europe and Asia, including Homo heidelbergensis.There is evidence that the first communication of information by humans,including primitive observations of disease, astronomy, and math, are datedbefore 35,000 BC.Twenty-five thousand years ago, Cro-Magnon artists stenciled impressions oftheir hands on the walls of more than twenty caves in northern Spain, Italy, andsouthwestern France.The Gargas Cave in the French Pyrenees has the most handprints from more than150 different infants, teenagers, and adults, and most are left hands. Createdduring the late Ice Age, the majority of the outlines were created with earthpigments blown through a reed or tanned skin tube, which may explain why theleft hand was the predominant subject.Many of the stenciled hands are mutilated by the removal of several joints of atleast two fingers. Creating plaster casts of the holes found in the mud wallsand ceiling of the Gargas Cave revealed that the holes had been created byfingers that terminated bluntly in scar-tissue bulges. This evidence shows thatthe fingers had been deliberately “truncated,” perhaps for a medical orreligious ritual to bring good luck, fend-off disease, or to satisfy the huntinggods. Another theory is that the amputations were intended to represent theband’s animal totem or health guardians.“We have invented nothing!” Pablo Picasso exclaimed as he emerged from France’sfamed Lascaux Cave. Inside the cave, Picasso had examined some of the mostincredible art in the world—it is dated back to 17,000 years ago! In 1868 thefirst of such prehistoric art was discovered in Altamira, Spain, and unbelievingvisitors to the cave asserted that the paintings were no more than twenty yearsold, and dismissed them as “the expressions of a mediocre student of the modernschool.”Later discoveries of additional cave paintings in Spain and France caused thedisbelievers to have a reversal of opinion: former critics began swooning overthe ancient artists’ incredible talent. Only one of these new discoveries wouldrival the caves of Altamira for sheer brilliance of talent—the Lascaux Cave,which was discovered accidently by a boy who was looking for his lost dog.The Lascaux Cave houses 600 paintings, approximately 1,500 individual engravingson stone, and many patterns of dots and geometric designs that tantalize theviewer. The ceilings and walls are covered with herds of animals, includingaurochs (early forms of wild cattle), bison, reindeer, horses, and other speciesthat are shown running, fleeing, galloping, and charging at the viewer.Working in the flickering light of torches and fat-burning lamps and employing astick, plant fibers, or finger-tip, the ancient painters of Lascaux firstoutlined and then colored-in their animal art. After thousands of years, theLascaux paintings have continued to maintain their original brilliance.Modern chemical analysis of the paints showed that the artists had developed andrefined a difficult skill to create pigments for optimal clarity, stability, andbrilliance. They powdered, ground, and mixed their materials, combining iron andmanganese oxides with early mortars to create red, black, and yellow pigments;then they mixed the powders with water before they tinted the wall paintings. Insome cases they mixed in additional binding agents, including blood, urine, fat,“fish glue,” egg white, and a multitude of plant juices. To enhance certaincolors or to create burnt tones, they toasted the pigments with burning coals.The process was the forerunner of what is today considered industrial chemistry.The ancient artists of the Lascaux Cave dealt with the concepts of depth andthree-dimension by employing natural rock outcroppings and overlapping drawingsof animals of different sizes to provide the artistic depth. Many of their earlytechniques would not be recreated by artists for thousands of years.Cave and rock art and drawings are found all over the world; it is a prehistoricform of communication that passes on messages. The earliest cave drawings aredated in the Upper Paleolithic period of about 30,000 to 10,000 BC. Many of thecave drawings were connected to ritual magic that asked for fertility, health,plenty, and success at hunting.An element of a request for fertility is found in some of the drawings. Thedrawings suggest certain depictions of humans and food animals, such as bisonand wild cattle, that were without wounds or piercings by spears or arrows, wereintended to ask the good spirits to increase the numbers of food animals andhumans.The “taming” of fire by man brought the “mastery” of metals that eventually ledto human progress and civilization. Iron was the primary key of this transition,which raised the quality of human life from a brutish animal-like huntergatherer existence to civilization. This early history of the ferrous metal wasenough to give iron a special supernatural quality. Additionally, the firstpurified iron was extracted from meteors that fell from the heavens.The ancient Egyptians referred to iron as “the metal from the sky,” and theAztecs referred to iron as “the gift of heaven.” The earliest known iron toolsand weapons date back past the third millennium BC. Historically, in 150 BC,amulets of meteoric iron were placed in the tomb of Tutankhamen to give himhealth in the afterlife and protect him from evil spirits.In 1848 the skull of an early man was discovered in a cave in Gibraltar. By thetime it arrived in England in 1856, a full skeleton of the same type of beingalso arrived. It had been uncovered in a cave in the Neander Valley nearDusseldorf, Germany—thus explaining the name “Neanderthal.”Since the original discoveries of Neanderthals, the remains of Neanderthalershave been uncovered in Spain, France, Belgium, Russia, Czechoslovakia,Yugoslavia, and Italy. The Neanderthals are dated back to 75,000 years ago byanthropologists (the Greek word for “talkers about what man is made of”).In 1931 and 1932 a team of American and English researchers discovered twoadjoining caves on Mount Carmel in what was then Palestine (now Israel) in whichthey found the remains of twelve humans and numerous stone tools.The bones from one cave called Mugharet es Skhul (the Cave of the Young Goats)were a mixture of modern men and Neanderthals. Bones from the adjacent cave wereone hundred per cent Neanderthal. It was determined that the modern men and theNeanderthals had cohabited for some time, had “married” and born children, whothen bore more children.Geneticists (Greek for “birth followers”) agree that if this scenario iscorrect, then these two “peoples” had to be genetically the same species of man.It would have been genetically impossible for them to be on separateevolutionary paths and successfully produce babies through cross-breeding.The academic community of anthropologists now believes that there was only onespecies of man as far back as 150,000 years ago, and he was found over Europe,Asia, the South Pacific, and Africa.There are distinct physical differences between the peoples of Scandinavia,Russia, the Mideast, Africa, and Latin America. Many of these uniquecharacteristics will immediately identify where in the world an individual’sfamily had originated from.Skulls were discovered in a cave in Fontechevade, France, that for all practicalpurposes looked like modern Frenchmen. However, with them were the skeletons oftortoises and rhinoceroses that were from the warming period between the thirdand fourth Ice Ages.As the last Ice Age drew near its end, it is thought that several differentpeoples immigrated into the Neanderthal territory, including the Cro-Magnon.Five Cro-Magnon skeletons were discovered in the Cro-Magnon cave in southcentral France. They were examples of one of the two types of peoples appearingeverywhere some 15,000 years ago, and they looked similar to the modern daySwedes and Norwegians.The town of Abbeville, France, is found where the River Somme meets the EnglishChannel. In 1830 Jacques Boucher de Crevecoeur de Perthes held the post ofcustoms officer in Abbeville. He had plenty of spare time between the comingsand goings of ships, so he was able to read about geology and to write stories,plays, and books related to government regulations.During an afternoon stroll along the banks of the Somme River, de Perthes cameacross workmen, and as he stopped to observe them he noticed an unusual stonenestled in the gravel of the river bank. He had discovered an ancient axe, roundon one end and a flaked blade point at the other end. He came back to the riverbank in his spare time and found the bones of ancient elephants and rhinoceroseswhere he had previously found the axe.It was sixteen years later that de Perthes finished his book showing that therehad been tool-making men on Earth fifty to a hundred thousand years earlier, butit took an additional fifteen years for the academic community to accept hisfindings!In the Middle East where the country of Iraq is located, flowed two rivers, theTigris and the Euphrates, that brought water and mineral-rich silt to a greenbelt east of Eden known as the “Fertile Crescent”—the Garden of Eden! This greenbelt curled toward the west toward the Syrian beaches of the Mediterranean Seaand southward to where the Biblical city of Jericho would be built. This FertileCrescent is where civilization and agriculture as we know it came to be andflourished some 10,000 years ago.On the hills along the two rivers wild wheat and barley grew, and wild animalsincluding goats, sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, and dogs were found in the lowermeadows. The people who moved into the Fertile Crescent became farmers andherdsmen instead of hunter-gatherers, and by 9,000 BC they were tending theirherds and flocks and domesticating, planting, and harvesting wheat and barley.It is believed that written history in words is about 5,000 years old and thathumans as we know them have been around for about 500,000 years; therefore,approximately ninety nine percent of the period of time that humans have been onearth is “prehistoric!”THE BEGINNNGS OF ASTROLOGY AND MEDICINEEarly prehistoric people’s waking hours and dreams were filled with evil spiritsand devils that ransomed health and safety for high-value sacrifices andconstant prayer. Prehistoric peoples suffered unimaginable events that theyperceived were beyond their control, including infertility and birth defects(monsters) of every description. Down Syndrome, cerebral palsy, cleft lip andpalate, missing limbs, extra limbs, cycloptic eye, spina bifida, hernias, heartdefects, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, conjoined twins, dwarfs, andgiants, as well as inborn errors of metabolism causing PKU and congenital eventsthat produced unexplainable confusion like homosexuality, plagued them. Theysuffered from starvation, epidemics, and plagues and from the cannibals that atethem and their children, as well as from ecological and natural disasters thatseemed to appear in an endless stream.Practices that were conducted by shamans and healers are thought to haveoriginated in Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) times. They were designed to fend offthe offending evil spirit and beg help for prevention and resolution of a myriadof problems, including health and disease prevention and cures from a bevy ofbenevolent spirits.Relics of Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) shamanism have been uncovered in Israel.An old woman whose burial site dated back to 10,000 BC was obviously thought tobe united with nature and animals, for she was buried with specially arrangedstone diagrams, fifty tortoise shells, a human foot, and skeletons of birds(including eagles), boars, leopards, and cattle.In 8000 BC, the heavens bombarded the Mesopotamian world with an unpredictabledeluge of events beyond man’s capacity to compete. The concept of a form of“stellar control” was a natural result of man’s awe—nothing “just happened,” foreverything was controlled by the gods. The stars were the symbol of divinity inthe ancient Sumerian culture; the predictable stars in the clear night skybecame the mother and father of what is called “astrology.”In the earliest stages of astrology the planets, the sun, and the moon were eachgiven a relationship with a god, who was associated with the power to controllife as it was known on Earth:Mercury was a quick, cunning, bisexual god, and was gifted with a calculatingwisdom.Mars was set in place as the ruler of violence and war.Jupiter was looked upon as the king-like ruler of men.Saturn was viewed as a distant cooling sun in exile and was seen as beingquick-tempered and cruel.Over time, these relationships and connections between stellar events and manbecame generally accepted, and they were merged into what is today calledastrology. Studies of Ice Age scrimshaw show clearly that man was familiar withlunar cycles by 30,000 BC. Fragments of documents from the reign of Sargon ofAgade (2870 BC) record how predictions were made from the position of the sun,the moon, the five known planets, and a collection of other documentedphenomena, including comets, eclipses and lightning storms. Since the beginningof astrology and the appearance of rationalism three hundred years ago,astronomy and astrology shared overlapping and layered facts and importance.The Chaldeans were famous for their accurate observations and mathematicalskills. They noted that the planetary bodies and stars in the skies adhered to apredictable pattern. They observed that the stars traveled in a “fixed order”across the heavens and the planets traveled eccentrically and in the same planeas the entire stellar cosmos.The first charts of planetary movement (ephemerides) were created, and the firstephemerides date back to the time of the Assyrian king Assurbanipal during themid-7th century BC.In preparing their cosmological charts and maps, the Chaldeans used the 12primary constellations through which the sun and the moon predictably traveledand which became the early “Zodiac.” Every two hours the constellations wouldchange their position in the sky by 30 degrees, or one-twelfth of the completecircle. For centuries, all astronomical observation remained tied to the risingand settings of stellar bodies within the cosmos. There was a second set oftwelve divisions, separate of the first known as “houses.” They were numberedfrom the east downward under the horizon and represented various aspects oflife: 1–Life, 2–Poverty/riches, 3–Brothers, 4–Parents, 5–Children,6–Illness/health; 7–Wife/husband, 8–Death; 9–Religion, 10–Dignities,11–Friendship, 12–Enmity. The planets were identified by what houses theyresided in and also by their relationships to each other and their intersectingangles which would reveal the influence they would have.A close relationship has always existed between health, medicine, and astrology;until the 18th century the two pursuits were overlapping and mixed, withknowledge of astrology an essential part of a doctor’s basic training and a mapto his treatment plan. An astrological chart would be created to determine whenthe patient would retire each evening, when to expect the disease peak or riseto a crisis, and what therapies to prescribe.The different parts of the patient’s anatomy were thought to be under theinfluence of specific Signs and planets that were also related to specificdiseases. The patient’s health and vitality were thought to be heavilyinfluenced by his Birth Chart, and it was thought with the correct care andeating the correct diet, he could avoid disease.Hermetic MedicineAstrological medicine was first organized in the work of Hermes Trismegistos,the name that the Greeks gave to the Egyptian god, Thoth, and although somelimited amounts of the treatments it recommended are still practiced, thissystem theorized that man reproduced himself in miniature (microcosm) and thestructure of the universe (macrocosm). It went on to point out that differentdiseases were specific to the different decans or ten degree divisions of theSigns. For example, stomach issues were indicated in the first decanate ofVirgo.The Four HumoursThe Greek physician/philosopher Hippocrates (460 BC) postulated that a man’scharacter and health were related to a balance of the four “humours”: blood,phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. The four humours were loosely connectedthrough astrology with the triplicities, the four groups of Signs: fiery,earthy, airy, and watery.“A physician without knowledge of astrology has no right to call himself aphysician.”—HippocratesCulpepper’s Herbal RemediesThe Arabs were the first to link the healing and curative nature of herbs withspecific “astrological signs and planets.” A variety of systems were employed todetermine which planet affected an herb typically through an interpretation ofthe triplicities. The Complete Herbal by Nicolas Culpepper (1616–1654) listsherbs according to the diseases they relieved or cured. For example, agrimonywas good for liver complaints, Jupiter rules the liver; therefore, Jupiter rulesagrimony. Each planet was designated as “lord of a day” (Sun/Sunday,Moon/Monday, and so forth). Therefore herbs gathered on their planet’s day,especially in the first and eight hours, were at their most efficient:Aries Briony (purging, cramps, stitches); Crowfoot (drawing a blister);Honeysuckle (biliousness); Nettles (pleurisy, sore throat); Rhubarb (mildpurgative).Taurus Arrack (swellings of the throat); Beans (the water good for thecomplexion; half a bean will stop a cut bleeding); Elder (root cures addersting; flowers boiled, water calms sunburn).Gemini Carrot (helps conception); Fern (swollen spleen; makes ointment for cutsor prickles); Haresfoot (diarrhea and dysentery); Lavender (headache, toothache;fainting, apoplexy and dropsy).Cancer Flax (inflammation, tumors; diseases of the chest and lungs); Privet(sore mouth, treating sores); Saxifrage (stomach weakness, cramps, convulsions;the leaves give a good flavor to wine).Leo Bay (berries good for cold, rheumatism; they mightily expel the wind);Celandine (piles and haemorrhoids); Walnuts (pain and inflammation of the ears).Virgo Caraway (helps digestion, sharpens the eyesight); Horehound (consumption,pain in the side, yellow jaundice); Myrtle (stops the spitting of blood;diarrhea and dysentery).Libra Asparagus (expels the stone; stirreth up lust); Chestnuts (the cough);Daisy (pleurisy and pneumonia); Garden mint (hiccoughs).Scorpio Broom (clears the chest); Furze (jaundice, cleaning the kidneys); Hops(cleanse the blood; cure venereal disease); Tobacco (rheumatic pain; toothache;powdered kills lice).Sagittarius Betony (removes spots from face and hands); Borage (clarifies theblood; fortifies); Dandelion (cleans the urinary passages); Moss (easesinflammation).Capricorn Amaranthus (stops all bleeding); Beet (burns, weals, blisters);Hemlock (roasted, good for gout and inflammation; very dangerous); Onion(coughs; earache; increase the sperm).Aquarius Heartsease (good for convulsions in children); Hemp (expels the wind,but makes men sterile; kills worms); Medlar (stops miscarriages); Quince (soremouths).Pisces Dock (cleans the blood, strengthens the liver; takes away freckles);(removes warts, chilblains); Sage (blackens the hair; cures headaches); Succory(‘drives forth cholera’).ANCIENT PRESCRIPTIONSStanley Finger, a neuroscientist and a medical historian, stated that “Theassertion that the brain may have been given a special role in higher functionsprior to the advent of the great civilizations is based on the fact that skullswith holes deliberately cut or bored into them have been found in a number ofNeolithic (New Stone Age) sites.”The procedure of drilling a hole in the skull by cutting, drilling, and scrapingis called trepanation and was common in ancient times. In prehistoric ages theexcised bone plug was often worn as a charm or amulet to fend off evil spirits.It is thought that trepanation was employed by ancient shamans to ward offcrippling headaches and seizures and allow “evil spirits” to flee. At a singleFrench burial site, dated back to 6500 BC, approximately a third of the 120prehistoric human skulls exhibited trepanation holes.Trepanation has been widely practiced throughout the world, including Africa,pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and across Europe. More than 10,000 trepanated skullshave been unearthed from ancient Peruvian excavation sites.In 1991 a human body (named “Otzi”) was recovered from the Otztaler Alps ofSouth Tyrol at the 10,600 foot altitude. He lay there covered by glacial ice for5,300 years. He was a dark-skinned male, aged between twenty-five and fortyyears. His build and stature were that of the Late Neolithic populations ofItaly and Switzerland (DNA analysis confirmed links to Northern Europe). Hisfacial hair was shaved. A full body scan showed that he had “black lung”resulting from the inhalation of campfire smoke, arteriosclerosis, arthritis (inhis neck, right hip, and lower back), and healed rib fractures from trauma thathad occurred long before his death.Otzi had multiple blue tattoos in the form of parallel lines and small crosseson both sides of his lower back, calf, ankles, and inner aspects of his rightknee. These marks are thought to be therapeutic signs to repel evil spirits. Hisbelongings found with the body included a copper axe, a 180 cm bow of yew wood,a deerskin quiver containing fourteen bone and stone pointed arrows, a sharpflint-bladed knife, collections of an agaric tree-fungus known for antibioticproperties, iron pyrite, charcoal and flint (fire starting tools), and size sixleather shoes (with lace holes) insulated with straw. A radiocarbon dating ofOtzi and his belongings indicate that he lived during 3300 BC.In March 2013 a study in Lancet reported the results of full body CT scans on137 mummies: one third (44) showed advanced vascular calcification. The mummiesoriginated from Egypt, Peru, the southwestern U.S., and the Aleutian Islands,and they were dated at 2000 BC.Cardiovascular disease is not genetically transmitted as doctors of the 20th and21st centuries would have you believe; rather, cardiovascular disease is acollection of diseases that are caused by free-radical damage to the lining ofthe arteries (inflammation) and nutritional deficiencies (e.g.,cardiomyopathy/selenium deficiency; congestive heart failure/thiaminedeficiency; coronary thrombosis/omega-3 deficiency, aneurysms/copper deficiency,atrial fibrillation/degenerative disc disease, and others).The magic-filled Ebers Papyrus, dated back to 1550 BC, contains a base ofsuperstitious recipes including incantations for fending off disease-causingdemons and evil spirits.Listed in the Ebers Papyrus was a prescription for the eye, to be employed forall ailments of the eye: “human brain, divide into two halves, mixed one halfwith honey, smear on the eye in the evening; dry the other half of the brain,mash, sift, smear on the eye in the morning.”Jackie Campbell at the KNH Center for Biomedical Egyptology at the University ofManchester in England has completed an exhaustive study of the ingredientsancient Egyptian physicians recommended for their patients. She determined thattwo thirds would actually have worked:According to Martindale’s Extra Pharmacopoeia (1977) sixty-two percent of theEgyptians’ choice of ingredients listed in the papyri were still employed in the1970s. Many, in their original form or in synthetic forms are still used today.To prepare their remedies, the Egyptians used processes known to 20th centurypharmacists. They knew how to concentrate remedies by boiling them, when todilute them, and by macerating or grinding produced more of the medicinalsubstances. The Egyptians were skilled at extracting active substances fromplants and producing water and alcohol tinctures.Compared to the 1973 British Pharmacological Codex sixty-seven percent of theancient Egyptian remedies complied with standards and protocols—with theexception of injectable remedies, the Egyptians produced and issued the samecategories of medicines as modern pharmacists.The medical papyri showed that the Egyptians used enemas, draughts andtinctures, lotions and liniments, creams, ointments, and mouthwashes. TheEgyptians employed eye drops administered through a bird’s feather shaft, pills,powders, and poultices, and for gynecological problems used pessaries; for nasalcongestion, physicians recommended remedies to be poured on hot stones and thesteam inhaled via a hollow reed. They routinely prepared and dispensedsuppositories by mixing the active agent into a heavy animal fat, rolling themix into a pill solid enough for insertion and which then would melt at bodytemperature.The opium poppy has historically been connected with the cultures of the NearEast including Turkey; however, there is a species of P. somniferum thatoriginates from southern France, Spain, and northwestern Africa.There is an ancient cave dated back to 5500 BC that in addition to manyartifacts found there were intact capsules of opium poppy discovered in areligious artifact. In the Swiss Lake village dated back to the Early Bronze Age(300 BC), stores of poppy seeds and presscake were found along with collectionsof flax (Linum spp.), barley (Hordeum spp.), einkorn, emmer, and bread wheat(Triticum spp.).It is not agreed upon whether the poppy was a semi-cultivated weed or acultivar. The Swiss Lake dwellings were unearthed in the Swiss Foreland betweenthe Alps and the Jura Mountains. These are located where the rivers originatingin the highlands and mountains drained into the lowlands, forming lakes and theheadwaters of the major European rivers such as the Rhine, Rhone, Po, and theDanube.It is not known by what means or route the people or poppies arrived from Iberiato Switzerland. However, the northward path along the Rhone River seems the mostplausible, and it is thought that farming cultures arrived from the Balkans byexploring the Danube.Initially, the poppy plant was cultivated in Switzerland in large quantities asa food seed that was pressed for oil and milled into flour; there is no evidencethat the poppy was smoked or used as medicine in early Western Europe.From 1600 to 1200 BC, the poppy trade was part of the northern European amberand tin trade routes and as a result spread eastward from Switzerland, and bothintentionally and accidently as a windblown weed spread to the easternMediterranean. Then in the Late Bronze Age, poppies are finally listed in Greekrecords, including in Homer’s Iliad, where the poppy was lauded and routinelyemployed as a potent medicinal herb (Theophrastus and Discoides) and wherepoppies and pomegranates (Punica) were commonly employed in art and jewelry.From the Greek city states, poppies spread into the cultures of Crete, Egypt,the Middle East, and the Near East, where the plant began to be used as anarcotic— opium. In ancient Crete, there appears to have been a poppy goddesswho wore a crown adorned with three poppy seed capsules.Some individuals took on the responsibility to call on good spirits and gods todefend and heal the victims of evil spirits. As villages, societies, andkingdoms developed, the culture’s witches, magicians, priests, physicians, andgod-kings took high positions or became “supreme deities” to protect theirpeople and even attempt to control global and stellar events.Priests, physicians, and god-kings began to build temples and towers toformalize their communications to spirits both good and evil. They mapped outthe stars and constellations, and they chanted and sang their prayers to thespirits of Hea (Earth) and Ana (Sky). They knew the spirits and gods changedtheir minds like the winds changed their directions, so prayer (in all itsforms), the burning of sacrifices (incense, goats, and humans) were thought tobe required to keep in good graces with their good and evil spiritual masters.They would perhaps chant: “Remember him who makes sacrifices. May forgivenessand peace flow for him like molten brass. May this man’s days be vivified by thesun!—Spirit of the Earth, remember! Spirit of the Sky, remember!”During these times of subservience to evil, maleficent, and also beneficentspirits and gods, the river tribes of the Tigris and Euphrates flourished. TheSumerians developed the lower Euphrates valley 5000 years BC; the blackAkkadians dominated Babylon 3000 BC; the Elamites, the early Persians, aretraced from the fourth millennium; the star-gazing constellation experts, theBabylonians, became founders of a “World Empire”; the Assyrians, as servants ofBabylon, conquered western Asia and Egypt; and the Medes were a perennialculture who were only later in time defeated by swarms of Persians whoeventually conquered all of Asia.THE FLOURISHING OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MEDICAL PAPYRIIn 1822 the translation of the Rosetta Stone led to the translation of ancientEgyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions and papyri, including many that were relatedto Egyptian medical papyri.The 19th century interest in Egyptology led to the discovery and translation ofmany sets of complete medical documents, including the Ebers Papyrus, the EdwinSmith Papyrus (1550 BC), the Hearst Papyrus (1450 BC), the Berlin papyrus (12000BC), the London Medical Papyrus, and others dating back to 3000 BC.The Edwin Smith Papyrus is a textbook on surgery and details anatomicalobservations and the “examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis” ofnumerous diseases. It is thought to have been written in 1600 BC; however, it isthought to be a copy and summary of several earlier medical texts. The medicalinformation it contains is known from 3000 BC.Imhotep, in the 3rd dynasty, is credited as the original author of the papyrustext, and is considered the founder of ancient Egyptian medicine. The earliestreported surgery was performed in Egypt in 2750 BC.The ancient Egyptians were consciously aware of the importance of diet, both in“balance and moderation.” Egypt was rich with fertile land because of themineral-rich silt delivered by the annual Nile River floods. However, the poor,landless, and the hungry were a constant feature of Egyptian society.The primary ancient Egyptian crops included emmer wheat and barley, which wereconsumed as loaves that were prepared by baking and fermentation with yeast.Typically one Egyptian farmer supported twenty people and their livestock.The barley was also fermented to brew beer, and a large variety of vegetablesand fruit were commonly grown. Oil was produced from the flax (linseed) plant,and there were herbs and spices that were grown, traded, and imported by farmersand merchants.Meat (mutton, lamb, goat, pig, birds, etc.) was plentiful and available toroyalty, the wealthy, and farmers. Fish was generally consumed by the masses.There are some writings that indicate that the Egyptians followed some forms offood restrictions and prohibitions; for instance, Herodotus declared that thepig was unclean. To gain the favor of kings and members of the royal court, itwas not unusual to bring offerings to show appreciation. Recorded offerings toKing Unas (2494–2345 BC) included “milk, three types of beer, five differentwines, ten loaves, four of bread, ten of cakes, four types of meat of differentcuts, joints, roast, spleen, limb, breast, quail, goose, pigeon, figs, ten typesof fruit, three varieties of corn, barley, spelt, five kinds of oil and freshplants . . .”Ancient texts (3300 BC) from the Middle East record the use of biologicalweapons. The ancient documents note that the Hittite’s empire, which covered theterritory from Turkey to northern Syria, shipped tularemia-infected rams totheir enemies. Tularemia (rabbit fever), a deadly bacterial disease, is stillused as a bioterror weapon in the 20th and 21st centuries.It is believed that tularemia, the “Hittite plague,” which roared through theMiddle East in the 14th century (1335 BC) was initiated by warring factions. Inletters to the Egyptian King Akhenaten, the besieged city of Simyra, aPhoenician city near the border between Lebanon and Syria, the citizenscomplained of the man-made pestilence.Egyptian scribes of the New Kingdom gathered and compiled ancient papyri devotedspecifically to medicine. The Ebers Papyrus (1550 BC) contains many incantationsand foul applications designed to fend off disease-causing demons, andadditionally it contains 877 prescriptions for specific diseases. The EbersPapyrus outlines a systematic medical process: listening to patients’complaints, framing a diagnosis based on physiological theories, and making aclinical examination. It is thought to be the earliest medical directiveachieved in Egyptian medicine, and it also is thought to contain some of theearliest recorded notes on tumors:When thou examinest a person who suffers from an obstruction in his abdomen andthou findest that it goes-and-comes under thy fingers like oil-in-a-tube, thensay thou: ‘It all comes from his mouth like slime!’ Prepare for him:Fruit-of-the-DompalmDissolve in Man’s SemenCrush, cook in Oil and HoneyTo be eaten by the Patient for four mornings.Afterwards let him be smeared with dried, crushed, and pressed maqut grain.When thou examines the obstruction in his abdomen and thou findest that he isnot in a condition to leap the Nile, his stomach is swollen and his chestasthmatic, then say thou to him: ‘It is the Blood that has got itself fixed anddoes not circulate.’ Do thou cause an emptying by means of a medicinal remedy.Make him therefore:Wormwood1/8Elderberries1/16Sebesten1/8Sasda-chips1/8Cook in Beer-that-has-been-brewed-from-many-ingredients, strain into one,thoroughly and let the Patient drink.This remedy drives out blood through his mouth or rectum which resembles Hog’sBlood when-it-is-cooked.

Through and until the Persian invasion of525 BC Egyptian medical practices went unchanged and were considered veryadvanced. They included surgery, bone setting, and a complete and wide-rangingpharmacopoeia.Homer in 800 BC stated in the Odyssey: “In Egypt, the men are more skilled inmedicine than any of human kind” and “the Egyptians were skilled in medicinemore than any other art.”The Greek historian Herodotus visited Egypt in approximately 440 BC and wroteextensively of his observations of their medical practices.Pliny the Elder also wrote favorably of them in historical review. Hippocrates,considered “the father of medicine,” as well as Herophilos, Erasistratus, andlater, Galen, studied at the temple of Amenhotep and acknowledged thecontribution of ancient Egyptian medicine to Greek medicine.Magic was a double-edged sword. It could be an all-powerful protector, and itcould be conversely a terrible and vicious destroyer. Sorcerers becameindependent agents who acted beyond the laws of religions, gods, and kings, andwho could formulate spells (for good or evil) that could save or kill for aprice.Cuneiform inscriptions from the royal library at Nineveh, which in the seventhcentury BC King Ashurbanipal had compiled from the ancient Akkadian texts, arean example of sorcerers incantations designed to kill:The imprecation acts upon man like an evil demon. The screaming voice is uponhim. The maleficent voice is upon him. The malicious imprecation is the cause ofhis disease. The maleficent imprecations strangle this man as if he were a lamb.The god in his body made the wound, the goddess gives him anxiety. The screamingvoice, like that of the hyena, has overcome him and masters him.Individual sorcerers were believed to possess “the evil eye” that empowered themto kill by merely glancing at an individual. Other sorcerers manufactured dollsor images of their victims that they burned or stabbed with needles or knives,inflicting various levels of damage depending on what level of sickness or deathwas desired:He who forges the image, he who enchants–The spiteful face, the evil eye;The mischievous mouth, the mischievous words.Spirit of the Sky, remember!Spirit of the Earth, remember!Incantations were formulated against black magic and ubiquitous demons ofdisease, which entered houses like snakes to inflict infertility upon women,kill children with disease, and decimate fields like hoards of Asian armies:They fall on one land after the other.They raise the slave above his rank,They cast the freewoman out of the house where she gave birth,They cast the young birds out of their nests into emptiness,They drive the oxen before them, they drive away the lamb,The evil, the cunning demons.The calls for peace were often raised in the midst of chaos and dread throughhymns, prayer, and incantations for peace. Fragments of such incantations werediscovered on a broken tablet:The garlands . . . exalted shepherd . . . on the thrones and alters . . . themarble scepter . . . exalted shepherd, King, shepherd of the peoples.The hymns and prayers of peace would end when Namtar, the terrible demon, wouldunfold his black wings to spread disease and pestilence, and even strong andsuccessful humans would make offerings, sacrifice lambs, and pray to the godsand spirits to save their families and themselves from sickness and death:Spirit of Mulge (master of hell), Lord of the countries, remember.Spirit of Nin-gelal (Earth), Lady of the countries, remember.Spirit of Nindar (Saturn), mighty warrior of Mulge, remember.Spirit of Paku (Mercury), sublime intelligence of Mulge, remember.Spirit of En-Zuna (moon), son of Mulge, remember.Spirit of Tishku (Venus), Lady of the hosts, remember.Spirit of Udu, King of Justice, remember.Evil beings and demons were able to sicken and kill both man and his flocks;however, they could not end life on Earth completely, nor could they completelyor permanently disrupt the cycles of nature (the tides, seasons, and so forth).An eclipse of the sun or moon could produce panic or be blamed for disease, butin short order the sun and moon reappeared as symbols of order and producers oflife.THE BELIEFS OF THE CHALDEAN PEOPLEAs human societies moved forward over time they developed better laws andinterpretations of signs. The Chaldeans, Semitic people who settled in southernBabylonia in the area of modern Iraq, and ruled Babylonia from 625–539 BC,studied the stars and constellations in night sky and the Chaldean priestsrecognized a “Supreme god.”The Chaldean Supreme god was considered a creative god tied to eternal laws. Twothousand years earlier a caste of priests had been created, to whom all occultknowledge was entrusted. These priests became masters in the magic andprescience of the day and were taken to predicting the future from the liversand intestines of animal sacrifices and from the fire and smoke and thesparkling fire reflected in precious jewels. They would predict future eventsfrom the noise emanating from bubbling springs and unusual shapes of leaves andplants. They would communicate with snakes, and birth defects in both man andanimals could be used for their predictions of the future of animals, humans,and nations. Dreams were looked at as predictors of the future health andfortunes of men and nations.Weather events such as rain, cloud formations, wind, and lightening would beinterpreted for predictions of bad health and plagues. Even the splitting andcracking of furniture and wooden paneling were believed to predict the future.Such defects were referred to as Assaput or prophetic voices. Flies andappearances of other insects and dogs of various colors were messengers offorthcoming health status and events.The priests constantly looked to the night sky, stars, and constellations forlaws of harmony, and through observation they recognized there was order in theheavens that was predictable. A compilation of this celestial order producedwhat we call today astrology; the priests interpreted this cycle as a harmoniousplay. They recorded how events in the heavens controlled events on Earth, suchas the tide winds. The priests looked at this celestial hierarchy as thesuperior ruling over the inferior Earth. In other words, the star-gods in theheavens ruled and controlled all earthly events below.Metals have always been related to the underworld since they were found in thehidden reaches of the Earth where light from the sun, moon, and stars never fellon them. However, the Chaldean astrologers saw a relationship between metals andthe planets—a concept which drove the medieval alchemists and physicians.Chaldeans believed that gold was the metal of the sun, silver was the metal ofthe moon, lead was Saturn, tin was Jupiter, iron was Mars, and copper was inVenus.Sacred numbers are part of the astronomer’s world and the tools of theastrologer. These numbers are directly and indirectly related; they seem tosupport and assist one another and are used to make predictions. The believedthe number 7 occurs in the main stars of the Great Bear, the Lesser Bear, in thePleiades, and in Orion. The number 7 also fits the days of the moon quarter andthe 7 Planets of antiquity.There are the 12 zodiacal symbols, 30 is the number of a moon period, and 30 arethe number of years of Saturn’s orbit around the sun. The product of 12 and 30is about the number of days in a year.The avid astrologer finds fertile fields in celestial numbers for theirquestions and predictions. Along with astrology, the idea of mystical numbersfound support, and thus numerology has found daily use by passionate devotees.The Chaldeans were accurate observers of the stars and planets, and many oftheir beliefs were derived from what we now call meteorology, physics,chemistry, and medicine.Astrology is a mix of myth, science, and religion. The author of The History ofMagic and the Occult, Kurt Seligmann, states, “In its vast domain there isnourishment for both spirit and soul, and there can be no doubt that astrologyowes its longevity to its psychic rather than to its intellectual value.”Astrology and numerology are such profound discoveries that no generation ortime has been without their effect.Chaldean royalty conceived and built the temple tower known as the ziggurat. Thetower featured steps that expressed the relationship between the celestial worldabove and the Earth below.The ziggurat represented a miniature world and was known as the “mountain ofEarth.”In Babylon the royals and priests built the El-Temen-An-Ki or the house of thefoundation stone of Heaven and Earth. This monument was called the Tower ofBabel in the Bible. The tower had seven stages that represented the sevenplanets, and its angles represented the four corners of the world pointing toAkkad, Saburtu, Elam, and the western lands.The seven steps of the tower were painted different colors that represented theplanets. The height of El-Temen-An-Ki was equal to its length. The resultingsquare was divided into seven, and yet respected the ancient belief of thefourfold world. For the first time in history numbers represented the worldorder.A legend describes Pythagoras travelling to Babylon, where he taught the wonderand mystery of numbers. An earlier woodcut depicts a learned man wrapped in adoctor’s cloak placing his foot on the first step of the tower to attain “theknowledge of God.”By ascending these seven steps the doctor would attain the knowledge of God,which would be found at the eighth degree—the threshold of God’s heavenlydwelling. In Lully’s book On the Ascent, the seven steps are stone, fire,plants, animals, man, starry heavens, and the angels.The Babylonian commonwealth was operated according to the law that priests hadformulated from observations of the universe. They believed that nothing coulddisrupt the world and its laws other than the “impiety of man.” Once provoked,the gods would leave the temples and choose to move to a foreign country (maybeeven an enemy state). Then chaos would rule and Chaldea would become a victim ofevil men and evil spirits. The temple towers were the symbols of the repositoryof all ancient wisdom. With the belief that their knowledge was to be validforever, the kings had constructed the towers in such a fashion that they wouldresist the ravages of time and last forever. The ziggurat never attained aheight above 300 feet. The royal seal was on each brick, and the kings who builtthem claimed the towers were like Heaven and built to be the equivalent statusof superhuman. In the symbolic language of Asia, the towers builders said,“Come, let us build ourselves a city with a tower, whose top shall reach to theHeavens, so that we may not be scattered over all the Earth.”Included in the rebuilt temple towers by Nabopalassar (who reigned 625–604 BC)was the Tower of Babylon. An inscription dedicating this event reads:As for the temple tower of Babylon, El-Temen-An-Ki, which before my time hadbecome weakened and had fallen in, Marduk the lord commanded me to lay itsfoundation in the heart of the Earth and to raise its turrets to Heaven. Icaused numerous workmen to be assembled in my land to carry them. I set to work,I made bricks, I manufactured burnt bricks. Like the downpour of Heaven whichcannot be measured, like the massive flood, I caused the Arabu to carry bitumenand pitch. With the help of Hea, with the insight of Marduk, with the wisdom ofNebo and Nisaba . . . I came to a decision. By means of exorcism, in the wisdomof Hea and Marduk, I cleared away the place and on the original site I laid itsplatform foundation.The rebuilt tower again degenerated into ruin. King Nebuchadnezzar,Nabopalassar’s son and successor (who reigned 605–562 B.C.), refers to itsrestoration in an inscription: “The temples of Babylon I have restored. As forEl-Temen-An-Ki, with burned bricks and bright ugnu-stone I raised on high itsturrets.”Eventually these famous towers disappeared with the lavishness and glory ofBabylon.EARLY MEDICINES: ANTIDOTES AND CURATIVESShamanism, the practice of contacting spirits through dream work and meditation(trances), is thought to be one of the oldest religions and is still practicedin many primitive cultures even in modern times. By means of fasting andmeditation, shamans walked the spirit path to gather knowledge. Shamanscollected knowledge and developed skills of magic enhanced by magical tools likerattles and bones, and their rituals included playing drums, chanting, singing,dancing, and making sacrifices around a fire.The Celts (350 BC) of West and Central Europe created the Druids, a priestlyclass. Like shamans, Druids accumulated knowledge about the spiritual world andthey became specialized as healers (doctors), midwives, and leaders withunderstanding of rituals, weather, law, and astrology.In 371 AD, the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as the official state religion.Roman soldiers enforced the official state religion and killed local priests whodefied them. This cruel purge included the Druids who were decimated and killed.It was 400 BC when Hippocrates and members of his “radical Greek movement”teased the “art” of medicine from the loins of magicians and priests. It is notclear whether Hippocrates himself authored the Hippocratic Corpus. However,these writings show that a small band of Greek physicians committed themselvesto a new and revolutionary thought: “Disease sprang from natural and or physicalcauses from the patient’s environment, diet, and daily habits rather than Divinepunishment or evil spirits.”Prior to Euclid, geometry was utilitarian as practiced; it was created to meet aparticular need in surveying or astronomy. The ancient Egyptians knew how tocalculate the area of a circle. The Babylonians knew how to measure areas andvolumes. It wasn’t until the Hellenistic period, around 300 BC, that the stateof geometry (Greek: geometria—to measure the earth) changed forever with theworks of a mathematician named Euclid.Euclid published his revolutionary works in geometry in a series of books titledThe Elements of Geometry. The series presents a collection of axioms and, fromthese deduces propositions and theorems. Although Euclid’s work was not a newthought, he was the first to show how these theorems could fit into acomprehensive and deductive system. According to Euclid’s axioms, any two pointscan be connected by a straight line; any straight line whose length can bedetermined can be extended in a straight line; a circle can contain any centerand any radius; all right angles are equal to each other; the fifth axiomrelates to the intersections of lines in a plane.Since the beginning of time, humans have been fearful of poisons. In ancientRome poisons were used to facilitate assassinations and state-decreedexecutions, which generated the search for a universal antidote. Two widelyknown antidotes, which were thought to provide protection against a wide varietyof poisons, were Mithridatium, developed in 100 BC, and Theriac, developedduring the first century AD. The number of herbs, metals, and elements thatcomprised these formulas is beyond comprehension.Mithridatium is thought to have been formulated by Mithridates VI, King ofPantus (Turkey) who was a mix of Persian, Greek, and Macedonian ancestry. TheKing created the formula, which contained more than 45 substances, out of fearsof assassination by poisoning from animal venoms and mystic poisons. He testedthe effectiveness of his formula on slaves and condemned criminals.In the first century AD, Andromachus the Elder, physician to Roman Emperor Nero,updated Mithridatium with the addition of viper flesh and increasing the dosageof opium. The resulting formula was referred to as Theriac. In the twelfthcentury it was also called Venice Treacle and was known to contain at least 64ingredients, including minerals, poisons, animal flesh, herbs, flowers, seaonions (squills), and honey.Theriac was thought to be a protectant and antidote against poisoning and alsowas believed to be a treatment for a plethora of diseases including bubonicplague. By the Middle Ages, Theriac contained more than 100 ingredients andrequired several years to “mature.” Throughout Europe, Theriac was still widelyavailable well into the twentieth century.According to John Griffin, “The two ancient products, Mithridatium and TheriacAndromachus, held central places in therapeutics for nearly two millennia.Concern for the quality of these products was the stimulus for requiring thepublic compounding of these preparations, later (this practice was) replaced byinspection of manufacture and examination of finished product . . . Perhaps inthe final analysis, the contribution of Mithridatium and Theriac to modernmedicine was that concerns about their quality stimulated the earliest conceptsof medicine’s regulation.”In the year 1000 AD, a strange fate befell the mummies of ancient Egypt. Thepeoples of Europe somehow got the idea that by consuming a dried powder derivedfrom Egyptian mummies they could gain miraculous healing power and longevity.For many centuries, Europeans had used a curative powder derived from a dark,pitch-like substance called bitumen. Originally, bitumen was found oozing out ofthe cracks in the rocks of certain mountains in distant Persia.After it was dried and hardened, bitumen was ground into fine particles thatcould be consumed orally or used as a topical medicine on sores, ulcers, andwounds. The downside was that Persian bitumen was scarce and pricey.Egyptian mummies that had been soaked in pitch were dark and brittle. A newtrade developed. Hundreds of thousands of mummies were dug up. The primarysource of these mummies was the mass graves of the “hastily mummified poor.”Their bodies, whole or dismembered, were then shipped to apothecaries or drugtraders of Europe, where they were ground into a black “butumen powder”!Powdered mummy was used for every ailment and sickness. It was taken by mouth asa remedy for concussions, paralysis, epilepsy, ulcers, coughs, and headaches,and as an antidote for poisoning. Dried mummy was applied topically to bruisesand broken bones, and it was believed to prevent infection and stop hemorrhage.King Francis I, who ruled France in the 1500s, never travelled without his pouchof ground mummy powder should he fall from his horse or have some unforeseeninjury.People of Europe believed that bitumen cured many ills and that Egypt’s mummiescontained bitumen. Pitch and bitumen are chemically very similar, and so therewould have been some real healing benefit from the corpse’s mineral content.The word “mummy” originated in Persia as the word “mum” and the Arabic word“mumiyah,” both of which translate to mean bitumen. As a result of the perceivedbenefit, the world’s annual demand for dried mummy grew ever stronger for manycenturies.By the 1600s, so many of the ancient Egyptian mass grave pits had been robbedand pilfered that, as a result, there wasn’t enough “ground mummy medicine” tomeet the demand—prices soared!A grisly trade developed to meet the demand; the bodies of animals, criminals,beggars, disease victims, and the freshly dead were converted into “instant”mummies by soaking them in pitch or asphalt and letting them dry quickly in thedesert sun.Over time, the word of the mummy “factories” and the wide-spread fraud of themummy traders spread, sales dropped and by the mid-1700s, the world demand forground mummy began to fade. The mummy factories adapted and sold their instantground mummy as bone meal and fertilizer to British farmers.Ground mummy was also used as an ingredient in the mixing of artist’s paints forportraits in the belief that work of art and the subject would live longer. Thetorn and discolored linen wrappings from mummies were sold in Europe andAmerica, and by the 1800s, the paper mills in America began to use theresin-soaked linen to manufacture brown paper. In Egypt the poor desert peopleused the resin-soaked linen bandages for fuel.image [../images/00003.jpeg]The persecution of Jewish physicians and healers and their colleagues is apervasive continuum in the history of medicine. In 1161, eighty-six Jews wereburned alive as punishment for “an alleged plot by Jewish physicians to poisonthe citizens of Bohemia in central Europe.” In 1348 many Jews were“exterminated” for supposedly causing the Black Death in Europe, despite thefact that many Jews died during the ravages of the plague.According to pronouncements of the medical faculty of the University of Vienna(1610), Jewish law “forced Jewish physicians to murder every tenth Christian bymeans of poisoning.”Martin Luther, the German theologian wrote, “If they (the Jews) could kill usall, they would gladly do so . . . They do it often, especially those who poseas physicians.” Luther, also encouraged his followers to “burn down theirsynagogues.”Several popes in the European Middle Ages forbade Christians from seeking helpfrom Jewish physicians, and later in the seventeenth century, the clergy of Hallin Wurttemberg declared that, “it were better to die with Christ than to becured by a Jew doctor aided by the devil.”In 1905 Albert Einstein, a 26-year-old Jewish patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland,first published in a paper his findings known as the “special theory ofrelativity” which made use of two key physical ideas that were known previously:the principle of relativity and the constant speed of light.Prior to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity about the constant speed of light,physicists believed that electromagnetic waves moved through a medium called“ether,” similar to the process of ocean waves moving through water. They lookedat ether as a background against which all movement took place, believing “allmass in motion moved relative to the ether.”Einstein felt that it was a mistake to assume the existence of ether, which hadnot been verified experimentally.In his theory of relativity, Einstein did away with the concept of ethercompletely, assuming only that the laws of physics, including the speed oflight, worked the same no matter how the observer was moving. The mathematicalconsequences of Einstein’s theory were no less than Earth-shaking, and they havebeen experimentally verified. The expression of the theory is: “as an objectmoves with a velocity relative to an observer, the object’s mass increases andits length contracts.” Probably the most famous consequence of the theory is theequivalence of mass and energy that is explained in the simple equation: E =mc2.The special theory of relativity also demonstrated a basic link between spaceand time: “four-dimensional framework referred to as ‘the space-time continuum.’This continuum consists of three dimensions representing space up/down;left/right; forward/backward; and a single dimension representing time.”Einstein’s theory is thought to be special because it applies the principle ofrelativity only to the special case in which the motion of objects is uniform.In spite of the extraordinary contributions of Jewish scientists, doctors, andother professionals, in 1938 Germany revoked the licenses of Jewish physicians.The resultant doctor shortage caused Germany to reduce the period of medicaltraining by two years.In the years just before World War II, quotas limited the number of Jewishmedical students and physicians at American medical schools. To judge themedical school applicant’s Jewishness, administrators examined student names andasked about religious affiliation on medical school applications. In 1940 thedean of Cornell University’s medical college limited the number of Jews allowedto enter each class, and the applications of Jewish candidates at Yale MedicalSchool were marked with an “H” for Hebrew. The head of Columbia University’sNeurological Institute was instructed in 1945, “to fire all the Jews in hisdepartment or resign.” He resigned!In modern times Jewish doctors continue to be subjected to fictitiousallegations. In 1988 a Chicago mayoral assistant charged that “Jews injected theAIDS virus into African Americans,” and in 1997 a prominent Palestinianrepresentative suggested that the “Israelis injected Palestinian children withHIV.”Through the span of 28,000 years, from the time of the Lascaux Cave drawings tothe medical robotics of the 21st century, humans developed hundreds, if notthousands, of theories to explain the causes and transmission of disease, oursolar and weather events, and physical laws. The numbers of people who weretortured and killed in the pursuit of answers to questions of science andmedicine numbered in the millions, and in most cases little or no progress wasachieved.The few individuals who dared to question the thinking of the priests andphysicians paid the highest price. But there were those who were able to weavethe prevailing theories into their new thinking—to move humanity forward andproduce new sciences including alchemy, medicine, and pharmacy as we know themtoday."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOMYTHS AND ALCHEMYGOLD COOKSPlato says that there are four species of beings—those of the air, the birds;those of the water, the fishes; those of the Earth, the pedestrians; and thoseof the heavens, the stars, whose element is fire.During the Renaissance, Agrippa von Nettesheim, reluctant to accept the ideathat the stars were related to the Earthly fauna, modified Plato’s statement.Agrippa, basing his opinion on Aristotle, Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder, saidthat, ‘fire shelters salamanders and crickets.’ A simple experiment would haveproven that salamanders and crickets die in fire, like any other animal, butAgrippa shared with the past an aversion to experimentation. From Pliny we learnthat similar beliefs concerning the marvelous virtues of salamanders existed inEgypt and Babylon. Without a doubt Aristotle had gathered his wisdom fromOriental neighbors, and did not find it necessary to submit the salamander to ascientific test. Thus did a superstitious belief perpetuate itself for about twothousand years.—Kurt SeligmannThe History of Magic and the OccultAlchemy stresses that non-human substances—the dematerialized earthsubstances—participate vicariously in a mysterious transformation. Thealchemists saw ‘spiritualized’ substance as able to become a pontifex, ‘bridgebuilder.’ They called it the lapis philosophorum (philosopher’s stone) orCaelum, Heaven, and likened it to the Christ as an imago Dei, man’s likeness toGod. A caelum, Jung tells us, was ‘described as a universal medicine (thepanacea, alexipharmic, medicine catholica, etc.), as a life pro-longing,strengthening and rejuvenating magical potion.’ It was ‘living stone,’ a ‘stonethat hath a spirit ... Above all, its incorruptibility is stressed: It lasts along time, or for all eternity; though alive it is unmoved; it radiates magicpower and transforms the perishable into the imperishable and the impure intothe pure; it multiplies itself indefinitely; it is simple and thereforeuniversal.’ (C.G. Jung, Collected Works, Vol. 14, par. 770; Princeton UniversityPress, 1963.)—Edward C. Whitmont, MDThe Alchemy of Healing: Psyche and SomaELIXIR OF LIFEThe word “elixir” originates from the Arabian word “aliksir,” and in ancientGreek chemical writings translates to “the transmuting agent, by which basemetals could be turned into gold and silver.” European alchemists referred tothe “Philosopher’s Stone” which was generally believed to possess universalcurative powers, as the Elixir of Life. Many ancient scholars recorded that theelixir could be concocted from other stones not identical to the philosopher’sstone. A notation in the Universal Lexicon by H. Zedler, an eighteenth centuryreference, defined the word elixir as “a dark-coloured medicine, composed ofmany ingredients dissolved in a strong solvent.”A belief in a “panacea” or universal remedy for all diseases can be traced backto the ancient times when the immortality of the gods was explained by theirconsumption of special foods and drink—the nectar and ambrosia of the Greekgods. It was generally believed that the Elixir of Life and other panaceas couldbe created from a mixture of rare ingredients like gold, pearls, and a varietyof jewels.During early centuries AD, Alexandria was the center for the secret doctrinethat promised to convert impure metals into gold and concurrently to converthumans into pure sages. And the grand goal for their alchemical beliefs was tobe able to produce the “universal remedy”—the panacea.The theory posed that if in fact the philosopher (alchemist) had achieved alevel of expertise such that he could become an expert in metallictransformation by turning base metal into gold, he should be able to employthese skills for solving the problems of humans, including all diseases. This iswhere the lofty goals of the Western and those of the Chinese came together.There are myths and legends of a great Chinese master of the secrets of alchemyof the second century AD, Wei Po-Yang, who is said to have become immortal alongwith one of his disciples and his dog, which had accidently eaten the leftoversof the magical panacea.In Europe the hunger for gold created a single-minded obsession, and as a resultthe interest in synthetizing and transmuting base metals into gold was raised toa feverish pitch and spoken of more frequently than the original loftier goal ofsearching for the Elixir of Life.Typically, medicines are formulated to treat or cure a specific disease;however, the alchemist’s ultimate goal was the creation of the panacea thatwould cure all maladies and produce immortality. The theory that would supportthe lofty goal included the concept that all diseases had a common or universaletiology that was “a disturbed balance of the elements and humours.” Therefore,if it were possible to find an agent able to redress this balance, the universalremedy would be found.Numerous alchemists had claimed to have created the panacea, includingParacelsus and Jan Baptist van Helmont (1577–1644 AD). In the writings ofParacelsus’s followers, the medical alchemists who cured disease by means ofinorganic compounds rather than drugs, there are numerous references to amysterious “tincture philosophorum” or Philosopher’s Tincture. One of thewritten works of 1560 points out that by employment of the art of the truealchemist the tincture is concocted, and that “the true aim of the true medicalmen is the resurrection and regeneration of nature.”In a written text attributed to Paracelsus and published initially in 1570,entitled De Tinctura Physicorum (On the Tincture of the Physicians), is found:“This is the tincture by which some of the first physicians in Egypt,afterwards, up till our times, have lived for 150 years. The lives of many ofthem lasted for some centuries, as history clearly teaches, although this doesnot seem to be true to anybody: because its force is so miraculous, that it isable to enlighten the body . . . and to strengthen him to such a degree that hewill remain free of all diseases and although afflicted by old age, will appearas it had been in his youth. Therefore the tincture physicorum is a universalremedy which devours all sicknesses like a fire devouring wood. Its quantity istiny, but its force is mighty.”More than any other ancient culture, the Greeks used inductive reasoning and amix of poetry and mythology. Natural phenomena were looked at through the prismof “the higher realms of the mind which were thought to partake of the divine.”This process of reasoning may explain why the Greeks failed to pursueexperimental investigations to prove or disprove theories or myths.Despite the Greeks legendary feats of logic, they proposed very weak andunscientific theories for the explanation of natural events. This process andthe Greek rejection of experimentation resulted in an unquestioning acceptanceof authority without experimental proof. Western doctors acquired thisunscientific procedure from Hellenic philosophy. Throughout the Middle Ages,during the Renaissance, and even yet today, the natural sciences and the medicalarts use inductive reasoning and authority to arrive at and support theirversion of “truth” rather than facts and deductive reasoning.It appears that the practice of alchemy migrated to the West at the beginning ofthe second century of the Christian era. The most believable evidence came fromPliny the Elder (AD 23–79), who devoted a considerable volume of his writings tometallurgy. The variety of information and beliefs concerning metals and theirtreatment noted by Pliny show that he supported the use of alchemy.Despite the general belief of alchemists that their art is an ancient Egyptianpractice, it is a fact that alchemy is the youngest of magical wisdoms. Thebelief that alchemy was widely employed in the time of the pharaohs has beendashed.It was in the fourth century, during the vicious battles that Christianity wagedagainst pagans, that alchemy became generally popular.Zosimus of Panopolis, a scribe and writer of the time became a historian of thealchemical arts. His writings are thought to be the most accurate and completeof the zealous believers.Zosimus stated that an expertise and the use of metals, precious stones, andscents were recorded in the writings of Genesis in the Old Testament: “The sonsof God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair.” The men named as the“sons of God” were thought to be “fallen angels” who had “mated” with the womenof antediluvian times.These angels are thought to have trained these women various skills and arts,including how to create jewelry, fashionable clothes, and perfumes.The sages of the Christian era believed that the fallen angels were “evilperverters of morals and manners.” Zosimus felt these events were “thebeginnings of alchemy.”Zosimus names the legendary and mysterious Chemes, an early master of thealchemical arts, as one of the founders of gold-makers. It was generallyaccepted that Chemes had written a book entitled Chema, and that fallen angelshad used the book to train the daughters of men.The Greek word Chemia, the early name of the art of alchemy, is thought to havebeen derived from Chemes and his book Chema. Arabs then added the prefix ‘al’and the art then became alchemy.Found in a conceptual manuscript (this manuscript holds great importance to thebelievers and students of alchemy), a priestess who identified herself as Isiswrote to her son Horus that she had gained her knowledge of alchemy from Amnael,the first of the fallen angels and prophet. Isis noted that Amnael had rewardedher with the knowledge of alchemy for sexual favors.An additional book, written by a woman with the pseudonym of “Mary the Jewess,”is also considered to be a manuscript of extraordinary value. Mary, a Greek, isthought to be the first alchemist of the West. Much of her writings are found infragments because of the ravages of time, but she is identified by Zosimus as “asister of Moses called Miriam.”The alchemist Olympiodorus, who lived in the fourth century of the Christianera, quotes a famous note in Miriam’s book that suggests she was a Jewess: “Donot touch it (if you are not of the Abrahamitic race), unless indeed you are ofour race.”Another female alchemist, a woman who called herself Cleopatra, wrote a bookentitled Chrysopeia (Gold-Making); a third woman, Theosebia, the sister ofZosimus wrote numerous tracts on alchemy in the third century of the Christianera.There are additional early Greco-Egyptian texts such as the well-known Leydenand Stockholm Papyri, which date back to AD 300.Scholarly writings of Zosimus (fourth century), Stephanus (seventh century),Olympidorus (fourth century), and Synesius (fifth century) cannot be impeached.While in some instances alchemy embraced religion, there were also some of thealchemic scholars who crossed swords with religion. Along with magic and otherforbidden arts, alchemy was thought to be shared with humans by fallen angels,“the betrayers of God’s secrets.”The practitioners of the forbidden arts had to be cursed and punished.Experimentation in the works of nature were deemed to be sacrilegious. St.Augustine censured the vain and curious desire of investigations referred to as“knowledge and science.”Lucretius (98–53 BC) in his book On the Nature of Things touted, “Thus isreligion trod down, by a just reverse; victory makes us akin to gods.” Then headds, “Do not think that I wish to teach you the principles of impiety, or tolead you to the path of crime.”In 167 BC the Roman general Aemilius Paulus conquered and routed King Perseus ofMacedonia and decimated the dynasty that was a descendent of Alexander the Greatand his father King Philip. Perseus and his three sons were sent to Rome inchains and paraded through the streets of Rome behind the triumphal chariots.Following the practice of national kleptocracy, Aemilius Paulus shipped wagonsfull of plunder to the Roman treasury, keeping for himself a single tribute— thedefeated king’s library. This act was to be a display of the crowning glory ofthe conquering general’s personal fortune and the incredible value he placed onGreek culture, literature, and knowledge.It became a fashion statement for wealthy Romans to collect large privatelibraries in their homes and villas. Books could also be bought from booksellersin southern Italy and Sicily where the Greeks had established cities such asNaples, Tarentum, and Syracuse.The grammarian Tyrannion was legendary for his accumulation of 30,000 volumes;Serenus Sammonicus, a physician who became an expert in the employment of themagical formula “Abracadabra” to fend off illness, is reputed to have collected60,000 volumes. Rome had become addicted to books, a penchant that was describedas the “Greek fever.”On the Nature of Things by Lucretius is the work and writings of a disciple ofEpicurus, who was collecting and publishing ideas and thoughts that had beenespoused centuries earlier. Epicurus, Lucretius’s “philosophical messiah,” was aphilosopher and polymath, born at the end of 342 BC on the Aegean island ofSamos, where his father, a poor Athenian schoolmaster, had immigrated. ManyGreek philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle, were born of wealthy familiesand flaunted their distinguished ancestry.Epicurus’s philosophical opponents trumpeted their own personal socialsuperiority and pointed fingers at his humble family background. He used toaccompany his mother while she made rounds reading charms and omens. Lucretiusand numerous others fostered him as “godlike” in his wisdom and courage. Thecenter piece of his vision can be traced back to a single thought— “hyle,” theGreek word for “stuff.”Epicurus believed “that everything that has ever existed and everything thatwill ever exist is put together out of indestructible building blocks,irreducibly small in size, unimaginably vast in number.”Epicurus claimed, “Moreover, the universe as a whole is infinite, for whateveris limited has an outermost edge to limit it, and such an edge is defined bysomething beyond. Since the universe has no edge, it has no limit; and since itlacks a limit, it is infinite and unbounded. Moreover, the universe is infiniteboth in the number of its atoms and in the extent of its void.”Epicurus lived until 270 BC and wrote more than 300 books on topics ranging frommoral philosophy to physics and epistemology. He taught that the human soul doesnot survive the body’s death and that the gods, even though they exist, do notgovern fate or destiny.The Greeks had a word for these invisible building blocks, the particles that,as they thought of them, could not be divided into any smaller particles called“atoms.” This notion of atoms (the Greek: “can’t be cut”), which had come tolife in the fifth century BC with Leucippus of Abdera and his protige’Democritus, was in its beginnings, a wild speculation. The proof would not comefor more than two thousand years.The prevailing thoughts of the time included the theory that the core matter ofthe universe was fire, water, air, and earth. Others posed that if one could seethe smallest particle of a man, you would see a tiny man, and the same would betrue for a horse, water, or a leaf. Others believed that the order of theuniverse was itself evidence of an invisible mind or spirit that carefully putthe pieces together in a pre-orchestrated grand plan. Democritus’s conception of“endless numbers of atoms that exhibit no special talents other than small size,shape, and weight— particles that are not miniature versions of what we can see,but construct what we see by combination with others in a wide variety ofshapes—was a fantastically daring solution to a problem that engaged the greatintellects of his world.”It took many centuries of wrestling with the concept of atoms to develop auniform theory. Epicurus began at the age of twelve, when his teachers could notdefine the meaning of chaos. Democrittus’s earlier theory of atoms filled themissing piece and provided the missing clue. At the age of thirty-two heestablished a school, and there in a garden in Athens, Epicurus conceived anentire theory of the universe and a philosophy of human life.He theorized that atoms, in constant motion, collide with one another, and theywould join to form more complex and larger bodies. He conceptualized that thelargest bodies, the sun and the moon, are made of atoms, as are humans,waterflies, and grains of sand, meaning there are no super categories of matter:no hierarchy of elements. He believed heavenly bodies are not divine beings thathave a power to control and shape human destiny for good or evil—and they do notmove through space under the guidance of gods—they are simply part of thenatural order, giant combinations of atoms subject to the same laws of creationand destruction that govern all things. It was felt that “even if the naturalorder is unimaginably vast and complex, it is nonetheless possible to understandsomething of its basic constitutive elements and its universal laws. Indeed,such understanding is one of human life’s deepest pleasures.”Throughout the first centuries of our era, the “tree of knowledge” of the OldTestament book of Genesis remained the symbol of sinful alchemic investigations.Alchemists believed that “by eating the forbidden fruit man had gained God’slevel of the knowledge of good and evil.”The Ophites “worshipped the serpent of the Bible as a beneficent being, afterall, didn’t the serpent give man (access to) the knowledge that only God knew?”The tree of knowledge and the serpent became the most revered and cherishedsymbols of alchemists and physicians.The first alchemists were treated as badly as heathens. Their persecution wasinitiated when the art was still centered in Alexandria. The study and practiceof medicine and alchemy occupied buildings next to the Serapeum, the temple ofSerapis.Theophilus, the archbishop of Alexandria, ordered the destruction of the temple,and when he met with local resistance the Emperor Theophilus directed thescholars to retreat and the temple was destroyed. The library of Alexandria,already burnt by rioting Christians under the rule of Caesar, was spared,allowing medical and alchemic practices to continue in the attached museum untilthe murder of the woman-philosopher Hypatia (415 AD). Her death brought paganstudies to an end in Egypt. The persecuted pagan practitioners, physicians, andalchemists fled to Athens.When alchemy first developed in the early centuries after Christ, it was able todraw on the “scientific” achievements of the Ancient World: in the previous 3000years many crafts and processes had become highly organized, and huge volumes ofknowledge and experience had been recorded in many crafts and specialties.Metal work and glassmaking, the culture of dyes, perfumes, cosmetics, drugs,poisons, and chemical-mixing gained sway throughout the world through commercialenterprises and trade.In Egypt, craftsmen created collectables for wealthy customers out of gold,silver, and precious stones. With equal zeal they produced for the greaternumbers of the less wealthy, imitations of gold-hued alloys that were goodenough to pass for gold and colored glass “gems.”In 529 AD Justinian ordered the official suppression of the ancient learning ofmedicine, science, and philosophy. As a result, Pagan culture came to an end,but medicine and alchemy survived by mutating. A major setback was inflictedupon the survivors by Theodosian who created a new law that required that allbooks of alchemy and related medical books be burned publically in the presenceof a Bishop.New followers of alchemy and medicine practiced the beliefs of the “cursed,”blending orthodox religious elements into their doctrines, which made theirpractices favorable in the eyes of the emperors. Stephanus of Alexandriadedicated his Nine Lessons in Chemia to Heraclius, Emperor of the East(575–641AD). An expert in the philosophy of Pathagoras and Plato, yet aChristian mystic, Stephanus made the bridge between medicine and ancient alchemyand the new Europe.Byzantine monks translated and copied ancient manuscripts for centuries tryingto reassemble the wisdom that early fanaticism had destroyed. Nicephorus(758–829 AD) was interested primarily in Greek authors. In the eleventh centuryPsellus restored Platonic writings. The reclaiming of the early medical andalchemic literature brought new followers and devotes, including the “ChristianPhilosopher,” the pseudonym for a monk well versed in the dark practices and whomelded Christian culture and theology with pagan studies, medicine, and alchemy.Women medical authors and alchemists, who had hidden behind pseudonyms to avoidpersecution, became revered practitioners and philosophers.It is thought that the few manuscripts that did survive and were transported toEurope would not have prevented Europe from plunging into ignorance—it was theinvading Arabs that brought the ancient wisdom and practices of medicine andalchemy to Europe.Alchemists state that two principles, the theory of the composition of metalsand that of their generation, served as the heart of their belief system. Theybelieved that metals were alloys of unrelated substances, yet all metalscontained sulphur and mercury, and it was the varying proportions of each onethat determined whether the metal would become gold, silver, copper, tin, orother metals.For instance, gold was supposed to be composed of a large amount of mercury andsmall amounts of sulphur; copper contained equal amounts of mercury and sulphur;and tin contained an imperfect blend of impure mercury and a large quantity ofsulphur.The alchemic students and theorists likened the process of transmuting one metalinto another “to the generation (reproduction) of animals and vegetables”—therefore, “to find the secret to the production of metals it would be necessaryto discover their seed.”The believer of alchemy was fixated on the theory that there was no inorganicsubstance and all substances were alive. They believed that life and itsfunctions were guided by the stars which were continuously moving metals towardsperfection—to gold!From the twelfth century, alchemists had pronounced that for theirtransmutations to reach completion an agent was necessary. The agent had manynames and manifestations, for instance the philosopher’s stone, philosopher’spowder, the great elixir, and the quintessence. When the philosopher’s stonetouched a liquid metal it would be transmuted into gold.Paracelsus describes the philosopher’s stone as solid and dark red; Berigard ofPisa describes the stone as the color of poppies; Raymond Lully stated that thestone was the color of a carbuncle; Helvetius held the stone in his hands andclaimed it was bright yellow; the Arab Khalid wrote, “This stone unites withinitself all the colors; it is white, red, yellow, sky-blue and green.” Is thephilosopher’s stone perhaps an opal?At the age of sixteen Paracelsus entered the university in Basel and is thoughtto have gone to Wurzburg to study with Hans von Trittenheim, a recognizedscholar of magic. When he became twenty-two years old, Paracelsus was employedby the mining school of Sigismund Fugger, a well-known alchemist. Paracelsusthen went on what could be described as an “odyssey” through Germany, Italy,France, the Netherlands, England, Scandinavia, and Russia.At the age of thirty-three Paracelsus was hired to the position of townphysician and professor of medicine. Paracelsus quickly made enemies of the townofficials and physicians by saying, “If you will not learn the mysteries ofputrefactive fermentation, you are unworthy of the name of physicians.” For theremainder of his years Paracelsus wandered through dozens of cities andcountries, writing books and papers in a mix of German, Latin, and made up wordsof his own design. He used the Arabic word for black eye makeup (al-kohl) andused it to describe the spirits of wine, which became the word “alcohol.”Paracelsus created the word “zinc,” and from the German word “all-geist” hecreated the word “alkahest” that is the universal alchemic solvent with thepowers to convert all things into their liquid primary matter. For his own brandof alchemy, primarily designed for healing disease, Paracelsus coined the term“spagyric.”Paracelsus was not alone, however. Another physician by the name of HenryCornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim, who served as a soldier in Germany, traveledthrough France, Spain, Italy, England, and Switzerland, and during his brieflife of 49 years was a professor, courtier, theologian, lawyer, doctor, andalchemist.Agrippa’s philosophy was outlined in The Occult Philosophy (1510 AD), hislegendary book on magic he wrote while in England. His philosophy was that “manis made in the image of God.” He saw God as the whole universe, and it wassimply reason that man then was a miniature replica (a sort of “mini-me”) of theUniverse.Agrippa believed that, just as man’s body was filled with his spirit, “so allmaterial substances are permeated by a Universal Spirit.” He believed thisspirit was very abundant in the celestial bodies and traveled to earth via thestar’s light and energy rays. He believed that various earthly materials such asgems, metals, plants, and animals were under the influence of a particular staror planet. Agrippa also believed the materials were influenced by the “spirit”of that star. He strongly advocated charms of all kinds which would be “worn onthe body bound to any part of it or hung around the neck, changing sickness intohealth or health into sickness . . . When any star ascends fortunately take anherb and a stone that are under that star, make a ring of the metal that iscongruous therewith, and in that fix the stone with the herb under it.”Emperor Rudolf II, the king of Prague, Bohemia, was an enthusiastic alchemist.His laboratory filled two rooms; the equipment included three great furnacesthat were designed to smelt ore, heat a water bath (bain-marie), and distillvolatile liquids and uncountable numbers of glassware, including “glass phials,pewter funnels, hourglass of different sizes, spoons, spatulas, and knives.”The alchemists who were invited to work in this laboratory lived on Olden Lanebetween Saint George’s church and Saint Vitus’ Cathedral. On September 3, 1584,Dr. Thaddeus Hajek, the court physician, received two visitors from England: Dr.John Dee and his assistant Edward Kelley. They arrived to gain support from theEmperor for a Polish count (Albert Laski) who wanted to be king of Poland. Thecount believed the alchemic skills of Dee and Kelley would cause Rudolf tobecome an ally.Early in 1582 Kelley showed up at Dr. John Dee’s house, about the same time asDee had begun his experiments in “scrying” (crystal-gazing) with a crystalsphere and a disc of polished black obsidian that had been brought back fromMexico. Dee called these two objects his “shewstones.” Kelley became a skillfulscryer, and the two spent every spare minute in raising-up visions of spiritsand angels.While abroad, Dr. Dee had been spreading his vision of religion and scientificbeliefs. He was considered one of the foremost thinkers of his age, and hisideas carried considerable authority. Dee’s views, however, were not on the sametrack as those of the Catholic Church, and in the spring of 1586 word came toDee and Kelley that the Church had made the decision to bring charges againstthem. They left Prague and learned later that they had left just in time, as thePope’s representative had accused them of “conjuring and practicing black magic”and had ordered Emperor Rudolf to arrest them and send them to Rome forinterrogation by the Catholic Church.Modern chemistry deals with the structure, composition, and reactive propertiesof elements under different circumstances. Before arriving at a theory orconclusion, a chemist will rerun an experiment many times under exactly the sameconditions, keep reliable records and come to a repeatable conclusion.Until the 16th century, the alchemist’s primary interest in basic elements wasthe ingredients in, and the makeup of, the “philosopher’s stone.” Alchemistswere not motivated to do more investigation as they already had their answer asto the nature of substances. This was primarily Aristotle’s theory of the fourelements, and then in the division of elements into sulfur and mercury or thedivision of sulfur, mercury, and salt of later alchemy. Their belief in amystical, hermetic philosophy, with its ideas of occult sympathies betweenobjects, allowed them to engage in bizarre “occult sympathies between objects,encouraged them to wild flights of fancy and speculation, often on the basis ofa single observation.” As a result, numerous experimental facts and theorieswere recorded by alchemists, but each existed in isolation and rarely was foundto be generally useful.It was Paracelsus who through unintended events began the decline of alchemy andthe march toward modern chemistry. A giant 16th century physician, he put hisarms around both the practical and the mystical aspects of alchemy. He insistedthat the true purpose of mystical alchemy was to develop secret powers withinthe human soul, and the ultimate goal of practical alchemy was to find medicalcures. The followers of Paracelsus regarded these two beliefs as too far afieldfrom their own original training.Many alchemists began to devote more energy to their spiritual growth. Others,happy to be released from the quest to find the philosopher’s stone, beganexperimentation guided by facts, and as a result, they revealed many new basicrevelations. Finally the foundation was put together for the creation of“iatro,” or medical chemistry, and for the science of basic chemistry.Some alchemists believed that the philosopher’s stone was a diamond since it hadattained the “pinnacle of beauty and perfection equal only to that of gold amongmetals and the Sun among planets.” One of the diamond symbols of alchemists wasthe Shameer, a unique diamond that had been snatched from the beak of a roosterbefore it was swallowed. It is said that the Shameer was employed by Moses tocut the precious stones for the priestly Jewish vestments (the ephod) and it isalso thought to be the stone that was used by Solomon for his wisdom.Of all of the precious and semiprecious stones, the star ruby is thought to bethe most magical. It is thought to represent the creative energy of the Sun (thecreator star) and the pentagram (the star of magic). The star of the pentagramhas been employed for centuries to call forth angels, demons, elementals, andspirits.Trautmansdorf claimed to have discovered a bean-shaped philosopher’s stone thatglowed in the dark. This version of the philosopher’s stone was often comparedto the Indian Brahman’s Pentarbe, a magic stone that was viewed by Apollonius ofTyana, who remarked, “In the night time it glowed like fire, for it is red andemits rays; and if you look at it, it smits your eyes with a thousand gleams.And this light with in it is a spirit of mysterious power, for it absorbs toitself everything in its neighborhood.”Through history, the assignment of different jewels to people according to theirbirth date was calculated in relationship to the planet’s influence through theZodiac. Each of the twelve different stones were given to the planets assignedby the birth date. Modern astrology has maintained this tradition and belief ofthe lucky “birthstone.”It was believed that in addition to having the power to transmute metals, thephilosopher’s stone had other mystical benefits. It could cure all diseases andextend life far beyond its natural limits—it was the panacea!The Chinese believed that gold was immortal and when consumed by a human itcould make humans immortal. Their problem was that they had to find or make thewonder preparation of medicine because gold powder could not be absorbed; itcame through the intestinal tract unabsorbed. Therefore they needed to find aprocess to dissolve gold into a “marvelous powder,” which would then be “spreadmistily like wind driven by rain” through the five organs. It was believed thatsuch a powder could only be obtained through an alchemical procedure. Thisuniversal medicine, referred to as “huatan” cured its user of all Earthlymiseries and disease.“Like produces like” is the ancient maxim of magic, meaning the most perfect andimperishable metal will produce immortality and perfection. The Chinesealchemist employed magical formulas to promote his trade, and he looked to thestars for favor and success of his efforts.The West believed, incorrectly, that the Chinese strove to make true gold. Butin reality, the Chinese believed that artificial gold, not true gold, wasendowed with great magical power. They used the mercury ore, cinnabar, andadditional metals. In fact the Chinese consciously intended to make alloys thatappeared to be gold!The Chinese believed it was sufficient to eat meals each day from plates made ofalloys that looked like gold to gain immortality.There is a legend that tells of the great Wei Po-Yang (100–150 AD), who when hewas able to create the true gold medicine, he and his student Yu becameimmortal. Additionally the sage’s dog had eaten the scraps on the plate and hadalso attained immortality.The Chinese aimed only to rejuvenate and attain immortality. The concept of thealchemist philosopher’s gold was not known to the Chinese.Paracelsus, born Phillippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, was aSwiss physician, wandering mystic, and alchemist. He pioneered the use ofchemicals and minerals in medicines. Science journalist Philip Ball reports,“Paracelsus lived from 1493 to 1541—he was a fulcrum of western history, thedawn of the modern age. This was a world where magic was real, where demonslurked in every dark corner, where God presided over all creation, and yet itwas also a time when humankind was beginning to crack nature’s codes and map thegeography of heaven and earth.”Paracelsus is famous for his railing against the ancient ideas of Hippocratesand Galen, both of whom suggested that illness was the result of an imbalance offour humors (liquids): blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. Paracelsus,by contrast, believed that disease resulted from the body being attacked byagents outside the body or by other abnormalities that could be treated withchemicals.In 1527 Paracelsus publicly burned the standard medical texts of the day, whichincluded the works of Galen and Avicenna. This burning of the masters’ writingsand thoughts on a huge log fire, lit by students, “could be viewed as a turningpoint in the history of medicine,” according to author, Hugh Crone. Physiciansof the day had to destroy the very foundations of Galenic medicine, be free toquestion authority, and employ current observations and rational experimentswhile at the same time look for new medicines.One of Paracelsus’s primary ideas was to document the occupational hazards ofmetal works and mining. As a result he is often times referred to as the fatherof toxicology. He wrote, “All things are poison, and nothing is withoutpoison—only the dose permits something not to be poisonous.” He also proposedthe concept of “like cures like,” and that “if a poison caused a disease, thenthe same poison might be used as a cure if administered in the proper dosage andform.” His ideas may have been one of the forerunners of the science ofhomeopathy where, “Like treats Like.”“Faith must take first place among all the other laws of philosophy,” stated aJesuit spokesman in 1624, “so that what, by established authority, is the wordof God may not be exposed to falsity.” The statement was a strict warning torestrict unnecessary speculation: “The only thing necessary to the philosopher,in order to know the truth, which is one and simple, is to oppose whatever iscontrary to Faith and to accept that which is contained in Faith.”While the Jesuit did not name a specific heretic to which the warning wasdirected, his contemporaries would have certainly understood that his remarkswere specifically hurled at the author of a scientific paper entitled “TheAssayer” by Galileo Galilei.Galileo was already in hot water with authorities because he used his ownobservations of the heavens to support the Copernican belief that the earth wasin an orbit around the sun. Galileo had bowed to the authority of theInquisition by pledging to drop his claims supporting the earth’s orbit aroundthe sun. However, his book The Assayer, printed in 1623, revealed that Galileowas unrepentant and continued to preach the dangerous theory.As a follower of Lucretius, “Galileo defended the oneness of the celestial andterrestrial world: there was no essential difference, he claimed, between thenature of the sun and the planets and the nature of the earth and itsinhabitants. Like Lucretius, he believed that everything in the universe couldbe understood through the same disciplined use of observation and reason. LikeLucretius, he sought to work through this testimony toward a rationalcomprehension of the hidden structures of all things. And like Lucretius, he wasconvinced that these structures were by nature constituted by what he called“minims” or minimal particles, that is, constituted by a limited repertory ofatoms combined in innumerable ways.”Galileo had powerful friends of great status and credibility. The Assayer wasdedicated to none other than the highly respected newly-elected pope, UrbanVIII, born Maffeo Barbarini, and who as Cardinal had endorsed Galileo’s researchand theories of the universe.As long as the pope was supporting Galileo, he would be able to pursue hisstellar research. However, the pope was besieged by the Jesuits to restrainGalileo from expressing his heresies. On August 1, 1632, the Society of Jesusprohibited and condemned the theory of atoms. The prohibition in of itself couldnot have initiated a condemnation of Galileo, as The Assayer had been approvedeight years earlier. However, Galileo’s printing of the Dialogue Concerning theTwo Chief World Systems in 1632 gave his opponents the opening that they hadbeen praying for: they promptly reported Galileo’s transgression to theCongregation of the Holy Office which was also known as the Inquisition.On June 22, 1633, the Inquisition published its verdict, “We say, sentence, anddeclare that you Galileo, by reason of the evidence arrived at in the trial, andby you confessed as above, have rendered yourself in the judgment of this HolyOffice vehemently suspected of heresy.” However, because of Galileo’s favor withthe pope he avoided torture and execution, but was sentenced to lifeimprisonment under house arrest.Gradually, hermetic beliefs in the “unity of the cosmos” lost support, andscientists began to look for new theories to embellish or replace Aristotle’sbeliefs. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries alchemists continued to believein the possibility of transmuting base metals into gold. But they were too busy,either with examining their own souls and spiritual pursuits, or with theirlaboratory experiments to chase transmutation; the producing of gold by cookingbase metals became the song of those who wanted to generate wealth or to misleadothers, which was a great departure from the spiritual pursuits of the originalalchemists.Scientific thought from other specialties gradually began to tear apart theposition of alchemy in the 16th and 17th centuries. Francis Bacon, the Englishessayist and scientific philosopher who died in 1626, vigorously supported theproper organization of experiments and accurate recording of data and results sothey could be repeated and confirmed. Open discussions that includedwell-respected scientists and thinkers from all over Europe began to replace themysterious persona of the alchemist.In England in1660, Charles II supported the formation of the Royal Society ofLondon. Robert Boyle, one of the societies original members, was instrumental insetting chemistry up as a science, separating it from the transmutation ofmetals and from the creation of medicines.In 1661 Boyle published the Sceptical Chymist, and in it he dismissed as beingunscientific the Aristotelian theory of the four elements and the alchemist’snotion of the three principles of salt, sulfur, and mercury.In 1669 Hennig Brandt, a German alchemist, had tried to transmute insignificantmaterials into gold—the most noble of metals. Brandt “reasoned that nothingcould be more noble than the human body and materials connected with it.” So“perhaps it would be possible to change something connected with the noble humanbody into the noble metal—gold.”Brandt combined human urine with common beach sand, then heated the mix in anoven. The soft white residue glowed in a dark room and Brandt named it“phosphorus” (Greek for “I bear light”).Boyle procured a sample of Brandt’s phosphorus and began to manufacture it inlarge quantities and sold it throughout Europe. Although Boyle’s scientificinfluence was strong, many continued to embrace Aristotle’s ideas until late inthe 18th century, and in an effort to preserve their theories they retreatedfrom the stage of science to mysticism.A curious manifestation of alchemical mysticism was the story of the Rosicrucianfraternity, a secret order that claimed to hold great powers and to count amongits members the greatest alchemists of two centuries. The total of what is knownof the Rosicrucian fraternity is found in three anonymously published pamphletsthat appeared in Germany between 1614 and 1616. The pamphlets contain thestrange language and symbolism that is employed and embraced by mysticalalchemists.No one was able to determine whether the Rosicrucian brotherhood actuallyexisted, whether it had been created to convey alchemy in symbolic terms, orwhether it was a hoax designed to discredit zealous students of alchemy and theoccult. The pamphlets produced extreme excitement and wild speculationthroughout Europe. Many followers attempted to get in touch with the authors byprinting their own pamphlets in reply. The fever pitch and interest lasted forthe entire 17th century and included highly regarded scientists andphilosophers—even Descartes and Leibniz expended considerable effort in anattempt to reveal the truth.The first pamphlet, “Fama Fraternitatis,” describes the travels of BrotherC.R.C. who is in search of alchemic expertise and wisdom. C.R.C. was generallythought to be an abbreviation for Christian Rosenkreuz, which translates to“Rosy Cross.” Rosenkreuz established himself in Germany and with three othermonks founded the Rosicrucian Order, or Fraternity of the Rosy Cross. The smallfraternity of monks recorded everything C.R.C. had learned the known skills inscience, magic, and the healing arts, and they gradually grew in numbers toeight. They eventually disbanded after pledging to keep the secrets of thefraternity for 100 years.In 1615 the second pamphlet showed up. It was written in the identical alchemiclanguage of the “Fama,” and it encouraged alchemic scholars to join thefraternity, but the pamphlet gave no instructions on how to accomplish thecontact.The third pamphlet, “The Chemical Wedding,” was printed in 1616, and itscontents left no doubt that it was a tool of alchemy. It contained well-knownalchemic symbols and other information that resonated with the Renaissancemagician, including mathematical puzzles, descriptions of unique mechanicaltoys, and the “most strange Figures, and dark Sentences and Speeches.” Manyyears later an eminent German theologian, Johann Valentin Andreae of Wurtemberg,confessed that he had written “The Chemical Wedding” as a schoolboy joke. It wasnever determined whether he was also the author of the two additional pamphlets.Although he had confessed to his joke, many faithful supporters continued tobelieve in the contents of the pamphlets. Many cultists believed that thepamphlets contained coded alchemical and hermetic secrets. Others looked at themas having a deeper purpose through a reformation in science, not unlike theLutheran reformation in religion.The mysterious curtain of alchemical symbolism enabled alchemists to inventtheir individual translations of the symbols and recipes. Some symbols werelooked at as segments of the laboratory process or as steps for the progress ofthe soul, or both. Alchemy employed a wide palate of symbolism, includingastrology, religion, and magic.Alchemists had from the beginning taken every effort to preserve the secrecy oftheir formulas and methods. There was no uniformity in the alchemical language,which frequently employed hundreds of different symbols that might have beenused for a dual purpose, so they could be used to remember stages of anexperiment or a recipe without writing them out.The 17th century was an era of rapid progress in scientific thought anddiscovery; however, numerous pioneers of true science were also solid believersin alchemy. One of the most famous of these was Sir Isaac Newton, who had putforth the “law of gravity.” He spent a considerable amount of time studyingalchemy and the magical nature of the world. His mathematical investigationswere used to confirm his belief in the “mystical harmonies of the Universe.”In addition to Newton, Descartes, who is thought by many to be the father ofmodern philosophy, was seriously interested in alchemy. A more eccentricpersonage having this interest was Johann Rudolf Glauber. Born in Germany in1604, he became a physician and chemist and was a passionate believer inalchemy. He made many valuable observations and discoveries, particularly in thechemistry of wine-making and the science of the distillation of spirits. Whileexamining the chemical content of a healing mineral spring where he had visitedto “take a cure,” he identified the substance as sodium sulfate. He became veryexcited and announced that he had at last found one of the vital constituents ofthe philosopher’s stone. Crystallized sodium is known as “Glauber’s salt.”However, it is used, not as the Elixir of Life, but as a laxative.Thomas Jefferson, a wealthy Virginia plantation owner, possessed five Latineditions of On the Nature of Things by Lucretius with translations of the poemin English, Italian, and French. It was one of Jefferson’s favorite books,confirming his belief that “there is nature alone and that nature consists onlyof matter.”Lucretius contributed to Jefferson’s belief that “ignorance and fear were notnecessary components of human existence,” and Jefferson used the theme of thisancient poem to create a government whose goal was not only to guarantee thelives and liberties of its citizens, but also to guarantee “the pursuit ofHappiness.” The atoms that Lucretius and Epicurius had envisioned hadcontributed significantly to the content of America’s Declaration ofIndependence!On August 15, 1820, the seventy-seven year old Jefferson penned a letter toformer president, John Adams, who was eighty-five: “I feel: therefore I exist. Ifeel bodies which are not myself; therefore, there are other existencies then. Icall them matter. I feel them changing place. This gives me motion. Where thereis an absence of matter, I call it void, or nothing, or immaterial space. On thebasis of sensation, of matter and motion, we may erect the fabric of all thecertainties we can have or need.”“I am” Jefferson penned to a writer who enquired on his philosophy of life, “anEpicurean.” Jefferson believed in atoms!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEWITCHES, SORCERERS, AND MAGICIn many groups around the world, shamans or sorcerers are thought to possess thetwin abilities to hurt or heal, kill or cure.

Then 2,500 years ago, there was a glorious awakening inIonia: on Samos and the other nearby Greek colonies that grew up among theislands and inlets of the busy eastern Aegean Sea. Suddenly there were peoplewho believed that everything was made of atoms; that human beings and otheranimals had sprung from simpler forms; that diseases were not caused by demonsor the gods; that the Earth was only a planet going around the Sun. And that thestars were very far away. This revolution made Cosmos out of Chaos.—Carl SaganCosmos: A Personal VoyageIt is probably part of the human condition that cosmologists (or shamans of anyage) always think they are knocking on eternity’s door, that the final secret ofthe universe is in reach. It may also be part of the human condition that theyare always wrong. Science, inching along by trial-and-error and by doubt, is agraveyard of final answers.—Dennis OverbyeLonely Hearts of the Cosmos: The Scientific Quest for the Secret of the UniverseIn the ancient world of dualism, the powers of light and darkness were believedin and worshipped with the same level of energy. The apparent equal strength ofboth good and evil arose in the minds of humans when man observed the dualism ofnature and compared the opposing forces in his own life.Early man recognized that he was “inhabited” by opposing forces, because inthought and action, good and evil are so tightly connected that he could notalways tell which was which. Additionally, good intentions can oftentimes resultin evil, and criminal thoughts could be a tool of good. Both these observationsseemed to be perennial, and in nature both light and darkness have theirfunction.In the east, good rain falls and promotes crop growth and enhances the land,while in the west destructive rain arrives bringing catastrophic floods. Thesouth wind drives pestilence and fever ahead of itself, while north winds sweepsthe air clean and drives away disease and crop failure.One can understand why primitive men would conjure up good and evil spirits allaround himself. Knowing that theses spirits were there, man would conjure themup, flatter them, tell lies to them, and use every method which he considersfavorable to produce a favorable result and with equal energy to avoid thenegative results. Out of fear of reprisal and disaster men typically paid moreattention to evil spirits. When the hunter failed to bring home meat, thefailure was attributed to evil forces rather than to a lack of skill, speed, orstrength.As civilizations grew, man became more worldly and understood that he hadpersonal strengths and personal responsibilities. The Chaldean star religionpreached that good luck and disaster are not haphazard happenings that dependedupon the whims of good and evil spirits, rather these events are controlled byheavenly bodies that send good and evil according to unimpeachable mathematicallaws.Primitive man believed that he was powerless to fight the desires of thecelestial divinities. Yet as time went on, wise men fostered ethics andself-determination into man’s fate believing the will of the stars could bealtered. Man’s efforts were strangely intertwined with the decisions of thestars and man learned of the give and take between heaven and earth.BELIEF IN MAGIC TO DEFEAT ILLNESSMagic and religion were intertwined into the Egyptians daily life. Evil gods anddemons were believed to be the cause of many diseases, crop failures, andinfertility of humans, flocks, and herds.Egyptian disease treatment and management almost always began with prayers andceremonies that were designed to gain the help and favor of gods and planets.Egyptian healers that were sanctioned by authorities were multi-taskers: theredid not seem to be a clear distinction between priests and physicians. Thehealers, priests of Sekhmet, were expected to use incantations and magic asparts of their therapies.The widespread use of the mix of religion, medicine, and magic by the Egyptiansand other early civilizations, are thought to have developed because of apowerful placebo effect. Those who believed in the treatments and thepriest/physicians capacity to communicate with the gods received pain relief andthe healer-priests were credited with the patient’s recovery and survival.The concentration of the efforts of magic is directly related to the selectionof the spells and remedies used. Selected ingredients were derived from anelement, plant, or animal that had features that looked like or acted likesymptoms or signs of the disease or illness in the patient. This Egyptianconcept was based on the belief that “simila similibus” or “like treats like.”This ancient Egyptian concept has flourished and survived into modern dayhomeopathy. For instance, an ostrich egg shell or the skull bones of a human oranimal would be used to treat a skull injury and an amulet with the likeness ofa hedgehog would be used to treat baldness.Amulets were universally employed by Egyptian priests, physicians, and healersof all callings for magical approaches to healing diseases. These healing andprotective amulets were put into three separate classes: (1) homeopoetic— theseamulets portrayed animals or parts of animals that the owner wanted to gain,including strength, speed, or fertility; (2) phylactic—these amulets (such asthe Eye of Horus) protected against the evil and devastating effects ofdestructive gods and demons; (3) theophoric—these were representations ofEgyptian gods, and they were usually constructed of bone attached to a leatherstrap.In the 7th century BC the king of Assyria, Ashurbanipal, sent his prayer to thestar Sirius:Speak, and the stars may assist thee,Judge, give thine oracle,Accept the raising of my hand, harken to my imprecation.Take away the enchantment, blot out my sin.A spell had been launched against the ruler, who then asked himself whether hedeserved this misfortune because he had committed a sin. The favor of the staris asked for not only to remove the spell, but also to erase the evil deed. Inthis case Sirius is addressed as the messenger of higher gods who will assisthim and whose will he trumpets.It is thought that it was in Ashurbanipal’s time that Zoroaster, the Medianprophet, declared that evil, while powerful and ever present, can be avoided andeventually overcome. Zoroaster clarified the ancient belief in the hosts of goodand evil spirits—rulers of the dualistic universe. He traced these legions backto their origins: Ormazd (Ahura Mazda), king of light; and Ahriman (AhuraMainyu), prince of darkness. The good demons of older traditions were dethronedby Zoroaster. However, since they could not be totally eliminated from commonbeliefs, they were allowed a place in the ranks of evil spirits.Led by Ahriman, these spirits no longer opposed good in chaotic swarms. Thekingdom of evil became organized like that of good. The two armies weremarshaled in battle positions, much like the game of chess where the black andwhite pieces oppose each other in equal strength, and the spirits of good andevil, light and darkness confront each other. Victory in any one battle is notpermanent— the war between good and evil rages for eternity.Not all of the sacred books of Zoroastrianism have been preserved, and only asmall part of the surviving sections can be attributed to Zoroaster’s personalwritings, such as the 17 psalms or Gathas. The rules and laws of worship andsacrifice are from earlier times. Additional books of the Magian cult are thehymns, the daily prayers, and the liturgies. The books called Vendidad,accumulations of anti-demoniac lore, were compiled after the middle of the fifthcentury BC. They contain rituals that are more of a purely magical form; thedogmatic theory and theology of Zoroastrianism is essentially religious.However, the rituals of dealing with demons is magic.In the 17th chapter of the Vendidad there is a prescription devoted to paring ofnails and clippings of hair, which as soon as they are separated from the bodybelong to the evil one as houses of uncleanliness. Hair and nails collected fromthe dead are noted in the fable on the method of Zoroaster for converting theroyal family to the new doctrine and how he thwarted a plot against his ownlife.According to the legend, courtiers had hidden bones, hair, and nails collectedfrom the dead in his room. Zoroaster, accused of wizardry, was condemned todeath by hanging. At the same time the king’s horse fell ill. Its legs hadentered its body. “Free me,” said the prophet, “and I will restore one leg.”Zoroaster’s freedom was granted, and the leg came forth. “Lord,” said Zoroaster,“if thou wilt embrace my creed, I will restore the second leg.” After the King’sconversion, the two remaining legs were also restored, but only after theremaining members of the royal family and the court had become Zoroastrians.Hair and nails, which were used by wizards to conjure up the dead, were thoughtto live “a life apart” from the body. Hair and nails lack the senses ofpressure, heat, cold, and pain and are seemingly dead, yet they grow, and growmore rapidly than the tissues from the body itself. This unusual rate of growthand lack of sensory response led wizards and witches to look at these bloodlesstissues as “individuals” or “parasites” growing upon living beings likeparasitic plants: 1. Zarathustra (Zoroaster) asked Ahura Mazda (Ormazda): O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent spirit, maker of the material world, thou holy one. Which is the most deadly deed whereby a man increases the most baleful strength of the daevas, as he would do by offering them sacrifice? 2. Ahura Mazda answered: It is when a man here below, combing his hair or shaving it off or paring his nails, drops them into a hole or into a crack. 3. Then for want of the lawful rites being observed, daevas are produced on the earth which we call lice, which eat up the corn in the cornfield and the clothes in the wardrobe. 4. Therefore, O Zarathustra, whenever, here below thou shalt comb thy hair or shave it off, or pare thy nails, thou shalt take them away ten paces from the faithful, twenty paces from the fire, thirty paces from the water, fifty paces from the consecrated bundles of baresma (holy twigs). 5. Then thou shalt dig a hole, ten fingers deep if the earth is hard, twelve fingers deep if it is soft; thou shalt take thy hair down there and thou shalt say aloud these fiend-smiting words: out of his pity Mazda made plants grow. 6. Thereupon thou shalt draw three furrows with a knife of metal around the hole, or six, or nine, and thou shalt chant the Ahuna Vairya three times, or six, or nine. 7. For the nails, thou shalt dig a hole, out of the house, as deep as the top joint of the little finger; thou shalt take the nails down there and thou shalt say aloud these fiend-smiting words: The words are heard from the pious in holiness and good thought.Zoroaster’s detailed approach to the handling and disposal of hair and nailsgave support to the importance of these rituals. His support flew in the face ofthose who considered the hair and nail rituals a common superstition. Similarhair and nail rites detailing the handling and disposal of these tissues arefound throughout many primitive cultures, even now in the 21st century.Hair and nails are commonly squirreled away by primitive cultures, or in someinstances brought to sacred sites to be stored or burned, thus preventing themfrom finding their way into the custody of sorcerers who would then employ themas tools to conjure up evil spells to terrorize or kill the original humansource. These beliefs are common amongst many tribes leading to the fear ofbeing bewitched via the spells inflicted on hair and pared nails.It is not uncommon for primitive cultures to cut off the hair of war prisonersbefore they are set free because the hair is held as a “hostage,” a guarantee ofappropriate behavior in the released prisoner. Failure to adhere to the terms ofsurrender results in the punishment of the released prisoner from afar whenpunishment inflicted on the original owner of the hair.Today, in the 21st century, this Zoroastrian belief is followed in Europe. TheAmerica’s Chilean gauchos and the Turks hoard their hair in wall spaces;Armenians hide their shorn hair in churches, hollow trees, and columns; Frenchpeasants who live in the Vosges Mountains bury their hair along with teeth in aspecific hidden location so that these tokens could be reclaimed on the day ofresurrection.In the Irish village of Drumconrath there is a belief that their hairs were allnumbered by the Almighty, and they are expected to have to account for each hairon the day of judgment. The people of Liege, Belgium, are taught to remove eachhair carefully from their combs and brushes to prevent the hair from coming intothe hands of a witch or demon.Zoroaster’s belief that hair and nails could generate insects and other animalswas not original to him. This belief is older than the nation of Iran and wascontinued through the sixteenth century of the Christian era.Women’s hair that had been buried in cattle dung was thought to generate snakes.The Copernican system, published in 1543 by the Polish astronomer NicolausCopernicus, placed the sun at the center of the solar system, overturningprevious belief, not only of the cosmos, but also of man’s station within theuniverse. Prior to Copernicus, the prevailing belief was the Ptolemaic system.In this view of the universe, Earth was at the center and stars were embedded ina large celestial sphere and additional planets were in smaller spheres inbetween.Ptolemy’s system included epicycles, smaller circles in which the planets movedwhile they orbited the Earth, in order to explain the apparent reverse motionthat the planets sometimes exhibited.Copernicus described his system of the heavens by pointing out that the motionsof heavenly bodies are uniform, eternal, and either circular or made up ofseveral circles or epicycles. He said the center of the universe is near thesun, and around the sun, in a specific order, are Mercury, Venus, Earth and itsmoon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. It took 200 years for theCopernican model to replace the Ptolemaic model.In 1603 a French judge, Henri Boguet, published a book on witchcraft thatcontained notes from St. Thomas, who thought that “rotten sticks can(spontaneously mutate and) turn into snakes.” Paracelsus had said, “Nihil estsine spermate,” meaning nothing exists without semen. This old belief ofspontaneous generation survived into the epoch of Leibniz and Newton.“Imperfect” animals such as snakes, bugs, frogs, lice, and flies were thought toreproduce in the presence of “corruption or decomposition” rather than semen.This line of thinking related the apparent spontaneous appearance of theseanimals to a relationship with “infernal powers” rather than a sperm and eggfertilization.Imperfections of human flesh, including birth defects (monsters), wereattributed directly to evil spells directed personally from the devil accordingto Christianity and popular thinking of the times. It was believed that the evilone never appears in a perfect human form: Either “he limps or has a horse’shoof, (thus) betraying his true nature.”“Witches,” says Paracelsus, “give their hair to Satan as a deposit on thecontract they make with him. But the evil one does not waste this hair, for hecuts it up small and mixes it with the exhalation from which he forms hail; thusit has come to pass that we ordinarily find little hairs in hail.”The belief that hair is a refuge par excellence for devilish spells was sharedby the persecutors of witches. Before being dragged to the torture chamber,women thought to be witches had their hair cut off, a practice which caused manya witch to confess to unholy practices even before torture was inflicted.Jean Bodin (1530–96), a French legal expert recorded that in the year 1485,forty witches in northern Italy confessed their “crimes” as a group after havingtheir hair shorn. Bodin noted that Apollonius of Tyana had his locks shorn whenthe Emperor Domitian had him arrested for wizardry. As recently as World War II,in liberated France, as an extension of this ancient belief, women who hadconsorted with the Germans had their hair shaved off by French patriots.In AD 77 Pliny the Elder dedicated his books on natural history to the EmperorTitus, and while recognizing the powerful impact of magic upon many nations inthe past and present, Pliny declared that magicians are “tricksters or fools”whose doctrines were created from the contempt they have for mankind. He claimedthat magic is vanity and nonsense and that humanity was indebted to the Romangovernment for abolishing that monstrous magical rite, the human sacrifice,which was considered to be the ultimate offering to a god in return for favorsand blessings.Pliny claimed that the founder of magic was the Persian, Zoroaster, but ignoredthe fact that Zoroastrians despised human sacrifice. It is interesting to notethat despite Pliny’s scorn for that “invalid and empty” wisdom, his own writingswere heavily impregnated with magical references and followed the Romantradition of praising the benefits of herbs, stones, animals, amulets, andcharms.While raising arguments against magic, Pliny references the Emperor Nero, whohad performed many occult experiments, but none were deemed to be successful.Pliny then notes that the Emperor Tiberius suppressed magicians in Gaul. Infact, many of the Roman emperors were aggressively opposed to magic, and Pliny,an admiral of the Roman fleet, found it of great political value to agree.Nero, whom Pliny lists among the naysayers of magic, was publicly against magicand philosophy, studies that he deemed illegal, saying they were “frivolous andserved as a pretext for those who wished to know the future.” Nero believed thatmagic was dangerous to the government, and in fact it would have been, ifcitizens were allowed to read in the stars the destiny that awaited the rulers.The stars might predict conspiracies. Nero’s wife, Poppaea, had a diviner inresidence in her house staff, and a gaggle of astrologers occupied her privatechambers. And Nero, despite his official public position on magic, stillconsulted magicians in political decisions. The astrologer Babilus read from thestars the names of Nero’s enemies, and based upon these celestial directives,Nero had the enemies rounded up and executed without trial.Tiberius, whom Pliny credits with the destruction of magic in Gaul, oftentimesconsulted with the astrologer Thrasyllus. This astrologer predicted theelevation of Tiberius to the throne. Tiberius, in order to test Thrasyllus’sbelief in his own predictions, had decided to execute the astrologer if hepredicted incorrectly. Tiberius then demanded that Thrasyllus predict his owndestiny, whereupon Thrasyllus declared himself to be in immediate danger.Tiberius then stated, “That is true,” and “the exactness of the prophecyguarantees the one concerning my person.” Tiberius then comforted the tremblingprophet and embraced him.In the book Isis and Osiris, Plutarch (AD 45–126) stated that the Sphinxsymbolizes the secrets of the occult wisdom. He further describes the Sphinx asa “magnificent creature having wings of ever changing hue.” When directedtowards the sun, the wings glitter like gold; when they are turned towards theclouds, they shine with the colors of the rainbow. Yet, with all hisinvestigative skills Plutarch failed to uncover the complete meaning andmysteries of the great Sphinx.For untold numbers of years, the Sphinx stood out as the protector of thesecrets of Egyptian magic. In their desire to learn the secrets of the Sphinx, aparade of Greek philosophers, including Solon, Thales, Pythagoras, Eudoxus, andLycurgus ventured to Egypt to confer with the priests.ENGLISH WITCHESWhen traveling through the eastern counties of England (such as East Anglia,Essex, and others), one can regularly find monuments of the victims of religiousand medical persecutions from the reign of Mary I in the first half of the 16thcentury. During that time 277 who were found guilty of witchcraft and sorcerywere burnt at the stake. The primary objective of the Reformers (religious,royal, and medical) was “the elimination of the practitioners of magic andsorcery.”In the year 1563, The Elizabethan Witchcraft Act was passed into law. This lawimposed the penalty of death for murder by sorcery, and the pillory andimprisonment for non-lethal witchcraft. The first person to be punished afterthe act was enacted was a sixty-three year old woman by the name of AgnesWaterhouse who was hanged in Chelmsford in 1566 for the crime of bewitchingWilliam Fynee to death. Her co-defendant was her “familiar,” a cat named Satan.The first of the victims of this act was like those who followed her, a peasant.The affluent, physicians, and royals were protected by their wealth from beingaccused of witchcraft. The crimes for which the guilty were punished were simple“maleficia,” baleful acts related to the jealousies and vindictiveness ofwitches. The county of Essex became the center of the witch hunt persecutions,with the major numbers of these trials occurring in 1566, 1579, 1582, and 1589.An examination of the old court records reveals that the outbreak of “witchmania” in East Anglia had all of the characteristics of mass hysteria. Theentire book of witch folklore and witchcraft was lodged against the accusedalong with trumped-up evidence.The accusers in the very heart of this conspiracy were the village soothsayers,referred to as Cunning Men and Cunning Women who were witch doctors andphysicians who freely and wantonly denounced their competitors. This had beentheir habit since the beginnings of English history. Originally the punishmentwas limited to ecclesiastical punishment or the drawing of the witch’s blood to“neutralize the spell.” With the state now being the official witch hunter,influential physicians were empowered by the government to give a diagnosis thatguaranteed misery, torture and death to each and every one of the accused.Handbooks for magistrates, including Michael Dalton’s Country Justice (1618),and Richard Bernard’s Guide to Grand Jurymen (1627), noted that the primaryevidence for guilt of witchcraft was the possession of an animal “familiar” (acat, dog, mouse, or other pet). “Bona fide physicians, as fallible as theirunofficial allies, the Cunning People, were generally prepared to diagnose manyof the illnesses that they were unable to cure as caused by witchcraft.”The type of individual to be diagnosed as a witch has been of historicalinterest to the psychiatrist Sir Charles Oman, the historian, who dividedwitches and wizards into four categories: the conscious charlatan, the malignantperson who truly believed they could harm their enemies, the sheer lunatic, andthose who were themselves the victims of torture and duress.One Newmarket woman who believed that her pet toad was a “familiar” spirit wasvisited by Dr. William Harvey, a physician of King Charles I and the originalillustrator of the complete anatomy of the circulation of human blood.Dr. Harvey killed and dissected the toad, thus demonstrating that the toad wasnot cursed with any unusual anatomy or physiology. Harvey was considered to bemany years ahead of his professional colleagues, who were very comfortable inpointing a finger at witchcraft as an “alibi” for diseases inflicted upon theirpatient that they themselves could not cure.FRENCH WITCHESThe appearance of witchcraft in Europe, as it developed in the period of “greatpersecutions,” was found in two different forms. The first was described as“cottage industry witchcraft” which employed spells and potions to perform blackor white magic. The second was framed in the belief that witches were the “shockwarriors” of the devil.The witch was no longer a simple wise-woman, who could produce a healingtreatment charm as well as a poison—the witch (male or female) was now fullydevoted to evil and had consciously joined the corrupted army of Satan.In the beginning of the “age of witches,” the French witch was the most oftenobserved. The age drew heavily on the accusations and incriminations heaped uponheretical sects. The guilt of the witch was confirmed by posing leadingquestions to accused witches and torturing them until a confession wasextracted. The guilty was then required to point fingers at others as witches,who were then questioned and tortured until they confessed.The confessions and the great quantities of information were reported by thepersecutors and a distinct picture of “witch behavior and witch beliefs” wasaccumulated. In a strange way, this notoriety attracted many to let it be knownthat they were witches.A central theme of the new witch religion was the Sabbath, the meeting duringwhich the Devil was worshipped. The first accounts that have survived of thisoccurrence came in 1335 from Toulouse, in the south of France. A woman,Anne-Marie de Georgel, confessed that a “tall dark man, who had fiery eyes andwas clothed in skins, appeared to her while she was washing. He asked her togive herself (sexually) to him and she agreed. He breathed into her ear, and onthe following Saturday, merely by willing it, she was somehow taken to thewitches’ meeting. The meeting was presided over by a goat, which taught hersecret ways to work evil. She had used these secrets ever since and had done allthe harm she could.”Anne-Marie de Georgel stated, “God ruled in heaven and Satan on earth. They wereequal partners, locked in conflict throughout the ages;” however, she believedthat “Satan would soon triumph.”Another woman, Catherine Delort, claimed that “every Saturday she fell into acurious sleep in which she was transported to the gathering of witches. Thereshe worshipped the goat and submitted her body to him and to the other witches.They worked evil by spoiling harvests and killing cattle, and at their meetingsthey feasted on the bodies of babies.”The French magistrate and witch-hunter, Pierre de Lancre, devoted the last yearsof his life to proactively rooting out evidence, “real or imaginary,” ofdevil-worship and witchcraft. He bragged about “having consigned 600 witches tothe flames.” In his Tableau de l’inconstance des mauvais anges (Description ofthe Faithlessness of Evil Angels) published in 1612, he records his personalaccount of his witch hunt in the Basque region of France.The great preponderance of the accusations against witches’ practices andbehavior at the Sabbath had in the beginning been launched against non-Christianheretical sects that were accused of the worship of the Devil and his animalforms (“familiars”), the obscene kiss, the violent hatred of Christianity, thecannibalism of eating babies, and the promiscuous orgy.In the beginning of the fourteenth century even the Knights Templar were accusedof worshipping the Devil by trampling on crucifixes, copulating with demons, andobscene kissing. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries there were varioustrials of important individuals, such as Joan of Arc and Gilles de Rais, inwhich charges of witchcraft were featured and played a part in creating the widespread belief that there were large numbers of witches throughout the land.Everyone knows of Joan of Arc, but few know that she was burned at the stakeafter being found guilty of practicing witchcraft. The opinion of her judges ather trial in 1431 was that “her visions were worthless. They denied her the giftof prophecy, accused her of sorcery, and above all censured the heretical pridewhich induced her to believe that she was answerable only to God and not God’sministers on earth.”When at her trial Joan was charged as a sorceress and a witch, there werevarying accounts of her background, including that she was an illegitimatedaughter of Louis d’Orleans and Queen Isabeau, widow of Charles VI, andtherefore the half-sister of the Dauphin, Charles II. Although there is somedebate as to whether or not these claimed birth rights are correct, it is a factthat the Dauphin gave her a royal coat of arms, an azure shield, and a silversword with gold grip, which carried a gold crown and two gold fleurs-de-lis—anunheard of honor for an “uneducated peasant girl.” It is believed that the truthis that she was the daughter of successful and well-to-do peasants from thevillage of Domremy in Lorraine, close to the border of the kingdom of France,which at that period was the location of Paris and was being marauded andplundered by the English.Joan’s sudden rise to fame was due to her conviction that she alone could“deliver France from the English,” a power which she believed was “divinelyconferred upon her for this purpose.” Joan claimed that strange voices sheidentified as those of St. Gabriel, St. Michael, St. Marguerite, and St.Catherine began communicating with her when she was only thirteen. In the shadeof a “fairies’ tree” she had made a vow of a celibate life. Initially the voicesinstructed her to travel to France, but when the news of the city of Orleansbeing under siege, reached Joan in Domremy, she was then told to rescue thecity.As a small child Joan was told of the kingdom of France that had been lost by anevil Queen Isabeau who had defected to France’s enemies and that a virgin wouldreclaim France. There was another story that originated in the beginning of the15th century that was told to the region’s children: “A soothsayer named Maried’Avignon had gone to the King and told him that the country was about to beravaged by war, but that a maid would come and lead France to victory.”In 1429 Joan asked an officer in command of her area, Robert de Baudricourt, togive her a horse and military escort to go to ask for an audience with theDauphine. After she asked for and received an exorcism from a local priest, theofficer complied. Now armed with an introduction to the Dauphine, Joan travelledacross occupied France to Chinon.Joan was able to pass through road blocks, ambushes, sentries, and highwayrobbers. When she arrived, the court ministers of Chinon were seriouslyconcerned and untrusting of this young woman who claimed she was sent by saintsand angels and God. Joan agreed to be interviewed by an extensive ecclesiasticalassembly at Poitiers, and she passed the test and convinced the clerics.Subsequently, with Charles, Joan declared that she would fight and driveFrance’s enemies from their territory “through the grace of St. Michael.”Charles was sufficiently convinced that he provided Joan with armor and troopsand dispatched her to Tours. Her standard bore the image of the King of Heavenholding an orb with the words “Jesus Maria.” She gathered her troops and headedto join the French army at Blois for the relief of Orleans.Her military campaigns were successful, the siege of Orleans ended, and theEnglish were chased back home; Charles was crowned at Rheims as Joan hadpredicted. The following year Joan was captured and turned over to John ofLuxembourg, the Burgundian commander, who sold her to the English.After two attempts at escape, Joan was sent to the English military facility ofRouen and placed under tight guard in the castle. Joan’s trial for sorcery andheresy began in the year 1431. For political reasons, the English weredetermined that Joan would be convicted and no amount of ransom could save her.Joan was put into the custody of an anglophile Bishop, Pierre Cauchon, who hadasked for the office of judge for personal benefit; he then elected a tribunalthat would guarantee a conviction. The question that the trial was designed toanswer was “whether it was God or the Devil who guided her.”The theologians of the Church, the clerics, and masters of the University ofParis were in agreement that Joan had used witchcraft. It was said that thejudges had proof that “Joan was a magician, a heretic, a schismatic.” It wascharged that the voices she claimed she had heard were the result of herconsumption of mandrake, an herb that produces a narcotic-like substance thatcauses delirium and has magical powers, including the effect of hearing voices,and Joan was known to carry mandrake in her bodice. Her judges insisted that,“her apparitions were in fact infernal spirits, that her voices were satanicinterventions, that her premonitions were witchcraft and that her (successful)battles were diabolical crimes.”The exact charges against Joan was that she was “superstitious, a soothsayer, anidolater, an invoker of devils, a blasphemer against God and his saints.” Theindictment produced a list of “her detestable and wicked crimes and sins asfruits of her proud spirit.” The Inquisition refused to believe that saints hadeither spoken to her or visited her, and they believed that Charles VII’scoronation had been “a work of hell” because Joan had evoked evil spirits. TheInquisition further reported that Joan was perfidious, cruel, and tainted withhuman blood. The University of Paris affirmed that Joan was “a woman of Balial,Satan, and Behemoth.”To all these charges Joan was found guilty of heresy and would be burned at thestake unless she submitted. Totally at a loss because of the verdict andpunishment, she recanted her claims and was given a sentence of prison.Sometime later, Joan recanted her confession and was burned at the stake on May30, 1431, as a “relapsed heretic.” After the fire had consumed her body, theexecutioner was ordered to remove the ashes and expose her charred body. Theexecutioner then cut open her belly and chest and destroyed her entrails. He wascommanded to throw Joan’s heart and her ashes into the Loire to prevent any“miracle-working” pieces to be claimed and used to restore her.During Joan’s trial, only Jean Gerson, Master of the University, had defendedher and declared her innocence. In 1456 eminent judges “proclaimed theinequities of the first trial and Joan’s innocence, reasserted her orthodoxy andadmirable merits, and further annulled the judgment of 1431.”In 1909, almost five centuries later, Joan was beatified, and in 1920 she wascanonized by the Roman Catholic Church. Joan was now St. Joan of Arc! She becamethe only “witch” to ever have been elevated to the level of sainthood.GERMAN WITCHCRAFTDominating the consciousness of witch hunters during the period of the Europeanpersecutions was the belief that it was the God-given duty of Christians to“rescue” heretics and pagans from the unspeakable fate that awaited them afterdeath. Earlier, St. Augustine had stated his position that “not only everypagan, but that every Jew, heretic and schismatic will go to the eternal fire .. . unless before the end of his life he be reconciled and restored to theCatholic Church.”The result of St. Augustine’s public attitude was the creation of a living hellon Earth for thousands people with the purpose of “saving them from the terrorsof hell in the next world.” The terrors inflicted by the persecution wereconsidered to be worse in Germany than in any other part of Europe. Witch trialsbegan in Germany in the mid-fithteenth century with the greatest numbersoccurring after 1570, during the period of the Counter Reformation, when theRoman Catholic Church seriously began to turn back the rise of Protestantism andall forms of heresy and witchcraft.Between 1609 and 1622 more than 300 Germans were executed for practicingwitchcraft in the state of Bamberg alone. The accused were mercilessly torturedwithout concern of age or gender. In 1614 a seventy-four-year-old woman diedwhile “undergoing torments up to the third grade.”Between 1623 and 1632 the German state of Bamberg was described as “the shrineof horror.” This state was ruled by Prince-Bishop Gottfried von Dornheim, afanatical witch-hater who was known as “the Witch Bishop.” He organized anaggressive witch-hunting organization under the leadership of Suffragan BishopFriedrich Forner, who was supported by a council of lawyers. Witch prisons wereestablished; the most ruthless was the Hexenhaus, the “Witches’ House.”Suspected witches were interrogated and tortured in the Hexenhaus, and it isbelieved that at least 600 humans were burnt at the stake after theirconfessions.It was considered mandatory that the accused confess to practicing witchcraft,and all efforts were employed to obtain the confession. Extreme techniques oftorture were employed, including “roasting (the accused) on an iron chair,rending the flesh with red-hot pinchers, crushing the legs, dislocating theshoulders, and applying thumb screws.”It was very dangerous for anyone to question the result of the torture orinterrogation by the court because the friends and employees of the court saw toit that once charged with witchcraft none of the accused would be found innocentand could not avoid being burnt at the stake. The kindly Dr. Hann,Vice-Chancellor of Bambergh, who had demonstrated kindness towards accusedwitches, was himself accused as a witch. By means of torture, he was caused toadmit guilt and name five of his leading burgomasters as “fellow sorcerers.” In1628 the humanitarian Vice-Chancellor, his wife, and daughter were burned at thestake as witches.After the year 1630 the German witch hunt was reduced in scope and intensity. Inthat year Bishop Forner died, and two years later his master, the Witch Bishop,died. The invasion of Germany by Gustavus Adolphus, the Protestant King ofSweden, distracted the efforts of witch hunting to the crisis provoked by theoccupation of Germany by “an arch-heretic on Catholic soil.” By1630 executionsof witches were reduced to 24 and then the next year there were zero.The terrors of German witch hunting were carried out by Protestants as well asRoman Catholics. It is well documented that Benedict Carpzov, a Lutheran,admitted ordering the executions of more than 20,000 confessed witches inSaxony!ITALIAN WITCHCRAFTThe witches of Italy were famous for being masters of their craft and the mostsuccessful of the witch covens of Europe. They inherited the traditions of theRoman and the Etruscan witches and were so successful that even in the 21stcentury they are still a force to be reckoned with in Sicily and the southernportions of the Italian peninsula.La Vecchia (the Old Religion) is the name given to the two branches of what iscalled black and white witchcraft that is still practiced in Italy and Sicily.These forms of Italian witchcraft have their foundations in the practices andbeliefs of the historical colonizers.Greek, Etruscan, and Egyptian practices and ceremonies were folded into thesanctioned Roman religion. Astrology, augury, and divination were consultedbefore official policies were decided upon.Pagan power brokers denounced the “dark side of magic” as fervently as did theInquisition courts. All sorcerers were at risk of being driven from Rome if anaccuser made charges that they were a danger to the state or the emperor byvirtue of their evil powers.Italian witchcraft featured night-time ceremonies designed to conjure up theevil spirits and gods backed by a devil, with the construction of wax likenessesinto which needles were thrust and knots were cinched tight to show paininfliction, sexual failure, and death. And to speed up the evil spirits’ effect,the Italian witches resorted to quick acting poisons. If the Roman courts foundthe accused guilty they would be punished by crucifixion or being fed to thelions in the coliseum.Horace, the classical Roman poet (100 BC), wrote several detailed treatises onthe gruesome practice of black and white magic. Another classic Roman writer,Apuleius (2nd century AD), documented the evil art and craft of gnarled oldwomen in The Golden Ass, the tale of a handsome young man who is tinkering withwitchcraft and through a series of horrible mistakes he is turned into an ass.The two writers gave similar examples and accounts of the horrors of Italianwitchcraft that were described again 1400 years later when those accused ofwitchcraft were tortured, crucified, and burnt at the stake.The Apologia, a second book written by Apuleius, made an effort to separate eviland what was considered beneficial magic of astrology, medicine, and conjuringup spirits to learn details and outcomes of the future. The Roman witch “strix”(nocturnal bird),” “saga” (wise woman),” and “volantica” (night flyer),” werethe earliest forms of the Italian witch called the “strega,” whose terriblepersecutions, crucifixions, and burnings lasted from the 15th to the 18thcenturies.During the early years of Christianity all private magic ceremonies were bannedand public rites were restricted by law to augury. In the 5th century, theOstrogoths (Arian Christians) led by Theodoric invaded Italy and listeddivination as a form of illegal paganism that was punishable by death. In 500 ADsorcerers were chased from Rome under the threat of imprisonment or death. In600 AD the Lombards invaded Italy and rounded up and sold magicians into slaveryregardless of whether or not their magic was beneficent.Many centuries were required to pass before the greater numbers of Italianpeasant farmers totally embraced Christian beliefs and practices. It was a slowprocess to rededicate pagan temples into Catholic cathedrals, and even thenChristianity was considered to be a “veneer” that masked the old witchcraftcustoms. Local priests were often uneducated and not any better informed thantheir congregations. “Evidence” collected by the Inquisitions indicated thatpaganism and Christianity were blended into a “paradoxical faith.”The witch hunts of Europe appeared in Italy in the mid-15th century, with thenorthern states near Germany being the worst affected. The more the Inquisitionlooked and tortured, the more witches it discovered. A Papal Bull put forth byInnocent VIII in 1484 AD set off a plague of rabid Inquisition investigators; inthe following year after its publication forty-one people were burned at thestake as witches.Edwin Smith Papyrus Hysterical reports that in Naples and Rome there soonappeared a church notice that charged, “Witches outnumbered Christianbelievers!” Their followers tended to be the very educated and they frequentlystudied divination and astrology, alchemy, medicine, and astronomy. In 1510, 140witches were burned at the stake in Bresica, and 300 were sacrificed by fire inComo four years later. Outlandish tales circulated that 25,000 attended a blackSabbath near Bresica. Seventy additional witches who had confessed at the handsof the Inquisition were burned in Valcanonica, and an Inquisitor there braggedthat there were 5,000 additional accused witches under investigation.Venetian civil leaders complained because their areas of responsibility werethreatened with depopulation as a result of the Inquisition and witch hunts! Thecivil authority was supposed to carry out the judgment and punishment demandedby the Inquisition. The Inquisition was given the right to excommunicate courtmembers if they did not carry out the sentence of burning, beheading, hanging,or other punishments issued against those found guilty of witchcraft and heresy.The Venetian Council of Ten countered with an “enlightened reply,” saying “Thewitch hunter’s greed for money and property prevented anyone from being foundinnocent and if so many of the ignorant peasantry were in error they had need ofreally good preachers rather than persecutors.”Even in these times two forms of Italian witchcraft could be identified. Thefirst were the wise women who incited love and healing brews, and the secondwere those who resided in the rural reaches, would tell one’s fortune, gatherherbs by moonlight for good and evil, and chant to direct the decisions ofspirits good and evil.In these times high-profile witches, or those who were accused of witchcraft forother’s sinister purposes, were hung or burnt at the stake, while the quiet,peasant wise woman survived in the dark attics of the believer’s homes.According to Man, Myth, and Magic: The Illustrated Encyclpopedia of Mythology,Religion, and the Unknown, edited by Richard Caendish, “Almost more thananywhere else in modern Europe, the people in southern Italy and Sicily stillretain the customs of La Vecchia. The Evil Eye is feared and the phallic signinvoked to destroy its power. Wax hearts and images are stuck with pins, andwise women consulted for charms to make people fall in or out of love, and togain lucky lottery ticket numbers.”AMERICAN WITCHESSalem Witch TrialsThe Salem witch trials were a series of hearings and prosecutions of peopleaccused of witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts between February 1692 and May1693. Despite commonly being described as the Salem witch trials, the initialhearings in 1692 were conducted in Salem Village (Danvers), Ipswich, Andover,and Salem Town.The most horrible of the early trials were held by the Court of Oyer andTerminer in 1692 in Salem Town. According to Robert Calef, who opposed CottonMather and wrote a book denouncing the Salem Witch Trials titled More Wonders ofthe Invisible World, a reporter of the time described the trials this way:And now Nineteen persons having been hang’d, and one prest to death, and eightmore condemned, in all Twenty and Eight, of which above a third part weremembers of some of the Churches of N. England, and more than half of them of agood Conversation in general, and not one clear’d; about Fifty having confestthemselves to be Witches, of which not one Executed; above an Hundred and Fiftyin Prison, and Two Hundred more accused; the Special Commission of Oyer andTerminer comes to a period . . .In 17th century colonial North America, the supernatural was part of everydaylife, and there was a ubiquitous belief that Satan and his evil agents ofwitches, sorcerers, and magicians were everywhere and actively promoting evilevents, such as disease, death, and environmental calamity. These beliefs werebirthed in Europe in the 15th century and then spread to North America as itbecame colonized.Witchraft, practiced as “white magic,” with charms and herbal medicines wereused by subsistence peasant farmers to ensure personal health, fertility oftheir flocks and herds, and successful crop yields. Gradually the practice of apositive and proactive white magic evolved into dark or “black magic,” the formof witchcraft that is associated with demons, evil spirits, and their evil deedsthat by call or command are launched against health, life, herds, flocks, crops,and the land.Between 1560 and 1570, black magic and its various practices were pervasive incolonial America. “Witch hunts,” persecutions, and executions were everydayevents!In Against Modern Sadducism, in 1668, Joseph Glanvill claimed that “he couldprove the existence of witches and ghosts of the supernatural realm.” Glanvill’swritings addressed the “denial of the bodily resurrection, and the[supernatural] spirits.” In his publications he claimed that “ingenious menshould believe in witches and apparitions; if they doubted the reality ofspirits, they not only denied demons, but also the almighty God.”Glanvill wanted to prove that the supernatural could not be denied; he claimedthose who did deny apparitions were considered heretics for it also disprovedtheir beliefs in angels. Written texts and speeches by Glanvill and CottonMather tried to prove to their followers and anyone who would listen that“demons were alive,” which literally produced a mass hysteria in those whobelieved that demons were actively controlling events on earth.Men and women in Salem believed that all of their personal and communitymisfortune was due to the evil works and spells of the devil. When infant death,crop failures, and revolution involving church congregations occurred, they wereblamed on people who were thought to be practicing witchcraft or black magic andconspiring with evil forces.Before the constitutional upheaval of the 1680s, the government of Massachusettshad primarily been filled with and dominated by Puritan secular leaders.Puritans, influenced by Calvinism, opposed many of the ceremonial traditions ofthe Protestant Church of England, including the Book of Common Prayer, the useof priestly vestments of caps and gowns during services, the use of the HolyCross during baptism, and kneeling during the sacrament—all of which constituted“Popery.”Hostile policies of King Charles I and active repression by Anglican Churchofficials of these dissenting non-Anglican views accelerated in the 1620s and1630s, resulting in a mass migration of Puritans and other religious minoritiesto North America.The new immigrants established many colonies in New England, of which theMassachusetts Bay Colony was the largest and most economically viable.Self-governance fit their philosophy of life because building a self-governedcolony based on their religious beliefs was their priority. Their communityleaders were elected by the freemen of the members of the church, whosereligious beliefs were formally examined, and then they were formally admittedinto a Puritan congregation of the colony. The colonial leadership tended to bewell thought of members of their Congregations, and were known to consultregularly with the local ministers on the important issues that would confrontthe colony.In Salem Village, as in the main colony, daily life was directed by the preceptsof the church, which was Calvinist in the extreme. Music, dancing, andparticipation in holiday celebrations of Christmas and Easter were absolutelyforbidden, as they supposedly had their roots in paganism.The only music allowed in the colonies was the unaccompanied singing of hymns.Even in the 17th century, the folk songs of the day glorified love and nature,and were therefore thought by believers to be against God. Toys, especiallydolls, were forbidden and were universally considered frivolous and a waste oftime.Schooling of children was limited to religious studies and Bible literacy. Allmembers of the colony were expected to attend three-hour sermons every Wednesdayand Sunday at the community meeting house. Village life centered on the meetinghouse where sanctioned meetings and events took place.Prior to 1692, there had been reports of witchcraft swirling through neighboringSalem Village and other towns. Cotton Mather, a well-known minister of Boston’sNorth Church (not to be confused with the later Anglican North Church of PaulRevere fame), was a prolific writer of pamphlets and a loud trumpeter ofwarnings of witchcraft.In his book Memorable Providences Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions(1689), Mather describes his “oracular observations” and how “stupendouswitchcraft” had affected the children of Boston mason John Goodwin. Matherillustrates how Goodwin’s eldest child had been tempted by the devil and stolelinen from the washerwoman Mary Glover.Glover was an unhappy old woman whom her husband had often described as a witch.This is perhaps a contributing factor to why she was accused of casting spellson the Goodwin children. After the initial witchcraft accusation, four of thesix Goodwin children began to have strange behaviors, or what some observersreferred to as “the disease of astonishment.”The symptoms of the afflicted Goodwin children included neck and back pain,feelings as though their tongues were being drawn from their throat, and loudunpredictable screams. Other noted symptoms included their bodies becoming limp,bird-like flapping of their arms, attempts to inflict self-harm, and actions toinflict physical pain on others.The children were brought to the local physician, namely one Dr. William Griggs,who declared that he could not heal the children, as “their afflictions were dueto the spells of witchcraft!” It was Dr. William Griggs’ pronouncement anddiagnosis of “witchcraft as being the cause of the Goodwin children’safflictions” that would fuel the Salem craze of witch hunts in 1692.A short time later in Salem Village, in the winter of 1692, nine-year-old BettyParris and her eleven-year-old cousin Abigail Williams, the daughter and nieceof the Reverend Parris, began displaying signs of “fits” described as “beyondthe power of Epileptic Fits or natural disease” by John Hale, a minister fromnearby Beverly.The afflicted girls screamed, uttered strange sounds, threw dishes around theroom, crawled under furniture, contorted themselves like pretzels, andcomplained of being pinched and pricked by pins. Again, Dr. William Griggs,recorded this, saying that he “could find no physical evidence of any disease”and declared the cause of the girl’s afflictions to be witchcraft!The first three people to be accused and arrested as witches and charged withafflicting the young patients Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, twelve-year-oldAnn Putnam, Jr., and Elizabeth Hubbard were Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, andTituba (who was a slave).Sarah Good was a local homeless beggar; Sarah Osborne rarely attended church andwas considered to be unworthy because she married an indentured servant; andTituba was a slave who was a fortune teller who led young girls astray bytelling them of enchanting stories of Malleus Maleficarum (evil spells). Allthree of these women fit the description of “usual suspects” for witchcraftaccusations and no one came forward to defend them.By May 1692 accusations of witchcraft began to pour into Salem Villageauthorities. Up until that point, the proceedings and arrests were onlyinvestigative. However, on May 27,1692, William Phips ordered the establishmentof a Special Court of Oyer and Terminer for Suffolk, Essex, and Middlesexcounties to prosecute the cases of those in jail.Many methods were employed to gain confessions of participating in witchcraftfrom those accused, including making a “witch cake.” The cake was made from ryemeal and the urine of the victim of witchcraft or sorcery, and then was fed to adog; when the dog ate the cake, the witches themselves would feel pain andscream out. The concept of the “witch cake” was based on Cartesian “Doctrine ofEffluvia,” which stated that witches afflicted their victims by means of“venomous and malignant particles that were ejected from the eye.”Another test based on effluvia, and used to identify a witch, was the “touchtest” from the Old Testament and was used again in Andover in September 1692. Ifthe accused witch touched the victim while the victim was having a fit or someform of attack and the fit ceased, that meant that the accused was the witch whohad afflicted the victim.Other evidence included the confessions of the accused (even confessionsextracted through torture), the testimony of a person who had confessed to beinga witch identifying others as being a witch, the finding of books of palmistryand horoscopes, or pots of ointments or healing herbs in the home of theaccused, and the discovery of a “witches teat” on the skin of the accused in theform of a mole or blemish that was insensitive to touch.Warrants were issued for thirty-six more people, with more examinations forsigns of witchcraft (including torture) taking place in Salem Village. When theCourt of Oyer and Terminer convened at the end of May, the number of thoseaccused of witchcraft and in custody had risen to sixty two!In August grand juries indicted George Burroughs, Mary Eastey, Martha Corey, andGeorge Jacobs, Sr., and trial juries convicted Martha Carrier, George Jacobs,Sr., George Burroughs, John Willard, Elizabeth Proctor, and John Proctor.Elizabeth Proctor was given a temporary stay of execution because she waspregnant. On August 19, 1692, Martha Carrier, George Jacobs, Sr., GeorgeBurroughs, John Willard, and John Proctor were executed.In September, grand juries indicted eighteen more people. On September19, 1692,Giles Corey refused to plead at arraignment, and was subjected to peine forte etdure, a form of torture in which the subject is pressed beneath an increasinglyheavy load of stones, in an attempt to make him enter a plea. Four pled guiltyand eleven others were tried and found guilty of witchcraft.On September 22, 1692, eight more were executed, “After Execution Mr. Noyesturning him to the bodies, said, ‘what a sad thing it is to see Eight Firebrandsof Hell hanging there.’”Because of the long duration and widespread nature of the Salem witch hunts andtrials, the historical and contributing factors of these mass hysterias areworth investigating.Historian Clarence F. Jewett included a list of people executed in New Englandin The Memorial History of Boston: Including Suffolk County, Massachusetts(1630–1880). He wrote:The following is the list of the 12 persons who were executed for witchcraft inNew England before 1692, when 24 other persons were executed in Salem, whosenames are well known. It is possible that the list is not complete; but I haveincluded all of which I have any knowledge, and with such details as to namesand dates as could be ascertained; 1647–Margaret Jones, of Charlestown, atBoston. 1648–Mary Johnson, at Hartford, 1650–Henry Lake’s wife, of Dorchester.1650–Mrs. Kendall, of Cambridge. 1651–Mary Parsons, of Springfield, at Boston.1651–Goodwife Bassett, at Fairfield, Conn. 1653–Goodwife Knap, at Hartford.1656–Ann Hibbins, at Boston. 1662–Goodman Greensmith, at Hartford. 1662–GoodwifeGreensmith, at Hartford. 1688–Goody Glover, at Boston.On February 21, 1693, Governor William Phips said:When I put an end to the Court there were at least fifty persons in prison ingreat misery by reason of the extreme cold and their poverty, most of themhaving only spectre evidence against them and their mittimusses being defective,I caused some of them to be let out upon bayle and put the Judges uponconsideration of a way to relief others and to prevent them from perishing inprison, upon which some of them were convinced and acknowledged that theirformer proceedings were too violent and not grounded upon a right foundation...The stop put to the first method of proceedings hath dissipated the black cloudthat threatened this Province with destruccion; . . .When the Salem witch hunts had ended 150 had been accused, 62 had beenimprisoned, 19 had been executed by hanging, 4 died in prison and oneeighty-year-old man had been crushed to death by stones over a four day periodfor refusing to enter a plea.The precipitating event that produced, what is perhaps the most horrible exampleof a mass hysteria in America, was the pontification of Dr. William Griggs, whodiagnosed the strange behavior and afflictions in eight Puritan girls and youngwomen as “bewitchment, the result of witchcraft.” Because of the religious andpolitical environment that pervaded New England at the time, Dr. Griggs’diagnosis of witchcraft had the same effect as yelling “fire in a crowdedtheater.”A rational explanation for the appearance of symptoms of the “victims” of witchcraft in New England is the contamination of stored grains with ergot, theexotoxin of a mold that causes constriction of vascular muscles resulting in thelack of oxygen in the brain as well as other tissues.Historically, the consumption of grains, particularly rye, and breadscontaminated with the fungus called ergot (“cockspur” or Claviceps pupurea)resulted in convulsive and gangrenous symptoms produced by the exotoxin lysergicacid diethylamide (LSD). Diluted tinctures of cockspur (ergot) were used byalchemists and early physicians to speed up child birth and stop postpartumbleeding.The initial infestation of ergot in the seed head of grain causes the flowers toeject a sweet, yellow-pigmented mucus (“honey dew”), which contains the fungalspores that then spreads the infestation. The growing fungus then invades thedeveloping grain with a web of filaments that become a purplish-black sclerota.Sclerota are usually thought to be large hypercolored grains of rye.The sclerota contain ergot alkaloids, including lysergic acid (the source ofLSD) and ergotamine, often used as a treatment for migraine headaches. Thealkaloids have a direct effect on the central nervous system and producecontraction of smooth muscle in the vascular system and the internal organs.It is well documented that consuming ergot-contaminated food will produceconvulsions, severe muscle spasms, vomiting, delusions, hallucinations, and“creepy crawlies” under the skin (formication), all of which were reported inthe victims of the accusers of the Salem witchcraft trials.Ergot will proliferate in warm, damp, and rainy spring and summer weather— thesewere exactly the environmental conditions recorded in Salem in 1691. All of theaccusers lived in the western part of Salem Village, an ecosystem of swampymeadows that would be a perfect breeding ground for ergot. At the time, rye wasthe staple grain of Salem residents. The rye crop would have been consumed inthe fall and winter of 1691–1692—just when the accuser’s victim’s symptoms werereported. The summer of 1692 was dry, which is thought to be the explanation forthe sudden end of the “bewitchments.”Symptoms included painful seizures and spasms, diarrhea, paresthesia (itchingand prickling), formication (a feeling that ants are crawling under the skin),vomiting, mania, psychosis, hallucinations, headaches, vertigo, and tinnitus.Dry gangrene is the result of vasoconstriction induced by theergotamine-ergocristine alkaloids produced by the fungus.The gangrene is caused by the effects of ergot on the most poorly vascularizedstructures of the body including ears, fingers, and toes. Advanced symptomsinclude desquamation or peeling of the skin, weak peripheral pulse, peripheralneuropathies, edema, and total loss of affected tissues.The earliest references to ergotism in 857 AD are found in the AnnalesXantenses: “a Great plague of swollen blisters consumed the people by aloathsome rot, so their limbs were loosened and fell off before death.”In 944 AD, in southern France 40,000 people died of ergotism. In the MiddleAges, the gangrenous plague was called “ignis sacer” (“holy fire”) or “SaintAnthony’s fire.” The 12th century writer, Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois,reported the mysterious outbreaks in the Limousin region in France, where thegangrenous form of ergotism was associated with the local Saint Martial as muchas Saint Anthony.GEORGIA WITCH HUNTIn 1977, while working as a pathologist at the Yerkes Primate Research Center,Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, Wallach discovered the first non-humancase of cystic fibrosis in a young rhesus monkey.Wallach’s findings were confirmed by experts in the field of cystic fibrosispathology; the experts included Dr. Robert Beale, an MD who would later becomethe director of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.When Wallach announced that cystic fibrosis was not a genetic disease, butrather a congenital deficiency of the trace mineral selenium in the embryo orearly postnatal life, Wallach was summarily terminated in April of 1978 from hisposition at Yerke’s without the ability to defend his observations as would bethe case for a PhD candidate.In 1978 Wallach was hired by St. Louis University to be the Director of theLaboratory Animal Research colony in the medical school. However, after learningof his termination from the Yerkes facility by Emory University and the NIH, hewas summarily terminated before he even moved into his new offices.In June 2, 2005, an article appeared in the International Laboratory AnimalResearch Journal (ILAR Journal) by W. R. Morton and K. Swindler titled“Serendipitous Insights Involving Nonhuman Primates”:CYSTIC FIBROSISEmory University (1978) reported that “a classic textbook case” of cysticfibrosis as found in humans had been identified in a nonhuman primate, an animalin which the disease had not been described previously. An assistant veterinarypathologist (whose name {Wallach} was withheld by Emory) unexpectedly discoveredthe disease during the routine autopsy of a 6-month-old male rhesus monkey thathad died of unknown causes. The diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. Victor Nassar, anEmory pediatric pathologist at Atlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital, and by Dr.John Easterly, a pathologist at the Chicago Lying-in Hospital and nationalauthority on cystic fibrosis. The monkey, one of a group being studied for thespace program, instead provided the first nonhuman primate model of cysticfibrosis.Nevada Witch HuntIn July of 2011 Wallach and Ropp sent several case reports of children that hadrecovered from muscular dystrophy (by following Wallach’s diet and supplementalprotocol) to Jerry Lewis Productions in Las Vegas, NV. The case reports showedvery clearly that a nutritional supplement program and a special diet hadreversed the symptoms of MD in several children.Wallach and Ropp contacted Lewis through his personal assistant Violet andalerted him of the fact that a probable “cure” for muscular dystrophy had beendiscovered. They did not ask for money, but rather had asked if Lewis would liketo be the one who made the announcement that a major breakthrough had beendiscovered that could resolve the childhood plague muscular dystrophy at last!Lewis became excited, took the data to the medical committee of the MDFoundation. After Lewis insisted that they give serious consideration toWallach’s and Ropp’s claims, Jerry Lewis was fired by the MD Foundation.Jerry Lewis’s personal assistant Violet confirmed that “If it were up to Mr.Lewis he would continue to participate in and host the Muscular DystrophyTelethon.”North Carolina Witch HuntFollowing the publication of the Flexner Report (initiated in 1914 by theRockefeller Institute and Andrew Carnegie Foundation to determine which group ofdoctors and healers to support and which ones to “deep six”), an endless “witchhunt” had been perpetrated against the alternative healers in America by themedical associations at the city, state, and federal levels—the purpose being“to cleanse America of all medical competition of the M.D. medical system byalternative healers.” A classic example of the medical witch hunts in Americawas the trial of a Wise Women by the name of Belle Howard.In 1992 Wallach was recruited to be an expert witness for the defense in abizarre trial that was a 20th century witch hunt. The defendant was afifty-something wise woman, an herbalist by the name of Belle Howard. Howard wascharged with twenty-three felonies including murder, practicing medicine withouta license, and fraud, etc.Wallach had been recruited by a defense attorney, William Moore of Savannah,Georgia, who was also a medical doctor who was famous for his successfuldefenses of alternative healers and doctors of all philosophies.Wallach had been recruited by the defense for his skills as an investigativecomparative pathologist. The government’s contention was that “Howard hadtreated a military veteran for cancer two years before his death and that hertreatment had kept him away from life-saving medical procedures that he shouldhave gotten from the VA hospital and as a result he had died unnecessarily froma treatable cancer.”Upon arrival in Fayetteville, NC, Wallach was presented with a letter that waswritten on state letterhead from the state medical examiner claiming that thepatient had died from a treatable cancer. Wallach immediately requested thewritten autopsy report, tissue slides, and tissue chemistry results that hadbeen collected from the patient’s autopsy. In addition, Wallach requested theterminal VA hospital admission records for the patient.The judge sent a state trooper to collect all of the requested material andrecessed the trial until the appropriate papers and materials were collected andreviewed by Wallach on behalf of the defense.A cursory look at the tissue slides and a review of the treatment records showedthat the patient did not die from a “treatable cancer,” but instead had diedfrom the complications of poly-pharmacy and flagrant drug overdoses.If the VA medical doctors had just buried the patient and signed the deathcertificate with the cause of death listed as cancer no one would have paid anyattention. But the opportunity “to get rid of a thorn in their side” was toogood to pass up. They could get rid of this little old wise woman who wasdissing them— by blaming the patient’s death on the herbalist!The medical community thought that they were going to get a “two-fer” bydeflecting blame from themselves and at the same time getting rid of theherbalist!When the prosecuting attorney called his expert witness, the state medicalexaminer, he asked the usual questions, including “is this the autopsy report,did you do the autopsy on the deceased, patient, etc.When the medical examiner was turned over to Moore, the defense attorney, thewitness was presented with a copy of the PDR (the Physician’s Desk Reference)that Wallach had prepared for this very moment.The PDR was marked for the seven drugs that had been used to treat the patientduring his terminal admission. Each drug was ear-marked and the warningshighlighted. Moore asked the medical examiner to state the name of the drug,what it was typically used for, and read the contents in the high-lighted blackbox warnings.After complying with Moore’s request through the first two marked prescriptions,the medical examiner caught on to the direction of the questioning. Wallach hadrecognized that the seven drugs used to treat the patient should not be employedat the same time: four were pain relievers and three of the drugs weresedatives.The black box warnings stated that each of the drugs used to treat the patientshould not be concurrently employed with the others because of an additiveeffect which could be fatal to the patient.By the third marker the medical examiner understood that he was being used toexpose the wrongs of his colleagues. He stood up in the witness stand, slammedthe PDR on the judge’s bench, and declared, “I will not read any more from thisbook!The judge banged his gavel in anger and said loudly, “Sir, you will sit down andanswer Mr. Moore’s questions or I will hold you in contempt of court.” Themedical examiner sat down and through his tears and sobbing he read the rest ofthe marked and highlighted pages out loud to the jury.The jury deliberated for only a day and found Belle Howard innocent of alltwenty-three felony charges. The potential for a national “witch hunt” againstalternative healers had been derailed.Montana Witch HuntIn November 2012 Wallach was in Mizzoula, Montana, giving one of his 300 peryear free lectures when the “witch hunt” mentality raised its ugly head again.Wallach was being interviewed live by Peter Christian on local station KGVO(Town Square Media), to promote Wallach’s lecture in Mizzoula that evening.During the interview, a man identifying himself as Dr. ****** called in andsaid, “Put Wallach on the line,” apparently believing he was on a one-to-onephone connection with Wallach rather than live on the air. He said, “I am Dr.*******. I am the anesthetist for the ****** surgical group in Mizzoula, and Iam telling you, Wallach, not to show up in our emergency room unconscious,” towhich Wallach responded, “Sir, are you threatening to kill me?” At that momentone of his staff alerted the doctor to the fact that he was on an open, liveradio show and he hung up (the radio station refused to give up the disc of theinterview to the Wallach team).Washington Witch HuntIn February 2013 Wallach was in Walla Walla, Washington, giving yet another freehealth lecture. At the meeting that night, one attendee alerted the team to thefact that a local, well known pastor, during his Sunday sermon, had admonishedhis flock not to attend Wallach’s lecture as it was quackery and intended todefraud them.Several days later on Friday, February 22, 2013, in the Walla WallaUnion-Bulletin, Dr. Don Casebolt (for the Union-Bulletin) wrote:Doctor’s visit raises quackery questionsDr. DON CASEBOLTFor THE UNION-BULLETINYou can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all ofthe time, but you can’t fool all of the people all of the time. This littlejingle came to my mind as I thought about Dr. Joel Wallach’s visit to WallaWalla scheduled for earlier this week.I first heard of Wallach some twenty years ago while living in Farmington, NM. Ihad learned about his book (and audio cassette tape) Dead Doctors Don’t Lie, andbecause I was intrigued by the title I bought a copy. After perusing the book itwas my opinion that he was-either ignorant of current scientific evidence or hewas deliberately ignoring it.By the time you read this, the meeting already will have taken place, but I wantto take the opportunity to write for two reasons.One is that some people may have left his meeting convinced that they needed tobuy the product or products he promotes. The second reason is to alert folks tothe existence of the website Quack-watch, which is devoted to debunking falsemedical claims.One of Wallach’s claims is that the average age at death of doctor is 58. I knewthat was not true from reading the obituary column in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association for a number of years. Not only that, but I knewfrom my own medical school class that a significant number of my medical schoolclassmates are still alive, and we all are over 80 years old.In a presentation by Wallach I accessed while preparing for this column, I heardhim say that he had done 3,000 autopsies on humans. He is a veterinary doctorand a naturopath. I know of no hospital or mortuary in this country that wouldallow either veterinarians or naturopaths to do autopsies on humans.In the same presentation, he quoted from the U.S. Senate Document 264, whichwould have been entered during the 74th Congress, second session, in 1936.Following are portions of that document: The alarming fact is that food nowbeing raised on millions of acres of land that can no longer contain enough ofcertain minerals are now starving us—no matter how much we eat. No man of todaycan eat enough fruits and vegetables to supply his system with the minerals herequires for perfect health because his stomach isn’t big enough to hold them.Laboratory tests prove that fruit, vegetables, grains, eggs and even the milkand meats of today are not what they were a few generations ago—it is bad newsto learn from our leading authorities that 99 percent of the American people aredeficient in these minerals.What Wallach failed to mention—could that have been deliberate?—was thatalthough this was in the Congressional record that the information did not comefrom any governmental research.It was originally printed in a 1936 issue of Cosmopolitan magazine and wasinserted in the Congressional record by a Florida senator.It is my understanding that members of Congress are free to have things they areinterested in inserted in the Congressional minutes. It needs to be emphasizedthat just because something has been entered in the Congressional minutes doesnot mean that it is official, that it represents governmental approval or thatit represents good scientific studies.The Quackwatch article on Wallach mentions a number of other statements he hasmade, such as that he has cured Alzheimer’s disease in pigs. Or that 50 percentof Americans 70 years old have Alzheimer’s disease. (The true figure is muchlower in that age group.) Or that facial wrinkles and gray hair are caused bycopper deficiency.From my knowledge of Wallach, it appears he did not come to Walla Walla for hishealth but because he has products to sell.One of the things he sells is colloidal mineral water. Someone needs to ask himto provide references from respected scientific journals that show the benefitsof colloidal mineral water.A number of other companies are peddling these waters. Most of them come fromshale deposits in Utah. One of these companies is reportedly grossing $3 millionper month. This makes it sound like plenty of people are buying in to thepropaganda these companies publish. There have been reported adverse effectsfrom using those waters.As a final note, a question has been raised about ethics. It seems quiteappropriate to me for someone to ask Wallach how ethical it is for him topromote products that have not been scientifically been proven.On Friday March 1, 2013, Wallach responded in the Union-Bulletin to Casebolt’squackery accusations with a rebuttal article entitled “Dead Doctors Don’t Lie!”(which is reprinted with permission by the Union-Bulletin):DEAD DOCTORS DON’T LIE!Dr. Casebolt’s arrogant attitude (being part of a protected monopoly) permeatesAmerica’s thinking. Dr. Casebolt should look in the mirror and ask himself—“Howmany people did I kill during my career?”On Tuesday February 26, 2013, Fox News Service reported the results of a JohnsHopkins study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association thatrevealed that: “Each year in America, medical doctors make 190,000 diagnosticmistakes in their private practices resulting in the deaths or serious injuriesof 150,000 patients.”In his Walla Walla Union-Bulletin article, Dr. Casebolt is fixated on Wallach’s1993 Dead Doctors Don’t Lie audio cassette which noted that based on 200 JAMAobituaries American medical doctor’s average age was 58 years. However, he failsto note that a follow-up study published in numerous medical journals in 1999 bymedical doctors, noted that “the average age of medical doctors in America was56 years.”Dr. Casebolt, questions that Wallach had done 3,000 autopsies in humans because“He is a veterinary doctor and a naturopath.” Again Dr. Casebolt’s attitude isthat only medical doctors have the right to pursue the truth. As a graduatestudent in comparative pathology at the University of Missouri, while still aveterinary student, Wallach had participated in more than 200 human autopsiesand thousands of animal autopsies. In one study through The Center for theBiology of Natural Systems (funded by the National Institutes of Health),Wallach as a postdoctoral fellow, did more than 20,000 autopsies (17, 500 inmore than 454 species of zoo animals and 3,000 humans under the watchful eye ofDr. Malcom Peterson, the pathologist for Barnes Hospital, School of Medicine,Washington University in St. Louis. The results were published in the book(1983: W.B. Saunders) The Diseases of Exotic Animals (a 1, 200 page referencebook that is housed in the Smithsonian Institute as a “National Treasure”).In another study Wallach did 1,700 autopsies on human children under the age of10 years in Keshan Province China. “Keshan Disease” is a simple deficiencydisease of the trace mineral selenium resulting in death by hypertrophiccardiomyopathy (sudden heart death). The purpose was to see if any of thesechildren were also afflicted with cystic fibrosis, a disease long thought to begenetically transmitted by the medical system. Wallach, however, had discoveredthe first non-human case of cystic fibrosis in primates (1977) at the YerkesPrimate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. Wallach was firedsummarily after Emory University had proudly announced the discovery (confirmedby experts in CF pathology) without being allowed to defend his findings whichwere confirmed by pancreas and liver biopsies in same aged cage mates.Wallach’s crime was that he stated that the evidence showed clearly that cysticfibrosis was a disease of nutritional deficiency of the trace mineral seleniumin the embryo or suckling infant (Wallach, J.D., Germaise, B.: “Cystic Fibrosis:A Perinatal Manifestation of Selenium Deficiency.” In: Hemphill, D.D. (ed):Trace Substances in Environmental Health XIII. University of Missouri Press,Columbia.1979. pp. 469-476).The Wallach Keshan study (1,700 human autopsies) demonstrated that 35% of thosechildren dying of Keshan Disease (a known selenium deficiency disease) hadpancreatic and liver lesions consistent with cystic fibrosis (Wallach, JD, Lan,M., Wei Han Yu, Bo-Qi Gu, Feng Teng Yu, Goddard, RF (1990): Common denominatorsin the etiology and pathology of visceral lesions of cystic fibrosis and Keshandisease. Biol Trace El Res. 24:189-205.)Dr. Casebolt also dissed Wallach’s reference to U. S. Senate Document 264 whichwas an agricultural report that was entered into the congressional record of the74th Congress, second Session, 1936 and did not represent “that it is official,that it represents government approval or that it represents good scientificstudies.” Medical doctors have little or no training in nutrition. Wallach is agraduate of the School of Agriculture from the University of Missouri, Columbia,Missouri (1962) and his major was in animal husbandry and nutrition.In April 16, 2012, the journal Food Chemistry, a very well respected researchjournal that looks at the nutritional levels and pollution loads in samples ofAmerican food crops, reported that “well known baby foods and infant formulasmay contain less than 20% of the required minerals and micronutrients (vitamins)required by infants.” In contrast, dog food, laboratory rat pellets, chickenfeed and livestock feed contains 100% of the animals nutritional requirements.Wallach received the 2011 Klaus Schwarz Commemorative Medal (an internationalaward previously only awarded to medical doctors and PhDs, Wallach is the firstveterinarian and first naturopathic physician (ND) to receive the award), andaccording to the awards committee for the Biological Trace Element ResearchInstitute: “From a historical perspective, Wallach is to be regarded as one ofthe first practitioners, if not founders, of epigenetics, the new researchdiscipline that investigates heritable alterations in gene expression caused bymechanisms other than changes in DNA sequence.”Wallach also noted in DDDL that Alzheimer’s disease could not be genetic becauseresearch reported in 1992 by the Salk Institute and UCSD demonstrated that“supplementation with only vitamin E demonstrated measureable improvement inadvanced Alzheimer’s patients.” Wallach followed this research release with thestatement, “Therefore, Alzheimer’s disease could not be genetic, forsupplementation with a vitamin cannot change how a true genetically transmitteddisease manifests itself.”In a ten-year double blind, randomized “Gold Standard” study released in 2004 byJohns Hopkins School of Medicine, they report that by “supplementing withvitamin C and E and following a strict diet one can reduce their risk ofAlzheimer’s disease by 78 percent.” By contrast, in a study reported in 2012, byfollowing the current medical approach to Alzheimer’s disease, the expertspredict that the number of cases will triple to 18.3 million by 2050. In 2012the FDA also released warnings that the use of statin cholesterol-lowering drugsincreased the risks of Alzheimer’s disease and type 2 diabetes—hardly atestimony to the theory of genetic transmission of Alzheimer’s disease.Dr. Wallach has cured (in one week) a case of dementia/Alzheimer’s disease thatwas diagnosed by a primary care physician and confirmed by neurologicalspecialty clinics and the head of the department of neurology in the MedicalSchool of North Carolina. A patient had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s diseaseeight years before his sister called Wallach and asked for help (he was terminalat that point and being prepared for hospice).Wallach always treats all four forms of dementia diagnosis simultaneously as 65%of the time the doctors get the wrong diagnosis—in this case the pateint wasdiagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease; however, he was afflicted with Korsakoff’ssyndrome, a disease of a single vitamin deficiency (thiamin B1) first diagnosedand solved in the late 1700s by a Japanese naval surgeon. Because mega doses ofthiamine were included in the treatment, the patient was cured in a week—if hehad continued to treated only with Alzheimer’s drug programs he would have diedof “the complications of Alzheimers”!Dr. Casebolt proudly touts “The Quackwatch article on Wallach” that dissesWallach’s statements that wrinkles and gray hair are caused by a copperdeficiency. It is well documented that copper is a required nutrient andcofactor necessary for the healthy production of red blood cells, thyroidhormones, skin and hair color, and production and maintenance of healthy elasticfibers in the skin, blood vessels, and other internal organs.Many common diseases are caused by a copper deficiency, including anemia,goiter, loss of skin and hair color (vitiligo), spider veins, varicose veins,hemorrhoids, aneurysms, wrinkled skin, tendonitis, BSE (mad cow disease,Cruitsfeld Jakob disease), and others.“Quackwatch,” aka “Committee against medical fraud” is a private grouporiginally established by four arrogant medical doctors for the purposes ofpreventing chiropractors and naturopathic physicians from competing with medicaldoctors. They want you to believe they are a government agency, but they arejust a bunch of guys who as part of a protected monopoly decided over a glass ofwine to harasses their competition. Two of the original four founders, VictorHerbert, MD and John Renner, MD are dead. Only Dead Doctors Don’t Lie!Dr. Casebolt further states, “it appears he (Wallach) did not come to WallaWalla for his health but because he has products to sell.” In fact Wallach givesthree hundred to four hundred free lectures on health each year, and has beendoing two hours of interactive radio on health Monday through Friday fornineteen years. The programs pay for the caller’s telephone calls with toll freenumbers. Wallach receives no monies from the sale of any of the nutritionalproducts. His sole purpose is to educate Americans to be able to prevent andeliminate diseases in humans through nutrition that the medical communitybelieves, falsely, are genetically transmitted.Dr. Casebolt states, “Someone needs to ask him to provide the references fromrespected scientific journals that show the benefits of colloidal mineralwater.” Wallach has had 75 peer-reviewed and refereed journal articles publishedon the deficiencies of these nutrients, has been the co-author of no less thanfour multi-author textbooks on trace minerals and rare earths and another book,Rare Earths: Forbidden Cures, which is the final word and the ultimatecollection of references on colloidal minerals and the diseases that result fromtheir deficiencies.Lastly, Dr. Casebolt states that “One of those companies (that sells colloidalminerals) is reportedly grossing $3 million per month. This makes it sound likeplenty of people are buying in to the propaganda these companies publish. Therehave been reported adverse effects from using those waters.”In a September 2012 the highly regarded Institute of Medicine reported that $750billion (3/4 trillion dollars) in medical financial waste per year is a fact andthat 30 cents of each medical dollar paid to American doctors each year is forfraud and unnecessary treatment—only DEAD DOCTORS DON’T LIE!In 2012 Wallach entered into an agreement with Clemson University’s Institutefor Nutraceutical Research. Clemson University is one of the nation’s mostprominent and respected academic institutions. The Institute of NutraceuticalResearch (INR) is the national leader in nutritional research and one of itsmissions is to provide consumers greater confidence in product quality, safety,and efficacy.With over 100 scientists working in various fields of medicine, nutrition, andscience, INR is focused on using its vast knowledge base, innovation and cuttingedge technology, and experience to accurately assess the value of variousingredients and nutraceuticals.For over 17 years, Youngevity (a Wallach founded company) has continued atradition of excellence and innovation with its Nutraceutical products bycommitting itself to research and science. Its core message of “90 For Life,”developed by world-renowned scientist and researcher, Dr. Joel Wallach, hasresonated with and enhanced the lives of millions through itsclinically-supported philosophy of the correlation of specific nutrients tooverall health and wellness.Working closely with the field’s most notable biochemists, medicalprofessionals, nutritionists, and government organizations such as the Food andDrug Administration (FDA), Youngevity has pioneered the use of nutrition andsupplementation to aid in the support of health and defense of the body’s mostdebilitating health concerns.In study one (LTB4 and PGH2 test-pro-inflammatory response in human cell lines):Taking healthy human cell lines to stimulate their differentiation/the BeyondTangy Tangerine and Ultimate Classic (two liquid colloidal mineralmulti-vitamin/mineral products) to examine two inflammatory responses,Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and PGH2; these are indicators of inflammatory response.Results: When Beyond Tangy Tangerine and Ultimate Classic were administered tohealthy human cell lines, they did not induce or create any inflammatoryresponse in levels above and below the recommended dosage.In study two (IL-6 AND RAW 264.7 Test – Protection from Inflammation) IL-6 is animmune system modulator. It signals the body to respond and protect itselfagainst inflammation. When there is a presence or heightened presence of IL-6,the body is thought to be in a protective and shielding response toinflammation. Beyond Tangy Tangerine and Ultimate Classic were administered andlevels of IL-6 production was examined.Results: Beyond Tangy Tangerine induced and increased the levels of IL-6 whenthere was no inflammation in the body, heightening the body’s protectiveresponses to possible inflammation. At various concentrations above and belowthe recommended dosage, Beyond Tangy Tangerine induced a protective response byreleasing levels of IL-6 in the body. The Beyond Tangy Tangerine response wasmore significant than the Ultimate Classic response.USA TODAY WITCH HUNTThe June 19, 2013, USA TODAY headline reads “Identify and protect yourself fromquackery” and the reporter, Liz Szabo quotes Dr. Arthur Caplan, the head of thedivision of bioethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, “Manypeople fall victim to charismatic quacks when they’re at their most vulnerableand desperate, because they or a loved one are seriously ill.” If a Doctor“really had cured thousands of people, then they all ought to be at aconvention,” Caplan says.“If someone says that the mainstream is trying to hide this from you, thatshould be read as ‘I’m a crook,’” Caplan says.Dr. Paul Offit, Chief of Infectious Disease at the Children’s Hospital inPhiladelphia says that, “Little known risks, (are) posed by some forms ofalternative medicine, a loosely regulated industry that includes everything fromherbal supplements to crystal healing and acupuncture.”Offit should look in the mirror and ask himself how many infections that causedeath and extra days of hospital stay occur each year in his hospital simplybecause of the poor technique and failure to wash hands and properly sterilizeinstruments by his staff.In June of 2013 a study by the University of Wisconsin stated that “The peopleof Philadelphia County had the best medical facilities available in America;however, the people of Philadelphia county had the worst health of any county inAmerica.”Individuals like Caplan are the reason people seek out “alternative” forms ofhealing. Caplan is ignorant and a dangerous protector of the medical monopolybecause he has the credibility of a physician. As recently as ten years ago itwas unethical for medical doctors to advertise. Today medical doctors, clinics,hospices, and hospitals advertise in newspapers, magazines, radio, TV, andbillboards with the abandon of a used car salesman. Each year, according to aFebruary 5, 2007 issue of the USA Today newspaper that quoted the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association and the federal Centers for Disease Control inAtlanta, Georgia, medical doctors “kill, injure and infect 15 million Americansin hospitals and clinics.”According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of theInspector General, a 2008 report titled “Adverse Events in Hospitals: NationalIncidence Among Medicare Beneficiaries,” by Daniel R. Lenson, Inspector General,November, 2010 (https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-09-00090.pdf[https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-09-00090.pdf]) gives statistics on“adverse events,” meaning harm to a patient as a result of medical care such asan infection associated with the use of a catheter. The finding was that 13.5percent of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries experienced adverse events duringtheir hospital stays and an additional 13.5 percent of Medicare beneficiariesexperienced events during their hospital stay that resulted in temporary harm.The report said physician reviewers determined that 44 percent of adverse andtemporary harms events were clearly or likely preventable. Therefore medicaldoctors were responsible for an estimated 1.5 percent of Medicare beneficiariesexperiencing an event that contributed to their deaths, which projects to 15,000senior patients each month (180,000 per year), possibly included the deaths ofAndy Rooney from 60 Minutes, Dick Clark from American Bandstand and NeilArmstrong, America’s top astronaut.According to the CDC, medical doctors infect 2 million people each year alone inAmerican hospitals of which 90,000 die; according to the FDA (in 2007) adverseevent reports for nutritional supplements (herbs, vitamins, and minerals)totaled 600 and for the same year adverse events reports for prescription drugstotaled 483,000; according to the March 2012 issue of the monthly AARP Bulletin,medical mistakes in hospitals kill 6,000 patients each month (72,000 per year)alone from simple mistakes.Dr. Wallach was fired from the Yerkes Primate Center in 1978, after discoveringthe first non-human case of cystic fibrosis, because he said he could reproducethe disease at will as it was a simple nutritional-deficiency disease ratherthan a genetically transmitted disease as was generally thought. Wallach was notallowed to defend his findings; rather he was summarily terminated by EmoryUniversity. As a result, hundreds of thousands of American kids with cysticfibrosis have died unnecessarily.Jerry Lewis was fired as the national spokesman for the Muscular DystrophyFoundation’s annual telethon because he brought Wallach and Ropp’s data on curedmuscular dystrophy kids to the medical committee and insisted on a seriousreview of the data. THEY FIRED JERRY LEWIS!!!In 2013 Todd H., a 24 year old man, joined Dr. Wallach’s nutrition system of 90nutrients plus extra selenium. Todd had been diagnosed with muscular dystrophywhen he was three years old. After one year on the nutritional supplementprogram, Todd was able to double his physical muscular output as documented onfilm on the Defying Muscular Dystrophy web site.Prior to employing Dr. Wallach’s nutritional program, Todd, his mother, and hisuncle (who also was in a wheel chair as a muscular dystrophy patient) hadstarted a not-for-profit organization called, Defying Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).The purpose of the organization was to look at programs that could help musculardystrophy patients and disseminate information to help others.The DMD had already raised $50,000 to do an FDA approved study for an electricalmuscle stimulator that could perhaps improve muscle strength for musculardystrophy patients.Dr. Wallach gives 300 free lectures to the general public each and personallytakes no professional fees of any kind, or revenues from any sales of hisnutritional formulas. (Does Dr. Arthur Caplan work for free?) Wallach’s formulasare based on billions of dollars-worth of double blind, randomized gold standardanimal and human research.At 74 years old, Dr. Wallach continues to fight for the American people andtheir right to have choices in health care by educating Americans for free thatthey do have economical, safe and effective treatment options to dangerous,expensive, and ineffective medical treatments and by eliminating the protectedmedical monopoly the American public will be better off. The age-old tool of“witch hunts” employed by the medical system to “burn their competition at thestake” must end!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURPHYSICIANSWithin a few centuries of (Hippocrates) death, his writings and teachings becameindiscriminately mixed with those of his followers and other Greek physicians .. .. The thread that bound the Hippocratic Corpus together, was the convictionthat health and disease are strictly natural phenomena—no gods need apply. Ascivilizations rose and fell over the next fifteen hundred years, the kernel ofmedical knowledge passed from the Greeks to the Romans, from the Romans to theMuslims and from the Muslims to medieval Europe.—Robert AdlerScience journalistIn 4000 BC Sumerian physicians recorded a method for a “urinalysis” on claytablets, and in ancient India “physicians” were able to diagnose what we referto today as diabetes because the affected individuals urine “tasted sweet and towhich ants were attracted.”The ancient Egyptian term for doctor or physician is “wabau.” This title, wabau,has a long history. The earliest known “physician” was Hesy-Ra. He practiced inEgypt and was the “Chief of Dentists and Physicians” to King Djoser, who reignedin 2600 BC.The lady Peseshet (living around 2400 BC) is considered the first recognizedwoman doctor. She is thought to have been the mother of Akhethotep, and on astela dedicated to her in his tomb she is referred to as imy-r swnwt, which hasbeen translated as “Lady Overseer of the Lady Physicians” (swnwt is the feminineof swnw).There were many specialties, ranks, and limits in the field of Egyptianmedicine. Royalty employed their own swnw, even their own specialists. Therewere doctor inspectors, overseers, and chief doctors. Known ancient Egyptianspecialists are ophthalmologist, gastroenterologist, proctologist, dentist,“doctors who supervise butchers,” and inspectors of liquids (testing fluids forpoisons). The ancient Egyptian term for proctologist, neru phuyt, translates to“shepherd of the anus.”The ancient Egyptians used flax-linen fiber and animal fiber (shreds of tendons)to suture wounds as early as 3000 BC.The first reported artificial eye was dated back to 2800 BC. The eye wasdiscovered in a six-foot-tall woman in the “Burnt City” in ancient Iran. The eyeis hemispherical in shape and is made of tar mixed with animal fat. Its surfaceis covered with a thin veneer of gold, engraved with a circular iris and goldlines patterned to mimic the sun’s rays. It is thought that the woman was aprophetess and the eye was designed to glitter and give her special powers.Studies of the eye socket showed that the artificial eye was worn for thewoman’s lifetime.Ayurveda is a traditional medicine that is thought to have originated on theIndian subcontinent about 2000 BC during the Vedic Period of India. Ayurvedadeveloped over thousands of years; however, the compendiums Charaka Samhita andSushruta Samhita, and a later compendium of the physician Bhela, are made up ofthe earliest information related to diagnosis, therapy, diet, and general healthrules. Ayurveda, a Sanskrit word, translates as “the science of life,” and thesystem employs herbs, spices, alchemy, oils, massage, yoga, and meditation.Egyptian medical papyri are ancient Egyptian texts written on papyrus totransmit a set of accepted medical procedures to all physicians of the time. Thepapyri give observations and collections of information deemed valuable andeffective by the author. The papyri give details on specific diseases,diagnostic signs and tests, and remedies ranging from magical spells, amulets,herbal medicines, and surgeries.Medical knowledge in ancient Egypt enjoyed an excellent reputation world-wide.Rulers of distant empires of Africa, Europe, and Asia would ask the Egyptianpharaoh to send their finest personal physicians to treat and heal their lovedones. Egyptians had the most advanced knowledge of human anatomy. In themummification process the priests and technicians who preserved the mummieslearned how to insert a long hooked implement through the nostrils to breakthrough the thin skull bones of the brain case and extract the brain, andthrough the left groin they were able to remove the intact organs of theabdominal and thoracic cavities.Egyptian physicians were aware of the pulse and the connection of the beating ofthe heart and the pulse. The original Egyptian author of the Smith Papyrus knewof the “cardiovascular system,” but he thought it was unimportant to distinguishbetween blood vessels, tendon, ligaments, and nerves. Egyptian physiciansdeveloped their theories of “channels” that transported air, water, and blood tothe body by creating analogies with the River Nile. If the river were to becomeblocked, the crops, land, and livestock would all suffer—so if a person wasunhealthy one of the therapies they would use was a laxative to unblock the“channels.”In addition to prayers to the gods and kindly spirits, the Egyptian physiciansrecommended that one could stay healthy by practicing good personal hygiene.This included the washing of the body and the shaving of hair, including thehair of the head, body, and under the arms.Surgery of some form was a common practice of Egyptian physicians for repairingphysical injury. They recognized three categories of injuries: treatable,contestable, and untreatable.Trauma deemed to be treatable was corrected quickly. Contestable injuries werethose from which the patient could survive without surgery, so those put in thiscategory were initially observed, and if the patient survived, surgical attemptscould be performed for functional or cosmetic reasons at a later date. Surgeonsof the day used knives, hooks, drills, forceps, pincers, scales, spoon, saws,and a vase with burning incense to fend off evil spirits.Circumcision of males was the norm in ancient Egypt, as illustrated by Herodotusin his Histories. The uncircumcised cultures were frequently noted in writings,and the uncircumcised Liberians were frequently referenced, and those soldierswho returned from military campaigns would routinely bring home uncircumcisedphalli as trophies. The only known depiction of the procedure in The Tomb of thePhysician, the burial site of Ankh-Mahor at Saqquarra, shows adolescents oradults, not infants, undergoing the procedure.Prosthetics, including artificial toes and eye balls, were commonly constructedand used; typically they were more for cosmetic reasons than function. Inpreparation for burial prosthetic parts were used to replace those lost duringlife.The common practices of surgery, mummification, and autopsy for medical andreligious practices brought the Egyptians a vast knowledge of human anatomy andorgan function. The function of most major organs were correctly surmised andrecorded. Blood was correctly described as a transportation medium for vitality(oxygen and food) and waste (carbon dioxide). The exception to these correctobservations of organ and tissue function was the heart and brain, whosefunctions were switched.Dentistry was an important field of medicine in Egypt, and as an independenthealth profession dates back to 3000 BC. The Egyptian diet was typically high inabrasives because of the milling process of grains used in bread making. Between4000 BC and 1000 BC the degree of worn teeth significantly declined because ofimprovements in the milling equipment.All mummified Egyptians have teeth in poor states of anatomical health. Dentaldisease could have direct or indirect participation in the individual’s cause ofdeath. Djedmaatesankh was a musician from Thebes who died at the age ofthirty-five from extensive dental disease, including abscessed teeth.The Instruction of Ankhsheshonq contains the maxim “There is no tooth that rotsyet stays in place.” There are no documents that show the procedure for thesurgical extraction of teeth, nor are there any known Egyptian instruments thatwould be required to remove teeth. Dentures have been found; however, it is notclear if they were used during life or if they were used only for after deathcosmetics. Pain would have been reduced by means of opium topically applied orswallowed as pills.ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MEDICAL TEXTSKahun Papyrus, called the Kahun Gynecological Papyrus, is dated back to 1800 BC.It is thought to be the oldest medical text. It was discovered at El-Lahun byFlinders Petrie in 1889, translated by F. Griffeth in 1893, and published in ThePetrie Papyri: Hieratic Papyri from Kahun and Gurob. The papyrus containsthirty-five separate paragraphs relating to women’s health issues, includinggynecological diseases, fertility, pregnancy, and contraception.Ramesseum Papyri consists of seventeen individual papyri that were found in thegreat temple of the Ramesseum. The text concentrates on diseases and examinationof the eyes, gynecology, paediatrics, muscles and tendons.The Berlin Papyrus is the largest study of the Egyptian medical papyri and wascarried out by Berlin University and entitled Medizin der alten Agypter(Medicine of Ancient Egypt).The Greater Berlin Papyrus, also known as the Brugsch Papyrus (3038 BC) wasdiscovered by Giuseppe Passalacqua. It consists of 24 pages and is very similarto the Ebers Papyrus. It was later sold to Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia(1827) along with other antiquities for the Berlin Museum. The Greater BerlinPapyrus was translated into German in 1909.The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus is the oldest known surgical document (1600BC). It is named for the Egyptian archeologist who purchased it in the 1860s. Itis written in the ancient Egyptian hieratic script and it contains procedureswritten from more than1000 years earlier. It is the only surviving copy of partof an ancient Egyptian textbook on trauma surgery. The document consists oftwenty two pages (17 pages on the recto and 5 pages on the verso). Forty-eighttrauma cases are examined, each with a detailed description of the physicalexamination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. An extremely important featureof the text is that it demonstrates that the heart, large blood vessels attachedto the heart and liver, liver, spleen, kidneys, ureters, and bladder were allfamiliar anatomy to the Egyptians.Imhotep, thought to be the first physician named, is credited with theauthorship and content of the papyrus. However, the papyrus is thought to be theresult of the combined efforts of many people.The Ebers Papyrus was also purchased by Edwin Smith in 1862. It gets its namefrom Georg Ebers who purchased the papyrus in 1872. The text itself dates backto 1550 BC and consists of 700 remedies (most of which are plants) on 110 pagesand stretches 20 meters in length, making it the longest of the Egyptian medicalpapyri. The Ebers Papyrus covers many subjects including migraine headaches,dermatology, gastrointestinal and digestive diseases, mental disorders,dementia, depression, parasites, tumors, trauma, dentistry, and gynecologicaldiseases—and it makes many references to treating some diseases with religiousincantations and spells.Specific remedies from the Ebers Papyrus include:Aloe vera – burns, gastric ulcers, skin disorders and allergiesBasil – heart remedyBalsam Apple (Apple of Jerusalem) – laxative and liver stimulantBayberry – diarrhea, ulcers and hemorrhoidsCaraway – soothed digestion and breath freshenerColchicum (Citrullus colocynthus) – also known as meadow saffron, was used forrheumatism and reducing swelling and inflammationDill – employed for its laxative and diuretic propertiesFenugreek – prescribed for respiratory disorders, to cleanse the stomach andcalm the liver and pancreasFrankincense – prescribed for sore throat, larynx infections, to stop vomiting,and stop bleedingGarlic – was prescribed for the Hebrew slaves as a tonicLicorice – used as a mild laxative, expectorant, and to relieve chest andrespiratory problemsOnion – taken as a prevention for colds and cardiovascular ailmentsParsley – prescribed as a diureticThyme – prescribed as a pain relieverTurmeric – prescribed for open woundsPoppy – prescribed for pain, anesthesia and insomniaCoriander – prescribed for urinary complaints and cystitisPomegranate root and skin of the fruit – prescribed for “snakes of the belly” ortape worms; the alkaloids in the pomegranate paralyzed the worms and they couldthen be expelled.Persian henna – prescribed for hair lossThe Hearst Papyrus was sold to the Hearst Egyptian Expedition in 1901. It isdated at 2000 BC. The Hearst Papyrus was published for the general public in1905; however, controversy still surrounds the authenticity of this papyri. Thetext concentrates on treatments for urinary system diseases, blood diseases,hair and scalp issues, and bites of insects and vermin.The London Medical Papyrus is located in the British Museum and dates back tothe reign of Tutankhamun. Its text focuses on the treatment of diseases by meansof magic spells and incantations.The Carlsberg Papyrus is the property of the Carlsberg Foundation. Its textfocuses on the diseases of the eyes and pregnancy.The Chester Beatty Medical Papyrus is named after Sir Alfred Chester Beatty whodonated nineteen separate papyri to the British Museum. The remedies noted inthese texts are devoted to magic as a therapy for headaches and analrectalafflictions.The Brooklyn Papyrus focuses specifically on snake, scorpion, and tarantulabites and how to treat the venoms. The Brooklyn Papyrus is housed in theBrooklyn Museum.Bloodletting (the practice of extracting blood from a patient to cure or preventa disease) has been one of the most common medical practices for more than 2,000years. A drawing from an ancient Egyptian tomb (1500 BC) shows an example ofleeches being applied to a patient for the purpose of bloodletting.The ancient practice of bloodletting enjoyed a widespread geographicalpopularity including places like ancient Mesopotamia, the Egyptians, Greeks,Mayans and Aztecs, and India (during ancient Ayurvedic medicine).The practice of bloodletting became even more popular after the time of theGreek philosopher and physician Galen, who taught Hippocrates that diseasesoccurred because of an imbalance of four humors (body fluids) of blood, blackbile, yellow bile, and phlegm. Galen made complex prescriptions relating to howmuch blood should be withdrawn related to the patient’s age and symptoms, theweather, and so forth.In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the barber surgeons performedbloodletting with “great enthusiasm,” and physicians bled patients at everyopportunity. An exceptionally large volume of blood was withdrawn from PresidentGeorge Washington by his physician as the treatment for a sore throat, thusaccelerating the onset of his death. The practice of bloodletting was stillwidely used into the twentieth century and was recommended by thehighly-regarded Canadian physician William Osler in the 1923 edition of hismedical textbook.Medical scholars trace the origins of Western medicine to what was considered a“radical movement” in ancient Greek society, when Hippocrates and his followersfirst separated the art of doctoring from the practices of witches, magicians,and priests. A century before, the “Father of Surgery” emerged from the East.The Indian physician Sushruta (600 BC) describes cataract surgery in his bookSushruta Samhita (Treatise of Sushruta) in which he uses a curved needle to pushthe diseased lens back into the eye and to the side to move it out of the lineof focus. The eye could no longer focus the image from all directions;nevertheless the operation was life changing and provided for the return of somevision.Hippocrates, born on the Greek island of Kos in 460 BC, may or may not havepersonally written the early Greek texts of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, itis clear from these manuscripts that some physicians of the period werebeginning to insist that disease be attributed to natural or material causes,such as to the patient’s environment, diet, or daily habits rather than divineintervention.One text, On the Sacred Disease, specifically excludes mystical influences inepilepsy, which the Greeks had looked at as a strange affliction that reflectedsome divine curse or power, instead of understanding the seizures simply as adisease of the brain.For the first time, the Hippocratic physicians attributed thoughts and feelingsto the brain. They urged careful and close observations of individual patients,as well as low risk conservative and gentle therapies that were designed toaugment the body’s own healing and restorative powers. Works of surgery doappear in the large Hippocratic corpus, amassed between 400 and 100 BC, and thusmany of the Coan School were not bound to this code. Hippocrates himself couldnot have been the sole author of the oath.The Hippocratic movement also demanded a high level of professionalism ofdoctors, a code that was to become a center piece of the legendary HippocraticOath (430 BC). According to Hippocratic Codes, doctors were to seek to supportand never to harm their patients; doctors should be honest and well kept,protect the privacy of the houses that they enter, and avoid any type ofcorruption— including sexual relations with patients.Below is an English translation the original Hippocratic Oath and covenant:I swear by Apollo Physician and Asclepius and Hygieia and Panaceia and all thegods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will fulfill according tomy ability and judgment this oath and this covenant:To hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live mylife in partnership with him, and if he is in need of money to give him a shareof mine, and to regard his offspring as equal to my brothers in male lineage andto teach them this art—if they desire to learn it—without fee and covenant; togive a share of precepts and oral instruction and all the other learning to mysons and the sons of him who has instructed me and to pupils who have signed thecovenant and have taken an oath according to the medical law, but to no oneelse.I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to myability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice.I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make asuggestion to this effect. Similarly I will not give to a woman an abortiveremedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art.I will not use the knife, not even on sufferers from stone, but I will withdrawin favor of such men (barbers) as are engaged in this work.Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for benefit of the sick, remaining freeof all intentional injustice, of all mischief and in particular of sexualrelations with both female and male persons, be they free or slaves.What I may see or hear in the course of the treatment or even outside of thetreatment in regards to the life of men, which on no account one must spreadabroad, I will keep to myself holding such things shameful to be spoken about.If I fulfill this oath and do not violate it, may it be granted to me to enjoylife and art, being honored with fame among all men for all time to come, if Itransgress it and swear falsely, may the opposite of all this be my lot.The early Greek physicians were more likely to be craftsmen and traveling“healers” than priests and the organized Hippocratic medical theories increasedthe likelihood of a successful outcome of their therapies. The Hippocraticapproach was really good nursing care rather than priestly prayers to acelestial god begging for favor in return for a sacrifice.In On Decorum, Hippocrates writes:Between wisdom and medicine there is no gulf fixed; in fact medicine possessesall the qualities that make for wisdom. It has disinteredness, shamefastedness,modesty, reserve, sound opinion, judgment, quiet, pugnacity, purity, sententiousspeech, and knowledge of the things good and necessary for life, selling of thatwhich cleanses, freedom from superstition, pre-excellence divine. What they (thepatient) have, they have in opposition to intemperance, vulgarity, greed,concupiscence, robbery, shamelessness. This is knowledge of one’s income, use ofwhat conducts to friendship, the way and manner to be adopted towards one’schildren and money. Now with medicine a kind of wisdom is an associate, seeingthat the physician has both these things and indeed most things . . .In fact it is especially knowledge of the gods that by medicine is woven intothe stuff of the mind. For in affections generally, and especially in accidents,medicine is found mostly to be held in honour by the gods. Physicians have givenplace to the gods. For in medicine that which is powerful is not in excess. Infact, though physicians take many things in hand, many diseases are alsoovercome for them spontaneously. All that medicine has now mastered it willsupply thence. The gods are the real physicians, though people do not think so.But the truth of this statement is shown by the phenomena of disease, which areco-extensive with the whole of medicine, changing in form or in quality,sometimes being cured by surgery, sometimes being relieved, either throughtreatment or through regimen. The information I have given on these matters mustserve as a summary.. . . As all I have said is true, the physician must have at his command acertain ready wit, as dourness is repulsive both to the healthy and to the sick.He must also keep a most careful watch over himself, and neither expose much ofhis person nor gossip to laymen, but say only what is absolutely necessary. Forhe realizes that gossip may cause criticism of his treatment. He will do none atall of these things in a way that savours of fuss or of show. Let all thesethings be thought out, so that they may be ready beforehand for use as required.Otherwise there must always be lack when need arises.. . . You must have prepared in advance emollients classified according to theirvarious uses, and get ready powerful draughts prepared according to formulaafter their various kinds. You must make ready beforehand purgative medicines,also, taken from suitable localities, prepared in the proper manner, after theirvarious kinds and sizes, some preserved so as to last a long time, others freshto be used at the time, and similarly with the rest.. . . When you enter a sick man’s room, having made these arrangements, that youmay not be at a loss, and having everything in order for what is to be done,know what you must do before going in. For many cases need, not reasoning, butpractical help. So you must from your experience forecast what the issue willbe. To do so adds to one’s reputation, and the learning thereof is easy.. . . On entering bear in mind your manner of sitting, reserve, arrangement ofdress, decisive utterance, brevity of speech, composure, bedside manners, care,replies to objections, calm self-control to meet the troubles that occur, rebukeof disturbance, readiness to do what has to be done. In addition to these thingsbe careful of your first preparation. Failing this, make no further mistake inthe matters wherefrom instructions are given for readiness.. . . Make frequent visits; be especially careful in your examination,counteracting the things wherein you have been deceived at the changes. Thus youwill know the case more easily, and at the same time you will also be more atyour ease. For instability is characteristic of the humours, and so they mayalso be easily altered by nature and by chance. For failure to observe theproper season or help gives the disease a start and kills the patient, as therewas nothing to relieve him. For when many things together produce a result thereis difficulty. Sequences of single phenomena are more manageable, and are moreeasily learnt by experience.. . . Keep a watch also on the faults of the patients, which often makes themlie about the taking of things prescribed. For through not taking disagreeabledrinks, purgative or other, they sometimes die. What they have done neverresults in a confession, but the blame is thrown upon the physician.. . . The bed also must be considered. The season and the kind of illness willmake a difference, Some patients are put into breezy spots, others into coveredplaces or underground. Consider also noises and smells, especially the smell ofwine. This is distinctly bad, and you must shun it or change it.Perform all this calmly and adroitly, concealing most things from the patientwhile you are attending to him. Give necessary orders with cheerfulness andserenity, turning his attention away from what is being done to him; sometimesreprove sharply and emphatically, and sometimes comfort with solicitude andattention, revealing nothing of the patient’s future or present condition. Formany patients through this cause have taken a turn for the worse, I mean by thedeclaration I have mentioned of what is present, or by a forecast of what is tocome.. . . Let one of your pupils be left in charge, to carry out instructionswithout unpleasantness, and to administer the treatment. Choose out those whohave been already admitted into the mysteries of the art, so as to add anythingnecessary, and to give treatment with safety. He is there also to prevent thosethings escaping notice that happen in the intervals between visits. Never put alayman in charge of anything, otherwise if a mischance occur the blame will fallon you. Let there never be any doubt about the points which will secure thesuccess of your plan, and no blame will attach to you, but achievement willbring you pride. So say beforehand all this at the time the things are done, tothose whose business it is to have fuller knowledge.. . . Such being the things that make for good reputation and decorum, inwisdom, in medicine, and in the arts generally, the physician must mark off theparts about which I have spoken, wrap himself round always with the other, watchit and keep it, perform it and pass it on. For things that are glorious areclosely guarded among all men. And those who have made their way through themare held in honour by parents and children; and if any of them do not know manythings, they are brought to understanding by the facts of actual experience.The Huangdi Neijing, the “Yellow Emperor’s Inner Cannon,” is the oldest and mostrevered medical classic in China and is thought to have been assembled by acollection of authors between 300–200 BC. The collection is comprised of twoprimary works, the Su Wen (Basic Questions) and Ling shu (Spiritual Pivot), thateach contains 81 chapters. According to Chinese scholar Paul Unschuld, theHuangdi Neijing “plays a role in Chinese medical history comparable to that ofthe Hippocratic writings in Europe. Progress and significant paradigm changeshave reduced Hippocrates to the honored originator of a tradition that hasbecome obsolete. In contrast, many practitioners of Chinese medicine stillconsider the Su Wen a valuable source of theoretical inspiration and practicalknowledge in modern clinical settings.”The text is composed of questions put forth by the legendary Yellow Emperor andwhich are answered. The first text, the Su Wen, poses medical theories anddiagnostic procedures; the second text, the Ling Shu, is a collection ofacupuncture therapies.Older Chinese medical texts highlighted the demonic genesis of disease, theNeijing, deals with natural causes of disease including diet, age, lifestyle,and emotions. Additionally, the text proposed other forces and concepts ofdisease, including yin and yang and qi (life energy or energy flow). The Neijingadditionally deals with normal and abnormal functioning of the human body plusdiagnostic approaches and original therapies.According to the Neijing, humans are made up of five “viscera” that are theheart, spleen, lungs, liver, and kidneys and six “bowels” that are the gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, urinary bladder, and TripleBurner (the three zones of the chest and abdomen). The organs communicatethrough meridians or channels that are not physical structures, but ratherenergetic communications that can be influenced by the insertion of acupunctureneedles that can support or depress energy flow.For thousands of years, the history of pharmacy (the art of compounding anddispensing drugs) paralleled the history of pharmacognosy: the science ofcompounding drugs from herbs and flowers. In the first century AD, PedaniusDioscorides, an army surgeon, accumulated and organized all of the known medicaluses of plants, herbs, flowers, and elements into a manual that was to betranslated and read for more than 1,500 years. Arabs were the first to copy andpreserve this remarkable collection of data, which became the basis for Islamicpharmacology, that was again retranslated into Latin.In modern times a hospital is thought of as an institution—a building full ofdoctors, nurses, operating rooms, emergency rooms, and a place to have one’sbabies—that is capitalized by public funds, corporations, universities, andcharities. In the early days of the hospital concept, the system was funded byreligious orders and charitable nobility. In ancient Egypt and Greece templesserved as centers for the sanctioned healing arts.King Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka (400 BC) ordered the construction and operationof “lying-in homes” and hospitals. King Ashoka of India (250 BC) funded numeroushospitals that were permanently staffed with physicians and nurses. During thesixth and seventh centuries the Academy of Gundishapur in the Persian Empirebecame one of the first teaching hospitals hosting numerous students that werementored and supervised by physicians.In 325 AD the First Council of Nicaea caused the Church to provide care for thepoor and travelers by constructing hospitals in every cathedral town. Thepurpose of the early hospitals was to administer to the sick and suffering andto save souls.The Vienna General Hospital (VGH) opened its doors in1784 and became the world’slargest hospital with more than 2,000 beds. The VGH provided services in theareas of general medicine, surgery, venereal disease, and contagious diseases.It also bragged of a lying-in facility for delivery babies, a tower for theinsane, and an orphanage.Johann Frank, a German physician, was an important leader in the earlydevelopment of hospitals by encouraging them to keep records. His CompleteSystem of Medical Policy, published in 1779, dealt with hygiene and publichealth issues.Dioscorides, a Greek physician, was born in Turkey and practiced in Rome duringthe reign of Nero. He traveled constantly, collecting and describing as many as600 different plants in a five volume work entitled De Materia Medica (RegardingMedical Matters), 70 AD, in which he included accurate botanical drawings. Hisinstructions were practical and contained dosages and recipes for compoundingthe final medicinal products and instructions for the patients.Dioscorides described the preparation and uses of opium and cannabis (marijuana)for pain and peppermint and wild blackberries for improving digestion. Histreatments included concoctions for ulcers, nematodes, and antidotes forspecific poisons and hundreds of other remedies.John Mann, a chemist, noted, “The major triumph and novelty of Dioscorides’herbal (book) was his ordering of plants according to their pharmacologicalproperties, rather than their botanical family. Many of his plant extracts wereundoubtedly effective; for example, those of henbane and mandrake containingtropane alkaloids (naturally occurring nitrogen-containing organic molecules),which were used for pain relief, but his use of hemlock is less convincing: “itprevents the breasts of a virgin growing larger.”Anatomist Andreas Vesalius’s study of anatomy began with his goal to recover theancient wisdom of Hippocrates and Galen from the medieval vulgarizations.Vesalius, an ethnic Greek was born in AD 129, and in similar fashion as hispredecessor Leonardo da Vinci, who had performed dissections “in the service ofscience and art,” Vesalius used every opportunity as a professor in Padua andlater in Bologna to dissect cadavers, often stolen from graveyards or thegallows.Vesalius was only 30 years old when he published his first book, On the Fabricof the Human Body, a text that contained seven volumes and was based on hisanatomy lectures in Padua. The text was richly illustrated with engravings fromthe workshop of the Italian painter Titian. Vesalius’s book is considered to bean “exemplar of Renaissance flowering in scientific learning, artistic techniqueand printing acumen.” It contains detailed and accurate relationships of theskeleton, musculature, cardiovascular system, and urinary and reproductivetracts with labels in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. The book is considered anartistic work as well as an anatomical landmark. Drawings depict cadavers orskeletons posed in pastoral landscapes or village scenes. One classic drawing,features a skeleton with its face turned up toward the heavens, leaning on ashovel and gesturing towards a freshly dug grave.Galen of Pergamon was born in the second century (130–210 AD), and other thanHippocrates, no other Greek physician has influenced the direction of Westernmedicine more than he. During the peak of the Roman Empire, Galen’s medicalknowledge, anatomical descriptions, and the shear volume of writings dominatedhis followers for more than 1,000 years: “he synthesized medical works of theHippocratics, Aristotelian biology, and Platonic philosophy, creating a systemof medical theory and practice that dominated Western and Islamic medicine untilthe 19th century.”According to his written records, Galen employed as many as 20 scribes at a timeto keep up with his dictations, and his animal dissections increased theunderstanding of organ systems:Upon the occasion of my first visit to Rome I (Galen) completely won theadmiration of the philosopher Glaucon by the diagnosis which I made in the caseof one of his friends. Meeting me one day in the street he shook hands with meand said: ‘I have just come from the house of a sick man, and I wish that youwould visit him with me. He is a Sicilian physician, the same person with whom Iwas walking when you met me the other day.’ Galen asked, ‘What is the matterwith him?’ When coming nearer to me he said, in the frankest manner possible:Gorgias and Apelas told me yesterday that you had made some diagnoses andprognoses which looked to them more like acts of divination than products of themedical art pure and simple. I would therefore like very much to see some proof,not of your knowledge but this extraordinary art which you are said to possess.’At this very moment we reached the entrance of the patient’s house, and so, tomy regret, I was prevented from having any further conversation with him on thesubject and from explaining to him how the element of good luck often renders itpossible for a physician to give, as it were offhand, diagnoses and prognoses ofthis exceptional character.Just as we were approaching the first door, after entering the house, we met aservant who had in his hand a basin which he had brought from the sick room andwhich he was on his way to empty upon the dung heap. As we passed him I appearednot to pay any attention to the contents of the basin, but at a mere glance Iperceived that they consisted of a thin sanio-sanguinolent fluid, in whichfloated excrementitious masses that resembled shreds of flesh—an unmistakableevidence of disease of the liver. Glaucon and I, not a word having been spokenby either of us, passed on into the patient’s room. When I put out my hand tofeel the latter’s pulse, he called my attention to the fact that he had just hada stool, and that owing to the circumstance of his having gotten out of bed, hispulse might be accelerated. It was in fact somewhat more rapid that it shouldbe, but I attributed this to the existence of an inflammation. Then, observingupon the window sill a vessel containing a mixture of hyssop and honey andwater, I made up my mind that the patient, who was himself a physician, believedthat the malady from which he was suffering was a pleurisy; the pain which heexperienced on the right side in the region of the false ribs (and which is alsoassociated with inflammation of the liver) confirming him in this belief, andthus inducing him to order for the relief of the slight accompanying cough themixture to which I have called attention.It was then that the idea came into my mind that, as fortune had thrown theopportunity in my way, I would avail myself of it to enhance my reputation inGlaucon’s estimation. Accordingly, placing my hand on the patient’s right sideover the false rib, I remarked: ‘This is the spot where the disease is located.’He, supposing that I must have gained this knowledge by simply feeling hispulse, replied with a look which plainly expressed admiration mingled withastonishment, that I was entirely right. “And,” I added simply to increase hisastonishment, “you will doubtless admit that at long intervals you feel impelledto indulge in a shallow, dry cough, unaccompanied by an expectoration.” As luckwould have it, he coughed in just this manner almost before I had got the wordsout of my mouth. At this Glaucon, who had hitherto, not spoken a word, broke outinto a volley of praises.‘Do not imagine,’ I replied, ‘that which you have observed represents the utmostof which medical art is capable in the matter of fathoming the mysteries ofdisease in a living person. There still remain one or two other symptoms towhich I will direct your attention.’ Turning to the patient I remarked: ‘Whenyou draw a longer breath you feel a more marked pain, do you not, in the regionwhich I indicated; and with this pain there is associated sense of weight in thehypochondrium?’ At these words the patient expressed his astonishment andadmiration in the strongest possible terms. I wanted to go a step farther andannounce to my audience still another symptom which is sometimes observed in themore serious maladies of the liver (scirrhus, for example), but I was afraidthat I might compromise the laudation which had been bestowed upon me. It thenoccurred to me that I might safely make the announcement if I put it somewhat inthe form of a prognosis. So I remarked to the patient: ‘You will probably soonexperience, if you have not already done so, a sensation of something pullingupon the right clavicle.’ He admitted that he had already noticed this symptom.‘Then I will give just one more evidence of this power of divination which youbelieve that I possess. You, yourself, before I arrived on the scene, had madeup your mind that your ailment was an attack of pleurisy, etc.’Glaucon’s confidence in me and in the medical art, after this episode, wasunbounded.Galen was born in what became the western coast of Turkey. He traveled widelyprior to taking up residence in Rome. Human dissection was illegal at that time,so his anatomical research was based on pigs, dogs, and Barbary apes (monkeys).He used live dissections (vivisection) to prove the brain could control musclegroup movement by cutting nerves. Loss of the ability to vocalize could beaccomplished by cutting the laryngeal nerve. To prove that the kidneys producedurine he tied off the ureters and noted that the kidneys would swell with theaccumulation of urine that could not be passed into the bladder; and asphysician to the gladiators, he could look into the catastrophic wounds ofbattle to observe human anatomy. He eventually became physician to the EmperorMarcus Aurelius.Galen envisioned himself as a gifted diagnostician and “heir to the best of theHippocratic tradition (then over 500 years old).” However, not all of Galen’smedical philosophy, treatments, and anatomical findings were one hundred percentcorrect: after pondering Hippocrates’s views that disease was the result of “animbalance of the four humors (liquids) of blood, black bile, yellow bile, andphlegm” he postulated that an imbalance of each separate humor could be relatedto a human temperament. In other words, he postulated that an abundance of blackbile could be related to a melancholic personality.Galen additionally incorrectly thought that “venous blood was created and pumpedby the liver” and that “the arterial blood originated in the heart,” and hebelieved that “blood passed from the left and right side of the heart throughinvisible pores.”The pursuit of philosophy was an essential part of the training of physicians.After the Roman Empire fell, Galen’s influence not only continued; his writingsand theories spread through the Arab world and then later into the EuropeanMiddle Ages and on into the twentieth century.One of the most notable physicians in medieval medicine and of the Islamic worldwas Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Rhazes (865–925 AD), who was born inPersia (Iran) and is known to the West as “Rhazes.” He wrote 200 books duringhis active professional life covering such topics and specialties as philosophy,alchemy, and medicine.The first of Rhazes’s books was a work on pediatrics and is lionized forextensive descriptions and observations that separated smallpox and measles asseparate diseases. He was the first to correlate wounds and lesions of thebrain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system to clinical symptoms.As well as scholarly books, Rhazes wrote books for the average person who wantedto participate in self-help. In his view on medical ethics he stated that “Thedoctor’s aim is to do good, even to our enemies . . . My profession forbids usto do harm to our kindred, as it is instituted for the benefit and welfare ofthe human race.”Rhazes was well known for contradicting earlier physicians of fame, includingGalen, when he determined that they were incorrect in their theories andpontifications. He also laid severe criticism on religious prophets andreligions, including Islam. According to legend, Rhazes rejected a physician whovolunteered to remove his cataracts, exclaiming, “I have seen enough of theworld.” He died blind and generally unhappy.One of Rhazes pivotal works is Kitab al-hawi fi al-tibb (Comprehensive Book ofMedicine, 900 AD), a complete collection of the practice of medicine andobservations that his students compiled following his death. This book inspiredgenerations of physicians of the Islamic world, including the revered Avicenna,author of the five volume Cannon of Medicine.The barber pole, denoted by its red, white, and blue helical stripes, has beenemployed for centuries as a symbol and marker of the barber’s trade. Thistradition dates back to a time during which a barber, in addition to trimminghair, extracted teeth and performed various surgical procedures, includingbloodletting, the practice of draining the patient’s blood to encourage healing.The theory is that the classic barber pole originated from the practice ofhanging damp bloody bandages, typically partially cleaned, outside the barbershop on a pole, and as they blew in the wind around the pole, they resulted inthe helical pattern that became an advertisement for the barber.In 1096 French barber-surgeons formed an official brotherhood. In 1210, in aneffort to separate academic surgeons from barber-surgeons, the College de SaintCome et Saint Damien of Paris required that the academic surgeons wear longrobes and barber-surgeons to wear short robes. The legendary French surgeon,Ambrose Pare began his career as a barber-surgeon and through study andapprenticeship became the most celebrated surgeon of the European Renaissance.In 1540 the barber-surgeons and academic surgeons in England combined forces tocreate a single guild: the United Barber-Surgeons Company. However, the twodivisions of surgeons were limited in their practices. The barber’s division wasrequired to display the blue and white pole, and the barbers were forbidden toprovide advanced surgical procedures, although they were still allowed toextract teeth and perform bloodletting. The academic surgeons were required todisplay poles featuring red and white stripes and could perform advancedsurgical procedures, but they were forbidden to cut hair and shave clients.Paracelsus was one of the most controversial medical figures of the 16thcentury. He was the consummate outsider, who was hated by the “orthodox”physicians of his time. He has been elevated to “the first modern medicalscientist” and is also revered by many generations of occultists because of hisinterest in and writings about mysticism.Paracelsus was born in Einsiedein, Switzerland, in 1493. His full name wasPhillipus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim. There has been anenormous volume of literature written about him. There are two differing viewsof Paracelsus: the first, is that of medical scholars, the second is that ofoccultists.Paracelsus’ father, Wilhelm Bombast von Hohenheim, studied medicine in Tubingen,Germany, and moved to Einsiedein where he practiced medicine and then to Villachin Carinthia, Austria, and it was here that Paracelsus grew up.It is believed that Paracelsus earned his medical doctorate in 1515 at themedical school located at Ferrara in northern Italy. He then practiced medicineuntil his death at age forty-eight. Over a ten-year period, Paracelsus traveled,studied, and practiced medicine in Rome, Naples, Sicily, southern Spain,Portugal, Paris, and London. He then traveled to Stockholm, Moscow, and Greece.Paracelsus arrived in Salzburg in1524, moved to Strasburg, and took up aposition as the town physician and Professor of Medicine in Basel in 1526. Uponhis arrival in Basel, he was called to the house of a very well-known scholarand printer, Johannes Frobenius, whose right leg was gangrenous. The localphysicians could only recommend amputation as the correct course of treatment.However, Paracelsus was able to save the man’s leg.When he arrived at Basel, his reputation for great medical ability, unorthodoxviews, and a short temper preceded him. Instantly he was met with seriousopposition from both the local apothecaries, whose medical knowledge and skillswere quite backward, and from the local medical practitioners, whose views wereconsidered to be very conservative compared to Paracelsus, whose practices wereconsidered at the very least unorthodox!To fight back, Paracelsus handed out a printed brochure that announced that hewas going to give free two hour lectures daily on his own medical experiencesand “not on the methods of out of date authorities.”Paracelsus announced a second innovation: He was going to give regularlyscheduled lectures on surgery, and they were going to be in German rather thanin the traditional Latin. Paracelsus’ innovative approach to training andmarketing to his patients was highly successful and it specifically upset thebarber-surgeons, who historically were the ones doing surgery.The barber-surgeons and the entire population of the town’s physicians unitedagainst Paracelsus. They didn’t like his approach to medicine and they didn’tlike him. For his part, Paracelsus regularly let them know that he held onlycontempt and disgust for their approach to medicine and surgery.After only eleven months in Basel, Paracelsus left rather abruptly (did thetown’s doctors and barber-surgeons threaten to charge him with witchcraft andsorcery?) and moved to Alsace. At this time, Paracelsus became an itinerantphysician. Throughout the following thirteen years until his death in 1541, hemoved to and practiced medicine in sixty-two different towns in Germany andAustria.Paracelsus wrote papers and articles almost obsessively, and of the twenty-fourof his publications printed between 1529 and 1541, at least sixteen were“astrological prognostications.” He was not interested in being an astrologicalprophet as much as he was interested in astrological medicine and how theweather affected human health.In a well-known piece from his Pargranum, composed well after he departed Basel,Paracelsus rails against those physicians he had contempt for and he consideredto be archaic: “Avicenna, Galen, Rhasis, Montagnana, and all the rest of you,after me and not I after you! Even in the most distant corner there will not beone of you on whom the dogs will not piss. But I will be the king and mine willbe the kingdom . . ”Jolande Jacobe, noted in her 1951 writings on Paracelsus titled Paracelsus:Selected Writings: “Paracelsus regarded medicine as an art and is consideredtoday to be the first modern medical scientist, and as the precursor ofmicrochemistry, antisepsis, modern wound surgery, homeopathy, and manyadditional ultra-modern achievements.”Paracelsus was thought by his followers, to be above all, a physician and hebased his idea of medicine on four tenets: (1) a philosophical approach; (2)astronomy (medical astrology); (3) alchemy (as a servant of the art of medicinerather than the pursuit of transmutation of base metals into gold; (4) personalmoral purity of the physician himself.Paracelsus believed fully that Nature heals and that the physician can onlyassist Nature. During his lifetime Paracelsus was considered the “pox ofphysicians.” He was publically hated and in many cases simply ignored by hiscontemporaries. He died in poverty at the age of forty-eight in Salzburg onSeptember 24, 1541. Yet he lives on in his many books and publications. Someoriginals were still being published in 1618.The Jewish physician Faraj ben Salim translated Katib al-hawi into Latin in1279, and after it was printed in 1486 under the title Liber Continens, itsinfluence spread. Katib al-hawi is remarkable, not only because of its size, butalso for its comprehensive discussions of the practices of Greek, Arabian, andIndian physicians, whose works would otherwise have been lost to the world.Also influential to Western medicine in Medieval Europe was al-Rhazes’ medicaltextbook entitled Al-tibbs al-Mansuri (Medicine Dedicated to Mansur).Ibn Sina, frequently referred to by his Latinized name, Avicenna, was a Persianphilosopher-physician who in 1025 penned perhaps the most famous medical book ofMedieval Islamic societies, Al-Qanum fi al-tibb (The Canon of Medicine), whichwas the basis for medical philosophy and teaching for the next 700 years. Thesecond book of this five-volume series presents more than 760 drugs that IbnSina judged to be useful, with standards for determining efficacy that laid outthe basic tenets of experimental medicine: * Each drug, unadulterated and unspoiled, should be tested in patients with a single condition. * The investigator should begin with the smallest dose. * Efficacious drugs should have a consistent effect.Ibn Sina believed in investigating the roots of illness. In The Canon ofMedicine he wrote, “The knowledge of anything since all things have causes, isnot acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicinewe ought to know the causes of sickness and health.”Historian Lawrence Conrad writes that the Canon “covered the various fields ofmedicine with a precision and thoroughness that gave it authoritative sway overthe discipline for hundreds of years, and it ranks as one of the most impressiveand enduring achievements of Islamic science.” The iconic Canadian physician,William Osler, described Avicenna as the “author of the most famous medicaltextbook ever written” and noted that the Canon persisted as “a medical biblefor a longer time than any other work.”The first individual to correctly describe the route of pulmonary circulationwas a Muslim physician, Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288), who was born near Damascus,Syria, and worked in Cairo, Egypt. Pulmonary circulation is the passage of bloodfrom the right ventricle of the heart through the pulmonary artery into thelungs. After the blood is oxygenated in the lung via passage through capillariesto the pulmonary veins back to the left atrium, then to the left ventricle andthen out to the body proper through the aorta.Al-Nafis was particularly adamant about not parroting theories of pastphysicians. He wrote in his 1242 remarks called Commentary on Anatomy inAvicenna’s Cannon: “In determining the use of each organ we shall relynecessarily on verified examinations and straightforward research, disregardingwhether our opinions will agree or disagree with those of our predecessors.”For example, al-Nafis denied the prevailing wisdom of the Greek physician,Galen, and the Persian physician, Avicenna, both of whom believed that bloodpassed from one side of the heart to the other through invisible pores in theheart wall separating the left from the right side.Al-Nafis knew there were no such pores as Galen proposed between the right andleft sides of the heart. Instead al-Nafis recorded, “The blood from the rightchamber must flow through the vena arteriosa (pulmonary artery) to the lungs,spread through its substances, be mingled there with air, pass through thearteria venosa (pulmonary vein) to reach the left chamber of the heart and thereform the vital spirit.” His then radical view was developed when he was age 29and was not added to until 1628, when the English physician William Harveypublished his complete theory of the continuous cycle of blood throughout theentire body.Al-Nafis compiled and wrote passages for 300 volumes of the medical encyclopediaThe Comprehensive Book on Medicine, of which 80 volumes were officiallypublished.Just as Copernicus posed the idea that the sun, not the earth, was the center ofthe universe, an English physician, William Harvey, had the daunting job ofconvincing his skeptical colleagues that the beating heart, not the liver, isthe power behind the circulation of blood.With his demonstration of the circulation of blood, Harvey (1578–1657 AD) couldhave revised and replaced the Galenic version of physiology. Different from thecontemporary revelations in astronomy and physics, Harvey’s correct and accuraterevelations of circulation failed to have a dramatic effect on medical educationor practice. However, his anatomical research and experimentation in animalsadvanced medical science by leaps and bounds.Harvey’s efforts reversed a prevailing theory that had lasted for a thousandyears. This prevailing theory at the beginning of the 17th century was that theliver converted food into “natural blood,” which circulated through veins andthe heart and to all of the body’s tissues, where it was consumed. The arterialsystem carried air, breath, and was separate from the venous circulation, eventhough it was supplied with a tiny amount of blood through holes in the septumseparating the heart’s four chambers.Harvey’s careful deductions and experiments proved this could not be so. A cutartery spurted blood and pumped blood in the same pattern and timing with theheart’s beat.In a live dissection of a snake, a pinched artery appeared to engorge the heart,compared with a pinched vein that made the heart shrink and go pale.Harvey also calculated that the small amount of blood entering arterial systemfrom the heart in a single hour equaled a multiple of a person’s entire bloodvolume—far more than could be expected from a liver.In 1628 Harvey published his famous book, On the Motion of the Heart, notingthat the movement of blood through the body is circular and that the pulsingheart itself drives the circulation of blood in an endless cycle:Thus far we have spoken of the quantity of blood passing through the heart andthe lungs in the centre of the body, and in like manner from the arteries intothe veins in the peripheral parts and the body at large. We have yet to explain,however, in what manner the blood finds its way back to the heart from theextremities by the veins, and how and in what way these are the only vesselsthat convey the blood from the external to the central parts; which done, Iconceive that the three fundamental propositions laid down for the circulationof the blood will be so plain, so well established, so obviously true, that theymay claim general credence. Now the remaining position will be made sufficientlyclear from the valves which are found in the cavities of the veins themselves,from the uses of these, and from experiments cognizable by the senses.The celebrated Hieronymus Fabricius of Aquapendente, a most skillful anatomist,and venerable old man, or, as the learned Riolan will have it, Jacobus Silvius,first gave representations of the valves in the veins, which consist of raisedor loose portions of the inner membranes of these situated at differentdistances from one another, and diversely in different individuals; they areconnate at the sides of the veins; they are directed upwards or towards thetrunks of the veins; the two—for there are for the most part two together—regardeach other, mutually touch, and are so ready to come into contact by theiredges, that if anything attempt to pass from the trunks into the branches of theveins, or from the greater vessels into the less, they completely prevent it;they are farther so arranged, that the horns of those that succeed are oppositethe middle of the convexity of those that precede, and so on alternately.The discoverer of these valves did not rightly understand their use, nor havesucceeding anatomists added anything to our knowledge: for their office is by nomeans explained when we are told that it is to hinder the blood, by its weight,from flowing into the inferior parts; for the edges of the valves in the jugularveins hang downwards, and are so contrived that they prevent the blood fromrising upwards; the valves, in a word, do not invariably look upwards, butalways towards the trunk of the veins, invariably towards the seat of the heart.I, and indeed others, have sometimes found valves in the emulgent veins, and inthose of the mesentery, the edges of which were directed towards the vena cavaand vena portae. Let it be added that there are no valves in the arteries, andthat dogs, oxen, etc., have invariably valves at the divisions of their cruralveins, in the veins that meet towards the top of the os sacrum, and in thosebranches which come from the haunches, in which no such effect of gravity fromthe erect position was to be apprehended. Neither are there valves of thejugular veins for the purpose of guarding against apoplexy, as some have said;because in sleep the head is more apt to be influenced by the contents of thecarotid arteries. Neither are the valves present in order that the blood may beretained in the divarications or smaller trunks and minuter branches, and not besuffered to flow entirely into the more open and capacious channels; for theyoccur where there are no divarications; although it must be owned that they aremost frequent at the points where branches join. Neither do they exist for thepurpose of rendering the current of blood more slow from the centre of the body;for it seems likely that the blood would be disposed to flow with sufficientslowness of its own accord, as it would have to pass from larger intocontinually smaller vessels, being separated from the mass and fountain head,and attaining from warmer into colder places.But the veins are solely made and instituted lest the blood should pass from thegreater into the lesser veins, and either rupture them or cause them to becomevaricose; lest, instead of advancing from the extreme to the central parts ofthe body, the blood should rather proceed along the veins from the centre to theextremities; but the delicate valves, while they readily open in the rightdirection, entirely prevent all such contrary motion, being so situated andarranged, that if anything escapes, or is less perfectly obstructed by thecornua of the one above, the fluid passing, as it were, by the chinks betweenthe cornua, it is immediately received on the convexity of the one beneath,which is placed transversely with reference to the former, and so is effectuallyhindered from getting any farther.And this I have frequently experienced in my dissections of the veins: if Iattempted to pass a probe from the trunk of the veins into one of the smallerbranches, whatever care I took I found it impossible to introduce it far anyway, by reason of the valves; whilst, on the contrary, it was most easy to pushit along in the opposite direction, from without inwards, or from the branchestowards the trunks and roots. In many places two valves are so placed andfitted, that when raised they come exactly together in the middle of the vein,and are there united by the contact of their margins; and so accurate is theadaption, that neither by the eye nor by any other means of examination, can theslightest chink along the line of contact be perceived. But if the probe be nowintroduced from the extreme towards the more central parts, the valves, like thefloodgates of a river, give way, and are most readily pushed aside. The effectof this arrangement plainly is to prevent all motion of the blood from the heartand vena cava, whether it be upwards towards the head, or downwards towards thefeet, or to either side towards the arms, not a drop can pass; all motion of theblood, beginning in the larger and tending towards the smaller veins, is opposedand resisted by them; whilst the motion that proceeds from the lesser to end inthe larger branches is favored, or, at all events, a free and open passage isleft for it.But that this truth may be made more apparent, let an arm be tied up above theelbow as if for phlebotomy. At intervals in the course of the veins, especiallyin laboring people and those whose veins are large, certain knots or elevationswill be perceived, and this not only at the places where a branch is received,but also where none enters: these knots or risings are all formed by valves,which thus show themselves externally. And now if you press the blood from thespace above one of the valves, and keep the point of a finger upon the veininferiorly, you will see no influx of blood from above; the portion of the veinbetween the point of the finger and the valve will be obliterated; yet will thevessel continue sufficiently distended above the valve. The blood being thuspressed out, and the vein emptied, if you now apply a finger of the other handupon the distended part of the vein above the valve, and press downwards, youwill find that you cannot force the blood through or beyond the valve; but thegreater effort you use, you will only see the portion of vein that is betweenthe finger and the valve become more distended, that portion of the vein whichis below the valve remaining all the while empty.It would therefore appear that the function of the valves in the veins is thesame as that of the three sigmoid valves which we find at the commencement ofthe aorta and pulmonary artery, to prevent all reflux of the blood that ispassing over them.Farther, the arm being bound as before, and the veins looking full anddistended, if you press at one part in the course of a vein with the point of afinger, and then with another finger streak the blood upwards beyond the nextvalve, you will perceive that this portion of the vein continues empty, and thatthe blood cannot retrograde, precisely as we have already seen the case to be;but the finger first applied, being removed, immediately the vein is filled frombelow, (and the arm returns to its original architecture). That the blood in theveins therefore proceeds from inferior or more remote to superior parts, andtowards the heart, moving in these vessels in this and not in the contrarydirection, appears most obviously. And although in some places the valves, bynot acting with such perfect accuracy, or where there is but a single valve, donot seem totally to prevent the passage of the blood from the centre, still thegreater number of them plainly do so; and then, where things appear contrivedmore negligently, this is compensated either by the more frequent occurrence ormore perfect action of the succeeding valves, or in some other way: the valves,in short, as they are the free and open conduits of the blood returning to theheart, so are they effectively prevented from serving as its channels ofdistribution from the heart.But this other circumstance has to be noted: The arm being bound, and the veinsmade turgid, and the valves prominent, as before, apply the thumb or finger overa vein in the situation of one of the valves in such a way as to compress it,and prevent any blood from passing upwards from the hand; then, with a finger ofthe other hand, streak the blood in the vein upwards till it has passed the nextvalve above, the vessel now remains empty; but the finger being removed for aninstant, the vein is immediately filled from below; apply the finger again, andhaving in the same manner streaked the blood upwards, again remove the fingerbelow, and again the vessel becomes distended as before; and this repeat, say athousand times, in a short space of time. And now compute the quantity of bloodwhich you have thus pressed up beyond the valve, and then multiplying theassumed quantity by one thousand, you will find that so much blood has passedthrough a certain portion of the vessel; and I do now believe that you will findyourself convinced of the circulation of the blood, and of its rapid motion. Butif in this experiment you say that a violence is done to nature, I do not doubtbut that, if you proceed in the same way, only taking as great a length of veinas possible, and merely remark with what rapidity the blood flows upwards, andfills the vessel from below, you will come to the same conclusion.And now I may be allowed to give in brief my view of the circulation of theblood, and to propose it for general adoption.Since all things, both argument and ocular demonstration, show that the bloodpasses through the lungs and heart by the force of the ventricles, and is sentfor the distribution to all parts of the body, where it makes its way into theveins and porosities of the flesh, and then flows by the veins from thecircumference on every side to the centre, from the lesser to the greater veins,and is by them finally discharged into the vena cava and right auricle of theheart, and this in such a quantity or in such a flux and reflux thither by thearteries, hither by the veins, as cannot possibly be applied by the ingesta, andis much greater than can be required for mere purposes of nutrition; it isabsolutely necessary to conclude that the blood in the animal body is impelledin a circle, and is in a state of ceaseless motion; that this is the act orfunction which the heart performs by means of its pulse; and that it is the soleand only end of the motion and contraction of the heart.Just a few years after Harvey had died, Italian physician Marcello Malpighiemployed a microscope to observe microscopic capillaries that provided theconnections between the arterial circulation and the veinous return circulationto the heart.Approximately during the same period as Harvey’s dramatic revelation ofcirculation being driven by the heart rather than the liver, Newton proposed hislaw of universal gravitation (1687). According to his famous law, every massiveparticle in the universe is attracted to every other particle with a force thatis directly related to the sum of their masses and is inversely related to thesquare of the distance between them. Within these relationships, proportionalityis held constant in this theory at all places and all times—thus it is known asthe “universal gravitational constant.”Further, Newton’s laws of motion consist of three physical laws that describethe relationship between forces acting on a body and its motion due to theseforces: 1. A body remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a force. 2. The acceleration of a body is proportional to the force causing the acceleration and is inversely proportional to its mass. 3. When a force acts on a body due to another body, an equal and opposite force acts simultaneously on that body.Taken in their totality, these laws were significant in that they establishedthe concept of a clockwork universe, which drove the science of astronomy andphysics for the next 200 years. In this view, the universe was similar to aclock wound up by God and set in motion in such a manner to assure thateverything ran as the perfect machine.Deists grabbed onto the God-clock theory quickly and “delighted in the conceptthat God simply set the wheels of the universe in motion.” Newton, on the otherhand, became frustrated, fearing that this view of his theory would lead toatheism.In 1774 English chemist and theologian Joseph Priestly conducted a now legendaryexperiment in which he proved that plants take in a gas that animals give off(carbon dioxide) and that plants give off a gas that animals take in (oxygen).Priestly took a mouse and placed it in an enclosed glass container until themouse collapsed. When he put a plant in the container with the mouse, the mousesurvived, thereby proving that the plant was producing something that enabledthe mouse to live. At the time, Priestly did not know that the gases were, as weknow today, “oxygen” and “carbon dioxide.”HOMEOPATHYHomeopathy is a healing art that is based on the ancient alchemist’s belief that“like cures like.” The healing art of modern homeopathy came from the work andstudies of the German physician, Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843).Hahnemann began his use of homeopathy in 1790 when he, like Paracelsus, hadbecome frustrated with the then standard medical treatments of bloodletting, andpurging and blistering with liquid mercury.Hahnemann first became enthralled with the Cinchona bark that was usedsuccessfully to cure malaria. He observed and recorded that consuming the barkproduced a malaria-like fever. He then began to look at other substances thatwhen ingested produced the symptoms of the disease he wanted to cure—“like cureslike!”According to the theory and principles of homeopathy, the “mother tincture” orthe basic substance has to be diluted and “secussed,” meaning to be vigorouslyshaken. The more diluted the remedy the more potent it becomes. Many homeopathicremedies are so diluted that the quantity of the active substance falls belowAvagadro’s number and it can no longer be detected by analysis.The goal of the homeopath is to restore the balance of the patients “vitalforce” or energy much like the philosophy of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine).Homeopathy gained the public’s interest and credibility world-wide during the19th century. The homeopathic hospital in London demonstrated a considerablyhigher survival rate than the allopathic medical hospitals during the choleraepidemic of 1854. Did that mean that the homeopathic remedies were moreeffective or that the bloodletting and purging with mercury were more dangerous?Dr. Wilhelm Heinrich Schuessler (1821–1898), a physician from Oldenburg, Germanydeduced that minerals, “tissue salts” or “cell salts,” were the basic stuff ofall human flesh and even life itself. Schuessler, who studied medicine andrelated sciences at the most highly regarded schools of Paris, Berlin, Geissen,and Prague, is considered the “father and founder of the science ofbiochemistry.”Schuessler was quided and influenced by the highly regarded German chemistLiebig, who postulated that the human body is composed of “cells” which arecomplex building blocks that are composed of organic material, water, and“salts” or minerals.Schuessler methodically cremated the corpses of indigent humans dying in Germanhospitals and analyzed the resultant ash. With the limited number of analyticalmethods available in his day he was only able to identify 12 “cell salts.” Giventhe meager amount of information he had access to, and given the fact that someof his mineral deficiency to disease relationships were incorrect, Schuesslerdemonstrated great insight for realizing the connection between mineraldeficiencies and imbalances and their relationship to chronic degenerativedisease.Schuessler, heavily influenced by Hahnemann and his low dose homeopathicapproach, employed his “cell salts” as a homeopathic remedy rather than a highdose nutritional supplement which severely reduced the effectiveness of his“cell salts.”ANESTHESIA“John Wayne anesthesia,” meaning a shot of whiskey and a blunt force to thehead, was the anesthesia of the day until the mid-19th century. It is impossibleto contemplate how anyone could have tolerated a dental extraction, limbamputation, or crude abdominal surgery, appendectomy, hysterectomy, or bulletremoval before the advent of anesthesia.Surgeons of the day had to be bold, fast, and be able to work regardless of thepatient’s terrified screams. A covey of nurses had to be numerous enough orstrong enough to restrain the patients active attempts to flee or fight thesurgeon’s efforts.By the mid-1840s, surgeons had few methods of reducing surgical pain except forthe surgeon to use a knockout punch, whisky, or mesmerism (hypnosis) to dull thepatients pain and fear. Many subjected to these early attempts at surgery diedof simple shock: “The surgery was a success, but the patient died!”The modern era of surgical anesthesia came in 1844, when a Connecticut dentistby the name Horace Wells attended a parlor trick demonstration of intoxicationon a volunteer by means of administering a “laughing gas” of nitrous oxide.During the demonstration one volunteer suffered a severe laceration of his leg,yet he did not complain or withdraw his leg from the resulting pain.Wells was so impressed with the laughing delirium and anesthesia produced byinhaling nitrous oxide, that he immediately proposed trying the gas on a dentalpatient during tooth extraction. The anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide hadbeen recognized for decades, since volunteers could be pricked with pins withoutresulting pain or withdrawing their punctured hand. However, medical minds ofthe day initially failed to recognize the anesthetic value for the patient.Wells failed attempt at using nitrous oxide during a tooth extraction at theMassachusetts General Hospital drew contempt from the observing physicians whenthe patient screamed in pain.The concept of anesthesia came when Wells’ dental associate, William Morton,extracted an infected tooth with the patient anesthetized, not with the laughinggas, but instead with ether, another inhalant gas that produced a deeperanesthesia.When the patient awakened, he was surprised that his bicuspid had already beenremoved!Morton anesthetized a second patient with ether during an operation to remove aneck tumor. The surgeon upon completing the surgery, turned and exclaimed to hisattending colleagues: “Gentlemen, this is no humbug.”Anesthesia quickly advanced from a parlor curiosity to a well-acceptedadvancement in surgical technique. To get surgeons and the general public toaccept anesthesia for surgery, Queen Victoria of England was anesthetized withchloroform during the deliveries of her eighth and ninth children in 1853 and1857.OSTEOPATHYIn 1892 osteopathy began in a small school in Kirksville, Missouri. The schoolwas started by Dr. Andrew Taylor Still, a former Civil War Army surgeon, who hadlost most of his children during the war from the ravages of infectiousdiseases.According to Still’s philosophy, most diseases were caused by mechanicalinterference of nerves and blood and blood flow, and they were curable bymanipulation of “deranged, displaced bones, nerves, muscles—removing allobstructions—thereby setting the machinery of life moving.”In his autobiography Dr. Still claimed that he could “shake a child and stopscarlet fever, croup, diphtheria, and cure whooping cough in three days by a‘wring’ of its neck.” Surgery and pharmaceuticals of the day were harmful anddangerous, and people resisted bloodletting, rectal feeding, and toxic drugcocktails that included large doses of mercury and arsenic. Dr. Still noted that“in Missouri and Kansas where the doctors were shut out, the children did notdie.”Originally, the osteopathic physician was trained in physical manipulation anddiet, however, in the 20th and 21st centuries an American trained D.O., orDoctor of Osteopathic Medicine, is educated and practices in much the manner asan MD (medical doctor).CHIROPRACTIC MEDICINEThe formal practice of chiropractic (DC) began in 1895 when Daniel David “D.D.”Palmer reported that he had improved a patient’s hearing by physically“manipulating” a man’s spine. Palmer, a former bee keeper and grocer, claimed hehad gotten the idea for chiropractic from the spirit of a deceased physician.In 1909 Palmer wrote, “Chiropractors have found in every disease that issupposed to be contagious, a cause in the spine. In the spinal column we willfind a subluxation that corresponds to every type of disease. If we had onehundred cases of small-pox, I can prove to you where, in one, you will find asubluxation and you will find the same conditions in the other ninety nine. Iadjust one and return his functions to normal . . . There is no contagiousdisease. . . . There is no infection.”From the 20th century through the 21st century chiropractic has beensuccessfully employed to relieve musculoskeletal disability and pain throughmanipulation. Traditional chiropractors, or “Straight” practitioners, limittheir practice to spinal and cervical (neck) manipulation that relievessubluxations of the vertebrae, which in turn relieves pressure on the cervicaland spinal nerves—thus relieving symptoms such as peripheral neuropathies, neck,back, and joint pain.“Mixers” are chiropractors that have added herbal medicines and nutritionalsupplements to their style of practice.NATUROPATHIC MEDICINENaturopathy is practiced by naturopathic physicians (ND). What distinguishesnaturopathic medicine from allopathic medicine is that its “practice” emergesfrom its underlying principle—FIRST DO NO HARM. Naturopathic medicine claimsHippocrates as its father and recognizes an inherent healing capacity of thebody. Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease through cleanliving; good diet; supplementation of nutrients when necessary to ensure thebody’s optimum health, maintenance, and repair; exercise; practicing a religiousfaith; and when necessary the employment of noninvasive therapies such astreatment with nutritional supplements, herbs, message, hydrotherapy,acupuncture, TCM, naturopathic manipulation, homeopathy, counseling, gynecology,obstetrics, pediatrics, minor surgery, and—rarely—prescription drugs and othermedications.The “scope” of practice of naturopathic medicine in modern times varies widelyfrom state to state depending on the strength and oppressiveness of theallopathic (aka: orthodox medicine) medical lobby at the time naturopathicmedicine was introduced into that state. As taught, naturopathy covers the fullpractice of medicine. Therefore NDs are “primary care physicians,” excluding thepractice of major surgery and the everyday prescribing of most legend drugs.Naturopathic medicine is taught in accredited naturopathic colleges anduniversities and is licensed and/or regulated in several countries, such asEurope, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and numerous American states includingOregon, Washington, California, Arizona, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Alaska, Hawaii,Nevada, Florida, Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Georgia, andperhaps others.PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHOANALYSISNext to Freud, the most influential psychiatrist in the 20th century was CarlGustav Jung (1875–1961). He was born in Kesswil, a Swiss village located nearthe falls of the Rhine River. His grandfather, a Rosicrucian freethinker, wasalleged to be the illegitimate son of Goethe. He had been exiled from Germanyand then moved to Switzerland where he became a professor of medicine andsurgery at Basel.Jung’s father was a very orthodox pastor whose pastime was psychology. Jung,himself, earned a medical degree at the University of Basel and then, as Freudhad done, he studied psychological medicine in Paris. He returned to Switzerlandand took a position as a lecturer in the Psychiatric Clinic of ZurichUniversity.In 1907 Jung heard Freud speak and initially became one of his most rabiddisciples, but soon Jung’s own clinical observations led him to reexamine manyof Freud’s basic principles. Jung believed that Freud gave too much weight tosexual repression as a cause of mental illness. Instead, Jung taught that“greater importance should be attached to the effects of emotional conflicts andto the stresses and strains of the patient at the time of his breakdown.” Jung’sbook, The Psychology of the Unconscious (1912), was filled with criticisms ofFreud’s theories which lead to a major falling out between the two men.Jung referred to his own theories and treatments as “analytical psychology” andleft the term “psychoanalysis” to Freud. Over the years of his clinical work,Jung came to believe that one of the most common causes of a nervous breakdownwas a “loss of religious faith.” The majority of Jung’s later studies werefilled with topics that both his supporters and critics “dismissed as antiquatedsuperstition and unworthy of a genuine scientist’s interest or attention”:alchemy, astrology, spiritualism, and popular folklore. Jung believed that,“Even if these beliefs were wholly false, the reasons for their widespreadprevalence called for a psychological investigation.”Jung performed a statistical study of nearly 500 marriages and 1,000 horoscopes.These were paired off in a variety of ways and comparisons were looked atthrough the astrological charts of individuals both with their spouses and withother members of the group. Jung then looked carefully at the horoscopes of themarried and the unmarried couples and discovered a number of noteworthyconnections—primarily a tendency for the married woman’s Moon to be inconjunction with the husband’s Sun. While appearing to be arguing theopposition’s case, by his saying that the connection could not be causallyrelated, he however, unlike naysayers of astrology, posited that the connectioncould not be denied and must be accounted for.Jung’s interest and eventual belief in astrology heartened professionalastrologers throughout the world and promoted a modern resurgence of astrologyas a force to be dealt with.Jung had a profound impact on how Alcoholics Anonymous became so effective. Hesuggested that recovering alcoholics place themselves in a regimented religiousatmosphere “of their own choice.” This spiritual approach positively transformedmany alcoholics who were unsuccessful when they employed other methods.In 1928 Jung, along with Richard Wilhelm, who was an authority on Chinesephilosophy, published The Secret of the Golden Flower. The secret, according toJung, was that “man is a cosmos in miniature, and is not divided from the GreatCosmos by any fixed limits; Tao, the Undivided, all-embracing ONE, gives rise totwo opposite reality-principles—Darkness and Light, Yin and Yang.”Jung had observed that alchemy “has been called the dream of primitive medicine”and that it should not be considered “a bogus science practiced by mercenarycharlatans.” Philosophers such as St. Thomas Aquinas, physicians such as SirThomas Browne, and deeply revered scientists such as Sir Isaac Newton hadstudied alchemy.Much like Gnosticism, alchemy had developed in the Hellenistic culture ofAlexandria in Egypt. The Egyptian metallurgist had accumulated the trade secretsof extracting the “noble metals” (gold and silver) for the wealthy and the lesscostly alloys for those who could not afford the real thing. The processesperformed in the laboratory followed the principles of Aristotelian physics andAlexandrian Neoplatonism, which had significant influence on early Christiandoctrine. The leading concept was that the world of man (microcosm) reflectedthe macrocosm (the universe as a whole).Mesopotamian astrology, as a result, became inexorably linked to alchemy. Eachmetal was linked to a celestial counterpart: gold was linked to the sun, silverwith the moon, quicksilver with mercury, and so forth. To accomplish these tasksfor transmutation, 12 successive laboratory processes, associated with the 12signs of the zodiac, were required. The astronomical symbols were used torepresent the primary chemical ingredients and processes.Jung indicates that the explanatory theories were described in terms of“fanciful analogies.” Later alchemists were commonly physicians and theycompared the chemical processes of alchemy to human physiology and medicine.Jung also believed that, “lowlier animals had to be sacrificed, cleansed, andburned before they could live again as part of the human body, so too, thehumbler metals had to be ‘killed, washed and fired’ before emerging as thenobler metals such as gold and silver.”Ideas and philosophies were introduced from the ancient Chinese alchemist wholooked at the transmutation of lower metals into gold and silver as of secondaryimportance. Their goal was to “supplement” the practice of herbal medicine whichwas designed to cure minor ailments, with a pill or elixir (that is, thepanacea) prepared from minerals and metals which might confer “immortality.”All of the Chinese theories of alchemy reappear in the thoughts and writings ofParacelsus, and Jung asserted that Paracelsus should be considered the founderof iatrochemistry (the application of chemistry to medical theory) and thefounder of psychological medicine because he professed to cure physical andpsychical disorders as well.Jung was among the first to recognize the fact that modern historians ofchemistry now totally recognize that alchemy had both an exoteric popular beliefand an esoteric secretly shrouded belief. The exoteric alchemy practices andbeliefs were centered on the philosopher’s stone—the magical substance thatwould convert, lead, tin, and copper, not into a compound or alloy but into thepurified silver and gold. The esoteric or mystical alchemy was devoted to these“mundane transmutations as symbolic of a devotional system by which sinful mancould be transformed into a perfect and immortal being.”MEDICAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATESIn 1900 medical school training in America was extremely primitive. Loftyadmission requirements were totally absent; often the only requirement was ahigh school degree for admission. An important milestone in medical education inAmerica happened in 1914 with the publication of “Medical Education in theUnited States and Canada,” an investigation by Abraham Flexner.Medical education in America in the 20th and 21st centuries has been directed bythe results of Flexner’s report. Flexner, a retired university president,visited each of the 155 medical schools in the United States and Canada. TheFlexner report was conducted at the behest of and funded by the oil baron JohnD. Rockefeller and the steel magnet Andrew Carnegie. Flexner compared thecurriculum and the student populations of the various types of medical schools.A few of the medical schools, including Johns Hopkins University School ofMedicine and Wake Forest University School of Medicine, received an excellentevaluation score; however, Flexner gave significant numbers of “proprietary”schools an extremely negative score.The proprietary schools were in fact “trade” schools that had no university orcollege affiliations, dissection was not offered, and many instructors werenon-academic local practitioners. They were: 1. those medical schools considered “straights”—ones that employed mercury to blister (applications of mercury to the skin) and prescribed oral doses of liquid mercury to purge the illness 2. those medical schools that prescribed herbs as plant medicines 3. those schools that preferentially prescribed homeopathy 4. those medical schools that preferentially pursued a healthy diet and lifestyleFlexner’s recommendations included a minimum requirement of a high schooleducation and two years of basic sciences obtained through studies at a collegeor university for consideration for admission, and only 16 of the 155 schoolsvisited could meet the recommendations. Flexner also suggested that medicaleducation should be a four year study with two years of basic medical scienceand two years of medical training.Flexner further stated that, “An education in medicine involved both learningand learning how; the student cannot effectively know, unless he knows how.” TheMedical College Admission Test (MCAT) was developed in 1928 to provide astandardized admission test for medical school admission.Following the report most medical schools, unable to comply with Flexner’sstandards, closed, thus leaving 66 operating in America by 1935. A majornegative of the Flexner report was that small medical schools that supported“alternative” medical theory closed for lack of funding, lack of students andlack of political support.After receiving Flexner’s report, the Rockefeller Foundation and CarnegieInstitute decided to fund the straight medical schools because prescriptiondrugs were made from petroleum products. The funding of the straight medicalschools created a migration of a majority of the medical students to the morehighly funded schools and the closing of almost all other healing professions.During this same period of time of the Flexner Report, the straight medicaldoctors were busy in the halls of politics legislating themselves into aprotected monopoly—with no government oversight, self-policing, no competition,and unlimited funds through private or government insurance.The straight medical group also killed off all of their competition by becomingintimately involved with politics. By the late 1920s straight medical doctorsruled the practice of medicine in America, and all other forms of medicine wereaggressively and legislatively deemed to be “quackery.” Governments at the city,county, state and federal level, and the military only recognized MDs as“legitimate” physicians. Insurance by law could only pay MDs, thus choking offall other healers availability to patients.In the early 1930s, a Cleveland dentist by the name of Dr. Weston A. Price foryears traveled to remote parts of the world to study the dental health ofpeoples unaffected by Western civilization. His purpose was to search for theraw materials responsible for good dental health. His investigations revealedthat dental caries and malformed dental arches that created crowded andmisaligned teeth are the result of nutritional deficiencies, not inheritedgenetic defects.The cultures that Price studied included isolated villages in Switzerland,Gaelic villages in the Outer Hebrides, indigenous peoples of North and SouthAmerica, Melanesian and Polynesian South Sea Islanders, African tribes,Australian Aborigines, and New Zealand Maori. Wherever he went, Dr. Price foundthat beautiful straight teeth freed from decay, good physiques, a generalresistance to disease, and fine characters were typical of native groups ontheir traditional diets, rich in essential nutrients.When Dr. Price analyzed the foods consumed by these isolated cultures hereported, “by comparison to the American diet of his day, they provided at leastfour times the water-soluble vitamins, calcium and other minerals, and at leastten times the fat-soluble vitamins from animal foods such as butter, fish eggs,shellfish, organ meats, and animal fats—the very cholesterol-rich foods nowshunned by the American public as unhealthful.” Price felt that these healthy traditional cultures knew instinctively what researchers of Dr. Price’s day hadonly recently discovered: “That these fat-soluble vitamins, vitamins A and D,were vital to health as they were required as catalysts for efficient mineralabsorption and protein utilization.” Without them, humans cannot absorbminerals, no matter how abundant they may be found in the human diet.Dr. Price discovered an additional fat-soluble nutrient, which he labeled“Activator X,” that is present in fish livers and shellfish, organ meats, andbutter made from milk from cows that eat rapidly growing green grass in theSpring and Fall. All primitive cultures had a source of Activator X, now thoughtto be vitamin K2, in their diets.The remote cultures that Dr. Price investigated understood the importance ofpreconception nutrition for both parents. Many cultures required a period ofspecial feeding before conception, in which nutrient-dense animal sources ofnutrition were preferentially given to young men and women. The same specialdiets were also considered important for pregnant women, lactating women, andchildren. Price noted that these special diets were rich in minerals and in thefat-soluble activators typically found in animal fats—the vitamins A, D, E, andK.The remote peoples that Price initially photographed were noteworthy for “theirfine bodies, ease of reproduction, emotional stability, and freedom fromdegenerative diseases typical of the civilized moderns subsisting on thedisplacing foods of modern commerce, including sugar, white flour, pasteurizedmilk, low-fat foods, vegetable oils, and convenience items filled with extendersand additives.”The discoveries, theories, and conclusions of Dr. Price are noted in his classicwork, Nutrition and Physical Degeneration. His book contains dramaticphotographs of handsome, healthy, primitive peoples and illustrates in anunforgettable manner the physical degeneration that occurs when humans abandonnourishing traditional diets in favor of modern convenience foods.Price documented the classical characteristics of traditional diets: 1. The diets of healthy, non-industrialized peoples contain little or no refined sugar, white flour, canned foods, low-fat milk, hydrogenated vegetable oils, protein powders, synthetic vitamins, or artificial colorings. 2. All traditional cultures regularly consume animal food including fish, shellfish, land and water fowl, land and sea mammals, poultry eggs, dairy products, reptiles, and insects. The whole animal is consumed: muscle meat, organ meat, bones, fat. 3. The diets of healthy, non-industrialized peoples contained a least four times the minerals and water soluble vitamins, ten times the fat soluble vitamins found in animal fat (vitamin A, vitamin D, and Activator X (vitamin K2) as the standard American diet. 4. All traditional cultures cooked some of their food; however, all consumed a portion of their animal foods raw. 5. Primitive and traditional tribal diets have diets rich in fermented vegetables, fruit, drinks, dairy products, meats, and condiments. 6. Seeds, grains, and nuts are soaked, sprouted, and fermented. 7. Total fat content of traditional tribal diets varied between 30 to 80 percent of calories; however, only four percent of calories came from polyunsaturated oils that were found in whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, animal fats, and vegetables. The remainder of the fat calories was in the form of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. 8. Traditional diets contained nearly equal amounts of omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids. 9. All traditional diets contained salt. 10. All traditional cultures consumed animal bones and gelatin-rich bone soup. 11. Traditional cultures typically provide nutrient-rich animal foods for prenatal nutrition, pregnant and lactating women, and growing children.Being a dentist, Price was particularly interested in the differences in thefacial structures of those peoples consuming “native diets” and those whoseparents had adopted the “civilized diets of devitalized processed foods.” Incontrast to this, he consistently found that “Those consuming the originalcultural diets had a wide handsome face with plenty of room for the dentalarches. Those born to parents consuming the modernized diet had narrowed faces,crowded teeth and a reduced immunity to disease.”Price was an astute observer and noted quite correctly that as isolated tribalcultures were negatively impacted by the availability of modern packaged foods.However, he did not stress enough the associated changes and universal negativeimpact of electricity and natural gas on the human diet and nutrition. With theavailability of modern sources of fuel and energy, wood, the previouslyuniversal fuel, had been displaced, and the historical source of dietaryminerals—wood ashes—had been abandoned forever.People had been using plant minerals or “wood ashes” as their source of dietaryminerals since the beginning of time and the taming of fire. Then, at 3:00 PM inthe afternoon, Monday September 4, 1882, everything changed. This was the momentin history when Thomas Edison pulled the switch and fired up the firstcommercial electric generating plant in the world. The event took place on PearlStreet in New York City on the bluff overlooking the construction of theBrooklyn Bridge.While electricity sources contributed to the rapid advance of industry, the useof electricity as the source of fuel for heat, cooking, and light eliminated theindividual families’ traditional source of supplemental dietary minerals thatwas found in wood ashes! Sears catalogues touted the availability of electricstoves and the advantages of kitchen cleanliness compared with the dusty, dirty,wood stove and the necessity to take the wood ashes outside every day.As wood disappeared as the universal fuel, the general health of theindustrialized cultures declined, as no one thought or even considered for onemoment how to replace the lost source of nutritional minerals. In contrast, theagricultural industry had learned that a constant stream of dietary minerals wasessential for livestock health, reproduction, and profitability. The lack ofdietary minerals for livestock resulted in financial disaster because ofincreased frequency of disease and decrease in production of healthy offspring,meat, dairy, and eggs.Mineral-poor diets in farm, laboratory, and pet animals resulted in infertility,increased rates of birth defects, and reduced feed-conversion to meat, milk,eggs, and litter size. Farmers went out of business without the serioussupplementation of dietary minerals.Agricultural universities began to accumulate data on the diseases that wereproduced in animals from specific mineral deficiencies in the embryo, in thedeveloping young, and over time in the reproductive-age and the longevity ofolder individual animals.The advent of health insurance for humans began to separate the lines ofthinking between veterinarians and physicians. Veterinarians were required toprevent and cure diseases on a herd and flock basis by nutritionalsupplementation. In contrast to the treatment of animals, the human medicalsystem, with the availability of “health insurance,” began to ease thediscomforts and symptoms of degenerative diseases with long-term therapies thatwere paid for by insurance. The combination of electricity and health insurancebecame the “perfect storm” that would destroy the health of modern man.In 1954, at Boston’s Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, doctors led by surgeon JosephE. Murray performed the world’s first successful organ transplant. They removeda healthy kidney from one man and implanting it into his identical twin who wassuffering from kidney failure.This initial transplant success produced a stream of organ transplants and, ofequal importance, a large number of research projects that looked at theimmunological problems of organ transplants. Researchers attempted severalapproaches to the problem of rejection, such as radiating the recipient’s immunesystem and suppressing the immune system with pharmaceuticals.OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATESIn 1998 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) surveyed American hospitals andfound that hospitals caused 2 million infections per year in hospital patients,of which 90,000 died. One must ask: “How on earth can this breach of basichygiene happen”? The answer is “elementary, my dear Watson.” Doctors wear thesame slacks, the same panty hose, the same white coat, and the same shoes roomto room dragging with them pee, poop, pus, mucus, slime, bacteria, viruses,yeast, and molds. In contrast to this, SPF disease-free pigs are protected by afederal law that requires employees and visitors alike to disinfect their bootsand clothes between entries to different pig pens. We treat pigs in a barn withmore awareness and care for hygiene than we do humans in American hospitals!In 1993, 85,000 cases of hospital infections attributed to Clostridium dificilwere recorded in American hospitals. By 2010, seventeen years later, theinfection rate increased by 400% to 360,800. There was no incentive for theindividual doctors or the medical system to improve hygiene and eliminatehospital infections—after all, no one had their license suspended or revoked andinsurance paid!In 1998, 3,000 serious mistakes were recorded in American veteran’s hospitalswhich resulted in 700 veterans “killed” who had escaped death at the hands of aforeign enemy.In the year 2006 the CDC noted that pharmaceutical errors resulted in 1.5million fatalities and permanent injuries in American hospital patients. Thesenegative events were not the result of side effects of the drugs, but ratherdecimal point problems by the prescribing doctors and fulfillment errors by thepharmacists.In 2007 the CDC and the Journal of the American Medical Association reportedthat medical doctors kill, injure, and infect 15 million medical patients eachyear in America alone: 5.8 million in hospitals and 9.2 million in privateoffices and clinics. How many Americans would fly commercial airlines if theyknew that 15 million airline passengers were killed, injured, or infected eachyear by careless pilots and flight attendants? Nobody would fly!In 2010 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Office ofInspector General reported that 15,000 Medicare patients die each month inAmerican medical hospitals. That’s 180,000 Medicare patients killed each year bymedical doctors in their workplace!Included in the hospital fatalities during minor procedures in the years 2011and 2012 were three iconic figures: Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes fame, Dick Clarkfrom American Bandstand and astronaut Neil Armstrong (first man to set foot onthe moon).Andy Rooney, age 92, was was killed by “complications of a minor medicalprocedure (a colonoscopic exam).”Dick Clark, age 82, was killed by complications of a “minor prostate procedure.”Neil Armstrong of NASA, age 82, was killed by “complications of (an elective)cardiovascular procedure.”The medical profession in America kills and injures more people each year thanthe mafia has in 1,000 years. As a protected self-policing monopoly few doctorsget their licenses suspended or revoked and fewer are prosecuted for anyinjuries, infections, or deaths inflicted upon their customers. There are noincentives to protect the patient—after all—insurance pays!Despite spending more money each year for health care than all of the nations inthe world combined, as of 2012, following the guidance and treatment proceduresof the medical profession, America ranks 92nd in healthfulness. This means 91other nations are healthier than Americans. America ranks 60th in longevity, andthere are 59 other nations whose peoples live longer than Americans. And Godforgive us—we rank 41st in live births and first-month survivability of ourbabies.And by following the advice of medical doctors and the U.S. government, webecame the number one nation in the world with the greatest rates of obesity,and one out of three elderly die of dementia by 2012. This is hardly a testimonyto their theory on how to achieve and maintain good health and maximum lifespans."},{"pageContent":"PART2The Age of Vaccines and Antibiotics"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVETHE GERM THEORY AND BACTERIA(The) germ theory shifted the cause of disease away from internal organs toexternal invaders. The long-frustrated social hygiene movements could nowmarshal science to help their efforts to clean up the world in a joint campaignagainst a living “enemy.” What’s more, (the) germ theory spawned the new scienceof bacteriology, which more than any other form of inquiry brought pathologyinto the medical spotlight. Bacteriology established the microscope as a toolfor doctors as well as scientists.—Jacalyn DuffinHistory of Medicine:A Scandalously Short IntroductionThe idea behind (Pasteur’s) germ theory seems simple enough today.Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and protozoan parasites come fromforebears of the same species; they are present in large numbers almosteverywhere—in air, in water, in dust; finally, germs can therefore be understoodas the causative factor in not only fermentation and putrescence but also indisease. Different diseases are caused by different microbes. It all fitstogether into such a neat package that it’s hard at first to understand why hisgerm theory was so controversial and took so long to be accepted.—Hal HellmanGreat Feuds in Medicine: Ten of the Liveliest Disputes EverAs a Hungarian trainee in Vienna’s great hospital, Semmelweis (1818–1865) wasisolated from the easy camaraderie of Austrian medical students in the wards andautopsy rooms. Although he told of his discovery of the association betweenautopsies and childbed fever many different ways, he probably first noticed thetoo-frequent ringing of a little bell as the priest came to give last rites to adying mother. Becoming a crusader, Semmelweis angrily attacked Europeanobstetricians as murderers. He himself died from the skull fractures hesustained after (a forced) admission to an asylum.Ann G. Carmichael and Richard M. Ratzan (editors)Medicine: A Treasury of Art and LiteratureThe Justinian Plague, named for the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, killed 10,000people each day. The deaths started in 541 AD and before it was over 200 millionhad died.The Antonine Plague, named for one of the two Roman emperors who died from theinfection, began in 165 AD, and as it gained energy it killed 5,000 people eachday for 15 years, and ended up killing an estimated 27 million.The bubonic plague (Black Death) ravaged the 14th century, killing 25 millionEuropeans and an additional 12 million people throughout China and India. Theglobal total is unknown.Eyeglasses were invented in medieval Italy. In 1590 a Dutch eyeglass maker,Zacharias Janssen, and his father, Hans, discovered that they could build on theconcept of magnification using a single lens by using two lenses, and the lightmicroscope was born.In 1665, while looking at thin slivers of cork through a microscope, RobertHooke observed small holes, or what he coined “cells.” Hooke later said that thecavities reminded him of monk’s quarters (thus the origin of the name). Hebelieved that these cells had once been containers for “noble juices” or“fibrous threads” necessary for the cork tree’s survival. In addition Hookesupported the common theory of the day that only plants possessed cells; at thetime no one thought to look at animal or human tissues through the microscope.Hooke included drawings of the cells he had observed in his book, Micrographia.He also provided instructions for constructing a microscope like the one heused, presumably so that readers could make the same observations. Not happyenough to simply observe cells, Hooke calculated how many could be contained ina cubic inch. Hooke quite correctly calculated the number of cells would be:1,259,712,000.Known as the father of microscopy because of his superior designs ofmicroscopes, Anton van Leeuwenhoek is lauded for his building of a microscopethat could magnify up to 270 times as well as his observations and descriptionsof protozoa and bacteria. People had been using single lenses, such asmagnifying glasses, for centuries to observe small things. However, the singlelens is limited in its magnifying power. The compound lens microscope created bythe Dutch produced a system that allowed one magnified image to be magnifiedagain!The Dutch naturalist was the first to observe and document these one-celledorganisms in 1674. His findings opened up a new field of science and revealedthe world of microbiology to the biologist of his day. Additionally, vanLeeuwenhoek observed yeast cells, blood cells, sperm cells, and tissue cells.In 1716 Leeuenhoek wrote, “My work was not pursued in order to gain the praise Inow enjoy, but chiefly from a craving after knowledge . . . Whenever I found outanything remarkable, I have thought it my duty to put down my discovery onpaper, so that all ingenious people might be informed thereof.”The understanding of the basis of infectious disease is thought to be one of themost important discoveries of the 19th century. Up to the middle of the 19thcentury the prevailing belief was that microbes could spontaneously come to lifeout of inanimate matter. The theory proposed to support this phenomenon wascalled “spontaneous generation,” and it was thought that disease was not spreadfrom host to human host on droplets of sputum or bodily fluids, but rather was“carried on a miasma of noxious, foul-smelling air”Scientists rejected the spontaneous generation theory grudgingly. An amateurDutch lens grinder, Anton van Leeuwenhoek first looked at bacteria in the 1670s.It was not until the 19th century in 1840, almost 200 years later, thatHungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (1818–1865), developed, tested, and provedhis theory that the much-dreaded childbed fever was being transmitted on thehands of Austrian physicians, who, directly from their gruesome work at theautopsy table, wiped their gory hands on their aprons and then employed themunwashed as they attended women in labor in the great Vienna hospital.Semmelweis reported his observations in The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis ofChildbed Fever:Because Vienna is so large, women in labor often deliver on the street, on theglacis (earthwork), or in front of the gates of houses before they can reach thehospital. It is then necessary for the woman carrying her infant in her skirts,and often in very bad weather, to walk to the maternity hospital. Such birthsare referred to as street births. Admissions to the maternity clinic and to thefoundling home is gratis, on the condition that those admitted be available foropen instructional purposes, and that those fit to do so serve as wet nurses forthe foundling home. Infants not born in the maternity clinic are not admittedgratis to the foundling home because their mothers have not been available forinstruction. However, in order that those who had the intention of delivering inthe maternity hospital but who delivered on the way would not innocently losetheir privilege, street births were counted as hospital deliveries.This, however, led to the following abuse: women in somewhat bettercircumstances, seeking to avoid the unpleasantness of open examination withoutlosing the benefit of having their infants accepted gratis to the foundlinghome, would be delivered by midwives in the city and then be taken quickly bycoach to the clinic where they claimed that the birth had occurred unexpectedlywhile they were on their way to the clinic. If the child had not been christenedand if the umbilical cord was still fresh, these cases were treated as streetbirths, and the mother received charity exactly like those who delivered at thehospital. The number of these cases was high; frequently in a single monthbetween the two clinics there were as many as one hundred cases.As I have noted, women who delivered on the street contracted childbed fever ata significantly lower rate than those who delivered in the hospital. This was inspite of the less favorable conditions in which such births took place. Ofcourse, in most of these cases delivery occurred in a bed with the assistance ofa midwife. Moreover, after three hours our patients were obliged to walk totheir beds by way of the glass-enclosed passageway. However, such inconvenienceis certainly less dangerous than being delivered by a midwife, then immediatelyhaving to arise, walk down many flights of stairs to the waiting carriage,travel in all weather conditions and over horribly rough pavement to thematernity hospital, and there having to climb up another flight of stairs. Forthose who really gave birth on the street, the conditions would have been evenmore difficult.To me, it appeared logical to the patients who experienced street births wouldbecome ill at least as frequently as those who delivered in the clinic. I havealready expressed my firm conviction that the deaths in the first clinic werenot caused by epidemic influences but by endemic and as yet unknown factors,that is, factors whose harmful influences were limited to the first clinic. Whatprotected those who delivered outside the clinic from these destructive unknownendemic influences? In the second clinic, the health of the patients whounderwent street births was as good as in the first clinic, but there thedifference was not so striking, since the health of the patients was generallymuch better . . .In addition to those who delivered on the street, those who deliveredprematurely also became ill much less frequently than ordinary patients. Thosewho delivered prematurely were not only exposed to all the same endemicinfluences as patients who went full-term, they also suffered the additionalharm of whatever caused the premature delivery. Under these circumstances, howcould their superior health be explained? One explanation was that the earlierthe birth, the less developed the puerperal condition and therefore the smallerthe predisposition for the disease. Yet puerperal fever can begin during birthor even during pregnancy; indeed, even at these times it can be fatal. Thebetter health of patients who delivered prematurely in the second clinicconformed to the general superior health of full-term patients in the clinic.Patients often became ill sporadically. One diseased patient would be surroundedby healthy patients. But very often whole rows would become ill without a singlepatient in the row remaining healthy. The beds in the maternity wards werearranged along the length of the rooms and were separated by equal spaces.Depending on their location, rooms in the clinic extended either north-south oreast-west. If patients in beds along the north walls became ill we were ofteninclined to regard chilling as a significant factor. However, on the nextoccasion those along the south wall would become ill. Many times those on theeast and west walls would become diseased. Often the disease spread from oneside to the other, so that no one location seemed better or worse. How couldthese events be explained, given the same patterns did not appear in the secondclinic where one encountered the disease only sporadically?I was convinced that the greater mortality rate at the first clinic was due toan endemic but as yet unknown cause. The fact that the newborn, whether femaleor male, also contracted childbed fever convinced me that the disease wasmisconceived. I was aware of many facts for which I had no explanation. Deliverywith prolonged dilation almost inevitably led to death. Patients who deliveredprematurely or on the street almost never became ill, and this contradicted myconviction that the deaths were due to endemic causes. The disease appearedsequentially among patients in the first clinic. Patients in the second clinicwere healthier, although individuals working there were no more skillful orconscientious in their duties. The disrespect displayed by the employees towardsthe personnel of the first clinic made me so miserable that life seemedworthless. Everything was in question; everything seemed inexplicable;everything was doubtful. Only the large number of deaths was an unquestionablereality.The reader can appreciate my perplexity during my first period of service whenI, like a drowning person grasping at a straw, discontinued supine deliveries,which had been customary in the first clinic, in favor of deliveries from alateral position. I did this for no other reason than that the latter werecustomary in the second clinic. I did not believe that the supine position wasso detrimental that additional deaths could be attributed to its use. But in thesecond clinic deliveries were performed from a lateral position and the patientswere healthier. Consequently, we also delivered from the lateral position, sothat everything would be exactly as in the second clinic.I spent the winter of 1846–47 studying English. I did this because mypredecessor, Dr. Breit, resumed the position of assistant, and I wanted to spendtime in the large Dublin maternity hospital. Then, at the end of February 1847,Dr. Breit was named Professor of Obstetrics at the medical school in Tubingen. Ichanged my travel plans and, in the company of two friends, departed for Veniceon 2 March 1847.On 20 March of the same year, a few hours after returning to Vienna, I resumed,with rejuvenated vigor, the position of assistant in the first clinic. I wasimmediately overwhelmed by the sad news that Professor Kolletschka, whom Igreatly admired, had died in the interim.The case history went as follows: Kolletschka, Professor of Forensic Medicine,often conducted autopsies for legal purposes in the company of students. Duringone such exercise, his finger was pricked by a student with the same knife thatwas being used in the autopsy. I do not recall which finger was cut. ProfessorKolletschka contracted lymphangitis and phlebitis in the upper extremity. Then,while I was still in Venice, he died of bilateral pleurisy, pericarditis,peritonitis, and meningitis. A few days before he died, a metastasis also formedin one eye. I was still animated by the art treasures of Venice, but the news ofKolletschka’s death agitated me still more. In this excited condition I couldsee clearly that the disease from which Kolletschka died was identical to thatfrom which so many hundred maternity patients had also died. The maternitypatients also had lymphangitis, peritonitis, pericarditis, pleurisy, andmeningitis, and metastases also formed in many of them. Day and night I washaunted by the image of Kolletschka’s disease and was forced to recognize, evermore decisively, that the disease from which Kolletschka died was identical tothat from which so many maternity patients died.Earlier, I pointed out that, autopsies of the newborn disclosed resultsidentical to those obtained in autopsies of patients dying from childbed fever.I concluded that the newborn died of childbed fever. I concluded that thenewborn died of childbed fever, or in other words, that they died from the samedisease as the maternity patients. Since the identical results were found inKolletschka’s autopsy, the inference that Kolletschka died from the same diseasewas confirmed. The exciting cause of Professor Kolletschka’s death was known; itwas the wound by the autopsy knife that had been contaminated by cadaverousparticles. Not the wound, but contamination of the wound by the cadaverousparticles caused his death. Kolletschka was not the first to have died this way.I was forced to admit that if his disease was identical with the disease thatkilled so many maternity patients, then it must have originated from the samecause that brought it on in Kolletschka. In Kolletschka, the specific causalfactor was the cadaverous particles that were introduced into his vascularsystem. I was compelled to ask whether cadaverous particles had been introducedinto the vascular systems of those patients whom I had seen die of thisidentical disease. I was forced to answer affirmatively.Because of the anatomical orientation of the Viennese medical school,professors, assistants, and students have frequent opportunity to contactcadavers. Ordinary washing with soap is not sufficient to remove all adheringcadaverous particles. This is proven by the cadaverous smell that the handsretain for a longer or shorter time. In the examination of pregnant ordelivering maternity patients, the hands, contaminated with cadaverousparticles, are brought into contact with the genitals of these individuals,creating the possibility of resorption. With resorption, the cadaverousparticles are introduced into the vascular system of the patient. In this way,maternity patients contract the same disease that was found in Kolletschka.Suppose cadaverous particles adhering to hands cause the same disease amongmaternity patients that cadaverous particles adhering to the knife caused inKolletschka. Then if those particles are destroyed chemically, so that inexaminations patients are touched by fingers but not by cadaverous particles,the disease must be reduced. This seemed all the more likely, since I knew thatwhen decomposing organic material is brought into contact with living organismsit may bring on decomposition.To destroy cadaverous matter adhering to hands I used chlorine liquida. Thispractice began in the middle of May 1847; I no longer remember the specific day.Both the students and I were required to wash before examinations. After a timeI ceased to use chlorina liquida because of its high price, and I adopted theless expensive chlorinated lime. In May 1847, during the second half of whichchlorine washings were first introduced, 36 patients died—this was 12.24 percentof 294 deliveries. In the remaining seven months of 1847, the mortality rate wasbelow that of the patients in the second clinic.LOUIS PASTEUR, THE GERM THEORY, AND THE SCIENCE OF MICROBIOLOGYLouis Pasteur was born in Dole in eastern France, a tanner’s son. He attendedschool at Arbois and Besancon with grades sufficient to be recommended fortaking the entrance exam for the prestigious Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris.Pasteur failed to pass the exam on his first attempt but his second try wassuccessful. His academic path started with the physical sciences; he did verywell in his first degree and progressed to a dual doctorate in physics andchemistry with a major in crystallography.Five avenues of investigation defined Pasteur’s scientific and research methods: 1. Skill and tenacity as a researcher 2. Microscopy 3. The uniqueness of the chemistry of life 4. Ability to capitalize on raw luck 5. High public impact from his researchIn 1849 Pasteur took a position with the University of Strasbourg as a professorof chemistry, continuing to study asymmetry of crystals and reveled in hisgrowing scientific reputation. Pasteur’s personal situation changed followinghis marriage to Marie Laurent, the daughter of the rector of the university whogave devoted and practical support to his career. Six years later, Pasteur movedto the University of Lille as dean of the new Faculty of Science, with a missionto support the university’s goal of joining teaching and research with theparticipation of local industries through the application of science. Pasteurtaught bleaching, refining, and brewing, although his research continued toinvestigate asymmetric compounds and their optical properties.Pasteur’s interest in the chemistry of living organisms directed hisinvestigations of fermentation, particularly the part played by yeast in theproduction of alcohol. In 1857 Pasteur published the results of research onlactic acid, which was a common by-product of abnormal fermentation, and on amylalcohol. Pasteur was convinced that the asymmetric optical properties of amylalcohol came from the process of fermentation, which confirmed his belief thatit was a product of living creatures.Pasteur’s beliefs flew in the face of accepted dogma that fermentation was achemical process. In 1860 Pasteur was called back to Ecole Normale to bedirector of scientific studies. At this time he published a significant studythat showed unequivocally that fermentation was in fact a biological phenomenon.Pasteur then redirected his microscopic studies from crystal structures tolooking at wine fermenting and sour milk, observing that yeast and other“ferments,” which historically had been looked at as large molecules, were infact yeast that had changed shape during fermentation—thus confirming that yeastwere living cells or their “germs.”Pasteur’s view that fermentation was a biological process rather than a chemicalreaction, pulled him into a high profile public debate with Felix-ArchimedePouchet, who was a vocal supporter of the theory of spontaneous generation thatstates that life can begin from nothing.Pouchet spoke out in support of the theory of spontaneous generation until theend of 1850s. Pasteur first spoke out against the theory in February 1860, andthen published a prize winning essay arguing that life always arose fromexisting life. Pasteur used fermentation and decomposition (putrefaction) ininfusions of natural organic substances as his growth medium. Pasteur alwaysmaintained that new life in the laboratory was always due to contamination byliving ferments. Pouchet still argued that they could arise spontaneouslywithout contamination.The two scientists joined in a scientific duel, sharing experimental results andpolemics, in which fine matters of technique in sterilization were mixed withreflections on the religious implications of whether life was constantly beingcreated. Pasteur sided with the view that life had been created in the “distantpast by God’s creation” and could not arise simply by mixing inorganic materialsand physical forces. The contest was decided in Pasteur’s favor and againstspontaneous generation, not only through the emerging consensus of thescientific community, because in a highly unusual move judgments in Pasteur’sfavor were awarded by committees of the French Academy of Sciences.The controversy drew Pasteur toward new and unusual investigation of disease inanimals and humans. Medical doctors had long posed that the development offevers and septic infections were similar to fermentation and putrefaction;thinking of these processes as a result of invasion by living organisms or their“germs,” rather than a chemical process, posed new and highly controversialquestions. Initially, the connection between small unseen organisms and diseasewas a theory. However, Pasteur was able to successfully package the idea as the“germ theory of disease.”The term “germ” carried the message that the organisms were protein, widelydispersed in the environment (in air, water and soil), and potentiallyinfectious via multiplication. The designation “theory” inferred that the germ’sconnection to disease was still to be proved. Typical of Pasteur’s method ofthinking, he employed practical applications of his germ theories offermentation and putrefaction by demonstrating that by heating wine to 50C, onekilled the yeast cells and prevented the deterioration of wine to vinegar—thesame process used to prevent milk from spoiling became known as“pasteurization.”The most highly regarded medical use of Pasteur’s germ theories were employed byJoseph Lister, a British surgeon, who posed that septic infection of wounds wasdue to contamination of the wound, either surgical or traumatic, by putrefyinggerms and developed methods of antisepsis. Lister became a vociferous supporterof the wider use of germ theories to all infections and contagious diseases,while always crediting Pasteur for the basic discovery.In 1865 Pasteur’s reputation for successfully applying science to solve commonproblems caused the French government to draft him to head a team to investigatea devastating disease in the silk industry. After three years of investigation,Pasteur showed that the disease was caused by a parasite, and changes inmanagement were produced to keep the silk worms parasite and germ-free andhealthy.Pasteur’s broad success continued to give more exposure to germ theories for thegenesis of disease. Because of wide public interest in the germ theory, medicalinvestigators across the world incorporated the germ theory into their researchprocedures and private medical practices.Pasteur suffered his first stroke that produced a partial paralysis on his leftside and which continued for the remainder of his life. However, the stroke didnot slow the energy or pace of his research; in fact, Pasteur enjoyed the mostproductive time of his career following the stroke.Pasteur’s first study of an infectious disease was one that was primarily athreat to the French livestock: anthrax, although on rare occasions it couldalso infect humans.The bacterial cause of anthrax was established by Robert Koch in 1876. AlthoughPasteur questioned Koch’s experimental procedures, he is famous for his creationof a vaccine for anthrax by using the principle employed for creating thevaccine for smallpox, which is that contracting a mild infection can protectagainst a more serious infection.The anthrax bacillus (Bacillus anthracis) is an anaerobic bacteria, one thatflourishes in a low oxygen environment, so Pasteur reduced the virulence of thebacillus by exposing it to the oxygen in open air. In the laboratory trialsPasteur was immediately successful. He then took his “attenuated” vaccine toPouilly-le-Fort near Paris in 1881.Twenty-five sheep were vaccinated and twenty-five sheep were used asunvaccinated controls. Two weeks later, all fifty sheep were inoculated withviable anthrax bacillus—germs! A majority of the vaccinated sheep survived andalmost all of the unvaccinated sheep died of anthrax.In addition to providing an immediate benefit for the French farmer, Pasteur’ssuccess demonstrated that vaccination can be employed to defend a populationagainst all infectious diseases. Pasteur was immediately “lionized” at theInternational Medical Congress in 1881 and was blessed with the continuingsupport of the French government.Pasteur’s prestige continued to grow as he successfully took on more complicatedprojects, including the production of a post-exposure vaccine for rabies. Whilerabies is rare in a human population, it produced a high public anxiety becauseno one survived the disease—once symptoms of clinical rabies appeared, apredictable path to a horrible death was inevitable.Pasteur and his team produced rabies in laboratory dogs and rabbits. The earlytrials of the vaccine on dogs were successful and were then tested on humans forsafety. The idea was to use the extended incubation period of the rabies virusto help the patient build up a defense, an immunity to the causative virusbefore irreversible symptoms and death occurred.The first public trial was Joseph Meister, a boy who had been bitten by a rabiddog in eastern France. The boy was brought to Paris by his parents who had readof Pasteur’s attempts to find a cure for rabies. The boy survived and thevaccine was used on a second rabies infected boy with great success. Followingthe release of these successes to the public in 1885, rabies victims fromFrance, Europe and around the world came to Pasteur’s laboratory for thetreatment.The popular press of the day made Pasteur’s rabies cure a front page story,lauding him as one of the greatest scientists and humanitarians of the time andwhose research was destined to deliver man from the terrors of epidemics ofinfectious diseases—germs had been defeated!Additional awards and rewards flowed to Pasteur, but the greatest of them was apublic grant to fund an institution to pursue his research on a grand scale. Agrand opening of the Pasteur Institute occurred in November 1888.At his death in 1895, Louis Pasteur was viewed as a French national hero and aninternational celebrity. He was best known to the general public for hisresearch and public service in the science of infectious disease. To academia,Pasteur was an icon in the fields of stereochemistry, the biological basis offermentation. Pasteur personally defeated the theory of spontaneous generation,proved the germ theory of infectious disease, and proved the economic benefitsand human safety benefits of laboratory research.Pasteur’s elevated public image is thought to be due to a combination ofself-promotion and well-respected skills in the theory and practical applicationof the science of microbiology.When Louis Pasteur conducted his famous experiment in 1859, the idea that germscould infect and make people sick and even kill them was generally accepted,although it was meeting extreme resistance from those who still believed in thetheory of spontaneous generation.Pasteur’s experiments finally answered the question of whether spontaneousgeneration is possible. He created flasks of broth covered with filters orfitted with narrow, downward-curving stems that admitted air but excluded thetiniest of organisms and particles—and these devices failed to grow bacteria byspontaneous generation.Robert Koch, disturbed by “physician’s new and widespread belief that alldisease was caused by infectious organisms,” established a set of postulatesthat needed to be satisfied before one could say that a disease was caused by aninfectious organism: 1. An organism must be isolated from a patient with the disease 2. The suspected agent must be able to be grown on artificial medium 3. The pure organism must injected into a susceptible host and the disease reproduced 4. The agent must be able to be re-isolated from the infected susceptible host 5. The agent collected from the experimentally infected host must be able to be grown on an artificial medium and identified as the original organismAfter satisfying all of the postulates the recovered organism can withconfidence can be called the causative agent.Pasteur apparently enjoyed success because he lived his own and frequentlyquoted maxim:“In the fields of observation, chance favours only prepared minds.”—Louis PasteurQuoted from a speech at the University of Lille, 1854ALEXANDER FLEMING AND THE DISCOVERY OF ANTIBIOTICSWhen Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming returned from his 1928 summervacation, he noticed a mold growing in one of his culture dishes of bacteria.The bacterial population covered the surface of the growth media except for abacteria-free zone around the mold. Fleming deduced correctly that the “moldsjuice” was toxic to the pathogenic Staphylococcus spp.Fleming understood very well the potential of the agent he called penicillin. Heretested the new drug against additional disease causing organisms with positiveresults. However, the mold was difficult to grow and the active drug wasdifficult to isolate. Ten years later during World War II Allied governmentsjoined forces and found a way to solve the manufacturing problems and determinedthat the mechanism of action of the antimicrobial substance was the preventionof the development of the bacterial cell wall.In the middle of the 20th century, the pharmaceutical industry produced numerousfamilies of antibiotics. These rapidly replaced the old standbys of tincture ofiodine, hydrogen peroxide, and grandma’s collection of herbs, colloidal silver,and aroma therapy oils that had been employed as wound disinfectants andsystemic killers of germs for centuries, in some instances they had used formillennia—particularly against bacteria.In the decades following World War II, “super-bugs” appeared that had adaptedand biochemically learned how to survive treatments with the new antibiotics.The “miracle drugs” that had been created by the pharmaceutical giants weredefeated by single celled organisms. A common example of these successful germsis known as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).According to the Centers for Disease Control, each year in the United States,94,000 patients, contract MRSA infections. Of these 19,000 patients, almost 20%,die.A 1998 study published by the Centers for Disease Control stated that Americandoctors annually inflict 2 million infections upon American hospital patientsand 90,000 of these infected patients die each year.A common bowel bacteria, Clostridium difficile, infected 87,000 and killed30,000 American hospital patients in 1993. The annual infection numbers inAmerican hospital patients from “C. diff” rose to 487,000 by 2010, a 400 percentincrease in 17 years, hardly a sign that doctors were vigorously trying to solveproblems.“Taming the new drug-resistant pathogens requires ever more toxic, expensive,and time consuming therapies, such as a class of last resort antibiotics calledcarbapenems, which must be administered intravenously in hospitals. In theUnited States alone, fighting drug-resistant infections costs up to eightmillion additional patient hospital days at a cost of $34 billion every year . .. Now, the emergence in India of a particularly nasty form ofantibiotic-resistant bacteria, which renders even the last-resort drugs obsoletecould bring about an era of unstoppable infections . . .”—The Economist (March 31, 2011)"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXVIRUSESWe live in a dancing matrix of viruses; they dart, rather like bees, fromorganisms to organisms, from plant to insect to mammal to me and back again . .. passing around heredity as though (drugs) at a great party.—Lewis ThomasThe Lives of a CellMicrobiologists detected the existence of viruses in an indirect way before theywere able to see them. The discovery begins in 1883 with Adolf Mayer, a Germanbiologist who was investigating the cause of tobacco mosaic disease.Tobacco-mosaic disease depresses the growth of tobacco plants and produces amottled or mosaic coloration of the plants leaves. Mayer proved that the diseasewas infectious by transmitting it from plant to plant by spraying sap extractedfrom diseased leaves onto healthy plants. He searched for a bacterial microbe inthe infectious sap, but he couldn’t find any. Mayer originally deduced that thedisease was caused by an extremely small form of bacteria that could not be seenwith the microscope.Mayer’s small bacteria theory was tested ten years later by Dimitri Ivanowsky, aRussian who passed infective sap derived from infected tobacco leaves through asmall pore filter designed to filter out bacteria. However, after the sap waspassed through the filter it still produced mosaic disease.In 1897 Martinus Beijerinck, a Dutch botanist, found that the infectious agentin the filtered sap could reproduce. Beijerinck sprayed tobacco plants with thefiltered sap and found that after the exposure, these plants developed mosaicdisease. He then used their sap and could infect more plants, and he continuedthis process through a series of infections. Beijerinck reasoned that thepathogen must be reproducing and increasing its numbers because its ability tocause mosaic disease was undiluted after multiple transfers from plant to plant.It was then determined that the mosaic disease pathogen could reproduce only inthe host organism, and it could not be grown in artificial nutrient media intest tubes or petri dishes. The pathogen could not be inactivated by alcohol,which is usually deadly for bacteria. Beijerinck correctly deduced that thereproducing particle must be smaller and more simple than bacteria. His beliefswere confirmed in 1935 by Wendell Stanley, an American biologist whocrystallized the infectious particle now called the tobacco mosaic virus.THE HISTORY OF SMALLPOX AND EARLY VACCINATIONThe early practice called variolation to protect people from small pox has beenused in cultures throughout human history and was common among African tribes.The concept of pre-exposure prophylaxis was first brought to colonial America byslaves. This practice of inoculation by placing the fluid from a “pox” sore froma person with smallpox into the skin of a healthy person was highlycontroversial in the colonies in the beginning of the 18th century. But it wassoon widely adopted when it was documented that persons treated in this waygenerally had a mild case of the otherwise highly contagious and lethal diseasewith a 20-30 percent rate of mortality and could escape from the severe facialdisfigurement the disease is known for.According to historian Elizabeth Fenn in her book Pox Americana (published in2001), the Western hemisphere was attacked by two smallpox pandemics just beforeand during the American Revolutionary War.The smaller of the two pandemics is thought to have begun just outside of Bostonin early 1774 and smoldered in that location for several years, killing anaverage of ten to thirty people per day. In Boston the Declaration ofIndependence was relegated to second place as an event of public interest behinda city-wide smallpox vaccination campaign.The smallpox virus pandemic spread as far south as Georgia. It decimated theTsalagi (the group of Native Americans often called the “Cherokee,” which is aslightly insulting term created by their historical enemies, members of theCreek Confederation) and the Haudenosaunee, the indigenous name for the sixnations that made up what the Europeans named the Iroquois League). Both groupsof Native Americans were allies of the British, and after the epidemic neitherrecovered sufficiently to fight the colonists successfully. Smallpox alsoderailed the British plan to raise an army of Black slaves and indenturedservants with the promise of freedom after the war ended. The smallpox killedoff almost all of the “Ethiopian regiment” as they were being recruited andtrained.Because of their relative isolation from Europe, the colonists were almost assusceptible to smallpox infection and death as the Native Americans. So manysoldiers in the Continental Army fell ill during the epidemic that their leadersworried that smallpox would cause their revolt to grind to a halt.“The small Pox! The small Pox!” John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail. “Whatshall we do with it?” His concerns were quite correct; it was the virus, not theBritish army, that had stopped the Continental Army’s excursion into Quebec in1776. Fenn noted, “One of George Washington’s most brilliant moves, was toinoculate the army against the smallpox virus, during the Valley Forge winter of1778” Fenn went on to say, “Without inoculations, the smallpox epidemic couldhave easily handed the colonies back to the British.”During his apprenticeship, Edward Jenner, a country physician overheard a localmilk maid pass on a “folk belief” that as a milk maid she would never suffer thedisfiguring facial scars of smallpox. She was excited because she believed shewould never suffer from the typical scars of small pox because she already hadcontracted cowpox, a minor affliction common to dairy maids.Years later, in 1796, Jenner collected pus from a cowpox lesion from the arm ofa local milk maid and applied it to the skin of an eight year old boy. Eightweeks later Jenner exposed the boy to smallpox. The child remained well becausecowpox was similar enough to smallpox to stimulate a cross-immunity.According to Medicine: A Treasury of Art and Literature: “Jenner (1749–1823)possessed acute powers of observation that were usually spent bird-watching, andhe gained admission to the Royal Society of London through a paper onornithology. He noted that the bowed, broad back of a fledgling cuckoo fortwelve days formed the perfect nest for the egg of the hedge sparrow, ready tohatch when the cuckoo was ready to fly. The story of the milk maid Sarah Nelmesand Jenner’s vaccine guinea pig, James Phipps is well known. Less familiar isJenner’s attribution of cowpox to ‘grease’ and groomsmen.”Over the next few years, Jenner published further experiments, supplying thecowpox “vaccine” and promoting his vaccination techniques to physicians aroundthe world:The deviation of man from the state in which he was originally placed by natureseems to have proved to him a prolific source of diseases. From the love ofsplendor, from the indulgence of luxury, and from his fondness for amusement hehas familiarized himself with a great number of animals, which may notoriginally have been intended for his associates.The wolf, disarmed of ferocity, is now pillowed in the lady’s lap. The cat, thelittle tiger of our island, whose natural home is the forest, is equallydomesticated and caressed. The cow, the hog, the sheep, and the horse, are all,for a variety of purposes, brought under his care and dominion.There is a disease to which the horse, from his state of domestication, isfrequently subject. The farriers call it the “grease.” It is an inflammation andswelling in the heel, from which issues matter possessing properties of a verypeculiar kind, which seems capable of generating disease in the human body(after it has undergone the modification which I shall presently speak of),which bears so strong a resemblance to the smallpox that I think it highlyprobable it may be the source of the disease.In this dairy country a great number of cows are kept, and the office of milkingis performed indiscriminately by men and maid servants. One of the former havingbeen appointed to apply dressings to the heels of a horse affected with grease,and not paying due attention to cleanliness, incautiously bears his part inmilking cows, with come particles of the infectious matter adhering to hisfingers. When this is the case, it commonly happens that a disease iscommunicated to the cows, and from the cows to dairy maids, which spreadsthrough the farm until the most of the cattle and domestics feel its unpleasantconsequences. This disease has obtained the name of cow-pox. It appears on thenipples of the cows in the form of irregular pustules. At their first appearancethey are commonly of a palish blue, or rather of a colour somewhat approachingto livid, and are surrounded by an erysipelous inflammation. These pustules,unless a timely remedy be applied, frequently degenerate into phagedenic ulcers,which prove extremely troublesome. The animals become indisposed, and thesecretion of milk is much lessened. Inflamed spots now begin to appear ondifferent parts of the hands of the domestics employed in milking, and sometimeson the wrists, which quickly run on to suppuration, first assuming the smallvesications produced by a burn.Most commonly they appear about the joints of the fingers and at theirextremities; but whatever parts are affected, if the situation will admit, thesesuperficial suppurations put on a circular form, with their edges more elevatedthan their centre, and of a colour distantly approaching to blue. Absorptiontakes place, and tumours appear in each axilla. The system becomes affected— thepulse is quickened; and shiverings, succeeded by heat, with general lassitudeand pains about the loins and limbs, with vomiting, come on. The head ispainful, and the patient is now and then even affected with delirium.These symptoms, varying in their degrees of violence, generally continue fromone day to three or four, leaving ulcerated sores about the hands, which, fromthe sensibility of the parts, are very troublesome, and commonly heal slowly,frequently becoming phagedenic, like those from whence they sprung. The lips,nostrils, eyelids, and other parts of the body are sometimes affected withsores; but these evidently arise from their being heedlessly rubbed or scratchedwith the patient’s infected fingers. No eruptions on the skin have followed thedecline of the feverish symptoms in any instance that has come to my inspection,one only excepted, and in this case a very few appeared on the arms: they werevery minute, of a vivid red colour, and soon died away without advancing tomaturation; so that I cannot determine whether they had any connection with thepreceding symptoms.Thus the disease makes its progress from the horse to the nipple of the cow, andfrom the cow to the human subject.Morbid matter of various kinds, when absorbed into the system, may produceeffects in some degree similar; but what renders the cow-pox virus so extremelysingular is that the person who has been thus affected is forever after securefrom the infection of the smallpox; neither exposure to the variolous effluvia,nor the insertion of the matter into the skin, producing this distemper.The more accurately to observe the progress of the infection I selected ahealthy boy, about eight years old, for the purpose of inoculating for the cowpox. The matter was taken from a sore on the hand of a dairymaid, who wasinfected by her master’s cows, and it was inserted on the 14th day of May, 1796,into the arm of the boy by means of two superficial incisions, barelypenetrating the cutis, each about an inch long.On the seventh day he complained of uneasiness in the axilla and on the ninth hebecame a little chilly, lost his appetite, and had a slight headache. During thewhole of this day he was perceptibly indisposed, and spent the night with somedegree of restlessness, but on the day following he was perfectly well.The appearance of these incisions in their progress to a state of maturationwere much the same as when produced in a similar manner by variolous matter. Thedifference which I perceived was in the state of the limpid fluid arising fromthe action of the virus, which assumed rather a darker hue, and in that of theefflorescence spreading round the incisions, which had more of an erysipelatouslook than we commonly perceive when variolous matter has been made use of in thesame manner; but the whole died away (leaving on the inoculated parts scabs andsubsequent eschars) without giving me or my patient the least trouble.In order to ascertain whether the boy, after feeling so slight an affection ofthe system from the cow-pox virus, was secure from the contagion of thesmallpox, he was inoculated the 1st of July following with variolous matter,immediately taken from a pustule. Several slight punctures and incisions weremade on both his arms, and the matter was carefully inserted, but no diseasefollowed. The same appearances were observable on the arms as we commonly seewhen a patient has had variolous matter applied, after having either the cow-poxor smallpox. Several months afterwards he was again inoculated with variolousmatter, but no sensible effect was produced on the constitution.Vaccination with cowpox became mandatory in Bavaria, Denmark, and in Prussia andBritain in 1853. Some American states also began to require the vaccination withcowpox by mid-century.Jenner’s vaccination concept was an important step toward reducing the globalthreat of infectious diseases. Vaccination made early childhood safer.In the 1960s, worldwide health organizations promoted a campaign to eradicatesmallpox epidemics. The last natural case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in1977, and the World Health Assembly certified the eradication of smallpox in1980.PASTEUR’S REMARKABLE WORK ON THE VACCINE FOR RABIESLouis Pasteur (1822–1895) was the first to connect alcoholic fermentation to themetabolism of yeast rather than “spontaneous generation;” however, it was hiswork with silk worm diseases, anthrax epidemics, and his high profile and widelypublicized work with rabies that immortalized him. On March 1, 1886 Pasteurpresented the promising results of his development of the treatment of a rabiesvaccine for humans to the French Academy of Sciences and called for a creationof a rabies vaccine center, initiating the founding of the Pasteur Institute.His 1885 experiment to vaccinate humans with a vaccine created for dogs was adecision made at considerable legal risk and danger to his career:We announced a positive advance in the study of rabies in the papers appearingunder my own name and under the names of my fellow-workers; this was a method ofprevention of the disease. The evidence was acceptable to the scientific mind,but had not been given practical demonstration. Accidents were liable to occurin its application.Of twenty dogs treated, I could not render more than fifteen or sixteenrefractory to rabies. Further, it was desirable, at the end of the treatment, toinoculate with a very virulent virus—a control virus—in order to confirm andreinforce the refractory condition. More than this, prudence demanded that thedogs should be kept under the observation during a period longer than the periodof incubation of the disease produced by the direct inoculation of this lastvirus. Therefore, in order to be quite sure that the refractory state had beenproduced, it was sometimes necessary to wait three or four months. Theapplication of the method would have been very much limited by these troublesomeconditions.Another objection was that the method did not lend itself easily to theemergency treatment rendered necessary by the accidental and unforeseen way inwhich bites are inflicted by rabid animals.It was necessary, therefore, to discover, if possible, a more rapid method.Otherwise who would have the temerity, before this progress had been achieved,to make any experiment on man?After making almost innumerable experiments, I have discovered a prophylacticmethod which is practical and prompt, and which has already in dogs afforded meresults sufficiently numerous, certain and successful, to warrant my havingconfidence in its general applicability to all animals, and even to man himself.This method depends essentially on the following facts:The inoculation of the infective spinal cord of a dog suffering from ordinaryrabies under the dura mater of a rabbit, always produces rabies after a periodof incubation having a mean duration of about fifteen days.If, by the above method of inoculation, the virus of the first rabbit is passedinto a second, and that of the second into a third, and so on, in series, a moreand more striking tendency is soon manifested towards a diminution of theduration of the incubation period of rabies in the rabbits successivelyinoculated.After passing twenty or twenty-five times from rabbit to rabbit, inoculationperiods of eight days are met with, and continue for another interval, duringwhich the virus is passed twenty of twenty-five times from rabbit to rabbit.Then an incubation period of seven days is reached, which is encountered withstriking regularity throughout a new series extending as far as the ninetiethanimal. This at least is the number which I have reached at the present time,and the most that can be said is that a slight tendency is manifested towards anincubation period of a little less than seven days.Experiments of this class, begun in November, 1882, have now lasted for threeyears without any break in the continuity of the series, and without our everbeing obliged to have recourse to any other virus than that of the rabbitssuccessfully dead of rabies. Consequently, nothing is easier than to haveconstantly at our disposal, over considerable intervals of time, a virus ofrabies, quite pure, and always quite or very nearly identical. This is thecentral fact in the practical application of the method.The virus of rabies at a constant degree of virulence is contained in the spinalcords of these rabbits throughout their whole extent.If portions, a few centimeters long, are removed from these spinal cords withevery possible precaution to preserve their purity, and are then suspended indry air, the virulence slowly disappears, until at last, it entirely vanishes.The time within which this extinction of virulence is brought about varies alittle with the thickness of the morsels of spinal cord, but chiefly it isrelated to the external temperature. The lower the environmental temperature thelonger is the virulence preserved. These results constitute the centralscientific point in the method.These facts being established, a dog may be rendered refractory to rabies in arelatively short time in the following way: Every day morsels of fresh infectivespinal cord from a rabbit which had died of rabies developed after an incubationof seven days, are suspended in a series of flasks, the air in which is kept dryby placing fragments of potash at the bottom of the flask. Every day also a dogis inoculated under the skin with a Pravaz syringe full of sterilized broth, inwhich a small fragment of one of the spinal cords has been broken up, commencingwith a spinal cord far enough removed in order of time from the day of theoperation to render it certain that the cord was not at all virulent. (This datehad been ascertained by previous experiments.) On the following days the sameoperation is performed with more recent cords, separated from each other by aninterval of two days, until at last, a very virulent cord, which has only beenin the flask for two days, is used.The dog has now been rendered refractory to rabies. It may be inoculated withthe virus of rabies under the skin, or even after trephining, on the surface ofthe brain, without any subsequent development of rabies.Never having once failed when using this method, I had in my possession fiftydogs, of all ages and of every race, refractory to rabies, when threeindividuals from Alsace unexpectedly presented themselves at my laboratory, onMonday the 6th of last July.Theodore Vone, grocer of Meissengott, near Schlestadt, bitten in the arm July4th by his own dog, which had gone mad.Joseph Meister, aged 9 years, also bitten on July 4th at eight o’clock in themorning by the same dog. This child had been knocked over by the dog andpresented numerous bites on the hands, legs, and thighs, some of them so deep asto render walking difficult. The principal bites had been cauterized at eighto’clock in the evening of July 4th, only twelve hours after the accident, withphenic acid, by Dr. Weber, of Ville.The third person, who had not been bitten, was the mother of little JosephMeister.At the examination of the dog, after its death by the hand of its master, thestomach was found full of hay, straw, and scraps of wood. The dog was certainlyrabid. Joseph Meister had been pulled out from under him covered with foam andblood.M. Vone had some severe contusions on the arm, but he assured me that his shirthad not been pierced by the dog’s fangs. As he had nothing to fear, I told himthat he could return to Alsace the same day, which he did. But I kept youngMeister and his mother with me.The weekly meeting of the Academie des Sciences took place on July 6th. At it Imet our colleague Dr. Vulpian, to whom I related what had just happened. M.Vulpian, and Dr. Grancher, Professor in the Faculté de Médecine, had thegoodness to come and see little Joseph Meister at once, and to take note of thecondition and the number of his wounds. There were no less than fourteen.The opinion of our learned colleague, and of Dr. Grancher, was that, owing tothe severity and the number of the bites, Joseph Meister was almost certain totake rabies. I then communicated to M. Vulpian and to M. Grancher the newresults which I had obtained from the study of rabies since the address which Ihad given at Copenhagen a year earlier.The death of this child appearing to be inevitable, I decided, not withoutlively and sore anxiety, as may well be believed, to try upon Joseph Meister themethod which I had found constantly successful with dogs. . . .Consequently, on July 6th, at 8 o’clock in the evening, sixty hours after thebites on July 4th, and in the presence of Drs. Vupian and Grancher, youngMeister was inoculated under a fold of skin raised in the right hypochondrium,with half a Pravaz syringeful of the spinal cord of a rabbit, which had died ofrabies on June 21st. It had been preserved since then, that is to say, fifteendays in a flask of dry air.In the following days fresh inoculations were made. I thus made thirteeninoculations, and prolonged the treatment to ten days. I shall say later on thata smaller number of inoculations would have been sufficient. But it will beunderstood how, in the first attempt, I would act with a very specialcircumspection . . .On the last days, therefore, I had inoculated Joseph Meister with the mostvirulent virus of rabies, that namely, of the dog, reinforced by passing a greatnumber of times from rabbit to rabbit, a virus which produces rabies after sevendays incubation in these animals, after eight to ten days in dogs. . . .Joseph Meister, therefore, has escaped, not only the rabies which would havebeen caused by the bites he received, but also the rabies with which I haveinoculated him in order to test the immunity produced by the treatment, a rabiesmore virulent than ordinary canine rabies.The final inoculation with very virulent virus has this further advantage inthat it puts a period to the apprehensions which rise as to the consequences ofthe bites. If rabies could occur it would declare itself more quickly after amore virulent virus than after the virus of bites. Since the middle of August Ihave looked forward with confidence to the future good health of Joseph Meister.At the present time, three months and three weeks have elapsed since the attackand bites, his state of health leaves nothing to be desired . . ..THE SEARCH FOR A VACCINE FOR POLIOIn the mid–1800s, polio began to appear: in 1835 in the UK, in 1841 inLouisiana, in 1844 on the island of St. Helena, and between the 1880s and 1890sin Scandinavia. Through the next 50 years polio in its paralytic form spreadthrough Europe and the United States.The clinical path of polio was different than the epidemics of the plague,cholera, typhus, and typhoid fever. It killed few, but left many paralyzed anddisabled. Polio was a new and confusing epidemic causing parents to keep theirchildren inside rather than leaving them to play outside.In 1908 polio was proven to be caused by a virus that primarily afflicted thecentral nervous system. By 1910, polio was recognized as a serious healththreat. In 1916 the reports of polio increased by 400 percent. New York Cityalone reported 9,000 infected children that produced 2,343 deaths.Investigations showed that before the 1980s children throughout the world hadbeen infected with a mild non-paralytic strain of polio virus that produced animmunity to the more aggressive strains of the virus. By the early part of the20th century public health projects in the industrialized world reduced theexposure to the polio virus by putting chlorine in public and private swimmingpools and water supplies. These conditions produced the paradox that childrencoming from well-scrubbed middle class communities were more likely to beinfected by the aggressive paralytic strains of the polio virus than those kidswho were raised in less desireable, congested, and low income neighborhoods.At the time, the standard method of viral propagation for vaccine production wasin chicken eggs and non-human primates. Initially it was felt that a successfulpolio vaccine would require a recipe that contained more than one strain of thevirus. A loose typing committee was formed that included both Jonas Salk andAlbert Sabin to identify the various strains of the polio virus. Both Salk andSabin were already working on polio vaccines. Salk was in favor of using killedviruses, and Sabin was in favor of employing attenuated or weakened virus.In 1948, during one of the gatherings of the typing committee, Salk ventured tosuggest that the public would be better served if the committee got on withproducing vaccines and increasing the general population’s immunity to the virusrather than trying to understand the various strains of the polio virus:I was suggesting that our purposes might be better served by testing an unknownvirus’s capacity to immunize, rather than worrying about its capacity to infect.Albert Sabin sat back and turned to me and said, “Now, Dr. Salk, you should knowbetter than to ask a question like that.’ It was like being kicked in the teeth.I had offered an oblique challenge to one of the assumptions, you see, and now Iwas being put in my place. I could feel the resistance and the hostility and thedisapproval. I never attended a single one of those meetings afterward withoutthat same feeling.In 1948 John Enders, an American virologist working at Harvard UniversityMedical School, developed a method for growing the polio virus in human cellcultures, which eliminated the need for non-human primates for vaccineproduction and of greater importence the cultured virus lost its capacity toproduce the clinical form of polio. In 1954 Dr. Enders and two of his students,Thomas Weller and Frederick Robbins, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiologyand medicine.THE AIDS EPIDEMICIn the 1980s, the medical community recognized that “there was a new virus intown,” a new epidemic that destroyed the host’s immune system. Over a period of20 years, 16 million humans perished from the infection and an additional 33million had developed a chronic infection of what was soon to be identified asHIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that produced AIDS (AcquiredImmunodeficiency Deficiency Syndrome).On June 5th, 1981, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), reported in itsjournal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, that five young male homosexualshad been diagnosed with a type of pneumonia usually associated with immunedeficiency. A month later, the CDC published a follow-up report that described26 cases of Kaposi’s sarcoma in 26 homosexually active males. These tumors werecommon occurrences in organ transplant patients being given immune suppressivedrugs. By May 1985, 10,000 active cases of AIDS were reported. Most of theinfected individuals died within two years after diagnosis.The isolation of the HIV virus was reported in 1983 independently by twodifferent laboratories which produced an ongoing war between the twolaboratories for decades.Robert Gallo, an American, was one of the discoverers. He worked for theNational Cancer Institute which is a member organization of the NationalInstitutes of Health referred to the controversy between the two groups as “anacrimonious controversy involving legal, moral, ethical, and societal questionsthat soon spilled over into the world of scientific research and threatened topoison relationships between scientists, as well as between the researchcommunity and the general public.”Luc Montagnier, a respected member of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who laterbecame the director of the Center for Molecular and Cellular Biology at QueensCollege in New York, was Gallo’s scientific opponent.It eventually was agreed upon by both the Gallo and the Montagnier camps thatthe AIDS virus was passed on through infected blood and body fluids. Gallocreated a test to identify subclinical carriers of the AIDS virus, but theFrench group refused to use it as a screening test for the safety of transfusedblood which resulted in the death of more than 300 hemophilia patients that hadbeen given contaminated blood. These events led to criminal trials in Francethat resulted in the convictions and imprisonment of four heathcare employees.Eventually, Jonas Salk, Peter Duesberg, Michigan Congressman John Dingell, theOffice of Inspector General at the U.S Department of Health and Human Services,and various news reporters, including John Crewdson of the Chicago Tribune andJon Cohen of Science magazine, jumped into the AIDS war.While all of this controversy over the cause of AIDS, and who was going to getcredit for isolating the virus and share in the royalties generated by the bloodtests was grinding on, few if anyone recognized the breaking research of Dr.Will Taylor, associate professor in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry in theCollege of Pharmacy, from the University of Georgia at Athens, Georgia.Through a detailed analysis of the genetic code of the human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), Dr. Taylor and his group discovered new viral genes. A translationof the genetic message in several of these genes showed that the proteins theyencode have a requirement for the trace mineral selenium. Dr. Taylor’s analysisshowed that one of these proteins could be a regulatory protein that acts as amaster switch that would control the replication of HIV—a switch that could beregulated with selenium supplementation.Dr. Taylor theorized that the supplementation of selenium could then slow theprogression of AIDS, by reducing its replication rate and aggressive cellinvasion. This would explain the long and highly variable latency period betweenHIV infection and AIDS, the declining selenium status of HIV-positive and AIDSpatients, the route of transmission of HIV, and why some HIV-positive patientshave never developed AIDS even after ten years.Dr. Taylor demonstrated quite clearly that supplementation of the trace mineralselenium could prevent the HIV virus from mutating into clinical AIDS.Over a ten-year period Dr. Gerhard Schrauzer spent great efforts to educate HIVand AIDS researchers of the potential benefits of selenium supplementation inHIV and AIDS patients. Schrauzer has published several arguments on themechanism of how selenium could work on retroviral systems."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENPRIONSThe earth is not flat, the sun does not rotate around the earth, and prionscannot be infectious if they cannot satisfy Koch’s postulates! Continuing todefend the theory that BSE and CJD are caused by and transmitted by prions isakin to defending the theory that “life and disease are the result ofspontaneous generation”!—Dr. Joel D. WallachLecture Series, AD 2000Viruses are small, simple nucleic acid molecules. They are giants compared to“viroids” which are small molecules of naked circular RNA that typically infectplants. Viroids are only several nucleotides long. Viroids do not encodeproteins but can replicate in host plant cells by using the hosts cellularenzymes. The RNA molecule of the viroid disrupts the metabolism of the planthost and stunts the verticle growth of the plant. One viroid disease in coconutpalms from the Philippines has killed more than ten thousand trees.There is a theory that supports the existence of an infectious protein that arecalled “prions.” Prions are theorized to cause a variety of degenerative brainand spinal cord diseases in vertebrate animals including “scrapie” in sheep, madcow disease in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.One theory poses that a prion is a mis-folded form of a protein normally foundin brain cells. Stanley Prusiner was awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize for his prionresearch. However, there is not general acceptance that a prion is an infectiousprotein that can produce disease by itself because this theory remainscontroversial.In the late 19th century enzootic ataxia was a common disease in Australianlambs and adult sheep. The disease was first scientifically described andpublished in the Australian veterinary journals in 1932. The disease ischaracterized by poor coordination, weakness, and demyelinating lesions in thespinal cord. This has been reported in Western Australia, South Australia, andVictoria.In addition to neurological symptoms and lesions found in enzootic ataxia, thereis also a loss of wool quality known as “straight steely” wool. Furtherinvestigation showed that sheep producing steely wool were in fact showingclinical effects of a copper deficiency. It was also demonstrated that breedingewes with steely wool resulted in lambs being born with enzootic ataxia. Infact, maps have been created that have documented effects of copper deficiency,such as ataxia in lambs, steely wool in adult sheep, and copper deficiency inplants.Copper deficiency enzootic ataxia can present in lambs from the time of birth toabout four months of age. In England most of the lambs have been afflicted atbirth, but some do not show ataxia symptoms until two weeks up to six weeks ofage.Bovine spongiform encephalitis, popularly known as BSE (Bovine SpongioformEncephalitis) or “Mad Cow Disease,” is believed to be transmitted from oneanimal to the next and to humans by an infectious “agent” referred to as aprion. In humans, the disease was originally known as Kuru (thought to be passedon from one human to the next by the practice of mortuary cannibalism) orCreutzfeldt-Jacob Disease when acquired by eating “contaminated beef.”The normal cellular form of prion protein (PrPc) is generally thought to be aprecursor to the pathogenic protease-resistant forms (PrPsc) believed to causescrapie (thought to be a long incubation viral encephalopathy of sheep), bovinespongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and Creuttzfeldt-Jacob disease in humans. Itsamino acid terminus contains the octapeptide PHGGGWGQ, which is repeated fourtimes and is among the best-preserved regions of mammalian PrPc.The amino-terminal domain of PrPc exhibits five to six sites that bind copper(Cu(II)) presented as a glycine chelate. At neutral pH, binding occurs withpositive cooperativity, with binding affinity compatible with estimates forextracellular, labile copper. Two lines of independently derived PrPcgene-ablated (Prnp o/o) mice exhibit severe reductions in the copper content ofmembrane-enriched brain extracts and similar reductions in synaptosomal andendosome-enriched subcellular fractions.Despite the mass of accumulated biochemical and structural informationdescribing prions, Koch’s Postulates have not been fulfilled becausetransmission attempts from positively diagnosed cattle and humans to susceptiblespecies have universally failed. BSE and CJD are therefore copper deficiencydiseases and are not infectious diseases!Most reported cases of BSE in cattle are reported in the United Kingdom in thesouthern one third of the island and predominantly in dairy cattle. Now, howdoes an infectious organism determine which cow is a dairy cow and which cow isa beef cow? Attempts to satisfy Koch’s postulates for BSE and CJD have beenabysmal failures—literally thousands of attempts were performed by juicing thebrains of “infected” cattle and injecting them into the brains of healthy cattlewith no positive signs of transmission. Extracts of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Diseasebrains from “infected” humans have been injected into primates, includingchimpanzees and monkeys, and these attempts have failed to transmit the disease.Thus they have failed to satisfy Koch’s postulates.It is obvious that the brain lesions in sheep afflicted with enzootic ataxia, aknown copper-deficiency disease, are identical to the brain lesions in cattleafflicted with BSE and also to the brain lesions in humans afflicted with CJD.The preponderance of the cases of BSE in cattle and CJD in humans are typicallydiagnosed in geographical areas where the soils are copper deficient.It is also common for humans with CJD to be afflicted with concurrent copperdeficiency signs, symptoms, and diseases, for example with white, gray, orsilver hair and vitaligo, wrinkles, connective tissue disease, anemia,hypothyroidism, spider veins, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, and aneurysms.Continuing to defend the theory that BSE and CJD are caused by and transmittedby prions is akin to defending the theory that scurvy and pellagra were causedby germs, and that life and disease are caused by spontaneous generation!"},{"pageContent":"PART3The Birth, Development, and Expression of the Genetic Theory of Life, Diseaseand Death"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTDARWIN AND MENDELIn biology, Darwin and Mendel came to define the 19th century as the era ofevolution and genetics; Watson and Crick defined the 20th century as the era ofDNA (and the double helix), and the functional understanding of how genetics andevolution interact. But in the 21st century it is the new scientific disciplineof epigenetics that is unraveling so much of what we took as dogma andrebuilding it in an infinitely more varied, more complex and even more beautifulfashion.—Nessa Carey, PhDUniversity of EdinburghThere was, it is true, a moment early in the twentieth century when it seemedpossible that Darwinism might be toppled. As Mendel and his theory of geneticswere rediscovered, spread rapidly, and were accepted and enlarged upon, somethought that genetics was incompatible with Darwin. But after the First WorldWar, Ronald Fisher showed that it was possible to reconcile Darwin and Mendel.Indeed, said Fisher, “Mendelism supplied the missing parts of the structureerected by Darwin.” Darwin showed the what of evolution and the why, of naturalselection. Now Mendel had produced the how, genetics. This was reinforced whenHermann Joseph Muller showed that genes are artificially mutable. Thanks toFisher and Muller and others, such as J. B. S. Haldane, by the 1930s,Darwin-Mendelism was triumphant. The way was then open for James Watson andFrancis Crick to discover the double helix structure of DNA. So on to the genomeand the present infinite possibilities of the science.—Paul JohnsonDarwin: Portrait of a GeniusAll agree that no other scientific theory in history has created as much debateand controversy as Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. Prior to Darwin’stheory, the prevailing belief was that the planet Earth was 6,000 years old andthat the various species on Earth had no relationship to one another. It wasthought that humans were unique and superior to all other organisms and thatplant and animal physiology had no relationship to human physiology.THE LIFE AND WORK OF CHARLES DARWINCharles Darwin’s paternal grandfather, Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), finishedCambridge and then trained as a physician in Edinburgh and set up a successfulpractice in Litchfield. Stories of his skills as a physician reached the courtof King George III, who invited him to London to become the royal doctor. Dr.Darwin chose not to accept this offer since he was content with his successfulpractice and his hobbies of poetry and science. The symbol of Dr. Darwin’s broadinterests was his coach, which he personally designed. It contained a writingdesk, a skylight, and a portion of his library, thus furthering his intellectualinterests while traveling on his professional rounds.Dr. Erasmus Darwin’s mind was “omnivorous.” He was interested in basic scienceand he constructed a personal maxim: “Any man who never conducts an experimentis a fool.” He read widely, in French as well as English, and two of hisfavorite writers were Buffon and Lamarck, who were early supporters of thetheory of evolution. He spent time with and wrote frequently with Rousseau. Heattended brain storming sessions with industrialists and inventors, includingWatt and Boulton, and his deep scientific interests included botany and animalstudies.With success as a physician he was able to purchase a small acreage and plantedan eight-acre experimental garden He wrote and published a two-part poem titledThe Botanical Garden, covering “The Economy of Vegetation” and “The Loves of thePlants.”The poem was well received and highly praised by Horace Walpole and translatedinto French, Italian, and Portuguese. He broadened the readership of his poem ina prose work, Phytologia; or, The Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening(1799), which is full of speculation concerning the generative life of plants.It was, however, his report entitled Zoonomia, Or The Laws of Organic Life(1794–96), that is his crowning glory for contributions to science. In it heposited an expanded theory on the age of the earth that was a generation beforeCharles Lyell’s geological studies established a theoretical geological age, andDarwin theorized accurately on the successive phases of life that emerged and onits “essential unity.” He wrote: “As the earth and ocean were probably peopledwith vegetable productions long before the existence of animals, and manyfamilies of these animals long before other families of them, shall weconjecture that one and the same kind of living filaments is and has been thecause of all organic life?”The term “living filament” was a profound utterance in 1794, although surelyErasmus Darwin had probably used the term for many years before he put it to thepen. His use of the term “filament” shows that he was aware of the physicalanatomy of the chromosome—as a double helix filament! He had never heard theterm “genetics,” but he knew that information was being passed on from onegeneration to the next.Erasmus Darwin was married two times and had three sons by his first wife. Thefirst son became a top medical student at Edinburgh but died from an infectionreceived while dissecting in the anatomy laboratory; the second was aflourishing lawyer, but unfortunately committed suicide. The third son, Robert,attended Edinburgh, graduated as a physician and practiced in Shrewsbury, andbecame one of the wealthiest general practitioners of medicine in England. Hewas a man who traveled in academic circles and was a Fellow of the RoyalSociety. This man was the father of Charles Darwin. Erasmus Darwin had four sonsand three daughters, His daughter, Violetta, married Tertius Galton and gavebirth to Francis Galton, a polymath of genius who designed the science ofeugenics.Eugenics was a concept where one could by “selective breeding” accelerateevolution and produce a race of super humans. This pursuit eventually became adouble-edged sword.Joseph Priestley, one of Erasmus Darwin’s friends, was a minister and theologiandescribed as an Arminian, socinian, and an atheist. He was most widely known forhis research as an experimental chemist and as the discoverer of oxygen.On occasion, Priestley’s writings were publically burned, but his person hadnever been attacked until the onset of the French Revolution. In a weak,thoughtless moment, he described his political views in Letters, published in1790, as “Grains of Gunpowder” for which his opponents were “providing thematch.” This caused his friends and enemies alike to refer to Priestley as“Gunpowder Priestly.” It was a time of “Constitutional Societies” that wereestablished to support the French Revolution and agitate for similar reforms inEngland. Conversely, there were Church-and-King organizations created to opposethem.On July 14, 1791, Priestley was invited to address a meeting in Birmingham tocommemorate the anniversary of the Fall of the Bastille. He was warned of thepossibility of a personal attack so he turned down the invitation. When theylearned that Priestley had cancelled, a Church-and-King mob surrounded his houseat Fairhill near Birmingham and burned it, destroying nearly all of his books,scientific apparatus, and papers.Priestley escaped with his life, however. Order was not restored for three daysand four rioters were hanged. Priestley received compensation and supportershelped him resettle in London.Priestley never felt safe again, and in 1794 he packed all of his belongings andmoved to New York. The attack on Priestley and enforced exile of Priestleybecame a defining event in the Darwin family and in the lives of theirdissenting and unorthodox friends.Charles Darwin was severely affected by this and became more defensive than hisgrandfather and his father. What terrified Charles Darwin was the religiousaspect of the attack on Priestley by the Church-and-King mob. It left Darwinwith a high awareness and lifetime fear of the possible results of offending the“tender consciences of Church of England clergymen, who might then be inspiredto stir up a mob to burn and kill.”Tales of the cry of the mob, who were said to have called out “Nophilosophers—Church and King forever!” and “Burn the atheists!” continued toecho in his mind and fray his nerves. These events contaminated his life andwork at a level of concern that had unrelenting consequences.Dr. Robert Darwin, father of Charles, was a man of strong intellect. The forceof his medical skill came from his intuitive penetration during which he usedvisual and observational powers and probed subjects with pin-pointed questions.Essentially, his diagnostic technique was the same as that used by Dr. JosephBell, the famous surgeon who mentored the young physician Arthur Conan Doyle,who went on to create the character of Sherlock Holmes.Robert Darwin’s genius was inspired by his immediate and personal physicalcontact with the patient, on the first visit, during the first diagnosis, andwhich continued on subsequent visits and at every stage of the course of thecondition. With these methods Dr. Robert Darwin came to intimately understanddisease. It is said that he looked into and through his patients and was able toinspire in them, almost without exception, a confidence in his capacity to curethem in a manner that was widely considered miraculous. After completing hismedical studies in Leyden, he began his medical practice at the age of twentyand was an immediate success—his first year’s fees supported a servant and twohorses, and his practice grew every year for sixty years.Dr. Robert Darwin abhorred many of the injurious practices of the medicalcommunity, for instance, the use of blistering (topical application of liquidmercury) as well as purging (oral dosing of liquid mercury), and bleeding(bloodletting). In fact he hated the sight of blood, “a horror that he passed onto his son.” It is said that the best doctors in the early nineteenth centurywere those who physically did least, and Robert Darwin was one of them. As analternative he provided wisdom and sensibility.Charles Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, at The Mount in Shrewsbury, thesubstantial house his father had built. It was “a vintage year for great men—also born were, Tennyson and Gladstone, and Lincoln.” Napoleon cast a giantshadow over Europe and Madison was being inaugurated as the fourth president ofthe United States.Charles Darwin had a happy and favored childhood. He loved and respected hisfather, and he grew up in the magical environs of his father’s house, gardensand fields. His family life was well-organized and many servants pampered him.Darwin was born a gentleman when the term had a social meaning and a legalstatus as a lord and land holder.Darwin’s uncle, Josiah Wedgewood II, purchased a 1,000 acre estate at Maer inStaffordshire. This estate was the breeding ground of Darwin’s fascination withriding, shooting, and collecting. The British game laws were strict andrigorously enforced, and one had to be a landholder to shoot wildlife. Darwin’sfamily status allowed him to shoot and hunt, a practice he greatly enjoyed.Darwin wrote, “I became passionately fond of shooting & I do not believe thatanyone could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did forshooting birds.”Darwin distained cruelty, yet shooting for sport and collection of birdscultivated his interest in science. He dropped hunting as a sport in his earlyforties, although he continued his hunting to catch, kill, and dissect largenumbers of insects, invertebrates, birds, and animals in his thirst forknowledge.The 1809 news that would have been of the most interest to the adult Darwin wasthe news that a naturalist and artist, John James Audubon, had successfullybanded pewees near Pittsburgh, proving that migratory birds return to nest tothe very place where they were hatched.In 1831 the British naturalist Charles Darwin embarked on his famous voyage onthe H.M.S. Beagle that took him around the world for the purpose of documentingand cataloging new species. Darwin returned to England in 1836 and begancompiling his observations into a book.One of his more interesting observations was when Darwin sailed the Beagle tothe east coast of South America in 1833. He recorded a fine red dustaccumulating on his ship each day and correctly deduced that the dust hadoriginated in west Africa. This African dust in its westerly flight travels allthe way to the rainforests in the Amazon where it is essential to the annualreplenishment of the rain-leached, mineral-poor soils of the rainforests.Man has always realized the enormity of the great and tireless power of theearth’s winds; however, their importance to the biological vitality of the earthand the mineral value of our food is far beyond a level that we have everdreamed. There are many wind currents, east to west, which transport great loadson mineral-laden dust across predictable routes, “linking ecosystems hundredsand even thousands of miles apart.” Billions of tons of mineral-rich dust fromthe deserts of Asia and Africa fertilize oceans and rainforests halfway aroundthe world. Columbus knew of these winds and used them to drive his ships intothe New World, but it was Darwin who knew that the windborne minerals fertilizedthe world.Michael Garstang, professor of meteorology at the University of Virginia inCharlottesville, stated, “During the violent Amazonian rainstorms, theparticulates that originate in the African deserts are literally sucked out ofthe sky.” Garstang and his colleagues calculate that 13,000,000 tons of Africanand Asian mineral-rich dust invigorates the depleted and rain leached Amazoniansoils each rainy season.The wind-borne African dust adds essential minerals to help maintain therainforests productivity. “While the Amazon Basin teems with life, the soilitself lacks reserves of nutrients, especially phosphates, which spur plantgrowth. The historical record shows that the Amazon rainforest periodicallyshrunk to a fraction of its 20th century size, then rebounded again, and theresearchers now believe that it expands and contracts as the volume of Africandust waxes and wanes with mirror changes in the Sahara Desert.”When there was a draught in Africa, the resultant dust fertilized and expandedthe oceans and the Amazon forests. When there was great rainfall in Africa thereduction in dust volume caused the ocean fauna and the Amazon forests’ biomassto contract.The observations of numerous individuals in the early 19th century led to atheory that came to be known as the “cell theory”—the idea that cells are thebuilding blocks of all life.When Germans Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann presented their findings in1838, the science and practice of biology changed forever.According to the cell theory, cells are the smallest forms of life and allliving organisms are composed of cells. Furthermore, only pre-existing cells cancreate cells—new cells do not arise spontaneously or come from another source.Schleiden based his research on the work of Scottish botanist Robert Brown, whohad discovered the cell nucleus. It was Schleiden, however, who understood thetrue importance of the nucleus and its role in the development of the completecell. At the same time, Schwann was studying animal cells and trying to work outa puzzle: why did certain structures in animal and plant cells look so similar?It was Schleiden’s observations of the nucleus that gave the biologist theanswer. As both plant and animal cells contain a nucleus, Schleiden postulatedthat cells must be the building blocks of life.The primary difference between plant and animal cells is that animal cells haveflexible walls allowing for malleability and different shapes while plant cellshave rigid walls. Also, the chloroplasts in plant cells enable the plants toutilize the sun’s light energy to activate photosynthesis, the process thatextracts C02 from the atmosphere to generate carbon chains and carbon-basedsubstances, such as carbohydrates, sugars, vitamins, amino acids, and fattyacids.Charles Darwin published his life’s work and observations in his book, On theOrigin of Species by Means of Natural Selection in 1859 (the title of the sixthedtion of 1872 was changed to The Origin of Species). Darwin surmised that alllife on Earth is related by a process of inheritance—a conclusion he arrived atafter years of traveling the world studying plants and animals.Darwin understood that individual organisms vary widely in their capacity tosurvive and reproduce. An example would be that a sudden drop in environmentaltemperature occurs, and most individuals of a species die from hypothermiabecause they can’t tolerate a precipitous drop in temperature. But individualsof that species that can tolerate a rapid drop in temperature survive, reproduceand flourish. As long as the ability to adapt to rapid temperature drops isheritable, the trait is passed on to future generations, and greater numbers ofindividuals inherit the trait and one variation of the original population willflourish and increase in numbers.When various populations of a species are separated and isolated by distance orgeographical barriers of mountains, rivers, islands, deserts, and so forth, theyare faced with a wide and different variety of catastrophic events. After longperiods of time, such as decades or centuries, the individuals with commonancestors that have acquired the traits necessary to survive through heritance,will eventually become a separate and distinct subspecies.Darwin came up with the theory of natural selection. Darwin as a contemporary ofMendel never knew of Mendel and never understood the principals of the scienceof “genetics,” but he did develop three basic principles that have beenconfirmed through genetic studies: 1. Variation is random and unpredictable. 2. Variation is heritable (able to be transmitted from one generation to the next.) Mendel’s pea research and thousands of genetic studies over the past 100 years have confirmed heritability. Heritable genetic transmission has been confirmed by DNA “fingerprinting” techniques. By using DNA fingerprinting techniques one can trace heritable genetic variation for such things as “paternity testing.” 3. Variation changes in frequency over time. The Hardy-Weinberg principle codified this concept through the prism of population genetics in the early 1900s. Since the 1970s, genetic studies employing DNA sequencing confirmed that genetic variation within populations changes through mutation and geographic isolation.THE LIFE AND WORK OF GREGOR MENDELIn 1856, in a small walled garden of the Agustinian monastery of St. Thomas inwhat is now Brno, Czech Republic, the abbot constructed a greenhouse to houseexperiments in plant breeding. Gregor Mendel, a young teacher who had justreturned from studies at the University of Vienna, was appointed to tend theexperimental gardens. Between 1855 and 1863, Mendel uncovered the scientificexplanation of biological inheritance through hybridization of the common gardenpea (Pisum sativum).Over nine years of hybridization studies of controlling the Anlagen or“foundations” for particular traits, and the use of more than 10,000 plants,Mendel outlined a theory based on elements, eventually to be known as “genes,”that were carried in the pea’s reproductive cells.Johann Mendel, born July 22, 1822, was the only son of Rosine Schwirtlich, agardener’s daughter, and Anton Mendel, an ex-Austrian army soldier who made aliving as a peasant farmer.He was raised in the town of Heizendorf in the northeastern section of Moravia.His parents were peasants scratching a living on a small farm. The town was asmall German-speaking, God-fearing community. It was a very poor place, and evenfarmers who were fortunate enough to own small pieces of land, as Mendel’sfather did, were subject to the robota.The robota was a form of institutionalized forced labor (serfdom) thatrepresented the last fragments of the ancient European feudal system. The 20thcentury word robot has its origins from the Czech author Karel Capek whodescribed how peasants of the day lived.Under the robota system, Mendel’s father was allowed to cultivate his own fruittrees and fields for four days each week; on the other three he was required towork for the local land owner. This was Mendel’s future: “a life spent on thefarm and in the fields, a life of physical labor and drudgery, as much for thelandlord as for himself, a life of brawn, not brain.”The land holder that Anton Mendel owed robota was Maria Walburga, GrafinTruchsess von Waldburg-Zeil, who rewarded the people under her jurisdiction byproviding a school for their children that was located at her chateau in thetown of Kunin.In 1802 Father Johann Schreiber was removed from his post as director of theschool in Kunin and demoted and sent to a small village of Gross-Petersdorf as aparish priest, who was also to be responsible for Heinzendorf. It was in thissmall school where Johann Mendel and his sister Veronika, and his younger sisterTheresia all began their education.The famous naturalist, Christian Carl Andre, who would become a founding memberof the Brunn Association for Sheep-Breeders, had been employed as an instructorat the institute that was the model for Father Schreiber’s school in Kunin.Andre supported the priest’s plan in the teaching of natural science, andSchreiber was a founding member of the Pomological (fruit-breeders) Associationof Brno and member of the Brno Agricultural Society. Out of the AgriculturalSociety, a splinter society, The Society for Natural Science formed.Thirty years later, it was to a meeting of The Society for Natural Science thatthe priest, Gregor Mendel, would read his famous paper on inheritance in thecommon garden pea.Father Schreiber grew a small garden next to the school in Heinzendorf and usedit to teach gardening and plant grafting. It was here that Johann Mendel learnedof pollination and seed germination and the basic knowledge and skills of aplant-breeder.Father Schreiber seemed to be everywhere in young Johann’s life: He baptizedMendel, he tutored Mendel, and on September 12, 1834, he filled out the entryand application from the baptismal register for the then fourteen-year-oldJohann’s admission to the Gymnasium at Troppau .Admission to the Gymnasium was a turning point in Johann Mendel’s life. As theonly son of a peasant farmer he had now committed himself to six years of formaleducation at Troppau. He would live away from home and no longer be able to helpon the family farm and would additionally be a drain on the family’s meagerresources. He entered the Gymnasium on December 15, 1834.Mendel’s parents saved the funds to send him to the Gymnasium in Troppau untilhe was sixteen, after which he financed himself by giving private lessons. AtTroppau, Mendel lived on half-board (bed and a single meal each day) as that waswhat the collective family could afford. They also sent by carrier, on anirregular basis, home-grown vegetables to supplement his basic meals.During the winter of 1838/39, Mendel’s father had a near-death logging accidentthat resulted in internal injuries and broken ribs, and at Pentacost of 1839Johann temporarily left his schooling and returned to the farm.In 1840, at the age of eighteen, Mendel entered into the Philosophy Institute atOlmutz that was a preparatory college of the university. In support of Mendel,his younger sister actually paid for his tuition with part of her dowry andproceeds from the sale of the family farm.On July 14, 1843, Professor Friedrich Franz, a physicist, as well as a member ofthe holy orders, wrote to a friar:Honored Colleague and very dear Friend!As a result of your letter of June 12, I have made known to my pupils the RightReverend Prelate’s decision to accept satisfactory candidates at yourinstitution. Up to now, two candidates have given me their names, but I can onlyrecommend one of them. This is Johann Mendel, born at Heinzendorf in Silesia.On September 7, 1843, Mendel traveled to Brunn to be given a medical examinationby a Dr. Schwarz in anticipation of his admission to the Augustinian Order. Hewas found to be perfectly healthy—on the 27th of September he was transferredfrom the diocese of Olmutz to that of Brunn, and on October 9, 1843, he wasadmitted to the convent of the Agustinians as a novice under the name ofGregor—he was now Gregor Mendel!At the age of twenty one, Mendel entered into a religious order to pursue hisscholarly ambitions. His fascination with science resulted in Mendel studyingmeteorology, bee culture and plant heredity along with teaching physics andnatural history at Brunn’s Oberrealschule.Mendel chose the garden pea as his research plant because it wasself-fertilizing which favored the production of pure breeding varieties,“immune to accidental cross-pollination because of the keel-shaped anatomy ofthe pea flower, (thus) tightly enclosing the reproductive structures.”Before Mendel started his pea hybridization studies he made sure that all of thetraits he wanted to study were consistently expressed by growing thirty-fourvarieties side by side for two years, then to ensure that the crosses betweenvarieties were correct he used the technique of artificial fertilization: theremoval of the male organs from the flower to prevent self-pollination, thenfollowed by the introduction of pollen from another variety. His goal had been“to obtain new variants” through further understanding of “the development ofhybrids in their progeny.” It was through his statistical approach to variationthat he demonstrated his originality as a scientist.During the two years of study at the University of Vienna, Mendel learned thatthe reproduction of phanerogams (flowering plants) is produced by the union ofone germinal cell (female) and one pollen cell (male) into a single cell. Herejected the prevailing theory that the pollen cell alone was the origin of theplant embryo. This belief was the very basis of his new analysis of variation.At the recently opened Institute of Experimental Physics, where he attendedlectures and courses on practical plant propagation, the director was the famousphysicist Christian Doppler, the discoverer of the Doppler Effect. After onlytwo years of study Doppler died and was replaced by Andreas von Ettingshausen.In 1826 Ettingshausen had published a textbook entitled Combinatorial Analysis.It is exactly this branch of mathematics, the study of combinations, patterns,and probabilities, that Mendel used to form his analysis of hybridization of thecommon garden pea.In July of 1852 Mendel wrote to a fellow friar:Dear Anselm,It is a nuisance that I am once more short of under-linen. No one is in greaterneed of new under-linen than I am, for of the dozen shirts I brought with me toVienna as many as 12 are frayed and in holes. Will you please ask Frau Smekal tospend 6 florins in buying linen for 5 shirts, and to get to work upon makingthem as soon as possible, so that I can at least have one new shirt for theexercises. Would it not be a scandal if the new man I shall become inconsequence of the pious exercises were to go about in a frayed shirt? Howashamed I should be if I (Apocalypse: Stantes amict stolis albis—they stoodclothed in white raiment) had to parade in torn vesture! The Herr Prelate hasalready notified me that I am to officiate at the exercises during the last weekof hujus. Since, as you know, the lectures at the university finish on the 20th,and in this matter it would be stupid of me to try to piss in the wind’s eye, Ihave fixed the date of my return for Sunday the 24th, and shall arrive at Brunntoward noon.Peter Matous (Klacel) is, I suppose still in the primeval forests of Trubau.Lucky devil! Leopoldstadt—next week. If tomorrow I win 25,000 fl. As the bigprize in the lottery, I shall send a non-committal wire to Frau Smekal. Look herup without fail in the evening! To our speedy and happy (?) meeting!GregorAs an expert field botanist, Mendel understood how to recognize one species fromanother on the basis of contrasting traits. In evaluating the changes betweengenerations of hybrids he followed the procedure of identifying hybrids in termsof defined pairs of contrasting characteristics (traits) of color, size, andshape of flowers and seeds to establish if they were related or variationoccurred independently.In 1854 Mendel procured thirty-four different varieties of pea seeds from localgrowers and then took two years of growing these peas to determine whichvarieties would have the correct characteristics and be suitable researchsubjects.Mendel was seeking to find examples of “constant differentiating characters”—what is called “discontinuous variations” by 20th century geneticists.Because of his training in combinatorial analysis under Ettingshausen, Mendelunderstood the mathematics of probability and outcome and as a result he choseto use quantitative observations rather than qualitative for documenting hisresearch.Mendel eliminated twelve varieties of peas from his research pool, leaving himwith twenty-two from which he ultimately chose seven for his research: 1. Smooth vs. wrinkled peas 2. Yellow cotyledons with yellow peas vs. green cotyledons with green peas 3. White seed coats with white flowers vs. grey seed coats with purple flowers 4. Smooth vs. constricted pods 5. Green vs. yellow pods 6. Axial vs. terminal flowers 7. Tall vs. dwarf plantsAll twenty-two varieties were bred and reproduced during the entire duration ofthe experiment in order to demonstrate they all consistently bred true. Mendelchose the common garden pea (Pisum sativum) for his studies because it wasself-pollinating, meaning pollen from the pea flower covers the stigma from thesame flower before the flower bud opens, which guarantees that the peas thatresult have the same male and female “parent.”The large immature pea flowers were easy to open, so Mendel was able to removethe nine anthers from each flower before they were mature in order to preventself-pollination. After the anthers are extracted, the flower can be pollenatedwith pollen from another plant by means of a brush.Mendel also used reciprocal crossing, which proved that both the male and femalecontributed equally to the resulting hybrid pea. Following the pollinationprocess the flowers were covered with bags to prevent any chance of an unwantedcontaminating pollination.Mendel observed that 100 per cent of the seven pairs of contrasting peacharacteristics that he studied segregated and recombined through successivegenerations. He demonstrated that for all traits the first generation hybridwere consistent in resembling one member of each contrasting pair of traits,i.e., all first generation plants from a cross between green and yellow-seededvarieties resulted in only yellow seeds, demonstrating that this was a dominantfeature. He observed that dominance was identical no matter the direction of thecross, that is, yellow female, green male, and green male x yellow female.All seven traits were sorting independently as they passed through thegenerations. With a physicist’s knowledge of probability and combination theory,he had seen through nine generations of crosses the transfer of traits bothindividually and in association with each other. Mendel had designed hisresearch “to deduce a law” and by the time of publication, he had proved tohimself that the law was as predictable as gravity.Mendel came to understand that inheritance of characteristics was under thereplicable control of elements (“genes”) from each of the parents through thesex cells into the offspring. He understood that there were two of theseelements for each characteristic, one each produced by the male and femaleparent.In 1866 Gregor Mendel recorded and published an accumulation of the results ofhis gardening experiments with peas. His classic landmark observations werepublished in the scientific journal Versuche Pflanzen Hybriden, where itlanguished for almost forty years. Mendel sent copies of his printed works totwo highly-respected scientists. One copy remains missing and the second wasfound in an unopened envelope—his peers never grasped the magnitude of hisobservations and discovery.Mendel’s observations went unnoticed until botanist Hugo de Vries, Erich vonTschermak, and Carl Correns rediscovered Mendel’s work. The three botanistsre-ran Mendel’s experiments and their results were identical. All three (four ifyou include Mendel) “discovered” the laws of heredity.Two years after Mendel had published his theory, the monastery’s abbot died andMendel was elected to become the abbot. The added responsibilities diverted himfrom the pea garden, and the hybrid research came to a halt by 1871.In 1878 Mendel was visited by a horticulturalist from France. As the two menwalked through the gardens together Mendel showed the visitor labeled varietiesof fruit trees, hot house plants, and well-groomed vegetable gardens. Thevegetable gardens included “several beds of green peas in full bearing, which hesaid he had reshaped in height as well as in type of fruit to serve hisestablishment to better advantage.” When asked how he had created the newvariety, Mendel responded, “It is just a little trick.”De Vries found Mendel’s work referenced in a paper published in 1881. Throughthis study De Vries coined the term “mutation.” Focke, the author of the 1881paper, summarized Mendel’s findings. However, it doesn’t appear that Focke hadany idea of the magnitude or the scientific value of the information.During the last decade of his life Mendel suffered from numerous degenerativediseases. He was obese, a heavy smoker, suffered from high blood pressure,dropsy, congestive heart failure, and progressive kidney failure.But it appears that Mendel retained his famous humor until the end. In Decemberof 1883, he wrote to one of his students who had become a meteorologist, “Sincewe are not likely to meet again in this world, let me take the opportunity ofwishing you farewell, and invoking upon your head all the blessings of all themeteorological deities.” Mendel died early in the morning on January 6, 1884.Mendel was buried three days after his death. A requiem mass was celebrated forhim in the abbey church, the music conducted by the former pupil at the abbeychoir school. After his burial in the section of the public cemetery reservedfor the brothers of the Abbey of St. Thomas, his books were placed in thelibrary of the convent and his official letters in the archive. His personalpapers, his hand-written notes, and all of the records of his breedingexperiments were taken out to the hill behind the convent and burned!There was no news release, no public indication that perhaps one of the greatestscientists of all time had died.OTHER SCIENTISTS JOIN THE NEW SCIENCEESTABLISHED BY DARWIN AND MENDELDe Vries correctly interpreted Mendel’s research and referenced it in his ownpaper, which was published in 1900. Within months, Tschermak and Correns alsodiscovered Mendel’s research through de Vries’ published works and indicatedthat their own independent research confirmed Mendel’s results.When Mendel’s lost works were rediscovered, they were considered an alternativemechanism for the theory of evolution. De Vries was not satisfied with theDarwinian theory of gradualism to fully explain natural selection. He wassearching for some support for his theory of evolution advancing in major leapsor “saltations.” His own theories of mutations appeared to provide additionalsupport.William Bateson was extremely influential in the world of science. When he readde Vries’ paper that referenced Mendel’s work, and being very astute, he knewthat Mendel’s laws of inheritance were “revolutionary and absolutely correct.”Bateson became excited and became Mendel’s voice in spreading word of the newscience. He coined the terms genetics, allele (shortened from the originalallelomorph), homozygote, and heterozygote. Bateson was additionally recognizedfor his discovery of linkage, which was confirmed by Morgan and Bridges.It wasn’t until the 1920s and 1930s, after Morgan’s theories of chromosomalinheritance became universally understood and accepted, that researchers offereda blend of both Darwinism and Mendelian thought.Biologist J. B. S. Haldane and Sewell Wright brought forth the theory thatMendelian genetics was the piece that Darwinian natural selection was missing—“the new combination theory could account for the production, generation aftergeneration, of stable, inheritable variation on which natural selection couldwork.” Although Mendel had proposed this line of thinking in his classic paper,no one at the time had been educated enough to understand the material and takenotice.In 1902 an extremely original observation was made by a London physician,Archibald Garrod. His report in the British medical journal The Lancet,entitled, “The Incidence of Alkaptonuria: A Study in Chemical Individuality.”Garrod saw many patients with the disease known as alkaptonuria, which wascharacterized by patients excreting large amounts of homogentisic acid in theirurine. This substance turned black on contact with air so that the babiesdiapers would be stained black, alarming the mothers.Alkaptonuria was not a disease that the patient caught from someone else, so wasnot a germ transmitted infectious disease, but rather was an “inborn error ofmetabolism”—a term that he came up with in 1908—meaning it was an unusualdisease that was “inherited.”Patients afflicted with alkaptonuria could not break down the amino acidtyrosine, which led to the abnormal accumulation of an intermediate metabolite,homogentisic acid. This non-lethal disease produced discoloration of thecartilage that was visible on the nose and ears, and produced arthritis, heartvalve disease, and the black urine color.Garrod postulated that this disease was an example of a rare recessive traitinherited in the classic Mendelian theory. He also suggested other many otherrecessive traits including albinism, a subject on which he published a book in1909.For the first time it was posited by Garrod that a gene biochemically allows anenzyme to function or not to function in certain steps of metabolism when hesaid: “. . . it will be seen that in the case of each of [the several knowninborn errors of metabolism] the most probable cause is the congenital lack ofsome particular enzyme, in the absence of which a step is missed, and somenormal metabolic change fails to be brought about.”At the Rockefeller Institute in New York, the Russian-born Phoebus Levene, knownfor having collaborated with Kossel on nucleic acid at the early part of the20th century, improved the analysis of nuclein, the gelatinous stuff in thenucleus.Levene discovered the sugar deoxyribose and the linkage of these sugars togetherthrough phosphate groups. The molecule contained the four bases that Kossel haddiscovered: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. Bonded together—phosphate-sugar-base— these components formed a compound that Levene callednucleotide. He also discovered that the two forms of nucleic acid differed intheir sugar component—ribose in one and deoxyribose in the second: thereforeribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).By the 1930s, George Beadle and Edward Tatum were vigorously investigating thetheory that enzyme deficiency produced a defect in a single metabolic step andthey determined that Garrod’s theory was in fact a law: each step in a metabolicpathway was controlled by a specific enzyme molecule, and each enzyme came froma specific gene that could be changed (“mutated”) by exposure to X-rays—onegene: one enzyme. Enzymes were comprised of proteins, so the theory evolved intoone gene: one protein.Once again, it should be understood that Thomas Edison ended thousands of yearsof universal mineral supplementation that corrected mineral deficiencies of theaverage peasant when he pulled the switch at 3:00 pm in the afternoon on Monday,September 4th, 1882, on Pearl Street in New York City and opened up the firstcommercial electric generating plant and the first generating station thatdelivered 110 volts of direct current to 60 customers in lower Manhattan.Edison lost the “War of the Currents” when alternating current became the mostuser-friendly distribution system of electricity. Even though he lost thedistribution war, Edison’s power distribution system was significant for severalreasons. First it established the potential commercial uses of such a system,and secondly it forever fostered the replacement of wood as the universal fuel.And, with the change to electrical power sources, it was the end of thehistorical source of the dietary mineral supplements of wood ashes."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETHE GENETIC TRANSMISSION THEORY. . . (this) seems to show that the chromosomal substance, the chromatin, is tobe regarded as the physical basis of inheritance. Now, chromatin is known to beclosely similar to, if not identical with, a substance known as nuclein, whichanalysis shows to be a tolerably definite chemical compound composed of nucleicacid and albumin. And thus we reach the remarkable conclusion that inheritancemay perhaps be affected by the physical transmission of a particular chemicalcompound from parent to offspring.—E. B. Wilson (1895)American cytologistIn 1678 a Dutch scientist, Anton Philips van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723 AD),reported to the Royal Society on the discovery of human spermatozoa, whichresembled myriads of worm-like animals. He wrote, “What I investigate is onlywhat, without sinfully defiling myself, remains as a residue of conjugal coitus.And if your Lordship should consider that these observations may disgust orscandalize the learned, I earnestly beg your Lordship to regard them as privateand to publish or destroy them as your Lordship thinks fit.”THE EARLY RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND CHROMOSOMES AND OUR GENETIC INHERITANCEVan Leeuwenhoek eventually postulated that the microscopic creatures (sperm)swimming in semen played a role in fertilization. Other scientists of the dayproposed that the sperm were simply parasites and had nothing to do withreproduction.Around 1677 van Leeuwenhoek and one of his students, Johan Ham, had employed a300-power microscope to examine semen. He referred to the sperm in the semen as“animalcules” or “little animals,” supportive of his belief of the theory ofpreformation, which postulated that the head of the sperm contained a tiny,fully formed human.A Dutch microscopist, Nicolaas Hartsoeker, claimed that he had seen spermatozoain 1674. However, he was unsure of his findings and believed that the sperm wereparasites. His famous drawing of a homunculus, or little human, packed into thehead of the sperm, supported the preformation theory. Hartsoeker never claimedto have in fact seen homunculi, although others did claim they had seen them.Some investigators of the times theorized that homunculi in a sperm might havesmaller sperm of their own—in other words, a homunculi within a homunculi. Wheninvestigators began to observe how internal organs in animals such as chicks andhuman embryos gradually appeared during the development of an embryo it wasclear that preformation did not occur.Today we are fully aware that the sperm cell in humans contains 23 chromosomes(the thread-like carriers of genes and genetic information) that penetrate thefemale ovum that contains its own 23 chromosomes, thus forming a 46 chromosomefertilized zygote.In 1866 Ernst von Haeckel postulated that the nuclei, a universal structurefound in each cell, was in fact the “transmitter of inheritance.” In 1869 aSwiss chemist by the name of Friedrich Miescher isolated a material from thenuclei of pus (dead white blood cells) that he called “nuclein.” Miescher chosepus, which he obtained from local hospitals, because white blood cells havelarge nuclei and minimal amounts of cytoplasm.In 1889 it was discovered that nuclein contained a protein that could bedigested, leaving a sticky acidic gel residue—nucleic acids had been discovered!In 1893 a student of Miescher, Albrecht Kosel, analyzed the acidic gel (nucleicacids) and showed that it was a mix of phosphorous, sugar, and a blend of fourdifferent nitrogen-containing substances that he identified as adenine,cytosine, guanine, and thymine: A, C, G, and T.The German cytologist Walther Flemming is credited with the discovery of mitosisin 1879. Flemming had created a new staining technique that allowed him toidentify and observe chromosomes in greater detail. As a result he was able toobserve cell division, considered to be one of the great scientific discoveriesof all time.In 1873 Anton Schneider observed and reported the presence of “chromosomes” individing cells. In making these observations Schneider accurately noted that thechromosome filaments line up on the equator of the cell, double, and divide intothe “daughter cells.” This was the first observation and reporting of theprocess of mitosis.In 1884, after the death of Mendel, the concept of inheritance dominated thescientific arena. Von Nageli talked about the “idioplasm,” Weismann talked aboutthe “germ plasm,” Darwin talked about the “gemmules,” and de Vries talked aboutthe “pangenes.”Except for sex cells (sperm and ova), all cells—those responsible for growth,development and cellular repair—divide by mitosis. Sex cells divide by meiosis,which was explained by the great German biologist August Weismann in 1890.In 1902 a German biologist, Theodor Boveri, and an American geneticist andphysician, Walter Sutton, independently identified chromosomes as the carrier ofgenetic information.While studying sea urchins, Boveri observed that the sperm and the egg eachcarried half of the set of chromosomes. If the sperm and egg that became afertilized embryo had an abnormal number of chromosomes, the resulting embryowould die or develop into an abnormal sea urchin. Boveri correctly surmised thatthat different chromosomes control different parts of the urchin’s anatomy orphysiology.Sutton’s studies of grasshoppers clearly demonstrated that the matched pairs ofchromosomes separate during the production of sex cells (sperm and egg).Boveri and Sutton both reported that chromosomes carry and transmit parentalgenetic information. They additionally showed that chromosomes were independentstructures that remained intact, even when they were not visible, during allstages of the cells life. These observations were counter to the prevailingthought that chromosomes dissolved during the latter stages of cell division andthen reformed again in the daughter cell.The research of Boveri and Sutton provided the foundation for the new scientificfield of “cytogenetics,” the combining of cytology (the study of cells) andgenetics (the study of heredity).THOMAS HUNT MORGAN’S FRUIT FLY LAB: OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESS THATCREATES CHROMOSOMAL CHARACTERISTICSIt is well documented today that during the formation of the sperm and egg,matching chromosomes of parents can exchange small incomplete segments ofchromosomes in what is called, “crossover,” so that newly formed chromosomesmight not be inherited perfectly duplicated from each parent. Incorrect numbersof chromosomes or imperfectly formed chromosomes will result in an inability ofthe embryo to survive or a malformed embryo. These events of embryonic death andthe malformations that can result, for instance in trisomy, known as Downsyndrome characterized by 47 chromosomes, are typically and quite incorrectlysaid to be “genetically transmitted.”These events are in fact not the result of a genetically-transmitted defect, butrather a specific nutrient deficiency of the functioning chromosome in themoments immediately after fertilization.It is thought that no scientist spent more time looking at fruit flies through amicroscope than American biologist Thomas Hunt Morgan. Morgan’s laboratory,fondly referred to as the “fly room,” was a simple 368 square foot room stuffedwith eight students, desks, and hundreds of glass milk bottles full of fruitflies, and piles of overripe bananas hung from the ceiling as fly food: “theroom literally stunk of decomposing bananas and hummed with escaped fruit fliesand crackled with stow away cockroaches.” Between 1910 and 1930, thisoverpopulated laboratory was the incubator of some of the most significantscientific discoveries of all time— discoveries that are basic to theinterpretation of the field of modern genetics.Calvin Bridges and Alfred Sturtevant were both undergraduate students atColumbia University in New York City in 1909. After attending a lecturepresented by Morgan, both Bridges and Sturtevant were awarded desks in the flyroom. Gregor Mendel’s observations on pea plants had just been rediscovered, andthis was a heady time for genetic research.Fruit flies made a perfect study animal with which investigate the latesttheories, and the fly-room crew spent many hours sharing and discussing theirresearch and current publications. Following one of their discussions,Sturtevant rushed home to flesh-out a new thought: a map of the genes on the Xchromosome. Sturtevant constructed his chromosome map (still accurate yet today)at 20 years of age. Bridges at the age of 24 went on to report thenondisjunction of fly chromosomes, thus proving that Morgan’s theory ofchromosomal inheritance was in fact correct.In 1910 Morgan observed a single white-eyed fly among his red-eyed specimens. Heran a series of breeding experiments in order to study how this mutation wouldbe transmitted to come to a similar observation of that of Mendel, whorecognized pink pea flowers were a “hybrid” resulting from “crossbreeding” ofwhite and red flowered pea plants.Morgan was awarded the 1933 Nobel Prize in medicine for his work withchromosomes and heredity. Morgan learned that the white-eyed trait was recessivesince a single red-eyed parent invariably resulting in red-eyed offspring. Healso theorized that the mutation was located on the X chromosome since onlymales (with no second chromosome to counteract the white-eyed form of the gene)displayed the characteristic.Morgan had discovered that specific genes are carried on specific chromosomes.He was building on work pioneered by American geneticist Walter Sutton andGerman biologist Theodor Boveri, who in 1902 independently arrived at theconclusion that chromosomes carry genetic material. These observations wereessential milestones in the understanding of inheritance and genetics.THE USE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GENETICS FOR “SOCIAL ENGINEERING”: FRANCIS GALTONESTABLISHES EUGENICSGenetics wasn’t limited or confined to a chemical laboratory. It came to be usedas a tool for social engineering. Social Darwinism (neo-Darwinism) swept theglobe.Eugenics (“well born”), the concept of an individual’s superiority orinferiority was based on an inheritance of intelligence or leadership traitsmeant that a person could receive a social mutation, was conceived by FrancisGalton, Charles Darwin’s cousin and a contemporary of Mendel. These ideas cameto a functional level concurrently with the work of Morgan as he mapped thelocations of the genes on the chromosomes and Beadle and Tatum had revealed thatgenes made enzymes.Similar to his cousin Charles, Galton failed to exhibit much talent in hisyounger years. Galton quit medical school and chose to travel through Europe foryears until he returned to England and Cambridge to pursue studies in math.Galton suffered from what was referred to as a nervous breakdown and left schoolbefore he finished his degree. For a short time he returned to medical school.However, upon his father’s death Galton received a considerable fortune andchose to abandon medical school a second time.Galton developed an obsession with the measurements of humans, math, and abelief that “he was a superior person and that this superiority was inherited.”He viewed the publication in 1859 of his cousin’s work, On the Origin of Speciesby Natural Selection, as the “formative event in his life,” and it influencedthe invention of the “science” he called “eugenics” in 1885.In 1869 Galton published his book titled Hereditary Genius, the first scientificwork to study the relationship between genius and greatness. It documented hisview that civilization, while desirable, inevitably led to an increase in the“unfit” people by preventing the forces of nature from eliminating the weak,mentally ill, and those deemed to be “undesirable.”Galton felt it was ultimately counterproductive to the survival of man toimprove the environment by introducing factory safety and pollution laws, or byproviding good sanitation, or enacting laws to help the poor, or by buildinghospitals, thinking governments had failed to encourage the birth of babies withsuperior minds and bodies and additionally failed to proactively prevent thebirth of the weak.In the 1870s Galton postulated that inheritance is facilitated by a“particulate,” but Galton’s observations were primarily based on continuousvariations instead of discontinuous variation that was the classic Mendeliantheory.Galton’s first “law” was that the offspring of exceptional parents “revert tothe mean.”Galton’s second “law” of inheritance stated that children have one-half of eachparent’s “heritage,” and therefore, “on average, one-quarter of eachgrandparent’s heritage, one eighth of each great-grandparent’s heritage, and soon.”Galton’s main direction was to promote the idea of human talents, especiallyhuman intelligence, and it was in the course of his research that he coined theterm “eugenics.”It was obvious to Galton that humans have inheritable traits the same way thatplants and animals do. Some traits are desirable and some others are notdesirable. It was his theory that it would be possible to have the “better”genetic types to reproduce and force the “poorer” individuals to stopreproducing. The result would be that the human genetic pool would improve overtime in the same manner that beef cattle and dogs have been improved over thedecades through selective breeding.Galton is the one who also coined the term “nature and nurture” in 1871 todescribe how the environment could affect the inheritance of our intelligenceand abilities. In 1875 Galton developed the idea of using identical twins tostudy the influence of heredity versus environment on human development andintelligence. His claim that his evidence revealed that the nature rather thanthe nuture of an individual has the most influenence on human development beganthe famous controversies over these ideas that are still researched and debatedtoday.A modern researcher of identical twins, Danielle Reed, who is following inGalton’s footsteps by her choice of twin studies to examine the theories of“nature and nuture” (see National Geographic, January 2012), states that, “It isvery clear when you look at (identical) twins that much of what they share ishardwired. Many things about them are absolutely the same and unalterable. Butit is also clear, when you get to know them, that other things about them aredifferent. Epigenetics is the origin of a lot of those differences.”Reed further states that, “Mother Nature writes some things in pencil and somethings in pen . . . Things written in pen you can’t change. That’s DNA. Butthings written in pencil you can. That’s epigenetics.”In 1907 Galton’s theories spawned the Eugenics Education Society in Britain withthe advertised goal of genetic improvement of the human population of Britain byselective breeding as it is practiced in livestock. Galton was elected to thesociety’s presidency in1908.It was Galton who recruited the very well-respected statistical genius, KarlPearson, who became Galton’s protégé and proponent of eugenics. Pearson,expanded on Galton’s theories of human measurements and created the BiometricLaboratory at University College, London. “Biometrics” was then merged witheugenics.Pearson became a fanatic about human measurement of inferior races of peoplefrom poor stock and applied his theories of Social Darwinism about the need toincrease the strong person versus the weak individual that could not be improvedby applying national policies to ensure this. He created an ongoing journalBiometrika to develop statistical theory. And the journal contained many of histables of human measurements for statisticians that were very influential,especially in the United States.Galton was personally “terrified” by the growing financial power of Germany andwanted to neutralize it by creating a national program of “selective breeding.”Embracing Galton’s “neologism,” Pearson coined the term “eugenic marriage” anddemanded that the British government create a national biographical studbook of“desirables” and “undesirables” and require a permit of proof of individualfitness before a marriage license would be issued. Darwin publically approved ofGalton’s theories and his book about the influence of nature over nuture as faras an individual’s intelligence.In 1911 Galton was named the first Galton Professor of Eugenics (changed toProfessor of Genetics in 1965) at London University. Galton’s efforts neverreached the level of legislative power in Britain. However, in the United StatesAndrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller believed that eugenics could “enablehumanity to command its own evolution in a way that was efficient andprogressive.” In 1904 the Carnegie Institute founded a center for geneticresearch at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, with Charles Davenport appointed tothe directorship.Davenport directed his efforts to the study of human inheritance, and in 1910,with the financial backing of the Harriman and Rockefeller family trusts, hecreated the Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor and appointed HarryLaughlin as the facilities first superintendent.At the same time, Henry Goddard, a psychologist, introduced the Binetintelligence test into the United States. This test gave the eugenics movement away to quantify human intelligence and measure and identify what was a “moron,”“imbecile,” and “idiot.”Goddard’s studies showed that, “the devil of genetic unfitness was at workwithin the U.S.” Many came to believe the only option was to prevent thebreeding of the perceived unfit. By 1931 twenty-seven American states hadenacted sterilization laws that would allow compulsory sterilization of selectedtypes of people categorized as morons and the feeble-minded. As a result, by1941 almost thirty-six thousand Americans had been forcibly sterilized. Within afew years Germany, Switzerland, and the Scandinavian countries all enactedsterilization laws.In 1906 the Race Betterment Foundation was created in Michigan by J.H. Kelloggto promote “racial improvement.”THE THEORIES OF SOCIAL DARWINISM TAKE HOLD AND “DYSGENICS” TAKES OVER EUGENICSSocial Darwinism developed in many ways, but eugenics failed as a “science” andhad minimal impact in the creation of national fitness registers and studbooks.However, the appearance of “dysgenics,” thought of as a sister science ofeugenics, which embraced the elimination (the equivalent of the animal husbandrytechnique of “culling” the less desirable examples of a breeding line) of theunhealthy, surprised almost everyone by its rapid acceptance by the medical andthe bureaucratic institutions.At the same time that Avery was studying bacteria, the pursuit of human geneticresearch in Germany took on a nasty direction. In 1905 the Society for RacialHygiene was founded by Alfred Ploetz. Initially the society was not a racistorganization as Ploetz “applauded the Jewish race as being equal to the Nordic.”In the meantime Darwin’s works encouraged the pursuit of imperialism, theestablishment of colonies, the “race for Africa” and Rhodes’ belief that Englandshould be “painting the map of the world red.”Driven by Darwin’s concept of the “survival of the fittest” Britain grabbed 3.5million square miles of colonies and 1.5 million miles of protectorates. Duringthe same period, additional nations, driven by a fear that Britain would own theworld and squeeze them financially with duties and taxes, began their own driveto grab colonies and to develop their own “master race.” The Russians, theFrench, the Japanese, and the Germans aggressively jumped into the race forcolonies.The most highly-respected German Darwinian biographer and historian, Heinrichvon Treitschke, designed an aggressive view of Germany’s history and predicted atriumphant future; and at the same time, Bismarck, himself, created a nationalimperialistic plan for Germany and coined the Darwinian slogan “Blood and Iron”to encourage his armies.Additionally, the Darwinian theory of “the survival of the fittest” created adrive to improve national “racial stock” by employing positive and negativeplans. Darwin was also opposed to vaccinations and medical programs that wouldmaintain populations of “weaker” people. He promoted their birth control, and heviewed the reduction or extinction of “aboriginals” in Argentina, New Zealand,and Australia by the “stronger races” as natural and acceptable. Darwinpredicted and accepted the eventual control and rule of Africa by the strongerwhite European nations. In his view the inevitability of natural selection“advanced in favor of a world ruled by whites of European origin.”Back in the United States, as early as in 1904, Charles Davenport, a devoutsupporter of Darwin and Galton, enlisted the billionaire Andrew Carnegie tofinancially support the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The laboratory rapidlyembraced the new science of Mendelism to support Darwinism and espouse “thedoctrine that physical weakness and mental illness were both inherited.”The fuel that drove the active pursuit of dysgenics was the concern overimmigration and the risk that “lower-race” arrivals from eastern Europe,especially Jews, would “contaminate” and “weaken” the Anglo-Saxon racial stockof the United States. The passage of the Immigration Restriction Act (1924) canbe traced directly to the publication of The Origin of Species. Several U. S.states pushed harder and enacted laws that gave government appointed doctors thepower (without a hearing or trial) to sterilize those individuals that theydetermined to be mentally unfit and those who participated in various levels ofpetty and habitual crime.By 1920 fifteen U. S. states passed sterilization laws. The U. S. Supreme Courtruled most of the laws unconstitutional until 1927, when in the case of Buck v.Bell, the Court deemed that the state of Virginia could sterilize Carrie Buck, afeeble-minded epileptic, daughter of another “low-mentality” woman already themother of another child labeled “an imbecile.” Passing judgment, Justice OliverWendell Holmes ruled, “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”In the 25 years leading up to 1935, U. S. states enacted more than 100sterilization laws and allowed the forced sterilization of over 100,000Americans (labeled as having subnormal mental faculties) by the too willingmedical doctors. The state of Virginia continued their forced sterilizationprograms operated by eager medical doctors through the 1970s.While the world accepted eugenics and dysgenics, the British Empire (exceptCanada) rejected forced sterilization because of a persistent effort by G. K.Chesterton, who published a book on the subject. His campaign was aided by asatire authored by Aldous Huxley in 1932, Brave New World, which described a“dark Utopia” in which science and technology were employed in many forms to“create a hygienically perfect, but docile, and submissive society.” Thesemovements combined to form an anti-Galton movement that Paul Johnson describesas “with a reprise of George Eliot’s worry that Darwinian natural selection wasa dangerous form of determination, which would extinguish free will and thehuman instinct for freedom. It was also a sally against the bright utopiapreached by H.G. Wells, in which science was king. Wells, Shaw, Beatrice andSydney Webb, Havelock Ellis, and many other socialist intellectuals favoringboth eugenics and dysgenics would have condemned to sterilization or even deathall the mentally unfit if they could have brought to power a government to theirtaste. But they never persuaded the British Labour Party to adopt their views.”Darwin commonly coined comments such as “rich as Jews” and blamed “a primitiveJewish God” for much that was wrong with Judeo-Christianity, especially thedoctrine of eternal punishment, which he thought positively evil. However,Darwin publically professed that he was not anti-Semitic.It is thought that Darwin’s teachings in The Origin of Species contributed tothe destruction of Germany by emphasizing the constant violence that took placein the process of natural selection. Hitler was known to be fond of referring tothe “awful prospect of mankind evolving backward or downward.”In Hitler’s Table Talk, 1941–1944: Secret Conversations, the record of Hitler’sconversations taken down in shorthand by his army officers, Hitler is recordedas saying:If we do not respect the law of nature, imposing our will by the might of thestronger, a day will come when the wild animals will again devour us—when theinsects will eat the wild animals, and finally nothing will exist except themicrobes. By means of the struggle the elites are continually renewed. The lawof selection justifies this incessant struggle by allowing the survival of thefittest. Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest againstnature.When the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933, they discovered that many of theirtheories on human purity were already upheld by medical and scientificorganizations. A eugenic sterilization law was put into place when Hitler wasreleased from jail and appointed chancellor. An entire bureaucracy was quicklyput into place with Erbklinik (genetic clinics), Erbgesundheits gerichte(genetic courts), and Erbamter (genetic officials). By the 1940s, 400,000 peoplein Germany had been sterilized by Nazi doctors on eugenic charges—primarilythose being found to be “mentally retarded.”When World War II broke out in 1939, sterilization of those German citizensdeemed to be retarded was replaced with a policy of euthanasia. Patients inmental hospitals were killed on charges based on theories of eugenetics by thetoo-willing doctors. Victims of these “hunts,” both adults and children, werekilled by lethal injection or more efficiently by mass gassing. In the Nazioccupied territories they were executed by the same Einsatzgruppen firing squadsthat were killing Jews and Gypsies—one armor-piercing bullet was used to killfive people in line to conserve ammunition.By 1941 some 70,000 German “mental patients” had been killed as a result of theofficial eugenic policy. This raised such a protest that Hitler gave the orderto stop gassing them but to continue to execute them by other means.Eugenics programs and Nazi racial-cleansing doctrines, in the form ofexecutions, ran parallel to this and were carried out by the millions.Unimaginable numbers were executed in the concentration death camps. Racialtheories stemmed from the policies and pursuits of the Society for RacialHygiene that had become part of the German academic thought in the years afterWorld War I. The Nuremburg Race Laws were conceived following considerableconsultations with the leading German geneticists and doctors of the day.In the 20th century, it is estimated that more than 100 million humans werekilled or starved to death by totalitarian governments impregnated with a broadcollection of bureaucratic forms of Social Darwinism.In Russia, Mendelian genetic research and cleansing practices were banned. Itwas an integral part of the Marxist beliefs that “human beings were fashioned bythe environment rather than by inborn or heritable talents.”THE LIFE AND WORK OF OSWALD AVERY AND THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTEOswald Avery was born in Canada in 1877. His father was a Baptist minister. Whenhe was the age of ten, his family moved from Nova Scotia to the Lower East Sideof New York City where Avery’s father operated a Baptist mission. His father andhis brother Ernest both died in 1892 from tuberculosis. The Baptist community(including John D. Rockefeller) supported Avery’s mother and her two survivingchildren.The year following his father’s and his brother’s deaths, Avery left high schooland enrolled in the Colgate Academy, a Baptist college, fully intending to enterthe ministry. Upon his graduation from Colgate, with no science background,Avery entered the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. In1904 he graduated as a doctor, interned in hospitals for several years, and thentook a position in medical research.In 1913 Avery took a post in the Rockefeller Institute in Manhattan. Hisresponsibility was to study Diplococcus pneumonia, a common bacteria, whichcaused the death of 50,000 Americans each year from pneumonia. For thirty-fiveyears Avery studied the bacteria. During the first ten years at the institute hestudied the polysaccharide cloak that the bacteria generated with the goal ofcreating a “serum” that would attack the “sugar-coated microbe.”Avery was nominated for a Nobel Prize for his bacterial studies. However, it washis genetic studies and his discovery of the gene that gave him a place inhistory.In 1928 Fred Griffith, an English microbiologist, published a paper on a strangephenomenon. He discovered that the non-virulent strain R of the Pneumococcusspp. bacteria could be transformed into the virulent strain S and the mutationwas inheritable!Griffith found that by injecting mice with the non-virulent R strain ofPneumococcus spp. and then with the heat-killed S strain, he could producepneumonia in the mice and then recover a live virulent S strain of the bacteriafrom the dead mouse. A non-virulent strain of bacteria had been transformed intoa virulent form of the bacteria from something that was in the heat-killedbacteria!Avery’s co-workers at the Rockefeller Institute were able to duplicateGriffith’s phenomenon in the test tube by using a simple cell-free extract ofthe heat-killed virulent bacteria to change the non-virulent bacteria into akiller. Avery now focused his energies on this inheritable phenomenon.While genetic research was morphing into a political monster in Nazi Germany andbeing suppressed in Soviet Russia, Oswald Avery and his co-workers at theRockefeller Institute were in New York were continuing to advance their studieson the Pneumococcus spp. bacterium.Between 1934 and 1937 the process of “transformation” was perfected, primarilythrough the work of Avery’s colleague, Collin MacLeod. In 1941, in cooperationwith Maclyn McCarty, a recent arrival at the institute, the goal was to isolatethe “transforming principle” from the bacteria (MacLeod had moved to take a postat New York University in 1940).With typical Avery zeal, the pair ran an endless methodical series ofexperiments to extract “the substance,” whatever it might be, from one strain ofbacteria and to purify it. They attacked the extract with several differentproteases, and yet it could still transform strain R into strain S. Therefore itcould not be a protein.Assaulting the substance with a lipid-dissolving alcohol and ether did not alterthe transforming capacity of “the substance.” Therefore it could not be a fat.They came to the conclusion that “the substance” by process of elimination hadto be a nucleic acid. However, ribonuclease, the enzyme that digests RNA did notdestroy “the substance.”By the process of elimination the only possibility left was DNA. “Levene’s dull,uninteresting molecule” was “the substance” and was producing the transformationfrom strain R to strain S!It was eventually proved that deoxyribonuclease enzymes that destroy DNA did infact inactivate “the substance”—the transforming factor was DNA!“Sounds like a virus—may be a gene,” Avery declared in a May 1943 letter to hisbrother Roy: “If we are right, and of course that’s not yet proven, then itmeans that nucleic acids are not merely structurally important, but functionallyactive substances in determining the biochemical activities and specificcharacteristics of cells, and that by means of a known chemical substance it ispossible to induce predictable and hereditary changes in the cells. This issomething that has long been the dream of geneticists . . . the problem bristleswith implications . . . It touches genetics, enzyme chemistry, cell metabolism,and carbohydrate synthesis, etc.So there is the story, Roy—right or wrong it’s been good fun and lots of work.”Avery’s discovery was an “epoch-making” event!The resulting paper by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty was published in January 1944in the Journal of Experimental Medicine and it was as classic as Mendel’sVersuche. Unfortunately the Avery team published their work in a publicationthat was read by the wrong people who were microbiologists rather thangeneticists.In 1948, by the time the scientific community had come to realize thesignificance of the “transforming principle,” it was too late. Avery retired inNashville and spent the remainder of his life near his brother and family, dyingin 1955. His thirty-five years of research that had been focused on a singlebacterium had “delivered up the most seminal discovery of 20th century biology.”However, the author of the research never received the ultimate accolade, theNobel Prize.THE ROLE OF PROTEINS IN MOLECULAR ORGANIC EVENTSMendel and Avery were looking at the same molecular events from differentdirections. Proteins were at the roots of both their observations. Proteins are“polymers” of amino acids that are found in a wide variety of configurations andmass. The three-dimensional diversity of proteins is related to the basicstructural uniqueness.Differences in protein length, amino acid sequences, the number of disulfidebonds, and connections of small molecules or ions to the amino acid side chainscontrol the three dimensional diversity. Generally, the linear, unbranchedpolymer of amino acids that make up any protein can fold into a few tightlyrelated three dimensional shapes called conformations. The physical conformationof a protein, along with the distinctive chemical properties of its amino acidside chains, will determine its functions.Proteins produce and initiate a wide variety of distinct events inside andoutside of cells that are essential to life or provide distinct evolutionaryadvantages to cells, tissues, organs and organisms. It is therefore paramount tothe understanding of how cells work and reproduce to identify the specificstructures and functions of proteins.Generally, proteins can be placed into broad functional groups: 1. Structural proteins that determine the shapes of cells, their extracellular environments, and act as “guide wires” to direct the intracellular activities of molecules and organelles. 2. Scaffold proteins that join different proteins into specific arrays to perform specific functions more efficiently than if the proteins were separate entities. 3. Enzymes that are proteins that catalyze or facilitate specific chemical reactions. 4. Membrane transport proteins that facilitate the flow of ions and molecules across cellular membranes. 5. Regulatory proteins that perform as signals, sensors, and switches to regulate the activities of cells by directing the functions of other proteins and genes. 6. Signaling proteins (hormones and cell-surface receptors) that transmit extracellular signals into the cells cytoplasm. 7. Motor proteins that have the task of moving other proteins, organelles, ells, and even whole organisms. 8. Molecular machines Any one protein can be a member of more than one protein group or class (e.g., cell surface signaling receptors that are both enzymes and regulatory proteins).Proteins essentially mediate or facilitate diverse functions by directing asmall number of basic activities. Proteins bind to other proteins andmacromolecules such as DNA, small molecules, and ions. In most cases thesebinding events produce a conformational change in the protein which directs itsactivities.A complete directory of how proteins encourage and direct cells to live andflourish requires the identification and characterization of the proteinsemployed by a cell. In a sense, the ultimate goal of molecular cell biologistsis to compile a complete protein “parts catalogue” and construct anall-inclusive cook book that describes how these proteins function. Compiling acomprehensive protein catalogue has become feasible in recent years with thesequencing of entire genomes—complete sets of genes (of many organisms). Thehuman genome contains 25,000 genes that make and direct the function ofproteins.Proteome refers to the complete collection of proteins of an organism. The humanproteome is comprised of 33,000 different proteins. By studying proteinsequences and structures of unknown proteins and comparing them with proteins ofknown function, one can predict some possible functions of the unknown.The primary structure of a protein is the linear arrangement, or sequence, ofthe amino acids that it is comprised of. A short chain of amino acids (less than20 to 30 amino acid residues) linked by the peptide bonds and that has adistinct sequence is called an oligopeptide, or just peptide; long chains ofamino acids are referred to as polypeptides (more than 200 to 500 amino acidresidues).The second level of protein structure is the secondary structure, which arestable spatial arrangements of segments of a polypeptide chain that are heldtogether by hydrogen bonds that connect the backbone amide and carbonyl groupsand frequently involve repeating structural patterns. A single polypeptide mightcontain several types of secondary structures in various portions of the chain.The principal secondary structures are the alpha helix, the beta sheet, and aU-shaped beta turn.Proteins are highly adaptable “molecular machines,” switches, cellularcatalysts, and components of cellular, tissue, and organ structure.Nucleic acids are linear polymers of four different types of nucleotides. Thesemacromolecules contain an exact sequence of their nucleotides which carry thespecific information to determine the amino acid sequence, structure, andfunction of the proteins in the cell; they are necessary functional componentsof the cellular macromolecular factories that select and line up amino acids ina proper order as a polypeptide chain is being synthesized; and they catalyze acluster of peptide bonds between amino acids during protein synthesis.Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an informational molecule that contains in thesequence of its nucleotides the data required to synthesize all of the proteinsfound in the organism including the cells, tissues, and organs of that organism.DNA is ideally configured to perform this function on a molecular level andchemically DNA is extremely stable (enabling the recovery of the DNA sequencesfrom animal and plant fossils that are thousands of years old).All of the information required to support the development of the fertilizedhuman egg (zygote) through the various stages of the embryo, to childhood, andto an adult made up of trillions of specialized cells is stored in the sequenceof the four nucleotides that make up the = 3 x 109 base pairs of the humangenome. The exact replication of this information for all species ensures itsgenetic replication from one generation to the next, and the health of the DNAis therefore critical for the normal development of the individual organism. DNAfulfills these functions so well that it is the vessel for (the transmission) ofgenetic information in all forms of life known on earth.The information that is stored in DNA is clustered into hereditary packagesreferred to as “genes.” In turn the genes control the specific traits of eachspecies.In the process known as “transcription” the information stored in the DNA iscopied into ribonucleic acid (RNA), which has three specific responsibilities inprotein synthesis, as described by H. Lodish, et al. in Molecular Cell Biology,6th Edition:Portions of the DNA nucleotide sequence are copied into messenger RNA (mRNA)molecules that direct the synthesis of a specific protein. The nucleotidesequence of an mRNA molecule contains the information that specifies the correctorder of amino acids during the synthesis of a protein. The remarkably accurate,stepwise assembly of amino acids into proteins occurs by translation of mRNA. Inthis process, the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule is “read” by a secondtype of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA), and their associated proteins. As thecorrect amino acids are brought into sequence by tRNAs, they are linked bypeptide bonds to make proteins. RNA synthesis is called transcription becausethe nucleotide sequence ‘language’ of DNA is precisely copied, or transcribed,into the nucleotide sequence of an RNA molecule. Protein synthesis is referredto as translation because the nucleotide sequence language of DNA and RNA istranslated into the amino acid sequence language of proteins.DNA and RNA are similar from a chemical definition; primary structures of DNAand RNA are linear polymers made up of monomers named nucleotides. Both DNA andRNA act primarily as informational molecules, carrying information in the exactpredictable sequence of their nucleotides. Cellular RNAs typically vary inlength from fewer than 100 to many thousands of nucleotides. Cellular DNAmolecules can contain as many as several hundred million nucleotides. Theselarge DNA structures in association with proteins can be stained and viewedthrough the light microscope as chromosomes (this was the name given for thembecause they can be stained for identification).Though chemically similar, DNA and RNA are characterized by significantdifferences. It is, however, the different and individual properties of DNA andRNA that give them the specific place in cell function.In all organisms, DNA and RNA are both made up of four different nucleotides.The nucleotides employed in the synthesis of DNA and RNA one of five differentbases. The bases adenine (A) and guanine (G) are purines, which contain a pairof fused rings; the bases cytosine (C), thymine (T), and urasil (U) arepyrimidines, which contain a single ring.Three of these bases, A, G, and C are found in both DNA and RNA; However, T isonly found in DNA, and U only in RNA. The linear sequence of nucleotidesconnected by phosphodiester bonds makes up the primary structure of the nucleicacids. Similar to polypeptides, polynucleotides can twist and fold intothree-dimensional structures stabilized by noncovalent bonds. The primarystructures of DNA and RNA are similar, yet their three-dimensional structuresare different.AN ALTERNATE THEORY OF DISEASE TRANSMISSIONThe science of “molecular biology” began in 1953 when James D. Watson, anAmerican, and Francis H. C. Crick, an Englishman, proposed that the structure ofDNA was a double helix. Their original proposal of the DNA structure was basedon an analysis of x-ray diffraction studies by Rosalind Franklin and MauriceWilliams and the construction of chemical models.The genetic theory of disease transmission has dominated the funding, research,and marketing direction of the medical and pharmaceutical industries throughoutthe 20th and 21st centuries. The genetic theory of disease transmission is basedon misinterpretation of observations, lack of complete information, isolatedfacts, descriptions of events and dogma.The genetic theory of disease transmission poses the following: “Inherited humandiseases are the phenotypic consequence of defective human genes. Although a‘disease’ gene may result from a new mutation that arose in the precedinggeneration, most cases of ‘inherited’ diseases are caused by preexisting mutantalleles that have been passed from one generation to the next for manygenerations.”The current genetic theory of disease transmission goes on to declare that:“Human genetic diseases that result from mutation in one specific gene exhibitseveral inheritance patterns depending on the nature and chromosomal location ofthe alleles that cause them.”It is also said by geneticists that “the characteristic pattern is thatexhibited by a dominant allele in an autosome (that is, one of the 22 humanchromosomes that is not a sex chromosome). It is often the case that thediseases caused by dominant alleles appear later in life after reproductiveage.”(In fact, Wallach maintains that this pattern of the time of appearance of thedisease is a signal that the disease is not genetically transmitted!).Huntington’s DiseaseThe theorized iconic example of an autosomal dominant disease in humans isHuntington’s disease, a neural degenerative disease that generally strikes inmid-to-late life.The Merck Manual describes Huntington’s disease (aka Huntington’s chorea) “as aninherited disease in which people in midlife begin having occasional jerks orspasms and gradual loss of brain cells, progressive to chorea, athetosis, andmental deterioration.”During the early stages of Huntington’s disease, people can blend thespontaneous abnormal movements into intentional ones so that they’re barelynoticeable. However, with time, the movements become more obvious. Eventually,the abnormal movements involve the entire body so that eating, dressing, andeven sitting still become nearly impossible.Mental changes in Huntington’s disease are subtle at first. People afflictedwith the disease may gradually become irritable and excitable; they may loseinterest in their usual activities. Later in the course of the disease, theybehave irresponsibly and often wander aimlessly. They may lose control overtheir impulses and become promiscuous. Over years or decades, they may losetheir memory and the ability to think rationally. They may become severelydepressed and attempt suicide. In advanced disease, almost all functions becomeimpaired and full-time assistance or nursing home care is needed. Death is oftenprecipitated by pneumonia or a fatal injury from falling and usually occurs 13to 15 years after symptoms first appeared.”One of the earliest physical signs of Huntington’s disease is chorea,involuntary movements. The problems with involuntary movements are usually verysubtle in the beginning stages of the disease and are typically described as aslow motion type of movements or bradykinesia. The Huntington’s patient’s speechcan become slurred. As the disease progresses, dystonia becomes obvious as limbsbeing held in unnatural positions. Pharmaceuticals, occupational therapists,speech therapy, and physical therapy are typical treatment avenues as themedical thought is that Huntington’s disease is a terminalgenetically-transmitted disease and they believe that “No cure exists.”At autopsy, the brain of a Huntington’s disease patient is smaller than that ofa normal average human brain in volume and weight. When the normal brain is cutinto there is a division of the cortex (grey matter) and the myelin (whitematter). At the base of the brain is more grey matter: this area of the greymatter is be easily viewed. This area of the grey matter contains a greaternumber of nerve cells and is called the basal ganglia. In this section of thebrain it can be divided into two parts, which are called the caudate nucleus andthe putamen. Cells in the caudate and putamen (medium spiny neurons) thatcontain GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) are particularly sensitive to theoxidative damage typically found in Huntington’s disease.If one looks at the brain of a Huntington’s disease patient there are folds onthe surface that are wider, and the basal ganglia are reduced to a thin rim oftissue. Although the major damage occurs in the basal ganglia, damage oftenoccurs to the other parts of the brain which produces a wide spectrum ofsymptoms.The basic responsibility of the cells of the basal ganglia is to co-ordinate theactivities of the neurons in the cortex to signal changes in various musclegroups to create a smooth continuum of movement. Damage to the indirect pathwaytends to produce chorea, while damage to the direct pathway producesbradykinesia.The medical system divides dementia into the cortical or subcortical forms.Alzheimer’s disease falls into the cortical dementia column; Huntington’sdisease, Parkinson’s disease, and others fall into the subcortical dementias.In fact, Huntington’s disease is not a genetically-transmitted disease asdictated by the current medical dogma, but is rather part of a kaleidoscope ofrelated diseases caused by a common oxidative assault and common nutritionaldeficiencies, and by random chance different parts of the brain are moreseverely damaged than others, causing the different clinical appearances:Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological disorder beginning in childhood in whichmotor and vocal tics occur on a regular basis throughout the day. The appearanceof Tourette’s syndrome occurs early in childhood and steadily progresses tobursts of complex movements, including vocal tics and sudden, spasticrespiration. Vocal tics may start as grunting or barking noises and progress tocompulsive, involuntary bouts of cursing. (Wallach personally suffered fromTourette’s syndrome as a four-year-old child. With supplementation of all 90essential nutrients, at the age of nine years he resolved his disease in threedays.)Chorea and Athetosis The chorea is expressed as repetitive, brief, jerky,large-scale, dancing-like, uncontrolled movements that begin in one part of thebody and moves location abruptly, unpredictably, and continuously to otherlocations. Athetosis is a continuous stream of slow, sinuous, writhingmovements, generally in the hands and feet. Chorea and athetosis can occurtogether and are called choreoathetosis. People with chorea and athetosis havelesions and abnormalities in the basal ganglia.Sydenham’s disease St. Vitus’ dance or Syndenham’s chorea is a childhood diseasethat frequently follows Streptococcal spp. infections.Dystonia presents itself as involuntary, slow, repetitive, sustained musclecontractions that produce “freezing” in the middle of an action, with twisting,turning, or torsion movements of the trunk, the entire body, or different zonesof the body. The brain areas affected include the basal ganglia, thalamus, andcerebral cortex. Mild forms of dystonia can manifest itself as writer’s cramps,blepharospasm (eyelids repeatedly and involuntarily forced shut), torticollis(recurring neck spasms that twist the neck sideways, forward, or backward),spasmodic dysphonia (spasms of vocal cord muscles that block speech, make speechsound strained, quivery, hoarse, jerky, creaky, staccato, or garbled anddifficult to understand), and yips (golfer’s dystonia or musician’s dystonia).Parkinson’s disease develops during middle age, and is characterized as a slowlyprogressing, degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Parkinson’sdisease produces tremor (chorea) when at rest, sluggish and slow movements(bradykinesia), and muscle rigidity. The basal ganglia are directly affected inParkinson’s disease resulting in jerky movements.In Parkinson’s disease, the neurons in the basal ganglia degenerate. The diseasebegins subtly and progresses gradually. In many individuals it begins with atremor in the hand when the hand is at rest. The tremor decreases when the handis moving purposefully and disappears completely during sleep. Emotional stressor fatigue may increase the tremor, which has a smooth, rhythmic quality.Although the tremor may start in one hand, it eventually progresses to the otherhand the arms, and the legs. The jaw, tongue, forehead, and eyelids additionallymay be affected by tremors. In about one third of those with Parkinson’sdisease, tremors aren’t the first symptom; in other individuals the tremorsbecome less severe as the disease progresses; and in others the tremors neverdevelop.Initiating a movement is particularly difficult in those afflicted withParkinson’s disease, and muscle stiffness (rigidity) develops. The small musclesof the hands lose function and dexterity which makes simple jobs such asbuttoning a garment and tying shoe laces difficult. Parkinson’s disease patientswalk with a shuffling, short-stepped gait in which their arms don’t swing withtheir stride. The typical patient’s face becomes expressionless and can developa blank stare with an open mouth and a reduced blinking rate.Individuals with Parkinson’s disease will speak softly in a monotone and maystutter. Most will maintain a normal intelligence; however, others will developdementia.Progressive supranuclear palsy is seen with less frequency than Parkinson’sdisease. It produces muscle rigidity, inability to control eye movement, andweakness of the throat muscles. This disease typically shows up in the latemiddle age with difficulty in rolling the eyes upward. As with Parkinson’sdisease, this palsy progresses to advanced stiffness and disability. The diseasedestroys the basal ganglia and brain stem.Shy-Drager syndrome (idiopathic orthostatic hypotension) is similar toParkinson’s disease, additionally it causes malfunction and destruction of theautonomic nervous system, which regulates the blood pressure, heart rate, glandsecretions, and visual focusing. The blood pressure falls when the patientstands up. The volume of sweat, tears and saliva falls, eyesight fails,urination becomes difficult, constipation is typical and movement syndromes aresimilar to those of patients with Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease.CAUSES FOR DISEASE SYMDOMES WITH BRAIN LESIONS THAT SHARE A BROAD SYMPTOM LISTMany individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease),Alzheimer’s disease, Korsakoff’s syndrome (cerebral beriberi),Wernicke-Korsakoff’s syndrome (cerebral beriberi and multiple sclerosiscombined), and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (BSE, Mad Cow Disease, enzootic ataxia,etc.) share the broad symptom list and brain lesion list with Huntington’sdisease.These diseases traditionally have affected middle-aged people starting at about35 years of age. Starting in the year 2000, the demographics changed with thefastest growing age group diagnosed with MS, ALS, etc., being children under theage of 12 years and the youngest individuals diagnosed with these diseases foundto be 18 to 20 months of age. All are caused by free radical damage of the brainthat results from inordinately high intakes of trans-fatty acids, heterocyclicamines, and acrylamides.There are no rules that state one individual can’t have two, three, or more ofthese disease syndromes at the same time. None of these diseases are geneticallytransmitted; however, they may appear “familial” because of a pervasive glutenintolerance being passed on through generations by the female siblings beingsensitized to gluten through cord blood and breast milk. Males also acquiregluten intolerance from their mothers, but because they do not carry pregnanciesor breast feed their offspring they do not pass on gluten intolerance, which isa contact enteritis rather than an allergy based syndrome.The basic array of brain lesions and chemical derailment of all of the aboveneurological disease syndromes are the result of simple “dumb luck” orrandomized distribution of and combinations of two universal events: 1. Free radical damage resulting from the regular consumption of gluten, fried foods, burnt animal fat, oxidized dietary oils, processed meats containing nitrates, and other nitrites and excessive mono or polyunsaturated oils. On occasion consumption of certain pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and toxic levels of certain food additives, such as high levels of manganese (Parkinsonism), can produce symptoms of these disease syndromes. 2. Nutritional deficiencies that produce the biochemical disruption of brain function and the physical lesions of these diseases. In addition to low levels of nutrients in local food supplies, absorption problems related to gluten intolerance will produce an increased risk for acquiring these diseases. YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU EAT—YOU ARE WHAT YOU ABSORB!To prevent, and in many cases resolve, this family of basal-ganglia deficiencydiseases one should be obsessive about proper dietary changes. Consume four tosix eggs per day (poached, soft boiled, and scrambled in butter) per 100 poundsof body weight, supplement with all 90 essential nutrients and additionalantioxidants to levels in excess of 100,000 ORAC points per day.A recessive allele in an autosome exhibits quite a different segregationpattern. For an autosomal recessive allele, both parents must be heterozygouscarriers of the allele in order for their children to be at risk of beingaffected with the disease. Each child of heterozygous parents has a 25 percentchance of receiving both recessive alleles and thus being affected, a 50 percentchance of receiving one normal and one mutant allele, and thus being a carrier,and a 25 percent chance of receiving two normal alleles.Cystic fibrosisAn iconic example pointed to by geneticists as the text book example of anautosomal recessive disease is cystic fibrosis. Typically, related individualsexhibit a relatively higher rate of being “carriers” for the same recessivealleles. Therefore, children born to related parents (such as those are first orsecond cousins) are much more prone than those born to unrelated parents to behomozygous for expression of the autosomal recessive disorder.Cystic fibrosis is currently and conventionally “thought to be agenetically-transmitted disease that causes certain glands to produce abnormalsecretions, resulting in several symptoms, the most important of which affectthe digestive tract and lungs.”Cystic fibrosis is listed in The Merck Manual as “the most common inheriteddisease leading to death among white people in the United States. It occurs in 1of every 2,500 white babies and in 1 of every 17,000 black babies. It’s rare inAsians. Cystic fibrosis is equally common in boys and girls. Many people withcystic fibrosis die young, but 35 percent of Americans with cystic fibrosisreach adulthood.”Meconium ileus, a form of intestinal obstruction in newborns, occurs in 17percent of children with cystic fibrosis. Meconium is an abnormally solid formof feces of the newborn that is produced by the fetus gulping down a gluten-richamniotic fluid that in turn produces a “contact enteritis” and a permanentgluten intolerant state in the individual. It appears as a dark green bowelmovement that is thick and passes only with great difficulty. If the meconium istoo thick, it obstructs the intestine. Blockage can result in a perforated bowelor torsion of the gut. The meconium can also create plugs in the largeintestine, rectum, or anus and again cause obstruction. Newborn babies withmeconium ileus almost always will test positive for cystic fibrosis. Meconiumileus is a common manifestation of gluten intolerance in the newborn thatresults in a lifelong battle with malabsorption.In newborn children with cystic fibrosis, the level of the digestive enzymetrypsin in the blood is high. This enzyme level is measured in a small drop ofblood collected on a piece of filter paper. This is a non-conclusive screeningtest. The quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test measures the amountof salt in sweat and a positive reading is considered to be a confirming“genetic marker” for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.”A sweat-salt concentration above the normal level confirms the diagnosis ofcystic fibrosis. However, a positive sweat test is also found in seventeen otherdiseases including gluten intolerance, celiac disease, sprue, starvation,kwashiorkor, zinc deficiency, etc., and is easily brought back to normal with agluten-free diet and a proper supplement program that gives optimal levels ofall 90 essential nutrients with additional selenium added.By the age of 20 years many cystic fibrosis patients will develop type 2diabetes because of the loss of intestinal villi (related to glutenintolerance/contact enteritis) results in malabsorption of the minerals that arerequired to prevent diabetes. A gluten-free diet, supplementation with the 90essential nutrients, and extra selenium, chromium, and vanadium can “support andpromote” optimal metabolism of carbohydrates, sugars, fats, and proteins at thecellular level, “support” healthy blood sugar levels, and reverse the “geneticmarkers” of cystic fibrosis.In fact, cystic fibrosis is not a genetically-transmitted disease, but insteadis a congenital or neonatal deficiency disease of the trace mineral selenium(refer to Wallach, J.D. and Germaise, B.: Cystic Fibrosis: A PerinatalManifestation of Selenium Deficiency. In: Hemphill, D. D. (ed). Trace substancesin environmental health XIII. University of Missouri Press, Columbia, MO., 1979pp. 469–476.) Families with generations of cystic fibrosis typically have agluten intolerance that is passed on through generations by the mothers throughthe cord blood or breast milk. Studies show that even couples who are bothcystic fibrosis patients produce normal babies. This result is impossible in theclassic recessive genetically-transmitted disease model.THE DISCOVERY OF FIRST NON-HUMAN CASE OF CYSTIC FIBROSISIn November of 1977, Wallach while employed at the Yerkes Primate Center,identified the first non-human case of cystic fibrosis in a failure-to-thriverhesus monkey that was six months old. Wallach sought out and acquired theappropriate validation of his diagnosis by the appropriate cystic fibrosisexperts, which caused Emory University and the Yerkes Regional Primate ResearchCenter to send out a news release (1978) lauding the confirmed discovery.Three months later Wallach was terminated from his position as a pathologist atthe Yerkes Primate Center when he complied with a request to provide an abstractfor an NIH animal model committee presentation. Wallach was then asked how manycystic fibrosis monkeys could he provide for research? Wallach’s answer was thathe had discovered at the very least how to create an animal model for furtherresearch—the reason given for no progress in the understanding of the genesis ofcystic fibrosis was the lack of a reproducible credible animal model. He wasfired for inferring that cystic fibrosis was not a genetic disease, but rather acongenital and or a perinatal deficiency of the trace mineral selenium.News Copy fromEMORY UNIVERSITYSunday, March 5, 1978Subject: First case of Cystic Fibrosis discovered in non-humanScientists at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center at Emory Universityhave discovered cystic fibrosis in a young rhesus monkey from an autopsy, whichis the first nonhuman case of this disease known to medical science. “Thisappears to be the first animal model of cystic fibrosis, and we are excitedabout its implications, “says Drs. Joel Wallach and Harold McClure, who areveterinary pathologists at the Yerkes Research Center.Since cystic fibrosis is thought to be a genetic disease, there is a possibilitythat the parents and/or relatives of the affected monkey can have additionaloffspring with cystic fibrosis. An animal model of cystic fibrosis will permitinvestigators to learn a great deal about the basic causes of the disease andhow it might be treated, the Yerkes scientists explained. At present, the basiccause and defect of cystic fibrosis is not known.Cystic fibrosis is a disease of children, adolescents, and young adults which ischaracterized by abnormal mucus secretions and fibrous scarring in variousorgans like the pancreas, liver, lungs, reproductive and digestive systems. Manyof its victims die in early life of complications such as malabsorption andpneumonia.More than 25,000 white people in the United States have the disease, but a muchlarger number, five percent of the entire white population, are thought to becarriers of the recessive gene of cystic fibrosis. It is rarely seen in theblack population or in people of Asiatic origin.The discovery of the cystic fibrosis in the monkey came as Dr. Wallach,assistant veterinary pathologist at the Yerkes Center, was performing a routineautopsy on a six month old male rhesus monkey that had died of unknown causes.He noticed pancreatic disease and bronchial mucus production. Evaluation of thistissue later under a microscope revealed “a classic textbook case” of cysticfibrosis as pictured in human medical literature, Dr. Wallach said.Studies of tissue from other organs confirmed that the monkey was indeed avictim of cystic fibrosis according to Dr. Joel Wallach. His diagnosis wasreaffirmed by Dr. Victor Nasar, an Emory pediatric pathologist at Atlanta’sGrady Memorial Hospital and by Dr. John Easterly, a pathologist at the ChicagoLying-In Hospital and a national authority on cystic fibrosis.A report on the discovery was made on Saturday, March 4, 1978 at a PrimatePathology workshop held in Atlanta. Drs. Wallach and McClure gave thepresentation at Emory’s Glenn Memorial building near Grady Hospital.They said the infected animal was bred in a colony of rhesus monkeys supportedby the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for studies pertaining tothe U.S. space program. “What we have here is a classic example of serendipity,”claim Drs. Wallach and McClure. “These animals were being studied for the spaceprogram but are now also providing us clues in a different area altogether.”Dr. Nelly Golarz de Bourne, a behavioral researcher at the Yerkes Center, isconducting NASA studies on the monkey colony in collaboration with Dr. GeoffreyH. Bourne, the director at The Yerkes Center. Their records go back at least tenyears, and include information pertaining to breeding and diseases of theanimals.“We can now go back and look at slides of the animals that died to see whetherany of them might have had any of the more subtle changes of cystic fibrosis,”Dr. McClure explained. “This discovery has made us aware that these animals canhave the disease, so we can pursue new cases, both in the past and future. If wecan breed a supply of animals with cystic fibrosis, using the parents, siblings,or other relatives with cystic fibrosis, this would be a great boon toresearchers.”Until recently, research efforts toward understanding and curing cystic fibrosishave been severely hampered by lack of an animal model. “We are very fortunatethat the rhesus monkey is the animal model that was found by Dr. Wallach,because more is known about this animal than about any other nonhuman primate,”states Dr. McClure. “They are also available for research in fairly largequantities.”Dr. James A. Peters, medical director of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation that hasits headquarters in Atlanta, commented, “We eagerly await the result’s of Dr.Wallach’s studies because of the importance of an animal model to both basic andclinical research on cystic fibrosis.”Dr. Peters noted that Dr. Wallach will participate in a May 25–26, 1978 workshopin Bethesda, MD., speaking about the animal model now available for the study ofcystic fibrosis. The workshop is jointly sponsored by the U.S. NationalInstitute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Disease and the CysticFibrosis Foundation.image [../images/00003.jpeg]Wallach was invited to present a paper on his findings about cystic fibrosis tothe NIH Animal Model Conference in Maryland at the NIH Campus. He was asked foran abstract of his presentation, and when he noted that the cystic fibrosis inthe rhesus monkey was caused by a selenium deficiency in the diet of a smallcolony of rhesus monkeys that were being used to raise baby monkeys for spaceresearch by NASA, Wallach was summarily terminated from his post and blackballedfrom working as a pathologist.Wallach attended the National College of Naturopathic Medicine and taughtnutrition at the college in Portland, Oregon. His purpose was to become anaturopathic physician (ND) so that he could treat cystic fibrosis children withhis nutritional approach.In 1990 Wallach and Ma Lan went to China with the financial help of Wallach’smother and the academic introductions of Ma Lan’s father’s (Ma Do) and mother’s(Xia Pin) academic connections in China and they performed 1,700 autopsies onchildren under the age of ten years of age in Keshan Provence. The purpose wasto examine children who had died of Keshan disease, a known selenium-deficiencydisease that resulted in death from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Wallach posited that if his observation was correct, that cystic fibrosis was infact due to a congenital or postnatal selenium deficiency, then surely some ofthe Keshan disease children would also have cystic fibrosis. The result of thestudy was that in fact that 595 or 35 percent of the Keshan disease childrenautopsied also exhibited the classic gross and microscopic pancreatic, liver,heart, and lung disease consistent with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, and 100percent exhibited the classic heart disease consistent with a diagnosis of“mulberry heart disease,” a classic manifestation of selenium-deficiencymuscular dystrophy in swine (see Wallach, J.D., Ma, L., et al.: Commondenominators in the etiology and pathology of visceral lesions of cysticfibrosis and Keshan disease. Biol Trace El. Res. 24:189–205. 1990.)The implementation of a gluten-free diet and the supplementation of the 90essential nutrients and extra selenium has reversed the positive sweat test(i.e., the “genetic marker” for cystic fibrosis) in an Italian cystic fibrosisbaby as measured in a blind study by an Italian pediatric hospital.AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY TO CONVENTIONAL THOUGHT ABOUT THE CAUSE OF DUCHENNEMUSCULAR DYSTOPHYThe third commonly accepted theorized pattern of inheritance is that of anX-linked recessive allele. According to the Merck Manual: The medical dogma forthis poses that a recessive allele on the X chromosome will most often beexpressed in males, who receive only one X chromosome from their mother, but notin females, who receive an X chromosome from both their mother and their father.This theory states that this leads to a distinctive sex-linked segregationpattern where the disease is exhibited much more frequently in males than infemales.For example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a muscle degenerative diseasethat specifically affects males, is thought to be caused by a recessive alleleon the X chromosome. DMD exhibits the typical sex-linked segregation pattern inwhich mothers who are heterozygous and therefore phenotypically normal can actas carriers, transmitting the DMD allele, and therefore the disease, to 50percent of their male progeny.Wallach proposes an alternative theory. This is that the different and variousmanifestations of muscular dystrophy are the result of a deficiency of seleniumand by random chance different muscle groups and concurrent nutrientdeficiencies of additional essential nutrients (such as vitamin E, sulphur,methionine, zinc, omega 3-fatty acids, etc.). The genetic theory posits that thegene defect that causes DMD is different from the one that causes Becker’smuscular dystrophy, but both defects involve the same gene. The gene isrecessive and is carried on the X chromosome. While a female can carry thedefective gene, she doesn’t have the disease because the normal X chromosomecompensates for the gene defect on the other X chromosome. However, any male whoreceives the defective X chromosome will have the disease.Children with Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy have a reduced level of dystrophin,an essential muscle protein involved in the basic structure of muscle cells.Twenty to thirty boys of every 100,000 born have DMD while three of every100,000 contract Becker’s muscular dystrophy. Female children with subclinicalmuscular dystrophy tend to have a high rate of clinically significant scoliosis.DMD tends to display symptoms between the ages of three and seven as a weaknessof the pelvic muscles making it difficult to stand up from a deep squatposition, as determined by the Wallach/Ropp test. Weakness in the shouldermuscles soon follows and steadily progresses. As the skeletal muscles becomeweaker they tend to hypertrophy. In 90 percent of the children with DMD, theheart muscle hypertrophies (as shown in Keshan disease, hypertrophiccardiomyopathy, and “mulberry heart disease” of swine) and is often the ultimatecause of death.Children with DMD tend to waddle, fall frequently, have difficulty in climbingstairs and rising from a sitting position; the afflicted muscles of the arms andlegs contract at the joints, producing a limit in extension of knees and elbows.By age 10 to 12 years of age most children with muscular dystrophy are confinedto a wheelchair and most unsupplemented muscular dystrophy patients die by theage of 20 years.Children with Becker’s muscular dystrophy tend to have less severe symptoms anda later onset of disease at about age 10 years. Few are confined in wheelchairsand 90 percent are still alive at age 20 years.Landouzy-Dejerine muscular dystrophy is said by dogma to be transmitted by an“autosomal dominant gene”; therefore, in this model, only one abnormal gene cancause the disease. In this form of muscular dystrophy, both males and femalesare afflicted at the same rate, the symptoms begin between the ages of 7 and 20years. This form of muscular dystrophy always involves the facial and shouldermuscles, making it difficult for patients to raise their arms, whistle, andclose their eyes. Some will also develop the typical leg weakness of Duchenne’smuscular dystrophy.Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies cause weakness in the muscles of either thepelvis (Leyden-Mobius muscular dystrophy) or the shoulder (Erb’s musculardystrophy).Mitochondrial myopathies are thought by dogma to be transmitted through faultymitochondrial genes. These forms of myopathies are rare and typically causeweakness in single muscle groups such as the eye muscles (e.g.,ophthalmoplegia).The different forms of muscular dystrophy are in fact the same disease and notcaused by different genes. Instead the various manifestations of musculardystrophy occur by dumb luck, random chance, and a combination of concurrentdeficiencies of multiple nutrients in addition to the selenium deficiency.Positive muscle biopsy and elevated blood creatinine levels are required to makea diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. The microscopic changes in the muscle fibersafflicted with muscular dystrophy typically have hypertrophy, lose theircontractile striations, and display a classic wax-like hyaline change.The genetic model for muscular dystrophy is declared to be incurable. But withan obsessive avoidance of gluten along with supplementation with the 90essential nutrients and the addition of extra selenium can prevent and reverseall forms of muscular dystrophy. The earlier the gluten-free diet is employedand the nutrient treatment begins in the patient’s life, the more rapid,dramatic, and complete are the results. In livestock, injections of a mixture ofselenium and vitamin E to calves, lambs, kids, and piglets afflicted with “whitemuscle disease” (aka muscular dystrophy) cures the disease in days.However, the current medical approach to human muscular dystrophy is surgery,prednisone, crutches, braces and wheelchairs, and the advice to consult agenetic counselor."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENLINUS PAULING: POLYMATHLinus Pauling is widely considered the greatest chemist of his century. Mostscientists create a niche for themselves, an area where they feel secure, butPauling had an enormously wide range of scientific interests: quantum mechanics,crystallography, mineralogy, structural chemistry, anesthesia, immunology,medicine, evolution, etc. In all these fields and especially in the borderregions between them, he saw where the problems lay, and, backed up by hisspeedy assimilation of the essential facts and by (means) of his prodigiousmemory, he made distinctive and decisive contributions. He is best known,perhaps, for his insights into chemical bonding, for the discovery of theprincipal elements of protein secondary structure, the alpha-helix and thebeta-sheet, and for the first identification of a molecular disease (sickle-cellanemia), but there are a multitude of other important contributions.Pauling was one of the founders of the scientific field of molecular biology inthe true sense of the term. For these achievements, he was awarded the 1954Nobel Prize in Chemistry.—Jack DunitzLifestory: Linus Pauling,produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation, 1997Linus Pauling felt very deeply that he had been shaped by the values of theWestern frontier: self-sufficiency, restless energy, love of nature,inquisitiveness, and hard work. One can see these traits in his scientificcareer, as his insatiable curiosity drove him from one field to another. Heliked to work on the frontiers of knowledge, not in safe, crowded fields andmany of his greatest discoveries were made in the interstices, betweendisciplines—between chemistry and physics, chemistry and biology, chemistry andmedicine. Francis Crick once called him, “the greatest chemist in the world.”When Pauling was born, chemistry was a discipline dominated by Germans, but whenhe died, it was dominated by Americans, and Linus Pauling did much to bringabout this transformation.—Robert J. ParadowskiLinus Pauling: Scientist and PeacemakerLinus Carl Pauling was born on February 28, 1901 in Portland, Oregon, to Hermanand Lucy Isabelle (Darling) Pauling, nicknamed “Belle.” He was named Linus afterBelle’s father and Carl after Herman’s father.In 1905 the Paulings moved to the farming town of Condon, Oregon, where Hermanopened a drug store. William P. Murphy, who would win the Nobel Prize inMedicine in 1934, also lived in Condon at that time.In 1909 Herman moved the entire family back to Portland after a fire totallydestroyed the drug store. A year later, on May12, Herman Pauling wrote a letterto the Portland Oregonian about his nine-year-old son who “is a great reader”and deeply interested in ancient history and the natural sciences. He also askedreaders of the newspaper to advise him about the proper works to procure for hischild, who has “prematurely developed inclinations.”One month later, on June 11, Herman Pauling died suddenly of a perforatedgastric ulcer complicated by peritonitis.In 1914, after observing an exciting chemical reaction in the makeshift bedroomlaboratory of his high school classmate, Lloyd Alexander Jeffress, Pauling madeup his mind to become a chemist.In 1916, in the spring term at Washington High School, Pauling entered into hisfirst chemistry class.In 1917, in the spring term, Pauling applied for two semesters of AmericanHistory, which were required subjects prior to graduation; however, theprincipal would not let him take both courses at the same time, which resultedin Pauling not getting a high school diploma. On October 6, 1917, Paulingentered the Oregon Agricultural College, which eventually became Oregon StateUniversity in Corvallis.In 1925 Pauling earned his PhD in chemistry, minoring in physics andmathematics, with his dissertation entitled, “The Determination with X-rays ofthe Structure of Crystals.”In 1926, in January, the Guggenheim Fellowships were announced and Pauling waschosen as a fellow and he goes to Europe.In 1927 one of Pauling’s greatest works was published: “The TheoreticalPrediction of the Physical Properties of Many-Electron Atoms and Ions, MoleRefraction, Diamagnetic Susceptibility, and Extension in Space.” That yearPauling returned to Caltech and was named Assistant Professor of TheoreticalChemistry.In July of 1930 Pauling worked on quantum mechanics in Germany at ArnoldSommerfeld’s Institute for Theoretical Physics. While visiting Ludwigshafen,Pauling got Hermann Mark’s permission to use his electron-diffraction techniquesat Caltech.In December, Pauling developed a new theory of the quantum mechanics of thechemical bond. He published a paper in the Journal of the American ChemicalSociety entitled “The Nature of the Chemical Bond.” Prior to Pauling’s landmarkpaper, chemists believed there were two types of chemical bonds: (1) Ionic: whenone atom gives up an electron to another, and (2) covalent: when atoms shareelectrons. Pauling posed that the chemical bond was not that simple; in fact hedemonstrated that electron sharing was somewhere between ionic and covalent.Pauling’s new theory revolutionized the field, combining quantum physics withchemistry. His concept was so revolutionary that when the journal editorreceived the manuscript, he couldn’t locate an appropriate group of referees toreview the paper. When Einstein was asked to review the paper, he threw up hisarms and exclaimed, “It was too complicated for me.” For this single paper,Pauling received the Langmuir Prize as the most outstanding young chemist inAmerica, He became the youngest individual elected to the National Academy ofSciences, was made a full professor at Caltech, and won the Nobel Prize inChemistry when he was thirty years of age.In 1933 Pauling was elected the youngest member of the National Academy ofSciences.In 1934 Pauling applied for and received a three-year grant from the RockefellerFoundation to support research on the structure of hemoglobin and otherbiologically important substances.In 1935 Pauling and E. Bright Wilson, Jr. published Introduction to QuantumMechanics, with Applications to Chemistry, a popular textbook for introducingchemists and physicists to the new field of quantum mechanics.In 1939 The Nature of the Chemical Bond, and the Structure of Molecules andCrystals was published. This book, Pauling’s greatest, became, by the end of thecentury, “the most cited book in the scientific literature.”In 1945 Pauling learned about sickle-cell anemia from Dr. William Castle, andtheorizes that red blood cell sickling can be explained by abnormal hemoglobin.In 1947 Pauling published General Chemistry, a textbook that is an immediatesuccess and revolutionizes the teaching of college chemistry.In 1948 Harvey A. Itano, one of Pauling’s PhD students, was able to prove thatthere was a slight electrophoretic difference between normal and sickle-cellanemia hemoglobin. Pauling’s group felt that people suffering from “sicklemia,”a milder form of the disease, was made up of a mixture of normal andpathological hemoglobin, in approximately equal amounts. They theorized that“sicklemia” was a heterozygous manifestation and sickle-cell anemia was thehomozygous manifestation of the disease.Based on their accumulated data on the molecular manifestation of sickle-cellanemia, Pauling and Itano proposed several treatments to prevent sickling. Aftertwo years of clinical trials, the results turned out to be a failure and werenever published. Unfortunately, this would not be the last of such failures.According to Pauling, “Even today, our extremely detailed understanding of themolecular etiology of sickle-cell anemia has led to new diagnosticpossibilities, but little in the way of significant improvements in therapy.”In November of 1949 an article was published in the journal Science, which wouldover time play a fundamental role in the establishment of molecular biology andmolecular medicine. Linus Pauling and his associates published a paper with theunusual title “Sickle-cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease,” showing that thehemoglobin molecules of patients afflicted with this deadly “hereditary”affliction had a different electrical charge than those of healthy patients. Thepaper had a dynamic impact on the biomedical community and the public at large,and it rapidly became a “citation classic.”Pauling’s paper was important and novel in two different ways. Number one, itdemonstrated for the very first time that the cause of a disease could be tracedto an altered molecular structure, raising hopes that all diseases mighteventually be explained in a similar fashion; secondly, since sickle-cell anemiawas “known to be heritable,” the paper argued that genes determined preciselythe structure of proteins. These two points have become dogma over the years, soit seems surprising that they were not always embraced.Pauling, along with chemist Walter A. Schroeder, performed chromatographicanalysis of normal and sickle-cell anemia hemoglobin and was surprised to findin 1950 that there was no difference in amino acid content, which could explainthe electrophoresis result, a conclusion that was confirmed by additionalresearchers.Pauling revamped his theory to propose that “the electrophoretic differenceresulted from a difference in folding of the polypeptide chain.” In 1954 hesummarized his new theory in a Harvey lecture where he stated that “the generesponsible for the sickle-cell abnormality is one that determines the nature ofthe folding of polypeptide chains, rather than their compositions.”In 1991 Wallach was contacted by Phil Oliver, the genetic councilor for theSickle-cell Foundation of Georgia. Oliver had read Wallach’s The Diseases ofExotic Animals and was shocked to read that Wallach could reverse sickle-cellanemia in white tail deer with a complete nutritional supplement program thatwas based on the 90 essential nutrients and emphasized the trace mineralselenium!Oliver asked Wallach if he thought the supplement that was successful in whitetail deer would also work in humans and Wallach quickly responded with aresounding—yes!Wallach flew to Atlanta, Georgia, and showed Oliver how to put the sickle-cellpatients on a gluten-free, anti-inflammation diet and to supplement this withthe 90 essential nutrients, with an emphasis on extra amounts of the tracemineral selenium. The disease was then able to be clinically controlled in thesmall study group of humans using the Wallach protocol.Oliver quickly formed a Sickle-cell Support Group (initially made up of 25people) to get the information about the new treatment to the victims ofsickle-cell anemia in Georgia. The universally successful results were verypopular and the word spread quickly.Those 25 members of the original support group who had obsessively followed agluten-free diet and faithfully employed the supplement program had no flare-upsor hospitalizations. At the very least we had proved that sickle-cell anemiacould be clinically managed in humans with a nutritional formula that hadeliminated the disease in white tail deer!As of 2013, Wallach’s gluten-free diet and 90 essential nutrient and seleniumprotocol for sickle-cell anemia is used internationally and continues to benefitall those who employ it.In 1951, on his fiftieth birthday, Pauling contributed his article “TheStructure of Proteins: Two Hydrogen-Bonded Helical Configurations of thePolypeptide Chain,” to the journal Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences (PNAS). Everyone knew that proteins were a chain of amino acids;however, Pauling suggested that proteins had a secondary structure that wasdictated by the folding pattern. He referred to one of these configurations asthe “alpha helix,” which was later referred to by James Watson and Francis Crickto explain the basic helical structure of DNA.In October 1954 Pauling learned that he has been awarded the Nobel Prize inchemistry for “his research into the nature of the chemical bond and itsapplication to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances.”In 1961 Pauling obtained blood from gorillas, chimpanzees, and monkeys from theSan Diego Zoo to answer the question, “Could mutations in hemoglobin be used asa kind of evolutionary clock.” Pauling then suggested that humans and gorillashad diverged from a common ancestor “about 11 million years ago.” A fellowchemist noted that, “At one stroke he (Pauling) united the fields ofpaleontology, evolutionary biology, and molecular biology.”On October 1963, on the day that the partial ban on nuclear testing went intoeffect, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee of the Norwegian Parliament announcesthe awarding of the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize to Linus Pauling. He was now only oneof two men who had received two unshared Nobel Prizes.In 1970 Pauling’s best-selling book, Vitamin C and the Common Cold, waspublished. The book would be awarded the Phi Beta Kappa Book Award in 1971 asone of the most distinguished and important works published in 1970. Paperbackeditions were published in 1971 and 1973, and a second edition, Vitamin C, theCommon Cold and the Flu published three years later suggested that vitamin Ccould fend off a swine flu pandemic. Sales of vitamin C quadrupled andpharmacies could not keep up with the demand. Fifty million Americans werelining up to follow Pauling’s vitamin C protocol. Vitamin manufacturers referredto this massive response as the “Linus Pauling effect.”In 1974 the Institute of Orthomolecular Medicine changed its name to the LinusPauling Institute of Science and Medicine.On August 19, 1994, Linus Pauling died at the age of 93 from complications ofprostate cancer at the Deer Flat Ranch, Big Sur, California."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENTHE DOUBLE HELIX: WATSON AND CRICKWe’ve discovered the secret of life.—Francis Crick, said on February 28, 1953Nobel Prize winner 1962Gene sequencing is not the solution.

Watson, March 25, 2013Nobel Prize winner 1962Salk Institute, San Diego, CaliforniaSeminar March 25, 2013There is no symbol of science more iconic than the double helix of DNA, the 1953identification and description of this structure by James Watson, an American,and Francis Crick, an Englishman from Cambridge University, was thought to bemonumental.On April 6, 1928, James D. Watson was born in Chicago, Illinois. He eventuallybecame a molecular biologist, geneticist, and zoologist who is best known forhis co-discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 with Francis Crick.He was the only son of Jean Mitchell and James D. Watson, a tax collector ofEnglish descent. His mother’s father, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was fromGlasgow, Scotland, and her mother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of Irishparents from the town of Tipperary, Ireland. Raised Catholic, he later describedhimself as “an escapee from the Catholic religion.” Watson said, “The luckiestthing that ever happened to me was that my father didn’t believe in God.”Watson attended public school and graduated ahead of his peers. He wasfascinated with bird watching, a hobby he shared with his father, so heconsidered a career in ornithology. Watson appeared on the radio show Quiz Kids,which was a show that challenged bright children with pointed questions. Becauseof the unique admission policies of the University of Chicago and universitypresident Robert Hutchins, Watson was accepted at age 15 as a full-time student.After reading Erwin Schrodinger’s book What Is Life in 1946, Watson changed hismajor and professional direction from ornithology to genetics. In 1947 Watsonearned his B.S. degree in Zoology from the University of Chicago and in hisautobiography Avoid Boring People, Watson described the University of Chicago asan “idyllic academic institution” where he was instilled with the skills forcritical thought and “an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded hissearch for truth.”In 1947 Watson left Chicago and entered graduate school at Indiana University tostudy under the 1946 Nobel Prize winner, Herman Joseph Muller, who, in landmarkpublications in 1922, 1929, and in the 1930s, formulated the basic properties ofthe heredity molecule that Schrodinger ultimately presented in his 1944 book.Watson, Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize inPhysiology/Medicine “for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure ofnucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material.”In 1950 Watson received his PhD degree from the University of Indiana with histhesis “The Biological Properties of X-Ray Inactivated Bacteriophage.”Following studies at the University of Chicago and Indiana University, he workedat the University of Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he firstmet his future collaborator and friend Francis Crick.In 1956 Watson was appointed a junior member of Harvard University’s BiologicalLaboratories with the responsibility to promote research in molecular biology;he held the post until 1976.Between 1988 and 1992 Watson was associated with the National Institutes ofHealth, and during this period he contributed to the establishment of the HumanGenome Project.Watson has written numerous books, including the textbook, The Molecular Biologyof the Gene (1965) and his bestselling book, The Double Helix (1968), whichdocumented the events leading to the discovery of the DNA structure (it wasedited by Gann and Witkowski and reissued in a new edition in 2012: TheAnnotated and Illustrated Double Helix).In 1968 Watson became the director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL)on Long Island, New York, where he expanded its level of funding and research.At CSHL, he redirected the facility’s research emphasis to the study of cancer.In 1994 he was appointed to the post of president and served in that capacityfor ten years, when he was then appointed to the post of chancellor, in whichcapacity he served until 2007.In his memoir, Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, Watsonreferred to his academic colleagues as “dinosaurs,” “deadbeats,” “fossils,”“has-beens,” “mediocre,” and “vapid.” Steve Shapin in Harvard Magazine notedthat Watson had written an unlikely Book of Manners, noting the skills necessaryat different times in a scientist’s career; he wrote that Watson was known foraggressively pursuing his own goals at the university. E.O. Wilson oncedescribed Watson as “the most unpleasant human being I had ever met,” but in alater TV interview, said that “he considered them to be friends, and theirrivalry at Harvard was old history.”In early October 2007 Watson was about to begin on a UK book tour to promote thememoir. He was interviewed by Charlotte Hunt-Grubbe at CSHL for the Sunday TimesMagazine to highlight the beginning of his tour.During the interview Hunt-Grubbe broached the subject of race and intelligenceand Watson replied that he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa,because all of our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligenceis the same as ours—whereas all the testing says ‘not really,’ and I know thatthis ‘hot potato’ is going to be difficult to address.” He said his hope wasthat everyone is equal, but he countered this by saying that “people who have todeal with black employees find this not true.” He said that you should notdiscriminate on the basis of color, because “there are many people of color whoare very talented, but don’t promote them when they haven’t succeeded at thelower levels.”Because of the public controversy, on October 18, 2007, the Board of Trusties atCSHL suspended Watson’s administrative duties. On October19th Watson released anapology and on October 25th, Watson resigned his position as chancellor. In 2008Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL. In a 2008 BBC documentary,Watson stated, “I have never thought of myself as a racist. I am mortified byit. It (the interview) was the worst thing in my life.”DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid is the material that contains the geneticinstructions or blueprints (scripts) for all living organisms: humans, horse,fruit fly, bacteria, corn, oak tree, etc.Prior to Watson and Crick, the existence of DNA was known, but some geneticexperts were highly skeptical that it contained genetic material. What was leftto be done was to find out what the DNA structure actually looked like.Watson and Crick created DNA models out of sticks and balls, not unlike Tinkertoys. They originally operated under the incorrect belief that DNA was a triplehelix.While Watson and Crick have been credited with the elucidation of the structureof DNA, it is a fact that they built their understanding of the DNA structure onthe work of others, including Linus Pauling (recipient of two unshared NobelPrizes), who theorized that DNA was a triple helix, and British biophysicistRosalind Franklin, who in 1952 used a painstaking technique referred to as x-raydiffraction to make a famous three dimensional image of DNA.Photographs produced by the X-ray crystallography method are not actuallypictures of molecules. The spots and smudges were produced by X-rays that werediffracted as they passed through crystalized DNA. Crystallographers usemathematical equations to translate the resultant patterns from the spots totranslate the patterns to the three dimensional shapes of the molecule.Watson and Crick based their double helix model of DNA on data that they wereable to extract from Franklin’s X-ray diffraction photo. They interpreted thepattern of spots on the X-ray photograph to mean that DNA was helical in shape.Based on Watson’s recollection of the photograph, he and Crick deduced that thehelix had a uniform width of 2 nanometers (nm), with its nitrogenous basesstacked 0.34 nm apart. The width of the helix suggested that it was made up oftwo strands, contrary to the three strands that Pauling had proposed.Using molecular models made of wire, Watson and Crick began building scalemodels of a double helix that would conform to the X-ray measurements and whatwas then known about the chemistry of DNA. After failing to make a model thatplaced the sugar-phosphate chains on the inside of the molecule, Watson triedputting them on the outside and forcing the nitrogenous bases to swivel to theinterior of the double helix.Imagine this double helix as a rope ladder having rigid rungs, with the laddertwisted into a spiral. The side ropes are the equivalent of the sugar-phosphatebackbones, and the rungs represent pairs of nitrogenous basses. Franklin’s X-raydata indicated that the helix made one full turn every 3.4 nm along its length.Because the bases were stacked just 0.34 nm apart, there were ten layers of basepairs, or rungs on the ladder, in each turn of the helix. This configurationmade sense because it put the relatively hydrophobic nitrogenous bases in themolecule’s interior and away from the surrounding aqueous medium.The nitrogenous bases of the double helix are paired in specific combinations:adenine (A) with thymine (T), and guanine (G) with cytosine (C). It wasprimarily by trial and error that Watson and Crick arrived at this key featureof DNA. At first, Watson theorized that the bases paired like-with-like; forexample, A with A and C with C. However, the model did not match with the X-raydiffraction data, which showed that the double helix had a uniform diameter.Adenine and guanine are purines, nitrogenous bases with two organic rings. Incontrast, cytosine and thymine belong to the family of nitrogenous bases knownas pyrimidines, which have a single ring, making the purines A and Gapproximately twice as wide as the pyrimidines C and T. A purine-purine pairwould be too wide and a pyrimidine-pyrimidine pair would be too narrow tojustify the 2 nm diameter of the double helix. The solution was to always pair apurine with a pyrimidine.Watson and Crick reasoned that there must be additional specificity of pairingdictated by the structure of the bases. Each base has chemical side groups thatcan form hydrogen bonds with its appropriate counterpart: adenine can form twohydrogen bonds with thymine and only thymine; guanine forms three hydrogen bondswith cytosine and only cytosine. By default A can only pair with T, and G canonly pair with C.The Watson-Crick double helix model fully explained Chargaff’s rules: Chargafffound a peculiar regularity in the ratios of nucleotide bases. In the DNA ofeach species he studied, the number of adenines approximately equaled the numberof thymines, and the number of guanines equaled the number of cytosines. Inhuman DNA, the four bases are present in the following percentages – A = 30.9%and T = 29.4%; G = 19.9% and C = 19.8%. The A = T and the G = C equalities,later referred to as Chargaff’s rules, was unexplained until the proposal of thedouble helix.Wherever one strand of a DNA molecule has an A, the partner strand has a T; anda G in one strand is always paired with a C in the complementary strand.Therefore, in the DNA of any organism, the amount of adenine equals the amountof thymine, and the amount of guanine equals the amount of cytosine. Althoughthe base-pairing rules dictate the combinations of nitrogenous bases that formthe “rungs” of the double helix, they do not restrict the sequence of thenucleotides along each DNA strand. Therefore, the linear sequence of the fourbases can be varied in countless forms, and each gene has a unique basesequence.Franklin was the X-ray crystallographer that actually took the photograph thatenabled Watson and Crick to deduce the double helical structure of DNA. Franklindied of cancer when she was 38 years of age. Her colleague, Maurice Wilkins, wasa co-recipient of the 1962 Nobel Prize along with Watson and Crick forco-discovering the double helical structure of DNA in April 1953. Franklin wasnot included in the award because the Nobel Committee does not award the prizeposthumously.In April 1953 Watson and Crick shocked the scientific community with an articlethat was given a one page announcement in the British journal Nature (seeWatson, J.D. and Crick, F.H.C.: “Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: AStructure for Deoxynucleic Acids.” Nature.171(1953), p.738.). The paper reportedtheir molecular model for DNA: the double helix, which has since become thesymbol of molecular biology. The value of the Watson and Crick model was thatits structure posited the basic mechanism of DNA replication. They ended theirlandmark paper with the following paragraph: “It has not escaped our notice thatthe specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copyingmechanism for the genetic material.”We now know that in humans the double helix in the nuclei of each cell and thateach somatic (body) cell contains 46 pairs of chromosomes and that the sperm andthe egg each has 23 pairs (one pair maternal and the other paternal). The DNAmolecule contains the information that determines what each individual lookslike (e.g., blue eyes, blond hair, black skin, gender, etc.) and directscellular functions including enzymatic, respiration, repair, and reproduction.It has been calculated that if the 46 segments of DNA in one cell were to beuncoiled, connected end to end, and laid out flat it would be approximatelyseven feet long. The resulting ribbon would be so thin that its details couldnot be visualized except perhaps by an electron microscope. Calculations thenreveal that if the sum total of an individual’s DNA were placed end to end itwould stretch from the earth to the moon 500,000 times. Another way to grasp theimmensity of information stored in one individual’s DNA would be to create atype-written format that would completely fill the entire Grand Canyon 50 times.It is estimated that the human body is made up of 50 to 70 trillion cells. Cellsare the basic building blocks or bricks that are found in a wide range oftissues, such as the liver, brain, cartilage, skin, kidney, heart, thyroid,gonads, etc.In the perfect world, the normal genetic controls keep the various cell types,their anatomy, their physiology, and their directed functions on the rails.Unless a stick is put into the spokes, peoples’ liver is not found in theirskull and they will have two eyes appropriately located.It’s quite remarkable when you think about it, because all of the tissues ofplants and animals start with two cells: the sperm and the egg. When the egg ispierced by the sperm and is “fertilized” the new organism becomes a zygote.The zygote divides and produces a daughter cell, and they each divide, and thenthere are four, and this is repeated again and again. What makes the process soremarkable is that after a short period of time—minutes in fruit flies, hours inchicken eggs, and days in humans—the cells begin to differentiate andspecialize, form different tissues and organs, and all from the single zygotecell!The British Liver Trust points out that the liver brags of over 500 functions,including managing food that has been digested and absorbed from thegastrointestinal tract, disarms toxins, produces bile to support absorption oflipids and fat soluble vitamins, and 497 other tasks.Hemoglobin carries oxygen throughout the vascular system; kidneys filter theblood and produce urine; the brain and spinal cord stores memory and interpretlight and images, tastes and smells, and drive motor functions; the lens in theeye focuses light on the retina; and muscles move the entire body; —all from onecomplete zygote.The initial mistake was that geneticists believed that the “genetic code” was ablueprint, like the blueprint of a building, and it didn’t matter if theconstruction company was American, Chinese, Irish, Mexican, or South Africanbecause the resulting building would be exactly alike, since it used the sameraw materials and the same blueprint, and as a result would be invariably thesame building.Well, it turns out that the gene and the genetic code is not a blueprint, but isinstead a “script” that is easily modified, interpreted, or differentiated byactors, directors, and producers. So this is epigenetics rather than genetics!The DNA is the script, the basic information—the code. Nessa Carey posits inchapter 3 “Life as We Knew It” in The Epigenetics Revolution:If DNA is a code, then it must contain symbols that can be read. It must actlike a language. This is exactly what the DNA code does. It might seem odd whenwe think how complicated we humans are, but our DNA is a language with only fourletters. These letters are known as bases, and their full names are adenine,cytosine, guanine, and thymine. They are abbreviated to A, C, G, and T. One ofthe easiest ways to visualize DNA mentally is as a Zip(per).One of the most obvious things that we know about a zip(per) is that it isformed of two strips facing each other: this also true of DNA. The four bases ofDNA are the teeth of the zip(per). The bases on each side of the zip(per) canlink up to each other chemically and hold the zip(per) together. The two basesfacing each other and joined up like this are known as a base-pair. The fabricstrips that the teeth are stitched on to on a zip(per) are the DNA back bones.There are always two backbones facing each other, like two sides of thezip(per), and DNA is therefore referred to as double-stranded. The two sides ofthe zip(per) are basically twisted around to form a spiral structure—the famousdouble helix.On March 25, 2013, James Watson gave a lecture to an invitation-only academicgathering at the Salk Institute in San Diego, California, almost sixty yearsafter the announcement that he and Francis Crick had identified and mapped outthe double helix structure of DNA.Watson’s lecture was a far cry from the heady days of 1953 when he and Crickbelieved they had identified the very “secret to life itself.” With obviousdisappointment, Watson declared that “gene sequencing is not the answer tosolving the problems of human health, and much of the research currently beingconducted is irrelevant!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEMAPPING THE GENOMEWe now have the possibility of achieving all we ever hoped for from medicine.—UK Science Minister Lord SainsburyJune 26, 2000On the day of the completion of themapping of the human genomeThe earth is not flat, pellagra is not caused by a germ, and the sun does notrevolve around the earth! Unfortunately science advances one funeral at a time.Protectors of a particular scientific belief or theory (particularly viciousregarding medical theories) will go to the extremes of blackballing, such as wasthe case with reactions to the theories of the etiology of cystic fibrosis(Wallach) and the practice of eugenics (Galton), and when there were executionsfor practitioners of sorcery (Joan of Arc). There have been uncountable murdersand wars to thwart competing information, theories, and truths.When “the” existing “truth” is dethroned, the champions of “the new truth”become the ruthless defenders of “the” new “truth,” thus creating a death-watchfor the next funeral for new champions to advance science.Perhaps one of the most clear thinking epigeneticists is Nessa Carey, a PhDvirologist who was trained at the University of Edinburgh and was a seniorlecturer at Imperial College in London. In her book The Epigenetics Revolution:How Modern Biology Is Rewriting Our Understanding of Genetics, Disease, andInheritance, she points out that even experts in the genome projects have beenfrustrated with the lack of usefulness of what they have mapped out.The genomes of more than 180 species have been sequenced since 1995. Genomesequencing reads and records the order of DNA nucleotides in a genome: thepattern of the base pairs A-C and G-T that comprise an individual’s DNA. The1977 genome sequencing project of Frederick Sanger, the great modern geneticist,drove the creation of the Human Genome Project by developing techniques of aminoacid sequencing.Sangers’s work that identified the amino acid sequencing of insulin in 1951 gavepeople the false hope that diseases thought to be genetically transmitted couldbe prevented and cured through “genetic engineering.”The Sanger’s sequencing technique involves separating fluorescent-labeled DNAfragments based on the length of a polyacrylamide gel. The base at the end ofeach fragment is identified by how it responds to a specific dye.Sanger used his technique to sequence the DNA of the bacteriophage fx174, aviral genome with 5,368 base pairs. He discovered that there was overlap amongthe genes in some areas with respect to coding, a finding that enabledgeneticists to analyze longer strands of DNA more rapidly and with greateraccuracy than earlier efforts. For his work, in 1980 Sanger was awarded hissecond Nobel Prize in chemistry, which he shared with Walter Gilbert and PaulBerg. Sanger had won his first Nobel Prize in 1958 for his work in identifyingthe structure of proteins.The purpose of all of this genetic research was to provide the tools necessaryto correct diseases thought to be genetically transmitted. The process toproduce these genetic tools is referred to as “genetic engineering.”Genetic engineering, also referred to as genetic modification, involves directmanipulation of an organism’s genetic material. It employs recombinant DNA, inwhich two or more genetic sequences are combined in a way that would notcommonly occur in nature.The Origin of genetic engineering is based on the work of American biochemistsHerbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen, who developed the technique of DNA cloning.The first genetically engineered organisms were bacteria (1973) and mice (1974).More recently, biologists have used genetic engineering principals in research,biotechnology, medicine, and other fields.The process involves collecting the appropriate DNA material and copying it toensure that the genes will express themselves and the desired genetic materialis placed into a host genome.The Human Genome Project (HGP) began in 1990 under the leadership of JamesWatson, the American molecular biologist, who had along with Francis Crick wonthe Nobel Prize in 1962 for elucidating the structure of the DNA double helix,and later under the leadership of an American physician-geneticist FrancisCollins.The HGP is the international effort assembled to determine the genetic sequenceof the approximately three billion base pairs in human DNA and to understand thefunctions of its 20,000 genes.Genes are the units of heredity and are found as actual physical structures thatare found on stretches of DNA and function by producing or replicating proteinsor an RNA molecule that has a specific enzymatic or structural function.To accelerate the identification of the human genetic sequence, the computeraugmented genome was broken up into smaller fragments to be worked on bydifferent investigators. These small fragments were inserted into bacteria whichwould then reproduce them for a standard source and unlimited supply or“library” of these cloned DNA fragments. The next step was to assemble theresulting fragments into the complete whole DNA strands.The biggest revelation was that except for identical twins, each human genomediffers—Houston, we have a problem! The HGP participants had incorrectlyanticipated that there would be a “one genome fits all” result of their study.The idea was that if someone had defective DNA, they could come to the lab andget a DNA transplant much in the same way that one can receive a heart, liver,kidney, or bone marrow transplant.Again, totally unexpected results were that less than one percent of the humangenome’s DNA codes for protein reproduction. The number of genes in humans isnow known to fall somewhere in between the number of genes found in grapes(30,400) and the number of genes found in chickens (16,700). And almost half ofthe human genome is comprised of interchangeable DNA fragments that move around,on and in between chromosomes.Collins (the physician) reported in 2001 that the HGP had assembled the majorityof the human genome map: “It’s a history book: a narrative of the journey of ourspecies through time. It’s a shop manual: an incredibly detailed blueprint forbuilding every human cell. And it’s a transformative textbook of medicine withinsights that will give health-care providers immense new powers to treat,prevent, and cure disease.”A more complete genome sequence that was announced in 2003 is considered byphysicians and the genetic industry, “to be a watershed moment in the history ofcivilization.”In November 2012 a report from the $120 million 1000 Genomes Project announcedthat the complete mapping of the DNA material from more than 1,000 humans from14 population groups in Europe, Africa, East Asia, and the Americas had beenachieved. The project involved 700 scientists from laboratories in the UnitedStates, Canada, China, Japan, Nigeria, and Kenya.The report identified 38 million variations in the chemical letters of DNA thatmake up each of the average person’s 23,000 plus genes and the DNA regions thatcontrol them—an estimated 98% of all the human variations in the world. Thisimmense catalogue of the human genetic code is equal to 16 million file cabinetsor 30,000 DVDs.In general, all humans share approximately 99% of the DNA code that controlsdevelopment, health, personality, and other traits. However, the common geneticvariations that most people share account for only a small percentage of therisk for diseases thought to be heritable.Genetic variation among people refers to the differences in the order ofchemical units (nucleotides), identified by the acronyms A, G, C, and T, whichwould be the equivalent of the three billion letters of the DNA in the humangenome.“The biggest question is trying to figure out how much of this variation ismeaningful,” said Dr. Aravinda Chakravarti, an expert in disease genomics atJohns Hopkins University in Baltimore who is part of the genomic project, “muchof it may make very little difference.”The report also shows that there are differences in people in various parts ofthe world or even different cities. “The stuff that is rare—present in one of100 people—in the United Kingdom is different from the stuff at that frequencyin Holland or Italy,” said Dr. Gilean McVean at Oxford University in England."},{"pageContent":"PART4The Age of Biochemistry, Nutrition, and Epigenetics"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENEPIGENETICSFacts are facts—however, truths change as new facts appear.—Robert LeakyWashington University Speech in 1967We talk about DNA as if it’s a template (or a blue print), like a mould for acar part in a factory. In the factory, molten metal or plastic gets poured intothe mould thousands of times and, unless something goes wrong in the process,out pop thousands of identical car parts.But DNA isn’t really like that. It’s more like a script. Think of Romeo andJuliet, for example. In 1936 George Cukor directed Leslie Howard and NormaShearer in a film version. Sixty years later Baz Luhrmann directed LeonardoDiCaprio and Claire Danes in another movie version of this play. Bothproductions used Shakespeare’s script, yet the two movies are entirelydifferent. Identical starting points, different outcomes.That’s what happens when cells read the genetic code that’s in DNA (that isnutritionally deficient). The same script can result in different productions.The implications of this for human health are very wide-ranging, as we will seefrom the case studies it’s really important to remember that nothing happened tothe DNA blueprint of the people in these case studies. Their DNA didn’t change(or mutate), and yet their life histories altered irrevocably in response totheir environment (i.e., diet and nutritional deficiencies).—Nessa CareyThe Epigenetics Revolution (2012)Just as a pianist interprets the notes of a musical score, controlling thevolume and tempo, epigenetics affects the interpretation of DNA geneticsequences in cells. Epigenetics usually refers to the study of ‘heritabletraits’ (caused by nutritional deficiencies), that do not involve changes to theunderlying DNA sequence of the cells.—Clifford A. PickoverThe Medical Book (2012)Geologists believe that some “two hundred and fifty million years ago” theworld’s land mass was a single “continent” known as Pangaea and that unknownforces divided Pangaea into two land masses: Eurasia/Africa and the Americas.While there was some overlap, the two separate hemispheres (eastern and western)developed vastly different populations of animal and plant species.Food sources—quantity and nutritional quality—were and continue to be thelimiting factors in human health, longevity, and population growth and density.Historically, when one excludes cataclysmic ecological disasters and microbialplagues and epidemics, simple starvation inflicted the most damage to humanpopulations.In 1968 Wallach, while at the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems,designed a simple experiment that would demonstrate how “genetic potential” canbe affected by the environment and nutrition. Thus we have the field ofepigenetics. Wallach randomly selected 100 identical ducklings with the samemother and father (one keeps stealing eggs from the nest and refrigerating themuntil you collect 100, then all 100 are incubated at the same time) and theywere divided into four groups of twenty-five each and each group was fed adifferent diet: 1. Lettuce only 2. Hydroponically grown barley grass only 3. Purina duck grower pellets only 4. Purina duck grower pellets and barely grassAfter one month, the results were dramatic. Groups 1 and 2 showed identicalgrowth and development rates (almost zero); group 3 ducks were three timeslarger in height and weight than groups 1 and 2; and group 4 was twice as largeas group three and six times larger than groups 1 and 2.Only groups 3 and 4 came close to fulfilling their genetic potential for growthand development at one month of age; only groups 3 and 4 were fed supplementedPurina duck grower pellets that contained all of the known nutrients required byducklings.A human parallel to the duck experiment is the Japanes immigrants, whooriginally came to the United States as small wiry people about four foot eleveninches tall and weighing 100 pounds soaking wet. Their genetic potential forgrowth and development was never achieved by eating the low calorie, lownutrient Japanese rice, vegetable and fish diet of their native Japan. Thesecond generation Japanese, conceived and born in the United States, were adifferent story. The number-one son over the next generation was six feet fourinches tall, weighed 240 pounds and played tight end for the USC football team.Their genetic background was the same, however, their potential for height andphysical development was more completely fulfilled by having access to unlimitedcalories, meat, protein, milk, eggs, vegetables, and vitamin and mineralsupplements.After 1492 and the transoceanic visit to Hispaniola by Columbus, who accordingto historian Alfred W. Crosby, “reknit the seams of Pangaea” and literallythousands of insect, animal, and plant species were transported east and westacross the world.Crosby dubbed these mass ecological migrations the “Columbian Exchange.” UponColumbus’s second voyage west to Hispaniola, his fleet of seventeen ships and acombined crew of fifteen hundred men brought with them stowaways of manyspecies. According to Charles Mann, author of 1493:They were accompanied by a menagerie of insects, plants, mammals andmicro-organisms. Beginning with La Isabela, European expeditions brought cattle,sheep, and horses along with crops like sugar cane (originally from New Guinea),wheat (from the Middle East), bananas (from Africa), and coffee (also fromAfrica). Equally important, creatures that the colonist knew nothing abouthitchhiked along for the ride. Earthworms, mosquitoes, and cockroaches honeybees, dandelions, and African grasses; rats of every description—all of thempoured from the hulls of Colon’s vessels and those that followed, rushing likeeager tourists into lands they had never seen before.John Rolfe was the man (aka: John Smith) who married Pocahontas, the “Indianprincess.” He was also the man behind the survival and success of Jamestown,Virginia, and he was also the man who systematically brought earthworms to theAmericas as a hitchhiker on the root balls of tobacco and English soil that wasused as ballast on the ship’s return voyages.Charles Darwin was apparently the first to recognize the great event that hadtaken place when earthworms came to the Americas. Darwin wrote athree-hundred-page book on the ecological and agricultural value of theearthworm. Darwin wrote, “It may be doubted whether there are many other animalswhich have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have theselowly organized creatures.”The Columbian Exchange produced such dynamic ecological effects that manybiologists believe that Columbus’s voyages denoted the beginning of a newbiological era: the “Homogenocene”—places that had been isolated andecologically unique have become the same.The Ecuadorean people can be traced back to the late 15th century, whenEuropeans fled from the Iberian Peninsula to the New World. These peoples, theSephardic Jews, were desperate to leave Spain and Portugal because of thehorrors of the Inquisition. They fled to North Africa, the Middle East, southernEurope, and the New World; however, the Inquisition followed them. It was intheir interest to stay away from the larger cities such as Lima and Quito wherethe Catholic Church had its strongest influence. They settled in small villagesand towns, where even up until the 1980s there were few roads, no phones, and noelectricity, and where wood was the common fuel.When Columbus first arrived in Hispaniola, the numbers of the local Indianinhabitants (the Taino) numbered by estimation from 60,000 to more than eightmillion. In 1514 their numbers were reduced to 26,000, and by 1548 there wereless than 500 alive. European microbial plagues and epidemics had wiped outseventy-five percent of the entire native population of the western hemisphere.This is an example of Darwin’s survival of the fittest!Survivors starved and entire cultures disappeared or fell into ruin—a repeat ofwhat had happened to Europe during the Dark Ages. Only small enclaves of peoplesflourished, and their survival was the result of food—lots of high quality food.In the Americas the main indigenous food source was the potato: the tuber thathad originated in the Andes was now contributing to what would be called theAgro-Industrial Complex worldwide. The potato became the fifth most importantfood crop worldwide, only behind sugar cane, wheat, corn, and rice.William H. McNeill, a highly respected historian, makes the point that it isuniversally believed by scholars that “the introduction of the potato to Europewas a key moment in history.” The widespread use of the potato as a caloriesource in northern Europe is credited with ending centuries of famine among thepeasants. Additionally, McNeill also stated that the potato (S. tuberosum) ledto empire: “Potatoes, by feeding rapidly growing populations, permitted ahandful of European nations to take advantage of American silver—the potatofueled the rise of the West.”The American and European adoption of the potato set the stage for modernagriculture and the Agro-Industrial Complex. This food empire is supported bythree legs: (1) improved crops including the potato, (2) high intensityfertilizer, and (3) pesticides. All three came into play with the ColumbianExchange and the potato.The potato came from the Andes and the fertilizer to grow them came from theChincha Islands, a three very small islands made mostly of granite, positionedthirteen miles west off of the Peruvian shore, about five hundred miles south ofLima. The Chincha Islands have less than an inch of rainfall per year andtherefore are the most productive of the 147 Peruvian “guano islands” as far asaccumulation of deposits of bird guano, the excrement vauled and sold asfertilizer.The Chincha islands only other claim to fame is that they are the home of threespecies of large sea birds: the Peruvian booby, the Peruvian cormorant, and thePeruvian pelican. The birds are drawn to the islands by the strong cold coastalcurrents. Phytoplankton bloom because of the heavy nutrient levels in thecoastal water; zooplankton consume the phytoplankton that are then eaten by thesmall anchoveta fish.Anchoveta travel in large schools that are magnets to larger predatory fish,which are then in turn hunted down, scooped up, and eaten by the booby,cormorant, and pelicans. These large predatory birds have lived and reared theiryoung on the Chincha Islands for thousands of years.Avian urine is excreted as a paste, in a consistency not unlike tooth-paste, andas a result guano can build up rapidly in an arid environment. Over thecenturies the birds have covered the islands with layer after layer offoul-smelling guano that adds up to be one hundred and fifty feet of their thickurine!According to The Biochemistry of Vertebrate Excretion, a classic reference bookby G. Evelyn Hutchinson, an adult cormorant’s annual production of thepaste-like urine is approximately thirty-five pounds; thus the combined annualurine production of the cormorant colony would approximately be thousands oftons per year!Guano is an ideal fertilizer. A good fertilizer does several things: it providesorganic material which feeds soil organisms, it provides nitrogen that drivesplant growth, and it provides minerals necessary for plant metabolism andnutrition for the consumer of the harvest.Plants specifically need nitrogen and magnesium to produce chlorophyll, which isthe green pigment in plant leaves that convert sunlight and CO2 into energy(photosynthesis), to make the carbon chains and amino acids necessary for theproduction of DNA and protein.The first European to grasp the potential value of guano for the Agro-Industrial Complex was Friedrich Wilhelm Alexander von Humboldt, a Germanpioneer in botany, geography, astronomy, geology, and anthropology—a truepolymath.Included in the thousands of samples Humboldt took back to Germany in 1804 wereseveral small bags of Peruvian Guano, which he shared with two French chemists.Their analysis showed that the guano nitrogen levels ranged from eleven toseventeen percent nitrogen which could effectively be used as a fertilizer.During that period in history, the most commonly applied fertilizer includedbone meal and wood ashes that contained plant minerals. Wood ashes were takenfrom the wood stoves and applied to gardens and small fields. Shipping wood ashto Europe from the eastern American shore became an enormous business. Entireforests had been burned in Europe for fuel and now entire forests along theeastern seaboard of North America were being burned commercially to supplymineral fertilizer to Europe. Wood ash was such an important export product thatefficient methods of burning wood and collecting the resultant by-product ofplant minerals (contained in wood ash) became U.S. Patent Number 1.Bone meal was manufactured by pulverizing or grinding slaughter-house bones.Driven by concern over the looming probability of soil depletion that could becaused by intensive potato growing operations, bone suppliers brought in bonesfrom the battlefields of Waterloo and Austerlitz. “It is now ascertained beyonda doubt, by actual experiment upon an extensive scale, that a dead soldier is amost valuable article of commerce,” remarked the London Observer in1822. Thenewspaper further noted that there was reason to believe that grave robbers werelimiting their source of human bones for fertilizer to battle fields. “For aughtknown to the contrary, the good farmers of Yorkshire are, in a great measure,indebted to the bones of their children for their daily bread.”The story of epigenetics is the story of nutrition and nutritional deficiency atthe enzyme, chromosomal, and gene level, and how they affect the duplication andtransmission of DNA.The ancient Egyptians cured night blindness in 1,000 BC by applying extracts ofbeef liver juice to the eyes and faces of the afflicted individual. We knowtoday that night blindness is caused by a deficiency of vitamin A and thatvitamin A is primarily stored in the liver of all species.Pellagra is considered a “new disease” in the civilized world, as it was unknownin Europe until Christopher Columbus delivered the first corn seeds from the“New World” to Europe. The European peasant looked upon corn as an easy toproduce miracle crop; it spread quickly as a food crop and the peasants becamedependent on corn.Corn was the beginning of the end for millions of people. Complete villages andtowns came down with a plague of skin disease (dermatitis), dementia, diarrhea,and death (the four Ds—pellagra had arrived.)Productivity faltered and a dullness settled over entire communities as a resultof peoples affliction with a vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency.Over the next centuries many good observers connected either a deficient ortoxic diet with pellagra; however, physicians and community leaders rejected theidea. Theophile Roussel, a French physician, demonstrated that pellagra wasrelated to the poor peasants and the regular consumption of corn, and finally in1848 he convinced the French government to stop encouraging the planting andconsumption of corn. Pellagra just about disappeared from France, but thedependence on corn and the continued “epidemic” of pellagra continued in Italyand Spain, especially when the economy was troubled and peasants were driven tocultivate and live almost entirely on corn.Corn in of itself is not poisonous. However, the little niacin that occursnaturally in corn is not easily used by humans and the resulting deficiency thatoccurs in a high-corn diet produces the skin disease (dermatitis), dementia, anddiarrhea of classic pellagra.The Indians of the New World subsisted on a corn-based diet for centurieswithout ill effect because their diets also included beans, squash, chilies, andcoffee—common foods that are rich in niacin. In Mexico the Indian women soakedthe corn in lime water after they ground the grain for tortillas, which producedincreased availability of the small amounts of niacin naturally found in thecorn.Pellagra sufferers, including many poor white farmers and in the slaves in theold American South, consumed bowl after bowl of cornmeal mush. During good yearsother foods were often consumed, but they were not available in adequate levelsto prevent pellagra. The universal diet for slaves and poor whites was calledthe three– M diet: Meat (fat back), corn meal, and molasses, and, as predictableas gravity, it produced dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, and death. Pellagra hadcome to America.The pellagra plagues were rarely diagnosed properly. Pellagra was referred to asa “Negro disease” or “black tongue,” and it occurred most frequently duringdroughts and economic down turns. In 1928, 7,000 people in the American Southdied of pellagra. It was originally thought to be an infectious disease byphysicians, and they created a network of sanitariums known as “retardationcenters” to isolate those afflicted with pellagra in the same manner as thesystem of isolation that was common in tuberculosis sanitariums. Doctors were soconvinced that pellagra was “caused by a germ,” that despite overwhelmingevidence that pellagra was in fact a nutritional-deficiency disease theyinsisted on continuing to ask “Where is the germ?”The initial clue that pellagra could be caused by diet was revealed when CasimirFunk found that beriberi, another disabling and fatal disease characterized bydementia and congestive heart failure, could be cured by the supplementation of“vital amines,” which were substances that could be identified in food. Theanti-beriberi vitamin that Funk had identified was thiamine (vitamin B1). At thesame time, Funk identified other food compounds, including niacin (vitamin B3)from rice polishings (bran). But since it did not have any positive effect onthe illness of beriberi, he put niacin on the back burner.Another investigator, Carl Voegtlin, vigorously championed the theory thatpellagra was a deficiency disease and chastised those who dismissed the theorythat a deficient diet was the cause of pellagra.Eventually, Joseph Goldberger, an objective and determined individual, was sentto the Old American South to identify the cause of pellagra once and for all.Goldberger visited small southern communities and towns where grown men laiddull and depressed against buildings from the scourge of pellagra. Wide-eyed andcrying kids clawed and scratched at the painful and pruritic skin lesions thattypified pellagra.The wives and mothers of the pellagra sufferers, also debilitated by pellagra,suffered from hallucinations, dullness, and low energy, and they spent theirdays preparing corn pone, corn muffins, corn coffee, cornmeal mush, corn bread,and grits. Since they couldn’t work, corn was all they could afford.After visiting a publicly-funded orphanage, Goldberger was sure that pellagrahad a nutritional cause. The younger children wracked with pellagra werebedridden, covered with skin lesions, and depressed. The older children tendedto be normal and free of pellagra. They were able enough to work odd jobs andearn small amounts of money that they used to buy fruit, vegetables, and eggs toimprove their diets. By then Goldberger recognized that Voegtlin was correct:the cure for pellagra was simply a proper diet!To prove the diet connection, Goldberger provided milk, meat, and eggs for allof the children. Within days, children who just days earlier could notparticipate in any activities, were able to smile and get out of bed. The plagueof pellagra in the orphanage had ended.Goldberger had ended pellagra in the orphanage by providing a niacin-rich dietto the afflicted children. However, another government team released informationclaiming that a species of flies was spreading the pellagra “microbe” with itssting. Physicians and the general public, familiar with the “germ theory” ofdisease transmission, quickly accepted the microbe theory as the cause ofpellagra.Now highly motivated and energized to refute the microbe misinformation and getthe truth out to the 170,000 Americans suffering from pellagra, Goldbergerbrushed the red scales from the weakened legs of pellagra patients, blended themwith the foul-smelling secretions and mucus, and injected the slime into himselfand his family. He ate the awful concoction right in front of startledcolleagues. Goldberger and his family didn’t get sick, and the microbe theoryfor the cause of pellagra was dead.Goldberger then produced pellagra in prison volunteers in exchange for an earlyrelease. After this he reversed their disease with a diet rich in yeast, meat,and milk. Goldberger didn’t discover what was in the food that was necessary toprevent or cure pellagra, but he was able to prove that pellagra was notinfectious and that corn itself was not a poison.It wasn’t until 1937 that Conrad Elvehjem purified the anti-pellagravital-amine, that was one of the fractions (niacin is vitamin B3) previouslyisolated by Funk years earlier.Between the years of 1880 and 1883, more than 6,000 Japanese sailors died as aresult of the paralysis, dementia (Korsakoff’s syndrome), and cardiac arrest(enlarged heart/congestive heart failure) that typify beriberi. In 1886 onlythree Japanese sailors died, and in 1887 none died.There were no vaccines then, and no microbe was isolated. But since Beriberi wascaused by a dietary deficiency, by changing a diet to include sources ofthiamine (vitamin B1) the disease could be prevented and cured..Kanekiro Takaki, a Japanese naval surgeon, was able to prove that a dietprimarily made up of polished rice was the cause of the beriberi of the Japanesesailors. Those afflicted with beriberi typically walked with a swayingsheep-like gait and clinically exhibited a general paralysis and dementia, butthe well-fed officers on the same ship were less likely to be affected withberiberi.The Riuyo, a Japanese naval ship with a complement of 276 men, returned from anextended voyage in 1883 with 25 dead sailors and 144 other crew members strickenwith beriberi. In 1884 Takaki was able to convince the Japanese naval command toallow him to join the crew of a second ship going on an identical voyage. Takakibelieved that beriberi was caused by an “imbalance in the carbon and nitrogen inthe diet. He was incorrect about this explanation for the cause of beriberi,although he was on the correct path. It was caused by their diet!On the second ship, the standard diet of polished rice was replaced with theBritish naval diet consisting of oatmeal, vegetables, and condensed milk. Thisdietary change was treated with skepticism and resistance by the Japanese crewwho did not want to eat British style: “fourteen sailors scoffed at the“barbarous food” and lived on polished rice that they had smuggled aboard. Whenthe ship returned to port, only the fourteen who had smuggled the polished riceaboard had developed beriberi.The news of Takaki’s success in preventing beriberi with a change in diet fellon deaf ears in Europe. Takaki’s report was thought of as shallow and childishbecause his theory didn’t include germs.The Dutch colonists in the Dutch East Indies would have saved enormous amountsof money by not having to bury large numbers of work gangs and retraining newones who then had to labor with congestive heart failure and paralysis.Dutch troops fell ill from beriberi so rapidly after arrival in Indonesia thatthey couldn’t suppress native revolts in Northern Sumatra. Beriberi continued toplague the Dutch troops until Christian Eijkman was sent by the Dutch governmentto determine what bacteria was causing beriberi.Eijkman had no success in transmitting the disease to healthy chickens byinjecting them with “infectious blood.” He was close to throwing his hands upand going home. Just before he was ready to return home he looked out the windowand saw his entire flock of chickens weaving and reeling around the courtyardlike “drunken sailors”—they had developed beriberi!The question was: Why were they all sick? Six months later the entire flockrecovered. It turned out that six months earlier the chickens had been fed theexpensive polished rice by a lazy kitchen employee. When a supervisor correctedthe mistake by feeding the flock with the less expensive brown rice, beriberidisappeared. The waste, the rice bran, was the cure!Eijkman added to Takaki’s theory by stating that there was something in thepolished rice that caused beriberi. Eijkman’s theory was summarily dismissed bythe authorities who believed that polished rice was a kind gift to the hungrynatives, and his theory was also rejected by physicians who declared that“beriberi was caused by an infection from a bacterial germ.”The steam-driven rice mills that Westerners believed were civilizing the FarEast were actually causing the beriberi plague, but no one wanted to believe itcould be.After the Spanish American War, in a kindly effort to engender good will, theUnited States government introduced polished rice to the Philippine prisonsystem. Immediately, the number of beriberi cases skyrocketed. In 1900 therewere no prisoners afflicted with beriberi, but by January of 1902 there were 169cases, and by October of the same year there were 579 more cases. It seemed asthough nothing could stop the “outbreak” of beriberi, because 5,000 prisonerswere affected and many died within ten months of the first cases.Whole rice with the bran was reintroduced, and by February of the next year theberiberi scourge had ended. Eijkman’s successor, Gerrit Grijns, a Dutchphysician had come to the realization that there was some “protective substance”in the rice polishings (rice bran) that was essential to health.Another physician, W. L. Braddon, investigated different tribal groups in Malayaand found that those peoples who ate polished rice suffered from a high rate ofberiberi, while those that ate whole grain rice did not. Braddon blamed “toxins”in the rice for beriberi, so polished, white rice was accepted as the cause ofberiberi, but the toxin theory was incorrect.Ten years later, Jansen and Donath finally identified the beriberi protectivevital amine-thiamine (vitamin B1).Scurvy was another common, debilitating, and fatal scourge of sailors forthousands of years. It was accepted that a high percentage of sailors would dieeach voyage from scurvy. Within two to three months at sea their teeth wouldfall out, their gums would bleed, and they would fall overboard from a generalweakness or die from an internal hemorrhage.Over history, millions of townspeople, soldiers, sailors, and prisoners havedied from scurvy. Most of these deaths could have been prevented or cured.Unfortunately, as in the case of beriberi, the correct observations of the fewon the front lines of the disease were ignored, and in some cases werevigorously rejected by the “educated and powerful.”“Scurvy was responsible for more deaths at sea than storms, shipwreck, combat,and all other disease combined,” writes historian Stephen Brown. “Historianshave conservatively estimated that more than two million sailors perished fromscurvy during the Age of Sail—a time period that began with Columbus’s voyages .. . and ended with the development of steam power . . . on ships in themid-nineteenth century.”The story goes that a young British sailor, Zoe, had signed on for a sea voyagein London, and after three months at sea eating salted meat, beans, and biscuitshis gums began to bleed. He had developed a classic case of scurvy. The ship’scaptain set Zoe ashore on a small island and left him to his own devices.When he became very hungry, Zoe began to gorge himself with grass and sea weed.Within a few days he had the strength to get up and walk—and found he was cured!Another ship picked him up a few weeks later, and his tale of how the greengrass and sea weed had reversed his scurvy spread like wildfire.Most plants and animals (except for the guinea pig) can store vitamin C.However, humans are unable to store vitamin C and require a daily source of it.In 1564 a Dutch physician recommended a daily supply of oranges for sailors toprevent and cure scurvy. In 1639 John Woodall, an English physician, prescribedcitrus, including lemons and limes, for British sailors to prevent scurvy.In 1601 the English navigator Sir James Lancaster wrote that lemons helped toprevent scurvy.James Lind, a Scottish naval surgeon, finally eliminated scurvy in the Britishnavy after researching the legend of Zoe and his miraculous self-cure. In 1753,as he recorded in his A Treatise on Scurvy, Lind divided sailors with scurvyinto six separate groups. Each group was provided with different foods, and onlythe sailors who consumed lemons and oranges recovered rapidly and completely.Lind did not prescribe a specific treatment as a result of his study, so it tookanother forty-two years before the British navy adopted his recommendations.The British navy delayed another fifty years before officially supporting theconcept of providing citrus to sailors to prevent and cure scurvy.Finally, after two hundred years of controversy, citrus was recognized as theprevention and cure of scurvy at the end of the fifteenth century, but not intime for Vasco da Gama’s voyage around the Cape of Good Hope in 1497, in whichhe ended up having to bury at sea 100 of his 160 man crew who had died ofscurvy.Jacques Cartier’s crew suffered even more from ninety percent of them havingscurvy. Many were disabled by edematous legs blackened with subcutaneoushemorrhage. Local Indians rescued them by providing them with a vitaminC-rich-tea brewed from the bark of the white cedar.Even with the general success of fruit and vegetables in preventing and treatingscurvy, including the efforts of the great Captain Cook, whose crewman werelegendary for their good health (he required them under the threat of the lashto eat up to twenty pounds of onions each week), progress in the prevention ofscurvy lagged for lack of official support. There was a failure of physiciansuniversally agreeing that scurvy was a nutritional deficiency, as well asconfusion resulting from misdiagnosis of sailors who had scurvy, beriberi, andpellagra all at the same time.In 1795, a year after Lind’s death, two surgeons were successful in getting theBritish naval command to routinely provide lemons and limes to the ship’s crewto prevent and cure scurvy—thus the nickname “limey” for British sailors.Pure vitamin C was finally identified by a laboratory accident by AlbertSzent-Gyorgyi, who said, “Vitamins . . . will help us reduce human suffering toan extent which the most fantastic mind will fail to imagine.”Rickets was recognized as a disabling malady from medieval times through thesmog-choked skies of the Industrial Revolution and deep into the twentiethcentury. As rickets usually didn’t produce the death of a sufferer, few had thewill or interest to find the cause and cure. The general masses actually thoughtthat people with twisted spines, bowed legs, and enlarged joints were normal!In 2013 rickets reappeared in children in the industrialized world with areported increase of 400 percent between 1995 and 2011. This is a result offears of increased risk of skin cancer from skin exposure to the sun as well aswidespread use of sun screens, fear of cholesterol in egg yolks (a good sourceof vitamin D), and instructions from pediatricians to avoid supplementation ofvitamins and minerals to children because of overdose concerns. Again, ricketshas become the scurge of our children as a physician-caused disease.Children with rickets show the classical bowed legs, swollen wrists and swollenribs. In October of 2013, Dr. Sally Davies, Britain’s chief medical officerdescribed the return of rickets as “appalling.”To Wallach, the most interesting primate and human disease cases were the onesthat involved nutritional deficiencies. Despite his interest, the golden age ofcritical and detailed research projects for the essentiality of various mineralsin animal nutrition occurred between 1920 and 1978. Any remaining curiosityabout the role of mineral deficiencies in human pathology was dealt a cripplingblow by the discovery of penicillin in 1938, and a second body punch was thediscovery of cortisone in 1942.The coup de grace for interest in dietary mineral deficiencies came to the ranksof the medical community in the 1980s during the heady drive to find patentablegenetic-engineering techniques to treat everything from bowel gas to cancer.While the basic studies of nutrition have become the stepchild of 21st centuryscience, Wallach observed that “the unquestionable basic mineral needs of ourhuman flesh cry out for attention from the waiting rooms of physician’s offices,hospital wards, and morgues.”Obesity and being overweight are problems that are ubiquitous in America..Americans are the most obese nation in the world as of 2010. The American eatinghabit has changed from three square meals per day to nibbling 24/7—nibble,nibble, nibble all the way home! This behavior in horses is called “cribbing.”The same behavior in humans is referred to in humans as pica or the “munchies,”a seeking, a craving with a licking and chewing behavior that has its genesis inmineral deficiencies. No known vitamin, protein, or calorie deficiency initiatesthis pica behavior. Nor will supplementing the diet with vitamins or eatingsugar, carbohydrate, fat, or protein quench it!Cribbing is the name given to a particular form of pica in domestic animals. Anexample of cribbing in animals is when they chew or gnaw on a wooden feed box,fence, hitching post, or stall rail, gate or barn door. A good farmer knows thatwhen a horse cribs, the animal really has an obsessional craving for minerals.The farmer or rancher supplements an animal’s diet with minerals to: (1)preserve the animal’s health, (2) save the animal’s life, (3) save on veterinarybills, and (4) save having to rebuild the fence or barn, since amineral-deficient horse will literally eat the fence or barn looking forminerals!Essential minerals never occurred in a uniform blanket in an individual field orover the crust of the earth; they have always occurred in veins, much likechocolate in chocolate ripple ice cream. Whatever essential minerals may haveexisted in a particular area of the earth’s crust have been severely depletedthrough intensive modern agriculture. It should be no surprise then that themineral- deficient animal behaviors of cribbing will also appear inmineral-deficient humans as pica, the “munchies,” binge-eating, and cravings. Asa result of being an essentially mineral-deficient nation, American has becomethe number one obese nation in the world—“We’re number one!”“Salt appetite” or the “munchies” dominate the American scene and thesedeficiency symptoms are universally observed at dramatic levels in pregnantanimals and pregnant humans. All vertebrates will exhibit these symptoms whenthey become mineral deficient. This desperate state is a physician-causedplague. Dieters, athletes, vegetarians, vegans, meat eaters, embryos, fetuses,children, teen agers, young adults, adults, baby boomers, seniors, and thecentenarians are all mineral deficient and are universally exhibiting thesymptoms of pica, cribbing, and the “munchies” that used to be common only inexpectant mothers!From antiquity, the description of the cribbing and pica behaviors in humans hasbeen recorded in the written records of all societies. The universalpresentation of these behaviors were in relationship to pregnant women. TheHawaiian King Kamehameha’s mother, Queen Kekuiapoiwa, had cravings for eyeballs.Although she specifically demanded a chief’s eyes, she was given the salty eyesof sharks which she ate with ravenous abandon.The snack-food and fast-food industries are aware of this relationship betweenthe behaviors of pica, cribbing, cravings, the munchies, binge-eating,salt-hunger, and other behaviors demonstrating mineral deficiencies, and theyformulate and engineer their products so that “You just can’t eat one!”Unfortunately for humans, our bodies will temporarily interpret sugar (and sugarsubstitutes) and salt intake as a fulfillment of the cravings for essentialminerals. Historically, the consumption of salt to satisfy a pica behavior mayhave had some value because raw sea salt did oftentimes contain small amounts oftrace minerals and rare earths.Today, contrary to popular belief, salt is not intrinsically harmful as doctorswould have you believe. It does present the problem of allowing our bodies tofalsely perceive that we are getting sufficient minerals when we eat salt. Thisis the mineral equivalent of the “empty calorie diet” concept. Just as processedwhite flower and sugar calories satisfy hunger while providing no protein,essential fatty acids, or vitamins, our salt intake confuses the body intobelieving it is consuming adequate amounts of all essential minerals.Farmers and husbandrymen use the salt-hunger behavior to ensure the consumptionof trace minerals in livestock by incorporating trace minerals into theformulation of salt blocks containing a minimum of eighty-five percent sodiumchloride. Anything less than eighty-five percent sodium chloride would beignored by the animals, even if they were to have major mineral deficiencies.The salt-consuming animals never get high blood pressure or stroke, even thoughby design they will consume 0.5 percent of their diet as salt. For them,adequate salt intake obtained by licking “trace-mineral salt blocks” guaranteestheir proper mineral intake.Most physicians (even “alternative physicians” of all types) would have youbelieve that you need little or no salt. They must think that humans are dumberthan cows, for the first food item the successful husbandry man provides for hisanimals in a pasture is a trace-mineral salt block! At the same time, themulti-billion dollar a year snack food industry is well aware of the humanrequirement for salt (NaCl) and other elements and minerals. Even the USDAreports that ninety-five percent of all Americans of all age groups areminerally deficient.In July of 1993 thousands of Americans, particularly people in the upper Midwestand on the East coast, were swooning and fainting during a sweltering heat wavethat soared above 110 degrees F. Seven hundred thirty-three Americans, in fact,died during the heat wave. The effects of the heat wave on the Americanpopulation were so dramatic that the daily body count was published everymorning in the local and national newspapers as though they were fallen Americansoldiers who had been killed in a far-off place defending American interests.Seemingly, no one knew what to do!The state medical examiner of Pennsylvania said, “We don’t know why so many havebeen affected by the heat—half of the dead and hospitalized were people who hadair conditioners.” That statement was especially odd when one thinks of themillions of people who live in terrible deserts with temperatures above 120degrees F in the shade. They don’t have air conditioners, and they don’t diefrom the heat. Could it be some genetic shield that protects them?The cause of this disaster was screaming at the medical profession, but no oneheard, voiced, or printed the appropriate public warning. Having lived in theKalahari Desert while in Africa, Wallach had taken basic medical physiology, andWallach was already a well-respected pathologist of animals and humans.. He knewthe horrible toll of the heat wave was the result of a simple salt (NaCl)deficiency!Hence the disaster was a physician-caused mass heat stroke! It was yourkitchen-variety heat stroke that any boy scout could diagnose, recognize, andremedy instantly with a glass of water spiked with a teaspoon of salt! Yes, thecause of these thousands of American casualties was a simple salt deficiency,and almost all of those who fell ill and died were those who had been placed ona salt-restricted diet by “their medical doctors” This was a physician-causeddisaster.The human tragedy of the heat wave of ’93 was the direct result of the medicalprofession’s paranoia about salt. They put their human charges on a low-sodiumor low-salt diet for prevention of hypertension and heart disease. There is nota single double-blind study that will show any benefit of a salt-restricted orlow-sodium diet.About a week after the carnage, the state medical examiners again marveled fromtheir pulpit, “The only common denominator of those who had died or werehospitalized during the heat wave were those who had been diagnosed with heartdisease or high blood pressure.” Yes, as predicted their physicians had placedeach one on a salt-restricted or no-salt diet” and none were contacted to warnthem that during the heat wave it would be in their best interest to drink eightglasses of water each day, and, oh yeah, by the way, “don’t forget to add ateaspoon of salt to each glass.” Those who quickly made it to hospitals and weresuccessfully treated were given IV saline solution—salt water!Yes, the medical profession must think the general public is dumber than a cow.Unfortunately for the general public, it is the medical profession itself thatis dumber than history.Aristotle noted in Historia Animalicem VIII that “sheep are healthier when theyare given salt.” Sheep never get hypertension or high blood pressure.Where salt was rare, it was traded ounce for ounce for gold, brides, or slaves.Salt, salt-rich clays, and wood ashes were the first mineral food supplementsused by man in the dawn of time. The Roman statesman Cassiodorus was quiteobservant when he said, “Some seek not gold, but there lives not a man who doesnot need salt.”Rome’s major highway was called Via Salacia or the Salt Road. Soldiers used theSalt Road to carry salt up from the Tiber River where barges brought salt fromthe salt pans of Ostia. Soldiers “worth their salt” were paid a “salary.” Theword salary is derived from salarium, a soldier’s “salt ration.”Marco Polo reported salt coins and discs in Cathay. Salt discs in Ethiopia were“salted away” in the king’s treasury. The production of salt as a foodsupplement for man and beast is as old as civilization itself. Salt was producedin shallow ponds of seawater through evaporation and by mining rock salt fromlarge land-locked deposits.The rock salt mines of the Alps (Salzberg, Halstatt, and Durrenberg) played anessential role in the development of cultures in ancient prehistoric Europe. TheHalstatt salt mine is the one of the oldest commercial salt businesses on Earth.It is located fifty miles from Salzburg (“Salt Town”). Salt has been mined fromthe Salzburg mine since the early Iron Age. Salzberg (“Salt Mountain”) containsa salt deposit 2,000 feet wide and 2,500 feet deep.Tools found in the salt mines date back to the Bronze Age (1400 BC). Earlycommunities sprang up around salt springs as humans followed and hunted wildherbivores that were drawn to the springs by their craving for salt—the behaviorof pica and cribbing. Wallach saw this same pattern in Africa: the muddy andcloudy water supplies that contained salt and minerals were heavily used by thegame animals, while water that was sparkling clear and was mineral and salt-freewas rarely consumed.Between the 9th and 14th centuries, peat was soaked in sea water, then dried andburnt, and the resultant ash was extracted with sea water. Many millions of tonsof peat, a plant source of minerals, was harvested for the mineral/salt dietarysupplement process for commercial trade.Mesopotamian towns specialized in the salt-production industry and transportedsalt up the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Jericho (8000 BC), near the Dead Seaand the salt mountain of Mo, and was one of the oldest known agriculturalcommunities that participated in the salt trade.The merchants of Venice developed an elaborate salt trade, and by the 6thcentury the salt trade from the villages surrounding the city was its mainbusiness. By 1184 Venice controlled the export of Chioggia salt, and by the 14thcentury was supplying salt to Alexandria, Cyprus, and the Belearic Islands.The salted-herring business developed in the 1300s. The Dutch perfected theprocess of salting fish as a method of preservation. At its peak, this industryalone produced three billion salted herring annually and used 123 million Kg ofsalt per year. In the beginning of the 20th century, salt pork and salt herringprovided the main source of animal protein for most of Scandinavia with a dailyper person consumption of 100 grams or a quarter of a pound. (Modern physicianswant their patients to consume less than three grams of salt per day.)Perhaps the most famous and most romantic modern day part of the salt industryoccurred in Africa. Twice each year great camel caravans carried salt slabs fromthe Taoudeni Swamp in the Sahara to Timbuktu in Mali. Two thousand to 25,000camels (only 25% of the animals survived the round trip journey) were used tocarry over 300 tons of salt slabs to their destination 720 km away.In other parts of salt-poor Africa, humans developed the practice of drinkingcattle blood and urine to obtain salt. The residence of the Sierra Leone coastgave all they possessed, including their wives and children, in exchange forsalt—after all, salt was a necessity of life. Salt, like other elements andminerals, is not distributed equally around the earth and is therefore covetedby the have-nots. It is said by African tribesmen that, “He who has salt haswar.”The British imposed a despised salt tax on India. Ghandi (1924) published amonograph (Common Salt) in protest of the government monopoly. Ghandi pointedout that the grains and the green foods of India were very low in salt. Becauseof the vegetarian habits of the majority of tropical Indians, they required asignificant salt supplement to their diet.In 1930 Ghandi led 78 “rabid” supporters on a 300 km “Salt March” protest fromAhmedabad to the sea. He swam in the sea, and picked up a crystal of salt on thebeach, and then walked back to Ahmedabad, where he was promptly arrested andthrown into prison. Angered, 100,000 Indians revolted against the salt tax andwere arrested after they too picked up untaxed salt. The British salt tax waseventually repealed in 1946 at the end of World War II.The death of soldiers from a sodium loss was historically common during militaryoperations in tropical countries. Soldiers in the desert could lose up totwenty-four pints of water per day as sweat. And that much sweat was not justwater, it was a soup that contained all the nutrients floating around in theirblood including up to seventy to one hundred grams of salt per day.Salt is known as the most universal and most widely used food supplement andcondiment. So great is the human craving for salt, it is obvious that saltitself is in fact necessary to the health, and even to the life and survival, ofman, Yet, it’s claimed by modern medicine to be dangerous. As we have seen, theonly danger from salt is that when one consumes it in response to a craving thathas been produced by a mineral deficiency, in which case the intake of salt willmask the absence of other minerals. The average salt requirement for a human isapproximately 0.5% of the dry weight of the daily diet or six to ten grams perday. If you are very good at following a doctor’s advice and restrict salt toless than one gram per day, you can increase your risk of a heart attack by asmuch as six hundred percent.In addition to the legitimate salt cravings, medicine’s efforts to suppress thehuman craving for other minerals is well documented:A catalogue of bizarre instances of human pica is found in the doctoral thesisof Augustus Fredericus Mergiletus (1701). In men, he recorded one individual whoate leather, wood, nestlings, and live mice. A second consumed woolen garments,leather, a live cat, and small mice. A third ate cat’s tails and decomposedhuman flesh infested with maggots.In women, Mergiletus recorded cannibals who ate human flesh, including onehorrible lady who “lured children to her house with the promise of sweets,killed them, and pickled them for storage and for consumption at a later date”—afemale version of Jeffrey Dahmer! The murders of the children where onlydiscovered when the woman’s cat stole the pickled hand of a child and carried itover to the neighbor’s house.Girls who ate their own hair, cotton thread from their own clothes, handfuls ofraw grain, and lizards have been documented.Cooper (1957), in her classic report on pica, refers to several ancient andmedieval writers who emphasized the occurrence of pica in pregnant women. Aetiosnoted pregnant women crave various and odd foods, some salty, some acid, sayingthat “some crave for sand, oyster shells and wood ashes.” He recommended a dietto include “fruits, green vegetables, pig’s feet, fresh fish, and old tawnyfragrant wine.”Boezo (1638) noted that pica occurred most often in pregnant women. Boezo sawpica as a physiological problem, and is the first to mention iron preparationsas a treatment for pica. He suggested “one and one half scruples of iron drosstaken for many days as wonderfully beneficial for men and women.”Boezo also noted the case of “a virgin who was accustomed to devour salt ingreat quantities from which chronic behavior she developed diarrhea andwasting.” She probably had Addison’s disease.Christiani of Frankfurt (1691) reported that a woman had eaten 1,400 saltherring during her pregnancy.LeConte (1846) suggested that animals eating earth do so because of a “want ofinorganic elements.”The most common descriptions of pica and cribbing by Mergiletus were of women’sdesire for clay, mud, and mortar scraped from walls, just like modern childrenwho eat caulking and lead paint. Wallach has often said that children who eatlead paint are screaming for minerals for their mineral-starved bodies. Givethem minerals and they won’t eat lead paint.Pica is no stranger in modern times. The substances most frequently reported tobe consumed as the result of pica in humans include paper, metallic gumwrappers, chewing gum, ice, dirt, coal, clay, chalk, corn starch, baking powder,pebbles, wood, plaster, paint, chimney soot, hair, human and animal feces, andcloth.In March 2012 it was reported on the national news that a three-year-old girl,Natale Hayhurst from Terra Haute, Indiana loved to eat light bulbs, paper,cardboard, sticks, dirt, aluminum diet soda cans, magnets from shower curtains,and plastic bottles and toys. There was a complete story in most localnewspapers about her “rare condition.” However, none of the reports mentionedthat her pica was due to mineral deficiencies, and when contacted neither herparents nor did any media show any interest in interviewing Wallach about theobvious mineral deficiencies that the poor child was obviously suffering from.In August 19, 2013, the British Daily Mail, reported that Kelly-Marie Pearce, apregnant 28-year-old woman, ate 5,000 bath washing sponges (twenty sponges perday) and bowls of foul feces contaminated sand from the bottom of a parrot cageduring her two pregnancies.In the same Daily Mail article stated that, “some develop pica because ofstress, obsessive-compulsive disorders, a liking for fragrances or behavioralproblems that would require cognitive behavioural therapy with an experiencedpsychologist.” How can professional health care providers so completely miss thediagnosis of mineral deficiencies?Because of social constraints on our public behavior, most people under publicscrutiny who suffer from mineral deficiencies and pica (aka: “The Munchies”)will chew gum, eat sugar (4.5 calories per gm), milk chocolate, snack food, orsoft drinks when their bodies are really screaming for minerals. Other sociallypopular ways to publically respond to pica and the cravings of mineraldeficiencies include smoking, alcohol, and drug use. Ice eating, known as“pagophagia,” is also common, particularly in iron-deficient children andadults.The research confirms these observations:Henrock (1831) attributed pica to “a paucity of good blood and a lack of propernutrition.”Waller (1874) reported that David Livingston observed many cases of clay andearth eating (geophagia), a common form of pica frequently observed in pregnantwomen in central Africa.Orr and Gilka (1931) and de Castro (1952) recognized that “edible Earths mightbe rich in sodium, iron and calcium.”Gilford (1945) reported that pica was common in Kenya amongst African tribes(Kikuyu) living mainly on a vegetarian diet. Pica was absent in those peopleseating diets rich in animal flesh, blood, and bones (Massai).Nicolas Monardes (1493–1588), a Spanish physician, published Historia Medicinal.In the second volume is a scientific dialogue on the “virtues” of iron. However,iron was not generally accepted for medical use as a supplement until the 1600swhen Nicolas Le’Mery found iron in an analysis of animal tissue ash.Dr. Thomas Sydenham (1682) recommended for all diseases involving anemia,treatment by “bleeding” (if the patient was strong enough) followed by a courseof Dr. Willis’ “Preparation of Steel.”In 1745 V. Menghini demonstrated the iron in tissue was found primarily in redblood cells. In the same year, Dr. Willis’ “Preparation of Steel” was marketedas a patent medicine. It consisted of iron fillings and tartar roasted and givenin wine as syrup, or rolled into pills.In 1850 it was reported in a medical journal that a woman who had lost threepremature pregnancies was given “iron scales from the smith’s anvil, steeped in“hard” cider during her entire pregnancy. The woman’s appetite increased, andher digestion, health, and spirits improved. She delivered a full-term boy whowas so strong that he could walk by nine months of age. At age five he was sostrong and tall that he became known as the “iron baby.”Dickens and Ford reported that twenty-five percent of all children ate earth.Cooper (1957) reported a twenty-one percent rate of pica in American childrenreferred to the Mother’s Advisory Service in Baltimore.Lanzkowsky (1959) reported that twelve children with pica had hemoglobin thatranged from 3-gm percent to 10.9-gm percent with a mean of 7.89-gm percent+/-2.64. The institution of iron dextran “resulted in a cure for pica in twoweeks.” Again, if children are consuming or supplemented with adequate amountsof minerals they will not eat lead paint.McDonald and Marshall (1964) reported on twenty-five children who ate sand. Theydivided the group in half, giving one group iron and the other group saline.After three to four months, eleven of the thirteen children given iron werecured of their pica behavior compared to three of the twelve given saline.Reynolds et al. (1968) reported on thirty-eight people with anemia who exhibited“pagophagia,” or ice eating, as the most common form of pica. Twenty-two of thethirty-eight had their pica symptoms disappear after correcting an irondepletion anemia.Woods and Weisinger (1970) reproduced pagophagia experimentally in rats bywithdrawing blood. The pagophagia in the anemic rats was cured when the anemiawas cured. They also noted that pica and cribbing behaviors were not produced byvitamin deficiencies or cured with vitamin supplementation.Two-thirds of the 153 pregnant women studied by Taggart (1961) developedcravings. The most common craving was for fruit, pickles, blood pudding,licorice, potato chips, cheese, and kippers. A craving for sweets, vegetables,nuts, and sweet pickles came in second place.Phosphate appetite was described by LeVaillant (1796) as the anxious search bycattle in phosphate-deficient South African pastures for discarded animal bones(osteophagia). Phosphorous-deficient cattle also chewed wood (termed cribbing orpica behavior) and each other’s horns.Osteophagia has been reported in many phosphorous-deficient wild species ofherbivores including the reindeer, caribou, red deer, camel, giraffe, elephant,and wildebeest.It was demonstrated that calcium-deficient weanling rats will consume largeamounts of a lead-acetate solution, even though it tastes bad, when compared tocalcium-fed controls.Lithium was discovered in mineral water in 1817 by August Arfvedson in a Swedishlaboratory in the town of Berzelius. Its use in mental illness dates back to 400AD when Caelius Aurelianus prescribed waters containing lithium for mentalillness.In the 1840s, it was reported that lithium salts combined with uric aciddissolved urate deposits. Lithium was then used to treat kidney stones “gravel,”gout, and rheumatism, as well as a plethora of physical and mental illnesses.Health spas picked up on the notoriety that lithium was receiving and oftentimes marketed themselves with exaggerated claims of the lithium in their hotmineral springs, even going to the extent of adding the word “lithia” to theirname to woo the general public. Because of the easy access to lithium salts bythe general public at hot springs and spas, physicians looked elsewhere forarthritis therapies.There are seventy-five metals listed in the periodic table, all of which havebeen detected in human blood and other body fluids. We know that at least sixtyof these metals (minerals) have a direct or indirect physiological value foranimals and man. Organically, not a single function in the animal or human bodycan take place without at least one mineral or metal cofactor.“On an inorganic chemical basis little distinction can be made between metals.Both metals and non-metals enter actively into chemical reactions. Thedifference reveals itself in the physical properties. By common agreement, thoseelements that possess a high electrical conductivity and a lustrous appearancein the solid state are considered to be metals,” according to Bruce A. Rogers,metallurgist and physicist.Minerals truly govern our lives whether we recognize it or not. Sadly, thecurrent medical “wisdom” on salt, and the medical profession’s inability torecognize that the various forms of pica that are exhibited in America, showthat we have failed to understand the true effects and importance of theubiquitous mineral-deficiency diseases.Most Americans suffer from diseases that are thought to be genetic by themedical community when they are in reality diseases that are preventable and orcurable with simple nutritional supplementation of minerals and dietary changes.These diseases are examples of events that can be explained and solved by theuse of our knowledge of epigenetics.Several racial and religious groups of American people suffer more than othersfrom “the lack of knowledge and laziness and greed of the medical community”according to the CDC.AFRICAN-AMERICANS“Black Americans have shed their chains made of iron and the white-only ballot,and yet, have again been enslaved by new slave masters—doctors in white coatswith fraudulent chains of DNA and a conjured up black gene.”—Dr. Joel D. Wallach, BS, DVM, ND andDr. Ma Lan, MD, MS, LACBlack Gene Lies: Slave Quarter CuresThe African-American community (aka Blacks) has long been abused by the medicalindustry who falsely teaches them that their common diseases, such as high bloodpressure, sickle-cell anemia, type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease,arthritis, cancer, as well as a high rate of birth defects and their shorterthan average life spans, are generated by a terrible “black gene.”Since the days of slavery, blacks have been taken advantage of by many, but themost insidious injustices have been from those in the the medical community.Poor health outcomes crushing Blacks and the poor were “scientifically”rationalized as being genetically and hereditarily predetermined. Segregation,involuntary sterilization, nihilistic public health and educational policies,and incarceration were considered “solutions” for the nation’s poor, disabled,mentally challenged, or racially “inferior” populations and the problems theycreated.Sympathy for the poor during the Great Depression, and the public’s reaction tothe rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany’s eugenic and dysgenic ideologies andpolicies, did help to slow and neutralize the increase of these hatefulpractices in America. By the end of World War II many of these activities hadgone underground or were almost completely discredited.The healthcare environment perpetrated the U.S. tradition of misusing Black,poor, socially disadvantaged (prisoners), and disabled (mentally-challengedchildren) patients for medical experimentation, eugenics, or medical schoolclass demonstrations. These practices were defended on the grounds of“scientific research” or the health profession’s need for subjects for “teachingpurposes” or studies to limit defective genes (and limiting the welfare rolls asa result).In the mid-1920s, highly respected African-American social scientists, such asE. Franklin Frazier, argued that white physicians regarded their black patientsas “simply experimental material.” This distance between medical ethics and U.S.health system practices happened on several levels, including, but not limitedto, utilizing uninformed or poorly-informed patient populations for researchthat results in injury or, at the very least, compromises their health outcomes.This includes performing excessive or unnecessary surgery on patients, oftenunder coercion or without their consent, especially for eugenic purposes. Itincludes tailoring patients’ care and treatment according to the professionaltraining or research requirements of the institution’s surgical demonstrationsand “teaching and training materials,” instead of attending to actual medicalneeds driven by the requirements of the individual patient’s case. This alsoincludes denying, inadequately treating, or abusing patients in need of simplebasic care or services because they fail to have rare diseases, are“uninteresting” or “routine” cases, or do not meet the standards for researchprotocols.Between 1930 and 1945, the picture of this misuse and abuse changed as theresearch excuse for these practices became more accepted. This was largely theresult of the Flexner/ Johns Hopkins model for medical education and biomedicalresearch that had been enacted at a network of major American medicalfacilities. The infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment, initiated in the 1930s isan example:Initially implemented as part of a U.S. Public Health Service/Rosenwald Fundrural syphilis public health and treatment program in the late 1920s, thenon-treatment phase of approximately 400 syphilitic Black men with 200uninfected controls began in 1932 in Macon County, Alabama (Tuskegee, the countyseat, is home of the famous Tuskegee Institute). The purpose was to study theeffects of syphilis on untreated African-American men. None of the patients werespecifically informed that they had syphilis. They were told they were beingtreated for “bad blood,” but no treatment was given during the study.Fueled by patient deception and professional paternalism that viewed thepatients as laboratory animals, the decision was made to block patients frombeing informed of or receiving the effective and standard treatment ofpenicillin available after World War II, and the 40-year experiment continueduntil 1972. It resulted in 100 deaths from untreated syphilis, scores of blindand demented participants from the ravages of the disease, numerous wives whocontracted syphilis, and their children born with congenital syphilis.The study produced numerous presentations at medical meetings and more than 13scientific papers. But it was scientifically flawed from the start, and most ofthe subjects received some treatment in order to render them noninfectious earlyin the study.The ethical conflicts of using patients for inhumane and unethical purposes andthe practice of overusing Black American patients for medical studies continued.Dr. John A. Kenny, one of the most influential and highly respected physiciansin the United States, exposed the enormity of the problem and gave hisperspective during this era. In his 1941 plea “that a monument be raised anddedicated to the nameless Negroes who have contributed so much to surgery by the“guinea pig route, he said:In our discussion of the negro’s contribution to surgery, there is one phase notto be overlooked. That is what I May vulgarly, but at the same time seriously,term the “guinea pig” phase . . . one of that practically endless list of“guinea pigs.” . . . (Un)told thousands of . . . Negroes have been used topromote the cause of science. Many a heroic operation performed for the firsttime on a nameless Negro, is today classical. Even Negro physicians, surgeonsand nurses, at times wince at the scenes . . . of Negroes used for experimentaland teaching surgery.One of the dark secrets of the American biomedical and health care systemsbetween 1960 and 1980 was the “epidemic” of forced sterilizations and unethicalsurgery. Why the Tuskegee syphilis experiment raised such an outcry and theforced sterilizations “rated hardly a whimper” is a story of medical racism. Dr.Kenny went on to say, most of the victims of this sterilization and thepreponderance of unethical surgeries “were the traditional targets of thescientific racists, Galton eugenics-oriented, hereditarian, social Darwinist,biological-determinist influenced U.S. scientific and health system—BlackAmericans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, lower middle-class and working class whitefamilies unable to afford the cost of proper medical care, the mentallychallenged, the disabled, the incarcerated, the indigent, institutionalizedchildren, and the unemployed.”By 1980 the United States’ sterilization laws had been in place for more than 70years; the first such law had been enacted in Indiana in 1907. Driven by SirFrancis Galton’s International Eugenics movement, 30 states and Puerto Ricoultimately passed similar forced sterilization laws. Most of these sterilizationlaws were based on the Model Eugenical Sterilization Law drafted before 1922 byHarry H. Laughlin, superintendent of the Eugenics Record Office (ERO) andcoeditor of the Eugenical News; he also authored a book entitled, EugenicalSterilization in the United States.The Model Law required each state to appoint a state eugenicist responsible forenforcing compulsory sterilization laws. These laws were directed at the“feebleminded,” insane, and criminalistics (including the delinquent and thewayward); epileptic; inebriate (including alcoholics and drug addicts); diseased(including patients with tuberculosis, the syphilitic, the leprous, and otherswith chronic infectious and legally segregatable diseases); blind, deaf,deformed and physically disabled, and dependent orphans; “ne’er-do-wells,” thehomeless, tramps and paupers—the state eugenicist’s jurisdiction included allthe above people he judged to be members of “socially inadequate classes.”According to Laughlin, of the 63,678 Americans sterilized under the eugenic lawsbetween 1907 and 1964, 33,374 (52.4%) “were sterilized against their will forbeing adjudged feebleminded or mentally retarded, which in most of these stateswas defined as having an IQ test score of 70 or lower (this included theilliterate).”Beginning with the Great Depression and World War II, “involuntary sterilizationin the American South had increasingly been performed on institutionalizedBlacks.” As Dorothy Roberts reported in her 1997 book Killing the Black Body:Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty: “The demise of Jim Crow (laws)had ironically opened the doors of state institutions to Blacks, who (then) tookthe place of the poor Whites as the main target of the eugenicist’s (doctor’s)scalpel.”In 1955 South Carolina’s State Hospital reported that all 23 persons sterilizedover the previous year were Black women. Of the nearly 8,000 “mentally deficientpersons” sterilized by the North Carolina Eugenics Commission between the 1930s,5,000 were Black. The State Hospital for Negroes in Goldsboro, where all of thedoctors and most of the staff were white, routinely operated on black patientsconfined there for being criminally insane, feebleminded, or epileptic.Before World War II, black men there were castrated or given vasectomies forbeing convicted of attempted rape, for being considered “unruly” by hospitalauthorities, or to make them “easier to handle.” None were asked for theirconsent.According to Chase: “These victims of Galton’s obsessive fantasies represented .. . the smallest part of the actual number of Americans who have in the (20th)century been subjected to forced eugenic sterilization operations by (doctorsemployed by) state and federal agencies.” Ironically, by the 1960s, when thefirst generation of mandatory sterilization laws were repealed, there was a waveof new laws assaulting reproductive rights and a massive unprecedented wave offorced sterilizations. Many of them were paid for by the government andfacilitated by new health financing mechanisms, often hidden under the cloak of“expanded health services for the poor, and carried out by (doctors employed by)health delivery system institutions already in place swept the country.” Theseprograms differentially affected and were executed on black American women.In 1974 it was argued before Federal District Judge Gerhard Gesell, in a casebrought on behalf of poor victims of involuntary sterilizations performed inhospitals and clinics participating in federally funded family-planningprograms, that: “over the last few years, an estimated 100,000 to 150,000low-income persons have been sterilized annually under federally fundedprograms.” A study discovered that nearly half of the women sterilized wereblack.Dorothy Roberts revealed that in the 1970s, “Most sterilizations of black womenwere not performed under the auspices of eugenic laws. The violence wascommitted by doctors paid by the government to provide health care for thesewomen.”These operations were occurring at the same time that sterilization became thefastest growing form of birth control in the United States, reaching a peak of1,102,000 in 1972 dropping off to 936,000 in 1974.Government officials estimated that an additional 250,000 sterilizationsannually, hidden in hospital records as hysterectomies, could be added to theprevious total. Blacks were disproportionately represented in these populations,and a new dimension compounded the system’s potential for abuse: “Teachinghospitals performed unnecessary hysterectomies on poor black women as practicefor their medical residents. This type of abuse was so pervasive in the AmericanSouth that these operations came to be known as “Mississippi appendectomies.”The last ten year American census (2010) showed that the American population isthe third largest in the world at 315 million, surpassed in sheer numbers onlyby China listed as number one with 1.5 billion and India second at 1.2 billion.Also, and even more importantly, the last ten-year census reported in 2010showed that the average black man lives to be 62, the average white man, 75, andthe average Hispanic lives to be 80.5. Why is there an eighteen year differencebetween the life span of a black man and a Hispanic man? Doctors will saygenetics and lifestyle. In reality the black man has been taught to overuse themedical system because of his medically created fears of his “terrible blackgene,” whereas the Hispanic man is still using grandma’s home remedies and theyjust don’t get killed as often by doctors as the blacks who overuse the medicalsystem.Two thirds of the men in American prisons are black, seventy percent of blackkids under the age of twelve are overweight, and almost forty percent are obese.The rate of dementia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes is higher in the blackcommunity than in the white and Hispanic communities, the rate of ADD, ADHD andautism is higher in Black kids, and the rates of gluten intolerance, skinproblems, asthma is higher in black kids.AMISH, MENNONITES, AND HUTTERITESThe Amish can trace their heritage back to the Swiss Anabaptists of 16th centuryEurope. Unhappy with the faith and practice of the Catholic Church in Europe,Martin Luther lodged a protest in 1517. His revolt ushered in the ProtestantReformation, resulting in Protestantism becoming a permanent branch or sect ofChristendom.After a few years, restless students of the Protestant Pastor Ulrich Zwingli ofZurich, became frustrated with the agonizingly slow pace of the ProtestantReformation. The young revolutionaries chastised Pastor Zwingli and the ZurichCity Council for continuing baptism of infants and conducting the Catholic Mass.Shortly after a confrontation with the city council, the young revolutionariesillegally baptized each other in a secret gathering on January 21, 1525. Thesimple religious service in a private home-birthed movement would become apermanent branch of the Protestant Reformation.The young rebels were given the name Anabaptists (“rebaptizers”), as they hadalready been baptized as babies in the Catholic Church.The civil authorities and local leaders of both the Protestant and CatholicChurches continued to insist that they alone held authority over the citizens.They believed that Scripture was the final authority on how they conducted theirlives.The civil authorities and local leaders of both the Protestant and CatholicChurches continued to insist that they held authority over the citizens andwithin five months of the initial rebaptism, Hans Landis, the leader of theAnabaptists was “killed for sedition.” He was beheaded September 30, 1614, onSt. Michaels Day. The followers of Anabaptism fled for their lives, and whenthere were gatherings they were held in the dark of remote caves. The Anabaptistmovement spread to Germany and then into the Netherlands.In the following two centuries, literally thousands of Anabaptists were executedby both civil and religious authorities. Anabaptist hunters were commissioned totrack down, torture, brand, put them to death at the stake by burning, drown,imprison, dismember, and generally harass “the religious heretics.”Describing the persecution of the Anabaptists between 1635 and 1645, an observerreported, “It is awful to read and speak about it, how they treated pregnantmothers, women nursing infants, the old, the young, husbands, wives, virgins,and children, and how they took their homes and houses, farms and goods. Yes,and much more, how they made widows and orphans, and without mercy drove themfrom their homes and scattered them among strangers . . . with some the fatherdied in jail for lack of food and drink.”The persecutions ebbed and flowed until the early 18th century and theAnabaptists were able to find refuge in Moravia, Alsace, the Palatine, theNetherlands, and later in North America. The Martyrs Mirror, a thousand pagebook, documents the decades of persecution.In 1527 the persecution drove the Anabaptists leaders to put down their beliefsas a universal guide for their daily lives: 1. Literal obedience to the teachings of Christ 2. The church as a covenant community 3. Adult, or “believers,” baptism after age 18 years of age 4. Social separation from the evil world 5. The exclusion of errant members from communion 6. The rejection of violence 7. The refusal to swear oathsOne scholar rendered the core of the Anabaptists belief down to three features: 1. A devoted obedience to teachings and example of Christ 2. A new concept of the church as a voluntary body of believers accountable to one another and separate from the larger world 3. An ethic of love which rejects violence in all spheres of human lifeIn the Netherlands, Menno Simons became an influential supporter of Anabaptism.Ordained as a Catholic priest in 1524, Simons soon found himself caught betweenthe authority of the Catholic Church and the teachings of the Anabaptists. By1531 Simons chose the Anabaptist’s interpretation of Scripture; however, he didnot officially forsake the Catholic Church until 1536.Simons rose to the status of a leader, writer, advocate, and preacher for theAnabaptist believers. He rose to such a level of influence that many of hissupporters and followers were referred to as Mennonists (Mennonites).By the late part of the 17th century a group of Anabaptists moved northward fromSwitzerland to the Alsace region, which is found in what is now modern Francebetween the Rhine River and the Vosges Mountains. A theological feud broke outbetween the Alsatian immigrants and those who stayed behind in Switzerland. Thedisagreement resulted in the formation of the Amish church in 1693.The Amish take their name from their founder, Jacob Ammann, a young Anabaptistleader in Alsace. For the most part, the Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites owntheir own subsistence farms and small manufacturing businesses, and take care ofthe majority of their own health issues.Several factors opened the Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites to being victims ofpredatory medical doctors. Firstly, the Amish are extremely trusting, as theirword is their bond, and they would like to believe that is true also of others;secondly they self-insure and their colony pays their bills in cash; and thirdlythey primarily get the majority of their food supply from the fruits of theirown farms and labor.In 1995 in Lancaster County, PA, an obstetrician/gynecologist brought civil andcriminal charges against an Amish midwife for practicing medicine without alicense. His purpose was to legally force the Amish community to use medicaldoctors for the delivery of their babies.On the appointed day, the little county court house was surrounded by hundredsof Amish buggies that had come to support the Amish midwife. They knew that if aprecedent were to be established in Lancaster County, eventually all Amishbirths in America would require a medical doctor in attendance.Just before the trial officially opened, a white-haired bishop from the localcolony approached the judge and asked if he could make a statement. The wisejudge agreed. The bishop said that the midwife in question was his wife and ifshe were found guilty, his daughters would deliver the communities babies, andif they were arrested, the neighbor’s wife would deliver the communities babiesand so on. He further stated that they had been delivering their own babies forhundreds of years and that they wanted to continue delivering their ownbabies—and they would move out of the state rather than have the medical doctorsdeliver their babies.The judge summarily dismissed all charges, and the Amish with buggies fromoutside the county and outside of the state pulled out and left to spread thegood news.The medical doctors who do get to see an Amish patient enjoy the cash paymentfor their services and they enter the Amish communities several times each yearto “raise money for research to look for the cure for the genetic diseases” thatplague the Amish communities.Ninety-nine percent or more of all of the “genetic diseases” that plague theAmish, Mennonite, and Hutterite communities are in fact simple, congenitalnutritional deficiencies of the embryo (for example: congenital deafness, cleftpalate, cleft lip, spina bifida, Down’s syndrome, cerebral palsy, limb defects,heart defects, hernias, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, celiac disease,asthma, skin problems, etc.) or are acquired nutritional deficiencies later inlife (for example: MS, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, all four dementias, heartdisease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, cataracts, macular degenerations,cancer, arthritis, lupus, IBS, Crohn’s disease, etc.).All of the birth defects are totally preventable with proper preconceptionnutrition and many of these, including cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy,can be reversed later in life.Certainly all of the diseases acquired as an adult can be prevented and most canbe reversed.The medical community claims that “the reason why there are so many birthdefects amongst the Amish, Mennonites and Hutterites is that they commonly marrytheir relatives; they inbreed, and as a result they have accumulated terriblegenes over the years”—all false beliefs.An example of misinformation for profit comes from the Windows of HopeFoundation in Holmes County, Ohio. Each year the Amish alone raise millions ofdollars for them to “do research to find the gene” or treatments for what theyare told are genetic diseases. If the Mafia were to do such a thing to acommunity of people the Untouchables would arrest them for racketeering underthe RICO laws.Windows of Hope Foundation’s list of “Genetic Diseases”DiseaseActual CauseAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 2 (*ALS)Free-radical damage to BrainHypertrophic CardiomyopathySelenium DeficiencyCerebellar Hypoplasia (Cerebral Palsy)Congenital Zinc DeficiencyCongenital HypothyroidismNitrate ToxicityCystic FibrosisSelenium DeficiencyDeafness (cochlear)Congenital Manganese DeficiencyHutterite Malformation SyndromeMultiple DeficienciesLimb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, Type 2ASelenium DeficiencySpinal Muscular Atrophy, Type 1Selenium DeficiencySudden Infant Death SyndromeSelenium DeficiencyTroyer Syndrome (lower Limb Stiffness)Multiple DeficienciesOne of the extremely common contributing factors to a high rate of birth defectsin the Amish, Mennonite, and Hutterite communities is that actual analysis ofthe soil on their farms by the state university’s agriculture departments hasrevealed that they have soil deficiencies of certain nutrients, which thenresults in deficiencies of those nutrients in the local crops. Many Amish knowthey need to supplement the feed of their livestock to prevent losing them fromnutritional-deficiency diseases or having to call a veterinarian to come out totheir farm for a high-priced visit.But as a rule the Amish, Mennonite, and Hutterite farmers believe that they canget everything they need from their food and that many of their degenerativediseases are genetic because that’s what doctors have taught them.Another extremely common contributing factor to familial clusters, increasedlocal birth defects, and increased rates of adult-onset disease is glutenintolerance. The Amish, Mennonites and Hutterites suffer from this at a higherlevel than the average American population as a result of a high-grain diet.According to a 2009 study published by the Mayo Clinic, thirty-one percent,almost a full third of Americans (115 million), suffer from gluten intolerance.The rate is higher (80%) in the Amish, Mennonite, Hutterite, Mormon, and SeventhDay Adventists communities because they consume large quantities of wheat,barley, rye, and oats each day, and so their numbers might be as high as havingfifty to seventy-five percent of their populations suffering from glutenintolerance.Gluten intolerance, over time, produces a gradual loss of villi from the smallintestine, resulting in a significant reduction in absorptive capacity. Fiftypercent absorption of nutrients from food that might have from zero to tenpercent of one’s nutritional requirement for selenium to begin with, willsignificantly increase the risk for cardiomyopathy heart disease, livercirrhosis, cancer, cataracts, macular degeneration, MS, dementia, infertility,muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, fibromyalgia, lupus, thyroid disease, andother illness.Putting an afflicted individual on a gluten-free diet and supplementing theperson correctly with the basic platform of the 90 essential nutrients andtherapeutic levels of the deficient nutrient will solve many health problems,save the community an enormous amount of unnecessary misery, save an enormousamount of unnecessary spending, and add many healthful years to the individual’slife."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENJOEL WALLACH: POLYMATHFrom these experiences on the farm, in the laboratory, and in the wilds ofAfrica, I quickly learned that it doesn’t matter whether one is a creationist ora student of evolution—our immediate mutual problem is that Earth, our planet,is a limited finite resource for the raw materials that are the basis of allplant, animal, and human life as we know it. Living organisms procure their rawmaterials of essential elements and minerals for reproduction, development,growth and maintenance, and for longevity from a thin, fragile blanket oforganic and inorganic matter and gas on or just above the earth’s crust.—Dr. Joel Wallach & Dr. Ma LanDead Doctors Don’t LieEDUCATION AND EARLY EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE FIELDS OF ANIMAL AND HUMANPATHOLOGYIn September of 1958 Wallach entered the Agricultural School at the Universityof Missouri, Columbia, MO, and because he had no grants and no money, sought outand got jobs feeding the university’s beef herd, milking and feeding theuniversity’s dairy herd, feeding and collecting blood samples from the poultrydepartment’s population of chickens, and also busing tables in the dormitory inexchange for two meals each day.Wallach spent extra time with Dr. William Albrecht, his soils professor,learning about soil nutrition and its effect on animal and human health andproduction. Considerable amounts of time were spent on weekends in Sanborn fieldworking with Albrecht and studying the various effects of the different types offertilizer on the yields and on the health of the animals and people who ate theplants that were grown in the field.Wallach was accepted into veterinary school on his first attempt because of thegreat recommendations from the university’s herdsmen. To work his way throughveterinary school, he added jobs in the department of anatomy by embalminganimals and preparing anatomy specimens for other students and the instructorsteaching specimens. He also worked for the veterinary pathology department as astudent assistant to Dr. Loren Kintner, the chief pathologist.In 1962, after graduating from agricultural school, Wallach was in his secondyear of veterinary medicine and his first year as a graduate student incomparative pathology working towards his PhD. There were special courses incomparative pathology, and Dr. Morehouse, the head of the department ofveterinary pathology, joined Kintner in mentoring the eager Wallach. By the timeWallach graduated from veterinary school, he had participated in and reviewedmore than 200 hundred human autopsies, including Vietnam casualties—bothAmerican and Vietnamese—along with performing thousands of animal autopsies ofpets, domestic livestock, laboratory animals, and road-killed wildlife. Wallachwas rapidly becoming an expert in comparative pathology (includinghistopathology, microbiology, parasitology, tissue chemistry, toxicology, andnutrition).In late December 1961, most of the teaching faculty of the veterinary school hadleft for family holiday visits and had left the service responsibilities for thevarious departments to the graduate students. Wallach, then 21 years old, wasresponsible for service pathology and the training of veterinary students inpathology.The very first day Wallach was on his own in the pathology lab, a sheep farmercame in and dumped fifty dead lambs on the floor. The night before the farmerhad lost 500 head of prime six-month-old lambs that were ready for market.When the lambs were opened up it was obvious that each lamb had blood the colorof chocolate milk. This blood condition, referred to as methemaglobin, is causedby the chronic consumption of significant levels of nitrates, and they all hadlarge goiters that were caused by the chronic exposure to the nitrates. Thenight they all died was a particularly cool night; the temperature had beenrunning at 40° F and had dropped to 19° F, and they had all died fromhypothermia in one night.It turns out that the source of the nitrates was the uphill farmer who hadapplied large amounts of high-nitrate fertilizer, which had found its way intothe sheep farmer’s well water. The nitrates had caused the goiter over asix-month period, and when the weather turned for the worst and the temperaturedropped the lambs could not survive.The lamb incident was the first mass die-off from pollution in the United Statesthat was proven by autopsy that included analysis of environmental conditions,the animals’ water and feed, and the lambs’ tissue chemistry, and as a resultthis was published in the Journal of the American Veterinary MedicalAssociation. In 1962 Wallach was only 22 years old and now had a majorpublication in environmental pathology—an event that would ultimately direct hislife.Over the next two years, in addition to veterinary school, Wallach took twoyears of graduate courses in comparative pathology and did service pathology,performing autopsies on both animals and humans. These cases includedexamination of clinical data, gross pathology, histopathology, tissuechemistries, toxicology, and microbiology to identify, bacteria, viruses, andfungi that might be the cause of disease.Wallach graduated from veterinary school at the University of Missouri in Juneof 1964, and because he already had enough graduate work to obtain his PhD, hewas immediately hired as an instructor by the Iowa State University’s School ofveterinary Medicine and also by the Iowa State Diagnostic Laboratory to teachcomparative pathology to graduate students of pathology and to do servicepathology. Concurrently, he was allowed to continue to take courses in humanneuro-anatomy and pathology to continue his goal of attaining his PhD incomparative pathology.In addition to his teaching responsibilities and his classes, Wallach wasrequired to do service pathology for the Iowa State Diagnostic Laboratory tosupport research projects for the veterinary school and medical school, wildlifedepartment, farmers, and the small and large animal clinicians.Soon Wallach was back to his typical routine of ten to twenty-five pathologycases per day by himself. A single case might include a tray full of humanorgans, human tissue slide sets and biopsies, a 2,000 pound Hereford bull, abucket full of laboratory rats, a pet dog or cat, a pickup truck filled with 200dead baby pigs, or twenty turkeys in a trash can. On occasion Wallach wasblessed with the carcass of a deer, fox, coyote, raccoon, bobcat, snake, fish,wild turkey, or pheasant from the wildlife department. The sources of the wildanimals ranged from road kills and wild animals bailed in hay to wild animalsthat had been killed after invading people’s basements.Wallach quickly learned that even free-ranging wild species were rife withnutritional-deficiency diseases. They were, for the most part, dependent on theland and the plants they ate for their supply of minerals. They were lucky ifthey found natural salt licks, or could swipe some trace minerals from atrace-mineral salt block set into a pasture for the domestic livestock, or foundclay beds, creek banks, coal deposits, or other sources of minerals. Manyweren’t lucky and suffered from a wide variety of preventable and curablediseases, such as infertility, congenital birth defects (spina bifida, cleftpalate, heart defects, cerebral palsy, deafness, and extra or missing limbs),and degenerative diseases (arthritis, osteoporosis, kidney stones, musculardystrophy and encephalomalacia, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, livercirrhosis, etc.).WORK ON AFRICAN WILDLIFE PROJECTSAt the end of his first year of teaching at Iowa State, Wallach had theopportunity of a lifetime. Jim Howard, one of his colleagues with whom he sharedan office, had to cancel a trip to South Africa to work on a wildlife projectdoing autopsies and parasite studies on a hippo killed in a population controlproject because his daughter had fallen severely ill with asthma, requiring thewhole family to stay in the United States.Wallach felt he could always come back and finish up his PhD, and theopportunity to work in Africa with wildlife might not readily become availableagain, so he requested a recommendation from Marlin Perkins of Mutual of Omaha’sWild Kingdom fame. And because of Wallach’s previous work history at the St.Louis Zoological Gardens with Perkins, and the fact that he was already apublished pathologist, Wallach was given Jim Howard’s now abandoned Africaproject.Wallach resigned his post at the state diagnostic laboratory and his teachingpost, put his graduate studies on hold, and prepared to leave in two weeks forAfrica! The staff at the diagnostic lab gave Wallach a going-away party, whichbragged an African theme. Literally in the midst of the festivities, Wallachreceived a telegram announcing that the position in Africa had to be put on holdbecause of political problems between the United States and South Africa, andthey couldn’t justify an American being involved in a high-profile conservationproject.Wallach made the decision to buy the tickets and to go on his own—to take theleap and go to Africa—this was it! He felt they could refund his ticket money ifthey really didn’t want him, and he wasn’t going to let an international feudinterfere with his African adventure.Before leaving for South Africa, Wallach spent a week in Douglasville, Georgiawith Harold “Red” Palmer learning how to use, assemble, and repair Palmer’s newcapture gun and tranquilizer equipment and the appropriate drugs.Wallach arrived in Johannesburg in the late spring of 1965 and was told he wouldhave to turn around and go home because of political problems between the UnitedStates and South Africa. Because of the apartheid issue, the United States hadimposed economic sanctions and blockaded shipments into and out of South Africa,and they felt that it would be a bad thing to have an American involved with ahigh-profile national conservation project.Wallach objected, saying he had only purchased a one-way ticket and he couldn’tgo home. After several days of negotiation, the offer was made for Wallach towork in a low profile position as a state veterinarian along the border withBotswana. His responsibilities would shooting wild animals that jumped thedouble border fence into the “kill zone” and collecting blood samples and ticksto screen for foot and mouth disease, heart water, and renderpest.There was only one hitch in the offer: of the three previous veterinarians theyhad sent there, two had died from Bilharzia (schistosomiasis), a blood fluke.Wallach spent several days in the veterinary library looking up the killerparasite and talking to the lone survivor.“What did the other two veterinarians die from?” Wallach asked, and the survivorsaid, “Bilharzia, blood flukes!” Then, he offered, “They all die! They all die!”It was obvious that the offer was meant to scare Wallach off. However, hedetermined through his reading that if he avoided open water (streams, ponds,lakes, livestock watering tanks, and so forth) the intermediate stages of theparasite couldn’t infest him, and he took on the post.Wallach was moved to a government veterinary office in Vryheid (Afrikaans for“freedom”), a small South African town within easy range of the work sites. Hewas given a government vehicle, a letter of introduction, driver’s license, arifle, ammunition, maps, autopsy equipment, and a collection bottles and tubes.Essentially the job was as a government hunter that was required to collectparasites, blood samples, and tissues specimens.Wallach’s found his accommodations were a small, sparsely furnished hotel room.Vryheid was an Afrikaaner-speaking town. The white population spoke 14th centuryDutch and the black population spoke Zulu. If anyone could speak English, theychose not to do so. Wallach picked up several grade school primers and began tolearn Afrikaans and Zulu. He also checked out history books and studied the dualhistories of the Afrikaan and Zulu cultures.Early in the mornings he was picked up by rangers and went to work. In shortorder the word got out that there was a “new sheriff in town,” and ranchersrecognized Wallach as “the American” and treated him very well. In short orderWallach became an expert in African wildlife diseases and parasitology.OPERATION RHINOThree months later, the Wildlife Department of the province of Natal contactedWallach and said they couldn’t get any local veterinarians to give up theirpractices to participate in Operation Rhino so if he was still interested, hewas by default elected. His daring had paid off!Between 1812 and 1896, the southern race of the white rhino was still recordedas far north as the Zambesi River. The Voertrekkers (Dutch pioneers) recordedits presence on the grassveld of the Orange Free State, the Transvaal, andMatabeleland. The incessant northward spread of agriculture from the Capegreatly reduced the suitable grasslands available to the white rhino, aspecialized grazing animal. The grass cover of the veld was burned and replacedwith field crops and citrus orchards.The white rhino is an example of an overspecialized animal that wasn’t flexibleenough to adjust to a new set of rules. He was physically limited to grazing onthe short grassy forages within a few inches of the ground. Sadly enough, therewas a lot of land left unoccupied by humans, but the available land usually hada dense cover of acacia or other dense bush with little or no grass—not theideal habitat for the white rhino. This was a classic example of Darwin’sconcept of the “survival of the fittest.” If the white rhino was going tosurvive and avoid going extinct, it would require human intervention andperpetual protection.In contrast to the white rhino’s specialized eating requirements, the smallerblack rhino was a more reclusive species and was fitted by nature with aphysique that would allow it to browse and feed off of the brush much like agoat.The black rhino had even learned how to break down the smaller trees to reachthe tender upper branches and twigs that were too tall to reach conveniently.Because of this versatility, the black rhino fared much better than the whiterhino until the naturally open veld had been tilled and planted, and then menbegan the clear the black rhino’s eco-niche.As late as 1890, small armies of armed Zulu poachers were commissioned tocollect rhino horn. They relentlessly hunted the scattered individuals of a oncegrand population of white rhino.By 1896 the white rhino was officially thought to be extinct until a small herdwas located in a minute triangle of land framed by the White and Black UmfoloziRivers in Zululand near the east coast of Natal (the lush mideastern province ofthe Republic of South Africa) overlooking the Indian Ocean. This area wasdedicated as the Umfolozi Game Reserve.In the 1930s an American biologist, Herbert Lang, came up with an idea tocapture a portion of the tiny herd of the remaining white rhino and translocatethem to the much larger Kruger National Park in the Transvaal because he fearedthat a natural or man-made disaster would wipe out the entire species.In 1939 the Crown land northeast of Umfolozi Game Reserve was finally declaredthe Hluhlue Game Reserve. The remaining bridge of Crown land in between the twogame reserves locally became known as “the corridor.”An estimated 350 white rhino were counted in the Umfolozi Reserve during a gamecensus in 1947. Fortunately, sympathetic legislators were able to increase thereserve acreage in the Umfolozi Reserve (south of the White Umfolozi River) fromits original pittance of 72,000 acres to 118,000 acres. This increase in acreagewas most welcome, although it was still far short of the 8,400 square miles ofthe Kruger National Park.The rapid increase in numbers had resulted from a combination of undisturbedbreeding and a gravitation and migration to the protection of the UmfoloziReserve by the uncounted individual stragglers from all over central andsouthern Africa. Continued protection by the Natal Parks Board saw the whiterhino numbers swell to a respectable 500 head by 1960.By 1961 the devastating effects of over-grazing in the Umfolozi Reserve by theburgeoning rhino population restricted to this small space was obvious even tothe casual observer. This was the irony of total protection! Unfortunately thewhite rhino had no natural predators remaining in the area, and to complicatematters, the “corridor” connecting the Umfolozi and Hluhluwe Reserves was comingunder serious political discussion to be broken up and turned over to the NativeTrust and turned into subsistence farms.If in fact, if the “corridor” was lost, the natural migration route to theHluhluwe Reserve would be totally disrupted. The specter of a repeat of the pastsins lodged against the white rhino glared at those who had nurtured the herdsfor so long and so well. There were two alternatives to consider: one was tocarry out Dr. Lang’s seemingly impossible dream of capturing and translocatingbreeding stock to other reserves and wild animal parks, and the second was tobegin a systematic management program which would include cropping the Umfoloziherds by licensed shooting.Halfway across the world in Douglasville, Georgia, Harold “Red” Palmer, anAmerican naturalist, had developed a revolutionary new tool: the tranquilizergun. Prior to the invention of the tranquilizer gun in 1957, field biologistswere limited in their work to perform live trapping and to shooting animals tocollect blood specimens, as well as reducing overpopulation of a species bycropping with a .303 Enfield rifle. By the end of 1958, the Georgia WildlifeDepartment had effectively utilized “Red” Palmer’s tranquilizer gun torepopulate the depleted deer herds on the Georgia mainland from pockets ofoverpopulation on the coastal barrier islands.Palmer chemically immobilized the first black rhino in East Africa, but had toreturn home to tend to a blossoming business. Additional expertise was needed inSouth Africa to push Operation Rhino forward.The Natal Parks Board drafted Dr. Anthony Harthorn, a physiologist from Uganda,as the project consultant. Dr. Harthoorn had been testing drug combinations ofmorphine for the capture of antelope and zebra in cooperation with “Red” Palmer.Working under the direction of the Head Ranger, Ian Player (brother of GaryPlayer, the great South African golfer), several rangers eagerly carried out thefledgling immobilization experiments.The initial immobilizing experiments on the white rhino were only fifty percentsuccessful in catching the rhino alive. Although the initial results wereexciting, everyone agreed that the survival percentage had to be higher. A fiftypercent mortality rate was believed to be too high a price to pay, since atechnique for moving the great 3,000 pound rhino once they had been capturedhadn’t been developed as yet.In 1962 the most powerful tranquilizing drugs available required such largevolumes of fluid that the projectile syringe or “dart” used to deliver the drugwas limited in accurate flight to ten yards or less. The volume/distancelimitation necessitated the use of a vehicle to chase (visions of the John Waynemovie Hatari!) the rhino until the cumbersome ten-inch-long dart could beaccurately fired at the frantic beast from a few yards away.By June of 1962, twelve white rhino had been immobilized—a fantasticaccomplishment that brought Operation Rhino a step closer to reality. A finalrefinement of the drug combinations, dosages, and the actual techniques fortransporting the captured rhino were required before the last few pieces wereput into the puzzle.In 1964 a new experimental drug, designated M-99 (Etorphine), was developed byRicketts & Son, a British pharmaceutical firm. The drug itself was a Class 1opium derivative that was 25,000 times more potent than morphine. The dartvolume and length could be reduced from ten inches to two inches and thediameter of a triple-A battery!The availability of M-99 allowed for the development of a new technique for thecapture team: the rhino hunters were now free to stalk the rhino on foot andcould accurately dart the rhino from ten yards in dense bush to thirty yards onthe open veld.Because M-99 was a Class 1 narcotic, its use required a licensed veterinarian tohandle the drugs. Initially attempts were made to engage local South Africanveterinarians; however, they were busy in their private practices and weren’tavailable to work full time on Operation Rhino.Then somebody remembered Wallach, the American veterinarian out there on theborder with Botswana, shooting trespassing antelope and cattle, doing autopsies,and collecting blood, tissue, and ticks for the Natal Department of Agricultureto track any imported infectious disease that might have a negative impact onthe domestic livestock industry.Wallach was moved to the Umfolozi Game Reserve at the base camp of Mpila (Zulufor “place of health”) and provided with a very comfortable thatched roof houseand a stable. Wallach would have to get a horse because fuel was too expensive,and many parts of the parks activities were accomplished from horseback. And inaddition to the wildlife responsibilities and Operation Rhino, Wallach was alsorequired to care for the health of the Natal Game Reserve’s 200 head of horsesand pack mules.It didn’t take long for the “jungle telegraph” to spread the word that Wallachwas some kind of doctor. There were no doctors, clinics, or hospitals within ahundred miles, and for the Zulu on foot such a distance might as well have beena million miles. The local Zulu began to line up every morning for “mooti” ormedicine, advice, minor surgery, and treatments of various kinds. Wallachdelivered babies, cleaned and debrided infected wounds, sutured lacerations,drew blood samples, and handed out multi-vitamins and non-prescription medicinesfor everything from parasites, arthritis pain to cough syrup.Obvious nutritional deficiencies were quite common. Simple vitamin Adeficiencies in children caused keratitis, corneal ulcers, and blindness.Omega-3 deficiencies produced eczema and asthma. Calcium deficiency causedosteomalacia in children and arthritis, and osteoporosis and kidney stones inadults. Iodine and copper deficiency produced anemia, varicose veins, aneurysms,miscarriages, and goiter in adults. Infants born with neural tube defects (spinabifida) and cleft palates from folic acid or zinc deficiencies usually did notsurvive the primitive environment. Infants born deaf were the result of mothersbeing deficient in manganese during pregnancy.Simple protein deficiency was a common problem and showed up as the bloatedchildren with swollen abdomens (Kwashiorkor). Beriberi, with its resultantcongestive heart failure and dementia from vitamin B1 deficiencies and pellagrafrom vitamin B3 deficiencies were common findings in those who lived primarilyon corn meal. He dispensed multiple vitamin-mineral tablets that he procuredduring his rare trips into the coastal city of Durban.From these experiences on the farm, in the laboratory, and in the wilds ofAfrica, Wallach learned that it doesn’t matter whether one is a creationist or astudent of evolution. Our immediate mutual problem is that the our planet Earthis a limited finite resource for the raw materials that are the basis of allplant, animal, and human life as we know it. Living organisms procure their rawmaterials of essential elements and minerals for reproduction, development,growth and maintenance, and for longevity from a thin, fragile blanket oforganic and inorganic matter and gas on or just above the Earth’s crust.Wallach immediately jumped into Operation Rhino. Because M-99 was still in itsearly stages of development and its availability was limited, there was littleinformation to guide him. The meager supply of M-99 was extended by adding othertranquilizers. The capture gun itself was a modified version of the standardcarbon dioxide-powered pellet rifle with an expanded barrel that wouldaccommodate the two inch long 20-gauge dart.The dart body consisted of an aluminum tube with internal threads on either end;the longer the dart barrel, the more volume it could deliver. The drugs wererequired to be in liquid form and measured amounts were placed in the front endof the tubular dart body with a syringe. The drug solutions were injected intothe animal by the forward movement of a rubber plunger. The force to move theplunger forward was provided by the production of carbon dioxide gas generatedwith calcium carbonate tablets and vinegar.The forward section of the dart was fitted with a threaded plug and a heavy dutybarbed hypodermic needle that would not bend or break on impact. The dart wasstabilized during its flight by a tufted tail piece that was screwed into therear of the tubular dart body.The brightly colored tailpiece contained a recess in its interior base largeenough to house a steel ball-bearing. A calcium carbonate tablet was placed ontop of the ball bearing and sealed off from the acid vinegar in the rear of thetube by a waxed paper membrane. The entire rear assembly was waterproofed by aseal of clear fingernail polish. At this point the construction of each dart wasa work of art combined with science—one had an intimate relationship with eachprojectile. Surely a similar feeling of pride at each finished dart was felt bythe primitive arrow maker.When the dart struck its mark, momentum carried the ball bearing forward throughthe waxed paper seal, and plunging the calcium carbonate tablet into thevinegar, it produced a rush of carbon dioxide gas, which in turn drove therubber plunger forward and injected the drugs.Many careful hours of stalking had often ended in frustration when the dartswould prematurely discharge in mid-flight or fail to go off after striking therhino.Perfection of the delivery system and equipment came when Palmer developed asmall percussion cap that would discharge consistently on impact. The smallbrass cap was placed in the base of the rubber plunger, so that when itexploded, the crude gases it produced would instantly drive the plunger forward,consistently and completely injecting the drugs.Once the rhino was darted, a team of two horse mounted Zulu game scouts followedthe disappearing rhino, keeping visual contact. The scouts were protected frominjury during the chase by wearing crash helmets and heavy leather gauntlets Thehorses were protected from the ripping thorns by a heavy canvas apron and paddedcoronet guards. Once the downed rhino’s position was fixed, the scouts wouldrelay the location to the waiting lorry crew by means of a walkie-talkie.The lorry would then be backed up to the nose of the immobilized rhino and the2,000-pound transport crate dumped on the ground in front of it. The massivecrates, constructed from imported fir, had a hinged door on either end tofacilitate the loading and unloading the rhino.Once in place, the door facing the rhino opened and a two inch thick manila linewas looped around the rhino’s head behind the posterior horn and then passedforward through the crate and out through a three-inch hole in the oppositedoor. When the rhino was administered Nalorphine, the M-99 antidote andrecovered from the drug cocktail’s effects (which usually took less than aminute) and stood up, it was pulled, pushed, and guided into the crate.In addition to the new M-99 being more potent than other drugs, it had a secondadvantage over the original cocktails in that it had an antidote that could beinjected intravenously to get the animal on its feet whenever the team was readyand the crate was in position. If the dosage of each drug in the cocktail wascalculated correctly, it would only take a few minutes to get the rhino cratedand on its way.Once the groggy rhino lurched to its feet, a crew of eight or ten men would haulon the line attached to its head to guide the dazed animal into the box. Thecrate, closed on either end and loaded with its valuable cargo, was winched upon a set of steel rollers hooked onto the bed of the lorry. The captured rhinocould be released in other parts of the park, or taken to the bomas (Zulu forcorral), where it would be trained to tolerate being locked up in the crate overlong oceanic voyages or overland trips to other countries.Between 1963 and 1965, a hundred white rhinos were captured and successfullytransported 450 miles to the Kruger National Park. The enormous cost of theoperation was partially financed by the occasional sale of pairs of white rhinosto American and European zoos and wild animal parks.By early 1965 a total of 265 white rhinos had been captured under the directionof Ian Player and moved to other reserves in Natal and the Transvaal, othernations in Africa, to several western nations of Europe and to the UnitedStates. These events, to say the least, were remarkable—an unbelievable task hadbeen dreamed up and accomplished. This massive exodus of white rhino had noparallel in the annals of modern conservation. It was rivaled and overshadowedonly by the Biblical accomplishments of Noah!When Wallach had arrived at the Umfolozi Reserve in 1965, the original captureteam was still there; however, many had been promoted to higher stations. IanPlayer, the leader of the original group, was now the Chief Conservator ofZululand; Nick Steele, the perpetrator of the idea to utilize horses forfollowing the darted rhino, had been promoted to senior ranger of the UmfoloziReserve; and John Clark, the original driver of the chase vehicle in theoriginal operation, was now in charge of the day-to-day catching and the bomatraining of the rhino.One invariably saw more small-animal life while stalking rhino than when takinga casual stroll through the grass. On many occasions, while concentrating on theapproach to a rhino, a family of warthogs would be flushed from their dustbaths. Their thunderous exit can make one think he has stumbled onto a buffaloand he’ll break into a nervous sweat followed by a deep sigh of relief. Thegeneral principles for stalking rhino are the same as those employed forstalking other animals. Sudden encounters are to be expected, but on manyoccasion Wallach couldn’t avoid being rattled a bit.Still early in his training period, John Clark and Wallach were stalking a rhinoon the open veld when Wallach flushed a cobra! Several cobas were on theirbellies in rather short dry grass behind a lone bull white rhino when Wallachheard a faint rustle to his right shoulder. Moving just his eyes, Wallach staredinto the flared hood of a ringhal cobra not ten inches away.The shiny black snake had been had been caught unaware by their silent approach.Alarmed, it had reared up with its hood flared in typical cobra fashion. Clarkwas only two feet away from Wallach, but Clark was so intent on stalking therhino that he was unaware of Wallach’s predicament.Fortunately, the ringhal is not an aggressive snake, and when it realized thatWallach was not a source of immediate danger, it lowered the front portion ofits body into the grass and moved off. Unlike most species of cobra, the ringhal(Afrikaans for ring-necked) gives birth to live young. These interesting snakesprefer to feign death when approached by turning over on their backs. However,if handled or accidently trod upon they will bite vigorously or eject a finevenom spray at their tormentor’s face.Following the snake’s departure, Wallach rolled on his back and sweatedprofusely for a few minutes before Clark realized that something had justhappened. They shared a chuckle and then went on and captured their rhino.For Wallach, the thirst to use a new skill was insatiable and he was anxious toget as much experience as he could before Clark left on an extended holiday.They were out driving in the hilly southwestern portion of the reserve near theMadhlozi River when they caught sight of a young cow rhino that met theirrequirements. She saw them get out of their vehicle and walk casually towardsher. The wind was in their favor; however, when they came within fifty yards ofher she turned and trotted off with her tail curled over her back in alarm.Sometimes a bold approach on the part of the hunter is less disconcerting to therhino than a sneaky approach in open country. The rhino has difficulty inrecognizing vertical objects, and as long as the hunter approaches from theperpendicular to the rhino’s gaze they are usually dazzled and will hold theirground.Wallach and Clark had failed in their first approach to get into dartingposition, but they stubbornly trotted upwind after the shy cow. Following her,they first went up one hill then down again, and they followed up the side ofone more hill, before throwing in the towel and deciding it was useless. As alast desperate effort to save the day’s efforts, Wallach applied “Kentuckywindage” and aimed the capture gun about four feet above the cow’s shoulder andlobbed the dart downhill over a distance of sixty yards. They saw the dartdisappear in the grass at the cow’s feet and thought that the day’s catchingefforts were officially a flop.As the young cow was retreating over the hill, Wallach noted that she wasshowing an unusually springy gait. Observing her for a few additional moments,Wallach realized that the cow must have gotten the drug somehow.They dashed back to the Land Rover and circled around to the hill’s ridge wherethe cow was now comfortably asleep in the shade. At a glance they could see thatthe dart had, in fact, struck her in the foot, needle first, and had held fast.By this time Wallach had more than fifty rhino catches under his belt and thiswas to be his longest and luckiest shot.In addition to catching rhinos and caring for two hundred head of horses,Wallach also collected water and forage samples to determine why the rhino andother animals ate and drink from certain sources and avoided others. It was ofparticular interest that the rhino preferred to drink what we thought of asdirty pond water rather than drink from crystal clear springs. It turned outthat the dirty pond water had a considerably higher level of minerals in it thandid the clear water that humans would have preferred.Another responsibility of the Umfolozi and Hluhluwe rhino team was to disperseor eliminate any competitors of the white rhino because certain species ofantelope, particularly impala and wildebeest, preferred the same short grassveld that the white rhino depended upon. During dry years when the grass grewslowly, large numbers of impala and wildebeest were killed at night. They werebutchered and the meat, skins, and trophy horns were sold to local ranchers andmining companies to feed their work crews, and the revenue was used to supportthe rhino capture operations.Because of his interest in pathology Wallach examined as many animal carcassesand internal organs as possible, looking for organic disease, parasites, andnutritional deficiencies. Much of this data appears in “the book,” The Diseasesof Exotic Animals, that was finally published in 1983.Clark’s holiday finally came and Wallach was temporarily placed in charge of thedaily capture operations and the boma training program for rhino to be shippedoverseas by ship. Wallach was able to capture several more rhino, keep the bomasfilled with new individuals, and meet his other obligations as a veterinarian inthe reserve and the people’s doctor at Mpila. If one could ever refer to rhinocapture operations as routine, most of these catches fell into that category.The more catches one made, however, the more confidence was built up. Every nowand then an incident would occur that reminded people in the operation thatrhino are wild animals and that becoming blasé about them could be dangerous.Wallach and others were looking for a young bull to fill the only empty pen inthe boma. The day was far from perfect for catching operations because of atwenty five mile an hour wind that was occasionally gusting up to sixty. Mostwildlife had sought cover from the driving wind and the chafing caused by thesand being whipped up from the veld. After an entire morning of searching theyhad caught only a brief glimpse of three black rhino as they covered the openveld with their tails held high in the air and their rumps to the fierce wind.A troop of about fifteen Chacma baboons occupied their attention for a fewminutes as they began quarreling over some delectable scorpions at the edge of apan. While they watched they also took a short rest to eat sandwiches andcookies and then continued the drive east along a little-used vehicle tract.Before long they came upon a small bachelor herd of five young bulls takingshelter from the wind in a shallow pan. Making a stalk on these animals wasfairly easy, as they were battened down in the mud with the roaring of the windin their ears and the constant blast of the windblown sand on their backs.Wallach was able to creep within fifteen feet of the rhinos, thus reducing thewind’s deflecting effect on the dart. After picking out the most likely lookingbull, Wallach darted him in the shoulder just above the waterline. The herd,caught completely unaware, thundered from the pan with mud and water flashing.The game scouts that we would normally use as horsemen to follow the dartedanimal were on another assignment, so they began to trot and tagged after therhinos, trotting about twenty yards apart, keeping their eyes on the ground soas to not lose the rapidly fading tracks in the windblown sand.Suddenly, Wallach realized there was a large mass on the path in front of him.He came to a slow motion stop and saw an old cow rhino with an unusuallystraight horn staring intently at him. Behind the cow was a 2,000 pound bullcalf turning first to the left, then to the right, in a blind panic andconfusion. Wallach whistled to let the old girl know that the shadow in front ofher was a human, with the hope that she would turn and trot off.Only then did Wallach realize that he was on her windward side. The wind wasdriving his scent to her and it was too late! She charged strait into the wind,her head in the attack position for optimal use of her horn. Wallach was stumpedfor a moment, as he hadn’t been in this position before, but she then camewithin ten feet and continued to disregard his shouts, so he pulled himself upinto a handy acacia tree just as the bull calf wacked the tree’s trunk with acertain degree of devilish gusto.Moses, their driver, drove up with the lorry in short order, a broad grinflashing on his face. After Wallach broke down and smiled back at him, he letout a hearty laugh, for he had truly been initiated into the catching team atlast!They picked up the drugged bull with anticlimactic ease and deposited theircatch at the boma. A message was waiting for Wallach to contact Nick Steele, thesenior ranger, as soon as was convenient. When Wallach arrived at Steele’soffice, Steele was a tense and tight-lipped man. After inviting Wallach to sitdown, he related a chilling story.A woman had been killed by a white rhino in the Biyala native location as shewas returning to her kraal with a load of firewood. The tragedy had beenwitnessed by her eight-year-old daughter who ran back to the kraal for help. Tocomplicate matters, the poor woman had an infant strapped to her back in thetraditional Zulu fashion. Her would-be rescuers found the infant miraculouslyunharmed, silent, and wide-eyed! This story took the humor out of the day’searlier events.In the past, the dead mother and her children had met a lone rhino on the pathto the kraal on many similar occasions, and the normally docile white rhino hadsimply left the path at the appearance of the villagers. This time, however, forsome unknown reason, the rhino chose to hold its ground and flared its nostrilsand let out great chuffing and snorting sounds. The woman was still unafraid soshe picked up clods of dirt and threw them at the determined rhino.Initially the rhino seemed baffled by this response, because it was allowed togo on for several moments without a reaction. Finally, the rhino decided that ithad had enough and lowered its head and came straight for the woman, who stoodher ground, shouting and waving her arms until the aggravated rhino struck.The rhino’s horn struck her in the groin with a jolting uplifting movement— thehorn passed through her body to reappear between her shoulder blades, narrowlymissing the child on her back. Only then did the older child, until then frozenwith fear, run weeping back to the kraal.Steele related that we were now only waiting for official permission from theNative Trust to enter the location and capture the dangerous killer rhino. Heexplained to me that the Biyala were justifiably upset. However, they alsoseemed to believe that the ParksBoard was responsible for the animals terribledeeds.The head man of the kraal was very worried because most of the young men hadarmed themselves with their spears and a few handmade shotguns and disappearedinto the bush. These proud people were not poachers but cattlemen. In the past,they had been fined for permitting their cattle to graze in the game reserve andcause damage to the veld.To the Biyala, the parallel was simple: if they were held responsible for theactions of their cattle, the Parks Board should be held responsible for theactivity of all of the game animals. As a result of this belief, Steele feltthat there was a serious threat to the ninety-five rhino in the various nativelocations as well as to the rangers who hoped to rescue them.Five days past before the team received permission from the Native Trust toenter the Biyala location. In addition they were now officially sanctioned totake in a squad of DSAP (South African Police). It took three more days toorganize and coordinate the operation. When they left the main camp they were infull-dress Parks Board uniforms and fitted with side arms. Their Land Rover wasrigged with a field radio set on a frequency with the Mpila office and the SAPvehicles. This was the only time they were required to carry side arms on rhinooperations during Wallach’s stay with the Parks Board.They drove to the Madlozi camp, where they picked up John Tinley, the regionalranger and his head tracker. Tinley was the Parks Board’s gentle giant he wassix foot seven inches tall, soft spoken and very likeable. He was also one ofthe Parks Board’s best rifle shots. It was a good feeling to have Tinley’s riflebacking them up on this expedition.The small safari of two Land Rovers and two lorries reached the police outpostby mid-morning. The Biyala head man was there and he was shaking his headwoefully as he explained to the sergeant that the kraal’s young men were stillupset and apparently bent on seeking some form of revenge.After a quick tea the safari left with the addition of three more Land Roversfilled with armed SAP. On the way to the area where the woman had been killed,the headman explained that there were more than ten white rhinos in the area andthere was no way to identify the killer rhino with any degree of certainty.When they arrived at the kraal, they found small groups of silent women andhushed children watching us with somber eyes. The only men in the camp were theheadman and a half dozen elders. It was readily apparent that they not only hadto be concerned for the rhino’s safety but also for their own!A check of the bush immediately surrounding the kraal revealed the fresh signsof many white rhino. Steaming dung piles and sharp distinct tracks in the dustlet us know that there were several rhinos of different ages in the area. Theeight day delay in getting to the scene had allowed the offending rhino’s trailto grow cold. After a thorough look around they radioed Mpila to ask just howmany rhinos were they supposed to capture and relocate to Umfolozi under thecircumstances. The message came back that they were to catch at least one, andfailing to do this they were supposed to find an old bull and shoot it.Hopefully this would satisfy the villagers hunger for revenge.After loading up two darts (one for Wallach and one for Tinley), they spread outand gingerly began a crisscross search through the dry brush. Suddenly a lonebull was flushed from his hiding place in the dense thorn and nearly ran downTinley’s head tracker.Deftly stepping aside with the grace and confidence of a matador, the ever-alertscout allowed the bull to pass in a blind frenzy. Now they followed the trackerfor nearly a mile before he pointed to the bull’s ears sticking up over some lowbush about one hundred yards away. They were downwind but the dry leaves on theground prevented a silent stalk and placed the odds in the bull’s favor.The bull was quite alert to their presence and kept a constant distance of fortyyards ahead of them. On the open veld one could easily sink a forty yard shot.However, in heavy bush it might as well be a hundred miles. A single blade ofgrass could deflect the dart’s flight sufficiently enough to cause a miss. Theyhad to get closer!As they reached the base of the slope where Tinley had a vantage point hesignaled violently for Wallach to turn on his walkie-talkie, and when hecomplied, Tinley radioed that he had located a cow and calf from his vantagepoint. He related how the cow and calf had neatly avoided them by standing stillin a heavy screen of brush, allowing them to pass within a few yards.They fanned out again and turned back with the dart gun cocked. Wallach heard asnorting and crashing of brush to his right as the cow burst into an openclearing. Just in time to stop Wallach from darting her, Tinley shouted that hehad already darted the cow. They waited a few minutes before trailing her, andthen they found her lying down in some open bush with her calf nudging her in aneffort to get her up and escape. The squealing calf was bewildered at hismother’s sudden desire to sleep in the face of eminent danger.Wallach unloaded his dart gun, opened the dart and poured out half of theprecious M-99 as the dosage was calculated for an adult rhino. It was then asimple matter for him to walk up to the calf and dart him from about ten yardsaway. The young bull went down quickly next to its mother. After anchoring bothanimals to a tree with ropes, Wallach radioed the lorry crew to come up andbring the SAP.While the vehicles were grinding their way over the rough terrain towards thecapture team, ten old women and twenty-five chattering young children appearedout of the brush to see and touch the rhinos the “uniforms” had “killed.” BigJohn kept the women and children entertained with jokes and stories told influent Zulu until the lorry arrived. The SAP squad posted themselves around theRhino, and their presence probably prevented any attack from the kraal’s youngmen.The first shipping crate was dropped in front of the cow. The Biyala childrenclosed around them with an intense curiosity as the rope was looped around therhino’s head. Their curiosity was brought to a greater peak when Wallachinserted the needle containing the antidote into the cow’s ear vein. Tinleydescribed in fluent Zulu that they were wizards and that they were going to wakeup the “dead” rhinos and take them home!When the cow stirred to get up, a huge sigh of awe was released from thestartled women and children. As the cow was guided nimbly into the crate, atorrent of approving laughter and applause was released by the children.The calf was able to get up without the need for the antidote and was easilyushered into the second box. They had plenty of help with the massive rollersthat afternoon since the older children volunteered to help lift them intoposition on the tailgate.The crates were loaded onto the lorries and they happily left the Biyalalocation just as darkness was falling. The squad of SAP left them at theboundary fence of the Umfolozi, and they were thankful that they didn’t have tocome to blows with the Biyala as they were normally good neighbors.As they drove straight through the Umfolozi Reserve on the main tourist road,Mpila headquarters radioed and Steele was informed of the successful mission inthe Biyala location. He could now relax the alerted scouts and rangers. The teamcrossed the Black Umfolozi River and continued north through the corridor toHluhluwe. The cow and calf were released to the safety of the reserve in thedarkness. They trotted off, uncertain of their new surroundings and unaware ofthe drama that had taken place on behalf of their kind.The Parks Board was determined to remain good neighbors with the surroundingZulus in the various locations, and to show their thanks to the Biyala for beingso patient with them, they shot six wildebeest and sent the meat to theirkraals.The white rhinos’ seasonal migration to the south was anticipated with someaversion by the Umfolozi field rangers. These annual marches left rupturedboarder fences and sparked some rather colorful complaints from the subsistencefarmers in the Palumbo native location. The continuity of the Umfolozi and thePalumbo location was broken only by a four-strand, 5/8th inch steel cable fence.This single barrier was erected in hopes of discouraging the rhino fromgravitating south back into the native location. To date, the fence had onlyeffectively acted as a boundary marker. The rhinos’ determination to reach thelow veld was so urgent that it took an animal only a few days of pushing on thecable barrier to break through.As if drawn by some beacon known only to them, large numbers of rhino would findthe breach and pour through. Constant fence patrols by the game scouts of theOgome Ranger Station were necessary to guarantee the integrity of this barrier.Large deposits of fence posts and steel cable were placed at strategic pointswere rhino had often broken through the barrier in the past.Once an uprooted pole or broken cable was reported, it was the responsibility ofthe station ranger to get his fence crew organized and repair the gap. When notrepairing fence line, these crews were kept busy clearing brush, to allow shadedand dormant grass seed to germinate, or building stone weirs in heavily erodedareas to capture silt brought by the rains and refill the ever growing dongas.At the request of the Palumbo district headman, Clark and Wallach wereorganizing a three-day rhino catch to remove as many Mkhombe (Zulu for whiterhino) as possible from the mealie (corn) fields that belonged to several of thekraals.The mealies are the Zulu’s principal food crop, providing their major energysource. This is eaten as a porridge called mealie-pop (corn meal mush). When thewater is allowed to boil completely off, the firmed-up mass, called putu, iseaten as we would eat corn bread or grits. The heavy dietary consumption of cornby the Zulu placed a heavy risk of developing pellagra and beriberi to theirtribal communities.Mahao (beer) is also brewed from the mealies. It is quite acrid and takesgetting used to. But after several hours of wandering through the heat of theopen veld the beer is a most welcome refreshment. The beer is made by fermentinga thin gruel in woven grass pots; the evaporation of water through the pot keepsthe fermented beverage pleasantly cool.Apparently several white rhinos had decided to use the fields as a shortcut toreach water from their grazing areas and favorite resting sites. The rhinos atethe sprouting mealies and damaged a considerable number of mature stalks intheir passage, and their presence kept the women from working out in the fields.Some years earlier a similar situation had arisen and a headman had killed awhite rhino to save the life of one of the villagers. He was so distraught athaving killed a protected royal game species that he turned his gun on himselfand took his own life. The local magistrate no doubt would have found theanimal’s shooting a justifiable act.By an actual air count, they counted some forty-two head of white rhino that hadtaken up residence in the Palumbo district’s mealie fields.When possible they preferred to put rhinos that were caught outside the reservein the bomas or directly on a truck bound for another nearby reserve. Taggingexperiments had shown that a considerable percentage of the animals that werereturned to the reserve had wandered out again. It was unfortunate that theirbomas were full because they then had no alternative but to release the rhinosthey hoped to catch back into the already burgeoning Umfolozi Reserve.They arrived at the Ogome Ranger Station at about 10:00 A.M. and had tea whilethe game scouts unloaded the team’s gear. The station consisted of a five room“temporary house” that had become permanent, an office, a radio shack and aseries of sheds and lean-to’s for the horses and their tack. John Daniels, theresident ranger, was at present on leave in Durban. His houseboy extendedDaniels’ hospitality and took their duffle inside and set up their cots on thescreened-in veranda.Moses and the heavy Bedford lorry eventually arrived with a single empty rhinocrate and a complement of six boma laborers. They climbed in the vehicle and thecapture team headed south, through the southernmost extension of the UmfoloziReserve. It was a rugged, boulder-strewn area with heavy bush that provided aperfect habitat for bush antelope such as nyala, greater kudu and waterbuck.After passing out of the reserve through the boarder gate, they slowly ground anew road through the bush with the Land Rover and lorry several miles into thelocation to the Palumbo general store. There they met their game scouts andhorsemen. When they arrived, they were already surrounded by a score ofchattering Zulu children, fascinated by the safety equipment and fine horses.They took time out to discuss and share the purpose of the mission with thechildren and show them the cavernous gray box into which they would hopefullyplace the great mkhombe.The headman stoically stepped forward. He wore the impeccable uniform of aBritish First World War cavalry officer. He was a most remarkable man who couldspeak six languages fluently. He introduced himself in French and when weacknowledged his lingual superiority, he smiled and proceeded to try Wallach atGerman, Portuguese, and Afrikaans before resorting to English with adisappointed sigh.He shared with them that at least eight white rhino were trampling the kraal’smealies in their daily excursions. While they talked, Wallach made up two dartsand filled them with enough to immobilize an adult rhino. The watchful villagechildren followed each step with great interest. Several asked to touch the“little arrows.” One little girl tried the resiliency of the rubber plunger bychewing on it vigorously.Once their preparations were completed and the equipment checked, they followedthe scouts out across several freshly plowed fields. Wallach and Clark were ledto a small patch of veld between two sprouted mealie fields where two smallherds of rhinos were having a morning siesta. They were resting on the bareearth created by the shade of a lone acacia. The dusty, well-worn loafing areawas surrounded by grass and a slight wind was angling from Wallach to thesleeping rhinos. Clark and Wallach circled to get downwind and stalked to withintwenty yards of the largest of the two groups.The rhinos were grunting and blowing in a relaxed fashion, completely obliviousto our presence. They sat for a moment to catch their breath and survey thesituation. This group was consisted of four animals. A large bull lyingbroadside to the left and three animals sleeping in a line facing them just offto the right by about ten yards.By finger drawings in the dust, it was agreed that Clark would dart the largebull on the left and Wallach would dart the largest of the three on the right.Wallach counted to three in a whisper, they fired their darts simultaneously.Clark’s dart struck the bull in its left shoulder and Wallach’s dart hit itsmark at the junction of the neck and shoulder of the second rhino.The assaulted rhinos jumped up with a start and were off into the windimmediately. The horseman followed the retreating rhino close behind, however,Clark and Wallach were momentarily cut off from following as the upper herd cutback diagonally down the hill with the wind. They skirted the approaching rhinoand came up upon the original group at a tree line. They found the two dartedanimals lying down less than thirty yards apart in a small clearing. They chasedoff the two smaller rhinos and instructed the horsemen to keep tabs on them forlater attention.Clark went for the lorry while the headman and Wallach remained with theimmobilized animals and discussed rhino. A large group of Zulu women andchildren had stepped cautiously out of the trees and were babbling inamazement—they were continuous asking if the beasts were dead.It was well after 1:00 P.M. by the time the lorry returned to pick up the secondanimal for release into the Umfolozi Reserve. While the animal was being cratedand loaded Wallach made up two more darts for adult rhinos and then followed thehorse’s tracks into a wide thicket of low acacia bush. By now the heat of theday was at its peak and a shattering beat was coming from the “Christmas bees.”The insects were not actually bees but were actually summer cicadas. Each summerthe male insects produce a tireless shrilling from their vibrating tymbals, forthe purpose of attracting receptive females. The tymbals are modified membraneswhich they can vibrate by means of a small muscle. The sound produced isamplified to screaming proportions by another set of membranes in the cicada’sabdomen. Combined with the heat waves rising off of the bush veld, the screaminginsects gave an eerie background to rhino stalking through the dense thorn onhands and knees.After an hour’s tracking, Wallach and Clark spotted four rhinos fifteen yardsahead, resting in the sparse shade afforded by several twisted acacia. Inwhispers, they formulated their plans. Wallach was to remain in position whileClark circled around to the right and downwind of the herd. After Clark signaledhe was in position, Wallach was to dart a rhino, and Clark would dart the secondas the herd passed him downwind in their attempt to escape.At Clark’s whistle, the quizzical rhino stood up and unexpectedly moved a fewsteps into the bush. The cheek of a large cow presented Wallach with his onlyclear shot. Wallach could barely make her head out through a small opening inthe bush about ten inches in diameter. He aimed the dart at her taut cheek andpulled the trigger. It struck the rhino with a loud “schlup” and he feared thatthe dart had struck her ear and the drug had been ejected uselessly into her earcanal.The darted cow reversed her direction and led the other rhino in the oppositedirection of Clark, who stood up and took a chance shot that hit a tree limb.The darted cow went down peaceably on the edge of a donga in about ten minutes.Her nine-hundred-pound calf stayed close by, so Wallach prepared another for itand another for a second adult animal. While he worked to prepare the darts twobulls moved noiselessly toward the donga.Clark darted the calf and Wallach darted one of the two half-grown bulls thathad stepped out of the bush in response to the calf’s frantic calls. The bull,stung by the dart, brushed the irritating object out of his hide as he made hisway back through the bush. Upon examining it, Wallach found that the percussioncap had failed to go off. In the meantime the calf had followed the tworetreating bulls back into the open veld, where it went down hard on its side,throwing up a cloud of dust. The two curious bulls turned back and hung aroundtrying to encourage the calf to get up and leave with them.Wallach rammed the misfired dart back into the gun and stepped out from thecover of the bush and darted the nearest bull as he started to trot off. At themissile’s impact, the astounded rhino stopped, whirled around to face him, andstared. After a ten-minute wait, it was apparent that the percussion cap wasfaulty, and it hadn’t gone off for the second time.Wallach moved around downwind, and went to the Land Rover that Moses hadthoughtfully brought up and quickly prepared a dart for another target. Onreturning, the rhino caught Wallach’s scent and turned defiantly in hisdirection. This again necessitated a wide semicircle before he could come intorange without scaring off the two bulls. Wallach crawled back into the cover ofthe bush where Clark was waiting and loaded up the capture gun again.Wallach moved forward under the bush so he could get a clear shot at the rhino’sshoulder. At sixteen yards, all he could see of the six foot tall animal fromunder the brush was its feet. When he got to his knees to take a shot, the bullsturned and ran towards him. He fired the dart into the lead animal’s shoulder.The dart hung there just momentarily before being flipped out by the violence ofthe bull’s mock charge. The old question of “did the animal get the drug ordidn’t he?” came up again, and this was no doubt the last crack at him that day,since it was rapidly getting dark.Clark and Wallach waited under the bush for a long five minutes. Still theanimal stood and stared in our direction. Then he awkwardly took two goose-stepsforward, and they sighed in relief. He walked toward their bush in exaggeratedmarching band steps, passing within a few yards of them while his companiongalloped in wide circles, bellowing and tossing his head.They reluctantly watched the horsemen chase off the non-drugged bull, but, asthings were, they would do well to get three sleeping rhino out of the bush thatnight without a mishap, using only the lights of the Land Rover.When the lone lorry returned and Moses saw the three animals down, he shook hishead and volunteered a pessimistic “Whoa, whoa,—this is the day we die!—meaningthat he and his crew were going to be worked to death that day.The bull was loaded first and the crew anchored the cow and her calf to a treewith ropes. Clark took a turn at guard duty while Wallach went with Moses tosupervise the bull’s release on a river bank so precious time would not bewasted completely off-loading and reloading the crate.When Wallach and Moses returned to the downed rhinos, it was pitch dark. Theyhad been without food and water for nearly fourteen hours, so in their absenceClark had been exploring the dry stream bed for water. They found him on hisknees digging in some likely-wet sand. At a depth of one foot, black water beganto fill the cone-shaped hole. The water was cool and slightly salty, but it wasa very refreshing treat, even though they were only able to get a few ounceseach.Clark took the cow for release while Wallach stayed back with the calf. When thelorry and crew returned at 8:30 PM, the bull’s companion had appeared againlooking for his chum, and the calf was beginning to come around and cry out in aplea for help. Wallach had to sit on her to keep her down while the crate wasbeing unloaded. She was hustled quickly into the oversized crate, the procedurebeing aided by her alert state. The crew was soon heading back with the smallcaravan of lorry, Rover, and horsemen—all tired but jubilant because they hadset a record of five rhino caught and moved in one day, and with only one lorry!They arrived at Ogome at about 10:00 PM Clark and Wallach took turns having amuddy but welcome bath. Then they raided the Daniels’ icebox, flopped into theircots, where sleep came quickly.Wallach and Clark were awakened at sunrise by the braying arrival of thedonkey-drawn water tank coming up the hill from the White Umfolozi River. Eachmorning three hundred gallons of the brown river water were collected and hauledto the top of the hill for the outpost. In addition to meeting the needs of theresidents of the station, the horses, donkeys, and flowers all required theirration.Daniels’ wife, Pat, kept herself busy by keeping a rock garden that containedmost of the local flowering succulents. While enjoying the pleasant jingling ofthe donkey harness, Wallach and Clark shaved, dressed, and then cleaned the useddarts and put them to boiling while a hearty breakfast of warthog, eggs, andpotatoes was consumed.Once again the entire safari headed south for the Palumbo. On arriving at thestore, the scouts informed Wallach and Clark that a small group of three animalswas resting up in a dense patch of bush only a quarter of a mile away. Thedapper headman waved his arms about while relating the great deeds of theprevious day to the now eager audience. Two darts were assembled with greentails for adult rhino and two with white flights for yearlings, since thetrackers descriptions did not include the rhinos’ age or size.The darting team walked in single file down a dusty village path. At a nod fromthe head tracker, Wallach and Clark veered off into the tangle of acacia thornwith dry twigs and fallen leaves crackling underfoot. As the sun rose higher,the constant drone of the “Christmas bees” added their shrieking to the team’snoise. The combination of the throbbing background noise of the insects and thelights distortion by the rising heat waves began playing on the teams now tirednerves until they were almost hallucinating—they expected to see a rhino behindeach bush.Eventually they found the three rhinos dozing, a large bull standing and a cowand calf lying down. The animals were ahead and to their left, and so far wereunaware that they had been discovered. Clark was in a good position to dart thebull, so without hesitation he took his shot.The unexpected slap of the dart caused the bull to back into the cow. She stoodup with a start, agitated by the bull’s clumsiness and bad manners. Clark thendarted her in the shoulder with the calf’s dose in hopes of slowing her down. Assoon as Wallach saw the dart hit the cow he stepped forward and darted the cowwith the second calf dose. However, the dart struck her at a bad angle andglanced off of her rump and just added speed to her exit.They cast about looking for the bull’s tracks for a few moments, but gave up inthe maze of gravel and dry leaves. They returned to the vehicles, where Wallachfilled another dart with a calf’s dose of M-99. He gave Clark the adult dart,and they set off back into the bush. After trotting a mile to the north, one ofthe horsemen clattered up loudly, skidded to a stop in a cloud of dust, andexcitedly yelled to them that the bull was down. He was told to return to thebull immediately and guard it lest the horn hunters would find him and take theopportunity to chop his horn off while the rhino was in his helpless state.The second horseman arrived in a lather just as the first was leaving and toldWallach and Clark that the cow was leaning against a tree about two miles away!The team headed for the cow first, and when they arrived they found her down onher brisket immobilized, but not completely unconscious. The team attached arope to a rear leg and anchored her to a nearby tree. It was then a simplematter to immobilize the calf as it would not leave its mothers side.By chance, a lone bull emerged unannounced from the bush, which Wallach handilydarted. By 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon they had four rhinos down in areasonably small area.The lorry crew literally had to hack roads through the tangle of twisted thornso the lorry could be backed up to the bull that Clark had originally darted.After administering the M-99 antagonist it took an unusually long hour to urgehim into the crate.While the lorry was off to drop the first animal inside the Umfolozi fence, thecow stood up. She swayed at the end of her tether like a drunken sailor,requiring Wallach to give her a second dose of the drug cocktail with a handsyringe. The horsemen were sitting on their steeds and lazily watching the cowgo down, and had momentarily taken their eyes off of the calf as Wallach turnedto pull the dart out of the calf. As he did, she jumped up and caught thedistracted scouts flat footed, but the alert horses jerked them to safety justin time. The calf was given additional drugs to settle her down and everybodysmiled.While waiting for the lorry to return, the local tribesmen had turned out inforce to watch the rhino show as it unfolded. One of the grateful headmenbrought the team a pot of tea with goat’s milk and coarse sugar. The welcomerefreshment was served in an ancient set of china given to one of the chiefs byan English queen. The visitors all sat around Wallach and Clark, laughing andclapping while the recipients of the gifts were unceremoniously bolting thesteaming brew.The lorry returned and the cow was leveraged into the crate. The crew manhandledthe sweating calf into the bed of the Land Rover and tied it down with a net andheavy ropes. Shortly the cow and calf were off-loaded into the Umfolozi, andwere left to their own devices grazing aimlessly together in their euphoricstate.When the team returned to the darting area for the last bull, they found itimpossible to locate any suitable place for a road to be cut because of a heavyrock outcropping and several large trees. The team voted unanimously for a planthat would walk the rhino a half mile down a dry riverbed that was handy to thenearest road where they could have the crate already on the ground and ready.While Moses left with the lorry to get the crate in position on the road,Wallach and Clark took a thirty-foot long 3/8 inch hemp rope and a fifty foot1/2 inch nylon rope and headed back to the rhino. A loop was made in the nylonrope and placed around the rhino’s head behind the posterior horn. The hemp ropewas tied to his left rear leg as a drag line.The team was able to bring the blinking rhino to his feet without any antidotesince he had been down for five hours, and the drugs were by then wearing off.With hearty shouts and vigorous slaps behind the ears, they drove him thefifteen yards to the river bed. The team had to use long limbs ripped off oftrees to leverage him down a three foot embankment into the loose sand of thedry riverbed. He crumpled into the dry river in a heap. After recovering hislegs, he started walking in the wrong direction, so the team had to redirect himby pulling on his tail and leg rope.With six men pulling, and three behind acting as anchor men or prodders as thesituation required, he was moved down the river the one half mile to the roadfor loading in about an hour. The roughest part was yet to come. The oldgentleman was now quickly regaining his faculties and more vigorously resistingour guidance, and they had yet to get him back up the riverbank and into thenarrow opening of the crate.The team hauled the lead rope through the crate and out the front center holeand anchored it to the axel of the lorry. On signal the team prodded and worriedthe bull with shouts until he lumbered up the bank under his own power and intothe sanctuary of the crate to escape his tormentors.Before the team was able to react quickly enough to latch the rear door behindhim, and before the lorry was pulled forward to collect the slack in the headrope, he suddenly backed up, snapping the nylon lead at the axel as though itwere fishing line. He quickly retreated, pulling the six straining Zulu laborersholding the rope up against the front of the crate like so many grass seedsslipped off of the stem. After a brief moment of pandemonium, Wallach and Clarkcollected and organized the team enough and pushed the bellowing giant back intothe crate.After two hard, record-breaking days, the lorry crew was now exhausted. Theyfell dangerously silent, so Wallach had Moses struck up a singsong chant tostart the sullen crew into making some noise. After a few well-told jokes abouttheir mothers-in-law, they were soon laughing again. Wallach and Clark pitchedin and helped to pick up the heavy ends of the loading rollers, which no doubthelped to boost their fading spirits.The team happily let the bull lose in the reserve and made it back to the OgomeStation, just after full darkness. After unloading their personal gear andcapture equipment, they found that Daniels and his wife Pat had returned fromtheir Durban holiday with her sister. Everyone traded stories and had a gloriousdinner of stuffed wildebeeste heart, mealie porridge, and beer. The talking wenton into the morning, sharing details of the capture teams record breaking twodays in the Palumbo location with particular emphasis on the places where therhinos were released into Daniels’ Ogome area of responsibility.Daniels’ sister-in-law wanted to go along in the morning and they agreed to takeher only after she promised to bring along water, oranges and soft drinks. Atthat point the capture team retired to bed and oblivion.While Pat and her sister cooked breakfast, Wallach cleaned and lubricated thecapture guns and cleaned, boiled darts and replaced bent dart needles. Wallachand Clark had gotten up late and it had taken several hours to gather up andreorganize gear and collect Daniels’ sister-in-law and the laborers so the teamarrived at the Palumbo store only after 11:30 A.M.The impeccably uniformed headman was patiently waiting for them as usual on theveranda of the store. He reported that his trackers had spotted three rhinolying up where they had darted their first rhino two days earlier.After one hour of unproductive creeping about in the bush with the infernal“Christmas bees” screeching in their ears, they learned from one game scout thatthe local teenagers had thought that rhino catching had looked like such greatfun that they had tried their rhino hunting skills and had chased the rhinos offwith their dogs.Frustrated, the team climbed into the vehicles and started to drive to theopposite end of the Palumbo location, hoping to head off the fleeing rhino.After a short drive the team came upon a lone bull standing in the shade of asmall thorn bush just off the track about three hundred yards ahead. Wallachsignaled for the vehicles to stop and he motioned to Moses to shut off thelorry. Clark and Wallach both loaded and cocked their capture guns and stalkedto within twenty-five yards of the bull before he sensed their presence.There was a large clump of brush between Wallach, Clark, and the rhino. Theyflipped a coin and decided that if the bull chose to go to the right, Wallachwould take the shot and if the bull took off to the left, Clark would take theshot. After a two minute appraisal of us the bull curled his tail over his backand took off to the right. Wallach took the shot, hitting the trotting bull justbehind the shoulder.The bull continued on at a rapid pace, and it was obvious they would not be ableto keep up with on foot, so they opted to wait at the vehicles until thehorsemen had done their job. After an hour the first horseman on his sweatingand puffing horse, reporting that he had found the bull grazing in a clearing,but the dart had fallen out and the bull was showing no signs of having gottenany of the drugs.The team was discouraged. Wallach began to set things up again to find anotheranimal when the second horseman showed up at a hard gallop with a differentreport. He yelled that he had spotted the darted bull with the dart still in itabout four miles away (the first rider had apparently had stumbled onto yetanother animal). The horseman related that the bull was still standing and whenhe had dismounted and had tried to put an anchor rope around its rear leg it hadgiven him a half-hearted charge.The team jumped into the vehicles and since they knew the location of the rhinothey took a short cut. The bull had made two right hand turns to lose the firstrider!After arriving at the described location, there was some loud confusion aboutwhich thicket the bull had been discovered in, so the team back-tracked thehorse in order to find the rhino. They came upon the bull lying down in a patchof sparse bush, although he did not look like a typically drugged animal as hewas alertly moving his ears to chase off flies and catch danger signals.Wallach loaded another dart, and they approached the bull. When they got towithin an arm’s reach Wallach slapped the bull on the rump. The response wasimmediate and loud. The startled rhino, the dart still embedded in its shoulder,clambered to its feet, roaring. For a moment he was confused as to which way torun, turning first to the left and then to the right. Wallach held off dartinghim because at that short range the dart would have exploded on impact and therhino would surely recognize the direction of his antagonist!One game scout wanted to put Daniels’s sister-in-law in safety up a dead treewith low limbs easy for climbing, but she chose another and it was good she did,because as the rhino bolted off, he bowled over the dead tree she had beeninstructed to climb, reducing it to a heap of dust and splinters. As the bullreached the other side of the clearing, Wallach aimed and fired his dart at thecenter of the rhino’s disappearing rear where he would be hit if he zigged orzagged.The bull chose to go straight, so the dart struck him dead center right at thebase of the tail. The animal stopped in the far thicket and turned to look backinto the clearing. In about five minutes he began goose-stepping and wanderedback into the open. Wallach and Clark leaned against a tree and waited for thedrugs to take their course. After he crossed the clearing they realized that itwould be faster loading if he were headed into the clearing instead of into thebush, so with a bit of heaving, tail pulling and grunting the bull was turnedinto proper position just as he crashed heavily to the ground.As he hit the ground, the bull’s personal swarm of flies left him and tried asample of human blood before taking off again in search of the more favorableenvironment of another rhino.Wallach pulled out the original dart for examination and found that it had afaulty detonator and had failed to discharge! The horseman had tried to put arope around the leg of an exhausted, indignant, and surprised rhino and, it wasconsidered fortunate for the scout that he was able to ride off unscathed. Ifthe animal had been a black rhino, the odds were greater that he would have beeninjured because black rhinos typically deliver a more aggressive and moresustained charge than a white rhino. They continued to be impressed with themild nature of the white rhino.The capture team had set two records in three days. Five rhinos had been caughtand transported in a single day with one lorry, and ten rhinos had been caughtand transported in three days with one lorry. The ten rhinos at Palumbo safaribecame a legend!The Umfolozi capture team had reached a high degree of skill and efficiency andthey could be expected to comply with any order given to save the white rhino.It was a sad fact that there were nine hundred white rhinos in the UmfoloziReserve and the surrounding locations that had gravitated to the protectedzones. Moving rhinos from the locations into the Umfolozi kept the neighborshappy, but that process didn’t relieve the population pressure that threatenedthe very survival of the entire sanctuary.The results of the annual census for the white rhino population in theUmfolozi-Hluhluwe complex dealt the Natal Park’s staff a numbing blow. Despitethe capture and transport of nearly three hundred white rhinos over a three-yearperiod, the population had swelled to an unprecedented total of 912 rhinos. Itwas decision time. Either the excess animals had to be captured and relocated ora cropping program had to be instituted to rapidly reduce the rhinos’ feedingpressure on the veld before the next dry season.The rainless days of the dry season promised to take their toll on those animalsthat could not find water. Large populations of short grass-grazing animalswould stir up the shallow and fragile top soil, exposing the moist roots of thegrass to the drying winds. The roots of the grass burnt beyond salvage wouldspell doom to the grassy areas of the veld when the rains finally came again.They had only three months before this dry weather would begin again, so therewas little time to make detailed plans or gather equipment not already insupply.Early hunters had historically reported the presence of large numbers of whiterhino in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). However, extensive hunting for meat,trophy horn and sport, along with land clearing for crops during the pioneeryears of South Africa, had caused the white rhino population to disappear.In 1962 five young boma-trained rhino had been trucked to the Kyle Dam GameReserve in Southern Rhodesia, nearly one thousand miles to the north ofUmfolozi. If the rhino transport had been successful and the animals had adaptedto their new homeland, then they would immediately begin to move more of theovercrowded white rhino to Rhodesia. They eagerly called the Rhodesian WildlifeService to learn of the experiment’s outcome and were greatly relieved that allfive of the animals had survived and remained within the confines of the park.The one thousand mile spread between Umfolozi and Kyle Dam would seem topreclude the employment of the quick-catch-and-release method they had employedto return the stray rhino from the Palumbo native location back to the safeconfines of the Umfolozi. On the other hand, the six to eight weeks it took toboma-train each animal, would take too long to prepare one hundred rhino for thetwo day drive to Kyle Dam.By the time it took to boma-train the one hundred head of the rhino and get themshipped out, irreversible damage to the fragile Umfolozi veld would have alreadytaken its toll. The situation called for a departure from the standardprocedures now practiced if any efforts were to be of any serious value.They decided to gamble with the life of one animal to try what had beenconsidered a rash idea only a few months earlier. Wallach felt that the new drugtechnology with the M-99 cocktail had been proven enough to produce the desiredresult, which was to capture a white rhino from the bush in Umfolozi andtransport it directly to Kyle Dam. Such a move would require around-the-clockdriving to keep the crate time down to twenty four hours—and that wouldnecessitate the tranquilization of the newly captured rhino for the entire trip!Wallach awakened early in anticipation of the experimental translocation of thewhite rhino to Kyle Dam, but to his dismay there was a heavy cloud cover andsteady drizzle. Joseus, his cook heard him rattling and grumbling about theweather in the dark and set about building a wood fire so that he could have hotwater for a hot-water shave and tea. By 6:30 AM Wallach had breakfasted on somecold mealie: pop and boiled warthog prepared the night before.After shaving and packing a bag with several changes of uniforms, and hispassport, South African driver’s license, and health papers, Wallach made up afresh bottle of M-99, as there had been a plague of sudden precipitation of thedrug after putting the powder into solution.The team had decided to start the project with a young bull in the 3,500 poundrange as the initial experimental animal. Wallach didn’t want to riskexperimenting on a breeding female since there was a possibility that the animalcould perish during the operation. He prepared two darts in advance so the daywould not be lost if the shot went astray.Wallach was met by Head Ranger Steele, John Tinley, Ken Rochort, and SouthAfrican state veterinarian from Natal at the Mpila head office. The team leftimmediately in the Land Rover followed by Moses and his labor crew in theBedford lorry loaded with the gray rhino crate. They passed the Madlozi rangerstation and roused two men from their sleep to act as the horsemen for thecapture.The team was still inspecting the dampened savannah at 9:30 AM for a suitableexperimental animal. Many bulls were spotted, all too old, and with plenty ofcows with suckling calves at their gray sides. It appeared for a time that theUmfolozi Reserve was all out of 3,500 pound young males.It was still drizzling at 10:30 AM when the proper sized animal was sighted aspart of a small herd of ten rhino. The animal was in a stand of six-foot-tallgrass, so it was necessary to dart it high on the hip. Because of the slopedanatomy of the rhino’s hip, the dart hit and bounced away in a cloud of spray.It could not be discerned immediately if the spray was rainwater from therhino’s skin or the M-99 uselessly spraying from the needle after a briefcontact with the animal.The rhino briskly galloped off into the wind with the horsemen in a latheringpursuit. Wallach followed slowly, just keeping the Land Rover within sight ofthe horses so as to not drive the rhino farther than necessary.When the caravan reached him twelve minutes later, they were sure that all hadbeen lost on finding the animal down on his back, its feet paddling in the airlike a capsized destroyer with its propeller still running. This position putunnatural pressure and stresses on the rhino’s circulatory system andrespiratory system if it is maintained for any length of time. They quicklyrolled the animal onto its chest and a more natural physiological posture.The routine inspection of the animal’s vital signs indicated that the bull was ahealthy specimen and was breathing normally. The state veterinarian began hisinspection while Moses maneuvered the lorry into position for the loadingprocess. The loading proved to be an unusually long procedure, as the animal wasdown in a rather inaccessible donga with a brush-covered bank. As a result apath had to be cleared for the lorry to get into position. Then the stateveterinarian refused to issue health papers or release the rhino for shipment toRhodesia until it was covered with anti-tick grease.By noon the animal was finally in the crate and on the lorry. The young bullprobably hadn’t received the full dose of drugs as a result of the glancingimpact of the dart and as a result was already standing in the crate. He wasgoing require additional long lasting tranquilizers.The next step was to get to the Masinda Ranger Station to fill the lorry’s tankand pick up a trailer already loaded with supplies. At Masinda the trailer washitched to Rochort’s Land Rover so that five-fifty gallon drums of gasolinecould be loaded. In the back of the Land Rover they put their personalsuitcases, spare parts for the lorry, tools, and ten five-gallon cans ofgasoline for a total of 294 gallons, which included what was in the drums andthe vehicle tanks. They had to take their supply of gasoline as there would notbe any opportunity to buy any during the run to Kyle.The loading at Masinda was painfully slow. Finally at 2:00 PM the safari headedout of the reserve for the public road with Moses and Tinley in the lorry andWallach and Rochort in the Land Rover. It had started raining again and thepublic road was ten miles of a twenty-to-thirty degree incline with a quagmirecaused by the constant passing of heavy equipment over a dirt road.Both vehicles were churning through the mud sideways in four-wheel drive at asnail’s pace of five miles per hour. Thirty minutes later we reached the Hlabisahospital settlement on the summit. Wallach waved the lorry on while they stoppedat the native store to buy a case of soft drinks to go with the food packed forus by the women at the camp. They depended upon the caffeine in the soft drinksto keep them awake for the next twenty-four hours!They were soon off to catch up with the lorry, taking each muddy hill at a slowfour wheeled grind. Suddenly Wallach realized that they were going up a hillwithout having to downshift to a lower gear. They stopped and looked at the backof the Land Rover to find that the gasoline laden trailer had left them! In apanic they wheeled around and charged back over the peak to see the overturnedtrailer and the strewn gasoline drums in the depression between the last twohills. The disrupted trailer had come loose on the downgrade and plowed atwo-foot deep furrow in the muddy road for one hundred yards until it struck arock and flipped over, scattering the drums. They considered it miraculous thatthe drums hadn’t ruptured and spilled the precious contents.Rochort and Wallach levered the trailer back upright, attached the ball hitchand the chains to the Land Rover and began the process of rolling the drums backtowards the trailer. They rolled the first drum against the tailgate to use as afulcrum and then pried the remaining drums over it into their proper positionback in the trailer.By this time they were drenched in sweat from their labors. The humidity madethe air around them like a transparent sea. When they had finished reloading thetrailer and had started off again, it was 3:00 PM and now time had become theirenemy. They had gone only fifty miles since the bull had been captured, andrhino had only been kept tranquilized for four to six hours in the historictranslocation to the Kruger National Park.Five miles down the road a rear tire went flat on the Land Rover causing anotherten-minute delay. While they changed the tire they silently went through thetime schedule. They came across the lorry at the Pongola River, pulled off theroad and were out of petrol. They pumped fuel from the fifty-gallon drum intothe lorry and used a five-gallon can to fill the rover to save time.The crew was now driving through the Pongola Valley where ten months earlierWallach had worked as a Natal state veterinarian. The land was scared withirrigation ditches forming geometric patches of sugar cane fields and citrusorchards. The change of scenery was truly a pleasure for Wallach after ninemonths in the bush. By the time they crossed into the Transvaal, the northernmost province in the Republic, the sun was down and the evening winds werebeginning to build up.They continued to drive north through the Transvaal, and by some stroke of luckbecame lost only once. They lost the correct road for thirty minutes in theheavily forested central Transvaal. They soon found their way and continuednorth, grinding up the steep grades in four-wheel drive and freewheeling downwinding mountain roads to preserve precious gas supplies. The night was stillovercast and pitch black.At a little past midnight both vehicles were stopped to refuel. By now thefive-gallon cans were all empty and they were pumping fuel from the drums intoboth vehicles with a hand pump.At Loskop Dam National Park they needed to make a ninety-degree right turn;however, they were going too fast on a down-hill grade and needed to carry onfor a few miles to find a safe turn around. Reaching the high plateau, Wallachfound the landscape to be similar to that of the Big Thompson Canyon inColorado, with winding mountain roads bisecting stark vertical landscape on oneside and a precipitous drop on the other. On a level section of road theystopped again to refuel and checked on the dozing rhino.Again at 2:30 AM near Grobersdal the grades began costing a considerable amountof fuel. The rhino was lying down and resting peacefully.At 5:15 AM in the gray morning a roster-tail of orange sparks burst up frombehind the petroleum-laden Land Rover. The trailer had come loose again and thetongue was showering us with sparks as it ground along the pavement. They slowedthe rover, gradually using it as a brake and buffer for the careening trailer.They decided to pump both vehicle’s tanks full again and transfer as much fuelas possible from the drums to the five gallon cans. They then had two and onehalf drums of petrol left which were loaded into the bed of the rover. While theteam worked feverishly to deal with the fuel, the rhino became impatient in themotionless crate.The belligerent animal soon had the top boards of the crate coming loose and wasremoving great pieces of the two inch lumber away from the inside of the frontdoor of the crate with its horn. Wallach administered an additional dose oftranquilizer to the rhino and the trailer and the empty fuel drums were hiddenin the brush. They arranged for a mechanic at a nearby gas station inPotgietergrust to pick up the trailer and weld safety chains on it so it couldnot come loose on the return trip.The dehydrated and exhausted rhino became depressed following the last dose oftranquilizer and was in a deep stupor two hours later. Wallach gave the rhino ajolt of cortisone to relieve some of its physiological stress.At Potgietergust, the team picked up a main highway and quickly passed throughPietersburg and Louis Trichardt with the light from the rising sun making thedriving easier. Thirty minutes later the rhino began moving around again and thewhole team felt a great sense of relief. They hadn’t come this far only to losean animal. They passed through Wylies Port, where they stopped to refreshthemselves. After a cold water shave and some hot tea they were all runningabout laughing like school boys—they were going to make it!They reached the Rhodesian border at high noon. The sky was clear and the sunwas already high and hot, so they parked the rhino lorry in the shade of sometrees about a half mile from the border. Above them was a British propellerdriven spotter plane monitoring all of the lorries passing through the bordertown of Biet Bridge in order to track the quantity of gasoline being exportedfrom South Africa into Rhodesia. Parking the lorry under the trees created agreat curiosity for the pilots, who then began buzzing the little stand of bushin order to get a better look at the hidden vehicle.They left Moses with the vehicles and took his papers with them along to thecustoms office, where they were greeted by Jeremy Anderson, who was a gameranger from the Rhodesian Parks Department. He had formerly been a ranger forthe Natal Parks Board, so the reunion at this desolate border station was aboisterous event.Wallach’s American passport raised eyebrows since the United States was backingthe British economic sanctions against Rhodesia at this time. Wallach was givena short-term visa to cover an estimated sojourn that would find him out ofRhodesia within seventy-two hours, and he had to provide them with a detailedmap of their route of travel. Aside from the political questioning theRhodesians were quite civil and friendly. All were interested in their uniquecargo and expedited a rapid passage through customs.The safari pulled through the customs and the border gates at 12:30 PM andcrossed the Lipopo River to begin their final dash across the desolate Rhodesianbushveld during the heat of the day. Seventy miles north of the border theystopped in some shade to check the sweating rhino and took the opportunity tostretch their legs a bit. The temperature was well over 100 degrees and the heatcaused the last of the unopened soft drink bottles to explode.They continued the long trek up the Great North Road, passing the grotesque,almost unreal, baobob trees and signs that warned: “Yield—Elephant Crossing!The tarmac strip had been built during the Second World War to carry materialsfrom southern Africa to the North African theater. Elephants had pushed largesucculent baobob trees over on the side of the road in order to reach the uppertwigs and the water-filled chewy pulp.As late as 1893 there were wars at “Fort Victoria” between the Rhodesians, whowere trying to stop the powerful Matabele tribesmen from capturing the weakerMashona tribesmen and selling them to the Arabs for slaves.The team was met in Fort Vic by a Land Rover full of jubilant Rhodesian rangers,including Warden Bruce Austin, Tommy Orfitt, and “Tinky” Haslam who were goingto care for the rhino after the offloading.In another half-hour, twenty-eight hours after leaving Umfolozi, they arrived atLake Kyle with an exhausted but very much alive rhino!The rangers at Kyle had several log bomas prepared so the new arrivals could beobserved and monitored for any adverse effects of the trip. The rhino crateswere hauled off of the lorry by means of a chain come-along with round polesunder the crate to act as rollers as it was pulled ever so slowly along. Thebomas contained hay and fresh cut grass plus a concrete water trough. After theyopened the crate, the hesitant rhino walked out and around the pen a few times.It drank heavily; then it laid down with a deep sigh. The animal appeared to beas relieved as we were to have completed the journey.They then went to Tommy Orfitt’s house for a beer on the veranda and had theoperator ring the telegraph office to signal the official “success” telegram. Itwas an extremely beautiful evening as they happily watched the Rhodesian sunseton Lake Kyle. Their journey had come to a successful conclusion—they proved thatthe White rhino could be saved!!Safaris into Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to deliver wild and boma-trainedwhite rhino to Kyle Dam Game Reserve and the Wankie National Park became asteady stream, and Operation Rhino turned into Rhino Express, the legend and thebook.While in Rhodesia, Wallach was invited to join in the elephant immobilizationprojects designed for marking and cold branding to study elephant population andmigration dynamics. The large elephant population in Wankie National Park washeaded for a calamity because civilization and intensive agriculture wereencroaching upon them from all sides.Historically, the annual elephant migration gave the park four months to recoverduring the rainy season; however, man and his enterprises encircled the parkwith claims to the ancient elephant roads resulting in the end of themigrations. Overgrazing and heavy browsing stripped the grass veld and the bushbare. The day of the elephant was over. Certain doom was on the horizon for theelephant. No one wanted them since they were neither rare nor endangered, andthey were considered a destructive obstacle to progress.The Rhodesians didn’t have the money, trained personnel, the immobilizingequipment, drugs, or vehicles to bring Operation Elephant to fruition. Wallachpromised that he would find all that was needed to in fact bring OperationElephant to a reality, and over a period of several years he visited Rhodesiaand personally delivered Operation Elephant."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENTHE CENTER FOR THE BIOLOGY OF NATURAL SYSTEMSAs Aristotle walked wondering through his great zoological garden, he becameconvinced that the infinite variety of life could be arranged in a continuousseries in which each link would be almost indistinguishable from the next. Inall respects, whether in structure, or mode of life, or reproduction andrearing, or sensation and feeling, there are minute gradations and progressionsfrom the lowest organisms to the highest. At the bottom of the scale we canscarcely divide the living from the “dead”; “nature makes so gradual atransition from the inanimate to the animate kingdom that the boundary lineswhich separate them are indistinct and doubtful”; and perhaps a degree of lifeexists even in the inorganic. Again, many species cannot with certainty becalled plants or animals. And as in these lower organisms it is almostimpossible at times to assign them to their proper genus and species, so similarare they; so in every order of life the continuity of gradations and differencesis as remarkable as the diversity of functions and forms. But in the midst ofthis bewildering richness of structures certain things stand out convincingly:that life has grown steadily in complexity and in power; that intelligence hasprogressed in correlation with complexity of structure and mobility of form;that there has been an increasing specialization of function, and a continuouscentralization of physiological control.—Will DurantThe Story of Philosophy:The Lives and Opinions of the World’s Great PhilosophersIn the Spring of 1966 Wallach’s mentor, Marlin Perkins, director of the St.Louis Zoo and star of the Mutual of Omaha Wild Kingdom television show, sent atelegram inviting Wallach to move on from the Operation Rhino project in SouthAfrica and return to the United States and join him in a large NIH sponsoredresearch project.Perkins, along with Barry Commoner, who was an environmentalist, a formerpresidential candidate for the Independent Party, and a professor and the headof the Department of Biology at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri,had gotten a $7.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to studythe world ecology, the environment, and the impact of pollution on the plant,animal, and human populations of the world.The program was to combine the facilities of Washington University’s biologydepartment, the Shaw’s Botanical Gardens in St. Louis County, and the St. LouisZoological Gardens into a new university department to be known as The Centerfor the Biology of Natural Systems.Wallach pondered the invitation for about a week and initially responded with apolite thank-you but no thank-you response, which was placed on top of themantel for mailing. A month later he realized that the letter was still there.It hadn’t been mailed!Wallach reread the letter and then tore it up. Hadn’t he stated that “He woulddo anything to work with Marlin Perkins?” When he was first hired as a kid towork with the elephant barn in the St. Louis Zoo? Perkins had personally writtenthe invitation, and he was not the sort of man you could turn down, and hepromised that we would be working with a larger variety of animal species andhumans!At Perkin’s direction, Wallach was appointed to the project as a post-doctoralfellow in comparative pathology and comparative medicine at The Center for theBiology of Natural Systems. He was given an office in the zoo hospital, afully-equipped and staffed pathology laboratory, and an autopsy facility with awalk-in cooler and an electric hoist on an overhead track for lifting and movingthe larger animals. There were knives, cleavers, axes, saws, and sample bottlesfilled with formaldehyde waiting to be filled. The laboratory equipped formicrobiology, parasitology, blood and tissue chemistry, and preparation ofhistopathological slides had light microscopes and access to electronmicroscopes, photography equipment, scales, and x-ray facilities. The facilitiesand tools were all-too familiar.Wallach’s liaisons at the zoo were Moody Lentz the General Curator, RobertFrueh, assistant curator of mammals, Charlie Hoessle, assistant curator ofreptiles and Mike Flieg, curator of birds. Wallach’s advisor and supervisor forhuman pathology and autopsies was Dr. Malcom Peterson, a human pathologist atthe Barnes Hospital, a teaching hospital at Washington University School ofMedicine just down the street from the zoo.The elements, mechanics, and investigation of animal pathology were the same asthe elements, mechanics, and investigation of human pathology. The skull andbody cavities are opened up with knives, saws, and bone shears so that thecentral nervous system and the internal organs could be viewed, weighed, andsamples taken for microbiology, parasitology, chemistry, and histopathologyexaminations.Extra effort had to be taken to prevent blood, body fluids, or urine fromsplashing into one’s eyes, nose, or mouth. The human pathologist has to bedoubly careful to prevent cutting or sticking himself with an instrument or bonesplinter to avoid inoculating himself with a potentially deadly organism.The human pathologist looks for pneumonia, trauma, ruptured aneurysms, bloodclots, perforating gastric ulcers, heart attacks, cancer, and maybe will do achemical or drug screen if the clinical record suggests the need or litigationmight be involved. The human pathologist limits the data in the pathology reportto the size and color of the organs, gross findings (trauma, etc.), and a “causeof death.”The human pathologist never lists the nutritional deficiency that causes birthdefects, aneurysms, diabetes, arthritis, blood clots, heart attacks, cancer,Alzheimer’s, or even osteoporosis. As a result of this systematic omission ofcritical information clinical nutrition has never advanced. Wallach’sresponsibilities included changing this huge oversight.Twenty to thirty postdoctoral fellows were attached to the “Center” at any giventime. They were an eclectic “think-tank” of graduate students that includedbotanists, biologists, environmental engineers, biochemists, computer experts,water experts, geneticists, geologists, anthropologists, astronomers,meteorologists, and Wallach, the comparative pathologist. To solve problemsquickly without each specialist redoing another’s research that had already beencompleted, each team member was obligated to learn the scientific language ofthe other disciplines represented at the center. Time was too short for delaysthat might be caused by semantics. After all, there was an environmental crisisin the world and the members of the center were specifically chosen to identifyand solve the looming world problems and literally save the earth!While at the center, Wallach continued his graduate studies at WashingtonUniversity in the subjects of comparative pathology, subcellular biology,molecular biology, the genome, biochemistry, and pollution. New tools includedthe electron microscope, and Wallach could now look at cellular structures atmagnifications of 126,000 times. He could see chromosomes, the double helix, andinternal structures of the mitochondria, including inclusion bodies and the RNAinner membranes!Wallach was now able to see what had been postulated by the early philosophers,Epicurius, Darwin, Mendel, Pauling, Watson and Crick, and others.Wallach visited with Dr. Malcom Peterson, pathologist at Barnes Hospital,Washington University two to three times weekly, respectfully gleaning throughfull human autopsies, worked through the autopsy reports, the preserved tissues,slide sets, and the chemistries from each autopsy performed at Barnes hospitaland from autopsy materials sent in from other teaching hospitals.Dr. Peterson was particularly interested in clinical problems and the pathologyreports from nonhuman primates at the zoo, so he was given a call when anyclinical procedure or autopsy was carried out on a primate. They had manydiscussions regarding the identical nature of the anatomy, physiology,biochemistry, and pathology of humans and nonhuman primates. It was agreed thatcertainly we and they are brothers and sisters!Wallach was also responsible for performing complete autopsies on all animalsthat died in the St. Louis Zoo and also on frozen animals and specimens sent inby other participating zoos. These autopsies including gross pathology,histopathology, chemical screens for pollution, nutritional status, hair andtissue analysis, reviewing the clinical records of each human and animalspecimen, as well as a complete recording of their diets, supplement program,and their list of over-the-counter and prescribed pharmaceuticals. The goal wasto identify pollution and environmental problems and monitor percentages of“genetic” diseases and nutritional deficiencies.The command was “Find a sensitive animal or several species that could be usedas a modern day ‘Canary in the mine.’” Find a species that could act as an earlywarning system for an impending environmental collapse, much as the legendaryWelsh coal miners had used caged canaries to warn them of the presence of minegasses that could suffocate them or explode.Wallach did complete autopsies on every snake, fish, alligator, turtle, parrot,duck, pigeon, ostrich, kangaroo, wombat, puma, African lion, zebra, antelope,llama, fox, wolf, pig, monkey, hippo, rhino, ape, seal, and walrus that died inthe St. Louis zoo and its sister zoos in North America. Dr. Peterson and Wallachwould then compare the causes of death in the zoo animals with similar oridentical diseases in the humans who lived and then died in close proximity tothe zoo. Initially they were only looking for deaths for which there was somerelationship to pollution.The first revelation that Wallach was confronted with was that theresponsibility for the zoo animal’s dietary supplement programs were notcontrolled by any central authority. No one with any nutritional training wasresponsible. If an animal or group of animals were a curator’s pet project, theygot lots of attention and close scrutiny regarding its nutritional program.Animals that weren’t that exciting or part of a herd or flock might have itsdiet regime left to the whim and decision of an individual animal keeper who mayhave had a love for animals but only a 9th grade or high school education andcertainly no serious training in animal nutrition.Some animal keepers concocted homemade vitamin-mineral supplements for theircharges by grinding up pills and capsules designed as multivitamins for kids oradult humans. Many zoo keepers applied the advice of their own personal doctorto the animals that were in their charge; they falsely believed that theiranimals could get all of their required vitamins, minerals, amino acids, andessential fatty acids by simply eating “high quality” food. As a result of thissimplistic and sloppy approach zoo animals developed all of thenutritional-deficiency diseases that can plague domestic animals, free rangingwild animals, and humans. The nutritional health of zoo animals was a calamitythat had already happened!Although the stated universal goal of all zoological parks was to protect andpropagate endangered species, the high rate of nutritional-deficiency diseasesWallach found in zoos proved there was some major pieces missing in the pursuitof that goal. Wallach saw marmosets, alligators, and shrews that died of type 2diabetes caused by a simple mineral deficiency (lack of chromium and vanadium).He autopsied dozens of alligators and their cousins. The cayman, a small threefoot long cousin to the alligator, had died of a global steatitis (a form ofsystemic cellulite) that were the result of eating a high-oil (fish) diet wherethe oils had oxidized, and which when combined with a vitamin E and seleniumnutritional deficiency had caused death.He also autopsied hatchling ostriches and aoudads (wild African sheep) that haddied of muscular dystrophy (from a deficiency of vitamin E and selenium), and herecorded many wild sheep, llamas, greater kudus, pheasants, and monkeys that haddied of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a selenium deficiency). He found pheasants,ostriches, gorillas, and squirrel monkeys that had died of ruptured aneurysms(caused by a copper deficiency), and there were lions, wolves, foxes, raccoons,woolly monkeys, alligators, iguanas, parrots who had reared baby animals of allkinds that had died of the manifestations and complications of osteoporosis suchas fractures, kidney stones and cystic calculi, and nutritional secondaryhyperparathyroidism (from a calcium and magnesium deficiency).There was severe calcified arteriosclerosis in the coronary arteries and aortasof vegetarian species, such as pheasants, parrots, kangaroos, aoudads,antelopes, and primates (from consumption of oxidized oils in stored grains incombination with a magnesium deficiency and a shortage of antioxidants). Alsoosteoarthritis was a universal disease found in all species, including iguanas,ducks, flamingos, pheasants, sheep, llamas, monkeys, rhinos, and kangaroos(caused by calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and trace-mineral deficiencies).Wallach saw a constant stream of congenital birth defects that could be directlyattributed to nutritional deficiencies in the mother prior to and during herpregnancy: cerebral palsy in a llama (from a copper and zinc deficiency); spinabifida in a monkey (from a folic acid and/or zinc deficiency); cleft palates inarctic foxes (from a vitamin A and or a zinc deficiency); a ventricular septalheart defect in a kangaroo (from a congenital vitamin A and or a zincdeficiency).Diets were re-evaluated. Vitamins, minerals, and trace minerals were calculatedand adjusted for body weight to prevent disease and promote fertility and normalfull-term pregnancies with perfect young. Sometimes Wallach could use existingcommercial animal feeds, a concept that initially horrified just about everymember of the zoo’s senior staff, who would think, “These are exotic animals.How could commercial diets for domesticated animals apply to them?” As a base tostart with there were rabbit pellets for kangaroos and wombats; dog food forbears, foxes and wolves; laboratory monkey biscuits for marmosets, monkeys,baboons, and apes; turkey pellets for pheasants; duck pellets for ducks, swans,and geese; turkey pellets and horse pellets for ostriches, rhea and emu; horsepellets for zebras, hippos, rhinos, and elephants; and sheep and cattle pelletsfor antelopes, llamas, bison, and wild sheep and goats.More complicated diets were put together from dog food designed for toy dogs.Cat food and laboratory mouse pellets were put together for shrews, marmosets,and iguanas. Large reptiles including snakes, alligators, and tortoises hadwhole rats or fish stuffed with cat food and multivitamins according to bodyweight.There were two pet projects that Perkins wanted to get started immediately whenWallach arrived. The first was a tissue bank of frozen and preserved tissues andorgans of rare and endangered species that could provide invaluableirreplaceable material to investigators who were studying the anatomy,anthropology, biochemistry, genetics, and pathology of certain rare species. Thesecond was to figure out the cause of liver cancer in bears housed in zoosthroughout the world.Wallach consulted with other zoos, universities, the National ScienceFoundation, and the National Institutes of Health as a member of the NIH sitevisit committee that approved or disapproved funding for research being donewith exotic species as the animal model.Wallach was the founder of the Journal of Zoo Animal Medicine as a naturalprogression of his research, so that other zoos would quickly benefit from newlyacquired information. He remained the journal’s Editor-in-Chief for three yearsuntil he passed on the responsibility to the other zoo veterinarians that hadmore time, because his responsibilities with The Center for the Biology ofNatural Systems were growing. All involved believed that time was short.Wallach was now living on airplanes, traveling as a featured speaker at medical,veterinary, and university centers and zoos, as well as at nutritional seminars.Along the way he worked for and consulted with the world’s foremost zoos,including zoos and aquariums in the Bronx, Chicago, Denver, Detroit,Jacksonville, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Madison, Memphis, Miami, Milwaukee, St.Louis, San Diego, Topeka, Tucson, Washington, DC, and overseas. Hisresponsibilities reached to London, Frankfort, Tel Aviv, New Deli, and Zurich,to name a few.BEAR LIVER CANCER MYSTERYPerkins’s project about prevalent liver cancer in captive bears was the firstproactive study that Wallach immersed himself in. Why did free-ranging wildbears live to be forty-five years of age with a nearly zero rate of cancer, andin contrast to them almost 100% of all captive zoo bears, worldwide, died ofliver cancer by the time they were thirty years old? Liver cancer in captivebears was not a unique problem of American zoos. This liver cancer issue was aglobal problem of all zoos from all industrialized nations throughout the world!Wallach remembered that in 1958 just about every turkey raised in America forthe annual Thanksgiving celebration died of liver cancer. It was a bad year forsoy beans, so feed manufacturers imported peanut meal from Nigeria by the boatload to provide some of the protein needed to meet the grower’s specificationsfor their turkey rearing feed. It turned out that the peanut meal wascontaminated by an overgrowth of Aspergillus spp. fungi.Aspergillus is a common bread mold. However, under certain circumstances itproduces an exotoxin called aflatoxin, which in large doses causes a suddendeath from liver necrosis (liver death). In low doses the aflatoxin produces avery specific type of liver cancer—the same type of liver cancer that plaguedthe captive bear populations in the world’s zoos! Where were the captive zoobears getting the aflatoxin?Wallach made phone calls and sent letters asking what were these animals fed,what they were supplemented with, where the zoos were located in relationship toindustrial and nuclear power facilities, and what the liver cancer rate was inthe human population who lived in close proximity to the zoos.It turns out that each year the directors and curators of all of the major zoosof the world come together for an annual meeting to share information. Smallspecies of bears weigh 300 to 500 pounds; large species of bears can weigh wellover 1,000 pounds, and that is a lot of animal to feed. So zoos learned fromeach other that a bear, being an omnivorous species, could be provided a lot ofcalories by feeding them moldy bread from bakery thrift stores. One slice ofbread provided 110 calories, a loaf of bread might contain 1,500 calories ormore, and a loaf of moldy bread cost only five cents! So around the world themessage went out—that a zoo could maintain large bears without having to breaktheir budget by feeding moldy bread and a few frozen fish!While waiting for return letters from the other zoos, Wallach went to the zookeepers in St. Louis that cared for the bear moats and inquired about theirfeeding program. As expected. it was “old bread” and some fish—the universalrecipe! Wallach ran back to the zoo hospital and grabbed the “black light,” a UVlight that would cause ring worm skin infestations and other fungi and molds tofluoresce.Wallach ran back to the bear grotto and asked the bear keeper to show him wherethe “old bread” was stored, and he turned out the lights and flashed the blacklight on the bread through the cellophane wrapper. The loaf of bread fluorescedlike a disco! The cause of the bears’ liver cancer was the aflatoxin in themoldy bread!The next day, within two weeks of arriving at The Center for the Biology ofNatural Systems in St. Louis, Wallach had solved the twenty-year mystery of bearliver cancers in zoos all over the world! He switched the bears’ diets frommoldy bread to dry dog food, and the problem ended almost overnight. Letterswere sent and calls were made to the major zoos of the world. It was done! Theliver cancer plague of zoo bears had been conquered—the first of many victoriesto be credited to the center!After spending twelve-plus years performing complete autopsies on 17,500 animalsof over 454 species, and 3,000 human autopsies for a comparison, the bottom linelearned was that “every animal and every human who dies of ‘natural causes’ diesof a nutritional-deficiency disease!”The autopsy results for man and beast were so obvious and so profound that theyscreamed out the answer to the question “Is pollution a major factor in humandisease?”—which was that the current level of background environmental pollutionwas not our immediate concern. Apparently our bodies had a capacity to fend offor work around low levels of pollution.Therefore our immediate concerns were nutritional deficiencies and theself-destruction inflicted by eating too many fried and overcooked (burnt) foodsby the overuse of dietary oils, including margarines, salad dressings, cookingoils, as well as the consumption of canned fish packed in oils and processedmeats preserved with nitrates and nitrites—all of which increased the daily loadof dietary trans fatty acids, heterocyclic amines, and acrylamides!Certainly when major industrial accidents, catastrophic spills, train andhighway accidents, and acts of terrorism occur, the pollution surge that followscan present a significant negative impact on the humans and animals in theimmediate locality, but not on the continent and not on the world.WHY ARE THE EARTH’S OCEANS DYING?One of the concerns we at the Center were supposed to investigate was: “Why werethe oceans dying and why were the populations of plankton, fish, and other seacreatures diminishing? Was pollution a factor?”We started out with “Where does the ocean get its food?” The answer was veryquickly provided. Wallach, having become an expert in the areas of agriculturalnutrition and, in particular, mineral nutrition, immediately came up with thetheory that somehow the ocean’s source of dietary minerals (silt) had beenreduced, and simultaneously he came up with the theory. He shouted, “The oceansare dying because we have dammed up all of the major rivers. We havesystematically cut off the oceans food supply by putting a ligature on the flowof silt (minerals) into the oceans!”Prior to man’s systematic damming of the rivers of the earth, it is estimatedthat some twenty-seven billion tons of mineral-rich river sediments (silt)poured into the oceans annually. Today, this historically massive food supplyhas been reduce to a mere trickle by human intervention.A second food supply for the oceans of the world comes from volcanic eruptionsand dust storms. Each year a cubic mile of minerals and rock dust are blown intothe air; however, this source is variable depending on each year’s rainfall.Rainy years produce less dust and conversely drought produces more dust.The question, “Why are the oceans dying?” was asked and answered. However, mostof the world (including the biologist at the center) was hell-bent on solving aproblem that didn’t exist. Everyone “believed that pollution was the problem.”The human biomass is puny compared with the oceans volume and collective biomassbecause oceans, like humans, have the capacity to neutralize even what we wouldconsider significant pollution.image [../images/00003.jpeg]The basic functions of life itself cannot be performed without the presence ofoptimal amounts of minerals, either as a major part of a functional recipe, astructural building block, and/or a catalytic cofactor necessary to facilitate achemical or enzymatic reaction. No biological process is exempt. This fact holdstrue for RNA, DNA, chromosomes, subcellular and digestive enzymes, biochemicalreactions, vitamin function, hormone functions, energy use, and even our abilityto utilize oxygen: nothing in a living system will work without mineralcofactors.We determined that minerals and mineral supplements to our meals were just asnecessary to humans as they were for pet animals, laboratory animals, farmanimals, free-ranging wild animals, and captive zoo species. These supplementprograms are a necessity for a long and healthful, disease-free life for wecould not get these nutrients from food no matter how well one ate, no matterhow spiritually elevated one was. The fact is that man needs to supplement withall of the 90 essential nutrients and, in particular, the 60 essential minerals!Since before recorded history, man craved and consciously consumed minerals fromvarious sources, including the major minerals, trace minerals, and rare earthsthat also come from various sources: clay, salt, and animal tissues (such asbones, cartilage, liver, and skin), colloidal mineral rice plant material, andwood ashes (containing plant minerals). Simply said, minerals are the currencyof life, and the medical system ignores this truth to the point of absurdity.The Center for the Biology of Natural Systems encouraged publication of findingsthat had resulted from our studies and research. Wallach alone publishedseventy-five peer-reviewed and refereed journal articles and contributed morethan fifteen chapters in eight multi-author textbooks that were the directresults of his comparative pathology and nutritional research.Wallach was also a member of the ad hoc committee of the National ScienceFoundation that authored the Animal Welfare Act of 1968. The act, which wasquickly voted on passed by the U.S. Congress, required that a laboratory animalveterinarian be in charge of the laboratory facility and implementing the law toensure proper care of the animals and the integrity of the experiment. It alsooutlined the specific nutritional and housing requirements for laboratoryanimals and captive zoo animals. The medical system which had ignored the basicprecepts of animal research was now aware of Wallach.Animal laboratories in medical environments were notoriously abused by themedical doctors who were the lead investigators. The animals might not be fed orwatered for days or weeks at a time, which resulted in under-dosing problemswhen investigating pharmaceuticals and nutrients, and in worst cases the animalscannibalized each other while the doctors “created” data to support theirtheories and the goals of the study.As a direct result of Wallach’s nutritional work at the center, many species ofrare animals including the Giant Panda that had not successfully reproduced incaptivity, were now becoming a glut on the market, and healthy zoo animal babiesof every species were appearing everywhere! A second advantage of this turn ofevents was that the pressure to capture wild animals every year to replace thosezoo animals that had died every year in captivity ended! The market that had forhundreds of years (and in some cases thousands of years) encouraged illegalhunters and poachers to catch and sell rare animals to zoos, wild animal parks,and traveling animal shows dried up which the indirectly contributed to thesurvival of many marginal animal populations!Another direct result of Wallach’s comparative pathology and nutritionalresearch was that several of the leading animal-feed companies, includingRalston Purina and Hill’s Packing Company, created special commercial canned anddry diets and feeds for zoo animals and captive wild species. The immediatepayoff was that the fertility of captive zoo animals was more consistent, fromthe smallest of municipal zoos to the largest and more sophisticated zoologicalparks. Birth defects were eliminated, and endangered species lived longer andhealthier without the development of degenerative diseases."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENTHE 150-YEAR UPDATE ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIESIn the eighteen-fifties evolution was in the air. Spencer expressed the idea,long before Darwin, in an essay on “The Development Hypothesis” (1852), and inhis Principles of Psychology (1855). In 1858 Darwin and Wallace read theirfamous papers before the Linnaean Society; and in 1859 the Old World, as thegood bishops thought, crashed to pieces with the publication of the Origin ofSpecies. Here was no mere vague notion of evolution, of higher species evolvingsomehow from lower ones; but a detailed and richly documented theory of theactual mode and process of evolution “by means of natural selection, orpreservation of favored races in the struggle for life.” In one decade all theworld was talking about evolution. What lifted Spencer to the crest of this waveof thought was the clarity of mind which suggested the application of theevolution idea to every field of study, and the range of mind which broughtalmost all knowledge to pay tribute to his theory.As mathematics had dominated philosophy in the seventeenth century, giving tothe world Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibnitz and Pascal; and as psychology hadwritten philosophy in Berkely and Hume and Condillac and Kant; so in thenineteenth century, in Schelling and Schopenhauer, in Spencer and Nietzsche andBergson, biology was the background of philosophic thought. In each case theepochal ideas were the piece-meal production of separate men, more ore lessobscure; but the ideas are attached to the men who coordinated and clarifiedthem, as the New World took the name of Amerigo Vespucci because he drew a map.Herbert Spencer was the Vespucci of the age of Darwin, and something of itsColumbus too.—Will DurantThe Story of Philosophy:The Lives and Opinions of the World’s Great PhilosophersWallach went back to Rhodesia three times for a month each to set up and monitorOperation Elephant. Initially adult male elephants were immobilized and “coldbranded” to determine migration routes and territories. Two foot by one footcopper bar numbers were created and attached to two-foot long iron handles inthe classical branding iron configuration. They would pick up liquid nitrogen ata rail head that had been delivered to out in the bush. The elephant wasselected and immobilized and then the numbered end of the “branding iron” wasplaced in the ten-inch deep insulated bucket of liquid nitrogen for ten minutes,dropping the iron’s temperature to minus 400 degrees.After the appropriate surfaces were cleaned of dust and mud, the super-cooledbranding iron was then pressed against the front surface of the elephant’s earand its hip for about two minutes. The purpose of the entire procedure was tokill the pigment cells in the elephant’s skin, and the resulting “brand” woulddevelop in about four weeks as the pigmented skin was lost in the natural cycleof skin maintenance. In the meantime the elephant’s number was painted on theelephant’s ear, shoulder, side, and hip with a waterproof marine epoxy. To trackthe elephant’s movements, tourists to Wankie National Park were given a surveyand asked to help with the project “Operation Elephant” by recording where theelephant was spotted. Its identification number was recorded as well as what itwas doing. The public loved the participation in the project and always turnedin their surveys and observation at the gate when they exited the park.By Wallach’s third visit to Rhodesia for the continuation and expansion ofOperation Elephant, the immobilization and branding process became so routinethat only one ranger, Jeremy Anderson, would accompany Wallach with a shot gunjust to scare off the herd if they were slow in moving away from the downedelephant.On one particular day the now two-man team, Wallach and Anderson, immobilized asix-thousand-pound cow out of a small herd, branded her, and applied the whiteepoxy marine paint. After about fifteen minutes of taking measurements, bloodsamples, and collecting a bottle full of ticks, the antidote was administeredintravenously, and the two men walked fifty yards away, squatted down, andwaited for the cow to jump up and run back to the comfort of her herd.The antidote typically took effect in thirty seconds to two minutes, but on thisday thirty minutes went by. The elephant’s respiration returned to normal, butthe cow just laid there giving no indication that she was remotely interested ingetting up.Wallach crossed the fifty yards, and flipped her giant African elephant ear backoff her face (the ear had been left in the unnatural position covering the eyeafter the antidote was injected into an ear vein) and into its normal positionagainst her neck. Immediately her dilated pupil constricted and she focused herleft eye on Wallach. She lurched up on her chest, now staring at Wallach withboth eyes in a squinted “death stare.”Wallach now began to run backwards through the loose sand as fast as he could.After he had covered twenty yards, the cow got to her feet, put her head down,curled her trunk under her chin, and charged as fast as she could at Wallach.Suddenly there was a shotgun blast! Wallach’s uniform shirt was ripped off andhe felt like he had been shot with rock salt in his back. The enraged cow cameto a full stop, looked at her right foot, shook her foot, then turned and ran tomeet up with her herd.Ranger Anderson had saved Wallach’s life that day by shooting the cow in thefoot with number-six bird shot—the equivalent of shooting a human in the barefoot with a BB-gun—enough to get her attention, but not enough to severelyinjure her. Wallach’s shirt had been ripped off by the shotgun blast as he wasonly two yards in front of the ranger when he pulled the trigger!While still at The Center for the Biology of Natural Systems and the St. LouisZoo, Wallach interacted almost daily with the zoos long-time clinicalveterinarian, Dr. Alfred Moller, who was in private practice in St. Louis andwas on call whenever the zoo needed him. Wallach had a lot of experience inlarge animal immobilization and anesthesia from his Africa experience, so Dr.Moller would ask him to do the anesthesia on the larger zoo animals whenever heneeded to do any procedure or surgery.OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE A “A NATIONAL TREASURE”Dr. Moller was also the clinical veterinarian for Anheiser Busch’s famousClydesdale beer-wagon team, and he began to take Wallach along to consult onhorse problems. Moller had convinced the W.B. Saunders Publishing Company that ascientific reference book covering data of every normal physiological value andthe data about disease conditions for every known animal needed to be written.W.B. Saunders is the largest and most well-respected publisher of medical,nursing, dental, and veterinary textbooks in the world, and it was considered agreat victory and asset to have them as the publisher of a great book.Originally, the book was to contain twenty-eight chapters written bytwenty-eight experts from zoos and universities. It was estimated that theproject would take five to eight years to complete. Each chapter of the book wasto focus on a specific group or classification of animals. Everything knownabout each group was to be assembled in the appropriate chapter. If importantdata was not available, the individual assigned to that chapter was supposed todesign and pursue the studies necessary to collect the necessary information.The completed tome would be the equivalent of a modern day Noah’s Ark of healthinformation, the most complete reference ever compiled on exotic animals, bothwild free-ranging individuals and captive zoo species. All of the normal blood,urine and spinal fluid values, gestation periods, recorded longevities, knowndiseases, and reported causes of death (including bacterial, viral, parasites,degenerative diseases and nutritional requirements and deficiency diseases), anddietary requirements would be featured in the book. Every known anesthesia,surgical procedure, and vaccine and pharmaceutical treatment was to be includedin each of the appropriate chapters. It was going to be a huge undertaking.As Wallach was considered to be the junior member of the project, he wasoriginally given the three chapters on insects (bees, fruit flies, andmealworms) so he immediately set to work to collect information and complete hisresponsibility as quickly as possible. He only knew what he had learned aboutthe insects in zoology and entomology in agricultural school. Undaunted, heimmediately did a library search for everything known about them. Within amonth, Wallach was an expert on the nutrition, diseases, DNA, genetics, and thelife cycles of bees, fruit flies, and meal worms. He then dutifully set about towrite his assigned chapters.In 1965 word processors and personal computers didn’t exist, so Wallach startedwith the standard black Underwood upright typewriter, a ream of 81/2 by 11 whitebond paper, and a bottle of “White-out.” Many paragraphs and tables were typed,whited-out, cut, pasted, and repasted. Quarts of correction whiteout wereemployed. The mechanics of writing in those days were slow and tedious, but hewas on a mission and his cup was half full, not half empty.All of the anointed authors were invited and assembled in the Philadelphiapenthouse belonging to W. B. Saunders to officially kick off the book project,and to give direction and deadlines to the contributing authors. The publisherprovided a project editor, Carroll Cann, who was to be assigned to guide theproject forward and keep it on the rails. Editor Cann chaired the meeting, andthe assembled would-be contributors were appropriately wined and dined and giventhe VIP tour of the publishing facility.Cann warned the assembled contributors that over the years some of the assembledwould fall short and never finish their part of the project. Some would fallill, some would die, some would get divorces, and some would simply quit becauseof the mental fatigue related to the enormity of the book project before it wascompleted. But Cann stated, “Finish it, we will!” They entire assemblage cheeredand applauded.Six months into the project, Wallach received a call from Moller, saying thatone of the original contributors had already quit, and would Wallach please takeover the project of the chapter on fish. Saying a yes, Wallach did the necessaryliterature research in various libraries. Within a month he was an expert on thediseases, parasites, anesthesia, environmental requirements, nutritionalrequirements, and the reproductive cycles of tropical fish and farmed food fish.Every flat surface in Wallach’s house was covered with paper, reprints,journals, monographs, reference books, along with Wallach’s personal pathologydata from the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems and the early drafts ofchapters. Finishing his assigned chapters became an obsession that drove him dayand night seven days each week.By then there were three small Wallachs (Jessica, Jennifer, and Steve) runninggleefully through the house negotiating the now six-foot tall stacks of paperthat had created a rat’s warren–like maze.Some months later, the scenario repeated itself, and Wallach was asked to writethe chapter on waterfowl. The tried and true process was again repeated. Wallachdid the research and collected what was known and published on the normallaboratory values, diseases, parasites, nutritional requirements, andreproduction of domestic and wild waterfowl, plus he added his own pathology andnutritional data on waterfowl. The creation of each chapter for the book wasattacked in the same manner that course work was attacked in agriculturalschool, veterinary school, and graduate school: “If the system ain’t broke,don’t fix it!”CURING THE ARCTIC FOXES’ “GENETIC” BIRTH DEFECTS AT CHICAGO BROOKFIELD ZOOAbout halfway through the development and production of the book, Wallach wasoffered the position of pathologist of the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. It wouldbe a jump from a fifty-acre zoo with an animal population of 2,500 animals to a200-acre zoo with an animal population of 4,500 animals. The pay was double atthe Brookfield Zoo, and the hospital and research facilities were considerablylarger and more advanced. So with Perkins’ and the Center’s blessing Wallachaccepted the position and moved his part of The Center for the Biology ofNatural Systems to Chicago.The real factor in Wallach’s decision to move his efforts to Chicago was thepresence of five trained bottle-nosed dolphins that were displayed and performedin the 250,000 gallon salt water tank at the Brookfield zoo. Just down the roadwas the Lincoln Park Zoo (the zoo where Perkins had gotten his start as a zoodirector and a TV icon on Zoo Parade) and the Shedd Aquarium, which displayedfresh water dolphins, a world-class fish and marine animal collection, and acomplete reference library on marine mammal and fish nutrition and diseases.Wallach arrived at the Brookfield Zoo to learn that the full-time clinicalveterinarian, Weaver Williamson, had been severely mauled by a large malechimpanzee. From his first day, Wallach had to double as a clinical veterinarianas well as the pathologist.Wallach wasn’t even totally unpacked and moved into his new hospital office yetwhen he was confronted by the two PhD biologists sharing the office. They asked,“Do you know anything about genetics?” With a knowing smile, Wallach responded,“I know the basics of genetics; however, I wouldn’t consider myself an expert.”In reality, Wallach was quite the expert in genetics as a result of his trainingin agricultural school, veterinary school, and his postdoctoral studies incomparative medicine and comparative pathology.As the conversation progressed, they shared that they were getting ready to goto Alaska to capture several wild Arctic foxes so as to bring back “wild genes”to introduce into their pair of Arctic foxes that had bad genes. For the lastfive years in a row the zoo’s captive pair of zoo-born Arctic foxes had producedfive smaller than normal litters with 100 percent fatal birth defects.Arctic foxes typically produce litters of ten to fifteen kits. This pair borelitters with only three to five kits. Some of the litters were born dead, andsome were born alive, but some that were alive had hydrocephalus, others wereborn eyeless, and some were born with devastating diaphragmatic hernias. Thelast litter only had three kits and they all had cleft palates.The biologists believed that the parent foxes were from incompatible gene pools,and that the only way to solve the problem was to organize a major expedition tothe Arctic to catch wild Arctic foxes and introduce “wild genes” back into thezoo’s breeding pair of foxes.After an hour of listening to the biologist’s theories, Wallach knew that thatthe foxes’ problems were the result of congenital nutritional deficienciesrather than a genetic problem. Naively, Wallach finally offered, “You’re inluck: your fox problem is not a gene problem.” Looking like they had just beenslapped in the face with a decomposed fish, the two biologist fired right back,“How do you know? You’re admittedly not an expert in genetics. You’ve justarrived, and you haven’t even looked at the foxes, nor have you done any tests!”Wallach’s response was, “If there was a genetic problem the birth defects in thekits in each litter would be the same litter after litter and year after year.In your foxes’ case, each litter had different birth defects than the otherlitters. It is very obvious that the problem was a nutritional deficiency in themother during early pregnancy. These are congenital birth defects, not geneticdefects!” Of course, they chuckled and responded, “That’s the most absurd thingwe have ever heard.”Wallach’s next comment was to ask for the “defective” foxes to be moved to thezoo hospital for tests and observation. After all, “They wouldn’t want thesepoor, pitiful, genetically-defective specimens on display, would they?” Theyimmediately ran out of the hospital, boxed up the foxes and brought them up thehill to the hospital, and officially signed them over to Wallach.Investigating the diets of the foxes, Wallach learned that their basic diet forthe last five years had been ground horse heart “sprinkled daily” with apowdered vitamin mineral mix at the discretion of the keeper. The exact amountsof vitamins and minerals delivered to the foxes were highly variable; sometimesthey were given too much, and sometimes they were given too little, andsometimes they were not given any. Each day’s dose depended on how the keeper’sfootball team fared or whether or not he had a “bad hair day.”Wallach went to the grocery store, bought some off-the-shelf dog food formulatedfor toy dogs and began to feed the pair of foxes. Four months later, theyproduced a normal litter of eleven kits. Within the year, Wallach inbred themother to her sons, the father to a daughter, and brothers to sisters. If therewas a genetic defect and a defective gene pool, the intense inbreeding wouldbring it out into the open. All of the resultant litters were healthy and normaland each had ten to fifteen kits.There were so many Arctic foxes from two years of inbreeding that they werebeing shifted to every zoo building. The zoo curators developed a specialdisplay of Artic foxes that featured the various color phases, and they beggedWallach not to pull the same stunt with elephants, but the two biologists thatstarted the whole adventure in science said nothing.SAVING FRESHWATER DOLPHINS AND SOLVING NUTRITION-DEFICIENCY DISEASES FOR MANYZOO SPECIESOn day one of Wallach’s arrival, he received a call from the Shedd Aquarium,from a curator who asked if he could please come over and look at a deadfreshwater dolphin. When he looked at the dolphin it was surprisingly small whencompared with the bottlenosed dolphins he dealt with at the Brookfield Zoo. Assoon as he opened the dolphin up he knew immediately what the problem was—theanimal’s heart was enlarged. Instead of its being the size of a navel orange, itwas the size of a basketball, and its thoracic and abdominal cavities werefilled with gallons of a clear fluid.On questioning the aquarium staff, Wallach learned that the dolphin hadn’t feltwell for months, and they had given it antibiotic capsules in some of its foodfish. Wallach learned that the aquarium procured three to five freshwaterdolphins each year for the previous ten years. By the end of the year, they hadall died, and they would get a new group each spring.The dolphins were fed exclusively whole-frozen lake smelt, and as they werebeing fed whole fish no vitamins or minerals were being added to their diets.Wallach determined that each year the freshwater dolphins had all died ofcongestive heart failure from a classic deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Itturns out that the flesh of lake smelt contains an enzyme called thiaminase thatdestroys all thiamine, and as there was no supplementation to replace the lossthe congestive heart failure was inevitable. It was a perfect storm for theproduction of congestive heart failure.The solution to the Shedd Aquarium’s freshwater dolphin problem was to replacethe whole-frozen lake smelt diet with another thiaminase-free whole fish, andstuff the fish’s belly cavities with a multiple vitamin and mega doses ofvitamin B1. The aquarium followed Wallach’s recommendations and the annualdeath-watch of the freshwater dolphins ended.The work on the book continued. If there were no normal blood values availablefor Siberian Ibex, a type of wild goat, Wallach would enlist the help of thezoo’s curators and catch the zoo’s flock of twenty-one animals. Using hisround-up skills learned on Angus, Hereford, and shorthorn calves, Wallach caughtthem one by one using a lariat. They were weighed, identified, and tagged forthe curators, and then blood samples were taken and the results added to thebook’s database. An original article was produced that was published in apeer-review journal; the data and reference was used in the book and theBrookfield Zoo got a feather in its cap for the original study that wouldbenefit all zoos and wild animal parks that exhibited ibex.The ibex adventure was repeated with Dahl sheep, havalinas, monkeys of alltypes, bears, kangaroos, wallabies, pheasants, parrots, ostrich, snakes,turtles, and even fish. Wallach felt like he was the veterinarian for Noah andthe animals on his Ark.The autopsies continued to show the same pattern of nutritional-deficiencydiseases that Wallach had observed in the St. Louis Zoo, and which was alsoevident at the Brookfield zoo, the Lincoln Park Zoo, and the Shedd Aquarium. Allanimals dying of what would be considered by most to be genetic or naturalcauses actually died of nutritional-deficiency diseases. For example, kidneystones in tortoises and iguanas were universal problems. The standard zoo dietsfor tortoises and iguanas were based on fruit, eggs, raw meat or fish, andlettuce with no addition of vitamins or minerals—certainly no calcium was added.Where did the calcium come from that was in the tortoise and iguana kidneystones? It came from the bones of the iguana and the skeleton and shell of thetortoise when they didn’t enough calcium in their diet and they had ragingosteoporosis! The fact that kidney stones developed as the result of too littlecalcium in the diet was well documented in domestic animals, so it was easy tofind appropriate refereed references for another journal article and for thebook.By this time Wallach was on a roll. He rarely was confronted with a disease hehadn’t seen before; however, he saw lots of familiar diseases in differentanimal species he hadn’t seen before. Selenium deficiency, calcium deficiency,copper deficiency, zinc deficiency, magnesium deficiency, and iodinedeficiencies were common. Vitamin and protein deficiencies were less common,although birth defects resulting from a myriad of nutritional deficiencies werequite common. The clinical symptoms, and the gross and the microscopic-autopsysigns, and the biochemical fingerprints of nutritional deficiencies in snakes,fish, alligators, ostrich, wombat, yak, African lion, wolf, ibex, Dahl sheep,llama, dolphin, and humans were the same!The completeness and value of any theory depends on the number and accuracy ofthe facts one assembles to arrive at those conclusions. Darwin, the naturalist,arrived at his controversial theories of evolution and natural selection whileon an unprecedented five-year continuous world journey, as he was island andcontinent hopping on the H.M.S. Beagle. No one before him had personallyobserved the contiguous stream of facts necessary to see the truth of theconcept of natural selection.Prior to Wallach’s nutrition and comparative pathology studies in thousands ofcaptive and free-ranging wild species and humans, no single individual trainedin comparative pathology and comparative medicine had studied the degenerativediseases from so many different species of animals from all over the world andcompared the results with information on diseases of human beings with thesingle directive: “find the useful life-saving common threads.”Wallach found the “useful life-saving common threads” and wove them into thetight fabric of an unimpeachable truth. This truth is that every animal andevery human being that dies of natural causes and what are thought to begenetically-transmitted diseases, dies of nutritional-deficiency diseases! Thescientific and religious communities of the time didn’t embrace Darwin’s theorybecause they didn’t have the world vision that he had, and the medical systemdidn’t accept Wallach’s truth because they didn’t have the $7.5 million worth oftraining (which over time actually grew to $25 million) that he had benefitedfrom. Doctors and scientists in general are not stupid, and Wallach was not anysmarter than they were. They were, however, ignorant of all of the facts andtherefore they were universally unable to see the truth—it was simply impossiblefor them to read or speak the language!WORK ON “THE BOOK” ESCALATESWork on now what was being called “the book” continued. Wallach took a leave ofabsence from the Brookfield Zoo and spent three weeks of isolation in Hawaiientering four years of accumulated data into the book. The project was beginningto take shape; by this time all but two chapters of the book had wound up inWallach’s lap. What he didn’t know from personal experience and research,Wallach gleaned from published articles in veterinary journals, wildlifejournals, zoo records, and laboratory animal journals.The two co-authors still left in the book project were responsible for thechapters on caged birds and reptiles. The one who was asked to write the chapteron caged birds had a busy private practice specializing in caged birds, and hepromised the material but never completed it. The other remaining co-author wasa veterinarian and an MD who taught public health at Harvard Medical School. Hisclaim to fame of his knowledge of exotic animals was that he had once written anarticle on “An Ameobic Infection in a Komodo Dragon.” The article wasn’t exactlyabout Komodo Dragon Dysentery, but you get the picture.The MD, being extremely arrogant, wanted half of the book royalties “to lend hisname to the project,” even though he would contribute only one chapter out oftwenty eight. When the doctor threatened to quit the project if he didn’t getfifty percent of the royalties, Carroll Cann, the project editor at W.B.Saunders told him to “jump in the lake!” The contract he had signed onlyentitled him to royalties based on his percentage of contributions to the book.Obviously Wallach wound up with the chapters on caged birds and reptiles, andnow “the book” became an obsession.WORKING WITH PRIMATES AT YERKES PRIMATE RESEARCH CENTER: PROOF OF THE CAUSE OFCYSTIC FIBROSIS IN HUMANS AND PRIMATESAfter four years at the Brookfield Zoo, Wallach moved on to the Yerkes RegionalPrimate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia. The primate center was administeredby Emory University and funded by private donations and a variety of agenciesincluding the NIH and NASA. Physically the center was located across the streetfrom the Centers for Disease Control (the federal agency that tracks humandisease and deaths), a dream location for a comparative pathologist.The researchers, that Wallach supported, used a variety of New World and OldWorld monkeys, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans for their studies andresearch animals for projects in nutrition, pharmacology, breeding colonies, andbehavioral studies. Sometimes the animals were killed at the end of the project,and sometimes they died from the effects of the drugs or nutritionaldeficiencies, and sometimes they died of natural causes.Wallach’s responsibility was to help the investigator to know everythingpossible about their primates and their diet—and if necessary—determine theanimal’s cause of death. Nutritional deficiencies in monkeys, and great apeswere of special interest because of their close relationship to humans.The basic diet of the Yerkes primates was a complete, commercially-prepared“monkey biscuit.” The monkey biscuits contained what was thought to be optimumlevels of vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, amino acids, and essential fattyacids known to be required by monkeys and apes. This information had beengathered by literally thousands of basic nutrition studies in laboratoryprimates.The basic diet of monkey biscuits was supplemented with cabbage, citrus fruit,bananas, alfalfa hay, spinach, ground meat, onions, beets, nuts, carrots, eggs,and rolled oats, not necessarily for extra nutrition, but rather fromanthropomorphism. The keepers couldn’t imagine themselves eating the same boringbiscuits for every meal, so they gave the primates these human foods for“variety” and to keep the caged primates busy browsing. The add-on treats wereoften times sprayed with salt water or a trace mineral salt block was wired tothe outside of the cage where it could be licked.Nutritional studies in primates were done by creating special pelleted dietsthat had one or more nutrients missing so as to be able to map out the varioussigns, symptoms, and diseases that were produced from the deficient diet. In theearly days of zoos and primate laboratories, bone pathology such as osteomalaciain young primates and osteoporosis in adult primates, was commonplace as theirdiets were almost exclusively grains, vegetables, and fruit with little or noregard for their need for vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and essential fattyacids. The advent of commercial “monkey biscuits” pretty much eliminated thebone and joint problems in modern zoos and primate colonies unless deficiencydiseases were being purposely created for research purposes.There were as many as ten to twenty-five pathology cases per day at the Yerkesfacility. We looked for viruses, bacteria, parasites, degenerative diseases,nutritional deficiencies, and complications of surgical interventions and sideeffects of drug studies. Microscopic slides were made of all tissues and organs,chemical analysis was performed on all blood, urine, and spinal fluids, andsamples were collected for viral, bacterial, fungal cultures, and parasitestudies.The ultimate goal at Yerkes was to find and develop an animal model for thestudy of some human disease in hopes of producing a prevention or cure. A realadvantage of Yerkes proximity to the Centers for Disease Control was theopportunity to attend their weekly pathology study programs for human diseases.The world’s experts on these diseases provided “unknown” cases that came withhistories, microscopic slides, and sometimes lab results. In many of the casesthe slides were made with standard stains, and each participant was given a weekto figure out what the disease was.At the presentation, the attendees, including Wallach, played the game of “pinthe label on the disease.” Presenters would produce a review of the clinicalhistory and the pathology results, and special stains were employed forhistopathological slides to make the specific diagnosis of the unknown mysterydisease. It was a unique opportunity for Wallach to advance his knowledge ofhuman disease and hone his techniques on how to diagnose them.Those pathologists who had made the correct diagnosis became all excited andpumped. They made victory signs and performed victory dances like footballplayers who had scored a touchdown, claiming “I knew it, I knew it!” The rest,dejected, would responded with, “I was going to say that but I changed my mind,”or “it had me baffled from the beginning.” What the exercise did for everyone,of course, was to hone their diagnostic skills, so that regardless of theirexhilaration or disappointment, all emerged winners at the end of the day. Thisweekly challenge went on for several years, and at each successive meetingWallach’s Sherlockian deduction skills became sharper and sharper. The truth wasgetting clearer. “It was elementary, my dear Watson”: When an animal or humandies of natural causes, they die of a nutritional-deficiency disease.WALLACH MAKES A STUNNING MEDICAL DISCOVERYParasites were the specialty of Dr. Harold McClure, the chief pathologist at theYerkes Regional Primate Research Center. He was Wallach’s immediate supervisorand he’d been at Yerkes for fifteen years. To keep things fair between twopublished scientists, they had an agreement. Whoever made an unusual or excitingdiscovery would be the primary author of a resulting mutual effort. Thatunderstanding would soon be tested.After Wallach had gotten into the swing of his responsibilities and the Yerkesactivities, Dr. McClure went on vacation for two weeks in November of 1977. Thatin of itself should have been sufficient warning. Back at the University ofMissouri, when Dr. Kintner, Wallach’s pathology professor, went on vacation, thedead and dying appeared in droves from every direction. Dr. McClure was not gonethree days when a six-month-old rhesus monkey was presented for autopsy.On the first look, the baby rhesus had snow-white hair color instead of thenormal gray-green, and it was half the normal size for its age and suffered froma severe anemia. It was not part of any particular experiment, but rather waspart of a breeding colony that was used to produce monkeys for NASA spaceprojects. Wallach checked the monkey into the system and began to go through thestandard routine. The infant monkey was weighed, measured, and identified by itstattoo number. Blood and urine samples were collected for cultures andbiochemical analysis. Every organ and tissue was examined for color, texture,weight, size and location, and tissue samples were taken and preserved forhistopathology examination. Stomach and intestinal contents were collected forcultures of bacteria and viruses and were chemically analyzed for toxins.Anemia made the tissues and organs small and pale. The gross physical changes ofthe monkey’s pancreas were immediately notable, which made it more interestingthan the other internal organs. Not only was the pancreas small and pale—it wasround and knobby in cross section instead of flat, and it was as hard as a rockinstead of having the expected normal consistency of raw chicken.As the knife was used to cut through the pancreas, it produced a noise like youwould expect from running a knife through packed dry sand, and also theprocedure created a gritty resistance. More samples of the pancreas were takenfor microscopic examination and special stains. Twenty-four hours later thetrays with the prepared and stained slides were on Wallach’s desk ready to beread. The pancreas, liver, heart, and lungs showed changes he had never seenbefore.Wallach made notes and ran to the library and had the computer pull all of thearticles that could be related in any way to such changes in animals. He wasliterally swamped with hundreds of articles that described a trace-mineraldeficiency. All of the tissue changes in the monkey were compatible with aglobal selenium deficiency!The next was habit. Since the days of working with The Center for the Biology ofNatural Systems in St. Louis, Wallach would always cross reference diseases fromtwo points of view: animal pathology and human pathology. We would be looking atthe same diseases but talking in different languages!Veterinary pathology terms for a disease were typically descriptions of thetissue changes themselves. Human pathology terms for a disease tended to be thename of the first person to describe and publish the observations, or they mightbe related to the clinical manifestations of the disease. Wallach entered thequestion of selenium deficiency into the human computer software and came upwith a big fat zero—no matter how he asked the question the answer was still azero. It was like not having the correct password to get into the program.Before working at Yerkes, Wallach had unearthed all of his references and hadpreviously performed basic research by hand. The process was time consuming, butvery accurate and effective, so he went back to the basics he understood andwent to work. He went to the medical libraries at the Grady Memorial teachinghospital and the CDC and began to look up all of the human diseases of thepancreas, liver, heart, and lungs. The results, as expected, were concise andpredictable in each of the texts: cancer, emphysema, cirrhosis, pancreatitis,cystic fibrosis, and heart failure.Wallach scanned through a dozen different texts before he just thought of givingup. He was frustrated and tired of seeing the same short paragraph writtenalmost word for word in every text under the bold heading “cystic fibrosis ofthe pancreas.” The text went on to describe it as “the most common geneticdisease, the genes for which were found in one out of four Americans.” Accordingto the literature, this disease was transmitted by a “simple Mendelian geneticdefect.” The child born with cystic fibrosis failed to thrive and produced apositive “sweat test,” a test the reference books referred to as a “geneticmarker.” If the child survived for a few years they would typically develop lungdisease, and they usually died before the age of twelve.Within the veterinary literature, the remarks describing cystic fibrosis wereterse and taken from the same exact medical reference source that said “cysticfibrosis did not occur in animals and that an animal model did not yet exist.”Wallach’s investigation began to pick up speed and intensity—he smelled blood!He knew he had a winner, and that at the very least he had found an animalmodel. However, deep in his heart he knew he had stumbled onto the firstrecorded non-human case of cystic fibrosis in an animal—and not toosurprisingly, the animal was a primate.Wallach asked the computer for every reference on cystic fibrosis and receivedthousands of articles and book references. There were photographs of wholeorgans and photomicrographs of the specific diagnostic features of the cellularchanges of cystic fibrosis in the pancreas, liver, and heart. And then therewere the typical terminal changes in the lungs of the children. The changes inall of the organs and tissues of the rhesus monkey were identical to the cysticfibrosis changes in humans—in fact they were dead ringers!The next logical step was to take a deep breath, sit down quietly, and gothrough sets of information and log the matches to cross match the microscopicfeatures and tissue chemistry of cystic fibrosis against the microscopicfeatures and tissue chemistry of a laboratory induced selenium deficiency.Houston, we have a match—Bingo!Time stood still; Wallach had no idea how long he had been there. All he couldremember was being so immersed in what he was doing that an express train couldhave passed two feet away from him and through the library at eighty miles perhour and he would not have noticed. He just sat there, his mind racing crazily,papers and slides all around him with some on the table, some on the floor, andthey all added up to the same conclusion: the rhesus monkey did in fact have aselenium deficiency and did in fact have cystic fibrosis—they were the samedisease!Great moments in which scientific truths are first uncovered and recognized aredifficult to describe for two reasons. First they occur so rarely that few getmuch practice at such lonely but certainly exciting events. Secondly, it is notalways possible to isolate the precise moment of discovery when the mindachieves lucidity, the “eureka” or the “ah-ha” moment! Sometimes, discovery justflows gradually like water filling a tank. Other times discovery strikessuddenly but still takes a while to assume coherence and blossom into awareness,making the precise moment of realization tricky to define.The more he looked, the more Wallach saw the same pattern—congenital andneonatal selenium deficiency in animals equaled cystic fibrosis in humans. Nowhe had a great dilemma: what to do. First he had to pinch himself to make surehe hadn’t made a mistake out of eagerness, and go through the whole thing againand again just to make sure.It didn’t take long for Wallach to realize that his biggest problem would be toprove the accuracy of his discovery to the holders of the genetic theory. Afterall, their entire life and future was vested in cystic fibrosis being genetic.What would be the most successful approach to engage and convince people whowere considered experts in the clinical, pathology, chemistry, and “genetics” ofcystic fibrosis that there was now an answer that could totally prevent and savemany thousands of children who were currently suffering from cystic fibrosis.How could he get them to grasp that cystic fibrosis was a congenital deficiencyof selenium and not a genetic disease? How could Wallach get them to listen andnot tersely respond with, “No, that is not possible, everyone knows that cysticfibrosis is a genetic disease that is only found in humans” before he got fivewords out of his mouth? His first major hurdle would be to get a serious hearingin front of informed but objective listeners who had no axe to grind.Keeping a low profile and feigning ignorance, Wallach made quiet, discreteinquiries. He contacted the surgical pathology board at the Grady MemorialHospital, the teaching hospital for Emory University. He told them that hewanted to present a set of slides to them with the tissues from a six-month-old,anemic, failure to thrive infant. Wallach didn’t dare mention the word monkey.Dressed in surgical scrubs and armed with the appropriate slides of the pancreasin question in the generic unlabeled cardboard slide holder, Wallach presentedhimself at the appointed hour to the board’s conference room the following day.He had twelve sets and made sure that the slides presented all had the classicalidentifying features of cystic fibrosis, which he hoped would save time andavoid the types of debate that he had witnessed at the CDC Thursday nightsessions.The twelve members of the surgical pathology board view frozen slides collectedduring surgery and determine whether the pancreas, lung, breast, prostate,colon, testicle, etc. is cancerous—“Yes, that’s cancerous, take it out” or “No,the tissue is non-malignant.” Wallach asked the board if they would please keeptheir findings confidential, and they agreed. Wallach handed the twelve sets ofslides over to the head of the committee. Eleven out of twelve wrote theiropinions on a small form, and they all agreed, “Cancer of an unknown origin.”Wallach was dumbstruck! These expert pathologist should have at least gotten thetissue identified, as he had made doubly sure that each slide had an Islet ofLangerhans, the identifying feature of a pancreas, the cells in the pancreasthat produce insulin.The last of the twelve pathologist sat quietly pondering for a moment (he hadrecognized Wallach from the Thursday night CDC pathology meetings), then heoffered, “I think I know what you’re getting at! You think this is cysticfibrosis don’t you?” Wallach, now excited, nodded his head in the affirmative.The pathologist asked if the tissue was animal or human, and Wallach remindedthem that they had agreed on confidentiality. After they all reaffirmed theiragreement, Wallach then revealed that in fact the tissues were those of aninfant rhesus monkey that he believed had cystic fibrosis.The sympathetic pathologist pulled a pathology book off of a shelf and flippedthrough it to the section on cystic fibrosis. There were only five or sixparagraphs under the heading of cystic fibrosis that ended with, “No animalmodel is known.” The pathology committee all agreed that Wallach was going tohave a hard row to hoe to get confirmation of the diagnosis by the appropriatepeople. Wallach replied, “There has to be a first someday, and I believe this isit.” The helpful pathologist replied by telling him that, “There is a cysticfibrosis expert, Dr. Victor Nasar, in the pediatric department here at Grady whohas the capacity and ability to confirm your suspicion. If you like, I’ll send aset of your slides down to him.”The slides were delivered as promised, and the next day Wallach received thecall, “Dr. Wallach, this is Dr. Nasar. I had a good look at those slides thatyou sent me yesterday.” Naturally Wallach asked what he thought. “Oh, no doubtabout it! Cystic fibrosis if I ever saw it!” Wallach responded with, “Are yousure?”Dr. Nasar came back with, “Absolutely positive.” When Wallach asked, “would heput that in writing, he responded, “Absolutely! And seeing as your just learningabout cystic fibrosis I’ll bring over a lot of CF material that I have here:slides, wet tissue, current journal articles, that sort of thing so you can havea look, say about noon?” Wallach replied, “Noon it is—and please don’t forgetyour confirmation letter.”Dr. Nasar arrived at the appointed hour, and Wallach had to fight his emotionsto stay calm. As soon as Wallach had Dr. Nasar’s letter in his hand he read iteven before the pleasantries of saying hello. They sat down at the microscopeand Nasar looked at the lungs, liver, heart, and more slides of the pancreas. Hewas obviously curious and then asked Wallach, a veterinarian, where he hadgotten the CF tissues; he wondered how a veterinary pathologist had gotten aholdof human cystic fibrosis tissue for an evaluation.Again Wallach asked for confidentiality, which Nasar agreed to, before Wallachrevealed the staggering truth. “Dr. Nasar, you’re looking at the first non-humancase of cystic fibrosis.” Probably not too many people have heard theexpression, “A stunned mullet.” The mullet is not a very excitable or excitingfish to begin with. A mullet that has been thumped on the head is pretty dull.Dr. Nasar’s first reaction was to lean back in his chair, with his mouth openand beads of sweat beginning to breakout on his forehead, and it seemed likeforever before he spoke.“You’re kidding me?” Dr. Nasar blurted out with a gasp. Wallach assured him thathe was dead serious and that he had done his due diligence. He said, “Here letme see those slides again!”Wallach had Nasar’s letter of confirmation in his hand and he was now underextreme pressure. Even with the revelation that the tissues were those of arhesus monkey, the second look resulted in the same conclusion: cystic fibrosis.Tissue doesn’t lie. Tissue doesn’t have a political agenda. “There’s no doubtabout it!” he confirmed, “Nothing else in the world looks like cystic fibrosis!This is cystic fibrosis! I’ll stake my career, my life on it!” Then his tonechanged, he looked into Wallach’s eyes and asked, “What animal is it?” Then whenWallach revealed that it was the tissues of a rhesus monkey. “Man! You’ve justidentified the first non-human case of cystic fibrosis! This is exciting! Whereis your phone?”Wallach asked whom they were calling and Nasar responded, “The Cystic FibrosisFoundation! It’s just down the street!” The next day the Yerkes lab was crawlingwith CF experts from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. They even called theexecutive director who was fishing in Canada. He cut his vacation short and hewas on his way back. They all marveled at the miracle beneath the lenses. Theynever asked the ultimate question, so Wallach never offered the answer. Theexperts were all unanimous in their opinion: “the tissues they looked at were infact classical examples of cystic fibrosis!”To make sure, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation sent a set of the monkey tissueslides to Dr. E.H. Oppenheimer, considered the world’s expert on cystic fibrosispathology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.For good measure a second set was sent to Dr. J.R. Esterly, one of her formerpathology PhD students, who was now a pathologist at the Chicago Lying-inHospital. Not a word was mentioned that the origin of the tissue was a rhesusmonkey. The only information sent with the tissue was that the material wasfrom,“ a six-month-old, anemic, failure to thrive infant,” and a note that said,“We think these tissues are cystic fibrosis, what do you think?”As sure as God made little green apples, the proclamation from on high was:“Without a doubt—cystic fibrosis!” It was all there in black and white on theirdepartment letterhead. The world’s experts had reviewed the slides and confirmedthat the tissues were without a doubt cystic fibrosis. Wallach reread thecommunications looking for any hint of waffling or weakness, but there was none.The journey had begun. The authorities had agreed and signed their agreementwith the diagnosis .History had just been made; however, as of yet the knowledge of “the Discovery”was confined to a few people. It was a totally strange, surreal situation forWallach and still fraught with danger . . . what should have been the highenergy locker-room fanfare, the high-fiving and press-release hysteria was inreality a muffled acknowledgment. This demeanor signaled to Wallach that therewere still more hurdles and that the process was still in the beginning stages.He could not appear to be moving too fast, ruffle feathers, or seem too cocky.Great egos of professors of state, national, and international fame wereinvolved, and everyone was already positioning themselves.It was as if Wallach had started at the end rather than at the beginning. Inreality all he had was a naked fact. He had identified the first non-human caseof cystic fibrosis; however, it stood in total isolation. Wallach was carrying apiece of dynamite around in his head. He dared not move too fast, drop it, orallow it to pass into the wrong hands, at least until he was ready. That was thekey, not until he was ready. There was no accompanying information, nodocumented history, no source of reference, not anything. Before Wallach movedforward he would have to fill in all of the blanks.Why did this particular monkey get cystic fibrosis? That was the million-dollarquestion that no one had asked. Everybody “knew” that cystic fibrosis was agenetic disease and classically only described in humans. How then did anon-human primate “develop” cystic fibrosis? Where did the monkey come from? Howdid it get to Yerkes? Wallach didn’t have far to travel. The monkey had beenpart of a group of virus-free laboratory raised rhesus monkeys being raised forthe NASA space program. Dr. Nelly Golarz de Bourne, a behaviorist, wassupervising the colony. She was also the wife of Dr. Geoffrey H. Bourne, ananatomist and the director of the Yerkes Primate Center.There were fifteen pairs of adult rhesus monkeys kept in small cages. The ideawas to have a steady supply of normal, virus-free, captive-reared rhesus monkeysfor the space program. When the babies reached six months of age they wereweaned from their mother and raised in a large gang cage with other “teen-aged”monkeys. When they reached maturity they would be paired up to produceadditional captive-reared, virus-free normal monkeys.The ideal was rarely achieved in a primate colony. In addition to having theadvantage of being able to demand sexual favors in the confines of a small cage,the males pulled the hair off of the females, gnawed on them, beat them up, andgenerally inflicted mayhem upon them. In the wild setting there would typicallya troop of ten to fifty females and six or so males of different ages and levelsof dominance. In the wild setting only the dominant males were allowed to breedthe females, and if the female wanted to resist she could object to the malesadvances and escape the unwanted courtship. In the tight cage, containing only apair put together by an arranged marriage was another matter.Dr. Nelly de Bourne noted the hair loss and baldness of the females. Shemisinterpreted the phenomenon as an essential fatty-acid deficiency and decidedthat each of the monkeys should be given the daily dose of one teaspoon of cornoil in addition to their standard free-choice monkey biscuits. Why, she shouldhave asked, if they were all on the same diet, did the males sport a grand haircoat and mane while the females looked ratty and bald? Shouldn’t the samedeficiency of essential fatty acids afflict both the males and the females?There was no questioning her actions here, but Nelly was the director’s wife andwhatever she said was law.The new directive gave the animal technicians who fed and cared for the colony amajor increase in responsibility. Overloaded already, there was no way thatthese technicians could have implemented this new policy. There was no way theycould go from cage to cage, squeezing each monkey’s mouth open to deliver ameasured dose of corn oil into the mouth of a resisting, squirming adult monkey.It sounds simple enough to just manhandle the monkeys or train them and just getit done. However, in reality, to implement this new policy would require manyhours of effort added to the technician’s rounds each day, increase the risk ofbites, and would create the extra mess of cleaning up the oil the monkeys wouldsling everywhere, and the process amounted to trying to “force feed” a gang ofangry, super-strength teen-agers with ADHD and long teeth! They’d rather spitthe corn oil in your face than swallow it!Necessity being the mother of invention, the colony technicians came up with theidea of filling five-gallon buckets half full of corn oil, and then packing thebucket full to the top with monkey biscuits and then leaving them to soak up theoil overnight. The next morning each monkey was first fed several of the oilsoaked biscuits, each biscuit like a handful of buttered popcorn, before theywere given the remainder of the days ration.Several problems were immediately created. The more biscuits the monkey ate themore the oil they got. Number two, the extra oil threw the nutrient balance ofthe commercially prepared ration completely off. In this case, corn oil wasnotorious for increasing the need for selenium. Even if there was selenium inthe pellets, the added oil created a relative deficiency. It never crossedanyone’s mind to increase the selenium level of the diet to compensate for theaddition of the extra corn oil. As a result, the pregnant females were allselenium deficient, which then affected the developing embryos. Likewise, thelactating females were selenium deficient and passed on selenium deficient milkto the infant monkeys.At this point Wallach went back into the colony and examined the rest of them.The hair of the adults and infants had lost the normal gray-green color and thebabies were universally small for their age and were anemic.Wallach applied for and got permission to gather liver and pancreatic biopsiesfrom several of the worst-looking infants. Again, the classic changes for cysticfibrosis were there for all to see; However, he said nothing, and nobody asked.The time was not right yet. As a matter of standard practice, blood samples werecollected from all of the Yerkes monkeys and apes on a monthly basis, andidentified and saved in a freezer in case they were needed at a later date.Wallach requested that the blood of the of the CF monkey’s parents and theinfants themselves be tested for selenium levels and to look for deficiencystates. Bingo! It was a heady moment, but still Wallach could not share theinformation with anyone. Swollen scientific egos at a national and internationallevel were involved, and it could mean danger if they moved to discreditWallach’s work at this early stage.Nevertheless, it was now generally recognized that Dr. Joel D. Wallach,veterinary pathologist at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, EmoryUniversity of Atlanta, Georgia, had discovered the first non-human case ofcystic fibrosis.The new darling of the primate center, Wallach was an overnight celebrity. Hepresented a featured paper at an international pathology conference held inAtlanta. Emory University put out a major news release, and the story wasfeatured on the front section of the Sunday edition of the Atlanta ConstitutionJournal. Wallach initiated the process of writing a major scientific paper onthe cystic fibrosis monkey.To top things off, Wallach was given a $1,000 per year wage increase andreceived letters of congratulations and commendation. NASA was excited that oneof their low-budget projects had produced a major scientific breakthrough inhuman health research. Mail poured into Yerkes, and there were the requests forradio and television interviews. Reporters from journals, magazines, tabloids,radio stations, and television networks called in for “the story.”The National Institutes of Health began to show serious interest as they werebeing besieged with inquiries. Wallach was notified that that they were going tohost an animal model workshop (May 25–26, 1978) at the main NIH campus inBethesda, Maryland, and they wanted him to be one of the featured speakers.Wallach was supposed to present the cystic fibrosis case so others could be onthe lookout for similar monkeys.Wallach accepted the invitation and was promptly sent his air tickets, hotelreservations, and a $500 stipend for expenses. The NIH also requested a briefabstract for inclusion into the printed program proceedings. Wallach began thetask of compiling the abstract that would formally introduce his cystic fibrosismonkey to the national and international scientific world. Over the years,Wallach had done this sort of thing literally hundreds of times. He hadsubmitted abstracts and had given similar presentations to his scientificcolleagues, including physicians, veterinarians, and PhDs, so the task wasneither foreign nor formidable. It appeared that the time had come to “show hishand.” After all, they had essentially asked the question: “Please, will youtell us!”Wallach had done his due diligence. He had made the diagnosis and had itconfirmed by the world’s experts, he had backtracked and had identified theenvironmental and causative factors and deficiencies, and he could repeat theprocess. He could in fact create an unlimited supply of laboratory animal modelsfor the study of and elimination of cystic fibrosis!Wallach felt as if the concept of The Center for the Biology of Natural Systemshad produced a result far beyond anyone’s hopes and dreams!Wallach viewed these events as a “twofer,” one hurrah for The Center for theBiology of Natural Systems and the second for the Yerkes Regional PrimateResearch Center. Wallach enclosed the appropriate photomicrographs of the CFmonkey tissues for the printed program, put the abstract into the envelope,sealed it, addressed it, stamped it, and sent it. He then went about his dailyresponsibilities and never gave the matter a second thought.Shortly thereafter, Dr. McClure returned from his vacation. It was immediatelyobvious that instead of being excited about the cystic fibrosis discovery,catching the “CF fever,” and asking what he could do to support the new andwondrous project, he was miffed that the cystic fibrosis discovery had occurredwhile he was off on vacation.Of course, by his own rules that McClure had dictated to Wallach upon hisarrival, he would be, without question, the second investigator of any studiesgenerated by the project and second author of any publications. He had spentfifteen years in the trenches looking through monkey intestines for parasites(worms), and the new guy on the block uncovered the biggest discovery ever atYerkes—the cause, prevention, and cure of cystic fibrosis!McClure was not a happy camper. In the hallway his jaw muscles were clenched andworked overtime, and he ground his teeth loudly whenever they passed each other.His office door was closed, a completely new behavior. It was now obvious toWallach that there was going to be “Big trouble in River City,” trouble with acapital T—little did he realize how much trouble!At the same time, Wallach’s wife Josephine had died from “complications of theuse of a new form of chemotherapy for Hodgkin’s Disease that was marketed asbeing free of negative side effects.” Wallach was now a widower with four smallchildren ages one and a half years to eight years of age.FORCES OF IGNORANCE AND CORRUPTION THROW WALLACH’S LIFE AND CAREER INTO TURMOILLess than two weeks later, a terse-sounding Dr. Geoffrey Bourne summoned Wallachto his office. A week earlier, Wallach was making history. Now, inside Dr.Bourne’s office, with Bourne’s face as red as a tomato and with neck andforehead veins bulging, he blurted out: “You’re fired!” Flabbergasted, Wallachresponded with, “What do you mean I’m fired? I haven’t stolen anything. Ihaven’t done anything wrong!” Dr. Bourne angrily responded, “You listen here,Wallach! Everyone knows you can’t create cystic fibrosis—it’s a geneticdisease.”Wallach quickly responded, “Dr. Bourne, I didn’t say that I could create cysticfibrosis. If you read the abstract that I have sent to the NIH, I only statedthat I could create animal models for the study of cystic fibrosis. I was verycareful to make that point clear. All animals for the study of genetic diseasesare created by one manner or another. I would like to request a critical reviewof my material by a committee of appropriate scholars, much like a PhD candidatesubmits to, to defend his research.”Bourne retorted, “Don’t you understand, Wallach, they won’t allow me to let yousay that cystic fibrosis could be ‘created’! All of the world’s experts havebuilt their careers and their lives on cystic fibrosis being a classicgenetically-transmitted disease! They won’t hear of some young upstart comingalong and jamming it down their throats that cystic fibrosis could be created!It’s out of the question! There is no way that I can keep you, Wallach! You’regone!”Recovering sufficiently to speak, Wallach added, “With all due respect, Dr.Bourne, when I say that I can create an animal model for the advanced study ofcystic fibrosis, I mean it! I can do it! That’s the truth!”Then Bourne blurted out, “The truth doesn’t matter! No buts, Wallach! You’refired, and that’s final!”To add insult to injury, Dr. Bourne called in two armed security guards to haveWallach escorted from the building immediately to prevent Wallach from gatheringup all of his cystic fibrosis material. However, he decided he was not going toleave without it! He told the guards, “Look you guys, I have to get my books,I’ll meet you at the door.” Wallach went first to his office and then to the laband put all of his cystic fibrosis records, pertinent references, glass slideswith the original CF tissue, and the 2x2 presentation transparencies into thebottom of a large box and covered them with his personal books. The guardsdutifully checked through some of the books at the exit door, but when they sawWallach’s personal stamp on the inside cover of each book, they waved him outthe door.Wallach left Yerkes forever, with a box full of books and the cystic fibrosismaterial clutched in his arms. He had lost a battle with the forces of ignoranceand ego, but he swore that the war over the cause of cystic fibrosis was notover yet!That day, Wallach swore a silent oath to himself: “They won’t win. I won’t letthem! I simply won’t let them!” Wallach had the materials he needed to “fire ashot across their bow.” Although the National Institute of Health invitation hadbeen withdrawn, he set to work writing a paper on cystic fibrosis before theywrote it using his data. He had to beat them to the punch. Throwing all cautionto the wind at this point, Wallach decided to bring up all his findings into theopen in the form of a scientific paper—a monograph—the sort of thing thatDarwin, Mendel, Pasteur, and Lind had done. Why not Wallach!Wallach added a summary of his entire thoughts on cystic fibrosis into the work.He entitled the monograph The Pathogenesis and Etiology of Cystic Fibrosis. Tobe sure, it was bold if not brash to claim that he knew “the” cause of cysticfibrosis. In the face of a calcified scientific community unwilling to hear thetruth, this was no time for equivocation, a weak heart, or timidity! Wallachfelt obligated to make sure that the truth that CF could be prevented and curedgot out to the families of cystic fibrosis children. He also felt he must alsodo it for the memory of his late wife, who had known about the discovery beforeher passing. (Even as she was dying she supported his effort to get the truthabout cystic fibrosis out to the public. Her last words were “Don’t let themwin!”).Wallach dotted his “I’s” crossed his “T’s” and added one hundred unimpeachablekey references and the telling photomicrographs to complete and support thepremise of the monograph. He attached copies of the confirming letters by Nasar,Oppenheimer, and Esterly on their letterhead that they had confirmed Wallach’sdiagnosis of cystic fibrosis, and then he had one hundred copies of the entirepackage printed and copyrighted.A day before the NIH Animal Model Conference convened, Wallach flew from Atlantato Baltimore, Maryland. He checked into a hotel and read the CF monograph twentytimes so he could give the presentation in his sleep. The next morning, he tooka cab to the NIH campus and arrived at the animal model conference an hourearly, taking a position at the entrance of the seminar hall where he hadoriginally been invited to speak.The attendees passing through the great NIH portals were each given a copy ofthe monograph and a smile. It wasn’t long before the chairman of the animalmodel seminar came outside and grabbed Wallach by the arm, “For God’s sake,Wallach, what are you doing? We can’t have you passing out unsanctioned papers.You’ll simply have to leave!”Wallach responded with, “Well, I guess you have a problem. It’s a free country,isn’t it?” “Dammit, Wallach, you don’t understand! You’re disrupting the wholeconference!” Demanding to be arrested or allowed to speak, Wallach kept passingout the papers, and the NIH chairman responded with, “I will have you arrested,dammit!” Then he disappeared into the meeting.Their problem was that they had printed the title and the abstract of the cysticfibrosis paper and Wallach’s name in the early announcements of the animal modelmeeting, and many of the attendees had come specifically to hear Wallach’spresentation. The NIH finally capitulated. ”Okay! Wallach, listen here!” Wallachlistened. “We’re going to give you fifteen minutes to make your presentation.After that, we never want to see your face again! Is that clear, Wallach?”That was all that Wallach needed. He presented the cystic fibrosis paper, showedhis slides, and saved five minutes for questions. He left the podium with loudapplause ringing in his ears. On one hand, revenge was sweet. On the other hand,Wallach learned all too quickly though that the immediate victory would onlylast a fleeting moment.Wallach had given a brief, but stunning presentation and felt vindicated, but heknew he had stepped on some pretty serious toes—maybe, even some land-mines!There were bound to be some serious repercussions. Naively believing that thetruth would prevail, Wallach underestimated the viciousness he would quicklyencounter.NIH was not amused by Wallach’s behavior. In fact it was the first time in theirtwenty-five years that the proceedings of an NIH-sponsored conference was notpublished. The proceedings of the 1978 conference are still missing from thewritten history of the NIH. In their spiteful move to kill the publication ofWallach’s paper, the NIH had, unfortunately, also doomed the papers of the otherpresenters. The publication of many world experts’ papers were derailed for1978. Many scientists were outraged by the NIH decision. But the spite didn’tend there.From the moment that Wallach appeared on the NIH steps he was on the “hit list.”He didn’t realize it at first, but his career in basic research was over. Heattended veterinary pathology seminars looking for job announcements. He hadfour little kids to feed. He visited veterinary schools and medical schoolsapplying for jobs as a service pathologist. He wasn’t greedy—he just needed togo back to work. Wallach soon learned that his work and his life would take on awhole new direction.Jobless and widowed, Wallach packed up his kids and moved back to Missouri,where he worked for his father loading trucks so he could feed his kids and paybills. Wallach applied for the laboratory colony directorship at the St. LouisUniversity, and again with Marlin Perkins’ recommendation, to Wallach’ssurprise, he landed the job. He began putting things together, arrangingschedules, clarifying responsibilities, and preparing to be employed again.This time Wallach was going to be responsible for making the administrativedecisions as well as directing the science. Wallach moved his boxes of books andreference materials and files into his new office, but before he had completedhis unpacking, the dean of the medical school came down to the lab and handedhim a letter withdrawing their offer of employment.The St. Louis University had sent out an announcement of Wallach’s appointmentas the new director of the animal research colony in their newsletter, whichdrew a response from Emory University, the Yerkes Regional Primate ResearchCenter and the NIH, all of which convinced St. Louis University that he was anut and inferred that their federal funding would be pulled if Wallach washired. Yerkes and the NIH had caught up with him again.Wallach set out again to the veterinary seminars in hopes of finding a job. Heknew he was not the smartest guy around, but nobody could ever accuse him ofever giving up. Persistence paid off. He ran into one of his old veterinaryschool chums, Dr. John Troxel. John had graduated from the University ofMissouri, School of Veterinary Medicine, one year before Wallach had and thenspent some time in the army doing research. He then opened up a small animalpractice in Chicago. John had built a very successful private practice and wasvery experienced in veterinary clinical medicine and clinical research.Wallach brought John up to date on all of his successes, great victories anddiscoveries, and his more recent termination and run-in with the NIH. “John tomake a long story short, I’m looking for a job, I need to feed my four kids.With all of your contacts, do you know of anybody who needs a good veterinary orcomparative pathologist?”“Listen to me, Joel! You’re wasting your time! Absolutely wasting your time!They’ll never let you back into the system! Believe me! I know! I’ve seen themix of ego, power, and bureaucracy in the Army! Take my advice and go retrainfor something else” John replied.“But John, the cystic fibrosis story is too big to let go. Surely someone wouldbe interested in helping these CF kids,” countered Wallach.“Don’t get me wrong, Joel. I’ll help you. But right now you don’t believe me.So, try your luck, and when you’re totally disillusioned, give me a call. We’lltake up the situation from there.”John’s statements and assessments of the situation made no sense to Wallach atthe time. He still believed that the promise of help for the cystic fibrosisfamilies and children would be so interesting and compelling to someone outthere that the seemingly never ending witch hunt by the NIH, Emory University,and the Yerkes Primate Center would be neutralized.In between meetings and seminars, raising four kids, and the hunt for a job,Wallach chopped wood and broke up cast iron bath tubs with a sledge hammer forscrap metal. He had to vent his anger and frustration on something. It was thebest time of his life and at the same time the worst time of his life. Untilthat low point, Wallach had been so engrossed in doing his science and workingon the book, that it never occurred to him that the truth could be suppressedand that personalities controlled science rather than truth! Wallach finallygave in; he knew he had been “black-balled” forever—it was over, and he had tomove on. The egos in the NIH, Emory University and the Yerkes Primate Center hadcinched the noose tight around his neck. It was as if the days of witch hunts,torture, hangings, and being burnt at the stake had returned.It was time to call John Troxel. John, of course had been correct in hisassessment of the reality of Wallach’s plight, but he wanted Wallach to figureit out for himself. John was not surprised when Wallach called. He only asked,“What took you so long?”Wallach confessed to John that he had been correct all along, “I didn’t believeyou at first, but I do now.”John came back with, “I understand, Joel. It doesn’t make sense to you that I’mright, but unfortunately I am. Anyway, that’s neither here nor there right now.The important thing is to do something about it. I have a plan up my sleeve thatI think will work. Give me a couple of days, and I’ll get back to you.”What John did was to hire the services of the most prestigious public relationsfirm in Illinois that he could find. The “chosen ones” had been involved withthe political campaigns of every senatorial and presidential candidate to comeout of the state of Illinois. John explained the history, circumstances, and thecurrent status of Wallach’s situation, and asked them to come up with a plan ofaction that would bring the matter to the largest possible public audience. Inreturn, John would write a check for $20,000.When Wallach learned of how much money John was investing in him, he asked,“John, $20,000, are you mad? Twenty thousand dollars is one year’s salary! I’llnever be able to repay you!” “Don’t worry Joel, I’ll get my money’s worth. Youand I are going to have some fun together,” he said with an impish chuckle.Wallach was dumbfounded. Why would John spend $20,000 just to have some fun?“Listen, Joel. The money is my problem,” John said. “Your job is to get your acttogether. Have every detail at your fingertips. Be prepared to answer everyquestion, counter every accusation. Know your facts, figures, dates, people,places, and put your story into the best possible format. You do that and I’lldo the rest!”Wallach again asked John if he thought the plan would really accomplishanything. “Even if it doesn’t work 100 percent it will accomplish somethingdramatic and spectacular, so get your act together and be fully ready when Icall you.”A BLITZ OF ATTENTION: WALLACH TRIES TO CONVINCE OTHERS OF THE TRUTH OF HISFINDINGSIn August of 1978, Wallach found himself in the middle of a media blitz thatwould have made any presidential candidate envious. The cyclone started at thelegendary New York City Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Every TV network was there. Everynews wire service was represented including the UPI and the AP. Medicalreporters and writers from every newspaper and magazine had been invited. Mediakits which included a three-page rendition of the basic cystic fibrosis story ofthe discovery with a picture of Wallach with one of the cystic fibrosis monkeys,and a copy of the original Emory University news release from March of 1978 washanded to each attendee. Wallach gave a stellar half-hour presentation withslides explaining the value of being able to create an animal model for thestudy of cystic fibrosis, and why it was a necessary step towards solving theunsolved mystery of the terrible childhood disease.The next day was spent in the 21 Club for lunch with the medical writer for theUPI news wire service and answering phone calls that had been generated by theTV network’s airing of the cystic fibrosis story the night before. The story asWallach and the public relations firm had written it appeared in 1,700newspapers around the world as a result of being picked up by the UPI news wireservice.The new TV magazine 20/20 contacted Wallach and wanted to arrange a segment foran upcoming program. A lecture circuit was set up and scheduled. Wallachlectured around the country at the invitation of the individual state chaptersof the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and cystic fibrosis support groups. Themeetings took place in hospital auditoriums, hotels, and civic centers. Wallachlived with families that had had one or more cystic fibrosis children. He atewith the cystic fibrosis families and patients, interviewed the parents, lookedat their bowel movements, their blood laboratory test results, their chestX-rays, and examined them. After a few weeks into his schedule, he kneweverything he needed to know to prevent and cure cystic fibrosis—the rhesusmonkey findings were correct!TV 20/20 sent out a production crew to follow Wallach’s lecture circuit. Theyfilmed his lectures in VA hospitals, university hospitals, and to support groupsin home living rooms. They interviewed CF families. The 20/20 crew was friendly,but it was obvious they were just going through the motions. Wallach felt thatthey were actually hoping for protests by doctors and they were extremelydisappointed when nothing negative really happened. It was almost like screaminginto the wind.The 20/20 experience was Wallach’s first adventure with the investigative TVnews media; he wore his heart on his sleeve and was very open and honest withthem. When the 20/20 cystic fibrosis story was finally aired, he was surprisedto see that more than fifty percent of the story and air time was devoted to theorthodox view of CF being a genetic disease . . . a view that Wallach hadcompletely discredited.The anti-selenium view on the 20/20 airing was presented by the director of theNational Poison Control Center in Denver, an MD/PhD toxicologist. It was 1978,and the fact that selenium had been declared an essential nutrient had beenknown in academic and scientific circles since 1957, twenty-one years earlier.The medical director of the National Toxicology Center actually declared onnational television that the trace mineral selenium was toxic, so toxic in factthat “he wouldn’t give it to a pregnant woman or healthy baby, let alone a sickchild with CF.”Even though the net presentation of the 20/20 program was south of neutral,Wallach received thousands of inquiring calls and thousands of inquiringletters. The people wanted to know! The general public and CF families werethirsty for information that might help their children. They were all ears! Itwas immediately obvious that Troxel was correct something was going to happen!The scientific community and the established dogma had actually been a roadblockto progress—certainly the practices of banning, torturing, hanging, burning atthe stake, and being drawn and quartered by four lunging horses was nothing newin the world of science and medicine.Wallach lectured in twenty American states, and he was invited to Zurich,Switzerland, and Rome, Italy, to lecture to cystic fibrosis families. Cysticfibrosis was the same disease in Zurich, Rome, and in all of the American citieshe visited. By the end of August 1978, Wallach had accumulated all of thepublished material ever written on CF and had become the holder of all of theknown information (right or wrong) about CF. He knew cystic fibrosis!The dilemma for the proponents of the genetic theory of disease transmission forCF was that the clinical presentation of CF, even with CF patients in the samefamily, will rarely exhibit the same form of the disease. In a family with threeCF children, one might exhibit major pancreatic symptoms, one might have liverdisease, and the third’s major complaint might be severe lung disease and mightdie of a cardiomyopathy heart attack. The cystic fibrosis story had the sameproblem as the Arctic fox story at the Brookfield Zoo: when you have severaldifferent birth defects occurring in the progeny of the same male and femalethey cannot be a genetically-transmitted disease. They can only be caused by acongenital nutritional deficiency of the embryo.Additionally, cystic fibrosis was theorized to be transmitted by “the mostclassic form of a simple Mendelian recessive gene” in white Europeans. It wasfurther theorized that one in four humans had the recessive gene lurking inthem. In what Wallach regarded as a fourth-grade biology test of the theory helooked for and found were the statistics for CF babies who were born to a motherand father couple who were both CF patients themselves.If the simple recessive gene theory for the transmission of CF was in factcorrect, then one hundred percent of babies born to CF couples would, by all ofthe known facts of classic Mendelian genetics, be born with cystic fibrosis.The outcome of this simple fourth grade study was astounding! Out of all of thethousands of babies born to such couples only one had been born with CF! Anotherproblem the geneticists had was when couples were made up of one CF patient whenthe numbers of CF babies born should statistically come out to one out of four.But the results didn’t match the theory. It was impossible for CF to be genetic!Wallach’s experience and training he accumulated at The Center for the Biologyof Natural Systems put his experience and thinking way ahead of the acceptedknowledge of the day that the established cystic fibrosis experts “knew” cysticfibrosis was genetically transmitted because that’s what they were taught;supposedly they knew how to “read the language of cystic fibrosis.”Wallach, on the other hand came to the table as an empty slate and untainted bydogma. As a result, he “knew” that CF was not a genetically-transmitted disease,and “epigenetics” was born! Sir William Bragg said quite accurately, “Theimportant thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to discover newways of thinking about them.”Wallach knew that cystic fibrosis was not a genetically-transmitted disease, butrather it was a congenital or perinatal defect caused by a deficiency of thetrace mineral selenium in the mother. The deficiency of selenium caused adisruption of the metabolic activities in high-production and high-energytissues such as pancreas, liver, heart, and lungs.There were three other pieces that were put into the puzzle over time: (1) aspeople moved around the country the levels of nutrients in food, includingselenium, varied and resulted in the “spontaneous” reversal of a positive sweattest; (2) varying degrees of rate of appearance of symptoms and severity of theclinical disease; (3) gluten intolerance affects percentages of absorption ofvarious nutrients, so those mothers and CF children who also had a glutenintolerance would have a different presentation of clinical CF than those whodidn’t have a gluten intolerance (you are not what you eat—you are what youabsorb).The excitement over the CF discovery was growing, although Wallach was still outof a job. Telephone bills, traveling, airfares, restaurants, baby sitters, andfeeding four kids soon depleted Wallach’s meager financial reserves and he wasdead in the water, so to speak. He returned to Missouri and again worked for hisfather loading trucks while he figured what to do.GAME CHANGE: WALLACH DISCOVERS NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE AT THE NATIONAL HEALTHFEDERATION ANNUAL CONVENTIONThe media campaign generated a phone call from Clinton Miller of the NationalHealth Federation. The NHF was a consumer advocacy group that supportedalternative views on health that encouraged the use of vitamins and minerals toprevent and reverse disease.Miller spoke up and said, “We’re having a convention in Chicago. There will bethousands of people in attendance who will want to hear your story and message.We’d like you to be a featured speaker. The NHF supports people like you, peoplewho have been downgraded for finding and revealing the truth.”Miller continued with, “The convention is going to take place at the newlyopened McCormick Center where the facilities are fabulous, and we’re expecting arecord crowd!”Wallach was very honest as he lamented, “I would be very honored Mr. Miller,except that I’m broke. I couldn’t afford the trip.” “Don’t worry about themoney,” Clinton chirped, “We’ll take care of your expenses and pay you a $500honorarium.”The NHF annual convention in Chicago was like nothing that Wallach had everseen. There was an exhibit hall with hundreds of exhibitors. They were a motleycrew that included purveyors of water filters, rebounders, vitamins, minerals,herbs, algae, crystals, books, videos, and beads. There were belly dancers,drummers, singers, Tibetan monks “Ohming,” massage therapists, chiropractors,and iridologists. There were vegetarian, vegan, and organic food booths of everydescription: tofu, rice, spices, carrot juice, and blue corn chips. The scenewas right out of an ancient Persian bazaar. The only thing missing was the swordswallower.The lectures took place in various ball rooms. Typically there were as many aseight to ten lectures going on simultaneously. As a featured speaker, Wallachgave his presentation in the main ballroom when there were no other competinglectures. At the appointed hour the room was packed with literally thousands ofexcited people!Wallach’s presentation lasted about an hour, and he received a standing ovationat the end of his lecture. He felt like the “ugly duckling” who had found a homefull of like people. They wanted to hear and know what he had to say! It was awonderfully positive experience. Wallach, the ugly duckling of science, had beentransmuted into a swan!There was a refreshing reasonableness about these people. They came to the eventwith a sincere desire to listen and learn. There were no egos, biases, orpreconceived notions bogging them down. That NHF lecture turned out to be amilestone and a turning point in Wallach’s career.Prior to the NHF convention, Wallach had never before addressed a large,receptive public audience. Previously, his audiences had been groups of ten toone hundred professionals, who were scientific people, veterinarians, andmedical people or pathologists who had come together for some high-levelnutrition or pathology seminar or workshop on nutrition that was given at theDNA, biochemical, and mitochondrial levels.MEETING WITH DR. GERHARD SCHRAUZER AND OTHER ILLUSTRIOUS SCIENTISTSA few days after returning to Missouri, Wallach received a phone call from Dr.Gerhard Schrauzer, Chairman of the Department of Chemistry at UCSD. Throughreviewing the selenium research, Wallach had become very familiar with Dr.Schrauzer’s work with selenium and his association with Dr. Klaus Schwarz, thescientist who in 1957 had shown that selenium was an essential nutrient. Thesetwo men were Wallach’s heroes.Dr. Schrauzer is to selenium what Linus Pauling is to vitamin C. Dr. Schrauzerhad read the UPI story about the discovery of the CF monkey and Wallach’ssubsequent termination when he connected cystic fibrosis to a seleniumdeficiency. Initially, Schrauzer was not totally familiar with all of therelationships between cystic fibrosis and a selenium deficiency, but he wasangry when he learned Wallach was treated badly and had been summarilyterminated without the opportunity to defend his research.Schrauzer invited Wallach to come to La Jolla, California, and speak to a smallbut illustrious international group including several Nobel laureates that wasscheduled for the following week. Dr. Schrauzer, as program chairman, wouldguarantee Wallach the opportunity to defend his findings and his theory despitethe last-minute arrangements—and all expenses would be paid in advance by UCSD!Wallach went to California, and at the University of California, La Jolla Campusgave a thirty-minute presentation to the most educated and the most criticalscientific audience with expertise in the fields of chemistry, genetics, andnutrition he had yet encountered. The cystic fibrosis information was wellreceived and he was encouraged by all to pursue the work “because the truthneeded to be exposed to the light of day.”Dr. Schrauzer stated that if Wallach didn’t pursue the cystic fibrosisinformation himself it could be as long as one hundred years or more before theconcept of a congenital selenium deficiency as the cause of CF surfaced again.Wallach felt as though he had been handed a mission, and that his observationshad been vindicated and recognized as a valid concept by some of the topscientific thinkers in the world. After all, if Wallach’s thinking was totallyout of the realm of reasonable certainty, Dr. Schrauzer would have been honestenough to tell him that he was wasting his time.THE NATIONAL COLLEGE OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE PORTLAND, OREGON: UNDERSTANDINGNATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS AND WHAT THEY DOAnother opportunity arose out of the Chicago NHF conference. As it happened,there were several members of the board of directors (Jim Sensenig, ND, BruceCanvasser, ND, Jerry Schlesser, ND) of the National College of NaturopathicMedicine from Portland, Oregon, in attendance. The school had a booth at theexpo and the board members were there to recruit students and faculty members.Wallach had never heard of a naturopathic physician or ND. He didn’t know whothey were or what they did, so he visited their booth, asked questions, andpicked up their literature. Wallach became interested because the naturopathicphysicians were fully licensed as primary care physicians in the state ofOregon.Naturopathic physicians in the state of Oregon could deliver babies, do surgery,write prescriptions, and practice acupuncture. They primarily differed from theMD community because of their strict adherence to the philosophy: “First, do noharm.”While American medical doctors claim to believe in this same philosophyaccording to their Hippocratic Oath, many patients are harmed by their oftenunnecessary surgical practices and dangerous experimental prescriptions forillness. In contrast to this, patients under the care of naturopathic physiciansfirst offer choices of therapies that have a very low risk of injuring people,and perform surgery and prescribe medicines only when absolutely necessary.The NCNM board members were very excited about Wallach’s background inpathology, nutrition, and teaching so they struck up a conversation. Theyattended Wallach’s one-hour lecture, where he showed slides that featured aknown nutritional-deficiency disease in animals and then showed slides of thesame disease in humans, making the connection between nutritional-deficiencydiseases in animals and humans. The board members took Wallach out to dinner,where the conversation became more animated when they learned that he waslooking for a job.Wallach was invited to give a lecture on nutrition at the October 1978 annualmeeting of the Oregon Association of Naturopathic Physicians (OANP), a learningevent where the NDs could get some of their continuing medical education (CME)credits for licensure. He was to recount the cystic fibrosis story and cover asmuch general nutrition as possible in a two-hour presentation. This request wasnot a problem as Wallach had slides of hundreds of deficiency diseases. Again,expenses were to be paid and an honorarium was to be given. Wallach still didn’tquite know what a naturopathic physician was exactly, but they wanted to listento what he had to say, so two months later he was off to Oregon.Wallach was given a tour of the NCNM campus, including clinics by the dean,board members, and licensed naturopathic physicians. NCNM, established in 1957,was the oldest functioning naturopathic medical college. The classrooms andclinics were housed in the historic Postal Building in downtown Portland. TheNCNM campus was small in terms of infrastructure, minimally equipped, and washardly what Wallach was used to at the large university campuses where he hadbeen a student and taught and did research for the NIH and the National ScienceFoundation.Wallach was shown an architect’s rendering for a new campus and had lunch withboard members and members the teaching faculty. The faculty included PhDs,pharmacologists, MDs, cardiologists, NDs, and administrative types. The entiregroup seemed to be genuinely interested and supportive of Wallach’s views ofnutrition and the ability of supplements to prevent, treat, and reverse disease.Wallach was treated as a celebrity, which endeared them to him.An ND is a primary care physician who is regulated by a state medical board, inthe states that allow them to be licensed physician, much the same as an MD is.A naturopathic physician can examine patients, diagnose, and treat all diseases;deliver babies; perform surgery; get a DEA number; write prescriptions forpharmaceuticals; perform acupuncture; prescribe herbs; practice homeopathy;perform manipulation, physical therapy, and counseling; and by Oregon law mustbe reimbursed by health insurance for their services.In Oregon the “orthodox” allopathic medical profession looked upon naturopathicphysicians as strange offshoots of old-time medicine bordering on quackery. Inturn naturopathic physicians look upon the “orthodox” medical community asuncaring, arrogant, heavy-handed upstarts who over-prescribe pharmaceuticalswith harmful side effects, perform unnecessary and dangerous surgery out ofgreed, and deliver unnecessary and dangerous chemotherapy and radiation out ofignorance and greed.In 1978 five states licensed naturopathic physicians as primary care physicians.In 1999, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Montana, Arizona, Massachusetts,Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and the District of Columbialicensed NDs as primary care physicians.The naturopathic physician had a reduced scope of practice in many other statesbecause of powerful medical lobbies, and in the state of Tennessee byconstitutional amendment NDs can’t practice health care in any form.Naturopathic physicians were often prevented from delivering babies in stateswhere midwives were allowed to deliver babies. In some states NDs were notallowed to puncture the skin to draw blood or deliver acupuncture therapy, whereany eighteen-year-old off the street with three hours of training could be aphlebotomist and draw blood for any clinic or hospital.The naturopathic audience was an eclectic collection of students at variouslevels of their studies, academic staff from the college, and practicingnaturopathic physicians. They were fascinated by the presentation approach ofshowing slides of the known nutritional-deficiency diseases in animalsparalleled with the same diseases in humans. It was an enraptured audience—theywere very interested in nutritional-deficiency diseases in humans. Theydemonstrated their approval of Wallach with a standing ovation at the end of thepresentation. Wallach was in a groove and seemingly among kindred souls; theugly duckling was starting to look more like a swan again!DR. JOEL WALLACH FINDS HIS GROOVE AND VIGOROUSLY PURSUES A NEW PROFESSIONAfter the presentation, Wallach was approached by the chairman of the board ofdirectors of NCNM, the dean of students, and the school president. This time theoffer was for a job as an instructor in nutrition. They wanted Wallach to teachnutrition at the college and create a series of four courses that coverednutrition for each of the four years of the naturopathic medical curriculum.Wallach had reached a professional juncture. Should he totally give up on twentyyears of orthodox university-level research and associations with the mainstream of science and join this maverick band of healthcare professionals andtarnish his background previously steeped in publication of basic research andcredible university connections? Then he remembered what Dr. John Troxel hadsaid, “Joel, they will never let you back in.”Wallach accepted the offer of a teaching position at NCNM with one proviso:Wallach wanted to be able to take courses towards completing an ND degree at thesame time that he was teaching. He didn’t see any problem since he had done itbefore at the University of Missouri, Iowa State University, and WashingtonUniversity.The task of setting up a series of four sequential nutrition courses ofincreasing detail and difficulty would be second nature. By no means would it bethe first time that Wallach had lectured to a group of highly educated andmotivated professional students.Wallach’s ultimate goal was to be able to treat cystic fibrosis patients as soonas possible and get the message out to the cystic fibrosis community thatWallach had cutting-edge information to help them reverse their disease andprevent the occurrence of additional cystic fibrosis patients by employing agluten-free diet and the supplementation of a complete nutritional supplementprogram spiked with additional selenium to young women still in theirchild-bearing years (particularly those that had already produced a cysticfibrosis child).After a brief closed meeting, the board approved Wallach’s request and askedthat he be in place and ready to teach by January 1979. They projected that bytaking courses part time that Wallach would be able to complete his ND degree insix to eight years. The process seemed too long for Wallach as he was alreadythirty-eight, a widower, and the single father of four small children. He didn’tsay anything out loud, but he knew he would have to speed up the process.Wallach showed up for work on the 26th of December 1978. The weather was bad.“Black ice” had ravaged Portland for a week; he let some air out of his tiresand arrived safely at the office to find that he was the only one there exceptfor a secretary manning the main office phone and the school president, Dr. JimSensenig. There was no hubbub of students yet, and in the quiet he went to work.Wallach asked for and got advice and guidance on how to pursue courses with thegoal of becoming a licensed ND as soon as possible.By December 31st, Wallach had completed the outline of the necessary courses,ordered the required textbooks, and was ready to go, even though the classesdidn’t begin until January 4th, 1979.Wallach dug in and began to prepare course outlines for naturopathic nutrition101, 102, 103, and 104. He put together the lectures, presentation slides,hand-out materials, and ordered a small supply of textbooks for the students ineach of the course levels.Wallach remained in the Missouri Air National Guard; however, he transferred hisunit drill location to the Oregon Air Guard in Portland for convenience. He waspromoted to the rank of major and was eventually promoted to Lt. Colonel andtransferred to the Alaska Air Guard to fill their need for an environmentalhealth officer to deal with chemical warfare and NBC (Nuclear, Biological andChemical) warfare response.Next step was for Wallach to formally apply to be a student, fill out the formsfor the curriculum committee, transfer all relevant transcripts for the variousuniversities and completed course work, and request an advanced student statusso he could also begin his residency immediately and concurrently. The goal wasto begin treating cystic fibrosis kids as quickly as possible.Two weeks later the curriculum committee had approved Wallach’sadvanced-standing status. His years of clinical work with animals, hisinternational acclaim as a comparative pathologist, his previous universitycourse work in the basic sciences of both human and veterinary medicine, and hispublications in peer-reviewed journals all contributed to the committee’sjustification of accepting his transcripts, transfer credits, and granting hisadvanced student standing concurrently with his residency.He attacked the massive load of triple-academic projects and familyresponsibilities with the same military approach that had been so successful ingetting him through the University of Missouri agricultural school, veterinaryschool, and comparative pathology simultaneously.Wallach immediately began to see patients in the NCNM clinic under thesupervision of staff clinicians and senior and graduate students. He visited andtoured several private clinics until he found two practicing naturopathicphysicians who were willing to take him under their wings and allow him to sitin on their patient visits. One practitioner was a woman (Dr. Lori Marzel), theother a man (Dr. Brian MacCoy) affording him the different gender perspectives.Within weeks, Wallach was delivering babies under supervision, performing officesurgery, and preparing and connecting IV drips under the watchful eyes of hismentors. During his fourteen years as a veterinarian, Wallach had alreadymastered most of the common clinical and laboratory diagnostic skills. Theexciting part was that he was observing the treatment of human diseases withnutritional and herbal formulas. After a short period of time, the supervisingdoctors began to ask for Wallach’s opinion and even employed some of hisveterinary nutritional formulas for their patients.“Compressing and Condensing” were Wallach’s watch words for negotiating throughand finishing his naturopathic training as quickly as possible—nothing was leftout or cut short; he simply had to the same amount of study and work as anyother student in a shorter period of time. At 38 years old, he simply couldn’tspend another eight years as a student!In order to compress and condense his requirements, he commonly would be takingclasses on one subject while an examiner for another subject would sit besidehim with sets of a hundred microscopic slides for identification of normaltissue for the human histology class, or slides on human diseases for basicpathology courses.Wallach would successfully identify 100 percent of the normal and diseasetissues while taking notes and passing tests for the lecture being attended.Having been a comparative pathologist for over fourteen years, and havingreviewed literally millions of normal and diseased tissues for both animals andhumans through the microscope over the years, rendering the exercise was asimple feat. Employing this method Wallach was able to successfully getequivalent and/or transfer credits for veterinary and human graduate classes inphysiology, public health, microbiology, parasitology, animal and humanneuroanatomy, basic surgical technique, medical biochemistry, pharmacology,toxicology, basic courses in clinical laboratory and history of medicine, andwas allowed to test-out of gross anatomy, histology, basic and advancedpathology, and all four courses in nutrition.In addition to the whirlwind schedule of testing-out out of some courses andpursuing advanced clinical study, Wallach had to physically attend and takecourses in the history of naturopathic medicine, internal medicine, cardiology,pharmacognosy (the understanding of herbs and methods of extracting the activeprincipals of herbs for medicinal use), herbal medicine, basic and advancedobstetrics, surgery (which Wallach helped to teach), Chinese medicine,acupuncture, homeopathy, orthopedics, pediatrics, EENT, advanced clinicaldiagnosis, physical therapy, residency, and internships.The result of this intense program of intellectual warfare was a halving of theprojected time-frame for Wallach’s graduation as a naturopathic physician,cutting eight years down to three and one half. The academic naturopathiccommunity was in shock. Wallach had passed by the academic level of otherinstructors who had been on the same track of teaching and studying to be anaturopathic physician who’d started several years before him.The academic naturopathic community was typically laid back. Most were ten tofifteen years younger than Wallach, were vegetarians, and weren’t as motivatedto just get on with the program. Not only was Wallach ten years older; he wasconnected to the military and a habitual hamburger eater. His colleagues saw himas being less “spiritually elevated” than they. Soon they gave Wallach the nickname of “Conan the Veterinarian.”Wallach always had clinical duties on the weekend because no one else would takeit. If they were assigned the weekend clinic duty, they would just skip out! Asa result Wallach probably saw ten times the number of patients as the otherresidents. Once each month Wallach, also had his weekend National Guard drill,which ended early in the afternoon just when his clinic responsibilitiesstarted. He would get permission to leave twenty minutes early, go through theMcDonalds’ drive-through and get a quarter pounder. Arriving at the studentconference room in military fatigues, eating a hamburger, and reviewing patientcharts simply confirmed their view that Wallach was in fact “Conan theVeterinarian.”WALLACH SETS UP HIS OWN CLINIC OF LICENSED NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANSIn 1981 Wallach purchased a small clinic in Canon Beach, Oregon. He paidlicensed naturopathic physicians to operate the clinic on his behalf and tosupervise his activities as an advanced standing student (which also sped up thecompletion of his residency requirements).Wallach adapted many of the veterinary nutritional formulas that he had learnedat the University of Missouri to employ on his human patients. It was nosurprise to him that the veterinary nutritional formulas did in fact work onhumans just as they did in animals. Perhaps the most popular of these formulaswas “Dr. Wallach’s Pig Arthritis Formula.” There were no pigs in the PigArthritis Formula, but the formula came from a nutritional program that wasdesigned to prevent and reverse arthritis in pigs (the original Pig ArthritisFormula has been updated and improved as the “Healthy Bone and Joint Pak”).Seventy-five percent of all Americans over the age of fifty get one type ofarthritis or another to some degree. According to the Centers for DiseaseControl, somewhere between 35 million and 50 million “Baby Boomers” hadarthritis in the year 2010, and there is not a single medical treatment designedto prevent or cure arthritis; in fact many doctors will tell their patients thatarthritis is a genetically-transmitted disease, there is no way that cartilagecan be regrown, and that the only medical answer is the use of pain-reliefmedication, injections of genetically engineered stem cells that will relievepain, and ultimately, in the end, joint replacement.Aspirin doesn’t fix arthritis, and it can cause gastric bleeding and death.Tylenol doesn’t fix arthritis, and it causes 40,000 cases of kidney failure inthe United States each year, 5,000 of which are so severe that the patient isgiven a kidney transplant. Advil, Ibuprofen, and Aleve don’t fix arthritis andtheir use can cause liver disease in five to ten percent of the users.Methotrexate and gold shots don’t fix rheumatoid arthritis and they can subdueyour bone marrow to the point where it can’t produce red blood cells, whiteblood cells, and platelets. Prednisone and cortisone don’t fix arthritis either,and they can cause the patient to get type 2 diabetes and precipitate diseasesfar more horrible than arthritis—these steroids actually speed up the bone-lossprocess and will produce osteoporosis and fractures and type 2 diabetes.When these over the counter and prescription drugs fail to relieve pain andinflammation any more, the orthopedic surgeon will say, “The only treatment leftfor you medically is joint replacement surgery.”In July of 2002, the New England Journal of Medicine published an article, thetitle of which was “Knee Replacement Surgery for Arthritis is Worthless.” InNovember of 20006, the Journal of the American Medical Association published anarticle, the title of which was “Back Surgery for Sciatica is Unnecessary.”Elizabeth Taylor had three hip replacement surgeries. How many hips didElizabeth Taylor have? Despite being attended to by “the best orthopedic surgeonin Hollywood,” she still developed compression fractures. Elizabeth Taylorneeded Dr. Wallach’s Pig Arthritis Formula or the Healthy Bone and Joint Pak!Wallach researched various veterinary nutritional formulas that were designed toprevent and cure arthritis in pigeons, turkeys, dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs,sheep, lions, tigers, and bears and adapted several of them to human use.Cartilage, ligaments, tendons, connective tissue, and bone itself werepredictably regrown regardless of the person’s age.Wallach has seen cartilage and bones regrown in thousands of human patients. Inthe 70s and 80s, Dr. Wallach’s Pig Arthritis Formula was a mix of twenty tothirty pills and capsules containing gelatin (collagen), minerals, traceminerals, amino acids, and vitamins. The pig arthritis formula worked like acharm. It was as predictable as gravity; however many people felt that theformula was too inconvenient to take twenty to thirty capsules and tablets twoto three times per day.In 2010 Wallach produced the Healthy Bone and Joint Pak, which contains 245nutrients (including 115 fruits and vegetables) and the 90 essential nutrients.This program is primarily liquid and contains only three omega-3 soft gelcapsules per dose. Cartilage can be regrown by supplying the nutrients (i.e.,the raw materials) necessary to turn on the genetic script and support andpromote maintenance and repair—that’s epigenetics!DR. WALLACH GRADUATES AND FIGHTS TO SAVE NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE IN OREGONIn 1982 Wallach graduated as a naturopathic physician from the National Collegeof Naturopathic Medicine. This was also the year for the “sunset review” processfor naturopathic medicine, a review that took place every eight years for allhealing professions in the state of Oregon. It was a constitutional process thatallowed the state legislature to examine not only naturopathic medicine, butalso allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, pharmacists, chiropracticmedicine, traditional Chinese medicine, dentistry, nursing, physicianassistants, midwifes, veterinarians, etc.The sunset review process was originally instituted to reaffirm the propertraining, professionalism, proper skill level, and licensing process in aneffort to protect the citizens of the state of Oregon. The sunset review processhad been going on for almost seventy-five years following the1914 FlexnerReport; however, in 1982 the political environment in the healing arts in Oregonwas such that all of the licensing boards banded together and recommended the“sun setting” or de-licensing the naturopathic physicians.The week before the state of Oregon’s sunset committee’s up or down vote on thevery survival of naturopathic medicine in America, it was learned that theresults of the review had already been decided: it was to be “thumbs down,” andwould be the death of a profession that had offered an alternative to allopathicmedicine since the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776! It appearedthat the prediction of Dr. Benjamin Rush (a signer of the Declaration ofIndependence), in the form of his worst nightmare, was about to come true:“The Constitution of this Republic should make special provisions for medicalfreedom as well as religious freedom. To restrict the art of healing to oneclass of men and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the Bastille ofmedical science. All such laws are un-American and despotic.”A team of naturopathic physicians was formed to visit the state legislature andlobby the members of the sunset committee to inform them on the usefulness ofNDs for the people of Oregon and, in effect, remind them that the naturopathicprofession provided a high-quality health service for the people of Oregon formore than seventy-five years, and that as the oldest of the Naturopathiccolleges, NCNM, the Harvard of Naturopathic medicine, was accredited by the U.S.Department of Education, and over the years had graduated more naturopathicphysicians than all of the naturopathic colleges and universities in Americacombined.The naturopathic physician’s team that was sent to beg the sunset committee fora reconsideration of their decision and preserve naturopathic medicine for thepeople of Oregon was made up of practitioners, members of the board forlicensing naturopathic physicians, professors from NCNM (including Wallach), andfourth-year naturopathic students.As Wallach and the other members of the team visited the offices of the membersof the sunset committee it was obvious that there was a serious problem. Everymember of the sunset committee gave a brief audience to the team, but they allgave the same response: “naturopathic medicine in Oregon was going to die thatafternoon and nothing could change the decision of the sunset committeechairman. Had Wallach come all the way to Oregon and worked so hard to become anaturopathic physician, and in the very month of his graduation and attainmentof a degree in naturopathic medicine, have the naturopathic profession executedbefore his eyes?At that point Wallach insisted on getting a visit with the chairman of thesunset committee, and after a lot of gnashing of teeth the chairman grudginglyagreed to receive two members of the naturopathic team, but no one else wantedto go to see the chairman for fear of being blamed for the loss of naturopathicmedicine in Oregon, which would necessarily mean the closure of NCNM.Wallach then proposed that Dr. Jim Sensenig and Wallach be the messengers andambassadors for the profession, and with great relief all of the members of thenaturopathic team voted “yes.” At the appointed hour Wallach and Sensenigappeared in the committee chairman’s office. The chairman was a stern-facedVietnamese man in his fifties. He waved us into his office, folded his arms overhis chest, leaned back in his chair and said, “Well, I can save you a lot oftime; there is nothing you can say that will save naturopathic medicine inOregon—it is dead, there is no appeal!”A dead silence filled the room. Wallach looked at Sensenig who seemed in shock,so Wallach spoke, saying, “At least you owe it to us to let us know whatterrible thing has happened to cause the sunset committee to sunset naturopathicmedicine in Oregon, which in effect would kill naturopathic medicine in theentire country.”The chairman laid his chest across his desk, stiff and wide-eyed, stretched outhis right arm and pointed his finger at Wallach and yelled, “You’re all a bunchof God-damned draft dodgers. My son was a green beret who was killed insoutheast Asia and naturopathic medicine is dead.”Wallach responded, “Is that all? What if it is not true that naturopathicphysicians are all draft dodgers? Will you give us time to prove our case?” Thechairman said, “I will give you fifteen minutes to prove your case!”Wallach and Sensenig gathered up the naturopathic team in the capital lunch roomand identified those who were military veterans:Joel Wallach, Lt. Col Air Force – newly licensed naturopathic physician,professor of Nutrition, NCNMJim Sensenig, U.S. Army – Dean of Students, NCNM, licensed naturopathicphysicianJim Massey, Capt. U.S. Army – fourth year naturopathic studentBill Henry, U.S. Navy – member of the Board of Naturopathic Physicians, theState of Oregon, licensed naturopathic physicianDon Walker, U.S. Army – Chairman of the Board of Naturopathic Physicians, theState of Oregon, licensed naturopathic physicianEach veteran who had their military identification card gathered themselves andreturned to the chairman’s office for their final plea. The team of naturopathicmilitary veterans introduced themselves to the chairman and displayed theirmilitary identification cards. After examining each of the identification cards,the chairman began to weep. After he composed himself he asked, “Why do themedical doctors hate you so much?” To which Wallach stated, “Mr. Chairman, it isa turf battle between MDs and NDs for the hearts and minds of the people andpatients of the state of Oregon.”The chairman pondered for a brief moment and pronounced, “Don’t worry gentlemen,naturopathic medicine will not be destroyed this day. Because of your militaryservice you have changed my mind and you have prevailed!”THE SAGA OF “THE BOOK” FINALLY ENDS AND IT IS PUBLISHEDOver the years, Wallach ended up with all 28 chapters of the book. “The Book”had become his book by default! Wallach said at the time that “There are a lotof people smarter than me, but there are few who are as persistent or who arewilling to work as hard as me to complete a project.” As Carroll Cann, the W. B.Saunders editor predicted, all but one of the 28 original book contributorsexcept for Wallach had fallen ill, died, or gave up in exhaustion.Twelve hundred pages, two thousand illustrations, hundreds of editorialmeetings, 25,000 autopsies, 10 million chemistries, 10 million slides withspecial stains and eighteen years later, Wallach finished it! In 1983 the tomeentitled The Diseases of Exotic Animals was finally finished. The bookrepresented 20,000 animal (454 species) and human autopsies and tens ofthousands of clinical cases.To sell the book at $140 each, W. B. Saunders insisted that Wallach add the nameof a clinical veterinarian as a co-author of the book and add an obviousclinical subtitle to enhance sales. There are far more clinicians thanpathologists in the world. Wallach was to get 90 percent of the royalties andthe clinical veterinarian ten percent. Wallach chose Dr. William Boever, aformer intern of his at the St. Louis Zoo; Boever retired thirty years later,having worked his entire professional career as the clinical veterinarian at theSt. Louis Zoo.The book, The Diseases of Exotic Animals: The Medical and Surgical Management,is found in every veterinary school and medical school library and in theprivate library of every veterinarian, wildlife expert, and zoologist and by2013 copies were being sold on the internet at prices that ranged from $400 to$10,000 depending on the condition of the book.Wallach had hoped that the 23-year collection of nutritional-deficiency truthsand their relationship to human disease in the book The Diseases of ExoticAnimals would precipitate a revolution in healthcare. Instead it has become atome, a reference book so massive that no one can afford to update the project.It is a classic that any academic professional would be proud to have authoredand published, but it didn’t stir the medical profession to incorporatenutrition into their treatment protocols. The public, of course, is almostentirely unaware of the book’s existence, so no healthcare revolution could beexpected from that quarter either.GETTING THE MESSAGE ABOUT NUTRITION DISSEMINATED TO THE PUBLIC TO CHANGEHEALTHCARE IN AMERICAWallach had done his best. He had been educated using tax-payer’s money to thetune of $7.5 million, and he had used the best science to publish peer-reviewand refereed articles in respected scientific journals, published referencebooks, and contributed chapters to multi-authored text books on the subject ofnutrition and nutritional deficiencies. In fact he was now by definition anddiverse experience and training a “polymath”; however, he still felt that he hadnot been successful in reaching his goal of changing human healthcare in Americafor the betterment of all. He knew that he had to find another way to be moreeffective in getting the message disseminated to the general public. What wouldParacelsus, Pasteur, Darwin, and Mendel do?In 1990 Wallach, along with his wife Dr. Ma Lan, published an article thatreported the details of 1,700 autopsies of Chinese children under the age oftwelve years who had died of Kheshan disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aknown selenium-deficiency disease. The purpose of the study was to see if cysticfibrosis (theorized to be a genetic disease of eastern European children)occurred in the study group. Wallach had discovered the first non-human case ofcystic fibrosis in a rhesus monkey which was proved to be caused by a congenitalselenium deficiency, and he believed that if his initial work was correct andthat cystic fibrosis was a selenium-deficiency disease, then a certain number ofChinese children who had died of Kheshan Disease (a known selenium-deficiencydisease) would have cystic fibrosis as well as cardiomyopathy.The results of the Wallach/Ma Lan Chinese Kheshan disease study was profound: 35percent (595) of the 1,700 cardiomyopathy cases also had confirmed cysticfibrosis lesions of the pancreas, lungs, and liver and surprisingly one hundredpercent exhibited the classic lesions of muscular dystrophy of the heart!Although Wallach believed that he knew the cause, prevention, and cure of humancystic fibrosis in 1977, the “truth” laid dormant until 2003, when a small girl(Sydney Myer) who at two years of age was presented to Dr. Wallach as a cysticfibrosis patient who was seriously ill. Sydney was placed on a strictgluten-free diet and given the 90 essential nutrients and extra selenium. Withinweeks she was symptom free.Wallach first worked with the Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Amish community in1993 where one of his first Amish pediatric cases was a small six-year-old boywho was born with muscular dystrophy. The boy was so weak that he moved throughthe house holding onto furniture or rolling like a log from one room to the nextusing his head and neck to propel himself. Wallach placed the child on anutritional program and a supplemental program that was made up of the 90essential nutrients and extra selenium.Upon his return to Lancaster County three months later, Wallach was lecturing ina community church building on a hot August night. Lacking electrical power, thefront and back doors of the church were open. Well into the lecture a group ofsmall boys ran from the front door though the main isle of the church and outthe back kicking a soccer ball, and in the lead was the six-year-old boy who hadapparently completely recovered from muscular dystrophy.In 2012 Wallach was contacted by Deborah Ramsey, who had a nephew (Skyler Colli)born in Italy with cystic fibrosis (Italy screens all newborn children for CF,MD and many other “genetic” diseases) and asked if Wallach had a program thatcould help the baby. Wallach recommended the 90 essential nutrients with anemphasis of extra selenium appropriate for body weight and a gluten-free diet.The “genetic marker” for cystic fibrosis is a positive sweat test, which is theabnormal readings of electrolytes in sweat. After three months on the Wallachprotocol Skyler’s positive sweat test converted to normal, according to hospitalrecords!In 2005 Wallach teamed up with Marvin Ropp, a retired Navy SEAL. Ropp had beenraised Amish in James Port, MO. At age eighteen he handed his team of horsesover to his brother, shaved his beard, and joined the U.S. Navy. After retiringfrom the navy, Ropp joined Dr. Wallach’s program to solve a personal fertilityproblem and to save the Amish colonies from exploitation by the medical system.Wallach gave a nutritional program and a supplemental recipe to Ropp and hiswife designed for infertile couples and stated, “after ninety days you will be apregnant couple.” After three years of being childless Ropp was quite skeptical,but the pregnancy occurred in four months, and Ropp decided to join the Wallachteam and take the health message back to the Amish community.Ropp pointed out to Wallach that “the Amish were being used as an ATM machine”by the medical system claiming that many diseases that afflicted the Amishcommunities were genetic.Certain communities of Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites had extremely highrates of cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy. Some families had children withboth cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy.Ropp’s ability to speak Amish Dutch and interface with the Amish culture allowedWallach to work with Amish children suffering from cystic fibrosis and musculardystrophy. Over a period of five years it became evident that there were severalfactors involved in the genesis of cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy.Almost every mother of a Kheshan disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), cysticfibrosis, and or muscular dystrophy child has clinically significant glutenintolerance. The families live in a geographical location that is known to haveselenium-deficient soil (by actual university assay); the culture has ahigh-grain diet (eaten by the Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, Kheshan Chinese,Mormons, Seventh Day Adventists, etc.) and they typically do not supplement withselenium.Over a period of five years, using dietary changes to eliminate gluten (inwheat, barley, rye, and oats) and supplementing the cystic fibrosis and musculardystrophy afflicted children and young adults with the 90 essential nutrientsplus high doses of selenium, children rapidly improve and became symptom free!In December of 2013, Wallach was notified that a four-year-old Amish boy inIndiana who had had several positive sweat tests for cystic fibrosis was broughtback to the pediatrician after months on a gluten-free diet and that Wallach’sprotocol (90 essential nutrients spiked with extra selenium) and produced aperfectly normal sweat test. His previously positive “genetic marker” had beenreversed and he had become a normal, cystic fibrosis free child.Wallach’s muscular dystrophy data was sent to Jerry Lewis in 2010 to see if hewanted to be the person to make the announcement, “In fact we now know thecause, prevention, and cure for cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy.” Violet,Mr. Lewis’s assistant, acknowledged that Mr. Lewis had received the data in bothe-mail and hard copy format and would review the material. We did not want moneyfrom the Muscular Dystrophy Foundation; however, it felt right to offer theopportunity to Jerry Lewis to make the announcement that the cause, prevention,and cure of muscular dystrophy had been found and proved in clinical trials tobe correct—in fact the cure for MD had been found for “Jerry’s Kids”!Mr. Lewis, it seems, took the data to the medical committee of the MuscularDystrophy Foundation, but they refused to review the data and fired Jerry Lewisfor insisting that they interview Wallach and Ropp to see if there was anyvalidity or value that might benefit “Jerry’s Kids.” They fired Jerry Lewis!!They sent him on a cruise to prevent him from being available to reporters whowould inquire as to why he didn’t for the first time in twenty-two yearsparticipate in the MD Telethon to raise money to find the cure for MD andJerry’s Kids.In 2013 Todd Harrison, a 24-year-old muscular dystrophy patient from Stockton,California, reported to Wallach that he had been on Wallach’s protocol formuscular dystrophy for six months, and through the Internet he had documentedhis clinical improvement through regular video updates on Facebook. He hadattracted 2,700 muscular dystrophy patients and families who were following hisprogress, and many had opted to follow Wallach’s protocol for the reversal andprevention of muscular dystrophy.Before starting on the Wallach Protocol, Todd could do 30 curls with a fivepound dumb bell in three minutes with his left arm. After one year on theWallach Protocol he could do 30 curls with the five-pound dumbbell with his leftarm in 33 seconds, and his walking gait is significantly improved.Todd, his mother, and her brother, David, (who also had muscular dystrophy)formed a not for profit organization called “Defying Muscular Dystrophy.” By thetime they had met Wallach, they had raised $50,000 for a FDA approved study thatlooked at a medical device that was an electronic muscle stimulator used for thepurpose of toning up weak muscles in muscular dystrophy patients.Layne Chavez, an 18-year-old young man, introduced himself to Wallach at a LongBeach, California Health Expo, started on the Wallach Protocol for MuscularDystrophy, and in six months went from being wheelchair-bound for eight years toriding an adult tricycle on the street.In July of 2013, Wallach was appointed as the Chairman of the ScientificAdvisory Board for the not-for-profit Defying Muscular Dystrophy organization.In 1994 Wallach began to use KSCO, a Santa Cruz, California AM radio station, tobroadcast an interactive talk show to spread his message of self-help andsupplementation of the 90 essential nutrients to prevent and reverse humandiseases.The radio show was called “Dead Doctors Don’t Lie” after the s uccessful launchof an audio cassette of the same title. The introduction started with “Hello,welcome to Dead Doctors Don’t Lie. This is Dr. Joel Wallach, your host, aveterinarian and physician . . .” It wasn’t long before the county medicalassociation launched a lawsuit to charge Wallach with unlawfully using the word“physician” to identify himself.Wallach obtained a certified copy of his degree from NCNM declaring him as agraduate naturopathic physician and a certified copy of his current Oregonlicense declaring him a licensed naturopathic physician in good standing. Thelawsuit was dropped, and Wallach was never again harassed by the medicalcommunity of California, and in 2005 the state of California passed theNaturopathic Practice Act allowing the licensure of Naturopathic Doctors in theState of California. Dr. Wallach’s California license number is 061.In 1997 Wallach was contacted by Lauren Knievel, the niece-in-law of EvelKnievel (the famous dare devil). She was two and a half months pregnant, and herembryo had been diagnosed with Down syndrome at the two and one half month stageby both an amniocentesis and an ultrasound by two separate laboratories. Shewanted to avoid an abortion that many were recommending.This was the first time that Wallach had to answer the question, “can the embryobe saved and the Down syndrome ‘gene defect’ be reversed?”Wallach answered that he didn’t know; he had never been asked before tointervene in an early pregnancy to save an embryo. He told her, however, if shewanted to try, he was willing to try and would do his best.Wallach knew that they must work quickly, as the window of time that would allowa reversal of such a ‘genetic defect’ may have already passed. Wallach puttogether a formula of all the known 90 essential nutrients and the very day thatLauren Knievel posed the question, “Can the gene defect that caused the Downsyndrome in her embryo be reversed?” she began to consume the 90 essentialnutrients.Lauren Knievel’s baby was born a full-term perfectly healthy baby—the Downsyndrome “genetic defect” had been reversed!In 1996 Theo Ratliff, a 28-year-old NBA basketball player, was told his careerwas over. Theo at a young age had bone-on-bone arthritis in both knees, thecartilage on his right hip had popped off, and the orthopedic surgeon for theAtlanta Hawks stated that the injury required surgery to replant the cartilage.His right wrist was broken catching a pass during a regular season game, and theorthopedic surgeons for the Atlanta Hawks said, “We can’t sign off on Theo. He’stoo much of a risk— he’s too fragile to play professional NBA basketball.”Theo was cleaning out his locker in the Hawks’ training facility when he heardMike Glen, “The Stinger,” the legendary guard for the Hawks talking to anotherplayer about rebuilding his own knees with Wallach’s supplement program (Glenhad regrown his knee cartilage in both knees after retirement and had declared,“I could have played for five more years if I had known about Wallach’s programearlier !”). Ratliff walked over to Glen and asked if he thought that Wallach’sprogram could also help him. Glen replied in the affirmative, and Glen startedRatliff on the program. Ratliff passed all of the physicals, and the next seasonhe was given a $40 million contract with the Portland Trail Blazers! In 2012Ratliff finished his professional career of sixteen years after three years withthe Los Angeles Lakers.In 1998 Wallach was giving a lecture in Salt Lake, Utah, to a room packed with300 eager attendees, when during the question and answer period, a man enquiredabout his mother who had been declared legally blind for eight years as a resultof chronic macular degeneration, and he asked, “Can anything be done to restoremy mother’s eyesight even though she has been declared legally blind as a resultof macular degeneration?”Wallach replied, “Macular degeneration is easy to prevent and easy to reversewith a dietary change and a complete supplement program that includes a heavyantioxidant approach, as macular degeneration was due to the accumulation of“ceroid lipofucin,” a pigment caused by free radical damage to the retina of theeye.” Immediately a man jumped in the back of the room and yelled, “Wallach,you’re a liar! I am an eye doctor and there is no way that you can prevent orcure macular degeneration, as it is due to aging and there is no way to preventor cure it.”Wallach Asked, “Who are you?” To which the doctor replied, “I am Dr. RonaldPugh.” Wallach then challenged Dr. Pugh, “Give me twelve of your maculardegeneration patients who have been legally blind for eight to ten years, and ifI can get half (6) to be able to read 20/20 in ninety days, will you apologize?”Dr. Pugh responded, “If you can get two out of twelve to be able to read 20/20in ninety days I will apologize!” The next day Dr. Pugh brought a box full oftwenty-seven charts of patients who had been declared legally blind for eight toten years because of macular degeneration. Wallach took all twenty-seven, gaveeach his 90 nutrient/antioxidant program for macular degeneration, and in ninetydays all twenty-seven could read 20/20 and only two required glasses! Dr. Pughkept his word and produced an apology on a CD entitled, “Seeing is Believing!”Later in 1998, Wallach was introduced to Elaine Iagotta, who was diagnosed tenyears earlier with primary sclerosing cholangitis, a form of liver cirrhosisthat caused the death of NFL great Walter Payton, and for which the preferredmedical treatment was to install stints into the bile ducts to prevent them frombeing crushed by scar tissue and surgically remove as much damaged liver aspossible until a liver transplant became necessary. Iagotta had had 12 majorliver surgeries at the Harvard Teaching Hospital prior to meeting Wallach andwas on the liver transplant list.Wallach put Iagotta on a gluten-free anti-inflammatory diet and added the 90essential nutrient supplement program spiked with selenium and mega doses of Bvitamins. In sixty days she had regrown her liver to normal size, canceled theplans for a liver transplant, and went back to a normal life.A presentation was scheduled at the Harvard Medical School Campus to shareElaine Iagotta’s story with the faculty who were quite familiar with her plight.In spite of individual invitations to the faculty, not a single one appeared forthe event.Wallach continued to give 300 free lectures each year to spread the informationabout nutrition and how it could reverse diseases thought to be genetic by themedical system. This allowed Wallach to have an interface with the generalpublic throughout the world and have the opportunity to treat the untreatablewith nutrition.Wallach had been giving hundreds of lectures in Canada for over fifteen years,and in 2008 he was in Moose Jaw Canada giving his standard lecture when on thisoccasion a couple approached him before the meeting started and asked for help.The wife did the talking as the husband was in the advanced stages ofParkinson’s disease. The man’s name was David Dietrich, and he had a severetotal body palsy that was unremitting. David was a very wealthy man; however,his doctors had essentially given up on him and were in a hospice mode “waitingfor the inevitable.”By the time Dietrich had shown up Wallach had successfully treated numerouspeople with multiple sclerosis, ALS, and Parkinson’s disease. Dietrich was a bigman, weighing 260 pounds, and thus required a rather large amount of nutrientsto achieve the desired effect.In addition to the 90 essential nutrients (Dietrich was dosed for a 300 poundhuman), Wallach administered products to increase brain circulation and increaseenergy conversion in the brain, and he administered nutrients that were the rawmaterials for the brain to manufacture neurotransmitters and nutrients thatincreased antioxidant power.In addition to the supplement program, Dietrich was admonished to avoidtrans-fatty acids, heterocyclic amines, and acrylamides to stop ongoing damage,and he was instructed to eat at least twelve to fourteen poached eggs each dayto provide raw materials for the rebuilding of myelin.Three months later Wallach returned to Moose Jaw Canada for follow-up meetings,and Dietrich showed up at the meeting. He was excited, energetic, and totallysymptom free! He thanked Wallach profusely and introduced him to the regionaldirectors for Sun Life of Canada, who had come to meet the doctor who hadwrought Dietrich’s miracle recovery, as they thought that “Wallach hadhypnotized Dietrich into thinking he was cured.”When Wallach asked the Sun Life representatives, “Would you consider payingdoctors for following the nutrition program that reversed Dietrich’s Parkinson’sdisease?” the Sun Life representatives replied, “There is no way we could dothat, even though it would save us money; the doctors would drive their patientsto other insurance companies.”In 2008 Wallach was lecturing in Gary, Indiana, and upon return to his hotel at1:00 AM., he was met in the lobby by Pastor Tyrone Crider and his wife Regina.Crider stated that he was referred to Wallach by Martin Luther King III. The twomen had been roommates at Morehouse College as young men and Wallach had helpedMartin with his own health challenges. Crider, six feet tall and weighing 300pounds, was suffering from coronary artery disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,and congestive heart failure. Additionally, he had many complications, was on 27prescription drugs, and had been getting a half-day full physical (for which hepaid $5,000 cash for each physical) every Friday for three years “to be preparedif a heart becomes available.”Inspecting the 27 prescriptions, Wallach noted that three of them were differentdiuretics (water pills, including Lasix) with three different modes of action,yet Crider’s chest and belly were full of fluid which made him breathless andunable to walk five feet without holding on to the backs of chairs and stoppingto catch his breath. This meant that he was probably having an absorptionproblem and could not even absorb the prescriptions.Wallach put Crider on a gluten-free diet, eliminated all inflammatory foods(fried foods, oils, processed meats, etc.), and put him on a supplement program(90 essential nutrients, selenium, amino acids, and mega doses of B-complexvitamins) for a 300 pound man. One week later Crider went for his regular weeklyphysical.On the following Friday, Crider’s cardiologist called his wife and asked to haveCrider to return to redo the physical as they felt they had mixed his lab workwith some other person’s lab work and admonished her not to give her husband anymedications, and, “Oh, by-the-way send an additional $5,000 cash.”On re-examination, Crider’s cardiologist took him off of all 27 prescriptionsand took him off of the heart transplant list after only five days on a dietchange, and Wallach’s 90 essential nutrients!Later in 2009 Wallach was giving lectures in Cook County Illinois near the townof Naperville when he received a call from a man who identified himself as JoeyLevy. He said he and his brother Steve wanted to take him out to lunch becausethe information on Wallach’s Dead Doctors Don’t Lie audio cassette had helpedhis brother reverse “an inoperable and terminal seven centimeter aortic aneurismwith the 90 essential nutrients” and they wanted to take Wallach out to lunch tothank him.Joey sent a limo to pick up Wallach and his four-member staff and related thestory. After the dinner, Joey’s brother asked what he could do for Wallach inreturn for saving his life, to which Wallach replied, “Fire your doctor.” Stevecalled his secretary Christina and instructed her to fire his doctor of 20years, upon which Wallach said, “We are now even.”In 2013 Steve Levy had a physical that included an angiogram, as he historicallyhad had a ninety-eight percent blockage of the main descending coronary artery.The results of the angiogram showed that his artery was 100 percent clear andopen!In 2010 Wallach was giving lectures in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, and through amutual friend he was invited to meet with Dr. Jerry Murphy for a breakfast.Murphy owned Gama Labs, a large medical laboratory that provided analyticalservices for thousands of hospitals and medical offices throughout America eachday. Murphy was afflicted with serious brittle and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.Murphy, as the owner and operator of a large interstate medical laboratory, hadaccess to the most highly trained endocrinologists, the most cutting edgediabetes research, and the most advanced medicines, was in trouble—he justcouldn’t get his diabetes under control and stabilized.Murphy said that he would give Wallach a chance to “show his stuff,” and if itworked they would be best friends and he would put his staff on Wallach’s 90 forLife nutritional program and self-insure for only the serious catastrophicdiseases. If Wallach failed, Murphy said he “would be determined to destroyWallach and roast him before medical groups everywhere.” Wallach agreed toMurphy’s challenge without hesitation, which literally startled Murphy.To make a long story short, Wallach put Murphy on his standard “Healthy BloodSugar Pak” appropriate for his body weight, admonished Murphy to do a fastingblood sugar test each morning before he medicated himself, and told him tocontact Wallach every two months with his fasting blood sugar and A1C labresults.Murphy followed Wallach’s instructions and had his blood work duplicated byseveral of his own laboratories under a false name so that the results would notbe tainted and so that one test result could be compared with the result fromanother lab.Jerry Murphy’s Blood Sugar and AIC Test Resultsimage [../images/00010.jpeg]It was obvious to the most ardent critic that Wallach’s program had reversedMurphy’s diabetes. And in keeping his part of the agreement, Murphy put hisemployee’s on Wallach’s nutritional program and self-insured Gama Labs, whichsaves Murphy’s Gama Labs millions of dollars each year!In February of 2012 Debbie Ramsey, one of Wallach’s associates, called andinformed him that her sister who lived in Italy had given birth to a small boynamed Skyler, who had a positive sweat test (“the genetic marker for cysticfibrosis”) during the standard screen at birth for genetic diseases by the MeyerUniversity Hospital. She asked if there was anything that could be done for hernephew.Wallach recommended a gluten-free diet and the basic 90 essential nutrientsupplement program with extra selenium appropriate for body weight. In April2012, two months later, a rerun of the sweat test was negative, and in June2012, two months after that, it remained negative. The diet and supplementprogram had apparently reversed the “genetic marker” for cystic fibrosis."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENEPIGENETIC MANIFESTATIONS OF DISEASEThere it was, arrayed before us, the instruction manual for making a human.Anyone may read this manual—it is freely available on the Web. But it is hardlyworth the bother. The average Englishman may as well attempt the Analects ofConfucius in the original for all the wisdom it imparts. Even geneticists findits contents baffling. When they scan the genome they find, here and there,words whose meanings are clear enough. The meanings of others can be guessed at,perhaps because they are cognates of more familiar ones. Some of the grammar,the syntactical rules by which genes combine to give their utterances meaning,is understood as well. But the syntax of genes is vastly more complex, moresubtle and nuanced, than that of any language spoken by man. And though itsliterature is not exactly a closed book, it is one we have scarcely begun toread.—Armand Marie LeroiMU(T)AN(T)SOn February 15, 2001, a team of international geneticists announced that theyhad mapped out the human genome. Human reproduction, development, and life spanwas driven by the language of some 30,000 genes.To fully understand the language of the genes one must employ a Rosetta Stonethat can teach the alphabet, vocabulary, grammar, punctuation, syntax, andstructure of the biochemical sentence, paragraph, chapter, and book of the DNA.The reason that the successful functional employment of the “mapped out” humangenome has fallen short of hopes and expectations by the medical community isthat the geneticists have tried to understand the contents of the DNA book byopening it to the last page, reading the last paragraph, spelling the last word,and then shouting “Eureka!”In fact, if one wants to understand human development and human disease we haveto look at the DNA book before the pen is put to paper. Life does not begin atconception; it begins in the 23 chromosomes of the father and the 23 chromosomesof the mother. And of equal importance to the production of a viable andanatomically and biochemically functional and “perfect” zygote is thenutritional status of the DNA. To function properly, it is imperative for theDNA to constantly have access to all 90 essential nutrients (60 minerals, 16vitamins, 12 amino acids and 3 fatty acids), and each one must be available inoptimal amounts and in the proper ratios to each other. The DNA and theassociated genes are not independent, free-standing proteins that can work in avacuum. They each require energy, raw materials, and on/off switchingco-factors.Elements in Dry Nuclei, DNA and Mitochondria from Mammalian Tissueimage [../images/00011.jpeg]From Wallach, J.D. and Ma, L. Rare Earths: Forbidden Cures, 1994UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES OF CONGENITAL DISORDERS IN HUMANSIf any disruption occurs in the availability of or access to these nutritionalelements for the proper functioning of the DNA and or genes, the zygote,gastrula, embryo, and fetus will be dramatically affected, to possibly causePKU, enzyme system deficiencies, “inborn errors of metabolism,” Down syndrome,cerebral palsy, cleft palate, neural tube defects, hernias, congenital deafness,heart defects, kidney defects, genital defects, facial defects, limb and digitdefects, conjoined twins, gay behavior (as a result of hypoplasia of thepre-optic hypothalamus), hermaphrodites, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis,etc.The first chapter of the DNA Book is entitled “Conception,” assuming a perfectnutritional status of the zygote, it will, by the seventh day followingconception, begin to burrow itself into the endometrial lining of the uterus insearch of additional nutrition and oxygen. If all goes well, by the ninth daythe cells within the hollow embryonic ball will begin to differentiate intoseparate layers. This process requires an enormous amount and an uninterruptedflow of specific biochemical nutrition; any elemental deficiency at this pointwill be catastrophic to the embryo.The second chapter in the DNA book is entitled “Gastrulation” and is about whatoccurs 13 days following conception when the embryonic ball is completelyimmersed in the engorged endometrium and has begun the differentiation process.Then the small cluster of cells within the ball is the pre-fetus, thesurrounding cells are becoming the placenta, umbilical cord, and the amnioticsac. At this point the embryo is a simple disc; a groove appears, and this“primitive streak” becomes functional, and migrating cells begin to gravitate toit like lemmings responding to a call only heard by them; this process producesa three-layer embryo, the gastrula.The surface layer becomes the ectoderm (skin and central nervous system), themiddle layer becomes the mesoderm (muscle, bone, connective tissue) and theinner layer, which becomes the endoderm, differentiates into thegastro-intestinal tract, pancreas, spleen, liver, etc. Many body parts, organs,and tissues are alloys and mosaics of the ectoderm and mesoderm (limbs, kidneys,breasts, teeth, and genitalia). The embryo has now transitioned from a disc intoa vertebrate. It has a head, a tail, ventral and dorsal aspects and a right andleft orientation.At 18 days of age the embryo is a white oval disc approximately one millimeterin length along its axis. There are no clearly defined organs at that point;however, the three tissue layers and a definite geometry have emerged. Within 28to 30 days the embryo is recognizable as human with a head, neck, spinal column,GI tract, and a heart. It forms a trough, then the edges fold together, and bythe 23rd day it is to become a tube which evolves into the central nervoussystem (the brain and spinal cord); the mesoderm at this point clearly surroundsthe neural tube to become the forty-four vertebrae, muscles, and the dermas ofthe skin; the ventral surface of the embryo and its yolk sac is pulled up intothe embryo and evolves into the GI tract; the right and left edges of the embryojoin together ventrally to form the abdominal cavity. It will soon become whatWilliam Harvey described as “The Foundation of Life, the Prince of All, the Sunof the Microcosm, on which all vegetation doth depend, from whence all Vigor andStrength doth flow.” The myocardial cells begin to beat at 21 days.According to historians, Cleopatra had a sequence of pregnant slave girlsexecuted and dissected to track the development of the human embryo in anattempt to understand human development.In March of 1512, Lucca Landucci, a Florentine apothecary, entered into hisdiary: “It was evident what evil the monster’s birth had meant for them! Itseems as if some great misfortune always befalls the city when such things areborn.”Landucci, himself, had not actually seen the “monster” as it had been orderedstarved to death by Julius II, and so Landucci’s comments were based on drawingsof the infant’s congenital malformations.Printed drawings, woodcuts, and engravings spread the alarm of the monster’sbirth, and as the news spread rapidly through Europe. Originally, the monster,born in Ravenna, had two legs, but when it arrived in Paris only one remained;in some drawings it had bat-like wings; in others the wings were more bird-like;the monster had hermaphrodite genitalia.Many drawings of the Ravenna monster evolved into a blend with another monsterthat had been reported in Florence in 1506. In some drawings the monster wascombined with a medieval “icon of sinful humanity—‘Frau Welt’— a winged harpywho was depicted as clutching the earth in a talon-foot. Rumors were that “thechild-monster was the product of a respectable married woman”; other accountsprofessed that “the monster was the product of an affair between a nun and afriar.”The monster was born during a time when Northern Italy was at war; Maximillianof Germany and Louis XII of France were warring against the Spanish, English,and Pope Julius II for control of the Venetian Republic. Village after villagewas raped and burned as each army passed. Ravenna surrendered eighteen daysfollowing the monster’s birth.Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries “monsters,” babies born with severecongenital defects, were quite common. Royalty collected their mummies asconversation pieces, biologist recorded them, and theologians wove them intoreligious fairy-tails.In 1523 Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon distributed a pamphlet whichreported a malformed “Monk-Calf” born in Freiburg and another monster that hadbeen hauled out of the Tiber River. It laid blame for the monster’s appearanceon the “Roman Church’s corruption.” The Catholic Church responded by claimingthat “the calf was in fact Luther.”In 1557 Conrad Lycosthenes of Germany published his book, Prodigiorum acostentorum chronicum (The Doome, calling all men to judgment).In 1560 Pierre Boaistuau of France published his book, Histories prodigieuses(History of prodigies, 1560–1582). The book is filled with “demonic creatures,”and in addition to a vivid description of the Monster of Ravenna it describedthe Monster of Cracow, an infant born with “barking dog’s heads mounted on itselbows, chest and knees,” and four hours later as it died exclaimed, “Watch, theLord cometh.”In 1573 Ambroise Paré published his book, Des monsters et prodigies (Monstersand prodigies). Here a more “scientific” explanation for the appearance ofmonsters is offered. Parisian surgeon Par’e catalogues the causes of monsters:(1) the wrath of God; (2) having sex with animals, which would result inhuman/animal hybrids; (3) sex during menstruation; (4) impressions, such as apregnant woman looking at an ugly sight during pregnancy; (5) too much or toolittle semen, narrow womb, or indecency.In 1616 Fortunio Leceti published his book, De monstrorum natura caussis etdifferentiis (On the nature, causes and differences of monsters).In 1642 Ulisse Aldrovandi published his book, Monstrorum historia (History ofmonsters).In the 16th and 17th centuries, religious expressions conflicted with secularthinking. Revolution and schisms dominated the theological world and theappearance of monsters (congenital birth defects) would be interpreted as a signof divine punishment or Satan’s intervention.William Harvey, following his documentation of the mechanics of the circulationof blood, spent his time trying to determine how animals developed. In 1642Harvey documented the development of chick embryos. Harvey often wrote on thecauses of the births of monsters. He reinvestigated Aristotle’s claim thatchicks that hatched as monsters were the product of eggs with two yolks.Sir Francis Bacon, a contemporary of Harvey, stated, “We must make a collectionof particular natural history of all the monsters and prodigious products ofnature, of every novelty, rarity, or abnormality.”Rudolf II and Frederick II of Austria collected unusual products of natureduring the 16th century. Ulisse Aldrovandi, a naturalist, accumulated acollection of oddities that reached 18 thousand specimens in his museum inBologna.Bacon was a physician-philosopher. In 1620 he wrote Novum organum in which heclassified natural history, and he stated that, “We should study deviantinstances, for once a nature has been observed in its variations, and the reasonfor it has been made clear, it will be an easy matter to bring that nature byart to the point it reached by chance.”In 1890 the city of Amsterdam purchased Willem Vrolik’s anatomical collectionfor the price of 12,000 guilders. It contained 5103 specimens including thebodies and parts of 360 adults and infants that were afflicted with congenitaldefects; some were articulated skeletons and others were preserved in alcohol orformaldehyde.The Vrolik collection is one of many teratological collections that wereassembled during the 18th and 19th centuries. There is also the Guy collectionin London, the Gordon collection held at St. Thomas’s Hospital, the Hunteriancollection housed at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Muttercollection found in Philadelphia, and Paris has Museum d’Histoire Naturelle andthe Orfila and Dupuytren collections.Between 1844 and 1849 Willem Vrolik published a folio entitled, Tabulae adillustrandam embryogenesin hominis et mammalium tam naturalem quam abnormem(Plates demonstrating normal and abnormal development in man and mammals):There is a cabinet containing children with acute failures in neural tubefusion. Their backs are cleaved open and their brains spill from their skulls.Across the gallery is a series of conjoined twins, one of which has a parasitictwin almost as large as himself protruding from the roof of his mouth. And nextto them is a specimen labeled “Acardia amorphus,” a skin-covered sphere withnothing to hint at the child it almost became except for a small umbilical cord,a bit of intestine, and the rudiments of a vertebral column.The teratological lithographs of the Vrolik collection feature human and animalfetuses. The most unusual are those that have only one eye, a single eye locatedin their forehead, and he named the defect after the Greek cosmology, Cyclops.Vrolik had studied the cycloptic monster for more than ten years and published asignificant monograph on the subject. The Vrolik cyclops collection is comprisedof twenty-four specimens: eight pigs, ten lambs, five humans, and a kitten.Instead of two separate brain hemispheres, the brain of a cycloptic child isfused into a single non-divided whole called holoproencephaly. It is the mostcommon brain deformity of humans, appearing in 1:16,000 live births and 1: 200miscarriages.There are many events that can easily cause the cycloptic defect, such asexposure of the embryo to heat, cold, radiation, hypoxia, ether, chloroform,acetone, phenol, butyric acid, lithium chloride, retinoic acid, alcohol, ortable salt.In the 1950s an epidemic of cycloptic lambs in the western United States wasprecipitated by pregnant ewes grazing on corn lilies, a subalpine plant thatproduces an alkaloid. Diabetic and alcoholic mothers-to-be have an increasedrisk of having a cycloptic child by 200 times.In 1894 William Bateson published his book, Materials for the Study ofVariation: Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of theSpecies, in which he coins the term “homeosis.” Homeosis is manifested by theappearance of extra parts: babies with extra ears, heifers with extra teats,five-winged moths, eight-legged beetles, and lobsters that have antennae whereeyes should be found.The homeosis transformation concept led Bateson to the “calculator of fate.” Thecalculator of fate was first observed in fruit flies. Fruit flies, in a similarfashion to earthworms are built of segments. Segments in the adult fruit fly arespecialized; head segments feature labial palps (eating parts) and antennae thatprovides the sense of smell; thoracic segments feature the wings, legs, andhalters (balance organs); the abdominal segments do not have any appendages.Through an eighty-year period of study, geneticists have identified dozens ofmutations (homeotic genes) that disrupt the identities of the segments: legs onthe head, loss of the sense of smell, halters transformed into wings,four-winged dipterans, wings that become halters that doom the fly to aterrestrial, flightless life.Human and animal limbs exhibit a high rate of congenital deformities; there aremore named congenital defects of limbs than for any other structure or organ.There is the “lobster claw” syndrome; the “split-hand-split-foot” syndrome(“ectrodactyly,” Greek for monstrous fingers); the Ostrich-Footed People (theWadoma people of the upper reaches of the Zambesi); polydactyly (extra fingersand toes); syndactyly (webbed fingers and toes); limbs totally absent;acheiropody (Greek for absence of the hands and feet); “seal-limb” (Thalidomideteratogenesis).Ernest Hemingway’s cats were polydactylous and their polydactylous progeny stilllive in the yard of his Key West house. Fifteen percent of the feral cats inBoston are polydactylous. One in three thousand Europeans are polydactylous and1:300 Africans are polydactylous.A catastrophic teratogenic event was reported in 1961. William McBride, anAustralian physician, reported an uptick in the rate of babies born withcongenitally deformed limbs. In just a few months, a German physician (Lenz),reported a series of similar births. Both doctors believed that the defects werecaused by the use of a sedative (phtalimido-glutarimide) by the trade nameThalidomide (the third-best selling pharmaceutical in Europe).Because of the reports of “seal-limb,” a congenital limb defect produced by thematernal use of Thalidomide in forty-six countries, the FDA refused to allow itssale; however, the genie was out of the bottle in America. Millions of doses ofThalidomide were given free to American women as part of a research anddevelopment program.The Thalidomide babies displayed a very specific form of limb defect. Differentfrom acheiropods, their limbs were not “amputated in the womb,” as many hadnormal hands and feet, shoulder blades, and pelvis, but they were missing theirupper arms and forearms, which caused the hands and feet to become directlyattached to their torso.Congenital events and birth defects of the central nervous system (thoseoccurring in cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, hydroencephalaloceol, neural tubedefects, gayness, etc.), for the most part are manifestations of a maternalnutritional deficiency during a certain point in time of early embryonicdevelopment.More difficult to understand than the physical birth defects are the biochemicaldefects (inborn errors of metabolism, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy,etc.), behavioral, learning and emotional defects that are preventable withoptimal preconception nutrition for the embryo. The principals for preventingthe “Bad Seeds,” the children with emotional and learning defects, are the sameas those for preventing the physical birth defects. Children without aconscience (sociopaths), violent behavior, dyslexia, retardation, fetal alcoholor drug syndrome, ADD, ADHD, autism, and congenital homosexuality are allpreventable for a few pennies per pregnancy, but expensive and difficult to dealwith medically and politically after the fact.THE PREVENTION AND CURE FOR SO-CALLED “GENETIC” DISEASESIn fact, there are dozens of human diseases classified as “genetic” that can beprevented, and in the early stages reversed or “cured,” with the supplementationof specific minerals. Five very good examples of “genetic” diseases that can beprevented and cured are type 2 diabetes, Huntington’s disease, cystic fibrosis,muscular dystrophy, and Kawasaki Disease.Type 2 DiabetesType 2 diabetes should be the number one shame of the medical system in the 20thcentury. Type 2 diabetes is easy to prevent and treat and easy to cure. There isno need for the terrible side effects and complications of blindness,hypertension, amputations, early death, and so forth.Since 1958 it has been well documented that supplementation of the 90 essentialnutrients along with chromium and vanadium to an otherwise perfect diet willprevent and cure hypoglycemia, reactive hypoglycemia (narcolepsy),hyperinsulinemia, and type 2 diabetes. Walter Mertz, the director of theU.S.D.A. field services, published the results of his research in FederationProceedings that showed clearly that an entire medical specialty (endocrinology)would be wiped out by universally adding chromium to an otherwise perfect diet.Type 2 diabetes is not a genetically-transmitted disease—it is in fact a simplemineral deficiency!In 1985 the medical school at the University of Vancouver, BC, Canada, statedthat “vanadium will replace insulin therapy for adult onset diabetics.”In contrast to this, in the United States in 2012, instead of pennies toeliminate type 2 diabetes by a simple supplementation program, the medicalapproach of genetics, pharmaceutical therapies, and surgery costs the Americaneconomy more than $245 billion or one quarter of a trillion dollars yearly, a41% increase from $174 billion in 2007.The Centers for Disease Control and the American Diabetes Association reportedin 2013 that almost 26 million American children and adults have diabetes (8.3%of total U.S. population); 18.8 million are diagnosed and 7 million areundiagnosed.There are two major types of diabetes (type 2 and type 1). In adults, type 2accounts for 95% of all diagnosed cases; 79 million more Americans arepre-diabetics.Symptoms of diabetes include thirst, hunger, fatigue, blurry vision, delayedhealing of wounds, and frequent urination. Individuals who are obese, seniors,and have a family history of diabetes are at a higher risk; additionally AfricanAmericans, Mexican Americans. and Native Americans are at increased risk.In April 2013 a published study in the journal Diabetes Care reported that thedirect medical costs totaled $176 billion, reflecting hospital and emergencycare, office visits, and medications. Indirect costs added up to $69 billion,which included absenteeism, reduced and lost productivity, and unemploymentcaused by diabetes-related disability. The study also noted that, governmentinsurance, including Medicaid, Medicare, and the Veteran’s Administrationcovered 62.4% of the costs of diabetes care; private insurance covered 34.4%,and 3.2% was paid by the uninsured.Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is an important, potentially fatal disease of animals andhumans, which was originally thought to be transmitted by a simple Mendeliangenetic defect limited to white populations of Central and Eastern Europeanorigin; today CF has been diagnosed in virtually all peoples of the earthincluding Blacks, Chinese, Asians, Native Americans, Hispanics, etc.In 1977 Wallach discovered and documented the first non-human case of CF in arhesus monkey at the Yerkes Primate Research Center at Emory University inAtlanta, Georgia. His discovery was at first lauded by Emory University and anofficial news release was sent to all of the major media. As soon as Wallachrevealed that CF was actually a nutritional deficiency of the trace-mineralselenium that could be prevented, reversed, and cured with supplementalselenium, he was summarily terminated from his position as a pathologist at theYerkes facility in April of 1978.In the 1980s a concerted effort to identify “the CF gene” led to three claims ofthe gene’s discovery. However, after close scrutiny, the earlier two claims werediscounted by the general scientific community because the studies were based onlinked DNA markers whose exact relationship to CF were not certain; the thirdclaim (September 8. 1989, Science) is of particular interest because the authorsestimate only 46% accuracy in identifying CF in patients from families without aprevious history of CF and a 68% accuracy in identifying CF patients in familieswith a history of CF. The authors go on to state that “it is probable that thiscondition (CF) is also determined by other genetic or non-genetic factors” andthat “the basic biochemical defect of CF is yet to be defined.”The misunderstanding and ignorance about the cause and treatment of cysticfibrosis is “the crime of the 20th century,” second only to our lack ofknowledge of type 2 diabetes, and that is only because diabetes affects millionsof Americans and CF affects thousands each year.Classically, the diagnosis of CF is made by employing any two of four recognizedcriteria, but most clinicians are reluctant to make a diagnosis of CF without apositive sweat test.Four Criteria for the Clinical Diagnosis of Cystic FibrosisExocrine pancreatic insufficiencyBronchiectasis/asthmaPositive sweat testFamily history of CFFrom Wallach, J.D. and Ma, L. Rare Earths: Forbidden Cures, 1994The sweat test has been elevated by medical dogma to “the geneticmarker/diagnostic test” for CF, yet there are no less than eighteen knowndiseases and syndromes that also give a positive sweat test, leading at leastone group of investigators from the Cleveland Rainbow Children’s Hospital torefer to “CF as a syndrome (collection of diseases) rather than a disease.”Diseases and Syndromes That Reported Positive Sweat TestAdrenal insufficiencyEctodermal dysplasiaNephrogenic diabetes insipidusGlucose-6-phosphate deficiencyPupillatonia/autonomic dysfunctionAllergiesCalcifying pancreatitisAnorexia nervosaCystic fibrosisFocal hepatic cirrhosisDefect in prostaglandin metabolismHypothyroidismFucosidosisMucopolysaccharidosisMalnutritionKwashiorkorDiabetesGluten intoleranceFrom Wallach, J.D. and Ma, L. Rare Earths: Forbidden Cures, 1994Initially described in 1933, CF was originally thought to be the result ofavitaminosis A (a vitamin A deficiency), because of specific vitamin Adeficiency changes found in a subgroup of young patients diagnosed clinicallywith celiac disease.In 1938 the term “cystic fibrosis” was coined because of a cellular atrophy inthe pancreas that reminded the pathologist of “cysts” when viewed under themicroscope.In 1952 the fact that congenital CF occurred in newborns in a significant numberof CF patients was established.The genetic theory of CF transmission was suggested by the congenital nature ofCF, as described in two previously published papers. The first, a publicationthat appeared in 1913, was a case report of two children from a family of fivewho were born to a couple who were first cousins. One child died at the age ofeleven months from dehydration and diarrhea (no autopsy was performed); thesecond was an eight-year-old child who had diarrhea at the time of the article’sappearance. The author theorized that the clinical problem was “an inborn errorof fat metabolism” and “probably the result the result of a simple Mendeliangene defect.” This “from the hip” theory was enough to make the medical systemdogmatically classify CF as a genetic disease!The second paper of interest to the proponents of the genetic theory of CFtransmission was an epidemiological study of 232 Australian families, in which24.3% were diagnosed with CF. Six sets of twins, three identical and threefraternal, failed to shed clear light on the proposed genetic transmission.It was well established by 1975 that the rate and severity of the pancreatic,liver, heart, lung and intestinal changes in CF, as well as the appearance ofthe positive sweat test were age and time related.Age and Time as Factors in the Severity of Laboratory Changes in CFimage [../images/00012.jpeg]From Wallach, J.D. and Ma. L. Rare Earths: Forbidden Cures, 1994In 1978 the first universally accepted diagnosis of non-human CF was made (byWallach) from the pancreas and liver of an infant rhesus monkey. The original CFmonkey and two unrelated age peers (diagnosed with pancreatic and liver biopsy)were created iatrogenically (accidentally) by a selenium-deficient diet fed to anormal breeding group of monkeys at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Centerdestined for NASA space programs.Wallach’s diagnosis of CF in the rhesus monkey was confirmed by pediatricpathologists, considered to be experts on CF, from Grady Memorial Hospital,Emory University, Atlanta, GA; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins School ofMedicine, Baltimore, MD; Department of Pathology, Chicago-Lying-In Hospital,School of Medicine, University of Chicago.Initially there was great excitement by everyone, including representatives ofthe CF Foundation until they learned that the CF in the monkeys could bereproduced with a selenium deficient diet. When the proposal was put forth thatthe pathognomonic (unique identifying changes) pancreatic lesions of CF, as wellas the liver and heart changes (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) of CF, were in factthe result of a prenatal selenium deficiency, everyone came unglued, claiming“CF was a genetic disease and that was that!”Wallach’s original proposal that CF could be caused by a prenatal seleniumdeficiency was based on a computer literature search of veterinary journals fortissue changes of pure selenium deficiency in a variety of laboratory speciesand on Wallach’s personal observations of the pancreas, liver, heart, etc., ofthe selenium-deficient monkeys. Wallach found unique pancreatic changes in arhesus monkey that were consistent with the diagnosis of CF; however, there hadnever been an animal diagnosed with CF and the disease was considered a geneticdefect found in humans only.In 1958 important nutrition papers were published presenting the rat and mouseas models for the essentiality of selenium in nutrition. In 1972 the chick modelfor selenium deficiency was introduced. In the case of the chicks, congenitalselenium deficiency produced the most CF-like lesions in the pancreas. Whenthese selenium deficient chicks were given selenium in the first 30 days afterhatching the pancreatic lesions were 100% reversible.A review of over 350 published autopsy reports of CF patients revealed 79reports of a unique cardiomyopathy identical with the cardiomyopathy of Chinesechildren in Keshan Province of the Peoples Republic of China. The cardiomyopathyin China was identified with and related to a selenium deficiency of the soil inKeshan Province by WHO.In 1990 Wallach and Ma performed and reviewed 1,700 autopsy cases of KeshanDisease (KSD) in Chinese children under the age of ten years, and they observedpancreatic, liver, heart, and lung problems consistent with CF in 595 or 35%,and 100% displayed the classical lesions of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy andchanges consistent with muscular dystrophy (MD).Large-scale Chinese double blind supplementation studies confirmed the originaltheory of a selenium deficiency as the cause of KSD.From 1974 to 1977, preschool and school-age children were divided into twogroups. Group one was made up of 36,603 children whose diets were supplementedwith 1 mg of sodium selenite orally three times per week; group two was acontrol group of 9,430 children given a sugar tablet placebo.At the end of the three year study, the rate of KSD in the selenium supplementedgroup dropped from 13/1,000 children to 1/1,000 children; the rate of KSD in thecontrol group remained at 13/1,000. Continued long-term studies, eventuallyinvolving over 500,000 participants, confirmed that supplemental selenium wasspecific for the prevention and cure of KSD.Muscular DystrophyAffliction with Muscular dystrophy (MD) is another crime against the Americanpeople by the medical doctors for reasons of money. If the total truth is thatMD is a simple selenium-deficiency disease and totally preventable and curablewith a gluten-free diet, a supplement program built on the 90 essentialnutrients and featuring extra selenium supplementation, and that as a resultthere could be an elimination of MD, an entire medical specialty would be wipedout.As crazy as it seems on the surface, compare the “genetic” approach to human MDwith the search for the genomic repair mechanism to the veterinary industryapproach to MD (white muscle disease aka: muscular dystrophy) where muscle(meat) is “King” (i.e., pork chops, beef steak, lamb chops, roasts, ground redmeat, chicken, turkey, etc.). Muscular dystrophy (MD) known as white muscledisease, stiff lamb disease, and mulberry heart disease (KSD in pigs), have beenwiped out in the veterinary industry by the simple supplementation of seleniumto a complete nutritionally-perfect preconception ration for pregnant femalesand rapidly growing newborn animals.In addition to the overt selenium deficiencies in the American diet, the loss ofthe intestinal villi associated with a gluten intolerance frequently results inan inability to efficiently absorb selenium even if it is in the diet. The bestassurance of an adequate selenium supply for a fetus to avoid CF, MD, and KSD,is for the mother to be supplemented prior to conception with all 90 essentialnutrients with additional chelated selenium (selenomethionine) or plant derivedcolloidal selenium; and where appropriate a gluten-free diet should be employedby the mother-to-be to maximize the absorption of the selenium. You are not whatyou eat, you are what you absorb.Prevention is the name of the game for MD; the selenium levels in the diets andsupplements of preconception women is important to the maintenance of pregnancyas well as the prevention of MD in all of its forms (i.e., Duchenne [legs andback], Erb [scapulohumeral], Becker’s [benign juvenile], and Gowers [hands andfeet]), which are in reality artificial classifications of MD by groups ofmuscles initially affected by random chance at diagnosis.Keshan disease (i.e., KSD, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart musculardystrophy, mulberry heart disease, etc.) that is also caused by a seleniumdeficiency should be added to the list of preventable and treatable forms ofmuscular dystrophies.In the November 2012 issue of Men’s Journal, an article entitled “Why AreTriathletes Dying?” noted that over the previous nine years 43 competitors haddied in USA Triathlon-sanctioned events, six in 2012 alone. Doctors attributedthe triathlon deaths to pre-existing and often undiagnosed heart conditions,such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a thickening of the heart’sventricles. “The most common finding is an unknown heart problem, which wouldpredispose an athlete to having sudden arrhythmia on race day,” says Dr.Lawrence Creswell, a heart surgeon on USA Triathlon’s panel. “For many athletes,the swim is the most stressful part of the race for the heart.” In fact,hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sudden heart death of athletes, is KSD and iscaused by a simple deficiency of the trace element selenium. Supplement acomplete 90 nutrient program with extra selenium and the athlete can live.Failure to supplement a high-performance athlete with additional selenium canincrease one’s risk of a sudden heart death significantly.Kawasaki DiseaseKawasaki Disease, thought by the medical community to be agenetically-transmitted disease, is in fact a congenital copper deficiency thathas two parts. The human infant born with Kawasaki Disease is born with acongenital coronary artery aneurysm (a separation of the middle and inner layersof the artery or a ballooning of a weakened coronary artery), which is in factinitiated by a congenital copper deficiency, copper being required tomanufacture and maintain elastic fibers in arteries as well as other tissues.The second part of Kawasaki Disease is a Streptococcal bacterial invasion of theaneurysm site. Streptococcal infection will set up in the damaged artery wallfollowing a leakage of bacteria into the blood stream following a strep throatinfection or sloppy dental work. Kawasaki Disease is totally preventable with apreconception supplementation of all 90 essential nutrients, additional copper,and antibiotics.HomosexualityHomosexuality has long been thought to be an emotional and/or environmentalaberration created in the child by improper role models and improper parenting,etc.; then homosexuality was relegated to a “choice of sexual preference.”There is now a kaleidoscope of sexual behaviors, choices, and displays; however,none of the members of this ever-growing subculture can refute the fact thatthere are only two sexes: male and female.A series of preventable embryologic congenital events frequently result inphysical and/or emotional and behavioral aberrations. These congenital eventscan result in individuals who are asexual, who are neither male nor female, orwho could be both male and female at once, forming five commonly acceptedclassifications.Less understood is the increasing frequency of “gay” individuals who are fertileand physically normal males or females.In first discussing congenital events, “intersex” is the medical term used todescribe the term hermaphrodite. A female hermaphrodite might possess onetesticle and one ovary, a male pseudo hermaphrodite could have testicles andsome recognizable female genitalia but lack ovaries, and a female pseudohermaphrodite may have ovaries and some noticeable features of male genitaliabut no testicles.The high profile sexual conversion of “Christine Jorgenson” opened the taboosubject of intersexuals to the general public. At the 1972 Olympic Games, heldin Munich, Germany, all female athletes were subjected to a chromosome test. Ahair from their head was used to determine their genetic sex and “female”athletes with the male chromosome pattern were disqualified. Two famous Russian“sisters” (Tamara Press, the world champion shot putter and Irina Press, theworld champion pentathelon athlete) retired from world competition when thechromosome test was made an Olympic requirement.John Money of Johns Hopkins University, a specialist in the field of congenitalsexual organ defects (defects that are present at birth and are related tomineral or vitamin deficiencies of the embryo), states that “intersexuals canconstitute as many as four percent of all births.”Very few intersexuals maintain their faulty dichotomy of sex, and most areidentified at birth and placed in programs of hormonal and surgical correctionsto enable them to blend into the heterosexual society as normal physical andbehavioral males and females. The goals of these programs are clearlynon-judgmental and humanitarian and are to be applauded; however, grave mistakesare made as the genetic gender based on the presence of Barr bodies (the femaleX chromosome) in blood smears do not always coincide with the brain’s perceptionof gender because of concurrent congenital events relating to hypoplasia of thepreoptic hypothalamus.An October 31, 2013, article in The Wall Street Journal, “Countries ExpandRecognition for Alternative ‘Intersex’ Gender,” lists Switzerland, Finland,Australia, European Union, and Germany as countires that can delay correctivesurgery until children are ten years old or older so they can make their ownchoice.However, the social and surgical problems of intersexuals could be totallyavoided by providing a proper and complete preconception nutritional program forthe embryo.The term “hermaphrodite” is a connection of the Greek male Hermes and the femaleAphrodite. Greek mythology tells of the gods that produced Hermaphrodites, whoat age 15 (puberty), fell in love with a nymph and fused his body with hers.Hermaphrodites was a description of a male hermaphrodite who was born over 2,000years ago.In many true hermaphrodites, the testicles and ovaries develop separately butequally on the right and left sides; in some, the gonads fuse forming an“ovo-testes.” Frequently, at least one of the gonads functions, producing spermor ova as well as the appropriate male and/or female hormones.Pseudo hermaphrodites have the same two gonads, either testicles or ovaries, inconcert with the male (XY) or the female (XX) chromosome complement.Male pseudo hermaphrodites have testicles and XY chromosomes, yet they also havea vagina and a clitoris and at puberty develop breasts. They do not cycle ormenstruate.Female pseudo hermaphrodites have ovaries, XX chromosomes, and sometimes auterus, but they also have some external genital features of the male.Because of the wide biological variation in these congenital defects, there isno classification system that describes each and every recorded anatomicalintersexual. In 1969 Paul Guinet of the Endocrine Clinic, Lyons, France, andJacques Decount of the Endocrine Clinic, Paris, listed 98 different types oftrue hermaphrodites, based on the appearances of external genitalia andassociated tubes and ducts. In some, the intersexual showed strong femaledevelopment with separate openings for the vagina and urethra and a cleft vulvawith both large and small labia (vaginal lips). At puberty they developedbreasts and began to cycle and menstruate; however, their oversized and sexuallysensitive “clitoris” when aroused looked and functioned as a penis.A second type of hermaphrodite exhibits breasts and a feminine body, and theyalso menstruate; however, their labia and vulva fuse, forming a well-definedscrotum, and the phallus (clitoris/penis) can reach almost three inches long.The most frequent type of true hermaphrodite (55%) described by the Frenchinvestigation have a masculine body, and their urethra runs through or near thephallus, which is anatomically formed into a penis.According to historians, Plato is the only recognized authority to have surmisedthat there were “three sexes (male, female, and hermaphrodite).”According to Plato, members of the human race were originally joined in pairs,two men, two women, and a man/women pair. “Zeus cut each pair apart to diminishtheir power and to teach them to fear the gods. Humans thus spend their time onthe earth searching for their other half, with whom they can merge in love.”“The disposition of these people differed,” Plato wrote, “according to theoriginal pairing: those whose sex had been mixed were obsessed by coupling andoften became adulterers, whereas people sprung from single-sex pairs were morefitted for the everyday business of the world. In particular men whose bond waswith another man were most suited for government and leadership!” Thus Platogave the first interpretation of the origin of homosexual behavior.In ancient times, the penalty for those poor souls with congenital intersexbirth defects could be death. In the 1600s a Scottish hermaphrodite living as awomen was buried alive as a witch after getting “her” bosses’ daughter pregnant.In 1937 Hugh H. Young, a urologist at Johns Hopkins, published “Genitalabnormalities, Hermaphroditism and Related Adrenal Diseases,” in which heaccumulated many cases of intersexual “accidents of birth.”One of the intersexual cases Young cited was a hermaphrodite, Emma, a “female”who had a penis-sized clitoris and a vagina which made it possible for thisintersexual to have sex with heterosexual men and women. As a teen, Emma had sexwith several females, and at nineteen she married a heterosexual man; however,“her” sexual relationship with ”her” husband gave “her” very little pleasure, soEmma kept several girl friends on the side.In 1967 Dr. Christopher J. Dewhurst and Dr. Ronald R. Gordon wrote “TheIntersexual Disorders,” in which they stated, “Intersexual infants are a tragicevent which immediately conjures up visions of someone doomed to live always assexual freaks in loneliness and frustration.”Veterinarians have a lot of experience with normal animals that have unusualsexual anatomy and also abnormal congenital defects as a result of embryonicnutritional deficiencies.Marsupials, such as kangaroos, wallabies and mouse opossums, for example,normally have three vaginas. Sperm may ascend any or all of the two lateral orcentral vaginas, and the babies or joeys may be “born” through any of them. Toprove this novel anatomical genitalia actually worked equally with any of thethree vaginas, Wallach assisted one Australian biologist by tying off andsurgically removing the lateral and central vaginas in several female mouseopossums, had them bred, and proved that fertility and normal birth could occurthrough any one of the three vaginas.The duck-billed platypus is a mammal that lays eggs in a nest.Many species of animals have multiple baby litters that results in the embryoscompeting for nutrition. The more limited the nutrition, the greater number ofembryos that are negatively affected (by having runts) and the more severe thebirth defects will be. Every known congenital defect of the sexual organs of manhas been recorded in many species of animals (frequently, many different defectscan occur in the same liter if adequate micronutrients are not available).“Freemartin” is a term given to female animals born as a fraternal twin ofmales; 80% of those reported occur in cattle and 5% in sheep and goats. Thefreemartin or martin heifer is infertile and frequently will have congenitaldefects of the genitalia, and they display masculine behavior. Genetically, theanimal is chimeric: karyotyping of a sample of cells shows XX/XY chromosomes. Itis postulated by the proponents of a genetic cause that “the freemartinoriginates as a female (XX), but acquires the male (XY) component in utero byexchange of cellular material from its male twin, through vascular connectionsbetween placentas.” Externally, the freemartin is anatomically a female;however, a variety of female reproductive developments are changed as a resultof acquisition of “anti-Mullerian hormone” from the male twin. Freemartins are acommon outcome of mixed-sex fraternal twins in all cattle species and to alesser degree in sheep, goats, and swine.The 18th century physician John Hunter discovered that a freemartin always has amale twin. It was hypothesized early in the 20th century that masculinizingfactors travel from the male twin to the female twin through the vascularconnections of the placenta because of the vascular fusion and effect on theinternal genital anatomy of the female.Several researchers made the discovery that a freemartin occurs when the femalefetus has its chorion fuse in the uterus with that of a male twin. The findingswere published in 1916 by Tandler and Keller. The discovery was also made byAmerican biologist Frank R. Lillie, who published his findings in Science in1916.In the Aldous Huxley novel, Brave New World, a “freemartin” referred to inchapters 1, 3, 11 and17 is a woman who has been deliberately rendered sterile byexposure to male hormones during fetal development. In the book, governmentpolicy requires freemartins to make up 70% of the female population.The Robert A. Heinlein novel Beyond This Horizon lists “the clever andrepulsively beautiful pseudo-feminine freemartins” as one of the geneticallyengineered specialist forms of humans that were created in the “Empire of theGreat Khans” (Chapter 2).In the Robert A, Heinlein novel Farnham’s Freehold, the protagonist, HughFarnham, is given a companion (bedwarmer) who is listed as a natural freemartin.In David Cohler’s crime novel, Freemartin, an FtM transgender man is a murderer.In the Avram Davidson novel, The House the Blakeneys Built, the cattle arefreemartins.In Christopher Rowley’s fantasy book series, Basil Broketail, freemartins are abreed of sterile female dragons.In the Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle novel, Football, a slender womanquestions her sexuality as to whether or not she is a freemartin.The Alfred Kinsey Report in the 1940s and 1950s listed homosexuals as “4% to 10%of the American population.” More recently, Dr. Richard Pillard, a psychiatristfrom Boston University, says “4% of males and 2 to 3% of females in the UnitedStates are gay.” Overseas, the latest reports indicate that “in Great Britainthe level of gay individuals has possibly reached 25% of the total population inthe 90s.” The gradual increase in the percentage of gays in America and otherindustrialized nations of the world parallels the gradual decrease in themineral content in our farm and range soils and therefore a decrease in themineral content of our food supply.“Gay” behavior also occurs in animals kept through puberty in same sex groups,similar to opportunistic homosexual behavior that takes place in prison.The current focus on the “gay” phenomena has moved from that of a learnedbehavior or a “lifestyle choice” to that of a prenatal biological event, inother words, a preventable congenital event caused by a deficiency of mineralsand or vitamins in early pregnancy. This 180 degree change in thinking resultedfrom the finding of a common physical change in the brains of gay men. Thischange of thinking actually started in the1970s when German doctors felt that anarea of the pre-optic area of the hypothalamus in the brain of homosexual menwas abnormal and they tried with surgical procedures to normalize the defect.The Germans were not successful and the study was abandoned.Pillard looked at 50 straight men and 50 gay men and found that gay men hadsignificantly more gay brothers. He joined forces with Michael J. Bailey, apsychologist at Northwestern University, Chicago, and they found that only 52%of the identical twins of gay men were gay themselves (proving that gay behavioris not genetic, for if it were genetic 100% of the identical gay twins wouldhave to be gay!); 22% of gay men’s fraternal twin brothers and other biologicalbrothers were gay, while less than 10% of adopted brothers were gay.“It is a mistake to think there is a gay gene” says Dean Harmer, a geneticist atthe National Cancer Institute.Simon LeVay, heads of the Institute of Gay and Lesbian Studies in WestHollywood, California is well known for finding anatomical brain differencesbetween gay and straight men.In autopsy studies, LeVay found that an area in the brain of the pre-optic areaof the hypothalamus (center of sexual appetite and sex drive) is smaller inhomosexual men than it is in heterosexual men.In 1990 LeVay compared cells from the medial pre-optic region of thehypothalamus (third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus) from 19homosexual men (all of whom had died of AIDS).A primary concern with LeVay’s study was the fact that some of the men had diedof AIDS, which can affect and destroy brain cells. However, other cellcollections in the brains of gay men in the study were identical in size andcharacter with those of heterosexual men.Another brain feature that shows a difference between homosexual andheterosexual men is the size of the anterior commissure, a bundle of nervefibers that connects the right and left sides of the brain. The anteriorcommissure is smallest in the heterosexual man and of identical size in gay menand women. The two physical differences in the brains of homosexual andheterosexual men are in all likelihood the result of a congenital malformationevent of the physical structure and or a biochemical deficiency event—againresulting from a congenital deficiency of minerals.Roger A. Gorski at UCLA in1978 identified the pre-optic hypothalamic nuclei inrats that controlled sexual appetite. In addition to size differences in maleand female cell groups, Gorski found that male hormones play a key role inproducing the size difference in males and females. Initially, males and femaleshave the same size and number of cells in the pre-optic area, but a surge oftestosterone secreted by the male fetus before birth appears to stabilize thesecell populations. In females the lack of the testosterone surge allows them toatrophy. Removing testosterone from adult males by castration does not cause ashrinking of the cells!Combined with the study of identical twins that failed to show a genetic pattern(the rate of both identical twins being homosexual would have to be 100%), theLeVay study is a sure indication that gay behavior is a congenital deficiencyevent rather than a genetic defect or a lifestyle choice. The gay person becomesgay early in the formation of the embryonic brain!A parallel study of 147 gay women who had identical twin sisters showed only 48%who have twins that are gay, and 16% of fraternal twins of gay women are gay,while only 6% of adopted sisters are gay—approximately the same results as wasreported in the identical twin study in gay men.Simon LeVay’s findings agree with the German studies of the 1970s. When viewedin the light of known physical and behavioral sexual defects in animals frommultiple embryo litters suffering from congenital mineral and vitamindeficiencies (rats with 14 embryos to freemartins in cattle with fraternaltwins) where embryos compete for limited nutrition, the high percentage (but nottotal) of gay twins in identical and fraternal twins is understandable. Humantwins are competing with each other for limited resources to a greater degreethan single embryos. Therefore, more congenital defects in multiple births.It is an easy mental leap to perceive that one should be able to prevent thecongenital hermaphrodite and the intersexual as well as the gay embryohypothalamic events with complete preconception nutrition with 90 essentialnutrients including minerals (zinc, manganese, magnesium, gallium, copper,etc.), vitamins (B12, folic acid, vitamin A, etc.), amino acids, and essentialfatty acids. This can perhaps best be described as insurance against theproduction of all congenital events including homosexual embryos.Wallach has interviewed hundreds of gay men and women and found that in eachcase the mother of the gay male or female was in nutritional distress duringtheir pregnancy. The women either had gluten intolerance (low efficiency ofabsorption), were alcoholics, or had low income with reduced access to healthyfood, or failed to use prenatal vitamins and minerals, etc.Wallach’s survey also showed that the gay individuals knew they were gaysomewhere between the ages of six to ten years of age indicating that gaybehavior is not a choice, but rather the gay individual is driven to be gay by acongenital event or misstep of brain development and chemistry, thus making itimpossible to “pray away” or “coach away” gay behavior.EugenicsAlexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, turned his creative mindto the science of eugenics. Bell dabbled with animal breeding to improve hislivestock and his crowning glory was sheep with four teats instead of two.He devoted his efforts in his senior years to the “genetics of deafness.” Infact, congenital deafness is produced by a maternal manganese deficiency.Bell turned his interest in genetics and eugenics to the “genetics of humanlongevity.” Bell wanted to create a “human stud-book,” although he did notcondone sterilization or extermination of “lesser beings” to advance the humanspecies. Instead he believed he could provide a “dating service” based onbeauty, intelligence, and longevity.Bell believed his “dating service” would allow individuals to seek (in a veryscientific way) the perfect mate and “fall in love and breed.” Over time thisdirected “evolution” that employed conscious trait selection would “improve” thelooks, intelligence, and longevity of the human race, as man has done with thepractice of improving livestock by inbreeding to increase the rate of appearanceof desired traits.In fact the obsessive practice of a combination of perfect biochemicalnutrition, a calorie-restricted diet, and an avoidance of inflammatory freeradicals (trans-fatty acids, heterocyclic amines, and acrylamides) willeliminate all birth defects and guarantee an increased lifespan by thirty to 100percent!ObesityDespite the fact that America spends more for health care annually than allother nations combined, as of 2013 the only health category that the UnitedStates is ranked number one is obesity.Obesity is universally believed to have a genetic cause and that it can only bedealt with by means of gastric by-pass, exercise, and vigilant calorie andportion control. None of these beliefs are correct.In 1980, 15% of adults in America were obese. In 2000 the obesity rate popped upand more than doubled to 30.5%, and by 2012 the rate had crept up to 40%. It isobvious to the casual observer that the medical theory that obesity is due to“eating too much and lack of exercise” and the practice of obesity control withdrugs and surgery had failed.The belief that exercise could prevent and control weight gain and obesity wasdashed in January 2009, when Chicago’s Loyola University School of Medicinedeclared that “exercise won’t cure obesity.” The practitioners of bariatricmedicine (weight loss specialists) who fought the study were forced to relentafter a critical review of the data showed that the original conclusion wascorrect. In August of 2009 a cover article in Time magazine declared “The MythAbout Exercise: Exercise won’t make you lose weight.”Obesity is not a genetically-generated disease, not a result of lack ofexercise, and not a disease that can be attributed soley to overeating.. Obesityis in fact caused by a deficiency of minerals that universally manifestssymptomatically as cravings, binge eating, munchies and pica! In 1994 Wallachand Ma published their original review on obesity in the book Rare Earths:Forbidden Cures, and in 2006 Wallach and Ma published their definitive findingson obesity in a landmark book entitled Hell’s Kitchen.DementiaDementia manifests itself as a minimum of four different diseases. Sometimes,individuals will have some degree of two, three, or all four of the classicdementias at the same time: 1. Vascular dementia occurs when the cerebral arteries become obstructed with atherosclerosis and/or arteriosclerosis. The cause of these obstructions is inflammation of the arterial lining (intima) by the same forces that also obstruct coronary, ocular, and renal arteries. The occlusion occurs when the antioxidant levels in the diet are low and the arteries are exposed to inflammation as a result of the consumption of fried foods, processed meats, oils, and gluten. The nutritional therapy approach includes stopping the ongoing inflammation by creating an elimination diet that avoids inflammatory foods, supplementing with all 90 essential nutrients, antioxidants, and providing significant vascular care. 2. Korsakoff’s syndrome occurs as part of the BeriBeri (thiamine or vitamin B1 deficiency) collection of diseases. The disease can be reversed by the elimination of sugar, fried foods, processed meats, oils, and gluten from the diet as well as a supplement program that provides all 90 essential nutrients with a special emphasis on the supplementation of thiamine (vitamin B1). 3. Wernecke–Korsakoff’s syndrome is a two-part disease syndrome in which the patient is diagnosed with both Korsakoff’s syndrome and multiple sclerosis (MS) simultaneously. The disease syndrome can be reversed by dealing with both diseases. To stop the ongoing inflammatory damage to the myelin of the brain (that occurs in MS) with a dietary change, add 6–8 eggs per day to provide raw materials to help support maintenance and repair of the myelin and supplement with all 90 essential nutrients with a special emphasis on antioxidants, including selenium. 4. Alzheimer’s disease is a physician-caused disease, produced by lowering cholesterol and saturated fats in the patient’s diet, prescription of statin drugs, and the directive to avoid vitamin and mineral supplements. In fact, Alzheimer’s disease is a physician-caused disease. Prevention of Alzheimer’s has been documented by a Johns Hopkins randomized and double blind study on almost 5,000 people over the age of 65. The ten-year study published in 2004 demonstrated clearly that the consumption of a special diet, avoidance of certain foods and the supplementation of nutrients can reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease by 78%! The nutritional approach to Alzheimer’s disease includes all of the anti-dementia nutritional supplementation and dietary changes employed for the other three dementias (including eating no fried foods, no processed meats, no oils; eat 4–6 eggs per hundred pounds of body weight per day, etc.), avoid all statin drugs (in April 2012, the FDA sent out an urgent warning, “Statin drugs increase the risk of dementia and type 2 diabetes!” and additionally the employment of dha and epa essential fatty acids to allow the production of neurotransmitters specifically for memory and cognition.MINERALS: THE CURRENCY OF LIFEPasteur brought about a revolution in medicine by associating bacteria or“germs” with disease, thus displacing the centuries old theory of “spontaneousgeneration.” His work carried through to the late 1930s when penicillin wasdiscovered by Flemming. During that nearly two hundred year period it wasthought that most diseases including cancer and mental disease were caused bybacterial germs—the “discovery of the century.” Everything in medicine wasgeared towards chasing this global bacterial causal theory of disease, andcultural techniques on artificial media-enriched whole blood or serum; vaccines,antibiotics, and sanitizers magically appeared to save us from bacterialdisease.After World War II, viruses became important. Techniques in identification andpropagation (cell cultures) were developed and every effort was made toattribute every disease from cancer to mental disease to a viral cause. Theelectron microscope, monkeys for vaccine production, and HPV vaccine forcervical cancer were the tools of the day—“virus technology became the discoveryof the century.”The development of the “genetic mapping techniques has become the discovery ofthe century.” Today, through mapping of the genome, everyone knows that geneticdefects cause everything from body odor to cancer and mental disease. Soundfamiliar?The truth is “genetic defects” are no more the root cause of all disease than itis a fact that global warming is caused by human activity. The terrible parallelbetween the medical fever over bacteria, viruses, and genetic engineering isthat preceding “the discovery of the century” was the development of laboratorytechniques; for example, we developed bacterial culturing with lightmicroscopes, viral culturing from cell cultures, and the electron microscope forgenetic mapping. Now there are amniocentesis and test tube babies (actuallyveterinarians had been freezing semen and fertilizing and implanting eggs, the“test tube babies,” for 50 years before medical doctors had ever dreamt of it).And the ultimate “cloning” of Dolly, the lamb, accomplished by a veterinarytechnician from Scotland, was a form of “genetic engineering.”In both the “viral answer” and the “genetic answer” huge sums of money weredrawn out of government coffers and private pharmaceutical firms for researchand development, patents, and stock options, and public offerings on the stockexchange flowed freely. Unfortunately none of these “answers” have yet won thewar on cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease or any other of the theoretically“genetically-transmitted diseases.”The human does have a genetic potential for physical and emotional perfectionand an upper limit for height and longevity as does a flamingo, an angel fish, acat, a dog, and an elephant. The human genetic potential includes a disease-freelife with a programmed longevity potential for greater than 140 years. Attainingone’s genetic potential for physical and emotional perfection and optimallongevity begins before the beginning!!Contrary to popular belief, our biological responsibilities as parents beginlong before conception! Preconception nurturing of one’s body—both male andfemale, although the major responsibility is weighted toward the woman, asembryonic success is dependent 100% on the females nutritional status—isessential to success and is a must if one is sexually active and still in thechild-bearing years for a variety of reasons.First of all, the beginning of a new life in animals and man is referred to asan embryo until complete development occurs (90 days in humans), at which timethe embryo becomes a completely developed fetus. The progression from afertilized egg (zygote) to the embryo to the fetus occurs in the firsttrimester, the first one third of pregnancy, in all mammalian species with theexception of the marsupials. In marsupials the baby is “born” as an embryo andfinishes development in the mother’s external pouch.During the 90 days of embryonic development in man, all body tissues, organs,and systems are constructed, connected, and jump-started, leaving only theincrease in size from a mouse-like human at 90 days of pregnancy to the six toten pound human fetus at term (birth).The complexity of events following fertilization, the gastrula stage, leading tothe primitive streak on the embryonic disc, the generation of parallel neuralridges, that quickly rise from the disc and meet to form the neural tube. Thisis destined to become the brain and spinal cord, that includes the 12 pairs ofcranial nerves: the retina of the eye, the auditory nerves, glossal nerves thatoriginate in the brain and innervate the tongue, and the great vagus nerves (the10th cranial nerves) that originate in the brain and innervate the organs of thechest and abdominal cavity.There is the segmental development of the muscular system, 44 vertebrae andperipheral nerves and the wonder of the formation of the four chambered heartthat is intimately integrated with the entire vascular system made up of milesof arteries, veins, and capillaries. The ventral enfolding of the embryonic discbecomes the thoracic and abdominal cavities complete with heart, lungs, liver,pancreas, stomach, gut, genito-urinary tract for reproduction and controllingwaste products from the blood. The endocrine system evolves that provides thepush/pull controls over the bodies development, physiological cycles, sexual andmetabolic control and maintenance. Lastly, but certainly not least, the DNA,RNA, and tens of thousands of subcellular enzymes and enzyme cycles, pathways,and systems that control emotions, sexual drive (and preferences), eye color,height potential, and life itself are some of the “miracles” of life that igniteduring this period.The nutritional requirements of the egg, sperm, the chromosomes in the egg andsperm, and the genes on the chromosomes are exquisitely critical beforeconception, during the embryonic period, during the fetal period, and duringlife outside of the protective cocoon of the uterus until the moment that wedie!!Chromosomes and genes are critical in their second-by-second requirements forminerals, trace minerals, rare-earth metals, vitamins, amino acids, andessential fatty acids. There is no quarter, no room for deficit—the consequencesof failure are too devastating.As a result of the failure of typical food supplies to meet the criticalbiochemical needs of human and animal DNA, chromosome, and sperm and egg, asmany as 15% of American couples are “infertile,” which encourages fertilityclinics to prey on distraught couples. The sperm count of American men hasdropped by 50% over the last 100 years, and 10% of American babies are born withlearning disabilities, deafness, homosexuality, intersex complications,antisocial behavior, ADD, ADHD, autism, “inborn errors of metabolism” of everyenzyme, chromosomal and/or physical neural tube defects (Down’s syndrome, spinabifida, anencephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, etc.), necessitating thecreation of a dizzying number of fund raising and support groups to deal withpediatric disabilities that are totally preventable and in many cases reversible(as in the case of cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy heartdisease, Kawasaki disease, type 2 diabetes, lupus, and other diseases).Additionally, millions of American babies are born each year with totallypreventable chromosomal and physical birth defects (e.g., Down syndrome,cerebral palsy, intersexuals, cleft palate, cleft lip, deafness, heart defects,hiatal hernias, umbilical hernias, extra, missing and webbed limbs and digits,and others.).Injury to the chromosomes, DNA, and genes of the human egg and sperm can becaused by exposure to radiation and pollutants (such as in the Love Canalcontamination case) although very little of this type of injury occurs becauseof our avoidance and awareness of this), toxic chemicals from industrialaccidents or mismanagement (such as from mercury, crude oil, farm chemicals ofDDT, etc.), prescription drugs (resulting in Thalidamide babies, etc.), andalcohol (that causes fetal alcohol syndrome, retardation, etc.)However, the most common cause of birth defects in American babies and babiesaround the world are overt clinical deficiencies of one or more of the 90essential nutrients of the mother-to-be and therefore of the embryo prior toconception and for the first 90 days of pregnancy!The 20th and 21st century OBGYN believed that the “trisomy” of Down’s syndromeis a delayed genetic or chromosomal defect that primarily manifests itself inwomen over the age of thirty-five years. Statistically, the “over 35” rule ofthumb was true when women bore eight to ten children. The poor women would bedepleted of minerals, including zinc, by the time she was over thirty-five yearsold, so the last two or three embryos were at a higher risk for trisomy andother deficiency generated defects.In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the teenage mother is no longer arare phenomenon. Teens are having babies at an ever-increasing rate, and theyhave a higher risk of producing babies with birth defects, including Down’ssyndrome, than does the mother over thirty-five. Teenage mothers and theirbabies are at a higher risk because of the teenagers poor dietary habits andextremely low rates of serious nutritional supplementation. Teenage mothers arein fact still children themselves and therefore require extraordinary levels ofsupplementation to deal with physical growth and the nutritional requirements ofpuberty. They in fact compete with their own embryos for limited or non-existentlevels of vitamins and minerals.The animal industry has completely eliminated all birth defects in animals (inlivestock, pet animals, captive wild species in zoos and wild animal parks, andlaboratory animals), not out of altruistic reasons, but rather to enhanceprofitability!!When a rancher feeds one hundred breeding cows, he expects one hundreduncomplicated pregnancies, one hundred uncomplicated deliveries, one hundredperfect calves, and that the calves will reach reproductive age or shippingweight for the food industry without the need for any veterinary care.The pet industry and the laboratory animal industry has spent over $100 billionover the last 100 years in nutritional research that has resulted in thetripling of life spans. Sixty years ago an “old dog” was eight years old, buttoday an “old dog” is twenty-five years old, and this nutritional research haseliminated all birth defects in all animal species and eliminated all“degenerative, autoimmune, and genetic” diseases that continue to plaguehumans!!!!!!!!There are no health insurance policies private or government (no major medical,no hospitalization, no Medicare, no Blue Cross/Blue Shield, etc.) to coverclinical care costs or financial losses for animals, including pet, laboratoryspecies, and livestock. Therefore the pet owner, the laboratory manager, farmer,the husbandryman, and the rancher must individually bear the financial burden ofanimal health care alone. To reduce or eliminate his financial risk, the animalindustry has learned that it is simply cheaper and more efficient to eliminateinfertility, birth defects, and general healthcare for animals by properlyenriching their diets with optimal levels of all 90 essential nutrients (60minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 essential amino acids, and 3 essential fatty acids)that is a basic requirement of life for all vertebrates.The clinical realities are that few nutritional deficiencies occur in the purestate. In other words, if there is an obvious clinical deficiency, such as irondeficiency anemia, the odds are that there are others, maybe dozens, since thereare no laws that say “you can have only one deficiency disease at a time.” Thisis why there are hundreds of thousands of American babies born each year withcatastrophic, tragic, family-rending birth defects and multiple birth defect“syndromes”—not as the result of a “bad throw of the dice” type of genetictragedy, but rather from the short sighted “prenatal” vitamin mentality of theallopathic OBGYN, who says, “I will prescribe a prenatal vitamin only after awomen is determined to be pregnant (a la Governor Sarah Palin’s OBGYN!).Many women who have had multiple pregnancies “know the ropes” of pregnancy andthe OBGYN process, so they will often wait for three or four months into thepregnancy before beginning to supplement with vitamins and minerals to “savemoney.” Remember, the embryo has become a fully formed human (for better orworse) at 90 days post-conception!After the 90-day mark, except for cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy (whichare preventable and reversible even after the birth of the child), and certain“inborn errors of metabolism (most are managable with change of diet andnutritional supplementation), and sickle cell anemia,” birth defects are likethe Humpty Dumpty poem, where “all of the kings horses and all of the kings mencouldn’t put Humpty Dumpty back together again.”Frequently, twins (identical and fraternal) are born conjoined. This tragiccongenital defect of incomplete division of the embryo is 100% preventable for$50 worth of the 90 essential nutrients per month taken for at least threemonths prior to conception and throughout the pregnancy. Nobody knows more aboutmultiple births—think of litters of puppies, kittens, pigs, rats, mice, rabbits,and so forth—than the animal industry, and through preconception nutritionresearch and implementation, they have eliminated runts (low birth-weightbabies), and congenital and “genetic” birth defects, such as Down syndrome,muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, inborn errors ofmetabolism, Huntington’s disease, and others.).Twin girls, Angela and Amy Lakeberg, were born in Indiana on June 29, 1993. Theywere conjoined at the chest and shared a single severely defective heart and asingle liver. Following separation, one twin (Amy) was sacrificed in order tosave one (Angela).After eleven months and nineteen days the surviving Lakeberg twin, Angela, died.Without consideration of the human tragedy and family devastation, the medicalcost alone for the attempt to fix what could have been prevented for fortydollars, was over $1 million to tax payers ($600,000 extracted from thetaxpayers of Indiana alone).We must insist that our health dollars be spent more wisely. The Lakebergs wereon food stamps that they traded for street drugs, the conjoined twins weredetected early in pregnancy by ultrasound, and yet the medical community was soeager to take everyone’s money."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENNUTRITION: THE DEATH OF THE GENETIC THEORY OF DISEASE TRANSMISSIONNutrition science has evolved in three phases. In the first, during the latenineteenth century, physicians, unaware of the effect of nutrients within foods,began to associate whole foods with curative effects on nutrient deficiencydiseases. In the second, during the first few decades of the twentiethcentury,(veterinarians), physicians and biochemists began to identify thechemical composition of nutrients within whole foods that were responsible forelimination of nutrient deficiency diseases. In the third, during the remainderof the twentieth century and continuing to the present, scientists from a numberof disciplines (chemistry, biochemistry, biology, (epigenetics), pharmacognosy,botany, medicine, pharmacology, nutrition science, and animal science) haveuncovered preventive and curative effects of specific nutrients when consumed atlevels in excess of those necessary to arrest nutrient deficiency diseases.—Jonathan W. Emord, Esq.Global Censorship of Health InformationFor thousands of years healers have recognized that specific foods can preventand heal diseases. During the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, many of thespecific factors in foods (micro and macro nutrients) that can prevent andreverse diseases in animals and humans had been identified. Unfortunately theuniversal belief of the medical community is that humans who reside in theindustrialized world do not need supplementation of the essential nutrients.Classic examples of scientific and medical ignorance and arrogance thatnegatively affect human life include the work of Georges Buffon, an 18th-centurynaturalist who put to paper the “truth” of his time (unfortunately a “truth” islimited by the number of facts available):If we consider the European, the negro, the Chinese, the American, the highlycivilized man, the savage, the rich, the poor, the inhabitant of the city, thedwellers in the country, so different from one another in every respect, agreeon this one point, and have the same duration, the same interval of time to runthrough “twixt the cradle and the grave,” that the difference of race, climate,of food, of comforts, makes no difference in the duration of life, it will beseen at once that the duration of life depends neither upon habits, nor custom,nor the quality of food, that nothing can change the fixed laws which regulatethe number of our years.False, dangerous and criminal advice is given to the American public by theignorant group known as “Quack Busters,” who are doctors who joined together todestroy legitimate alternative competition to the medical monopoly. Members ofthis private group of doctors include Victor Herbert, MD (now a Dead Doctor) whois the founder of this group he named The Committee Against Medical Fraud. OtherQuackbuster members include John Renner, MD, (now also deceased), as well asWilliam Jarvis, MD (who now works for the CDC), and Stephan Barret, MD (whocontinually draws up complaints against alternative healers from his darkbasement). Below is a statement by Dr. Victor Herbert:It has been primarily in this century (the 20th century), however, thatresearchers have identified the specific food substances—vitamins andminerals—that are instrumental in preventing these deficiency diseases. As aresult of this increased knowledge and the availability of a variety of foodsrich in vitamins and minerals, deficiency diseases are now rare in the UnitedStates and other affluent industrialized nations. Despite this, millions ofAmericans believe that their foods do not supply adequate vitamins and minerals,and therefore they take nutritional supplements, often in potentially dangerousmega-doses, and sometimes resulting in actual harm.Victor Herbert, MD, also claimed the following:Healthy adult men and healthy adult non-pregnant, non-lactating women who eat avaried diet get all of the vitamins and minerals they need . . .The fact is, even a marginal diet will provide adequate vitamins and minerals;if you are an average, healthy American, you really have to follow an extremelylimited or bizarre diet to develop vitamin (and mineral) deficiencies.In fact, you cannot guarantee the optimal intake of micro or macro nutrients,even by “eating well.” In the animal industry, the perfect mix of micro andmacro nutrients is added to the diets to ensure perfect nutrition for maximumdisease resistance, fertility, healthy babies, and maximum production of meat,milk, and eggs, and whatever nutrition is in the feed itself is considered“value added.” By contrast, in the human nutrition arena we believe falselybecause of misdirection by the medical community, that if “one eats well theycan get everything they need to produce perfect babies, maximize lifespan andhealth”—not so!In 1990 Lucian Lepe, the head of the Department of Public Health at HarvardMedical School, published a survey in which they looked for the county inAmerica that had the highest average age. Lepe’s goal was to then have thehealthcare systems that were used by the members of the longest-living countyemployed and duplicated by all American counties with the goal of raising theaverage lifespan of all Americans, a lofty goal to be sure.What Lepe found, however, was that the counties with the longest-living peoplein America were clustered in the mid-west, the upper mid-west and the plainsstates. Their common heritage was Scandinavian. They were Swedes, Swiss,Finnish, Norwegians, Danish, Austrians. They were mainly dairy farmers whocooked all their meals by poaching, stewing, roasting, grilling, and baking.The counties of the shortest-living people in Lepe’s study were those found inthe old Confederate States and Indian Reservations west of the Mississippi RiverThese cultures fried everything; it was how these people cooked their food,whether or not they supplemented with essential nutrients, and it was what theyate, not medical technology, that added or subtracted years from their life. Themaximum health benefit was provided by default and dumb luck by ingested rawmaterials rather than the employment of modern medical technology!Lepe noted that residents of all American counties had equal access to allhealthcare services. Even the uninsured “living under the bridge” had access toall health care services through Medicaid, yet the old Confederate States werethe epicenter of the heart attack, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and cancer belt ofAmerica.In the April 16, 2012, issue of the journal Food Chemistry, there was a reportthat showed in fact that “commercial baby foods contain less than 20% of theminimum daily requirements of minerals and vitamins that are required by humaninfants.” In contrast, dog food, cat food, chicken food, sheep, pig, horse, andcattle feed all have 100% of the animal’s minimum daily requirements of all 90essential nutrients.In March 20, 2013, the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institutereported that “Residents of the nation’s least healthy counties die at twice therate of those living in their state’s healthiest counties, despite a majorimprovement in the rate of premature deaths. It appears that access to qualityhealth care, however, accounts for only 20% of a county’s ranking. The physicalenvironment (and nutrition) is weighed the most heavily in the rankings.”The most blatant example of the Wisconsin study paradox was the fact that “thecounty with the highest levels of health care and health services wasPhiladelphia County (meaning the most doctors, the most hospitals, the mosthealth care funding, etc.), yet Philadelphia County had the worst level ofhealth of its residents than any other American County!”To achieve maximum fertility and healthy outcomes of birth-defect freepregnancies, healthful disease-free lives and maximum longevity one mustsupplement with all 90 essential nutrients to warranty their optimal dailyintake. You cannot depend on your food to be your sole source of macro andmicronutrients. Failing to be proactive and to consume the optimal supplementprogram based on body weight, you will contract nutritional-deficiency diseasesand spend excessive amounts of time and money on medical care and prescriptions.The secret is to give your body the raw materials, the 90 essential nutrients,rather than depend on technology to deal with diseases after they appear.You can be a member of any religion and successfully supplement with the 90essential nutrients.You can be a vegetarian and successfully supplement with the 90 essentialnutrients.You can be a vegan and successfully supplement with the 90 essential nutrients.You can be a meat-eater and successfully supplement with the 90 essentialnutrients.You can juice and successfully supplement with the 90 essential nutrients.You can eat organic and successfully supplement with the 90 essential nutrients.YOU ARE WHAT YOU ABSORBThere is an old adage that states “you are what you eat.” Unfortunately, thisold adage is not correct. It is more correct and accurate to say “you are whatyou absorb.”There are two major issues that have to be considered to ensure optimalabsorption: hypochlorhydria (i.e., low stomach acid levels) and glutenintolerance:HypochlorhydriaThe raw material for the Chief Cells, the acid-manufacturing cells of thestomach, to make hydrochloric acid is NaCl, which is salt. Stomach acid isrequired to keep the stomach environment sterile and free of bacteria, viruses,yeast, and fungus. Failure to keep the stomach environment at a low pH below 2.0results in organism overgrowth, gastric fermentation, and reflux. This acidicgastric environment is also required to facilitate the absorption of vitamin B12by activating the “intrinsic factor” that is produced by specialized cells inthe stomach wall; to activate the stomach enzyme “pepsin,” which in the presenceof stomach acid will breakdown proteins into amino acids, peptides, andpolypeptides that facilitates absorption; and to facilitate the absorption ofminerals.Gluten IntoleranceGluten intolerance, as a negative reaction to grain consumption, was recognizedby the Egyptians and Greek physicians thousands of years ago. Gluten intoleranceis not an allergy to wheat, barley, rye, or oat proteins. However, when a personis intolerant of small-grain proteins, the consumption of gluten will produce a“contact enteritis” similar to a contact dermatitis when an individual isexposed to the juices of poison ivy. No one is allergic to poison ivy; however,just about everyone is intolerant of poison ivy.The gastrointestinal damage that is produced by the gluten-contact enteritisincludes celiac disease (wheat allergy that occurs concurrently with contactenteritis), diverticulitis, appendicitis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatorybowel syndrome, leaky gut syndrome, colitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’sdisease, gastritis, bloating, and reflux.The gradual and progressive loss of intestinal villi as a result of contactenteritis produces a kaleidoscope of nutritional-deficiency diseases as a resultof malabsorption, including infertility, birth defects (muscular dystrophy,cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, intersex syndrome, gay behavior,etc.), colicky babies, keratosis, eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis, rosacea,asthma, fibromyalgia, lupus, sarcoidosis, diabetes, kidney failure, kidneystones, arthritis, obesity, osteoporosis, periodontal disease, dementia, heartdisease, hypertension, alopecia, macular degeneration, dental problems,cataracts, nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, peripheralneuropathies, liver disease, constipation, diarrhea, etc.So you are what you absorb.The following lists give the essential nutrients for good health.The 60 Essential Elements, Metals, Minerals, Trace Minerals and Rare EarthsAluminumGoldRheniumArsenicHafniumRubidiumBariumHolmiumSamariumBerylliumHydrogenScandiumBoronIodineSeleniumBromineIronSilicaCalciumLanthanumSilverCarbonLithiumSodiumCeriumLuteciumStrontiumCesiumMagnesiumSulphurChlorideManganeseTantalumChromiumMolybdenumTerbiumCobaltNeodymiumThuliumCopperNickleTinDysprosiumNiobiumTitaniumErbiumNitrogenVanadiumEuropiumOxygenYitterbiumGadoliniumPhosphorusYtriumGalliumPotassiumZincGermaniumPraseodymiumZirconiumThe 16 Essential Vitamins for Humans and Non-human VertebratesVitamin AVitamin B1 (Thiamin)Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)Vitamin B3 (Niacin)Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid)Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamine)Vitamin CVitamin DVitamin EVitamin KBiotinCholineFlavonoids and bioflavonoidsFolic AcidInositolThe 12 Essential Amino AcidsValineLysineThreonineLeucineIsoleucineTryptophanePhenylalanineMethionineHistadineArginine* [part0031.html#ch2]Taurine* [part0031.html#ch2]Tyrosine* [part0031.html#ch2]*While not generally considered to be a classic essential amino acid, theirdeficiency does result in specific disease states.The Three Essential Fatty Acids and CholesterolLinoleic AcidLinolenic AcidArachidonic AcidCholesterol* [part0031.html#ch3]*While not generally considered a classic essential lipid, its deficiency doesresult in disease states (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes, erectiledysfunction, low-T, menopause, adrenal exhaustion, etc.).The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) have been prepared by the Food andNutrition Board since 1941. “RDAs are defined as the levels of intake ofessential nutrients that, on the basis of scientific knowledge, are judged bythe Food and Nutrition Board to be adequate to meet the known nutrient needs ofpractically all healthy persons.” This definition has remained unchanged since1974.The RDAs are derived from several different sources of evidence: 1. Studies of human subjects maintained on diets containing low or deficient levels of a nutrient, followed by a correction of the deficit with measured amounts of the nutrient; 2. Nutrient balance studies that measure nutrient status in relation to intake; 3. Biochemical measurements of tissue saturation or adequacy of molecular functions in relation to a specific nutrient intake; 4. Nutrient intakes of fully breastfed infants and of apparently healthy people from their food supply; 5. Epidemiological observations of nutrient status in populations in relation to intake; and 6. In some cases, extrapolation of data from animal experiments.In practice and reality, other than animal studies, there are extremely limiteddata from which one can estimate the optimal nutritional requirements of humans.Because there are “uncertainties in the knowledge base (of human nutrition), itis not possible to set the RDAs for all of the known essential nutrients basedon human data alone.VITAMINSVitamins are a collection of unrelated organic compounds that are necessary ascofactors for metabolic chemical reactions within cells and essential for normalgrowth and maintenance of health. Vitamins are essential nutrients in that mostcannot be manufactured in the body and many perform as coenzymes. Vitamins donot supply calories or contribute to body mass.Vitamins regulate metabolism, participate in the citric acid cycle andconversion of fat, sugar, carbohydrates and proteins into energy.There are three categories of vitamins: 1. Fat soluble 2. Water soluble 3. Flavanols-EpicatecchinsHistorically, vitamin deficiencies (rickets, night blindness, scurvy, beriberi,pellagra, arthritis, dementia, heart disease, birth defects, etc.) wereliterally the cause of disabilities and death in millions of sailors, soldiers,pioneers, slaves, minority races (such as Native Americans, Native Canadians,African-Americans, etc.) and children. Because of the medical community’signorance, bias, and lack of interest in food factors that could prevent andcure diseases, millions of humans have suffered terribly and died unnecessarilyeven after the truth was known for thousands of years by many alert individuals.In the 20th century, the medical community totally abandoned the greater pursuitof knowledge on the benefits of vitamin nutrition and vitamin therapies to bringimproved health, vitality, and longevity to humans for their pursuit of the new“Holy Grail”—mapping out the genome.All vertebrates, including man, require a minimum of sixteen vitamins,carbon-based essential nutrients that can prevent and cure hundreds of diseasesand extend life spans.It is well documented that longevity prediction can be attained by monitoringtelomere length. Telomere’s are short fragments of DNA that are described as“caps” at the end of the DNA in each cell and are likened to the “protectiveplastic tips at the end of a shoelace.”A telomere is a zone of repetitive nucleotide sequences at the end of achromatid, which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration andadditionally protects the end of the chromosome from fusing with a neighboringchromosome. The term “telomere” is derived from the Greek “telos” (end) and“meros” (part).During cell division, enzymes that promote the duplication of DNA are limited onhow many divisions they can support by how many nutritional cofactors areavailable. Deficiencies of nutrients result in a stoppage of DNA division.Every time a cell divides, the telomere at the end of the DNA string shortens.As telomeres shorten, the risk of degenerative diseases and cell death increasesdramatically. Telemeres are looked at as markers for biological aging. It hasbeen demonstrated that supplementation with multivitamins has protectedtelomeres, maintained telomere length and reduced oxidative damage andinflammation of the telomere structure.In 1975 Elizabeth Blackburn, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University, withJoseph Gall, identified the repeated DNA sequences composing the ends ofchromosomes. Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Breider, and Jack Szostak were awardedthe 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of howchromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.In addition to its protein segment, telomerase additionally contains a segmentof template RNA (Telomerase RNA). In humans, this telomere sequence is arepeating string of TTAGGG, between 3 and 20 kilobases in length.In the early 1970s Russian theorist Alexi Olovnikov first recognized thatchromosomes could not completely replicate their end pieces. His theory built onLeonard Hayflick’s observation that of limited somatic cell division (Hayflicklimit – 51 duplications), Olovnikov posited that DNA sequences were lost eachtime that cellular DNA replicates until the deterioration reaches an end point,at which time the ability of a cell to replicate come to an end.A privately funded effort by Geron, a biotech company, isolated the genes forthe RNA and protein component of human telomerase and to prove the relationshipbetween telomere shortening in cellular and telomerase reactivation in cell“immortalization.”It is now known that telomeres protect a cell’s chromosomes from fusing with aneighboring chromosome and from “rearranging-abnormalities” that can lead tocancer. Most cancer cells are the product of “immortal” cells that have systemsthat allow them to avoid apoptosis (programmed cell death).Specifically, higher doses of supplemental vitamins C, D, and E in both in vitroand in vivo studies maintained increased telomere length, delayed apoptosis(cell death), and extended life spans of nematodes and vertebrates.Fat Soluble VitaminsFat soluble vitamins, as the name implies, work in the fat (lipid) metabolism inthe vertebrate cell. Fat soluble vitamins can not be efficiently absorbed fromthe intestine when humans consume low fat diets. Individuals who have their gallbladder removed should supplement with ox bile to increase the volume of bilesalts which are required for the efficient absorption of the fat solublevitamins A, D, E, and K.Vitamin A (retinol) functionThis vitamin, isolated in 1913, which has many active forms including, retinol,retinoic acid and retinyl esters and precursors. Beta carotene is a fat solublevitamin A precursor that is required for maintenance of vision and night vision(the Egyptians employed beef liver juice, a natural source of vitamin A, to curenight blindness in 2000 BC), to maintain healthy skin and healthy mucusmembranes, bones, and teeth; it has been shown to reduce the risk if epithelialcancers.Many symptoms of vitamin A deficiency were recognized in the middle of the 19thcentury, and were associated with an “inadequacy of the diet.” The conditionknown as ophthalmia Brasiliana (keratoconis), a disease of the eyes thatprimarily afflicted poorly nourished slaves, was first described in 1865.In 1887 endemic night blindness was recognized among the orthodox RussianCatholics who fasted during the Lenten period. Of great interest was theobservation that nurslings of mothers who fasted were at high risk of sloughingulcers of the cornea. At the same time numerous reports of deficiency-inducedkeratomalacia followed from the four corners of the earth including the UnitedStates.Experimental, rather than observational evidence, led to the discovery ofvitamin A in 1913. Two groups (Osborne and Mendel; McCollum and Davis)independently reported that animals fed on artificial diets with lard as a solesource of fat developed a nutritional deficiency that could be corrected by theaddition of foods such as butter, egg yolk, and cod liver oil to the diet. Aprominent deficiency symptom of this restricted experimental diet wasxerophthalmia. Clinical and experimental vitamin A deficiencies were recognizedas being related in WWI, when it became obvious that xerophthalmia in humans wasthe result of a decrease in access to dietary butter.The simple observations of Steenbock (1919) that the vitamin A content ofvegetables was directly related to the degree of pigmentation; Euler et al(1929) and Moore (1929) found that the purified plant pigment carotene(provitamin A) was a very potent source of vitamin A. Retinol, a primaryalcohol, is present in high concentrations of marine fish liver (cod liver oil,etc.).Vitamin A has a number of functions in the body. It plays an essential role ingrowth stimulation, the maintenance and function of epithelial tissue includingthe retina, intestinal mucosa, and skin. Vitamin A is also known to function inthe synthesis of adrenocortical steroids, particularly in the conversions ofpregneno-lone to progesterone, of dehydroepiandrosterone to androstenedione, anddesoxycorticosterone to corticosterone. The conversion of squalene tocholesterol, other oxygenase-dependent reactions, and codeine demethylation aredepressed by a retinol deficiency.Vitamin A-deficiency health problems include:Night blindness (Nyctalopia)ConjunctivitisXerophthalmiaKeratomalacia (Keratoconus – corneal ulcers)InfertilityBirth defectsDepressionDepressed immune systemOsteopenia, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, osteomalaciaFailure to thrive, stunted growthAcneDermatitis (dry skin, keratitis, etc.)Hyperkeratosis (“goose flesh”)Ichthyosis (shark skin, Darier’s disease, etc.)Increased cancer riskSigns of overdose: too much vitamin A is indicated by headaches, blurred vision,fatigue, dysmenorrhea, joint and bone pain, dry cracked skin, hair loss,itchiness, birth defects (for example, malformation of the cranium, face, heart,thymus, and central nervous system), liver disease, and pseudo-jaundice (whenthe skin becomes orange or yellow as a result of high levels of beta caroteneintake, notably there is no yellowing or jaundice of the ocular sclera).Signs of toxicity usually appear only with sustained daily intakes of 50,000 IUof retinol for adults and 20,000 IU in infants.Vitamin D functionThis vitamin has two active forms: D2 the plant source and D3 the animal source,which is created by exposing the skin deposits of cholesterol to UV light.Vitamin D is required for the absorption, metabolism, and proper deposition ofcalcium and phosphorus in the bones and teeth.Rickets was a scourge of children from before medieval times through thesmog-filled days of the Industrial Revolution into the 20th century. Becauserickets was rarely associated with death, it was looked at with indifference andwas allowed to smolder amongst urban populations. People, particularly children,with curved spines, bowed legs and enlarged joints were so common as to seemnormal. During the Industrial Revolution there were so many causes of miserabledeaths that people were too busy trying to survive, to spend any effort on amalady that just made one uncomfortable or misshapen.Unfortunately for kids living in the major cities, particularly in Englandduring the Industrial Revolution, work hours were so long (12 hours) that thechildren were rarely outside during the day, and the sun was blocked by smog,smoke, and coal dust so that the sun’s light rarely shown through to thestreets. And though it was known for centuries that Scottish fisherman hadlearned how to prevent and cure rickets with cod liver oil, doctors resisted thesimple cure for centuries!One of the earliest common-sense theories of the cause and cure of rickets wasposited by Francis Glisson in the mid-17th century. He concluded that “a badenvironment” caused rickets. While he didn’t consider a dietary deficiency as acause he did realize that a lack of exposure to sunlight was a causative factor.The environmental association of lack of sunlight was cited over the next 150years. However, physicians continued to ignore the obvious and rickets continuedto deform millions, particularly in England and other coal-burning countries.Cod liver oil, the Scottish fisherman’s treatment for rickets, continued to beused by the lay community throughout the 19th century. Armand Trousseau, aFrench physician, treated his rickets patients with cod liver oil, sunshine, andbutter—proving to himself that diet and sunshine played a vital role in thecause, prevention, and cure of rickets. Trousseau’s findings, along with so manyvalid observations of the day, were generally disregarded by the medicalcommunity because they were obsessed in a search for the “rickets germ.”Early in the 20th century, two separate theories were developed for the cause ofrickets. One postulated that rickets was due to environmental factors,especially lack of sunlight, the second revisited Trousseau’s theory that dietwas involved. Dr. Kurt Hulschinsky, exposed rickets-deformed children fromBerlin to mercury quartz lamps, duplicating the sun’s ultraviolet light, andtheir limbs straightened out after two months.At the same time, in England, Edward Mellanby proved the Scottish fishermen’stale of curing rickets with cod liver oil to be correct. E.V. McCollum of JohnsHopkins destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil with heat, and it still hadantirachitic activity and cured and prevented rickets. At the same time, AlfredHess of New York noted that rats whose food had previously been exposed to thesun did not develop rickets. Fatty substances (ergosterol) in the food werebeing activated by the ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D2 (calciferol).Normal calcium and phosphorus absorption and metabolism is dependent on properlevels of vitamin D. Blood levels of these ions are influenced bygastrointestinal absorption, skeletal metabolism, and renal excretion, and arepredominantly under the control of vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, andthyrocalcitonin. The concentration of ionized Ca is also dependent upon blood pHand the concentration of plasma proteins. An understanding of the closerelationship between vitamin D to the parathyroid hormone is of major importancewhen considering the variety of effects enacted by vitamin D resulting from avariety of dietary and hormonal conditions. Vitamin D is required for the fullrange of parathyroid hormone functions.There are some who consider vitamin D a hormone, as there are similaritiesbetween vitamin D and hormone activity. Synthesis can take place in one site(for example, on the skin) and the target organ found elsewhere (a bone). Itsmechanism of action, similar to that of aldosterone, estrogens, andtestosterone, is thought to be linked to an action on DNA-directed syntheticprocesses.Studies indicate that the enhancement of intestinal absorption of Ca by vitaminD or its 25-hydroxy metabolite is related to an action that increases synthesisof a calcium-binding protein, and that this action takes place early in theprotein synthetic process, prior to, or at the step of, DNA-directed RNAsynthesis. The sequence of events: (1) location of vitamin D in the gut; (2)formation of the 25-hydroxy derivative; (3) stimulation of RNA synthesis; and(4) enhanced intestinal calcium absorption is consistent with the evidence thatsuggests that synthesis of a new protein is required for vitamin D activity.Deficiency: The universal deficiency of vitamin D in the 20th and 21st centuriesis a physician-caused disease. The doctor’s instructions dictated by the medicalcommunity to the American people to avoid exposure to the sun, wear sun blocker,wear wide-brimmed hats, long-sleeved shirts and gloves, avoid cholesterol in thediet (including egg yolks, chicken skin, dairy products, saturated fats, etc.),and not to take vitamin-mineral supplements turned out to be the “perfect storm”to create a universal vitamin D deficiency.Vitamin D-deficiency health problems include:Facial tics, Tourette’s syndromeTwitches, muscle crampsTetany (full body cramp), convulsionsChildhood rickets (rachitic rosary), bowed legs, knock-knees, pigeon chest,Profuse sweatingRestless leg syndromeEnlarged wrists, osteopenia, osteoporosis, periodontal disease, arthritis,osteoarthritis, degenerative arthritis, “bone to bone” arthritis, bone spurs,Kidney stones.Uterine fibroidsVitamin D deficiency is a physician-caused disease in the 20th and 21stcenturies because of bad advice (e.g., stay out of the sun, wear sun-blocker,wear long sleeves, do not eat egg yolks, do not take vitamins and minerals,etc.) and as a result is quite common in the United States. In the 20th and 21stcenturies, it has been determined that vitamin D deficiency can result in ahigher risk of cancer.Signs of vitamin D overdose: hypercalcemia (this sign can also be produced byraging Ca deficiency, nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, etc.),weakness, fatigue, lassitude, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Monkeyberg’s sclerosis(vascular calcification of the middle muscular layers of large and smallarteries), myocardial calcification, renal calcification, and soft tissuecalcification (of lung, skin, etc.).Consumption of 1,800 IU of cholecalciferol per day has been associated withsigns of hypervitaminosis in young children.Vitamin E function:This fat soluble vitamin, isolated in 1922, is actually a group of compoundsreferred to as alpha-tocopherols. It has antioxidant functions, protects cellmembranes from oxidative inflammation, protects red blood cells from lyses, andin combination with the trace mineral selenium it can reduce the risk of certaincancers. It slows down the aging process, preserves the length of telomeres andreduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, musculardystrophy, and cystic fibrosis, etc.The existence of vitamin E was first recognized in 1922 when it was learned thatfemale rats required a previously unknown dietary factor to maintainpregnancies. Deficient females would ovulate and conceive properly; however, atsome point in the pregnancy a spontaneous miscarriage would occur; additionally,lesions in the male’s testes were reported.Vitamin E-deficiency health problems include:Alzheimer’s diseaseAnemia (hemolytic)InfertilityDepressed immune systemAge spots, liver spotsLipid peroxidation, celluliteIschemic heart diseaseFibrocystic breast diseaseMuscle weakness, myalgia, polymyalgia, fibromyalgiaCystic fibrosis (in conjunction with selenium deficiency)Muscular dystrophy (in conjunction with selenium deficiency)Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (in conjunction with selenium deficiency)Increased risk of cancerSigns of overdose: Compared to the other fat soluble vitamins vitamin E isextremely safe when taken orally. Most adults have no problems taking up to 800mg/day, showing no clinical or biochemical signs of toxicity.Vitamin K (menaquinone) function:This vitamin, isolated in 1939, is a fat soluble vitamin that is required by theliver for the production of prothrombin and at least five other proteins(factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C and S) and other biologically activesubstances essential for proper blood clotting and for the proper deposition ofcalcium in bones. Approximately 50% of the requirement for vitamin K is producedby probiotic bacteria in the colon.Dam et al (1935, 1936) showed that hemorrhagic diseases that were not cured orprevented by any known vitamins could be quickly resolved by feeding an as yetunidentified fat-soluble substance, which he named vitamin K (Koagulationvitamin). Early studies showed that vitamin K was a fat-soluble substancepresent in hog liver fat and alfalfa (concentrated in the chloroplasts of plantleaves and in vegetable oils). Considerable quantities of vitamin K are found infeces of humans and animals because it is produced by enteric microorganisms.Vitamin K occurs in two forms: (1) K1 (phylloquinone) is produced by plants and(2) K2 (menaquinones) is synthesized by gram positive intestinal micro-organismsand appears as several compounds. The normal physiological function of vitamin Kis to promote the hepatic biosynthesis of prothrombin, proconvertin (factorVII), plasma thromboplastin component (PTC, Christmas factor, factor IX), andthe Stuart factor (factor X).Vitimin K-deficiency health problems include:Osteocalcin deficiencyExtended clotting timeEcchymoses, epistaxis (nose bleeds), hematuria, GI bleeding, etc.Liver diseaseDysfunction of calcium absorption and deposition in bones.Osteoporosis, spontaneous fracturesOsteoarthritisSigns of overdose: Symptoms include jaundice (kernicterus) in newborn infants;rapid intravenous injections of phylloquinone in adult humans can produceflushing, dyspnea, chest pain, and death. Large doses of menadione (notphylloquinone) administered to animals has produced hemolytic anemia,polycythemia (too many red blood cells), splenomegaly, kidney and liver damage(hyperbilirubinemia) and death.Water Soluble VitaminsThe B-complex consists of 10 separate water-soluble vitamins. In general theyfunction as essential nutrients in the metabolic processes of all living cellsby acting as cofactors in multiple enzyme systems that drive the oxidation offood and the production of energy.Vitamin C is a water-soluble antioxidant that can be synthesized by many mammalsbut not by guinea pigs or humans.Vitamin B1 (thiamine) function:This water soluble vitamin was discovered in 1897 and isolated in 1911. It is acofactor required for energy production and optimal metabolism of carbohydrates.Thiamine combines with phosphorous to form the coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate(TPP), which functions as a cocarboxylase enzyme. TPP is required for theoxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form active acetate and acetyl coenzymeA, the critical compound of the Krebs cycle. TPP is critical for the oxidativedecarboxylation of 2-ketocarboxylates produced from the amino acids methionine,threonine, leucine, isoleucine and valine. In addition TPP is also the coenzymefor the transketolase reaction, which functions in the pentose phosphate shunt,an alternative pathway for glucose oxidation.Thiamine is required for the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein, and fat.Thiamine deficiency specifically produces disturbances of carbohydratemetabolism, particularly in the brain (dementia) and heart (congestive heartfailure). The daily thiamine requirement is directly linked to the dietarycarbohydrate daily intake. This fact is indicative of the decarboxylation ofpyruvate, which is only connected to carbohydrate metabolism which is dependenton the presence of thiamine (B1).Events leading to the identification of thiamine occurred in the 19th century,when Takaki, a Japanese naval officer, eliminated the death rate from beriberiin the Japanese Navy simply by eliminating polished rice, replacing it withbrown rice, and adding a broad range of foods.Eijkman, a Dutch physician in Java, showed that patients that developed beriberiwhile eating polished rice could be cured by the reintroduction of the rice branto their diet. He also experimentally produced beriberi in chickens when he fedthem polished rice. Some years later, Funk produced a crystalline substance fromrice polishings and yeast that was effective in the prevention and cure ofexperimentally produced beriberi. The substance contained a high pH (basic)nitrogen (amine), so Funk called it a vit- (vital) amine. The term was acceptedas a broad label for dietary substances that were deemed to be dietaryessentials.Thiamine (B1)-deficiency health problems include:Anxiety, hysteria, confusionNauseaDepressionMental confusionAnorexiaMuscular weaknessFibromyalgiaBeriberi (muscle wasting, congestive heart failure, Korsakoff syndrome[dementia] and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome [dementia & MS])Paralysis.Peripheral neuropathiesSigns of overdose: Vitamin B1 overdose can result in a relative reactivedeficiency of B2 and B6.Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) function:Vitamin B2, discovered in 1879 and isolated in 1932, is a key cofactor for twoflavin coenzymes that are required for oxidation-reduction reactions and energyproduction flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).Among the enzymes that require riboflavin is the FMN-dependent oxidaseresponsible for conversion of phosphorylated pyridoxine to functional coenzymeand the FAD-dependent hydroxylase involved in the conversion of tryptophan toniacin. Riboflavin is also required to maintain healthy skin, mucus membranes,cornea of the eye, and nerve sheaths.Riboflavin-deficiency health problems include:Chelosis (cracks at the corners of the mouth and nostrils)Angular stomatitisSeborrheic dermatitis of the nasal foldsSoreness and burning of lips, mouth and tongueGeographic tongue, magenta tonguePhotophobiaLacrimation (tearing)Capillary “injection” of corneaAnemiaNeuropathySigns of overdose: Vitamin B2 overdose can result in a relative deficiency in B1and B6.Vitamin B3 (niacin, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, niacinamide) function:Vitamin B3, isolated in 1900, functions in humans as a part of the coenzymesnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidephosphate (NADP), known as the pyridine nucleotides. These coenzymes interactwith cellular respiratory enzymes. They are essential to the oxidation-reductionreactions in the release of energy from carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Thesecoenzymes in their reduced forms are NADH and NADPH. In addition NAD is requiredfor glycogen synthesis.In the early part of the 18th century, a disease that was characterized by arough, red scaly dermatitis, flourished in Europe. Nearly 200 years later, thedisease was still devastating human populations, particularly in Spain, Italy,and the southern regions of the United States. Pellegra, was an “epidemic” inthe U.S.in the period between the Civil War and the early 1900s. It appearedwith such frequency that medical experts were confident that it was aninfectious disease that was spred from one person to another; others thought itwas caused by eating rotten corn; others thought it was spread by a species offly because it occurred at higher rates in the spring when flies were attackinghumans in noisy-winged hords.Even though pellagra was seen to be consistently related to corn-based diets,again the medical doctors were convinced it was caused by germs and isolatedpellagra patients in “retardation centers” in much the same fashion as puttingtuberculosis patients in sanitariums for isolation and recovery.Dr.Joseph Goldberger, was one of the first physicians to be convinced thatpellagra was a deficiency disease. He began to experiment with the diets ofchildren in a Mississippi orphanage who were on a corn-based diet and sufferedfrom pellagra. After adding meat, milk, and eggs to their diets, pellagradisappeared.In 1915 Dr. Goldberger conducted a classic experiment in human nutrition. Forsix months Goldberger fed prisoners in a Mississippi prison farm the typicaldiet of people who were hard hit with pellagra. After they developed symptoms ofthe disease he changed their diets to include meat, milk, or yeast and thesymptoms rapidly disappeared.Physicians remained skeptical until 1937, when Conrad Elvehjem at the Universityof Wisconsin reported that dogs with experimentally produced pellagra could becured with a form of “niacin” named nicotinic acid. Purified niacin was thenused on human patients with classic signs of pellagra and their disease wascured When niacin status was gauged by urinary metablyte levels, the quantitiesof supplementary tryptophan required to give the same response as one mg ofniacin ranged from 39 to 86 mg. Convention allows that 60 mg of tryptophan isequivalent to one mg of niacin.Vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency health problems include:Pellagra which includes the “three Ds” (diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia)RetardationMuscular weaknessAnorexia“Beef tongue” (swollen, sore, red tongue)Skin pigmentationScaly, itchy dermatitisSigns of overdose: Vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid only) overdose can result in hotflushes of the skin, ulcers, liver disease, elevated blood sugar and uric acid,cardiac arrhythmia, and dry, itchy skin.The ingestion of a pharmacological dose of nicotinic acid ranging from three tonine grams per day produces a variety of metabolic symptoms, including anincreased utilization of muscle glycogen stores, decreased serum lipids (i.e.,it lowers cholesterol, etc.), and decreased mobilization of fatty acids fromadipose tissue during exercise.Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) function:When scientists discovered pantothenic acid in the 1930s, they were notsearching for a cause, prevention, or cure for any particular disease. In fact,they were looking for a nutrient that would stimulate the growth of yeast. Alongthe way, investigators found a substance that would support the growth of yeast,that when missing in animal diets would produce deficiency diseases.The symptoms of pantothenic acid deficiency varied from one animal species toanother. In general, however, animals that were placed on pantothenicacid-deficient diets demonstrated a reduced growth rate, anemia, nervedegenerative diseases, reduced immune functions, gastric ulcers, and a widevariety of birth defects.Pantothenic acid, aka vitamin B5, was isolated in 1940. Its primaryphysiological roles as a component of the coenzyme A molecule and within the4’phosphopantetheine moiety of the acyl carrier protein of fatty acidsynthetase, that serves in acyl-group activation and transfer reactions. Thesereactions are essential for the release of energy from carbohydrates; ingluconeogenesis; in the synthesis and degradation of fatty acids; in thesynthesis of such essential compounds as sterols and steroid hormones,porphyrins, and acetylcholine; and in acylation reactions.Pantothenic acid-deficiency health problems include:DermatitisBurning feetMuscle crampsAnorexiaAnemiaQuarrelsome attitudeSullenDepressedInsomniaDepressed immune systemTachycardiaFainting (“light headedness”)GI distress (gas, diarrhea, gut pain)Signs of overdose: Vitamin B5 overdose (10 to 20 grams per day) can result in arelative deficiency of thiamine, diarrhea, and edema.Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) function:Vitamin B6, originally designated B3, is found as three chemically,metabolically, and functionally related structures pyridoxine (pyridoxol, PN),pyridoxal (PL), and pyridoxamine (PM). These structures are converted in theliver, red blood cells, and other tissues to pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) andpyridoxamine phosphate (PMP), which act primarily as coenzymes in transaminationreactions. PLP also participates in decarboxylation and racemization of A inamino acids, in other metabolic transformations of amino acids, and themetabolism of lipids and nucleic acids. In addition, B6 is the essentialcoenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase. The phosphoric esters of the active formsof vitamin B6 are hydrolyzed before release from cells. Also, PL can be furtheroxidized to pyridoxic acid and other inactive oxidation products, which areexcreted in the urine.The various food forms of vitamin B6 are absorbed by intestinal mucosal cellsthrough a nonsaturable process. Cellular B6 is metabolically phosphorylated, andtwo of the phospho-forms (PNP and PMP) are oxidized to PLP. PLP is largelypresent in the plasma as a PLP-albumin complex and in erythrocytes inassociation with hemoglobin.The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey done in 1980 revealed that the U.S.consumption of pyridoxine fell below 70% of the RDA in 50% of the individualssurveyed. The use of prescription medications including birth control pills,steroids, or antibiotics such as isoniazid (for the treatment of tuberculosis)or penicillamine, increases the need for pyridoxine. There are some individualswith an inborn error of metabolism and sickle-cell anemia that will respond toB6 supplementation.Pyridoxine (B6) deficiency health problems include:Depression, mental confusionInflammation of the oral mucus membranesNauseaVomitingPMSSeborrheic dermatitisItchy scaly skinOral mucus membrane lesionsCarpal tunnel syndromeTMJPeripheral neuritisAtaxia (instability)Hyperirritability.Head tic (Tourette’s syndrome)Siezures. ConvulsionsSigns of overdose: Vitamin B6 overdose can result in peripheral neuropathies infingers and legs.Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) function:The search for vitamin B12 began in 1926, following the observation thatindividuals with pernicious anemia could cure the disease by consuming a poundof raw liver per day. Dr. William Castle theorized that the liver contained anantipernicious anemia (APA) factor. He also theorized that individuals whodeveloped pernicious anemia lacked an intrinsic factor (Castle’s IntrinsicFactor) that was required for the utilization of the APA factor.The pursuit of the APA factor was slow and elusive until 1948 (because humansstored and recycled vitamin B12), when an unusual “experimental animal” wasdiscovered that could be used for testing. The ideal laboratory animal turnedout to be a microorganism, Lactobacillus lactis.Later in 1948, two independent teams (one in the UK and the other in the U.S)were able to isolate the pure APA factor: vitamin B12. They were able to glean20 mg of the B12 from a ton of liver.The terms vitamin B12 and cobalamin are used for all of the cobalt-containingcorrinoids that can be converted to methylcobalamin or 5’-deoxyadenosylcobalaminthe two cobalamine coenzymes active in human metabolism. Cyanocobalamin is theprimary commercial form of vitamin B12 found in vitamin pills andpharmaceuticals. This form is water soluble and heat resistant, and when it isingested or injected it is converted (by the removal of cyanide) to the formsthat are metabolically useful in vertebrates including humans.In plasma and tissue, the primary forms of B12 are methylcobalamin,adenosylcobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin. Animal products and bacterialfermentation are the most common sources of B12. The most common forms of B12 inmeat are adenosyl-and hydroxocobalamin; in dairy products (including humanbreast milk) the most common forms are methyl-and hydroxocobalamin.Bacteria, fungi, and algae can synthesize vitamin B12. However, yeast, higherplants and animals of all forms are unable to. Vitamin B12 and folate are bothrequired for the synthesis of DNA and RNA, which carry the human genome forevery living cell. Vitamin B12 is required to support the function of bonemarrow and the production of myelin (nerve fiber insulation coating) and a keyrole in folic acid metabolism. It is required to release free folate from itsbound form so it can be absorbed, transported and stored. A deficiency ofvitamin B12 will result in a folic acid deficiency even though the intake offolic acid is optimal. A deficiency of either vitamin produces a similar form ofmacrocytic, megaloblastic anemia.Deficiency: The deficiency of cyanocobalamine can result from an overt dietarydeficiency as well as secondary to hypochlorhydria (lack of stomach acid), saltdeficiency, and gluten intolerance.Vitimin B12 deficiency health problems include:Pernicious anemia (macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia)DementiaNeuropsychiatric behaviorBrain, spinal cord, optic nerve and peripheral nerve demyelinationNeuropathySore tongueGeneral weaknessLiver diseaseSigns of overdose: For vitamin B12 overdose: “No clear toxicity has beenreported from daily oral consumption of B12 in doses of up to 100 ug.”Folic Acid (Folacin) vitamin B9 function:Folic acid was identified in 1946. It is required for the synthesis of DNA andRNA and erythrocytes. Folate and folacin are generic terms for compounds thathave nutritional activity and chemical structures like those of folic acid(pteroyglutamic acid, or PGA). Metabolically active forms of folate have reduced(tetrahydro) pteridine rings and many glutamic acids attached (polyglutamates).Folates act metabolically as coenzymes that transport single carbon units fromone compound to another in amino acid metabolism and nucleic acid (DNA and RNA)synthesis. Folates and vitamin B12 work interdependently. A deficiency of eithervitamin produces a megaloblastic, macrocytic anemia. In 1930 Lucy Wills and herinvestigating team reported that “yeast contained a substance that could curemacrocytic anemia in pregnant women. However, it was not until 1946 that folicacid was isolated.Many medications interfere with folic acid absorption and metabolism includingmethotrexate, aspirin, oral contraceptives, anti-convulsives, anti-psoriatic,and cancer treatment pharmaceuticals.Deficiency: The deficiency of folic acid can result from a diet lacking in greenleafy vegetables and from malabsorption problems (such as gluten intolerance[includes bourbon, scotch and beer], celiac disease, leaky gut syndrome, IBS,etc.) and can include:Impaired cell divisionBirth defects (Neural tube defects (hydroencephaloceole, spina bifida, etc.)Failure to thriveAnemiaDiarrheaBleeding gumsWeight lossirritabilityOverdose of folic acid: This can cause a relative zinc deficiency by impairingabsorption.Biotin (B7 or vitamin H) function:In the early 1930s, an English investigator from the Lister Institute ofPreventative Medicine in London fed laboratory rats on egg whites for severalweeks, which produced an eczema type of skin inflammation, alopecia, paralysis,and subcutaneous hemorrhaging. It was called the “egg white syndrome.” In 1940Paul Gyorgy identified the substance to cure this as biotin or vitamin H. It isrequired for glucose metabolism and for the production of fatty acids. Biotin isa sulfur-containing vitamin. Biotin is an important part of enzymes thatfacilitate the transport of carboxyl units and fix carbon dioxide in animaltissue. The conversion of biotin to the active form of the coenzyme is dependenton the presence of magnesium and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).Two biotin enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA)carboxylase, are required for gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis. A Fattyliver and fatty kidneys, hypoglycemia, and reduced gluconeogenesis in the liverare common in a biotin deficiency state. Two other biotin enzymes, propionyl-CoAcarboxylase and 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase, are essential for proprionatemetabolism and the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids.The consumption of raw egg whites for weeks can produce a biotin deficiencybecause it contains avidin, a substance that binds with biotin in the intestineand prevents its absorption.The deficiency of the biotin enzymes results in the urinary excretion of organicacids, skin rash, and alopecia. Multiple carboxylase deficiencies are commonlythe result of defective holocarboxylase synthetase, which is required for theconversion of inactive apocarboxylase to form active carboxylase by thesupplementation of biotin. This inborn error of metabolism can be “overcome” inan epigenetic fashion by supplementation of large doses of biotin.Biotin-deficiency health problems can result in:Eczema, dermatitisAlopecia (baldness)Myalgia (muscle pain)FatigueFatty liverInborn errors of metabolismDepressionHyperesthesia, paraesthesiaBlephritisGray, silver or white hairAnorexiaInsomnia.Weight lossHallucinationsSigns of biotin overdose: The LD50 is unknown and there have not been anycredible reports of toxicity from large doses of biotin, even with doses greaterthan 10 mg daily.Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) function:Vitamin C required cofactor for the production of collagen, connective tissue,cartilage, bones, teeth, blood vessel walls, capillaries, and it also increasesthe efficiency of absorption of inorganic iron.Scurvy, characterized by muscle weakness, lethargy, and subcutaneous bleeding,was recorded before the Christian era. Ship’s logs reported a common andwidespread disease of sailors during the 16th century; it was a common diseaseduring the American Civil War and in Antarctic explorers, including adventurerCaptain Robert Scott and his crew who died of scurvy as late as 1912.Cures for scurvy were recorded shortly after the naming of the disease,including green salads, fruit, vegetables, pickled cabbage, scallions, youngonions, and drinks made from wormwood, horseradish, and mustard seed. In 1530the French explorer, Jacques Cartier reported how the natives of Newfoundlandcured his crew’s scurvy with a tea made from pine trees.Scurvy continued to be the “scurge of the navy” 200 years later when Dr. JamesLind, began an experiment that identified a cure for scurvy. Lind gave sixdifferent supplements to the ship’s standard diet. To one pair of men in eachgroup, he gave a different supplement: 1. Sulfuric acid solution 2. Cider 3. Sea water 4. Vinegar 5. Blend of garlic, mustard seed, balsam of Peru and gum myrrh 6. Two oranges and a lemon dailyThe sailors who consumed the fruit recovered quickly, the sailors that took thecider had a small improvement in two weeks; however, none of the othersimproved. Lind quickly published his experimental results, although it would beanother 50 years before the British navy added limes to their sailor’s diets.In 1932 vitamin C was isolated by C. G. King and W. A. Waugh from the Universityof Pittsburgh, and by Albert Szent-Gyorgyi in Hungary. Szent-Gyorgyi knew thatthe vitamin had some similarities to sugar, and he initially proposed that thesubstance be named “ignosco,” Latin for “I do not know” and “ose” the suffixcommon to sugars. The editor of a British journal refused to accept the name,prompting Szent-Gyorgyi to offer the alternative name of “godnose.” Ultimately,when Szent-Gyorgyi’s article was published, the vitamin was dubbed hexuronicacid and later the name was changed to ascorbic—“without scurvy”—acid.The biochemical properties of vitamin C include its function as a cosubstrate inhydroxylations requiring molecular oxygen, as in the hydroxylation of prolineand lysine in the formation of collagen, of dopamine to norepinephrine, and oftryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophane. It is also involved in reactions involving aseries of other compounds including tyrosine, folic acid, histamine,corticosteroids, neuroendocrine peptides, and bile acids. Vitamin C also affectsthe functions of white blood cells, macrophages, immune responses, woundhealing, and allergic reactions. Ascorbic acid increases the absorptionefficiency of elemental iron when they are consumed together.Vitamin C deficiency can result in:Bleeding gumsLoose teethBruisingDry rough skinAnorexiaPoor growthElevated cancer riskSlow wound healingScurvySkin hemorrhagesSwollen joints (particularly wrist and ankles)Rib and cartilage fracturesSigns of overdose: Too much vitamin C can result in tissue deposits of oxalatecrystals, urinary tract inflammation, diarrhea, lyses (breakage of cell walls)of red blood cells,Choline function:Choline has been known to be present in mammalian tissue, including human, sinceit was initially discovered and isolated from hog bile in 1862. It can bebiosynthesized from ethanolamine and methyl groups derived from the essentialamino acid methionine, however, it is believed that most of the humans source isderived from dietary phosphatides.Choline is a major structural component of larger molecules; as a component ofphosphatidylcholine (lecithin), it is essential to the structure of all cellmembranes, plasma lipoproteins, and pulmonary surfactants; in the centralnervous system, choline functions as a structural component of sphingomyelin andthe neurotransmitter acetylcholine.Choline deficiency can result in:Fatty liverLiver cirrhosisKidney hemorrhageAlzheimer’s disease, dementiaTardive dyskinesiaHuntington’s diseaseOverdose: None knownInositol function:Inositol—aka myo-inositol, is a cyclic alcohol (cyclohexanehexol) that ischemically similar to glucose. There are nine inositol isomers, however,myo-inositol is the only one of metabolic importance for plant and animalmetabolism. It is found in plants as phytic acid and in animals myo-inositol isa major constituent of phospholipids in biomembranes. Myo-inositol is believedto be an essential nutrient because myo-inositol triphosphate is a secondmessenger for receptor-mediated hormonal stimuli for mobilizing intracellularcalcium. Additionally, myo-inositol appears to have a lipotrophic function thatmay originate from its vital role as a substrate for the biosynthesis ofphosphatidyl inositol and polyphos-hoinositides, which are essential for thestructure of biomembranes.Inositol deficiency can result in:Fat metabolism problemsIntestinal lipodystrophyFatty liverDiabetes mellitusDiabetic neuropathySlow nerve conduction velocityRenal failure GalactosemiaSigns of overdose: none are known, even with “large supplemental doses.”Bioflavonoids function:Bioflavonoids, a diverse group of carbon compounds that are biologically active,were isolated in 1936. While not generally considered essential nutrients, thereis more than enough evidence to support a claim for essentiality. The name,flavonoids or bioflavonoids, was derived from the Latin, flavus, whichtranslates to the color yellow common in flavonoids. Flavanoids were originallyreferred to as vitamin P, as they were related to the permeability levels ofsmall blood vessels.There are three classes of flavonoids: 1. Flavonoids or bioflavonoids 2. Isoflavonoids (e.g., 3-phenylchromen-4-one) 3. Neoflavonoids (e.g., 4-phenylcoumarine)Flavonoids are widely associated with plants. Flavonoids are plant pigments thatare found in flowers as yellow, red and blue petals, these colors areattractants for pollinating insects and animals indirectly associated with theannual sexual cycle of plants. In plants, bioflavonoids also act as chemicalmessengers, physiological messengers, and cell cycle inhibitors.Flavonoids are known to have a wide range of biological and pharmaceuticaleffects in in vitro studies of human cell cultures. In the whole person (in vivostudies) supplementation with flavonoids have demonstrated clinicaleffectiveness for reducing or eliminating allergies, vascular and pulmonaryinflammation, for increasing ORAC antioxidant activity, antimicrobial properties(e.g., bacteria, viruses, yeast, fungus), improving gastrointestinal functionand supporting the immune system in cancer patients.Flavonoid containing grape-seed extracts have demonstrated protectiveantioxidant properties against reactive oxygen species in the gastrointestinaltract.Studies at the Pauling Institute suggest that the antioxidant effects in humanblood are produced by bioflavonoids are due to an increase in the production ofuric acid related to the excretion of flavonoids.Studies suggest that flavonoids produce an anti-inflammatory effect via amodulation or through their ability to inhibit reactive oxygen and nitrogencompounds. Flavonoids are also thought to inhibit the pro-inflammatory activityof enzymes that produce free radicals including cycloioxygenase, lipoxygenase orinducible nitric oxide synthase, and to modify intracellular signaling pathwaysin immune cell species.Procyanidins, a class of flavonoids, have been shown to have anti-inflammatorymechanisms, including the modulation of the arachidonic acid pathway, inhibitionof gene transcription, protein expression and activity of inflammatory enzymesas well as secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators.It is well documented that flavonoids have a positive role in reducing the riskof cardiovascular disease by: 1. Inhibiting coagulation, thrombus formation, and platelet aggregation 2. Reducing risk of atherosclerosis 3. Reducing arterial blood pressure and hypertension 4. Reducing oxidative stress and related signaling pathways of vascular cells 5. Modifying vascular inflammatory mechanisms 6. Improving endothelial and capillary function 7. Modifying blood lipid levels 8. Regulating carbohydrate and glucose metabolism 9. Modifying the mechanisms of agingBioflavonoid deficiency can result in:Capillary hemorrhageReduced immune capacityWidespread free radical injury and inflammationHemorrhoidsVenous insufficiencyLeg ulcersBruisingNosebleedsIncreased cancer riskShortened lifespanReduced telomere length and viabilityAMINO ACIDSAmino acids are a basic group of structural and biologically active organiccompounds. Amino acids are identified by the presence of amine (-NH2) andcarboxylic acid (-COOH) functional groups. The primary elements of amino acidsare carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen; however, other elements are presenton side chains of each structure. About 500 different amino acids are known.Amino acids are the basic structural unit of proteins, and are second only towater in human muscle, cells, tissues and organs. Amino acids are also essentialto the function of neurotransmission, transport. and biosynthesis.In 1806 French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquetisolated a substance from asparagus that they named “asparagine”—the first aminoacid had been identified.There are nine amino acids that are classically considered to be “essential”amino acids: Histidine, Isoleucine, leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine,Threonine, Tryptophan and Valine. These amino acids can’t be synthesized byhumans and must be consumed on a daily basis to prevent deficiencies and diseaseconsequences. Three additional amino acids, Arginine, Taurine and Tyrosine arenot classically considered to be essential. However, the deficiency of theseamino acids does result in specific deficiency diseases and are thereforeconsidered here.ArginineArginine (Arg) was first isolated in 1886 from a lupin seedling by the Swisschemist Ernst Schultze and is synthesized from citrulline by the sequentialemployment of the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) andargininosuccinate lyase (ASL). This process is expensive in terms of energysince the production of each molecule of argininosuccinate requires hydrolysisof adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and bysupplementing with arginine, more ATP is available to provide cell functionfuel.At the structural level of molecular genetics, the messenger ribonucleic acid(mRNA), CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG are the triplets of nucleotide bases(codons) that code for arginine during protein synthesis.Arginine is required for complete and efficient cell division, wound healing,facilitating the biological use of and the excretion of ammonia, immune systemsupport, and the availability of stored hormones. The oral supplementation ofarginine is required for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), the reduction ofhealing time following trauma, and is particularly useful for bone trauma; itreduces blood pressure and increases blood flow through obstructed bloodvessels.Arginine (8%) toothpaste produces rapid and effective relief from dental pain byproducing a dentin-like material that is made up of calcium and phosphate thatis deposited in the dentin tubules and on the surface of dentin.Arginine is commonly employed concurrently with proanthocyanidines or yohimbinefor the relief of erectile dysfunction.HistidineHistidine (His) is an amino acid with an alpha amino acid with an imidazolefunctional group. It is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Histidine wasfirst isolated in 1896 by the German physician Albrecht Kossel.The imidazole sidechain of histidine is a coordinating ligand of metalloproteinsand is a part of catalytic sites in certain enzymes. In catalytic triads, thebasic nitrogen of histidine is used to abstract a proton from serine, threonine,or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle,histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. Histidine is also required forhaemoglobin in helices E and F. Histidine supports the stabilization ofoxyhaemoglobin and the destabilization of CO (carbon monoxide) haemoglobin. As aresult, carbon monoxide binding is less than 200 times stronger in haemoglobin,compared to 20,000 times stronger in free haem.IsoleucineIsoleucine (Ile) is an alpha amino acid with the codons AUU, AUC, and AUA. As aresult of its hydrocarbon side chain, isoleucine is classed as a hydrophobicamino acid. In 1903 Felix Ehrlich, a German chemist, isolated isoleucine fromhemoglobin.Isoleucine is both a glucogenic and ketogenic amino acid. Followingtransamination with alphaketogluterate, the carbon skeleton can be convertedinto Succinyl CoA, and then fed into the TCA cycle for oxidation, or convertedinto oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (i.e., glucogenic). In mammals, includinghumans, Acetyl CoA can’t be converted back to carbohydrate; however, it can beemployed in the synthesis of ketone bodies or fatty acids – it is ketogenic.LeucineLeucine (Leu) is a branched chain alpha amino acid that is classified as ahydrophobic amino acid. It has six codons (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG) andis a significant part of the subunits of ferritin, astacin, and a class of“buffer” proteins.Leucine has major functions in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle. In muscleand adipose tissue, leucine is employed to synthesize sterols and its combineduse in these tissues is larger than that used by the liver. Leucine is solelyresponsible for the synthesis of muscle proteins.Leucine is important as a catalysts for muscle growth and muscle “insurance.”Additionally, leucine activates the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase thatregulates cell growth.Leucine toxicity, manifested as in decompensated Maple Syrup Urine Disease(MSUD), produces delirium, neurologic compromise and can be life threatening.Excessive leucine intake can produce clinical pellagra (“the four D’s”), i.e.,diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death.LysineLysine (Lys) is an essential amino acid with the codons AAA and AAG. Lysine is abase, as are arginine and histidine. Lysine participates in hydrogen bonding anda general base in catalysis. Common post-transitional modifications of lysineinclude methylation producing methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethyllysine.Lysine in mammals is metabolized to produce acetyl-CoA through an initialtransamination with alpha ketogluterate. Allysine is a derivative of lysine andis required for the production of elastin and collagen. It is produced by theactivity of the enzyme lysyl oxidase (requires a copper cofactor) on lysine andis essential for the crosslink formation that acts to stabilizes collagen andelastin. Lysine consumption contributes to the prevention and repair of spiderveins, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, and aneurysms.In the 1993 big-screen film Jurassic Park (based on the 1990 Michael Crichtonnovel) featured dinosaurs that were brought back by DNA engineering from DNAcollected from fossilized dinosaurs. The script featured the story that thedinosaurs were altered so that they could not produce lysine (the “lysinecontingency”) that would prevent the dinosaurs survival outside of the park,thus forcing them to be dependent on lysine supplements provided by the park’ssupplement program.MethionineMethionine (Met) is a nonpolar amino acid with a single codon, AUG. Methionineis a sulfur-containing proteinogenic amino acid with the derivative S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which serves as a methyl donor. Methionine is an intermediatein the biosynthesis of cysteine, carnitine, taurine, lecithin,phosphatidylcholine, and other phospholipids. The AUG codon is the most commoneukaryote “Start” message for a ribosome that signals the initiation of proteintranslation from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a Kozak consensus sequence.Methionine is employed by plants for the synthesis of ethylene, the process isknown as the Yang Cycle or the methionine cycle.Methionine is converted to S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) by methionineadenosyltransferase. SAM serves as a methyl-donor in several methyltransferasereactions, and is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).Adenosylhomocysteinase converts SAH to homocysteine, which is then employed toregenerate methionine or to synthesize cysteine.Laboratory rats fed a methionine-free diet developed steatohepatitis (fattyliver disease), anemia, and lost two thirds of their body weight over fiveweeks. Supplementation with methionine resolved all of the disease problems ofthe study group.Some studies have shown that restriction of methionine can increase lifespans oflaboratory animals. A study, published in Nature, demonstrated that addingmethionine to the diets of fruit flies under dietary calorie restrictionrestored fecundity without reducing the longer lifespans that are typical ofdietary restriction.PhenylalaninePhenylalanine (Phe) is an alpha amino acid that is classified as nonpolarbecause of the hydrophobic nature of its benzyl side chain. Phenylalanine is oneof twenty amino acids employed biochemically to synthesize proteins coded for byDNA. The codons for phenylalanine are UUU and UUC.The first reports of the isolation of phenylalanine were made in 1879 by Schulzeand Barbieri, who isolated the amino acid from the yellow lupine (Lupinusluteus). In 1882, Erienmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine fromphenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide and ammonia.Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine signaling moleculesdopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and theskin and hair pigment melanin (this procedure requires the cofactor copper).Phenylalanine employs the same active transport channel as tryptophan to crossthe blood-brain barrier, in large doses it will interfere with the production ofserotonin.The inborn error of metabolism known as phenylketonuria (PKU), falsely believedto be a genetically-transmitted disease, is the inability to metabolizephenylalanine. Avoidance of phenylalanine prevents the symptoms of PKU.A non-food source of phenylalanine is the non-sugar sweetener aspartame marketedas Equal and NutraSweet, both of which are metabolized into several chemicalbyproducts including phenylalanine. Thus, all products in Australia, the UnitedStates, and Canada that contain aspartame are labeled “Phenylketonurics:Contains phenylalanine.” In the UK, foods containing aspartame must be labeled“aspartame or E951” and they must be labeled with the warning “Contains a sourceof phenylalanine.” In Brazil, the label “Contem Fenilalanina” (Portuguese for“Contains Phenylalanine”) is mandatory for aspartame containing products.DL-Phenylalanine is marketed as a nutritional supplement as a sleep aid, ananti-depressant and as an analgesic (pain reliever).TaurineTaurine (Ta) has many biological roles including the conjugation of bile acids,acts as an antioxidant, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization, and modulationof calcium signaling. Taurine is essential for the functioning of thecardiovascular system, skeletal muscle, the retina and the central nervoussystem. Taurine is unique in that it is a sulfonic acid, whereas the majority ofbiologically occurring acids contain the carboxyl group.Taurine is named after the Latin Taurus, which means bull or ox, as it was firstisolated from ox bile in 1827 by the German scientists Friedrich Tiedermann andLeopold Gmelin.Taurine is required for the maintenance of skeletal muscle and the maintenanceof healthy blood pressure. Taurine deficiency can produce cataracts and retinaldamage.Doses of taurine in excess of 2 gm/day have been shown to contribute to thegenesis of psoriasis.ThreonineThreonine (Thr) is an alpha amino acid that is classified as polar; its codonsare ACU, ACA, ACC, and ACG. Together with serine, threonine is one of only twoproteinogenic amino acids that bear an alcohol group. The threonine residue issusceptible to numerous post-transitional modifications; it can undergoglycosylation and phosphorylation through the action of threonine kinase.Threonine is converted to pyruvate via threonine dehydrogenase, an intermediatein this pathway can undergo thiolysis with CoA to produce acetyl-CoA andglycine; it can also be converted to alpha ketobutyrate via the enzyme serinedehydrogenase entering the pathway leading to succinyl-CoA.TryotophanTryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid encoded in the standard genetic codeas the codon UGG. Only L-tryptophan is used in structural enzyme proteins. TheD-tryptophan form is found in marine venom peptides called contryphan.Tryptophan was isolated in 1901 by Frederick Hopkins via hydrolysis of casein(milk protein). Tryptophan is employed as a building block of proteinbiosynthesis and is a biochemical precursor of serotonin (a neurotransmitter),synthesized via tryptophan hydroxylase. Serotonin can be converted to melatonin(a neurohormone); niacin is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine andquinolinic acids as essential biosynthetic intermediates; auxin (a phytohormone)is produced when sieve tube elements undergo apoptosis (programed cell-death),tryptophan is converted to auxins.The disorders, fructose malabsorption, lactose intolerance, and glutenintolerance cause a reduced state of tryptophan absorption from the intestine,therefore causing reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood and clinicaldepression. Tryptophan supplements are sold as sleep aids.A metabolite of tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), has been suggested as atreatment for seizure disorders and depression. It rapidly crosses the bloodbrain barrier and is rapidly decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or5-HT).In 1989 there was a large tryptophan-associated outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgiasyndrome (EMS) which caused at least 1,500 cases of permanent disability and atleast 37 deaths. The problem was traced to a supply of L-tryptophan that wasproduced and exported to the United States by a Japanese manufacturer, ShowaDenko KK. The final explanation for the outbreak of EMS, was that “large dosesof tryptophan gave rise to metabolites that inhibit the normal rate ofdegradation of histamine, and excess histamine in turn was proposed as the causeof EMS.”TyrosineTyrosine (Tyr ) is one of 22 amino acids that are employed by cells tosynthesize proteins; its codons are UAC and UAU. The origin of the word“tyrosine” is the Greek word for cheese, as it was first isolated in 1846 fromcheese by the German chemist Justus von Liebig.In addition to being a proteinogenic amino acid, tyrosine has a special functionbecause of its phenol functionality. Tyrosine is found in proteins that are partof a signal transduction function. It acts as a receiver of phosphate groupsthat are transferred by means of protein kinases. Phosphorylation of thehydroxyl group alters the activity of the target protein.In plants, tyrosine residues play an essential role in photosynthesis. Inchloroplasts, tyrosine acts as an electron donor in the reduction of oxidizedchlorophyll. In this process tyrosine undergoes deprotonation of its phenolicOH-group. This radical is ultimately reduced in the photosystem ll by the fourcore manganese clusters.Tyrosine phosphorylation is believed to be one of the key steps in signaltransduction and regulation of enzymatic activity.Tyrosine is a precursor for the synthesis of neurotransmitters, and particularlyfor dopamine and norepinephrine. Several studies have shown tyrosine to be ofbenefit for colds, stress, fatigue, loss of a loved one or divorce, prolongedwork hours, and sleep deprivation, with reductions of stress hormone levels,reductions in stress-related weight loss, and improvements in cognitive andphysical performance. However, because tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limitingenzyme, the beneficial effects of tyrosine are less than those of L-Dopa.ValineValine (Val) is an alpha amino acid with the codons GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG.Valine is a branched chain amino acid that was named for the plant valerian. In1901 valine was isolated from casein by Emil Fischer. It functions in thenervous system to support cognitive function, function and maintenance ofmuscle, and the muscle tissue recovery and metabolism post-exercise and forincreasing exercise endurance.In sickle-cell disease, valine can substitute for the hydrophilic amino acidglutamic acid in hemoglobin. Valine is hydrophobic; therefore the hemoglobin ismore likely to aggregate.ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDSEssential fatty acids (EFAs) are fatty acids that all vertebrates (includinghumans) must consume daily because they can not be synthesized and they arerequired for numerous body functions. The term “essential fatty acids” refers tolong-chain fatty acids that are required for normal biological functions,however, the EFA group does not include those fats that are primarily employedas fuel.There are two fatty acids that are classically regarded as essential: alphalinolenic acid (omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid).Some fatty acids are classified as “conditionally essential.” This groupincludes: arachidonic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid), docosahexaenoic acid (anomega-3 fatty acid) and gamma-linolenic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid).In 1923 the two essential fatty acids were identified, but they were originallylisted as “vitamin F.” In 1929 laboratory rat studies indicated that these twofatty acids were more properly classed as fats rather than being listed asvitamins.In the human body the essential fatty acids serve multiple functions, all ofwhich require proper ratios between omega-3 and omega-6 forms. In an articlepublished in the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity, research demonstratedthat supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids to sedentary, obese adults receiveda benefit of lengthening of their DNA telomeres and a reduction in inflammationmarkers.The fatty acids are required for the production and maintenance of eicosanoids,endocannabinoids (affecting mood, behavior, and inflammation), lipoxins (a classof eicosanoid derivatives through the lipoxygenase pathway from omega-6 EFAs),and resolvins from omega-3 (in the presence of aspirin, downregulatinginflammation), the isofurans, neurofurans, isoprostanes, hepoxilins,epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and Neuroprotein D. They form lipid “rafts”that affect cellular signaling, and they act on DNA (activating or inhibitingtranscription factors such as NF-KB, which has been linked to pro-inflammatorycytokine production.Essential fatty acid deficiencies will produce thrombosis (i.e., cerebralstroke, coronary thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis), skindisease (including dry/cracked skin, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, rosaceaacnea, etc.), respiratory disease (including asthma, chonic bronchitis,unremitting cough, etc.), and depression.Omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)are essential for enzymatic pathways required to metabolize long-chainpolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Low plasma concentrations of DHA is a markerfor low cerebral spinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Lowbrain concentrations of 5-HIAA is directly associated with increased rates ofdepression and suicide.MINERALSUnfortunately, Buffon did not know about the 90 essential nutrients (60minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 essential amino acids and 3 essential fatty acids)that are required daily and, in many cases, minute-by-minute by humans. Hisobservations and writings essentially doomed 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st-centuryman to pharmaceuticals and the surgeon’s knife and wiped his scientific andmedical contemporaries’ slates clean from any notion that essential nutrients,minerals, trace minerals, and rare earths are required to attain and fulfillone’s genetic potential for health and longevity.We already know the common denominators of the cultures with the longest livingpeople. They are few, simple, and very clear. Their basic truth for health andlongevity boils down to the routine daily availability of a highly-usable sourceof 90 essential nutrients, of which the most critical are the plant-derivedcolloidal minerals—simple, yes, but it works, and it works and it works! Rawmaterials that are required by biological systems will always trump medicaltechnology of genetically-engineered proteins, stem cells, organ transplants,etc.), when it comes to preventing and reversing birth defects, and degenerativeand chronic disease.The standard farms in the world, both subsistence and giant corporate farms,have veins of minerals coursing through them, similar to the veins of chocolatein chocolate ripple ice cream. Thus one field blessed with a “high mineralcontent” can produce wheat with some mineral content and some wheat with verylittle mineral content or none except for NPK.There are three basic forms of minerals:1. Metallic mineralsMetallic minerals include egg shell, oyster shell, calcium carbonate, limestone, dolomite, clay, mineral salt, sea water, Great Salt Lake water, mineraloxides (from iron oxide, copper oxide, etc.), vortex water, sea-bed minerals,“soils” (which are usually some form of clay), sea-bed clay, clay, “rockflours,” and various antacids such as Rolaids and Tums.Typically metallic minerals are found in tablets and powders as gluconate(calcium gluconate, zinc gluconate, etc.), lactate, sulphates, carbonates, andoxides (iron oxide is rust!!!).Metallic minerals, despite wild claims to the contrary, are only eight percentto twelve percent biologically available to all vertebrates, including humans;after attaining the age of 35 to 40 years the absorptive availability to humansis reduced to somewhere around three to five percent.We know of a man in Grand Rapids, Michigan with a “Porta Potty” business wholiterally finds thousands of multiple vitamin/mineral tablets in the bottomscreens when the “Porta Potty” is pressure cleaned after a public event orretrieval from a construction site. When asked, How do you know that the tabletsare multiple vitamin/mineral tablets?” and he replied, “Because the logos arereadable on the coatings (such as One-A-Day, Theragram M, Centrum, etc.)!! Overthe years he has accumulated a literal mountain of these hard to dissolvetablets!!A typical metallic mineral supplement alone or as part of a multiple is calciumlactate. Calcium lactate can be obtained in 1,000 mg tablets, which breaks downto 140 mg of metallic calcium and 860 mg of milk sugar or lactose. Two 1,000 mgcalcium lactate tablets do not give you 2,000 mg of calcium; they give you only280 mg of metallic calcium, and at an estimated ten percent bioavailabilityrate, you will absorb 28 mg of biologically available calcium; therefore, tomeet your needs, you would have to take 30 tablets with each meal (90 per day)and you would still have to supplement with an additional 59 minerals.Amounts of Metallic Calcium in a 1,000 mg TabletCalciumgluconate...................................................................90mgCalciumcarbonate...................................................................400mgCalciumacetate.......................................................................230mgCalciumcitrate........................................................................210mgCalciumlactate........................................................................140mgCow’s milk per 1,000 mg fluid...............................................10mg2. Chelated mineralsChelated (Key-late) minerals were created by the livestock industry in the 1960sto ensure maximum availability of dietary minerals to animals being fed andfattened for market. The original chelating agent used was calcium EDTA, aman-made amino acid that was invented by the Germans just prior to WW II as anantidote to arsenic and lead exposure in chemical warfare attacks. (Calcium EDTAis used today for intravenous chelation therapy to clean out arterialobstructions.)The term “chelated” literally means “claw,” but is used to describe the processby which an amino acid, protein, or enzyme (enzymes are proteins that do work)is wrapped around the mineral atom, alloy. or molecule that enhances thebioavailability of the metallic mineral.3. Colloidal MineralsColloidal (Kol - oid) chemistry is not new, but it is not widely understood orknown about by the general public. Simply said, a colloid refers to a substancethat exists as ultra-fine particles (angstrom units) that are suspended in amedium of different matter.The colloidal state is the state of a solute (i.e., mineral, paint pigment,homogenized milk fat, etc.) in a solution when its molecules do not separateinto atoms as with a true solution (sodium chloride or salt separates intoseparate sodium and chloride atoms while in a solution), but rather remaingrouped together to form solute particles.The presence of these inorganic colloidal particles, which are approximately onehundred-thousandth to ten-millionth of a centimeter in diameter (about 400thousandths to four millionths of an inch), can often be detected by means of anelectron microscope. As a result of the grouping of the molecules, a solute inthe colloidal state cannot pass through a suitable semipermeable membrane andgives rise to negligible osmotic pressure (they will pass through filter paper),depression of freezing point and elevation of boiling point effects.These ultra-fine particles of the colloid are just barely larger than mostmolecules and so small they can’t be seen with the naked eye. About one billionof these colloid particles would fit into a cubic 0.01 of an inch.The “solutions” part of a colloid provides a solid, gas, or liquid medium inwhich the colloid particles are suspended. The suspended particles in a colloidcan also be a solid, a gas, a lipid, or a liquid.Solutions were classified by H. Freundlich in 1925 into three categories: 1. True solutions 2. Colloidal solutions 3. Emulsions and suspensionsThe four part method of classifying solutions is as follows: 1. Identify particle size 2. Determine presence of Brownian movement (random movement of particles suspended in liquids or gasses resulting from the impact of molecules of the fluid surrounding the particles) 3. Ability to pass through filter paper 4. Level of solubilityIn 1975 S. S. Voyutsky (a Russian) wrote the classic text on colloidalchemistry. Voyutsky referred to solutions as “molecular dispersion systems” and“heterogeneous highly dispersed colloidal systems.”The exact point between the molecular and colloidal degrees of dispersion cannotbe established because the transition from molecularly dispersed systems tocoarsely dispersed systems is a continuous range.A colloidal system must have three basic characteristics: 1. It must be heterogeneous (consists of dissimilar ingredients or constituents). 2. The system must multi-phasic (i.e., solid/liquid, gas/liquid, etc.). 3. The particles must be insoluble (do not dissolve in the solution).Each one of these classifications interacts with the others to give colloidstheir unique qualities. The interesting thing about colloids is that they remainheterogeneous, multi-phasic, and insoluble at different concentrations as longas a larger number, if not all of the particles, are within the range of sizesof colloids (1n to100n).The molecular groups or particles of the colloid solute carry a resultantelectrical charge, generally of the same sign (negative) for all of theparticles. A small percentage of these inorganic colloids will pass through theintestine of a living animal or human because a natural chelating process takesplace in the gut in the presence of protein-containing food.Inorganic colloidal material readily passes through filter paper by placing themixture of mineral colloid and non-colloid in a parchment shell surrounded bydistilled water. The inorganic colloids are “too large” to pass through themembrane, but the molecules of salt, starch, and sugar or any other dissolvedsubstance pass readily through the semipermeable membrane (they separate intoindividual atoms or very small molecules). This kind of separation process iscalled “dialysis.”In the process of digestion the inorganic minerals in food or supplements soonbecome inorganic colloids, and as an inorganic colloid they cannot penetrate theintestinal wall to enter the blood stream. In the presence of amino acids asmall percentage of the inorganic colloids form chelated minerals and organiccolloids that are able to be dialyzed through the mucus membranes of theintestinal walls into the blood stream this form of bioavailable mineral stateis known as a “crystalloid.”Crystalloids or organic colloids readily pass through cell walls, whileinorganic colloids are “too large.” Additionally in the living organism thereare other physiological forces at work, which interfere with or modify theexpected osmotic phenomenon.Colloidal mineral supplements and commercial colloids are found in fourdifferent forms: 1. Unprotected colloids are made of bare “rock flour.” This is the form of inorganic metallic colloid found in seabed minerals, clays, “soils,” and “Glacial Milk.” This form of inorganic colloid is in fact a metallic mineral and is only available to plants when there is a healthy soil population of bacteria and fungi. 2. The second type of mineral colloid is found in the living systems of bacteria, fungi, green plants (food crops), animals and humans and is coated by water-loving (hydrophilic) substances such as gelatin, albumin, albuminoids, or collagen. This coating protects the now “organic mineral colloid” and allows it to be a crystalloid for absorption, storage and physiological uses and thus maximizing its bioavailability to 98%. 3. The third type of organic mineral colloid has a protective coating of carbon with a molecular chain length of 10 to 12 carbon atoms. This type of colloid is also found in bacteria, fungi, plants (including some forms of petrified wood), animals and humans and is thought to be the most stable form of naturally occurring organic mineral colloids. 4. The fourth type of mineral colloid is not to be found in nature, but rather is manufactured industrially by coating the metallic colloid with sulfated castor oil (lipophilic or fat loving) to form commercial detergents.Bee pollen, blue green algae (the Aztecs tried this one and were forced toemploy cannibalism to meet their mineral needs), kelp (the Japanese who consumethe most kelp world-wide only live to be 79.9) and “green drinks” contain someplant derived colloidal minerals. However, the number of minerals found in eachof these sources is highly variable depending on what is and what is not in thesoil or lakes they came from, and lastly, the concentrations of the colloidalminerals are so small that a human would have to eat more than 400 pounds a dayto meet the daily needs of essential minerals.Juicing has been a popular method of obtaining maximum nutrition from freshfruits and vegetables, and in fact there is no better way to get vitamins fromfresh fruits and vegetables than to juice. When one talks about minerals fromjuicing, the level of confidence drops precipitously. Remember, U.S. SenateDocument 264 says, “There are few if any nutritional minerals left in our farmand range soils; therefore, there are few if any nutritional minerals left inour grains, nuts, fruits, or vegetables.” Even when a person juices, they mustsupplement their diets with minerals to include all of the major minerals, traceminerals, and rare earths.“Humic shale” is a unique source of plant derived colloidal minerals. Humicshale originated from plants that grew (according to argon-and carbon-datingsystems) some 75 million years ago, and those lush tropical plants took up the60-plus metallic minerals available to them from a fertile soil that had as manyas 84 minerals. The ancient soil was so rich with minerals that some trees grewas much as 25 feet per year, and the great brontosaurus or “thunder lizard”attained a body weight of 140,000 pounds (70 tons) with a mouth no larger thanthat of a horse. The ability of the brontosaurus to attain such a bulk with sucha small mouth meant the animal was consuming plants that contained concentratedmineral nutrients.A volcanic eruption, combined with global warming and a marine flood, entombedthe mineral rich forests with a 25-foot thick limestone cap—thick enough tocreate an air-tight “vault” and dried or desiccated the plants into a deepaccumulation of “compost” or “hay,” but not deep enough or heavy enough topressurize the dried plant material into coal or oil.The entombed humic shale never fossilized or petrified; in other words, theynever became rocks. They are just compressed, dried, prehistoric “compost” or“hay” that contains large concentrations of plant derived colloidal minerals.Humic shale, as a solid coffee-grounds-like granule or a liquid “tea,” can beused as an organic soil conditioner for organic gardens, farms, and ranches. Itcan supply a rich source of humus and no less than 60 plant-derived colloidalminerals.Humic shale can be ground into a fine compost “flour” and soaked for three tofour weeks in filtered spring water until it reaches a specific gravity of 3.0.It then provides a high-quality organic plant-derived colloidal mineralsupplement that contains 38,000 mg of plant-derived colloidal minerals perliter.It takes 78 pounds of humic shale to produce a concentration of 38,000 mg ofcolloidal minerals per liter; the 78 pounds of humic shale representsapproximately 1034 pounds of lush prehistoric green mineral-rich plants. Thefluid extract of high grade humic shale contains no less than 60 plant derivedcertified organic colloidal minerals and is 98% available for animals andhumans.If humans are to fulfill their genetic potential for health and longevity andflourish they must supplement with all ninety essential nutrients including 60minerals. Anything less, is to tragically throw away twenty-five to fifty yearsof life.The criteria for essentiality of a trace mineral or rare earth are: * Present in all healthy tissues of living organisms. * Concentration in tissue is relatively constant from one species to the next. * Withdrawal from the body induces reproducible physiological and structural abnormalities in several species. * Its replacement reverses (this one is not always true since deficiencies in the embryo during development can result in certain congenital defects or events that cannot be corrected in later life by supplementation) or prevents the disease or abnormality. * The abnormalities of the trace-mineral deficiency always have a biochemical change. * The biochemical changes of the deficiency disease can be prevented or cured when the deficiency is corrected.Essential minerals function at the subcellular level as cofactors for theoptimal operation of genes, DNA, RNA, chromosomes, enzymes, vitamins, andhormones in all organisms, plant and animal, including humans.Essential minerals are also employed by all earthly organisms for structuralbuilding blocks (for stems, roots, leaves, bones, teeth, cartilage, tendons,ligaments, skin, hair, feathers, etc.). The deficiencies of essential mineralswill result in as many as 600 catastrophic diseases; however, the medicalcommunity persists in its pursuit of the genomic map. It is as if the medicalcommunity still believes that the earth is flat, the sun revolves around theearth, and that infectious diseases are caused by “spontaneous generation.”Some 79 functional minerals have been detected in plant, animal, and humantissue (for instance, in blood, liver, muscle, connective tissue, brain, glands,etc.), which satisfies part of the requirements for essentiality. Literallymillions of animal (and human) studies on pregnant, suckling, weanling andmature laboratory mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs, sheep, cattle,chickens, turkeys, ducks, primates, and man have documented additional evidencefor the essentiality of at least 60 minerals.Minerals associated with vertebrate, including humans, physiology (positive andnegative) and disease (deficiency and toxicity) are presented in alphabeticalorder by chemical symbol for convenient access.Ac – André-Louis Debierne, a French chemist, announced the discovery of a newelement, actinium, in 1899. He was able to separate it from the pitchblenderesidues left by Marie and Pierre Curie after they had extracted radium. In 1899Debierne described the new element as similar to titanium and (in 1900) assimilar to thorium.Friedrich Oskar Giesel is credited with the first preparation of radiochemicallypure actinium (which he originally named “emanium”) and with the identificationof its atomic number 89.The name “actinium” originates from the ancient Greek aktis or aktinos, meaning“beam” or “ray.” Ac is highly radioactive, and experiments with it are carriedout in special laboratory settings. When actinium trichloride is administeredintravenously to rats, approximately 33% of Ac is deposited into the bones and50% is deposited in the liver. Its toxicity is comparable to, but lower than,that of americium and plutonium.Actinium originates from igneous rocks and usually found at an extremely lowconcentration of 5.5 x 10 -16 ppm. Actinium is readily absorbed by plant roots;however, very little is transported to the stem, leaves, and shoots of theplant. Actinium accumulates and presumably has metabolic functions in the bonesand liver.Ag – Silver originates from igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks and is found atthe rate of 0.07 ppm in rocks and in soils at the rate of 0.1 ppm; fresh waterat 0.00013 ppm; sea water at 0.0003 ppm; marine algae at 0.25 ppm; terrestrialplants from 0.06 ppm to 1.4 ppm in accumulator plants growing near silver ore.Epiogonum ovalifolium is a silver indicator plant. Sliver is found at 3.0 to11.0 ppm in marine animals; in land mammals generally 0.05 to 0.7 ppm; muscle at0.16 to 0.8 ppm and tortoise shell at 0.05 to 0.7 ppm.Silver has been employed in human health care and in the search for immortalitysince the days of the Chinese alchemist 8,000 years ago. Many feel that silveris in fact an essential element, not because it is required for any knownbiological system, but rather as a systemic disinfectant and immune systemsupport.Silver is an anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal anti-metabolite thatdisables specific enzymes that micro-organisms use for respiration. Silver issuch an efficient anti-bacteriacidal that our great grandmothers put silverdollars in fresh milk to keep it from spoiling at room temperature.Humans can safely consume 400 mg of silver per day. A silver “deficiency”results in an impaired immune system. In the Body Electric Dr. Robert Beckeridentified a relationship between low levels of tissue and dietary silver andthe rate of illness (such as flu, colds, etc.); he stated, “silver deficiencywas responsible for the improper functioning of the immune system, and silverdoes more than just kill disease causing organisms. It also stimulated majorgrowth (another criteria for essentiality) and repair of injured tissue.” Humanfibroblast cells were able to multiply at a great rate, producing large numbersof primitive stem cells in wounds that are able to differentiate into whatevercell types are necessary to heal the wound.According to Science Digest (“Silver: Our Mightiest Germ Fighter.” March, 1978)silver is an antibiotic that can kill over 650 disease causing organisms;resistant strains fail to develop; silver is absolutely non-toxic to humans atstandard rates of consumption.Al – Aluminum is found in igneous rocks at 5,000 ppm, shale at 82,000 ppm,sandstone at 25,000 ppm, limestone at 4,200 ppm, and clay at 71,000 ppm.Aluminum represents 12% of the earth’s crust and 8% of the earth’s solidsurface; In fact, it is the most common metal in the earth’s crust, is the thirdmost common element only behind oxygen and silica, and is found in naturecombined in over 270 mineral alloys. Aluminum is found in high concentrations inall plants grown in the soil, including food crops.Organic Colloidal Aluminum in Common Food CropsFoodAluminum in PPMAsparagus20–200Beans20–250Brussel sprouts20–150Celery20–300Cucumbers20–200Cabbage/lettuce20–200Spinach/mustard greens50–150Melons20–150Peas10–80Peppers50–200Potatoes50–250Turnips/carrots20–300Tomatoes20–200Alfalfa40–300Canola90–150Corn20–300Wheat20–300Soybeans50–200Mint20–300Peanut50–200Sunflower50–100Acid soils yield the highest levels of soil aluminum to plants. It is found inmarine plants at 60 ppm and is especially high in plankton and red algae; landplants at (0.5 to 4,000 ppm) an average of 500 ppm; marine mammals at 19 to 50ppm and is found at the highest levels in the hair and lungs.The known biological function of aluminum is to activate the enzyme succinicdehydrogenase; it increases the survival rate of the newborn, and according toprofessor Gerhard Schrauzer, former head and professor emeritus of thedepartment of chemistry at UCSD, should be listed as an essential mineral forall vertebrates including humans.Aluminum is remarkably nontoxic, aluminum sulfate having an LD50 of 6207 mg/kg(oral/mouse), which would be the equivalent of 500 grams (more than a pound) foran 80 kg human per day.Aluminum can compete with calcium absorption, and increased amounts of dietaryaluminum can result in reduced skeletal mineralization (osteopenia). A smallpercentage of individuals are sensitive to aluminum and had reported contactdermatitis and digestive disorders when they ingest products containingaluminum; however, toxicity studies have shown that aluminum is not toxic tomost people and certainly is not as toxic as heavy metals. Studies have shownthat aluminum cookware, deodorants, and antiperspirants are generally safe atdirected levels. There is no evidence that exposure to aluminum in food orliquid causes any diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease.In a study that appeared November 5, 1992, in the journal Nature, Frank Watt,et. Al. (University of Oxford) employed a highly accurate laboratory techniqueto quantify the levels of aluminum in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Totheir great surprise, they found the same levels of aluminum in the brains ofthe non-Alzheimer’s controls as they did in their Alzheimer’s patients. Watt’sbelieves that the early reports of high aluminum levels in Alzheimer’s brainswas due to contamination by the aluminum trays that were used during thestaining process, but the use of glass trays proved that the level of aluminumwas the same in both groups.According to the Alzheimer’s Society in 2013, the medical and scientific opinionis that studies have not convincingly demonstrated a causal relationship betweenaluminum exposure and Alzheimer’s disease.In the early 1700s, European chemists realized that a light-weight metal wasassociated with clay. A particularly rich aluminum-bearing clay was found in LasBaux, France, giving Bauxite, aluminum-rich clay, its name.Aluminum does not occur as a free metal in nature, but is found only in tightcombination with oxygen forming a hard oxide known as alumina. When contaminatedwith traces of other elements, alumina becomes a gem, such as rubies orsapphires, which in addition to being used as jewelry, these gems have also beenused as medicine for thousands of years in the practice of Ayruvedic medicine.Sir Humphrey Davy, a distinguished English chemist of the 16th century gave thename “aluminum” to the metal of clay.The Danish physicist, Hans Christian Oerstad in 1825 “discovered”electromagnetics, and was the first to purify aluminum by treatingalumina-containing clay with carbon and a chlorine amalgam of potassium to get amixture of volatile mercury and aluminum; he boiled the mercury away as a vaporwhich left a powdery metal that “in color and luster somewhat resembles tin.”Napoleon III, realizing the potential military value of aluminum, personallysponsored aluminum smelting research, and although production costs dropped,aluminum remained a semiprecious metal.Am – All isotopes of Americum are radioactive and have a 7,950 year half life.Americum accumulates in mammalian bone.Ar – Argon is found in igneous rocks at 3.0 to 5.0 ppm and can be used to dateancient rocks using the potassium/argon dating system: fresh water and sea waterat 0.06 ppm and mammalian blood at 0.75 ppm.As – Arsenic was first isolated and identified in 1250 by Albertus Magnus, andis found in igneous rock at 1.0 to 8.0 ppm; shale at 1.0 ppm; fresh water at0.0004 ppm; sea water sat 0.003 ppm; soils at 6.0 ppm (Argentina and New Zealandhave reported toxic levels of soil arsenic in some regions); marine plants at30.0 ppm; land plants at 2.0 ppm; marine animals at 0.005 to 0.3 ppm(accumulated by coelenterates, Mollusca and crustaceans); land animal at lessthan 0.2 ppm (tends to concentrate in hair, claws and nails); and is known to beessential for survivability of the newborn and neonatal growth.Arsenic metabolism is affected by tissue and blood levels of zinc, selenium,arginine, choline, methionine, taurine, and guaniacetic acid, all of whichaffect methyl-group metabolism and polyamine synthesis, which is the site ofarsenic function in human physiology.Arsenic promotes the growth rate of chicks at 90 to 120 ppm. The rate of growthand metamorphosis of tadpoles is enhanced by the presence of arsenic.The word “arsenic” was taken from the Syriac word al zarniqa and the Persianword Zarnikh, which translates to “yellow pigment,” translated into Greek asarsenikos, and which translates into “masculine.” The word was adopted in Latinas arsenicum and Old French as arsenic from which the English word “arsenic” wascoined.During the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds wereused as stimulants and medicines, including arsphenamine (Paul Ehrlich) andarsenic trioxide (Thomas Fowler). Arsphenamine as well as neosalvarsan wasindicated for syphilis and trypanosomiasis. Arsenic trioxide has been used in avariety of ways over the past 500 years, but most commonly for the treatment ofcancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2000 approved this compound forthe treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.In November of 1998, The New England Journal of Medicine reported that arsenicmay prove a life-saver against one type of leukemia. According to researchers atthe Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, it was used in a studythat involved twelve seriously-ill patients suffering from acute promyelocyticleukemia, an often fatal type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrowThe doctors were the first in Western medicine to show that low doses of arsenictrioxide are effective in destroying such cancerous cells. “We now know thatarsenic can safely bring patients with APL into remission, which may ultimatelygive them a second chance at life.” The Chinese reported the same results in1997 in the journal Blood. Survivors in the Chinese studies were stillleukemia-free after ten years.Arsenic is also used as “Fowler’s solution” for psoriasis.Arsenic was first identified in dead human bodies in 1834 by the French Academy.Arsenic typically appears in human female blood at 0.64 ppm, it rises to 0.93ppm during menstruation, and 2.20 ppm during months five and six of pregnancy.Eighteen percent of dietary As was stored in rat liver, whereas only 0.7 percentof shrimp tissue arsenic was stored in rat livers (there is 65 times greatertoxicity potential from metallic arsenic than from organically bound arsenic).Arsenic in combination with choline prevents 100 percent of perosis (“slippedtendon”) in chickens, turkeys, ducks, peafowl, etc. Perosis in birds results ina “carpal tunnel,” “TMJ,” “trigger finger,” and “repetitive motion” typedegenerative disease.Arsenic has been linked to epigenetic changes, the heritable changes in geneexpression that occur without changes in DNA sequence. Arsenic disrupts ATPproduction through many pathways. At the level of the Citric Acid Cycle, arsenicinhibits lipoic acid, which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase. Inaddition, by competing with phosphate, arsenate uncouples oxidativephosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrialrespiration and ATP synthesis.At – All isotopes of Astatine are radioactive; they have an extremely shorthalf-life of 7.2 to 8 hours. It is accumulated by the mammalian and humanthyroid after ingestion but is rapidly excreted.Au – Gold is found in igneous and sedimentary rocks at 0.004 ppm; fresh water at0.00006 ppm; sea water at 0.000011 ppm; marine plants at 0.012 ppm; land plantsat 0.0005 to 0.002 ppm (gold concentrates in the horse tail plant); marineanimals at 0.0003 to 0.008 ppm; land animals 0.00023 and in mammalian livers itwill form a colloid.In medieval times, gold was often seen as beneficial for human health, with thebelief that it was the most noble of substances and would be the “panacea” ormedicine that would treat all disease. The “alchemists,” the earliest ofchemists, spent most of their efforts in trying to transmute lead and other basemetals into gold.Gold leaf, either flake or dust, is used on and in some gourmet foods, notablysweets and drinks, as a decorative ingredient. Gold flake was used by nobilityin medieval Europe as a decoration in food and drinks, in the form of leaf,flakes, or dust, either to demonstrate the host’s wealth or in the belief thatsomething that valuable and rare must be beneficial to one’s health.Danziger Goldwasser (German: Gold water of Danzig) or Goldwasser (Goldwater) isa traditional German herbal liqueur in what is today Gdansk, Poland, andSchwabach, Germany, that contains flakes of gold leaf. There are some $1,000cocktails that contain flakes of gold leaf; however, as elemental gold it isinert to all body chemistry and is not absorbed, is tasteless, provides no knownnutritional value, and leaves the body in the feces unaltered.Gold compounds (gold sodium thiomalate and gold thioglucose that is also knownas aurothioglucose) are frequently given by allopathic physicians as an add-ontherapy with salicylates (aspirin) for arthritis when added pain relief isrequired. Gold has been reported only to be effective against active jointinflammation and is not usually helpful for advanced destructive rheumatoidarthritis.Gold is not an analgesic substance; however it may have anti-inflammatoryeffects. Standard doses are given IM at weekly intervals: 10 mg initially, 25 mgduring second week, and 50 mg per week until a total of one gram has beenadministered. Then the maintenance dose is reduced to 50 mg every two to fourweeks. Relapse is expected three to four months after the cessation of the goldtreatments.Gold compounds are not to be used in patients with liver or kidney disease,blood diseases, or SLE.Toxic reactions to gold therapies include pruritus (itching), dermatitis,stomatitis, GI discomfort, increase in urine albumin, blood in the urine,aplastic anemia, reduced WBC, hepatitis, and pneumonitis.B – Boron is an elemental chemical rather than a metallic mineral. It isproduced by cosmic ray spallation and not by stellar nucleosynthesis. It is alow-abundance element in both the solar system and in the earth’s crust. Boronis concentrated on earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturallyoccurring compounds: the borate minerals. Borate minerals are typically mined asevaporates, including borax, boric acid (sassolite), ulexite, colemanite,boracite, tourmaline, and kernite.The name “boron” is derived from the Arabic word “buraq” or the Persian word“burah,” which are the names for borax. Boron compounds were known thousands ofyears ago and borax was known from the deserts of western Tibet as “tincal” fromthe Sanskrit.Borax glazes were used in China after 300 AD and some tincal even reached theWest, where the Persian alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan refers to it in 700 AD. MarcoPolo brought some tincal glazes from China to Italy in the 13th century.Agricola (1600) reported the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777 boricacid was identified in the hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, andbecame known as “sal sedativum” for medical use. The rare form of borax is foundat Sasso, Italy. Sasso was the primary source of European borax from 1827 to1872, after which American sources replaced it.Even into the 21st century, borax is used in various household laundry andcleaning products, including the iconic “20 Mule Team Borax” laundry booster and“Boraxo” a powdered hand soap, and it is found in several tooth whiteningcompounds.Boric acid has antiseptic, antifungal, and antiviral properties, and mildsolutions of boric acid are used as wound disinfectants and as an eye antisepticwash.Boron is an active ingredient in the first of its kind pharmaceutical asBortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor) used for the treatment of multiple myeloma(bone marrow cancer) and certain lymphomas.Boron is found in igneous rocks at 10 ppm; shale at 100 ppm; sandstones at 35ppm; limestone at 20 ppm; fresh water at 0.013 ppm; sea water at 4.0 to 6.0 ppm;soil at 2.0 to 100 ppm (highest in saline and alkaline soils); in Californiacertain deserts have toxic levels; marine plants 120 ppm (highest in brownalgae); land plants at 50 ppm; Chenopodiaceae and Plumboginaceae are indicatorplant families; marine animals at 20 to 50 ppm; land animals 0.5 ppm.In biology, borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt), butare more toxic to arthropods (insects) and are used as insecticides. Boric acidis mildly antimicrobial. Boron is essential to life for all organisms includingplants and animals.Boron is essential for bone metabolism, including the efficient use of calciumand magnesium and for the proper functioning of the ovaries, testes, and adrenalglands. Prior to 1981, boron was not considered an essential nutrient; boron wasfirst shown to be an essential mineral for growing chicks. It was not until 1990that boron was universally accepted as an essential nutrient for humans.Boron is required for the maintenance of bone and normal blood levels ofestrogen and testosterone; within eight days of supplementing boron, women lost40% less calcium, 33% less magnesium and less phosphorous through their urine.Women getting boron supplementation had blood levels of estradiol 17B doubled to“levels found in women on estrogen replacement therapy,” the levels oftestosterone in both men and women almost doubles!Large deposits of borax or “diamond boron” were discovered in Death Valleyin1881. The Death Valley deposits were made famous by the 20 mule team wagonsthat hauled out the mined borax. The rear wheels were seven foot high, eachwagon was sixteen foot long and could carry 24,000 pounds (12 tons) of borax.Each twenty mule team pulled two wagons plus a 1,200 gallon water wagon for atotal of 36.5 tons in each load!! The total length of each team and equipmentwas 120 feet long. The rail head in Mojave was 165 miles from the Death Valleymine site.Ba – Barium is found in igneous rocks at 425 ppm; shales at 580 ppm; sandstoneat 50 ppm; limestone at 120 ppm; fresh water at 0.054 ppm; sea water at 0.03ppm; soil at 500 ppm (can be “fixed” or tightly bound by clay minerals); marineplants at 30 ppm (highest in brown algae); land plants at 14 ppm (the fruit ofBertholletia excelea is a barium concentrator and can have up to 4,000 ppm);marine animals at 0.2 to 3.0 ppm (highest in hard tissues such as bone andshell); land animals 0.0 to 75 ppm (highest in bone, lung and eyes).Essentiality in mammals was established in 1949 (Rygh, O.: Bull Soc ChemBiol.31:1052 & 1403. 1949).The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are barite (bariumsulfate) and witherite (barium carbonate). Both are insoluble in water. Barium’sname is derived from the alchemy “baryta” which comes from the Greek word barys,which translates as “heavy.” Barium was isolated as an element in 1774; however,it was not classed as a metal until 1808. A barium containing mineral,“benitoite” (barium titanium silicate) occurs as a very rare blue fluorescentgemstone and is the official state gem of California.Barium sulfate has a very low toxicity and relatively high density and has ahigh opacity to X-rays. It is used as a contrast media in X-ray imaging of thedigestive system, such as “barium meals” for upper GI studies and “bariumenemas” for lower GI studies.Be – Beryllium is found in igneous rocks at 2.0 to 8.0 ppm; shale at 3.0 ppm;sandstone and limestone at less than 1.0 ppm; fresh water at 0.001 ppm; seawater at 0.0000006 ppm; soil at 0.1 ppm; marine plants at 0.001 ppm (highest inbrown algae); land plants at less than 0.1 ppm (highest in volcanic soils); landanimals at 0.0003 to 0. 002 ppm in soft tissue.Beryllium is a relatively rare element in the universe and the crust of theearth. It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in alloys with otherelements or minerals. Gemstones that contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarineand emeralds) and chrysoberyl.The mineral beryl, which contains beryllium, has been known at least since thePtolemaic dynasty of Egypt. In the first century CE, Roman naturalist, Pliny theElder, noted in his encyclopedia, Natural History, that beryl and emerald(“smaragdus”) were similar. The Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis, written in the thirdor fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald andberyl.In a 1798 paper read before the Institut de France, Louis-Nicolas Vauquelinreported that he had found a new “rare earth” by dissolving aluminum hydroxidefrom emerald and beryl in an additional alkali. The editors of the journalAnnales de Chimie et de Physique named the new rare earth “glucine” for thesweet taste of some of its compounds.Martin Heinrich Klaproth preferred the name “beryllina” due to the fact thatyttria also formed sweet salts. The term “beryllium” was first used by Wohler in1828. For about 160 years, beryllium was also known as glucinum, or gluciniumwith the chemical symbol of Gl, the naming derived from the Greek word sweet forthe sweet taste of the pure substance.Pure powdered beryllium and its compounds should be handled with care because ofthe potential for acute beryllium disease or chemical pneumonitis, which wasfirst reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. Chronicberylliosis resembles pulmonary sarcoidosis.Bi – Bismuth is found in igneous rocks at 0.17 ppm; shale at 1.0 ppm; sea waterat 0.000017 ppm; land plants at 0.06 ppm; marine animals at 0.09 to 0.3 ppm;land animals at 0.004 ppm. Bismuth chemically resembles arsenic and antimony. Itis a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced. However,after a brief contact with the oxygen in the air it will oxidize into a pinkcolor.Miners in the days of alchemy gave bismuth the name “tectum argenti,” or “silverbeing made,” in the sense of silver still in the process of being formed withinthe earth. Bismuth was also known to the Incas and commonly used along withcopper and tin in a special bronze alloy for knife blades.Bismuth subsalicylate is used as an antidiarrheal; it is the active ingredientin “Pink Bismuth” compounds such as Pepto-Bismol, as well as the 2004reformulation of Kaopectate.A combination of bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth subcitrate, and the antibiotictetracycline has been used in pigs since 1952 to treat gastric ulcers. The sameformula was approved by the FDA in February and in 1994 for curing gastriculcers in humans. Stress has historically been blamed as the boogy-man causingstomach and peptic ulcers of the stomach and duodenum; however, the samebacterium that causes gastric ulcers in pigs (Helicobacter pylori) has beenproven to be the cause of gastric ulcers in humans.Australian gastroenterologist Barry Marshall, M.D. and pathologist J. RobbinWarren proposed their theory for the bacterial cause of gastric ulcers in humansin 1983.Br – Bromine is a “halogen” related to iodine, fluorine, and chlorine. It isfound in igneous rocks at 3.0 to 5.0 ppm; shale at 4.0 ppm; sandstone at 1.0ppm; limestone at 0.2 ppm; fresh water at 0.2 ppm; sea water at 65 ppm; soil at5.0 ppm; marine plants at 740 ppm (highest in brown algae); land plants at 15ppm; marine animals at 60 to 1,000 ppm; land animals at 6.0 ppm.Bromine was discovered independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Lowig (1825)and Antoine Balard (1826). Balard isolated bromine from the ash of seaweedcollected from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to obtainiodine but it also contained bromine. Lowig isolated bromine from a mineralwater spring from his hometown of Bad Kreuznach.Bromine compounds, such as potassium bromide, were used as sedatives in the 19thand 20th centuries. The FDA removed over-the-counter sedatives such asBromo-Seltzer from public sale in 1975.Toxic reactions from an overdose can resemble acne-like skin eruptions.C – Carbon is found in igneous rocks at 200 ppm; shale at 15,300 ppm; sandstoneat 13,800 ppm; limestone at 113,500 ppm; fresh water at 11.0 ppm; sea water at28.0 ppm; soils at 20,000 ppm (up to 90% of the carbon in soil is bound in thehumus); marine plants at 345,000 ppm; land plants at 454,000 ppm; marine animalsat 400,000 ppm; land animals at 465,000 ppm (280,000 ppm in bones).Carbon is derived from the Latin carbo for coal and charcoal (the French word ischarbon). Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity. Carbonfunctions as an essential structural atom for all organic molecules (i.e.,genes, DNA, RNA, chromosomes, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, enzymes,vitamins, etc.) including stored, transported, and functioning organic colloidalminerals.Carbon was identified in prehistory in the form of soot and charcoal. Diamondswere known by the Chinese as early as 2500 BC, and charcoal was commerciallyproduced in the days of the Roman Empire. In 1722 René Réaumur demonstrated thatiron could be made into steel by adding some form of carbon. In 1772 AntoineLavoisier demonstrated that diamonds were in fact an allotrope of carbon when heburned samples of both, showing that no water was produced and that bothreleased the identical amount of carbon dioxide per gram burned.Carbon is the fifteenth most abundant element in the earth’s crust and thefourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium andoxygen.It is present in all known life forms, and in the human body carbon is thesecond most abundant element by mass (18.5%) after oxygen. The abundance,together with the unique diversity of organic compounds and theirpolymer-forming ability at temperatures favorable to life on earth, make carbonthe chemical basis of all known life-forms.Under earthly conditions, conversion of one element to another is rare. Thisincludes carbon, which is found at a constant level. Therefore processes thatemploy carbon must procure from some source and dispose of it by some method.The known paths of carbon circulation in the earth’s environment and biomass areknown as the “carbon cycle.” Plants consume carbon dioxide drawn from theenvironment and use it through photosynthesis to build biomass (i.e., carbonrespiration, etc., or the “Calvin cycle”), a process known as carbon fixation.Plant material biomass is consumed by micro-organisms, animals, and humans withcarbon dioxide being released back into the environment as the result ofmetabolism (fermentation, digestion, metabolism, respiration, etc.Carbohydrates typically act as a basic source of energy for biological processesincluding movement, work, and the basic biochemical functions of life at therate of 4.5 calories per gram. The chief sources of carbohydrates used by humansinclude grains, vegetables, fruits, and sugars. In their simplest form theformula for carbohydrate is CH2O. The hydrogen and oxygen are present in thesame ratio as that found in water (H2O) with one carbon atom for each moleculeof water.Plants are able to manufacture carbohydrates (sugar and starch), amino acids,fatty acids, and vitamins. The plant leaves take in CO2 from the atmosphere andin the presence of chlorophyll (Mg carbon ring structure similar to the Fecarbon ring structure of hemoglobin) and with the energy derived from sunlight(the process known as photosynthesis or solar energy) manufacture carbon chainsincluding carbohydrates and release O2 into the atmosphere as a by-product ofthe reaction.Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides (glucose or “grape sugar,”fructose, etc.), disaccharides (sucrose = glucose and fructose; maltose =glucose and glucose; lactose = glucose and galactose), oligosaccharides andpolysaccharides (starch, dextrin, fiber, cellulose, and glycogen or “animalstarch” which are all complexes of glucose units).Lipids or fats, like carbohydrates, are composed of carbon, hydrogen, andoxygen. Lipids have the common property of being insoluble in water, and areuniversally soluble in organic solvents such as ether and chloroform and areutilizable for a source of energy by all living organisms.Fats as a group of carbon compounds include ordinary fats, oils, waxes andrelated compounds. The primary food sources of fats for humans include butter,seed oil, olive oil, animal fat (from pork, poultry, fish, beef, lamb, etc.),nuts, seeds, whole grains, olives, avocados, egg yolks, dairy products, etc.Fats serve as a source of energy at the rate of 9 calories per gram, both as asource of immediate fuel and stored fuel (body fat).Triglycerides (the primary component of fats and oils) are composed of carbon,hydrogen, and oxygen. Structurally they are esters of a trihydric alcohol(glycerol) and fatty acids. The fatty acids can have from four to 30 carbonatoms and constitute the bulk of the triglyceride mass. One hundred grams of fator oil will contain 95 grams of fatty acids.A fatty acid or hydrocarbon chain is described with regard to threecharacteristics: chain length, degree of “saturation” with hydrogen, and thelocation of the first “double bond.”The length of the chain is a reference to the number of carbon atoms in thechain (e.g., C16 has 16 carbons in the chain). The term “short chain” (less than6 carbons), “medium chain” (7 to 11 carbons) and “long chain” (12 or morecarbons) are used to describe the length of the chains of fatty acids in thestructure of triglycerides.The degree of hydrogen “saturation” in fatty acids is defined by the number ofdouble bonds between carbon atoms in the fatty acid chains. A chain can containall the hydrogen it can hold and have no double bonds, in which case it isreferred to as a saturated fatty acid – lard. It can contain one double bond(monounsaturated fatty acid – coconut oil) or it may contain more than onedouble bond (polyunsaturated fatty acids – olive oil).The location of the first double bond as counted from the “tail” or methyl endof the fatty acid is referred to as the “omega” number (i.e., omega-3, omega-6,omega-9, etc.).Three polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids)are known as the essential fatty acids (EFA). However, because arachidonic acidcan be synthesized from linoleic acid by humans and animal, many nutritionistsdon’t designate arachidonic acid as an EFA.The EFA play essential roles in fat metabolism and fat transport, in maintainingthe function and integrity of cell walls (bi-lipid layer membranes), hormones(i.e., prostaglandins, etc.) and brain structure and physiology (myelin andneurotransmitters, etc.). They are also part of the fatty acids of cholesterolesters and phospholipids in plasma lipoproteins and mitochondrial lipoproteins.Serum cholesterol can be maintained in the normal range (i.e., 220 to 270) bythe consumption of EFA.EFA are also the raw material required by the human to manufactureprostaglandins that regulate blood pressure, heart rate, vascular dilation,blood clotting, bronchial dilation (prevents and reverses asthma), andneurotransmitters of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).EFA deficiency in human infants will result in poor growth rate, eczema,dermatitis, psoriasis, rosacea, asthma, thrombotic stroke, and a loweredresistance to infectious disease.Cholesterol is a member of a large group of fats known as sterols. They all havea complex carbon ring structure. Cholesterol is only found in animal tissue,however, similar sterols are found in plants. Cholesterol is an essential partof the structure of cell walls, brain and spinal cord (myelin), and is the rawmaterial for the human body to manufacture vitamin D, bile acids, steroidhormones (for instance, adrenocortical hormones, testosterone, estrogen, andprogesterone).A cholesterol deficiency produces Alzheimer’s disease, makes menopause a livinghell and results in “low-T” and “ED” in males. In February 28, 2012, the FDAadded new safety warnings regarding the increased risk of statin drugs used tolower blood cholesterol that results in increased rate of memory loss(Alzheimer’s disease) and increased blood sugar (diabetes).In Science News, June 16, 2012, an article that had been published in Lancet,was featured that reported, “Good cholesterol is not so beneficial and higherHDL (good cholesterol) levels don’t reduce heart attacks.” The article indicatesthat “good” cholesterol (HDL) itself doesn’t protect the heart itself; rather itis an indicator or barometer of some other negative event (meaning that moregood cholesterol and less bad cholesterol, that is the LDL, are indicators ofless vascular inflammation and less exposure to free radicals).Ergosterol, a yeast sterol, is converted to vitamin D2 on exposure to sunlightor ultraviolet light. Beta-sitosterol, another plant sterol, is usually absorbedin small amounts, however, high levels of consumption or supplementation willactually raise blood cholesterol levels into the normal range.Proteins are the fundamental structural components of the living cell(cytoplasm), they are essential parts of the cell nucleus and protoplasm.Proteins are the most abundant of all of the carbon containing organic compoundsin the human body. The greatest mass of body protein is found in the skeletalmuscle, the remainder is found in other organs (liver, kidney, stomach, etc.),bones, teeth, blood and other body fluids (lymph). Hormones, enzymes, DNA andRNA, chromosomes and genes are proteins that do work.Proteins like carbohydrates and fats contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, andin addition they also contain 16% nitrogen (the amine group), sometimes alongwith sulfur and other elements such as phosphorous, iron, sulfur, and cobalt.The basic structural unit of a protein is the amino acid. They are united by“peptide bonds” into long chains of various geometric structures to formspecific proteins. Digestion of proteins breaks the peptide bonds resulting infragments of the protein chain (poly peptides) or complete digestion to releasethe individual amino acids. Use of protein for an energy source produces 4.5calories per gram.Classically there are nine essential amino acids that are required in the dailydiet as they can’t be manufactured by the human body. Forty-three percent ofprotein for infants must be the essential amino acids, 36% is essential for thegrowing child, and only 19% essential amino acids are required for adultmaintenance. To this list of the nine classic essential amino acids we would addthree additional essential amino acids as over the long haul they preventcertain diseases from cancer and high blood pressure (arginine), maculardegeneration (taurine), to goiter (tyrosine).Essential Amino AcidsValineLysineThreonineLeucineIsoleucineTryptophanPhenylalanineMethionineHistidineArginine* [part0031.html#ch1]Taurine* [part0031.html#ch1]Tyrosine* [part0031.html#ch1]*These amino acids are not considered a classic essential amino acid; however,their deficiencies do result in specific deficiency diseases.An individual consuming protein at 300 grams per day (almost ¾ pound of meat perday) will not have any adverse effects if they supplement properly and do nothave liver disease or kidney disease."},{"pageContent":"FATTY ACIDSEssential fatty acids include the linoleic, linolenic and arachadonic fattyacids, which are further divided into the Omega-3 (DHA and EPA), Omega-6,Omega-9, and cholesterol.In 1971 Wallach published a paper that compared the coronary artery disease ofseveral species of vegetarians with the coronary artery disease of severalspecies of carnivores. The study was part of the NIH/Center for the Biology ofNatural Systems project. It reported that vegans and vegetarians actually hadcoronary artery disease equal to or greater than that of carnivores by actualvisualization at autopsy.George Rene Francis, a black man, was born June 6, 1896, in New Orleans and diedat age 112 years and 204 days as the oldest man in America December 20, 2008.Francis lived through nineteen U.S. presidents (who were cared for medically bydoctors whose average age at death is fifty six—exactly half Francis’ age!).Francis was rejected by the U.S. Army during WWII because he was too small tocarry a 50-pound pack; he smoked cigars until he was 75 and slept less than sixhours per night.The important part of Francis’s story is that “he broke all the rules of healthyeating with a diet heavy on dairy and eggs and lard sandwiches.” His diet washeavy with cholesterol and saturated fat and he became the oldest man inAmerica, a feat that has never been achieved by a nutritionist or physician whohas graduated from Harvard and was anti-saturated fat and anti-cholesterol.For at least the first fifty-three years of Francis’s life he put wood ashes(plant minerals) into his garden. Two weeks before his death, Francis developedpneumonia. He was taken to a Sacramento, California hospital where he died of“congestive heart failure (aka beriberi: a simple nutritional deficiency of asingle vitamin!).”Ca – Calcium is found in igneous rocks at 41,500 ppm; shale at 22,100 ppm;sandstone at 39,100 ppm; limestone at 302,000 ppm; fresh water at 15 ppm; seawater at 400 ppm; soils at 7,000 to 500,000 ppm (lowest levels in acid soils andhighest in lime stone or alkaline soils); marine plants at 10,000 to 300,000 ppm(highest in calcareous tissues red, blue-green and green algae and diatoms; landplants at 18,000 ppm; marine animals at 1,500 to 20,000 ppm (up to 350,000 incalcareous tissues: sponges, coral, molluscs, echinoderms, etc.); land animalsat 200 to 85,000 ppm (260,000 ppm in mammalian bone, 200 to 500 ppm in softtissue and less than 5.0 in RBC). Calcium was not isolated as a pure metal until1808 by Sir Humphrey Davy in England.Calcium, combined with phosphate forms hydroxyapatite, which is the mineralportion of animal and human bones and teeth; the mineral content of some coralsare made up of hydroxyapatite.The functions of calcium include part of the structural component of cell wallsof plants, all calcareous tissues in humans and all other animal species,cofactor in biological electrochemical reactions; functions in cells and enzymesas a reaction facilitating cofactor (i.e., in blood clotting, etc.).Calcium is the fifth most abundant mineral in the crust of the earth and thebiosphere and is essential to all earth dwelling life forms. There is evidencethat clearly shows humans are designed to consume and use high-calcium diets.The late Paleolithic Period of 35,000 to 10,000 years ago was the most recenttime that our human ancestors lived in the bios for which they had beenbiochemically designed. The agricultural revolution occurred 10,000 years ago,and it reduced the wide variety of wild foods in the human food chain andincreased the supply of food energy. These changes in food sources universallyand forever decreased man’s dietary intake of minerals, trace minerals, and rareearths.The uncultivated food plants and wild game commonly available to Stone Agehumans would supply 1,600 mg of calcium at the basal energy intakes and between2,000 and 3,000 mg of calcium at the energy levels required for hunting andwork.Lime as a building material has been used since prehistoric times, going as farback as 14000 BC. The first lime kiln dating back to 2500 BC was from Khafajah,Mesopotamia. Notes were found dated back to 975 AD, that describes the use of“plaster of Paris” (calcium sulfate) was used for casts to set bone fractures.Approximately 99% of the total human body calcium is found in the bones andteeth. The remainder of the body’s calcium reserve is employed for exocytosis,especially for neurotransmitter release and muscle contraction. In theelectrical conduction system of the heart, calcium replaces sodium as themineral that depolarizes the cell, proliferating the action potential. Incardiac muscle, sodium influx commences an action potential, but duringpotassium efflux, the cardiac myocyte experiences calcium influx, prolonging theaction potential and creating a plateau phase of dynamic equilibrium.Historically high-calcium intakes were believed by medical doctors to causekidney stones; however, it has been reported in the 20th century (by Wallach)that a high intake of dietary calcium in fact reduces the risk of nutritionalsecondary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, and kidney stones.During the 20th century, American adults have an average calcium intake of onlyone fifth to one third as much as did Stone Age humans. The National Health andNutrition Examination Survey II reported a median calcium intake for Americanwomen of between 300 and 508 mg per day and only 680 mg per day for Americanmen.Other nutrients in the American diet aggravate the national calcium deficiencyproblem. Un-supplemented diets that are rich in salt and protein (phosphates)result in an increased calcium “cost,” that, in effect, increase therequirements for calcium. When food is heavily salted, urinary calcium increasesfrom 96 mg per day to 148 mg per day. As protein (phosphate) intake is doubled,the output in urinary calcium increased by 50%.There are no less than 147 different deficiency-diseases that are directlyattributed to a calcium deficiency or imbalance. The most recent clinicalresearch clearly points out that the entire scope of American diets arecritically deficient in calcium and that the only practical way to assuresufficient calcium intake is to supplement. Again, the allopaths who did thestudy failed miserably by recommending that each adult in American eat five cupsof broccoli each day as a valuable source of calcium. Try to get a kid, a U.S.president, or an MD to eat that much broccoli. (And there is no guarantee howmuch calcium there is in the broccoli!)Common Calcium-Deficiency DiseasesDiseaseComplicating factorsOsteoporosis (kyphosis, scoliosis, Dowagers Hump, lordosis, Legg-Perthe’s,spontaneous fractures)Deficiencies of: Mg, B, Cu, S, Se, St, Ac, Fl; Excess Fl, P, Cd, dietary lipids& NaClReceding gums (osteoporosis of face & jaw)Same as osteoporosisOsteomalacia (failure to mineralize the matrix)Same as osteoporosisMyelosclerosis (bone marrow dysplasia, Osteofibrosis, etc.)Same as osteoporosisArthritis (degenerative, osteo, bone on bone)Same as osteoporosisSpondylitis (ankylosing spondylitis)Same as osteoporosisBone spurs (tendon & ligament attachments)Same as osteoporosisKidney stones (cystic calculi)Same as osteoporosisNSH (nutritional hyperparathyroidism)Same as osteoporosisHypertension (high blood pressure)Same as osteoporosisInsomnia (sleep apnea, snoring, etc.)Same as osteoporosisCalcium deposits (vascular, tendons, ligaments, restless leg,atrial-fibrillation, etc.)Same as osteoporosisCramps & twitches (Tourette’s syndrome, foot, calf, hamstring, eyelids, etc.)Same as osteoporosisPMS (emotional & physical symptoms)Same as osteoporosisLow back (sciatica, spasm, disc, etc.)Same as osteoporosisNeuropathy (Bell’s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia, sciatica, restless leg, etc.)Same as osteoporosisTetany (total body “cramp” or convulsion, NSH, etc.)Same as osteoporosisPanic attack (hyperirritability)Same as osteoporosisThe more common calcium-deficiency diseases are easy to recognize and range frompoor clotting time of the blood when people nick themselves shaving (calcium isa cofactor for the blood clotting mechanism), osteoporosis (that allopaths thinkof as a disease of aging), arthritis (for which allopaths prescribe pain killersand surgery), to kidney stones (which allopaths say is too much calcium).Famous people who have suffered unnecessarily from calcium deficiency includePresident (41) George Bush (he “required” hip replacement surgery), Pope JohnPaul II (suffered a fractured hip/osteoporosis), Elizabeth Taylor (hadosteoporosis/hip replacement surgery), “Bo” Jackson (had fracturedhip/osteoporosis), Bill Walton, a vegan of professional basketball fame (hadknee, foot, and bone spur problems) and Ted Williams, Baseball Hall of Fame,(had osteoporosis/arthritis), etc.Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body. The average male has1,200 grams (approximately 3 pounds) and the average female has 1,000 grams(approximately 2 pounds), which makes up about two percent of the human bodyweight (water makes up 65 to 75%) and up to 39 percent of the total mineralreserves of the human body (ash). Ninety-nine percent of the total body calciumis found in the bones and teeth, and the remaining one percent is found in theblood, extracellular fluid, and within cells where it is a cofactor andactivator for numerous chemical, DNA, and enzymatic reactions.The calcium in bones is in the form of hydroxyapatite salts composed of calciumphosphate and calcium carbonate in a classic crystal structure bound to aprotein framework (put a chicken “drumstick” bone into a quart of vinegar atroom temperature for 30 days and the calcium will be leached out of the bone,leaving a collagen matrix). Similar types of hydroxyapatite are found in theenamel and dentine of teeth; however, little is available from teeth tocontribute to rapidly available calcium to supply and maintain proper bloodlevels.In addition to being a major structural mineral, Ca is also required for therelease of energy from ATP for muscular contraction, blood clotting (ionized Castimulates the release of thromboplastin from the platelets, convertsprothrombin to thrombin, and thrombin facilitates the conversion of fibrinogento fibrin. Fibrin creates the protein “web” that traps the RBCs to form bloodclots); Ca mediates the transport function of cell and organelle membranes; Caeffects the release of neurotransmitters at synaptic junctions; Ca mediates thesynthesis, secretion and metabolic effects of hormones and enzymes; Ca helps toregulate the heartbeat, muscle tone and muscle receptiveness to nervestimulation and communication.Calcium is absorbed primarily through the duodenum, where the intestinalenvironment is still acid. Once the food in the intestine becomes alkaline, theabsorption of Ca drops significantly. Calcium is absorbed from the smallintestine by active cellular transport and by simple diffusion. Metallic calciumabsorption may be limited to 10 percent or less and is affected by manysubstances in the gut. Calcium is absorbed more efficiently in its plant derivedcolloidal form and water soluble chelates.Lack of vitamin D and stomach acid (hypochlorhydria which is produced by a NaCldeficiency) will both produce a Ca deficiency. Lactose intolerance, celiacdisease, gluten intolerance, a high-fat diet and a low protein intake, and ahigh phytate consumption (phytic acid is a phosphorus containing acid compoundfound in raw vegetables, nuts, bran of grains and seeds as well as the stems ofmany plants, especially oatmeal and whole wheat that combine with Ca to formcalcium phytate which is insoluble and thus unavailable to humans) all result ina Ca deficiency. Oxalic acid in rhubarb, spinach, chard, and greens combine withCa to form an insoluble calcium oxalate which is not absorbed; fiber itself,besides the phytate content, prevents Ca absorption; an alkaline intestine, guthypermobility, pharmaceuticals (anti-seizure drugs, diuretics, etc.) result in adecreased efficiency of absorption and retention; excess of consumption ofcaffeine will leach Ca from bone reserves.Parathormone secreted by the parathyroid gland and calcitonin secreted by thethyroid gland maintain a serum Ca level of 8.5 to 10.5 by increasing absorptionof Ca and by drawing on Ca reserves from the bones. Parathormone also affectsthe kidney so that it encourages the conservation of Ca. When the blood levelsof Ca begins to rise above normal levels because of too much parathormoneactivity, calcitonin reduces the supply of Ca from the bone reserves.In 1980 McCarron et. al. theorized that chronic Ca deficiency led tohypertension. More than 30 subsequent studies supported the original theory ofCa deficiency as the cause of hypertension. Additionally, recent studies haveshown, that serum ionized Ca is consistently lower in humans with untreatedhypertension. In a recent review article, Sowers, et. al. noted that theassociation of Ca intake and blood pressure is most clear in people with dailyCa intakes of less than 500 mg a day.The phenomenon of salt sensitivity consists of a rise in blood pressure andsustained increase in urinary loss of Ca in response to salt consumption. Amongblack and elderly whites with essential hypertension, restricted intakes of Caand K, rather than elevated salt consumption itself, is responsible for the“salt sensitivity.” In a four-year study of 58,218 nurses, hypertension was morelikely to develop in females who took in less than 800 mg of Ca per day.In a 19-year observational study of 1,954 men, 49 cases of colorectal cancerwere identified. Analysis of the results showed very clearly that the incidenceof colorectal cancer increased 300% as the Ca intake decreased from160mg/100kcal to 24.9 mg/100kcal of diet.Up to 75% of consumed Ca is lost in the feces, two percent is lost in the urineand sweat (15 mg per day is lost in normal sweating. This can double or triplein active athletes); in cases of excess urine loss of calcium (osteoporosis,NSH, excess dietary P, etc.) it will produce kidney stones, bone spurs, andcalcium deposits.Bone spurs, heel spurs, and calcium deposits always develop at the sites ofinsertions of tendons and ligaments during a raging osteoporosis. Bone spurs,heel spurs, and calcium deposits can be reversed and eliminated by supplementingwith significant amounts of chelated and colloidal calcium sources.Not only are farm soils and food sources deficient in calcium; additionally thetypical human diet is rich in P, which is found in just about every culturaldiet, fertilizer and food additives.Ideally, the Ca:P ratio in the diets of all vertebrates including humans shouldbe 2:1; however, this ideal ratio is not found naturally in the human dietwithout proper supplementation and avoidance of high P junk food (such as softdrinks, etc.).Cd – Cadmium is found in igneous rocks at 0.2 ppm; shale at 0.3; sandstone at0.05 ppm; limestone at 0.035 ppm; fresh water at 0.08 ppm; sea water at 0.00011ppm; soils at 0.06 ppm; marine plants at 0.4 ppm; land plants at 0.6 ppm; marineanimals at 0.15 to 3.0 ppm; land animals at 0.5 ppm (can accumulate in thekidney).Cadmium was isolated in 1817 by Friedrich Strohmeyer. The name “cadmium” comesfrom the Latin word cadmia, which translates to “calamine” or zinc carbonate. In1907 the British Pharmaceutical Codex listed cadmium iodide as a therapy forenlarged joints, scrofulous glands (tuberculosis), and chilblains.Cadmium is a soft, bluish-white metal that can easily be cut with a knife; it issimilar in many respects to zinc, and it will produce a characteristic “scream”when a cadmium bar is bent.Functions of cadmium include stimulating the hatching of nematode (worm) cysts.Cadmium-bound proteins have been isolated from molluscs and horse kidney.Cadmium can substitute for zinc in zinc deficiency states by its ability toactivate some zinc dependent enzymes (that is, cadmium-dependent carbonicanhydrase in marine diatoms).Ce – Cerium, a “Rare Earth” element, is found in igneous rocks at 60 ppm; shaleat 59 ppm; sandstone sat 92 ppm; limestone at 12 ppm; sea water at 0.0004 ppm;soil at 50 ppm; in land plants it can accumulate up to 320 ppm by Corya spp.;land animals at 0.003 ppm (accumulates in bone).Cerium was named for the dwarf planet Ceres (which was named after the Romangoddess of agriculture). Cerium is the most abundant form of the rare earthelements. Cerium was discovered in Bastnas in Sweden by Jons Jakob Berzelius andWihelm Hisinger and also in Germany by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1803.Cerium can function in a similar fashion to calcium an all organisms, so it isdeposited in bones and has been shown to stimulate metabolism. Cerium can becommonly found in tobacco plants, barley, and in the wood of beech trees. Ceriumnitrate is used as a topical disinfectant for severe burn victims.Cl – Chlorine is found in igneous rock at 130 ppm; shale at 180 ppm; sandstoneat 10 ppm; limestone at 150 ppm; fresh water 7 to 8 ppm; sea water at 19,000ppm; soil at 100 ppm (higher in alkaline soils, near the sea and in deserts – amajor exchangeable anion in many soils); marine plants at 4,700 ppm; land plantsat 2,000 ppm; marine animals at 5,000 to 90,000 ppm (highest in softcoelenterates); land animals at 2,800 ppm (highest in mammalian hair and skin).The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride (salt), has been knownsince ancient times; archaeologists have discovered evidence that rock salt wasused as early as 3000 BC and as a brine since 6000 BC In 1630, chlorine wasidentified as a gas by the Belgian chemist and physician Jan Baptist VanHelmont. In 1774 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele isolated elementalchlorine.In 1810 Sir Humphry Davy concluded that chlorine is an element not a compound,and he named the new element chlorine from the Greek word chloros or“green–yellow.” In 1811 the term “halogen” or “salt producer” was introduced byJohann Salomo Christoph Schweigger to describe chlorine; however, it laterbecame a generic term for all elements found in the chlorine halogin family(including fluorine, bromine, and iodine).In France there was a need for animal intestines to produce the strings formusical instruments, Goldbeater’s skin, etc. These processes were performed in“gut factories” (boyauderies), which were by their very nature smelly anddangerous because of the quantities of “germs” in the animal intestines.In 1820 the Societe d’encouragement pour l’industrie nationale offered a rewardfor the development of an industrial process, chemical or mechanical, toseparate the peritoneal membrane from animal intestines and at the same timeprevent putrefaction. The prize was awarded to Antoine-Germain Labarraque, a 44year old French chemist and pharmacist who had discovered that chlorinatedbleaching solutions (“Eau de Javel”) would prevent and eliminate the odor ofputrefaction and prevent decomposition itself.Labarraque’s research produced chlorides and hypochlorites of lime (calciumhypochlorite) and of sodium (sodium hypochlorite) that were used, not only inthe boyauderies, but also for the daily disinfection and deodorizing oflatrines, sewers, markets, slaughter houses, anatomy laboratories, and morgues.These chloride products were also employed in hospitals, lazarets, prisons,infirmaries on land and at sea, zoological parks, stables, barns, exhumations ofhuman bodies, embalming, disinfection during epidemics, fever, black leg incattle, and so forth.Labarraque’s chlorinated lime and soda solutions were recommended in 1828 toprevent infections (“contagious infections” transmitted by “miasmas”) and totreat putrefaction of existing septic wounds. In his 1828 work, Labarraquerecommended that doctors breathe chlorine, wash their hands with chlorinatedlime, and sprinkle chlorinated lime on the patient’s bed in cases of “contagiousinfection.” In 1828 it was universally accepted that some infections were“contagious” even though the germs had not yet been identified.During the 1832 cholera outbreak in Paris, large volumes of chloride of limewere used to disinfect the capital. Labarraque’s methods helped to eliminate thesmell of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms—effectively deodorizing theLatin Quarter of Paris.In 1854 a cholera outbreak occurred in London and was traced to contaminatedwater being drawn from the Broad Street pump. The epidemic was stemmed by thesprinkling of chloride of lime in the streets surrounding the pump.The most well-known application of Labarraque’s chlorine solution was in 1847,when Ignaz Semmelweis used chlorine water to “deodorize” the hands of Austriandoctors, which Semmelweis noticed still carried the stench of decomposition fromthe autopsy room to the delivery room.Semmelweis, long before the germ theory, had theorized that “cadavericparticles” were somehow transmitting decay from dead bodies to live patients,and that soap and water alone failed to solve the problem, so he employed thefamous Labarraque’s solution as the only known method to remove the smell ofdecay and decomposition from the hands of doctors. His choice of the chloridesolutions as a hand disinfectant for doctors brought to an end to thetransmission of childbed fever (“puerperal fever”) from doctors to patients inthe maternity wards of theVienna General Hospital in Austria in 1847. For hisefforts, Semmelweis was forcibly committed to an insane asylum by his fellowdoctors, and shortly thereafter was found dead from blunt trauma to the head.His medical colleagues claimed that he committed suicide.By 1918 the U.S. department of the Treasury decreed that all publicdrinking-water systems must be disinfected by the use of chlorine. Chlorine inwater is more than three times as effective as a disinfectant againstEscherichia coli, than an equivalent concentration of bromine, and is more thansix times more effective than an equivalent concentration of iodine.Essential for all living organisms and electrochemical and catalytic functions,activates numerous enzymes and is the basic raw material for the gastric “chief”cells to manufacture HCl for stomach acidity to keep the stomach sterile,increase the digestive capacity of pepsin (the protein digesting enzyme), andincrease the absorption of minerals and B12 (intrinsic factor). Salt (sodiumchloride) is the universal source of chloride ions.Cm – Curium is found in igneous rocks at 0.0001 ppm; all isotopes areradioactive with a 2.5 x 108 years half-life. It exists in some molybdenites,and this radioactive mineral accumulates in mammalian bone.Curium was first synthesized, isolated, and identified by Glenn T. Seaborg,Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso in 1944 at the University of California,Berkeley. The new element was named after Marie Sklodowska-Curie and her husbandPierre Curie for their discovery of radium and their pioneering studies inradiation.Co – Cobalt is found in igneous rocks at about 25 ppm; shale at19 ppm; sandstoneat 0.3 ppm; limestone at 0.1 ppm; fresh water at 0.0009 ppm; sea water at0.00027 ppm; soils at 8 ppm (highest in soils derived from basalt orserpentine). Vast areas of the earth’s surface are known to be absolutely devoidof cobalt.Marine plants contain cobalt at 0.7 ppm; land plants at 0.5 ppm (accumulatorplants include Nyssa sylvatica and Clethra spp,).Marine animals contain cobalt at 0.5 to 5.0 ppm; land animals at 0.03 ppm withthe greatest concentrations found in the bone and liver.Cobalt-based blue pigment (cobalt blue) has been used since ancient times forjewelry and paints and to give a blue tint to glass. Miners had given cobalt thename Kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigmented minerals.They were named “goblin ore” because they contained very little of the knownmetals, and when they were smelted they gave off poisonous arsenic-containingfumes. In 1735 goblin ore was reducible to a new metal (the first such discoverysince ancient times) and it was named Kobold. In modern times the main source ofcobalt is as a byproduct of copper and nickel mining.Cobalt is essential for blue-green algae, some bacteria and fungi, some plants,insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals including man. Cobalt is theactive center of coenzymes called cobalamins, they function as a cofactor andactivator for enzymes, fixes nitrogen during amino acid production; a singlecobalt atom is the central metal component of vitamin B12, which itself is acofactor and activator (cobamide coenzymes) for several essential enzymes.B12 cobalt is chelated in a large tetrapyrrole ring similar to the porphorynring found in hemoglobin and chlorophyll. The original B12 molecule isolated inthe laboratory contained a cyanide group; thus the name cyanocobalamine; thereare several different cobalamine compounds that have vitamin B12 activity, withcyanocobalamine and hydroxycobalamine the most active.Vitamine B12 is a red crystalline substance that is water soluble; the red coloris due to the cobalt in the molecule. Vitamin B12 is slowly deactivated by acid,alkali, light, and oxidizing or reducing substances; about 30 percent of B12activity is lost during cooking (by electric, wood, gas, or microwave).In 1948, B12 was isolated from liver extract and it clearly demonstrated ananti-pernicious anemia activity.The essentiality of cobalt is unusual in that the requirement is for a cobaltcomplex known as cyanocobalamine or vitamin B12. A pure cobalt requirement isonly found in certain bacteria and algae, and the need for B12 cobalt is thoughtby some to represent a symbiotic relationship between microbes, which generateand manufacture B12 from elemental cobalt, and vertebrates that require B12.Rumenants (i.e., cows, sheep, goats, deer, antelope, bison, giraffe, etc.) canuse elemental cobalt as a raw material to manufacture B12. However, the microbesfermenting and digesting plant material in their first stomach (rumen) convertelemental cobalt into vitamin B12 which the animal can use.Carnivores can get their B12 from the rumenant by consuming stomach contents,liver, bone, and muscle from their kills.Poultry, lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), and rodents actively eat feces duringthe night (coprophagy) and in the process obtain B12 that is manufactured byintestinal microorganisms.Metallic cobalt, itself, is absorbed at the rate of 20 to 26.2 percent in miceand humans if intrinsic factor is present in the stomach and the gastric ph is2.0 or less. Intrinsic factor is a mucoprotein enzyme known as Castle’sIntrinsic Factor and is part of normal gastric secretions.If a person has hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid—usually a NaCl deficiency) theintrinsic factor will not work, and B12 cobalt is not absorbed. This is whydoctors frequently give B12 shots to older people on salt-restricted diets.Sublingual (under the tongue) and oral spray B12 is available; plant derivedcobalt is very bioavailable, however, because of low salt diets and cobaltdepleted soils, vegetarians will frequently acquire a B12 deficiency.The B12 Intrinsic Factor complex is primarily absorbed in the terminal smallintestine or ileum; calcium is required for the B12 to cross from the intestineinto the bloodstream as well as an active participation by intestinal cells.Simple diffusion can account for one to three percent of the B12 absorption.There is an enterohepatic (intestine direct to the liver) circulation of B12that recycles B12 through bile and other intestinal secretions, which explainswhy B12 deficiency may not appear in un-supplemented vegans for five to tenyears.The maximum storage level of B12 is 2 mg, which is slowly released to the bonemarrow as needed. Excess intake of B12 is shed in the urine.Vitamin B12/cobalt joins with folic acid, choline, and the amino acid methionineto transfer single carbon groups (methyl groups) in the synthesis of the rawmaterials to make RNA and synthesis of DNA from RNA (directly involved in genefunction—remember preconception nutrition is necessary to prevent birthdefects!). Growth, myelin formation (converts cholesterol into the insulatingmaterial myelin found surrounding the nerve fibers in the brain and large nervetrunks), and RBC synthesis, are dependent on adequate dietary levels ofcholesterol and B12.The discovery of the essentiality of cobalt came from veterinarians observing afatal disease called “bush sickness” in cattle and sheep from Australia and NewZealand. It was observed that “bush sickness” could be successfully treated andprevented by cobalt supplementation.Bush sickness in livestock was characterized by emaciation (un-supplementedvegans), dull stare, a listless, starved look, pale mucus membranes, anorexia(loss of appetite), anemia (microcytic/hypochromic), and general un-thriftiness.In humans, a failure to absorb B12/cobalt results from a surgical removal ofparts of the stomach (eliminates areas of Intrinsic Factor production), orsurgical removal of the ileum portion of the small bowel, a small intestinaldiverticula, parasites (tapeworm), celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and othermalabsorption diseases. Pernicious anemia and demyelination of the spinal cordand large nerve trunks are classics for B12/cobalt deficiency.Less than 0.07 ppm Co in the soil results in cobalt deficiency in animals andpeople who eat crops grown from those soils; 0.11 ppm Co in the soil preventsand cures Co deficiency.The RDA for B12/cobalt is 3 to 4 mcg per day, we prefer “expensive urine” andlike 250 to 400 mcg per day, especially while preparing for a pregnancy andnursing (remember: a baby being nursed by a nutritionally-deficient mother hastheir deficiency extended over a long period of time and may result in seriouspermanent nerve damage.Cobalt excess in man (20 to 30 mg/day) may create erythropoiesis (excessive RBCproduction) with increased production of the hormone erythropoietin from thekidney. Cobalt is also a necessary cofactor for the production of thyroidhormone.Cr – Chromium is found in igneous rock at 100 ppm; shale at 90 ppm; sandstone at35 ppm and limestone at 11 ppm; fresh water at 0.00018 ppm; sea water at 0.00005ppm; soils at 5.0 to 3,000 ppm (highest in soils derived from basalt andserpentine); marine plants at 1 ppm; land plants at 0.23 ppm; marine animals 0.2– 1.0 ppm; land animals 0.075 ppm; and it is accumulated by RNA and insulin.Chromium oxide was employed by the Chinese in the Qin dynasty over 2,000 yearsago in the late 3rd century BC to coat the metal weapons found in Xi’an with theTerracotta Army. The ancient bronze tips of crossbow bolts and swords found atthe site had very little oxidation or corrosion because the bronze wasdeliberately coated with a thin layer of chromium oxide.Chromium activates phosphoglucosonetase and other enzymes and is tightlyassociated with GTF (glucose tolerance factor, a combination of chromium III,dinicotinic acid and glutathione). The reported plasma levels of chromium inhumans over the past 20 years has ranged from 0.075 to 13 ng/ml. Concentrationsof chromium in human hair is ten times greater than in blood, making hairanalysis a much more accurate view of chromium stores and function in the human(there is an average of 1.5 mg in the human body under optimal conditions).Very little inorganic chromium is stored in the human body; once inorganicchromium is absorbed, it is almost entirely excreted in the urine (thereforeurine chromium levels can be used to estimate dietary chromium status). Dietarysugar loads (such as colas, apple juice, grape juice, honey, candy, table sugar,fructose, etc.) increase the natural rate of urinary Cr loss by 300% for 12hours.The average human daily intake of 50 to 100 ug of inorganic Cr from foodsupplies only 0.25 to 0.5 ug of usable chromium, by contrast 25% of chelatedchromium is absorbed. The chromium RDA for humans is a range of 50 to 200 ug perday for adults.The concentration of Cr in human tissue tends to be higher in newborn animalsand newborn humans than it is in later life. If fact, the tissue Cr levels ofunsupplemented humans steadily decreases throughout life. Of even more concernhas been the steady decline in the average American serum chromium since 1948:Mean Cr blood levels (u/l)Year28–1,00019481319711019724.7– 5.119730.73–1.619740.1619780.4319800.131985The fasting chromium plasma level of pregnant women is lower than that ofnon-pregnant women. Increasing impairment of glucose tolerance in “normal”pregnancy is well documented and reflects a chromium deficiency oftentimesresulting in pregnancy-onset diabetes. One study demonstrated abnormal glucosetolerance in 77 % of clinically “normal” adults over the age of 70. According toRichard Anderson, a USDA spokesperson, stated that “90 percent of Americans aredeficient in chromium.”Gary Evans, of Bemidji State University, Minnesota, very clearly demonstrated anincreased life span in laboratory animals by 33.3 % when they were supplementedwith chromium. Prior to this study, gerontologists, led by Roy Walford, felt asevere restriction of calories was the only way to extend life past the extendedaverage.Deficiencies of Cr in humans are characterized by a wide variety of clinicaldiseases as well as a shortened life expectancy. The clinical manifestations ofchromium deficiency diseases are aggravated by a concurrent vanadium deficiencyand an increase in dietary carbohydrates and sugars.Diseases and Symptoms of Chromium DeficiencyLow blood sugarReactive hypoglycemiaBed wettingPre-diabetesDiabetes (Type 2)HyperinsulinemiaHyperactivityLearning disabilityADD/ADHDHyperirratabilityDepressionManic depression“Bi-polar” diseaseDr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde rages (“Bad Seeds”)Impaired growthPeripheral neuropathyNegative nitrogen balance (protein/muscle loss)Elevated blood triglycerides (> 200)Elevated blood cholesterol (> 270)Coronary artery diseaseAortic cholesterol plaqueInfertility (anovulation and low sperm count)Shortened life spanCs – Cesium (caesium) is found in igneous rocks at 1 ppm; shale at 5 ppm;sandstone and limestone at 0.5 ppm; fresh water at 0.0002 ppm; sea water at0.00005 ppm; soils at 0.3 to 25 ppm; marine plants at 0.07 ppm. Land plants at0.2 ppm; and land animals at 0.064 ppm (highest concentrations in the muscle).Two German chemists, Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, isolated cesium frommineral water collected in Durkheim, Germany, in 1860 using the new “flamespectroscopy” technique.As an alkaline mineral, cesium behaves similarly to sodium, potassium, andrubidium chemically. Cesium and potassium enter into a solute complex whichparticipates in ion antagonism, osmosis, permeability regulation and maintenanceof the colloidal state in the living cell. The increase in dietary andsupplemental potassium increases the rate of excretion or loss of cesium.Cesium chloride is used as part of alternative cancer therapy. Cesium provides“high pH therapy for cancer by entering the cancer cell and producing analkaline environment.” Cesium has been recommended for the treatment of manytypes of cancer including sarcomas, bronchiogenic carcinoma, and colon cancer.Cu – Copper is found in igneous rocks at 55 ppm; shale at 45 ppm; sandstone at 5ppm; limestone at 4 ppm; fresh water at 0.01 ppm; sea water at 0.003 ppm; soilsat 2 to 100 ppm (copper is strongly absorbed by humus; there are known areas inthe world with extreme copper deficiency); marine plants at 11 ppm; land plantsat 14 ppm; marine animals at 4 to 50 ppm (accumulates in the blood ofannelids/worms, crustaceans and molluscs, especially cephalopods); land animalsat 2 to 4 ppm with highest levels in the liver.The metal that is copper, has been used for thousands of years. In the RomanEra, copper was primarily mined in Cyprus; hence it had the name cyprium (metalof Cyprus), later shortened to cuprum. Its compounds are commonly found innature as azurite and turquoise.Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first employed about 4,000 yearsafter the discovery of copper smelting and approximately 2,000 years after“natural bronze” had come into common use. The Bronze Age began in SoutheasternEurope about 3700–3500 BC, and in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended atthe beginning of the Iron Age, 2000–1000 BC in the Near East, and 600 BC inNorthern Europe. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is a relatively newtechnique. It was known to the Greeks, but only became a supplement to bronzeduring the Roman Empire.Aphrodite and Venus represented copper in mythology and alchemy, because of itslustrous beauty, its ancient use in producing mirrors, and its association withCyprus, which was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to theancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus wasassigned to copper.Copper proteins have a wide role in biological electron transport and oxygentransportation, processes that make use of the simple interconversion of Cu(I)and Cu(II). The biological role of copper started with the formation of oxygenin the earth’s atmosphere. The protein hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier for mostmollusks and some arthropods (such as the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus).Because hemocyanin is blue, these invertebrates have blue blood, not the redblood found in vertebrates that use hemoglobin.Copper is also a component of other proteins that are used to process oxygen. Incytochrome c oxidase, which is required for aerobic respiration, copper and ironcooperate in the reduction of oxygen. Copper is also found in many superoxidedismutases, the proteins that catalyze the decomposition of superoxides, byconverting them (by disproportionation) to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.Copper is essential to all living organisms and is a universally importantcofactor for many hundreds of metalloenzymes. Copper deficiency is widespreadand the resultant diseases in humans appear in many forms. Copper is required inmany physiological functions (including RNA, DNA, lysil oxidase cofactor,melanin production (hair and skin pigment), electron transfer of oxygensubcellular respiration, tensile strength of elastic fibers in blood vessels,skin, vertebral discs, etc.).Diseases and Symptoms of Copper DeficiencyWhite hair, gray hair, silver hairDry brittle hair (“steely wool” in sheep)Enzootic ataxia in sheepMad cow disease (BSE cattle)Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (BSE in humans)Ptosis (i.e., sagging tissue—eye lids, skin, breasts, belly, etc.)Hernias (congenital and acquired)Varicose veins/ spider veins (hemorrhoids)Aneurysms (aortic, cerebral, coronary, gastric, etc.)Kawasaki Disease (congenital aneurysms with streptococcal infection)Marfan’s syndromeAnemia (vegan and high milk diets)Hypo and Hyper thyroidArthritis (especially when growth plate is involved)Ruptured & bulging vertebral discsLiver cirrhosisViolent behavior, blind rage, explosive behavior, criminal behaviorLearning disabilitiesCerebral palsy and hypoplasia of the cerebellum (congenital ataxia)High blood cholesterolIron storage disease (hemosiderosis)Reduced glucose tolerance (hypoglycemia, reactive hypoglycemia)Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)Neonatal enzootic ataxia (sway back, lamkruis) was recognized as a clinicalentity in 1937 as a congenital manifestation of a copper deficiency in pregnantsheep. Copper supplements prevented the syndrome which was characterized bydemyelination of the cerebellum (cerebral palsy) and spinal cord.The lesions of enzootic ataxia in sheep are consistent with the lesions of “madcow” disease (Bovine Spongeoform Encephalitis or BSE in cattle andCreutzfeldtJakob disease in humans), which in both cattle and humans is thoughtby the medical community to be transmitted by prions (a non-RNA/non-DNAprotein). Despite finger pointing about this hysteria-driven theory, no one hasof yet satisfied Koch’s postulates by transmitting the disease by injecting pureprions into susceptible cattle or humans, and the existence of aneurysms andloss of hair color, both the result of a copper deficiency, are predictablyfound concurrently with CJD. This would not be the first time in medical historywhere the prevailing medical thought for the cause of certain diseases was aninfectious agent (i.e., this happened with scurvy, beriberi, pellagra,cardiomyopathy, gingivitis, Bell’s palsy, multiple sclerosis, etc.), when infact the disease was caused by a nutritional deficiency.Congenital copper deficiency can produce cavitation or gelatinous lesions of thecerebral white matter, chromatolysis, nerve-cell death, myelin aplasia (failureto form), and a congenital cerebellar hypoplasia (under development). These areall changes identical with human cerebral palsy.Famous people affected or dying of an obvious copper deficiency include AlbertEinstein (white hair, ruptured aneurysm), Paavo Aerola (ruptured cerebralaneurysms), Conway Twitty (ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm), George andBarbara Bush (thyroid disease, white hair). Four to six of every100 Americansautopsied had died of a ruptured aneurysm, and an additional 40% had aneurysmsthat had not yet ruptured.The average well-nourished adult human body contains between 80 and 120 mg ofcopper. Concentrations are higher in the brain, liver, heart, and kidneys. Boneand muscle have lower percentages of copper but contain 50 percent of the bodytotal copper reserves because of their greater mass. It is of interest that thegreatest concentration of copper is found in the newborn, and their dailyrequirement is 0.08 mg/kg; toddlers require 0.04 mg/kg and adults only 0.03mg/kg.The average plasma copper for women ranges from 87 to 153 mg/dl and for men itranges from 89 to 137 mg/dl; about 90 percent of the plasma copper is found inceruloplasmin.Copper functions as a co-factor and activator of numerous cuproenzymes that areinvolved in the development (deficiency of Cu in the pregnant female results incongenital defects of the heart and major blood vessels (incorrectly thought tobe genetic, including Kawasaki Disease and Marfan’s syndrome) and defects of thebrain, such as cerebral palsy and hypoplasia of the cerebellum), and maintenanceof the cardiovascular system (deficiency results in reduced lysyl oxidaseactivity causing a reduction in conversion of pro-elastin into elastin causing adecrease in tinsel strength of arterial walls, dissecting aneurysms and rupturedaneurysms, and skeletal integrity. Copper deficiency results in a specific typeof arthritis of the young in the form of spurs in the bone’s growth plate;deficiency of copper can produce myelin (BSE) defects, anemia, and poor hairkeratinization and loss of hair color.Neutropenia (reduced numbers of neutrophilic WBC) and leukopenia (reduced totalWBC) are the earliest indications of copper deficiency in infants; infants whosediets are primarily cow’s milk frequently develop anemia; iron storage diseasecan result from a chronic copper deficiency.Menkes’ Kinky Hair Syndrome is thought to be a “sex-linked recessive defect” ofcopper absorption. This syndrome can be produced in gluten-intolerant childrenborn to gluten-intolerant mothers (sex-linked but not genetically t ransmitted).The affected infant’s exhibit retarded growth, defective hair and skin keratin,and a loss of hair pigment, low body temperature, degeneration and fracture ofaortic elastin (aneurysms), arthritis in the growth plates of long bones, and aprogressive mental deterioration because brain tissue is totally free of theessential enzyme cytochrome c oxidase.Serum and plasma copper increase 100% in pregnant women and in women using oralcontraceptives. Serum copper levels are also elevated during acute infections,liver disease, and pellagra (niacin deficiency).Dy – Dysprosium, a rare earth metal, is found in igneous rocks at 3 ppm; inshale at 4 to 6 ppm; in sandstone at 7.2 ppm and limestone at 0.9 ppm.Concentrations in terrestrial animals (0.01 ppm) are highest in the bones.Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by a French chemist, Paul Emile Lecoq deBoisbaudran while he was studying holmium oxide. He gave it the name dysprosiumfrom the Greek word dysprositos meaning “hard to get,” however, it was notisolated in its pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques inthe 1950s.Dysprosium has never been found as a free element but rather is found in manyminerals including xenotime, fergusonite, gadolinite, euxenite, polycrase,biomstrandine, monazite, and bastnasite; often with erbium and holmium or otherrare earth elements.Er – Erbium, a rare earth metal, is found in igneous rock at 2.8 ppm; shale at1.9 ppm; sandstone at 1 ppm; limestone at 0.36 ppm; land plants up to 46 ppm inCarya spp.; marine animals at 0.02 to 0.04 ppm and land animals primarily inbone.Erbium (for Ytterby, a village in Sweden) was discovered by Carl Gustaf Mosanderin 1843. Mosander separated “yttria” from the mineral gadolinite into threefractions which he called yttria, erbia, and terbia. Erbium oxide has adistinctive pink color.A large variety of medical applications (dermatology and dentistry) utilizeerbium.In Carl Sagan’s novel “Contact”, a machine is constructed from a blueprintreceived through an extraterrestrial radio transmission. Important (andunexplained) components of the machine are dowels made of erbium.Eu – Europium is a “light” rare earth metal found in igneous rock at 1 to 2 ppm;shale at 1.1 ppm; sandstone at 0.55 ppm; limestone at 0.2 ppm; land plants at0.021 ppm (accumulates up to 16 ppm in Carya spp.); marine animals at 0.01 to0.06 ppm; land animals at 0.00012 ppm in soft tissue and 0.2 ppm in bone.In the late 1880s William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of therare earth elements; however, the discovery of europium is generally credited tothe French chemist Eugene-Anatole Demarcay, who isolated europium in 1901.Europium has extended the life of laboratory species (e.g., Tetrahymenapyriformis) over their normal expected lifespan by 100%. Europium is found inhigher concentrations in breast milk from women in third world countries than inAmerican women.F – Flourine is found in igneous rocks at 625 ppm; in shale at 740 ppm;sandstone sat 270 ppm; limestone at 330 ppm; fresh water at 0.09 ppm; sea waterat 1.3 ppm; soils at 200 ppm (fluoride can be “fixed” or tightly bonded inseveral types of clay). Certain F rich soils in Madras, Spain and South Americaare toxic to grazing livestock.Flourine is found in marine plants at 4.5 ppm; land plants at 0.5 to 40.0 ppm(accumulated by Dichapetolum cymosum); marine animals at 2.0 ppm (accumulates infish bone); land animals at 150 to 500 ppm in mammalian soft tissues and 1,500ppm in bone and teeth.Prior to 1972, flouride was considered essential in animals because of itsapparent benefit for tooth enamel in warding off dental caries (“cavities”). In1972 Schwarz proved that fluoride was in fact an essential mineral.The skeletal reserves of fluoride in an adult man reach 2.6 grams; the averagedaily intake by Americans is 4.4 mg from combined sources of food, tooth paste,supplements and water.Fluoridation of drinking water is still highly controversial. Some studies showthat fluoridated water helps reduce fractures from osteoporosis while otherstudies showed an increase in hip fractures.Clinical toxicity is observed as dental fluorosis at fluoride concentrations of2 to 7 ppm and osteosclerosis at 8 to 20 ppm; chronic system toxicity appearswhen the fluoride levels reach 20 to 80 mg per day over a period of years.Approximately 10,000 American towns and cities serving 100 million people haveadded fluoride to their drinking water at the rate of 1 mg/l, which hasreportedly reduced dental caries by 60 to 70 percent. In certain western statesin the United States, there is an excess of fluoride, reaching levels of 10 to45 ppm with a resultant “mottling” of teeth in children.As a result of epidemiological studies by Yiamouyiannis and Burk in 1977, fullscale congressional hearings were held to examine the charge that 10,000 excesscancer deaths were caused by fluoridation of certain public water systems.Following the committee hearings, the U.S. Public Health Service was given amandate to conduct animal studies to confirm or refute the theory thatfluoridated water increased cancer deaths. The studies were carried out by theNational Toxicology Program under the supervision of the U.S. National PublicHealth Service with a special focus on oral, liver, and bone cancers.In 1990 the results of the fluoride study showed an increase in rat precancerouslesions in the oral mucus membrane cells; there was an increase in cancers ofthe oral mucus membranes (squamous cell carcinoma); a rare form of osteosarcomaappeared at double the rate in males as females; and there was a significantincrease in thyroid follicular cell tumors and liver cancer(hepatocholangiocarcinoma).Fe – Iron is found in igneous rocks at 56,000 ppm; shale at 47,200 pp; sandstoneat 9,800 ppm and limestone at 3,800 ppm; fresh water at 0.67 ppm; sea water at0.01 ppm; soils at 38,000 ppm (iron content is responsible for most soil color);iron is most available in acid soil and availability is greatly influenced bybacterial activity in the soil; marine plants at 700 ppm (very high inplankton); land plants at 140 ppm; marine animals at 400 ppm (high in the bloodof annelids ‘worms,’ echinoderms, fish, and in eggs of cephalad molluscs); ironis essential to all land animals.Iron is the most common element (by mass) forming the planet Earth as a whole,forming much of Earth’s outer crust and inner core.Iron metal has been used since ancient times, though copper alloys, which havelower melting temperatures were used first. Pure iron is soft (softer thanaluminum), but is unobtainable by smelting. Iron is hardened and strengthened byimpurities from the smelting process, including carbon. A certain level ofcarbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) mixed with iron produces steel, which is 1,000times harder than iron.Iron objects of ancient times are rare compared with those made from gold orsilver due to the rapid oxidation of iron. Beads made from meteoric iron datedback to 3500 B.C. were found in Gezah, Egypt. The beads were 7.5 percent nickelwhich is a signature of meteoric iron.Boussingault in the 1860’s was the first to regard iron as an essential nutrientfor animals. During the 1920s an animal model for iron deficiency research wascreated by feeding rats on an exclusive milk diet.Iron is a necessary element found in nearly all living organisms. Ironcontaining enzymes and proteins, often containing heme prosthetic groups,participate in many biological oxidations and in transport. Examples of ironcontaining proteins found in higher organisms include hemoglobin, cytochrome,and catalase.In a healthy adult human there is an average of 3 to 5 gms of total iron. Thenewborn infant has nearly double the amount of iron per kg than adults. Sixty to70 percent of tissue iron is classed as essential or functional iron, and 30 to40 percent as storage iron. The essential iron is found as an integral part ofhemoglobin, myoglobin (muscle oxygen storing pigments, and is particularly richin deep-diving animals such as whales, walrus, seals, etc.), and respiratoryenzymes involved with intracellular oxidation-reduction processes.Functions of iron include cofactor and activator of enzymes and metallo enzymes;respiratory enzymes (hemoglobin: iron is to hemoglobin what Mg is tochlorophyll) and electron transfer for utilization oxygen.Iron is stored in bone marrow and liver (as hemosiderin and ferritin). Heme ironfrom meat is 10 percent available for absorption while iron from fresh plantsources are only one percent available because of phytates which combine tightlywith iron. Absorption of iron takes place primarily in the duodenum where theintestinal environment is still acid.Experimental evidence shows very clearly that “pica” is a specific sign of irondeficiency. Pica (obsessive cravings) can drive children and adults to eat ice(pagophagia), dirt (geophagia), lead paint chips, and high calorie snack foods(that can result in weight gain and obesity).Iron deficiency can result from an unsupplemented pregnancy, menstruation,chronic infections, hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid from salt-restricted dietsor use of proton pump inhibitors), chronic diarrhea, chronic bleeding (fromillness from cancer, uncers, parasites, etc.) and impaired absorption (caused byhigh-fat diets, high phytate diets, gluten intolerance, etc.).Symptoms of iron deficiency include listlessness, fatigue, heart palpitations onexertion, rapid pulse (tachycardia), reduced cognition, memory deficits, soretongue, angular stomatitis, dysphagia (pica), hypochromic microcytic anemia,weight gain, obesity, etc.Stomach hydrochloric acid is required for optimal absorption of iron, ascorbicacid increases absorption of iron. Clays and phytates decrease the efficiency ofiron absorption. The RDA of 18 mg per day as metallic iron is very low if one isa vegan eating a high fiber, high phytate plant material diet.Excess storage of iron can be caused by deficiencies of selenium, copper, zinc,etc., and is falsely blamed for liver cirrhosis, fibrosis of the pancreas,hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and diabetes. These diseases are not the directresult of iron excess.Fr – Francium is found only as radio-active isotopes; the longest lived has ahalflife of 22 minutes. Francium was formerly known as eka-caesium and actiniumK. Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, andradon.Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France in 1939. It was the lastelement found in nature rather than by synthesis.Ga – Gallium is found in igneous rocks at 15 ppm; shale at 19 ppm; sandstone at12 ppm; limestone at 4 ppm; fresh water at 0.001 ppm; sea water at 0.00003 ppm;soils at 0.4 to 6.0 ppm to 30.0 ppm; marine plants at 0.5 ppm; land plants at0.06 ppm; marine animals at 0.5 ppm; and land animals at 0.006 ppm.Gallium (III) is found in nature as trace amounts in bauxite and zinc ores.Elemental gallium is a brittle solid at cold temperatures but will melt andbecome a liquid when held in the hand. Because gallium and ferric salts behavesimilarly in biological systems, gallium ions often mimic iron ions in medicalapplications.In 1871 the existence of gallium was predicted by the Russian chemist DmitriMendeleev, who named it “eka-aluminum” on the basis of its position on theperiodic table.Gallium was claimed to be essential in 1938 and again in 1958. Gallium hasspecific areas of metalloenzyme activity in the human brain and has beenreported to specifically reduce the rate of brain cancer in laboratory animals.British research shows that supplemented diets of pregnant women will reduce therate of brain cancer in children. Gallium maltolate, an orally absorbable formof gallium (III) ion, is used in medical treatments for brain cancer,inflammation, and certain infectious diseases.Gd – Gadolium, a rare earth mineral, is found in igneous rocks at 5.4 ppm; shaleat 4.3 ppm; sandstone at 2.6 ppm; limestone at 0.7 ppm; land plants at up to 70ppm by Carya spp.; marine animals at 0.06 ppm; land animals accumulate gadoliumin bone and liver very quickly after absorption.Ge – Germanium is found in igneous rocks at 5.4 ppm; shale at 1.6 ppm; sandstoneat 0.8 ppm; limestone at 0.2 ppm; sea water at 0.00007 ppm; soil at 1.0 ppm inhumus, especially in alkaline soils; marine animals at 0.3 ppm.The existence of the element germanium had been predicted by Mendeleev in hisperiodic table, however, it was not until 1886 that a German chemist, ClemensWinkler, isolated this element and named it Germanium.Radio do-it-yourself kits from the 40s and 50s utilized the germanium diodecrystal to attract the radio signal to your radio. The germanium atom isstructured so it accepts and transmits electrons, thus acting as asemiconductor. It is therefore not too surprising that germanium is closelyrelated to silica and carbon.Biologically, germanium is a highly efficient electrical impulse initiatorintracellularly and acts as a metallic cofactor for oxygen utilization.In 1950 Dr. Kazuhiko Asai, a Japanese chemist, found traces of germanium infossilized plant life. Russian researchers quickly attributed anti-canceractivity to germanium. Dr. Asai was able to connect the healing properties ofcertain herbs to relatively high levels of germanium. Many of these herbs areaccumulator plants for germanium. Germanium is known to enhance the immunesystem by stimulating the production of natural killer cells, lymphokines suchas IFN(Y), interferon, macrophages and T-suppressor cells.Asai synthesized GE-132, carboxyethyl germanium sesquioxide in 1967 by ahydrolysis method. This organic germanium structure forms a cubic structure withthree negative oxygen ions at the base of a cubic triangle.As an organic or chelated form of germanium GE-132 is absorbed at the rate of 30percent efficiency and the total intake is excreted in one week.Food plants and animals contain small amounts of germanium (e.g., beans at 4.67ppm; tuna at 2.3 ppm). Healing herbs such as garlic, aloe, comfrey, chlorella,ginseng, watercress, Shiitake mushroom, pearl barley, sanzukon, sushi, waternut,boxthorn seed, and wisteria knob contain germanium in amounts ranging from 100to 2,000 ppm.The “holy waters” at Lourdes, known worldwide for their healing properties,contains large amounts of germanium and lithium.Deficiencies of germanium are typified by a severely reduced immune status,arthritis, osteoarthritis, low energy, and cancer.Twenty to 30 mg per day is the recommended maintenance dose for germanium; 50 to100 mg per day is commonly used when an individual has a serious illness thatrequires an increased oxygen level in the body.H – Hydrogen is found in igneous rocks at 1,000 ppm; shale at 5,600 ppm;sandstone at 1,800 ppm; limestone at 860 ppm; fresh water at 111,000 ppm; seawater at 108,000 ppm; soil at 600 to 24,000 ppm (in very acid soils it canbecome the major exchangeable cation); marine plants at 41,000 ppm; land plantsat 55,000 ppm; marine animals at 52,000 ppm; land animals at 70,000 ppm;additionally hydrogen makes up a small portion of the gaseous atmosphere.Hydrogen functions as a major constituent of water (70% of the human body iswater) and all organic molecules. The regulation of the acid-base balance in thehuman body is in fact the regulation of the hydrogen ion (H+) levels of cellularand extracellular fluids.The acidity of the body is critically regulated within a very narrow range bynumerous and complex homeostatic mechanisms. The pH of healthy blood rangesfrom7.36 to 7.44; when the pH falls below 7.30, the patient has acidosis, andwhen the pH rises above 7.44, the person has alkalosis.Blood pH levels below 6.8 and above 7.8 are rapidly fatal. Intracellular pHranges between 6.0 and 7.4; rapid metabolism (hyperthyroid) or decreased bloodflow (heart attack) increases the carbon dioxide levels and therefore decreasespH or acidifies the blood.In contrast to the internal body, the pH of secretions (saliva, gastric acid)and excretions (urine) can be more variable and range from 1.0 in the stomach to8.2 in pancreatic juice and alkaline saliva and urine in vegans.Hydrogen ions circulate in the body in two forms, volatile and non-volatile(metabolic hydrogen ions). Volatile hydrogen ions are found as a weak (carbonicacid), which must continuously be excreted from the lungs as carbon dioxide andwater.Non-volatile (metabolic) hydrogen ions are produced by the normal metabolicprocesses of the body or are consumed as part of food. The largest amounts ofhydrogen ions are produced by normal and abnormal metabolism. Large amounts ofhydrogen ions may be generated and/or retained as part of a disease activity(i.e., emphysema, diabetes, anxiety or loss of chloride ions NaCl deficiency,cystic fibrosis, Addison’s disease, etc.).Hydrogen ion concentration (pH) is controlled by the human body by means ofdilution, buffering, respiratory control of the volatile hydrogen ionconcentrations and kidney control of the non-volatile hydrogen ions. Buffersystems react to hydrogen ion concentrations in fractions of seconds,respiratory controls react in minutes, and the kidneys may require as much as anhour to several days to respond.Metabolic hydrogen ions must be excreted by the kidney in one of three forms: 1. 60% as ammonium ions 2. 40% as weak acids 3. Trace amounts as free hydrogen ionsIt is the amount of free hydrogen ions in the urine that determines the urine’spH. Bladder infections (cystitis) can often times be controlled by acidifyingthe urine with unsweetened cranberry juice.He – Helium is found in igneous rocks at 0.008 ppm and sea water at 0.0000069ppm.Hf – Hafnium is found in igneous rocks at 3 ppm; shale at 2.8 ppm; sandstone at3.4 ppm; limestone at 0.5 ppm; sea water vat 0.000008 ppm; soil at 3.0 ppm;marine plants at 0.4 ppm; land plants at 0.01 ppm; land animals at 0.04 ppm.Hg – Mercury is found in igneous rocks at 0.08 ppm; shale at 0.4 ppm; sandstoneat 0.03 ppm; limestone at 0.3 ppm; fresh water at 0.000008 ppm; sea water at0.00003 ppm; soil at 0.03 to 0.8 ppm (lowest in the surface layers of the soilbecause of leaching and also it volatilizes); marine plants at 0.03 ppm; landplants at 0.015 ppm (Arenria setacea is an accumulator plant); land animals at0.046 ppm (accumulates in the brain, kidney, liver and bone); marine animals at0.0009 to 0.09 ppm.Mercury occurs universally in the bios and has long been known as a potentiallytoxic element (although early Chinese alchemists insisted that the regularconsumption of mercury or “potable gold” was the path to immortality) that couldbe concentrated by industry, mining operations, agriculture, dental repairs(amalgams), and microorganisms that “methylate” mercury in the sediments at thebottom of fresh-water or salt-water rivers, lakes, oceans, and seas.Mercury has been detected in all tissues of fatal accident victims, with noknown mercury exposure except for dental mercury amalgam fillings.Mercury in fish is present as methyl mercury. People who rarely eat fish havevery low levels of mercury (2–5 ug/kg); moderate fish consumers have 10 ug/kg;high fish consumers (especially if they eat the large predator fish such asshark, tuna, or swordfish) will typically have higher levels of up to 400 ug/kg.Mercury mine workers can accumulate mercury which can reach levels that producedisease.Mercury Mine Workers (Cinnabar Miners) Tissue Hg Levels (ppm)image [../images/00004.jpeg]The biological half time of methyl mercury in humans is 70 days and four daysfor inorganic mercury. The placenta acts as a barrier against the passage ofinorganic mercury but not methyl mercury; methyl mercury transfers very easilyto the fetus (“congenital” Minamata disease in infants).The main industrial source of mercury is the chloralkali industry; paint, dentalamalgams, pharmaceuticals, slimicides and algicides (paper and pulp industry),seed treatments as agricultural fungicides, especially dangerous as methylmercury; burning of fossil fuels.The metabolic antagonism between mercury and selenium produces a protection fromselenium poisoning by mercury and the protection against mercury poisoning byselenium. A mutual antagonism between Hg and Se exists; Se protects the humankidney from necrosis (tissue death) by mercury poisoning and the placentaltransfer of mercury.Mercury vapor from dental amalgam has been shown to increase the percent ofantibiotic-resistant bacteria in the gut from 9 percent to 70 percent in monkeysgiven dental mercury fillings; the drug-resistant bacterial population droppedto 12 percent when the fillings were removed.Mercury poisoning from inhalation of mercury vapors was reported during theVictorian Age in “hatters” who used mercuric nitrate paste to prevent mold fromgrowing on felt hats (remember “mad as a hatter” from Alice in Wonderland),goldsmiths and mirror workers; in modern times dentists have developed mentaldisease from chronic exposure to mercury vapors (they have the highest rate ofsuicide amongst all the health professionals); dental patients have developedseveral disease syndromes including multiple sclerosis, ALS (Lou Gehrig’sDisease) and Parkinson’s Disease depending on what part of the brain was mostseverely affected.Annette Funicello of the Micky Mouse Club, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosisin 1994 (she died in April of 2013), which is “known” and theorized by many tobe caused by vapors from dental mercury amalgams.The manifestations of direct Hg poisoning are primarily neurological (i.e.,tremors, vertigo, irritability, moodiness [suicidal], depression, salivation,inflammation of the mouth [stomatitis] and diarrhea).In poisoning with inorganic mercury, the liver and kidneys are the target organsprimarily affected; poisoning with the more toxic alkyl mercury results inprogressive loss of coordination, loss of vision, heart palpitations, loss ofhearing and mental deterioration caused by a toxic neuroencephalopathy in whichthe neuronal cells of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex are selectivelyaffected.In 1962 in Minamata, Japan, mercury-contaminated factory effluent (waste water)was dumped into Minamata Bay, which in turn contaminated aquatic plant life thatwas eaten by fish; the contaminated fish were eaten by the bay residents withdisastrous results.The Minamata Bay disaster was characterized by a high incidence of congenitaldamage to the newborn from mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and high infantmortality.In Iran, a large-scale methyl mercury poisoning was reported when large numbersof people were fed bread made with mercury fungicide-treated seed grain and meat(liver and kidneys) from animals fed the treated grain.The result of consuming the mercury-contaminated grains was thousands of babiesborn retarded and a high incidence of congenital brain defects includingcerebral palsy.Ho – Holmium, a Rare Earth, is found in igneous rocks at 1.2 ppm; in shale at0.6 ppm; sandstone at 0.51 ppm; limestone at 0.17 ppm; land plants at 16 ppm inCarya spp.; marine animals at 0.005 ppm to 0.01 ppm; and land animals at 0.5 ppmin bone.I – Iodine is found in igneous rocks at 0.5 ppm; in shale at 2.3 ppm; sandstoneat 1.7 ppm; limestone at 1.2 ppm; fresh water at 0.002 ppm; sea water at 0.06ppm; soil at 5 ppm (strongly bound in humus; large areas of Earth are known tobe devoid of I); marine plants at 30 to 500 ppm; land plants at 0.42 ppm; marineanimals at 1.0 to 150 ppm; land animals at 0.43 ppm (concentrated in the thyroidgland and hair).Iodine is known to be essential to red and brown algae and all vertebrates.Iodine in combination with the amino acid tyrosine is manufactured into thethyroid hormone thyroxin. Iodine intake in the human diet is usually low tobegin with, but since Americans have begun restricting their salt intake attheir doctors instruction, the rate of “allopath” caused goiter andhypothyroidism has become epidemic.The average American takes in 170 – 250 mcg/day of I; humans lose considerableamounts of I in their sweat (i.e., as high as 146 mcg/day in sweat with onlymoderate exercise). Metallic I is not toxic up to 2,000 mcg/day.Goiter develops in Japanese living along the sea coast despite high daily iodineconsumption. Japanese subjects were fed Chinese cabbage, turnips, buckwheat,noodles, 2.0 mcg, 2.0 mcg I, soybean or seaweed. Goiter developed in all groupsexcept the seaweed group.Northern parts of the Adictis Islands had more clinical goiter than the southernareas, while the southwest was goiter-free (46% of the population of Pisils; 40%of the population of Polje and only 3% of the population of Milahnici); there isidentical I content of the soil in all three locations; however, there is asevere copper deficiency in the soil of the north and the south (copper is arequired cofactor for vertebrates to be able to utilize iodine).Some 11 million Americans have either a hypothyroid (low, underactive) or ahyperthyroid (overactive) condition. Thyroid hormones control and regulatedigestion, heart rate, body temperature, sweat gland activity, nervous andreproductive system, general metabolism, and body weight.Many foods and food additives are known to be “goitrogens” because theyinterfere with the normal thyroid metabolism and function including:Dietary nitrates (e.g., deli slices, sandwich meats, etc.)Water borne nitratesCruciferous vegetables (e.g., cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts,kale, etc.)Gluten intolerancePituitary problemsGeneral nutritional deficienciesSymptoms of Hypothyroidism (Hashimoto’s Disease)FatigueCold intoleranceMuscle aches & painsHeavy or more frequent menstrual periodsLow sex driveBrittle nailsWeight gainHair lossMuscle crampsDepressionConstipationElevated blood cholesterolPuffy faceDry skin and hairInability to concentratePoor memoryGoiterInfertilityCongenital birth defects (Cretinism)Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism (Grave’s Disease)InsomniaHeat intoleranceExcessive sweatingLighter/less frequent periodsHand tremorsRapid pulseExophthalmos (“bug eyes”)Weight lossIncreased appetiteMuscle weaknessFrequent bowel movementsIrritabilityNervousnessGoiterIn – Indium is found in igneous rocks at 0.05 to 1.0 ppm; shale at 0.1 ppm;sandstone and limestone at 0.05 ppm; land animals at 0.016 ppm.Ir – Iridium is found in igneous rocks at 0.001 ppm; land plants at 0.62 ppm;land animals at 0.00002 ppm.K – Potassium is found in igneous rocks at 20,000 ppm; shale at 26,000 ppm;sandstone at 10,700 ppm; limestone at 2,700 ppm; fresh water at 2.3 ppm; seawater at 380 ppm; soil at 14,000 ppm (a major exchangeable cation in all soils,however, the highest levels are found in alkaline soils); marine plants at52,000 ppm; land plants at 14,000 ppm; marine animals at 5,000 to 30,000 ppm;land animals at 7,400 ppm (highest levels found in soft tissues).Potassium is essential to all organisms and is the major cation in cellularcytoplasm, with a wide variety of electrochemical and catalytic functions forenzyme systems. Potassium constitutes five percent of the total mineral contentof the human body; it is the major cation of the intracellular fluid and thereis a small amount in the extracellular fluid. With sodium, the other“electrolyte,” K participates in the maintenance of normal water balance,osmotic equilibrium and acid-base balance. Potassium participates with Ca in theregulation of neuromuscular activity.Potassium is easily absorbed, 90% of ingested K is excreted through the urine;there is essentially no storage of K in the human body, thus requiring asignificant daily intake of 5,000 mg.Muscular weakness and mental apathy are features of chronic K deficiency;hypokalemic cardiac failure is the most serious K deficiency event. Diuretics,both natural and prescribed, sweating from colds, flu and/or exercise, vomiting,and diarrhea increase the rate of loss of all minerals including K compared withnormal expected daily excretion rate.Kr – Krypton is found in igneous rocks at 0.0001 ppm; sea water at 0.0025 ppm.Krypton is legendary for having debilitating effects on “Superman” but inreality is totally harmless for humans, and in fact is thought to be anessential element.La – Lanthanum is a “light” rare earth metal and is found in igneous rocks at 30ppm; shale at 20 ppm; sandstone at 7.5 ppm; limestone at 6.2 ppm; sea water at0.000012 ppm; soil at 30 ppm; marine plants at 10 ppm; land plants at 0.085 ppm(accumulated by Carya spp. and by the yeast Candida albicans up to 370 ppm/day.This may be how Candida infestations cause a debilitating energy sapping“chronic fatigue-like” disease by “stealing” La from the patient); marinemammals at 0.1 ppm; land animals at 0.0001 ppm in soft tissue and 0.27 ppm inbone.The growth of the protozoa Blepherisma and Tetrahymena pyriformis is stimulatedand life span doubled by the presence of La at concentrations of 0.32 ppm.Li – Lithium is found in igneous rocks at 20 ppm; shale at 66 ppm; sandstone at15 ppm; limestone at 5 ppm; fresh water at 0.0011 ppm; sea water at 0.18 ppm;soil at 30 ppm (Li+ is freely mobile in the soil); marine plants at 5 ppm; landplants at 0.1 ppm; marine animals at 1 ppm; land animals at 0.02 ppm.“Some of us it seems are born to be bad.” Scientists say they are on the vergeof pinning down genetic and biochemical abnormalities that predispose theirbearers to violence. An article in the journal Science in the summer of 1993carried the headline: EVIDENCE FOUND FOR A POSSIBLE AGGRESSION GENE.Waiting in the wings are child-testing programs, drug manufacturers, insurancecompanies, civil rights advocates, defense attorneys, and anxious citizens forwhom the violent criminal has replaced the beady-eyed communist as the bogeyman.Crime thus joins homosexuality, smoking, divorce, schizophrenia, alcoholism,shyness, political liberalism, intelligence, religiosity, cancer, and blue eyesamong the many aspects of human life for which it is claimed that biology(genetics) is destiny. Physicists have been pilloried for years for this kind ofreductionism, but in biology it makes everybody happy; the scientists and thepharmaceutical companies expand their domain; politicians have “progress” topoint to; the smokers, divorcees and serial killers get to blame their problemon biology (genetics), and “we get the satisfaction of knowing they are sickand—not like us at all.”A great study was done by Dr. Gerhard Schrauzer, professor and head of thedepartment of chemistry at the University of California, San Diego relating theviolent crime and hard drug use rate of Texas counties to the lithium levels inthe counties drinking water:Using data for 27 counties from 1978 to 1987, it is shown that the incidencerates of suicide, homicide, and rape are significantly higher in counties whosedrinking water supplies contain little or no lithium than in counties with waterlithium levels ranging from 70 – 170 ug/L; the differences remain statisticallysignificant (p<0.01) after corrections for population density. The correspondingassociations with the incidence rates of robbery, burglary, and theft werestatistically significant with p<0.05. These results suggest that lithium hasmoderating effects on suicidal and violent criminal behavior at levels that maybe encountered in municipal water supplies. Comparisons of drinking waterlithium levels in the respective Texas counties, with the incidence of arrestsfor possession of opium, cocaine and their derivatives (morphine, heroin, andcodeine) from 1981 to 1986 also produced statistically significant inverseassociations...Since 1915, the risk of clinical depression nearly doubles with each succeedinggeneration. Myrna M. Weissman, a psychiatrist at Columbia University, New YorkCity, says that, “Depression is a worldwide phenomenon happening at younger andyounger ages.”In 1935, the age of early onset of depression was during the late 20s; in 1955onset of depression dropped to between 15 and 20. One in four women and one inten men will develop depression. While the professional psychiatrist verballysays that depression and manic depression are due to “feelings that we are outof control of our lives, negative thinking, self-recrimination (“I’m a loser”)are the root cause of depression,” they treat depression successfully with thetrace mineral Li. Depression and manic depression with all that the diagnosisimplies are simply a lithium deficiency aggravated by a high sugar or alcoholconsumption.Prozac, America’s “leading” antidepressant pharmaceutical was introduced in1987, sales soared to $350 million in 1989, more than what was spent totally onall antidepressants just two years earlier. Projections estimate Prozac sales toexceed $ 1 billion in sales by 1995 as a result of allopathic doctors generating650,000 prescriptions of the drug per month!Animal studies show that a deficiency of Li results in reproductive failure,infertility, reduced growth rate, shortened life expectancy and seriousbehavioral problems. In humans, manic depression, clinical depression,“bi-polar” disease “Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde” and “Bad Seed” behavior, hyperactivity,ADD, ADHD and autism are hallmarks of Li deficiency.Human Behavioral Acts Resulting From Lithium Deficiency:Mass murder (Austin, TX, Waco TX, Oklahoma, Columbine, Fort Hood, Virginia Tech,Batman theater, Sandy Hook, Boston Marathon, Washington Navy Yard)Serial killers (Jack the Ripper, Boston Strangler, Jeffrey Dahmer, GreenRiver Murderer, Michigan Old Man Stabber, etc.)CannibalismDomestic violenceViolent crime (arson, murder, rape, assault, armed robbery, etc.)Suicide (Civilian, military, teenagers, etc.)Suicide bombersNotorious Serial Killers (Vampires, Werewolves, and Cannibals)image [../images/00008.jpeg]part0032.html#ch3a*At the peak of Elias Abuelazam’s (Old Man Stabber) killing spree (20 stabbedand 5 killed), Wallach was approached late at night at an intersection in GrandRapids, Michigan by a man who pulled up in a Chevy Blazer (the killer’s vehicle)and stated, “Hey old man, hop in and I’ll end your pain,” where upon Wallachresponded, “Hop out and I’ll end your pain!” The driver (presumably EliasAbuelazam) sped off.The anthropological debate over cannibalism, mass murder, and serial killers hasraged over three theories of origin: (1) The satisfaction of certainpsychosexual needs; (2) Utilitarian adaption—humans adapt to extreme famine byeating other humans; (3) a cultural logic of the cycle of life, death, andreproduction (usually endocannibalism or “mortuary” cannibalism).Statistically cannibalism can be tied to hunger, but hunger for calories andprotein alone cannot be tied to cannibalism, so we will add a fourth category ofcannibalism: (4) the ultimate extension of pica (bizarre cravings and behaviorresulting from extreme mineral deficiencies, such as Fe, P, Li, Ca, etc.).The 1973 movie Soylent Green, starring Charlton Heston as a police investigator,portrayed a “benevolent” government in the year 2022, that had to deal withmindboggling overpopulation. There were 40 million people in New York City aloneand a depleted food supply.Chelated Li supplemented at 1,000 to 2,000 ug/dl caused a dose-dependentincrease in hair Li levels; hair Li levels increased after four weeks ofsupplementation and leveled off and became stable after three months; when theLi supplementation was stopped, hair levels dropped to pre-supplement values intwo months. This scenario does not appear with the use of lithium carbonate(metallic).A comparison of 2,648 subjects showed that 65% had hair Li values rangingbetween 0.04 to 0.14 ug/G; 16% contained more than 0.14 ug/G and 18.4% had lessthan 0.04 ug/G. The highest levels of Li were found in university students fromTijuana, Mexico and the lowest levels were found in Munich, Germany.According to Wallach and Ma in the book Rare Earths: Forbidden Cures, normalcontrols showed almost 400 times more hair Li than do the violent criminals fromCalifornia, Florida, Texas, and Oregon.The estimated daily intake of Li by the EPA ranges from 650 to 3,100 ug/d;however, much of this Li is metallic and not biologically available. Lithiumsupplementation increases the hair concentrations of V, Al, Pb, AS, and Co.Short term supplementation of Li elevates serum B12 levels; with long termsupplementation of Li serum B12 drops.Lu – Lutecium, a rare earth element, is found in igneous rocks at 0.5 ppm; shaleat 0.33 ppm; sandstone at 0.096 ppm; limestone sat 0.067 ppm; land plants at upto 4.5 ppm by Carya spp.; marine animals sat 0.003 ppm; land animals at 0.00012ppm in soft tissue and 0.08 ppm in bone.Mg – Magnesium is found in igneous rocks at 23,300 ppm; in shale at 15,000 ppm;sandstone 10.700; limestone at 2,700 ppm; fresh water at 4.1 ppm; sea water at1,350 ppm; soil at 5,000 ppm (highest in soil derived from basalt, serpentine ordolomite) – Mg is the second most common exchangeable cation in most soils;marine plants at 5,200 ppm; land plants at 3,200 ppm; marine animals at 5,000ppm; land animals at 1,000 ppm (accumulates in mammalian bone).Magnesium is essential to all living organisms and has electrochemical,catalytic and structural functions, activates numerous enzymes, and is aconstituent of all chlorophylls.The adult human contains 20 to 28 grams of total body magnesium. Approximately60% is found in bone, 26% is associated with skeletal muscle and the balance isdistributed between various organs and body fluids. Serum levels of Mg rangefrom 1.5 to 2.1 mEq/L; it is second to K as an intracellular cation – half ofthe Mg, including most that is bound in the bone is not exchangeable.Magnesium is required for the production and transfer of energy for proteinsynthesis, for contractility of muscle and excitability of nerves, and as acofactor in myriads of enzyme systems. AN EXCESS OF MG WILL INHIBIT BONECALCIFICATION. Calcium and magnesium have antagonistic roles in normal musclecontraction—calcium acting as the stimulator and Mg as the relaxer. An excessiveamount of Ca can induce signs of Mg deficiency.The rate of absorption of Mg ranges from 24 to 85%. The lesser absorption rateis for metallic sources of Mg, the higher levels are associated with plantderived colloidal sources. Vitamin D has no effect on Mg absorption; thepresence of fat, phytates and calcium reduces the efficiency of Mg absorption.High performance athletes lose a considerable amount of Mg in sweat.The RDA for Mg is 350 mg/day for adult males, 300 mg/day for adult females and450 mg/day for pregnant and lactating females. If kidneys are healthy there isno evidence of toxicity at up to 6,000 mg/day.Deficiencies of Mg produces a wide variety of deficiency diseases and symptoms.Magnesium-Deficiency Diseases:AsthmaAnorexiaMenstrual migrainesGrowth failureECG changesNeuromuscular problemsTetany (convulsions)DepressionMuscular weaknessMuscle “Ties”TremorsVertigoCalcification of small arteries“Malignant” calcification of soft tissueMn – Manganese is found in igneous rocks at 950 ppm; shale at 850 ppm; sandstoneat 50 ppm; limestone at 1,100 ppm; fresh water at 0.012 ppm; sea water at 0.002ppm; soil at 850 ppm (can be a major exchangeable cation in very acid soil);marine plants at 1 to 60 ppm (lowest in fish); land animals at 0.2 ppm (highestin concentrations in mammalian liver and kidney); the total body content of Mnin humans is only 10 to 20 mg.Manganese is essential to all-known living organisms; it activates numerousenzyme systems including those involved with glucose metabolism, energyproduction and superoxide dismutase; it is a major constituent of severalmetalloenzymes, hormones, and proteins of humans. Manganese is part of thedevelopmental process of and the structure of the fragile ear bones and jointcartilage.Excessive levels of Mn found in certain community water supplies and in someindustrial processes can produce a Parkinsonian syndrome or a psychiatricdisorder (“locura manganica”) resembling schizophrenia.Deficiency diseases of Mn are very striking, ranging from severe congenitalbirth defects (such as congenital ataxia, deafness, chondrodystrophy, etc.),asthma, convulsions, retarded growth, skeletal defects, disruption of fat andcarbohydrate metabolism to joint problems in children and adults (tendon andligament degeneration, TMJ, repetitive motion syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome,etc.)Diseases of Manganese Deficiency:Congenital ataxiaCongenital Deafness (malformation, hypoplasia, or aplasia of otolithes)AsthmaChondromalaciaChondrodystrophy“Slipped Tendon”Defects of chondroitin sulfate metabolism (tendons and ligaments)TMJRepetitive Motion SyndromeCarpal Tunnel SyndromeConvulsionsInfertility (i.e., failure to ovulate, testicular atrophy)Still births (miscarriages)Loss of libido in both males and femalesRetarded growth rateShortened long bonesIn 1994 Mn deficiency cost corporate America $20 billion dollars per year andaccounts for 56% of the 331,600 gradual onset work related illnesses. In 1991orthopedic surgeons performed 100,000 unnecessary carpal tunnel syndromesurgeries ($4,000 per surgery) with lost work, wages, and medical cost of$29,000 per case.At risk for the repetitive motion syndrome are those with a Mn deficiency, thoseworking in the fields of computers (in journalism, airline reservations,directory assistance, law, data entry, graphic design and securities brokerage).Chief among the blue collar victims are the auto assembly workers, chickenpluckers, meat cutters, postal employees, dock workers, etc.Repetitive motion syndrome was observed three centuries ago in monks who werescribes and was described in 1717 by Bernardo Ramazzini, an Italian physician(considered to be the father of occupational medicine).Repetitive motion syndrome victims (people with Mn deficiency) have reached suchnumbers that federal legislation has been passed in the form of OSHA and theAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to attempt to ensure workplace safety. Asa result, large numbers of ergonomically correct keyboards and devices have beendeveloped. We see millions of people at work with Velcro wrist, neck, elbow,finger, knee, back and hip supports—all for Mn deficiencies!The allopathic medical system would still prefer to spend the patient’s,corporation’s, tax payer’s, and government’s money on devices, surgery, and painrelief, rather than to eliminate a problem by simply supplementing the patientwith proper biochemical nutrition.Mo – Molybdenum is found in igneous rocks at 1.5 ppm; shale at 2.6 ppm;sandstone at 0.02 ppm; limestone at 0.4 ppm; fresh water at 0.00035 ppm; seawater at 0.01 ppm; soil at 2 ppm (strongly concentrated by humus, especially inalkaline soils); a few soils worldwide are rich enough in molybdenum to cause Mopoisoning in animals consuming the local plants; numerous soils worldwide are Modeficient; marine plants at 0.45 ppm; land plants at 0.9 ppm; marine animals at0.6 to 2.5 ppm; land animals at 0.2 ppm (highest levels in the liver andkidney).Molybdenum is essential to all organisms as a constituent of numerousmetalloenzymes. Molybdenum is known to be an integral part of no less than threeessential enzymes: 1. Xanthine oxidase 2. Aldehyde oxidase 3. Sulfite oxidaseThe average American daily intake in food ranges from 76 to 109 mcg per day; theRDA for MO is 250 mcg per day.Toxicity occurs at 10 mg per day as a gout-like disease and interference withcopper metabolism.N – Nitrogen is found in igneous rocks at 20 ppm; fresh water at 0.23 ppm; seawater at 0.5 ppm; soils at 1,000 ppm (99% present as a non-basic N bound inhumus); marine plants at 15,000 ppm; land plants at 30,000 ppm; marine animalsat 75,000 ppm; land animals at 100,000 ppm.Nitrogen functions as a structural atom in protein, nucleic acids (RNA, DNA) anda wide variety of organic molecules. Dietary N (as protein) furnishes the aminoacids for synthesis of tissue protein and other special metabolic functions: 1. Proteins are used to repair worn out body tissue (anabolic process) 2. Proteins are used to build new tissue (muscle, infant growth, childhood, teenagers, pregnancy) 3. Proteins can be an emergency source of heat and energy (albeit more expensive in biological terms than fat or carbohydrate) 4. Proteins make up essential body secretions and fluids (i.e., enzymes, hormones, mucus, milk, semen, etc.) 5. Blood plasma proteins maintain osmotic fluid balance (hypoproteinemia results in edema) 6. Proteins maintain acid-base balance of blood and tissues 7. Proteins aid in transport of other essential substances (e.g., minerals, fats, vitamins, etc.) 8. Proteins make up basic immunoglobulins (antibodies) 9. Proteins provide a N pool for the synthesis of amino acids and new proteinsClassic protein deficiency results in infertility, poor growth, lowered immunestatus, edema, and Kwashiorkor (potbellied, thin children of third worldcountries). The availability and usability of N from various foods is quitedifferent and must be considered when choosing N sources.Nitrogen/Protein Utilization Values of Common FoodsN Source (Protein)Chemical ScoreRat ScoreWhole egg10094Human milk10087Cow’s milk9582Soya bean7465Sesame5054Peanut6547Cotton seed8159Maize4952Millet6344Rice6759Wheat5348Na – Sodium is found in igneous rocks at 23,600 ppm; shale at 9,600 ppm;sandstone at 3,300 ppm; limestone at 400 ppm; fresh water at 6.3 ppm; sea waterat 10,500 ppm; soil at 6,300 ppm (is a major exchangeable cation insoil—especially alkaline soil); marine plants at 33,000 ppm; land plants at1,200 ppm; marine animals at 4,000 to 48,000 ppm; and land animals at 4,000 ppm.“Salt hunger” dates back to the very beginning of animals and man and is one ofthe very basic cravings of living organisms. Carnivores (man or beast) do nottypically show the great craving for salt because meat contains relatively largeamounts of NaCl, but herbivores and human vegetarians demand large amounts ofNaCl because there is little or no natural NaCl in grains, vegetables and fruit.The average Na dietary intake per day in Western cultures is five to 12 G/daywhile the Japanese who on the average out live Americans by four years consumean average of 28 G/day!Sodium, Cl and K are three indispensable “electrolytes” so intimately associatedin the body that they can be presented together. Sodium makes up two percent, Kfive percent and Cl three percent of the total mineral content of the humanbody. All three are widely distributed throughout the body tissues and fluids;however, Na and Cl are primarily extracellular (outside the cell) minerals,while K is an intracellular (inside the cell) mineral. Sodium, K and Cl areinvolved in at least four important physiological functions in the body: 1. Maintenance of normal water balance and distribution 2. Maintenance of normal osmotic equilibrium 3. Maintenance of normal acid-base balance 4. Maintenance of normal muscular irritability and neurological impulse and neurological transmissionHormonal control of Na, K and Cl balance is regulated by the adrenal cortexhormones as well as by the anterior pituitary gland. Addison’s disease, a lossof function of the adrenal cortex, results in the loss of Na and K retentionwith clinical signs of general weakness, muscle cramps, weight loss and a marked“salt hunger.” The symptoms can be relieved with the supplementation of NaCl orby administering adrenal cortical hormones.Deficiencies of NaCl occur primarily in hot weather (the heat wave of July 1993)or heavy work or exercise in a hot environment when large volumes of sweat arerequired for body cooling. “Water intoxication” occurred in infants fed low Naformulas because of the allopathic doctor’s paranoia about Na. Their brainsswelled causing death from a simple Na deficiency.The treatment for Na deficiency is water and salt either orally or IV (saline0.9%).Nb – Niobium is found in igneous rocks at 20 ppm; shale at 11 ppm; sandstone at0.05 ppm; limestone 0.3 ppm; sea water at 0.00001 ppm; land plants at 0.3 ppm;and marine animals at 0.001 ppm.Nd – Neodymium, a rare earth metal, is found in igneous rocks at 28 ppm; shaleat 16 ppm; sandstone at 11 ppm; limestone at 4.3 ppm; marine plants at 5 ppm;land plants accumulates up to 460 ppm in Carya spp.; marine animals at 0.5 ppm;accumulates in the liver and bone of land animals.Neodymium is a “light” rare earth proven to enhance normal cell growth anddouble the life spans of laboratory species.Ne – Neon is found in igneous rocks at 0.005 ppm and sea water at 0.00014 ppm.Ni – Nickel is found in igneous rocks at 75 ppm; shale at 68 ppm; sandstone at 200m; limestone at 20 ppm; fresh water at 0.01 ppm; sea water at 0.0054 ppm;soils at 40 ppm (higher in soils derived from serpentine); marine plants at 3.0ppm; land plants at 3.0 ppm (accumulated by Alyssum bertalonii); marine animalsat 0.4 to 25 ppm and land animals at 0.8 ppm (accumulates in RNA).Symptoms of Nickel Deficiency in the Rat:Poor growthLower hematocrit (anemia from B12 deficiency)Depressed oxidative functions of the liverIncreased newborn mortalityRough/dry coatDermatitisDelayed pubertyDecreased ability to absorb dietary zincLess than 10% of ingested metallic nickel is absorbed. Nickel deficiency wasfirst reported in 1970.Nickel functions as a cofactor for metalloenzymes and facilitatesgastrointestinal absorption of iron and zinc. Optimal tissue levels of B12 arenecessary for the optimal biological function of nickel. B12 deficiency resultsin an increased need for nickel by animals and man.Np – All isotopes of neptunium are radioactive. The half life of Np is 2.2 x106. Neptunium accumulates in mammalian bone after ingestion; Neptunium has beenfound in fresh water organisms in the Hanford River (USA).O – Oxygen is found in igneous rock at 464,000 ppm; shale at 483,000 ppm;sandstone at 492,000 ppm; limestone at 497,000 ppm; fresh water at 889,000 ppm;sea water at 857,000 ppm; soils at 490,000 ppm; marine plants at 470,000 ppm;land plants at 410,000 (except anaerobic organisms); marine animals at 400,000ppm; land animals at 186,000 ppm.Terrestrial O consists of 99.76% 16O with a half life of less than two minutes.Oxygen is a structural atom of water (in and out of living systems), and of allorganic compounds of biological interest; O2 is required for “respiration” byall organisms (except for anaerobic organisms). We can live for 30 days withoutfood, three to seven days without water under ideal circumstances, but only forfour minutes without gaseous oxygen. Oxygen is the most critical of allelemental factors necessary for the maintenance of human life.According to the 1980s U.S. Geological Survey, our earth’s atmosphere had 50%oxygen 75 million years ago when dinosaurs flourished (these oxygen levelestimates were arrived at by inserting micro-needles into trapped air bubbles inpolar ice and determining the oxygen level in ancient ice). Some paleontologistsclaim that the simultaneous and universal demise of the dinosaurs followed thewidespread quieting of the earth’s volcanoes that reduced the levels ofatmospheric CO2, which in turn reduced the oxygen levels to 38%. It is theorizedthat the 12% drop in the earth’s oxygen levels was sufficient to cause theapocalyptic demise of the dinosaur.The Geological Survey also reported that the earth’s atmosphere still contained38% oxygen as recently as 100 years ago. During the 1950s, the percentage of Oin our atmosphere dropped to 21% and in the 21st century it has dropped to 19%of our gaseous atmosphere.The continued drop in O levels in our atmosphere reflects an increase inoxygen-consuming species (including the runaway human population) andfossil-fuel burning machines (i.e., vehicles electric and power-generatingplants, etc.) and less oxygen production (from decreasing acreages of rainforests and aquatic algae). The net result of this continued drop in oxygenlevels is a relative “anaerobic state” compared with the 38% of just 100 yearsago and a very marked “anaerobic state” compared with the 50% oxygen levels 75million years ago.Most pathogenic organisms (disease producing) are by themselves anaerobic andare “happier” and flourish and reproduce with more vigor in the absence ofoxygen (e.g., gangrene organisms, type A streptococcus, etc.) or are able tosurvive and grow in living cells weakened by low-oxygen environments (e.g.,viruses, yeast, fungus, cancer, etc.).The question is why have anaerobic diseases “suddenly appeared” in the 80s and90s during the last quarter of the 20th century, diseases with which we havelittle or no human history or experience?Regardless of the name, tuberculosis or consumption or scrofula can be found in5,000 year old mummies from Egypt and China, 1,000 year old corpses from Peruand ancient writings from the Greeks and Romans.The “new” modern day anaerobic diseases have no history with humans, nor willyou find them in biblical or ancient writings describing HIV, EBV, CMV, HerpesII, Hanta Virus, Candida, Toxic Shock Syndrome from Staphylococcus spp., E. coliand “flesh-eating” Type A Streptococcus spp.The most plausible theory is that the anaerobic disease causing organisms laidaround in dormant states (spores) for 100s, 1,000s or even millions of years aslong as relatively high level of oxygen (at 50, 38 or even 21%) were present inour atmosphere to inhibit their activity and growth. With the precipitous dip inatmospheric oxygen, we are having an “oxygen counter revolution” with a returnto an anaerobic bios.Aerobic Diseases of HumansDiseaseYear of AppearanceVIRAL Mycoplasma (rheumatoid arthritis—virus-like)?Herpes II (sexually transmitted herpes)1978 HIV (AIDS)1982EBV, CMV (chronic fatigue syndrome)1982Hanta Virus (“Four Corners Disease”)1993BACTERIA Staphylococcus (Toxic Shock Syndrome)1982E. coli (Toxic Shock Syndrome)1993Type A Streptococcus (“flesh-eating” Strep)1994YEAST/FUNGUS Candida albicans (“Candida”)1982Coccidiomycosis (“Valley Fever”)1900 (35 cs/yr) 1992 (1,450 cs/yr)CANCER All forms1900 (1 cs/10) 1994 (3 cs/4)Dr. Otto Warburg, of the Max Plank Institute, Germany, was the recipient of twounshared Nobel Prizes (Linus Pauling was the only other individual to be awardedtwo unshared Nobel Prizes)—one for discovering the amino acid and describing thebasic composition of proteins and the other for determining that the metabolismof the cancer cell is fermentative and anaerobic while the normal non-cancerouscell is fully aerobic. During the 1950s Warburg was able to demonstrate clearlythat cancer cells ferment sugar under anaerobic conditions and die in thepresence of oxygen.Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps defend humans by identifying,engulfing, and destroying invading microorganisms, such as a virus, bacteria,yeast, fungus, parasites and cancer cells, use hydrogen peroxide as their“lethal weapon.” Neutrophils are packed with small organelles (microscopicorgans) called peroxisomes, whose sole function is to produce hydrogen peroxideand eject it onto the captured pathogen or cancer cell for the specific purposeof destroying it. Neutrophils tend to be very sloppy, dribbling theirover-production of hydrogen peroxide freely into the general circulation.The potential danger of hydrogen peroxide free in the blood stream is that itcould become a “loose-cannon.” However, we humans are blessed with an enzymecalled catalase that literally coats the surfaces of human red blood cells andthe linings of blood vessels. The function of the enzyme catalase is to rapidlyfacilitate the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide down to water (H2O) andsinglet oxygen (O).There are concerns by the uninitiated regarding the “free radical” status of“singlet” oxygen (O) which has a free electron when either ozone (O3), hydrogenperoxide (H2O2), magnesium peroxide (MgO2) or chlorine dioxide (ClO2) decomposeinto water and singlet oxygen, magnesium and singlet oxygen, or chlorine andsinglet oxygen.When singlet or atomic oxygen come into direct contact with tissue cells outsideof the circulatory system (in a cell culture, test tube, wound, etc.) the cellswill die; however, in the whole animal or human, other biological factors comeinto play to protect the whole organism to prevent the “free radical” damage.When ingested in proper dilution on an empty stomach or administered by IV underproper conditions, food grade hydrogen peroxide is readily absorbed through thestomach and duodenal walls directly into the blood stream where it isimmediately broken down into water and singlet oxygen. The free electron of thesinglet oxygen ether combines with a free electron of a carcinogenic-freeelectron (carcinogenic substances) or with the free electron of another singletoxygen, becoming O2. Carcinogenic-free electrons frequently remain freeelectrons under many circumstances, actually “quite happy” with their freeelectron status. On the other hand, the free electron of the singlet oxygen doesnot like to be a singlet electron and if it doesn’t locate another free electronto attach to it will in nanoseconds grab onto another singlet oxygen and becomean O2—the required stuff of respiration and life itself!Ozone (O3) -> H2O2 + O-Catalase -> H2O + O2Oxygen in the form of hydrogen peroxide has been used topically, intravenouslyand orally since the Civil War. It has been used widely in Europe for more than50 years for alternative cancer therapies, circulatory disease,arteriosclerosis, emphysema, asthma, gangrene and more recently as a therapy forsurvivors of stroke (stroke victims have inactive but living cells surroundingthe stroke site known as “sleeping beauty” cells that can be reactivated or jumpstarted when they are exposed to several atmospheres of oxygen in hyperbaricchambers).In Dr. Renate Vicbahn’s book, The Use of Ozone in Medicine, cited 22 refereedmedical journal articles that illustrated the therapeutic effect of ozoneagainst cancer cells. There does appear to be a bell-shaped curve or“therapeutic window” (i.e., hormesis) for the optimal dosage of ozone (20 to 100u/ml of blood); anything less is ineffective and anything more can be damagingto normal cells.Os – Osmium is found in igneous rocks at 0.0015 ppm. It oxidizes organic matteras OsO4 and is reduced to Os.P – Phosphorus is found in igneous rocks at 1,050 ppm; shale at 700 ppm;sandstone at 170 ppm; limestone at 400 ppm; fresh water at 0.005 ppm; sea waterat 0.07 ppm; soil at 650 ppm (“fixed” by hydrous oxides of Al and Fe in acidsoil). Great and vast reaches of Earth are deficient in P; marine plants at3,500 ppm; land plants at 2,300 ppm; marine animals at 4,000 to 18,000 ppm; landanimals at 17,000 to 44,000 ppm.Phosphorous is an extremely important essential mineral. However, it gets littleor no attention from nutritionists because it is widely available in many foods.Phosphorus is a major structural mineral for bones and teeth, and it has morefunctions in the human than any other mineral, including its role as a vitalconstituent of nucleic acids; it activates enzymes for several steps of the ATPenergy cycle; and is used in RBC metabolism (a complete discussion of P wouldrequire a discussion of every metabolic function in the body).Second in abundance only to calcium in the human body, P comprises 22 percent ofthe body’s total mineral content. The human body contains about 800 grams of P,(just short of two pounds), of which 700 grams is found in bones and teeth asinsoluble calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite crystals). The balance of P in thehuman body is found as biologically active intra and extracellular colloidal Pin combination with carbohydrates, lipids, protein, and a wide variety of otherbiologically active organic compounds including the blood’s major pH bufferingsystem. B-complex vitamins function as coenzymes to intracellular metabolicfunctions only when combined with P.Phosphorus is part of most proteins and as such becomes problematic (elevated Pintake increases Ca requirements) when “high protein diets” are consumed byaggravating osteoporosis, arthritis, high blood pressure, loose teeth, etc.Phosphorus is present as phytates in cereals and grain flours. Therefore, ifbread is made from unleavened flours, the phytic acid will complex with Ca, Fe,Zn and other minerals in the gut, thus further lowering their absorption rate.The average human adult dietary intake of P is 1,000 to 1,500 mg/day. In adultsand older children, the absorption of metallic P is limited to approximatelythree to five percent and as high as eight to 12 percent in infants. Mixeddietary sources of P (chelated forms) may be absorbed at the rate of 40 to 50%.Optimal absorption of metallic and chelated P occurs when the Ca:P ratio is 1:1.Colloidal P is absorbed up to 98%.Deficiencies of P have long been recognized in livestock, but only recently hasa deficiency of P been considered important in humans. The widespread,universal, and ultimately fatal results of P deficiency are related to itswidespread use in biological functions, significantly as a result of a decreasein ATP synthesis (complete metabolic energy failure) with associatedneuromuscular, skeletal, blood, and kidney diseases.Phosphate appetite was described by LeVaillant (1796) as the anxious search bycattle in phosphate-deficient South African pastures for discarded dogchew-bones (osteophagia); they also chewed on wood (cribbing, pica) and eachother’s horns. Bone chewing (osteophagia, a form of pica) has been reported inmany wild species of herbivores including the reindeer, caribou, red deer,camel, giraffe, elephant and the wildebeest.Elephants have been observed eating limestone roadbeds and large termite heapsas ready and available mineral supplements. A search for calcium-rich edibleclays and soils and territorial disputes over limited supplies led to wars intribal Africa.Obesity and an overweight condition is synonymous with Americans. In fact, atthis writing, America is the most obese nation in the world—America is “numberone!” Pica in its various forms is a behavior that is driven by mineraldeficiencies (for example, from phosphorus, iron, etc.) Interestingly enough,neither vitamin deficiencies, protein deficiencies, nor calorie deficiencyinitiates this “pica” behavior; nor will supplementing vitamins or eating sugar,carbohydrates, fats, protein, or salt quench it!!Wallach and Ma published Hell’s Kitchen, which outlined and documented the“cause, prevention, and cure for obesity” as mineral deficiencies (ofphosphorus, iron, etc.) rather than lack of exercise and eating too much.Clinical P depletion and resultant low blood P (hypophosphatemia) result from IVadministration of glucose or TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) without Psupplementation, excessive use of antacids, hyperparathyroidism (lowcalcium/high phosphate diets are the cause of this one), improper treatment ofdiabetic acidosis, use of diuretics, sweating during exercise, and alcoholismwith and without liver disease.Vegetarians and vegans, who do not supplement with minerals, rarely have Pdeficiency (unless they have a chronic gluten intolerance from high whole-grainconsumption). However, because of their high phytic acid intake (raw vegetables)they always have other mineral deficiencies (such as lack of Ca, Cu, Cr, V, Li,Zn, etc.) unless they supplement.Pa – Protoactinium is found in igneous rocks at 1.4 x 10-6 ppm and sea water at2.4 x 10-31 ppm. All isotopes are radioactive with a half-life of 32,000 years.Protoactinium accumulates in mammalian bone after ingestion.Pb – Lead is found in igneous rocks at 12.5 ppm; shale at 20 ppm; sandstone at 7ppm; limestone at 9 ppm; soil at 10 ppm (higher in limestone soils and humus);fresh water at 0.005 ppm; sea water at 0.00008 ppm; marine plants at 8.4 ppm;land plants at 2.7 ppm (many plant species are adapted to Pb-rich soils andaccumulate Pb including Amorpha canescens); marine animals at 0.5 ppm (highestin fish bones); land animals at 2.0 ppm (highest levels found in bone, liver,and kidney).Lead has a biological function in all vertebrates including humans. Schrauzerstates that lead is a required cofactor for an enzyme (“leadzyme”) that is partof the duplication process of RNA.Children with cravings (pica) for non-food items (including paint, sand, dirt,etc.) are very susceptible to lead poisoning (plumbism). Infants and childrenwith pica (mineral deficiencies) will chew on their toys (e.g, three-year-oldNatale Hayhurst, from Terra Haute, IN reported on Good Morning America (March2011) that she ate light bulbs, diet coke cans, dirt, rocks, plastic toys, paperproducts, cardboard, shower curtain magnets, etc.)It is common that infants and children who are mineral deficient with clinicalpica will chew on their toys, cribs, window sills, caulking, furniture andpaint. A chip of lead paint the size of a penny can contain as much as 50 to 100ug of lead, consuming this amount of lead daily over three months will result inlead poisoning.The “normal” blood lead level is below 40 ug/dl. Children with blood lead levelsabove 60 to 80 ug/dl have symptoms of vomiting, irritability, weight loss,muscular weakness, headache, abdominal pain, insomnia, and anorexia. Childrenwith blood lead levels above 80 ug/dl show anemia, kidney damage, (Fanconisyndrome, and increased urinary loss of amino acids, glucose, and phosphorus),peripheral neuritis, ataxia and muscular incoordination, joint pain andencephalopathy (brain damage, learning disabilities, etc.) with eventual death.The approach to treating lead poisoning includes supplementing with 60 colloidalminerals (including Ca and Fe to eliminate pica and further ingestion of Pb),restoring fluid and electrolyte balance (especially K and P) and the use of IVor IM chelation using CaEDTA (calcium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) andBAL(British Anti-Lewisite) for a minimum of five days. It is not unusual for asmany as 25% of Pb poisoned individuals to have residual loss of IQ, loss ofcoordination, hyperactivity, learning disabilities, and impulsiveness.Pd – Palladium is found in igneous rocks at 0.01 ppm and land animals at 0.002ppm. Palladium accumulates in mammalian liver and kidney after ingestion.Combinations of vitamin B12 and palladium are employed for alternative cancertherapies.Pm – Promethium isotopes are all radioactive with a half-life of 2.6 years.Promethium is an important fission product that has entered the biosphere (priorto made-made nuclear explosions Pm did not exist in nature). Pm accumulates inmammalian bone and liver after ingestion.Po – Polonium is found in igneous rocks at 2 x 10-10 ppm.Pr – Praseodymium is a “light” rare earth element that is found in igneous rocksat 8.2 ppm; shale at 6 ppm; sandstone at 2.8 ppm; limestone at 1.4 ppm; marineplants at 5 ppm; land plants accumulates up to 46 ppm (Carya spp.); marineanimals at 0.5 ppm; land animals at 1.5 ppm (accumulates in mammalian bone andliver).Praseodymium enhances proliferation of normal cell growth and doubling of thelife span in laboratory species.Pt – Platinum is found in igneous rocks at 0.005 ppm and land animals at 0.002ppm.Pu – All plutonium isotopes are radioactive with a half-life of 24,000 years.Plutonium was released into the earth’s atmosphere by nuclear explosions. Marineplants concentrate Pu up to 4,000 times above the background level of sea water.Land plants record 0.4 to 2.2 disintegrations/sec/kg; land animals record 0.07to 6.8 disintegrations/sec/kg (Pu accumulates in bone after contact oringestion).Ra – Radium is found in igneous rocks at 9 x 10-7 ppm; shale at 11 x 10-7 ppm;sandstone at 7 x 10-7 ppm; limestone at 4 x 10-7 ppm; fresh water at 3.9 x 10-10ppm; sea water at 6 x 10-11 ppm; soils at 8 x 10-7 ppm; marine plants at 9 x10-8 ppm; land plants at ( ) x 10-9 ppm; marine animals at 0.7 to 15 x 10-9 ppm;land animals at 7 x 10-9 ppm (highest concentrations in mammalian bone); allisotopes of Ra are radioactive.Rb – Rubidium is found in igneous rocks at 90 ppm; shale at 140 ppm; sandstoneat 60 ppm; limestone at 3 ppm; fresh water at 0.0015 ppm; sea water at 0.12 ppm;soil at 100 ppm (fixed by clay soils); marine plants at 7.4 ppm; land plants at20 ppm; marine animals at 20 ppm; land animals at 17 ppm (highest levels inliver and muscle; lowest levels in bone).Rubidium can replace the electrolyte function of K in many species includingbacteria, algae, fungi and certain invertebrates (echinoderms – starfish).Re – Rhenium is found in igneous rocks at 0.005 ppm; marine plants at 0.014 ppm;marine animals at 0.0005 to 0.oo6 ppm; land animals accumulate Re in thyroidtissue.Rh – Rhodium is found in igneous rocks at 0.001 ppm.Rn – Radon is found in igneous rocks at 4 x 10-13 ppm; fresh water at 1.7 x10-15 ppm; sea water at 6 x 10-16 ppm; all isotopes of Rn are radioactive with ahalf-life of 54 seconds to 3.8 days; Rn gas is carcinogenic and highly toxicwhen inhaled. Radon is a common household hazard, it is odorless and colorless;detection requires the use of a kit that is generally available.Ru – Ruthenium is found in igneous rocks at 0.001 ppm; land plants at 0.005 ppm;land animals at 0.002 ppm (Ru04 is highly toxic to animals and humans).S – Sulfur is found in igneous rocks at 260 ppm; shale at 2,400 ppm; sandstoneat 240 ppm; limestone at 1,200 ppm; fresh water at 3.7 ppm; sea water at 885ppm; soils at 700 ppm (up to 90% of soil S is bound tightly to humus; SO4 is amajor exchange anion in many soils; occurs in soils near volcanoes liberatingSO2 and SO3); marine plants at 12,000 ppm (accumulates in red algae, Demarestiaspp.); land plants at 3,400 ppm (lower in most bryophytes and gymnosperms);marine animals at 5,000 to 19,000 ppm (highest in coelenterates and molluscs);land animals at 5,000 ppm (highest in cartilage, tendons, keratin, skin, nailsand hair and lowest in bones).Sulfur is an important structural atom in most proteins as sulfur amino acids(cystine, cysteine and methionine) and small organic molecules. Glutathione, atripeptide containing cysteine, is essential to cellular reactions involvingsulfur amino acids in protein. Sulfur is found in a reduced form (-SH) incysteine and in an oxidized form (-S-S-) as the double molecule, cysteine. This“sulfhydryl group” is important for the specific configuration of somestructural proteins and for the biological activities of some enzymes (proteinsthat do work).Sulfur containing proteins work in indirect ways to maintain life: * Hemoglobin * Hormones (insulin, adrenal cortical hormones) * Enzymes * AntibodiesSulfur also occurs in carbohydrates such as heparin, an anticoagulant that isconcentrated in the liver and other tissues; and chondroitin sulfate (cartilage,collagen, etc.). The vitamins thiamine (B1) and biotin have S bound in theirmolecule. The toxic properties of arsenic are the result of its ability tocombine with sulfhydryl groups.Deficiency of S results in degenerative types of arthritis involvingdegeneration of cartilage, ligaments, tendons, Systemic Lupus Erythematosis,Sickle cell anemia and various “collagen diseases.”Sb – Antimony is found in igneous rocks at 0.2 ppm; shale at 1.5 ppm; sandstoneat 0.05 ppm; limestone at 0.2 ppm; sea water at 0.00033 ppm; soil at 2 to 10ppm; land plants at 0.06 ppm; land animals at 0.006 ppm (concentrates inmammalian heart muscle).Antimony potassium tartrate (tartar emetic) is still used today as the preferredtreatment for blood flukes (schistosomiasis or Bilharziasis).Sc – Scandium is found in igneous rocks at 22 ppm; shale at 13 ppm; sandstoneand limestone at 1 ppm; sea water at 0.000004 ppm; soils at 7 ppm; land plantsat 0.008 ppm; land animals at 0.00006 ppm (concentrates in mammalian heart andbone).Se – Selenium is found in igneous rocks at 0.05 ppm; shale at 0.6 ppm; sandstoneat 0.05 ppm; limestone at 0.08 ppm; fresh water at 0.02 ppm; sea water at0.00009 ppm; soils 0.2 ppm (not universally distributed, vast areas of Earth aredeficient or even totally devoid of Se; Se is found in the humus of alkalinesoils when present); marine plants at 0.8 ppm; land plants at 0.2 ppm; landanimals at 1.7 ppm (highest concentrations found in liver, kidney, heart andskeletal muscle).Selenium is the most efficient antioxidant (anti-peroxident) and is found at thesubcellular level in the glutathione peroxidase enzyme system and “metallo”amino acids (selenomethionine, etc.). Selenium prevents cellular and subcellularlipids and fats from being peroxidized, which literally means it prevents bodyfats from going rancid (seen externally as “age spots” or “liver spots”). Thisbrowngold peroxidized lipid is known as ceroid lipofucsin.Selenium has been shown to “improve genome stability” And maintain teleomerefunction and length.Selenium also functions to protect cellular and organelle bi-lipidlayermembranes from oxidative damage. This type of lipid damage (known as ceroidlipofucsin) is seen through the standard light microscope is called “agepigment.” High intake of dietary polyunsaturated oils (such as olive oil,coconut oil, fish oil, etc.), salad dressings, margarine, and cooking oilsconcurrent with a selenium deficiency will increase the risk and rate of birthdefects (such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, etc.), arteriosclerosis,cardiomyopathy, sudden heart death, and cancer. The polyunsaturatedconfiguration of the oils when heated or treated with hydrogen (“trans fattyacids”) literally causes the rancidity (“free radical” damage) of cellularmembranes and intracellular fat.The clinical diseases associated with selenium deficiency are diverse and to theuninformed shrouded in mystery. Selenium deficiency is one of the more costlymineral deficiency complexes affecting embryos, the newborn, toddlers, teens,and adults alike.Selenium deficiency can result in infertility in both men and women. Congenitalselenium during pregnancy can result in a wide variety of problems ranging frommiscarriage, low birth weight, high infant mortality, Sudden Infant DeathSyndrome (“SIDS”), cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, livercirrhosis, cancer, etc.Selenium deficiency in growing children can result in crib death or SIDS (SuddenInfant Death Syndrome), slow growth, small size (failure to reach geneticpotential for size and mass), muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis (CF),scoliosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (muscular dystrophy of the heart muscle,a.k.a. Keshan Disease), anemia, liver cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, muscularweakness, lowered immune capacity, and neuromuscular diseases such as ALD(Adrenoleucodystrophy or “Lorenzo’s Oil” type syndromes).In young adults, selenium deficiency appears as anemia, chronic fatigue,Wilson’s syndrome (hypothyroidism), liver cirrhosis, muscular weakness, myalgia,muscle tenderness, fibromyalgia, lupus, pancreatitis, infertility, muscularselenium deficiency in adults appears especially common in young athletes suchas basketball players, football players and track stars at the high school,college, university, Olympic and professional levels, part of the anorexianervosa complex, MS (multiple sclerosis), Lou Gehrig’s Disease (ALS) and livercirrhosis, cancer and lowered immune capacity.Selenium deficiency in adults appears as reduced immune capacity, anemia,infertility, “age spots” or “liver spots”, myalgia, muscle weakness,fibromyalgia, lupus, MS (multiple sclerosis), ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease),Parkinson’s disease, dementia (Werniki-Korsakoff’s disease), irregular heartbeat (electrical conduction problems), cardiomyopathy, hypertrophy or thickeningof the heart ventricular walls, sudden heart death, liver cirrhosis,hypothyroidism, cataracts, and cancer.Selenium Deficiency Diseases:HIV (AIDS)Anemia (RBC fragility)Age Spots & Liver Spots–ceroid lipofucinFatigueMuscular weaknessMyalgia (Fibromyalgia, muscle pain and soreness)Rhabdomyalisis (breakdown of skeletal muscle cell walls following exercise)ScoliosisMuscular Dystrophy (MD, White Muscle Disease, Stiff Lamb Disease)Cystic FibrosisCardiomyopathy (Keshan Disease, “Mulberry heart” disease)Multiple sclerosis (MS)Blindness – cataracts, macular degenerationHeart palpitationsIrregular heart beatLiver cirrhosisPancreatitisPancreatic atrophyLou Gehrig’s disease (ALS)Parkinson’s DiseaseAlzheimer’s Disease (a physician caused disease associated with the use ofstatin drugs, low cholesterol intake and consumption of free radicals)Adrenoleucodystrophy (ALD – “Lorenzo’s Oil” Syndrome)InfertilityLow birth weightHigh infant mortalityMiscarriagesSudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)Cancer (reported in 1912)Clinical AIDS (HIV infection)Sickle-cell anemiaWilson’s Syndrome (hypothyroidism)Wallach in 1998 filed for and won an application for selenium claims from theFDA, including, “supplementation with selenium can reduce the risk of many typesof cancer,” and “supplementation with selenium can support the bodies ability tomanufacture anti-cancer substances.”In 2013 the FDA sent out an announcement that “encouraged” manufacturers ofinfant formulas to add selenium to their products. This brings the number ofminerals in infant formulas to 13 but where are the other 47?In a review of the anti-cancer effects of selenium, Schrauzer, Professoremeritus and head of the Department of Chemistry, UCSD stated:Selenium is increasingly recognized as a versatile anticarcinogenic agent. Itsprotective functions cannot be solely attributed to the action of glutathioneperoxidase. Instead, selenium appears to operate by several mechanisms,depending on dosage and chemical form of selenium and the nature of thecarcinogenic stress. In a major protective function, selenium is proposed toprevent the malignant transformation of cells by acting as a “redox switch” inthe activation-inactivation of cellular growth factors and other functionalproteins through the catalysis of oxidation-reduction reactions of critical –SHgroups or –S-S– bonds. The growth-modulatory effects of selenium are dependenton the levels of intracellular glutathione peroxidase and the oxygen supply. Ingeneral, growth inhibition is achieved by the Se-mediated stimulation ofcellular respiration (more oxygen and less cancer). Selenium appears to inhibitthe replication of tumor viruses and the activation of oncogenes by similarmechanisms, However, it may also alter carcinogen metabolism and protect DNAagainst carcinogen-induced damage.In additional functions of relevance to its anticarcinogenic activity, seleniumacts as an acceptor of biogenic methyl groups, and is involved in detoxificationof metals and certain xenobiotics. Selenium also has immunopotentiatingproperties. It is required for optimal macrophage and natural killer cellfunctions.The school of pharmacy from the University of Georgia released a report inaugust of 1994 that concludes: “A human selenium deficiency is related to theonset of full-blown AIDS in chronically infected HIV patients. According totheir report, HIV requires large amounts of selenium for replication and inselenium-deficient patients, the virus competes with the patient for limitedamounts of the essential mineral. The HIV patient actually dies ofselenium-deficiency encephalopathy, liver cirrhosis, or cardiomyopathy.Long-term HIV patients (20 years or more) that never developed full blownclinical AIDS had supplemented with relatively large amounts of selenium.”Si – Silica is found in igneous rocks at 281,500 ppm; shale at 73,000 ppm;sandstone at 368,000 ppm; limestone at 24,000 ppm; fresh water at 6.5 ppm; seawater at 3 ppm; soils at 330,000 ppm (found as SiO2, the most abundant form ofSi in nature, in silicates and clays); marine plants at 1,500 to 20,000 ppm;accumulated by diatoms, horsetail, ferns, Cyoeraceae, Graineae and Jucaceae andby flowers of Pappophorum silicosum; marine animals at 70,000 ppm; land animalsat 120 to 6,000 ppm (highest levels in hair, lungs and bone).Silica supplementation increases the collagen in growing bone by 100%. Tissuelevels of Si decrease with aging in unsupplemented humans and laboratoryspecies. Silica deficiency is characterized by dry brittle hair, brittle fingerand toe nails, poor skin quality, poor calcium utilization, and arterialdisease. High fiber diets contain significant amounts of Si which leads manyinvestigators to believe that Si helps to lower cholesterol. The recommended Siintake ranges from 200 to 500 mg/day for adults.Sm – Samarium is a “light” rare earth element found in igneous rocks at 6 ppm;shale at 5.6 ppm; sandstone at 2.7 ppm; limestone at 0.8 ppm; land plants at0.0055 ppm (accumulates up to 23 ppm); marine animals at 0.04 to 0.08 ppm; landanimals at 0.01 ppm in heart muscle and 0.0009 ppm in mammalian bone and liver.Samarium enhances normal cell proliferation and doubles the life span oflaboratory species.Sn – Tin is found in igneous rocks at 2 ppm; shale at 6 ppm; sandstone andlimestone at 0.5 ppm; fresh water at 0.00004 ppm; sea water at 0.003 ppm; soilsat 2 to 200 ppm (strongly absorbed by humus); marine plants at 1 ppm; landplants at 0.3 ppm (highest in bryophytes and lichens); marine animals at 0.2 to20 ppm; land animals at 0.15 ppm (highest levels are found in the lungs andintestines of vertebrates).Originally, the presence of Sn in tissue was attributed to environmentalcontamination; however, careful and detailed studies by Schwarz demonstratedthat Sn produced an acceleration of growth in rats and further met the standardsfor an essential trace element. As a member of the fourth main chemical group ofelements, Sn has many chemical and physical properties similar to those ofcarbon, silica, germanium, and lead.Rats fed Sn at 17.0 ng/gm show poor growth, reduced feed efficiency, hearingloss, and bilateral (male pattern) hair loss, while rats fed 1.99 ug/gm werephysiologically and anatomically normal; Sn was demonstrated to be an essentialelement by Schwarz in 1970. Tin has been shown to exert a strong inductioneffect on the enzyme heme oxygenase, enhancing heme breakdown in the kidney.There is also evidence for tin having cancer-prevention properties.A federal study released in November of 1991 showed that men in recentgenerations have poorer hearing at any given age than in men in earliergenerations and is generally thought to be the result of a Sn deficiency. Menover the age of 30 lose their hearing more than twice as fast as women of thesame age.Sr – Strontium is found in igneous rocks at 375 ppm; shale at 300 ppm; sandstoneat 20 ppm; limestone at 610 ppm; fresh water at 0.08 ppm; sea water at 8.1 ppm;soils at 300 ppm; marine plants at 260 to 1,400 ppm; land plants at 26 ppm;marine animals at 20 to 500 ppm; land animals at 14 ppm (highest in mammalianbone).Strontium can replace Ca in a Ca deficiency state in many organisms includingman.Deficiencies of Sr are associated with certain types of Ca and B resistantosteopenia, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, degenerative arthritis, bone on bonearthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.Strontium 90, the man made radioactive isotope product of fission atomicexplosions and the greatest biohazard fear during the “Cold War” does occurnaturally in nature.Ta – Tantalum is found in igneous rocks at 2 ppm; shale at 0.8 ppm; sandstoneand limestone at 0.05 ppm; sea water at 0.0000025 ppm; marine animals accumulateTa up to 410 ppm.Tb – Terbium is found in igneous rocks at 0.9 ppm; shale at 0.58 ppm; sandstoneat 0.41 ppm; limestone at 0.071 ppm; land plants at 0.0015 ppm; marine animalsat 0.006 to 0.01 ppm; land animals at 0.0004 ppm (accumulates in mammalianbone).Tc – All isotopes of technetium are radioactive and not known to occur naturallyin nature. Technetium is poorly absorbed by mammals.Te – Tellurium is found in igneous rocks at 0.001 ppm; land plants at 2 to 25ppm and land animals at 0.02 ppm.Th – Thorium is found in igneous rocks at 9 to 6 ppm; shale at 12 ppm; sandstoneand limestone at 1 to 7 ppm; soils at 5 ppm; marine animals at 0.003 to 0.03ppm; and land animals at 0.003 to 0.1 ppm.Ti – Titanium is found in igneous rocks at 5,700 ppm; shale at 4,600 ppm;sandstone at 1,500 ppm; sea water at 0.001 ppm; soils at 5,000 ppm; marineplants at 12 to 80 ppm (accumulates in plankton); land plants at 1 ppm; marineanimals at 0.2 to 20 ppm; and land animals at 0.2 ppm.Tl – Thallium is found in igneous rocks at 0.45 ppm; shale at 1.4 ppm; sandstoneat 0.82 ppm; limestone at 0.05 ppm; sea water at 0.00001 ppm; soils at 0.1 ppm;land animals at 0.4 ppm (accumulates in the mammalian kidney and under certaincircumstances can be highly toxic to mammals including man).Tm – Thulium is a “heavy” rare earth and is found in igneous rocks at 0.48 ppm;shale at 0.28 ppm; sandstone at 0.3 ppm; limestone at 0.065 ppm; land plants at0.0015 ppm; and land animals at 0.00004 ppm.Thulium supplementation enhances the growth of normal cells and has doubled thelifespans of laboratory species.U – Uranium is found in igneous rocks at 2.7 ppm; shale at 3.7 ppm; sandstone at0.95 ppm; limestone at 2.2 ppm; fresh water at 0.001 ppm; sea water at 0.003ppm; soil at 1 ppm (absorbed by humus, especially in alkaline soils); landplants at 0.038 ppm (Astragalus spp. is an accumulator plant); marine animals at0.004 to 3.2 ppm; land animals at 0.013 ppm; all natural isotopes of U are alphaemiters and may also decay by fission. Uranium is accumulated by mammaliankidney and bone after ingestion.V – Vanadium is found in igneous rocks at 135 ppm; shale at 130 ppm; sandstoneat 20 ppm; limestone at 20 ppm; fresh water at 0.001 ppm; seater at 0.002 ppm;soils at 100 ppm (V is absorbed by humus, especially in alkaline soils); marineplants at 2 ppm; land plants at 1.6 ppm (accumulated by the fungus Arnanitamuscaria); marine animals at 0.14 to 2 ppm; land animals at 0.15 ppm.Metallic V (vanadyl sulfate) is absorbed from the intestinal tract very poorlyat levels of 0.1 to 1.0%; V chelates at 40% and plant derived colloids at up to98%.Vanadium was proven to be an essential trace mineral in 1971. Vanadiumstimulates glucose (blood sugar) oxidation and transport in fat cells andglycogen (animal starch) synthesis in liver and muscle and inhibits livergluconeogenesis (production of glucose from fat) and absorption of glucose fromthe gut. Vanadium enhances the stimulating effect of insulin on DNA synthesis.Despite low serum insulin, the blood glucose levels of diabetic rats fed V, wasthe same as normal controls.Vanadium appears to function like insulin by altering cell membrane function forion transport processes. Therefore, V has a very beneficial effect, particularlyin humans with glucose-tolerance problems (affecting hypoglycemia, reactivehypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and type 1 and type 2 diabetes) by making thecell membrane insulin receptors more sensitive to insulin.Several cultures, including American Indians, Canadian Indians, Hispanics,African Americans, and Hawaiians have an increased rate of diabetes when theycease to eat their ethnic foods and turn to eating canned, processed, andfast-foods, leading to the false theory that diabetes is agenetically-transmitted disease. Vanadium supplementation can have a majorpositive economic impact by reducing or even eliminating most cases of adultonset type 2 diabetes. Diabetes alone costs American taxpayers $105 billion eachyear.Vanadium inhibits cholesterol synthesis in animals and humans and is associatedwith a decreased plasma level of cholesterol and reduced aortic deposits ofcholesterol.Vanadium initiates an increase in the contractile force of heart muscle known asthe “inotrophic effect.”Vanadium has known anticarcinogenic properties. Induction of mouse mammary tumorgrowth was blocked by feeding 25 ug/gm of diet. The vanadium supplement reducedtumor incidence, average tumor count per animal and prolonged median cancer freetime without inhibiting overall growth or health of the animals (sure beats theresults and untoward side effects of chemotherapy and radiation!).Diseases Associated with a Clinical Deficiency of VanadiumSlow growthIncreased infant mortalityInfertilityElevated cholesterol (above 300)Elevated triglycerides (above 125)HypoglycemiaHyperinsulinemiaType 2 diabetesCardiovascular diseaseObesityW – Tungsten is found in igneous rocks at 1.5 ppm; shale at 1.8 ppm; sandstoneat 1.6 ppm; limestone at 0.6 ppm; sea water at 0.0001 ppm; soils at 1 ppm;marine plants at 0.035 ppm; marine animals at 0.0005 to 0.05 ppm; land animalsat 0.005 ppm (accumulates in heart muscle and teeth at 0.00025 ppm).Xe – Xenon is found in igneous rocks at 0.00003 ppm; sea water at 0.000052 ppm.Xenon binds to mammalian hemoglobin and myoglobin which produces an anestheticeffect.Y – Yttrium is a “heavy” rare earth element found in igneous rocks at 33 ppm;shale at 18 ppm; sandstone at 9.1 ppm; limestone at 4.3 ppm; sea water at 0.0003ppm; soils at 50 ppm; land plants at 0.6 ppm (accumulates in ferns); marinemammals at 0.1 to 0.2 ppm; land animals at 0.04 ppm (found in mammalian bone,teeth and liver).Yttrium enhances normal cell growth and doubles the life span of laboratoryspecies. Exposure of pregnant mice to Y leads to a rapid placental transfer; 14%of ingested Y can be detected in newborn mice.Yb – Ytterbium is a rare earth element found in igneous rocks at 3 ppm; shale at1.8 ppm; sandstone at 1.3 ppm; limestone at 0.43 ppm; land plants at 0.0015 ppm;marine animals at 0.02 ppm; land animals at 0.00012 ppm (accumulates up to 1.3ppm in bone, teeth and liver).Exposure of Yb to pregnant mice produces a rapid placental transfer; 14% of theingested Yb can be detected in the newborn mice.Zn – Zinc is found in igneous rocks at 70 ppm; shale at 95 ppm; sandstone at 16ppm; limestone at 20 ppm fresh water at 0.01 ppm; sea water at 0.01 ppm; soilsat 50 ppm; marine plants at 150 ppm; land plants at 100 ppm; marine animals at 6to 1,500 ppm; land animals at 160 ppm (accumulates in mammalian kidney, prostateand eye).Zinc was known to be an essential nutrient for bread mold 125 years ago, to beessential for rats 70 years ago, and essential for humans 40 years ago. Zincdeficiency produces a wide range of clinical diseases including birth defectsand degenerative diseases of all age groups.Congenital Birth Defects Associated with Zinc Deficiency:Down’s syndromeCleft lipCleft palateBrain defect (dorsal herniation, hydroencephaloceol, cerebral palsy, etc.)Micro or anophthalmia (small or absent eyes)Micro or agnathia jaw structureSpina bifidaClubbed limbsSyndactyly (webbed fingers and toes)Missing limbs and digitsDiaphragmatic hernia (hiatal hernia)Umbilical hernias (gastroschisis)Heart defectsLung defectsUrogenital defectsZinc-Deficiency Diseases and Symptoms:Pica (geophagia, pagophagia, wool eating, hair eating, fingernail eating, etc.)Loss of sense of smellLoss of sense of tasteInfertilityMiscarriageBirth defectsFailure of wounds and ulcers to healImmune system status failurePoor growth (short stature)High rate of infant mortalityHypogonadism (small low functioning testes and ovaries)Perpetual prepuberty stateAnemiaAlopecia (hair loss)Acrodermatitis enteropathica (gluten intolerance, parakeratosis, celiac disease)Frizzy hairDiarrhea (secondary to gluten intolerance)DepressionParanoiaOral and peri-oral dermatitisWeight loss (anorexia nervosa, bullemia, gluten intolerance)Benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH, prostate enlargement, etc.)Severe body odor (“stinky tennis shoe” syndrome, etc.)There is 1.4 to 2.3 grams of Zn in the adult human. The liver, pancreas, kidney,bone and skeletal muscle have the greatest needs and reserves of Zn, lesseramounts are found in the eye, prostate gland, semen, skin, hair, finger nailsand toe nails.There are no less than 70 metalloenzymes that require Zn as a cofactor tofunction properly. These include carbonic anhydrase, alkaline phosphatase,lactic dehydrogenase, and carboxypeptidase. Zinc helps to bind enzymes tosubstrates by maintaining special and configurational relationships. Someenzymes bind Zn so tightly that even during severe Zn depletion they can stillfunction. Zinc participates in the metabolism of nucleic acids and the synthesisof proteins; Zn is also an integral part of the RNA molecule (Zinc “metallicfingers”) and participates in cell division and synthesis of DNA. TheDNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a Zn-dependent enzyme, as is thymidine kinase.Excesses of Cu and Fe and high-phytate diets (common to vegans) will reduce theavailability of dietary Zn. Heavy losses of Zn occurs in sweat; therefore,unsupplemented athletes and those individuals performing heavy labor areparticularly at risk for Zn deficiency (causing anorexia nervosa, muscleweakness, pica, birth defects in females, etc.).Zr – Zirconium is found in igneous rocks at 165 ppm; shale at 160 ppm; sandstoneat 220 ppm; limestone at 19 ppm; fresh water at 0.0026 ppm; sea water at0.000022 ppm; soils at 300 ppm; marine plants at 20 ppm; land plants at 0.64ppm; marine animals at 0.1 to 1.0 ppm; and land animals at 0.3 ppm."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINTEENSURVIVAL OF SPECIESTeach your children what we taught our children. The earth does not belong tous; we belong to the earth. All things are connected like the blood which unitesone family. Mankind did not weave the web of life. We are but one strand withinit. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are boundtogether.—Chief SeattleFrom a speech on the environment in 1854, attributed to the patriarch ofDuwarnish and Suquamish Indians of Puget SoundAlbert Schweitzer was a musician, philosopher, theologian, physician, and anexample of a polymath. In 1912, using his own money, he established a clinic inLambarene, Gabon, in Western Africa. Within nine months more than two thousandnatives had come to see him. Schweitzer gave them quinine for malaria, digitalisfor (congestive) heart disease, and salvarsan—the first antibiotic—for syphilis.When patients came to him with strangulated hernias or abdominal tumors, heanesthetized them with chloroform (performed surgery) and treated their painwith morphine. Albert Schweitzer brought modern medicine to a small part ofAfrica.Toward the end of both of their lives, Norman Cousins, author of Anatomy of anIllness, met Albert Schweitzer. “At the dinner table of the Schweitzer Hospitalat Lambarene,” wrote Cousins, “I had ventured the remark that the local peoplewere lucky to have access to the Schweitzer clinic instead of having to dependon witch-doctor supernaturalism. Dr. Schweitzer asked me how much I knew aboutwitch doctors. I was trapped by my ignorance. The next day the great doctor tookme to a nearby jungle clearing where he introduced me to an elderly witchdoctor.”“For the next two hours, we stood off to one side and watched,” recalledCousins. “With some patients, the witch doctor merely put herbs in a brown paperbag and instructed the ill person in their use. With other patients, he gave noherbs but filled the air with incantations. A third category of patients hemerely spoke in a subdued voice and pointed to Dr. Schweitzer.” On the way back,Schweitzer interpreted what they had seen. The first group of patients had minorillnesses that would resolve on their on or for which modern medicine offeredlittle. The second group had psychological problems treated with “Africanpsychotherapy.” The third had massive hernias or extrauterine pregnancies ordislocated shoulders or tumors—diseases (or trauma that) the witch doctorcouldn’t treat—so he directed them to Dr. Schweitzer.Schweitzer described the value of the witch doctor. “The witch doctor succeedsfor the same reason the rest of us succeed,” he said. ‘Each patient carries hisown doctor inside him. They come to us not knowing the truth. We are at our bestwhen we give the doctor who resides within each patient a chance to go to work.—Paul A. OffitDo You Believe in Magic?By the 1600s it had been known for 1,400 years that blood was “created in theliver, moved outward from the heart toward the extremities, and, in nourishingthe tissues, just disappeared there. The heart was also the source of some sortof vital spirit, which in some mysterious way had to do with the blood.”In 1628 British physician and anatomist Dr. William Harvey announced hisdiscovery of the circulation of the blood, and further reported that the heartwas a simple pump that circulated the blood around the body in some form ofclosed circuit.Harvey laid out his observations of blood circulation in 80 species of animalsin a painstakingly detailed 72-page book written in Latin and titled ExercitatioAnatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalbus, which is often shortened toDe Motu Cordis (on the motion of the heart), or DMC. In his book Harvey noted“(I) pleased some more, others less; some chid and calumniated me and laid to meas a crime that I had dared to depart from the precepts and opinions of allanatomists . . . What remains to be said upon the quantity and source of theblood . . . is of a character so novel and unheard of that I not only fearinjury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind atlarge for my enemies.”Three book-length criticisms were soon lodged against Harvey, the first in 1630,which was published by a Dr. James Primrose, an English provincial physician andprolific writer. Primrose’s book, with a title longer than Harvey’s (that endedin adversus Guilielmum Harveum) was a “collection of misreadings,misunderstandings, and misstatements” that were easily recognized by a casualreader.Robert Willis, the translator of DMC wrote in 1878 that Primrose’s book was fullof “obstinate denials, sometimes of what may be called perversions of statementsinvolving matters of fact, and in its whole course appeals not once toexperiment as a means of investigation” to resolve the controversy.Primrose wrote, “Thou has observed a sort of pulsatile heart in slugs, flies,bees, and even in squill-fish (a species of shrimp). We congratulate thee uponthy zeal. May God preserve thee in such perspicacious ways . . . Those who markin thy writings the names of so many and diverse animals will take thee for thesovereign investigator of nature and will believe thee to be an oracle seatedupon the tripod . . . I speak of those who are not physicians and have asmattering of the science. But if we read the works of real anatomists, such asGalen, Vesalius, the illustrious Fabricius and Casserius, we see that they haveprovided us with engraved plates representing the animals they have dissected.As for Aristotle, he made observations of all things and no one should darecontest his conclusions.”Because of a lack of appropriate technology, Harvey struggled with the questionregarding the theorized and unseen connections between the arteries and veins.Four years after Harvey’s death, Marcello Mallpighi, an Italian physiologist wasable (with an improved microscope and special stains) to demonstrate thatarterial blood does not simply “leak into the tissues, to be collected somehowby the veins,” as was commonly believed. His microscopic studies demonstratedvery clearly that there were “capillaries” and that these tiny blood vesselsthat were of such a small diameter that they could only accept one red bloodcell at a time, and in fact they connected the arterial blood stream to theveinous blood stream. Robert Willis stated,“The circuit was, finally, complete,and Harvey could rest in peace.”During the medieval times, physicians had only a limited number of ways to asseswhat was happening inside of the living patient. Medical laboratories were notyet commercially available, so they were limited to their senses andobservations to arrive at a diagnosis. One generally used technique was thevisual and taste examination of a patient’s urine. Doctors who examined urinewere affectionately referred to as “piss-prophets.”Piss-prophets recorded the color and taste of the urine (i.e., the sweet tasteindicated diabetes; ammonia odor indicated liver disease; clear colorless urineindicated malabsorption, etc.). In many cases the physician would have thepatient or servant taste the patients urine.Physicians additionally listened to and attempted to translate the sounds (suchas thumping, wheezing, whistling, and crackling, etc.) that were generatedinside the belly and chest cavities.In 1761 Dr. Leopold Auenbrugger, a German physician, proposed a method toconvert the passive listening technique into a proactive technique. His theorywas to tap or percuss the patient’s chest and belly and interpret the echo.Auenbrugger was able to record and list his interpretation of these percussionechoes: a dull sound indicated chest congestion, and the duller the returnsound, the more severe was the state of the congestion. Auenbrugger knew he hadmade a significant landmark improvement in the diagnostic techniques for themedical practitioner, although he had no thoughts of becoming a legend ormedical hero: “In making public my discoveries, I have not been unconscious ofthe dangers I must encounter, since it has always been the fate of those whohave illustrated or improved the arts and sciences by their discoveries to bebeset by envy, malice, hatrid, destruction and calumny.”Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, who was from what is now the city of Budapest,initiated his medical studies in the medical of Vienna, but he was treated badlyby fellow students, so he returned home to finish his training. The environmentof primitive facilities and poorly-skilled professors at the University of Pestcaused Semmelweis to return to Vienna to complete his studies.In 1846, by the time Semmelweis turned 28, he was engaged as an assistant to thedirector of the First Obstetrical Clinic at Vienna’s Allgemeines Krankenhaus(General Hospital). This was a major teaching hospital in “the mostforward-looking city in Europe, and it featured the largest lying-in clinic inthe world.”There was an extremely high death rate (13 to 30%) recorded in the women givingbirth in the clinic. High death rates were not unusual in European lying-inclinics, and for three years, beginning in 1773, disease ravaged the lying-inhospitals of Europe, reaching a peak in the Lombardy region of northern Italywhere “for an entire year, not one woman survived after giving birth in such ahospital.”The cause was nearly always “puerperal fever” (also called childbed fever), aferocious infection that blazed up in the mother’s body of the newly-deliveredinfant and raged through it like a wildfire, killing within days or even hours.Physicians theorized that childbed fever was caused by overcrowding, noxious air(“miasma”), an epidemic disease, or “cosmic emanations.”In the Second Obstetrical Clinic, another obstetrical wing of the same hospital,the death rate was only two percent. The first clinic was functioning as ateaching hospital for medical students and the second was a teaching hospitalfor midwives. Semmelweis noted that pregnant women who had mistakenly beenadmitted to the First Clinic, would drop to their knees and beg to betransferred to the Second Clinic and be delivered by midwives. Physiciansregarded the staggering death rate in the First Clinic an “intellectualexercise.” One hardened professor wrote, “The physician should be judged by theextent of his knowledge and not by the number of his cures. It is theinvestigator, not the healer, that is to be appreciated in the physician.”The hospital originally opened in 1794. Medical students did not perform theirown autopsies and dissections until 1822. It was soon after the awarding ofthese dissection privileges that the gruesome death rate began. Semmelweis beganto suspect that cleanliness, or the lack of it, was related to childbed fever.Between 1742 and 1758 Sir John Pringle, physician-general to the British army,published papers on antisepsis, infection, putrefaction, fever, and contagion,which he forwarded to the Royal Society. In 1752 he actively promoted the“gospel of cleanliness” in his Observations on the Diseases of the Army. Medicalhistorian Roy Porter, noted that, while Pringle’s writings were not original,they “captured the Enlightenment concern for hygiene, public health and thevalue of life.”In 1843 Oliver Wendell Holmes, an American jurist, physician, and writerproposed that infection was the etiology of childbed fever. He described how theinfection was “being carried by attendants from bed to bed as rat killers carrytheir poison from one house to another.”Semmelweis finally came out and said it, “The hands of the students and thefaculty went from the innards of a postulant corpse almost directly into awoman’s lacerated uterus—the raw surfaces left in the mother’s uterus after herchild is delivered.”In 1858 Semmelweis had his first scientific article published, The Etiology ofChildbed Fevers, which appeared in a Hungarian medical journal. In 1860-61,Semmelweis, published his “magnum opus” The Etiology, the Concept and theProphylaxis of Childbed Fever.In Great Feuds in Medicine, Hal Hellman wrote, “By the middle of 1862,Semmelweis began having what would be described as clinical depressionalternating with moments of elation—while he was still able to carry out hisresponsbilities, he had obvious pre-senile dementia and moments of bizarrebehavior.”In his last weeks of life, “Semmelweis was tricked into going to a Vienneseasylum by being told that he was being taken to visit the laboratory of his oldfriend Ferdinand von Hebra. The three physicians who signed the involuntarycommitment papers (required by law) were not trained as psychiatrists, and therewere no records showing that they consulted a psychiatrist; there was no recordto show that a priest had been requested to administer the final rites andsacraments; and the autopsy record noted major traumatic injuries to the headand body that could only have been sustained during a fatal beating—Semmelweiswas dead at age 47.”Claude Bernard was born on July 12, 1813, in the village of Saint-Julien, in thewine growing region of Beaujolais. As a teenager his family apprenticed him outto a pharmacist as his family could no longer afford to pay for his schooling.After failed attempts at play writing, Saint-Marc Girardin, a literary critic,suggested that considering Bernard’s pharmacy experience, he should consider thestudy of medicine. By 1839 Bernard was interning at the Paris municipal hospitalwhere he published a large and beautifully illustrated volume on operativesurgery in collaboration with a colleague, M. Huette.Barnard’s deeper interest leaned towards anatomy and physiology, anatomy being ascience that was well-advanced, well-illustrated, and well-respected; however,the science of physiology was a strange mix of theory, myth, and fewexperimental facts. Physicians would deduce the functioning of a tissue or organfrom its anatomy without experiment. For example, oxygen, which had beendiscovered a century earlier, was known to be a required factor for combustion,and because it was inhaled into the lungs, early physiologist believed that thelungs were the place that sugar is burned to produce heat and energy. It tookyears of experimentation and publication for Barnard to switch from the supportof the theory to showing that energy was produced in all tissues. E. J. Georget,a French physiologist was moved to say, “Nutrition was not a function because itlacks a specific organ (system).”Vitalism remained a catch-all for the explanations of the functions of lifeitself, any physiological event that was not understood was held up as anexample of the “vital force” which allowed the question to go unanswered.From 1841 to 1844, Bernard was responsible for the duties of preparateur forFrancois Magendie, who was performing vivisection experiments in the medicalschool of the College de France. Bernard noted, “So soon as an experimentalphysiologist was discovered he was denounced; he was given over to thereproaches of his neighbors and subjected to annoyances by the police.” Theweight of the antivivisection opposition to live animal research plagued Bernardfor his entire life—it even impacted his married life. Between 1844 and 1847,Bernard was introduced to and married Marie Francois Martin, the daughter of aParisian physician, who came along with a dowry which enabled Bernard tocontinue his research. However, this pursuit left him little to live on.Unfortunately, his wife “was not prepared, as he was, to live on narrow means,in order that the world might be richer. The life of a prosperous physician’swife would have been much more to her taste.” To complicate matters, MadameBernard and one of their daughters spent a considerable portion of their timeand funds in antivivisection activities.Bernard’s research included studies of the physiology of the nervous system, thecerebrospinal fluid, and the location of oxidation in mammals, which led to theunderstanding of tissue respiration and metabolism and the physiology ofdigestion. He has been credited with being the first researcher to performcardiac catheterization to extract samples of blood from a specific vein (theinferior vena cava) by inserting a tube via the jugular vein in the neck andthrough the heart into the vena cava.Bernard is also credited with being the first to keep an organ alive separatedfrom the body by feeding it with needed substances. This is now a commonlyemployed technique termed “perfusion.”Bernard studied the physiological effects of curare, carbon monoxide, opium,strychnine, and anesthetics. These chemicals were used to study the functions ofenzymes and nerves. Through these studies Bernard coined the theory of “internalenvironment,” as a state in which “all vital mechanisms, however varied they maybe, have only one object, that of preserving constant the conditions of life inthe internal environment.” This revelation led the eminent Scottish physiologistJ. S. Haldane to remark about Bernard’s words, saying, “No more pregnantsentence was ever framed by a physiologist.”Bernard’s theory of internal environment had far-reaching consequences. In 1929it led an American, Walter Cannon, to develop the theory of “homeostasis,” thephysiological process that maintains the body’s systems in balance in spite ofwide fluctuations in both the internal and external environment.Bernard proposed two theories to support his internal environment concept. Oneis that “internal secretions” or hormones, which are produced by the ductlessglands (pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, testes, ovaries, islets of Langerhans,etc.). The second was about the nerve control over blood flow.Wallach was a member of the National Science Foundation site visit committee andcoauthor of the 1968 Animal Welfare Act that provides for the humane protectionand handling of all laboratory, farm, and pet animals, which includes properspace, diet, and care for them, and required the presence of a properly trainedveterinarian to be the director of all medical animal research facilities toprevent repeats of past abuses.Prior to the mid-1880s, no physician had ever cured a disease, causing themedical profession to be held in low esteem, and which produced searing jokesand nasty comments. The periodical Judge stated at that time, “It is to thecredit of the intelligence of the medical profession that they do not often makethe mistake of taking their own medicines.” A month later, in another issue ofJudge, it was said that, “Five times as many ambitious women take to medicine asto law. This contradicts that generally-received idea of the sex that theydelight in scandals and qurrels, but abhor cruelty and killing.”The public was clamoring for help with their personal health problems becausethe official medical system had failed them. This environment attracted “patentmedicines,” some of which were simply a home brew in a bottle with a “Dr. FeelGood” type of label and were sold off the tailgate of wagons. Others were oldfamily recipes that worked, such as that produced by Lydia Pinkums called “LydiaPinkums’ Vegetable and Herbal Extract for Women’s Complaints,” which wasmarketed in newspapers for PMS, dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, menopausal symptoms,and infertility.Pinkums was a Quaker missionary and had used an ancient Native American herbalrecipe as the basis of her patent medicine that was sold through newspaper andmagazine adds. This herbal product worked so well the Harvard Glee Club sangsongs of her abilities to solve the problems of American women and she became anAmerican icon.During this same period the press was on the constant look out for excitingheadlines to sell newspapers. They would embellish health treatment stories thatseemed to work (especially if the huckster would slip the reporter or editor a$20 gold piece). Then there were stories about treatments for serious lifethreatening diseases that actually worked, such as for the disease of rabies.The bite of a rabid animal was of great concern. Once the victim began showingsigns of the disease, the inevitable litany of horrible symptoms and death wasas predictable as gravity. Until Pasteur’s treatment came along, the primitiveattempts at a cure included the “firing” of the bite wound with a red-hot poker,which was a traditional medical approach to treating open wounds and to stopbleeding. Sometimes, by dumb luck, the victim survived the bite and thecauterizing treatment, and sometimes they didn’t, and the patient died of theshock of the treatment and/or the ugly and painful symptoms of rabies.Pasteur’s new rabies treatment brought hope to people all over the world, evenin the remote areas of America where people were illiterate. Others would readthe breaking news out loud in the church or the town square, shouting “EXTRA!EXTRA!” And newspapers sold “like hotcakes.”Doctors were looked at differently as a result. The community excitement overthe successful rabies treatment and the news coverage was so “in your face” thatsurviving patients became heroes too. Four young children of an American workingclass family were sent to Paris on a clipper ship after being horribly bittenmultiple times by a rabid dog.The newspapers, both in America and Europe, reported the ongoing saga. The boys’photographs and names were in bold print on the front page. Thousands ofstraining listeners in America followed the story, and when the boys returnedhome, thousands flocked to attend performances to hear the boys tell their tale.Equally as amazing as the story that the boys had lived was that the nameshouted out as the conquering hero was not a physician. The name of the man wasLouis Pasteur who was a wine chemist! Pasteur had already captured theimagination of the academic world and the general public for his work infermentation and for his destroying the old theory of “spontaneous generation”as the cause of disease by replacing it with the “germ theory” thatmicroorganisms caused disease—not bad air. Pasteur was trained in basicchemistry, crystalography, and was known in the commercial world for saving thewine, beer, milk, and silk industries through a shelf-life process named afterhim called “Pasteurization.” He was also known throughout the livestock industryfor developing vaccines for the prevention of chicken cholera and anthrax, whichhad nearly destroyed the French poultry and cattle industries.Pasteur’s wildly successful treatment for rabies was not the first to useinoculation. Edward Jenner, using techniques that he had learned from milk maidsand slaves, was able to prevent small pox. This was prevention, not a cure, andpeople began yelling for a cure for all infectious diseases including typhus,typhoid fever, pneumonia, plague, cholera, diphtheria, and syphilis—a medicalrevolution against infectious disease had begun in earnest!One of Pasteur’s biographers referred to him as “the most perfect man who hasever entered the kingdom of science . . . within the limits of humanity,well-nigh perfect.” The Encyclopedia Americana even today states: “His discoverythat most familiar diseases are caused by germs is the most important in medicalhistory and one of the main foundations of modern medicine.” More than 100research institutions are named for him.Geison, a revisionist historian at Princeton University said: “In controversy,(Pasteur’s) combative self-assurance could be devastating to the point ofcruelty. He so offended an opponent, an eighty-year-old surgeon, that the latteractually challenged him to a duel—which, happily for both, never took place.”Due to this “combustible combination,” Pasteur’s wide range of interests andabilities, contentious personality, and complete faith in his abilities, hefound himself embroiled in philosophical wars on many fronts. Some were quiteserious, and like Bernard he faced the combined mighty armies of chemists,physicians, naturalists, and antivivisectionists.During one speech, Pasteur had asked, “Where . . . will you find a young manwhose curiosity and interest will not immediately be aroused when you put intohis hands a potato, when with that potato he may produce sugar, with that sugaralcohol, with that alcohol ether and vinegar?”Pasteur was describing the process of fermentation, which proved to be a pivotalmoment in his career. When one understands the importance of bread and winethroughout human history it is seen that both require passage through theprocess of fermentation. Throughout time bakers, winemakers, and brewers hadmade their livings from fermentation, but did not actually understand what washappening. The prevailing theory even up until the mid-19th century was that theprocess of fermentation was the result of an inanimate chemical reaction.Pasteur’s investigations of yeast and bacteria provided the first complete andcorrect insight that fermentation was produced by the activities of livingorganisms.Baron Justus von Liebig, “an arrogant, influential German chemist with aworldwide following and impeccable reputation,” compared Pasteur’s biologicaltheory of fermentation and putrefaction to “the opinion of a child who imaginedthat the rapid current of the Rhine depended on the movement of the many wheelson the mills on the Main River, which sent the waters towards the city ofBingen.” Liebig was so stubborn and arrogant that he even refused to look into amicroscope to view living microorganisms.In the late 1870s, a famous physician was speaking on the subject of childbedfever at the Academy of Medicine in Paris as he utilized formidable volumes ofGreek and Latin terminology to explain the cause of childbed fever as ametabolic disorder. Abruptly, from the rear of the lecture hall came, “The thingthat kills women with childbed fever—it isn’t anything like that! It is youdoctors who carry deadly microbes from sick women to healthy ones.” The shoutcame from Pasteur and once again he was up to his neck in controversy and atodds with a thousands year old theory!Victor Robinson noted, “As severe as been the criticisms of Pasteur bynaturalists and chemists, it was nothing compared with the enmity which greetedhim when he came among the doctors . . . When Pasteur presented facts, theiranswer was: Monsieur, where is your MD?”image [../images/00003.jpeg]With his writing of The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin (a polymath) foreverchanged our concept of the world’s creation and its evolution.Never has a scientist been so favored by fortune. Darwin came from a line ofgifted intellectuals, with great wealth on both sides of his family. He went tothe best schools but was a mediocre student. Though he struggled with studies inmedicine, and later in his studies to prepare for the ministry that his fatherinsisted on, Darwin was rescued by a professor’s recommendation that he serve asthe scientist on the HMS Beagle.He set off on the five-year voyage, and by the time they reached the GalapagosIslands, he wrote that “we seem to be brought near the great fact—the mysteriesof mysteries—the first appearance of new beings on this earth.”Yet Darwin kept postponing publication of his groundbreaking theory because hefeared society’s—and his wife’s—disapproval. Only when Darwin realized thatanother eminent scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was pursuing similar ideas andwas about to publish them did Darwin race to produce a popular treatment of thetheory.Paul Johnson, Darwin’s biographer, stated in his book Darwin: Portrait of aGenius, “In what we have seen to be a remarkably lucky life, this was thegreatest stroke of good fortune he enjoyed. The Origin of Species sealedDarwin’s fate as the discoverer of the theory.”The physical crystalline structure of proteins had been mapped out by LinusPauling just before Rosalind Franklin was hired at King’s College, London in1951. The brief period leading up to the announcement of the double helix shouldhave been a race between two scholarly teams: Watson and Crick from theBiophysics Unit of Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge, England, and Wilkins andFranklin at King’s College, London.Had Wilkins and Franklin been able to get along and collaborate they would havegone down in history as the discoverers of the double helix. The physicalchemist and the physicist had both entered the strange new world of biophysics.The scientific question of the day was “. . . proteins seem to do so many thingsin the body; could they also be the carrier of heredity? Some scientists thoughtso. Others suspected the real carrier was a different chemical substance alsofound in cells: deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.”Pauling had reported that the strength of protein molecules was related to a“helical spine” consisting of alternating phosphates and sugars, which supporteda series of small molecules referred to as “bases.” It was these bases that madeproteins so reactive and gave them the ability to transmit information. Paulingposited that DNA was a triple helix, however one could not see the structurewith a light microscope or even an electron microscope, as the structure was toosmall and too fragile to survive the preparation process.Pasteur’s early research with crystals “demonstrated a connection between thecrystalline structure of a molecule and the chemistry of a biological molecule.”At the turn of the 20th century, Sir William Henry Bragg, using the fact thatX-rays have a considerably shorter wave length than visible light, created amethod to employ the regular anatomy of atoms in crystalline molecules todiffract X-ray beams. The process produced a distinctive “finger print” of eachindividual molecule on a film plate. Bragg’s son, William Lawrence Bragg,cooperated with and supported his father’s research and the two men ultimatelyshared the 1915 Nobel Prize in physics.Wilkins had previously done some basic research on crystallography as anundergraduate; however his primary interests were those of a physicist and hiswork encompassed the tobacco mosaic virus that required some X-ray studies. Atthe same time, Franklin was invited to King’s to set up an X-ray diffractionlaboratory to study DNA. Franklin was told in writing that, “. . . as far as theexperimental X-ray effort is concerned, there will be at the moment onlyyourself and Raymond Gosling and a graduate student from Syracuse” and from thatmoment she believed that the project was hers.In the fall of 1951 Franklin was producing streams of X-ray defraction data, atthe same time that Wilkins returned with several DNA samples he had acquired inNew York. One of the plates produced by Franklin from these DNA samples showedthat DNA was a helical structure. When Wilkins looked at Franklin’s plates andnoted verbally that it showed that DNA was a helical structure, Franklin,according to historian Robert Olby, “snapped at Wilkins, and (retorted) with . .. Don’t interpret my data for me!” Little came immediately from Franklin’s data,but it was to become the seed of discovery for Watson and Crick one and a halfyears later.Crick and Watson met for the first time early in October of 1951. Crick was agraduate student working towards his PhD at Cambridge, where he was doing X-raydiffraction studies on polypeptides and proteins. James Watson was 12 yearsyounger than Crick, although he had received his PhD from Indiana University bythe time he was 22 years old studying bacterial phages (viruses). However, heknew little about DNA.On November 21, 1951, Franklin and Wilkins gave a update on their X-raydiffraction studies at a King’s College colloquium. This data that Watson andCrick later used was presented by Franklin. Using Watson’s understanding ofFranklin’s data, Watson and Crick instantly produced a helical model of DNA andthey invited Franklin and Wilkins, amongst others, to view it and render theiropinions. Franklin, who by then had created her own model, “blasted” the Watsonand Crick model and gave a tongue lashing to both Watson and Crick.Watson and Crick both made an offer that both groups should collaborate on theDNA project but the King’s group “spurned the offer.” Early in 1952 Franklinproduced a progress report, which Watson and Crick were able to see. Franklin,theorized that “. . .the bases faced inward and were held in place by thephosphate backbone.” Franklin’s proposal was to prove “an explosive finding,”but not immediately.Another quirk complicated the story. The four bases paired up repeatedly:adenine bound to thymine and guanine bound to cytosine. This observation wasreported and published in 1949 by Erwin Chargaff, an Austrian-Americanbiochemist. In May 1952 Chargaff visited Cambridge and met Watson and Crick, andwhile there, he brought up his 1950 publication, and he was surprised to findout they had never read his paper.After Chargaff exposed Watson and Crick to his work on the base-pairing of DNA,Crick noted, “Well, the effect was electric, yet, he also argued that the keydiscovery, the exact nature of the two base pairs, was Watson’s, and that ‘hedid this not by logic but by serendipity’. . . he was looking for somethingsignificant and immediately recognized the significance of the correct pairswhen he hit upon them by chance. . .”By the fall of 1952, Linus Pauling was preparing a paper on DNA while at thesame time Pauling’s son Peter was working in the same laboratory with Watson andCrick! Peter Pauling begins to get detailed letters from his father from Caltechin Pasadena, California, detailing his own work. It was obvious that a three-wayrace was on between King’s College, Cambridge, and Pauling at Caltech.Hal Hellman in Great Feuds in Medicine: Ten of the Liveliest Disputes Ever tellsus that Pauling’s passport was taken away in 1952 because “Pauling was suspectedof being a leftist, this in the glory days of Joe” and he was on his way to viewFranklin’s material in London at a Biophysics Committee progress report to theMedical Research Council. According to Watson in his book The Double Helix: APersonal Account of the Discovery of the Sturcture of DNA Crick learned of thereport from Wilkins and inquired if they could see the report when Watson andCrick saw the report, . . . Watson noted, “he would treat me almost as a fellowcollaborator rather than a distant acquaintance . . . (Then he told me that)Rosy had evidence for a new three-dimensional form of DNA . . . When I askedwhat the pattern was like, Maurice went into the adjacent room to pick up aprint of the new form they called the ‘B’ structure.The instant I saw the picture my mouth fell open and my pulse began to Race . ..”This was the iconic photo, number 51, that Franklin had produced in May, andwhich was the pivotal piece in the ultimate discovery. It is thought thatFranklin never knew that Watson had seen the plate, and she didn’t know thatWatson and Crick had additionally viewed her earlier data that clearly outlinedthe double helix with the bases in the center.On April 25, 1953, in the British journal, Nature, a 900 word article waspublished titled “A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,” and that introducedthe world to the “double helix” structure of DNA.The authors, James Watson, an American, and Francis Crick, an Englishman, wereimmediate heroes. Now, the basics of genetic information coding, and the abilityto pass the information on to the next generation, was known—“all of the body’sgenetic secrets were suddenly opened for study at the molecular level.”The medical world now had the tools to, “attack many of its challenges frombelow—challenges that include not only obvious hereditary diseases like Down’ssyndrome and hemophilia, but such problems as cancer, heart disease, and agingas well. Much of what is exciting in biology today—cloning, genetic therapy, DNAvaccines, mapping out the human genome—harks back directly to this work.”For their part in the discovery and publishing the structure of DNA as a doublehelix, three men: James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were jointlyawarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1962.The Nobel Prize ceremony, officiated by Professor A. Engstrom of the RoyalCaroline Institute, highlighted the “profound effect that the discovery has hadon all areas of biology . . . He highlighted the artistic nature of the moleculeand the creative thinking of the three discoverers who were being honored.”However, Hellman, in Great Feuds in Medicine, reminds us that “Hovering about,was the ghost of a young woman {Rosalind Franklin}—a dedicated, even heroic,scientist who had died four years earlier, and who, some claimed, deserved atleast as much credit (for identifying the double helix structure of DNA) as thethree honorees. It was, in fact, on the basis of Rosalind Franklin’s highlyspecialized X-ray (defraction) studies that the final discovery was made.”image [../images/00003.jpeg]On March 5, 1978, Emory University released the news that a verified case ofcystic fibrosis had been discovered by Dr. Joel D. Wallach in a young rhesusmonkey that had been raised for NASA—the first case of non-human cystic fibrosisto be identified.“This appears to be the first animal model of cystic fibrosis, and we’re excitedabout its implications,” said Drs. Joel Wallach and Harold McClure, veterinarypathologists at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center.The release went on to say, “Since cystic fibrosis is thought to be agenetically (transmitted) disease, there is a possibility that the parents orrelatives of the affected monkey (are carriers) and can have additionaloffspring with cystic fibrosis.”The discovery came as Dr. Wallach, assistant veterinary pathologist at theYerkes (Regional Primate Research) Center, was performing a routine autopsy on asix-month old male rhesus monkey that had died of unknown causes. He noticedpancreatic disease and bronchial mucus production; evaluation of the tissuelater under the microscope revealed “a classic textbook case” of cystic fibrosisas pictured in human medical literature, the Yerkes scientist said.Studies of tissue from other organs confirmed that the monkey was indeed avictim of cystic fibrosis, Dr. Wallach said. Dr. Wallach’s diagnosis wasconfirmed by Dr. Victor Nasar, an Emory pediatric pathologist at Atlanta’s GradyMemorial Hospital and by Dr. John Easterly, pathologist at the Chicago Lying-inHospital, who is a national authority on cystic fibrosis. They said that theaffected animal was bred in a colony of rhesus monkey supported by the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration for studies pertaining to the U.S. spaceprogram.“We have here a classic example of serendipity,” said Drs. Wallach and McClure.As a footnote to the news release Dr. James A. Peters, medical director of theCystic Fibrosis Foundation, which has its headquarters in Atlanta, commented:“We eagerly await the results of Dr. Wallach’s studies because of the importanceof an animal model to both basic and clinical research on cystic fibrosis.”He noted that Dr. Wallach would participate in a May 25–26 workshop in Bethesda,MD, on the animal model for the study of cystic fibrosis which will be jointlysponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Arthritis, Metabolism, andDigestive Disease and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.On March 22, 2013, James Watson spoke at the Salk Institute and the Universityof California, San Diego, on the status of genetic engineering, gene sequencing,and the Human Genome Project (of which he was the first director). It was to bea 60-year update on the anniversary of the 1953 DNA structure revelationannouncement in the journal Nature. Interestingly enough, this was exactly the35-year anniversary of Emory University’s announcement of Wallach’s discovery ofthe first non-human case of cystic fibrosis.As a result of Emory’s March 5, 1978, news release, a flurry of news articlesappeared throughout the United States:The Tuscaloosa News – March 6, 1978Cystic Fibrosis Finding Is HailedATLANTA (AP) – A routine autopsy of a young rhesus monkey which revealed what isbelieved to be the first known case of cystic fibrosis in a nonhuman provides a“great boon” to researchers seeking a cure to the disease . . ..Since cystic fibrosis is believed to be genetic, doctors say there is thepossibility that the parents or relatives of the affected monkey could produceother offspring with cystic fibrosis.The center said the discovery came as Wallach, an assistant veterinarypathologist at the center, was performing a routine autopsy on a six-month oldmale rhesus monkey that had died of unknown causes.Wallach said he noticed pancreatic disease and bronchial mucus production andunder a microscope the tissue revealed “a classic textbook case” of cysticfibrosis” as pictured in human medical literature.The diagnosis was later confirmed by other authorities, including Dr. JohnEasterly, pathologist at the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, who is a nationalauthority on the disease.The Telegraph, March 7, 1978Cystic Fibrosis Uncovered in Monkey Aids ResearchATLANTA (AP) – A routine autopsy of a young rhesus monkey revealed the firstknown case of cystic fibrosis in a nonhuman and provided a “great boon” toresearchers seeking a cure to the disease.“This appears to be the first animal model of cystic fibrosis, and we areexcited about its implications,” said Drs. Joel Wallach and Harold McClure,veterinary pathologist at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center atAtlanta’s Emory University, where the discovery was made.The Albany Herald, March 7, 1978Breakthrough Reported In Cystic Fibrosis FightATLANTA (AP) – A routine autopsy of a young rhesus monkey which revealed what isbelieved to be the first known case of cystic fibrosis in a nonhuman provides a“great boon” to researchers seeking a cure to the disease scientists say.“This appears to be the first animal model of cystic fibrosis and we’re excitedabout its implications,” said Drs. Joel Wallach and Harold McClure, veterinarypathologists at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center at Atlanta’s EmoryUniversity, where the discovery was made.The result of the Emory March 5, 1978 news release created a heady environmentwhere everyone was initially excited and anticipated more detailed informationof the cystic fibrosis discovery at the upcoming laboratory animal meeting May25–26, 1978 at the NIH headquarters in Bethesda, MD.Dutifully Wallach forwarded the requested abstract of his presentation. By thistime Wallach had learned the cause of the cystic fibrosis in the rhesus monkey,an iatrogenic (doctor caused) selenium deficiency and included the informationin the presentation abstract. In the middle of April, 1978 Wallach was abruptlyterminated from his post and uninvited from the NIH meeting in May.Wallach, self published his paper on cystic fibrosis and appeared in Bethesda,MD, on the appointed day and handed out 100 copies as the researchers enteredthe hall, which forced the NIH to allow Wallach to give his presentation as hehad been listed on the program that had been mailed out to all of the attendees.Dr. John Troxel, a fellow University of Missouri graduate of the school ofveterinary medicine, funded a news release to bring the general public up todate, which produced another round of heady days with the media:The Telegraph-Herald, August 24, 1978Scientist Upsets Cystic Fibrosis TheoryNEW YORK (UPI) – A maverick scientist who found that a mysterious sickness infive monkeys was cystic fibrosis Thursday upset the theory the disease is aninherited disorder – and raised the possibility that environmental factors arethe cause.Dr. Joel D. Wallach of St. Louis said he traced the first finding of the ailmentin a primate colony to dietary factors—“supplemental feeding with large amountsof polyunsaturated oil which interfered with normal cell metabolism of the traceelements selenium and zinc, plus vitamin B2.”It happened late last year at the Yerkes Primate Center in Atlanta and in acolony of research monkeys involved in unrelated investigations for the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration.The chance finding, said Wallach, led him to try to produce the disorder inother monkeys through dietary manipulation.“I think proper investigation could show that cystic fibrosis could be caused,reversed or prevented, “Wallach said.He said the later experiments were not endorsed by the Center and that themonkeys were removed from his area and then he was fired for attempting theresearch.Wallach’s theory says cystic fibrosis occurs prenatally when the mother isdeficient in certain trace elements and postnatally when the baby’s diet isdisordered.The traditional theory holds cystic fibrosis is genetically transmitted and seenonly in humans.It is fatal in the majority of cases in infancy. Fewer than half of those whosurvive beyond that stage live beyond the age of 21.The Pittsburgh Press, August 25, 1978Monkey Study Links Diet, Cystic FibrosisNEW YORK (UPI) – A maverick scientist who found a mysterious sickness in fivemonkeys was cystic fibrosis has upset the theory the disease is an inheriteddisorder – and raised the possibility that environmental factors are the cause.Dr. Joel Wallach of St. Louis said yesterday he traced the first finding of theailment in a primate colony to dietary factors – “supplemental feeding withlarge amounts of polyunsaturated oil which interfered with normal cellmetabolism of the trace elements selenium and zinc, plus vitamin B2....The chance finding, said Wallach, led him to try to produce the disorder inother monkeys through dietary manipulation – a route he said is needed to testhis theory.“I think proper investigation could show that cystic fibrosis could be caused,reversed or prevented,” Wallach said. “And I want to share this information withopen-minded physicians and scientists.”He said the later experiments were not endorsed by the primate center and thatthe monkeys were removed from his area and then he was fired for attempting theresearch.“I was fired on March 5, 1978 with just hours notice,” he said.Wallach’s theory says cystic fibrosis occurs prenatally when the mother isdeficient in certain trace elements (such as selenium) or postnatally when thebaby’s diet is disordered . . .The traditional theory holds cystic fibrosis is genetically transmitted and isseen only in humans. It occurs in one of every 2,500 births and is marked bysticky substances and lesions in the lungs, liver, (pancreas) and other vitalorgans.Sarasota Herald-Tribune, August 26, 1978Researcher Is FiredTheory On Cystic Fibrosis Is DisputedNEW YORK (UPI) – A chance finding of cystic fibrosis in research monkeys upsetstheory that the disorder is inherited and raises the possibility thatenvironmental factors are the cause, a St. Louis scientist has reported.Dr. Joel D. Wallach told a news conference he traced the first finding of theailment in the primates to dietary factors – “supplemental feeding with largeamounts of a polyunsaturated oil which interfered with normal cell metabolism ofthe trace elements selenium and zinc, plus vitamin B2.”Wallach said other scientists had confirmed that the lesions he found late lastyear in the sick animals at Yerkes Primate Research Center in Atlanta weresimilar to those seen in (human) cystic fibrosis.The veterinary pathologist said he was attempting to cause the disorder inanother group of primates at Yerkes, where he was assistant pathologist, whenword of his work got to his superiors.“I was fired on May 5, 1978 with 24 hours notice,” he said.“Before that I was starting to get some success when my monkeys were removedfrom my area. I do not know what happened to them.”“There is no question that this is an interesting theory,” Dr. Harold McCluresaid when reached by phone. He is the pathologist at Yerkes and was Wallach’sboss.“It has not been proved or disproved, but I have no intension of pursuing it.”Dr. James Peters, Scientific Director of the National Cystic FibrosisFoundation, said, “Wallach has a hypothesis that has not been rigorously testedby scientific methods. He is attempting to explain observations without anyscientific backup.”Wallach received his doctor of veterinary medicine degree in 1964 from theUniversity of Missouri in Columbia. Sponsoring his trip to New York andThursday’s news conference was a classmate Dr. John F. Troxell, a veterinarianfrom Flossmoor, IL, who said, “he thinks the theory is worth investigating.”At this point, much in the same manner as the British naval doctors, who scoffedat the idea that scurvy was connected to diet and continued to look for the“germ” that caused scurvy, even after it was widely known for more than ahundred years that scurvy was caused by some dietary problem related to theconsumption of polished rice and that fresh vegetables and fruit, rich invitamin C, could prevent and reverse the disease that had caused the death ofmore than two million of British and Japanese sailors; and similar to the deathsof millions of people all over the world from beriberi and pellagra, doctors allover the world continued to look for the “germ” when it was widely known thatthese diseases were related to the consumption of high corn and polished ricediets, in fact deficiencies of vitamins B1 and B3 respectively; doctors all overthe world, even after the discovery of the relationship of cystic fibrosis to aselenium deficiency in primates, continue to look for the “genetic connection”for cystic fibrosis when it is caused by the combination of a gluten intoleranceand a deficiency of selenium and can be prevented and cured with thesupplementation of all 90 essential nutrients with a special emphasis on thetrace mineral selenium—as a result of their self-serving arrogance, millions ofchildren all over the world have died of cystic fibrosis since 1978unnecessarily.A year and a half after Wallach’s termination from Yerkes in May of 1978, thedenials and lies of the Yerkes staff and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation becameextremely aggressive and they prevented Wallach from getting a position as apathologist anywhere in the U.S. At this point, what should have beenencouragement to prove that the initial findings of cystic fibrosis in the fivemonkeys were not a fluke, Yerkes, Emory University and the Cystic FibrosisFoundation invested their energy and reputation in the attempt to destroyWallach and any future investigation—history it seems was repeating itself.Times Daily, December 1, 1978.Yerkes Center Denies Finding Disease CureATLANTA (UPI) – The director of the Yerkes Primate Center Tuesday denied theclaim of a St. Louis veterinary pathologist that the center (Wallach) haddiscovered a cure for cystic fibrosis.Dr. Frederick A. King said the prestigious center had never even looked for acure for the disease, one of childhood’s deadliest.“Unfortunately, there is no known cure for cystic fibrosis,” said King. Thenational headquarters of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Atlanta also issued adenial the disease could be prevented or cured.Dr. Joel D. Wallach held a news conference at Northwestern Memorial Hospital inChicago last weekend to announce that medical science (Wallach) had found theanswer to cystic fibrosis.Wallach said, “The disease (cystic fibrosis), long thought to be a geneticdisorder, is caused by a deficiency during pregnancy (and the early post natalperiod) and can be prevented and cured. He said it also could be prevented by aproper diet and autopsies and tests of thousands of monkeys (their exaggeration)at the Yerkes Primate Research Center in Atlanta supported his theory.King said Wallach was assistant pathologist at Yerkes in 1977–78 and that duringthat time the death of one monkey revealed lesions of the pancreas resemblingthose of cystic fibrosis (in 1978, cystic fibrosis experts including Drs. VictorNasar, Emory University and John Easterly, Chicago Lying-in Hospital, and RobertBeale, the national Cystic Fibrosis Foundation had all confirmed that thedisease found in the initial monkey were in fact cystic fibrosis). He said thatwhether this single case (there were positive cystic fibrosis biopsies of fiveadditional cases from the same colony) represents or is even similar to cysticfibrosis in humans “remains to be proven.”King said a few other monkeys housed in the same area were evaluated, “but therewas no verifiable evidence of pancreatic or cystic fibrosis-like pathology inthese animals (Dr. King’s statement is an absolute lie, classic pancreaticlesions of cystic fibrosis were found in all five biopsies and the inclusionbodies found in the liver of these monkeys, classic for cystic fibrosis from theliver were magnified 126, 000 times through an electron microscope and theelectron photomicrographs became the cover picture of Wallach’s book, RareEarth: Forbidden Cures).”The Yerkes director said that contrary to Wallach’s claim that thousands ofmonkeys (their exaggeration) were used in cystic fibrosis research at Yerkes,“no such research on cystic fibrosis has been carried out here. Consequently, wehave no evidence of any kind at the Yerkes Center to support his beliefs.”At his news conference, Wallach said, “the disease was caused by a lack ofselenium, a trace element, during the first three months of pregnancy or in thefirst months postnatal. It can be prevented,” he said, “and also cured.”Eugene Register-Guard, December 3, 1978Doctor claims he’s found cure for cystic fibrosisCHICAGO (UPI) – Cystic fibrosis, a deadly disease of children, long thought tobe a genetic disorder, actually is caused by a nutritional deficiency duringpregnancy and can be cured, a researcher said Saturday.Dr. Joel D. Wallach, a St. Louis veterinary pathologist, said the disease iscaused by a lack of selenium, a trace element, during the first three months ofpregnancy. He said cystic fibrosis can be prevented by proper diet andsupplementation of all 90 essential nutrients with a special emphasis on thetrace element selenium and can be cured – by surgery in some cases and seleniumin others.Wallach said he has been called a “snot-nosed horse doctor” by geneticists (andmedical doctors) because he refuted the 40-year theory that cystic fibrosis is agenetic disorder.Cystic fibrosis is found in one of every 2,500 children born in the UnitedStates. The disease is usually fatal in infancy. Fewer than half its victimslive beyond age 21. CF is characterized by defects in the pancreas, malegenitals, lungs and small intestine.Wallach says the key to its prevention and cure is selenium, a trace elementfound in liver, eggs, kidneys and some varieties of high selenium rice.“Normal selenium levels in pregnant women will prevent CF,” Wallach said, andtests on thousands of monkeys (their exaggeration) have shown the disease is 100percent curable when diagnosed within 30 days of birth (actually cure can beaccomplished in teenagers and young adults).He (Wallach) began his work on his theory in 1977 when the disease—long thoughtto affect only humans—was discovered by Wallach, in five biologically unrelatedmonkeys at the Yerkes Primate Research Center in Atlanta, where he worked.CF symptoms in the five monkeys were traced by computer to a deficiency of thetrace elements selenium and zinc, and of vitamin B2.Saraota Herald-Tribune, Sunday December 3, 1978.Diet Called Key to Cystic FibrosisCHICAGO (UPI) – Cystic fibrosis, a deadly disease of children, long thought tobe a genetic disorder, actually is caused by a nutritional deficiency duringpregnancy and can be cured, a researcher said Saturday.Dr. Joel D. Wallach, a St. Louis veterinary pathologist, said the disease iscaused by a lack of selenium, a trace element, during the first three months ofpregnancy. He said cystic fibrosis can be cured – by surgery in some cases andwith selenium in others.Wallach said he has been called a “snot-nosed horse doctor” by geneticists (anddoctors) because he refuted the 40 year theory that cystic fibrosis is caused bya genetic disorder.“It’s mind-boggling that this is true,” Wallach said of his nutritional theoryat a news conference at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. “But nothing has saidtilt. Everything keeps reinforcing this (selenium deficiency as a cause of CF) .. .”He began his work on his theory in 1977 when the disease—long thought to affectonly humans—was discovered (by Wallach) in five biologically unrelated monkeysat the Yerkes Primate Research Center in Atlanta, where he worked.CF symptoms in the five monkeys were traced by computer to a deficiency of thetrace elements selenium and zinc, and vitamin B2.Following the revelation that a selenium deficiency caused the childhood diseasecystic fibrosis, Wallach continued to investigate selenium deficiency disease inhumans. A selenium deficiency could produce liver necrosis (death), livercirrhosis, pancreatic disease (i.e., CF, pancreatitis, etc.), hypertrophiccardiomyopathy heart disease (in humans, in China, known as “Keshan disease” andin animals known as “mulberry heart disease”), white muscle disease in animals(aka: muscular dystrophy in humans), etc.After his marriage to Dr. Ma Lan, in 1985, a micro-surgeon who had done researchand taught surgery at the Harvard school of medicine, Wallach visited mainlandChina, Dr. Ma Lan’s native country. In their travels through China, Wallachlearned that 13 per 1,000 children in Keshan Provence died of aselenium-deficiency hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart attack each year and theWHO recognized Keshan Disease as a selenium-deficiency disease.Although it was believed that cystic fibrosis was an iconic example of a simpleMendelian genetically-transmitted disease and primarily occurred in whiteEuropeans, Wallach reasoned that if selenium deficiency was in fact the cause ofcystic fibrosis, then, there would have to be some of the Chinese kids who diedof Keshan disease who would also have cystic fibrosis!In 1987, Wallach and Lan, in a study funded by Wallach’s mother and arranged byMa’s parents, they went on a tour through Keshan Provence and with thecooperation of Harbin Medical University and in collaboration with researchersat Harbin Medical University, Wallach and Ma showed very clearly that hithertounrecognized pancreatic, liver, lung and muscle lesions occurred in 35% (595) of1,700 Chinese children who had died of documented Keshan Disease, the endemiccardiomyopathy heart disease occurring in low-selenium regions of China.Other researchers have since drawn attention to the aberrant oxygen radicalactivity and the low selenium and antioxidant status in CF patients. It is nowalso agreed that selenium deficiency may develop in children leading to CFbecause of a digestive malabsorption (gluten intolerance) or after prolongedtotal parenteral nutrition. In addition, a case of cardiomyopathy in a CFpatient caused by a selenium deficiency has been described.The treatment of CF patients with selenium and antioxidant vitamins has alsobeen tested in a human clinical trial:“In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, the antioxidative-oxidative balance ischronically disturbed. Free radicals were generated by bronchialpulmonalinfection and additionally (there) exists a deficiency of antioxidativesubstances by enteral malabsorption especially of vitamin E and selenium. ForCFpatients, therefore, we recommend a sodium selenite substitution therapy, bestin combination with vitamin E.”image [../images/00003.jpeg]On March 22, 2013, the headlines of the Union–Tribune newspaper, from San Diegostated, “(Gene sequencing is not) the solution. The solution is good (bio)chemistry,” and the story went on to say, “Nobel laureate James Watson . . .tells Salk audience gene sequencing to cure cancer (and other diseases is)mostly irrelevant.” Watson continued, “Sequencing genes isn’t proving to beparticularly useful in fighting diseases such as cancer (and diabetes).”To maximize man’s potential for health, longevity, productivity and spiritualitywe must widen our horizons. The medical system has failed humanity fearfully— tothe point that the longest lived peoples on earth are the ones who did notengage or employ “modern medicine.”By “dumb luck,” the healthiest and longest lived peoples in the world chose tolive in places that had optimal levels of raw materials (i.e., the essentialminerals) necessary for man to flourish and be long-lived and be productive.In 2004 a Forbes magazine article stated that the average American billionaire’slife span was 78 years of age and none had ever lived to be 100 years. In afollow-up survey in 2011, Forbes recorded a whopping 12-year drop in the averagelife span of billionaires to 66 years of age, and Steve Jobs, Apple founder, haddied at 56 years of age—10 years short of the average!As a group, billionaires spend more for health care and fitness than any othergroup of people, yet they fall far short of the human capacity for longevitybecause they invest in the opinions of a “highly respected” medical doctorrather than investing in the raw materials necessary for the maintenance andmaximization of health and longevity.In May 2013 the National Geographic published a cover story “This child willlive to be 120 years of age.” The article pointed out that the longest livingand healthiest peoples, were primitive peoples who were legendary for not havingaccess to modern western medicine. They had no electricity, no access tophysicians, health insurance, clinics, or hospitals, and they lived in thatchedroof huts with dirt floors. The general conclusion of the article was that thelong healthy lives of these people were “either due to genetics or simple dumbluck.” We will bet on the dumb luck, which allows us to collect informationregarding the raw materials obtained by these people, which, can then beimported into each home, and then all humans can have the same health andlongevity benefits.In August of 2013 it was reported that Carmelo Flores Laura, an illiterateAymara Indian from Bolivia actively working as a sheep herder at 13,000 feetelevation, was listed by the Guiness Book of Records as the oldest living personever documented at 123 years of age. He lives in a thatched roof, mud flooredhut without utilities in an isolated hamlet near Lake Titicaca. He tends hissheep on the side of a mountain without the aid of a cane, walker, or wheelchair.The veterinary industry tripled the life span of dogs over the last 60 years.Sixty years ago, an old dog was eight years old. Today, in 2013, an old dog istwenty-five years of age. Veterinarians have eliminated 900 diseases in dogsthat still plague people, and veterinarians have eliminated all birth defects indogs that still plague humans. The animal industry didn’t do these wondrousthings in the animal industry with organ transplants, wonder drugs, stem cells,or genetically engineered proteins. The miracles were produced simply andeconomically by perfecting the nutritional value of over-the-counter dog food.There are three principals that must be practiced to the level of an obsessionif we are to maximize the optimal health, longevity, and productivity of anindividual and their progeny and by doing these things we will assure thesurvival of the human species: 1. Eliminate acute and chronic damage, both self inflicted and environmental (grow as much of your own organic food as possible). 1. Consume as much organic food, non-GMO food, and fresh foods as possible. 2. Store and have available as much freeze-dried organic food and non-GMO food as possible—include a serving in each meal—get used to it! 3. Drink clean water (slightly alkaline: i.e., 7.5 to 8.5), however, do not drink alkaline water during meals as it will neutralize the essential acid environment of the stomach. 4. Avoid the consumption of processed meats containing nitrates and nitrites and gluten-laden fillers (e.g., deli slices, sandwich meats, sausage, bologna, salami, pepperoni, jerky, hamburger patties, meatloaf, meat balls, canned meats, etc.) 5. Work on being as gluten free as possible, especially if you have symptoms of a gluten intolerance—you are not what you eat—you are what you absorb. 6. Avoid all sources of trans-fatty acids, heterocyclic amines and acrylamides (e.g., oils, burnt meats, super-heated carbohydrates, etc.) 7. Keep sugar (natural and processed) to a minimum. 2. Repair existing cellular, tissue and organ damage through non-hazardous and supportive nutritional and non-pharmaceutical methods. 1. Except for emergencies of great magnitude, avoid doctors as much as possible. Refer to the trilogy of books Let’s Play Doctor, Let’s Play Herbal Doctor, and Passport to Aroma Therapy by Wallach and Ma for self-treatment of minor emergencies and self-treatment approaches to chronic diseases. 2. Avoid surgery as much as possible except for emergencies of great magnitude. Always employ non-invasive tissue supporting methods first. Give self-help 90 days. 3. Establish an ongoing preventive maintenance and repair program by employing an optimal diet and daily supplementation with all 90 essential nutrients and herbs as medicines when appropriate. 1. Employ what might be considered “alternative” or “complimentary” medicine preferentially to avoid unnecessary damage.ANCIENT DIETARY TRADITIONSFood, diet and dietary restrictions appear to be the first and perennial basicsof ancient attempts at proactively controlling health and longevity. Initially,traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurvedic medicine, and Naturopathicmedicine based their dietary recommendations on the belief that “you are whatyou eat.” Today we know (Wallach) that “you are what you absorb.”These early healers knew that the proactive pursuit of certain diets and theavoidance of certain substances, foods and plants would contribute to a moreenergetic, healthy and longer life.AYURVEDIC MEDICINEAyurveda, is a holistic system of health and longevity that began in India, andis thought to be the world’s oldest system of natural medicine. Ayurvedicmedicine is believed to be the early scientific map that birthed Egyptian,Chinese, Greek and Persian medicine. The term “Ayurveda” is derived from veda,meaning knowledge or science, and ayus, meaning life or life span, combined tomean science of life or knowledge of life span. Ayurveda delivers preventativemedicine, promoting wellness by the support of mental, emotional, and physicalstrength.Ayurvedic medicine sprang from the historical Hindu philosophy and spiritualpractices that embraced the “Vedas,” which were initially practiced more than5,000 years ago. The Vedas were a collection of the ideas and practices of theholy men of ancient India. It is thought that these practices were “divinewisdom” that were employed in the four categories of human conduct including: 1. Self-knowledge 2. Cosmology of the Universe 3. A path to God 4. Physical healthA large cadre of medical scholars, believe that Ayurvedic medicine is the oldestnatural health and healing system. This system is based on prana, which is a“vital energy” thought to be required for the maintenance of health and lifeitself. In the Ayurvedic system, all are blessed with prana. However, it must beprotected, maintained, and renewed by each individuals actions, includingdietary choices.An essential practice for the replenishment of prana is a collection ofbreathing exercises referred to as pranayama and air is believed to be made upof the vital energy of prana.Ayurveda also teaches that each being is composed of the five basic elements ofthe universe:AirWaterEarthFireSpaceAyurveda teaches that the combination and pattern of these primary elements thatindividuals are born with is the “fingerprint” of each individuals“constitution.”In an effort to understand how the human functions, the Ayurvedic systemcombines the elements into three groups called doshas:Vata (space and air) – “light and airy”; governs the nervous system; indicativeof an active, alert personality type;Pitta (fire and water) – “flowing fiery”; governs the digestive system;indicative of an aggressive, can-do personality type;Kapha (earth and water) – slow and strong; governs the bones, muscles, andhealing; indicative of a steady, tranquil personality type.In Ayurvedic medicine, vata, pitta, and kapha are employed in the same manner asWestern medicine pigeon holes people into body types known as ectomorph (vata);endomorph (pitta); and mesomorph (kapha). By contrast, Ayurvedic medicine alsoplaces psychological, emotional, and spiritual value to each dosha category.MATCHING YOUR DIET TO YOUR DOSHAThe Ayurvedic belief of a “personal constitution” is a significant feature ofit’s nutritional and medical philosophy. Ayurveda stresses that each individualmust put conscious effort into living life in accordance with theirconstitution. Living contrary to each one’s personality produces an imbalance, abuild up of toxins, disturbances of their main dosha, and eventually adeterioration of their health.Diet is a significant factor in maintaining balance, personal harmony, andhealth according to the Ayurvedic tradition.The Primary Ayurvedic Personality TypesVatta (air & space)Pitta (fire & water)Kapha (water & earth)Slender & light buildHot, sharp, lightHeavy, cold, oilyEnergy in bursts.

His agewas officially recorded by the Chinese government and confirmed by Professor WuChung Chich, head of the Chang-Tu University. Li was born, lived, and died inSichuan Province; Li had outlived 23 wives and was living with his 24th wife atthe time of his death.Authorities at the Minkuo University displayed records of Professor Li’s birthdate of 1677 and on his 150th and 200th birthdays he was congratulated by thenational Chinese government and issued a certificate on each birthdate toauthenticate the event.Professor Li was an herbalist who grew, prepared, mixed, and sold herbs to hispatients. When Li was asked about his secret and personal practices that led tohis exceptional longevity, he replied: “Keep a quiet heart, sit like a tortoise,walk sprightly like a pigeon, and sleep like a dog.”Wallach and Ma would like to know what the mineral analysis would be of the soilthat Professor Li lived on and obtained his wood supply for fuel! If ProfessorLi’s age was in fact correct, the soil would have to be rich in its rare earthcontent ,as rare earths are known to double the life span of laboratory species.As of May 2012 China’s production of rare earths composed 95% of the world’sproduction and supply.The Taoist tradition of health and well-being, which is embraced by TraditionalChinese Medicine, is based on three aspects of life: san bao (three treasures)or san chi (three marvels). The Taoists believe that every human is born withoptimal amounts of these treasures (telomeres) at birth, and depending on howwell they are managed will determine the individual’s health and how long theywill live:Jing – The physical body and its essential fluids are referred to as jing(essence) or Vitality.Chi – The vital force that empowers the body and initiates the “life functions”or energy. Energy is the vital force that consciously and unconsciously drivesand moves every system of the body.Shen – All functions of the mind, consciousness and cognition are combined inshen (spirit). To the Taoist, spirit, is in the ultimate meaning of all thingsis the force of creation.Vitality or essence (jing) and energy (chi), is evidenced by mental vigor,immunity and resistance to disease, and sexual potency—the bench mark foroptimal health in the Chinese mind set is vitality (jing-chi).Traditional Chinese Medicine philosophy looks at food as a significant factor inan individual’s health. The Taoist believes that the quality of one’s diet, thepresence of nutrients in each meal, and the efficiency of digestion andmetabolism play a significant role in the “quality” of the bodies two fluids, oressences, that they believe form the foundation of life itself: chi (vitalenergy) and blood. The Traditional Chinese Medicine concept of health and humanphysiology is centered on two organs, the stomach and the spleen, which theybelieve transforms food into chi and blood.According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, the lack of optimal amounts of thecorrect foods or an excess of food can negatively impact energy and health. Thefailure to consume proper amounts of the correct foods produces a deficiency ofchi and blood, which ultimately causes various organs to fail. An excess of foodproduces a stagnation of energy and blood which can result in a stomach disease.The Taoist nutritional beliefs and science show that inappropriate food choiceshave a direct negative effect on health. The Traditional Chinese Medicine viewis that good food contains essential nutrients that transforms chi into bloodand that it also has an impact on the two bioenergetics polarities of theuniverse—yin and yang.Yang foods are stimulating and warm and yin foods are calming and cooling.Traditionally, foods are selected to balance the yin and the yang functions andqualities of the body’s organs and also yin and yang status outside the body:Depression (yin) – use yang foods for balance.Weather (yin: damp and cold) – use yang warming foods that dry the internalorgans.Fatty greasy foods, alcohol, and sweets produce dampness and heat.Too much raw food strains the yang of the spleen which produces the condition ofInternal Cold and Dampness which manifests itself as abdominal pain andweakness.TRADITIONAL CHINESE SEASONAL FOODSAn additional factor in traditional Chinese food choices and food therapy thathave been employed for thousands of years, is the eating of foods that areproduced in specific seasons and months of the year (astrology). The yang foodsare eaten during the winter for warming, and the yin foods are eaten during thesummer for their cooling effects.Yang (warming foods)Yin (cooling foods)Cooked vegetablesraw vegetablesTomato saucericeKidney beans, lentilsyogurtPotatoestofuCooked fishmilkGarliccurry powderMisosashimi (raw fish)MolassessugarClovessaltACUPUNCTUREAcupuncture is a 4,000-year-old therapy that is used today by 1.5 billionChinese and millions of other oriental peoples. Acupuncture therapy is based onthe concept that the human vital energy is distributed to various “points” onand in the body, and when these points are “blocked” disease is the result.These points are thought to be linked to the nerves that connect subcutaneous“meridians” with the internal tissues and organs. It is believed thatacupuncture releases blocked energy and restores health by inserting needlesinto specific acupuncture points and releasing the blockage. Acupuncture isparticularly useful for relieving pain and providing low-risk anesthesia formajor surgical procedures including abdominal, chest and bone surgicalprocedures.NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANSNaturopathic medicine can trace its beginnings to Hippocrates, and similarly toAyurvedic medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine, and is based on the conceptthat the human body has a “vital force” that must be managed and kept in balanceto maintain optimal health.Naturopathic medicine is a holistic approach to health, meaning the body, mind,and spirit are entities that are of equal weight in managing the state of healthof each individual.A healthy, balanced lifestyle supported by an optimal diet containing all 90essential nutrients (usually guaranteed by supplementation) promotes a healthyself maintaining body. Naturopathic philosophy engenders the belief that thenatural direction of the body’s life energy flows towards preserving optimalhealth and the cells of all tissues contain the ability to remain healthy, toduplicate themselves and to resist disease under ideal conditions (homeostasis).The father of modern naturopathic medicine, Dr. Benedict Lust, a Germanphysician who immigrated to the U.S. in 1896, was a supporter of the conceptthat the body could defend and heal itself when provided with optimal intakes ofall essential nutrients in optimal levels.Dr. Lust instituted the first modern training program for naturopathic medicinein New York in 1902. The curriculum consisted of courses in botanical medicine,nutritional therapy, physiotherapy, psychology, homeopathy, and naturopathicmanipulation including manual manipulation technique and medical message.In the 21st century, naturopathic medicine is the leading proponent, in thevarious forms of Western medicine, of healthy diet and optimal supplementalprograms that provide all 90 essential nutrients through the concept ofepigenetics (i.e., most diseases that are thought to be genetically transmittedare in fact nutritional deficiencies that negatively impact the functions ofDNA, RNA, and enzymes) in order to prevent and reverse most diseases.The Six Principles of Naturopathic Healing 1. The healing power of nature – the body itself has a natural healing power, and the physician is required to identify any “blockages” to the body’s own healing powers. 2. Treat the whole person – the body is an intricate web of forces, which when they are in a harmonious state produce an optimally healthy body. Disease is considered to be an imbalance in one part or system that affects the whole. Naturopathic therapy is therefore designed to support the whole person rather than attacking only symptoms. 3. First do no harm – naturopathic physicians, as primary care physicians are licensed to perform most medical procedures and prescribe pharmaceuticals, however, they preferentially use homeopathy, herbal medicine, nutritional therapies and other non-invasive therapies. 4. Identify and treat the cause of the disease – symptoms are not the cause of the disease, rather symptoms (i.e., fever, pain, elevated blood sugar, swelling, etc.) are the body’s efforts to defend and heal itself. Usually, the underlying causes of disease are related to the individual’s lifestyle, nutrition, personal hygiene, and emotional state. 5. Prevention is the best cure – the patient is educated on how to eat, supplement with optimal levels of all 90 essential nutrients, and to correct their lifestyle and avoid the “bad” things to prevent disease. 6. The naturopathic physician is the patient’s teacher – the naturopathic doctor teaches the patient how to be responsible in all phases of diet, supplementation, personal hygiene, and lifestyle.The Basic Tools of Naturopathic MedicineNutritional therapy and fasting – the use of diet, supplementation, and fastingto provide the body with all of the basic raw material it needs to develop andmaintain itself.Herbal medicine – the use of herbs, plant substances, aromatherapy, spices andplant based foods as medicines.Homeopathy – the use of homeopathic remedies that employ the “like treats like”principle.Hydrotherapy – the use of hot and cold water therapy to stimulate the immune andcirculatory systems.Naturopathic and chiropractic manipulation – multiple forms of physicaltreatment through massage, physiology, and reestablishing normal alignment.CHIROPRACTIC MEDICINEChiropractic translates to “done by the hand.” Chiropractic theory posits thatmany illnesses begin when the vertebrae of the spinal column “subluxate” or slipout of place or alignment, pinch or compress nerves and thus block the body’svital energy flow. Chiropractic practitioners work to realign the spinalvertebrae by hand and body maneuvers. Chiropractic is most often used for neck,shoulder, arm, back pain, slipped discs, and other musculoskeletal pain.There are at least two divisions of chiropractic: 1. Straights – chiropractic practitioners who limit their practice to manipulation. 2. Mixers – chiropractors who employ chiropractic manipulation, acupuncture, nutrition, herbs, homeopathy, etc.SUPPLEMENTATIONNutritional supplementation is a broad concept that describes the regulardietary employment of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids anda wide scope of food factors (e.g., bioflavonoids, polyphenols, antioxidants,etc.), and herbs to support optimal health, and to treat and prevent disease.The general role of vitamins and minerals is their requirement as cofactors toimplement the activity of enzymes, coenzymes, DNA, and RNA. Enzymes facilitatethe activity of metabolic processes in mitochondria and every cell in the body.Coenzymes support the optimal activity of enzymes.Enzymes and coenzymes perform by connecting or disconnecting metabolic moleculesby producing or dissolving chemical bonds. The general goal of nutritionalsupplementation is to supply the optimal levels of nutritional cofactors tofacilitate optimal metabolic activity of tissue enzyme systems.Enzymes are typically made up of a protein and cofactors that are vitamins andor minerals.DNA and RNA replicate proteins, amino acids, and enzymes for all of the bodiesfunctions of life, reproduction, and longevity.If the essential cofactor is missing, the enzyme cannot perform properly, if atall. Studies have shown that most Americans fail to obtain optimal levels of all90 essential nutrients: the U.S. government (NHANES 1, II, III, and 2007–2008;10- State Nutrition Survey; USDA nationwide food consumption studies, etc. haveshown that marginal nutritional deficiencies continue to exist in a significant(50%) number of the U.S. population; and for selected nutrients 80% of U.S.individuals in targeted age groups took in less than the Recommended DailyIntake (RDI).These studies show that most Americans are highly unlikely to take in a meal ora diet that provides the RDI for all 90 essential nutrients. Subclinicaldeficiency is the term used to describe minor or marginal nutritionaldeficiencies. Subclinical nutrient deficiencies typically manifest themselves aschronic fatigue, lethargy, depression, lack of concentration, slow recoveryafter exercise, etc.It is well documented that even an aggressive effort to “eat well” will fallshort in providing all of the essential nutrients in optimal levels. Vitaminlevels in food have decreased by more than 37% between 1950 and 1999, and tracemineral levels have decreased by 77% between 1940 and 1991.In April 16, 2012, the well respected journal Food Chemistry reported that mostcommercially available infant formulas contain less than 20% of the minimumdaily requirements of dietary minerals and vitamins.Most investigators fail to grasp the gravity of the situation and blame thenutrient deficiencies in American food on “synthetic fertilizers” and “types ofseeds.” If fact the deficiencies are caused by three factors: 1. Minerals do not occur in a uniform blanket throughout the earth’s crust— they occur in veins, in much the same manner as chocolate in chocolate ripple ice cream and plants do not manufacture minerals. 2. The traditional source of the daily renewal of U.S. subsistence farm soils from plant minerals—aka wood ashes—disappeared shortly after 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon, Monday September 4, 1882, when Thomas Edison pulled the switch to start the first commercial electric generating plant on Pearl St. in New York City. Within ten years of this event almost all towns and cities in the Industrialized World converted from wood as the universal fuel to electricity, natural gas, and propane, effectively eliminating humanity’s traditional source of mineral supplementation from plant minerals that were contained in wood ashes. 3. The annual flooding of rivers reinvigorated soils with minerals that originated in mountains and upstream soils. Classically “bottom land” and “flood plains” were the most fertile and most expensive farm land because of this annual renewal process. The damming of rivers to prevent floods and additionally to produce hydroelectric power cut off the historical annual renewal of soil mineral levels by flooding and silt deposition. And another major consequence of damming the great rivers was to cut off the food supply to the oceans. It’s not pollution that is destroying the oceans. Humans simply cut off the food supply to the oceans—no silt, no plant life, no little fish, no medium sized fish, no large predator fish—oops, Houston, we have a problem!In practical terms, one cannot estimate to any effective level how much of anynutrient that might be in an individuals diet. Even vegetarian diets composed oforganic fruits and vegetables fall short according to a 2012 meta-study reportedin The Annals of Internal Medicine with 240 small studies combined. Therefore acornerstone of optimal health in the 21st century is a comprehensive nutritionalsupplementation program that provides all 90 essential nutrients.Recommendations for a Daily Multiple Vitamin and Mineral IntakeVitaminDaily Dose/ Adults and children over 9 years oldVitamin A (retinol)2,500 – 5,000 IUVitamin A (beta – carotene)5,000 – 25,000 IUVitamin B1 (thiamine)10 – 100 mgVitamin B2 (riboflavin)10 – 50 mgVitamin B3 (niacin)10 – 100 mgVitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)25 – 100 mgVitamin B6 (pyridoxine)25 – 100 mgVitamin B12 (methylcobalamin)400 mcgVitamin C (ascorbic acid)250 – 1,000 mgVitamin D1,000 – 2,000 IUVitamin E (mixed tocopherols)100 – 200 IUVitamin K1 or K260 – 300 mcgNiacinamide (niacin)10 – 30 mgBiotin100 – 300 mcgFolic acid400 mcgCholine10 – 100 mgInositol10 – 100 mgBioflavonoids1,000 – 5,000 mgMineralsRange for adults and children/100 poundsBoron1 – 6 mgCalcium600 -1,000 mgChromium200 – 400 mcgCopper1 – 2 mgIodine50 – 150 mcgIron15 – 30 mgMagnesium250 – 500 mgManganese3 – 5 mgMolybdenum10 – 25 mcgPotassiumNASelenium100 – 200 mcgSilica1 – 25 mgVanadium50 – 100 mcgZinc15 – 30 mgNA: The FDA restricts the amount of potassium in supplements to 99 mg.
