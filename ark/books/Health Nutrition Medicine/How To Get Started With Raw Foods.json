Appendices"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 8 Let’s Take It From The Top... What IS Raw Food? Technically speaking, raw food is food that has not been heated to above 118 degrees Fahrenheit (that’s about 48 degrees Centigrade) and typically is quite literally a raw ingredient – pure, unadulterated and whole (and usually from a plant) – like a piece of fresh fruit, a whole organic vegetable, a nut, seed, grain or bean (all unheated) and so on. That said, as the interest in raw foods and “the raw food diet” (it’s not strictly a diet in the modern sense of the word, but we’ll let that go for now) has increased, food manufacturers, raw food chefs and raw food teachers have looked for an increasing number of ways to take the basic raw ingredients and turn them into something more interesting. Hence why we have “raw cakes”, “raw pizzas”, “raw ice­creams” and raw just about everything else. So again, t echnically, as long as a food or a recipe's ingredients have not been heated above this temperature then the food is considered raw. What is “Living Food”? Many people use the terms “raw” and “living” interchangeably. I am the first to admit that the term “raw” is completely unattractive as a word and does little to promote the benefits to be had by eating raw. Still, if you can get over that, then you can understand why some people prefer to use the word “living” – it is much more indicative of what raw foods are about, because they are, after all, foods that are still alive, not having been cooked, and furthermore inspire life (the foods themselves having not been heat treated can still reproduce, which cooked foods cannot), and so more attention is paid to the fact that these foods are in many ways still living and growing (or ripening) and can sustain life to a much greater and more vibrant degree than the same food when cooked. However, to be totally accurate about it, the term “Living Food” should only really be applied to foods that are still growing. We’ll talk more about these foods later, but to give you some idea of what I’m talking about think sprouting seeds like alfalfa (which you may have seen in some health food shops, supermarkets or the oc casional shop­bought sandwich or salad), wheatgrass (that grass you may have seen growing in trays in juice bars or the like) and sauerkraut, which, enzymatically at least , is very “alive”. These are just three examples of many."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 9 But What Makes Raw and L iv ing Foods So Special? What’s the Difference? Enzymes are the key differentiator in this whole story. Raw and Living Foods have most if not all of their enzymes intact, and cooked and processed foods have most if not all of their enzymes completely destroyed, which means that they are therefore enzymatically “dead” and therefore of much less use to the body – i.e. inferior rather than superior foods. Why Enzymes Are Not Just A Bonus But An Essential To Life, Health and Vitality Enzymes don’t get much press in the field of nutrition, which is pretty amazing when you learn what they are and what they do, but it’s true nonetheless. In my opinion, as well as asking the obvious nutrition­related questions when deciding what to eat, the just­ as­ equally­important question should be “How many of this food’s enzymes are still alive and intact?” Unfortunately not a lot of research has been done into enzymes, as it is still a new science, and it’s certainly not my intention to bamboozle you with science, but I do need to let you know about some important research that was carried out by eminent enzymologist Dr Edward Howell in the 1930’s. Dr Howell’s research suggested that each of us is born with a finite amount of enzymes in our body (used for a whole variety of purposes, one of which is in the proper digestion of food), and that over the course of our lifetime , just as with a bank account, unless we bring more enzymes into our body from external sources or manufacture our own, then this supply will eventually be used up. [This would explain why seniors often have so many digestive issues]. The only way we can bring more enzymes into our body – apart from via a man­made enzyme supplement – is to get those enzymes through our food. And as you will already have learned from what you’ve read so far, the only way to get enzymes through food is to eat or drink raw and/or living foods. Can you see already how important raw foods are? (And this is before we’ve even got going!) As you might expect, some scientists refute these claims. That’s science. Unfortunately there is not a lot of money to be made in proving that pure natural food is better for you, but it’s hard to deny when you’ve seen it and felt it yourself that people literally do come alive again when they eat increasing amounts of fresh raw food. My intention is for you to start feeling the difference as soon as possible. Fe eling really is believing!"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 10 Feel The Difference My own personal experience of eating raw foods has been nothing short of revolutionary. What b egan as a very excited yet somewhat naïve journey toward radiance in the spring of 1993, aged 20, has evolved into something way beyond what I ever could have anticipated or expected. The way my body, mind and even my emotions have cleaned out, sharpened up and improved in so many more ways than I ever could have predicted, is quite simply beyond words ­ and the journey continues. In fact there are so many benefits to eating raw foods that they beg an entire book of their own! But before I get into the benefits let’s just explore a bit more about why raw foods are superior to their cooked counterparts: This is wh ere it really starts to make some sense. Why Raw Foods Are Superior (a nd Cooked Foods Aren’t!) When we cook we change the chemical structure of whatever it is we are cooking. Think of your school chemistry lessons when you held something over the Bunsen burner. What happened? Sometimes small changes, sometimes rather more dramatic ones. But there were always changes, and you only ever ended up with less than you started with, rather than more. (Plus some pretty acrid smells!) Similarly, when we add fire to food we also change it. It breaks down. It “dies”. It changes into something else, always something less and never something more. Fire can nev er add anything but heat. Fire has only ever destroyed. To give you a clearer idea of how this works, here are some more specific examples of the ways that heat and fire damage the foods we eat. The information below will help make it clear why we could never function at our optimum on a diet high in cooked foods. Proteins: In cooked foods, the proteins (amino acids) become disarrayed through the application of heat. This means that the body struggles to make sense of them – a bit like feeding it some so ftware with some scrambled programming – i.e. not a recipe for truly vibrant health. Carbohydrates: The sugar within cooked carbohydrates is typically not slow releasing like the carbs/sugars in whole raw foods. It becomes so broken down that it passes t hrough the body rather too quickly, causing all sorts of sugar­related issues and imbalances. In fact,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 11 pure refined sugar (a heat­treated product) is one of the most detrimental “foods” (I use the word lightly!) that we can put into our body. It causes untold damage and certainly doesn’t make for a clean, healthy and peaceful body. Fats: Cooked fats – where do we begin?! Cooked fats have been said by many respectable health researchers to be potentially carcinogenic (cancer­causing). Certainly when you taste cooked fat versus raw fat you can taste and FEEL the difference, no question. Raw fats – like avocado, olives, coconut butter, nuts and seeds for example, also, interestingly, have been shown to break down cooked fats when ingested and help rid their rather more toxic cousins from the body. Just for a moment, think about how sticky and rancid­smelling cooked fats are when left an hour or two (think chip fat, lard, any fried or roasted oils) and then try and imagine what the body thinks and feels when those fats come tumbling down the throat and somehow have to be dealt with. Not a pretty picture is it? Fast cut to a vision of raw fats and you’ll already be seeing and feeling an altogether different picture. The body can USE these. In fact it loves them! T hese are the fats we should be eating, not rancid, sticky, glue­like fats that never should have been heated in the first place (What have we been thinking?!). In fact, the more we look at cooked foods up close and personal, the more apparent it becomes that we have been doing something very wrong. Not wrong in the “naughty” sense – we’ve just followed suit from our parents and grandparents and further back still, and have never stopped to question it – but cast your mind back to eons ago, and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that what we first evolved on was pure, organic, fresh, predominantly (at least) raw foods that we may very well have harvested ourselves. Obviously life these days is immeasurably different. Our lives have never been more full, harried or demanding. And our food has never been easier to secure, more diverse, more toxic or more played around with. The two combined aren’t a great mix! Which is why it’s more important than ever to take care of our body – the demands placed on it are pretty extreme in the 21 st century. Taking all of these things into account – that is, being real with how life is today and also painfully aware of all the outside influences that contribute to the food choices we make (friends, family, parents, partners, children, supermarkets, advertising, TV, diet books, magazine articles and so on) – this guide is going to cut through the whole lot for you, enabling you, to whatever degree you desire, to come back into line with the foods that your body loves best, that it thrives on, that it was designed to eat, and that it will not just thank you for, but repay you for in untold ways, many of which are still to be revealed!"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 12 Benefits, Benefits, Benefits... What follows is a list of some of the many benefits you might expect to receive when you “up your game” and increase the number of raw foods in your diet. These are the words of others, not mine, but I do agree with all of them. NB: Yes, the more raw food you eat the more likely you are to experience these benefits! You DO get out what you put IN, but this will give you some idea of what’s possible if you really give it your best shot. 50 Great Reasons To Go Raw 1 “To have unlimited energy” 26 “To increase my clarity” 2 “To reach my natural weight” 27 “To improve my memory” 3 “To support farmers” 28 “To have sharper concentration” 4 “To conserve enzymes” 29 “To raise my vibration” 5 “To rejuvenate / reverse signs of aging” 30 “For spiritual expansion” 6 “To detoxify my body naturally” 31 “To become more vibrant” 7 “To re­create a clean, shiny new me!” 32 “To create a sense of balance” 8 “To strengthen my immune system” 33 “To reawaken my intuition” 9 “To dramatically reduce my chance of disease” 34 “I want to use raw eating as a tool to help me release negative emotions and blocks” 10 “To extend my life span” 35 “I’ve only been raw for a short while but for me it’s the biggest high ever!” 11 “To function at my peak” 36 “I want to reduce my food bills” 12 “To balance my body’s temperature, regardless of external conditions” 37 “I want to break my emotional attachments to foods” 13 “To have eyes that sparkle” 38 “I want to get back in touch with my body and myself” 14 “To have clear skin” 39 “I want to become more calm and collected” 15 “To have young­look ing skin” 40 “It’s environmentally friendly” 16 “To have shiny, glossy hair” 41 “I’m a vegetarian/vegan and this is the next step” 17 “To improve my eyesight” 42 “I want to use less fossil fuel” 18 “Because the food is delicious” 43 “I want those insights people talk about” 19 “I discovered the durian!” 44 “Meal preparation is so easy” 20 “I like to eat truly natural food” 45 “It saves time” “I want to explore a world of taste I never knew existed before” 46 “I want to meet like­ minded people” 22 “I love fruit!” 47 “To lower my fuel bills!” 23 “I love the beautiful colours of raw food” 48 “It’s an exciting adventure” 24 “I want to learn how to become hungry properly” 49 “It will help me achieve my potential” 25 “Because it will help me grow as a person as well as better my health” 50 “Because I love myself”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 13 So What Can YOU Expect? Now, you may well be asking: “How much of this can I expect to feel if I bring, say, an extra salad and a few pieces of fruit into my diet every day?” Well, let me start by telling you this... It’s as much about what you leave out as what you bring in. Allow me to illustrate: Sarah and her twin sister Susan both eat half their daily diet as raw foods. They eat exactly the same raw foods, in exactly the same ways an d at exactly the same time of day. However Sarah is a junk food fan and chooses to make the rest of her meals comprise of fried foods, white flour products (breads, pasta and the like), loves her cheese and also drinks tea and coffee regularly, and has a glass of wine most nights of the week. Susan on the other hand chooses to eat “healthy” cooked foods the rest of the time, eating meals such as organic baked potato with lightly steamed vegetables and perhaps a homemade bean or veggie­ based dish, or buckwheat pasta with a freshly made tomato sauce and wholemeal bread. You get the idea. So obviously Sarah and her sister are eating the same amount of raw foods but the rest of their diet couldn’t be more different. Guess who feels (and looks) better? A no­ brainer, right? So there’s part of your answer. The other part of your answer is to take into account how well you are treating yourself right now in other areas (rest, sleep, exercise, fresh air, sunlight, self ­care etc.) and how you have lived in the past. For instance, those who have struggled ongoingly with health issues and/or medications may take longer to feel measurably better than those who haven’t, but it really is a very personal journey and not always easy to predict as there are so many variables. So it’s about what you leave out as well as what you bring in, and your health history profile."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 14 My own experience was that in spite of growing u p on an almost exclusive ly junk­ food diet, I felt SO much better almost immediately – and that feeling con tinued exponentially as the days, weeks and months went by, that I wanted to talk about it to everyone (not always a good idea). I was bursting to tell people about what I was doing – if only they didn’t think my eating habits were a little weird... (althoug h t hey much admired my weight loss !). Which leads me on to... How to Deal With “Less Than Positive” Comments I’m bringing this up now because it’s very likely that you’re already thinking about what people will say if you give this a bit of a go. Am I right? It’s certainly one of the most common issues people have around eating raw – the social ramifications and whether they’ll suddenly become a social outcast or considered a weirdo! But it’s ironic, don’t you think, that when we try to look after ourselves better (through food especially) that the people around us are often so quick to try and talk us out if it, stand in our way, tempt us, tease us, make life a little bit difficult or just make negative comments that end up derailing us – which we may easily succumb to, if only for an easier life. I often say that if aliens were to land on our planet and observe what we ate, what we considered food and studied the way we look after our most valuable possession, they would run off laughing (or shake their heads in disbelief), and yet our immediate family (typically) think that the more processed and junk food they feed us the more “loving” and “caring” they are being! (But of course we do know that they do mean well...). Time for a little reframing maybe? Well, depending on how far you are already in to your journey to health, you may already have learned that sometimes you just have to keep things to yourself! This may be the 21st century, an age where almost anything seems possible, but to sit down and eat a truly healthy “live” meal is still, sadly, seen by the majority as unconventional, rather anti­social, and unfortunately some people see it as downright weird. This is the reality most of us find ourselves in. Though things are definitely improving – and I don’t doubt for one moment that raw food nutrition is the way things are headed and ARE heading – as yet, this movement towards live nutrition isn’t quite fast enough to allow most of us to eat healthfully without taking some stick for it!"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 15 Now, accepting that as a reality, we have two choices: 1) We make our food choices to please ourselves 2) We make our food choices to please other people (Just remember who has to live with the consequences though!) Yes, there can be a third option if you prefer – a 50/ 50 approach – and this is the approach that, for the start at least I am going to recommend you take. This way you get to feel some of the benefits, and you also get to eat with your family, friends, partner and colleagues without having to listen to all the reasons why “you’re going to fade away eating all that rabbit food” (you’re not) or why “you need a good hearty meal inside you” (you do, just not comprising of meat and potatoes!). That said, if you’re braver than I was and think you can take anything that life or the people in your life throw at you, then by all means set your own pace – this is YOUR life and your plan remember! Do what you’re ready for; this book will guide you either way. In fact it will do more than simply guide you. Throughout this book I will help beat your path and prepare you for the obstacles before you even see them, but what you do with my suggestions is completely up to you. (Just bear in mind that I might just know what I’m talking about!). So ... You know “why raw?”, you know the benefits you can expect to gain, and you know (as you more than likely already guessed) that you may well come under the spotlight for your “strange eating habits” right from the get­go if you make a public announcement. So perhaps you’re now wond ering if there’s any other down sides to all this good stuff that you should know about? I mean... If It’s SO Good Why Isn’t Everyone Doing It? Good question, and it’s one that I asked at the beginning as well (and still do). A lot of it is about lack of information, a lot of it is about assuming that this way of eating equates to boring, unimaginative food (and deprivation) – none of which is true, quite the opposite in fact! – and a lot of it is based on lack of experience. Quite simply, you can’t know in advance how good you can feel until you’ve been there, so it’s very experiential."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 16 It requires a leap of faith to jump into the unknown in any aspect of life, and this is no different. But most of the time, as we have seen, it’s largely all about perception. But before we explore that concept, here’s the real stuff first, so we can get it all out in the open right off the bat: You Have To Give Before You Gain... ∑ You WILL – more than likely – experience some detoxification symptoms as you upgrade your food and automatically push old stuff out. This may not always be pleasant, but you WILL feel better afterwards. (And it doesn’t go on forever!) ∑ You WILL also need to spend some time making some practical changes to the way you shop for food and the way you set up your kitchen, and inevitably will want to read more books or invest more time in learning about your new discovery, but I’m sure you would expect this – and it’s a whole lot of fun! ∑ You WILL also be faced longer­term with the decision as to how much you allow your food choices to impact on your everyday life – such as eating out, when socialising or when travelling abroad, and how all of that will affect the people that feature in your life and your relationship with them. (It has the potential to improve them by the way!) But this really is it, and the last one you do not have to concern yourself with yet – if at all in fact, as you may choose to stick with a certain amount of raw foods that doesn’t impact your life in these ways. It’s all up to you. That’s the “bad news” first. But not too bad really is it? Especially not when you consider what is possible to be gained in return. With this in mind, let’s return to the perception issue before we go one step further... The 3 Questions You Need To Ask Yourself: 1) Is experiencing some short­term detox symptoms (which apparently does not happen to everyone) a small price to pay for my long­term health, vitality and well­being? (Not unlike asking “Is one day cleaning my house from top to bottom worth the effort for a house that looks great, feels clean and is super organised allowing me to live more efficiently from this moment on?”)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 17 2) Is investing some of my time to re­form new habits and ways of doing things and re­ educate myself a small price to pay for a happier mindset around my eating habits, living in a home that reflects “health”, being a more positive influence on those I love, and feeling confident and happy about the choices I have made – not just today but for the long term too? 3) Am I open to the possibility that by cleaning up my diet and dejunking my body and mind of old foods and beliefs about food, I can make better choices in EVERY area of my life that will only ADD to the benefits already experienced through bringing more raw foods into my diet? If you can say ‘Yes’ to all 3 of these things (and I struggle to see why you wouldn’t!), then you are primed and the rest will simply be a case of taking action. If you genuinely feel that you are prepared for some short­term inconvenience for long term gain , then you are most definitely in the right place and I am delighted for you, because not everyone can see beyond today and their next mealtime or cup of coffee. But if you can, then you have the opportunity to sow seeds now that will blossom today, tomorrow and for the rest of your life – and you’ll probably wish you did this sooner! If you can see the logic, are excited by the possibilities and are more than happy to recalibrate in a few all­important ways, then you are absolutely ready to get started and I have no doubt that you can make this work, if you follow the juicy stuff that you’ve now earned the right to have access to! YES! We’re about to get started! I’ve been honest with you up front, you’ve committed to do the work and yes, as promised, I’m going to treat you gently and make this super­easy for you. Let me assure you that this will only affect your life to the degree that you allow it to, and that you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. This is YOUR game, but I will inspire you to stretch yourself a little if you’d like to and want to feel EVEN BETTER than you would if you played it safe. Are you ready to get started? If you are, then please turn over because I’m about to introduce you to the all­important, oh­ so­easy 7 Steps to Going (and Staying) Raw."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 18 The 7 Steps to Going ( and Staying ) Raw Step 1 Understand why “Going Raw is a Whole Person Journey ”. This might not make sense to you now but it will in a moment. Step 2 Food, Glorious Food! Learn about what raw foo d is and isn’t, how to select the best, where to find it and what can be done with it. Step 3 Create a Living Foods Kitchen. Understand the equipment used, what’s right for you, how best to get organised, and how to set yourself up for success so that temptations aren’t there to sabotage your efforts. Step 4 Get Creative! Learn about the various techniques that can transform simple raw foods into pure delights or much more elaborate and comforting drinks and meals such as pizzas, ice­creams, cookies and crackers. Step 5 Raw Food Recipes for Everyday Living. To go raw you need recipes that are quick, easy, fun and delicious with minimum prep and clean­up time. By focussing on great tasting food like this, eating raw is great fun! Step 6 Menu Planning. Knowing what to eat, when to eat it, how to cover all of your nutritional bases, how to get enough variety, and learning about how a great day on raw re ally looks is vital to make the most of eating live. Step 7 Where to Next? Looking good, feeling great ­ so what next? In this final step you move into territory that continues with your raw food journey ­ not just inside the kitchen but also in your life as a whole. Exciting stuff!"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 19 All makes sense and sounds straightforward? It took me over five years to figure out this framework! FIVE years! Let me tell you I am kicking myself that it took me so long because it is SO easy to “get” when you see it all laid out in front to you! So easy in fact, that you can get going with it from day one and never have to wander around aimlessly trying to put all the pieces of the puzzle together like I did for all that time. This model is simple, straightforward and if you follow it step­by­step you’ll be eating more raw foods and loving it in no time at all! Having read through each of the seven steps, can you see now why those small “setting up issues” we looked at a moment ago are such a very small price to pay for looking, feeling and experiencing life in a whole new way? (And not just short term, but for the rest of your life – this is an investm ent !) I do hope so, because it’s the truth! Bottom line: Anything worth having takes a little bit of effort, but you can take or leave whatever you want (although your results will reflect it!) So ... You now know the seven steps to going raw and now I’m going to walk you through each of them. Please note that as this is a “How to Get Started” guide, it will not be a complete in­ depth look at each step (the in­depth stuff will be covered in my forthcoming book Raw Fo od for Beginners ), but it WILL be more than enough to get you going, and that’s what our aim is here: to get you started and to lay the foundations for your journey to exp and if and when you feel ready. What now follows makes up the bulk of this book. Every step will be a separate “teach­in” in and of itself, but do read each step in order for very obvious reasons. Each step is an important building block, preparing the ground for the step that goes after it and also acting as an info­packed resource from this moment on. It will be invaluable for referring back to after you’ve got up and running. Following on from this is “Your One Week Raw Kick­Start Pack” which lays everything out for you as an easy­to­ follow plan covering each of the seven steps including, of course, the menus. Very exciting! It d oesn’t get any easier than this."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 20 Your Journey Starts Here All you need to know at this stage is that you are about to enter a whole new world ­ an exciting and endlessly fascinating world of pure, living food that has the ability to unleash the energy, clarity and vitality that is your birthright and that can and will be yours when you choose life J . Are you ready to immerse yourself into the possibility of looking and feeling better than you’ve ever done before? If ‘yes’ is your answer, then let’s turn over and take a look at Step 1. Borough Market, London, Sept 2006 :: Casey Moore Photography"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 21 Step 1 Understand “Why Going Raw Is A Whole Person Journe y” I really wish I had known this at the start. I thought that when I chose to eat more raw foods I was just signing up for healthier eating. (And perhaps you thought the same!) Some 13+ years ago now, way back in 1993, aged just 20, I was overweight, my skin was pale, my eyes dull, my moods changeable and I lacked energy even though I should (apparently) have been at my prime! The book I read that first introduced me to the concept of raw foods (“Raw Energy” by Leslie Kenton) completely rocked my world and was so inspiring that it left me in no shadow of a doubt that I would explore this world of live food and see if what she was getting excited about could really be true – and off I went! No mention was made, however, either in that book or within the many others that followed, of the other changes that would occur the more I cleaned and freshened up my diet. No one told me, for instance, that I would start to not only look different, but to feel differently (emotionally as well as within my own skin) and even to think differently. No one told me that the changes would run so deep that I would never suspect for one single moment that my dietary changes could be held responsible. No one explained to me that when you clean up the inside you want to clean up the outside too, and that tolerations in life can quite quickly go from being “put up with” to being completely unacceptable. So when this happened and I found myself feeling as if I was being quietly yet rather profoundly transformed, I really didn’t know what was going on! Was it the self ­help books I was reading? (No, they were a symptom, not a cause; I had never read a personal development book until I got into raw foods). Was it just my age – a growing up thing? (No, I later found out, this happ ens to everyone who gives raw food a go past a certain point, regardless of age). Was it just the fact that I’d moved to London and was mixing with bigger thinkers and “movers and shakers”? (No, they weren’t thinking the same thoughts and feeling the same feelings that I was, and they certainly weren’t – for the most part – experiencing the same level of health, energy and weig ht loss that I was beginning to)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 22 Eventually, I realised it really wa s all to do with the food I was eating. Say what? How co uld this be? I had tried healthy eating in the past but had never experienced this kind of thing before. So how could eating my food raw affect me so completely and on so many levels? Finally, after speaking with many others who were dabbling like me, it bec ame abundantly clear that our experiences were exactly the same. I had to accept the fact: yes, it was the food – but how and why ? Well, I’m going to keep this simple, but the bottom line is that when you start eating more raw foods you are automatically displacing the old, cooked, processed and junky stuff that has been lurking in your body, in your tissues and cells – often for years! As mentioned earlier, you are literally replacing dead, often toxic, not­ideal­ for­human­consumption matter with fresh, live and (hopefully) organic foods that your body just loves and craves. Consequently as the “good stuff” starts to seriously compete with the “not­so­good stuff” in terms of how much of each is going in and how much is already inside you, you simply cannot fail but to feel a shift, because you are altering your biochemistry with every single piece of fresh food that goes in. Yes, your entire physical make­up is being upgraded and replaced with far superior building materials – and you are going to feel the difference! How co uld you not, really? Simultaneously, as the dead matter leaves, you will, most likely, start to experience the detoxification symptoms alluded to earlier. Can these be avoided? No, not really. Most people will feel something (such as headaches, light­ headedness, diarrhoea, skin outbreaks and suchlike), although you can certainly slow the process (more later). After all, what’s going on is pure chemistry. You are displacing the old stuff with the new and IT WILL SHOW ITSELF as it leaves. This bears repeating. It will show itself as it leaves."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 23 I highlight this point because occasionally people will freak out and think that the raw food is somehow doing them harm! They think that because suddenly they are experiencing unpleasant symptoms and the only thing that’s changed is the food they’re eating, then it has to be that! Well, of course t hat’s right but also very WRONG. As just explained, it’s what you’ve eaten (and have also taken in through other sources such as toxic toiletries and medicines) in the past that is the contributor, not the food you are bringing in now. It has to come out at some point and it won’t just vanish into thin air! The best analogy for this whole process that I can possibly use is this: Imagine a pond. This pond is the metaphor for your body. Now, take a look at this pond and notice how, while on the surface it looks pretty clear (maybe not crystal­like but clear enough to look inviting), if you look below the surface you can see what looks like a fair amount of dirt, slime and junk floating around! Dip your arm into the water and swish it around a little, and beyond this you can now in fact see a very thick underlying layer of dirt right the way down to the bottom. Eugh! Not so inviting now, perhaps, for that swim you had in mind is it?! Now imagine that the world’s biggest downpour starts to happen. Rain upon rain falls down onto the pond – and at quite a pace and intensity too – and as it does, so the pond starts to change. Initially the top layer starts to dance around a little. Things look lively as the rain hits the surface and causes some ripples and splashing. Then it gets heavier and the movement goes a little deeper. As this happens the pond starts to look both cleaner AND dirtier all at the same time! How could this be? Quite simply, the top layer is being replaced with cleaner water that is the rain, and at the same time the dirtier layer just below the surface is now coming up as the rain starts to permeate it. As the rain continues and gets heavier and heavier, naturally more and more of the junk starts to come up. In fact , at one point the pond looks absolutely filthy! However, slowly but surely as the amount of new, clean rain that’s fallen starts to exceed the amount of old pond water remaining, the whole look o f the pond starts to transform."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 24 And this continues on and on until none of the old pond water remains, and the pond that exists now consists SOLELY of the new, clean, pure rain water that you can look into and see all the way through f rom the very surface level all the way to the bottom of the pond and yes, it looks cryst al clear and very swim mable! Needless to say this analogy is perfectly in line with what happens in our body when we start to replace our old “cooked body” with fresh, clean, pure ingredients in the form of raw food and clean water. The more pure foods we eat, the better we look and feel, but yes, until a certain point this may also be alternated with periods where we don’t look and feel as good as we did – but this is only because we’re experiencing what has been lingering just below the surface for the past few weeks, months or years! Continue long enough and as with the pond, your body also will become clean and clear to the point where you wouldn’t be afraid to look deep into it and see everything that’s there – after all it’s pure physics! Quite a vision don’t you think? Imagine being able to feel that clean and confident that your body not only loo ked good but also sm elt good (breath gets fresher, skin changes its natural fragrance to one much sweeter), felt good (skin gets softer, hair gets silkier), and even tasted better (I’ll leave that one to your imagination!) and wasn’t harbouring junk for the future that would surely one day catch up with you? Returning to the “whole person journey” point, perhaps now it’s not so hard to see why changing what you eat can also cause a ripple effect through other layers of your being too? After all, each of us is comprised of four different aspects – mind, body, spirit and emotion. And when we upgrade our food choices and affect ourselves at a cellular level, then the quality of thoughts we think, the emotions we feel and even the level of “connectedness” we feel to ourselves and the world as a whole cannot fail but to upgrade at the same time. As everything is so interconnected, it just has to be this way, whether we believe it, expect it, aspire to it ­ or not! Quite a concept isn’t it? As I said earlier, this is the bit I wish I had been taught at the start. I may not have been able to fully comprehend it at the time, but it wasn’t very long into my experimentation with raw and living foods that I began to have a first­hand experience of this in action and I really could have done with some kind of explanation! Now you have it. Personally, I think this is one of the very best aspects of “going raw”. The life I lead now, the way I look, think and feel in myself are incomparable to the way I was when I first got into eating this way. And I really wouldn’t change it for the world."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 25 Was it an easy journe y? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Any path of growth has its highs and lows – that’s what makes it a journey worth making – but not once have I regretted choosing this way rather than the path I was headed along – that had been beaten down for me by my parents, grandparents and peers and anyone else who was eating “normally”. And you don’t need me to tell you how unhealthy eating normally is these days. It may be normal, but it certainly ain’t natural! And it certainly isn’t a recipe for vibrant health – we only have to look around us to see that. So let’s take a look at what is! It’s time for Step 2."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 26 Step 2 Food, Glorious Food I’d like to begin by busting a myth. “But Isn’t Raw Food Boring...?” A lot of people think that eating raw foods alone must be “boring”, and you may also be thinking the same thing too! Well, first of all, it can be – if done what I’ll call “wrong” (more later). It can also be boring if you don’t know what you’re doing. It can also be boring if you don’t know what foods are there waiting to be explored and enjoyed. It can also be boring if you’re heart’s not in it and it can be positively challenging if you’re expecting it to comfort you and sedate you like cooked foods do. Yes, eating all raw food can be boring, but only for those who do not take the time and energy to explore the possibilities – which is what we’re about to do here! The truth is, and this has been my own experience, eating raw foods is fun, liberating, exciting and limitless! Although I didn’t have the first clue about what raw foods were and which foods fell into the “raw zone” when I first came across the concept, I did at least know an apple from an orange and I had seen (although not tried) an avocado and so knew there were at least some foods I had yet to explore! But again, there was no book listing out all those raw foods for me. No book telling me what was raw, what wasn’t and which raw foods were best. In fact, I’m still not sure that book exists – or at least, not until now. But before I list out all the raw foods you have waiting to be explored, I’m going to introduce you to the Raw Food Groups. Up until now you can certainly be forgiven for assuming that raw food equalled lots of fruit and veg and a few mung beans and a few pumpkin seeds thrown in if you’re lucky(!), and therefore equalled maybe three, four or five food groups at the most (“W hat about meat and dairy? Are they raw?”). Well, I’m going to cut to the chase now and show you what the staggering 20+ raw food groups are, and then we’ll take a look at the meat and dairy question ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 27 The Raw Food Groups 1. Fresh fruits 2. Vegetables 3. Salad vegetables 4. Leafy green vegetables 5. Herbs and wild greens 6. Nuts 7. Dried fruits 8. Beans, p ulses and legumes (sprouted) 9. Grains (sprouted) 10. Seeds 11.

Stimulants (e.g. garlic, onion, mustard) 20. Spices 21. Flavourings and sweeteners 22. Superfoods 23. Misc. other raw goodies And then there’s the all ­ important vital ingredient – water!"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 28 Any surprises? If you’re anything like I was, this list will look a little bit overwhelming at first with so many new foods to get to know. “Sprouted what? What are algaes? Isn’t that the green stuff you scoop off a lake? And what on earth are indoor greens?” All will be revealed! But first ... So What About Meat and Da iry? Yes, you can find raw meat and dairy in some shops and stores, but most meats aren’t good enough quality to eat raw (so you’d have to cook them for them to be safe to eat) and most dairy is pasteurised (i.e. cooked). So by default most meat and dairy is not raw. That said, here are two things: 1) I do not eat or recommend anyone eats raw meat . I t can be highly dangerous if you dabble on your own (people have died) and also the body has a tough time handling meat at the best of times. So, yes, I advise people to stay clear. If you fancy trying it for whatever reason, then make sure you have it in a restaurant where they know what they’re doing, but from a health perspective, forget it! And besides, even the thought of it for most of us is not very attractive, so that says something in and of itself , don’t you think? 2) Raw dairy is a very separate issue. There are some people who believe that we must absolutely have some animal produce in our diet – even if just a tiny bit – to stay optimally well. There are also others who maintain that we can live on an animal­ free (vegan) diet and thrive beyond anything previously thought possible. Personally speaking, my jury is out. I have seen people do better without it and others apparently improve with it, so I do not make recommendations here other than to suggest that you take things slowly and do what feels right when it feels right. Yes, I personally felt markedly better when I dropped dairy from my diet after 20+ years of blowing my nose every day (even better, actually, than when I gave up meat in January 1992), and dairy has never seemed to suit me even since babyhood, but I have come across a number of people who swear that they can eat raw vegan foods to a point and then they feel very strongly that they must have some raw goat’s cheese or similar in order to stay feeling good. So, do what feels right for you and then, if you feel you’d lik e to, experiment with removing one or both of these food groups from your diet and see how you feel."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 29 Now, I realise that this may be quite a way down the line from where you may be with your diet right now, but I’m telling you this now as it will come up pretty quickly for you. If you eat meat now, you may choose to cut down. If you eat a lot of dairy and suffer from a lot of nasal, breathing or virus­related health problems , then you will definitely benefit from cutting dairy way down or even completely out of your diet. In due course you will naturally feel drawn to make other changes as you go, as you start to become more in touch with your body and its genuine wants and needs in its quest towards vibrant health. And sometimes this may mean cutting things out completely, sometimes adding new things in, sometimes lowering the amounts and/or frequency, and so on. But for now, we’re going to focus on just getting more raw stuff in! So, you now know what the raw food groups are. Perhaps the diversity has surprised you a little. It certainly did me! I could only think of fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetables when I first started. No wonder I couldn’t see how it was possible to eat completely raw! (Which I do now, pretty much, give or take the odd thing or two.) Be fore I give you the complete list of raw foods sorted by genre, I just want to reiterate that while I use the terminology “go raw” and “all raw” throughout these pages, I use this lightly as you will be different to another reader in terms of where you are starting from and where you want to go. So, bear with me and know that when I speak of “go raw” that doesn’t mean “go all the way”, it simply means “eat more raw than you do now” – okay? Right, let’s take a good long look at the list then! On the pages that follow you will find a vast (but not exhaustive) shopping list of individual foods sorted by raw food group. This list serves two purposes. First, it will give you an idea of the full extent of raw foods commonly available to buy or source in England today (but don’t worry it should apply to most ot her Westernised countries too). Second, it’s for your own personal use to use as an ongoing shopping list by which to mark your own personal likes, dislikes and ‘want to trys’. Simply date this exercise and tick the appropriate boxes to signify how you currently feel about each of the foods. If there are any foods where you’ve ticked the ‘want to try’ box and you’re especially keen, use your pen to highlight these – you can make these your priority buys later."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 30 Raw Ingredients Shopping List (Sorted By Genre) Dislike Like Never tried Want to try Fruits Apple Apricot Asian pear Avocado

(I recommend that you set yourself the challenge of trying at least two new foods per week as you work on upping your raw food intake – but only go for ones that appeal to you!) So. Now you know what foods are available to you, where are you going to find these foods and how will you know which ones are good buys, taste good or are of good enough quality for you? All these questions and more are answered next."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 42 What To Do With Your List Now That You Have It Knowing what foods are available to you is one thing, knowing where to get them, what to do with them and how to eat them is of course entirely another! While there’s no way on earth I could cover everything in that regard here in this one publication, I am going to walk you through where to start with your shopping, how to pick the best and freshest produce (and at the lowest prices) and suggest how to start bringing some of those new foods in to yo ur life at an everyday, easy­to­integrate level. Let’s start with the shopping, because you have to know where to get hold of this stuff! Where To Shop Good news! Even if you live in the smallest village in the middle of nowhere, in this day and age of internet and mail order, nothing is out of your reach. And if you are a regular supermarket shopper then the second piece of good news is that you don’t need to look elsewhere for your food (or at least not most if it), especially if yours is really well stocked up on organic, fresh produce and good quality dried goods like nuts, seeds and beans for sprouting. Of the 20+ raw food groups listed your supermarket should be able to cover some of the foods contained within at least 80% ­ if not more – of the groups, so this is as good as you need to get started. More good news! And if you want to e xplore further afield, as I encourage you to do – and which will also gift you with even better quality foods and possibly at lower prices in some cases – then either now or at a later date consider any or all of the following: ∑ Health food shops ∑ Farm shops ∑ Whole food warehouses ∑ Roadside stalls∙ ∑ Specialist food shops, including Asian and Oriental ∑ Mail order companies ­ including internet based ∑ Farmers markets ∑ Cafés, take­aways or juice bars ∑ Local markets ∑ Food or juice booths ∑ Local greengrocers ∑ Organic box schemes ∑ Pick­your­own ∑ Live events and exhibitions Quite a range as you can see, and each one quite different."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 43 By all means visit one or some of these types of outlets as soon as you feel so inclined, but don’t feel it’s necessary right away. You’re here to get started, you can have fun diversifying once you’ve got the basics down and then an even bigger world will open up to you! And if you’re feeling really adventurous ... Food for Free I’m sure I’m not alone in wishing that food was still as free as it used to be, once upon a time. Unfortunately, as we all very much realise, most of the food we eat these days comes at a price, if not to our health, then at least to our pocket. Of course, some of you may have your own garden, allotment, or even orchard, and you will already be enjoying the fruits of your labour (you lucky people!). For those of you who lead a more urban or busy lifestyle, here’s some alternatives: Foraging Foraging is the term used to describe “gathering”, as in the hunting and gathering of old. Wherever you live, chances are that nearby, likely in an area you’ve never looked twice at, there are a whole variety of natural wild greens, edible flowers, mushrooms, and even berries or other fruits all ripe for the picking. All you need to get started down this route is some spare time, a carrier bag, a box or bowl for berries or delicate foods, such as flowers, and a guidebook. The latter is especially useful when it comes to picking mushrooms and flowers ­ s ome of them are poisonous, so be careful. Good places to visit are parks, fields, some wastelands, and woodlands, and anywhere else that is relatively green and open. Local to us there are lots of blackberry bushes as well as apple trees along the farm lane where I currently live. At my last home, on an arable farm just 10 minutes away, there were copious amounts of dandelion leaves and nettles, several plum trees, an apple tree, a pear tree and yet more blackberry bushes. You just don’t know what’s around until you go actively looking. Other People’s Produce Perhaps you have a friend, relative or neighbour who grows their own produce, but has too much of it? This is ve ry common amongst those with allotments who grow food for the fun of it but then have masses of excess produce which they are happy to give away. If, despite asking around, you cannot find someone who fits this description there’s nothing to stop you advertising! It could be as simple as placing a postcard in a local shop window stating what you’re looking for. You can say you’re happy to pay for any locally grown produce that"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 44 needs a good home, and you may well need to, but it’s going to be at a fraction of what you’d pay in the shops (and will no doubt taste a whole lot better), and you might even find they're simply happy for it to go to a good home. Definitely worth a shot. Fruit Picking or Wo rk Exchange There’s always plenty of opportunities to work on a farm, in a vineyard or similar in return for free food and accommodation. It may not suit you or your lifestyle if you’re a parent, or with little free time, but if you’re young, free and single it could be the perfect working holiday, or a great way to see the world while travelling from one farm to the next! As you can see there are no end to the places to go to find all the new foods you could possibly want. To find suppliers local to you, here’s some ideas to set you off on the right track. How To Find New Suppliers or Shops Near You ∑ UK: Consult the Yellow Pages directory (also available online at www.yell.com) ∑ Search the internet using a search engine such as www.google.com ∑ UK: Consult The Organic Directory (search it online via www.whyorganic.org) ∑ Ask around ­ friends, family, neighbours, chat groups on the internet ∑ Keep an eye out in local papers for new shops, pick­your­own etc. ∑ Take a fresh look at the places you already visit, visiting aisles you normally rush by, or shops you normally walk past (sometimes you can find some really yummy condiments in the herbs & spices section, such as sun­dried tomatoes in oil, tamari, olive paste and so on. These aren’t usually raw but they’re great for those transitioning or who aren’t purists). ∑ Look out for delivery vans passing by and note down their telephone number! ∑ Follow links from one web site to another ∑ Take a look at www.fresh­network.com – you’ll find lots of great links and listings in the resources section"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 45 What To Look For As obvious as it may sound, the best quality food you can afford is of premium im portance. In the early days I made the rather silly mistake (looking back at it) of thinking that I could thrive on non­organic raw food which was not a very logical conclusion! Sure, I was eating way more fresh produce than ever before in my life, but because it was non­ organic I was also eating more pesticides than at any other stage in my life! So yes, organic is important . And while I know that having easy access to good quality organic food varies wildly from place to place and country to country, thanks to mail order this option is now open to most, if not all of us. And yes, although more expensive generally speaking, it is most definitely worth it, and you will find the more nutrient­dense your food is, the less you need to eat. Remember you are investing in your number one most important investment – your body and its future health. You WILL get out what you invest in it, in more ways than one. Freshness is also just as important. Did you know that as soon as a food is picked it starts losing some of its nutritional value right away? Same thing when you peel something. Just think then how low in nutrition those foods are that are stored for weeks (if not months) in cold storage before being presented to us on our supermarket shelves. Hmmm. Not a great tho ught. So where does this leave us? Well, not many of us are in the position of being able to grow all our own food, or even have access to freshly grown and harvested food (but if you are then brilliant!). So for those who don’t, let’s take a look at the n ext best thing: 1) Access as much truly fresh food as you can somehow. The most obvious sources are from relatives, allotments growers with excess produce, farmers markets and pick­ your­own. Some organic growers offer speedy mail order delivery which is a go od option. 2) You CAN grow your own sprouts and indoor greens and these provide absolutely first­rate nutrition. Even if you only did this one thing alone (and ate them!) you would look and feel many times better than you do now. (I’ll be teaching you how later.) 3) Buy as much locally sourced produce as possible . This generates less food miles and more often than not will mean that your food is fresher as it’s likely travelled direct from grower to vendor. This is the best we can hope to do in our busy modern lives, but it’s a great improvement on where most of us came from, I’m sure. With regard to the rest of the produce, then you need to make sure that you’re eating the most nutrition­dense foods possible and in sufficient amounts to pave the way for glowing natural health. More about what these are later!"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 46 Vibrancy is the third item on our list in terms of what to look for when shopping. Do you know how to tell a ripe mango or avocado from an unripe one? Did you know that in many cases organic can mean “orga nically grown” but doesn’t necessarily mean that the produce hasn’t been dipped in unhealthy chemicals AFTERWARDS? Yes, there is a lot to learn and with it comes the awareness that the food industry is n ot quite as health­ friendly as it could be (a slight understatement), so again, let’s work with things as they currently are and do the best we can. To do this we need to employ all five senses. So... How To Selec t The Best Fresh Produce SIGHT – Generally we can tell just by looking at a food if it is good or not, but things like chemicals we cannot see with our bare eyes. What we can see though, is: Colour – As a general rule of thumb, the brighter and/or deeper the colour the more nutrient­dense and ripe that food is. Size – Bigger doesn’t always mean better, but with tropical fruits it often does (although these are generally only found in their native countries). Small tomatoes often taste better than the big ones, much sweeter and tastier; berries too; but if a fruit is unnaturally small for its kind , then that may mean it’s inferior or on its way out. So this is a case­by­case scenario. Shape – Truly good organic food is often irregular in shape but these foods often don’t make the shelves for this reason. They are not “perfect” looking enough and so therefore don’t make the grade. Visit any good organic farm shop and you’ll see lumps and bumps and other irregularities, but my goodness you’ll know that looks don’t matter when you taste them and feel how much more real they are in every sense of the word! Life! – Sometimes you can just see that produce is looking healthier or more alive than others. Think limp lettuce versus perky pepper! Other visual signs ­ Food does actually speak to us via its own language. Yes really! Think about it for a moment... Bananas go speckled when ripe. Bell peppers go from green, to yellow, to orange to red as they ripen to perfection (not a lot of people know that). Melons round out a little more, and when perfectly ripe look as if they might burst open. Conversely look out for the less­positive signs, such as those of unripeness (green­ness) and mould or decay (white or brown). None of these you want. You want robust, sparkling, “come and get me” kinds of foods that will impart some of what they’ve got to you!"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 47 SMELL – Fresh fruits should smell, but many don’t. A lot of this is down to the miles they have travelled, being picked while unripe and being kept in storage too long and at too cool temperatures. So try to select fruits that do have a good natural scent wherever possible. This is most likely to be possible with some good quality mangoes, tomatoes, red bell peppers, some pineapples, some melons and bananas. This list is by no means the definitive guide, but it is my experience here in the UK. Of course local and seas onal is going to be best. TOUCH – What the eyes can’t see and the nose cannot smell, the fingers can feel. And picking up and squeezing your food is also hugely important. This is especially true with fruits which, generally speaking , need to “melt” a little when you squeeze them – that is to “give” a bit with gentle pressure but not stay dented! Good examples are avocadoes, mangoes and oranges. SOUND – Yes, we can use our hearing to detect good food! That doesn’t mean to wait for your apples to sing or your sweetcorn to hum, but in the case of melons – the perfect example – if you tap your potential purchase with your fist while holding it to your ear you are listening out for a dull thud. If it sounds weak or tinny, it’s not yet ripe – put it back and try again! And finally – TASTE . Well that’s the ultimate test but not always practical in a shop setting , which is why you have to learn how to rely on your other three or four senses. But if you CAN get to taste the foods before you buy, then of course, go right ahead and use your finest sense of all to make your buying decisions for you. So that’s how to select the best fresh produce, but what about all the other raw foods like nuts, seeds, olives, dried herbs and spices, oils and all the raw foods that come in a bottle, packet or jar? How To Selec t The Best Dried / Pre­Packaged Produce Organic and fresh always need to remain your priority however your raw foods show up, but there’s a lot about food that we don’t have a clue about until we start investig ating and what I have discovered along the way is this: Nuts. The best way to buy nuts is in their shells, but when this isn’t possible then buy de­ shelled nuts that are as whole, unchipped and unmarked as possible. And when you’ve bought them they should ideally be kept in the fridge, as their oils can go rancid, especially"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 48 when out of the shell. Yes, it’s true, some “raw” nuts are heat treated, Brazils and cashews being the most likely suspects, but personally I do not let this become too much of an issue. Having seen some people become what others might regard as a little too neurotic about whether their “raw” nuts are truly raw, I think it far better to eat these foods even if they’re lightly heat treated than not to eat them at all. Seeds. These tend to be a lot hardier, and less prone to rancidity than nuts, so just going for organic, generally speaking should take care of making a good choice. Olives . Perhaps surprisingly most olives are not raw. They are often pasteurised during the bottling process and usually highly treated to make them palatable (natural olives are very bitter), are bottled in brine (salt water) and often with a preservative mixed in. If you’ve tasted truly raw olives you’ll know that there really is no comparison, and if you hav en’t then you’re in for a treat. NB: To my kn owledge truly raw olives are only available by mail order in the UK, but the brand “Olives et Al” are the best of the rest available in shops UK­wide with minimal processing and are great tasting too. Dried herbs and spices . These are subjected to heat in order to dry them out, however, you will use so little of them in your “un­cooking” that in my opinion it’s really not worth getting too excited about that fact! Sea vegetables. These are sometimes heated sometimes not. Not very helpful, so you may have to read the packet carefully or ask the vendor or manufacturer. In the case of nori sheets, one of my personal favourites, you need to go for purple/black sheets rather than green (the opposite way to what you might think). The green is toasted and doesn’t taste as good either. Oils . Most oils are heat treated to some degree, yes, even the ones that say “cold pressed”. It’s all to do with the amount of heat generated during the processing – the temperatures can get quite high and so the oil ends up being quite a different product than it would have been if the extraction method was a lot more gentle. There are oils on the market that are produced with minimal heat, and yes, again, you will most definitely taste t he difference, but these are a lot more expensive and harder to get hold of, so to start with just go for virgin, cold­pressed organic oils and this will be a huge step in the right direction. So that’s the pre­packed stuff. Anything not mentioned here is relatively problem­free to find, and if you use the “raw and organic” rule as your main criteria for selection then, generally speaking, you can’t go too far wrong."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 49 So now that you know what to buy, where to get it and how to choose the best, you’ll definitely be wanting to make sure you get the most “bang for your buck”, so here are some tips for obtaining the best raw foods at the lowest prices. Buying On A Budget Eating more raw organic foods can work out one of three ways: ∑ More expensive ∑ Cheaper ∑ About the same! As per your current way of eating, it really all depends on how much convenience foods you currently buy, the amounts you buy and what raw foods you choose to put in their place. Also, of course, how much of it you grow yourself. The most ex pensive raw foods are typically the tropical fruits and the out of season fruits, and the more fancy unusual raw foods such as cacao (chocolate) powder, superfoods and specialist foods like the raw nut butters, tahini etc. And yes, organic foods are generally more expensive than non. That said, there are always ways and mea ns of getting cut­price produce; it just takes a bit of time and effort to shop around; but once you've found some good suppliers, you’re well on your way to saving what can often be substantial amounts of money. Here follow some ideas which, without exception, will pay dividends, both in terms of time and money: ∑ Pooling resources with others is an excellent way to save time and money. You can bulk buy, pool your knowledge, and also take it in turns to do the shopping or ordering. You’ll also find that when you order with other people you'll likely try new foods you might not have tried otherwise and discover some really lovely new ingredients or main meal staples. ∑ Grow as much of your own produce as possible . If you don’t have the space or time to get into gardening on any great scale, you can still grow plenty of sprouts and indoor greens which can save you a small fortune (one woman I know cut her food bill by a third by swapping meat for sprouts). Also, as you have already learned, sprouted beans, seeds and grains also supply some of the most live and potent nutrients you will ever find, and for next to nothing in many cases."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 50 ∑ Freeze any bananas that are speckled but not yet black if you’re not going to get through them before they turn. Take the skin off and put in the freezer – within a few hours you’ll have the basic ingredient for a great raw ice­cream or frozen lolly. Do the same with other fresh fruit – most fruits translate excellently into ice­cream at a later date. ∑ One of the best tips for saving money on a regular basis is to find out when your favourite shops mark down their produce . Typically supermarkets have a day where they reduce prices on fresh goods by up to 90%, and you can find some real bargains. You just have to know when these days are and what times are best. The quickest way to find out? Just ask one of the checkout assistants. ∑ When it comes to buying books or equipment, look out for decent second hand pieces in the small ads section of your local paper, online, through e­bay, at car boot sales or through the classifieds section of Get Fresh! magazine . ∑ And finally, don’t forget the food for free options , listed earlier and to explore all the other shopping possibilities until you find your perfect match and ideal price points. Just enjoy exploring the foods and their endless possibilities and you will intuitively come to know a good buy when you see one! So now you know your “onions” it’s time to move into the room where you’ll be storing them and working your magic on them."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 51 Step 3 Creating a Living Foods Kitchen How is your kitchen looking right now? If you were an outsider, someone who had never visited your home before and who knew nothing about you, what conclusions do you think you would come to purely by walking into your kitchen and scanning the horizon? Just think about that for a moment ... I ask you because really, our kitchens, like every other room of our house, can speak volumes about our relationship to our home but moreover about our relationship to ourselves, and as far as our kitchen goes, to our body and our food. Ponder on that one for a moment and you might start to notice a direct correlation between the way a room looks and your relationship to whatever function that room provides. So, as far as your kitchen is concerned, take a look. Is there clutter? If so, where is it and how much is there? How many gadgets, tools, bowls, baking trays and cooking equipment are never used and/ or are hanging out gathering dust? How much of your kitchen is functional? How well is it o rganised and how efficient does this make you at meal time? How does it look? Does it inspire you when you get home f rom work or walk into it to prepare food? Does it say “life” or does it say something a little closer to “death”?! Although most people’s kitchens seem to act as in­trays for all sorts of life’s “stuff”, it may well be that your kitchen is absolutely spotless. In which case you will most probably have a very easy time going raw as your space is perfect for preparing lots of fresh food and you know exactly where everything is and most likely have a very high level of functionality. On the other hand, your kitchen might be tidy because you’re a “throw it in the microwave and throw away the rest” kind of person (or have been!) in which case you’ll already have realised that you and your kitchen are in for a bit of a change! Yes, there’s no doubt about it, your kitchen is where all the action happens, and making sure that it supports you and your goals is not just a good idea but absolutely imperative. But the good news is, when you sort your kitchen out and get it looking all clean and tidy, and all shiny and new, there really isn’t a lot to beat that feeling, especially when you can make yourself a big fat juice at the end of it!"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 52 The Perfect Live Food Kitchen In this section we will take a look at the following: 1) Kitchen equipment. What’s what and which piec es are right for you? 2) How to set your kitchen up fo r success . This means making it efficient in space and functionality so that you can save time and hassle, and it’s also about making it inspiring to look at and supportive , directly and indirectly, of your health goals and aspirations. 3) How to respect the wishes and needs of those you share your home with (and how to create a win­win situation so that everyone is happy). Just these three things will have you set up and raring to go so that when you start bringing the new foods and ingredients into your life you’ll already be set up and have the space and ideal environment to work with them in. Let’s get started. A Beginners Guide to “Raw Kitchen Equipment” I want to make it clear right from the start t hat to eat healthy food you do not NEED any kitchen equipment other than a chopping board and a good sharp knife. However, you probably know as well as I do that food is much more fun when it’s been played around with a bit and made into something a little more interesting than a pile of raw ingredients! Don’t get me wrong. Sometimes there is nothing more satisfying and enjoyable than a whole fresh ripe melt­in­the­mouth mango eaten just as it is. Or a big bowl of juicy green grapes. Or a multi­coloured , multi­textured fresh fruit salad or a couple of perfectly ripe bananas. But by and large most of the time we may feel as if we want something “more substantial” or at least something a little more prepared, especially when this is brand new territory. We want to explore it to the max right? So, I’m going to begin by listing the most common pieces of kitchen equipment typically employed in a raw food kitchen, starting with my top 3 must­haves. What you choose to take on board will, of course, all depend on how excited you are, how eager you are to explore the possibilities and yes, how much cash you have at your disposal, because if you’re really going for it, then be prepared ­ the best of this stuff isn’t all that cheap!"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 53 The 3 Piece s of Kitchen Equipment You Should Ideally Own The first piece of equipment on my list and the first one I ever invested in (only £25 but it was a big deal to me at the time) is a JUICER . (The one pictured here is my current favourite, the Champion. Slightly more expensive at around £259!) Now, as you may or may not know, juicers now come in a whole range of shapes and sizes and also carry vastly different price tags. I’ll give you a good run down about juicers in a moment. The next most important piece of equipment to my mind is the good old BLENDER . By this I mean one of those jugs that sits on a base and turns ingredients into a soup, smoothie or dressing. The one pictured here is the Vita­Mix TNC, the best blender in the world as far as I’m aware, and I couldn’t be without one, but it’s also the most expensive! (You don’t have to own one of these, but if you have money to spare then you won’t regret it if you do decide to invest in one – they’re around £395. Yikes!) Again, we’ll take a closer look at blenders in a moment. The third piece of equipment I think you should own, although you can definitely wait a while if necessary, is a FOOD PROCESSOR . Pictured here is my favourite, the Cuisinart, again a brilliant machine, but pricey (around £269). But don’t be put off! I use what I consider to be the best as this is my lifestyle ongoingly and I also teach classes as well. It’s always best to start simply as I did – you can buy a good machine for a few pounds or pick one up second hand, often unused, for under £10, but you’ll find having one in your kitchen invaluable. So that’s my top three. Nothing weird or wacky there! And many homes will already own at least one or two of these items already. Moving into the other category, the “nice to have but not absolutely vital” cate gory, are the: ∑ Personal blender ∑ Hand blender ∑ Nut mill (commonly known as a coffee grinder) ∑ Nut milk bag ∑ Nut milk maker ∑ Ice­cream maker ∑ Dehydrator"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 54 ∑ Sprouting equipment such as jars, bags, trays, an automatic sprouter, and/or a wheatgrass kits ∑ Mandoline ∑ Spiral slicer ∑ Zester ∑ And finally, a Metric Wonder Cup All of these WILL add a certain something to your kitchen, but they’re things that you can definitely do without and/or improvise on in the early days until you ascertain whether you’d actually make use of them. I’ll talk about each of these in a moment also. So, all told that’s 19 items! Some are large, some are small, and most or all of them you can pick up at bargain prices if you buy second­hand or on eBay. Although many of these items may be new to you, I can assure you that none of them are complicated to use and all of them will help you eat more healthily, no question. In fact some people will sell their microwave, cooking pans and even their oven to make way for more of the above, as well as to generate the extra cash to invest in the best! But for now, we’re going to start at ground zero and take a look at the whole spectrum of appliances, starting with the most common. As you read through each of them, chances are that just from reading what they’re capable of doing you’ll know instinctively which ones will be right for you – but don’t panic! YES, you can get away with any two of the first three and feel tremendous benefits; you don’t have to turn your kitchen into “gadget city” to be healthy! T he “Raw Kitchen Equipment” Guided Tour Juicers Main uses: Juicing, homogenising (making nut butters, purées, pâtés, baby foods, ice­ cream, etc.) Juicers come in all shapes, sizes and prices, and you can opt for either electrically or manually operated machines. Manual juicers are designed primarily to juice wheatgrass, hard fruits and vegetables and other grasses or leafy greens. They are compact, with prices starting from around £25 for a small plastic model, working up to around £100 for the stainless steel types, but are quite laborious to use, owing to having to turn the handle over"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 55 and over to extract the juice. Although the exertion aspect of these juicers can be off ­ putting, they area actually excellent juicers and a great choice if you are not short on time or energy, often go travelling, and/or are working to a budget. Electric juicers start from around £30 for a centrifugal model. These cheaper juicers are usually circular or oval­shaped, quite compact and very easy to use, with a jug (of limited capacity) for collecting juice underneath or to the side. These are good for juicing all fruits and most vegetables, though will do very little or nothing at all with leafy greens, herbs and grasses such as wheatgrass. These models can be found in any High Street electrical store. The next step up is a larger centrifugal model with a bigger container and greater efficiency and speed. I consider these to be useful but limited, reasoning that if you’re going to pay that bit extra, you may as well go all the way and upgrade to a homogenising juicer which is multi­purpose and offers much more than simple juicing options. These ‘all­singing­all­ dancing’ models typically cost anything from £150. Well known examples of homogenising juicers are the Samson, Champion , Green Star and the Green Power. All but the Champion juice all fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, herbs and grasses. The Champion copes admirably with everything except herbs and grasses which just end up wrapped around the teeth of the ‘cutter’ inside the machine. The ‘homogenising’ aspect of each of these machines refers to their ability to change into food processors of sorts by simply switching one ‘screen’ (also known as ‘plate’) for another. Once the ‘blank screen’ is in place, you can go on to produce all sorts of delicious treats from a variety of raw foods. For example, you can make nut and seed butters by homogenising (preferably soaked) nuts or seeds; baby foods by puréeing various fruits and vegetables; ice­creams by processing frozen fruits; pâtés and burger mixtures by homogenising nuts, vegetables and herbs together, and so on. The options are many and varied, making a Samson or Green Star excellent all round investments as they both do everything, including juicing everything you would want to juice, but the Champion, because of its speed and ease of use still remains my favourite. (The Green Life juicer is more expensive than all of the other models and in my opinion, not any better so I don’t recommend it). Blenders Main uses: Blending (s oups, smoothies, dips, dressings etc.) Tabletop blenders can be found in most kitchen, raw or otherwise, and consist simply of a jug sitting on top of a base featuring different speed settings. The cheaper versions cost around £20 and the most expensive o nes, such as the Vita­Mix TNC (shown on page 53), at"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 56 time of writing currently retails in the UK at around £395 for the standard model (‘wet jug’ only) or around £475 for the Super TNC model that comes with both ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ jugs – meaning that it can do liquids in one jug and completely dry goods in another, such as grains, nuts and seeds. The main differences between traditional table top blenders and the more expensive blenders like the Vita­Mix are the capacity and durability of the models. The Vita­Mix comes with a 2 litre jug, whereas cheaper blenders hold 1 ­ 1.5 litres. The Vita­Mix also processes much harder and bulkier items which the cheaper models have no chance of handling (cheap blenders can be easily blown up if not treated gently), the reason being because of its high powered motor and specially designed cutting blades. The Vita­Mix is indeed much more expensive than your average blender, but for those who use blenders regularly or have big families, it’s well worth the investment. I use mine almost every day. Food Processors Main uses: Blending, grating and homogenising (soups, pâtés, dips, dressings, grated fruits and vegetables, baby foods) Food processors are a very worthwhile addition to your raw kitchen and can be used in a variety o f ways. They can sometimes provide an alternative to a blender, although it is not always quite as effective and trying to blend liquids can get messy, but it is excellent for handling large amounts of ingredients for creating pâtés, dips, soups and desserts etc. Mine gets used most often for making batches of raw hummous, guacamole, textured soup and puddings. Food processors can vary enormously in price, depending on the quality of the machine (the power of the motor for one) and the amount of accompanying attachments. Mostly I use just the basic ‘S’ blade which is standard on all models (so called because the blade literally does look like an ‘S’), but the grater attachment can also be very useful for grating lots of ingredients very quickly and evenly. I f the thought of paying £150 or more for a good food processor scares you, try looking in local newspapers advertising second­hand goods. You’ll likely be spoilt for choice. Food processors are often relegated to the back of the kitchen cupboard by those who once had good intentions. This need not be so with raw food preparation, as you will be using equipment much more than most kitchen­users, as you will be doing your own food processing, rather than relying on a manufacturer to do it for you. Personal Blenders Main uses: Blending (soups, smoothies, dips, dressings etc.) Personal blenders are smaller, lighter and more compact versions of a table top blender, though instead of a jug these machines have a plastic beaker­shaped container (which"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 57 doubles up as a drinking vessel) and a separate blade on a mount. These two parts fit together and screw in to the top of the base, in the same way you would put together a nut mill. Once used to blend your ingredients, the beaker can then be unscrewed (together with the blade section) and lifted out of the base. After turning the container the other way up and unscrewing the blade portion, you are left with a beaker ready to drink from. Lids also come with the blender so you can transport your drink without spillage, while the more expensive personal blenders also come with a useful grinder attachment. Although small, these blenders are very powerful and perfect for those who only make small amounts of drinks, soups or dressings at a time and are also extremely portable. The only model currently available in the UK is the Tribest. It comes with or without the grinder attachment and prices start at just under £60. Hand Blenders Main uses: Blending and homogenising (soups, smoothies, purées, pâtés, dips, dressings, baby foods) Hand blenders are very different to table top models and come with a small beaker or a larger bowl­like attachment for mixing liquids or easily processable foods. In my experience I have found the beaker to be pretty useless as it doesn’t hold much and what it does gets splashed up all over the kitchen counter! Instead I bought a hand blender with the larger container underneath, although you could easily use a deep jug or bowl instead. These gadgets are actually invaluable as they are very versatile and cheap, typically starting at around £15 (for the one with a beaker), with the ticket price rising when more accessories are added, such as a nut mill, whisk or bowl attachment. I consider these to be a very good investment and recommend them as one o f the best pieces of equipment to start off with. Hand blenders are also very portable (though need a plug point to operate from), and compact, with the lower half unscrewing in order to be safely washed. I highly recommend these for making dressings, smoo thies, baby foods, small amounts of nut butters, nut and seed ‘cheeses’, dips, spreads, soups and toppings of all sorts, but as with the cheaper blenders, if overworked they do have a tendency to overheat and burn out. Once they’re gone, they’re gone. I’ve lost four hand blenders in total so far, so it’s worth investing in the best. Nut Mills Main uses: Milling (dried nuts, seeds, cacao beans and grains to a fine powder; salad dressings; small sweets; baby foods)"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 58 Nut mills often come as part of the equipment with a hand blender or table top blender, but they can also be bought individually, sometimes going by the description of ‘coffee mill’. Nut mills basically make short work of grinding nuts, grains and seeds into tiny pieces or a fine powder, so are very useful for making cookies, sweets, desserts etc, and also for making mixed seed sprinkles to go onto salads, or for quickly whizzin g up salad dressings. Nut mills can also be used to blend other raw foods into tiny bits ­ it’s largely a question of exp erimenting, as some machines may handle some foods better than others. In the past I have used mine to blend up nuts and dried fruits together to make sweets or desserts, and because of the small container which is a part of it, they can usually be used for processing small amounts of food as you would within a normal table­top blender, just on a much smaller scale. Good for baby foods and so on. Nut Milk Bag Main uses: Straining nut or seed milks, using as a sprout bag Nut milk bags are incredibly simple kitchen accessories, but I couldn’t do without one. Made simply from a finely woven material such as cotton, muslin or nylon, the bag is triangular in shape with a drawstring top. Although it can double up as a sprouting bag, it’s best used as a nut or se ed milk strainer, and can be used to strain juices too. It can be washed in the washing machine or by hand in warm soapy water and well rinsed. The way to use it is as simple as its design: Take a jug or bowl with funnel (tall jugs work better because of t he size of the neck), place your nut milk bag over the top holding it firmly over the neck of the jug or funnel, and pour your nut milk in to it. The result will be pure, clean nut milk in your jug or bowl with the pulp remaining in the bag. Make sure you squeeze the bag well to ensure as much milk as possible has been extracted. The dry pulp can be used in raw cakes, cookies or dehydrated to make a nut or seed flour. Nut Milk Maker Main uses: Making “milks” from nuts, seeds and other grindable ingredient. The nut milk maker is an electric machine that’s rather groovy looking, in fact a little bit space age. There are a few models on the market, but the only one I would refer you to is the Yaoh Hemp Milk Maker – unfortunately named as it makes way more tha n just hemp milk. The machine simplifies the palaver of making your own nut milk by hand via the “blend and strain” method – it will basically take any shelled nut or edible seed and with the addition of"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 59 water, turn it into a completely smooth, bit­ free “ milk” that is the cleanest and freshest you could probably ever make. An added bonus is that you can also add other ingredients in such as cacao nibs (h ard pieces of cacao bean that taste like dark chocolate) or pour in another flavouring such as maca or mesquite meal and then not only can you make a great tasting plain milk, but you can also create flavoured ones, all at the press of a button. Ice­Cream Makers Main uses: Making ice­creams from nut milks or smoothie mixtures Being a big fan of ice­cream, I was delighted when I first found out that I could not only keep eating it on a raw diet, but that I could eat a version of it that was more delicious, dairy­ free and so much healthier too! But before we take a look at the various options available, I will say that an ice­cream maker is by no means imperative as you can still freeze raw ice­ cream in containers in your home freezer to good effect, however, they do tend to frost over and take a good while to defrost once out of the freezer which can be quite frustrating! If you are as passionate about good ice­cream as I am, then I would say that it’s worth every penny to invest in an ice­cream maker. Some models are actually very cheap (under £30) and are as effective as the more expensive models, just requiring a little more planning. There are three main types of ice­cream maker: the manual version, the put­the­canister­in­ the­ freezer­beforehand version and the ice­cream on demand versions. All of the ice­cream makers work on the same principle, with eac h model comprising of a canister with a central, vertical paddle (otherwise known as a ‘dasher’) which is placed inside a container that holds a freezing agent. The freezing agent can be either ice and salt, a chemical coolant or, in the case of the ice­ cream­on­ demand machines, an electric refrigeration unit. To use the machine you simply fill the inner canister with your chosen ice­cream mixture which the dasher stirs when rotated. This stirring action aerates the mixture and keeps it smooth by preventing ice crystals from forming while it freezes (which, as mentioned above, will happen if you just put a normal container full of mixture into the freezer). Manual­style ice­cream makers come in various styles but all rely on plenty of physical stamina to turn the crank that rotates the dasher. They usually take 30 to 40 minutes to make about 4 litres of ice cream. Another manual model is the pre­chilled chamber freezer type, which produces about a litre of ice­cream. This works by placing the container in the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 60 freezer for 24 to 48 hours before using in order to freeze the coolant sealed between the walls which line this unit. After this time has elapsed and the unit has been removed from the freezer, the ice­cream mixture is then poured into the centre cavi ty; a crank­and­ dasher assembly and lid covers the entire unit. The hand ­rotated crank is turned once every 2 to 3 minutes for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the amount of ice­cream being made. Electric ice­cream machines are equipped with electric motors that rotate either the ice­ cream canister or the dasher and therefore save you all the hard work. The cheaper ones (which still come in at under £30) work in a similar way to the formerly mentioned manual ones, where the main bowl is placed in the freeze r for up to 24 hours beforehand in order to freeze the coolant, then it is removed from the freezer, the mixture poured in, the unit plugged in and the mixture is ready in as little as half an hour. For those who don’t like waiting for their bowl to re­ fre eze, it’s worth investing in an additional one so you can have one in the freezer all the time. The most expensive and luxurious of electric ice­cream freezers is the large, self ­contained countertop machine that has the freezing unit built into it. All that's required here is to pour the ice­cream mixture into the canister and flick a button. Ice­cream will be yours in as little as 20 minutes. Prices start from around £200. Dehydrators Main uses: Dehydrating wet or moist raw ingredients (raw food recipes, pizza bases, crackers, breads, fruit, vegetables, seasoned nuts and seeds etc.) Dehydrators come in different shapes and sizes, starting from around £100 for a small circular model with a heating element in its base, through to the oven­shaped models, which work by blowing heat up the back of the unit and along each tray, known as the Excalibur (pictured). Dehydrators are designed to basically remove the water from food by heating it very gently in order to evaporate any moisture within it, thus preserving it, making flavours more concentrated, or for changing moist foods to crunchy or crispy foods, depending on how long the food is in the dehydrator. Most dehydrators have heat settings ranging from about 95°F to well in excess of the 118°F which is the temperature at which enzymes are killed. As enzymes are the ‘life force’ of food, obviously we don’t want to overheat the foods, otherwise technically we are cooking them, so raw fooders simply ignore the higher heat settings and keep the temperature usually around 110­ 120°F. This is because the outside temperature is"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 61 always slightly higher than the actual temperature inside the food, so having the temperature even as high as 125°F on the dial means that the food itself is underneath the all­important temperature of 118°F. It is also important to know that, if a dehydrator temperature is set too low, a food can in fact begin to rot or ferment before it has dried because it is not drying quickly enough. The Excalibur company is the largest and in my opinion the best dehydrator manufacturer in the world. They also manufacture ‘Paraflexx sheets’ which are thin plastic­looking sheets made from Teflon but which are perfectly safe to use. These cover the clear mesh grid on the trays, so that runny or heavy foods can dry without falling through the mesh, or sticking to it, which would otherwise result in some complicated and fiddly washing up! I usually recommend that people order Paraflexx sheets with their dehydrator as it saves a fortune on grease­proof paper, a nd more than likely they will be used very soon into the experimenting stages. The smaller circular dehydrators are fine, and they do the job well, but really are only suitable for those who use a dehydrator sporadically, or use it just for themselves, an d in small amounts, as the drying area is a lot less than the squarer units, and typically they come with less trays. No Paraflexx sheets are available for these models as they are made specifically for the Excalibur models, but some people have purchased some individually and cut them to size, taking off some extra around the edges in order to let the heat come through properly. Personally, I prefer the Excalibur model, and upgraded from a 5 tray model to a 9 tray, owing to the amount of use it was getting. I found that as winter approached we were looking for much heavier foods, and also for catering reasons, we felt it was good to be able to offer more conventional looking and tasting foods to our family and friends, and raw food beginners, such as raw pizza, lasagne, crackers and cookies. We also found that as we tend to make food in large batches, we had to wait for one batch of food to dehydrate until we could put the next bat ch on, so having more trays made all the difference. There are mixed feelin gs about dehydrators. Some feel that it’s too close to cooking for the foods that come out of them to be considered truly ‘live’, while others say that they couldn’t have switched to or stayed on a raw food diet without it. Over the years my thoughts have changed. At first I never used one – in fact I didn’t even know what one looked like until about five years down the line – but later I found that I was looking for more variety in my diet and , living in a family situation, found that it was"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 62 invaluable for k eeping friends and family happy and generally more open to the diversity a raw food diet could offer. These days my dehydrator is, on average, on the go once or twice a week during the winter months. Although drying time can take anything from 6 hours to 2 days, depending on what’s being dehydrated, it’s actually very energy efficient, costing pennies rather than pounds to run. From speaking to many hundreds of people about how a dehydrator has helped them, I would say that this is one of the best inves tments you can make if you are aiming for an all raw diet long term, aiming to cater professionally, to entertain a lot, or for those with a family. Sprouting Equipment Main uses: Sprouting nuts, seeds, beans, pulses and grains Sprouting is the ultimate way to grow your own food in the confines of a very small kitchen space, or indeed anywhere, including on the move. The variety of sprouting equipment now available is enormous, starting from the basic jam jar with a muslin lid, which most people have at h ome already, through to the larger, self­watering ‘automatic sprouters’ which are much more costly, and space­consuming, but great time savers. Let’s take a look at what’s on offer: Jam Jar Approach It really is unnecessary to spend vast amounts of money on sprouting equipment unless you want to, so what better and cheaper way to start than by finding a simple glass jar and some muslin, net curtain, or old pair of clean tights to use as a lid? This is how I began over a decade ago, and though I now have more equipment to choose from, this method is still as good as any and the quickest of all. Simply make sure your jar is clean, has no oil residue or the like from olives or whatever used to inhabit it, and make sure that you have some kind of lid, such as those mentioned above, which allow s the air in and water to drain out, and a way of securing it, such as with an elastic band or some string. We will explore how to use this equipment in more detail shortly. Sprouting Jars You can buy specially designed s prouting jars that already have the lid in place, typically consisting of some stainless steel mesh which neatly fits inside a screw top lid. These are typically accompanied by sprouting jar stands that allow the jar to stand upside down at a slight angle in order to let all the excess water drain out, thus avoiding rotting. Prices for"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 63 these usually start around £6, depending on whether the lid is plastic or metal and how basic the design is. Sprouting stands are useful but not vital. So long as you are car eful to rinse and drain well, there’s no harm in having your jars standing upright the rest of the time. Sprouting Bags A variety of sprouting bags are now available, commonly made out of nylon mesh, muslin or hemp. These usually have a hanging loop in on e corner so you can suspend the bag from a hook, or the top corner of a cupboard, so that the water can drain out easily and collect in some kind of container underneath, such as a sink or large bowl. Sprouting bags can often hold many more sprouts than any other forms of sprouting equipment, and are a great way to mix sprouts of a similar size in a decent quantity. These are great for making nut ‘milks’ and also for travelling as well, as they simply lay flat in your bag until you are ready to use them and can be take n anywhere. Sprouting Trays Small or large sprouting trays that stack one on top of another are a compact alternative which offer a good area for sprouting inside an enclosed unit. For some reason I have never been drawn to using these, preferring to use either a jar or bag, but they are a perfectly good method for growing most sprouts, and exactly the right environment for the tiny sprouts such as cress, carrot, broccoli and so on which need to grow upright. The sprouting tray option is also good for those with a bit more room, or who like to have sprouts more on display. Automatic Sprou ter Since the idea of sprouting has gained in popularity, people are now prepared to spend more money on their equipment, and to give more time and space to th e practice – e nter the automatic sprouter. Although a bit more time­consuming to maintain (a water container needs to be set up and on the Freshlife Sprouter the water needs to be changed daily at the base of the unit; there is also a bigger area to event ually wash up), these are really attractive pieces of equipment and look stunning when wheatgrass or baby sunflower greens are grown inside them. They’re run on electricity, and are self ­watering, with the Freshlife model using a small ‘S’ shaped watering device spinning periodically to keep the greens moist and well­watered, while the EasyGreen model sprays a mist from around the sides of the unit and is my personal favourite. Both models produce beautiful fresh greens without the need for soil. A good investment if you can afford it, but by no means an essential."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 64 Wheatgrass Growing Kit Kits can now be bought which give you all you need to grow wheatgrass in soil or compost the traditional way. Again, these are luxury items, as you can make your own kit by buying some cheap heavy duty seedling trays (with or without holes in the base), and using your own jars and organic compost or soil from your garden. This is what I have done for years and it’s worked well and continues to, allowing me to simply stack an d store the trays in a kitchen cupboard when they are not in use. Mandoline Main uses: Slicing, julienning and shredding vegetables The mandoline is a great piece of equipment, but one to be careful of, owing to its very sharp and exposed blades. It’s a rectangular boxed­shape gadget with a clear collecting tray underneath, and an adjustable platform (which houses the blade) sitting firmly on top. It works very simply by selecting one of several blades, slotting it in place within the platform, and then moving your chosen ingredient along the platform backward s and forwards continually sliding it over the blade. A finger guard should come as standard to protect your hands when doing this. As you go you should find the collecting tray filling up quickly with your sliced vegetable, and the vegetable itself will quickly whittle way down to very little. A quick and efficient way of shredding, slicing, and julienning, especially useful if you are making large salads requiring uniform sized shredded ingredients s uch as coleslaws or winter salads. Prices start from around £20 and work up to around £35 for the well­known Joyce Chen brand that I recommend. Cheaper brands can be effective but sometimes are more dangerous to use; the Joyce Chen one is robust and of exc ellent quality. Spiral Slicer Main uses: Creating vegetable spaghetti or pasta spirals from hard fruits and vegetables Formerly known as a ‘Saladacco’, this little machine requires no electricity, and is very simple to use. It typically costs around £25. It’s used primarily for making spaghetti from raw vegetables such as carrots, yams, sweet potatoes, courgettes, marrow and beetroot, but can also be used to make decorative ribbons from fruits as well as vegetables for thicker ‘pasta’ meals, or for decora tion purposes. One of the favourite gadgets I demo in my classes, it never fails to amaze people as they watch impressively long strands of veggie spaghetti come out from one relatively small length of carrot or courgette. Unusual and attractive meals can be cre ated within a matter of minutes and, owing to the huge array of dressings that can be created to coat or pour over"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 65 the spaghetti, no two meals will ever taste the same. A great little investment for adding something different to your meals. Zester Main uses: Zesting and grating The zester is a useful tool typically used by top chefs and gourmet cooks – but don’t let that put you off! It’s extremely easy to use and clean, and produces exceptionally neat results. Looks­wise the zester comes in the form of a long stainless steel ruler­shaped tool set in to a tough plastic handle. Like a traditional hand grater, the body of the zester is covered all over with very sharp teeth and holes but these ones are tiny. So when a food is rubbed up and down along it, a mass of tiny flakes of the original ingredient – much finer and neater than you could chop by hand ­ is the result. The zester is perfect for grating tiny amounts of garlic, ginger or any tough vegetable, and true to its name is great at zesting lemo ns and limes for adding to raw recipes. A zester is found in traditional kitchens as well as raw ones and, subject to creativity , can have a multitude of uses beyond the obvious, depending on your needs. The Microplane Zester, the best in the world, is a f abulous kitchen tool and retails at around £8. Metric Wonder Cup Main uses: Measuring wet or dry ingredients or using as a burger or cookie mould Every kitchen, raw or otherwise, should have a Wonder Cup – they’re brilliant. Incredibly simple in both design and function, the Wonder Cup consists of a clear plastic outer ‘sleeve’ marked up with the various measurements (teaspoons, tablespoons, fluid ounces, millilitres and cups) while the plastic inner inverted ‘cup’ is twisted down into the sleeve until its top edge aligns with the desired measure. Once you’ve filled the resultant gap with your chosen ingredient and levelled off at the top of the sleeve, you can simply pour it into your recipe and move on to the next ingredient. Equally useful as a burger or cookie mould or cutter you can fill the cup with your mixture to any thickness you desire. The sleeve provides the fixed (circular) shape and size, and if you turn the cup upside down you can use the cup as a plunger to push out the mixture on to a plate or Paraflexx sheet ready for dehydrating. I use this method for shaping all of my cookies and burgers now. It ensures a uniform look and because the mixture has been packed in tightly, they don’t fall apart when I press them out. The Wonder Cup comes in two sizes – one cup and two cup capacities. The two cup model also measures in pints. Prices start at £4.99 for the one cup model and £7.99 for the two cup – bargain!"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 66 Phew! That’s a LOT of new information isn’t it?! Don’t fret, all of this will come in time, especially if you find a way of seeing all of them in action (I demo these live at all my classes as it can be quite difficult to see them all and compare them in any other way). As I said at the beginning, I recommend that you start, if possible, with at least two of the three what I would call “vital” items – vital in as much as they will give you lots of opportunities to play and experiment – and then, as time goes by, see if you feel drawn to experimenting or investigating further any of the other pieces of equipment. If you do, then you have the information already here to access when the time comes. My main concern is that you don’t feel overwhelmed but keep it simple. I’ll illustrate this further by sharing with you how I first discovered “healthy kitchen equipment”. How I Got Started I was brought up in a home where the only kitchen equipment I knew was a cooker, a toaster, a kettle, a deep fat fryer and a slow cooker. I knew what a juicer was but I had never seen one “in the flesh” until I was at least 19 years old, and I didn’t own a food processor until I was about 26 – i.e. about six years into my raw journey! The pieces of equipment that I first invested in were in fact a simple centrifugal juicer priced at around £25 and a table­top blen der costing about £20. These two pieces served me very well for several months until I felt comfortable enough to broaden my horizons again. My next purchase was a manual wheatgrass juicer costing around £30 – this was because I learned about the benefits of fresh wheatgrass juice very early on and knew that this was something I definitely needed to bring into my diet, and quite soon after, when I was diagnosed with “severe cervical cell abnormalities” it proved invaluable. I used the wheatgrass juice it provided me with to clear myself of these abnormal cells, thus avoiding surgery. Beyond that, I invested in a hand blender with nut mill attachment, and it was with these pieces of equipment and a couple of sprouting jars that I used successfully and enjoyably for the next few years until I was given the food processor! Since then I have acquired just about every piece of equipment on the list, but I have not chosen to keep and use them all. Today I own and use a Champion juicer, a Vita­Mix Super TNC, a Cuisinart Food Processor, an Excalibur dehydrator, a Spiral Slicer, some sprouting jars, a nut milk bag, a zester, a"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 67 Magic Wonder Cup, a hand blender and nut mill, some sprouting trays, a basic ice­cream maker, and I do own a nut milk maker but prefer to make my own using a blender and nut milk bag. “But surely your kitchen must look like an electrical appliance shop?!” you might be thinking. Actually, no. I keep the first three items out in key locations and the rest are tucked away in cupboards or drawers because I don’t use them every day and don’t need to. The dehydrator, the biggest item of them all, actually lives in my utility room and sits on my long counter top in the very far corner above the freezer, as I am fortunate now to have that additional spac e, but prior to that it has lived on top of a cooker, a fridge and even a washing machine during its 6 year history! Finally, in terms of equipment and useful things to have to hand, here is my recommended list of everyday utensils that you will have heard of, will probably already own most of, and that WILL feature in your raw food prep or investigations to one degree or another. Basic First Buys for Your Kitchen that Could Make All the Difference v At least one large raw recipe book from which to select and adapt your own recipes v A recipe book holder for keeping your book out of harm’s way when prepping v At least three raw food books (any type) for educating, motivating and inspiring you v A good vitamin and mineral or nutritional analysis guidebook v At least one decent sharp knife for cutting fruits and vegetables v A good strong cutting board to be used exclusively for raw foods v Cutlery and tableware which you find beautiful and love to use v Special glasses for your daily juices or smoothies v A selection of large attractive bowls for displaying and keeping fruits and vegetables in v A vegetable trolley/rack syst em v A large ring binder and clear hole­punched pockets for keeping useful articles, recipes, hints and tips, events flyers etc. in v Lots of jars, Tupperwar e boxes or other useful containers for keeping dried goods separated, airtight and easily visible v Some big clips for resealing opened packets v A pin­board to pin up your week’s menu and shopping list (or magnets if using your fridge door) v An inspiring poster or wall chart which has practical and/or aesthetic appeal v A compost bucket or bin to put all your raw scraps into v A grater"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 68 v A spatula for smoothing some recipes out v A small set of scales for weighing ingredients v A set of American measuring cups if you don’t own a Metric Wonder Cup This list will certainly have you very neatly set up in the accessories department, which brings me neatly to... Setting Your Kitchen Up for Success I’ve already mentioned the importance of having a neat, clean and tidy kitchen and also alluded to the importance of thinking about efficiency, space saving and making your kitchen as aesthetically pleasing as it is practical. But before you begin cleaning and sorting your kitchen, first you need to consider who shares this space with you and how their needs fit into this equation! Let’s take a look at the possible scenarios: 1) You live alone and cater only for yourself. This of course is the easiest option. With only yourself to please you can have free run of the space and do with it whatever you want, whenever you want. Lucky you! 2) You share the space with friends, family or flatmates and therefore the kitchen may not be yours, or at least you are limited in what you can do. This means a conversation needs to be had once you’ve decided what you’d ideally like to have happen in the kitchen to support your new habits. This will of course vary wildly from person to person, depending on just how like­minded or accommodating your co­ habitors are! 3) You share your kitchen with your partner – just the two of you and no­ one else. Again, as above , the amount to which you can re­organise the space will depend on how like­minded your spouse is and/or how accommodating they are to your needs. Again, as above, you need to get clear on what your ideal situation is first and then have the conversation to see just how much you can get your own way! 4) You share your kitchen with partner and/or y our child or children . Having children in your world doesn’t actually make any significant difference to wh at you can or can’t do. As above it’s going to be your partner that you need to have a conversation with."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 69 On the plus side, having a juicer and blender in the house is going to hugely benefit everyone in the home – this information alone is a very good bar gaining tool. 5) You live “alone” but with your child or children . As per scenario one, with children in the home, assuming they are below a certain age, what stays and what goes is largely up to you. Yes, your kid/s may be very attached to certain foods or the toaster/ grill pan or whatever. I don’t recommend having them go cold turkey with you (this is a recipe for major tantrums!) but by bringing in more of the good stuff the emphasis can begin to shift away from the other gadgets and appliances and your child/ren can find that there’s a whole lot more fun to be had making fresh juice than watching a piece of bread go brown! 6) The final possible scenario is sharing with someone you care for, or who cares for you. As per scenarios 2 and 3, you’ll need to think your way though the situation first, come up with your ideal scenario and then have that all­important chat with the other person or people in your space. Now that you are clear on what equipment is available, to what extent you can control your kitche n space and who (if anyone) you need to consult before making changes, let’s take a look at what those changes could (and ideally should) be. Creating Your Vision Considering the amount of time and attention yo u feel ready to give to eating/choosing raw at this juncture in your life, what exactly needs to happen in order to give you the space, ability and inspiration that you need? Start with the end in mind – a vision of your perfect “ready for raw” kitchen – and step backwards in your thoug hts. Ask yourself the following: Do I need a jolly good c lear out? Are your cupboards full of old foods, packets and pieces of equipment or cookware that you haven’t used for years or is your space simply in need of a good spring clean? What needs to stay and what needs to go? How much of what you have are you actually using and furthermore, of that stuff, what may be harming your health and therefore needs to be moved, given away or relocated to"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 70 somewhere far, far away? Of the remaining things you haven’t been using, what can go, what would now be useful to you and what do you want to hang onto “just in case”? What needs to come in? Is it time to invest in your first juicer or a newer more sophisticated model? Is there another piece of equipment that you really f eel would make all the difference to you that you don’t already own or have stashed up in the loft? What bits and pieces would make all the difference? How about putting up an inspirational picture or poster that reminds you of your goals, your ideal bod y image or expresses your values so you feel inspired or motivated every time you look at it? Or how about taking care of the simple things like making sure you have plenty of kitchen roll always on hand, or investing in a vegetable rack on wheels if you’re short on storage space, or introducing plants or flowers onto your kitchen window sill? All of these aspects need to come under the spotlight in order to give you a new canvas to create from, but of course it is all relative to how excited and focussed you are on this project. As with everything in life, the more effort you put in, the more you’ll get out. In order to get clear on what you really want and need in your kitchen, take a good look now at each of the above in turn and make a list of actions you need to take in order to create your perfect food space. When you’re done, for many of you it will be time to have that conversation! Some Pointers for Those Who Need to Compromise Not all of us will have the luxury of complete control over our kitc hen set­ up. If your co­ habitor/s are particularly un­like­minded, ask or suggest that you have a space all of your own. Look at the kitchen space, divide it by the number of people using it and suggest a part of the kitchen that you’d like to “own” for your own special purpose. T his is a very fair way of approaching things, and who knows, within time your space may extend to the whole kitchen as your household choose to share in your experimentations! Over the past 13 or so years I have lived in just about every scenario imaginable! I have lived alone, shared with a room mate, lived in a building 13 storeys high where the basement was in the kitchen, split into sections that were shared by up to eight different people, have co­habited with my mother, a junk­food­loving partner, my mother and my"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 71 partner, lived in a house share of six or seven completely un­likeminded and messy city workers, shared a large flat with one other un­likeminded flatmate, shared a small flat with the flat’s owner, lived with a like­minded partner, lived with like­minded partner and new baby son (who soon became a little boy!), and, at time of writing, I live alone with my son and once again have complete dominion over my home! I tell you this to illustrate the fact that I have managed to eat raw in every possible scenario. Whether I have been operating out of a tiny fridg e basket and a box under my bed or have had an entire house and kitchen to myself, it really hasn’t made as much difference as you might imagine. With a few key piec es of equipment and a passion for change, that’s all you really need and the rest is a bonus. Now all you need to know is... How to Make the Most Out Of What Space You DO Have I want to keep this simple and really, this part is. To recap: You have your kitchen space defined, you have made the changes you want to (in terms of clearing, cleaning, binning, giving, moving and introducing) and now it’s time to get the space set up so th at it supports and inspires you and just as importantly makes life very easy for you. With this in mind, here are my tips for making your kitchen tick all of the above boxes and be a place that you really enjoy being in and that makes going raw easy and pl easurable every day of the week: 1) Keep your key pieces of equipment in a prominent and clear position , next to a plug point, plugged in and ready to go whenever the need strikes! This one piece of advice will save you a lot of hassle AND make life a lot easier and healthier for you. 2) Next to each piece of equipment keep the relevant foodstuffs and/or ingredients that you are going to be using with that appliance. For instance, I keep all my smo othie ingredients and a big bunch of bananas next to my blender, my fruit bowl next to my juicer and a chopping board next to my food processor (which is next to my juicer so serves them both)."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 72 3) Keep as much of the counter space completely clear as possible . This not only looks and feels better, but it means there is never an excuse not to make something because of lack of space or having to clear up first! 4) Group your foods into different places . For instance, I keep all my dried herbs, spices, sea veg and misc. other in one cupboard, my superfoods, flavourings and sweeteners on a shelf next to my blender, my salts, oils and sundried tomatoes in another corner where I may go to season dressings, dips or salads, and all of my nuts, seeds and dried fruits are kept in my kitchen carousel (the rotating half ­moons that sit behind cupboard doors and are us ually used to keep saucepans on). I keep any cooked food items for my son or visitors in my utility room, so that they’re there for emergencies but are never the first things I see. All the rest of my food is kept in the fridge, with a few frozen fruits and/or raw ice­cr eams kept in the freezer. 5) Keep a good clean supply of water in a prominent location so it’s always close to hand. There are many ways to obtain good quality water, but this is probably something for later on. For the short term I advise NOT to drink tap water and at the very least i nvest in a basic jug water filter or investigate other more pure water alternatives such as good quality bottled water, distillation units or even reverse osmosis or ionised water systems. (I personally use home delivered spring water in large recyclable c anisters). 6) Keep your sharp knives in a drawer, a knife holder or on a magnetic wall hanging as close to your chopping board as possible . This way you are always ready to chop and go! 7) Keep a notepad and pen, chalk board or pin board with blank paper and pen attached close to hand so that when you start experimenting you can make notes or write down your new recipes as you go. 8) Keep your bowls, jugs and Tupperware containers all in one cupboard so that you know exactly where to find them when you need some containers. 9) Keep one drawer purely for housing miscellaneous tools such as salad servers, a hand­held citrus juicer, your zester and grater, you r measuring cups, your spatulas and any other utensils that you use as part of your fresh food prep."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 73 10) Find a safe and a clean place to house your favourite recipe book/s and any other useful literature , but avoid the temptation to create clutter. Best to choose one or two frequently used books and keep the remainder filed safely elsewhere. Taking all of the above into account, when you have made the necessary changes to your kitchen run it past the all­important final check: Final Check Questions R Is it functional? R Does it look spacious? R Are things easy to get to? R Are my most important accessories and ap pliances in clear view or at least super­easy to reach for? R Is my food well organised? R Are my cupboards clear, clean and well organised inside? R Are my “less healthy” foods and kitchen appliances harder (if not impossible!) to get to? R Does my kitchen inspire me to take care of myself? R Does it look beautiful? Have I made the most of this space? R All things considered, have I set my kitchen up for success? When you can answer yes to all of the above, you are ready to move on to Step 4. Congratulations, you are half way there!"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 74 Step 4 Getting Creative You now know w hat going raw is about from a personal and health perspective. You know what foods can be classified as “raw” and “live” and you know where to get them. You know how to select the best, where to find the bargains, and even how to process them. Your kitchen is set up for success – it looks great, feels clean and tidy, you have the right tools for the job and understand what they do, and your countertops and shelves are now begging you to bring increasing amounts of fresh, healthy foods onto the scene to decorate them and brighten them up! Now it is time to learn about how to use those foods in your kitchen – this is where the real fun begins. The Top 5 Raw Food Preparation Techniques The top 5 raw food preparation techniques using electrical kitc hen equipment are: ∑ Juicing ∑ Blending ∑ Milling ∑ Dehydrating ∑ Freezing In this section we’re going to take a look at what each of these are, why we would do them, what equipment we could use for each type of preparation and the best ways to get started. Juicing What is juicing? Juicing is the method used to extract the liquid portion of a fruit, vegetable, herb or grass from its original form. As these plants typically consist of at least 70% water (often more) in their whole state, you can extract a lot of juice from them, especially from fresh fruits which are traditionally much higher in water – often above 85%. Juicing works by crushing, finely grating or squeezing the juice from the original food and then filtering through a fine sieve or similar; on electric juicers this sieve is typically called a ‘screen’. The residual pulp (fibrous"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 75 part of the plant) is expelled elsewhere, leaving pure clean juice as by­product in a separate jug, f resh and ‘live’ and ready to drink. Why juice? Juicing can add a whole new dimension to your diet, and provide huge amounts of nutrition in an easily assimilable, concentrated form that is refreshing and delicious. If you don’t like to drink water all th e time it could prove invaluable if you wish to replace all the other less healthy drinks that you might have been used to. By experimenting with juicing, you will open yourself up to an incredible variety of taste sensations, varying from the simple singl e fresh fruit juices (such as apple, orange or watermelon) through to tasty vegetable combinations such as carrot and beetroot, the highly­ alkaline green juices or the more elaborate fruit cocktails. Quite simply, juices taste amazing, look strikingly beautiful, and when you’ve drunk one you feel as if you’ve been washed clean inside. If you want to feel squeaky clean for a day and lose a little weight, a day of juicing will do wonders for you, your energy, your mind and your body. And needless to say, kids of all ages (including Grandad) love juice. Everyone loves juice! What do I need to juice? Obviously buying a good all­purpose juicer is the best way into juicing (see step 3 for more about juicers), but some people improvise by using a blender, sometimes adding water if necessary, and strain the resulting mixture. This can work well in some instances, but isn’t going to work at all for herbs and grasses. Juicy fruits will be most successful but there will still be a lot of juice left in the fibre as spinning blades do not create the necessary crushing or squeezing action needed to get the most juice out of them. Most vegetables will need water added in order to generate enough motion to spin the food around, so a watered down juice will be the result. Realistically speaking, unless you are prepared to compromise and struggle a little with a blender, if you want to juice, get a juicer! Best ways to get juicing Although you can create some incredible fruit or vegetable cocktails using a combination of pure fresh juices, I still feel that the simple juices are the best. The best way to begin is by using one ingredient only to get a feel for how a food tastes when juiced. This works b est for fruits as their flavour is sweeter than most vegetables and initially are more palatable in larger amounts. Many vegetables are much more strongly flavoured and can only be taken in smaller amounts or mixed with other vegetables, so unless you have a Candida problem start with fruits first. For some good juicing recipes to get you started please refer to the recipes section."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 76 Blending What is blending? Blending (also known as homogenising) is the technique used to combine two or more ingredients together into a single multi­flavoured form. In raw food prep these ingredients can either be high­water content foods or liquids that will combine well together to form a liquid or a blended meal such as a smoothie, soup, dip or dressing. Alternatively , heavier ingredients such as nuts and seeds can be blended without high­water content foods present. These drier raw foods can only combine successfully with more intense pressure, which you won’t get from the power or blending technique generated by a traditional blender. Why blend? The variety of drinks and meals you can add to your menu with the addition of a blender is perhaps much more than you’ll find than with any other piece of kitchen equipment. I use mine all the time for smoothies, thicker ‘juices’ (the pulp remains but is blended very finely), soups, baby foods, ice­cream or thick shakes, dressings, sauces, pâtés, ‘cheeses’, burgers and more besides. What do I need to blend? You can blend liquids or high­water content foods in a nut mill (small amounts), food processor, using a hand blender and jug, a personal blender, or of course, a traditional blender (with the king of blenders being the Vita ­Mix). The latter is the most effective, not only for its functionality but for measuring and pouring purposes also, but all of the others will work well. As mentioned above, for those mixtures where there is little or no liquid to work with, you will need to use a machine with more power, or where you can focus the power directly onto or into the food where it is needed. This you will achieve by using a hand blender, food processor or electric juicer with homogenising capabilities in order to process the foods effectively. See chapter 2 for more information on the various pieces of kitchen equipment mentioned here. Best ways to get blending It may not be so obvious where to start with blending if you’ve never done it before, or at least not with raw foods. I think the best place to start is with some simple smoothies, nut milks, dressings, soups and dips and some basic pâtés and ‘cheeses’. You can read more about all of these includin g some simple recipes to get going with in the recipes section."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 77 Milling What is milling? Milling is also referred to as “grinding” and is the technique used to break a dry raw ingredient down into smaller parts, ranging from chips to a fine powder. Why mill? You can mill many dry raw ingredients such as nuts, seeds, grains, dehydrated foods and cacao beans. In doing so you create smaller particles that are either easier to use within recipes or which can be used as sprinkles for adding into or onto other dishes, such as soups, salads or desserts. What do I need to mill? You will need a nut mill (also known as a coffee mill or grinder) or a blender with a ‘dry jug’ such as the Vita­Mix Super TNC. See Step 3 for more information o n the kitchen equipment mentioned here. Best ways to get milling Try taking a tablespoon each of sunflower seeds (hulled), sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds and milling together to form a tasty seed sprinkle. This mixture is packed full of nutrition and can be used to mix into recipes or to sprinkle into soups or salads. Try varying the mixture by adding or removing ingredients. Some good ones to add might be hemp seeds (hulled or unhulled) and/or flax seeds (linseed). Try the same approach to nut mixtures using different nuts to create different blends – there’s nothing to stop you mixing nuts and seeds together either. Keep any milled nuts or seeds in an airtight container in the fridge to avoid them going rancid and use ideally within 5­7 days. Dehydrating What is dehydrating? Dehydrating is an ancient method of food preservation which originally used the warmth of the sun to dry foods outside naturally. As humankind has now spread to every corner of the globe, many of us do not get enough sun or enough heat to dehydrate the old fashioned way ­ cue the invention of the man­made dehydrator. Man­made dehydrators are powered by electricity and generate enough heat to make any water within a food evaporate, leaving the food bone dry, but doesn’t generate enough heat to cook them. I have found a dehydrator to be a truly excellent piece of equipment, adding many valuable dimensions to a menu, especially in the colder months. As well as providing an array of ‘warm’ foods, it also allows us to show others that a raw food diet doesn’t just have to consist of fruit and salad , as is commonly assumed. As well as adding new foods and recipes to a menu, it can also"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 78 build a great bridge between cooked foods and raw as many dehydrated foods have a cooked taste about them, and the crunchy or crispy textures dehydrators create cannot be easily found elsewhere. The most common examples of these crunchy raw foods are pizza bases, breads and crackers. Dehydrators also provide us with a way to preserve foods for the coming months, such as dried fruits and vegetables that we may otherwise have had to throw away. What do I need to dehydrate? You can build a dehydrator yourself or you can purchase one. Some people have managed to use a conventional oven to dehydrate their food successfully, but this has been with varying degrees of success, and of course it’s much harder to gauge the real drying temperature. If you try this approach yourself, the oven must be kept at a very low temperature and the door kept open. This is not an ideal way to do it, but it can work. I tried it once and it was such a spectacular failure that the bread I was trying to make fermented, it made the kitchen smell awful and it put me off trying again! I recommend investing in a proper dehydrator to have results you can trust again and again. For dehydrating runny foods, the additional purchase of Paraflexx sheets or greaseproof paper is a must. For more information about dehydrators and Paraflexx sheets, see chapter 2. Best ways to get dehydrating It’s best to start by simply drying out some slices of fresh fruits or vegetables of your choice. These must be sliced fairly thinly otherwise they will take days to dry out, and may even ferment before they completely dry (squeezing lemon juice on them will help preserve them a little longer but will alter the taste slightly). By drying fresh fruits and vegetables you can create everything from fruit and veggie rings or chips through to trail mixes. Semi­dried pieces can be chopped up and put in to pies or flans. Advancing from this, you can progress to dehydrating crackers made from grains or seeds; bases for pizzas or pies; cookies and other sweet treats such as muesli bars; and you can also use the dehydrator as an alternative to an oven for pre­ heating certain dishes before serving. I suggest advancing from simple fruits and vegetables to making flax crackers, as these are super easy to make and extremely delicious and versatile. Everyone seems to love them too! See the Recipes Sheets section for how to make basic flax crackers. Freezing What is freezing? I doubt this needs much explanation, but essentially when we freeze raw foods we are suspending their life force for a good while longer in extreme cold conditions. It’s a similar concept to dehydrating in that we are preserving foods for later use, but with freezing it’s in"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 79 the opposite direction! Once foods are frozen, however, they will never return to their former glory. Why freeze? Freezing is a less commonly used method of food preservation in a raw and living f oods kitchen, as the quality of fresh produce tends to deteriorate quite noticeably, especially in terms of taste and texture. Science has shown that frozen foods do lose a little of their nutritional value and enzymes along the way, but not to a significa nt degree, so in some instances it can be useful. Ways in which we can use freezing are actually quite minimal, as unlike in most kitchen situations these foods will not be cooked later. So mainly it is just fresh fruits which are frozen, typically for using later to create ice­creams, frozen thick shakes, ice­lollies, frozen fruit toppings for desserts, flans or pies, or for freezing puréed baby foods for later use. It’s also useful for preserving fruits that would otherwise go to waste through not being eaten quickly enough. For those who have always loved ice­cream and the like, it’s exciting to know that you can still have these, completely free of sugar or dairy, and much tastier than their commercially produced counterparts. Yippee! What do I need to freeze? Obviously a freezer is required here, preferably one with shelving as opposed to a chest freezer which won’t properly support the trays you may use to freeze frozen bananas in, for example. Other useful items are: trays suitable for freezing (Tupperware boxes, plastic food trays or large ceramic lasagne dishes work well); lolly moulds; ice­cube trays. An ice­cream maker is a terrific bonus – I worship mine! Best ways to get freezing The best basic food to freeze is peeled bananas laid out on a tray ­ these are useful in a variety of ways, many of which we’ll get to later. You can also freeze small amounts of freshly squeezed juice in ice­cube trays for use later on ­ this works especially well for wheatgrass juice where small amounts are all that’s needed at a time. For fruit juices, one cube of frozen juice could be a very welcome addition to a glass of sparkling water to make a fruity fizzy drink in a second without any of the nasty additives. Other ideas are to freeze chunks of pineapple or mango – these taste yummy on their own just as they are or can be added to smoothies or ice­creams at a later date. Frozen grapes make delicious and refreshing snacks in the summer, as do whole frozen bananas which can be eaten like lollipops just as they are, or rolled in coconut flakes, carob or cacao powder or any number"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 80 of sweet toppings or flavourings prior to freezing. Ice lollies for kids of all ages can be made from frozen juices or smoothies and poured into lolly moulds as you would normally. As you can see, none of this is really rocket science! It’s simply using new pieces of equipment to create foods, drinks, and snacks that you’ll love eating and that your body will respond to right away! But there is one more thing I absolutely must teach you. Whether you decide to do this yourself or buy your living foods, it is my mora l obligation to teach you all about ... The Importance of Sprou ting What is sprouting? Sprouting is an alternative term for germinating, although the sprouting process goes a little beyond basic germination and results in a partially grown or young plant. In a raw food kitchen we’re looking specifically at the sprouting of a nut, seed, bean or grain in order to render it edible or more easily digestible. Nuts do not need to be sprout ed to make them edible, nor do some seeds (see the list in chapter 2 for seeds that can be eaten ‘dry’), but both benefit from soaking and sprouting as they become more easily digestible and juicier as a result. Other seeds, i.e. those that are supposed to be sprouted, plus all beans, pulses and legumes (with the exception of peanuts) need to be sprouted if they are to be eaten raw. Kidney beans should never be eaten raw and should be avoided. Grains should also be soaked and sprouted, although dry oats are an exception and can be milled down and used to make cookies successfully without being sprouted first. The sprouting process begins in water in your very own kitchen. Why sprout? When a seed, bean, nut or grain is soaked in water for a period of time, the plant’s enzyme inhibitors are removed. These enzyme inhibitors prevent a plant from germinating unless the right conditions for growth are met, and so once the seed comes into contact with water and the enzyme inhibitors are washed away the germination process begins. This process sets into action a whole chain of reactions enabling the plant to grow at a rapid rate. As it does so, the vitamin content increases dramatically, to the point where the sprouted seed can contain hundreds or thousands times more vitamins than it did previously, and the protein, carbohydrates and fats begin to break down into a pre­digested form making for easier and better digestion and assimilation overall. The enzyme content of each seed, been, nut or grain also sky rockets making sprouts one of the most enzyme­rich (i.e. live) foods on the planet."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 81 What do I need to sprout? You don’t need any fancy equipment to get sprouting, although there are many pieces of equipment available to help you as detailed in chapter 2. To get started you’ll need some seeds or beans for sprouting, a container to sprout them in (such as a jam jar) and something to drain the water through (like a sieve or some netting or muslin) sec ured around the top of the jar. Best ways to get sprouting Sprouting is actually very easy, but some seeds and beans tend to sprout more easily than others. The easiest ones tend to be mung, lentil, fenugreek, chickpea (garbanzo) and quinoa. These are all quick to grow (quinoa takes just 24 hours, the others take 2­3 days on average) and mastering the sprouting of these will help you get more confident about sprouting other seeds and beans that take longer to grow or are slightly more tricky. How to sprout NB: In the text that follows, when I refer to a ‘seed’ this applies to beans, nuts and grains equally. Jar method 1) Make sure your chosen jar is clean and oil­ free, and pour in a handful or two of your chosen seed (which are dry at this point). Use just one type of seed per jar at this stage while you are still learning. 2) Pour in some clean water (ideally not conventional tap water) until the seeds are covered by at least an extra inch. If you are sprouting beans which are fairly large, such as chickpeas (garbanzos) or aduki beans, make sure the water covers them by an extra 2 inches so that they have more water to soak up. This will be necessary as they have a much larger surface area than the small seeds. 3) Cover your jar with a mesh lid of some kind. As mentioned earlier, this can be as basic as a piece of netting or you can use a jar with a mesh lid already integral to it. All that matters here is th at nothing can get into the jar except air, which is a must. 4) Leave the jar overnight or for 4­8 hours during the day so that the seeds have time to soak up the water. This is the beginning of the sprouting process. Differe nt books suggest different time frames for different seeds, but I have always found that a minimum of 4 hours works very well for any seed or bean I have tried, 8 hours certainly won’t hurt and, in fact, is generally better for the larger beans. 5) At the end of the soaking period, drain off the water. When all the water has drained off, rinse the contents of your jar thoroughly making sure that the water is running completely clean. Drain once more. Make sure that all the water has been drained,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 82 otherwise your sprouts will rot before they grow. This is really important . A good way to make sure that all residual water has gone is to stand your jar upside down for a while, or rest it at an angle on a sprouting stand or in a standard kitchen draining rack. It may also be worth giving it a gentle shake to free up any remaining water. 6) When fully drained, leave your jar to stand, either way up, on a kitchen counter or somewhere where the jar will be undisturbed. It doesn’t matter too much whether the jar is in light or dark at this stage, although direct sunlight is best avoided. 7) If it is a warm time of year, rinse your sprouts twice daily as they will become more easily dehydrated; if it is colder, once will usually be en ough. Be sure to drain well after each rinse. 8) Continue the rinsing and draining each day until your sprouts are ready to eat. And that’s all there is to it! Fresh sprouts of all shapes and sizes will be yours in 1 – 5 days depending on which ones you choose. How do I know when to eat them? A good rule of thumb is that in the case of sprouting seeds – such as cress, broccoli, alfalfa and so on – they will be long and green and simply look ready. This may sound overly simplistic, but it’s really that simple. Think about how shop­bought cress looks and use that as a guideline. The exceptions here are sesame, sunflower (hulled), and pumpkin which may swell up but should not be left to grow beyond a day or two (this is detailed in the chart). Sunflower seeds will develop tips and may split to form a ‘Y’ shape, but sesame and pumpkin seeds will simply look slightly plumper. Nuts, like sesame and pumpkin seeds, really only need soaking. Nuts do not benefit from sprouting (unless you are trying to grow a tree!) as nuts are best eaten simply rehydrated, which is what soaking achieves. Nuts are best soaked for between 4 and 8 hours. In the case of beans and grains, these should be sprouted. The ideal sprout will be approximately the same length as the original bean/grain, or a bit shorter. If they grow too long or develop leaves they will taste bitter and should not be eaten; if they’re too short (a day old) they are often still too young and quite bland and starchy tasting, so more difficult to digest and generally unappetising. Two to three days is the usual time taken to grow a perfect bean or grain sprout."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 83 Bag method As with the jar method, make sure your bag is clean and pour in your desired amount of chosen seeds. Rest your bag and its contents into a bowl large enough to hold it plus some water, and fill the bowl until the seeds are submerged and well covered. Make sure that the bag’s cord or string is pulled tight to keep the contents locked inside, and that the string hangs over the edge of the bowl so t hat it is easily retrievable. See steps 4 and 5 for jar method so that you know how to rinse and drain effectively. Drain the bag by lifting it out of the water and squeezing the water out. The bowl can either be washed up or kept for use on step 4. Hang the bag on a hook or over a cupboard door, making sure any residual water which may drain over the next few hours is caught in a vessel underneath it. Be sure to get this part right, otherwise you’ll end up with a pool of slightly brown water making a mess of your floor or work surface! Continue as per the jar method until your sprouts are ready to eat. In all cases, be careful not to eat your sprouts too soon or too late in order to get the most out of them, both in terms of taste and nutrition. If you eat them too young or too “old” (as they’re about to turn into a plant!) they’ll taste horrible and you will get the totally wrong impression! As a general rule I recommend eating the sprout when the tail is around half to one times the length of the origi nal seed or bean. But this is very general guidance, so for more help on this super­important subject I recommend that you purchase a separate book or booklet on sprouting, which will give you much more information than I can here (and I believe every keen raw food fan should have in their library as a matter of course anyway). When your sprouts are ready they should be put in an airtight container (or their original sprouting jar will also suffice), and kept in the fridge. This way their growth is inhibited – i.e. they won’t continue to sprout at such a fast rate and they will remain fresh and juicy for a few days to come. Eat within five days. Avoid eating if they start to smell, go brown or wilt – all common sense really. Finally, yes, you do eat the whole sprout – seed and tail together! ......... ............... ..."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 84 Your sprouting experiments can continue into growing ‘indoor greens’ if you’re up for more! Growing indoor greens is a fun and nutritious way to bring the freshest green plants into your life in addition to the sprouted seeds, beans, grains and nuts we’ve already covered here. If you’d like to grow your own wheatgrass, sunflower greens, pea greens and buckwheat greens, here follows a step­by­step guide. ............ ............... ............ Growing indoor greens What are indoor greens? ‘Indoor greens’ is the term typically used to describe wheatgrass, barley grass, spelt grass, kamut grass, sunflower greens, buckwheat ‘lettuce’ and pea greens – all of which can be grown indoors by you in your own home. They are grown i n trays or automatic sprouters, and can be grown in soil or hydroponically. Why grow indoor greens? As with sprouts, these are second to none when it comes to adding fresh green foods to your daily diet, and what’s more, again like sprouts, they are super­cheap and easy to grow. As foods go they get an A+ grade in every department and as is clearly evident by their luscious green appearance they are exceedingly high in chlorophyll, which most people eat far too little of. From an aesthetic point of view they also look stunning in your kitchen, especially wh en set amongst a counter top full of colourful fresh fruits. What do I need to grow indoor greens? As with sprouting you don’t need any fancy expensive equipment to grow your own greens, but if you choose to go that route the automatic sprouters and wheatgrass kit mentioned in chapter 2 will be of interest to you. To get started you’ll need the basic sprouting equipment outlined in the last section (a container to sprout in and something to drain the water through) a seedling tray or two which you can find in any good gardening shop or DIY store (with or without holes) and some good quality soil or compost, ideally organic. Good soil from your own garden can be sufficient to start you off but may not be to p quality. If this is the case, you could add some kelp powder or a good mineral­rich food to feed the soil. Best ways to get growing All of the following greens are easy to grow, but I’d recommend you begin with sunflower greens and/or wheatgrass. If yo u would prefer to start with just one food and have something to eat rather than drink then go for sunflower greens; if the latter then wheatgrass, as this can only be juiced. Pea greens are the next easiest ; then buckwheat greens, or “lettuce”, as it is also known."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 85 Before we go into how to grow them, let’s first take a closer look at each of the greens: Wheatgrass (includes spelt grass, kamut grass and barley grass) Wheatgrass juice is now a relatively well­known health tonic sold in juice bars worldwide. It is simply grass which has been grown from wheat grains (or wheat berries as they are also often called) and then juiced in a wheatgrass­ friendly juice r. Wheatgrass has many health benefits associated with it, ranging from being a general pick­ me­up through to being used as part of a living foods treatment for cancer and other ‘incurable’ diseases in health institutes worldwide. It’s certainly powerful stuff and is what I used in my own healing as detailed in chapter 1. Wheatgrass should only be juiced and not eaten, as the human body is not capable of digesting grass. Some people choose to chew it for a while, like they would chewing gum, and to extract juice that way. It is also great as a breath freshener and healthy gum treatment, but the pulp needs to be spat out. Wheatgrass is very cheap and easy to grow. If you buy it ready grown you can expect to pay anything from about £8 to £15 for a tray which would cost you about 50p­£1 to grow yourself. Mostly this is because of the time and care involved in its growing as well as the obvious necessary commercial profits. Growing time is typically 3 days to sprout the grains to the right length, 3 more days for them to start to take root in the soil, and a further week for them to grow into grass and to their best height (about 8 inches). So overall you are looking at about 2 weeks from start to finish. NB: Those who have a sensitivity or allergy to normal wheat rarely experience any negative symptoms when eating sprouted wheat or drinking wheatgrass juice. Sunflower Sunflower greens begin their life as a humble sunflower seed. However, the seeds which are normally used for this purpose need to be unhulled – that is, they need to have their shell still on, which means either an all black shell or a stripy one (like bird food). These can be hard to find in shops and so are usually bought by mail order, although some people do experiment to varying degrees of success with non­organic pet shop bought seeds."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 86 At their peak sunflower greens consist of tall, strong shoots with small but thick ‘leaves’ at their top (see picture). The whole green is eaten, right from the base of the stem (cut just above the soil) all the way up to and including the leaves. They’re crunchy and juicy, taste slightly bitter and yet also slightly swe et. Of all the indoor greens these are my favourite, providing a juicy and exceptionally nutritious plant which tastes incredibly fresh and alive. I use them in salads and as part of my filling for wraps. For more information and ideas see indoor greens in chapter 2 and the teach­in about wraps later in this chapter. Pea Pea greens are grown in exactly the same way as wheatgrass, sunflower and buckwheat greens, and are grown from the seeds of snow peas (mange tout). They grow tall and strong, again with leaves developing at the tip, and taste extremely sweet. This particular green is the most beautiful fresh shade of green you can imagine. As with all greens, this is great eaten as is from the base up, or added to fresh juices. Buckwheat Buckwheat ‘lettuce’ looks nothing like lettuce at all! Buckwheat groats (unhulled) grow up into thin tall shoots with a rather weak looking leaf either side at the tip of the shoot. It’s a valuable green to grow, but harder to master than the others which are hardier and easier to have success with. Buckwheat was once held as the third most valuable indoor green, after wheatgrass and sunflower greens, but has recently been replaced by the much hardier and fresher looking pea greens. As per sunflower and pea greens, buckwheat greens can be used in salads or wraps or juiced. NB: Some people have an allergic reaction to buckwheat greens when eaten to excess. All indoor greens are grown using the same basic method and take about 7­10 days to grow once they have been sprouted, planted and brought out of the dark. How to grow indoor greens Soak your chosen seed/grain/pea (either wheat grain, or sunflower seed, buckwheat groat or snow pea ­ all of which need to be unhulled) as outlined in the sprouting section earlier. After 2­ 3 days ­ when the sprout has begun to emerge and look healthy ­ fill your seedling tray with about 1­ 1½ inches of soil or compost and sprinkle on (or mix in) any soil food"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 87 followed by the sprouts. Make sure the sprouts are spread evenly with room to breathe. They can touch each other and even overlap, but must not lay directly on top of one another, as they have to be able to put down roots easily. Water your tray gently with a cup or two of water making sure you sprinkle evenly and don’t drown your seeds. If you do over­water in one particular area, don’t worry, these seeds are generally hardy and will make the best of it; just make sure other areas are still watered sufficiently. NB: Too little water will make your sprouts struggle to f ind sufficient moisture to grow; use your hand and eye to gauge that at this vital stage the soil is moist but not saturated. Cover the tray with a newspaper or large bin liner, or anything to prevent too much light and air getting in. Even better would b e another tray without holes and turned upside down to act as a lid, which is what I do (it also looks a lot neater and you can then stack trays on top of each other very easily). Store in a safe place for 3 days. On the third day, take off the cover. You should find that your sprouts have taken root, started to grow upright and, in the case of wheatgrass, are a strange white­yellow colour. Water again, more liberally this time, and leave in the open air and sunlight so that they can begin to grow towards the light and develop their chlorophyll (their green colour). Continue to water daily, either once or twice a day depending on humidity (as with sprouts). After about a week or so they should have reached their peak (about 6­8 inches tall) and will be ready for harvesting. Harvest them by cutting them at their base, just above the soil, with a sharp knife or pair of scissors, and eat (or juice) as soon as possible. If you don’t want to use them all at once, only cut what you require and let the others co ntinue to grow until you need them. Depending on what stage/day you first harvest them, the greens will continue growing well for another 3­5 days approximately. You will know they are past their prime when they begin to lean over and wilt – at which point they are still edible but not as good or tasty ­ so do your best to catch them before they reach this stage. Once the ends have bent over, and/or have gone brown or discoloured, they are not going to taste good and shouldn’t be eaten. All indoor greens c an be eaten as is, added to salads, rolled up into wraps, or juiced with other vegetables. Wheatgrass is traditionally drunk straight on its own in small 2­4oz shots, but for those who aren’t fans of the juice as it comes, mixing it with other vegetable or green juices can make it much more palatable. ......... ........................ .................. ..............."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 88 Now that you’ve learned how to “play” with your food and your gadgets and appliances, an d have even learned how to grow your very own truly live food, now it’s time to take a look at the recipes, to see what’s possible and to learn how YOU can make these amazing dishes come to life in your own kitchen. Are you ready for Step 5? It’s the Raw Food Recipes section – hurrah !"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 89 Step 5 Raw Food Recipes for Everyday Living It’s true. You can come across plenty of raw food recipes that have a list of ingredients as long as your arm, can sometimes take DAYS to make (by the time you’ve sprouted, marinated, frozen or fermented everything!) and that, yes, can taste superb when made correctly, but don’t always do your body (or patience) the world of good! Occasionally, once in a blue moon, I will spend an hour making something elaborate. I have to say this really is the exception rather than the rule. In fact, it’s an exceptional exception! If I want something complex I will usually buy it at a raw café or at an event, rather than make it myse lf. Why? Because like you, and like most people living in today’s fast­paced world, I don’t want to spend hours in the kitchen preparing food when there’s so much else to do. And besides, I have found through first­hand experience that the more simple you keep your food, the more you tend to enjoy it and the better you feel after eating it. To this end, 99% of the recipes and meal suggestions I have inclu ded for you here are fast, easy, fun and delicious. In fact, they are so easy that a ten­year­old could easily make them. I promised you ease and simplicity, and this is wh at you shall have! For ease of use I have actually positioned the recipes towards the back of this eBook within your “One Week Raw K ick­Start Pack”, which is where they really belong. This way you can file the whole Pack (or just the recipes) elsewhere if you so choose, and I highly recommend that you buy a ring binder for your kitchen to file ANY recipes that take your fancy, and not just the ones I’ll be starting you off with here. Although the recipes are located several pages away, I do need to talk you through them a little. It’s important that you know why they’re there and how you can work with them to suit your lifestyle and your own taste preferences and/or health requirements. As always, I really cannot stress enough how important it is that you only eat things that you genuinely love."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 90 What You Need To Know About Your Recipes First of all, the recipes provided are pretty varied . I have done this to encourage you to try out different food groups and to get more familiar with new ingredients. That said, most of the recipes you’ll find use everyday ingredients that you very likely are already familiar with. My intention for you is to start slow and have as much familiarity featuring in your experimentation as possible. To this end, the equipment recommended is primarily one of the three I most recommend (the juicer, blender or food processor) and for those of you who are further down the line or wish to really push the boat out there’s a handful of recipes for use with a dehydrator. Most of the recipes can be made in under 10 minutes – yes, this also includes preparing FULL MEALS ! It really can be done. I have also put a lot of emphasis on smoothies b ecause a) they are one of the easiest and fastest things you can make; b) they taste delicious; c) they work well at any time of day and work well as a light meal, drink or snack; and d) they will help you get a good range of superfoods into your diet that you may have trouble integrating via other avenues. Personally, my daily diet usually consists of one smoothie, one juice, one huge high­green­ content salad and a snack­type, high­n utrient and satisfyingly delicious meal such as nori rolls (which you have the recipe for). And if I get hungry between meals I will snack on a few nuts or seeds, a raw snack bar or some fresh ripe fruit. Easy! Curious to know what recipes I have prepared for you? NB: These are all built into the one week menu plans. Some will stand alone; some will be served as a side dish, dip or dressing; some will serve as snacks, sweet treats, desserts or drinks; and although many may seem overly simple, trust me, th ey are scrumptious and will absolutely fit the bill and all of the criteria we initially set for this project: f ast, easy, fun and delicious.

If you are, then you’re ready to move on to Step 6 – Menu Planning."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 92 Step 6 Menu Planning Even though you may not be used to menu planning, it’s really important, especially at the start, for you to have something to go by. For this reason, within the “One Week Raw Kick­Start Pack” I’ve created three different weekly menus so that you can choose the one that is most appropriate for you and potentially have two other templates to work with in the future as your knowledge and confidence increases. Having a menu plan benefits you in the following ways: * You can see at a glance how everything fits together * It takes the fear and bewilderment away from the whole process * You can see how easy and straightforward everything really can be * You can relax knowing that I’ve covered a lot of bases for you – nutritional needs, plenty of variety, a high proportion of fresh organic produce, plenty of green foods, the inclusion of a few optional “comfort foods”, the opportunity to make a few new recipes (without overloading you), working with your three body cycles (find out more about what these are here ), AND advice on how to swap things around if you don’t like something or your diary isn’t conducive to eating something at a particular time or on a particular day. I’ve also erred on the side of caution and only used ingredients that are easy to source and accessible either through your supermarket, organic supplier and/or specialist mail order company. I’m not going to show you your menus just yet though! You can find those in your “One Week to Raw Kick­Start Package” which follows shortly. For now I need to teach you more about some of the principles that need to be incorporated into a truly healthy raw eating programme. What follows is quite possibly some of the most important information you’ll ever read about “how to eat raw right” – information that has taken me years to pull together and that has also been agreed on by leading raw food authorities over the past few years especially. For this reason, I’ve put all the information on new pages so you can print off extras and keep them somewhere special – pin it up on your"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 93 wall, put at the front of your binder, wherever you’ll find it most useful. Just make sure you always bear it in mind! The 10 Important Guidelines for a Truly Healthy Raw Food Diet 1: Whatever diet you choose to eat, aim to make 75% of your plate fresh, ripe, raw and organic fruits or vegetables. Your body is roughly 75% water; your plate needs to mirror that. 2: Buy and eat organic (and as top quality produce as possible) wherever possible – pay with your dollar and not with your health. 3: Eat as many green foods per day as possible – whether it’s as a green juice, as part of a salad, within a green smoothie, as a superfood taken alone or as part of a drink, aim to incorporate good, vibrant, healthy greens in to your diet at least twice per day, ideally three times per day. 4: Aim to drink 6 glasses of water per day , especially when transitioning/ detoxing. As you cleanse and rebuild your body you’ll definitely need additional water to flush out those toxic residues, but try not to eat with your meals, this will dilute your digestive juices (but if you’re eating a lot of raw foods the desire to drink with your meals will diminish naturally anyhow). 5: Only eat when hungry . Very common sense advice, but most people have to consciously work at this in the beginning. The good news is, t he more raw foods you eat, the easier it becomes NOT to eat just for the sake of it. 6: Eat just one cooked or heavy raw food per meal (with your large salad plate). By keeping it simple like this you’ll really feel the difference and have a lot more energy. 7: Wait at least 3 hours after eating before snacking . If you are really hungry before then, then eat more of what you just ate or some fresh veggie crudités so you are not creating potential digestive issues. 8: Consider supplementing . It may not be necessary for you, but chances are it is. So either have yourself tested for deficiencies before you begin or incorporate a good all­round truly health superfood supplement into your diet every day, such as bee pollen, E3 Live, or Nature’s Living Superfood. 9: Think diversity! Keep trying new foods, new ingredients, new recipes and new ways of doing things. Do your best to eat something from every food group at least three times per week (the mushrooms and edible flowers are the exceptions here). Variety is the spice of life after all... and it will give you great health to boot!"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 94 10: Love everything you eat!

Now that your teach­ins are all complete, it’s time to round off your learning with the all­ important (and not to be skipped!) “Where to Next?” chapter. At this juncture, you can either keep reading and learn all about Step 7, or you can skip ahead to the “One Week Raw Kick­Start Pack” and start reading up on everything you’re about to get going with. Either way , you’ll get to Step 7 in the end – you can’t not !"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 96 Step 7 Where To Next? You now know what The 7 Steps to Going and Staying Raw are and you know how to follow the first 6 steps successfully and exactly what’s involved. This final step rounds off the whole story and really will take you back to Step 1 ­ but at a very different level to where you started. The raw food learning and the journey never end and in fact it is ever­changing. As far as I’m concerned, going raw was one of the best decisions I ever made and one of the most transformational. I genuinely believe that I would look, feel and be living a very different life to that which I do today if I had not opened my mi nd to the possibilities and incorporated raw and living f oods into my diet, my body and my life. Occasionally, once in a while, I will “go back” and eat cooked foods just for the taste and also to see if it makes any difference. What I discover never fails to astonish me! My energy goes through the floor, I feel less happy and positive overall, one thing leads to another and I end up eating all sorts of foods that I would not normally eat. It’s very powerful to be able to observe this in myself and then bring myself back on track as soon as I want to (It wasn't this easy in the early days, I can tell you!) In fact, really there are no words to describe to you what rewards lay waiting for you as you clean up your kitchen, your diet and your body. Unfortunately and rather frustratingly for me, I can but hint at what is possible, as the rest remains purely experiential. I can hand you the keys and even lead you to the door, but I can’t put the key in the lock for you or lead you through the other side – only you can do that! The purpose of this final chapter is to prepare you for what might happen next and to give you the resources you need to take your learning and experience to the next level, should you choose to do so."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 97 Beyond The Theory As mentioned before, what you’ve learned thus far is the basics. Y es, there has been a lot of new information to take on board, but all of it has been relevant and necessary in order to give you the fundamentals that will serve you for the rest of your life. Build on these and you can really fly! When you follow the “One Week Raw Kick­Start Plan”, you should, by rights, start to feel the difference. As mentioned before, a lot of this depends on your previous dietary and medical history and a lot of it also depends on what foods you eat alongside the plan if you don’t choose the 100% raw plan, and also how you take care of yourself in other ways. However, here follows a bit more information about each of the different ways you can and should start to feel better the more raw and living foods you eat and the longer you do it for. What to Expect When You Eat More Raw Food More energy Unless there is something seriously amiss, then you should definitely be feeling much more energetic on this plan. If you have ignored the plan, “cheated” and/or have chosen to create your own, that may well be the problem. Eating raw is not as simple as “eating raw”. By this I mean that there are different ways of eating raw and many different raw foods to choose from. If you get either of these wrong (or both), then you won’t feel the energy that you’re supposed to. Also, take a look at the non­raw stuff you’ve been eating (or drinking); eat enough junk or overeat on a regular basis and your energy is not going to improve, and may even decline. Bottom line: Try the plan, follow it as closely as possible , and I’d be amazed if you don’t feel a massive improvement in your energy levels. More time Early in 2006 I worked with Helen Lederer, the famous comedy actress, and was asked by Woman and Home magazine to coach Helen how to eat raw for one week. Now, this was completely new ground for Helen, and although she deviated more than a little, even she found that by the end of her week she had the two extra hours in her day that I had promised her. How so? Usually by 10pm she was ready for bed and out like a light. Not the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 98 week she went raw, though. If she can do it, then so can you! Just think what you can achieve or get on top of if you have two extra hours in every day. Better skin Look in the mirror every day (as I’m sure you already do!) and watch as day by day you witness small but perceptible changes in your skin tone and colour as you eat more raw. I have watched my own skin go from super­pale and anaemic looking (on a high meat diet) to having a warm rosy glow, a more defined facial structure (without looking gaunt!) and even my eyelids have lifted! Yes, this is the best face­lift you can give yourself and best of all it’s completely natural. Sparkling eyes Providing you get enough sleep, there’s no reason on earth why you won’t see a light in your eyes that may not have been there before. Remember, the “work” you are doing is far reaching. You are cleaning and nourishing, and consequently every apart of your body is being better fed and more oxygenated as a result. Our eyes ARE supposed to sparkle. What we eat and other lifestyle habits we embody tend to take away that natural shine. As time goes by, you may even f ind that your eyesight improve as this is a common occurrence among my clients and raw fooders I have spoken to over the years. Fi tter looking bod y I have experimented with this often – more than enough to know that it’s no fluk e and no coincidence – and what I have found is this: When I eat raw food my body tones up – even without exercise. Everything “lifts” and my body starts to look years younger in a matter of DAYS. And when I eat cooked foods it slackens again, my cellulite returns and my hip, bum and thighs start to wobble again. That alone is enough incentive to stay with the program ! Clearer thinking Your thoughts, generally speaking, can only be as clean as your blood stream. The clarity that comes after a day of clean eating, or juice fasting or even water fasting is second to none. When you stop using precious energy to digest less­than­optimum foods and you replace those foods with clean, easily digestible, cleansing foods (such as fresh fruits and vegetables) then your blood runs cleaner and in turn your mind functions bet ter. The only exception to this of course is when you go into detox mode and then the opposite occurs, but tha t gives you yet more evidence of how far reaching the effects of what you choose to place in your body really are."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 99 More balanced emotions It has been shown in many studies that when someone’s diet is cleaned up (usually a child’s, a psychiatric patient or a prisoner) their behaviour improves noticeably. The fact is, if you have poisons running around your body – some common examples being highly processed and additive­laden junk foods, excessive salt, refine d sugar, alcohol, tea or coffee – then you simply cannot feel balanced on any level. The body is constantly struggling to maintain hom eostasis (b alance within the bodily systems in order to remain alive), but when it has to work extra hard to do this, then there’s just no way we can feel emotio nally peaceful or even­tempered. Spend just one day on raw foods (or the two weeks as recommended) and I guarantee that you will notice a significant shift in your mood and your overall joie de vivre. Feeling more “connected” This feeling of connection ca n show up differently for different people, but when you eat more raw you will undoubtedly start to feel a greater sense of connection with your own body, the food you put in it and the relationship between your mind, body, spirit and emotions. For those already spiritually inclined there may well be a heightened level of awareness. Many meditators, for example, testify that their quality of meditation is much improved and they are able to stay in their meditation for longer and a lot more comfortably in the actual sitting position. For those who don’t consider themselves spiritually inclined there can be a greater awareness of the body and the more subtle aspects of the relationship between what goes in and what is experienced as a result of that. Whatever happens, expect that you will begin to see and feel things within your “being” that you have very likely never done before. Bottom line: Everything works, looks and feels better when you feed your body right! So, Where To Next? Step 7: Where To Next? is exactly as the title suggests. Where DO you go next after you’ve read this book in its entirety and followed your first one­week plan? That decision, of course, is completely up to you. You can go back to your old ways of eating as if nothing had ever ha ppened. You can choose to “eat more healthily” which may or may not include more raw foods. You can choose to work with the menus I’ve given you, modifying them to suit your own lifestyle and taste preferences, or you could choose to"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 100 really go for it and dive right in to finding out as much as possible as soon as possible – which is what I did. If you fall into the latter category, then what follows next is for you. Going Deeper In the next few pages I’ll be suggesting many different ways you can revisit all 7 steps at a deeper and altogether more fascinating level, so that the world of raw and living foods can really open up for you into its full glorious, technicolour possibilities. What completely amazed me when I first got started – and still does to this very day – is just how much there is to learn when we turn our attention and focus towards only those foods that really sustain life. In fact, I have to admit that I believed in the early days that once I’d got the hang of eating raw that would be tha t and there was really nowhere else left to go. How wrong could I have been? What I found out later after jumping ship on my old way of eating was that what I thought was a small hill to climb was really just the first step of a very exciting adventure. I t’s Your Time! But before I lead you into pastures new, which is (sadly) where we’ll be parting for this time around, I want you to know how excited I am for you and how delighted I am that you have shown willing to look at food another way and are prepar ed to open your eyes to a possible “strange new world” that even up until recently may have seemed very extreme, odd or completely “unrealistic”. As you read these pages you need to know that while this may have been true a few years ago, what held true b ack then is not true today. Never before have raw and living foods been so readily accepted into the mainstream, and this only looks set to continue. Look around you in any health food shop that you visit today, tomorrow or next week and you will see that the range and diversity of raw food snacks, ingredients and even pre­prepared raw foods is increasing at a rate never seen before. If the one thing that’s holding you back is the fear of being different to your peers (as was the case for me), then please take comfort from this fact. Know that a decade from now raw foods will be mainstream. It is happening now right before your very eyes, and I’d really hate for you to have missed out on a decade of feeling and looking your best for fear of how others would react to your healthy eating “exploits”! Right now you have the perfect “How"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 101 To” guide sitting in your very hands.

When you’ve followed the one week plan of your choice , have a go at creating your own. I have included a blank menu plan within the One Week Plan for you to print off as many times as you require. Feel free to base it on what you’ve already learned, and also feel free to deviate and learn first­hand what works for you and what doesn’t. Consider having a blood test done to identify any areas that you could or should improve on nutritionally. When you have this information you can consciously work with this by adding certain foods or supplements into your diet so that you can meet your needs appropriately. When you have some spare time , or when the need arises, set yourself the challenge of designing a menu plan for a week or two away! Naturally it will depend on where you’re going and when, but if you can start thinking creatively about how you’ll play it food wise, it will take away a huge amount of stress as you’ll be fully prepared. Learn from other raw food educators too. There are a lot of different opinions out there about what constitutes the ideal raw diet (much to many people’s dismay!) and you may find that you lean more heavily towards one school of thought or teacher than another. This is all a part of the journey, and even if one way of eating doesn’t work for you, you will find a way that does if you remain open to the messages that your body gives you. For the record, the way that I teach raw food is based firstly on unearthing and then using your own intuition to find what works best for you; second, by recommending and outlining a few key principles (all of which, by the way, have been universally agreed upon by a meeting of raw food leaders from aro und the globe); and third, allowing yourself to be “human” for the rest. I firmly believe that you should love what you’re eating as well as be convinced intellectually that it’s the best thing for you. NB: It is practically a given that there will be times where you deviate from your ideal menu and feel worse for it, but there will also be times where you play around a little with the food, the combinations, the quantities and/or your schedule and the number of times you eat per day and you’ll find a way of eating that suits YOUR body even better. Deviation is not a bad thing; it’s a very good thing. There is no better way of learning than through your own first­hand experience and the more you get in tune with your body, the sooner you’ll discover that ea ting by the clock simply doesn’t work anymore."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 106 Step 7: Where To Next? Keeping your mi nd on the bigg er picture... More things you can explore in Step 7... Find new outlets for your raw energy! I have seen it time and time again – people get more energy eating raw food and then they don’t know what to do with it! Start right now to make a list of all the things you want to do, the places you want to go, the projects you want to start or finish and the sports or hobbies you want to take up. Trust me, you need to do this! Get support! Going raw, especially alone, can feel quite lonely at times. Of course , it all depends on what level you take it to, but for those who choose to really go for it, it can be a bit alienating socially, which is never a lot of fun. Yes, there are ways to handle the social side of things without feeling like an outcast(!), but knowing that you have someone on your side to support and cheer you on is really very important. There are a few options of who you might choose. Needless to say , the more the better as there is always power in numbers! And DO make use of the raw events, classes and other networking opportunities that are ever on the increase. T his is by far the best way to meet new people, make new friends as well as learn about other resources that will no doubt be of great interest to you. See the resources list for some online resources. Reward yourself . When I achieve something special I treat myself. It could be something as “small” as having a hot candlelit bath and wrapping up in a big fluffy dressing gown afterwards, or treating myself to a facial and pedicure from my favourite beautician. Why do I do this? Because traditionally, like many people, I have used food to comfort or reward myself, and rarely anything else. Wh en I went raw I eventually learned that there were far more enjoyable and constructive ways to acknowledge myself than to stuff another plate of chips down my throat or eat a tub of full­ fat ice­cream (and feel sick afterwards!). Acknowledging myself in this way has made a massive difference to the relationship I have with myself and I have come to have more compassion and respect for the work that I do, when traditionally I would have just got my head down and worked like a machine until I burned out! This is immensely relevant to you, also. A large part of this journey is recognising that you are doing good things for yourself and learning how to be good to yourself across the board rather than just through the medium of food. So get started on that rewards list today and give yourself the first one as soon as you finish reading this book as this one act of self ­love definitely deserves recognition."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 107 Start thinking more about your life ... Where are you going? Is it where you want to go? What matters most to you? Does your current life reflect that? What needs to change in your life right now for you to feel more “you”, more peaceful, more content and more fulfilled? FINAL WORDS ... How much raw food you choose to eat is, as I have said many times throughout this book, completely up to you . There is no right or wrong here. No penance! I have been up and down the scale many times throughout my nigh on 14 years of eating raw! It took me five years to transition to all raw, I stayed there for 5½ years (including while pregnant with 3 weeks eating some cooked foods again), then came off for two years when my son turned one (though still ate a significant amount of raw food) and then went back to all raw after that, two years later in November 2005. At time of writing (November 2006) I eat the odd bit of cooked food when I fancy it as I don’t like to feel as if my diet is ruling me, but I DO feel the difference right away when I do, and no, the taste experience ultimately isn’t worth the fallout, so I don’t make a habit of it! My criteria for what I want out of life, and the way I want to eat changes ongoingly. I love having the energy and sense of freedom that raw food gives me, and the foods I eat and my vision for my life and what’s possible changes frequently. For this reason I am not a big fan of rules and boxes and so don’t like to be labelled or classified in any way, and I have to tell you – I highly recommend this lighter, more flexible approach! What matters most – at all times – is that YOU feel happy with where you’re at, that you feel as if you are moving forwards in your health journey rather than backwards, and when you don’t have that feeling, that you commit to finding out why, all the while being compassionate towards yourself and taking good care of yourself on all levels – not just in food terms and you should absolutely (unless medically advised otherwise) do what feels right based on your own experience and feelings. When you have a sense of what to do next then take the appropriate action – all in th e spirit of fun, pleasure and discovery, of course! Will eating more raw food change your life, body and health profile for the better? Absolutely and hopefully I have shown you why that is so and have inspired you to put my teaching to the test. I truly believe that no matter how much good quality, fresh, ripe, raw and organic food you add into your diet you can only begin to feel better. How could you not, really? As I’ve said before, it’s pure logic! And when the time is right, and when you feel"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 108 confide nt that you can take things a little further now that you know what you’re doing, you will up that amount and allow yourself to feel increasingly well, energetic, happy and alive. ONE FINAL WORD OF GUIDANCE It’s not uncommon for people (myself included) to become so in awe of the “raw transformation” that can start to occur that, beyond a certain point, we continue to look to food for every joy, reward or positive contribution to our life. Beyond this point, focussing on food in this way actually becomes unhealthy. Our aim is to cleanse, release, heal, rebuild, rebalance, nourish and set the scene and environment for positive food choices to flourish ongoingly in our life in order to FUEL our journey, not be the actual focus of it! To this end, I want to leave you with the following thought: So you’ve cleaned out your tank, you’re running on clean, fast­burning, first­rate fuel – now what exotic lands and exciting adventures are you going to explore in this shiny new vehicle of yours?

Well, now you’re about to find out. On the next 3 pages you’ll find Menus 1, 2 and 3. All three menus assume the following: ∑ You don’t have much equipment yet ∑ You are a complete beginner ­ or if not, you at least want to keep things simple ∑ You are busy and probably eat at work at lunchtime or grab something quick whether you’re out and about or at home ∑ The evening is the time when you’re more likely to sit down to a cooked meal and unwind ∑ Saturday is a day off for you and therefore a great day to spring clean your system ∑ Sunday is probably more relaxed, maybe a day where you go out or get busy with the kids and you may well be eating out at lunchtime If any of the above doesn’t apply to you then simply adapt the menu to suit you (there is a blank menu plan for you later) For instance ... If you have Mondays off and not a traditional weekend break, have that be your Spring Clean Day. If you are based at home during the working week , you don’t have to stick to the sandwiches option, you can make whatever you wish, so do! If you have more time than most, you can spend more time trying out the more complex recipes.

I’ve also taken into account th e rules of food combining, my knowledge of “real life” (most of us are dreaming if we think we can find time to juice 2 or 3 times a day ­ unless that’s all we’re doing!) and the typical week’s schedule. And even though I know from experience that most pe ople are going to genuinely love these menus, if there’s something there that you don’t like or would prefer not to be there for whatever reason then do feel free to swap around any recipes that you wish to . This can mean eating or drinking something similar to what’s suggested, swapping days or meals around, or leaving something out you don’t like and replacing it with something you do. I DO NOT wa nt you eating or drinking anything you don’t love! I also don’t want you to eat when you’re not hungry. And while this is a challenge for most people, at least use your week as an opportunity to see how much you use food as something other than fuel. Very enlightening! Also, don’t be surprised if you end up eating less than you thought you might . As mentioned earlier, the more nutrient­dense your food, the less your body will ask for as it’s nutritional needs are more quickly met. (This is why many overweight people keep eating even when they’ve eaten a significant amount of food; the foods they have eaten contain “empty calories” and the body asks for more in a bid to be satisfied nutritionally.) NB: On first glance the menus might appear rather straightforward. That’s the idea. What we want here is ease, simplicity, do­ability and taste, right? But we also want results and these menus will give you results without a doubt. Don’t be surprised if you find that when you follow one of the menus that you manage to add another hour or two to your day and wake up feeling lighter and more refreshed than usual. Let’s n ow take a look at each meal of the day and I’ll walk you through the suggestions I’ve made on each menu so that you can become more familiar with what’s what and why it’s there."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 117 Breakfast First of all, I don’t want you to eat breakfast until you’re actually hungry. That’s rule number one! Breakfast is the most important meal of the day in that it’s the one that sets you off on the right foot for the rest of the day ­ which is why every menu starts with a raw breakfast. Best foot forward and all that! On all 3 menus I have given you the following 3 breakfast options: 1. Unlimited fresh fruit 2. Green Smoothie of your choice 3. Banana­Almond Milk Unlimited fresh fruit Unless you have Candida then unlimited fresh fruit should work well for you. As previously recomme nded, do take professional advice if at all concerned that this might not be right for you. You can choose any fruits, eat more than one different type per meal, and eat as much as you wish. In fact, have some on standby as well, as depending on how new you are to this, you may be hungry an hour later! That’s fine, just eat. For inspiration, don’t forget to make full use of your Raw Ingredients Shopping List from the Fo od, Glori ous F ood section. Green Smoothies Don’t panic! Although these look very green I have never met anyone who doesn’t truly love (and feel much better for) a green smoothie. (Or at least not my recipes!) I recommend you start with the Mango­Spinach recipe which is one of my favourites and a true classic, but if you don’t like one or bot h of those ingredients then there are several options on the Green Smoothie recipe sheet. All you need is a blender and you’re away! I recommend everyone drinks one of these at least once per day and as you’ll have seen, they’re dotted about throughout all 3 of the menus. Banana­Almond Milk You’ll also need a blender for this and if you can’t get hold of almond “butter” easily (this is simply almonds ground into a thick paste, nothing added), then a fine sieve or “nut milk bag” will be necessary to strain the almond pulp and skins. If you’re trying to lose weight though, you could forgo the almonds and simply make a thick banana milk – just as good only less filling. This is a lovely drink that you’ll really enjoy. Once you have the “milk” concept down you can go on to make all the other great smoothie, milk and shake recipes on offer."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 118 Lunch Sandwiches On menus 1 and 2 (which include cooked foods) I’ve given sandwiches as a daily weekday work option because this is quite possibly the most commonly eaten lunc h. That said, I’ve specified wholemeal bread (which I’d like you to adhere to) and have also said salad filling. So this means no meat, cheese, pickles, mayo or whatever. My favourite filling is avocado, tomato and cucumber. You can have as many as you want, just keep it clean and wholesome! If you make your own, even better are wholemeal pitta breads as they are usually made from less ingredients and you eat less bread (and yeast). This is wha t I ate for months as I transitioned to more raw foods and event ually I found that the bread started to taste much less appealing than the salad! One cooked item plus... The other options in menus 1 and 2 are to have “one cooked item with a large side salad or steamed vegetables”. Obviously the side salad will be the fresher and healthier option, but steamed veg are good too. There’ll be some enzyme and nutrient loss in those, but it’s not as marked as if those same veggies were boiled, baked or cooked any other way. With the “one cooked item” I do want this to be whatever you are used to eating or what you’d like to eat. This is not about completely changing everything. It’s about upgrading your regular habits to healthier ones so that you can ease into things gradually. This way you feel “safe” and you can start to feel the difference just by leaving out the other cooked foods you normally eat and by adding in more fresh stuff. For ideas of what this one cooked item could be, please refer to the list called “Healthy Cooked Options” further along in this package. Dinner The evening meal is typically the one where most people “let it all hang out”! You may have had a hard day at the office or been run off your feet being a parent and you just want to relax with a nice hot meal, something comforting and perhaps a glass of wine. Well, this is fine on menu 1. Alcohol is not off the menu, and neither are tea and coffee, as these habits can be hard to break, but I would like you to try to cut down on all of these as much as you are able as they can really hinder your progress and make the results much less significant than they would be if you let them go. If you feel you can give up alcohol for a week then please do, it’s pretty insidious stuff and really gives energy levels a battering, which isn’t what we want at all is it?"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 119 With regard to dinner itself, as per lunchtime, I’d like you to give it your best shot and keep it as healthy as possible. It doesn’t matter if it’s cooked. There are many different stages on the healthy eating journey, and if you’re used to eating fries with everything (like I used to) then just swapping those for boiled or baked potatoes can be enough to feel a shift. Just take it at your own pace, but do also give yourself a little challenge. Take the One Week Kick­Start seriously and you’ll know then just how different you can feel. Snacks Snacking is not compulsory! Only eat when you’re hungry, remember! That said, if you are not used to eating such “clean burning” foods, then you may find yourself feeling hungrier sooner – this is normal, the body takes time to adjust. In this case, do snack. And the snacks that I have listed are all super­healthy and will do the job, and I’m sure there’ll be something in there that you love. NB: for those of you with a sweet tooth, please resist the urge to munch away on handfuls of dried fruit. These are very high in sugar, albeit natural, and can cause gas, bloating, and feeling very hyped up, so go easy. Drinks Often overlooked, drinks can do as much damage as unhealthy food. That cappuccino that is marketed so well can undo a lot of good work, as can that large pot of tea, the can of coke or glass of red or whatever your tipple may be. For this reason the drinks I’ve listed are all fresh, delicious and clean, but in Menu 1 I’ve suggested that while I appreciate that you may have a caffeine habit to kick, I do recommend you seriously investigate other no­caffeine hot drinks such as herbal teas and the like. Personally speaking I went from being a 4­cups­of ­ tea­ a­day­ girl to a Peppermint Tea and Barley Cup drinker as I transitioned. These days I drink mostly water, smoothies and juices and don’t miss hot drinks at all – even the nice herbal ones, although I may drink one from time to time..."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 120 Your questions an swer ed Do you now see how simple, easy and delicious eatin g raw and living food can be? Even if you have the busiest schedule YOU CAN DO THIS! Believe me, if I can do it with the amount of hours I work and the number of plates I spin, then anyone can! (Which is one of the many things I love about eating this way). Looking at the menus, can you see any immediate problems? ? ......... ............... Here are the answers to some of the questions you might be asking: Q: When should I do my shopping for this? Should I do it all at once or stagger it and shop two or three times a week? A: Ideally you would shop every 3 or 4 days, but you can get away with once per week with these meal plans. You’ll be reading the shopping lists sh ortly. Q: I have Candida and so do want to avoid the fruit. What else can I eat, and what can I use as a sweetener instead? A: Instead of eating fruit for snacks or meals, pick anything else from the food groups listing in Step 2: Food, Glorious Food. If you have a sweet tooth then use recipes that contain low sugar sweeteners such as agave nectar. This is a wonderful liquid sweetener made from cactus – sounds strange I know, but tastes delicious, like golden syrup! There are two types – light and dark. Dark is the one that has a lower GI and is therefore better for those with sugar issues. Stevia is also good as a sweetener. It’s a white grainy powder that is many times sweeter than even refined sugar, but it doesn’t cause the same issues. While I personally don’t like it, there are many who do. It’s not available in the UK as a “food” but you can get it legally on medical grounds from some herbalists and natural practitioners. Q: I am not a huge fan of green stuff. Can I be healthy without it? A: Very rare is the person who loves eating lots of greens, but those who do benefit from it enormously. Green is the colour of balance, peace and healing. Think how much green is in nature, for example. It’s everywhere and immediately has a calming effect on us just by seeing it or being in it. What is the middle colour in a rainbow? What do cows chew on all day th at makes them passive and content? Green is the answer to a lot of modern day health issues, including mood swings, and the more of it we eat the better we feel, it’s as simple as that. So if you are not a big fan of greens right now, do persevere. I didn’t even like normal vegetables when I first started trying to eat healthy! (Let alone anything green"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 121 apart from lettuce – eugh!). But over time as I got cleaner and my body and taste­buds adjusted, I actually came to crave greens and now love them completely. The green smoothies I recommend taste fantastic, I promise you. You won’t even know you are eating green (especially if you close your eyes!). Also consider taking a green superfood, even if it’s in capsules so you don’t see or taste it. You can certainly stay alive without greens, but as for being truly healthy, you definitely need them. Q: I am cooking for more than just me. How can I adapt this meal plan to feed my partner and/or children? A: This is very easy. Typically you will probably be sharin g the main (evening) meal with them, so it’s a case of you following the menu plan for yourself, and if you don’t think they’d like what you’re having, then cook them one other thing (as much as they want) and serve that alongside the salad or whatever you have prepared. If they’re a dessert lover, that’s fine too. They can still have dessert, as can you, but you can pull theirs out of the fridge or freezer and you can prepare your own in a couple of minutes and everyone’s happy. Q: Where do I get hold of all those unusual ingredients such as raw chocolate powder and goji berries? A: I have prepared a resources listing for you at the very back in the appendices, but please note, things are changing all the time. In just the period between when I started writing this and when I finished, goji berries have gone on sale in Tesco! Also note that for menus 1 and 2 I don’t list these items as I want you to keep it as simple as possible in this first week. You can get to the more exotic stuff later! Q: What can I do if I don’t ha ve the time or inclination to sprout? A: Sprouts are not vital to your diet, and I haven’t included them in any of these menus to keep things simple, but they are just about the best food you could add to your diet, no matter where you’re at. Thankfully they are available to buy (pre­grown) in a lot of health food shops, and you can also buy them mail order. Again, see appendices for listings. Q: What should I do if I “cheat” or skip a day? Does it mean I have failed or need to start all ov er again? A: I want you to “make like a toddler” and pick yourself up, dust yourself down and just carry on as if nothing had happened. Having the right mindset is really important when this happens. It is not helpful (or true) to see “falling off the wago n” as a failure, it’s really not."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 122 It’s about learning where your weak spots are, what drives you to eat things you don’t want to eat, and as a good friend of mine often says, “it’s all information”. No­ one, but no­ one gets things right first time or has n o hiccups when trying to eat healthy, it’s sim ply not human! But in answer to the question, when it happens, resist the temptation to think, “Well, that’s it then. I’ve blown it. I may as well just eat the whole packet...” or whatever. Just remove yourself f rom the scene, and go and do something that uplifts you and makes you feel better. Decide that the next thing you eat will be fresh and raw, and follow through, and you’ll be back up and running again in no time. (NB: If you are really struggling to do this then chances are, there’s an emotional cause that’s standing in your way. If this is the case and you’re going through a tough time of it, then either do the best you can or come back later when your life is a bit less turbulent). Q: How should I be feeling at the end of each week if I follow the plan to the letter? A: It all depends on where you’re starting from and which menu plan you choose. If your health and/or energy has been poor to date then you should start to feel the difference whichever menu you choose (but especially with menus 2 and 3) but it may not be as marked as it is in someone who is already starting from a fairly good place. It’s important to understand that the body’s first priority is to heal. It won’t give you energy to burn externally that it needs to put to use internally first, so you may need to be patient. That said, you may find that your energy comes in bursts and surprises you. I recommend you give the plan a month and try to get as much raw in as possible. Keep a diary so you can get an accurate picture – you’ll be very glad you did. Q: I need a lot of calories right now owing to breastfeeding/ working out a lot/ training or doing heavy manual labour. Can I eat as much as I want or is this a calorie controlled diet? A: This is not a diet of any sort in the traditional sense. I only ever recommend that people eat when hungry and stop when they’re full. But for most people this skill has to be re­ learned (we all had it as kids). There is no limit to how MUCH you can eat of this food. If you need two pints of smoothie instead of one, then have your two pints. And come back for a third if necessary. You must never go hungry, that’s completely counter­intuitive, which is what we’re trying to align with here. So eat as much as you feel you need and do not short change yourself – this is about learning to trust in the body’s messages and then respecting them enough to honour those messages and give it what it wants. Some days you’ll eat lots, others much less. Trust that your body knows what it is doing and enjoy the learning process as you ebb and flow with its requests. Yes, it might take a bit of getting used to, but it’s a wonderful feeling to just let go and stop trying to control everything. Just go with it, and if you’re worried about weight gain, please don’t. Know that if you honour your hunger levels"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 123 and don’t overeat you’ll lose the weight you need to and stabilise at the weight that’s right for you over time. Q: I don’t like something on the menu and don’t know what else to put in it’s place. What shall I do? A: You are welcome to swap any meals around or in and out. It’s getting the variety across the week that’s important. If it’s one particular ingredient that’s the problem, find one similar to it in its food group that you DO like and use that. If it’s a general allergy issue and nothing from a certain food group is viable for you (such as nuts) then choose anything else that appeals that’s of a similar ilk – in this case it would be something else fatty like avocado, seeds or olives. It really depends on what exactly you don’t like and why, but generally speaking you can double up on a recipe that you do like without any negative effects. Q: If I want to eat more raw food than you’ve suggested, where’s the best place to bring it in and what raw food should that ideally be? A: The order of priority would be: 1) Keep all breakfasts raw; 2) Add in more raw ingredients to your main meals, making one of them all­raw if desired; 3) Go all the way using recipes included in this book if you feel ready for a day, week or more on raw. Q: I have a health condition and I don’t k now if this is a safe progra m for me to follow. What do you think? A: As per page 2, as is common practice, you always need to consult with a suitably qualified medical practitioner before embarking on something new like this. It is highly unlikely that you would experience any adverse health effects – in fact in most cases you would feel a whole lot better ­ but you need to err on the side of caution, so take advice and/or make changes under supervision depending on the severity of your condition. Q: I am on the road a lot and might not be able to make all the recipes as I won’t have equipment to hand. Any suggestions? I have often travelled with a hand blen der. They’re very small and light and you can even get some that are battery powered now, so you don’t even need a plug point. These are very handy for all sorts of recipes and super easy to clean. You can also prepare foods in advance, ones that will trav el well (like crackers, cookies etc.) and also stock up well on fruit and nuts, anything that has some shelf life. There are ways and means with everything – you don’t have to follow the recipes to the letter; just get the gist of them, the ingredients are what’s important, and do your best to eat those foods somehow throughout the week."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 124 Hopefully through answering these questions I’ve made it clear just how flexible this plan can be. Remember, this is not a prescription but a guide to get you started. Without it, just like I did 13+ years ago, you’ll be wandering around in the dark trying to figure it all out for yourself, which, believe me, can take years! As mentioned earlier I have pulled so many important strands into this menu that it is a well­ balanced plan that ticks a whole bunch of boxes. Yes, you can deviate from it, but you probably won’t get as good results – that is, unless you add more raw foods in and in the right combinations. Q: Can I live on the menus you prescribe long term or just for a week? Do I need to supplement? All of the menus are viable long term, and all will give you different results. The week you have ahead of you is your opportunity to begin a whole new journey into foods and wellbeing that will be unlike any you have ever embarked on before. This first week will teach you a lot about food and your relationship to it, and also how your body responds to different foods, but to really get an idea as to how this works and can benefit you, of course one week is but a drop in the ocean. If you choose to follow an all­raw vegan menu long term, then you may need to supplement. In fact, I would recommend you do, primarily because of the fact that our soils are deficient and food today is not like it was even as recently as a few dec ades ago. Most, if not all of us, are not receiving the nutrition that we ideally should. Going raw will improve matters immensely, but you still need to take care. In a future publication I’ll be going into the nutrition side of things a lot more so that you can check out your own diet to see how it shapes up nutritionally, but for now there’s no harm in familiarising yourself more with a good nutrition table that shows which foods contain which nutrients. As a general rule of thumb, for anyone considering eating an all­raw vegan diet for a prolonged period of time, I recommend taking a vitamin B12 supplement and also a liquid vitamin D if you don’t get a lot of sun. As always, take professional advice, and consider having some blood tests done early on into your journey so that you can see how your health profile changes over time as your diet improves. The final thing I must stress is that it is actually possible to eat an unhealthy raw food diet. I have seen people thrive on raw food and I have also see n them fail to thrive. The latter group simply don’t take enough care in what they eat and think that as long as it’s raw it’s good or enough. Not necessarily true. As mentioned throughout, it’s vital to eat from a wide"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 125 range of food groups and to utilise all of the selecting and shopping tips I shared with you in Step 2. It’s not enough to just think “raw”. You have to think fresh, whole, ripe and organic too, or you will only yield mediocre results. As time goes by and your experience and confidence increases , suddenly things that seem a bit mysterious now will all click into place and you’ll have that big “aha” moment where you realise that this REALLY IS as easy as I said it was! Largely this is all just a case of un­learning some old patterns and habits and learning some new, more beneficial ways of doing things and putting them in their place. Oh yes, and it’s about having lots of fun too!"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 126 The 3‐ day Pr ep Zon e For most people it’s usually unrealistic to think that you can dive straight into this, so I’d like you to decide upon a 10­day period (starting as soon as possible) where you feel that you will have a good chance of following a plan and have minimal interruptions in your diary. When you’ve found your 10­day window, mark it off in your diary and commit to giving it your best, knowing that this could very well be the start of something rather special! Please know, it’s not my intention for you to go out and buy every raw food ingredient going, or every piece of kitchen equipment on the list, or to throw out all of your usual foods and completely re­organise your kitchen! No, not at all. The information you learned earlier served as a teach­in – some of which will be useful now but most of it will be for later when you decide to what degree yo u’d like to bring raw foods into your diet after this first week. What To Do In The 3­Day Prep Zone 1. Clear your kitchen of any old food and any foods you no longer want to eat 2. Find or buy a blender – a cheap one will do for now if necessary. 3. Find or buy a hand blender or food processor . This is not important if you’re following Menus 1 or 2, but you will need one for Menu 3. 4. Put away as many cooked food appliances as possible , clean your kitchen well and see this as an outward symbol and commitment to a fresh start. 5. Purchase a ring binder to file this eBook in plus a set of dividers so that you can separate out the Kick­ Start Pack and Recipes from the rest of the book. 6. Do your food shopping . It’s hard for me to know the quantities you might eat, so I ’m going to leave that part up to you. However, I have supplied a shopping list guide for each menu that you can use as a foundation and add whatever you want. You can find these and the accompanying instructions later. 7. Consider keeping a journa l during your week. Seven days may not sound like a lot, but if you give the programme 100% I guarantee that you will have a lot to talk about – and all of it fascinating stuff!"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 127 8. Make a list of proje cts or things you’d like to do, start or finish during your “One Wee k Raw”. This can be as simple as giving the house a good spring clean, dealing with some outstanding paperwork, going swimming for the first time in a long while or going somewhere new at the weekend. As your energy rises you may very well find yourself wondering what to do with yourself next! While your old habit might have been to walk to the fridge to find something to get busy with in there, this week it’s time to be a little more expansive and take yourself out for the evening, immerse yourself in a good book or watch something uplifting and inspiring, or into the study to pursue your other interests. 9. And finally, please take 5 minutes to pick a worthy reward to give yourself at the end of the week. It might be a present of some kind, an indulgent body treat such as a massage, a night out on the town or a book or DVD you’d had your eye on for a while. But make this conditional! In order to receive your reward you have to follow the plan at least 90% of the time or you won’t have done what you set out to do. Agreed?!

Quite simply, when you have more energy or start to feel better generally then you’re going to feel like doing more and will be able to get more done than you may have done for a long time. Suddenly life has even more possibilities. There are lots of different ways you can do this, whether it’s taking a closer look at your lifestyle as a whole (do you need more sleep, relaxation time, fresh air, sunshine and so forth?) or looking at one aspect of your life such as finances, relationships, career, home, family or social life. You may choose to do some things differently as you start to feel as if you have more energy to do them. The athletic among you may have noticed that thus far I’ve made little reference to exercise and the importance of it. This is because most people just don’t do it and my focus is on getting the food right first so that the body has more inclination to move! Unbeknown to many, the body does need the right fuel to feel naturally inspired to move, so we’re starting here and the rest (hopefully!) will follow. That said, I do of course, encourage you to add some or more exercise into your week on raw. It doesn’t have to mean running a half ­ marathon or playing squash for the first time in a decade, but it does mean that it’s time to become a little more aware of what you do and don’t do throughout the course of your day and to consciously add in an extra walk or some basic stretches or yoga moves or something . By all means start small. Trying to launch into lots of different lifestyle habits all at once rarely works as we just feel overwhelmed and give up on the whole lot. We are very much creatures of habit and we have to start in one place, tweak that, get comfortable with it, master it or at least feel happy with it and then we can turn our attention to the next thing. This way we change over a period of time and these changes tend to stick as they’ve been integrated wisely and at a pace that works for us . So, do what you can do, but don’t beat yourself up about it. You can bring more movement into your day in su bsequent weeks as and when you feel more inclined. I’ve made a list of other ideas I have for you as to what you can do during this One Week Raw. There are lots of different things to choose from, all of which will help support you as you bring more raw foods into your diet and all tha t goes with that. Here they are:"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 129 Other things you can do to support yourself during this week and beyond are: ∑ Commit to do i ng this with a friend or if you’re alone with this at the moment join an online raw food chat group t o see what people are talking about. You might not understand everything right away, but you will learn a lot and make new friends. To find some to choose from, search within googlegroups or yahoogroups or search on “raw food chat group” through a normal s earch engine. ∑ Re­read this book and take in a new level of understanding as the week progresses. New things will become apparent and make more sense with every passing day. ∑ Choose to surround yourself with more positive people, surround ings and circumstances wherever possible. Nothing is more energy sapping than doing things you don’t want to do in a place you don’t want to do them and being around people you don’t want to be with. ∑ Check in with yourself each day for 5 minutes and either journal your experiences, thoughts and feelings or simply ask yourself “How did I do today?” Just take the time to do this for yourself so that you can reflect on what worked and what didn’t and why. ∑ Drink more water. I don’t want you to flood your body, but do bear in mind that you may start to release some toxins as your raw intake increases and they’ll need flushing out. So keep a glass or bottle of water near you at all times, and only drink a good clean water – not tap water, OK?! ∑ In line with this, do try to start your day with a glass of water to “wash yourself through”. Think of it as an internal shower! Help flush out what was released in the night as your body went through its cleansing cycle and when hunger strikes – by all means add some fresh lemon juice if you prefer. When you are hungry, and only then, then it’s time for breakfast. ∑ Treat yourself with compassion. Food is an emotive issue for almost everyone. Over the years it becomes our friend, our comfort, our distraction and much more besides. Sometimes we even define ourselves by our food choices, as in “I’m a vegetarian” or “I’m a meat eater”. Know that you can eat whatever you want to eat whenever you want to, and you are in control, free to change at any time and to dip in and out as when you want to. But at all times do acknowledge that all choices bear fruit, some better than others and learn what truly works for you. When you change your relationship with food there is bound to be some turbulence. This is to be expected. Just use your week as an op portunity to lightly ponder on what role food has played in your life thus far and learn more about yourself in the process."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 130 Health y cooke d optio ns Throughout this book I’ve been mentioning the importance of choosing your cooked items wisely. (Remember the sisters we met way back in the introduction and how different their diet was even though they both ate 50% raw?) Because your choice of cooked foods could make or break your success in your One Week Raw I’m devoting a special section to them here. Listed below are different cooked food groups with the healthiest suggestions within them . As you will see, you don’t have to give up anything, just choose healthier versions wherever possible. Just by making this one simple change you will feel very very different. In due course, in the follow­ up eBook to this, I will share with you some more advanced raw food recipes so that, if you so desire, you can create healthy raw versions of your cooked food favourites such as cakes, pizza and ice­cream – proving that raw food doesn’t have to stop at salads, soups and smoothies. But before I give you the list of healthy cooked foods to buy, I do need to let you know that the more raw food you eat, the more you will find that your taste buds begin to adjust to the more subtle flavours of natural foods and the more you will enjoy them and even crave them. In fact, you may well begin to find that other foods you’ve been keen to get rid of from your diet are no longer appealing anyway ­ they taste either too greasy, too spicy, too sweet, too salty, too bland or simply too synthetic generally. I have lost count of the number of people who have told me that they have found cooked food becoming unappealing and almost distasteful in a very short period of time after switching to more raw foods – even if their previous diet was at the other end of the dietary spectrum. (This happened to me). The purpose of this book, as you know, is to help you make the changes you wish to make and at the speed and to the degree you desire. As long as you are happy with the way you are progressing, the amount and speed is irrelevant. It may be that an all­raw diet may never be for you, who knows? The first requirement is simply that you’re happy and enjoying the journey as you find out more about raw and living foods and how they can personally benefit you . So for now, let’s look at those cooked or processed foods that you can be eating alongside your raw side dishes and use this list as a reference when you come to complete your shopping list, which follows after this section."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 131 Healthy Cooked Options Carbohydrates ∑ Whole wheat pasta (brown) ∑ Rice or millet pasta ∑ Wholegrain rice (brown) ∑ Organic wholemeal bread and rolls, with minimum added ingredients ∑ Rye bread or pumpernickel ∑ Sprouted wheat bread ∑ Steamed, boiled or baked yams, sweet potatoes or squash ∑ Steamed, boiled or baked vegetables of any kind ∑ Boiled organic potatoes ∑ Baked organic potatoes with skins ∑ Oven baked organic chips (fries) – ideally home made ∑ Organic porridge oats ∑ Organic muesli Proteins ∑ Minimally processed veggie burgers, sausages etc. – must be free from hydrogenated oils ∑ Organic vegetarian cheese, preferably raw (unpasteurised) and made from goat’s milk ∑ Organic unpasteurised goat’s milk ∑ Dairy­free yoghurts, or ‘live’ yoghurts without sugar ∑ Soya milk, rice milk or commercially produced almond milk ∑ Buckwheat, bulgur wheat, millet, couscous for steaming and eating with vegetables ∑ Free­range organic meat, fish or eggs Supermarket specials ∑ Good wholesome vegetable soups (or ideally, steam a lot of veggies and make your own with very hot water and a good vegetable stock cube and lots of fresh herbs) ∑ Stir fries with or without rice or couscous, organic frozen vegetables, such as corn on the cob and green beans, which can be gently steamed ∑ Good quality dips and deli items, such as hummous, guacamole, coleslaw, cooked beetroot, marinated olives, sun­dried tomatoes in oil and herbs, mango chutney, salsas, assorted salad bar items and so on."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 132 Other Healt hy Eating Pointers In all cases, and however much cooked food you eat , simply remain conscious of the need to continually ‘trade up’ as your diet evolves past week one and your health improves. Here are some other ideas for improving your diet in subtle but far­reaching ways as you begin to improve the cooked components of your diet: ∑ Swap commercial spreads like butter or margarine for avocado or hummous. ∑ Go for vegan mayo over the more synthetic and chemical­laden delicatessen varieties. ∑ Cut out or at least cut way down on frying an d roasting – cooked fats are a big no­ no, and definitely get rid of the microwave. ∑ Don’t buy anything with sugar or salt added , all the hopefully obvious things – no additives, preservatives, chemicals or E numbers. ∑ Go organic wherever possible. ∑ Go for whole foods without exception. ∑ Try to cook from scratch rather than relying on food manufacturers to do it for you. ∑ Invest in a juicer or dehydrator with the money you recoup from selling any electrical items that are better off out of your kitchen a nd out of your life! In all reality, you will find that your body naturally guides you towards and away from certain foods the more closely you pay attention to it. As strange as it may or may not sound now, it’s a self ­propelling process you’ll find har d to avoid. With this in mind, it’s my bet that in time, you too will find cooked food paling in comparison to the fresh, raw, live alternatives. Quite simply, cooked food has nothing to offer that raw food cannot match or, more likely, beat hands down! B ut that’s for you to find out for yourself – if you haven’t already. Now that we’ve covered all the preparatory work a nd information, it’s time to pull out your menu, your recipes and your healthy cooked items list and create your personal One Week Raw S hopping List.

Serve with crackers, as a side dish or mould into a large chunk and cut into cubes! ∂ RAW COACH TOP TIPS ∑ You can add all sorts of ingredients to this to get a different flavoured “cheese”. How about red bell pepper for a sweet cheese? Or sundried tomatoes for a salty one? This will carry a lot of favours really well. Add additional water to turn this from a “cheese” into a runny dressing or dip. ∑ If you have a cheese addiction, it may be that it’s actually a salt addiction masquerading as a cheese addiction! A lot of people love the saltiness of cheese but don’t realise this. So try adding a tiny bit of healthy salt to this recipe and see how you fare. Keeps for 5­7 days in refrigerat or.

I’ve left out tomatoes (though you don’t have to) and in comes the magical ingredient of cumin which makes it taste ju st divine! Mmmm. I could eat this for breakfast, lunch and d inner! Equipment None Ingredients ∑ 2 ripe avocadoes ∑ 1­2 teaspoons of cumin powder (to your taste, and depends on size of avocadoes) ∑ Juice of 1­2 lemons (depending on sweetness and amount of juice) ∑ 1 small onion (red onion works better) Directions 1. Slice your avocadoes in half and remove the pits. (NB: It’s important that they’re ripe – to check, they must “give” a little when squeezed). Remove the flesh and spoon into a bowl. Mash well with a fork, adding the lemon juice if it’s hard going! 2. Add in the cumin powder (err on the side of caution first and add less than you think you might need), the lemon juice and very finely chopped onion. 3. Mix all ingredients together by hand making sure the cumin and onion are spread evenly throughout the mixture. 4. Taste­test. Adapt as desired. If you like tomato in your guacamole, now’s the time to add it! ∂ RAW COACH TOP TIPS ∑ Don’t be afraid to add more ingredients to this recipe – tomato, red pepper, coriander (cilantro), basil, swap onion for garlic – it’s all up to you. ∑ If you’re making a large batch and need to keep it fresh for a few hours, put the avocado stones (pits) in the bowl with the mixture and cover well. Refrigerate. All of these things will help it stay looking and tasting good."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 142 Kale and Avocado Salad This salad is based on a recipe taught to me by top raw food chef Chad Sarno. This is one of Chad’s all­time favourite raw recipes and it’s also one of mine too – kale treated this way is scrumptious, trust me! In fact, this meal really hits the spot – it’s delicious, filling and e xtremely nutritious. Equipment None Ingredients ∑ 8 large handfuls of green curly kale ∑ Sprinkle of Celtic sea salt OR Himalayan crystal salt ∑ 1­2 Tablespoons of olive oil ∑ 1 ripe avocado ∑ 2 large tomatoes OR a handful of baby plum tomatoes ∑ OPTIONAL: 2 spring oni ons ∑ OPTIONAL: 8 sun dried tomatoes in oil ∑ DRESSING: Squeeze of fresh lemon juice Directions 1. Chop the kale up into tiny pieces measuring roughly 1­ 2cm square and put into a bowl. 2. Add 1­2 tablespoons of olive oil plus a small sprinkling of sea salt to the kale and massage well into the leaves until they are glistening and look succulent. If they need more oil, add accordingly. 3. Chop up 1 avocado into small pieces, add to the kale and massage in well, coating the leaves. It is fine to leave pieces of avocado sitting amongst the leaves as well as coating them. 4. Chop tomatoes into small cubes and add to bowl. Similarly finely slice the optional spring onions and sun dried tomatoes – both of which I personally love. 5. Mix all ingredients well by hand – a very tactile and delicious experience! Make sure that all ingredients are spread evenly throughout the bowl. Sprinkle with some fresh lemon juice and serve as is or pile high on to a plate and garnish with tomatoes. ∂ RAW COACH TOP TIPS ∑ By adding the oil and salt to the leaves the kale releases some of its moisture thereby making it much juicier in both taste and appearance. This treatment of kale makes it much more delicious and palatable, making all the difference for many people who ordinarily don’t like kale as is."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 143 Veggie­Nut Burgers These are fresh and tasty “burgers” that require no cooking.

Put all ingredients into a food processor, or use a hand blender if you don’t have one. 2. Taste test – if you think it needs more spice, add some fresh or dried herbs or seasonings. Curry powder can w ork well! 3. Shape into burger shapes, either by hand, or using a mould. ∂ RAW COACH TOP TIPS ∑ You can turn this into a nut loaf by shaping into a loaf shape by hand or using a tin, or you can dehydrate the burgers a little or a lot to your desired consistency and/or taste.

Lay the nori sheet out flat on a plate or cutting board and place strips of avocado along the near edge about an inch in from the outside of the sheet. 2. Next, lay on top of the avocado some strips of tomato followed by strips of onion then topped with halved olives or the sundried tomatoes. 3. Finally top it all off with your chosen greens. 4. Roll up, either by hand or using a sushi mat, cut into small bit­sized pieces or leave as is and enjoy! ∂ RAW CO ACH TOP TIPS ∑ This recipe is just for starters. You can make infinite different nori roll fillings – just make sure that you have one “heavy” filling such as avocado, a pâté or similar, and some wet and juicy ones like tomato, cucumber or bell pepper. ∑ If making a nori roll that seems too full or has too many “wet” ingredients in it, use one large lettuce leaf to top the lot and then roll your nori – this protects the nori from becoming too wet and falling apart."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"www.TheRawFoodCoach.com Page 145 Almond Hummous This alternative to chickpea­ based hummous is tasty, filling and great just as it is or served on crackers or with crudités.

Place the almonds (or almond butter) and water in a blender and blend until all the almonds are broken up (or the almond butter is properly mixed in). 2.
