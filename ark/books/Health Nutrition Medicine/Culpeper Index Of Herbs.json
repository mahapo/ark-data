Courteous Reader, Aristot le, in his Metaphysicks writing of the Nature of Man, hit the Nail on the Head when he said, That Man is naturally enclined to, and desirous of Knowledg: and indeed it is palpable and apparent, that as Pride is the first visible sin in a child, whereby we may gather that it was the first sin of Adam; so Knowledg being the first Vertue a Child minds, as is apparent to them that do but with the eye of Reason heed their actions even whilst they are very yong, even before they are a yeer old, even by natural in stinct, whereby a man may more than guess that Knowledg was the greatest loss, or at least one of the greatest we lost by the fall of Adam: Knowledg, saith Aristotle, is in Prosperity an Ornament, in Adversity a Refuge; and truly there is almost no greater enemy to Knowledg in the world that Pride and Covetousness; Excellently said, Juvenal, Sat. 7. Scire volunt omnes, mercedem solvere nemo. Although all men, in Knowledg take delight, Yet they love money better, that's the spight. And again, some men are so damnable proud and envious withal, that they would have no body know any thing but themselves; the one I hope will shortly learn better manners, and the other be a burden too heavy for the Earth long to bear. The Subject which I here fixed my thoughts upon is not only the Description and Nature of Herbs, which had it been all, I had authority sufficient to bear me out in it, for Solomon employed part of that wisdom he asked, and received of God in searching after them, which he wrote in Books, even of a ll Herbs, Plants and Trees; some say those Writings were carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar; being kept in the Temple at Jerusalem for the publick view of the People, but being transported to Babylon in the Captivity, Alexander the GREAT TYRANT at the ta king of Babylon gave them to his Master Aristotle, who committed them to the mercy of the fire. But since the daies of Solomon, many have those famous men been that have written of this Subject, and great Encouragements have [A verso] been given them by Princes, of which I shall quote an example or two, Mathiolus his greediness was such to finish his Comment upon Dioscorides, which Book is yet in use in the famous Universities in Leyden in Holland, & Mountpilier in France, that he forgot to count what th e charges of it might amount to, although I rather comend him for his dilligence in Studie and Care of the Worlds good, than harbor the least ill thought of him for not counting the middle and both ends before he began the Work, I say when he came to count the charges of Printing and cutting the Cuts, it far surmounted his Estate; in this he was abundantly furnished by Ferdinand the Emperor, and diverse other Princes of Germany, as himself confessed furnished him with great sums of money, for perfecting"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 tha t so great, so good a Work; the Prince Elector of Saxony sent him much money towards his charge, as also Joachim, Marquess of Brandenburg, who as he was neighbor to Saxony in Place, so was he in Affection to so good a Work; Frederick, Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Cardinal Prince of Trent, the Arch Bishop of Saltzberg, the Dukes of Bavaria and Cleveland, and the Free State of Norimberg, together with many others, so that he had the help of the Emperor, of Arch Dukes, Dukes, Electors, Cardinals, Princes. Happie is that Nation whose Magistrates countenance such as mind and study their Good: I might instance in many more, and thereby give you a glimps how Magistrates formerly favored this Art, and which is more, how studious they were in it. Bellonius a man that soared high in the Nature of Herbs, also professed he had the helping hand of Kings and Cardinals to maintain him in his Studies, and more than this, kings themselves were Studious in it; amongst which (Solomon excepted) Mithridates that renowned King of Pontus seems to bear away the Bell, his Writings after his death were found in his Country Mannor by Pompey the great, but never a Roman of them all had the honesty to print them with his name in the Frontispiece, so that we have nothing of them but wh at is quoted by some honest Authors, especially by Plutarch. Ad nos vix tenuis fame dilabitur aura. Men mind our good, but such cross times do fall, We only hear they did, and that is all. Mesue King of Damascus, Avicenna, and Evax King of Arabia, labor ed much in this Study, and I could well have afforded to have mentioned Dioclesian the Roman Emperor had he not washed out his Vertues, and defiled them with a Purple stain, in a most bloody persecution of Christians. It is quoted in Virgil, that when a fa mous Prince was proffered by Apollo to be taught his Arts, viz. Physick, Musick, Augury, and the Art of Shooting in the Bow, he made choice of Physick and to know the Nature of Herbs. [A2 recto] Ipse suas artes, sua munera, laetus Appollo Augurium, Cithe ramq; dedit, celerefs; sagittas, Ille, ut depositi preferret fata Parentis Scire potestates Herbarum, usumq; Medendi Maluit: & mutas agitare(inglorias) Artes. His Arts to him, when great Appollo gave, He did nor Augury, nor Arrows crave, Nor the Melodius Lute, but to prevent His Fathers death, who now with age was spent, To be an Herbarist, and Medicine To learn, he rather did his thoughts incline. So precious hath the knowledg of the Vertues of Herbs been in former times to men of quality, and indeed hap py is that Nation, whose Rulers mind Knowledg, as Solomon saith                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 on the contrary, Wo to that Nation whose King is a Child, and indeed in Ancient times people need little other Physick than such Herbs as grew neer them, some Footsteps of which and but a few only, are now in use with us to this day, as people usually boyl Fennel with Fish, and know not why they do it but only for custom, when indeed the Original of it was founded upon Reason, because Fennel consumes that Flegmatick quality of Fish, which is ob noxious to the Body of man, Fennel being an Herb of Mercury, and he so great an Enemie to the Sign Pisces. In this Art the Worthies of our own Nation, Gerard, Johnson, and Parkinson are not to be forgotten, who did much good in the Studie of this Art, yet they and all others that wrote of the Nature of Herbs, gave not a bit of a reason why such an Herb was apropriated to such a part of the Body, nor why it cured such a Disease; truly my own body being sickly brought me easily into a capacitie to know that Health was the greatest of all Earthly Blessings, and truly he was never sick that doth not beleeve it; then I considered that all Medicines were compounded of Herbs, Roots, Flowers, Seeds &c. and this first set me awork in studying the Nature of Simples, most of which I knew by sight before, and indeed all the Authors I could reade gave me but little satisfaction in this particular, or none at all; I cannot build my faith upon authors words, nor beleeve a thing because they say it, and could wish every bod ie were of my mind in this, to labor to be able to give a reason for every thing they say or do; they say reason makes a man differ from a Beast, if that be true, pray what are they that instead of Reason for their judgment, quote old Authors, perhaps thei r Authors knew a reason for what they Wrote, perhaps they did not, what is that to us, do we know it? Truly in writing this Work first, to satisfie my self I drew out all the Vertues of vulgar Herbs, Plants, and Trees &c. out of the best and most approved Authors I had or could get, and having done so, I set my self to studie the Reason of [A2 verso] them; I knew well enough the whol world and every thing in it was formed of a Composition of contrary Elements, and in such a harmony as must needs shew the wisdom and Power of a great God. I knew as well this Creation though thus composed of contraries was one united Body, and man an Epitome of it, I knew those various affections in man in respect of Sickness and Health were caused Naturally (though God may h ave other ends best known to himself) by the various operations of the Macrocosm; and I could not be ignorant, that as the Cause is, so must the Cure be, and therefore he that would know the Reason of the operation of Herbs must look up as high as the Star s; I alwaies found the Disease vary according to the various motion of the Stars, and this is enough one would think to teach a man by the Effect where the Cause lay: Then to find out the Reason of the Operation of Herbs, Plants, &c. by the Stars went I, a nd herein I could find but few Authors, but those as full of nonsense and contradictions as an Egg is full of meat, this being little pleasing, and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two Brothers, Dr. REASON, and Dr. EXPERIENCE, by whose advice tog ether with the help o f D r .

Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 But you will say, What need I have written of this Subject, seing so many famous and learned men have written so much of it in the English Tongue, nay much more than I have done? To this I Answer, 1. All that have written of Herbs either in the English or not in the English Tongue, have no waies answered my intents in this Book, for the y have intermixed many, nay very many outlandish Herbs, and very many which are hard, nay not at all to be gotten, and what harm this may do I am very sensible of. Once a Student in Physick in Sussex sent up to London to me, to buy for him such and such Me dicines, and send them down, which when I viewed, they were Medicines quoted by authors living in another Nation, and not to be had in London for Love nor Money, so the poor man had spent much pains and Brains in studying Medicines for a Disease that were not to be had; so a man reading Gerards or Parkinsons Herbal for the Cure of a Disease so may as like as not, light on an Herb that is not here to be had, or not without great diffuculty, if possible; but in mine, all grow neer him. 2. My last, though not the least of my Reasons is, Neither Gerard nor Parkinson nor any that ever wrote in the like Nature, ever gave one wise Reason for what they wrote, and so did nothing els but train up yong Novices in Physick in the School of Tradition, and teach them just as a Parrot is taught to speak, an Author saith so, therefore 'tis true, and if all that Authors say be true, why do they contradict one another? But in mine, if you view it with the Eye of Reason, you shall see a Reason for every thing that is written, w hereby you may find the very Ground and Foundation of Physick, you may know [B recto] what you do, and wherefore you do it, and this shall call me Father, it being (that I know of) never done in the world before. I have now but two things more to write and then I have done. 1. What the profit and benefit of this Work is. 2. Instructions in the Use of it. 1. The Profit and Benefits arising from it, or that may acrue to a wise man, from it are many, so many that should I sum up all the particulars, the E pistle would be as big as the Book; I shall only quote some few general Heads. First, The admirable Harmony of the Creation is herein seen, in the Influence of Stars upon Herbs and the Body of man, how one part of the Creation is subservient to another, a nd all for the use of man whereby the Infinite Power and Wisdom of God in the Creation appears; and if I do not admire at the simplicity of the Ranters, never trust me, who but viewing the Creation can hold such a sottish Opinion, as that it was from etern ity, when the Mysteries of it are so cleer to everie eye; but that Scripture shall be verified to them, Rom. I. 20. The invisible things of Him from the Creation of the world are cleerly seen,                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse. And a Poet could teach them a better Lesson. Excideret ne tibi divini muneris author Presentem monstrat; qualibet Herba Deum. Because out of thy thoughts God should not pass, His Image stamped is on eve ry Grass. This indeed is true, God hath stamped his Image upon every Creature, and therefore the abuse of the Creature is a great sin; but how much more doth the Wisdom and Excellencie of God appear if we consider the Harmony of the Creation in the Vertue and Operation of every Herb; this is the first. Secondly, Hereby thou maist know what infinite Knowledg Adam had in his Innocencie, that by looking upon a Creature, he was able to give it a name according to his Nature, and by knowing that, thou maist kn ow how great thy fall was, and be humbled for it even in this respect, because hereby thou are so ignorant. Thirdly, Here is the right way for thee to begin the study of Physick if thou art minded to begin at the right end, for here thou hast the Reason o f the whol Art. I wrote before in certain Astrological Lectures which I read, and printed, intituled Semeiotica Uranica what Planet caused (as a second Cause) every Disease, and how it might be found out what Planet caused it; here thou hast what Planet cu res it by Sympathy and Antipathy; and this brings me to my last premise, Viz. Instructions for the right use of the Book. And herein let me promise a word or two, Many Herbs, Plants, &c [B verso] are not in the Book apropriated to their propper Planets , the Reason was, want of time, or some other thing else, which many that know me will easily guess at; at last the Book hanging longer in the Press that I imagine it would, I took the time and pains (though I could ill have spared either) to apropriate th em all, and have for thy benefit (Courteous Reader) inserted them in order after the Epistle, now then for thy Instruction, First, Consider what Planet causeth the Disease; that thou maist find in my Semeiotia. Secondly, Consider what part of the Body is afflicted by the Disease, and whether it lie in the Flesh, or Blood, or Bones, or Ventricles. Thirdly, Consider by what Planet the afflictd part of the Bodie is governed; that my Semeiotica will inform you in also."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 Fourthly, You have in this Book the He rbs for Cure apropriated to the Several Diseases, and the Diseases for your ease set down in the Margin, whereby you may strengthen the part of the Bodie by its like, as the Brain by Herbs of Mercury, the Breast and Liver by Herbs of Jupiter, the Heart and Vitals by Herbs of the Sun, &c. Fifthly, You may oppose Diseases by Herbs of the Planet opposite to the Planet that causeth them, as Diseases of Jupiter by Herbs of Mercury, and the contrary; Diseases of the Luminaries by Herbs of Saturn, and the contrar y; Diseases of Mars by Herbs of Venus, and the contrary. Sixthly, There is a way to cure Diseases somtimes by Sympathy, and so every Planet cures his own Diseases, as the Sun and Moon by their Herbs cure the Eyes, Saturn the Spleen, Jupiter the Liver, Mar s the Gall and Diseases of Choller, and Venus Diseases in the Instruments of Generation. Seventhly, There was a small Treatise of mine of Humane Vertues, printed at the latter end of my Ephemeris for the yeer 1651. I suppose it would do much good to yong Students to peruse that with this Book. Eighthly, Yong Students would do themselves much good, and benefit themselves exceedingly in the Study of Physick if they would tak the pains to view the Vertues of the Herbs &c. in the Book, and compare them to the se Rules, they shall to their exceeding great content find them all agreeable to them, and shall thereby see the reason why such an Herb conduceth to the Cure of such a Disease. Ninthly, I gave you the Key of al in the Herb Wormwood, which if because of t he volubility of the Language, any think it would not fit the Lock, I will here give it you again in another Herb of the same Planet which in the Book either through my own forgetfulness, or my Amanuensis was omitted, and here I shal give it you plainly wi thout any circumstances. The Herb is Carduus Benedictus. It is called Carduus Benedictus, or blessed Thistle or holy Thistle, I suppose the name was put uppon it by some that had little Holiness in [B2 recto] themselves: It is an Herb of Mars, and unde r the Sign Aries; now in handling this Herb, I shall give you a rational Pattern of all the rest, and if you please to view them throughout the Book, you shall to your content find it true. It helps Swimming and giiddiness of the Head, or the Disease call ed Vertigo, because Aries is the House of Mars. It is an excellent Remedy against the yellow Jaundice, and other infirmities of the Gall, because Mars governs Choller.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 It strengthens the attractive faculty in man, and clarifies the Blood, because the one is ruled by Mars. The continual drinking the Decoction of it helps red Faces, Tetters, and Ringworms because Mars causeth them. It helps Plague sores, Boils, and Itch, the Biting of mad Dogs and venemous Beasts, all which infirmities are under Mars. Thu s you see what it doth by Sympathy. By Antypathy to other Planets. It cures the French Pox by Antypathy to Venus who governs it. It strengthens the Memory and cures Deafness by Antipathy to Saturn who hath his Fall in Aries which Rules the Head. It cur es Quartan Agues, and other Diseases of Melancholly and adult Choller by Sympathy to Saturn, Mars being exalted in Capricorn. Also it provokes Urine, the stopping of which is usually caused by Mars or the Moon. If you please to make use of these Rules, y ou shall find them true throughout the Book, and by heeding them, you may be able to give a Reason of your Judgment to him that asketh you: I assure you it gave much content to me, and for your goods did I pen it; but I must conclude, my Epistle having exc eeded its Bounds alreadie; hereby you see what Reason may be given for Medicines, and what necessity there is for every Physitian to be an Astrologer, you have heard it before I suppose, but now you know it; what remains, but that you labor to glorifie God in your several places, and do good to your selves first by encreasing your Knowledg, and to your Neighbors afterwards by helping their Infirmities; some such I hope this Nation is worthy of, and to such shall I remain a Friend, during life, readie to my poor power to help.

This small H erb hath but one Leaf; which grows with the Stalk a fingers length above the ground, being fat, and of a fresh green colour, broad like the Water Plantane (but less) without any middle Rib in it: from the bottom of which Leaf on the inside, riseth up (ordi narily) one, somtimes two or three small slender stalks, the upper half wherof is somwhat bigger, and dented with smal round dents of a yellowish green colour, like the Tongue of an Adder or Serpent (only this is as useful as they are formidable) The Root continues all the year. Place. It groweth in moist Meadows, and such like places. Time. And is to be found in April and May, for it quickly perisheth with a little heat. Vertues and Use. It is temperate, in respect of heat, but dry in the Second Degr ee. The Juyce of the Leaves drunk with the distilled Water of Horstail is a singular Remedy for all manner of wounds in the Breast, Bowels, or other parts of the body, and is given with good success unto those who are troubled with Casting, Vomiting, or bl eeding at the Mouth or Nose, or otherwise downwards. The said Juyce given in the distilled Water of Oaken Buds is very good for Women who have their usual Courses, or the Whites flowing down too abundantly. It helps sore Eyes. The Leaves infused or boyled in Oyl Omphacine, or unripe Olives set in the Sun for certain daies, or the green Leaves sufficiently boyled in the said Oyl, is made an excellent green Balsom, not only for green and fresh Wounds, but also for old and inveterate Ulcers, especially if a li ttle fine clear Turpentine be dissolved therin: It also stayeth and represseth all inflamations that arise upon pains, by Hurts, or Wounds.

AGRIMONY. Description. This hath divers long leaves (some greater, some smaller) set upon a Stalk, all of them dented about the edges, green above, and [p. 2] grayish underneath, and a little hairy withal: Among which ariseth up usually, but one strong, round, hairy, brown Stalk, two or three Foot high, with smaller Leaves set here and there upon it, at the top wherof grow many smal yellow Flowers one ab ove another in long Spikes: after which come rough heads of Seeds hanging downwards which wil cleave to and stick upon Garments or any thing that shal rub against them. The Root is black, long, and somwhat woody, abiding many yeers and shooting afresh ever y Spring which Root, though smal hath a reasonable good scent. Place. It groweth upon Banks near the sides of Hedges, or Pales. Time. And it Flowreth in July and August, the Seed being ripe shortly after. Vertues and Uses. It is of a clensing and cut ting faculty without any manifest heat, moderately drying and binding; It openeth and clenseth the Liver, helpeth the Jaundice, and is very beneficial to the Bowels, healing all inward Wounds, Bruises, Hurts, and other distempers. The Decoction of the Herb made with Wine and drunk is good against the stinging and biting of Serpents, and helps them that have foul, troubled, or bloody waters, and makes them piss cleer spedily; It also helpeth the Chollick, clenseth the Breast, and rids away the Cough. A draug ht of the Decoction taken warm before the fit, first removes, and in time rids away the Tertian or Quartan Agues; The Leaves and Seed taken in Wine, stayeth the Bloody Flux. Outwardly applied, being stamped with old Swines grease, it helpeth old sores, Can cers, and inveterate Ulcers; and draweth forth Thorns, Splinters or Wood, Nails, or any other such thing gotten into the Flesh; it helpeth to strengthen the Members that be out of joynt; and being bruised and applied, or the Juyce dropped in, it helpeth fo ul and imposthumed Ears.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

The distilled Water of the Herb is good to all the said purposes, either inward or outward, but a great deal weaker.

THE BLACK ALDER - TREE. Description. This Tree seldom groweth to any great bigness, but for the most part abideth like a Hedg, Bush, or Tree spreading into Branches, the Wood of the Body being white, and of a dark, red Core or Heart; the outward Bark is of a blackish colour, with many white spots theron: but the inner Bark next unto the Wood is yellow, which being che wed will turn the Spittle neer unto a Saffron colour. The Leaves are somwhat like those of the ordinary Alder - Tree, or the Foemale Cornel, or Dogberry - Tree, called in Sussex Dog - wood, but blacker, and not so long. The Flowers are white, coming forth with t he Leaves at the Joynts, which turn into small round Berries, first green, afterwards red, but blackish when they are through ripe, divided as it were into two parts, wherin is contained two small round and flat Seeds: The Root runneth not deep into the Gr ound, but spreadeth rather under the upper crust of the earth. Place. This Tree or Shrub may be found plentifully in St. Johns Wood by Hornsey, and in the Woods upon Hamsted Heath; as also at a Wood called the old Park in Barcomb in Sussex, near the Broo ks side. Time. It Flowereth in May, and the Berries are ripe in September. Vertues and Use. The inner yellow Bark herof purgeth downwards both Choller & Flegm, & the watry humors of such as have the Dropsie, and strengtheneth the inward parts again by binding. [EDGENOTE:] Choller, Flegm. If the Bark hereof be boyled with Agrimony, Wormwood, Dodder, Hops, and some Fennel, with Smalledg, Endive, and Succory Roots, and a reasonable draught taken every morning for some time together, it is very effectual against the Jaundice, Dropsie, and the evil disposition of the Body, especially if some sutable purging Medicine have been taken before to avoid the grosser excrements; [EDGENOTE:] Jaundice, Dropsy, Cachexia, Liver, Spleen. It purgeth and strengtheneth th e Liver and Spleen, clensing them from such evil humors, and hardness as they are afflicted with: It is to be understood that these things are performed by the dryed Bark, for the fresh green Bark taken inwardly provoketh strong Vomitings, pains in the Sto mach, and gripings in the Belly: Yet if the Decoction may stand and settle two or three daies until the yellow colour be changed black, it will not work so strongly as before, but will strengthen the Stomach, and procure an Appetite to Meat.

Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 The outer Bark contrarywise doth bind the Body, and is helpful for all Lasks and Fluxes therof, but this must also be dried first, wherby it wil work the better. The inner Bark her of boyled in Vinegar, is an approved remedy to kill Lice, to cure the Itch, and take away Scabs by drying them up in a short time: It is singular good to wash the Teeth, to take away the Pains, to fasten those that are loos, to clens them, to keep them sou nd. The Leaves are good Fodder for Kine to make them give more Milk. If in the Spring time you use the Herbs be - [p. 4] fore mentioned and will but take a handful of each of them, and to them ad a handful of Elder Buds, and having bruised them all, boyl them in a Gallon of ordinary Beer when 'tis new, and having boyled them half an hour, ad this to three Gallons more, and let them work together, and drink a draught of it every morning half a pint or there about: It is an excellent Purge for the Spring, t o consume that Flegmatick quality the Winter hath left behind it, and withal keep your Body in health, and consume those evil humors which the heat of Summer will readily stir up, esteem it as a Jewel. THE COMMON ALDER - TREE. Description. Groweth to a re asonable heighth, and spreads much if it like the place; It is so generally wel known unto Country People that I conceive it needless to tel them that which is no news. Place and Time. It delighteth to grow in moist Woods and watry places, Flowring in Ap ril or May and yeilding ripe Seed in September. Vertues and Use. The Leaves and Bark of the Alder - Tree, are cooling, drying, and binding, The fresh Leaves laid upon swelling, dissolveth them, and staieth the Inflamations; The Leaves [EDGENOTE:] Cooling, Drying, Binding, Swellings, Fleas. put under the bare Feet gauled with travelling are a great refreshing to them: The said Leaves gathered while the morning dew is on them, and brought into a chamber troubled with Fleas, wil gather them therinto, which b eing suddenly cast out wil rid the Chamber of those troublesom Bed - fellows. It is a Tree under the Dominion of Venus, and of some watry Sign or other, I suppose Pisces, and therfore the Decoction, or distilled Water of the Leaves is excellent against Burn ings, and Inflamation, either with Wounds or without, to bath the place grieved with, and especially for that inflamation in the Breast which the vulgar call an Ague.

To write a Description of that which is so well known to be growing in almost every Garden, I suppose is altogether needless: yet for its Vertues it is of admirable use. In times of Heathenism when men had found out any excellent Herb &c. they dedicated it to their gods, As the Bay - tree to Apollo, the Oak to Jupiter, the Vine to Bacchus, the Poplar to Hercules: These the Papists following as their Patriarchs, they dedicate them to their Saints, as our Ladies Thistle to the Blessed Virgin, St. Johns Wort to St. John, and another Wort to St. Peter, &c. Our Physitians must imitate like Apes, (though they cannot come off half so cleverly) for they Blasphemously call Pansies, or Hartseas, an Herb of t he Trinity, because it is of three colours: and a certain Oyntment, an Oyntment of the Apostles, because it consisteth of twelve Ingredients; Alas poor Fools, I am sorry for their folly, and grieved at their Blasphemy; God send them the rest of their Age, for they have their share of Ignorance already; O! why must ours be Blasphemous becaus the Heathens and Papists were Idolatrous? certainly they have read so much in old rustie Authors, that they have lost all their Decmity, for unless it were amongst the r anters, I never read or heard of such Blasphemy: The Heathens and Papists were bad, and ours wors, the Papists giving Idolatrous Names to Herbs for their Vertues sake, not for their fair looks; and thefore some called this an Herb of the Holy Ghost, others more moderate called it Angelica, becaus of its Angelical Vertues, and that name it retains still, and all Nations follow it so near as their Dialect will permit. Vertues and Uses. It resists Poyson, by defending and comforting the Heart, Bleed, and Spi rits, it doth the like against the Plague, and all Epidemical Diseases if the Root be taken in pouder to the waight of half a dram at a time with some good Triacle in Cardus Water, and the party therupon laid to sweat in his Bed. If Treacle be not at hand, take it [EDGENOTE:] Poyson, Pestilence, Epidemical Diseases. alone in Cardus or Angelica Water. The Stalks or Roots candied and eaten fasting are good Preservatives in time of Infection; and at other times to warm and comfort a cold Stomach. The Root al so steeped in Vinegar, and a little of that Vinegar taken somtimes fasting, and the Root smelled unto is good for the same purpose. A water distilled from the Root simply, or steeped in Wine and distilled in Glass, is much more effectual than the Water of the Leaves; and this Water drunk two or three spoonfuls at a time, easeth all Pains and Torments coming of Cold and Wind, so as the Body be not bound: and taken with some of the Root in Pouder at the beginning helpeth the Pluresy, as also all other Disease s of the Lungues and Breast, as Coughs, Phthisick, and shortness of Breath; and a Syrup of the [p. 5]"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 Stalks doth the like: It helps pains of the Colick, the Strangury, and stopping of the Urin, procureth Womens Courses, and expelleth the After - birth, op eneth the stoppings of the Liver and Spleen, and briefly easeth and discusseth al windiness and inward swellings. The Decoction drunk before the fit of an Ague, that they may sweat (if possible) before the fit come, wil in two or three times taking rid it quite away: It helps digestion, [EDGENOTE:] Chollick, provokes the Terms, afterbirth, stoppings of the Liver and Spleen, Indigestion, Surfets, Toothach, biting of Mad - dogs. and is a remedy for a Surfet. The Juyce or the Water being dropped into the Eyes or Ears, helps dimness of sight and deafness: The Juyce put into the hollow Teeth, easeth their pains. The Roots in Pouder made up into a Plaister with a little Pitch; and laid on the biting of a mad - Dog, or any other venemous creature, doth wonderfully he lp: The Juyce or the Water dropped, or tents wet therin, and put into old filthy deep Ulcers, Or the Pouder of the Root (in want of either) doth clens and cause them to heal quickly, by covering the naked Bones with Flesh. The distilled Water applied to pl aces pained with the Gout or Sciatica, doth give a great deal of ease. [EDGENOTE:] Ulcers, Gout, Sciatica. The wild Angelica is not so effectual as the Garden, although it may be safly used to all the purpose aforesaid. It is an Herb of the Sun in Leo; let it be gathered when he is there, the Moon applying to his good Aspect; let it be gathered either in his hour, or in the hour of Jupiter, let Sol be angular. Observe the like in gathering the Herbs of other Plants, and you may happen do wonders. In all Epidemical Diseases caused by Saturn this is as good a Preservative as grows. APPLES. A Word or two of the most usual kinds of Apples, though the Colledg of Physitians make use of none but such as Vulgo vulgati, Pearmains, vel Pippins. Apples in general are cold and windy, and being of sundry tasts, Galen sheweth thereby how to distinguish them: Som have a sharp tast, and are good for fainting Stomachs and loos Bellies; others sowr, good to cool and quench thirst; som sharp, fit to cut gross flegm; som s weet, soon destributed in the Body, and as soon passed away, yet sooner corrupted in the Stomach if they be staid: The best sorts before they be throughly ripe are to be avoided; then to be roasted or scalded is the best [EDGENOTE:] Fainting Stomach, Loos Bellies, Thirst, Flegm. way to take them and a little Spice or Seeds cast upon them and taken after meat, do strengthen both Stomach and Bowels, especially in those that loath, or hardly digest their meat, or are given to casting, or have a Flux or Lask: Those that are a little sowr and harsh used in that manner are fittest: Sweet Apples loosen the Belly and drive forth                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 Worms; Sowr Apples stop the Belly, and provoke Urin; and Crabs for this purpose are fittest: The sweet Apples as the Pippin and Pearmain, help to dissolve Melancholly humors, and to procure Mirth, and therfore are [EDGENOTE:] Stomach, Bowels, Vomiting, Flux, Loosen Worms, Melancholly, Agues, heat of the Liver and Stomach. fittest for Confectio Alkermes, and Syrupus de Pomis. The Leavs boy led and given to drink in hot Agues, where the heat of the Liver and Stomach causeth the Lips to break out, and the Throat to grow dry, harsh and furred, is very good to wash and gargle it withal, and to drink down som. This may to good purpose be used whe n better things are not at hand, or cannot be had. The Juyce of Crabs either Verjuyce or Cider, is of singular good use in the Heat and faintings of the Stomach, and against Casting to make a Posset with, or taken som of it alone by it self. The Juyce of C rabs, or Cider applied with wet cloaths therein to scalded or burnt places, cooleth, healeth, and draweth forth the Fire. A rotten Apple applied to Eyes bloodshotten, or enflamed with heat, or that are black and blue about them by any stroke of fall, and b ound too all day or night, helpeth them quickly. The distilled Water [EDGENOTE:] Scalding, Burning, Eyes, Inflamation, Ulcers, Spots, Freckles. of rotten Apples doth cool the heat and inflamations of Sores, and is good to bath foul creeping Ulcers, and t o wash the Face to take away Spots, Freckles or other discolorings. The distilled Water of good and sound Apples is of special good use to procure Mirth, and expel Melancholly. The ointment called Pomatum, if sweet and well made, helpeth the Chops in the L ips or Hands, and maketh smooth and supple the rough Skin of the Hands or Face parched with wind or other accidents. [EDGENOTE:] Chaps in the Lips & Hands. Thus my Authors. All that I can say of Apples is this: 1 That they are extream windy. 2 That they provoke Urin, being roasted (especially Pomwaters) and mixed with fair Water, and drunk up at night going to bed; half a dozen great ones mixed with a quart of Water, excellently provokes Urin, if there be no material stone in the Body: This I had of Gerha rd, and have often known it proved, and alwaies with good success. All Apples loosen the Belly and pleasure the Stomach by their coolness. ARRACH WILD & STINKING. Description. This hath small and almost round Leaves, yet a little pointed and without den t or cut, of a dusky mealy colour, growing on the slender Stalks and Branches that spread on the ground, with smal Flowers in clusters set with"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

It smels like old rotten Fish, or somthing worse. Place. It grows usually upon Dunghills. Time. They flower in June and July, and their Seed is ripe quickly after. Vertues and Use. Stinking Arrach is used as a remedy to help Women pained, and almost strangled with the Mother, by smelling to it: But inwardly taken, there is not a better Remedy under the Moon for that Disease. I would be large in commendation of this Herb, were I but Eloquent. It is an [EDGENOTE:] Mother, Herb under the dominio n of Venus, and under the sign Scorpio: It is common almost upon every Dunghil. The Works of God are given freely to Man, his Medicins are common and cheap, and easie to be found: 'tis the Medicines of the Colledg of Physitians that are so dear and scarce to find) I commend it for an Universal Medicine for the Womb, and such a Medicine as will easily, safly, and speedily cure any Diseas therof, as the fits of the Mother, Dislocation or falling out therof; it cools the [EDGENOTE:] Womb. Womb being over - hea ted. (And let me tel you this, and I wil tel you but the truth, Heat of the womb is one of the greatest causes of hard labor in Childbirth) It makes barren women fruitful, it clenseth the Womb if it be foul and strengthens it exceedingly; it provokes the T erms if they be stopped, and stops them if they flow immoderately. You can desire no good to your Womb, but this Herb will effect it; therfore if you love Children, if you love Health, if you love Ease, keep a Syrup alwaies by you made of the juyce of this Herb and Sugar (or Honey if it be to clens the Womb) and let such as be rich keep it for their poor neighbors, and bestow it as freely as I bestow my studies upon them, or els let them look to answer it another day when the Lord shall come to make inquisi tion for Bloud. ARCHANGEL. To put a gloss upon their practice; the Physitians call an Herb (which Country people vulgarly know by the name of Dead - Nettles) Archangel, wherein whether they favor of more Superstition or Folly I leave to the judicious Reade r. There is more curiosity than courtesie to my Countrymen used by others in the explaination, aswel of the Names as Description of this so wel - known an Herb; which that I may not also be guilty of, Take this short Description first of the Red - Archangel.

Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 This hath divers square stalks somwhat hairy, at the joynts whereof grow two sad green Leaves dented about the edges, opposit to one another, the lowermost upon long footstalks, but without any toward the tops which are somwhat round, yet poi nted, and a little crumpled and hairy: Round about the upper Joynts where the Leaves grow thick, are sundry gaping Flowers of a pale reddish colour, after which com the Seeds three or four in a Husk. The Root is small and thriddy, perishing every year: the whol Plant hath a strong scent, but not stinking. White - Archangel hath diverse square stalks not standing streight upright but bending downward, wheron stand two Leavs at a Joynt, larger and more pointed than the other, dented about the edges and greener also more like unto Nettle - Leavs, but not stinking, yet hairy: At the Joynts with three Leavs stand larger and more open gaping white Flowers, in Husks round about the Stalks (but not with such a bush of Leavs, as Flowers set in the top, as in on the othe r) wherin stand smal roundish black Seeds: The Root is white, with many strings at it, not growing downward but lying under the upper crust of the Earth, and abideth many years encreasing: This hath not so strong a scent as the former. Yellow - Archangel is like the White in the Stalks and Leavs, but that the Stalks are more streight and upright, and the Joynts with Leaves are further asunder, having longer Leavs than the former; and the Flowers a little larger and more gaping, of a fair yellow colour in mos t, in som paler. The Roots are like the White, only they creep not so much under the ground. Place. They grow almost everywhere, (unless it be in the middle of the street) the Yellow most usually in the wet grounds of Woods, and somtimes in the dryer, in divers countries of this Nation. Time. They flower from the begining of the spring all the summer long. Vertues and Use. The Archangels are somwhat hot and dryer than the stinking Nettles, and used with better success for the stopping and hardness of the Spleen than they by using the Decoction of the Herb in Wine, and afterwards applying the Herb hot unto the Region of the Spleen as a Plaister, or the Decoction with Spunges. The Flowers of the White [EDGENOTE:] Spleen. Archangel are preserved, or con served to be used to stay the Whites and the Flowers of the Red to stay the Reds in Women.

This hath broad Leaves set at the great red Joynts of the Stalks, with semicircular blackish marks on them usually, yet somtimes without: The Flowers grow in long Spikes usually either blush or whitish with such li ke Seed following. The Root is long with many strings therat perishing yeerly; this hath no sharp tast (as another sort hath, which is quick and biting) but rather sowr like Sorrel, or els a little drying without tast. Place. It grows in watery Plashes, Ditches, and the like, which for the most part are dry in Summer. Time. It Flowreth in June, and the Seed is ripe in August. Vertues and Use. It is of a cooling and drying quality, and very effectual for putrified Ulcers in Man or Beast, to kill the wo rms and clens the putrified Places: The Juyce therof dropped in, or otherwise applied, consumeth all cold Swellings, and dissolveth the congealed Blood of bruises by strokes, falls, &c. A piece of the Root, or some of the Seed bruised and held to an aching Tooth, taketh away the pain. The Leaves bruised and laid to the [EDGENOTE:] Ulcers, Cold swellings, Bruises, Congeled Blood, Toothach, Felons, or Andicoms, Worms in the Ears, Fleas, Tired Horses, Impostums Inflamations, Wounds. Joynt that hath a Fellon theron, taketh it away. The Juyce destroyeth Worms in the Ears being dropped into them: if the hot Arsmart be strewed in a Chamber it will soon kill all the Fleas; and the Herb or Juyce of the cold Arsmart put to Horses or other Cattels sores will drive aw ay the Flie in the hottest time of Summer: A good handful of the hot biting Arsmart put under a Horses Saddle will make him travel the better although he were half tired before: The mild Arsmart is good against hot Imposthumes and Inflamations at the begin ning and to heal green Wounds.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

Their Ignorance, 2. Their Carelesness, and he that hath but half an eye may see their pride without a pair of Spectacles. I have done what I could to distinguish them in their Vertues, and when you find not the contrary named, use the cold. The truth is, I have not yet spoken with Dr. Reason, nor his Brother Dr. Experience, concerning either of them both. ASARABACCA. Asarabacca hath many Heads rising from the Roots, from whence come many smooth Leavs, e very one upon his own Footstalk, which are rounder and bigger than Violet Leaves, thicker also, and of a darker green shining colour on the upper side, and of a paler yellow green underneath, little or nothing dented about the edges; from among which rise smal round hollow, brown green husks, upon short stalks about an inch long, divided at the brims into five divisions, very like the Cups or Heads of the Henbane Seed, but that they are smaller; and these be all the Flowers it carrieth, which are somwhat sw eet, being smelled unto, and wherein when they are ripe is contained smal cornered, rough Seeds, very like the Kernels or Stones of Grapes or Raisons. The Roots are small and whitish spreading divers waies in the ground, and encreasing into divers Heads; b ut not running or creeping under ground as some other creeping Herbs do; They are somwhat sweet in smell, resembling Nardus, but more when they are dry, than green; and of a sharp but not unpleasant tast. [p. 8] Place. It groweth frequently in Gardens. Time. They keep their Leaves green all Winter, but shoot forth new in the Spring, and with them come forth those Heads or Flowers which give ripe Seed about Midsummer, or somwhat after. Vertues and Use. This Herb being drunk, not only provoketh vomitin g, but purgeth downward, and by Urin also, purging both Choller and Flegm: if you ad to it some Spicknard, with the Whey of Goats Milk or Honeyed Water, it is made more strong, but it purgeth Flegm more manifestly than Choller, and therfore doth much help pains in the Hips and other parts, it being boyled in Whey, it wonderfully helpeth the Obstruction of the Liver and Spleen, and therfore profitable for the Dropsie and Jaundice being steeped in Wine and drunk. It helps those continual Agues that come"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent.

It will not abide any long boyling, for it loseth its chiefest strength therby; nor much beating; for the finer Pouder doth provoke Vomit and Urin, and the courser purgeth downwards. The common Use herof is to take the Juyce of five or seven Leavs in a little Drink to caus Vomitings: The Roots have also the same Vertue, though they do not operate so forcibly, yet they are very effectual against the biting of Serpents, and t herfore is put as an ingredient both [EDGENOTE:] Serpents. Head. Memory. into Methridate and Venice Treacle. The Leaves and Roots being boyled in Ly, and the Head often washed therwith, while it is warm, comforteth the Head and Brain that is ill affected by taking cold, and helpeth the Memory. I shall desire Ignorant people to forbear the use of the Leavs, the Roots purge more gently, and may prove beneficial in such as have Cancers, or old putrified Ulcers, or Fistulaes upon their Bodies, to take a dram of them in Pouder in a quarter of a pint of white Wine in the morning. The truth is, I fancy Purging and Vomiting Medicines as little as any Man breathing doth, for they weaken Nature nor shall never advise them to be used unless upon urgent necessity. If a Physitian be Natures servant, it is his duty to strengthen his Mistris as much as he can, and weaken her as little as may be. ASPARAGUS, SPARAGUS, OR SPERAGE. Description. It riseth up at first with divers whitish green scaly Heads very brittle or ea sie to break while they are yong, which afterwards rise up into very long and slender green stalks, of the bigness of an ordinary riding wand at the bottom of most, or bigger or lesser, as the Roots are of growth; on which are set divers branches of green Leavs, shorter and smaller than Fennel to the top, at the joynts wherof come forth small mossie yellowish Flowers, which turn into round Berries, green at the first, and of an excellent red colour when they are ripe, shewing like Beads of Corral, wherin ar e contained exceeding hard, black Seeds. The Roots are dispersed from a spongeous Head into many long, thick, and round strings, wherby it sucketh much Nourishment out of the ground, and encreaseth plentifully thereby.

Time. They d o for the most part Flower, and bear their Berries late in the yeer, or not at all, although they are housed in Winter. Vertues and Use. The yong Bud or branches boyled in ones ordinary broth, maketh the Belly soluble and open, and boyled in white Wine, provoketh Urin being stopped, and is good against the Strangury, or difficulty of making water; it expelleth [EDGENOTE:] Belly, Strangury, Disury, Gout, Sciatica, Eyes, Tooth - ach. the gravel and stone out of the Kidneys, and helpeth pains in the Reins: A nd boyled in white Wine or Vinegar it is prevalent for them that have their Arteries loosned, or are troubled with the Hip - Gout, or Sciatica.

ASH - TREE. This is so wel known that time wil be mi sspent and Paper wasted in writing a Description of it; and therfore I shal only insist upon the Vertues of it. Vertues and Use. The yong tender Tops with the Leaves taken inwardly, and some of them outwardly applied are singular good against the biting of the Viper, Adder, or any other Venemous Beast: And the Water distilled therfrom, being taken a smal quantity every morning fasting, is a singular Medicine for those that are subject to a Dropsie, or to abate the greatness of those who are too gross or f at.

The Kernels within the Husks commonly called Ashen Keys, prevaileth against Stitches and pains in the sides proceeding of Wind, and avoideth away the stone by provoking Urin. I can justly except against none of all this save only the first, viz. That Ash - tree Tops and Leaves are good against the biting of Serpents and Vipers, and I suppose this had its rise from Gerard, or Pliny, both which hold that there is such an Antipathy between an Adder and an Ash - tree, that if an Adder be compassed round with Ash - tree Leaves, she wil sooner run through the fire than through the Leaves, the contrary to which is the truth, as both my eyes are wit nesses: the rest are Vertues somthing likely, only if it be in Winter when you cannot get the Leaves, you may safely use the Bark instead of them, the Keys you may easily keep all the year, gathering them when they are ripe. AVENS. Description. The ordi nary Avens hath many long, rough, dark green, winged Leavs rising from the Root, every one made of many Leavs set on each side of the middle Rib, the largest three wherof grow at the ends and are snip'd or dented round about the edges: the other being smal pieces, somtimes two and somtimes four standing on each side of the middle rib underneath them; among which do rise up divers rough or hairy Stalks about two foot high branching forth with Leavs at every Joynt, not so long as those below, but almost as mu ch cut in on the edges, some into three parts, some into more: On the Tops of the Branches stand smal pale yellow Flowers consisting of five Leavs, like the Flowers of Cynkfoyl, but larger in the middle, wherof standeth a smal green Head, which when the Fl ower is fallen groweth to be rough and round, being made of many long greenish purple Seeds (like grains) which wil stick upon your Cloathes. The Root consists of many brownish strings or fibres, smelling somwhat like unto Clover, especially those which gr ow in the higher, hotter, and drier grounds, and in the freer and clear Air. Place. They grow wild in many places under Hedg sides, and by the Pathwaies in Fields, yet they rather delight to grow in shadowy than in Sunny places. Time. They Flower in Ma y and June for the most part, and their seed is ripe in July at the furthest. Vertues and Use. It is good for the Diseases of the Chest or Breast, for pains and Stitches in the Sides, and to expel crude and raw humors from the Belly and Stomach by the sw eet savor and warming quality; it dissolveth the inward congealed Blood hapning by falls or bruises, and the spitting of Blood, if the Roots either green or dryed be boyled in Wine and drunk, as also al manner of inward Wounds or outward if they be washed or bathed therwith.

It is very good to help Digestion, and open Obstructions of the Brain; and hath so much purging quality in it (saith Avicen) as to expel those Melancholly vapors from the Spirits & Blood which are in the Heart and Arteries although it cannot do so in other parts of the Body. Diascorides saith, That the Leaves steeped in Wine, and the Wine drunk, and the Leavs externally applied is a remedy against the sting of Scorpions, and the bitings of mad Dogs, and commendeth the Decoction therof for Women to bath or sit in to procure their Courses; it is good to wash aching Teeth therwith and profitable for those that have the bloody Flux.

A Tansie or Cawdle made with Egs and t he Juyce therof while it is yong, putting to it some Sugar and Rosewater is good for Women in Childbed when the After - birth is not throughly avoided, and for their faintings upon, or after their sore travel. The Herb bruised and boyled in a little Wine and Oyl and laid warm on a Boil, will ripen and break it. It is an Herb of Jupiter and under Cancer, and strengthens Nature much in al its actions; let a Syrup made with the Juyce of it and Sugar, (as you shall be taught at the latter end of the Book) be kep t in every Gentlewomans house, to releeve the weak stomachs and sick Bodies of their poor sickly Neighbors; as also the Herb kept dry in the Hous that so with other convenient Simples you may make it into an Electuary with Hony according as the Diseas is, and as you shall be taught at the latter end of the Book. BARBERRY. The Shrub is so wel known to every Boy and Girl that hath but attained to the age of seven years, that it needs no Description. Vertues and Use. Mars owns the shrub, and present it to the use of my Country - men to purge their Bodies of Choller. The inner Rind of the Barberry Tree boyled in White - Wine and a quarter of a pint drunk each morning, is an excellent remedy to clense the Body of Chollick Humors, and free it [EDGENOTE:] Choller, Scabs, Itch Tetters, Ringworm, Yellow Jaundice, Boyls, Agues, Burning, Scaldings, Apetit lost, Hair. from such Diseases as Choller causeth, such be Scabs, Itch Tetters, Ringworms, yellow Jaundice, Boils, &c. It is excellent for hot Agues, Burnings, Scald ings, heat of Bloud, heat of the Liver, Bloudy - flux, for the Berries are as good as the Bark, and more pleasing; they get a man a good stomach to his victuals, by strengthning the attractive faculty, which is under Mars, as you see more at large in the lat ter end of my Ephemeris for the year 1651. The Hair washed with the Ly made of the Ashes of the Tree and Water, \"twil make it turn yellow, viz. of Mars his own colour. The Fruit and Rind of the Shrub, the Flowers of Broom and of Heath, or Furz, clens the B ody of Choller by Sympathy, as the Flowers, Leaves and Bark of the Peach - Tree do by Antipathy; because these are under Mars, that under Venus.

GARDEN BAZIL or SWEET BAZIL. Description. The greater ordinary Bazil riseth up usually with one upright Stalk diversly branching forth on all sides, with two Leaves at every Joynt, which are somewhat broad and roun d, yet pointed, of a pale green colour, but fresh, a little snipt about the edges, and of a strong heady scent: The Flowers are smal and white standing at the tops of the Branches, with two smal Leavs at the Joynt, in som places green, in others brown, aft er which come black Seed. The Root perisheth at the approach of Winter, and therfore must be new sowen every year. Place. It only groweth in Gardens. Time. It must be sowed late, and flowers in the heat of Summer, being a very tender Plant. Vertues an d Use. This is the Herb which all Authors are together by the Ears about, and rail at one another like Lawyers: Galen and Diascorides hold it not fitting to be taken inwardly: and Chrysippus rails at it with downright Billingsgate - Rhetorick. Pliny, and th e Arabian Physitians defend it.

Myzaldus affirms, That it being laid to rot in Horsdung it wil breed Venemous Beasts. And Hollerius a French Physitian affirms upon his own knowledg, That an acquaintance of his by common smelling to it, had a Scorpion bred in his Bra in. Somthing is the matter this Herb and Rue wil not grow together, no nor near one another: And we know Rue is as great an enemy to Poyson as any grows.

This is so wel known that it needs no Description; I shal therfore only write the Vertues therof, which are many. Vertues and Use. Galen saith, That the Leaves or Bark do dry and heal very much, and the Berries more than the Leaves: The Bark of the Root is less sharp and hot, but more bitter, and hath some astriction withal, whereby it is effectual to break the Stone, and good to open obstructions of the [EDGENOTE: ] Stone, Obstructions of the Liver and Spleen, Dropsie, Poyson, Jaundice, Bees, Wasps, Hornets, Terms provokes, Cause Delivery, Afterbirth, Eyes,Lungs.

The Berries are very effe ctual against al Poyson of venemous Creatures, and the Stings of Wasps and Bees, as also against the Pestilence or other infectious Diseases, and therfore is put into sundry Triacles for that purpose: They likewise procure Womens Courses; and seven of them given to a Woman in sore travel of Child - birth, do cause a speedy delivery, and expel the After - birth; and therfore not to be taken by such as have not gon out their time lest they procure Abortment, or cause Labor too soon: They wonderfully help al cold and rhumatick Distillations from the Brain to the Eyes, Lungs or other parts: And being made into an Electuary with Honey, do help the [p. 12] Consumption, old Coughs, shortness of Breath, and thin Rhewms: as also the Meagrim, they mightily expel wind an d provoke Urin; help the Mother, and kil the Worms: The Leaves also work the like effects.

FRENCH - BEANS. Description. The French or Kidney Bean ariseth up at first but with one stalk which afterwards divideth its self into many Arms or Branches, but also weak that if they be not sustained with sticks or poles, they wil lie fruitless upon the ground: at several places of these Branches grow forth long footstalks, with every one of them three broad round and pointed green Leavs at the end of them, towards the tops wherof come forth divers Flowers made like unto Pease Blossoms, of the same colour for the most part that the fruit wil be of, that is to say, white, yellow, red, blackish, or a deep purple; but white is most usual; after which come long a nd slender flat Pods, some crooked, some straight, with a string as it were running down the Back therof, wherein are contained flattish round fruit made to the fashion of a Kidney; the Root is long and spreadeth with many strings annexed to it, and perish eth every year.

Description. There are two sorts of Beets which are best known generally, and wherof I shal principally intreat at this time. Viz. The White and the Red Beets, and their vertues. The Common White Beet hath many great Leaves next the ground somwhat large, and of a whitish green colour: The Stalk is great, strong and ribbed, bearing great store of leaves upon it almost to the very top of it: The flowers grow in very long tufts, smal at the ends, and turning down their Heads, which are smal, pale, greenish, yellow Burrs, giving cornered prickled Seed. The Root is great, long and hard, and when it hath given Seed of no use at all. The Common Red Beet differeth not from the White, but only it is lesser and the Leaves and the Roots are somwhat red: The Leaves are differently red, in som only with red strakes or veins, som of a fresh red, and others of a dark red.

First of the Water - Betony, which riseth up with square hard greenish Stalks, and somtimes brow n, set with broad dark green Leavs dented about the edges with notches, somwhat resembling the Leavs of the Wood - Betony, but much larger, two for the most part set at a Joynt. The Flowers are many, set at the tops of the Stalks and Branches, being round be llied, and open at the Brims and divided into two parts, the uppermost being like a Hood, and the lowest like a Lip hanging down, of a dark red colour, which passing away, there comes in their places smal round Heads with smal points in the ends, wherin li e smal and brownish Seeds: The Root is a thick Bush of strings and threds growing from an Head.

The distilled water of the Leaves is used for the same purposes; as also to bath the Face or Hands spotted or blem ished, or discolored by Sunburning. I confess I do not much fancy distilled Waters, I mean such Waters as are distilled cold, some vertue of the Herb they may happliy have (it were a strange thing else) but this I am confident of, that being distilled in a Pewter Stil, as the vulgar and apish fashion is, both Chymical Oyl and Salt is left behind, unless you burn them, and then all is spoiled, Water and al, which was good for as little as can be by such a Distillation. You have the best way of Distillation in my Translation of the London Dispensatory. The Colledg of Physitians having as much skil in Distillations as an Ass hath reading Hebrew. Water - Betony is an Herb of Jupiter in Cancer and is apropriated more to Wounds and Hurts in the Breast than Wood - Be tony which follows. WOOD - BETONY. Description. The Common or Wood - Betony hath many Leavs rising from the root which are somwhat broad and round at the ends, roundly dented about the edges, standing upon long Footstalks, from among which rise up smal, squ are, slender, but yet upright hairy Stalks, with some Leaves thereon, two apiece at the Joynts, smaller than the lower, whereon are set several spiked Heads of Flowers like Lavender, but thicker and shorter for the most part, and of a reddish or purple col our, spotted with white spots both in the upper and lower part; The Seeds being contained within the Husks that hold the Flowers, are blackish, somwhat long and uneven. The Roots are many white threddy strings; the Stalk perisheth, but the Root with some L eavs theron, abides al the Winter. The whole Plant is somwhat smal. Place. It groweth frequently in Woods, and delighteth in Shady - places. Time. And it flowreth in July, after which, the Seed is quickly ripe, yet in its prime in May. Vertues and Use. Antonius Musa Physitian to the Emperor Augustus Caesar, wrote a peculiar Book of the Vertues of this Herb, and amongst other vertues, saith of it, That it preserveth the Lives and Bodies of Men free from the danger of Epidemical Diseases, and from Witchcr afts also: It is found by daily experience to be good for many Diseases; It helpeth those [EDGENOTE:] Epidemical Diseases, Witchcraft, Apetite, Indigestion, Stomach, Belching, Jaundice, Falling sickness, Palsey, Convulsion, Shrinking of the Sinews, Gout, Dropsie, Frensie, Cough, Cold, Shortness of Breath, Agues of all sorts, Sore Eyes, Worms, Obstructions of the Liver and Spleen, Stitches, Pains in the Back and Belly, Terms provokes, Mother, Childbirth, Stone, Toothach, Venemous Beasts, Mad - dogs,                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

The Decoction made with Mead and a little Pe nyroyal, is good for those that are troubled with putrid Agues, whether Quotidian, Tertian, or Quartan, and to draw down and evacuate the Blood and humors that by falling into the Eyes do hinder the Sight: The Decoction therof made in Wine and taken, kille th the Worms in the Belly, openeth Obstructions both of the Spleen and Liver, cureth Stitches and Pains in the Back, or Sides, the Torments and griping pains of the Bowels, and the wind Chollick: and mixed with Honey purgeth the Belly, helpeth to bring dow n Womens Courses, and is of especial use for those that are troubled with the falling down of the Mother, and pains therof, and causeth an easie and speedy delivery of Women in Childbirth: it helpeth also to break and expel the Stone either in the Bladder or Kidneys.

A dram of the Pouder in Betony taken with a little Honey in some Vinegar, doth wonderfully refresh those that are overwearied by travail; it staieth bleedings at the Mouth or Nose, and helpeth those that piss or spit Blood, and those that are Bursten or have a Rupture, and is good for such as are b ruised by any fall or otherwise. The green Herb bruised, or the Juyce applied to any inward hurt or outward green Wound in the Head or Body wil quickly heal and close it up; as also any Veins or Sinews that are cut; and will draw forth any broken Bone, or Splinter, Thorn or other thing gotten into the Flesh: It is no less profitable for old Sores, or filthy Ulcers, yea, though they be Fistulaus and hollow, but some do advise to put in a little Salt to this purpose: Being applied with a little Hogs Lard, it helpeth a Plague - Sore, and other Boyls and Pushes: The fumes of the Decoction while it is warm received by a Funnel into the Ears, easeth the pains of them, destroyeth the Worms, and cureth the running Sores in them.

The Flowers are usually Conserved. The Herb is apropriated to the Planet Jupiter, and the Sign Aries. THE BEECH TREE. In treating of this Tree, you must understand that I mean the great Mast Beech; which is by way of distinction from that other smal rough sort, called in Sussex, the smal l Beech; but in Essex, Hornbeam. I suppose it needless to describe it, being already so wel known to my Countrymen. Place. It groweth in Woods amongst Oaks, and other Trees, and in Parks, Forrests, and Chases, to feed Deer; and in other places to fatten Swine. Time. It bloometh in the end of April, or begining of May for the most part, and the Fruit is ripe in September. Vertues and Use. The Leavs of the Beech - Tree are cooling and binding, and therfore good to be applied to hot Swellings to discuss t hem: The Nuts do much nourish such Beasts as feed thereon: The Water that is found in the hollow places of decaying Beeches, will cure both Man and Beast of any Scurf, Scab, or running Tetters, if they be washed therwith. You may boyl the Leavs into a Pult is, or make an Ointment of them when time of year serves. BILBERRIES: Called also (by som) Whorts, and Whortleberries. Descriptions. Of these I shal only speak of two sorts, which are commonly known in England, Viz. The Black, and the Red Bilberries. An d first of the Black.

As for the former Diseases where it must be taken inwardly, it purgeth very Violently, and [p. 21] needs an abler hand to correct it than most Country people have, therfore it is a better way for them (in my opinion) to let the Simple alone, and take the Compound Water of it, mentioned in my Dispensatory, and that is far more safe, being wisely corrected.

BROOM, & BROOMRAPE. To spend time in writing a Descripton herof is altogether needless, it being so generally used by all the good Huswifes almost through this Land to sweep their Houses with and therfore very wel known to all sorts of people. The Broomrape springeth up in many places from the Roots of the Broom, (but more often in fields, by Hedg sides, and on Heaths). The Stalk wherof is of the bigness of a Finger or Thumb, above two Foot high having a show of Leavs on them and many Flowers at [p. 22] the top, of a deadish, yellow colour, as also the Stalks and Leavs are.

The Decoction therof in Wine is thought to be as effectual to avoid the Stone in the Kidnies and Bladder, and to provoke Urin, as the Broom it self: The Juyce therof is a singular good help to cure as wel green Wounds, as old and f ilthy Sores, and malignant Ulcers. The insolate Oyl wherin there hath been three or four Repetitions of Infusion of the top stalks with Flowers strained and cleered, clenseth the Skin of al manner of Spots, Marks and Freckles that arise either by the heat of the Sun, or the Malignity of humors. As for the Broom (for as yet I know not what to say to Broomrape in the business) but as from Broom, Mars owns it, and it is exceeding prejucidial to the Liver, I suppose by reason of the Antipathy between Jupiter a nd Mars, therfore if the Liver be disaffected, administer not of it. BUCK - HORN PLANTANE. Description. This being sown of Seed, riseth up at the first with smal, long, narrow hairy dark green Leavs like grass, without any division or gash in them; but th ose that follow are gashed in on both sides the Leavs into three or four gashes and pointed at the ends resembling the Knags of a Bucks Horn (wherof it took the name) and being well grown round about the Root upon the ground, in order one by another therby rsembling the form of a Star: from among which rise up divers hairy Stalks, about a hand breadth high, bearing every one a smal long spiky Head like to those of the common Plantane, having such like Bloomings and Seed after them. The Root is single, long, and smal, with divers strings at it. Place. They grow in dry Sandy grounds, as in Tuttle - Fields by Westminster, and divers other places of this Land. Time. They Flower and Seed in May, June, and July, and their green Leavs do in a manner abide fresh a l the Winter. Vertues and Use. This boyled in Wine and drunk, and some of the Leavs applied to the hurt place, is an excellent remedy for the biting of the Viper or Adder which I take to be one and the same: The same being also drunk helpeth those that a re troubled with the Stone in the Veins or Kidnies by cooling the heat of the parts afflicted strengthning them: as also weak Stomachs that cannot retain but cast up their Meat.

This hath larger Leavs than those of the Selfheal, but els of the same fashion, or rather a little longer, in some green on the upper side, and in others more brownish, dented about the edges, somwhat hairy, as the square Stalk is also, which riseth up to be half a yard high somtimes, with the Leavs set by couples; from the middle almost hereof upwards stand the Flowers together, with m any smaler and browner Leaves than the rest on this stalk below, set at distances, and the stalk bare between them, among which Flowers are also smal ones of a bluish, and somtimes of an Ash colour, fashioned like the Flowers of the Ground - Ivy, after which come small, round, blackish Seed. The Root is composed of many strings, and spreadeth upon the ground in divers parts round about. The White - flowered Bugle differeth not in form or greatness from the former, saving that the Leavs and Stalks are alwaies g reen and never brown like the other, and that the Flowers therof are very white. Place. They grow in Woods, wet Copses, and Fields generally throughout England; but the White flowered Bugle is not so plentiful as the other. Time. They flower from May u ntil July, and in the mean time perfect their Seed. The Roots and Leavs next therunto upon the ground abiding all Winter. Vertues and Use. The Decoction of the Leavs and Flowers made in Wine and taken dissolveth the congeled Blood in those that are bruis ed inwardly by a fall or otherwise, and is very effectual for any inward wounds, Thrusts or Stabs in the Body or Bowels, and is an especial help in all Wound - drinks, and for those that are Liver - grown (as they cal it.) It is wonderful in curing all manner of Ulcers and Sores whether new and fresh, or old and inveterate, yea Gangrenes and Fistulaes also, if the Leavs bruised be aplied, or their Juyce used to wash and bath the places.

Th is Herb is belonging to Dame Venus, and if the Vertues of it make you in love with it, (as they wil if you be wise) keep a Syrup of it to take inwardly, and an Ointment and Plaister of it to use outwardly alwaies by you. The truth is I have known this Her b cure some Diseases of Saturn, of which I thought good to quote one. Many times such as give themselvs much to drinking are troubled with strange Fancies, strange sights in the night - time, and some with Voices, as also with the Diseas Ephialtes or the Mar e. I take the reason of this to be (according to [EDGENOTE:] Mares, Strange Sights in the night. Fernelius) a Melancholly vapor made thin by excessive drinking strong Liquor, and so flys up and disturbs the Fancy, and breeds imaginations like it self, vi z. fearful and troublesom: These I have known cured by taking only two spoonfuls of the Syrup of this Herb, after Supper two hours when you go to bed. But whether this do it by Sympathy or Antipathy is som question; all that know any thing in Astrologie, k now that there is a great Antipathy between Saturn and Venus in matter of Procreation, yea such an one, that the barreness of Saturn can be removed by none but Venus, nor the lust of Venus be repelled by none but Saturn: but I am not yet of opinion this is done this way; and my reason is because these vapors though in quality Melancholly, yet by their flying upward seem to be somthing Aeriel, therfore I rather think it is done by Sympathy, Saturn being exalted in Libra the house of Venus. Selfheal, which f ollows, is of the same nature, and I am of opinion the same Herb, only differs a little in form according to the difference of place they grow in; this I am sure they work the same effect. BURNET. The common Garden Burnet is so well known that it needeth no description. There is another sort which is wild, the description wherof take as followeth. Description.

The Root is black and long like the other, but greater also: It hath almost neither scent nor tast therin like the Garden kind. Place. The first grows frequently in Gardens. The Wild kind groweth in divers Countries of this Land, especially in Huntington & Northampton shires in the Meadows there; as also near London by Pancras - Church, and by a Causey side in the middle of a Field by Paddington. Time. They flower about the e nd of June and beginning of July, and their Seed is ripe in August. Vertues. They are accounted to be both of one property, but the lesser is more effectual, because quicker and more Aromatical: It is a friend to the Heart, Liver, and other the principal parts of a mans Body. Two or three of the Stalks with Leavs put into a Cup of Wine, especially Clarret, are known to quicken the Spirits, refresh and cheer the Heart and drive away Melancholly. It is a special help to defend the Heart from noisom vapors, and from Infection of the Pestilence, the Juyce therof being taken in som Drink, and the party laid to sweat thereupon.

The Seed is also no less effectual both to stop Fluxes and dry up moist Sores, being t aken in Pouder inwardly, in Wine or steeled Water, that is, wherin hot Gads of Steel have been quenched. Or the Pouder of the Seed mixed with the Ointments. This is an Herb the Sun challengeth dominion over, and is a most precious Herb, little inferior to Betony: The continual use of it preservs the Body in health, and the Spirits in vigor; for if the Sun be the preserver of life under God, his Herbs are the best in the World to do it by.

The Oyl made of the Flowers of Chamomel is much used against al hard swellings, pains or aches, shrinking of the Sinews or Cramps, or pains in the Joynts, or any other part of the Body; being used in Clisters, it helpeth to dissolve wind and pains in the Belly; anointed also it helpeth Stitches and pains in the Sides. Nichessor saith the Egyptians dedicated it to the Sun becaus it cured Agues;and they were like enough to do it, for they were the arrantest Apes in their Religion that ever I read of. Baccinus, Pena, and Lobel commend the Syrup made of the Juyce of it an d Sugar, taken inwardly, to be excellent for the Spleen. Also this is certain, that it most wonderfully breaks the Stone, some take it in Syrup or Decoction, others inject the Juyce of it into the Bladder with a Syring; my Opinion is, That the Salt of it t aken half a dram in a morning, in a little White or Rhenish Wine is better than either, that it is excellent for the Stone appears by this, which I have seen tried, viz.

The white wild Campion hath many long and somwhat broad dark green Leavs, lying upon the ground with divers Ribs therin somwhat like Plantane, but somwhat hairy, broader, and no t so long: The hairy Stalks rise up in the middle of them three of four foot high, and somtimes more, with divers great white Joynts at several places theron, and two such like Leavs therat up to the top, sending forth Branches at the several Joynts also a l which bear on several Footstalks white Flowers at the tops of them, consisting of five broad pointed Leavs, every one cut in on the end unto the middle, making them seem to be two apiece, smelling somwhat sweet, and each of them standing in large green s triped hairy Husks, large and round below next to the Stalk: The Seed is smal and grayish in the hard Heads that come up afterwards: The Root is white and long, spreading divers fangs in the ground. The Red Wild Campion groweth in the same manner as the W hite, but his Leavs are not so plainly ribbed, somewhat shorter, rounder and more woolly in handling: The Flowers are of the same form and bigness, but in som of a pale, in others of a bright red colour, cut in at ends more finely, which maketh the Leavs s eem more in number than the other. The Seed and the Roots are alike: The Roots of both sorts abiding many years. There are forty five kinds of Campions more, those of them which are of Physical uses having the like Vertues with these above described, whic h I take to be the two chiefest kinds.

CARROTS. The Garden kind are so wel known that they need no Description; but because they are of less Physical use than the Wild kind (as indeed almost in all Herbs the Wild are most effectual in Physick, as being more powerful in operation then the Garden kinds) I shal therfore briefly describe the Wild Carrot. Description. It groweth in a manner altogether like the Tame, but that the Leavs and Stalks are somwhat whiter and rougher: The Stalks bear large tufts of white Flowers, with deep Purple spot in the middle, which are contracted together when the Seed begins to ripen, that the middle part being hollow and low, and the outer Stalks rising high, maketh the whol Umbel to shew like a Birds - Nest. The Root is smal, long, and hard, unfit for meat , being somwhat sharp and strong. Place. The Wild kind groweth in divers parts of this Land plentifully by the Fields sides, and in untilled places. Time. They flower and seed in the end of Summer. The Vertues. The Wild kind, breaketh Wind, and remov eth Stitches in the Sides, provoketh Urin and Womens Courses, and helpeth to break and expel the Stone: The Seed also of the same worketh the like effect, and is good for the Dropsie, and those whose Bellies are swollen with Wind; helpeth the [EDGENOTE:] Wind, Stitches, provokes Urin and the Terms, Stone, Dropsie, Chollick, Barrenness, Ulcers."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

The Leavs being applied with Honey to running Sores or Ulcers, doth clense them. I suppose the Seeds of them perform this better than the Roots; And though Galen commend Garden Carrots highly, to break Wind; yet experience teacheth that they breed it first; and we may thank Natu re for expelling it, not they: The Seeds of them expel Wind indeed, and so mend what the Root marreth. CARAWAY. Description. It beareth divers Stalks of fine cut Leavs lying upon the ground somwhat like to the Leavs of Carrots, but not bushing so thick, of a little quick tast in them, from among which riseth up a square Stalk not so high as the Carrot, at whose Joynts are set the like Leavs but smaler and finer, and at the top smal open tufts or umbels of white Flowers, which turn into smal blackish Seed smaler than the Anniseed, and of a quicker and hotter tast. The Root is whitish, smal and long, somwhat like unto a Parsnep, but with more wrinckled Bark, and much less, of a little hot and quick tast, and stronger than the Parsnep, and abideth after Seed - time. Place. It is usually sown with us in Gardens. Time. They flower in June or July, and seed quickly after. Vertues and Use. Caraway Seed hath a moderat sharp quality wherby it breaketh Wind and provoketh Urin, which also the Herb doth. The Root is better food than the Parsnep, and is pleasant & comfortable to the Stomach, helping digestion. The Seed is conducing to all the cold griefs of Head and Stomach, the Bowels or Mother, as also the wind in them, and helpeth to sharpen the Eye - sight. The Po uder of the Seed put into a Pultis, taketh away black and blue spots of Blows or Bruises.

This hath divers tender, round, whitish, green Stalks, with greater Joynts than ordinary in other Herbs, as it were Knees, very brittle and easie to break, from whence grow Branches with large tender long Leavs, much di vided into many parts, each of them cut in on the edges, set at the Joynts on both sides of the branches, of a dark bluish green colour on the upper side like Columbines, and of a more pale bluish green underneath, ful of a yellow sap, when any part is bro ken, of a bitter tast and strong scent. At the tops of the Branches which are much divided, grow gold yellow Flowers of four Leaves apiece, after which come smal long pods, with blackish seed therin. The Root is somwhat great at the head, shooting forth di vers other long Roots and smal Strings, reddish on the outside and yellow within, ful of a yellow sap therein. Place. It groweth in many places by old Walls, by the Hedges, and way sides in untilled places; and being once planted in a Garden, especially in some shady place, it wil remain there. Time. They flower all the Summer long, and the Seed ripeneth in the mean time. Vertues and Use. The Herb or Roots boyled in white - Wine and drunk, a few Aniseeds being boyled therwith, openeth Obstructions of th e Liver and Gall, helpeth the yellow Jaundice: and the often using it, helps the Dropsie, and the Itch, and those that have old Sores in their Legs, or other parts of the Body. The Juyce thereof taken fasting, is held to be of singular good use against the Pestilence: The distilled Water, with a little sugar, and a little good Triacle mixed therwith (the party upon the taking being laid down to sweat a little) hath the same effect. The Juyce dropped into the Eyes clenseth them from Films and the Cloudiness which darken the sight, but it is best to allay the sharpnes of the Juyce with a little Breast - milk: It is good in old filthy corroding creeping Ulcers whersoever, to stay their malignity of fretting and running, and to cause them to heal the more speedily : The Juyce often applied to Tetters, Ringworms, or other such like spreading Cancers, will quickly heal them, and rubbed often upon Warts will taken them away. The Herb with the Roots bruised and heated with Oyl of Camomel, applied to the Navel, taketh aw ay the griping pain in the Belly and Bowels, and all the pains of the Mother: and applied to Womens Breasts stayeth the overmuch flowing of their Courses.

This is an Herb of the Sun, & under the Coelestial Lyon, and is one of the best cures for the Eyes that is. Al that know any thing in Astrologie, know as wel as I can tel them, That the Eyes are sub ject to the Luminaries; let it then be gathered when the Sun is in Leo, and the Moon in Aries applying to his Trine; let Leo arise, then may you make it into an Oyl or Oyntment which you please to anoint your sore Eyes withal: I can prove it both by my own experience, and the experience of those to whom I have taught it, That most desperat sore Eyes have been cured by this only Medicine; And then I pray, is not this farbetter than endangering the Eyes by the art of the Needle? for if this do not absolutly t ake away the Film, it wil so facilitate the work that it may be don wihout danger. Another il - favored trick have Physitians got to use to the Eye, and that is worse than the Needle; which is, To eat away the Film by corroding or gnawing Medicines. This I absolutly protest against. 1. Because the Tunicles of the Eye are very thin, and therfore soon eaten asunder. 2. The Callus or Film that they would eat away is seldom of an equal thickness in every place, and then the Tunicle may be eaten asunder in one place, before the Film be consumed in another, and so be a readier way to extinguish the sight than to restore it. It is called Chelidonium from the Greek word [Greek script] which sigifies a Swallow, because they say, That if you prick out the Eyes of yo ng Swallows when they are in the Nest, the old ones wil recover their Eyes again with this Herb. This I am confident, for I have tried it, That if you mar the very Apple of their Eyes with a Needle, she wil recover them again, but whether with this Herb or no I know not. Also I have read (and it seems to be somwhat probable) That the Herb being gathered as I shewed before, and the Elements drawn apart from it by the art of the Alchymist, and after they are drawn apart, rectified, the earthy quality still i n rectifying them, added to the Terra damnata (as Alchymists call it) or Terra sacratissima (as som Phylosophers call it) [p. 30] the Elements so rectified are sufficient for the Cure of al Diseases, the humor offending being known and the contrary Eleme nt given, It is an Experience wurth the trying, and can do no harm.

The root is made of many smal Kernels like grain of Corn, some twice a s long as others, of a whitish colour with some Fibres at the end of them. Place. It groweth for the most part in the moist corners of Fields, and places that are neer water Sides, yet wil abide in dryer grounds, if they be but a little shadowed. Time. It Flowereth betimes about March or April, is quite gone in May, so as it cannot be found until it spring again. Vertues and Use. It is certain by good experience that the Decoction of the Leavs and Roots, doth wonderfully help the Piles and Hemorrhoids as also Kernels by the Ears and Throat called the Kings evil; or any other hard Wens or Tumors. Here's another Secret for my Country Men and Women, a couple of them together, Pilewort being made into an Oyl Oyntment or Plaister readily cures both the Pil es or Hemorrhoids, and the Kings Evil, If I may Lawfully cal it [EDGENOTE:] Hemorrhoids, Kings Evil. the Kings Evil now there is no King, the very Herb born about ones Body next the Skin, helps in such Diseases, though it never touch the place grieved, l et good people make much of it for these uses, with this I cured my own Daughter of the Kings Evil, broke the Sore, drew out a quarter of a pint of Corruption, and cured it without any Scar at all, and in one Weeks time.

THE CHERRY - TREE. I suppose there are few but know this Tree, for his Fruits sake, and therfore shal spare the writing a Description therof. Place. For the place of its growth, it is afforded room in every Orchard . Vertues and Use. Cherries, as th ey are of different tasts, so they are of divers qualities: The sweet pass through the Stomach and Belly more speedily, but are of little Nourishment. [EDGENOTE:] Appetite lost, Flegm, Gross Humors, Cool, provoke Urine, Cough, Hoarsness, Sight, Gravel, Wi nd. The tart or sowr, are more pleasing to an hot Stomach, procuring appetite to meat, and help to cut tough Flegm and gross humors; but when these are dryed they are more binding the belly than when they are fresh, being cooling in hot Diseases, and welc om to the Stomach, and provoke Urin. The Gum of the Cherry - Tree dissolved in Wine, is good for a cold Cough, and hoarsness of the Throat, mendeth the colour in the Face, sharpneth the Eye - sight, provoketh appetite, and helpeth to break and expel the Stone. The Black Cherries bruised with the Stones and distilled, the Water therof is much used, to break the Stone, expel gravel, and break the Wind. WINTER CHERRIES. Description. The Winter Cherry hath a running or creeping Root in the ground of the bigness many times of ones little Finger, shooting forth at several Joynts ins everal places, wherby it quickly spreadeth a great compass of ground: The Stalk riseth not above a yard high, wheron are set many broad, and long green Leavs, somwhat like Nightshade bu t larger, at the Joynts wherof come forth whitish Flowers made of five Leavs apiece; which after turn into green Berries, inclosed with thin Skins, which change to be reddish, when they grow ripe, the Berry likewise being reddish, and as large as a Cherry, wherein are contained many flat and yellowish Seeds lying within the pulp; which being gathered and strung up are kept all the yeer to be used upon occasion. Place. They grow not naturally in this Land, but are cherished in Gardens for their Vertues. T ime. They Flower not until the middle or latter end of July, and the Fruit is ripe about the end of August, or beginning of September. Vertues and Use."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 They are of great use in Physick: The Leavs being cooling may be used in Inflamations, but not openin g, as the Berries and Fruit are, which by drawing down the Urine [EDGENOTE:] Inflamations, Disury, Stone, Gravel, Ulcers in the Reins and Bladder, pissing Blood, Sharpness of Urins. provoke it to be avoided plentifully when it is stopped or grown hot, sh arp, and painful in the passage; it is good also to expel the Stone and Gravel out of the Reins, Kidnies, and Bladder, helping to dissolve the Stone, and avoiding it by greet or gravel sent forth in the Urin; It also helpeth much to clens inward Impostumes or Ulcers in the Reins or Bladder, or in those that avoid a Bloody or foul Urin. The distilled Water of the Fruit, or the Leavs together with them, or the Berries green or dry, distilled with a little Milk, and drunk morning and evening with a little Suga r, is effectual to al the purposes afore specified, and especially against the heat and sharpness of the Urin. I shal only mention one way amongst many others which might be used for ordering the Berries to be helpful for the Urin and the Stone, which is t hus. Take [EDGENOTE:] A precious Receipt. three or four good handfuls of the Berries either green and fresh, or dried and having bruised them, put them into so many Gallons of Beer or Ale when it is new tunned up: This Drink taken daily hath been found t o do much good to many, both to eas the pains and expel Urin, and the Stone; and to caus the Stone not to ingender. The Decoction of the Berries in Wine or Water is the most usual way; but the Pouder of them taken in drink is more effectual. CHERVIL. Des cription. The Garden Chervil doth at first somwhat resemble Parsly, but after it is better grown the Leavs are much cut in and jagged [p. 32] resembling Hemlocks, being a little hairy and of a whitish green colour, somtimes turning reddish in the Summer with the Stalks also; It riseth little above half a Foot high, bearing white Flowers in spoked tufts, which turn into long and round Seed pointed at the ends, and blackish when they are ripe; of a sweet tast, but no smel, though the Herb it self smelleth reasonable wel: The Root is smal and long and perisheth every yeer, and must be sowen anew in the Spring for Seed, and after July for Autumn Sallet. The wild Chervil growth two or three foot high, with yellow Stalks and Joynts, set with broader and more h airy Leavs, divided into sundry parts nicked about the edges, and of a darker green colour, which likewise grow reddish with the Stalks; at the tops wherof                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

They flower and seed early, and thereupon are sown again in the end of Summer. Vertues and Use. The Garden Chervil being eaten, doth moderately warm the Stomach, and is a certain remedy (Saith Tragus) to dissolve congealed or clotted Bloud in the Body, or that which is clotted by bruises, fals, &c. The Juyce or distilled Water therof being drunk, and the bruised Leavs [EDGENOTE:] Stomach Clotted Blood, Bruises, Falls, Disury, Stone, Pleuresie, Sides, Swellings, black and blue Spots. laid to the place, being taken either in meat or drink, it is hel d good to provoke Urin, to expel the Stone in the Kidnies, to send down Womens Courses, and to help the Plurisie and prickings of the Sides.

CHICKWEED. Description. This is generally known to most People, I shal therfore not trouble you with the Description therof; nor my self with setting fourth the several kinds; sith but only two or three are considerable for their usefulness.

CICH - PEAS, or CICERS. Description. The Garden sorts, whether Red, Black, or White, brings forth Stalks a yard long, wheron do grow many smal and almost round Leavs, dented about the edges, set on both sides of a middle Rib: at the Joynts come forth one or two Flowers upon short Footstalks, Peas fashion, either white or whitish, or pur plish red, lighter o r deeper according as the Peas that follow will be, that are contained in smal, thick, and short Pods, wherin lie one or two Peas more usually, a little pointed at the lower end, and almost round at the Head, yet a little corner'd or sharp.

Vertues and Use. They are no less windy than Beans, but nourish more, th ey provoke Urine, and are thought to encreas Sperm, they have a clensing faculty, wherby they break the Stones in the Kidneys. To drink the cream of them being boyled in Water is the best way; it moveth the Belly downwards, [EDGENOTE:] Disury, Seed encrea s, Stone, Costivness, Terms provokes, Pain in the sides, Obstruction, Stone, Open, Digest, Dissolve. provoketh Womens Courses, and Urin, and encreaseth both Milk and Seed. One ounce of Cicers, two ounces of French Barley, and a smal handful of Marsh - Mallo w Roots, clean washed and cut, being boyled in the broth of a Chicken, and four ounces taken in the morning and fasting two hours after is a good Medicine for a pain in the Side. The white Cicers are used more for Meat than Medicine, yet have they the same effect, and are thought more powerful to encrease Milk and Seed. The wild Cicers are so much more powerful than the Garden kinds, by how much they exceed them in heat and driness; whereby they do more open Obstructions, break the Stone, and have al the p roperties of cutting, opening, digesting, and dissolving, and this more speedily, and certainly than the former.

Vertues and Use. It is an especial Herb used in all Inflamations and Feavers whether Infectious or Pestilential; or among other Herbs to cool, and temper the Blood and humors in the Body; As also for all Lotions, Gargles, Inje ctions, and [EDGENOTE:] Inflamation, Feavers, Pestilence, Sore Mouths, Ulcers, Cankers, Fistulaes, Quincy, Yellow Jaundice, Falling sickness, Flux, Terms, Stops. the like for sore Mouths, Ulcers, Cankers, Fistulaes, and other corrupt Foul, or running sor es.

This is an Herb of Jupiter, and therfore strengthens the parts of the Body that he rules, let Jupiter be angular and strong when it is gathered, and if you give but a scruple (which is but twenty grains of it) at a time, either in white Wine, or white Wine Vinegar, you shal very seldom miss the cure of an Ague be it what Ague soever in three Fits, as I have often proved to the admiration both of my self and others, let no Man despise it becaus it is plain and easie, the waies of God are all such, 'tis the ungodliness and impudencey of Man that made things hard, and hath (by so doing) made sport for al the Devils in Hell, and grieved the good Angels, and when you reade this your own Genius if you be any thing at al acquainted with it, may dictate to you many as good Conclusions both of this and other Herbs. Some hold that one Leaf cures a Quotidian, three a Tertian, and fo ur a Quartan Ague, and a hundred to one if it be not Dioscorides, for he is ful of such Whimseys. The truth is I never stood so much upon the number of the Leavs, nor whether I gave it in Pouder or Decoction: If Jupiter were strong and the Moon applying to him or his good aspect at the gathering of it, I never knew it miss the desired effects. CLARY. Description. Our ordinary Garden Clary hath four square Stalks, with broad, rough, wrinkled, whitish, or hairy green Leavs, somwhat evenly cut in on the edg es, and of a strong, sweet sent, growing some neer the ground, and some by couples upon the Stalks: The Flowers grow at certain distances with two smal Leavs at the Joynts under them, somwhat like unto the Flowers of Sage, but smaller, and of a whitish blu e colour: The Seed is brownish, and somwhat Flat, or not so round as the wild, the Roots are blackish and spread not far, and perish after the Seed time: It is usually sown, for it seldom riseth of its own sowing. Place. This groweth in Gardens. Time. It Flowereth in June and July, some a little later than others, and their Seed is ripe in August, or therabouts. Vertues and Use. The Seed is used to be put into the Eyes to cleer them from Moats, or other such like things gotten within the Lids to offen d them, as also to clear them from white or red spots in them. The Muccilage of the Seed made with Water, and applied to Tumors and swellings, disperseth and taketh them away, as also draweth forth Splinters, Thorns, or"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 other things gotten into the Flesh. The Leavs used with Vinegar either by it self or with a little Honey, [EDGENOTE:] Eyes, Swellings, Splinters, Thorns, Inflamations, Boyls, Felons, Head, Brain, Lust provokes, Back, Terms provokes, Afterbirth. doth help hot Inflamations, as also Boyls, Fe lons, and the hot Inflamations that are gathered by their pains, if it be applied before they be grown too great. The Pouder of the dried Leavs put into the Nose provoketh neesing, and therby purgeth the Head and Brain of much Rhewm and Corruption. The See d or Leavs taken in Wine provoketh to Venery. It is of much use both for Men and Women that have weak Backs, to help to strengthen the Reins, used either by it self or with other Herbs conducing to the same effect, and in Tansies often: The fresh Leavs dip ped in a Batter of Flower, Egs, and a little Milk, and fried in Butter, and served to the Table, is not unpleasant to any, but exceeding profitable for those that are troubled with weak Backs, and the effects therof. The Juyce of the Herb put into Ale or B eer, and drunk, bringeth down Womens Courses, and expelleth the After - birth. [p. 35] It is an usual cours with Men when they have gotten the running of the Reins, or Women the Whites, then run to the bush of Clary; Maid bring hither the Frying Pan, fetch me some Butter quickly, then to eating fryed Clary, just as Hogs eat Acorns, and thus they think wil cure their Disease (forsooth) wheras when they have devoured as much Clary as wil grow upon an Acre of ground, their Backs are as much the better as thoug h they had pissed in their shoos, nay perhaps much wors. As for the trick of curing the Eyes by it I can as yet say nothing to it, for the rest it may be effectual. We will grant that Clary strengthens the Back, but this we deny, That the caus of the run ning of the Reins in Men, or the Whites in Women lies in the Back (though the Back may somtimes be weakned by them) and therfore the Medicine is as proper, as for me when my Toe is sore, to lay a Plaister to my Nose. CLEAVERS, or GOOSGRASS. Description. The common Cleavers hath divers very rough square Stalks, not so big as the Tag of a Point, but rising up to be two or three yards high somtimes, if it meet with any tall Bushes or Trees wheron it may climb (yet without any Claspers) or els much lower and lying upon the Ground full of Joynts, and at every of them shooteth forth a Branch, besides the Leavs therat, which are usually six, set in a round compass like a Star, or the Rowel of a Spur: from between the Leavs at the Joynts towards the tops of the B ranches, come forth very smal white Flowers, every one upon a smal threddy Footstalk, which after they are                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

The Juyce of the Herb, and Seed together taken in Wine, helpeth those that are bitten with an Adder, by preserving the Heart from the Venom; It is familiar ly taken in Broth to keep them lean and lank that are apt to grow fat. The distilled Water drunk twice a day helpeth the yellow Jaundice, and the Decoction of the Herb in experience found to do the same, and stayeth Lasks and Bloody Fluxes.

The Juyce is also very go od to close up the Lips of green Wounds; and the Pouder of the dried Herb strewed therupon doth the same, and likewise helpeth old Ulcers: Being boyled with Hogs Greas, it healeth al sorts of hard Swellings or Kernels in the Throat, being anointed therwith . The Juyce dropped into the Ears taketh away the pains of them. It is a good remedy in the Spring eaten (being first chopped smal and boyled well) in Water - gruel, to clens the Blood, and strengthen the Liver, thereby keeping the Body in health, and fitti ng it for that change of Season that is coming.

The Root is small and threddy. There are other sorts hereof, which are somwhat lesser than the former, not much different, save only that as the Stalk and L eavs are shorter, so the Flowers are paler, and more open. Place. They grow in dry, barren, sandy, and gravelly Grounds, in most places of this Land. Time. They Flower about July, some earlier, some later, and their Seed is ripe in August. Vertues and Use.

CROWFOOT. Abundance are the sorts of this Herb, that to describe them all would tire the Patience even of Socrates himself, but because I have not yet attained to the Spirit of Socrates, I shal l but describe the most usual. Description. The most common Crowfoot hath many dark green Leavs cut into divers parts, in tast biting & sharp, biting & blistering the Tongue, it bears many Flowers and those of a bright resplendent yellow colour, I do not remember that ever I saw any thing yellower, Virgins in Ancient time used to make Pouder of them to strew Bride Beds, after which Flowers come smal heads of Seeds, round, but tugged like a Pine Apple. Place. They grow very common every where, unless you run your Head into a Hedg you cannot chuse but see some of them wherever you walk. Time. They Flower in May and June, even till September. Names. Many are the Names this furious biting Herb hath obtained, almost enough to make up a Welch - mans Pedegree , if he fetch it no further than John of Gaunt of William the Conqueror, for it is called Frogs - foot from the Greek name [Greek transliteration for 'bad potion'], Crowfoot, Gold Knobs, Gold Cups, King Kob, Bassinets, Troll Flower, Polts, Locker Goulons, an d Butter - Flowers. Vertues and Use. This fiery and hot spirited Herb of Mars is no way fit to be given inwardly, but an Oyntment of the Leavs or Flowers wil draw a Blister and may so be fitting applied to the nape of the Neck to draw back Rhewm from the E yes, the Herb being bruised and mixed with a little Mustard, draws a Blister as well and as perfectly as Cantharides, and with far less danger to the Vessels of Urin which Cantharides Naturally delight to wrong, I knew                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

CUCKOWPINT, or WAKE - ROBIN. This shooteth forth three, four, or five Leavs at the most from one Root, every o ne wherof is somwhat large and long, broad at the bottom next the Stalk, and forked, but ending in a point without cut on the edges, of a ful green colour each standing upon a thick round Stalk, of a hands breadth long or more: among which after two or thr ee Months that they begin to wither, riseth up a bare round whitish green Stalk, spotted and straked with purple, somwhat higher than the Leavs: at the top wherof standeth a long hollow Hose or Husk close at the bottom, but open from the middle upwards end ing in a point; in the middle whereof standeth a smal long Pestle or Clapper, smaller at the bottom than at the top, of a dark purple colour as the Husk is on the inside, though green without; which after it hath so abidden for some time, the Husk with the Clapper decayeth, and the foot or bottom therof groweth to be a smal long Bunch of Berries, green at the first, and of a yellowish red colour when they are ripe, of the bigness of an Hazel nut Kernel; which abide theron almost until Winter; The Root is ro und [p. 41] and somwhat long, for the most part lying along, the Leavs shooting forth at the bigger end, which when it beareth his Berries, is somwhat wrinkled and loos, another being growing under it, which is solid and firm with many smal threads hangi ng therat: The whol Plant is of a very sharp biting tast, pricking the Tongue as Nettles do the Hands, and so abideth for a great while without alteration: The Root hereof was anciently used instead of Starch to starch Linnen withal. There is another sort of Cockowpint with lesser Leavs than the former, and somwhat; harder, having blackish spots upon them which for the most part abide longer green in Summer than the former; and both Leavs and Roots are more sharp and fierce than it: In al things els it is like the former. Place. These two sorts grow frequently almost under every Hedg side in many places of this Land. Time. They shoot forth Leavs in the Spring and continue but until the middle of Summer, or somwhat later, their Husks appearing before the y fall away; and their Fruit shewing in August. Vertues and Use. Tragus reporteth that a dram weight, or more if need be of the spotted Wake - Robin, either fresh and green, or dried, being beaten and taken is a most present and pure Remedy for Poyson and the Plague.

DODDER OF TIME, or EPITHIMUM, and other DODDERS. Description. This first from seeds giveth Roots in the ground, which shooteth forth threads or Strings, grosser or finer, as the propert y of the Plant wherein it groweth, and the climate doth suffer, creeping and spreading on that Plant wheron it fastneth, be it high or low. These Strings have no Leavs at all upon them but wind and interlace themselves so thick upon a smal Plant that it ta keth away all comfort of the Sun from it, and is ready to choke or strangle it: After these Strings are risen up to that Height that they may draw Nourishment from the Plant, they seem to be broken off from the ground, either by the strength of ther rising , or withered by the heat of the Sun. Upon these Strings are found clusters of small Heads or Husks, out of which start forth whitish Flowers, which afterwads give smal pale colour'd Seed somwhat flat, and twice as big as Poppy Seed. It generally participa tes of the Nature of that Plant which it climbeth upon, but the Dodder of Time is accounted the best, and is the only true Epithimum. Vertues and Use. This is accounted the most effectual for Melanchollick Diseases, and to purge black or burnt Choller, w hich is the caus of many Diseases of the Head and Brains, as also for the trembling of the Heart, faintings, and swounings. It is helpful in all Diseases and Griefs of the Spleen, and of that Melancholly that ariseth from the windiness of the Hypochondria. It purgeth also the Reins or Kidneys by Urin. It openeth Obstructions of the Gall, wherby it profiteth them that have the Jaundice; as also of the Liver, and Spleen; purging the Veins of Chollerick and Flegmatick Humors, and helpeth Childrens Agues, a lit tle Wormfeed being put therto."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

Sympathy and Antipathy, are the two Hinges upon which the whol Moddel of Physick turns, and that Physitian which minds them not is like a Door o ff from the Hooks, more likely to do a man a mischief than to secure him: then all the Diseases Saturn causeth, this helps by Sympathy, & strengthens al the parts of the Body he rules, such as caused by Sol it helps by Antipathy, what those Diseases are se e my Judgment of Diseases by Astrology, and you be pleased to look the Herb Wormwood, you shal find a Rational way for it.

I shall therfore in this place only describe the Dwarf Elder, called also Danewort, and Walewort. THE DWARF ELDER. Descri ption. This is but an Herb every yeer dying with his Stalks to the ground, and rising again afresh every Spring; and is like unto the Elders both in form and quality, rising up with a four square rough hairy Stalk four foot high or more somtimes. The wing ed Leavs are somwhat narrower than the Elder, but els very like them. The Flowers are white with a dash of Purple standing in Umbels, very like the Elder also but more sweet in scent, after which come smal blackish Berries, full of Juyce while they are fre sh, wherein there lie smal hard Kernels or Seed. The Root doth creep under the upper crust of the ground, springing afresh in divers places being of the bigness of ones finger or Thumb somtimes. Places. The Elder - Tree groweth in Hedges, being planted the re to strengthen the Fences, and Partitions of Grounds, and to hold up the Banks by Ditches, and Water - courses. The Dwarf Elder groweth Wild in many places of England, where being once gotten into a Ground it is not easily gotten forth again. Times. Mos t of the Elder - Trees Flower in June, and their Fruit is ripe for the most part in August. But the Dwarf Elder, or Wallwort Flowreth somwhat later, and his fruit is not ripe until September. Vertues and Use. The first Shoots of the common Elder boyled li ke Asparagus, & the yong Leavs & Stalks boyled in Fat Broth, doth mightily carry forth Flegm and Choller. The middle [EDGENOTE:] Flegm, Choller, Dropsie. or inner Bark boyled in Water, and given to drink worketh much more violently; and the Berries eithe r green or dry, expel the same humors, and is often given with good success to help the Dropsie.

The distilled Water of the Flowers is of much use to clear the Skin from Sunburning, Freckles, Morphew, or t he like; and taketh away Headaches coming of a cold caus, the Head being bathed therwith.

Either Leavs or Bark of Elder stripped upward as you gather it causeth Vomiting, but stripped downward it purgeth downwards. Also Dr. Butler in a Manuscript of his commends Dwarf Elder to the Sky for Dropsies, viz. to drink it being boyled in white Wine, to drink the Decoction I mean, not the Elder. THE ELM TREE.

Place. It groweth in many Meadows, and grassy places, in this Land. Vertues and Use.

Seed is of good use in Medicines to help shortness of breath, and Wheesing by stopping of the Lungs. It helpeth also to bring down the Courses and to clens the parts after delivery. The Roots are of most use in Physick Drinks and Broths that are taken to clens the Blood, to open Obstructions of the Liver to provoke Urine, and amend the ill colour in the Face after Sickness, and to caus a good habit through the Body: Both Leavs, Seeds, and Roots hereof are much used in Drinks or Broths, to make pe ople more spare and lean that are too fat. The distilled Water of the whol Herb or the condensate Juyce dissolved, but especially the Natural Juyce that in hot Countries issueth out thereof of its own accord, dropped into the Eyes, clenseth them from mists and films that hinder the sight. The sweet Fennel is much weaker in Physical uses, than the common Fennel. The wild Fennel is stronger and hotter than the tame; and therefore most powerful against the Stone, but not so effectual to encreas Milk, because o f its driness. One good old fashion is not yet quite left off, viz. To boil Fennel with Fish, for it consumes that Flegmatick humor which Fish most plentifully afford and annoy the body by, therefore it is a most fit Herb for that purpose though few that use it know why or wherfore they do it, I suppose the Reason of its benefit this way is becaus it is an Herb of Mercury and under Virgo, and therfore bears Antipathy to Pisces.

Description. The ordinary Fleawort riseth up with a Stalk two Foo t high, or more, full of Joynts and Branches on every side up to the top, and at every Joynt two small long and narrow whitish green Leavs somwhat hairy: At the tops of every Branch stand divers small short scaly or chaffy Heads, out of which come forth sm all whitish yellow threds, like to those of the Plantane Herbs, which are the Bloomings or Flowers. The Seed inclosed in those Heads is smal and shining while it is Fresh very like unto Fleas, both for colour and bigness, but turning black when it groweth old. The Root is not long but white, hard, and woody, perishing every yeer and rising again of its own Seed for divers yeers if it be suffered to shed: The whol Plant is somwhat whitish and hairy, smelling somwhat like Rozin. There is another sort hereof differing not from the former in the manner of growing, but only that his Stalk and Branches being somwhat greater do a little more bow down to the ground: The Leavs are somwhat larger; the Heads somewhat lesser, the Seed alike; and the Root and Leavs abid e all the Winter, and perish not as the former.

The Herb is cold and dry, Saturnine, I suppose it obtained the name Fleawort becaus the Seeds are so like Fleas. FLIXWEED. Description. This riseth up with a r ound upright hard Stalk four or five Foot high, spread into sundry Branches, wheron grow many grayish green Leavs very finely cut and severed into a number of short and almost round parts.

The distilled water of the Herb worketh the same effects although somwhat weaker, yet is a fair Medicine, and more acceptable to be taken.

And if this be true as it is, then why should the Vulgar so familiarl y affirm, that eating Nuts causeth shortness of Breath than which nothing is falser, for how can that which strengthens the Lungues cause shortness of breath? I confess the Opinion is far older than I am, I knew Tradition was a Friend to Errors before, but never that he was the Father of Slanders, or are mens tongues so given to slandering one another that they must slander Nuts too, to keep their tongues in use? If any thing of the Hazel Nut be stopping 'tis the Husks and Shels, and no body is so mad to ea t them unless Physically, and the red Skin which covers the Kernel which you may easily pull off. And thus have I made an Apology for Nuts which cannot speak for themselves. HAWKWEED. Description.

It is not my intent to trouble you with a Description of this Tree which is so well know n that it needeth none. [p. 63] It is ordinarily but a Hedg Bush, although being pruned and dressed it groweth to be a Tree of a reasonable height. As for the Hawthorn tree at Glastenbury, which is said to flower yearly on Christmas Day, it rather shews the superstition of those who observe it for the time of its Flowring, than any great wonder, sith the like may be found in diverse other places of this land, as in Whey - street in Rumney Marsh, and neer unto Nantwiche in Cheshire by a place called White - G reen, where if the Winter be milde they will be white blossomes all over before and about Christmas, as in May, if the weather be frosty, it Flowreth not until January, or that the hard weather be over.

Our common Henbane hath very large, thick, soft, wooly Leavs lying upon the ground, much cut in or torn on the edges of a dark ill grayish green colour, among which rise up divers thick & short Stalks two or three foot high, spread into divers smaller Branches with lesser Leavs on them, and many hollow Flowers scarce appearing above the Husks, and usually torn on the one side, ending in five round points growing one above another, of a deadish yellow colour, somwhat paler toward the edges, with many purplish Veins therein, and of a dark yellowish purple in the bottom of the Flower, with a smal pointel of the same colour in the middle, each of them standing in hard close Husk, which after the Flower is past, groweth very like the Husk of Asarabacca, and somwhat sharp at the top Points, wherein is contained much smal Seed very like Poppy Seed, but of a dusky grayish colour. The Root is great, white and thick, branching forth divers waies under ground, so like a Parsnip Root (but that it is not so white) that it hath deceived divers.

And applied with Vinegar to the Forehead and Temples, helpeth the Headach and want of sleep in hot Feavers. The Juyce of the Herb or Seed, or the Oyl drawn from the Seed doth the like. The Oyl of the Seed is helpful for the Deafness, Nois, and Worms in the Ears, being dropped therein; the Juyce of the Herb, or Root doth also the same. The Decoction of the Herb, or Seed, or both, killeth Lice in Man and Beast. The fume of the dried Herb Stalks and Seed burned, quickly healeth Swellings, Chilblains, or Kibes in the Hands or Feet, by holding them in the fume thereof.

But Henba ne delights most to grow in Saturnine places, and whol Cart loads of it may be found neer the places where they empty the common Jakes, and scarce a stinking Ditch to be found without, it growing by it.

The Decoction of the Leavs of Mercury, or the Juyce thereof in Broth, or Drunk with a little Sugar put to it, purgeth Chollerick and waterish Humors. Hippocrates commendeth it wonderfully for Womens Diseases; and applied it to the se cret parts to eas the pains of the Mother; and used the Decoction of it both to procure Womens Courses, and to expel the Afterbirth: And give the Decoction thereof with Mirrh or Pepper, or used to apply the Leavs outwardly against the Strangury, and Diseas es of the Reins and Bladder. He used it also for sore and watering Eyes, and for the Deafness and pain in the Ears, by dropping the Juyce therof into them, and bathing them afterwards in white Wine. EDGENOTE Purgeth Chollerick Humors, Womens sickness, Mot her, Womens Courses, Strangury, sore Eyes, Agues, Flegm, Rhewms and Catarrhes, Melancholly Humors. The Decoction therof made with Water and a Cock Chicken, is a most safe Medicine against the hot fits of Agues: It also clenseth the Breast and Lungs of Fle gm, but a little offendeth the Stomach: The Juyce or distilled Water snuffed up into the Nostrils purgeth the Head and Eyes of Catarrhes and Rhewms. Some use to drink two or three ounces of the distilled water with a little Sugar put to it, in the morning fasting, to open and purge the Body of gross viscous and Melancholly Humors. It is wonderful (if it be not Fabulous) that Dioscorides and Theophrastus do relate of it: Viz. That if Women use these Herbs either Inwardly or outwardly for three daies together after Conception, and their Courses be past, they shal bring forth Male or Female Children, according to that kind of [p. 82] Herb they use. Mathiolus saith, That the [EDGENOTE:] Yellow Jaundice, Warts, Scabs, Tetters, & ringworms, Swellings, Inflamati ons, Waterish & Melancholly Humors. Seed of both the Male and Female Mercury boyled with Wormwood and drunk, cureth the yellow Jaundice in a speedy manner: The Leavs or the Juyce rubbed upon Warts, taketh them away: The Juyce mingled with some Vinegar, he lpeth all running Scabs, Tetters, Ringworms and the Itch. Galen saith that being applied in manner of a Pultis, to any Swelling or Inflamation, it digesteth the Swelling and allayeth the Inflamation; and is therfore given in Clysters to evacuate the Belly from offensive Humors. The Dogs Mercury, although it be less used yet may serve in the same manner to the same purpose to purge waterish and Melanchollick Humors. Mercury they say owns this Herb, but I rather think 'tis Venus, and am partly confident of it too, for I never read that Mercury ever minded Womens businesses so much, I beleev he minds his study more.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

But if a Spirit thereof be rightly and Chimically drawn it is much more powerful than the Herb it self. Simeon Sethi saith, It helpeth a cold Liver, strengthneth the Belly and Stomach, causeth digestion, staieth Vomit and the Hiccough, is good against the Gnawings of the Heart, prov oketh Appetite, taketh away Obstructions of the Liver, and stirreth up Bodily Lust: But thereof too much must not be taken, becaus it maketh the Blood thin and wheyish, and turneth it into choller, and therfore Chollerick persons must obstain from it."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

It Flowreth in the Spring time, but the Berries be not ripe until October, and abide on the Branches all the Winter, unless the Black - Birds, and other Birds do devour them. Vertues and Use. Both the Leavs and Berries of Mistleto do heat and dry, and are of subtil parts: The Birdlime doth mollifie hard Knots, Tumors, and Impostumes, ripeneth and discusseth them; and draweth forth thick as well as thin Humors from the remote places of the Body, digesting and sep arating them: And being mixed with equal parts of Rozin and Wax, doth mollifie the hardness of the Spleen, and healeth old Ulcers and Sores: Being mixed with Sandarack, and Ortment, it helpeth to draw off foul Nails: and if quicklime and [EDGENOTE:] Impos tums, Spleen, Ulcers, Falling - sickness, Apoplexy, Palsey.

The Mistleto it self of the Oak (as the best) made into Pouder and given in drink to those that have the Falling - sickness, doth assuredly heal them as Mathiolus saith, but it is fit to use it for forty daies together. Some have so highly esteemed of the Vertues hereof that they have called it Lignum Sanctae Crucus, Wood of the holy Cross, beleeving it to help the Falling - sickness, Apoplexie, and Palsie very speedily, not only to be inwardly taken, but to be hung at their Necks. Tragus saith, That the fresh Wood of any Mistleto bruised, and the Joyce drawn forth and dropped into the Ears that have Imposthumes in them, doth help and eas them within a few daies. That it is under the Dominion of the Sun, I do not question, and can also take for granted that that which grows upon Oaks participates somthing of the Nature of Jupiter, becaus an Oak is one of his Trees; as also that which grows upon Pear - t rees and Apple - trees, participates somthing of the Nature, becaus he rules the Trees, and it draws sap from the Trees, it grows upon having no Root of its own, but why that should have most vertues that grows upon Oaks I know not, unless becaus 'tis rarest , and hardest to come by, and our Colledges Opinion is in this contrary to the Scripture which saith, Gods tender Mercies are over all his Works, and so 'tis, Let the Colledg of Physitians walk as contrary to him as they pleas, and that's as contrary as th e East is to the West. Clusius affirms that which grows upon Pear - trees to be as prevalent, and give order that is should not touch the ground after it is gathered, and also saith, That being hung about the Neck, it remedies Witchcraft.

MOONWORT. Description. This rise th up usually but with one dark green thick and fat Leaf standing upon a short footstalk, not above two fingers breadth; but when it will flower it may be said to beare a small slender stalk about four or five Inches high, having but one leaf set in the mi ddle therof, which is much devided on both sides into somtimes five or seven parts on a sid, somtimes more, each of which parts is small next the middle rib, but broad forwards and round pointed, resembling therein an half Moon from whence it took the name , the upper most parts or divisions being less than the lowest: The Stalk riseth above this Leaf two or three inches, bearing many Branches of small long Tongues, every one like the spiky Head of Adders - tongue, of a brownish colour, which whether I shall c all them Flowers or the Seed, I well know not: which after they have continued a while resolve into a Mealy dust: The Root is smal and Fibrous.

It is to be found only in April and May, for in June when any hot weather cometh for the most part it i s withered and gone. Vertues and Use. Moonwort is cold and drying more than Adders - tongue, and is therefore held to be more available for all Wounds both inward and outward: The Leavs boyled in red Wine and drunk stayeth the immoderate Flux of Womens Cou rses and the Whites: It also staieth Bleeding, Vomitings, and other Fluxes; It helpeth all Blows and Bruises, and to consolidate all Fractures and Dislocations.

The Gound - Moss, growing i n our moist Woods, and the bottoms of Hills, in boggy grounds, and in shadowy Ditches, and many other such like places. The Tree - Moss groweth only on Trees. Vertues and Use. The Ground - Moss, is held to be singular good to break the Stone, and to expel a nd drive it forth by Urin, being boyled in Wine and drunk: The Herb bruised and boyled in Water and applied easeth al Inflamations and pains coming of an hot caus; and is therfore used to eas the pains of the hot Gout.

Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 The Tree - Mosses are cooling and binding, and partake of a digesting and mollifying quality withal, as Galen saith. But each Moss doth partake of the Nature of the Tree from whence it is ta ken; therefore that of the Oak is more Binding; and is of good effect to stay Fluxes in man or Woman, as also Vomitings or Bleedings, the Pouder thereof being taken in Wine: The Decoction thereof in Wine is very good for Women to be bathed with, or to sit in that are toubled with the overflowing of their Courses: The same being drunk stayeth the Stomach that is troubled with casting, [p. 85] or the Hiccough; and as Avicenna saith, it comforteth the Heart: The Pouder thereof taken in Drink for some time to gether, is thought available for the Dropsie. The Oyl of Roses that hath had fresh Moss steeped therin for a time, and after boyled and applied to the Temples and Forehead, doth Merveilously eas the Headach coming of a hot caus, as also the Distillations o f hot Rhewm or Humors to the Eyes or other parts: The Antients much used it in their Oyntments and other Medicines against Lassitude, and to strengthen and comfort the Sinews. For which, if it was good then, I know no reason but it may be found so still. MOTHERWORT. Description. This hath a hard, square, brownish, rough, strong Stalk, rising three or four foot high at the least, spreading into many Branches, whereon grow Leavs on each side with long Footstalks, two at every Joynt, which are somwhat broad and long as it were, rough, or crumpled, with many great Veins therein; of a sad green colour, and deeply dented about the edges, and almost devided: From the middle of the Branches up to the tops of them (which are very long and smal) grow the Flowers ro und about them at distances in sharp pointed rough hard Husks, of a more red or purple - colour than Balm or Horehound, but in the same manner and form as the Horehounds: after which come smal round blackish Seed in great plenty: The Root sendeth forth a num ber of long Strings and smal Fibres, taking strong hold in the Ground; of a dark yellowish or brownish colour, and abideth as the Horehound doth; the smell of this being not much different from it. Place. It groweth only in Gardens with us in England. V ertues and Use. Motherwort, is held to be of much use for the trembling of the Heart, and in faintings and swounings from whence it took the name Cardiaca. The Pouder thereof to the quantity of a spoonful drunk in Wine is a wonderful help to Women in thei r Sore Travails, as also for the suffocations or risings of the Mother; and from these effects it is likely it took the name of Motherwort with us. It also provoketh Urine and Womens Courses, clenseth the Chest of cold Flegm oppressing it, and killeth the Worms in the Belly: It is of good use to warm and dry up the cold Humors, to digest and dispers them that are settled in the Veins, Joynts, and Sinews of the Body, and to help Cramps, and Convulsions.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

MOUSEAR. Ths is a low Herb creeping upon the gr ound by small strings like the Strawberry Plant, whereby it shooteth forth small Roots, whereat grow upon the Ground many small and somwhat short Leavs set in a round form together, hollowish in the middle where they are broadest, of an hoary colour all ov er, and very hairy, which being broken do give a white Milk: From among these Leavs spring up two or three smal hoary Stalks about a span high, with a few smaller Leavs thereon; At the tops whereof standeth usually but one Flower, consisting of many paler yellow Leavs broad at the points, and a little dented in, set in three or four rows, the greater outermost, very like a Dandelyon Flower, and a little reddish underneath about the edges, especially if it grow in a dry ground: which after they have stood lo ng in Flower, do turn into Down, which with the Seed is carryed away with the Wind.

MUGWORT. Description. The common Mugwort have divers Leavs lying upon the ground, very much devided, or cut deeply in about the Brims somwhat like Wormwood but much larger, of a dark green colour on the upper side and very hoary white underneath. The stalks rise to be four or five foot high, having on it such like Leavs as those below, but somwhat smaller, branching forth very much toward the top, whereon are set very small pale y ellowish Flowers like Buttons, which fall away, and after them come small Seed inclosed in round Heads: The Root is long and hard with many smal Fibres growing from it, whereby it taketh strong hold in the ground, but both Stalk and Leaf do die down every yeer, and the Root shooteth anew in the Spring. The whol Plant is of a reasonable good scent, and is more easily propogated by the Slips, than by the Seed. Place. It groweth plentifully in many places of this Land, by the way sides, as also by smal Water - Courses, and in divers other places. Time. It Flowreth and Seedeth in the end of Summer. Vertues and Use. Mugwort is with good success put among other Herbs that are boyled for Women to sit over the hot Decoction, to draw down their Courses, to help t he Delivery of the Birth, and expel the Afterbirth, as also for the Obstructions and Inflamations of the Mother. It breaketh [EDGENOTE:] Terms provokes, Birth, Afterbirth, Womb Inflamed, Wens, Kings Evil, pains in the Neck, Opium, Sciatica, Sinews pained, Cramp. the Stone, and causeth one to make water where it is stopped: The Juyce thereof made up with Mirth, and put under as a Pessary, worketh the same effect, and so doth the Root also, being made up with Hogs Greas into an Oyntment, it taketh away Wens and hard Knots and Kernels that grow about the Neck and Throat, and easeth the pains about the Neck more effectually, if some Field Daisies be put with it.

It is very comfortable to the Stomach, an d helpeth to provoke Urine and Womens Courses, and to break wind both in the Stomach and Bowels, and doth a little open the Body, but the Root much more, and openeth Obstructions both of the Liver and Spleen, and is therfore accounted one of the five openi ng Roots; Galen commendeth it against the Falling - sickness, and to provoke Urine mightily, especialy if the Roots be boyled and eaten like Parsnips. The Seed is effectual to provoke Urine and Womens Courses, to expel wind, to break the Stone, and eas the p ains and torments thereof, or of any other part in the Body occasioned by Wind. It is also effectual against the Venom of any poysonfull Creature, and the danger that cometh to them that have taken Litharge, and is good against the Cough.

The Juyce thereof dropped into the Ears with a little Wine easeth the pains. Tragus setteth down an excellent Medicine to help the Jaundice and Falling - sickness, the Dropsie, and Stone in the Kidneys, in this manner: Take of the S eeds of Parsley, Fennel, Annis, and Caraways of each an ounce; of the Roots of Parsley, Burnet, Saxifrage, and Carawares, of each one ounce and a half, let the Seeds be bruised, and the Roots washed and cut smal: Let them lie all night in steep in a pottle of [p. 189 -- note that page numbering skips from 92 to 189] white Wine, and in the morning be Boyled in a close earthen Vessel until a third part or more be washed, which being strained and cleared; take four ounces thereof morning and evening first an d last, abstaining from drink after it for three hours: This openeth Obstructions of the Liver and Spleen, and expelleth the Dropsie and Jaundice by Urine. PARSNIP. The Garden kind hereof is so well known (the Root being commonly eaten) that I shal not t rouble you with any Description of it. But the wild kind being of more Physical use, I shall in this place describe unto you. Description. The wild Parsnip differeth little from the Garden kind, but groweth not so fair and large, nor hath so many Leavs; and the Root is shorter, more woody and not so fit to be eaten, and therefore the more Medicinable. Place. The name of the first sheweth the place of its growth, Viz. In Gardens. The other groweth wild in divers places, as in the Marshes by Rochester an d elswhere, and flowreth in July; the Seed being ripe about the beginning of August, the second yeer after the sowing: for if they do flower the first yeer the Country people call them Madneps. Vertues and Use. The Garden Parsnep nourisheth much, and is good and wholsom Nourishment, but a little windy, whereby it is thought to procure bodily lust: but it fatneth the Body much if much used. It is conducible to the Stomach and Reins, and provoketh Urine.

This groweth with three or four large spread, wing ed, rough, Leavs, lying often on the Ground, or else raised a little for it, with long, round, hairy footstalks under them, parted usually into five devisions, the two couples standing each against other, and one at the end, and each Leaf being almost roun d, yet somwhat deeply cut in on the edges in some Leavs, and not so deep in others, of a whitish green colour, smelling somwhat strongly: among which ariseth up a round crested hairy Stalk two or three foot high with a few Joynts and Leavs thereon, and bra nched at the top, where stand large Umbels of white, and somtimes reddish Flowers, and after them, flat, whitish, thin winged Seed, two alwaies joyned together.

THE PEACH - TREE. Description. The Peach - tree groweth not so great as the Apricock - t ree, yet spreadeth Branches reasonable well, from whence spring smaller reddish twigs, whereon are set long and narrow green leavs dented about the edges. The Blossoms are greater than the Plum, and of a light Purple colour. The Fruit round, and somtimes a s big as a reasonable Pippin, others are smaller, as also differing in colours and [p. 190] tasts, as russet, red, or yellow, waterish or firm, with a frieze or Cotton all over, with a cleft therein like an Apricock, and a rugged furrowed great Stone wit hin it, and a bitter Kernel within the Stone: It sooner waxeth old, and decayeth, than the Apricock, by much. Place. They are nursed up in Gardens and Orchards through this Land. Time. They Flower in the Spring, and Fructifie in Autumn. Vertues and Us e. The Leavs of Peaches bruised and laid on the Belly killeth Worms; and so they do also being boyled in Ale and drunk, and open the Belly likewise; and being dried is a safe Medicine to discuss Humors. The Pouder of them strewed upon fresh bleeding Wound s, stayeth their bleeding and closeth them up. The Flowers steeped all night in a little Wine standing warm, strained forth in the morning and drunk fasting, doth gently open the Belly and move it downwards. A Syrup made of them as the Syrup of Roses is ma de, worketh more forcibly than that of Roses, for it provoketh Vomiting, and spendeth waterish and Hydropick Humors by the continuance thereof. The Flowers made into a Conserve worketh the same effect. The Liquor that droppeth from the Tree being wounded, is given in the Decoction of Coltsfoot, to those that are troubled with the Cough or shortness of breath, by adding thereto some sweet Wine; and putting some Saffron also therin, it is good for those that are hoarce or have lost their voice; [EDGENOTE:] W orms, Open, Humors, Wounds, Dropsie, Cough, Shortness of Breath, Vomiting. helpeth all defects of the Lungs, and those that vomit or spit blood.

The Oyl drawn frm the Kernels, the Temples being therewith anointed doth the like: The said Oyl put into Clysters easeth the pains of the wind Chollick, and anointed on the lower part of the Belly doth the like, and dropped into the Ears easeth the pains of them: The Juyce of the Leavs doth the like: being also anointed on the Forehead and Temples, it helpeth the Megrim and all other pains in the Head. If the Kernels be bruised and boyled in Vinegar until they become thick, and appliled to the Head, it merveilously procure the Hair to grow again upon bald places or where it is too thin.

THE PEAR - TREE. These are so well known that they need no Description. Vertues and Use. For their Physical use they are best discerned by the ir tasts: All the sweet or lushious sorts whether manured or wild, do help to move the Belly downward more or less: [EDGENOTE:] Mushroms, Stomach, Inflamations, Cool, Bind, Wounds. Those that are harsh and sowr do on the contrary bind the Belly as much; and the Leavs do so also. Those that are moist do in some sort cool, but harsh or wild sorts much more, and are very good in repelling Medicines: as if the wild sorts be boyled with Mushroms, it maketh them the less dangerous. The said Pears boyled with a little Honey, helpeth much the oppressed Stomach, as al sorts of them do, some more, some less; but the harsher sorts do most cool and bind, serving well to be bound to green wounds to cool and stay the Blood, and heal up the wound without further trouble or Inflamation; as Galen saith he hath found by experience. And wild Pears do sooner close up the Lips of green Wounds than the others. Schola Salerni adviseth to drink much Wine after Pears, or els (they say) they are as bad as poyson, nay and they curs the Tree for it too, but if a poor man find his Stomach"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

The Tree belongs to Venus, and so doth the Apple - tree. [p. 191] PELLITORY OF THE WALL. Description. This ris eth up with many brownish, red, tender and weak, clear, and almost transparent stalks about two foot high, upon which grow at the several Joynts, two Leavs somwhat broad and long, of a dark green colour, which afterwards turn brownish, smooth on the edges, but rough and hairy as the Stalks are also: At the Joynts with the Leavs from the middle of the Stalks upwards, wher it spreadeth into some branches, stand many smal pale, purplish Flowers, in hairy rough Heads or Husks; after which come smal black and ro ugh Seed, which will stick to any cloth or Garment that shall touch it. The Root is somwhat long with many smal Fibres thereat, of a dark reddish colour, which abideth the Winter, although the Stalks and Leavs perish and spring afresh every yeer. Place. It groweth wild generally through this Land, about the borders of Fields, and by the sides of Walls, and among Rubbish; It will endure well being brought into Gardens, and planted on the shady side, where it will spring of its own sowing. Time. It flowre th in June and July, and the Seed is ripe soon after. Vertues and Use. The dried Herb Pellitory made up into an Electuary with Honey, or the Juyce of the Herb, or the Decoction thereof made up with Sugar or Honey, is a singular Remedy for any old or dry Cough, the shortness of breath, and Wheesing in the Throat. Three ounces of the Juyce thereof taken at a time, doth wonderfully help stopping of the Urine and to expel the Stone or Gravel in the Kidneys or Bladder: and is therefore usually put among other Herbs, used in [EDGENOTE:] Old or Dry Cough, Shortness of Breath, Stone and Gravel, Mother, Womens Courses, Obstructions, Sore Throats, Teeth. Clisters to mitigate pains in the Back, Sides, or Bowels proceeding of wind, stopping of Urine, the Gravel or S tone as aforesaid: If the bruised Herb sprinkled with some Muskadine be warmed upon a Tile; or in a Dish upon a few quick coals in a Chafing - dish, and applied to the Belly, it worketh the same effect. The Decoction of the Herb being drunk, easeth pains of the Mother, and bringeth down Womens Courses; it also easeth those griefs that arise from Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen, and Reins: The same Decoction with a little Honey added thereto is good to gargle a sore Throat. The Juyce held a while in the Mout h, easeth pains in the Teeth.

PENY - ROYAL. Description. This is so well known unto all (I mean the common kind) that it needeth no Description. There is a greater kind than the ordinary sort found wild wit h us, which so abideth being brought into Gardens, and differeth not from it but only in the largeness of the leavs and Stalks, in rising higher, and not creeping upon the ground so much.

The Male Peony riseth up with many brownish Stalks, whereon grow many fair green and somtimes reddish Leavs, one set against another upon a Stalk without any particular d evision in the Leaf at all. The Flowers stand at the tops of the Stalks, consisting of five or six broad Leavs, of a fair purplish red colour, with many yellow threds in the middle standing about the Head, which after riseth to be the Seed Vessels, devided into two, three, or four rough crooked Pods like Horns, which being ful ripe, open, and turn themselves down one edge to another backward, shewing within them divers round, black shining Seed, having also many red or Crimson grains, intermixed with the bl ack, whereby it maketh a very pretty shew. The Roots are great, thick, and long, spreading and running down reasonable deep in the Ground. The ordinary Female Peony hath many Stalks and more Leavs on them than the Male: the Leavs not so large but nicked d iversly on the edges, some with great and deep, others with smaller cuts and devisions, of a dark or dead green colour. The Flowers are of a strong heady scent, most usually smaller and of a more purple colour than the Male, with yellow thrums about the He ad as the Male hath. The Seed Vessels are like Horns as in the Male, but smaller, the Seed also is black but less shining. The Roots consist of many thick and short tuberous clogs, fastned at the ends of long strings and all from the Head of the root which is thick and short, and of the like scent with the Male. Place and Time. They grow in Gardens; and Flower usually about May. Vertues and Use. The Root of the Male Peony fresh gathered, hath been found by experience to cure the [p. 193] Falling - sickn ess; but the surest way is (besides hanging it about the Neck, by which Children have been cured) to take the Root of the Male Peony washed clean and stamped somwhat smal, and lay it to infuse in Sack for twenty four Hours, at the least, after strain it, a nd take first and last, morning and evening a good draught for sundry daies together before and after a full Moon, and this will also cure older persons, if the Disease be not grown too old and past cure, especially if there be a due and orderly preparatio n of the Body, with Posset drink made of Betony &c.

The black Seed also taken before bed time, and in the morning, is very effectual for such as in their sleep are tro ubled with the Disease called Ephialtes or Incubus, but we do commonly cal it the Night - Mare; a diseas which Melancholly persons are subject unto; It is also good against Melanchollick Dreams. The Distilled water, or Syrup made of the Flowers, worketh the same effects that the Root and the Seed do, although more weakly. The Female is often used for the purposes aforesaid, by reason the Male is so scarce a Plant that it is possessed by few, and those great Lovers of rarities in this kind. It is an Herb of t he Sun, and under the Lyon, Physitians say Male Peony Roots are best, but Dr. Reason told me, male Peony was best for men, and female Peony for women and he desires to be judged by his brother Dr. Experience.

PERIWINKLE. Description. The common sort hereof hath many Branches trayling, or running upon the ground shooting out smal Fibres at the Joynts as it runneth, taking thereby hold in the ground and Ro oteth in divers places. At the Joynts of these Branches stand two small dark green shining Leavs, somwhat like Bay Leavs, but smaller, and with them come forth also the Flowers (one at a Joynt standing upon a tender Footstalk) being somwhat long and hollow , parted at the brims, somtimes into four somtimes five Leavs, the most ordinary sort are of a pale blue Colour, some are pure white, and some of a dark reddish Purple colour. The Root is little bigger than a Rush, bushing in the ground, and creeping with his Branches far about, whereby it quickly possesseth a great compass, and is therfore most usually planted under Hedges, where it may have room to run. Place. Those with the pale blue, and those with the white Flowers grow in Woods and Orchards by the H edg sides in diverse places of this Land. But those with the Purple Flowers in Gardens only. [p. 194] Time. They Flower in March and April. Vertues and Use. The Periwincle is a great binder, staying bleeding both at Mouth and Nose, if some of the Leav s be chewed: The French use it to stay Womens Courses. Discorides, Galen, and Aegineta commend it against the Lask, and Fluxes of the Belly to be drunk in Wine. [EDGENOTE:] Stanch bleeding, Womens Courses, Flux of the Belly.

Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 If Superstition had not been the Father of Tradition, as well as Ignorance the Mother of Devotion, this Herb as well as St. Johns wort had found some oth er name to be known by; but we may say of our Fore - fathers as St. Paul of the Athenians, I perceive that in many things you are too Superstitious: Yet seing it is come to that pass, that Custom having gotten possession pleads Prescription for the name, I s hall let it pass, and come to the Description of the Herb, which take as followeth. Description. It riseth up with square upright Stalks for the most part, somwhat greater and higher than St. Johns wort (and good reason too, St. Peter being the greater A postle (ask the Pope else) for though God would have the Saints equal, the Pope is of another Opinion) but brown in the same manner, having two Leavs at every Joynt, somwhat like, but larger than St. Johns wort, and a little rounder pointed with few or no Holes to be seen therein, and having somtimes some smaller Leavs rising from the Bosom of the greater, and somtimes a little hairy also: At the tops of the Stalks stand many Starlike Flowers, with yellow threds in the middle very like those of St. Johns wo rt, insomuch that this is hardly discerned from it but only by the largeness of height, the Seed being also alike in both. The Root abideth long sending forth new shoots every yeer. Place. It groweth in many Groves and small low Woods, in divers places o f this Land, as in Kent, Huntington, Cambridg, and Northampton shires, as also neer water Courses in other places. Time. It Flowreth in June and July, and the Seed is ripe in August. Vertues and Use. It is of the same property with St. Johns wort, but somwhat weak, and therefore more seldom used. Two drams of the Seed taken at a time in Honeyed water, purgeth Chollerick Humors (as saith Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen) and thereby helpeth those that are troubled with the Sciatica: The Leavs are used as St . Johns wort, to help those places of the Body that have been burnt with Fire. [EDGENOTE:] Chollerick Humors, Sciatica, Burnings. There is not a straw to chuse between this and St. Johns wort, only St. Peter must have it, lest he should lack Pot - herbs. PIMPERNEL. Discription. Common Pimpernel hath diverse weak square Stalks lying on the ground beset all along with two smal and almost round Leavs at every Joynt one against another, very like Chickweed, but hath no Footstalks, for the Leavs do as it were compass the Stalk: The Flowers stand singly each by themselves at them and the Stalks, consisting of five round small pointed Leavs of a fine pale red colour, tending to an Orange, with so many threds in the middle, in whose places succeed, smooth round H eads, wherein is contained smal Seed.

This is of a clensing and attractive quality, whereby it draweth forth Thorns or Splinters, or other such like things gotten into the Flesh, and put up into the Nostrils purget h the Head; and Galen saith also they have a drying faculty, whereby they are good to soder the lips of Wounds, and to clens foul Ulcers.

These Pills also are special good for those that have the Dropsie, to be continued for some time. The same is a special good help for the Jaun dice, and for griping pains in the Joynts, Belly, or inward parts: It helpeth also all Diseases of the Brain proceeding of cold and Flegmatick Humors and Distillations, as also for the Falling - sickness. It is an especial Remedy for the Poyson of the Aconit es of all sorts, and other poisonful Herbs, as also against the stinking of any Venemous Creature: It is a good Remedy for a cold Cough, especially in the beginning. For all this purposes aforesaid, the Herb being tunned up in new Drink and drunk is almost as effectual, but far more accetable to weak and dainty Stomachs. The Distilled Water of the Herb hath the same effects, but more weakly. The Conserve of the Flowers doth the like, which Mathiolus much commendeth against the Palsey. The green Herb or the Decoction thereof being applied, dissolveth the hardness of Womens Breasts, and all other hard Swellings in any other part of the Body. The green Herb also applied, or the Juyce thereof with some Honey, not only clenseth putrid, stinking foul and Malignant Ulcers and Sores of all sorts, but healeth and sodereth up the lips of green Wounds in any part also.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

PLANTANE. This grow eth so familiarly in Meadows and Fields, and by Pathways, and is so well known that it needeth no Description. Time. It is in its beauty about June, and the Seed ripeneth shortly after. Vertues and Use. The Juyce of Plantane clarified and drunk for div ers daies together, either of it self or in other drink prevaileth wonderfully against all torments or Excoriations in the Guts or Bowels, helpeth the distillations of Rhewm from the Head, and staieth all manner of Fluxes even Womens Courses when they flow too abundantly; It is good to stay spitting of [p. 196] Blood, and all other Bleedings at the Mouth, or the making of foul or bloody water by reason of any Ulcer in the reins or Bladder, and also stayeth the too free bleeding of Wounds. [EDGENOTE:] Pain s in the Guts, Distillation of Rhewm, Fluxes, Womens Courses, Spitting Blood or Bleeding at Mouth or Nose or of Wounds, phtisick, Consumption or Ulcers in the Lungs. It is held an especial Remedy for those that are troubled with the Phtisick, or Consumpti on of the Lungs, or Ulcers in the Lungs, or Coughs that come of heat. The Decoction or Pouder of the Roots or Seed, is much more binding for all the purposes aforesaid than the Leavs. Dioscorides saith, That three Roots boyled in Wine and taken helpeth the Tertain Ague, and four the Quartan Ague: But (letting pass the number as Fabulous) I conceive the Decoction of divers Roots may be effectual. The Herb (but especially the Seed) is held to be profitable againt the Dropsie, the Falling - sickness, the yellow Jaundice, and stoppings of the Liver and Reins. The Roots of Plantane and Pellitory of Spain beaten to Pouder and put into hollow Teeth, taketh away the pains of them: The clarified Juyce or distilled Water dropped into the Eyes cooleth the Inflamations in them, and taketh away the Pin and Web; and dropped into the Ears easeth pains in them, and helpeth and restoreth the Hearing: The same also with Juyce of [EDGENOTE:] Tertian Ague, Dropsie & Falling - sickness, Toothach, pin and web in the Eyes, pains in th e Ears, Inflamations, Burning or Scalding, Hollow Ulcers, Cankers, and sore Mouth, or privy parts, Piles.

The Juyce or Decoc tion made either of it self or other things of like nature is of much use and good effect for old and hollow Ulcers that are hard to be cured, and for Cankers and Sores in the Mouth or privy parts of Man or Woman; and helpeth also the pains of the Piles in the Fundament.

It is also good to be applied where any Bone is out of Joynt to hinder Inflamations, Swellings and Pains that presently [EDGENOTE:] pains of the Head, Luna cy & phrensie, Biting of Serpents, or Mad Dogs, Hot Gouts, Bones out of Joynt, Worms in the Belly, or in Ulcers, Scabs and Itch, Tetters, Ringworms, Shingles, & fretting sores, Wounds. rise thereupon. The Pouder of the dried Leavs taken in drink, killeth Worms of the Belly, and boyled in Wine killeth Worms that breed in old and foul Ulcers. One part of Plantane Water, and two parts of the brine of Pouder'd Beef boyled together and clarified, is a most sure Remedy to heal all spreading Scabs and Itch in the Head or Body, and all manner of Tetters, Ringworms, the Shingles, and all other running and fretting Sores. Briefly the Plantanes are singular good Wound Herbs to heal fresh, or old Wounds and Sores either inward or outward. Its true Myzaldus and others yea almost all Astrologo - Physitians hold this to be an Herb of Mars, and they give a verisimile of a truth for it too, Viz. becaus it cures diseases of the Head and privities which are under the Houses of Mars, Aries, and Scorpio: All Diseases of the Head coming of heat are caused by Mars, for Venus is made of no such hot mettle, or at least deals in inferior parts. The truth is, it is under the command of Venus, and cures the Head by Antipathy to Mars, and the Privities by Sympathy to Venus, neither is the re hardly a Martial Diseas but it cures, If I were to fortifie my Body against a Martial Diseas I would do it by this Herb as soon as by any, and may do it (it may be) when time shal serve. PLUMS. These are so well known that they need no Description. V ertues and Use. As there is great diversity of the kinds, so is there in the operations of Plums, for some that are sweet, moisten the Stomach and make the Belly soluble; those that are sowr quench thirst more and bind the Belly; the moist and waterish do soonest corrupt in the Stomach, but the firm do nourish more and offend less: The dried Fruit sold by the Grocers under the name of Damask Prunes, do somwhat loosen the Belly, and being stewed are often used both in health and sickness, to rellish the Mou th and Stomach to procure Appetite, and a little to open the Body, allay Choller, and cool the Stomach: Plum - tree Leavs boyled in Wine, is good to wash and gargle the Mouth and Throat to dry the Flux of Rhewm coming to the Pallat, Gums, or Almonds of the E ars.

And that five ounces of the said Oyl taken with one ounce of Muscadine, driveth forth the Stone, and helpeth the Chollick. All Plums are under Venus, and ar e like Women, some better, some worse. [p. 196] POLLIPODY of the OAK. Description. This is a smal Herb consisting of nothing but Roots and Leavs: bearing neither Stalk, Flower, nor Seed as it is thought. It hath three or four Leavs rising from the Root , every one singly by it self, of about a hand length, which are winged, consisting of many smal narrow Leavs, cut into the middle rib standing on each side of the Stalk, large below, and smaller up to the top, not dented or notched on the edges at all, as the Male Fern hath; of a sad green colour and smooth on the upper side, but on the underside somwhat rough, by reason of certain yellowish spots set thereon: The Root is smaller than ones little finger lying aslope, or creeping along under the upper crust of the earth, browish on the outside, and greenish within, of a sweetish harshness in tast, set with certain rough Knags on each side thereof, having also much Mossiness or yellow hairiness upon it, and some Fibres underneath it, whereby it is nourished. Place. It groweth as well upon old rotten stumps, or trunks of Trees, as Oak, Beech, Hazel; Willow, or any other, as in the Woods under them; and upon old Mud Wals, as also in Mossie, Stony, and gravelly places, neer unto Woods; That which groweth upon O aks is accounted the best, but the quantity thereof is scarce sufficient for the common use. Time. It being alwaies green, may be gathered for use at any time. Vertues and Use. Mesues (who is called the Physitians Evangelist, for the certainty of his M edicines, and the truth of his Opinions) saith, That it drieth up thin Humors, digesteth thick and tough, and purgeth burnt Choller, and especially tough and thick Flegm, and thin Flegm also, even from the Joynts; [EDGENOTE:] Dryeth Humors, purgeth burnt Choller, Flegm, Melancholly, Quartan Agues, Spleen, Chollick. and is therfore good for those that are troubled with Melancholly; or Quartan Agues, especially if it be taken in Whey, or Honeyed Water, or in Barley water, or the Broth of a Chicken with Epit himum, or with Beets and Mallows.

A dram or two of the Pouder of the dried Roots, taken fasting in a cup of Honeyed water, worketh gently, and for the purposes aforesaid. The distilled water both of Roots and Leavs is much commended for the Quartan Ague, to be taken for many da ies together, as also against Melancholly, or fearful or troublesom sleeps or Dreams, and with some Sugar Candy dissolved therein, is good against the Cough, shortness of breath and Wheesings, and those distillations of thin Rhewm upon the Lungs, which cau s Phtisicks, and oftentimes Consumptions. The fresh Roots beaten smal: or the Pouder of the dried Roots mixed with Honey and applied to any Member that is out of Joynt, doth much help it: Applied also to the Nose cureth the Diseas called Polipus, which is a piece of Flesh growing therein which in time stoppeth the passage of breath through that Nostril; And it helpeth those clefts or Chops that come between the fingers or Toes.

THE POPLAR - TREE. Description. There are two sorts of Poplars which are most familiar with us, Viz. The Black, and the White, both which I shall here describe unto you. The white Poplar groweth great and reasonable high, covered with a thick sm ooth white Bark, especially the Branches, having large Leavs cut into several devisions almost like a Vine Leaf, but not of so deep a green on the upper side, and hoary white underneath, of a reasonable good scent, the whol form representing the Leaf of Co ltsfoot. The Catkins which it bringeth forth before the Leavs, are long, and of a faint reddish colour, which fall away bearing seldom good Seed with them. The Wood hereof is smooth, soft, and white, very finely waved, whereby it is much esteemed. The Bla ck Poplar groweth higher and straiter than the White, with a grayish Bark bearing broad and green leaves somwhat like Ivy [p. 198]                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

They grow in moist Woods and by water sides in sundry places of the Land, yet the white is not so frequent as the other. Time. Their time is likewise expressed before, The Catkins coming forth before the Leavs and ripen in the end of Summer. Vertues and Use. The White Poplar, saith Galen, is of a clensing property: The weight of one ounce in Pouder of the B ark thereof being drunk saith Dioscorides is a Remedy for those that are troubled with the Sciatica, or the Strangury: The Juyce of the Leavs dropped warm into the Ears easeth the pains in them: The yong clammy Buds or Eyes before they break out into Leavs , bruised, and a little Honey put to them, is a good Medicine for a dull Sight. The Black Poplar is held to be more cooling than the White, and therefore the leavs bruised with Vinegar [EDGENOTE:] Sciatica, Strangury, pain in the Ears, Dull sight, Gout, F alling - sickness, Warts, Pushes & Wheals, Heat & Inflamations, Dryeth Womens Milk. and applied, helpeth the Gout; The Seed drunk in Vinegar is held good against the Falling - sickness. The Water that droppeth from the hollow places of this Tree, taketh away Warts, Pushes, Wheals, and other the like breakings out in the Body. The yong black Poplar Buds, saith Mathiolus, are much used by Women to beautifie their hair, bruising them with fresh Butter and straining them after thay have been kept for some time in the Sun.

POPPY. Of this I shal describe three kinds, Viz. The White and Black, of the Garden, and the Erratick, wild Poppy, or Corn Rose. Discription. The white Poppy hath at first four or five whitish green Leavs lying upon the ground, which rise wit h the Stalk, compassing it at the bottom of them, and are very large, much cut or torn in on the edges, and dented also besides: The Stalk which is usually four or five foot high, hath somtimes no Branches at the Top, & usually but two or three at most"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 bea ring every one but one Head, wrapped in a thin Skin, which boweth down before it be ready to blow, and then rising and being broken, the Flower within it spreadeth it self open, and consisteth of four very large White round Leavs, with many whitish round t hreds in the middle, set about a small round green Head, having a Crown, or Star - like cover at the Head thereof, which growing ripe becometh as large as a geat Apple, wherein are contained a great number of smal round Seed, in several partitions or devisio ns next unto the shell, the middle thereof remaining hollow and empty. All the whol Plant, both Leavs, Stalks and Heads, while they are fresh, yong, and green, yield a Milk when they are broken, of an unpleasant bitter tast, almost ready to provoke casting , and of a strong heady smel, which being condensate is called Opium. The Root is white, and woody, perishing as soon as it hath given ripe Seed. The Black Poppy little differeth from the former, until it beareth his Flower, which is somwhat less, and of a black Purplish colour, but without any purple spots in the bottom of the Leaf. The Head of Seed is much less than the former, and openeth it self a little round about the top under the Crown, so that the Seed which is very black will fall out if one turn the Head thereof downwards. The wild Poppy, or Corn Rose, hath long and narrow Leavs very much cut in on the edges into many devisions, of a light green colour, and somtimes hairy withal; The Stalk is blackish and hairy also, but not so tall as the Garde n kinds, having some such like Leavs thereon as grow below, parted into three or four Branches somtimes, whereon grow smal hairy Heads bowing down before the Skin break, wherein the Flower is inclosed, which when it is ful blown open, is of a fair yellowis h red or crimson colour, and in some much paler, without any spot in the bottom of the Leavs, having many black soft threds in the middle compassing a smal green Head, which when it [p. 199] is ripe, is not bigger than ones little finger end, wherin is c ontained much black Seed, smaller by half then that of the Garden. The Root perisheth every yeer, and springeth again of its own sowing. Of this kind there is one lesser in al the parts thereof, and differeth in nothing els. Place. The Garden kinds do no t naturally grow wild in any place, but are all sown in Gardens where they grow. The Wild Poppy, or Corn Rose is plentiful enough, and many times too much in the Corn Fields of all Countries through this Land, and also upon Ditch Banks, and by Hedg sides: The smaller wild kind is also found in Corn Fields, and also in some other places, but not so plentiful as the former. Time. The Garden kinds are usually sown in the Spring, which then Flower about the end of May, and somwhat earlier, if they spring of their own sowing.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

The Garden Poppy Heads with Seeds made into a Syrup, is frequently and to good effect used to procure rest and s leep in the sick and weak, and to stay Catarth's and Defluxions of hot thin Rhewms from the Head into the Stomach, and upon the Lungs, causing a continual Cough, the Fore - runner of a Consumption: It helpeth also Hoarsness of the Throat, and when one hath l ost their voice, which the Oyl of the Seed doth likewise. The black Seed boyled in Wine and drunk, is said also to stay the Flux of the Belly and Womens Courses. The empty shels of the Poppy Heads are usually boyled in water and given to procure rest and s leep; so do the Leavs in the same manner; as also if the Head and Temples be bathed with the Decoction warm, or with the Oyl of Poppies, the green Leaves or Heads bruised and applied with a little Vinegar, or made into a Pultis with Barley Meal, or Hogs Gr eas, it cooleth and tempereth al Inflamations, as also the Diseas called St. Anthonies Fire. It is generally used in [EDGENOTE:] Procure sleep, Catarrhs and defluxions of Rhewm stayeth, Hoarsness, Flux of the Belly and Womens' Courses, Inflamations and St .

The Wild Poppy, or Corn Rose (as Mathiolus saith) is good to prevent the Falling - sickness. The Syrup made with the Flowers is with good effect given to those that have the Pluresie; and the dried Flowers also, eit her boyled in water, or made into Pouder and drunk either in the Distilled Water of them, or in some other Drink worketh the like effect. The Distilled Water of the Flowers, is held to be of much good use against Surfets, being drunk evening and morning; I t is also more cooling than any of the other Poppies, and therefore cannot but be as effectual in hot Agues, Phrensies, and other Inflamations either inward or outward, the Syrup or Water to be used therein, or the green Leavs used outwardly, either in an Oyntment, as it is in Populeon, a cooling Oyntment, or any other waies applied. Galen saith the Seed is dangerous to be used inwardly. The Herb is Lunar, and of the Juyce of it is made Opium, only for lucre of Money they cheat you, and tell you 'tis a kin d of Tear, or some such like thing that drops from Poppies when they weep, and that is some where beyond the Sea, I know not where, beyond the Moon.

ROSES . I hold it altogether needless to trouble the Reader with a Description of any of these, sith both the Garden Roses, and the Wild Roses of the Bryars are well enough known; Take therefore the Vertues of them as follo - [p. 205] weth: And first I shal be gin with the Garden kinds. Vertues and Use. The White and the Red Roses are cooling and drying, yet the White is taken to exceed the Red in both those properties, but is seldom used inwardly in any Medicine. The bitterness in the Roses when they are fres h, especially the Juyce purgeth Choller, and watery Humors, but being dried and that heat which caused the bitterness being consumed, they have then a binding and astringent quality; Those also that are not ful blown do both cool and bind more than those t hat are full blown, and the White Roses more than the Red. The Decoction of Red Roses [EDGENOTE:] Choller, & Waterish Humors, Headach, Pains in the Ears, Eyes, Throat & Gums, Fundament, Bowels & Matrix. made with Wine and used, is very good for the Heada ch, and pains in the Eyes, Ears, Throat, and Gums, as also for the Fundament, the lower Bowels, and the Matrix, being bathed, or put into them. The same Decoction with the Roses remaining in it is profitably applyed to the Region of the Heart to eas the In flamation therin; as also St. Anthonies fire, and other Diseases of the Stomach.

Of the Red Roses are usually made many Compositions all serving to sundry good uses; Viz. Electuary of Roses; Conserve both moist and dry, which is more usually called Sugar of Roses; Syrup of dryed Roses, and Honey of Roses; The Cordial Pouder called Diarhodon Abbatis, and Ar omatica Rosarum; The Distilled Water of Roses, Vinegar of Roses, Oyntment and Oyl of Roses, and the Rose Leavs dried, which although no Composition, yet of very great use and effect.

It purgeth Choller without trouble, and is good in hot Feavers, and pains of the Head arising from hot Chollerick Humors, and heat in the Eyes, the Jaundice also, and Joynt Aches proceeding of hot Humors. The moist Conserve is of much use, both binding and Cordial, for until it be about two years old it is more binding than Cordial, and after that, more Cordial than Binding: Some of the yonger Conserve taken with Methridatum mixed together, is good for those that are troubled with Distillations of Rhewm from the Brain to the Nose, and Defluxions of Rhewm into the Eyes, as also for Fluxes, and Lasks of th e Belly; and being mixed with the Pouder of Mastick is very good for the Running of the Reins, and for other loosness of Humors in the Body.

In the middle of these Balls are often found certain white Worms, which being dried and made into Pouder, and some of it drunk, is found by experience of many to kill and drie forth the Worms of the Belly.

A dram of the dried Root of Monks Rubarb, with a scruple of Ginger made into Pouder and taken fasting in a draught or mess of warm Broth, purgeth Choller and Flegm downward very gently, and safely w ithout danger: The Seed thereof contrarily doth bind the Belly, and helpeth to stay any sort of Lask or Bloody Flux. The distilled water thereof is very profitably used to heal Scabs, as also foul Ulcerous Sores, and to allay the Inflamations of them: The Juyce of the Leavs or Roots, or the Decoction of them in Vinegar is used as a most effectual Remedy to heal Scabs and running Sores. The Bastard Rubarb hath all the properties of the Monks Rubarb, but more effectual for both inward and outward Diseases. T he Decoction thereof with Vinegar dropped into the Ears, taketh away the pains: gargled in the Mouth, taketh away Toothach, and being drunk healeth the Jaundice.

RUSHES. Although there are many kinds of Rushes, yet I shall only here insist upon those which are best known, and most Medicinal, as the Bulrushes, and other of the soft and smooth kinds; which grow so commo nly in almost every place of this Land, and are so generally noted, that I suppose it needless to trouble you with any Description of them: Briefly then take the Vertues of them as followeth. Vertues and Use. The Seeds of these soft Rushes, saith Dioscor ides and Galen, toasted (saith Pliny) being drunk in Wine and Water, stayeth the Lask and Womens Courses when they come down too abundantly: but it causeth Headach: It provoketh sleep likewise but must be given with caution, lest the party that takes it wa ke not until the Resurrection: Pliny saith, The Root boyled in water to the consumption of one third, helpeth the Cough. Thus you see that Conveniences have their Inconveniences, and Vertue is seldom unaccompanied with some Vices. What I have written conc erning Rushes is to satisfie my Country - mens Question, Are our Rushes good for nothing? Yes, and as good let alone as taken; There are Remedies enough without them for every Diseas, and therfore as the Proverb is, I care not a Rush for them, or rather they will do you as much good as if one had given you a Rush. RYE. This is so well known in all the Countries of this Land, and especially to the Country people who feed much thereon, that if I should describe it, they would presently say, I might well have spared that Labor: Its Vertues follow. Vertues and Use. Rye is more digesting that Wheat; The Bread and the Leaven thereof ripeneth and breaketh Impostumes, Boyls, [EDGENOTE:] Impostumes, Boyls & Swellings, Pains of the Head, Chops of the Hands or Feet. and other Swellings: The Meal of Rye put between a double cloth, and moistned with a little Vinegar, and heated in a Pewter dish, set over a Chafing - dish of coals, and bound fast to the Head while it is hot, both much eas the continual pains of the Head. Mathiolus saith, That the ashes of Rye straw put into Water and suffered therein a day and a night, and the Chops of the Hands or Feet washed therewith, doth heal them. [p. 212] SAFFRON.

It is an Herb of the Sun, and under the Lion, and therfore you need not demand a reason why it strengthens the heart so exceedingly; Let not abov ten grains be given at one time, for if the Sun which is the Fountain of Life, may dazle the Eyes and make them blind, a Cordial being taken in an immoderate quantity may hurt the Heart instead of helping it. It quicken the Brain, for the Sun is exalted in [astrological symbol for Aries] as well as he hath his House in [astrological symbol for Leo] it help Consumption of the Lungs, help difficulty of breathing: it is an excellent thing in Epidemical Diseases, as Pestilences, smal Pox, and Measles: It is a notable expulsi ve Medicine, and a notable Remedy for the yellow Jaundice. My own Opinion is (but I have no Author for it) that Hermodactils is nothing else but the Roots of Saffron dried, and my reason is, that the Roots of all Crocus both white and yellow purge Flegm as Hermodactils do, and if you please to dry the Roots of any Crocus, neither your eye nor your tast shal distinguish it from Hermodactils. SAGE. Our ordinary Garden Sage needeth no Description. Time. It Flowreth in or about July. Vertues and Use. A De coction of the Leavs and Branches of Sage made and drunk, saith Dioscorides provoketh Urine, bringeth down Womens Courses, helpeth to expel the dead Child, and causeth the hairs to become black; It staieth the bleeding of Wounds, and clenseth foul Ulcers o r Sores; The said Decoction made in Wine taketh away the itching ofthe Cods if they be bathed therwith. Agrippa saith, That if Women that cannot conceive by reason of the moist slipperiness of their Wombs shall take a quantity of the Juyce of Sage with a l ittle Salt for four daies before they company with their Husbands, it will help them not only to Conceive, but also to retain the Birth without miscarrying. Orpheus saith, Three spoonfuls of the Juyce of Sage taken fasting with a little Honey, doth present ly stay the spitting or casting up of Blood. For them that are in a consumption, these Pills are much commended. Take of Spicknard and Ginger of each two drams; of the Seed of Sage toasted at the fire, eight drams, of long Pepper twelve drams, all these be ing brought into fine Pouder, put thereto so much Juyce of Sage as may make them into a Mass for Pills, taking a dram of them every morning fasting, and so [EDGENOTE:] Provoke urine, Womens Courses, Expel the Dead Child & Afterbirth, Stanch Bleeding, Clen se Ulcers & sores, Itching of the Cods. likewise at night, drinking a little pure Water after them.

Sage is boyled to bath the B ody or Legs in the Summer time, especially to warm cold Joynts or Sinews troubled with the Palsey or Cramp, and to comfort and strengthen the parts. It is much commended against the Stitch or pains in the side coming of Wind, if the place be fomented warm with the Decoction thereof in Wine, and the Herb after the boyling be laid warm also thereunto.

Also it consumes the Flegmatick Humors, the cold and moist constitution of Winter most usually infects the Body of Man with, and that was the first reason of eating Tansies in the Spring, as last the world being over run with Popery, a Monster called Superstition perks up his head, and as a just Judgment of God obscures the bright beams of Knowledg by his dismal looks (Pysitians seeing the Pope and his Imps selfish they began to be so too) and now forsooth Tansies must be eaten only on Palm and Easter Sundaies, and their neighbor daies; as last Superstion of the time was found out, but the Vertue of the Herb hidden, and now 'tis almost, if not altogether, left off: Surely our Physitians are beh olding to none so much as they are to Monks and Fryars, for want of eating this Herb in Spring, make people sickly in Summer, and that makes work for the Physitian.

The Root is smaller than Bistort, somwhat thick, but blacker without, and not so red within, yet somtimes a little crooked, having many blackish fibres thereat. Place.

This Water thus distilled taken with some Venice Treacle, and the party presently laid to sweat will certainly (with Gods help) expel any Venom or poyson, or the Plague, Feaver, &c. for it is an ingredient of especial respect in all Antidotes or Counterpoysons. There is not found any Root more effectual to [p. 230] help any Flux of the Belly, Stomach, Spleen, or Blood than this, to be taken inwardly, or applied outwardly.

And to put either the Juyce or Pouder of the Root into such Oyntments, Plaisters, and such things that are to be applied to Wounds and Sores: it also dissolveth all Knots, Kernels, and hardness gathered about the Ears, the Throat, and Jaws and the Kings Evil if t he Leaves and Roots be bruised and applied thereto: The same also easeth the pains of the Sciatica or Hip - gout by restraining the sharp Humors that flow thereto. The Juyce of the Leaves and Roots used with a little Vinegar, is also a special Remedy against the running Sores of the Head or other parts, Scabs also and the Itch, or any such eruptions in the Skin proceeding of Salt and sharp Humors. The same also is effectual for the Piles or Hemorrhoids if they be washed and bathed therwith, or with the Distil led water of the Herb and Roots: It is found also helpful to dry up any sharp Rhewm that distilleth from the Head into the Eyes causing, redness, pain, waterings, Itchings, or the like, if a little prepared Tutia, or white Amber be used with the Distilled water hereof: Many Women use this Water as a secret to help themselves and others when they are troubled with the too much flowing of the Whites or Reds, both to drink it, and inject it with a Syringe.

The several kinds hereof are so well known unto almost all people that it is altogether needless to write any Description thereof. Vertues and Use. Dioscorides saith, That to eat the Corns of green Wheat is hurtful to the Stomach, and breedeth Worms. Pliny saith, That the Corns of Wheat toasted upon an Iron Pan and eaten, is a pleasant Remedy for those that are chilled with cold. The Oyl pressed from Wheat between two thick Plates of Iron or Copper heated, healeth all Tetters and Ringworms being used warm, and hereby Galen saith he hath known many to be cured. Mathiolus commendeth the same Oyl to be put into hol low Ulcers to heal them up, and it is also good for Chops in the Hands or Feet, and to make a rugged Skin smooth.

Time. They Flower in June, and the Fruit is ripe in August. Vertues and Use. Doctor Tradition, that grand Introducer of Errors, that Hater of Truth, that Lover of Folly, and that mortal Foe to Doctor Reason, hath taught the common People to use the Leaves and Flowers of this Plant in Mouth Waters, and by long continuance of time hath so grounded it in the Brains of the Vulgar that you cannot beat it out with a Beetle: All Mouth Waters ought to be cooling and drying, but Honeysuckles are clensing, consuming, and digesting, and therefore no waies fit for Inf lamations, Thus Doctor Reason. Again, If you please we will Leave Dr. Reason a while and come to Dr. Experience, a learned Gentleman, and his Brother; Take a Leaf and chew it in your Mouth, and you will quickly find it likelier to cause a sore Mouth or Thr oat than to cure it. Well then, if it be not good for this, What is it good for? 'Tis good for somthing: For God and Nature made nothing in vain: It is an Herb of Jupiter and apropriated to the Lungs, the Coelestial Crab claims Dominion over it; neither is it a Foe to the Lyon: If the Lungs be afflicted by Mercury, this is your Cure: It is fitting a Conserve made of the Flowers of it were kept in every Gentlewomans House; I know no better cure for an Asthma than this; Besides, It takes away the evil of the Spleen, provokes Urine, procures speedy Delivery to Women in Travail, helps Cramps, Convulsions and Palseys, [EDGENOTE:] Lungs afflicted, Asthma, Spleen, provokes Urine & speedy Delivery in Childbirth, Cramps, Convulsions & Palseys, Freckles & Sunburning. and whatsoever griefs comes of cold or stopping: If you please to make use of it in an Oyntment, it will cleer your Skin of Mor - [p. 238] phew, Freckles, and Sunburning, or whatsoever else discolours it, and then the Maids will love it. I have done, wh en I have told you what Authors say, and cavelled a little with them, They say the Flowers are of more effect than the Leaves, and that's true; but they say, The Seeds are of least effect of all: But Dr. Reason told me, That there was a Vital Spirit in eve ry Seed to beget its like; and Dr. Experience told me, That there was a greater heat in a Seed than there was in any other part of a Plant, and withal, That Heat was the Mother of action, and then judg if old Dr. Tradition (who may well be honor'd for his Age, but not for his Goodness) have not so poysoned the World with his Errors before I was born, that it was never well in its wits since, and there is great fear it will die mad. WORMWOOD. Description. Three Wormwoods are familiar with us; One I shall not descrabe, another I shall describe, and the Third be Critical at. And I care not greatly if I begin with the last first."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 Sea Wormwood hath gotten as many Names as vertues (and perhaps one more) Seriphion, Santonicon, Belgicum, Narbonense, Xantomicum, Misnense, and a matter of twenry more, which I will not blot Paper withal: A Papist got the Toy by the end, and he called it Holy Wormwood; and in truth I am of Opinion, Their giving so much holiness to Herbs is the Reason there remains so little in themse lves. The Seed of this Wormwood is that which usually Women give their Children for the Worms: Of all Wormwoods that grow here, this is the weakest; I but Doctors commend it, and Apothecaries sell it, the one must keep his Credit, and the other get Money, and that's the key of the work. The Herb is good for somthing, because God made nothing in vain; Will you give me leave to weigh things in the Ballance of Reason; Then thus, The Seeds of the common Wormwood are far more prevalent than the Seed of this, to expell Worms in Children, or People of ripe age: Of both, some are weak, some are strong. The Seriphian Wormseed is the weakest, & happily may prove to be fittest for weakest Bodies (for it is weak enough in all conscience) Let such as are strong take the common Wormseed, for the other will do but little good. Again, neer the Sea many people live, and Seriphium grows neer them, and therfore is more fitting for their Bodies because nourished by the same Air; and this I had from Dr. Reason. In whose Body Dr. Reason dwels not, dwels Dr. Madness, and he brings in his Brethren, Dr. Ignorance, Dr. Folly, and Dr. Sickness, and these together make way for Dr. Death, and the latter end of that man is worse than the beginning. Pride was the cause of Adam's Fall, Prid e begate a Daughter, I do not know the Father of it unless the Divil, but she christned it, and call'd it Appetite, and sent her Daughter to tast these Wormwoods, who finding this the least bitter, made the sqeamish Wench extol it to the Skies, though the Vertues of it never reached to the middle Region of the Air. Its due praise is this; It is weakest, therefore fitter for weak Bodies, and fitter for those Bodies that dwel neer it than those that live far from it: my reason, is The Sea (as those that live far from it know when they comt neer it) casteth not such a smel as the Land doth: The tender Mercies of God being over all his Works, hath by his eternal Providence planted Seriphium by the Sea side, as a fit Medicine for the Bodies of those that live nee r it. Lastly, It is known to all that know any thing in the Course of Nature, That the Liver delights in sweet things; if so, it abhors bitter, then if your Liver be weak, it is none of the wisest courses to plague it with an Enemy: if the Liver be weak a Consumption follows; Would you know the Reason? 'tis this, A mans Flesh is repaired by Blood, by a third concoction which transmutes Blood into Flesh ('tis well I said [Conction] for if I had said [Boyling] every Cook would have understood me.) The Liver m akes Blood, and if it be weakned that it makes not enough the Flesh wasteth, and why must Flesh alwaies be renewed? Because the eternal God when he made the Creation, made one part of it in continual dependency upon another: And why did he so? Because Hims elf is only Permanent, to reach us, That we should not fix our affections upon what is transitory, but upon what endures for ever. The result of all is this, If the Liver be weak and cannot make Blood enonough (I would have said [Sanguifie] if I had writte n only to Schollers) The Seriphian which is the weakest of Wormwoods is better than the best. I have been Critical enonough (if not too much. Place.

I prove it thus: What delights in Martial places is a Martial Herb, But Wormwood delights in Martial places, (for about Forges and Iron Works you may gather a Cart load of it) Ergo it is a Martial Herb. It is hot and dry in the first degree, Viz. Just as hot as your Blood and not hotter: It remedies the evils Choller can inflict on the Body of man by Sympathy. It helps the evils Venus and her wanton Girls produce, by Antipathy; and it doth somthing else besides; It clenseth the Body of Choller (and who dares say Mars doth no good?) It provokes Urine, helps Surfets, Swellings in the Belly; it causeth an Appetite to meat, because Mars rules the Attractive faculty in Man: The Sun never shone upon a better Herb for the yellow Jau ndice than this is: Why should men cry out so much upon Mars for an Infortune (or Saturn either?) Did God make Creatures to do the Creation a mischief? This Herb testifies that Mars is willing to cure all the Diseases he causes; the truth is, Mars loves no Cowards, nor Saturn Fools, nor I, either. Take the Flowers of Wormwood, Rosemary, and black Thorn, of each a like quantity, half that quantity of Saffron, boyl this in Renish Wine, but put not in the Saffron till it is almost boyled; This is the way to ke ep a Mans Body in health, appointed by Camerarius in his Book intituled, Hortus Medicus, and 'tis a good one too.

Wormwood provokes the Terms. I would willingly tea ch Astrologers, and make them Physitians (if I knew how) for they are most fitting for the Calling, if you will not beleeve me, ask Dr. Hippocrates, and Dr. Galen, a couple of Gentlemen that our Colledg of Physitians keep to vapor with, not to follow. In t his one Herb I shall give the Pattern of a Rule to the Sons of Art, rough cast, yet as neer the Truth as the men of Benjamin could throw a stone; whereby my Brethern of the Society of Astrologers may know by a penny how a shilling is coyned: (as for the Co lledg of Physitians they are too stately to learn, and too proud to continue, They say a Mouse is under the Dominion of the Moon, and that's the reason they feed in the night: The House of the Moon is Cancer: (Rats are of the same nature with Mice but that they are a little bigger.) Mars receives his fall in Cancer, Ergo Wormwood being an Herb of Mars is a present Remedy for the biting of Rats and Mice. Mushroms (I cannot give them the title of Herba, Frutex, or Arbor) are under the Dominion of Saturn (and take them one time with another they do as much harm as good:) if any have poyson'd himself by eating them, Wormwood an Herb of Mars cures him, because Mars is exalted in Capricorn the Hous of Saturn, & this it doth by Sympathy as it did the other by Antip athy. Wheals, Pushes, black & blew Spots coming eitheir by bruises or beatings, Wormwood an Herb of Mars helps becaus Mars (as bad as you love him, & as ill as you hate him) will not break your Head, but he'l give you a Plaister. If he do but teach you to know your selves, his Courtesie is greater than his Discourtesie: The greatest Antipathy between the Planets is between Mars and Venus, one is hot, the other cold, one Diurnal, the other Nocturnal; one dry, the other moist, their Houses are opposite, one M asculine the other Feminine, one publick the other private, one is valiant, the other effeminate, one loves the light, the other hates it, one loves the Field, the other the Sheets; then the Throat is under Venus, the Quinsie lies in the Throat and is an I nflamation there: Venus rules the Throat (it being under Taurus her Sign) Mars eradicates all Diseases in the Throat by his Herbs (of which Wormwood is one) and send them to Aegypt on an errand never to return more; this by Antipathy. The Eyes are under th e Luminaties, the right Eye of a Man, and the left Eye of a Woman, the Sun claims Dominion over: The left Eye of a Man, and the right Eye of a Woman, are the priviledg of the Moon, Wormwood an Herb of Mars cures both; What belongs to the Sun by Sympathy be caus he is exalted in his House; but what belongs to the Moon by Antipathy, because he hath [p. 240] his Fall in hers. Suppose a man be bitten or stung by a martial Creature, imagine a Wasp, a Hornet or Scorpion, Wormwood an Herb of Mars gives you a pres ent cure: Then Mars as Chollerick as he is, hath learned that Patience, to pass by your evil speeches of him, and tells you by my Pen, That he gives you no Affliction but he gives you a Cure; You need not run to Apollo nor Aesculapius; and if he were so Ch ollerick as you make him to be, he would have drawn his Sword for Anger to see the ill conditions of those people that can spy his Vices and not his Vertues.

Astrologers say Mars causeth Scabs and Itch, and the Virgins are angry with him, because wanton Venus told them he deforms their Skin: But quoth Mars, my only desire is they should know themselves; my Herb Wormwood will restore them to the beauty they formerly had, and in that I will not come an inch behind my opposite Venus; for which doth the greatest evil, he that takes away an innate beauty, and when he hath done knows how to restore it again; or she that reaches a company of wanton Lasses to paint their Faces?

I had almost forgotten that Charity thinks no evil, I was once in the Tower and viewe d the Wardrobe, and there was a great many fine Cloathes (I can give them no other title, for I was never neither Linnen or Woollen Draper) yet as brave as they looked, my opinion was, the Moaths might consume them (yea Henry the eighth his Codpiece) Moath s are under the Dominion of Mars, his Herb Wormwood being laid amongst Cloathes will make a Moath scorn to meddle with the Cloath, as much as a Lyon scorns to meddle with a Mouse, or an Eagle a Fly. You say Mars is angry, and 'tis true enough, he is angry with my Country - men for being such Fools to be led by the Noses by a Colledg of Physitians, as they lead Bears to Paris - Garden. Melancholly men cannot endure to be wrong'd in point of good name, and that hath sorely troubled old Saturn, because they called him the greatest Infortune: In the Body of Man he rules the Spleen (and that makes Covetous men so Splenetick.) The poor old man lies crying out of his left side, Father Saturn's angry, Mars comes to him, come Brother, I confess thou art evil spoken of, a nd so am I, thou knowest I have my exaltation in thy House, I'le give him an Herb of mine, Wormwood, to cure the poor man; Saturn consented, but spoke but little, and so Mars cured him by Sympathy. When Mars was free from War (for he loves to be fighting, and is the best friend a Soldier hath) I say when Mars was free from War he called a Councel of War in his own Brain to know how he should do poor sinful man good, (desiring to forget his abuses in being called an Infortune) He musters up his own Forces an d places them in Battalia, Oh, quoth he, why do I hurt a poor silly Man or Woman? His Angel Answers him, Tis because they have offended their God [Look back to Adam] Well, saies Mars, though they speak evil of me, I'le do good to them; Death's cold, my Her bs shall heat them, They are full of ill Humors (else they would never have spoken ill of me) my Herb shall clense them and dry them: They are poor weak Creatures, my Herb shall strengthen them; they are dul witted, my Herb shall fortifie their Apprehensio ns; and yet amongst Astrologers, all this doth not deserve a good word; Oh, the Patience of Mars.

The other day Mars told me he met with Venus, and he asked her what the Reason was that she accused him for abusing Women, he never gave the m the Pox, in the Dispute they fell out, and in anger parted, and Mars told me that his brother Saturn told him, that an Antivenerial Medicine was the best against the Pox. Once a Month he meets with the Moon, Mars is quick enough of speech, and the Moon n ot much behind hand (neither are most Women) The Moon looks much after Children, and Children are much troubled with the Worms, she desired a Medicine of him, he bad her take his own Herb Wormwood: He had no sooner parted with the Moon but he met with Venu s, and she was as drunk as a Bitch, Alas poor Venus quoth he, What, thou a Fortune and be drunk? I'le give thee an Antipathetical Cure, take my Herb Wormwood, thou shalt never get a [p. 241] Surfet by drinking. A poor silly Countryman hath got an Ague an d cannot go about his business, he wishes he had it not, and so do I, but I'le tell him a Remedy whereby he may prevent it. Take the Herb of Mars Wormwood, and if Infortunes will do good what will Fortunes do? Some say the Lungs are under Jupiter, and if t he Lungs, then the breath, and yet a man somtimes gets a stinking breath, and yet Jupiter is a Fortune forsooth; up comes Mars to him, Come Brother Jupiter, thou knowest I sent thee a couple of Trines to thy Houses last night, the one from Aries, and other from Scorpio, give me thy leave by Sympathy to cure the poor man by drinking a draught of Wormwood Beer every morning. The Moon was weak the other day, and she gave a man to terrible mischiefs, a dull Brain, and a weak sight, Mars laies by his Sword and c omes to her, Sister Moon saith he This man hath anger'd thee, but I beseech thee take notice he is but a Fool, prithee be patient, I will with my Herb Wormwood cure him of both Infirmities by Antipathy, for thou knowest, thou and I cannot agree; with that the Moon began to quarrel; Mars (not delighting much in Womens Tongues) went away, and did it whether she would or no. He that reades this and understands what he reades, he hath a Jewel more worth then a Diamond: He that understands it not, is as little fit to give Physick. There lies a Key in these words, which will unlock (if it be turned by a wise hand) the Cabbinet of Physick: I have delivered it so plainly as I durst; 'tis not upon Wormwood only that I wrote, but upon all Plants, Trees, and Herbs: He that understands it not, is unfit (in my Opinion) to give Physick. This shall live when I am dead; and thus I leave it to the World, not caring a Halfpenny whether they like or dislike it. The Grave equals all men, and therefore shall equal me with the Pr inces, until which time the Eternal Providence is over me; then the ill tongue of a pratling Priest, or of one who hath more Tongue than Wit, or more Pride than Honesty, shall never trouble me.

Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 2. Note in what place they most delight to grow in, and gather them there, for Bettony that grows in the shadow is far better than that which grows in the Sun, bec ause it delights in the shadow; so also such Herbs as delight to grow neer the Water, though happily you may find some of them upon dry ground, the Treatise will inform you where every Herb delights to grow. 3. The Leaves of such Herbs as run up to Seed, are not so good when they are in flower as before (some few excepted, the Leaves of which are seldom or never used) in such cases, if through ignorance they were not known, or through negligence forgotten, you had better take the top and the Flower than th e Leaf. 4. Dry them well in the Sun, and not in the shadow as the swinge of Physitians is, for if the Sun draw away the Vertues of Herbs, it must needs do the like by Hay by the same Rule, which the experience of every Country Farmer will explode for a no table piece of non - sense. 5. Such as are Artists in Astrology (and indeed none else are fit to make Physitians) such I advise, let the Planet that governs the Herb be Angular, and the stronger the better, if they can in Herbs of Saturn, let Saturn be in t he Ascendent, in the Herbs of Mars,let Mars be in the Mid - heaven, for in those Houses they delight, let the Moon apply to them by good Aspect, and let her not be in the Houses of their Enemies: If you cannot well stay till she apply to them, let her apply to a Planet of the same Triplicity, if you cannot wait that time neither, let her be with a fixed Star of their Nature. 6. Having well dryed them put them up in brown Papers, sewing the Paper up like a Sack, and press them not too hard together, and keep them in a dry place neer the fire. 7. As for the duration of dryed Herbs, a just time cannot be given, let Authors prate their pleasures: For, First, Such as grow upon dry grounds will keep better than such as grow on moist. Secondly, Such Herbs as are full of Juyce will not keep so long as such as are dryer. Thirdly, Such Herbs as are well dryed will keep longer than such as are ill dried. Yet this I say, by this you may know when they are corrupted, viz. By their loss of colour, or smell, or both, an d if they be corrupted, reason will tell you that they must needs corrupt the Bodies of those people that take them. 8. Gather all Leaves in the hour of that Planet that governs them. Chap. 2. Of Flowers."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 1. The Flower which is the beauty of the Plant, and of none of the least use in Physick, groweth yeerly, and is to be gathered when it is in its prime. 2. As for the time of gathering them, let the Planetary hour, and the Planet that rules the Plant they come of, be observed, as we shewed you in the f oregoing Chapter; as for the time of the day let it be when the Sun shines upon them that so they may be dry, for if you gather either Herbs or Flowers when they are wet or dewy, they will not keep, and this I forgot before. 3. Dry them well in the Sun, a nd keep them in Papers neer the fire, as I shewed you in the foregoing Chapter. 4. So long as they retain their colour and smel they are good, either of them being gone so is the Vertue also. [p. 245] Chap. 3. Of Seeds. 1. The Seed is that part of the Plant which is endewed with a vitall faculty to bring forth its like, and it contains potentially the whol Plant in it. 2. As for place let them be gathered from the plants where they delight to grow. 3. Let them be full ripe when they are gathered, and forget not the Coelestial Harmony before mentioned, for I have found by experience that their Vertues are twice as great at such times than at others: There is an appointed time for every thing under the Sun. 4. When you have gathered them dry them a lit tle, and but a little in the Sun before you lay them up. 5. You need not be so careful of keeping them so neer the fire as the other before mentioned, because they are fuller of Spirit, and therefore not so subject to corrupt. 6. As for the time of their duration 'tis palpable they will keep good many yeers, yet this I say, they are best the first yeer, and this I make appear by a good argument, They will grow soonest the firt yeer they be set, therefore then are they in their prime, and 'tis an easie mat ter to renew them yeerly.

Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 1. Of Roots chuse such as are neither rotten nor wormeaten, but proper in their tast, colour, and smell, such as exceed neither in softness nor hardness. 2. Give me leave to be a little critical against the Vulgar received Opinion, which is, That the Sap falls down into the Root in Autumn, and rises again in Spring, as men go to Bed at night and rise in the morning; and this idle tale of untruth is so grounded in the Heads not only of the Vulgar but also of t he Learned, that a man cannot drive it out by Reason: I pray let such Sap - mongers answer me to this Argument, If the Sap fall into the Root in the fall of the Leaf, and lie there all the Winter, then must the Root grow only in the Winter, as experience wit nesseth, but the Root grows not at all in the Winter, as the same experience teacheth, but only in the Summer. Ergo, If you set an Apple Kernel in the Spring, you shall find the Root to grow to a pretty bigness in that Summer, and be not a whit bigger nex t Spring: What doth the Sap do in the Root all that while? pick straws? For God's sake build not your faith upon Tradition, 'tis as rotten as a rotten Post. The truth is, when the Sun declines from the Tropick of Cancer, the Sap begins to congeal both in Root and Branch, when he toucheth the Tropick of Capricorn and ascends to us ward, it begins to wax thin again, and by degrees as it congealed: But to proceed. 3. The dryer time you gather your Roots in the better they are, for they have the less excremen titious moisture in them. 4. Such Roots as are soft, your best way is to dry in the Sun, or else hang them up in the Chimney corner upon a string; as for such as are hard you may dry them any where. 5. Such Roots as are great will keep longer than such a s are small, yet most of them will keep a yeer. 6. Such Roots as are soft it is your best way to keep them alwaies neer the fire, and take this general Rule, If in Winter time you find any of your Roots, Herbs or Flowers begin to grow moist, as many times you shall, especially in the Winter time (for 'tis your best way to look to them once a month) dry them by a very gentle fire, or if you can with convenience keep them neer the fire, you may save your self the labor. 7. It is in vain to dry such Roots as may commonly be had, as Parsly, Fennel, Plantane &c. but gather them only for present need. Chap.5. Of Barks. 1. Barks which Physitians use in Mediscines are these sorts, of Fruits, of Roots, of Boughs."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 2. The Barks of Fruits is to be taken when the F ruit is full ripe, as Orrenges, Lemmons, &c. but because I have nothing to do with Exoticks here, I shall pass them without any more words. 3. The Barks of Trees are best gathered in the Spring, if it be of great Trees, as Oaks or the like, because then t hey come easiest off, and so you may dry them if you please, but indeed your best way is to gather all Barks only for present use. 4. As for the Bark of Roots, 'tis this, and thus to be gotten, Take the Roots of such Herbs as have a pith in them, as Parsl y, Fennel, &c. slit them in the middle, and when you have taken out the pith (which you may easily and quickly do) that which remains is called (though somthing improperly) the Bark and indeed is only to be used. [p. 246] Chap. 6. Of Juyces. 1. Juyces are to be pressed out of Herbs when they are yong and tender, and also out of some Stalks, and tender tops of Herbs and Plants, and also out of some Flowers. 2. Having gathered your Herb you would preserve the Juyce of, when it is very dry (for otherwise your Juyce will not be worth a Button) bruise it very wel in a stone Mortar with a wooden Pestle, then having put it into a Canvas Bag (the Herb I mean, not the Mortar for that will yield but little Juyce) press it hard in a press, then take the Juyce and clarifie it. 3. The manner of clarifying of it is this, put it into a Pipkin or Skillet, or some such thing and set it over the fire, and when the Scum riseth, take it off, let it stand over the fire till no more Scum rise, then have you your Juyce clarif ied, cast away the Scum as a thing of no use. SECT. 2. The way of making and keeping all Ne - cessary Compounds. Chap. 1. Of Distilled Waters. Hitherto we have spoken of Medicines which consist in their own Nature, which Authors vulgarly call Simples, though somthing improperly, for indeed and in truth, nothing is Simple but the pure Elements; all things else are compounded of them: We come now to                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

The vulgar way of Distillation which people use, because they know no better, is in a Peuter Still, and although Distilled Waters are the weakest of all Artificial Medicines, and good for little unless fo r mixtures of other Medicines, yet this way distilled they are weaker by many degrees than they would be, were they distilled in Sand: If I thought it not impossible to teach you the way of distilling in Sand by writing, I would attempt it. 5. When you ha ve distilled your Water put it into a Glass, and having bound the top of it over with a Paper pricked full of holes, that so the excrementitious and fiery vapors may exhale (which indeed are they that cause that setling in distilled Waters called the Mothe r, which corrupts the Waters and might this way be prevented) cover it close and keep it for your use. 6. Stopping distilled Waters with a Cork makes them musty, and so will a Paper also if it do but touch the Water, your best way then [p. 247] is to st op them with a Bladder, being first wet in Water, and bound over the top of the Glass. Such cold Waters as are distilled in a Peuter Still (if well kept) will endure a yeer, such as are distilled in Sand, as they are twice as strong, so will they endure t wice as long. Chap. 2. Of Syrups. 1. A Syrup is a Medicine of a Liquid form, composed of Infusion, Decoction and Juyce; and 1. for the more grateful tast, 2. for the better keeping of it, with a certain quantity of Honey or Sugar; hereafter mentioned bo iled to the thickness of new Honey. 2. You see at the first view then that this Aphorism devides it self into three Branches, which deserve severally to be treated of, viz."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 1. Syrups made by Infusion. 2. Syrups made by Decoction. 3. Syrups made by Juyce. Of each of these (for your Instruction sake kind Country men and women) I speak a word, or two or three apart. First, Syrups made by Infusion are usually made of Flowers, and of such Flowers, as soon lose both colour and strength by boyling, as Roses, V iolets, Peach - Flowers &c. my Translation of the London Dispensatory will instruct you in the rest: They are thus made, having picked your Flowers clean, to every pound of them ad three pound (or three pints, which you will for it is all one) of Spring Wate r made boyling hot by the fire, first put your Flowers in a Peuter Pot with a cover, then powr the Water to them, then shutting the Pot, let it stand by the fire to keep hot twelve hours, then strain it out (in such Syrups as purge, as Damask Roses, Peach - Flowers, &c. the usual and indeed the best way is to repeat this Infusion, adding fresh Flowers to the same Liquor diverse times that so it may be the stronger) having strained it out, put the Infusion into a Peuter Bason, or an Earthen one well glassed, a nd to every pint of it, ad two pound of fine Sugar, which being only melted over the fire without boyling, and scummed, will produce you the Syrup you desire. Secondly, Syrups made by Decoction are usually used of Compounds yet may any Simple Herb be thus converted into Syrup; Take the Herb, Root, or Flower you would make into Syrup and bruise it a little, then boyl it in a convenient quantity of Spring Water, the more water you boyl it in the weaker will it be, a handful of the Herb, Root, &c. is a conven ient quantity for a pint of Water; boyl it till half the water be consumed, then let it stand till it be almost cold, and strain it (being almost cold) through a woollen cloth, letting it run out at leisure without pressing, to every pint of this Decoction ad one pound of Sugar and boyl it over the fire till it come to a Syrup, which you may know if you now and then cool a little of it in a spoon, scum it all the while it boyls, and when it is sufficiently boyled, whilst it is hot strain it again through a woollen cloth, but press it not; thus have you the Syrup perfected. Thirdly, Syrups made of Juyces are usually made of such Herbs as are full of Juyce, and indeed they are better made into a Syrup this way than any other; the Operation is thus, having bea ten the Herb in a stone Mortar with a wooden Pestle, press out the Juyce and clarifie it as you were taught before in the Juyces, then let the Juyce boyl away till a quarter of it (or neer upon) be consumed, to a pint of this ad a pound of Sugar, and boyl it to a Syrup, alwaies scumming it, and when it is boyled enough, strain it through a woollen cloth as we taught you before, and keep it for your use. 3. If you make Syrups of Roots that are any thing hard, as Parsley, Fennel, and grass Roots &c. when you have bruised them, lay them in steep some time in that Water which you intend to boyl them in, hot, so will the Vertue the better come out.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 4. Keep your Syrups either in Glasses or stone Pots, and stop them not with Cork, nor Bladder, unless you would ha ve the Glass break and the Syrup lost; and as many Opinions as there are in this Nation, I suppose there are but few or none of this, only bind a Paper about the Mouth. 5. All Syrups if well made will continue a yeer, with some advantage yet of all, such as are made by Infusion keep the least while. Chap. 3. Of Juleps. 1. Juleps were first invented as I suppose in Arabia, and my reason is because the word Juleb is an Arabick word. 2. It signifies only a pleasant Potion, and was vulgarly used (by such a s were sick and wanted help, or such as were in health, and wanted no money) to quench thirst. 3. Now a daies 'tis commonly used, [p. 248] 1. To prepare the Body for Purgation. 2. To open Obstructions and the Pores. 3. To digest tough Humors. 4. To qual ifie hot distempers &c. 4. It is thus made (I mean Simple Juleps for I have nothing to say to Compounds here; all Compounds have as many several Idea's as men have crotchets in their Brain) I say Simple Juleps are thus made: Take a pint of such distilled Water as conduceth to the cure of your distemper, which this Treatise will plentifully furnish you withal, to which add two ounces of Syrup conducing to the same effect (I shall give you Rules for it in the last Chapter) mix them together and drink a draug ht of it at your pleasure; If you love tart things ad ten drops of Oyl of Vitriol to your pint and shake it together, and it will have a fine grateful tast. 5. All Juleps are made for present use, and therefore it is in vain to speak of their duration. C hap. 4. Of Decoctions. 1. All the difference between Decoctions and Syrups made by Decoction is this, Syrups are made to keep, Decoctions only for present use, for you can hardly keep a Decoction a week at any time, if the weather be hot, not half so lon g."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 2. Decoctions are made of Leaves, Roots, Flowers, Seeds, Fruits, or Barks, conducing to the cure of the Disease you make them for; in the same manner are they made as we shewed you in Syrups. 3. Decoctions made with Wine last longer than such as are m ade with Water, and if you take your Decoction to clense the passages of Urine, or open Obstructions, your best way is to make it with white Wine instead of Water, because that is most penetrating. 4. Decoctions are of most use in such Diseases as lie in the Passages of the Body, as the Stomach, Bowels, Kidneys, Passages of Urine, and Bladder, because Decoctions pass quicker to those places than any other form of Medicines. 5. If you will sweeten your Decoction with Sugar, or any Syrup fit for the occasio n you take it for which is better, you may and no harm done. 6. If in a Decoction you boyl both Roots, Herbs, Flowers, and Seeds together, let the Roots boyl a good while first, because they retain their Vertue longest, then the next in order by the same Rule; viz. 1. the Barks, 2. the Herbs, 3. the Seeds, 4. the Flowers, 5. the Spices if you put any in, because their vertue comes soonest out. 7. Such things as by boyling cause sliminess to a Decoction, as Figs, Quince Seeds, Linseed &c. your best way is , after you have bruised then, to tie them up in a linnen rag, as you tie up a Calves Brains, and so boyl them. 8. Keep all Decoctions in a Glass close stopped, and in the cooler place you keep them, the longer will they last ere they be sowr. Lastly, Th e usual Dose to be given at one time, is usually two, three, four, or five ounces, according to the age and strength of the Patient, the season of the yeer, the strength of the Medicine, and the quality of the Disease. Chap. 5. Of Oyles. 1. Oyl Olive, w hich is commonly known by the name of Sallet Oyl, I suppose because it is usually eaten with Sallets by them that love it; If it be pressed out of ripe Olives, according to Galen is temperate, and exceeds in no one quality. 2. Of Oyls, some are Simple, an d some are Compound. 3. Simple Oyuls are such as are made of Fruits or Seeds, by expression, as Oyl of sweet and bitter Almonds, Linseed, and Rapeseed Oyl &c. of which see my Dispensatory.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 4. Compound Oyls are made of Oyl of Olives and other Simples, ima gine Herbs, Flowers, Roots, &c. 5. The way of making them is this, having bruised the Herbs or Flowers you would make your Oyl of, put them in an Earthen pot, and to two or three handfuls of them, powr a pint of Oyl, cover the pot with a paper, and set it in the Sun, about a Fortnight or less according as the Sun is in hotness; then having warmed it very well by the fire, press out the Herbs &c. very hard in a press, and ad as many more Herbs to the same Oyl, bruised (the Herbs I mean not the Oyl in like m anner, set them in the Sun as before, the oftner you repeat this the stronger will your Oyl be; at last when you conceive it strong enough, boyl both Herbs and Oyl together till the Juyce be consumed which you may know by its leaving its bubling, and the H erbs will be crisp, then strain it, whilst it is hot, and keep it in a stone or Glass Vessel for your use. 6. As for Chymical Oyls, I have nothing to say in this Treatise. 7. The General use of these Oyls is for pain in the Limbs, roughness of the Skin, the Itch &c. as also for Oyntments and Plaisters. 8. If you have occasion to use it for Wounds or Ulcers, in two ounces of Oyl, dissolve half an ounce of Turpentine, the heat of the fire will quickly do it, for Oyl it self is offensive to Wounds, and the Turpentine qualifies it. [p. 249] Chap. 6. Of Electuaries. Physitians make more a quoil than needs behalf about Electuaries: I shall prescribe but one general way of making them up, as for the Ingredients you may vary them as you please, and according as you find occassion by the last Chapter. 1. That you may make Electuaries when you need them, it is requisite that you keep alwaies Herbs, Roots, Seeds, Flowers &c. ready dried in your House, that so you may be in readiness to beat them into pouder when you need them. 2. Your better way is to keep them whol than beaten, for being beaten they are the more subject to lose their strength, because the Air soon penetrates them. 3. If they be not dry enough to beat into pouder when you need them, dry them by a gentle fire till they are so. 4. Having beaten them, sift them through a fine Tiffany Searce, that so there may be no great pieces found in your Electuary."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 5. To an ounce of your Pouder, ad three ounces of clarified Honey, this quantity I hold to be s ufficient; I confess Authors differ about it: If you would make more or less Electuary, vary your proportions accordingly. 6. Mix them well together in a Mortar, and take this for a truth, you cannot mix them too much. 7. The way to clarifie Honey is to set it over the fire in a convenient vessel till the scum arise, and when the scum is taken off it is clarified. 8. The usual Dose of Cordial Electuaries is from half a dram to two drams, of purging Electuaries from half an ounce to an ounce. 9. The mann er of keeping them is in a pot. 10. The time of taking them, is either in the morning fasting, and fasting an hour after them, or a night going to bed three or four hours after supper. Chap. 7. Of Conserves. 1. The way of making Conserves is two - fold, one of Herbs and Flowers, and the other of Fruits. 2. Conserves of Herbs and Flowers are thus made, If you make your Conserves of Herbs, as of Scurvy - grass, Wormwood, Rue, or the like, take only the Leaves and tender tops (for you may beat your heart out before you can beat the Stalks small) and having beaten them, waigh them, and to everie pound of them ad three pound of Sugar, beat them verie well together in a Mortar, you cannot beat them too much. 3. Conserves of Fruits, as of Barberries, Sloes, and t he like is thus made; First scald the Fruit, then rub the pulp through a thick hair Sieve made for the purpose, called a pulping Sieve, you may do it for a need with the back of a Spoon, then take this Pulp thus drawn, and ad to it its waight of Sugar and no more, put it in a Peuter Vessel, and over a Charcoal fire stir it up and down till the Sugar be melted, and your Conserve is made. 4. Thus have you the way of making Conserves, the way of keeping of them is in Earthen pots. 5. The Dose is usually the quantity of a Nutmeg at a time morning and evening, or (unless they be purging) when you please. 6. Of Conserves, some keep many yeers, as Conserves of Roses, others but a yeer, as Conserves of Borrage, Bugloss, Cowslips and the like.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 7. Have a care of t he working of some Conserves presently after they are made, look to them once a day and stir them about; Conserves of Borrage, Bugloss, and Wormwood have gotten an excellent faculty at that sport. 8. You may know when your Conserves are almost spoiled by this, you shall find a hard crust at top with little holes in it as though Worms had been eating there. Chap. 8. Of Preserves. Of Preserves are sundry sorts, and the Operations of all being somthing different we will handle them all apart. There are pr eserved with Sugar, 1 Flowers. 2 Fruits. 3 Roots. 4 Barks. 1. Flowers are but very seldom preserved, I never saw any that I remember save only Cowslip Flowers, and that was a great fashion in Sussex when I was a boy; It is thus done, first, take a flat G lass, we call them jarr Glasses, strew in a lain of fine Sugar, on that a lain of Flowers, on that another lain of Sugar, on that another lain of Flowers, do so til your Glass be full, then tie it over with a paper, and in a little time you shall have very excellent and pleasant Preserves. There is another way of Preserving Flowers, namely with Vinegar and Salt, as they pickle Capers and Broom Buds, but because I have little skill in it my self I canot teach you. [p. 205, i.e. 250] 2. Fruits, as Quinces a nd the like are preserved two waies. First, Boyl them well in Water, and then pulp them through a Sieve as we shewed you before; then with the like quantity of Sugar boyl the Water they were boyled in to a Syrup, viz. a pound of Sugar to a pint of Liquor, to every pound of this Syrup ad four ounces of the Pulp, then boyl it with a very gentle fire to the right consistence, which you may easily know if you drop a drop of it upon a Trencher, if it be enough it will not stick to your fingers when it is cold. Secondly, Another way to preserve Fruits is this, First pare off the rind, then cut them in halves and take out the Core, then boyl them in Water till they are soft, If you know when Beef is boyled enough you may easily know when they are; then boyl the W ater with its like waight of Sugar into a Syrup, put the Syrup into a Pot, and put the boyled Fruit as whol as you left it when you cut it into it, and let it so remain till you have occasion to use it."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 3. Roots are thus preserved, First, scrape them very clean, and clense them from the Pith if they have any, for some Roots have not, as Eringo and the like, boyl them in Water till they be soft as we shew you before in the Fruits, then boyl the Water you boyled the Roots into a Syrup as we shewed you before , then keep the Roots whol in the Syrup till you use them. 4. As for Barks we have but few come to our hands to be done, and those of those few that I can remember, are Orrenges, Lemmons, Citrons, and the outer Bark of Walnuts which grows without the Shel l, for the Shels themselves would make but scurvy Preserves, there be they I can remember, if there be any more put them into the number. The way of Preserving these is not all one in Authors, for some are bitter, some are not, such as are bitter, say Aut hors, must be soaked in warm Water, often times changed till their bitter tast be fled, but I like not this way, and my reason is, because I doubt when their bitterness is gone, so is their Vertues also; I shall then prescribe one commmon way, namely the s ame with the former, viz. First boyl them whol till they be soft, then make a Syrup with Sugar and the Liquor you boyled them in, and keep the Barks in the Syrup. 5. They are kept in Glasses or glassed Pots. 6. The preserved Flowers will keep a yeer if y ou can forbear eating of them, the Roots and Barke much longer. 7. This Art was plainly and cleerly at first invented for delicacy, yet came afterwards to be of excellent use in Physick; For, First, Hereby Medicines are made pleasant for sick and queazy Stomachs, which else would loath them. 2. Hereby they are preserved from decaying a long time. Chap. 9. Of Lohochs. 1. That which the Arabians call Lohoch, and the Greeks Eclegma, the Latins call Linetus, and in plain English, signifies nothing else bu t a thing to be licked up. 2. Their first invention was to prevent and remedy afflictions of the Breast and Lungs, to clense the Lungs of Flegm, and make it fit to be cast out. 3. They are in Body thicker than a Syrup, and not so thick as an Electuary. 4. The manner of taking them is often to take a little with a Liquoris stick and let it go down at leisure.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 5. They are easily thus made, make a Decoction of any pectoral Herbs, the Treatise will furnish you with enough, and when you have strained it, wit h twise its waight of Honey or Sugar, boyl it to a Lohoch; If you are molested with tough Flegm, Honey is better than Sugar, and if you ad a little Vinegar to it you will do well, if not, I hold Sugar to be better than Honey. 6. It is kept in Pots and wil l a yeer and longer. 7. Its use is excellent for roughness of the Windpipe, Inflamations of the Lungs, Ulcers in the Lungs, difficultie of Breath, Asthmaes, Coughs and distillation of Humors. Chap. 10. Of Oyntments. 1. Various are the waies of making O yntments which Authors have left to posteritie, which I shall omit and quote one which is easiest to be made, and therefore most beneficial to people that are ignorant in Physick, for whose sakes I write this; It is thus done. Bruise those Herbs, Flowers, or Roots you would make an Oyntment of, and to two handfuls of your bruised Herbs ad a pound of Hogs Grease tryed, or clensed from the skins, beat them very well together in a stone Mortar with a wooden Pestle, then put it in a stone Pot (the Herbs and Gr ease I mean, not the Mortar) cover it with a paper, and set it either in the Sun or some other warm place three, four, or fivs daies, that it may melt, then take it out and boyl it a little, then whilst it is hot, strain it out, pressing it out very hard i n a Press, to this Grease ad as many more Herbs bruised as before, let them stand in like man - [p. 251] ner as long, then boyl them as you did the former, if you think your Oyntment be not strong enough you may do it the third and fourth time; yet this I tell you, the fuller of Juyce your Herbs are, the sooner will your Oyntment be strong, the last time you boyl it, boyl it so long till your Herbs be crisp and the Juyce consumed, then strain it, pressing it hard in a Press, and to every pound of Oyntment, ad two ounces of Turpentine, and as much Wax, because Grease is offensive to Wounds as well as Oyl, 2. Oyntments are vulgarly known to be kept in Pots, and will last above a yeer, above two yeer. Chap. 11. Of Plaisters."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 1. The Greeks made their Plaist ers of diverse Simples and put Mettals in most of them if not in all, for having reduced their Mettals into Pouder they mixed them with that fatty substance, whereof the rest of the Plaister consisted. whilst it was yet hot, continually stirring it up and down lest it should sink to the bottom, so they continually stirred it till it was stiff, then they made it up in rolls, which when they need for use they could melt by the fire again. 2. The Arabians made up theirs wih Meals, Oyl, and Fat, which needed n ot so long boyling. 3. The Greeks Emplasters consisted of these Ingredients, Mettals, Stones, diverse sorts of Earths, Feces, Juyces, Liquoiris, Seeds, Roots, Herbs, Excrements of Creatures, Wax, Rozin, Gums. Chap. 12. Of Pultisses. 1. Pultisses are th ose kind of things which the Latins call Cataplasmata, and our learned Fellows that if they can read English thats all, call them Cataplasms, because 'tis a crabbed word few understand; it is indeed a very fine kind of Medicine to ripen Sores, 2. They are made of Herbs and Roots fitted to the Disease and Member afflicted, being chopped smal and boyled in Water almost to a Jelly, then by adding a little Barley Meal or Meal of Lupines, and a little Oyl or rough Sheep Suet, which I hold to be better, spread u pon a cloath and applied to the grieved place. 3. Their use is to ease pains, to break Sores, to cool Inflamations, to dissolve hardness, to ease the Spleen, to concoct Humors, to dissipate Swellings. 4. I beseech you take this Caution along with you, Us e no Pultissees (if you can help it) that are of a heating Nature; before you have first clensed the Body, because they are subject to draw the Humors to them from every part of the Body. Chap. 13. Of Troches. 1. The Latins call them Placentule, or litt le Cakes (and you might have seen what the Greeks call them too, had not the last Edition of my London Dispensatory been so hellishly printed, that's all the Commonwealth gets by one Stationer's printing anothers Coppies, viz. To plague the Country with fa lse Prints, and disgrace the Author) [Greek script] they are usually little round flat Cakes, or you may make them square if you will. 2. Their first invention was, that Pouders being so kept might resist the intromission of Air and so endure pure the lon ger.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 3. Besides, they are the easier carried in the Pockets of such as travel; many a man (for example) is forced to travel whose Stomach is too cold, or at least not so hot as it should be, which is most proper, for the Stomach is never cold till a man b e dead; in such a case 'tis better to carry Troches of Wormwood or of Galanga, in a Paper in his Pocket and more convenient behalf than to lug a Gall - pot along with him. 4. They are thus made, At night when you go to bed, take two drams of fine Gum Tragac anth, put it into a Gally - pot, and put half a quarter of a pint of any distilled Water fitting the purpose you would make your Troches for, to it, cover it, and the next morning you shall find it in such a Jelly as Physitians call Mussilage, with this you may (with a little pains taking) make any Pouder into Past, and that Past into little Cakes called Troches. 5. Having made them, dry them well in the shadow and keep them in a Pot for your use. Chap. 14. Of Pills. 1. They are called Pilulae because the y resemble little Balls, the Greeks call them Catapotia. 2. It is the Opinion of Modern Physitians that this way of making up Medicines was invented only to deceive the Pallat, that so by swallowing them down whol, the bitterness of the medicine might not be perceived or at [p. 242, i.e. 252] least it might not be unsufferable, and indeed most of their Pills though not all are very bitter. 3. I am of a clean contrary Opinion to this, I rather think they were done up in this hard form that so they might be the longer in digesting, and my Opinion is grounded upon Reason too, not upon Fancy nor Hear - say; The first invention of Pills was to purge the Head, now as I told you before, such Infirmities as lay neer the passages, were best removed by Decoctions, b ecause they pass to the grieved part soonest, so here, if the infirmity lie in the Head or any other remote part, the best way is to use Pills, because they are longer in digestion, and therefore the better able to call the offending Humor to them. 4. If I should tell you here a long Tale of Medicines working by Sympathy and Antipathy, you would not understand a word of it, they that are fit to make Physitians may find it in the Treatise: All Modern Physitians know not what belonged to a Sympathetical Cure , no more than a Cookoo knows what belongs to Flats and Sharps in Musick, but follow the vulgar road, and call it a hidden quality because 'tis hid from the Eyes of Dunces, and"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 indeed none but Astrologers can give a reason of it, and Physick without Reason is like a Pudding without Fat. 5. The way to make Pills is very easie, for with the help of a Pestle and Mortar and little diligence, you may make any Pouder into PiIls, either with Syrup or the Jelly I told you of before. Chap. ult. The way of mixing Medicines according to the Cause of the Disease and part of the Body afflicted. This being indeed the Key of the Work, I shall be somthing, the more dilligent in it: I shall deliver my self thus; 1. To the Vulgar. 2. To such as study Astrology, or such a s study Physick Astrologically. First to the Vulgar: Kind souls I am sorry it hath been your hard mishap to have been so long trained in such Egyptian darkness, even darkness which to your sorrows may be felt; the vulgar road of Physick is not my practice , and I am therefore the more unfit to give you advice; and I have now published a little Book which will fully instruct you not only in the knowledg of your own Bodies but also in fit Medicines to remedy each part of it when afflicted, mean season take th ese few Rules to stay your Stomachs. 1. With the Disease regard the Cause and part of the Body afflicted, for example, suppose a Woman be subect to miscarry through wind, thus do, 1. Look [Abortion] in the Table of Diseases, and you shall be directed by that how many Herbs prevent miscarriage. 2. Look [Wind] in the same Table, and you shall see how many of those Herbs expell wind. These are the Herbs Medicinal for your Grief. 2. In all Diseases strengthen the part of the Body afflicted. 3. In mixed Di seases there lies some difficulty, for somtimes two parts of the Body are afflicted with contrary Humors the one to the other, somtimes one part is afflicted with two contrary Humors, as somtimes the Liver is afflicted with Choller and Water, as when a man hath both a Dropsie and the yellow Jaundice, and this is usually mortal. In the former, suppose the Brain be too cold and moist, and the Liver too hot and dry, thus do, 1. Keep your Head outwardly warm.                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 2. Accustom your self to smell of hot Herbs. 3. Take a Pill that heats the Head at night going to bed. 4. In the morning take a Decoction that cools the Liver, for that quickly passeth the Stomach, and is at the Liver immediately. You must not think (Courteous People) that I can spend time to give you examples of all Diseases, these are enough to let you see so much light as you without Art are able to received, If I should set you to look upon the Sun I should dazle your eyes and make you blind. Secondly, To such as study Astrology (who are the only men I know that are fit to study Physick, Physick without Astrology, being like a Lamp without Oyl) you are men I exceedingly respect, and such Documents as my Brain can give you at present (being absent from my study) I shall give you, and an example to s hew the proof of them. 1. Fortifie the Body with Herbs of the Nature of the lord of the Ascendent, 'tis no matter whether he be a Fortune or an Infortune in this case. 2. Let your Medicine be somthing Antipathetical to the lord of the sixth. 3. Let your Medicine be somthing of the Nature of the Sign ascending. 4. If the lord of the Tenth be strong, make use of his Medicines. 5. If this cannot well be, make use of the Medicines of the light of time. 6. Be sure alwaies fortifie the grieved part of the b ody by Sympathetical Remedies. [p. 253] 7. Regard the Heart, keep that upon the Wheels because the Sun is the Fountain of Life, and therefore those Universal Remedies Aurum potabile, and the Phylosophers Stone, cure all Diseases by only fortifying the He art. But that this may appear unto you as cleer as the Sun when he is upon the Meridian, I here quote you an Example, which I performed when I was as far off from my study as I am now, yet am I not ashamed the world should see how much or little of my Les son I have learned without Book. On July, 25. 1651. there came a Letter to me out of Bedfordhsire, from a Gentleman (at that time) altogether to me unknown, though since well known, who was a Student both in Astrologie and Physick: The words which are the se; Mr. Culpeper,"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich. Culpeper, Gent. Student in Physick and As trologie 1616 165 4 My Love remembred unto you, although I know you not by face; yet because I do much respect that pretty little Lark, you so lately let fly into the world, which you call Semeiotica Uranica, which I have lately taken into my Cage; I am th erefore imboldned to write unto you in the behalf of a Neighbors Wife, who is taken with a very violent Disease which began in the lowr parts of her Body, but is now ascended upwards, and tormenteth her in her Breast, Throat, Tongue, and Lips: This Disease took possession of her (as she relateth to me) about a fortnight before Michaelmas last, but the certain day and hour she is not able to nominate; she sent for me, and enquired whether she were not under an ill Tongue or not, or of what nature the Disease was: I have sent you the enclosed Scheam, I could find but one testimony of Fascination or Witchcraft, which was one Sign possessing the Cusps of the Twelfth and First Houses, which to me holds forth no more than a strong suspition of it by the Querent; H owever I am confident there is a natural Disease which hurts much, because the Lord of the Sixt, which usually gives signification of Natural Diseases, is now placed in the Ascendent; but at present I forbear to make any large discours of mine own Opinions , being desirous that you would endeavor your Skill in this Cure, for there is not a Doctor of them all far or near that have been so skilful to find out the Disease, much less to effect the Cure. Sr. I expect your Answer; mean time bid you farewel, and re main yours in Affection, &c. The inclosed Scheam. [ Image of Scheme ] [p. 254] My Answer to the Letter, was to this effect. Sir, I received yours, July 25. wherein I find y our enclosed Scheam, and (I suppose) the nature of the Disease, and have sent you such an Answer as I could, being far from my Study, which I entreat you to take in good part, being Fastinanti calamo Conscripta. As for the ignorance of your Country Doctors , they wanting the true Judgment of Astrology, is to me no waies admirable; I perceive you to be a yong man by the time of your Genesis, which you also sent me, beware whom you trust with that, he that knows your Nativity knows when ill Directions operate, and if he be an Enemy, knows when to do you a mischief; If Cecil had not had Essex his Nativity, he had never gotten his Head off, but to instruct you being a yong Student, I shall give you my Judgment Methodically. Diacritica. You say you can find no A rguments of Witchcraft, but only one Sign possessing the Cusps of both Twelth and Ascendent, but if you had regarded the Propinquity of Venus to Saturn you would have made another of that, yet do not I think she is bewitched, because of other more prevalen t testimonies; the Moon passing from the beams of Mars to the beams of Venus may seem to give some suspition of Honesty, and the Disease to come that way, which is encreased by Mars his being in the Ascendent in Scorpio, and the Dragons Tail upon the Cusp, yet I can hardly beleeve this, for Cauda in a humane Sign                                                                                                                                                 "},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

Venus, Lady of the Twelfth, and Ascendent, and Kigth, shews her alwaies to be her own foe in respect of Health; and truly I beleeve the original of the Disease was a Surfet either by eating moist Fruits, or else by catching wet in travelling; Venus with Saturn who is in square to the Ascendent troubles her Breast with tough Flegm and Melancholly: Besides, there being a most forcible reception between the Moon and Venus from fruitful Signs, I question whether she be not with Child or not, the Moon being in the fifth Hou se, Mars is lord of the Disease, really in the Scorpion, and accidentally in the Ascendent, together with Aries on the sixt, shew the Disease keeps his Court in the Womb, and accidentaly afflicts the Head from thence, so that heat of the Womb must needs be cause of the present distemper, and Mars in a moist Sign in the first neer the second may well denote heat, and breaking out about her Face and Throat. Prognostica. Whether she be curable or not, or how or when the Disease will end is our next Point; Tr uly I can see no danger of death the Moon being strong in her hain, and applying by Trine with a strong reception to the Lady of the Ascendent; yet this is certain, Mars strong in a fixed Sign will maintain the Disease stoutly, her hopes will be but smal w hen Venus comes to the Body of Saturn, viz. August 2. for she will be overpressed with Melancholly, the time I suppose of her Cure may be (if good courses be taken) when Mars leaves the Sign he is in, and comes to the place where the Body of Jupiter is, or at least then it may turn to another Disease more propitious; the Sun strong in the Tenth shews she may be cured by Medicine, and he being exalted in the seventh, and caput there, I do not know but you are as likely a man to do it as any. Indications Cur ative. It is confessed here that the Sun being exceeding strong in the tenth House, should naturally signifie the curative Medicine, and as true that the evils of Mars, viz. heat in the Womb, and a salt humor in the blood ought to be removed before you me ddle with the tough Flegm in the Breast, but yet seeing the Disease seems rather to participate of offending heat than any other Simple quality, you must have a care of hot Medicines lest you go about ignem oleo extinguere, the Medicines must 1. be cool, 2 . strengthning the Womb, 3. repressing the vapors, 4. of the nature of Sol and Venus.

To this intent, I first commend unto you stinking Arrach, a pattern whereof I have sent you enclosed, you may find it upon Dunghils, especially such as ar e made of Horse dung: It is cold and moist, an Herb of Venus in the Scorpion; Also Ros Solis an Herb of the Sun and under the Coelestial Crab, may do very well, and the better because Venus is in Cancer: It grows upon Bogs in untilled places, and is in flo wer about this time, it grows very low, with roundish green leaves full of red hairs, and is fullest of dew when the Sun is hottest, whence it took its name; to these you may ad Tansie, which I take to be an Herb of Venus in Libra, and Lettice if you pleas e which is an Herb of the Moon, Mars"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Culpeper Index Of Herbs By Nich.

Thus remain yours, &c. I the rather chose this Figure to judg of, because none should have just occasion to say of us A stologers that we do as Physitians vulgar practice is, when they judg of Piss; first pump what they can out of the Querent, and then judg by his words; of which I will rehearse you one merry story, and so I will conclude the Book. A Woman whose Husband ha d bruised himself, took his Water, and away to the Doctor trots she; the Doctor takes the Piss and shakes it about, How long hath this party been ill (saith he) Sr. saith the Woman, He hath been ill these two daies, This is a mans water quoth the Doctor pr esently, this he learned by the word HE; then looking on the water he spied blood in it, the man hath had a bruise saith he, I indeed saith the woman, my Husband fell down a pair of stairs backwards, then the Doctor knew well enough that what came first to danger must needs be his back and shoulders, said, the Bruise lay there; the woman she admired at the Doctors skil, and told him, that if he could tell her one thing more she would account him the ablest Physitian in Europe; well, what was that? How many Stairs her Husband fell down, this was a hard Question indeed, able to puzle a stronger Brain than Mr. Doctor had, to pumping goes he, and having taken the Urinal and given it a shake or two, enquires whereabout she lived, and knowing well the place, and t hat the Houses thereabouts were but low built Houses, made answer (after another view of the urine for fashion sake) that probably he might fall down some seven or eight stairs; ah, quoth the woman, now I see you know nothing, my Husband fell down thirty; thirthy! quoth the Doctor, and snatching up the Urinal, is here all the water saith he? no saith the woman, I spilt some in putting of it in, look you there quoth Mr. Doctor, there were all the other stairs spilt. Yet mistake me not, I do not deny but suc h whose daily experience is to judg Waters, and usually judg a hundred in a day may know somthing by them: If any thing may be known by Urine, I am sure it may by Art, put them both together, vis unita fortior. Thus I take my leave of you; be diligent and I am yours. Nich.
