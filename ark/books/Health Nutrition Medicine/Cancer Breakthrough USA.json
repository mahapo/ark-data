In this Special Report I’m going to tell you all about these rare clinics that only a few peo ple know about. You’re probably wondering why this informa- tion is s ecret and w hy hardly any of these clinics advertise that they can defeat cancer. I ca n tell you exact ly why these special clinics are hidden and rare. The shockin g answer is this: We no longer have health freedom in this country. Maybe you think America is still a free country. That’s what Dr. James Privitera, M.D., used to think till July, 1974, when 15 government agents burst into his office and ar rested him. They charged him with the “crime” of using non-standard me thods to cure cancer! The 15 agen ts didn’t accuse him of harming any patient. On the contrary, they charged him with “selling La etrile and other sub stance s in the diagno sis, cure, and alleviation of cancer.” In short, he was arrested for using nutrition to help cance r patients. He beat that charge when a municipal court judge declared the law unconstitutional. ‘Dr. Privitera, please put your hands behind your back’ But the government wasn’t through with him. On October 4, 1974, the police called Dr. Privitera at 1:00 a.m. and told him his office had been broken into. He went down there immediately to inspe ct t he damage. But there was no damage. Nor had there been any break-in. Instead, Dr. Privitera found two government agents who ordered him to put his hands behind his back so they co uld handcuff him. Because he couldn’t post bond till the next morning, he spent the night in jail. I’m not mak ing this up. T he government only pulls such Gesta po-like r uses when they really want to harass someone. Dr. Privitera ended up going to jail for doing his utmost to help his ca ncer patients. During his jail time he did hard la bor on a road gang — like the Georgia chain gangs you might have seen in the movies. This injustice was too much even for then-Governor Jerry Brown of Califor nia. Brown pardone d Dr. Privitera af ter h e’d worked 56 days on the road gang. Today, mor e than 3 0 years lat er, Dr. Privitera is still helping desper ate pa tients get rid of their cancers and other diseases. But to avoid gett ing int o trouble with t he government, he doesn’t treat cancer. Nor does he advertise t hat he tr eats can- cer. Nor does he mention cancer on his Website . Inst ead, he treats the p a t i e n t . When h is patient’s health improves, the cance r disappears. You’ll read exactly how Dr. P rivitera treats his patients in the chapter ab out him. Dr. Privitera isn’t th e only doctor who’s suffered government persecu tion. Dr. David Steenbl ock, D .O., ha s bee n h ar assed. So has Dr. Renee Welh ouse, N .D. Most of the docto rs in this report have b een persecu ted or hassled. Most of them don’ t advertise cance r treatment o n their Websites — for obvious re as ons. Why America’s best-known holistic doctor doesn’t accept canc er patients One of the doctors I interview ed for this Special Report is Julian Whit aker, M.D. , the C h a p t e r O n e The “secret” American clinics that defeat cancer — In spite of fierce persecution"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2 founder of the Whitaker Wellness Institute. Dr. Whitaker, who’s proba bly the best-known holistic doctor in America, doesn’t accept cancer patients because of the hostile political climate surround- ing cancer treatment. Instead, he refer s cancer patients else where. He told me he doesn’t want to practice medicine with a bull’s-eye painted on his back. In this Special Report you’ll lea rn the name of the alternative clinic to which Dr. Whitaker refers cancer p atients. I’m going to tell you about alternativ e cancer treatments that are hard to find in America. These treatments produce extraordinary recoveries from cancer. Some of these recoveries are so spectacular that some people call them miracles. And I’m going to tell you which American doctors stand at the very top of the me dical profession worldwide in the treatment of cancer. Let me explain why I wrote this Special Report. You see, my own Mom died of cancer. She struggled with it — on and off — from 1956 till her death in 19 73. This was an agonizing ordeal not just for Mom but also for our whole family. In 1956 the d octors recommended a p an- hysterectomy for her uterine cancer. In other words, they wan ted to remove her uterus and both ovaries. She underwent this drastic operation, and she seemed to be well. But her cancer snuck back 10 years later, appearing as full-blown colon cancer. The doctors again recommended drastic surgery: the removal of a large portion of her colon. After that ordeal she was never the same again. Chemo caused my Mom to retch so violently she said, ‘No more chemo, ever again!’ Then in 1973 the doctors told her she had an “advanced” case of cancer. They recommended a form of chemo that’s still widely used today. The chemo didn’t just make her vomit; it made her retch violently. It was so harsh she said she’d rather die t han undergo one more roun d of it. She kept sliding downh ill until the cancer finally killed her. Fortuna t ely, if you or your loved ones ever get cancer, you don’t have to go through the sa me drastic, painf ul, and futile treat ment my Mom suffered through. If you ordered this Spec ial Report because you’ re seeking hope for a loved one or for yourself, I’m going to g ive you a bright ray of hope. After my Mom died of cancer I embarked on a quest to find ou t if something could’ve been done to save her. I didn’t want t o see any of my other loved ones wa ste away and die of t his horrible, dre aded disease. I believe the informati on in this report wou ld have saved my Mom My quest led me to b ecome involved in the alternative h ealth movement. For more than 30 years, I've volunteer ed my time with two Ca lifornia-based not-f or-profit organiza tions that assist cancer patients and provide information about alternative ca ncer treatment s. Through my volu nteer work I’ve b ecome friends with some of the finest physicians in America and in the world — doctors who are turning around “hopele ss” and “terminal” cance rs. In fact, if I’d had the information I’m about to share with you when my Mom le arned she had cance r, I be lieve she’d still be alive — or she would’ve died yea rs la ter of old age instead. I know the alternative doctors’ sc ientific insights, methods, clinics, trea tment options, and track records. I h ave more connections with alternative cancer doctors and clinics i n America and abroad than pe rha ps anyone else in the alternative h ealth movement. In this Special Report, I’ll recommend only the doctors and clinics I know to be outstanding."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"3 The medical establishme nt is lying about your cancer treatment o ptions You see, I have a passion for alternative health and a passion for the truth. Not long after my Mom’s death I discovered that the American medical establis hment isn’t telling Americans the truth about cancer and the treatment options. Basica lly, the American medical establishment offers three treatment choices: surgery, radiation, and chemothe rapy. In other words, you have to choose between getting cut, burned, or poisoned. But as I’ll show you in this Spe cial Report, many other ef fe ctive treatment options exist. And unlike the conventional treatments — the best cance r treatments deal with the root causes of the cancer. In my opinion and that of the most succe ssful alternative c ancer doctors, a tumor is only a symp- tom that something in your body has gone haywire. That’s why tumors so o ften grow back after conventional treatments by American doctors. For more than 30 years I’ve seen p eople come to alternative clinics and — their cancers disap- pear. The treatments they receive have been proven to help. These former cancer patie nts might die 10 or 20 years later of cardiovascular disease or something else, but their cancer is GONE ! My colleague Andrew Scholberg and I interviewed the following doctors: ‰ Dr. Renee Welhouse, N.D., Ph.D. ‰ Dr. Richard Olson, D.C. ‰ Dr. David Steenblock, D.O. ‰ Dr. Julian Whitaker, M.D. ‰ Dr. Jim Privitera, M.D. ‰ Dr. Ferre Akbarpour, M.D. ‰ Dr. O. Carl Simonton, M.D. ‰ Dr. Tim Birdsall, N.D. ‰ Dr. Donna Abfall, N.D. ‰ Dr. James W. Forsythe, M.D. Let me explain the initials . M.D. stands for Medical Doctor, of course. N.D. stands for Na t uropathic Doctor, D.O. stands for Doct or of Osteopathy, and D.C. stands for Doctor of Chiropractic. Some pros and cons of your cancer treatment op tion s Let me summarize your four basic treatment opt ions for cancer. 1. The conv entional treatment: surg ery , radiation, and chemotherapy 2. The conv entional treatment PLUS the mind-body methods of Dr. O. Carl Simonton, M .D., which we desc ribe in the chapter about him 3. Non-toxic a lter native (holistic) treat- ments that build up your immune system and get rid of toxins in you r body 4. A complementary a pproa ch that includes both conventional and holistic therapies If you choose option number one, it’s true that you might surviv e. As Dr. Ju lian Whitaker, M.D., told u s, ra diation and chemotherapy are “dangerous pla cebos.” Placebos sometimes work, but th e risks of toxic thera pies are obvious. They can certa inly kill the cancer. But they some times kill the patient, too. If you’ re th inking a bout su rgery, you should know th at cancer surgeries carry a great er risk of cert ain complications than do similar surgeries on patients who don’t have cancer. A cancer pa tient incurs at lea st twice the risk of postopera- tive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and more than three t imes the r isk of fat al pulmo nary embolism than non-cancer patients wh o have similar procedur es. Option number two gives you a much better chance of survival th an option numbe r one. And statistics prove this through sound scientific studies, as you’ll see in the chapter about Dr. Simonton’s mind-body methods. I b elieve options three and four give cancer"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"patients an excellent chance of survival. No clinic, doctor, or course of treatment can guarantee that every cancer patient will survive. The re is always a risk of failure and the patient must be prepared to assume t ha t risk if he or she decides to try the treatments described in the coming chapters. But the information in this Special Report can help put the odd s in your favor and give you a better quality of life as well. How much do the various cancer treatments cost? If you choose non-toxic treatments, alternative clinics usually charge $10,000-$20,00 0. Medical insuran ce generally doesn’t pay for such non-toxic treatments. If you choose conventional treatments, your medical bills will hit six figures so f ast it’ll make your head spin. It costs about $350,000 to die of cance r in America, by the time you add up all the costs of surgery, radiation, chemo, hospitalization, and so on. But insurance usually does pay for conventional treatments. It’s puzzling that insurance companies aren’t willing to cover less expensive trea tments that are more eff ectiv e. Perhaps they’re uninforme d about the alternative treatments. You’re responsible for your decisions about health care, and no one can make them for you. You can call your own sh ots. But no matter what option or clinic you choose, after you’ve read the chapter about Dr. Simonton you’ll almost certainly want to add his mind-b ody met hods to your trea tment program. The W ellhouse Center has had a stonishing success in using non-toxic th erapies ONLY — no chemo, drugs, or radiation whatsoever. So has Dr. Privit era. Dr. Steenb lock has, too, though he isn’t opposed to prescribing a drug to, say, bring a cance r-causing infection under control. Some of the other doctors and clinics we profile in this Special Repor t use an int egrat ive, compleme ntary approac h, which we might call “the best of both worlds.” The c omplement ary approach, which u ses alternative AND conven- tional therapies, is re markably effective. A surprising benefit is that good nut ritional support enables patients to go thr ough chemo and radiation with fewer problems. The same is true of Dr. Simonton’s mind- body me thods. All of the holistic doctors we profile in this Specia l Report have a prof ound respect for the healing power of the hu man body. One of the great est physicians of all time, P aracelsus (1493-1 541), advise d: “Follow nature, and she will be your instructor. The ways of nature are simple, and she does not require a ny complicated prescriptions. The invisible forces in the b ody ar e powerful and may be gu ided by the imagination and propelled by the will. ” 4"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"5 Seventeen-year-old Valerie M. f rom Texas was pretty much on her deathbed in 2004, according to James Forsythe, M .D., when her family brought her to his cancer clinic in Reno, Nevada. She had Ewing’s sarcoma, a deadly cancer that arises in bone. Valerie had been treated with conventional cance r therapies at the finest cancer hospitals in Texas , but to no avail. Her doctors gave up on her. They told her to go home and get her affairs in order because “ nothing more can be done.” As her cancer spread, both of Valerie’s lungs develo ped large nodules. And there was a big hole in the left side of her pelvis. She could hardly walk. Her left leg was swollen. She was in a lot of pain. Dr. Forsythe offered Valerie’s family hope and said he’d do his best to reverse her cancer. After just two weeks of alternative cancer therapy, Valerie could walk around without difficulty. By the time she got home, her lesions of the lung had disappeared. Her doctors in Texas were f labbergasted. At this writing, Valerie is 21 years old and doing fine. Her astonishing and seemingly miraculous cure w as featured in a video called “The Incurables.” How did Dr. Forsythe cure this “incurable” 17-year-old? He used three main therapies: ‰ A patented natural food called Poly-MVA. Incidentally, Poly-MVA is recommended in one of o ur Special Reports, Natural Cancer Remedies that Work . (See www.natural- cancerremedies.com .) ‰ A series of intravenous trea tments known as Forsythe Immune T her apy. It’s a proprietary blend of vitamins, minerals, salicinium (a homeopathic medicine), and homeopathic benzaldehyde ‰ A low-dose reg imen of chemo. But unlike conventional high-dose chemo, whic h hits the patient like a sledgehammer, Dr. Forsythe’s low-dose regimen doesn’t cause side effects such as nausea, hair loss, or low energy. Nor does it destr oy the pat ient’s immune system. Dr. Forsythe is a rare bird among oncologists: he’s “double-boarded” You might wonder how a medical doctor specializing in oncology can use homeopathic trea tments. Afte r all, you’d think t hat an oncologist is limite d to such tr eatments as surgery, radiation, and chemo. The answer might sur prise you: Dr. Forsythe is perhaps the only physicia n in A merica who’s a board-certified oncologist and a board- certified doctor of homeopathy. In other words, he’ s “dou- ble-boarded.” Th is gives him the qualificat ions and the freedom to push the envelope by using conventional medicine or natur al medicine or both. Dr. Forsythe often uses both, as in Valerie’s case. He calls this “integrative medicine.” Not everyone chooses convent ional t reatment before homeopathic t reatment . The Queen of England, for example, can afford any kind of medica l treatment she w ants . But when she gets sick she sees a homeopat h rather than a conventional doctor. C h a p t e r T w o The Doctor Who Cures the “Incurables” “We’ve seen patients go into full remission with aggressive, stage 4 cancers, and we see continued positive responses in others with chemo-resistant cancer.” ~ Dr. James Forsythe"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"6 Later in this chapter I’ll tell you how Poly-M VA and Dr. Forsythe’s homeopathic preparations work. If you want more detailed information and if you want to see video interviews with “incurable” cance r patients who were cu red by Dr. Forsythe’s homeopathic s alicinium treatment, log onto www.salicinium.com . Dr. Forsythe’s study p roves his method beats conventional chemo! As sensational as her cure was, Dr. Forsythe knows that many conventional doctors would just shr ug off V alerie’s case. Some would say, “She was lucky.” Others would say, “It’s a case of spontaneous remission,” which means about the same thing. That’s why Dr. Forsythe is doing a study of the effectiveness of h is therapies. He’s compiling statistics that compare the results of his integra- tive cancer tre atments with the resu lts of conventional chemotherapy. Take 100 cases of tough, sta ge -4 cancers — the kind o f cancers usually considered incurable. If all 100 use conventional high-dose chemothera- py, which is the standard of cancer treatment in America today, ho w many do you think would still be alive after five years? The answer is two. That’s righ t. Just two out of a hundred — two percent. This is not only a miserable result, but also 98 percent died in sheer misery — with vomiting, hair loss, nausea, and so on. Going back to 2004, when Dr. Forsythe started his ongoing study of his integrative method including Forsythe Immune Therapy, he ha s treat- ed over 200 stage-4 cancer patients. Unlike some establishment cancer researchers, Dr. Forsythe doesn’t cherry-pick the patients for his study. Many of them, like Valerie, were practically at death’s door when they came to his clinic as a last hope. At this writing, Dr. Forsythe’s study has been going on for just about five years. And he has an 85% positive response . A positive response me ans the patient falls into one of these three categories: (1) no cancer can be de tected (full remission), (2) the tumor is shrinking (pa rtial remission), or (3) the tumor is neither growing nor shrinking (st able disease). A cancer patient in a state of stab le disease is no long er dying of cancer; the immune system has arrested the tumor. As an added bonu s, Dr. Forsythe’s methods have hardly any side effects. Compare t hat to t he miserable two pe rce nt survival rate from conven- tional high-dose chemo with ter rible side effects. Forsythe Immune Therapy wins hands down! It’s a “no braine r.” Dr. Forsyth e’s re sults are all the more astonishing when you consider that he accepts ANY patient for his stu dy — even those deemed “hopeless.” Not only does Dr. Forsythe have an abundance of “anecdota l” success st ories of turn- ing around the most difficult stage-4 “incurable” cance rs. But he also has the stat istical proof to back up the stor ies. You’d think t he American cancer establishment would beat a path to Dr. Forsythe’s door to ask him, “How are you cu ring those stage-4 canc ers that we hav en’t been able to cure?” Keep in mind t he hist orical c ontext of Dr. Forsythe’s cancer br eakthrough. In 1 971 President Richa rd Nixon re sponded to America’ s cancer crisis by declar ing a “War on Ca ncer.” This “war” was supposed to be similar in scope to President John Kennedy’s challenge to put a man on t he moon within 10 years. Since the star t of the “War on Cancer” in1971, the American canc er industry has spent literally bill ions of dollars, supposedly on trying to find better treatments and even a cure for cancer. After all those years and a ll t hose billions of dollars spent, what have the canc er resear chers come up with? All they have is the same old surgery/radiation/ch emo they ha d b ack in 197 1! And this cut/bur n/poison regime n still offers only a two percent success rate."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"7 For the American cancer industry, nothing has really changed since 1971! They’ve accomplished practi cally no thing. The federal government beats a path to Dr. Forsythe’s door Isn’t Dr. Forsythe’s 85 percent su ccess rate remarkable, especially when you compare it to the cancer industry’s two percent su ccess rate? You’d think the federal government would beat a path to Dr. Fo rsythe’s door over his discovery, wouldn’t you? Actually, they did. But perhaps not the way you’d expect. One F ebruary morning in 2005, Dr. Forsythe, was enjoying breakfast at home with his wife in Reno, Nevada. The American flag was proudly waving in the breeze from his front-ya rd flagpole. But then his wife noticed something odd through the window. Three dark sport utility vehicles pulled up the driveway. Out came three groups of agents bearing three different insignias on their flak jackets: four agents were from th e FBI, four were from the FDA, and four were from the ICE (Immigration Customs Enforcement). Mrs. F orsythe asked her husband, “What are those people doing on th e drive way?” He re plied, “I don’t know. I ’ll go see.” Dr. Forsythe opened the door just in the nick of time because an agent with a “door buster” was on the verge of smashing his door open. The 12 agents had their guns drawn and pointed them at Dr. Forsythe. Aghast with amazement, he asked, “Is this a joke?” An agent replied, “We have a search warrant for your home and your business.” Rogue agent holds gun to Dr. Forsythe’s head The agents pushed him into the room and made him kneel down. Holding a g un to his head, they searched him. The y ask ed, “Wh o else is in the house?” He r eplied, “Just my wife.” At ab out th at time, Mrs. Forsythe came down the hallway. She ha d h eard the commotion. The agents also held a gun to her chest a nd frisked her. She said later that it was lik e being rap ed. Then the agents marched both of them int o the house and separated them. They were under custody in their own home — but without any Miranda rights. Agents searched the house for seven hours, rifling every drawer and taking boxe s and boxes of files, financial rec ords, cr edit card records, and every computer in the house. T hey found nothing incriminating because there wa s nothing to find. You see, Dr. Forsythe is a patriotic, law-abiding American. He h ad done nothing wrong. His pa tients love him. He’s never been the target of a malpra ctice lawsuit in his entire ca reer. At the same time a s this home invasion, other agents were zooming in on Dr. Forsythe’s clinic. They told the patient s, “Y ou should go home because Dr. Forsythe is involved in criminal activi- ty.” The agents asked the patients if th ey could take their confident ial medical charts. They all sa id no. But the agents took them anyway — in brazen violation of doctor-pa tient confidentiality! The agents separa ted Dr. Forsythe’s staff members to interrogate them in v iolation of their Miranda rights. The agents told each staff mem- ber, “Dr. Forsythe is e ngaged in criminal activity. Are you sure you want to work here? D o you know you could be in jeopardy yourself ?” Despite the inte nse pressure and intimidation, Dr. Forsyth e’s staff didn’t quit. He wa s able to keep his clinic open during t he time of severe pe rsec ution. Dr. Forsythe arrested, fingerpr inted, strip-sear ched Finally, in Sept embe r of 2006 Dr. Forsythe was formally arrested — supposedly for irregularities"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"8 in prescribing drugs. The authorities pounded on his door during business hours. The y took him to police headquarters for a mug shot, fingerprinting, and a strip-search. At his first co urt appearance the magistrate aske d Dr. Forsythe, “How do you plead?” He replied, “Not guilty, Your Honor . I haven’t done anything wrong.” The jury’s unanimous verdict: NOT GUILTY! And that’s what the jury conclude d after Dr. Forsythe’s trial, which the L as Vegas press called “the tria l of the century.” On November 1, 2007, after on ly one hour of deliberation, the jury announced its unanimous verdict: “not guilty.” The “not guilty” verdict gave Dr. Forsythe his reputation back. He still has his medical license, his clinic, and his staff. He’s open for business and eager to help cure more patients. And the “not guilty” verdict was a terrible set back for the mainstream, conventional American cancer industry. Why did the federal government bea t a path to Dr. Forsythe’s door to harass him instead of heralding him as a hero for his cancer break- through? Sadly, the answer is because too much money is at stake. The typical cost of tre ating a cancer patient with the standard treatments — surgery, radiation, and chemo — is about $350,000. But if Dr. Forsythe helps that patient get rid of his cancer for the $7,000 cost of his intravenous treatments, the conventional cancer doctors will be out $350,000. Perhaps the conventional cancer doctors believe Dr. Forsythe is eating their lunch. But if they’re sincere, how could they possibly want to get rich from using outmoded, ineffective treatments that needlessly cause pain and usually result in death? Perhaps the conventional cancer doctors should take a closer look at Dr. Forsythe’s alternative treatments such as Poly-MVA and Forsythe Immune Therapy. How Pol y-MVA mak es cancer cell s fizzle out As mentioned e arlier, Poly -MVA is a patented food supplement. Here’s how it works, in Dr. Forsythe’s own words: “Cancer cells are a naerobic. In other words, they requir e very little oxygen to function and reproduce. They thrive on simple sugars. They also like low oxy ge n environments for their metabolism. “Poly-MVA consist s of pa lladium, lipoic acid, B-12, and thiamine. This combinat ion of ingredients is natural and non-toxic. It interferes with the metabolism of the c ancer cell. W hen administered to advanced cancer patients, Poly-MV A appe ars to have the unique capacit y to negatively affec t anae rob ic cells wh ile supporting healthy tissues. Simply put, this nutrient attack s t he ‘engine room’ of a cancer cell, short circuiting the cell’s energy p roduct ion, thereby destr oying it.” Dr. Forsyth e says that Poly-MV A is most effective on breast cancer, prostate cancer, and non-small-cell lung c ancer. His other k ey therapy, Forsythe Immune Therapy , has shown success with all k inds of c ancers. Forsythe Immune Therapy starves cancer cells to death One of the key ingr edient s in F orsythe Immune Therapy is salicinium — a homeopathic medicine. Salicinium destroys cancer cells by starving them to death. Cancer cells thr ive on sugar. Salicinium u ses an enzyme process to set up a roadblock that prevents cancer cells from gett ing any nourishment from sugar. The result is tha t cancer cells die of starvation. The other ingredients in F orsythe Immune Therapy are a propr ietary blend of vitamins, minera ls, and homeopathic benzaldehyde. These"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"substances boost the immune system. Dr. Forsythe’s other therapies and recommendations Conventio nal medicine doesn’t accept it, but rese arch suggests that dental problems can cause cance r — even in locations far from the mouth. Dr. Forsythe accepts this finding and uses it success fully to treat cancer patients. For example, a root can al can sometimes lead to an infection in the jawbone. Dr. Forsythe contends that the infectio n can spread, causing b reast cancer, prostate cancer, and other cancers. It does lit tle good to treat cancer if you ignore its underlying cause. That’s why Dr. Forsythe employs a biological dentist on site . The biological den tist gi ves each of Dr. Forsythe’ s cancer patients a dental evalu ation to determine whether a d ental problem may be causing the cance r. And if so, the problem is fixed right then and there. In addition to the biological dentist, Dr. Forsythe also employs a naturopathic doctor on site. Naturopaths have specialized knowledge of nutrition and detoxification. Dr. Forsythe strongly believes in detoxification for cancer pat ients. That’s because reducing the body’s toxic load helps the healing proce ss. Dr. Forsythe recommends several methods to detoxify the body, including chelation therapy, colon ic hydrotherapy, and far inf rared saunas. He doesn’t offer all of these services at his clinic; some of them are available off-site. As you may know, colonic hydrotherapy irri- gates the colon with five gallons of water in a process that takes about an hour. This is perhaps the best method of dislodging the gunk that can accumulate and get stuck in the colon. Concerning diet, Dr. Forsythe recommends that his cancer patients consume large amounts of the three Bs and the three Cs. The three Bs are beans, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts. The three Cs are carrots, cauliflower, and cabbage. He also r ecommends “g reen powders” (wheat, rye, barley, and alg ae powders), which helps alkalize th e body. (Cancer cells thrive in an acidic environme nt.) Dr. Forsythe recommends powders manufact ure d by a company called Boku. Dr. Forsyth e says to avoid sugar, whole milk products, fried foods, red meats, cured meats, and anything else tha t’s cured. He encourages patients to drink suc h juices as noni, mangosteen, and acai. Case Study: Doctors tell Bernadette, “Nothing can be done for your brain tumor” Bernadette’s life changed the day she was hit by a dru nken driver. Within two yea rs of her injury, the pain in her head beca me excruciat ing. Her doctors in New York gave her an MRI, a CAT scan, and other t ests . They found nothing. So they told her she had a psy chological disorder. They said she was “inventing” her pain. Every morning a t 4: 30 a.m. Be rnadette started taking the painkillers necessary t o start her day. She said the pain felt like a rak e with a million sharp prongs scraping t hrough her b rain. She also suffered double vision and had to get special glasses so she could see straight. After years of suffering , doctors gave Bernadette another MRI tha t revealed a brain tumor! She felt vindicate d. She knew her pain had alw ays been real and not a psychological invention. And now she knew the cause of it. But her doctors told her , “There’s not hing we can do for you. Chemo and ra diation won’t help. And the tumor is inoperable. Go home and we’ll make sure you’re comfort able .” She asked, “How ar e you going to make me comfortable?” Th ey replied, “W e’ll give you pain killers.” She responded, “I don’t want painkillers.

Dave’s terminal lung cancer caused total disability Dave N., a father of four teenage ch ildren, got the diagno sis on January 24, 2006. His entire left lung was full of fluid. When the doctor mentioned the “Big C” — cancer — Dave says, “It devastated me and dropped my wife to the floor.” Because o f his lung cancer, Dave cou ldn’t do the things he used to do. He went on full disability. Everything in his life fell apart. By the time the cancer reached stage 4, he knew he was going to die. The chemo made his face puffy and his ey elids droopy. It also gave him a rash. Why did Dave make the trip to Reno for cancer treatme nt? As he explains, “I didn’t have a lot of options, and Reno sounded like a good choice.” His teenage kids told him, “Dad, We want you to be here. If this is a chance, take it!” And so Dave decided to undergo the 3-week intravenous treatment known as Forsyt he Immune Therapy. He say s it doesn’t hurt, and it doesn’t cause hair to fa ll ou t. After three weeks of IV treatment, he went home with an or al form of salicinium for three months. T hen he r eturned to Reno for the follow-up exam. As wit h most of Dr. Forsythe’ s cance r patients, Dave’s tr eatment lasted four months.” Forsythe Immune Thera py is a four -month packa ge . Stage 4 patient says he’s “ready to beat the ban d”! Dave says, “It felt so warm when I came into Dr. Forsyth e’s Clinic. Everyone was so friendly.” After just the second day of intravenous tr eat- ment, Dave says, “I was rea dy to be at the band! I h aven’t had this k ind of e nergy in almost a year!” And on t he third day he felt even better. According to Dave, “I came up here with a big ba g of medications from my doctor back home, and I’m think ing, ‘ Why am I t aking all these things?’ I come in here. I take salicinium. I’m feeling great . There are rea lly no side effects. None. I feel refreshed. I’m re ady to go out and, you know, just do a nything I ca n do!” Dave’s wife adds, “Conventiona l treatment was like a death sentence. T her e was no hope. Dave lost a lot of hope. Now his mind is different. He’s positive. He wants to live.” After the first th ree week s of trea tment, “I’ve been doing 20 minute wa lks ,” says Dave. “I don’t feel like a disabled person anymore. I don’t. I feel o.k. I can wa lk up and down the street just like anyone else and not be short of breath and have to st op.

Sadly, some of the conventional treatments for prostate cancer leave a man unab le to hold his urine or to get an erection or both. But even before Gary M. was treated for his advanced prostate cancer, the cancer had depres sed his sex drive. Instead of submitting to the risk s of surgery, he decided to go to Dr. Forsythe’s clin ic. After 10 days of Forsythe Immune Therapy, he could feel the difference. When Gary went home, his doctors at the VA hospita l examined him. They found no more nod ules, no more swelling, no more pr ostate cance r. In fact, there was no evidence of cancer any more. As for h is depressed sex drive, 59-year -old Gary says, “That’s no longer a problem.” You can hear Gary’s testimonial on video at www.salicinium.com . Testimonials for wide variety of cancers During my two-hour interview w ith Dr. Forsythe, he told me many stories a bout remarkable recoveries from the most difficult and stubborn cases of cancer. Here are a few of them: ‰ 52-year-old Paula L. first saw Dr. Forsythe in 2003 with cancer in her right breast. It had spread to her lungs and bones. As a result of Po ly-MVA and salicinium, her tumor markers are nor mal, and her bone pain is gone. Furthermore, her lung lesions have disappeared. She’s in complete remission, which means that all measurable signs of disease have disappeared. ‰ 48-year-old Joseph R. runs a sewage treatment plant in Reno. The cancer in h is right lung spread to his centr al che st. Dr. Fors ythe treated him with Poly-MVA, salic inium, and low-dose chemo. Today the results of his medica l tests are normal. And he works a 40-hour we ek at the sewage treatm ent plant without any problems. ‰ 83-year-old Bob S. was on h is deathbed with prostate ca ncer. After undergoing thera pies such as Poly-MVA , salicinium, and low-dose chemo, h e’s functioning normally. He has no bone pain, and he’s wa lking on his own with no pain medic ation. ‰ 81-year-old Warren J. suffe red fr om colo- recta l cancer, and the c ancer also invaded his lungs and stomach. As a result of Poly- MVA, he’s now clear of ca ncer. His tumor mar kers ar e normal. ‰ 28-year-old Crystal K., suffered from colitis, which tur ned into colon cancer. Dr. Forsythe treated her with Paw Paw (a nutr itio nal product), Poly-MVA, and vitamins. She’s now free of disease and living a normal life. ‰ 25-year-old Jenna S. had stag e four Hodgkin’s involving her nec k and the lymph nodes in her groin. She refused che mo a nd radiat ion and came to Dr. Forsy th e in 2004. He gave her Poly-MV A and persuaded her to take low-dose oral che mo for a short time. She’s off all chemo and in complete remission. ‰ 44-year-old Sh eryl S. from Reno “fli pped” houses when that city had a hot rea l estat e mar ket. In 2003 she came to see Dr. Forsythe with stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL). Dr. Forsythe gave her Poly-MVA and salic iniu m. She is free of disease, and her tumor markers are normal. ‰ 28-year-old Diedra C., a flight a ttendant, suffered from ovaria n c ancer that had spread to her pe lvis . In 2004 she ca me to see Dr. Forsythe, who recommended salicinium plus low-dose chemo. She’ s in complete remission and continues to work as a flight attendant. 11"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"She sees Dr. Forsythe twice a year for follow-up. ‰ 57-year-old Georgia B. was on her deathbed in 2005. Her cancer doctor s told her to go into hospice; in other words, they expe cted her to die so on. But instead of going into hospice, she saw Dr. Forsythe. She didn’t want any more chemo because that had faile d her. Dr. Forsythe recommended Poly-MVA and salicinium. Now she’s in complete remission, running her mattress business with her husband. Dr. Forsythe has a big advantage over many other doctors. He’s fully trained in oncology, but he also has a pathology background. Tha t gives him an intimate knowledge of tumors. A doctor coming from an em erg ency room ba ckground or family practice background would lack this kind of knowledge . And, as mentioned earlier, he’s also a board-certified homeopathic doctor. Dr. Forsythe is one-of-a-kind. Cost of treatment Each case of cancer differs, so costs will vary, depen ding on the course of treatment Dr. Forsythe recommends. Insurance covers some costs. Bu t other costs, such as the $7,000 fee for Dr. Forsythe’s Immune Therapy with salicinium, are not cove red by insurance. The clinic charges for the initial consultation with Dr. Forsythe, t he naturopath , and the biologi- cal dentist. But insurance u sually covers it. Where to stay and wha t to do Dr. Forsyth e’s clinic is an outpatie nt facility , so you’ll need to stay at a nea rby hotel. Some of these hotels offer specia l rates f or Dr. Forsythe’s pa tients, including the magnificent Vegas-style Peppermill Resort Casino, t wo mile s f ro m t he clinic, and the Ma rriott’s R esidence Inn, w hich is three miles from the clinic.

After interviewing Dr. James Forsythe at his Century Wellness Clinic, I walked over to the nearby Reno Integrative Medical Center where I interviewed Pam Bond, the administrator. Can cer patients from all over North America travel to the Reno Integrative Medical Center. The clinic’s two doctors are Dr. Rob ert A. Eslinger, D. O., H.M.D., and Dr. David Holt, D.O., H.M.D. Besides being osteopathic doctors, these two men are also homeopathic doctors. Their approach to cancer treatment is similar to that of Dr. Forsythe, who was on the staff of Re no Integrative Medical Center until he left in 2002 to focus on his own clinic. The Reno Integrative Medical Center has an impress ive tra ck record at whipping even the most difficult a nd stubborn cases of cancer. In a moment I’ll describe the Center’s treat- ment methods. But first let me give you some true stories of terminal patients who got rid of their cance r at the Center. 71-year-old boasts the ene rgy of a 40-year-old! First I want you to hear 71-year-old Joe L. tell his story – in his own words. He came to Reno with advanced cancers of the lung and pancreas after conventional doctors had given up on him. Joe says, “For three weeks at Reno Integrative Medical Center, I was treated for cancer, taught what to eat and what not to eat. I went home and made some major lifestyle changes. I returned to Reno later for additional treatments and training. I learned to monitor and build my body’s immune system to maintain lasting health. I hav e also learned to handle stress in a more productive way. “Today, I am free of c ancer, without the trauma of chemotherapy or radiation. My energy and stamina have returned to tha t of a 40-year-old man, (not bad for a 71-yea r- old!) “Reno Integrative Medical Ce nter combined the best of God’s natural remedies with solid scienc e to restore me to optimal health. Without reservation, I highly recommend Re no Integrative Medical Center for anyone who wants to be free of cance r and live life to the f ullest!” Breast cancer patient says NO to poisonous treatments When Patty A. got breast cance r, she knew her doctor wou ld recommend chemo and radiation. But at least the doctor wa s h onest enough to admit that even with the most aggressive chemo and radiation, the cance r would prob ably come right ba ck. Such honesty is refreshing but rare. Fortuna t ely, Patt y heard about the Reno Integra t ive Medical Cente r. She sa ys, “It just made so much more sense to me. I have never regretted that decision I made b ecause it took me down the path of hea ling that only made my body stronger wit hout any ill effects. “I re ported for 3 weeks of ‘boot camp’ at t he Reno Integrative Medical Center. You can be sure the doctors and staff leave ‘no stone unt urned’ when you go th ere f or tre atment. I was busy everyday ‘getting well.’ I was impressed with Dr. Bob and the multiple t ools to a ssess the statu s of the internal terrain. My sessions with Dr. Holt were amazing. Among many things, he worked with me on the e motional aspects of cance r and how we can reverse it. I trust them complet ely. “A family member of mine acc ompanied me every day to the clinic and w as with me f or a 13 C h a p t e r T h r e e “I h ad no idea this kind of health care existed”"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"follow- up visit. Her response to this experience was, ‘I had no idea this form of health care existed, it’s absolutely amazing.’ “I was told to expect the cancerous lymph nod es to start shrinking and eventually go back to normal. And that is exactly what has happened. I can barely feel the affected lymph node in my neck. I thank God and the universe every day for everyone at Reno Integrative Medical Center. They are true healers .” “You can laugh about your cancer because there’s hope!” In November 2004, Dorothy H. was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer. Here’s what she says about her experience at the Reno Integrative Medical Center: “The doctors, nurses and staff are wonderful. They are loving, k ind, encouraging, and treat everyone as if they are the only one there. The atmosphere is b right and cheery. You meet new friends and share with each other. It is a place where you can even laugh about the cancer because there is hope. It’s not a scary place, but one that brings peace, and the treatments aren’t pain ful. The whole staff h as a positive cheerful attitude. “There is a lot of laughter too, which one needs during this time. “I know the reason I bounced back so fast is because I chose not to do chemo or radiation. If you find out you have cancer, please, I beg you to go to t he Reno Integrative Medical Center and talk to the doctors before you decide to do the traditional method. The doctors are up front and honest and will let you know what is best for you. “I can’t say enough for the center. They saved my life. I should be home with the Lord, but He used that treatment to spare me for a little longer.” Jonna’s doctor gave up on her pancreatic cancer Jonna W. was diagnosed with a neuro- endocrine tumor in the pancreas. Her doctor expla ined that surgery, chemo, and r adiation were not treatment options for her c ancer. She replied that she didn’t want to go that route anyway because she wanted to do alt ernative medicine . Her doctor encouraged her to find an alterna- tive b ecause conventional medicine had nothing to offer her. Jonna already knew about the Reno Integra t ive Medical Cente r because that’s w here her aunt had gone for treatment. Here ’s what Jonna says about her treatment at the Center: “I made an appointment w hich was the beginning of a wonder ful healing e xperience. The staff has been so helpful and car ing. The positive energy is overw helming . The practitioners have se en me throug h many problems , and they have found a cure or solution to almost all. “My cancer is receding. All in all, I believe Reno Integrative Medical Center is ‘the place’ for cance r treatment from knowledgeable, caring and truly wonderful people. ” Agent Orange victim finds cure for his cancer Doctors diagnosed Vietnam veteran John S. with prostate canc er. The prognosis was poor. The doctors told h im that e ve n with surgery or radiation, he’d need a miracle t o su rv ive. He didn’t like that message, so he sought a second opinion and even a third one . But all the doctors said the same. His prostate cance r was terminal. John resigned himself to his “inevitable” fate. But then he hea rd about the Reno Int egrative Medical Center. With not hing to lose, he sched- uled an appointment. John says, “After consultation I was put on an immune boost ing protocol to fight my c ancer. After a year and a half my c ancerous t umor start ed shrinking and today almost 4 years from my original diagnosis I a m healt hy and happy with no sympt oms of the disease. I continue to take my supplements and can only thank the 14"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"wonderful ca ring staff at the clinic. The sta ff is always pleasant and takes care of my nee ds, whether it is o n one of my once-every-six-month visits or just quickly getting my supplements sent to me in a day or so. “I contracted my cancer from a tour in Vietnam and f ro m Agent Orange. I have lost seven other Platoon mates from Agent Ora nge cance rs. I only wish my disease would have attacked me sooner so that I might have been in a position to talk to them about Reno Integrative Medical Center. Unfortunately, all of them had pas sed away bef ore I knew ab out my illness or alternative treatments available.” Uterine cancer patient ’s immune system saves her Judy W. underwe nt harsh conventional treatments for her uterine cancer , including radiation five days a week for five week s. She says, “ This brought my immune system so low, I knew I had to do something more to build my immune system and prevent a recur- rence of cancer. Because of my sister’s success 25 years ago in a similar program, I went to the Reno Integrative Medical Center. I had a live blood cell test, which showed an extre mely low immune system. “After a lengthy visit with the doctor, I started a three-week course of daily IV treatment. I also started a program of supplements and was given a list of foods to avoid. At the end of three weeks, I felt I had made friends with the staff because of the loving care and concern I was shown. I return every three to six months to have my immune system monitored. “In the past seven years, I have experienced only two slight colds, one sore throat, and no recurrence o f cancer. I thank God I was led to this ‘Haven of Hope.’” How the clinic defeats cancer A new cancer patient at Reno Integrative Medical Center gets a two-day evaluation. Each pa tient spends a n h our-and-a-h alf to tw o hours with each of th e two doctors. The doctors do a thorough e xa mination, going over the patient’ s records and health history. They pull everything t oge ther to come up with an individual treatment pla n. The initial evaluation also includes two crucial tests: a 12-h our urine test to detect any heavy metal toxicity and a full-mouth x -ray to de termine whether a dental problem might be the cause of the cancer. If th e denta l exam revea ls an infecte d root canal or infected jaw- bone, the patient is re ferred to a biological dentist to fix the problem. The clinic’s goal is to g et the body into a state where it ca n heal itself. So if there are problems in the mouth, they mu st be fixed. If t he body is carrying around a tox ic load of heavy metals, de toxification is necessary. The core of the treatment plan is a three-week “boot camp” th at features an immune boosting syste m of IVs dev eloped by t he clinic ’s founder, the late Dr. Dou gla s Brodie. These IVs cont ain various substances including cesium, a natural minera l that goes right to the canc er cells and puts them in an alkaline state. An intravenous t reatment is given every day, Monday t hrough Friday, for three weeks. Thus, th e IV thera py consists of 15 tr eatments altogether. This c an be completed within thr ee weeks if the patient starts on a Monday; otherwise, the IV treatments would go into a four th week. The patient also goes through a detoxificat ion program, which ma y include colonic hydrot hera- py. Although colonic hydroth erapy isn’t currently availab le on site, there are t her apists nearby. After the three-week “boot camp,” one of the doctors coac hes the patient by phone for the next three months . These phone calls a re regularly scheduled long-distance “office visits.” Pat ients come back once a month during those three months for a th ree-day follow-up 15"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"16 when t hey have IVs each day and meet with the doctors. Some patients do so well th ey don’t have to come back every month. The doctor might say, “Yo u don’t have to come back every month. Why don’t you come back in two or three months?” But other pat ients might need to come back in two or t hre e weeks. Unique twist on Ins ulin Potentiation Therapy One of th e most effecti ve alternative cancer treatments is insulin potentiation therapy (IPT). This therapy uses the cancer cells’ craving for sugar in a clever way. The doctor gives the patient insulin to starve the cance r cells of sugar. And then, when the cancer cells are craving sugar, the doctor gives them some – along with some low-dose chemotherapy. IPT has a devastating e ffect on cancer, and the Reno Integrative Medical Center used it for several years. But in recent years the clinic gave IPT a unique twist. Instead of giving the cancer cells low-dose chemo along with the sugar, the clinic gives cesium with th e sugar. Cesium, as mentioned earlier, is a natural mineral that goes right to the cancer cells and puts them in an alkaline state. For IPT, the clinic prefers cesium to chemotherapy because cesium isn’t toxic. Hidden cause of many cancers The doctors at the Reno Integrative Medical Cancer do what few other clinics do today: they identify the emotional and psychological cause of cancer. The doctors ask the patients, “What was going on in your life before your body allowed this cancer to grow?” And the doctors have found that just about every cancer patient has experienced some kind of emotional shock that weakened the body, allowing cancer to get a foothold. These emotion- al shocks include divorce, problems with children or grandchildren, or other situations that cause ange r, hate, resentment, and bitterness to build up inside. These resent ments mu st be resolved to help the body heal. And th e doctors are skilled at bringing about emot ional hea ling wh ile the other therapies give a big boost to physical healing. The clinic firmly believes it’s necessary to trea t the whole patient, not just the body. Dietar y recommenda tions Some cancer patients who c ome to the Reno Integrative Medical Center have been vegans all t heir lives. As you ma y know, a vegan is a strict vegeta rian that ea ts no fish, eggs, or da iry foods. One vegan came to t he clinic in te ars, saying, “I have cancer. I shou ldn’t have cancer!” How can this be? How ca n vegans who’ve been trying to eat h ealthy their whole live s get can cer? When a vegan comes to the clinic with cance r, the doctors usually f ind that the problem is not enough protein. For t hat reason, the clinic doesn’t strictly recommend vegeta rianism. If you’ re going to eat meat, the c linic recommends organic chicken. If you’re g oing to eat beef, eat grass-f ed organic beef. Be careful of fish because of t he mercury. Th e fish’s mercury content depends on where it was ca ught. The clinic highly recommends the Budwig die t for cancer patient s. This diet, wh ich mixes flax oil w it h cott ag e cheese, is named aft er the legendary Germany ph ysician Johanna Budwig, M.D. Dr. Budwig wrote a b ook descr ibing this remarkable diet, whic h has he lped count less cance r patients ge t well. The clinic also recomme nds sit ting out in t he sunshine to g et some vitamin D. Each patient receives individua l recomme ndations f or diet. In addition, the clinic offers specialized forms of massage to relax the patient and give the pa tient more energy. Clinic administrator Pa m Bond told me,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"17 “People feel the difference wh en they walk through the door. We just love our patients. We go the second, third, and fourth mile for them. We try not to be ‘clinical.’ We try to be homey, as you can tell from the décor of the office. We just really care about our patients. When they leave their three-week intensive, there are tears in their eyes because they’ve felt cared for and safe. A nd this is a place of hope. “Our doctors are just amazing. People have come out of their offices after spending close to two hours with the doctor, with tears in th eir eyes, saying, ‘ That’s the first time I’ve ever had a doctor really listen to me’ or ‘That doctor just told me my whole life. How did he know that?’ Just knowing what questions to ask is a gift. Both of ou r doctors are gifted men.” Cost of treatment The initial two-day evaluation normally costs a little over $1,000, but it might be less. And insurance may cover it. The cost of the three-week “Boot camp” is about $15,000 to $17,000, w hich includes lab draws, supplements, and time with the doctors. This is a reasonable price.

Her clinic occupies the entire ninth floor of the tallest office building in Huntington Beach. Her patients love the panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean, Catalina Island, and the mountains. But they love Dr. Ferre (pronounced “fairy”) and her life-saving treatments even more. We visited Dr. Ferre in her office, and she generously let us interview her. She did such a fine job of telling her story that we decided simply to print it a s she told it to us: Dr. Ferre’s story in her own words I have been here in Southern Califor nia since 1978. Every day I get three or four thank -you letters from patients. It’s really amazing. It’s so pos itively energizing. It’s just unbelievable. I thank God for allowing me to be in this field and do what I’m doing now. It’s important for me to read these letters. And it gives me so much energy to help even more patients overcome cance r. Let me tell you a memorable story. About six and a half years ago a gentleman named Robert came to me from Australia with Stage Four colon cancer. Stage Four means that it has spread to some other places. Most doctors consider it terminal. Doctors didn’t give him more than two or three months to live. That’s why he decided to come here. Robert was short of money, so his local church donated money to pay for his treatment. Some people at his church had heard about our success rate with advanced cancer patients. So he came here with his beautiful wife and with his good s e n s e o f h u m o r .

He later died of another cause. Young den tist thought his life was ruined by nasopharyngeal cancer I h ave a writt en test imonial of a young dentist. He came t o me in August of 2 005 with an unfortunate ca se of nasopharyngeal cancer. That’s one of the worst cancers, not only because of its gravity but also because of the wa y it progresses. Convent ional doctors ca n’t do much for these patients . Also, because it occupies the oral cavity — ear, nose, and thr oat — usually the patient s become deformed and lose the ir hea ring, their speech, and their ability to eat. So it’s one of th e worst cancers that people could ever get. This dentist was practicing in Te xa s. He was going to one of the most prestigious cancer clinics in Texas, and t he tr eatment seemed to be successful. But one day when h e was playing ball with his 6-year-old son, his son accident ally k icked him in the groin. So he started to have pain a nd swelling. He we nt to his doctor and said, “Listen, this is hurting t oo much.” A CAT sc an revealed that his cancer was back and h ad spread to his abdomen. It was bad. Dentist says NO to chemo and prepares for death The doctor told him, “Let’s start chemotherapy immediately. We may squ eeze two or three months out of your life.” He said, “No, thank you, I don’t want t o do it.” He had been thr ough chemo before, and he didn’t want any more of it — especially since the ch emo only offered him another two or three mont hs. The dentist had a lready made plans to move to California. Thinking he was healthy, he had sold his dental practice in Texas a nd had already pur- chased a major dent al clinic in California. All of a sudden, his pla ns lay in ruins. He came to California anyway b ut couldn’t I was changing his protocols. I was ordering blood work. So a few days before he passed away, he called me and said, “Doctor Ferre, it looks like I’m ready to go.” He was dying not of cancer but of kidney failure, and dialysis was n’t going well. So he said, “I think I want to say good-bye to you. I’m really thankful that you gave me the oppor tu nity to live four-and-a-half years. I have been the happ iest person.” The day he passed away, his wife sent us an e- mail. She said, “Robert passed away, but I wanted to thank you for the years you gave us. Robert lived happier, healthier, and he was stronger spiri- tually, physically and emotionally since he was under you r care. And I wanted to thank you for that.” So this is a memorable story. It will always be in my mind and in my heart. Farmer beats deadliest lung cancer I h ad a farmer from Conne cticut come to us with one of the deadliest cancers of the lung. He kept saying, “If I die, I’ve lived a good life. If I live, I’ll be thankful to God.” He wasn’t afraid of dying. This beautiful man came with h is daughter. He was here at least four weeks. He started to do bet- ter and better and better. Conventional medicine offers no treatments for this kind of cancer — no chemo, no radiation, nothing — because it’s not sensitive to anything. So the only thing that helped him was our n atural treatment. We were so proud of him; we had his CAT scans, taking them everywhere and showing them to others. And with this treatment, he got better and better and better. The tumor totally disap- peared as proven by a CAT scan. He did so well that he went back home and went back to work. Three years passed. It’s unheard of for anyone to survive this kind of lung cancer for three years! Three years passed, so we were all so happy and so proud. 19"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"practi ce dentistry because of his ill health. O ne of his friends, a re ligious woman, told him, “Go and see this lady. I’ve heard a lot of good things about her.” So he came to see me in August of 2005. He was sitting there with his wife. I tried speaking to them, but he seemed out of it — as if he were thinking, “I’m dying. What’s this lady talking about?” So I t alked with his wife. His wife said, “We’re starting with you tomorrow.” The man started with me. He was here for three weeks. Every day he felt better and better and better. Then I told him, “Let’s do gene tic testing analysis for your cancer. Let us send y our blood to Germany for some genetic analysi s, and they will do the gene testing and th ey w ill let us know what kind of treatment your b ody would best respond to.” So we did that, we sent it to Germany. The results came back, showing that his cancer was ult ra-sensitive to hyperthermia. He was already receivin g hyperthermia every day. It also indicated that his cancer was sensitive to a certain kind of chemo. He was against chemo because of his past experience with it. But I assure d him he would ha ve no problem with a low dosage. He said O.K. With my treatment and the low dosage chemo, he re sponded w ell. The ly mph nodes got smaller, he was in no pain, and he didn’t have any recurrence in the nasopharyngeal area. He ’s in total remission now after a year and a half. And this man is going to go back to work. I have a lot of cases like this. Opera singer miraculously recovers her voice I had a patient from Texas named Bernadette. She came to me again about seven or eight years ago. She had multiple problems including cancer. One of Bernadette’s major problems was Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which paralyzed her extremities and a lso the muscles of her lungs. She had been an oper a singer but no longer had enough lungpower to sing . She had lived in hospitals f or the previous 1 2 years. And they had done everything that standard medicine has availab le — ev en a hig h dosage of a steroid therapy. But they couldn’t help her. Amidst this a gony , she came down with se riou s muscle ac hes and muscle pain. So she got hooked on morphine and morphine der ivatives. And she became addicte d to all these n arcotic s. I’ll never forget. She called me and she said, “Doctor, I’m coming for detoxific ation because I h ave Guillain-Barré syndrome and I am hooked on these medications. Can you help me?” I said, “I’ll try.” She said, “How long do you need me?” I said, “At least two weeks to detox your body and blood.” So she came here . After five wor king days, she sa id, “Doctor, I don’t th ink my body even desires any narcotics any more. I think I’ve forgot ten all about narcotics. I’ m doing fine without them. And my muscle s are getting stronger. I’m able to breathe better. I don’t need ox ygen, and I am just feeling stronger!” Her second week of treatment took plac e during Thanksgiving. I told some patients, “I’d better leave earlier today for my TV int erview. And Bernadett e just stood up and said, “Can I come with you?” I said, “Yes, of course y ou can. But it’s a Persian progr am, and you don’t speak Persian.” She said, “But someone could translat e my message. I want to come and tell the world. Since it’s Thank sgiving, I w ant to sha re my blessing with the world and let them know there’s still hope left.” So I took her with me. Another doctor was the host. I was that doctor ’s gu est. And he interviewed Bernadette, who told him about her amazing health re sults. When t he doctor realized Bernadette was an opera singer who hadn’t been ab le to sing for years, he asked, “Do you th ink you could sing now?” She replie d, “Sing? Oh, my gosh . I don’t 20"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"think so. But I’ll try.” And she started to sing ope ra. I was crying. She was crying. She was hugging me. That was such an emotional thing. Bernadette beats mela noma with t o t a l l y n a t u r a l remedies That’s not even all. During this time she was diagno sed with malignant melanoma, a serious cance r of the skin. She was concerned she wasn’t going to survive the melanoma. She started to eat healthy. She continued with detoxification and other therapies. And then I star ted her on immune boosting for her melanoma. Melano ma is a disease that spreads quickly . But it didn’t sp read anywhere in her body, and she recovered from melanoma. Melanoma is a cancer that responds beautifully to immune boosting. And we did t ha t with non-chemical, totally natural remedie s , totally natural. And her anemia got better. Her melanoma has never come back, which her oncologist confirmed. Sh e is in total remission with her melano ma . And the good news is that she got married last year in a beautiful castle in Scotland. Her husband is from Scotland. In fact, she wants me to put her wedding picture on my Website. She said, “Doctor, I beg you, p lease do that.” She’s that th ankful to me. It’s so beautiful, so beautiful. And I talked w ith her four or five day s ag o, and she said, “I have never felt this good in my life. I’m going to school, and I’m right now doing everything myself. But I have so much energy, and I’m doing so much better.” She’s still taking my supplements. She’s still under my direction for supplementation and everything. And another beautiful thing is that since she improved so much with all these natural treatments that I am doing, she is becoming a naturopath her self. She is going through the second year of naturopathic school, and she said in a few years she’s going to become a doctor. Doctors said her bilateral ovarian cancer was ‘hopeless’ Three ye ars ago a young lady came t o see me from San Francisco. S he was about 45 years old and never married. Sh e told me she wasn’t from a rich fa mily. She said she rea lly nee ded my help. I h ad helped he r niece get r id of a spinal tumor. That’s how she knew me. So her brother-in-law, the father of the girl who got rid of t he spinal tumor, told her he was going to sell his Laundromat, get some money, and send her to me. Her doctors said her case was “hopeless.” At the time of diagnosis, the cance r had alre ady spread a l l o v e r h e r a b d o m e n . The tumor was so big that they couldn’t e ve n do surgery. And she was afraid of c hemotherapy. And she told me her doct ors had drawn at least 12 or 13 liters of fluid fr om her lungs and abdomen. Her cance r marker was close to 4 ,0 00 when we start ed with her. A normal marker is not more than 35. So this was an unf ortu nate case. Crying patient say s, ‘I don’t want to die’ When sh e f irst came here, she cried all the time. She put her head on my shoulde r and cried, saying “I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die.” And I told her, “Listen, no one is God, and I don’t want to promise you too much, but we’re doing our best. You’ve got to stay positive. Don’t lose your fait h. Stay positive. Good things will happen. ” So during h er first week of treatment I had to give her a lot of encouragement and spir itual support. The second week she realized th e treatment was helping her b ecause she w asn’t accumulating water any more. She wasn’t bloa ted. She was feeling better, less nause ous. S he cou ld breathe better. Th ere was no mor e fluid in her lungs. Since her case was so bad, I told her, “Listen, I want you to understa nd that I’m your support. We need a combination treat ment here. We need 21"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"to integrate the standard treatment with what we are doing because of the seriousness of your case.” She started to cry and said, “I’m scared the chemotherapy is going to kill me.” I said, “No. I’m going to send you to another oncologist, a nd I promise we are going to start you with the lowest dos age of chemotherapy. And if you tolerate it and you feel okay with that, then we are going to go to the standard dosage.” And that’s what we did with her. She trusted me and agreed to go see another onco logist. We started the combination chemotherapy and my natural treatments at the same time together. And, thank God, be cause she was getting our natural treatments, she didn’t have too many side e ffects. She didn’t have m uch fatigue, nausea, or loss of appetite. So she was with us for four weeks. And then we sent her back to her oncologist and surgeon in San Francisco. The surgeon did a scan. Amazingly, the tumor had shrunk in just four weeks. And the cance r markers had dropped to almost less than half in one month. So the oncological surgeon told her, “Now we can do surgery.” She survived and she came back to normal life in no time. No complicat ions, no problems. Again, two or th ree months later , after she improved from her surgery, she came back here. I gave her more treatment; I sent her back to her chemotherapy. In less than six or seven months she was in total remission. Her cancer has never returned. She’s alive and doing fine. This is ano th er beautiful story. Doctors called his lung cancer ‘hopeless’ Seven or eight years ago I helped a man overcome advanced prostate cancer. He did fine. Then three years ago he called me all of a sudden. His situation was sad. He came in with his wife and told me, “Unfortunately, I was just diagnosed with lung cancer a month ago. In surgery they removed a little bit, but they said I’m in Stage 3 to 4. It h as gone to the lymph nodes. They don’t hav e too mu ch hope for me. You saved my life once bef ore, and I want you to help me.” Again, I did the same thing w ith him. He was here for five weeks. He was in bad shape, coughing a lot. He had multiple tumors. He started to get stronger and better every day. He was coughing less. After t hre e weeks I told him, “Mike, I want you to see anot her oncologist and let us try a s m a l l dosag e of some chemotherapy, be cau se there are some chemotherapy patients with lung c ancer who are doing fine with it, and yours is t he kind that may respond.” So he said, “Doctor, if you think so, I will.” I told him, “If it doesn’t work or you can’t tolerate it, we ’ll just stop.” He trusted me. The tumor shrank so much that he was able to go for another surgery. This time they were able to remove it. Again he came back for my treat- ment after t he tumor w as removed, and he got my treatment for anothe r month. And at Christmastime he c ame here. He sa id, “You gave me the gift of life, Doctor Ferre. I can’t thank you enou gh. I’m back to my work. No one believed I was going to survive this cancer.” That was three years ago. Patients need hope, but not false ho pe Sometimes I see patients who’ve maxed out their chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Some of t hem have also ha d unsuccessful mult iple surgeries. And then they c ome to me. These are bad cases. And when I see the pat ients wit h nearly hopeless cases , I try to give them hope. I don’t tell them “I’m going to cure you.” I will tell them “I’m going to do my best.” I h ave had some pa tients who did well. I have had some pat ients who didn’t do too well be cau se they came too late. S o I’m honest wit h my patient s. You know, th ere h ave been lots of times when I sit and cry with my patients. These people are hopeless. Sometimes they don’t even have any 22"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"family support left. So they come here on their own. They have no one else. And I h elp them and talk with them. Patients pray and me ditate in clinic’s chapel We p ray togethe r. We have a little ch apel in our clinic. Our patients go there no matter what religion they have. Just the connection with y our Creator is important. Some people go there to pray. Some med itate. Some have their private time with their family. They do whatever g ives them comfort. We ask them to have prayer in their daily program because I strongly b elieve if you want to treat a patient successfu lly, you have to believe in the connection of mind, body, and spirit. If you don’t have these connected togeth er, then you cann ot treat any diseases. I’m a strong believer in Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine. Amazingly, medical science is now proving Hippocrates right. For ex ample, Hippo crates said the best way to treat disease is through the immune system. And he talked about the need for harm ony and unity. He said if you want to be healthy, your mind and body must be in har mo ny with your environment. Can you be lieve he said those things 2,500 years ago? You can give a patient the best treatment, but if he has disharmony with his God or his family or his past, or if he has too much stress at work, the patient won’t do well. I tell my patients, “This is the time for you to be at peace. You have to allocate all your energies to get better. This is the healing time. You have to forget about anything that bothered you. And you have to have forgiveness. That way, your body and your spirit and your mind are going to be in harmony.” If these things are in harmony, no matter what kind of disease the patients have, they’re going to have better success in fighting that disease. So I bring this to my patients’ attention. If they need any spiritual healing, they let me know. I will find help for them. I have psychologists and spiritua l healers who work with my cancer pa tients. They work on the mind, b ody, and spirit. And they get so much bet ter. They feel so much better. And of course I’ m the one who f ocuses on the patient’s body. I check their immune syst em and their kidney/liver f unct ion. I c hec k them for anemia and for antioxidant deficiency. I check their Vitamin D level and t heir electrolytes. I’m monitoring them constantly. And I have t wo doctors who are wor king with me f or my research. So if I need t he latest article, for example, a bout brain tumors or skin tumors or any thing like that, they deliver it to me immediately. I try to use the b est of ever ything from all over the world. There may be something that a doctor in Israel is doing that I didn’t know about. And then I ask m y research doctors to find it for me. They bring it to me, and th e new research may influence me to a djust the treatment. I try to be on top of all the newest infor mation so I c an do the best. Natural treatment secrets revealed The treatments I give are totally natural. Number one, when the patients start with me, I c hec k all their b ody functions. I c hec k their kidney, liver, heart — everything. And then I start with the daily treatment s. I start with massage therapy for 45 t o 60 minutes for lymphatic drainage. I have a certified massage therapist who gives this th erapy, which helps rela x the patients throughout the day. So they start with massage therapy, and they love it. And they look forward t o that massage the rapy every single day. Why do I feel so strongly th at massage t herapy is necessary? It’s beca use all these patients with cance r or chronic diseases are toxic. If their bodies were not toxic they wouldn’t have gotten 23"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the disease. And most have gone through chemotherapy, which results in a lot of toxi ns in their body. So t he massage and the consequent lymphatic drainage are not only going to relax them, but also help them get rid of toxins. And the lady w ho gives the massage is also going to give them some reflexology. And that is somethin g els e that the patients look forward to because it balances their energy and helps them get rid of pain. They love it. So this is a key part of the treatment: Massage therapy, lymphatic drainage, detoxification, and reflexology. Right after massage therapy, the patients go into the in fra red sauna. It’s a special kind of sauna that helps the p atients detoxify. And the beauty of it is that even the patients with lu ng disease and heart disease can tolerate the heat of the infrared sauna. Of course, a nurse or one of the doctors watches the patients during their time in the infrared sauna. They start with 10 or 15 minutes a day in the sauna, and then as they tolerate it we increa se the timing. And usually w e give them about 20 minutes in the infrared sauna. Cancer hates heat! Why do I do this? It relaxes the patients as they get rid of the toxins throug h swe ating and perspiration. But the most important reason is that c a n c e r c e l l s h a t e t h e h e a t . So the infrared sauna helps weaken the cancer cells, making them easier to kill off. After the infrared sauna, the patients get intravenous therapy for three or four hours. I give them multiple minerals and some antioxidants intravenously — especially a high dosage of Vitamin C. That’s because Vitamin C in high doses has a toxic effect on cancer cells without hurting the healthy cells. The Vitamin C helps release hydrogen peroxide in the cancer cells, and the hydrogen peroxide is going to act like a cancer-killing substance. This IV therapy is a safe way of doing something for these patients. It strengthens the immune system while weakening the cancer cells. So if the patient also gets ch emotherapy the result will be better t han with chemotherapy alone. While patients ar e getting this IV therapy, they are going to be relaxing in a spacious room. I don’t have a crowd of patients. I don’t take more than five patients per week. The patients are friendly with each other. T hey have TV sets, and I encourage them to wa tch comedies because laughter boosts their immune syst em. We have a good selection of comedie s, or they can watch a movie th ey bring from home . The patients ca n also e njoy a spectacular pa noramic view of the Pacific Ocean, C atalina Island, and the mountains from our floor-to-ceiling windows on the ninth floor. Helping patients visualize whipping cancer Also I show them a video ca rtoon that helps pa tients visualize th eir own healthy immune cells de stroying their canc er ce lls. Watching this video rea lly energizes and encou rag es them. It really gives th em a positive attit ude th at th ey ’re going to whip their canc er. Let’s face it. When someone is diagnosed wit h cance r, the big “C,” it’s scary. A lot of times pa tients lose it. They lose their positiv e attitude. They think cancer is going to take their lives. But when I show them the a nimated cartoon of the immune system killing cancer ce lls, they realiz e a strong immune syste m can destroy t heir cancer cells.” [Editor’s note: See the chapter about Dr. O. Ca rl Simonton for more informat ion a bout this powerful visualization technique for healing.] After the first IV is finished, we give them the se cond IV — a natural supple ment we get from Ca nada. This suppleme nt is an extract of ginseng. It’s expensive. To make just one b ottle of it takes at least 100 pounds of ginseng! It’s that potent. And then t her e’s a th ird IV that prolongs the effect of the Vita min C. So these are things th at pat ients will do every day. 24"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"In addition, we do a nutritional consu ltation. Our certified nutritionist is one of the best. She has helped a lot of emaciated patients — patients who’ve lost a lot of weight because of the cancer or AIDS. She sees the patients and their families, spending at least an hour with them to explain the importan ce of diet. Cancer’s best friend: sugar! For example, I truly take the sugar out of my cance r patients’ di et. And before they see me, most patients hav e no idea why sugar is so bad. And not only do I explain it to them, other doctors who wo rk with me also talk with them about the importan ce of diet. My nutritionist e xplains that the cancer cells have more re cep tors for sugar than a normal cell. So eating less sugar weakens their cancer cells. Cutting out sugar is sometimes tough for patients because sugar and sweets are delicious. Our dietician gives them recipes. Patients can see the dietician as many times as they want. And then we s tart the patients on a lot of natural supplements. Some supplements a re for detoxification. Some supplements help build the patients’ strength. This is especiall y important for patients who hav e pancreatic cancer s, since they’re nauseous and vomiting a lot. These patients are wea k. I give some patients food suppleme nts high in calories and protein. My cance r patients take a lot of supplements. Diabetic patie nts get different supplements for their diabetes, and I have a lot of supplements for immune boosting. That’s important. And some of the supplements are going to be used to repair damaged DNA. It took a scientist 25 years to develop one such supplement, which is proven to work through studies in mice and even in human beings. If DNA is damaged, it can initiate cancer. So we want to prevent further damage. And also I have an all-natural supplement that blocks circulation to the cancer cells. This supple- ment has a lot of science behind it. It has been studied and comp ared with standard medications. It’s totally safe and far le ss expensive than the standard drugs. And it has no side effects. I tell the pat ients, “We want t o help your body. Let’s see what you r own body is going to do with your canc er.” In addition to the massage therapy, infrared sa una, IVs, and oral supplementation, we use hyperthermia. Patients enjoy going into the hyperthermia tent, which r aises th e body tempera- ture. This helps them detoxif y, and ca ncer hates heat. All of our equipment is approved by the FDA or registered by th e FDA. [Edit or’s note: In our other report Natural C ancer Remedies, Dr. Morton Walker devotes an entire chapter t o the story of hy perthermia: How it was discovered, and how it literally cooks cancer out of the body.

We inform the patients t hat insurance doesn’t pay for our treatments . Rather, they’ll be paying out-of-pocket. Of course, they cou ld pay by credit card or check. And that includes all the na tural treatments from the time they start until they leav e. No one is going to b e left u nattended. Sometimes I give them about $2,000 per week in oral supplements. I use expensive stuff — the finest that money can bu y. I don’t care about the mone y. I seek the best q uality. So I’m not going to sacrifice quality to try to get th e price down. I’m ju st going to give my patients the best, period. So it’s all included: the dietician, the massage therapist, the infrare d sauna, t he IVs, the hyperthermia, and everything else is inc luded in that $4,900 . The only thing w e don’t pay for is the lab work, which is cov er ed by the patient’s insurance. Since I’m a licensed medical doc tor, we have ne ve r had any prob lem with t he lab work for t he pa tients. And insurance normally covers that .

In that case we give them detoxif ication and advice for diet, suppleme ntation, and IV treatments. But if they come to me at Stage 3 or 4 , they ’re really in bad shape. In that case I’ll probably need to treat them for four weeks. A few of these patients are in good shape after just three weeks. If I’m satisfied they ’re getting strong er , their liver function is getting better, and they’re able to continue their su pplement treatment at home, I will tell them three weeks is enough. But with the Stage 4s, usually I will keep them for four weeks. I believe that combining the best of both alternative medicine and standard medicine makes good integrativ e medicine.

On that day my life was turned upside down. I had just flown in from Zurich to London to prepare for a multi-million dollar oil deal. I was suppo sed to leave the next day for West Africa. The president of one of the African countries wanted to discuss a big oil deal w ith me, since I had the right to explore and produce gas and oil in that count ry. I came home that night. I was alone, relaxing with a drink a nd getting myself rea dy to go out for dinner an d thereafter to fly to Africa. I turned on the TV to watch the Iranian channel. I saw a doctor on the TV, talking abou t a drug that had just been ap proved by the FDA for actually curing leukemia. After discussing the dr ug, he opened the telephone lines to the public if they had any question s. The first caller was a lady calling a ll the way from Iran. She was crying so hard she had trouble speaking properly. She asked that doctor, “How can I get this drug? My six-year-old daughter was diagnosed with leukemia last year. We’ve spent all of our money for the treatment of my daughter, but it didn’t work. And my daughter now is dying in front of my eyes. Please tell me where I can get this drug and how much is it?” Mother loses all hope for her six-year-old girl’s recovery The doctor replied, “The drug is available in America, but unfortunately it is a little bit expensive: about $3,300 a month. And the poor woman was still crying when she said, “Doctor, I’m f rom a poor family, and I can’t afford even to buy this drug for one month .” And the doctor sa id, “I’m sorr y. I’m just a scientist. I can’t do anything for you.” The poor woman continued to cry and, without even say ing goodbye, she hung up on him. I knew the owner of th at TV station. So I picked up the phone and asked to speak to t he owner. I told him, “I have an offer for you, but I want you to promise me t hat you won’t mention my name on the TV.” He gave me his word. So I sa id, “Here’s the de al. I’m going to give you my credit card number. As long as I’m alive I w ant t o buy tha t drug every month and send it to this poor woman to save her baby’s life.” He started asking me and begg ing me t o let him me ntion my name on the air. I said, “No. I’m not doing it for publicity. I’m doing it for my heart. I’m doing it for my God.” URGENT message for the desperate, crying mother ! The TV station owner went on the air in front of t he camera and said, “Ladies a nd g entlemen, I’m sor ry to interrupt the progr am, but I have an URGEN T message for the lady who was crying a few minutes ag o b ecause she w as not able to buy a cancer drug for her baby.

We transcribed his riveting remarks, which app ear below:"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Pres ident I cannot be there tomorrow.” And that pres ident is famous; when he gets angr y he’s like a tiger. I don’t want to mention his name or his country. It wasn’t easy to postpone that appoint- ment because I knew the delay would irritate him. I couldn’t think about the money, th e oil deal, or meeting the President. I just wanted to accomplis h my mission to save the girl’s life. I had to follow my heart, no matter what. I was supposed to go out for dinner that night, but I cancelled that, too. My phone rang. The call was long distance from Iran. It was the poor woman who had cried over her dying daughter. We spoke for an hour and a half. ‘Are you human or an angel?’ The mother’s first question to me was, “Who are you?” I said, “Ma’am, my na me is Iraj Kiani.” She said, “No, I mean, are you a human? Are you an angel? Why do you want to help my daughter?” I said, “Just consider that this is a mission from God. Give me your number and let me help your baby, and your baby from now on w ill be my baby.” It took me nin e days to get the dru g and send it to her. It was embargoed. We couldn’t send the drug directly from America to Iran. I found some- body in Europe; I bought a ticket for someone to take it to Europe. And when I was assured she had the drug, then I flew to Africa to do the oil deal with the head of state. I flew from London to Africa, and when I arrived at the President’s mansion, he was sitting and having barbeque chicken with one of his girl- friends. I sat down and he said, “Good afternoon, Kiani.” I replied, “Good afternoon, Chief; please forgive me. I know you were waiting for me for the last 10 days, b ut I had a family problem. I hope you’ll forgive me.” The Presiden t told one of his generals, “This gentleman is not allow ed to leave my country without my permission.” I said, “Mr. President, am I u nder arrest?” He said, “Yes, sir, I’m going to teac h you a lesson. You do not keep the President of t his country waiting for 10 da ys .” I knew I wasn’t r e a l l y u nder arrest, but the 10- day delay certainly irritated him. The President asked one of the offic ers to br ing me a shot of whiskey. Cell phone rings a t t he w o r s t p o s s i b l e t i m e ! I th ought I had swit che d off my cell phone, but th at day I forg ot. As the President was sitting there like a tiger, angry with me, my cell phone start ed ringing. I said, “I’m sorry, Mr. President . I do apologize. I forgot to turn it off.” He said, “Answ er your phone .” I said, “Mr. President, I will pick up t he message lat er.” He said, “No, a nswer your phone!” I answered my phone. It was the woman from Iran, the mothe r of the b aby. She was crying again. I said, “Now why ar e you crying? You received the drug last night.” A nd she said, “Yes, I have the drug. I took it to my baby’s doctor this morning, and he told me it’s not good for my baby. It doesn’t wor k on this partic ular leukemia.” I said, “Plea se, give me two or three hours. I’ll call you back . Don’t c ry, please. The same God who brought us togeth er will handle this. Don’t cry.” And I switched off my c ell phone and put it away. And the President said, “W hat was t hat?” I said, “Mr. Preside nt, that wa s a personal call.” He said, “That phone call changed your face. What happened to you?” I said, “It’s a private matter. Would you please leave it alone?” A nd he said, “No, I want to know!” I was already in trouble with him, and I didn’t want to lose his friendship and his business. So I told the President the wh ole story. He got up, hugged me, and he star ted kissing me. And he said, “Kiani, a t least one or two pe ople every week come to m y mansion t o request consideration for timber, gold mining, copper mining, everything.

I want to finish it myself. And God is great. He will help.” He said, “Fine, what are you going to do?” I said, “I don’t know. My hands are full, and I have to call the doctor.” The President handed me his satellite phone and told me to use it. ‘Only one doctor in the world can save this little girl’ I called the doctor. Amazingly, he picked up the phone o n the first ring. I asked him for adv ice, explain ing tha t the drug doesn’t work on the baby. He said, “I’m sorry, I cannot do anything any more.” I begged him to show me a way. And he told me he knew of only one doctor in the world who could save this baby. I said, “Okay. Give me the name.” And he g ave me the name and telephone number of Ferre Akbarpour, M.D., in Huntington Beach, California. And it took me 10 days to be able to talk to her. When I called her, she was in Chicago delivering a lecture. She said, “Mr. Kiani, I know for the last several days you asked me to talk to you, but I’m sor ry. I’m a busy doctor and was not able to talk t o you. But I promise you I’ll do anything I can fo r your daughter.” I said, “Doctor, she’s not my daughter. I want to be her sponsor. I want to buy a d rug for her.” Dr. Ferre said, “Wow! I thought people like you didn’t exist in this life any more.” I said, “No, Doctor, there are millions. We just don’t know them.” It was love at first sight Four weeks later I was on a plane to meet Dr. Ferre in person for the first time. I arrived here in Huntington Beach with a ring in my pock- et. I proposed marriage immediately. She said yes. I put the r ing on h er finger , and we got marr ied on the first night. And here I am.

I’d love to work with you closely, and I’d lov e to send you pa tient s.” The little girl’s mother sent us her pic tures, lett ers, and paintings. Sh e was alw ays thanking us.

C arl Simonton’s most startling and revolutionary dis covery about cancer tre atment is this: Your beliefs influence your health — for better or for worse. In other words, your imagination can help heal yo u or it can make an illness worse. It can even kill you. Dr. Simonton generously let us interview him by phone from his home in Malibu. As Dr. Simonton e xplains, “The impact of counseling on the course of cancer is solidly documented. Three randomized, match-controlled studies now prove that counseling doubles the expected survival time and improves the quality of life. With counseling, we see increased numbers of long-ter m survivors. And the ‘side effects’ of counseling are desirable. But there’s a resistance to embrace new concepts. That’s the pro blem.” Skeptic converts to believer In fact, one skeptic, David Spiegel, M.D., a psychiatrist from Stanford University, did a study in 1989 to d i s p r o v e the effectiveness of Dr. Simonton’s counseling methods on cancer patients. The results s hocked Dr. Spiegel because a l l of the cancer patients in the control g roup were dead within 48 months of entering the study, but one-third of tho se in the other group — the cancer patient s who got counseling — were still alive! Those in the control group survived an average of 19 months; those who received coun- seling survived an average of 36 months. The Spiegel study, published in the prestigious medical journal T h e L a n c e t , surprised the world- wide medical community. This study carries a lot of weight because Dr. Spiegel started out as a skeptic but couldn’t ignore the facts. [Editor’s note: Here’s the re fe rence for Dr. Spiegel’s study: L a n c e t 1989; 2: 8668: 8 88-91.) Though Dr. Simonton’s discover y is well- established, most doc tors today are still treating ONLY the body — as if the body we re separate from the mind. That’s just plain w rong because the mind and the b ody are one. According to Dr. Simonton, when a doc tor trea ts the patient as if the patient’s mind has NO role in the trea tment process, he fails to see the mind as the single most powe rful force for healing. Dr. Simonton treats the patient as a whole, inst ead of separat ing the mind a nd body. His methods have spre ad to holistic medical c enters here and there throug hou t America . A few conventional doctors, too, are discovering and applying his ideas. With severe throat cancer, Jim had only ‘three months to live’ Dr. Simonton treated his very first patient, Jim M., back in 197 1. Jim was 61 at the time. He had advanced throat ca ncer. By the t ime he saw Dr. Simonton, a doctor had given him t he dreaded ne ws: “You have three months to live.” Dr. Simonton turned Jim’s “terminal” cancer complet ely around by t eaching h im how to use his imagination to create mental imag es in three key areas: 1) Health y images of his body’s healing mechanisms 2) Health y images of th e treatme nt he was receiving 3) Health y images of cancer as a disease That third point ma y seem odd. After all, how can you create a “he alth y” image of something as ugly and dangerous as cancer? C h a p t e r F i v e The legendary doctor who harnesses his patients’ mind power to whip ‘hopeless’ cases of cancer"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"31 As Dr. Simonton explains, most cancer patients have an unhe althy image of the disease. They believe cance r is a pow erf ul and deadly foe that’s difficult o r impossible to beat. The y may visualize cance r as some kind of juggerna ut or steamroller that’s going to run them over. This kind of imagery is bad because it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. But as Dr. Simonton explains, cancer isn’t as strong as mos t people believe it is. In fact, he says cance r cells are actually weak, deformed, and confused . No cancer cell has ever been known to attack a healthy cell. Can cer can’t even grow very well inside a strong, healthy body. Cancer can only thrive inside a weake ned, unhealthy body. It’s that simple. Within a month, tests showed Jim had no eviden ce of cancer in his body. Just as surprising, he had no side effects from the hig h- dose radiation he was receiving. Following this victory, Dr. Simonton we nt on to heal countless patients using the same counseling meth od. Bob, with abdominal cancer, was at the ‘end stage’ In 1974 Dr. Simonton began working with ano th er “hopeless” cancer patient. Bob G., a 39-yea r-old ma n from Houston, was at the end stage of his cancer. His cancer h ad spread throughout his abdomen. His doctors offered him no hope because the chemotherapy wasn’t shrinkin g his tumors. What’s more, th e chemo was giving him terrible side effects. Bob had heard about Dr. Simonton’s psycho- logical approach to fighting cancer. It seemed to be his only hope. Dr. Simonton was in Ft. Worth, Te xa s, at the time. His phone rang, and Bob told him, “I want to come and see you.” Dr. Simonton replied, “I’d be happy to work with you on the phone.” Bob responde d, “I’ll come to your office, and you can decide w ha t to do with me there.” Bob spent three days in Ft. Worth, learning Dr. Simonton’s methods . In just six weeks he went from extensive disea se to no e vidence of disease. He’s remained free of disease t o this day. In fac t Bob won the senior rac quetball championship for Nor th Carolina in 20 05. Not bad for someone who’d been at the “e nd stage” of a battle against cance r he was “losing” in 1974. Dr. Simonton ha s ma intained a close pe rsonal friendship with Bob over the years. He told us he’d spoken to Bob recently. Woma n whips breast cancer and lung cancer with mind power Five years ag o, a woman who’d had two bouts with breast cancer came to see D r. Simonton with advance d lung cancer. Using his methods, she w as able to go through radiation and c hemo with no significant side effects. She’s b een free of cancer f or five years. Dr. Simonton says, “She’s thriving.” As you proba bly know, lung c ancer is one of t he toughest cancers to beat. T he famous TV journalist Peter Jennings c ouldn’t shake his lung cance r — even with all of his money. But Dr. Simonton says, “It’s not a matt er of money. You have to tap into your body’s healin g process.” Dr. Simonton say s this idea isn’t new at all. It goes bac k to Hippocra tes, th e Father of Medicine, who lived 500 years be fore Christ. Surprisingly, Dr. Simont on says our t h o u g h t s affect our physical healt h even at the microscop- ic, sub-cellular level. T he key thought for better health is hope. Canc er’s best friend is the thought and feeling of hopele ssness. “Hope is an essential ingredient in living life and regaining health,” says Dr. Simonton. Dr. Simonton warmly encourages long- dist ance patients to go through his self-help books and CDs. And he also offers r etreats for those who believe they c ould benefit. P atient s who want to attend a retreat m ust first read the two books in his “Patient Package” and start applying the mental imagery techniques."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"32 How to get Dr. Simonton’s self-help ‘Patient Package’ You can get Dr. Simonton’s unique “Patient Package” of lifesaving information and self-help methods.

Best of all, there’s no downside to Dr. Simonton’s methods, and potentially a huge upside. His methods are proven to increase your odd s of whipp ing cancer — even if you opt for standard treatments such as surgery, radia tion, and chemo. Plus you can apply his methods even without having to see Dr. Simonton in person. As yo u might expect, there’s much resistance in the medical an d pharmaceutical e stablishment to Dr. Simonton’s revolutionary and inexpensive lifesaving techniques.

The Centers employ medical doctors, naturo- pathic doctors, acupuncturists, counselors trained in mind-body medicine (Dr. Carl Simonton’s method), a nd spiritual counselors. Th us, the Centers offer stat e-of-the-art surgery, radiation, and chemot he rapy, along with state-of-the-art nutritional support, spiritual care, cou nseling, and other holistic ther apies. And ever yone w orks together as a team to heal the cancer patient. Experience has proven that co mbinin g conven- tional therapy with holistic therap ies makes it much easier for patients to handle the side effects of radiation and chemo. That’s because holistic therapies — such as nutrition and mi nd-body med- icine — strengthen the patient’s immune syst em. Right now there are four such Centers spread throughout the country. They’re located in Zion, Illinois; Phila delphia, Pennsylvania; Tulsa, Oklahoma; an d Se attle, Washington. The Seattle Center is for o ut patients only. The other three centers are hospitals that can accomm odate in-patients. And a new Center will soon be opening in Phoenix, Arizona. In fact, we interviewed the head of naturopa- thy, Dr. Tim Birdsall, N.D., who spoke to us by phone from Arizona. He was in Phoenix prepar- ing for the opening of the new Center. Dr . Birdsall told us a remarkable story about Lyn ette B., who was 34 when she discovere d a lump in her breast. Upon examining her, her family doctor told her, “It’s nothing to worry about. Go home.” Two weeks later she discov- ere d she was preg nant. She went to her obstetri- cian, who told her the lump was “probably just a benign cyst.” Later she learned th e shocking news: it wasn’t benign. She had a vicious form of breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes. A surgeon told he r she ha d to h ave an abortion immediately. He said her cancer was “estrogen- responsive” and that the hormones of pregnancy would feed the disease. What’s more, he said the chemotherapy would hu rt the baby. But Lynette didn’t want an abortion. She wanted to protect her baby while get ting rid of her cance r. She did have a single mastectomy, which revea led that the cancer w as particularly nasty. Lynette was interested in h ealthy habits and nutrition, so she asked se ve ral doctors what she could do to improve her odds of sur vival. They gave he r a variet y of unsatisfa ctory a nswers , such as “I don’t know” and “nutrition doesn’t matter.” Lynette’s doctors insisted that she h a d to have an abortion — no ifs, ands, or but s. She realized they weren’t going to let her be a part ner in her care; instead, she’d be a bystander. Six doctors tell Lynette, ‘You must have an abortion NOW!’ By th e time Ly nette came to the CTCA in Zion, she’d seen six doctors. All six had stubbornly insisted that she underg o an abortion right away before her cancer treatment could proceed. But at CTCA, Lynette found a completely different atmosphere. Instead of telling her w hat to do, the doctors opened their ears and listened to what sh e want ed. She told the m she wanted to protect her baby AND get rid of her cancer. She told them she wante d nu tritional support and C h a p t e r S i x Th e best of both worlds: Cancer Treatment Centers of America"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"34 other natural and complementary therapies. And that’s what she got. CTCA put Lynette’s desires at the center of her treatment plan, letting her be a f ull pa rt ner in all of her healt hcare decisions. The doctors at CTCA realized they were dealing not with one patient but with two — Lynnette and the baby in her womb. They were determined to save both. CTCA doctors agreed with the pa thology report that Lynette was in great danger from an aggressive cance r that h ad spread. They be liev ed it was important to treat her right awa y. Delaying her treatment wasn’t an option. This was a tough dilemma: de stroying the cancer without harming her baby. Fortunately, CTCA in Zion employs one of the few gynecological oncologists in America. Normally he do esn’t treat breast cancer, but he did treat Lynette because she was pregnant. Researchers at CTCA discovered that chemothera- py in the second trimester, if carefully adminis- tered, will probably be safe for the ba by. So instead of giving Lynette giant doses of chemo all at once, the do ctors spread it out. She got the same quantit y of chemo, but in a milder way. This treatment plan worked. Cancer-free Lynette breastfeeds her healthy baby boy! Lynette went on to delive r a normal, healthy boy. Chemo during delivery would’ve made breastfeeding impossible, and Lynette told her doctors that breastfeeding her new baby was important to her and to her baby’s health. The doctors cooperated with her, enabling her to nurse the baby. Today her “baby” is nearly nine years old. And Lynette remains cance r- fre e. The doctors who told her she had to abort her baby were just pla in wrong. Lynette gives high praise to CTCA. Aft er all, CTCA saved her life a n d h er baby’s lif e. She says, “T his is a place of healing. It’ s not a place where sick people go to die.

It pumps massive amounts of oxygen into the brain. It gives you eight to nine times the oxygen you normally bre athe.” It’s well-established that cancer HATES oxygen. That’s why it astounds Dr. Steenblock that most d octors ignore this lifesaving tool. He should know, because he operates four hyperbaric chambers in his clinic in Mission Viejo, California. He can’t imagine practicing medicine without them. Dr. Steenblock gave us a tour of his clinic. And then we enjoyed a fine dinner w ith him, during which time he gave us his views on the best tre atment options for cancer patients today. He told us, “An advan ced cancer patient who’s been tortured and radiated and chemothera- pized and has lost his appetite is MISERABLE. If you put that p atient into a hyperbaric chamber once or t wice a day and give him intravenous Vitamin C, within a day or two he’ll want to start eating again.” Dr. Steenblock explained further, “The hyper- baric oxygen therapy and intravenous Vita min C stimulate the immune system to clean up the debris from the dying tumor. This debris poisons the body and shuts down the immune system and appetite. High doses of natural digestive enzymes would have prevented that by digesting the junk in the body.” Even a cancer patient who looks “hopeless” to other doctors may have hope when Dr. Steenblock uses his natural therapies. For example, a “terminal” lung cancer patient came to his office, pulling his little cart with his port able oxygen tank. He had an oxygen mask on his face and was huff ing and puffing. His face was red, and his capillaries were dilat ed. Dr. Stee nb lock asked him, “What’ s the problem?” The man replied, “They say I’ve got c ancer. It’s in my lungs. They won’t operate because if they take out any more of m y lung, I’ll die. And if they giv e me radiation, that’ll kill my lung, and that’ll kill me. And chemo won’t work on it. So I’ve come to you to see what you can do. They g ave me about a mont h to six weeks to live. Can you help me?” Dr. Stee nb lock re plied, “I don’t know. I’ll try.” He put the patient on a Gerson-type vegeta rian diet, but the man wouldn’t follow it . So Dr. Steenblock put h im on hyperbaric oxygen therapy plus intrave nous Vitamin C at more than 100 grams a da y. He also gave him Tagamet. Dr. Steenblock says, “I was the first doct or to treat a patient with Tagamet and high dose Vitamin C.” The man didn’t die in the pre dicted month to six weeks. In fact, Dr. Steenblock treat ed him for about two years. And he did well. He showed up once in a w hile to get his vitamins. One day the man calle d D r. Steenblock and said, “I’ve got this terrib le pain in my lower abdomen — in my g roin.” The doc tor r eplied, “Get to t he hospital a s soon as you can. ” The man died on his way to the hospital — not of cancer but of an aneurism. He just bled out. And the autopsy showed that his cancer hadn’t g rown one bit during the last two years. C h a p t e r S e v e n The grandmaster of hyperbaric oxygen therapy"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"36 Professor of pharmacology gets hot under the collar The eff ects of intravenous Vitamin C never cease to amaze Dr. Steenblock. He once had a convers ation with a professor of pha rmacology from th e University of Chicago who declared, “Vitamin C is dangerous! Anybody who gives Vitamin C is crazy and should be put in jail. Vitamin C causes uric acid and kidney stones.” Dr. Steenblock replied calmly, “I disagree. I’ve gi ve n Vitamin C intravenously to 20,000 patients, and I’ve never seen it cause kidney stones.” Instead of listening to and learning from a doctor who knows what he’s talking about, this know -it-all professor shut his ears, g ot hot under the collar, and walked off in a huff. One day a good-looking 24-year-old college kid walked into Dr. Steenblock’s office. He said his father was struggling with pancreatic cancer, and he had some questions. So they sta rted talking, and Dr. Steenblock was ex plaining the technical aspects of cancer and h ow the various treatments work. The yo un g man asked deep, penetrating questions about biochemistry. They w ere tough questions, but Dr. Steenblock answered them well because he kne w th e chemistry. Finally he told the young man, “You’re not here for your father. You’re here for the government, aren’t you? Where do you go to school?” The kid was a student at Berkeley and was working undercover for the state med ical authorities. Because of his academic background, he’d gotten keenly interested in their discussion, and he’d allowed his intellectual curiosity to get the better of him. Dr . Steenblock says he was a smart cookie who knew what he was talking about: “So I offered to hire him because I’m always looking for smart pe ople to work with. They’re hard to come by,” Dr. Steenblock told us. Few doctors understand cancer as well as Dr. Steenb lock. That’s because he has a great deal of experience as a pathologist , and it takes a pa thologist to truly k now cancer. Why pathologists know cancer better than other d octors As Dr. Steenb lock says, “As a pathologist, you do a lot of aut opsies. So you get to see how disease affects the body. Everyone’s body is different, no matter what. “When you do a utopsie s on cancer vict ims, you get to know what cancer looks like in t he bone. You’ve sliced the bone and put y our fingers in the cancer. You see how it destroy s the body, how it goes to the kidneys and into the lung and how it acts in the lung. Y ou get an understanding of how it spreads and how it grows. If you don’t se e it and feel it , you really don’t know it. “You see the common diseases a nd the rare ones. You really get a broad spectrum of diseases. Whenever anyone mentions ‘rare’ diseases, I’ve usually seen them at the aut opsy table.” Dr. Steenblock’s interest in ca ncer goes back de cades. T wenty-five years ago, he and his wife spent the first part of their honeymoon attending the Cancer Control Socie ty’s annual c onvention. He didn’ t want to miss the opportunity to learn about the most effect ive cancer treatments for his patients. Ov er the years, Dr. Ste enblock has amassed one of the largest libra ries in the world on holist ic and alternative health . He doesn’t ju st collect the books; he reads th em. There’s almost nothing he doesn’t know or hasn’t h eard of. Through his vast re ading and personal expe rience, he’s found tha t infec tions are a major problem in cancer patient s. “Cancer patients have de ficie nt immune systems,” h e explains, “so they often have infections. And you have to get rid of those darn infections. Anti-fungals and ant i- bacteria ls enhance cancer treatment. “Most doctors still don’t belie ve yeast is a problem, wh ich is incredib le! Patients who’ve seen"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"37 15 or 20 doctors without good results have come to me, and I say, ‘Aha. Yeast!’ They ask me, ‘Why didn’t any of the other doctors diag nose this?’ and I tell them it’s because other doctors don’t think yeast cau ses any problems.” Dr. Steenblock’s darkfield microscope reveals the culprit: yeast! For example, Dr. Steenblock told us about an anemia patient suffering from chronic abdominal pain and a bloated stomach. When she came to him she was dying of pain. His darkfield micro- scope instantly showed she had yeast, so he put her on some anti-fungals. Within a w eek, all of her pain was gone. With a laug h and a twinkle in his eye, he t old us, “Then she went back and told the other doctors what a genius I was. ” The other do ctors could’ve seen the yeast. They just weren’t looking. Make no mistake, yeast and fungus are linked to cancer. As Dr. Steenblock says, “The esoph ag us a nd the iliocecal valve are the two weakest parts of the body. They’re the dirtiest, and they have the most fungus. That’s what you find when you do an autopsy of a cancer victim. You also find swelling in that iliocecal area becaus e of back-pressure from th e liver.” (The iliocecal valve is the valve between the large and small intestines.) It’s important for cancer patients to commit to better nutrition and a healthy lifesty le, says Dr. Steenblock. Oth erwise, “You migh t a s well send the patient back to surgery, radiation, and chemo.” But Dr. Steenblock has harsh words for oncologists who scoff at patients who have a rough time going through chemo and radiation. He says their attitude stinks. He says these conventional doctors need to bring holistic doctors into their clinics to work together and better serve the patient. He says it’s time for the two camps to stop the fighting. Chemo kills the cancer — and too often kills the patient, too! As a pathologist, Dr. Steenb lock did numerous autopsies on people who were cured of cancer but die d from the chemothe rapy. He says, “You see one body after anothe r with no sign of cancer, but th ere they are: lying on a cold slab. You st art to say, ‘Well, wait a second. This chemo and radiation may not always be appropriate.’ The younger doctors in particular tend to be too aggressive with the chemo. Using high doses, they kill the cance r — AND the pa tient!” Dr. Steenblock says that chronic sinus infections are a hidden cause of c ancer and that most doctors don’t know how to diag nose it . It’s simple, he say s. You just tap on the cheek- bones or above the eyeball and ask t he patient whet her it’s tender. Then t ap betwee n the eyes and ask whether it’s te nder. Here are some othe r signs of hidden sinus infections: If (1) you feel sick and have no reason for having c hronic fatigue, (2) if it started when you had a cold six months ago, and (3) if you’ve been sick and tired ever since then, that’ s a sign. Pus is getting into your system and damaging your w hole body. These common infections can kill you According to Dr. Steenb lock, sinus infections can kill you. So can gum disease. Letting these infections run loose in y our body is disastrous. He says the life expec tancy in cer tain part s of t he Congo is 29 ye ars; at 29, the se people look as if they’ re 75. They’ve lost their teeth t o gum disease, and th ey ’re dying of “old age” at 29. Why ? Because they’ve had chronic infections since childhood. “Infections cause aging like you wouldn’t believe, and infect ion leads to inf lammation and aging as well as cancer.” Caffeine kills cancer, if you take it the right way Surprisingly, one of least e xpensive and most"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"38 effectiv e ways to fight cancer is with coffee. “Ca ffeine is a great killer of cancer; it has a direct effect. This is factual and well-established. It’s published. You can look it up,” says Dr. Steenblock. But here’s the rub: Drinking coffee doe s cancer patients no good whatsoever. You can get the ant i-cancer benefits only by taking the cof- fee rectally, through an enema. The idea of a coffee enema may sou nd strange. But Dr. Steenblock sa ys it’s well-e stab- lished in the medical literature that coffee enemas flush toxins out of the liver and stimulate Tumor Necrosis Factor, a substance that kills cancer. For that reason, he believes coffee enemas should be done FIRST, followed by colonic hydrotherapy to clean out the patient’s colon. The patient who called Dr. Steenblock an unprintable n ame The day we interviewed Dr. Steenb lock, he told us about Nedva, a loyal patient h e’d seen ear- lier in the day. Nedva is now 90. Back in 198 1, when she was 65 year s old, she came to Dr. Steenblock with a shoulder problem. He gave her steroids, but that didn’ t help. Four months later when she men tioned she was also constipated, Dr. Steenblock told her, “Have a colonic.” She replied, “O.K. I’ll have one.” A couple of days later, Nedva sa w Dr . Steenblock and exclaimed, “What the hell is wrong with you?” He said, “What?” She said, “You *ss hole!” He said, “What? What?” She asked, “Why didn’t you tell me about a colonic? You let me suffer for four months, and after one colon ic all my pain is gone. You turkey!” Dr. Steenblock is a gifted storyteller, and we had a good laugh over this story. Colonic hydrotherapy supports the cancer patient’s immune system Dr. Steenblock said a colonic, surprisingly, often solves join t pain and back pain in a way that makes patie nts “feel like a million bucks.” But getting rid of all the accumulated junk in the c o l o n a l s o h e l p s t h e i m m u n e s y s t e m , w h i c h i s c r u c i a l f o r c a n c e r p a t i e n t s .

Out of that whole course, there was one paragraph about vitamins: two sentences. That’s it! They’re teaching esoteric, weird stuff that has no bea ring wh atsoever on the practice of medicine.” Dr. Steenblock has helped many cancer patients and will keep doing so. If he believes ano ther doctor can better serve the pa tient, he doe sn’t h esitate to refer the patient to another clinic. But because of the lack of health freedom in America, Dr. Steenblock doesn’t advertise for cance r patients. Nor does he mention cancer on his excellent Website. That’s because he doesn’t want to have a target on his back. In recent years, Dr. Steenblock’s focus has been on helping victims of strokes and brain injuries. His hyperbaric oxyg en therapy and other cutting ed ge therapies enable such patients to achieve astonishing recoveries . What’s more, he’s found that the same therapies that help can cer patients also do wonders for stroke victims. For example, he uses an exte rnal counter- pulsation device that pushes blood u p from the legs during the rest phase of the heart. This stimulates blood vessels to expand and to make new blood vessels, causing increased oxygena- tion of interna l organs. Remember, cancer hates oxygen. That’s how external counter-pulsation gives patients a new lease on life. Dr. Steenblock has set a n ambitious goal: t o live to be 120 years old. To reach this goal, he eats right and inject s himself with stem cells. He also gives his patients the b enefit of stem-cell t herap y where appropriate. (He doesn’t use the controver- sia l embryonic stem cells, which have produced disappointing r esults. Rather, h e uses adult stem cells, with amazing resu lts. He’s on the cutt ing edge of ethical stem- cell re search.) Other doctors have invited Dr. Stee nblock to join their practic es, but he turns these invitations down. He says, “What wou ld I do with out my hyperbaric oxygen chambers? Practicing medicine without using hyperbaric oxygen would be like losing a testicle. ” Costs at Dr. Steenb lock’ s clinic vary, depending on each ca se.

This amazing microscope gives him the super-magnification he needs to see what’s REALLY going on with the patient’ s health. Dr. Privitera has another thing in common with some of these doctors: He’s suffered persecution for not conforming to conventional beliefs and practices. Indeed, the great medical pion eers down throu gh the centu ries have suffered persecution. Most doctors, it seems, stubbornly resis t new discoveries in medicine , even thoug h discoveries are what science is all a bout. Here’s what Dr. Privitera told us ab ou t the lack of h ealth freedom in America: “In California, a doctor is jailed for treating cance r if he isn’t Politically Correct. I practice in California, and I’m Politically Incorrect. So I don’t treat cancer. The good news is, I don’t have to.” Politic al correct ness in cancer treatment, of course, means using toxic therapies such as chemo and radiation. As Dr. Privitera explains, “Sometime in the 21st century, treating cancer will become mostly old-fashioned. Since cancer is almost always trig- gered by nutritional or immune deficiencies — or both — the doctor of the future will prevent and heal cancer by boosting nutrition and the immune system. I have no doubt that elementary common sense will one day prevail.” Dr. Privitera is a doctor of the future — far ahead of his time. He goes on to say, “Nothing is more important in restoring the immune system than increasing oxygenation. Cancer cannot live in a high oxygen environment. Therefore, I use lots of antioxi- da nts , in larg e amounts, which force s oxygen into the aerob ic pathways.” He also says it’s w ise for ca ncer patients to take two to four enzyme s c ontaining panc reatin before meals be cau se “enzymes digest t he coat- ing on cancer cells so the imm une system can recognize and atta ck th em.” He adds that enzymes are b eneficial to everyone — not just cance r patients. “With few exceptions,” sa ys Dr. Privitera, “blood clots are the hidden culprit in metastatic cance r. That’s be cau se clots restric t oxygen, which encourages cancer cells to thrive. Clot s also produce a substance called ‘platelet derived growth factor’ that suppresses th e immune syste m, thus pr omoting the spread of cancer in the body.” What’s the best wa y to detect blood clots? Dar kfield microscopy. As Dr. Privitera explains, “The darkfield microscope is a powerful tool for gauging the pa tient’s risk of ca ncer, hea rt attack, and stroke . I’d like to know why this method isn’t widely used. The fact that it isn’t is utterly amazing.” Dete cting a prob lem is one thing. Solving it is another. Dr. Privit era gives his patients the nutritional suppleme nts they nee d t o solve t he problem of blood clots. If you have any ques- tions about supplement s, you can call Dr. Privitera’ s office at 626- 966-1618. The darkfield microscope has another advantage: it shows th e patie nt’s blood on a giant video monitor. Both Dr. Priviter a and his patient can see the blood magnified 14,00 0 times, and Dr. Privit era can identify and explain the problem C h a p t e r E i g h t The ‘vi tamin doctor’ with the healing touch of a country doctor [Editor’ s note: After Dr. Privitera gave us a tour of his clinic, we sat down to interview him over lunch in his favorite nearby restaurant, which serves fresh, healthy food.]"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"41 area s on the screen. This helps the patie nt understand the nature of the illness and gives the patient a strong incentiv e to comply with the treatment. Follow-up visits will show, on the screen, that the patient’s blood is improving — or that the patient is “cheating” (that is, not following Dr. Privitera’s dietary recommendations or taking the recommend ed supplements). Pearl Harbor survivor says ‘to hell’ with Jackie Onassis’s cancer doc tors One of Dr . Privitera’s most memora ble patients is John H., w ho surviv ed the sneak attack at P earl Harbor. At age 78, another sneak attack hit him: he lost 35 pounds in two months. He was hacking and coughing, which caused sharp pains. The doctors took x-rays and told him he had lung cancer. A few years earlier, John had read that the government wa s trying to put Dr. Privitera behind bars for helpin g patients get rid of cancer. He says, “I knew I wanted him to be my doctor.” So he drove 240 miles from his home in the desert to Dr. Privitera’s office. Dr. Privitera gav e John a urine test that showed the other doctors were wrong in diagnos- ing him with lung cancer. Bu t th e test showed he was pre-cancerous. Other tests revealed ma jor nutritional deficiencies and an over load of iron in John’s system. Every week John drove a 480-mil round trip to see Dr. Privitera for follow-up visits. He followed the program and got stronger. During his treat- ment, John gave this testimonial: “I was pretty low when I started treatment — like two or three on a scale of 10. Now I’m up around 7, I guess. My weight’s coming back — up to 150 from 135. Now I’m always eating. This is the treatment I wanted. Jackie Onassis with all of her millions could still be alive. Instead, she went to chemotherapy doctors. Those doctors killed her. To hell with them.” Thirty-six-year- old’s ovarian cancer wa s huge In August, 19 77, 36- year-old Elizabeth L. was going through a nasty divor ce that caus ed major stress in her life. (Dr. Privit era says, “St ress reduc- tion is ex tr emely important in fighting cancer.”) Tragically, Elizabeth developed serious ovarian ca ncer. The growth was huge. Luckily, Elizabeth was t hin, so doctors could e asily diagnose her cancer by physical manipulation. Had she been overweight, they might not have detected the cancer. Elizabeth knew abou t Dr. Privitera. She recalls, “My u ncle had g one to Dr Privitera too late with pancreatic cancer. We lost him, but my uncle was pleased with the progr am. When I w ent to see Dr. Privitera, I was su ch a mess th at he didn’t even want to look at my blood. Instead, he put me on int ravenous vitamin the rap y and gave me a list of eating instructions: cut down on me at, no c offee, and no drinking or smoking. That w as in November of 1977. “I took 90 nutritional pills a day. I took the tests. I was feeling better. I had gaine d weight. After a year, Dr. Privitera cu t the su pplements back. Today my family doctor says I’m healthy. Until a few years ago, the hospital called my sister every year, asking whether I w as still alive. I am. I work as a bus driver.

Her radiation onc ologist denied that her illness had anything to do with radiation. Sh e was desperately ill — sicker than she’d ever been in her life. It was even worse than her cancer. In desperation, Beverly ca me to Dr. Privitera,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"42 who to ld he r, “Radiation affects th e entire body.” He put her on the path to recov er y. Beverly says, “Dr. Privitera saved my life. He told me his entire goal is for the patient to get well. I’ve never heard any other doctor say that.” Dr. Privitera says, Stop the medical insanity ! Dr. Privitera offers this thought about toxic therapies: “One of the most toxic drugs is the chemo drug 5 FU. One of the side effects is death. It’s writte n right in the fine print. I wonder how many doctors tell their patients about the side effects. “You don’t give chemo or radiation to a well person, but conventional medicine doesn’t hesi- tate to give these to a sick person — as a first hope rather than as a last resort!” He says chemo and radiation tear the immune system down. To whip cancer, the patient must build the immune system up! To back up his point, Dr. Privite ra quotes Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine: “‘Leave your drug s in the chemist’s pot if you ca n heal the pat ient with food.’ In oth er words, use nutrition and foods first, and drugs last.” Dr. Privitera takes seriously the Hippocratic Oath he took when he graduated from me dical school. With all the other graduates, he raised his right hand and swore to work “for the good of the sick, to the utmost of my power.” Too many doctors toda y violate the Hippocratic Oath on a daily basis. Here’s how the Oath ends: “If I keep this Oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all men and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my lot.” Dr. Privitera’s healing touch saves a dying teenage beauty Besides his vast knowledge and experience, Dr. Privitera has the healing touch of a country doctor. A beautiful teenag e girl (whose initials are B.B.) was dying. She couldn’t overcome her eating disorders: anorexia a nd b ulimia. Convent ional doctors wer e unab le to help her. She was going dow nhill fast — losing weight and even her hair. Her parents were at the end of their rope . In desperation and a s a last resor t, they went to see Dr. Priviter a — t he “vitamin doctor.” B.B. says, “Other doc tors talked to my pa rents about me in my presence. Dr. Privitera didn’t talk to my mother. He talked to me. He wouldn’t force me to ta ke pills. He didn’t act like the typical doc tor wh o wants you to get in and out. He was pe rsonal. Long ago a doc tor said I looked like a beached whale. But Dr. Privitera took my hand and told me, ‘You ’re su ch a very beautiful girl. I don’t understand why you need to keep losing w eig ht.’ “Without Dr. Priviter a, I know I could have die d. There wa s no dru g that could have helped as fast as vitamins. I de ve loped a desire to get better. My appeara nce improve d. My color returne d. I built muscle. The hair loss stopped.” When Dr. Privitera last spoke to this beaut iful young lady, she was 1 8, her we ight was a normal 135, and she was entering college as a freshman. With her he alth back, she now has a bright future ahead of her.

The cancer kept sneaking back, app earing in various organs of her body. So between 1971 and 1985 Renee underwent 15 surgeries including a hysterectomy, a thyroidec- tomy, and an unsuccessful bone marrow transpla nt. In 1985 her d octors told her she needed two more drastic surgeries to save h er life: a leg amputation and a liver transplant. By then Renee was weary of all the surgeries, radiation treatments, chemotherapies, and drugs. A ‘Miracle’ in Bibl e class Because her illness was grave, Renee turned to her faith and prepared to meet her Maker. Then a woman in her Bible study class said she knew a lot about natural healing methods. The woman told Renee, “Oh, you can get over this. You just don’t poo p right, and you have parasites.” Renee thought she was nuts! It sounded like the most ridiculous thing she’d ever heard. Then the woman handed her a book, Tissue Cleansing through Bowel Management , by Dr. Ber nard Jensen, N.D., D.C. When she re ad the title, Renee rolled her eyes and thought, “Give me a break!” After all, her doctors said she needed a leg amputation and a liver transplant. How could this woman know more than the doctors? Renee told me, “When you don’t have long to live, you do some pretty unusual things. My hus- band rented a villa on Jamaica Bea ch in Texas for a month. We went down th ere, and a fter about two weeks I finally re ad that book be cause I didn’t have anything e lse to rea d. And it ch anged my life. “At the time, I had an arsenal of indust rial- stre ngth prescr iption drug s in t he bathroom: Prednisone, steroids, oral chemo — all kinds of stuff. And I flushed them all down the toilet! My liver enzymes were shot be cau se of all the Prednisone, and my liver went crazy. It was just one thing after another. And so I just threw all those drugs away and never went back. That was 22 years ago.” How Renee healed herself after firing her doctors When I interviewed Renee, she was st ill com- ple tely free of cancer. She still had both legs, and her original liv er was in tipt op shape. S he was the picture of health. She regained her health by d i s - o b e y i n g and f i r i n g all of her doctors. She concluded that her doctors were j u s t p l a i n w r o n g . And time proved her right. How did Renee heal herself ? She cleaned out her colon a nd g ot her guts working right. She got rid of her parasite s. Sh e detoxified her whole body. And she started e ating right — with special at ten- tion to proper food-combining principles. In short, she followed to t he letter the advice of Dr. Bernard Jensen, the aut hor of th e book she’d read at Jamaic a Beach. C h a p t e r N i n e The cancer victim who fired her doctors, healed herself, and became a holistic doctor to heal others ‘In 21 days you can just about get rid of any cancer,’ said Dr. Renee Welhouse, N.D., Ph.D. In 1971 Renee Welhouse, a Midwestern woman from Wi sconsin, was just in her 2 0s when she got the heartbreaking news: She had canc er — the big “C.” Her doctors said drastic surgery was nece ssary. They rushed her onto an operating table for a bilateral mastectomy."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"44 Having whipped her “hopeless” and “terminal” case of cancer, Renee was astounded by the natural healing p ower of the human body. To say that Dr. Jensen’ s book gave her a new le ase on life would be an understatement. So she sought out the man whos e book had sav ed her life and studied directly under him, lear ning all of Dr. Jensen’s hea lth s ecrets. Dr. Renee thought long and hard about what might have caused her cancer. She strongly sus- pected the cu lprit was the polio vaccine she had received as a child. Cancer: look beyond the symptom to the cause Eventually Renee became a natu ropathic doc- tor herself and entered private practice to share her remarkable health secrets with cancer victims and others. Along the way sh e also earne d a Ph.D. in nutrition. In 1996 Dr. Renee also interned at American Biologics to master the Bradford BVPM® High Resolutio n Micros copy System for peripheral blood assessments. O.K., I admit that’s a mouthful. So I’ll just call it a darkfield microscope from now on. A darkf ield m icroscope is far superior to the typical microscop e a doctor might have in his office. This incredibly powerful scientific instru- ment costs abo ut $20,000 and magnifies the patient’ s blood 14,000 times. It also displays the magnified image on a large flat-screen monitor for both the patient and the doctor to see. Only about 200 to 400 such microscopes are in use in all of America’s clinics at this time. Dr. Renee called her darkfield microscope “ indispensable ” in her practice. This amazing tool, along with analysis of the patient’s saliva and urine, gives a razor-sharp picture of the patient’s health. It’s puzzlin g that so few doctors in America are using the darkfield microscope, which would show them at a glance what’s really going on with their patients’ health. Dr. Renee told me, “ Cancer is just a symptom of a deeper underlying problem. When you identi- fy and solve this problem, the cancer disappears. ” She added, “In 21 days you can just about get rid of any cancer.” And she prove d it over and over — one patient at a time. She helped so many people get rid of cancer that the government took notice of h er. Government officials burst into Dr. Renee’s office to s eize her $20,000 micros cope One day in 1999, g ove rnment agents burst into Dr. Renee’s office and told her they were going to confisca te her darkfield mic roscope. Th ey said it was illegal for her to use it. Dr. Renee fought them. She told them she had a Ph.D. in nutr ition and needed the microscope for her research. S he also told them she was a mem- ber of the research board of the Bradford Instit ute in Chula Vista, California. S he explained that her research for the Bradford Institute required a dark- field microscope. Microscope shows what the governmen t doesn’t want you to see The government agents grudgingly backed off from their threat to confiscate h er costly scientific inst rument. Why wou ld the gove rnment or t he medical establishment c are whether Dr. Renee used a da rkfield microscope? Sh e speculate d that the medica l establishment doesn’t want patient s look- ing at their own blood under ultr a-magnification because they’d see all the junk floating in it — such as undigest ed fragments of prescription drugs, pa rasites, spiroc hetes, and slime mold. Dr. Renee Welhouse sud denly dies in collision with semi-trailer As we were going to press with the first edit ion of t his Special Report, we got the shocking news that Dr. Renee had suddenly died at the age of 57. It h appened on Wednesday, Ma rch 7 , 2007 . At"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"45 10:35 a.m. while driving to her clinic, her car col- lided with a semi-trailer. Emergency personnel rushed he r to the University of W isconsin Hosp ital in Madison, where she died shortly before noon. All of Dr. Ren ee’s patients and co-w orkers were stunned and heartbroken. Their grief was beyond words. Everyone who knew he r felt a deep and irreplaceable loss . Tragically, Dr. Renee ’ s clinic closed following her death. But there was too much valuable infor- mation in t he chap ter a bout her clinic to delete it from this new edition. So we ’ ve reprinte d the chapter with appropriate changes. To make up for the readers ’ disappointment that Dr. Renee ’ s clinic is no longer open, we ’ ve add ed chapters to the new edition highlighting two o u t s t a n d i n g clinics in Reno, Nevada (chapters two and three). Case study: Patient was given 30 days to live! In 1996 a cancer patient named Pam Woolen came to Dr. Renee’s clinic and had to lie down on the clinic’s floor for lack of streng th. She had ovarian cancer with metastasis to the liver, and her doctor had given her only 30 days to live. Dr. Renee turned her cancer around, which insp ired Pam, too, to become a naturopathic doctor. Today Dr. Pam Woolen is in private prac- tice in Monroe, Wisconsin. Sadly, conventional doctors ignore the underlying p roblems that cause cancer and focus ONLY on the symptom: the cancer itself. Jim had bone cancer and was sinking fast Back in 1993, Jim M., a 61-year-old carpenter from Chicago, got the bad news: he had prostate cancer. The doctor’s solution was simple: “We take it out!” So his doctor rushed him onto an operating table to remove his prostate. Jim was O.K. for the next nine years, but the doctor kept him on prescription drugs. The doctor still monitored Jim’s PSA score to make sure the cance r was g one. By 2002, Jim’s PSA was starting to rise — a bad sign. He developed a low-grade fever , for which he took antibiotics . He was losing w eight. Jim de scr ibes his alar ming condition: “I was sinking and sinking and sinking .” The low-grade fever laste d months. His doctor referred him to an oncologist , who gave him various drugs and injections. Jim was still losing weight. It turned out to be bone c ancer, w hich was attacking him fr om head to toe. Jim’s two ugliest tu mors were on his forehead and on his inner thigh, nea r his knee. But he had other tumors as well. A specialist recommended that he start chemotherapy right away. Jim’s daughter tells her Dad, ‘Chemo? NO WAY!’ But that’s when Jim’s daughter st epped in and sa id “NO WAY!” Sh e’d heard of a lady in Wisconsin who’d helped someone get healed of diabetes using natural, holist ic methods. She insisted that her Dad go up to Wisconsin to see the lady, saying, “If it doe sn’t work, you c an still have t he chemoth erapy.” So Jim went up to see D r. Re nee. She told him his cancer was grave, but gave him hope: “I don’t heal. You’ll heal you rself if you do what I tell you. But if you don’t change your lifestyle, you’ll be de ad within mont hs.” Jim got the message loud and clear. He followed the progra m to the let ter and does so to this v ery da y. Jim had aske d a c onventional doctor about a mole on his leg and was told, “It’s O.K.” But Dr. Rene e told him, “It’s not O.K . It ’s got to go!” The mole was actually cancer trying to erupt fr om his body. Dr. Renee gave him an herb to put on the mole to draw th e cancer out. A tumor the size of a fist comes out of Jim’s leg! The big tumor on Jim’ s leg was like an octo- pus. As it began shrinking, h e could feel t he tumor’s tentacles pulling loose from h is groin to"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"46 his ankle. Then one day when he was at home, the tumor just came out of his leg. It was the size of his fist. This left a hole in his leg “big enough to drop a jumbo egg into,” says Jim. But within a few days — without surgery — the hole close d up! Incredible as it sounds, the skin came back together and healed naturally, leaving a fresh new layer of skin. The healing, regenerative pow er of the human body never ceased to amaze Dr. Renee. The same thing happened to the ugly tumor on Jim’ s forehead. Because he followed Dr. Renee’s program, it just came out naturall y, with no surgery whatsoever, and the hole filled in naturally with a fresh new layer of skin. Jim made a commitment to make p e r m a n e n t lifestyle changes, especially dietary changes. As Dr. Renee told him, if he ever goes back to his old eating habits, his cancer will come back w i t h a v e n g e a n c e ! Th at’s because the body has a sort of “memory” of the cancer. And when the body’s environment returns to its previous state, cance r gets the message that it’s welcome to come back. Parasites and cancer are linked, accordin g to this do ctor Dr. Renee put Jim through a pr ogram that clean sed the major organs of his b ody of toxins and eradicated his parasites. Parasites and cancer THRIVE in a weak, sickly, polluted body. Dr. Renee said that parasites, such as the common roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, pinworm, and heartworm, are unbelievably easy to pick up. You can get parasites from food or water, from mosquitoes, or through the nose or skin. Some parasites are easily visible with the naked eye; others are microscopic. To get at the root of Jim’s health problems, Dr. Renee started with Jim’s colon, putting him through a rigorous program of colon cleansing. That’s beca us e death often begins in the colon. So for 70 days st raight Jim underwent colonic hydrotherapy. After that, Dr. Renee said it was O. K. to scale his colonics bac k to every oth er day for a w hile. A colonic only once in a while is all Jim needs now to maintain his superb colon he alth . Instead of gett ing colonic treatment s from a professional, Jim bought a colema board. This enabled him to do his colonic treatments in the privacy of his own bathroom at home — a significant saving. A professional colonic hydrothe rap y session costs between $50 and $100, depe nding on where you live. In smaller t owns , the c ost is lower ; in bigger towns , higher. But Jim’s colema board cost him $250, and with proper car e it should last a lifetime. You might find this ha rd to believe, but Dr. Rene e said tha t someone with a colon in tiptop shape will have a bowel movement about 30 min- utes after each meal. That’s three eliminations a day. Once a day isn’t enough. She said t he reason most Americans eliminate only once a day — or less — is the t ypic al Ame rica n diet, wh ich causes the colon t o become sluggish and lazy. She maintained that the most effective way to get the colon ba ck in shape is through colonic hydrotherapy, a parasite-c leansing program, and a healthy eating plan. How to get rid of the unmentionable cause of cancer Shocking as it may sound, Dr. Renee said the typical American is carrying parasites. Unfortunately, the pa rasites make t hemselves at home after entering us. Para sites, too, have to eliminate their waste, so th ey excrete substances that poison our bodies. Parasites ca n come into the colon through our food or wat er. From the colon they can migrate to the various or ga ns of the body and into the blood. Getting rid of parasites isn’t a simple matte r. It takes about thr ee months because of the parasites’ repr oductive cycle. The absolute best and most re liable way to get rid of parasites is to wor k with a knowledge-"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"47 able holistic doctor who has experience in this area . Dr. Renee’s nutritional counselor gave Jim strict guidelines for eating, which he followed to the letter. Here’s a brief summary of Dr. Renee’s food plan : ‰ BREAK FAST: Fruits and ju ices (no fats, vegetables, or protein). Organic, if possible. ‰ LUNCH: Vegetables together with heal thful fats such as extra-virgin olive oil or flaxseed oil (no protein). Organic, if possible. ‰ SUPPER: Protein togeth er with vegetables (no starch or fruit). Organic, if possible. Sweets are permitted, but no refined sugar. Honey, authentic maple syrup ( not the fake stuff), and stevia are allowed because the y’re natural sweeteners. Carob is also allowe d. You can find more details about food combin- ing as well as deliciou s recipes in two books by Lee DuBelle: Proper Food Combining Works: Living Testimony and Proper Food Combining Cookbook. The genius of Dr. Renee’s eating plan is its simplicity: it enables the stomach to digest each meal COMPLETELY before the next meal arrives. People who eat with this plan, and whose colons are in tiptop shape, will h ave a good bowel movement about half an hour after each meal. And each elimination will feel complete. Did yo u kn ow that’s how the colon is supposed to work? When your colon is working right, it moves the waste out of your body fast — in just hours. A sluggish colon causes ill health because the slow-moving sludge can get stuck in pockets of your colon, providing the ideal habitat for parasites. And the parasites create toxins that drag your health down. ‘Death begins in the colon’ That’s why Ilya Mechnikov, the Russian born bacteriologist and 1908 Nobel Laureate, warned: “Death begins in the colon.” Conversely, the return to health begins with cleansing the colon. Besides clea nsing the colon, Dr. Renee stre ssed the need to help the skin eliminate impu- rities. After all, the sk in is th e body’s largest elimi- na tive organ — e ve n larger than the liver. Like many holistic doctors, Dr. R enee recom- mended that people give every square inch of their skin a good dry brushing every day — t hat’s right, b rushing. You can ob tain the two brushes she recommended — a facial brush and a body brush — at w ww.bernardjensen.com . Just click on “ skin bru shes ” and select the “ Skin br ush combo. ” At this writing, the combo costs le ss than $20. This dry skin bru shing e xfoliates the dead skin cells, which rene ws the skin a nd helps it get rid of impurities. And b rushing stimulates all the body’s acupuncture points. Dr. Renee also recommended hot-and-cold hydrotherapy. For example, she said yo u should always end a hot shower with a cold shower. Or if you take a sauna bath , you should end it with a cold show er to close your por es. This hot-and-cold therapy effect ively moves the blood from the extremities to the c ore. This movement of blood helps the hea ling process. Besides these therapie s, Dr. Renee showed her pa tients how to cleanse the ir livers, gal lbladders, and kidneys. In a hushed tone, the chiropractor says, ‘I can’t legally tell y ou this, but...’ In April of 2 004 , Judy M. fr om Madison, Wisconsin, learned she had an ag gressive form of breast cancer. She’s a high school e conomics teac her with 33 years of experience. Doctors gave he r six months to live. Judy’s doctor got right to the point: “Meet with the surgeon IMME DIATELY!” The surgeon w as a nice man. Bu t as Judy looks back on the experience, she says, “Everything was r ush, rush, r ush: ‘You’ve gotta move on this.’ ‘We’ve gotta get t his scheduled. ’ ‘I’ve got an opening in three days.’”"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"48 And so she was rushed onto the operating table for a lumpectomy. As she was coming out of the anesthesia, she learned that the doctors weren’t sure they got all the cance r out . They said they needed to open her up again righ t then and there! So she went under the knife for a second time on the same day. Unbelievably, the surgeon called her a gain just five days later and said, “I think we got it all, but I want a safety valve because we might have missed something we couldn’t detect. I suggest you be opened up again.” And so he cut open her incisio n for a third time within a week. Judy was supposed to undergo radiation and chemo after she healed u p from the three surgeries. She happene d to mention to a chiropractor she’d worked with that she was undergoing treatment for aggressive breast cancer. The chiropractor took her aside and, in a hushed tone, said , “I can’t legall y tell you this, but cancer resp onds well to holistic treatment.” He urg ed her to see Dr. Renee. He’d never met her, but he’d heard good things about her. It’s shocking that health care professionals like this chiropractor are gagged from telling the truth in America, a country that supposedly has freedo m of speech! ‘Give me three months a nd I’ll prove you don’t need chemo’ Well, Jud y to ok his advice. Dr. Renee outlined the program and told her, “Give me three months, and I’ll prove you don’t need chemo.” Judy discussed the holistic program with her family physician (not with her surgeon). He said, “That sounds fine. Give it the three months. Go for it. Just keep me informed.” After just seven weeks on the program, Judy’s thermographic images proved she didn’t need chemo or radiation. You see, wherever cancer is located, there are “roads” leading to it. These “roads” are called feeder lines. T hey are pathways that feed cancer. Judy’s thermog raph y showed that those feeder line s were dissolving a nd moving far away from where her cancer had been. Judy didn’t cancel the chemo treatment till they called her name in th e waiting room to have her blood worked on. She met wi th the oncologist and showed him her thermogr aphic images. She told him, “I’m not going through with the chemo.” He replied, “Good for you. If I can help in any way possib le, let me know. ” Judy then made a n appointment with the radiologist to talk to him. She thoug ht she owed him an explanation for why she wasn’t going through with t he ra diation tr eatments . The radiologist t humbed through her records and said, “What’s up? We’re a little behind here. We shou ld be starting the radia tion treatment.” Judy replied, “N o. I’m he re to tell you that I’m not going to do the radiation because I’m hav- ing good success with the natural appr oach.” Judy’s radiologist b lew his stack The radiologist’s face turned beet red wit h rage as he blew his stack! He chewed Judy out, basica lly calling her an idiot. He said he was going to call all the doctors involved in her surgery and tell them she’d chosen the WRONG pa th and t hat he wa s going to get he r back on t he r i g h t one. After yelling and scr eaming at her for a while, he calmed down a little and said, “Look, we all ne ed good nutrition, b ut it ca n’t he al anybody. Nutrition isn’t going to work. Y ou’r e going to be de ad in a couple of months if you don’t get on the radiation table as soon as possible. You’re not walking out of this building till w e’ve got y ou scheduled.” It’s worth noting th at the radiologist gave her that war ning five yea rs a go and th at Ju dy is still alive and free of cance r. Then he told J udy, “We’r e going out to the main desk to schedule an appointment r i g h t n o w ! ”"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"49 He got up out of his chair, and so did Judy. The two of them walked toward the receptionist’s desk. It was a Friday, and Judy was weary after a solid week of teaching. The radiologist had beate n her down. She didn’t have enough fight left in her to resis t his bullying. But providentially, the phone rang. The radiol- ogist told Judy, “You walk out to the receptionist’s des k. I have to answer this call.” She walked out to the desk, but n o one was behind it. So she kept walking all the way to her car, then drove away. She never did submit to radiation. Some doctors threaten, some offer support The radio logist was furious to discover that Judy had walked o ut on h im. So he made good on his threat to contact all of her doctors to tell them she was a foolish, disobedient, and uncoop erative patient. When Judy’s surgeon received the radiologist’s bad report, he mailed her a certified letter requir- ing her signature. The letter solemnly wa rned her that without radiation and chemo, “you have an unacceptably high chance for recurre nt breast cance r.” The surgeon said further, “you will almost certainly require a mastectomy.” Instead of trusting her radiologist and surg eon, Judy took responsibility for h er health. Thank God, not all conventional doctor s are as closed- minded as her radiologist and surgeon. Her family doctor and chemotherapy doctor su pported her courageous decision to refuse conventional treat- ment. Judy says following Dr. Renee’s program was tough, but it was e a s y on her body. She added, “Taking chem o and radiation would have been easy, but they’re hard on your body.” Executive rams his golf cart into a tree — it was a deadly form of brain cancer On Sunday, July 23, 2006, Stewart D. was playing golf with his wife and some friends. Stewart is a 58-year- old executive w ith a Milwaukee foundry. Unexpectedly, he ra mmed his cart right into a tree and bounced ou t of it onto the grass. Doctors in the foursome behind him saw what happened and came over to help. They asked, “Are you O.K.? What happened?” Stewart t old them, “I didn’t see it. But I’m O. K.” They told him h e wasn’t O.K. and needed to get to the eme rgency room right a way. A CAT scan and an MRI revealed an unident ified mass on the right occipital lobe of h is b rain. The doctors wou ld’ve wheeled him into surgery the next morning, but they had to wait a week so he could wea n h imself off the prescrip- tion drug he was taking. So the surgery took pla ce on Ju ly 23, 200 6. The su rgeons discovered that the unidentified mass was glioblastoma multiforme — a deadly form of brain cancer. After the operation Ste wart went home for four weeks. Then he started six wee ks of radiation and chemo, followed by four weeks of re st. A friend tells him about Dr. Renee During those f our we eks, a friend asked him what he was doing about h is b rain cancer. The friend told h im, “You’ve g otta talk to th is lady ne ar Madison.” Stewart t ook his friend’s advice and saw Dr. Rene e. He never went back for his next round of chemo or radiation. The whole process of natural healing fascinated him. He told me he feels great . His last t wo MRIs were negative. And he has lost more than 30 pounds — an unexpected benefit of following the program. Regarding Dr. Renee ’ s program, Stewart’s radiation oncologist t old Stewart , “They never taught u s any of this in medical school.” But his chemotherapy doctor took a diffe rent v iew: he was miffed that Stewart wouldn ’ t undergo the ne xt round of ch emo.

A nurse who’d seen too many patients die from cancer t r e a t m e n t s Eve W., a nurse from central Wisconsin, noticed a dark vaginal discharge in May, 2004. It was ovarian ca ncer with metastasis to the liver. Her doctors reco mmended surgery, radiation, and chemo. They scheduled her for surgery. But she didn’t buy their recommendations. She refused surgery. Having seen too many cancer patients die from surgery, radiation, and chemo, Eve had always said that if she ever got cance r, she’d try an alternative treatment. That time had come. Eve heard about an alternative clinic in Windsor, Wisconsin, and decided to go there. Dr. Renee saw Eve the same day sh e called because she knew cancer patients need hope and assurance. Dr. Renee told Eve and her hu sb and that she was seriously ill. Because Eve had b een going about her normal activities, she hadn’t fully real- ized how sick she was. She received instructions about lifestyle changes and went home to follow the program. When s he returned for a follow-up visit 10 days later, it was obvious her health was improv- ing. And her health was even better 21 days later at her next follow-up visit. After three months on the program, Dr. R enee assure d her she was completely healthy. But Eve wanted even more proof the cancer was gone, so she went back to her doctors for conventional testing. When the test came back, it proved she was indeed free of cancer. Upon reviewin g her amazing recovery, one of Eve’s doctors remarked, “I don’t know how to treat you with diet.

Suddenly she had a seizure. Paramedics revived her and rushed her to the emergency room. She was diagnosed with oligo-a strocy toma, a nasty form of brain cancer. On Se ptember 2, 2002, she u nderwent sur- gery. The surgeon th ought he got it all, but cancer cells too small for the surgeon to see a re oft en left behind. Then in January, 2003, K ris suffered another se izure. The tumor had grown back, and fluid w as building u p in her bra in. To relieve the pressure, doctors put in a shunt t o drain the excess fluid. And they told he r chemo would buy her some time. Kris’s husband wa sn’t happy about what the doctors were say ing. He began looking for an alternative. He learned about D r. Re nee, w hose clinic was a 90-minute drive f rom Oshkosh. On February 3, 2003, Kris first saw Dr. Renee, who gave her the good, the bad, and the ugly. Kris says it was mostly ugly because he r canc er was se ve re. If she followed the program, she’d live. She’d have to do the wor k. As for the shunt in her bra in, Dr. Renee told her, “Kris, you’ve got to get that out now. That’ s a foreign object.” Kr is h ad doctors remove the shunt. She also went off all drugs, even anti-seizure medica tions.

Here’s what Dr. Whitaker said in our inter- view: Fr ank Cousineau: You have a vast knowl- edge of cancer and how to treat even the cases other doctors call “h opeless” and “terminal.” What advice would you give to a cancer victim? Dr. Whitaker: Well, let me give you my thoughts on ca ncer. We don’t treat cancer. As a matter of fact we discourage patients with cancer from coming here. When patients with cancer do come here, we treat the patient’s general health and add to the nutritional support of his or her health. A unique cancer breakthrough I routinely refer cancer patients to Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski in Houston. Dr. Burzynski has a unique discovery on the treatment of cancer that deals with undisciplined multiplica- tion, which is, in my opinion, the only break- through in the treatment of cancer we’ve experi- C h a p t e r T e n America’s most famous alternative doctor talks about today’s cancer treatment opti ons enced in the last hundred years. [Editor’s note: In 1992, investigat ors from the National Cancer Inst itute visit ed Dr. Burzynski’s clinic and examined the medical records of seven termi- nally ill brain cancer pat ients. They conclud ed that Dr. Burzynsk i’s t reatment caused a complet e or par- tial rem ission in every case. (Reference: Hawkins, M.G. , Fr iedman, M.A.; J o u r n a l o f t h e N a t i o n a l C a n c e r I n s t i t u t e , 1992; 84: 22, 1701) You can call the office of Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D., at 713- 335-5697 for more inform at ion.] There are some things I think can also be helpful. One of them is a very large dose of Vitamin C. Dr. Hugh Riordan has been doing that, I th ink for 20 years, in Kansas, and he recently die d and his medical practic e in part was taken over by Dr. Jeanne Drisko, and she is associat ed with the University of Ka nsas Medical Cent er and has a Hugh Rior dan Foundation w her e they are actually studying chemoth erapeut ic use of Vitamin C. In that therapy, t hey infuse Vitamin C and at the same time te st blood levels of Vitamin C to hit a le ve l of Vitamin C deemed t o be appr opriate for the treatme nt of cancer. The primary reason we discourage cancer pa tients from coming is b ecause it is such a highly polit icized issue. Th e reason it ’s a highly politi- cized issue, in my opinion, is that conventional therapy is no more than a dangerous placebo. So when you have the death rate from cancer, and the incidence rate of cancer staying v irtually the sa me for over a hu ndred years, that is t he defini- tion of a placebo: the rapies that just don’t work but are believed t o work.

Anyone who treats cancer in this country with therapies other than s urgery, radiation, and chemotherapy has put a very large red target on his back for suppre ssion. I just don’t want to do that and I don’t want to live in Mexico, so we stay away from cancer for political reasons. I believe I co uld be a better oncologist with natural therapies than the oncologists a re now with chemotherapy. Now that’s just my opinion. I will never test that opinion because I will not put myself in that kind of jeopardy. Frank Cousineau: How did you ge t into what we generally call “alternative medicine”? Dr. Whitaker: Well, I don’t really like the term “alternative medicine.” If we look a t the term “alternative medicine” and clearly define it, alter- native therapies are therapies that are not taug ht in medical school and not used in hospitals. Now that’s an unstable definition because virtually everything in medicine today was at one time alternative. Everything: antibiotics, hand washing, sterile technique, and so on. However, there are certain elements, for business reasons, that are constantly excluded as medical thera pies. I’m talking about natural products such as vitamins and minerals, acupunc- ture, or low-tech, inexpensive products that would compet e for the health care dollar with large pharmaceuticals that have patented substances and the high-tech approaches that are used in hospitals with surgery. So I don’t like the term “alternative medicine.” I do like the term “good medicine.” That’s all I try to practice: goo d medicine. I do what I consider to be best for a patient. The best way to define our medicine, I think, is to call it “molecular medicine.” That’s a term Linus Pauling coined. Molecular medicine is the use of substances that are common and essential to the body in various dosages to facilitate health and to treat disease. This includes Vitamin C, water, oxyg en, hy perbaric oxygen, folic acid, magnesium, and the whole array of what we know as nutritional supplements. These supplements have only bee n a part of human civiliza tion for about 60 ye ars; a very new source of innovation is t o b e able t o find these active ingredients and actually put them in a dosa ble form. So that describes most of what we do here. Most of the diseases we tre at here are not ne arly as polit ically charged as is cancer. And that is high blood pressure, st rok e, heart disease, a lot of diabetes, obesit y, and the deg enerative diseases other than ca ncer. Frank C ousinea u: A t what point did you de cide that g ood medicine inclu ded all of the things that you just described, as opposed to what you were taught in medical school? Dr. Whitaker: I think t he major t urning point was when I spent a bout six months on the staff of the Longevity Institute under the direction of Dr. Natha n Pritikin in 19 76. He had a n operation very similar to mine. People would come for a residential progra m in which his therapeutic tools were diet and exercise only. So it was a rigorous lifestyle intervention program, and I followed pe ople who we re on that program. And I saw pe ople get well. Patients who take prescription drugs aren’t w ell In conventional me dicine, you rarely if ever se e anybody get w ell bec ause they’re always changing drugs. They a lways have something that they “require” to have a prescription dr ug treat- ment for. People who are ta king pr escription drugs are by definition not well. That doesn’t mean that everyone not taking a prescr iption drug is well, but if you’re on a prescription drug, you’re not well. Y ou could be be tter, but you’re not well. But when you use nat ura l, molecular substances, your chances of creating wellness a re good. Seeing people get we ll solidified the direct ion I would take in my own medical practice. Hence,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"53 we have a residential program. This is not a hospital. Our patients stay in a hotel, but we treat them here. We educate them on lifestyle. Frank Cousineau: Many cancer patients are also suffering fro m conditions su ch as diabetes and obesity. Could you address those conditions? Dr. Whitaker: Yes . Now I’ve written a book on diabetes, and I’ll give you one when you leave. Here’s how I would summarize our approach with diabetes Type I: we do everything we can to reduce the amount of insulin required to keep someo ne under good control. And the tools that reduce the amount of insulin required to keep someo ne under good control are the lifestyle. If a Typ e I diabetic gets involved in an exercise regimen, his insulin requirement is going to drop substantially. If a Type I diabetic gets involved in a diet that is low-glycemic and high in fibe r, his insulin requirement is going to drop. But the area where I think we are most different from conventional treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes is that we vociferously advise and prescribe and put our patients on nutritional suppleme nts. And the reason this is such an integra ted part of our treatment for diabetes is because the term diabetes means excessive urinatio n. And “diabetes” is actually the Greek word for “passing through.” The blood sugar acts lik e a powerful diuretic. So when people have excessive urination, which is one of the cardinal symptoms of Type I diabetes, they are losin g copious amounts of urine with sugar in it and with everything else. The sugar in the blood overwhelms the kidneys’ capacity to conserve water-soluble nutrients. So the diabetic is dangerously low, almost always, in magnesium, folic acid, Vitamins C, B-12, zinc. All the water-soluble nutrients are washed out because they have a nutritional wasting phenomenon going on. I believe that this nutritional wasting is a primary reason, if not the major reason, for diabe tic complications. If you were to put some one on an osmotic diuretic daily that caused that degree of nut ritional wasting that Type I diabetics do experience, you’d h ave the eye problems, the nerve proble ms, and all of the other problems t hat they experience just on the nutritional wast ing be cau se they waste everything. They have oxida ted stress all the time, yet they pe ed out all their ant ioxidants. So in 30 ye ars, and with probably 25,00 0 diabetic patients, we hav e never h ad a single diabetic patient — either Type I or Type II — come in who has be en presc ribe d nu tritional supplements to compensat e for what everyone knows is a massive loss of wa ter soluble nutrients because of the natu re of the disease — not one. It is one of the bigge st flaws I can think of. Not to su pply the dia bet ic with copious amount s of wa ter soluble and freely available and inexpensive nu trients is beyond my comprehension. N ot because I believe t hey work, but simply beca use any measurement of the nutritional stat us of the diabetic indicates major loss. So that’s th e main thing. We tell our Type I diab etics, “We will institut e a variety of met hods to control your blood sugar. But so do conventional doctors. How ev er, wher e we really differ is t hat w e give you extr a amounts of high potency vitamins to compensate f or the loss.” Why Americans weigh too much: culprit revealed Frank C ousinea u: What a bout obesity? Dr. Whitaker: W ell, I’ve just written a book on obesity, and in that book — and I’ll give you one you can take with you — I point out two things. I think I’ve hit on the primary reason why we hav e a pandemic of obesity. What do you think it is? Frank C ousinea u: Diet. Dr. Whitaker: Wh at ab out the diet? What’s so different now tha n it was in the ’50s and ’60s? Frank C ousinea u: It’s the things that people"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"54 choose to eat; it’ s a fast-food nation; it’s the lack of nutritional quality in the foods that are grown; lack of exercise ; and people don’t take th e time to sit down and eat a good, well-b alanced meal. Dr. Whitaker: Oka y. I disagree. Be cause everyone says either what you said or else portion size — or lack of exercise. Right? We are all trying to find why people who are obese in this country have exp loded by about 50 percent. I have those statistics in the book. It’s an explosion, and it has only occurre d in this country. It did not o ccur in France; it did not occur in England ; it did not occur in Italy. It has never been a problem in Asia. Why? Why is the United States so different? Other countries have fast food. England has fish-and-chips restau rants. Here’s the difference: In the 1970s there was a substantial shift in the country toward ca rbohy- drates. The Senate Select Committee on N utrition, headed by Se nator George McGove rn, came out with guidelines that said let’s make starch a major caloric contributor. And the food industry jumped on the band wagon and decided to vilify all fat as the reason for heart disease, obesity, and so on. Yes, the foo d industry took this message to heart. And when you talk about the food industry, you do n’t talk about them advocating the fruits and vegetables. You talk about them coming out with non-fat Twinkies, non-f at desser ts, non-fat milk, non-fat yogurts, and these types of things. So the food industry began stripping fat and add ing the calories in carbohydrate. And the nation followed, and I have those statistics in the book where the carbohydrate increase only went up about two to three percent. And the fat intake actually reduced. And if that initial belief was accurate, we should have had a reduction in weight, regardless of calorie intake. But we turned the nation into a feedlot. And by altering the food and increasing starch intake, human beings exploded. How do you fatten cattle? Frank Cousineau: Put ’em in a pen and give ’em corn. Dr. Whitaker: Cor n. And what is corn prima- rily? Starch. So we’re mammals. We have the same proclivities and the same chemistries, and the sa me metabolism of handling star ch that all other mammals have that eat st arc h. We get fat. Dr. Whitaker’s weight-loss secret: How he lost 30 pounds I’ve lost about 30 pou nds. I hadn’t been eating at McDonald’s. I wasn’t on the fast-food thing, but I was eating a whole bunch of brea d and some de ssert, and now I’m 30 pounds ligh ter because I ju st eliminate bread and e liminate dessert. And now I’m exercising more, so there’s a lot to it. When you talk to someone who’s lost 70 pounds, invariably 80 percent of th em will say they cu t off carbohydrates. The eviden ce keeps sla pping us in the f ace all the time, and we ignore it, and we say Atkins was an idiot. And yet t he pe ople who really do seriously lose weight control their starch intak e. I don’t go so far as to eliminate all starches. I say eat fruit. I’ve never known a nybody who was obese from excessive f ruit consumption; you probably could do it . Apples help y ou to lose weight because the y’re high in fibe r. So eat fruit and vegetables, but just st ay off starch, and pe ople will lose weight. So that’s one thing. How to guarantee you ’ll have the discipline to lose weight Anot her import ant factor is discipline, because few can stay on a progr am. They will r esolve to lose weight , but they will rare ly resolve t o change with any kind of discipline the behaviors they ne ed to lose weight . They say, well, I’ m not going to eat th is; I’m not going to eat that , and there will always be exceptions bec ause there’s no consequ ences to breaking the New Year’s resolu t ion. In my book, I point out how you make a contract with yourself with a neg ativ e conse- quence if you don’t follow through on your contract. And the contra ct ha s some specifics."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"55 First, it needs to be a behavior, not a result. Second , it needs to be time-limited so that you don’t make it for the rest of your life. You can always renew. Dr. Whitaker’s ingenious punishment if he ‘cheats’ Third, there needs to be a significant punish- ment for not following through. I re commend a financia l punishme nt. Let me tell you what my punishment is . I despise the ACLU. I think they degrad e society, so I would never give them any money. So in my contract I agree not to eat breads or sugar desserts for three months. If I so mu ch as eat any breads or sugar desserts in three months, I will send a thousand dollars to the ACLU. Frank Cousineau: That would be a tremen- dous motivation. Dr. Whitaker: It is a tremendous motivation. Then I sign it, I witness it, and I put it up on the bulletin board somewhere. We have it downstairs for people to do this. It’s amazing how much discip line that can cause to bubble up, to where now it isn’t a p roblem. You just don’t do it. And one of the reasons — it’s like if you had an invisible guy behind you with a baseball bat and you want to stop smoking, and you instructed him to hit you in the b ack of the head very hard with a baseball bat the minute you took a single puff of a cigarette — I don’t care how much you wanted the cigarette, you are not going to take a puff as long as you know he’s back there. Frank Cousineau: Getting back to cancer, I’ve seen a lot of cancer patients get rid of their cancer at alternative clinics. The cancer would be gone — three weeks, three months — the cancer was under control. And then six months to a year or a year- and-a-half later, some of these pat ients would die of a hear t attack or stroke. I st ressed this to some of the alter nativ e clinic s. I said, “You have t o broaden your horizons. Wh en you get the cance r under c ontrol, you h ave to follow thr ough with what you say you’re doing, and that’s taking care of the whole patient.” Dr. Whitaker: Many of the people who are trea ting cancer using non-conventional t herapies are strongly into dietary ch anges that I would agree with. So I think if someone is gett ing benefit from an alternative therapy in ca ncer, it is also most likely lowering risk of oth er diseases as well. Beca use a natural approach to reduce cancer is not inherently dangerous a s f ar as heart disease, diabetes, and anything else is concerned.
