[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"T HE C URE OF A DVANCED C ANCER BY D IET T HERAPY : A S UMMARY OF 30 Y EARS OF C LINICAL E XPERIMENTATION A lecture delivered by Dr. Max Gerson at Dr. Jensen ’s Health Ranch in Escondido, CA in 1956 . Ladies and Gentlemen: I came here on vacation; I didn’t come here for a l ecture. I didn’t bring anything. So, I wrote down some things since I was asked to tell you firs t how I arrived at the cancer treatment. It is a funny story. When I was a physician for internal diseases in Bie lefeld (Germany) in 1928, one day I was called to see a lady. I asked her what was wron g with her but on the telephone she didn’t want to tell me. So I went there, a little outside of town. Then I asked her “What’s wrong?” She told me she was operated on in a big clinic nearby and they found a cancer of the bile duct. I saw the operation scar. She was running a high fever, w as jaundiced. I told her, “Sorry, I can do nothing for you. I don’t know how to treat cancer. I have not seen r esults, especially in such an advanced case where there is no longer the possibility of op eration.” So, she said, “No, doctor, I called because I saw the results in your treatment of tube rculosis and arthritis in various cases. Now, here is a pad and you write down a treatment. On th at table over there, there is a book, and in that book, you will be good enough to read to me aloud t he chapter called The Healing of Cancer.” It was a big book of about 1,200 pages on folk medi cine and in the middle there was that chapter. I started to read. That book was edited by three schoolteachers and one physician. None of them practiced medicine. So they put together th at book. I read that chapter. In it there was something about Hippocrates who gave these patients a special soup. I should like to tell you, we use that soup at the present time! That soup from that book, out of the practice of Hi ppocrates—550 years before Christ! He was the greatest physician at that time, and I even think the greatest physician of all time. He had the idea that the patient has to be detoxified with the soup and with some enemas and so on. I read and read but finally I told the lady, “Look, because of my tuberculosis treatment physicians are opposed to me. Therefore I’d like no t to treat you.” Again she insisted, “I’ll give you in writing that you are not responsible for the outcome of the treatment and that I insisted that you do so.” So with that signed statement, I though t, all right, let’s try. I wrote down the treatment. It was almost the same which I used for tuberculosis patients 1-7 which I had worked out and used at the University Clinic in Munich with Pr of. Sauerbruch. After the work at the University Clinic the treatment had been establishe d and had been found effective. 8, 9 I thought that maybe it will be effective in cancer too. It i s always written in scientific books that tuberculosis and cancer are both degenerative disea ses where the body has to be detoxified. But this latter thought was written only by Hippocrates . I tried—and the patient was cured! Six months later she was up and around in the best condition. Then she sent me two other cancer cases. One of her family with a stomach cancer where it ha d been found during an attempted operation that there were metastasized glands aroun d the stomach—also cured! And I had to cure then, against my will, a third case. I expected to have still more opposition from the medical profession. The third case was also a stomach cance r. It was also cured. Three cases were tried and all three cases were cur ed!"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I have to tell you that up to this day, I don’t kno w how this happened, how I stumbled into that, how this was achieved. At that time I always said that I didn’t know why they were cured. I didn’t know enough about cancer and it was such a d ifficult problem to go into. But once it was in my head and in my hands and in my heart, I could no longer separate myself from that problem. Some time later I was in Vienna. I had left Germany due to the political upheaval at the time of Hitler. There in Vienna I tried six cases a nd in all six cases, no results—all failures. That was shocking. The sanatorium where I treated my pat ients was not so well organized for dietary treatments. They treated other diseases by other me thods and didn’t pay much attention to diet. So, I attributed the failures to that. Then I came to Paris. In Paris, I tried seven cases and I had three results. One of the cases was an older man. He had a cancer of the cecum wher e the colon starts, 70 years old. Another case was a lady from Armenia. This was a very inter esting case. I had to work against the whole family. There were many physicians in the family, a nd I had plenty of trouble. But, anyway, I came through in that case. She had cancer of the br east which re-grew. Every time the family insisted that she was “so much down.” She weighed o nly 78 pounds. She was skin and bones and they wanted me to give her egg yolks. I gave her sm all amounts of egg yolks-the cancer regrew. Then they insisted that I give her meat, raw choppe d meat. I gave her this and the cancer regrew. The third time, they wanted me to give her some oil . I gave her that oil and the third time the cancer regrew. But, anyway, three times I could eli minate the cancer again and cure. And still I had no idea what cancer was. If somebody asked me a bout the theory, just what it was I was doing, I had to answer, “I don’t really know myself .” Some time later I came to this country. I couldn’t get the cancer problem and the cure of the first three cases out of my mind. I kept thinki ng “It must be possible, it would a crime not to do it.” But is wasn’t so easy. When I came here, I had no clinic. I didn’t even have a license to practice medicine. When I had taken the exams and c ould take patients, I had to treat them at home and that was hard work. The patients didn’t li ke to obey the diet, to do it at home. They were accustomed to save kitchen time and not to wor k hard to make all the juices necessary for the treatment as it had been worked out. Now the treatment for tuberculosis was a saltless d iet, mostly fruit and vegetables, vegetables cooked without added water, steamed in t heir own juices, with a heavy pot, no aluminum. The cover had to be heavy and fit well so that the steam could not escape. Then they had to have most of the food raw, finely grated. Th ey had to drink orange juice, grapefruit juice, and apple and carrot juice. This had to be produced in a special machine-a grinder and a separate press-because I found that in centrifugal juicers o r liquefiers, I couldn’t obtain the kind of juice which cured patients. At first, I had thought that liquefiers would be th e most wonderful thing. All the material was there, nothing was lost. But it didn’t work. Th en I found out through a physicist that in the liquefier, in the center, there is positive electri city and in the fluid there is negative electricity . This electricity kills the oxidizing enzymes. And t hat is also true for the centrifugal juicer and the other apparatus. The juice must therefore be made b y a grinder and a separate press—if possible, made of stainless steel. ( Editor’s note: a masticating juicer, such as a Cham pion, might also work, if used only as a grinder in conjunction with a hydraulic press to extract the juice. ) The patients must drink a lot of those juices. They have to have the Hippocrates soup. I can’t go into all the details. The evening would no t be long enough for that. But very important for the detoxification are enemas. I felt that the detoxification as suggested in the book of Hippocrates was a most important part."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Finally, I had a clinic. The patients saw that also the more advanced cases and even some terminal cases, very far advanced cases, could be s aved. They brought me more and more of these terminal cases. I was forced into that. On the one side, the knife of the AMA was at my throat and on my back. I had only terminal cases. If I had not saved them, my clinic would have been a death house. Some of the cases were brought on stre tchers. They couldn’t walk. They could no longer eat. It was very, very difficult. So, I real ly had to work out a treatment that could help these far advanced cases. 10,11 Again, I was forced into it. On the need of where to put the emphasis: reading a ll the literature, I saw that all the scientists treat the symptoms. These, I thought, ar e only symptoms. There must be something basic behind them. It has to be impossible that the re are symptoms in the brain, others in the lungs, in the bones, it the abdomen and in the live r. There must be something basic, or else this is impossible. Already, through my work with tuberculosis, I learn ed that in tuberculosis and in all other degenerative diseases, one must not treat the sympt oms. The body-the whole body-has to be treated. But that is easily said. How will you do i t? Little by little I came to the conclusion that t he most important part of our body is the digestive tr act. For all our intake to be properly digested, and for the other organs of the digestive tract to function right and help in the digestion to the end product-and at the same time eliminate all the wast e products—all the toxins and poisons which must be eliminated so that nothing will accumulate in our system, I thought that this was the most important thing in the tuberculosis treatment. It m ust be the same in all the other degenerative diseases, too. And still, up to the present, I am c onvinced that cancer does not need a “specific” treatment. Cancer is a so-called degenerative disease, and all the degenerative diseases have to be treated so that the whole body at first is detoxifi ed. In my tuberculosis work again, I saw that the liver plays the important role. It eliminates the t oxins from the body, prepares them so they can enter into the bile ducts, and can thus be eliminat ed with the bile—that is not an easy job. In addition, the liver helps to prepare the stomach ju ice with the help of the visceral nervous system. The liver helps to prepare the pancreas, trypsin, p epsin, lipase, the digestive enzymes—all that is regulated with the help of the visceral ner vous system. The liver has many, many more very important functions. One of them is the reactivation of the oxidizing en zymes as we know through Rudolf Schoenheimer. He did the work along these lines. It would go too far to go into that at this time. It is very important to note that oxidizing enzymes ar e at a low level of function in cancer patients. Now let us anticipate the theory. During these year s the idea occurred to me that there are two components in cancer which are of particular im portance. One is the whole body, the general component. The other is a local one, the symptom. T he treatment has to be applied to the general component. When we are able to bring this into bala nce, the local one disappears. What is the general component and what does the tre atment have to do to bring it into balance? I should like to devote this evening mostl y to that question. The general component is the digestive tract and the liver. The digestive tr act is very much poisoned in cancer. How can we handle that? Detoxification is an easy word, but it is very difficult to do in cancer patients. These cases, when they are far advanced, can hardly eat. They have no stomach juice, the liver doesn’t function, the pancreas doesn’t function, nothing is active. Where do we begin? The most important first step is the detoxification. So let us go into that. First, we gave some different enemas. I found out that the best enema is the coffee enema as it was first used by Prof. O. A. Meyer in Goettinge n. This idea occurred to him when together with Prof. Heubner he gave caffeine solution into t he rectum of animals."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"He observed that the bile ducts were opened and mor e bile could flow. I felt that this was very important and I worked out coffee enemas. We t ook three heaping tablespoons of ground coffee for one quart of water, let it boil for thre e minutes, then simmer 10 to 20 minutes, and then gave it at body temperature. The patients reported that this was doing them good . The pain disappeared even though in order to carry through the detoxification, we had t o take away all sedation. I realized that it is impossible to detoxify the body on the one hand and put in drugs and poisons on the other, such as sedation medication—demerol, codeine, morphine, scopolamine, etc. So, we had to put the medication aside which again was a very difficult p roblem. One patient told me that he had one grain of codeine every two hours and he got morphin e injections ... how can you take these away? I told him that the best sedation is a coffee enema. After a very short time he had to agree with that. Some of the patients who had been in severe pain didn’t take coffee enemas every four ho urs as I prescribed—they took one every two hours. But no more sedation. After just a few days there was very little pain, a lmost none. I can give you an example. A lady came to me not so long ago. She had cancer of the cervix and then two large tumor masses around the uterus. The cervix was a large crater, n ecrotic, producing blood and pus, and the poor lady couldn’t sit any more. The condition was inope rable. She had been given X-rays and vomited any food she took in. She couldn’t lie down anymore. She could not sit. She walked around day and night. When she came to my clinic th e manager told me, “Doctor, you can’t keep her here. This moaning and walking day and night is keeping the other patients from sleeping.” After four days she was able to sleep with no sedat ive whatsoever—which had not helped her much anyway. The sedation had worked for perhaps ha lf an hour or so. After 8 to 10 days, she asked me for just one thing: let her omit that nigh t enema at 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning. These patients who absorb the big tumor masses are awaken ed with an alarm clock every night because they are otherwise poisoned by the absorption of th ese masses. If I give them only one or two or three enemas, they die of poisoning. I did not have the right as a physician to cause th e body to absorb all the cancer masses and then not to detoxify enough. With two or three enem as they were not detoxified enough. They went into a coma hepaticum (liver coma). Autopsies showed that the liver was poisoned. I learned from these disasters that you can’t give these pati ents too much detoxification. So I told this lady that for one night she could sleep for seven hours— but only for one night. I wouldn’t risk more! When I didn’t give these patients the night enemas, they were drowsy and almost semi-conscious in the morning. The nurses confirmed this and told me that it takes a couple of enemas till they are free of this toxic state again. I cannot stress the detoxification enough. Even so with all these enemas, this was not enough! I had to give them als o castor oil by mouth and by enema every other day, at least for the first two weeks or so. After these two weeks you wouldn’t recognize these patients any more! They had arrived on a stretcher and now they walked around. They had appetite. They gained weight and the tumors went down. You will ask, “How can such a cancerous tumor go do wn?” That was a difficult question for me to understand. I had learned in my treatment of tuberculosis patients that I had to add potassium, iodine, and liver injections to help the liver and the whole body to restore the potassium. Now as far as I can see this is the situ ation. At first we give the patient the most salt- free diet possible. 12 So, as much salt (sodium) is removed from the bod y as can be. During the first days, 3 grams, 5 grams, up to 8 grams a day o f sodium are eliminated while the patients receive only about one half gram of sodium content in the diet and no sodium is added."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The patients are given thyroid and Lugol’s solution (Lugol’s solution is iodine plus potassium iodide) I learned first through the so-ca lled Gudenath tadpole experiment that iodine is necessary to increase and help the oxidation abilit y. Then we gave the patients large amount of potassium. 12 It took about 300 experiments until I found the ri ght potassium combination. It is a 10% solution of potassium gluconate, potassium phos phate (monobasic), and potassium acetate. From that solution the patient is given four teaspo onsful 10 times a day in juices. That large amount of potassium is introduced into the body. 12 At the same time 5 times one grain of thyroid and 6 times three drops of Lugol’s solution, ½ strength. That’s 18 drops of Lugol’s which is a l arge dose. Nobody was observed to develop heart palpitations from that, even if some patients told me that they could previously not take thyroid because they would develop heart palpitatio n. And all allergies disappeared! Some patients claimed that they could previously not tak e one teaspoonful of lemon juice or orange juice—they were allergic. But when they are well de toxified and have plenty of potassium, they are not allergic. Allergies and other hypersensitiv ities are eliminated. When introduced into the system, thyroid and Lugol’ s solution go immediately into the cancer mass. These ripe cells take it up fast and t hey perhaps grow a little faster but they soak in more with great greed—as much as they can—together with a little bit of sodium, probably. But then there isn’t much sodium left. So then thes e cells pick up potassium and the oxidizing enzymes and die by themselves. You have t o realize that cancer cells live essentially on fermentation but potassium and oxidizing enzymes in troduce oxidation. And that is the point at which we can kill cancer cells because we take away the conditions which they need to continue to live. But now we have to deal with a mass of dead cells i n the body, in the blood stream—and they have to be eliminated wherever they may be. An d that is not so easy! The ripe cells, the mature cells are very abnormal. These are much more easily killed than the other cells which are unripe, not yet mature, and not so well developed. And there are other cancer cells in lymph vessels. These are clogged at both ends by cancer c ells. No blood and no lymph can reach them. There are can cer cells in the glands. They are hidden there, protected from regular circulation. S o it isn’t easy to reach these. At first it is only the big mass which killed. But this dead mass now h as to be absorbed wherever it is—perhaps in the uterus, perhaps in the kidney, or in the lung, or in the brain—this has to be absorbed. This absorption is only possible through the blood strea m. I call this “parenteral digestion.” Enteral digestion is in the intestinal tract. Parenteral di gestion takes place outside of the digestive tract, through the blood stream. It becomes important then to continually carry on detoxification day and night in order to bring the parenteral digestio n to the highest point, even to a “hyperfunction.” How can this be done? I found that in order to bring the parenteral diges tion to the highest function, it is necessary to start with the soil. Our soil must be normal, no artificial fertilizers should be used, no poisons, no sprays which go into the soil and poison it. Wha tever grows on a poisoned soil carries poison too. And that is our food, our fruit and vegetables . I am convinced that the soil is our external metab6lism. It is not really far removed from our b odies. We depend on it. But our modern food, the “normal” food people eat is bottled, poisoned, canned, color added, powdered, frozen, dipped in acids, sprayed-no longer normal. We no longer ha ve living, normal food, our food and drink is a mass of dead, poisoned material, and one cannot c ure very sick people by adding poisons to their systems. We cannot detoxify our bodies when w e add poisons through our food which is one of the reasons why cancer is so much on the increas e. Saving time in the kitchen is fine but the consequences are terrible. Thirty or fifty years ag o (this speech was delivered in 1956) cancer was a disease of old age. Only elderly people whose liv er was no longer working well—was worn"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"out-became sick. They contracted cancer when they w ere 60 to 70 years old and cancer was a rare disease. Everybody knows that. And now four, even g oing on one out of three dies of cancer. Now in the second generation it is even worse. The poor children get leukemias more and more. There is no country which has so much leukemia as t his country (USA), no country in the world. That is our fault. Ice cream is made with invert su gar. Coca-Cola contains phosphoric acid. Is it surprising that children get degenerative disease? These things constitute our external metabolism. Now let us consider our digestive tract. As part of the digestive tract, the most important thing is that we restore the function of the liver— the tissue and the function of the liver. That is very hard work. We give the patients (including als o the tuberculosis patients) liver injections, and since most of these patients need an increase i n the red blood cells, we add some vitamin B 12 . They receive 3 cc of crude liver extract together w ith 100 mcg of B12. In addition when I found that our fruit and vegetables no longer have the no rmal content of potassium and not enough of the oxidizing enzymes, I looked for the best source of potassium in the best composition and the best supply of oxidizing enyymes. I found that to b e calves liver. But we cannot give the patient calves liver because it contains too much fat and c holesterol. As you know, fat and oils cannot be given Therefore we give these patients freshly pres sed calves liver juice, which is made in a special way with equal parts of carrots. Liver alon e cannot be pressed. We take ½ pound fresh calves liver (not frozen) and ½ pound of carrots to make one glass of 200 cc (approx. 8 oz.) of fresh juice. The patients, the far advanced cases, get two glasses a day, even three glasses, and they like it! All this is done in the effort to restore the enter al digestion. When that functions, we add stomach juice (Acidol Pepsin) and we add pancreatin not coated. The cancer patients cannot digest the coated pancreatin. The pancreatin is giv en five times a day, three tablets each time. So they always have plenty of trypsin, pepsin, lipase and diastase in their systems. The blood can carry this around and digest the tumor masses where ver they may be. Now, since I am running out of time, I should like to tell you what we do to prove that this treatment really does work on cancer. 13,14 Number one, the results. I think I can claim that I have, even in these far advanced cases, 50% results. The real problem arises when we cannot restore the liver. Then there is no hope. The liver-the restoration of the liver and its function s-are so important that some of the patients whose livers cannot be restored die some six months to 2½ years later from cirrhosis. Autopsies show no cancer cells in the body. They did not die from can cer. They died from a shrunken liver. Since I give more liver juice and I give more for promoting the parenteral digestion, these cases of a shrunken liver are rare. I think I could do a lot to improve the results. I do not want to go into the problems that patients face when they go home and the family phys ician tells them that they need not “eat that cow fodder.” Or the family thinks they cannot carry through this treatment because it is too much work as it takes one to one and a half years to res tore the liver. The liver cells are renewed in four to five weeks, five to six weeks in older patients. To restore such a liver, you would need 12 to 15 new generations of liver cells. That is 1½ years. B ut the most important part of the treatment, I have learned, is to give the patients a new functio ning liver. Now, for the proof of this theory. I had the idea t o make an animal experiment in which we connected two rats—one cancerous rat and one health y one. We cut them open along the side and connected a blood vessel, then sewed them together: The blood from the healthy rat circulated in the sick one day and night and cleared up the sick body. Thus we showed that with a healthy normal metabolism you can cure cancer. You can cure the cancerous rat with the healthy body of the normal rat. But we are in the early stages of t his type of experiment."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"There was one patient whose husband wanted to be co nnected to his wife because of her very poor condition. But she said no, she didn’t wa nt to have him immobilized so long, next to her, with extensive nursing day and night. When she was first brought in to me, she had a very bad liver with probably hundreds of metastases, als o in the rest of the body. I had told them that I didn’t believe I could do anything for her, so the husband had offered his healthy body. But, even as it is, she is still living and improving. At any rate, with this type of experiment we have had no experience on human beings, only on rats. Our next step to prove the theory was by taking tin y tissue samples from the liver by liver punctures. When time goes on and the patient recove rs, the liver shows microscopically and chemically that recovery has taken place. This is d one by micro-chemistry. There is an increase of the potassium content and iron, and now we can e ven trace the content of cobalt. For ten years, I examined the potassium content in the serum of human beings and I made about 200 curves. But these are not characteristic. On the other hand, if we take a little tissue—a little mucous membrane or muscle tissue with the im provement of the patient, the tissue also shows a return to the normal potassium content. 12 This is of tremendous importance. Two months ago when I planned to come here for my v acation, the parents of this little boy wrote me and asked me for treatment for leukemia. Here is the little boy. He was treated with blood t ransfusions, had been 50 and 60,000 white blood count and his red blood count was down to 1,400,000. He lost eight pounds in one week, couldn’t eat or drink. I started the treatmen t about six weeks ago. Since that time, the boy is up and around, he can ride his bicycle, he is activ e and gained a total of five pounds. The blood count is normal. Lymphocytes are 6,500; hemoglobin is 73; 4,500,000 red blood cells—from 1,400,000! And here is the little boy. (The mother adds: “I want to tell you doctor, he really likes the liver juice, he doesn’t want to eat chocolate!” ) You see, the liver juice, the children really lik e it and ask for more. In the clinic where the parent s had taken the child, they were told that nothing could be done for him but I feel that now we can sa ve this child. (Applause) I have here another patient: Mr. Eyerly. Could you come here? Mr. Eyerly came here to see me. He lives in Salem, Oregon. The man had cancer o f the prostate and it had grown into the urine bladder. He went to the University Clinic at Portland, Oregon, to a famous urologist. He diagnosed the metastasis into the urinary bladder a nd said that they could do nothing. Besides, the cancer had grown into the pelvic bones. This was two years ago. The physicians, including t he family doctor, all told him that he could live only 4 to 6 weeks, especially since all bones of the pelvis were full of cancer. He looked terribly ill when he came to me. His wife br ought him with a nurse. He had made his last will and did not expect to live. Now we cured that. It was especially difficult. I should like to thank his wife. She prepared the treatment with the greatest devotion. She was wonderful and we could rely on her. In a family where there is real devotion in the app lication of this treatment, we can even save these far advanced cases. Of course, we cannot save all of them but we can save more than we sometimes even consider possible. (Question from the audience: “How long did it take?”) In the urinary bladder, it didn’t take but a few we eks and there was no longer any blood and pus, nor in the stools either. But in the pelvi s there were hundreds of spots, and that takes a long time because the body transforms this cancer f irst into so-called osteoplastic areas, not an osteolytic process which is bone reducing. With my treatment more bone is produced. The body produces more bone, and then the hypertrophic bone is transformed into normal bone tissue. Then there is no more pain."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Now the patient can get around and is even the mana ger of a company. By chance I had these two patients here and could show them to you. Post-Lecture Questions and Answers Q. Can fibroid tumors be dissolved in the same mann er? A. Fibroid tumors are mostly benign. Benign tumors take 10 to 20 times as much time to absorb as malignant tumors. This goes for adhesions and sc ars. Fibroid and benign tumors are dissolved only very slowly because they are not abnormal. It is difficult for the parenteral system to bring its digestive powers to bear on these benign tumors . But when they turn malignant, then they are quickly dissolved. Q. (from a doctor) Dr. Gerson, when I visited your hospital in 1946 your housekeeper was drinking fresh carrot juice. She had had an inopera ble cancer of the pancreas. Please tell us about her. She was doing very well for such a bad conditi on. A. She is living and in good condition now, 10 year s later. Q. Is cancer a state of reaction of unrestrained ex cessive factors of certain hormones working on various degenerated organs or tissues? A. No, I don’t think so. There is much more and to answer that question, I have to go deeper into the problem. We have to separate the state of pre-c ancerous condition from the state where the cancer appears. In the pre-cancerous condition, all is prepared. The liver is sufficiently damaged and the other organs of the intestinal tract are da maged enough and then later the symptoms appear. Until then we have the pre-cancerous condit ion and this condition cannot be cured with hormones and enzymes, etc. We can to a certain degr ee stimulate the liver with hormones. We can stimulate the liver with cortisone. We can stim ulate the liver with adrenalin etc., but then we take out the last reserves. We empty the liver inst ead of refilling it. What we have to do in cancer -a degenerative, deficiency disease- is to refill t he organs which are empty and poisoned. Therefore it is almost a crime to give cortisone an d the other stimulants which will take away the last reserves and improve the condition for a short while only. Q. Why are all berries prohibited? A. Some of the patients are hypersensitive, especia lly in the beginning, against berries which are a little difficult to digest. Therefore I cut them out. Q. Are tomatoes OK? A. Tomatoes are OK. Q. Soy products and soy beans are forbidden. But is lecithin forbidden, which is made from soy beans? A. Since soy beans contain fats, I had to forbid th em. Cancer patients are not able for a long time to digest fats to the end products. When some inter mediate substances are left in the body, they work as carcinogenic substances. Therefore we had t o cut out fats, oil, and goods containing them for a long time. Q. What metabolic tests do you do before and after to further prove recovery systematically as well as clinically? A. I examine in all these case the urine, the compl ete blood count, basal metabolism or protein- bound iodine, and potassium in serum and tissue. To see how the liver functions, I found it best to examine the end product of the protein metabolism, urea nitrogen and uric acid. When these are normal and stay normal, then I assume that the pati ent is all right. But potassium in serum does not give a characteristic picture and makes it diff icult to judge. The patient can be cured yet the serum potassium still shows low because the tissues take it away. In some of the cancer patients when they arrive as terminal cases, potassium is ab ove normal! One of the physicians asked me once, “Are you crazy? With the potassium above norm al, you give such big doses of potassium?”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"And I said, “Yes, sir, I am not crazy. The patient is losing the potassium. 12 That is how it is increased in the serum.” Q. Is fat-free lecithin OK? A. Yes. But not in the beginning. After six weeks, fat-free lecithin is OK. Q. How harmful is coffee as a drink? A. Coffee as a drink can be used by the patients on ly when they take the castor oil because coffee increases the motility of the stomach so the castor oil moves more quickly out of the stomach. But otherwise, coffee as a drink disturbs the funct ion of the capillaries and therefore it has to be cut out. Q. Would not detoxification be advisable in the maj ority of illnesses? Is this not comparable to what is called “a cleansing program?” A. We have to detoxify the body in all degenerative diseases, in acute diseases too. But not to the extent as is required in cancer. Even most of the a rthritis cases are not so toxic. I found that almost all of the arthritis cases have a weak liver or damaged liver. This is also true of coronary disease. Q. Are (synthetic) vitamin and mineral supplements OK? A. No, they are wrong because calcium and many othe r minerals cannot be added so easily. They bring the system out of harmony. With calcium you c an produce cancer. I was forced in three cases of hemophilia to give calcium to bring the bl ood to coagulate. I did it but the cancer regrew and I lost all three cases. No calcium, no magnesi um, no other minerals. I tried it. There must be harmony in our body under the law of totality. One should not change the mineral metabolism, especially not in cancer. Only the two most importa nt minerals potassium and sodium must be balanced. This is the need of the cancer patient. Q. In John Gunther’s book, Death Be Not Proud, ment ion is made of your treatment as used on John Gunther’s son. Spectacular results were obtain ed at first but then there was a relapse and the patient died. Could you have cured this case witho ut the regular MD’s interference? A. I will tell you why this poor boy died. He had a terrible brain tumor growing out of the skull, larger than my fist. I cured that. It’s written in the book. But after that, the boy had an eczema and this eczema was of a special type which can usually be cured by giving the anterior lobe pituitary extract, a hormone. The family doctor, Dr. Traeger, said, “Why don’t you give it to him?” But I told him that this is a terrible risk and I don’t l ike to take such a risk with the life of that boy. When we give the pituitary, like many other hormone s we may kill. But finally I gave in and it was my fault. And for a long time after that I coul dn’t sleep nights. I gave him the hormone and the tumor regrew. I can add to that, that more than 12 years ago now, there appeared an article by a professor in Chicago that cancer patients benefit from administration of sex hormones. I gave it first to three patients, then to five. They reacted well for the first two to three months. Then I gav e it to 25 more. They all reacted well for three to f our months but after five months they went downhill. I lost 25 of my best cancer cases. Only s ix I could save again. That was the disaster from the hormone treatment. The Gunther boy was ano ther disaster. That was not necessary. I want to reemphasize that we must not give the cance r patient “a little something” for temporary relief. I learned that the hard way. Q. Your treatment worked in advanced cases of cance r of the liver? A. If more than half to three-quarters of the liver is gone, you can’t restore its function enough to save the patient. You may save them for half a year to a year, but then the liver may shrink and the patients die of a shrunken liver, cirrhosis of the liver. The liver is such an important organ tha t when it has to eliminate its own cancer, this has t o be done by the healthy liver tissue. But the process of elimination can damage the healthy liver tissue if we don’t detoxify constantly day and night, especially in these cases."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Now about three or four months ago a case came to m e from Philadelphia. She told me when her son and. brother brought her i n that she had suffered from cancer of the rectum. At first the doctors didn’t want to operate , then they couldn’t. It was too late. Then she spent a half year at the Hoxey Clinic, and then she came home with a liver full of cancer, and hard as a board. I told her son and brother that th is was too much, it wouldn’t go. Take her home and make her comfortable. But they insisted I must try. And I did. And she is doing well! She can eat and drink, and the anterior part of her liver i s a scar, hard as though it were calcified. Probabl y there is enough liver left. The son asked when they took her home after eight weeks, “You see, why didn’t you want to take her?” At least for four weeks, every two hours and sometimes even every hour, she took coffee enema and castor oil en emas twice a day! She had so much gas and eliminated such large amounts of evil-smelling mass es. When she left, we had to paint the room. It couldn’t be washed off the paint. (Comment by M.C.: “I may say that I have looked thr ough a lot of these places in a general way. I have been through Dr. Gerson’s sanatorium on thre e different occasions and spent each time eight or ten days. I saw cases come in there by amb ulance, on stretchers—just like Dr. Gerson said -hopeless metastatic cancers of the liver, the intestines, with obstructions, getting morphine every three to four hours. To my amazement within t en days these same patients would be walking around, free from pain. I was so amazed I c ouldn’t understand it. It was so incredible that I made my son who was a senior in medical school co me back with me to see these things. But it was not only cancer. I saw cases there of other deg enerative diseases of all types.”) Q. Is folic acid treatment contra-indicated during treatment of cancer? A. Yes, (synthetic) folic acid did damage. Q. Can arthritis be cured by the same treatment whi ch you use for cancer? A. Yes. The treatment is not specific. It is not a specific treatment for cancer. Q. How do you account for the fact that many skin c ancers and some other cancers can be surgically removed and they never regrow or recur, even though no metabolic changes have been made? A. Some patients have only temporary damage of the liver and the liver is then able to restore itself. But that is not in a majority of the cases. Sometimes if you remove, say a breast cancer, the removal of these toxins and poisons which the cance r itself generates is sufficient in some cases to relieve the temporary damage from the liver. The n the liver can recover. But these are the exceptions. And it is not basic. Also some of these patients get recurrences later. Many of my patients, after an initial operation, had stayed we ll for three or sometimes even five years. Then the cancer recurred. They were inoperable and ortho dox medicine was helpless. Q. Would it not be advantageous for the cancer pati ents to remain permanently on a vegetarian diet for the rest of their lives? A. That depends on how far the liver can be restore d. If it can be restored entirely, after say 1½ years, we tell the patients only to avoid fats and salt. Otherwise they are free. Many of them lead normal lives. But I’d like to say that about 75% li ke to stay more or less on the diet, and some even convince the other members of their families t o stay on it with them. For instance, we have a photograph here in Escondido of Mr. Walter Wagg. He had a 100% incurable disease, progressive muscular dystrophy. He had been in the best clinics and could get no help. I cured him. Then his wife wanted to have another baby and they were able to have one. Later he came to where I was spending my vacation and showed me his wife and the baby. He told me that the whole family sticks to the diet and said he would s tay with it as long as he lived since he is in such fine condition."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Q. What can be done for impaired lymph circulation following surgery in one arm for what was diagnosed as cancer? A. It is very difficult to absorb these scars so th at the lymph circulation can be restored, a very difficult task. It takes years. Q. What is your conception of a prolonged fast or p eriodical three-day fast? A. You can’t let the cancer patient fast. In the ca ncer patient the body is so depleted, if you let them fast they go downhill terribly. Q. What would you consider more important, diet or balanced emotions? A. The balanced emotional condition is very importa nt but without the diet and the detoxification you cannot heal. Q. Would Parkinson’s disease respond to a treatment similar as that for cancer? A. What is destroyed in the central nervous system— and Parkinson’s disease is a disease of the basal centers—is destroyed forever. But you are abl e to help the arteries in the brain with the treatment, and you can stop the progression, and yo u can restore what is not yet entirely destroyed. Q. Does anemia contribute to cancer? A. Sometimes it is a pre-condition to cancer, espec ially a certain type of anemia, not the so-called secondary anemia. Q. Can too much vegetable juice cause alkalinity? A. No. Q. Dr. Otto Warburg advises increased intake of oxy gen. A. Oxygen would not go into the system so easily. Y ou must have oxidizing enzymes, you must have more potassium, you must have the conditions u nder which oxygen can function. Q. What vitamins are OK to take with your treatment ? A. With the vitamins we have a similar situation as we saw with the hormones. I damaged patients with vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B and B 6. Patients get really damaged. Vitamin A and D is picked up by the cancer cells immediately. Niacin we can use, that is B 3 . (Editor’s Note: the Gerson Diet is extremely high in natural vitami ns. Cancer patients are probably very sensitive to overdosage with synthetic vitamin preparations.) Q. What do you think of deep manipulation? A. Cancer patients should not be massaged. Rubbing of the skin to open the capillaries and to help the body to stimulate the circulation is very valuable. We give the patient a rub two or three times a day before meals with a solution of ½ glass water with two tablespoons rubbing alcohol and two tablespoons of wine vinegar. To rub the who le body is very refreshing and helps the circulation. Q. Can a person with a colostomy take the same type of coffee enema as a regular patient? A. Yes. Q. What are the principles of the coffee enema? A. It opens the bile ducts. This is the principle. Q. How can we prevent cancer? A. Cancer must be prevented by preventing damage to the liver. The basic measure of prevention is not to eat the damaged, dead, poisoned food whic h we bring into our bodies. Every day, day by day, we poison our bodies. The older people still h ave a better liver and resistance from the food they had when they were young. The younger people g et worse and the babies, now the second generation on canned baby foods, are still worse. T hey get leukemias. First of all, eat as much as you can of raw food, keep the potassium level up, a nd take some iodine."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" NOTES AND REFERENCES 1. F. Sauerbruch, A.
