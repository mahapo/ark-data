Their March 1986 alert to the federal government, that AIDS was a deliberate biological attack spawned by Soviet agents working in Western research laboratories, is specially pointed out. Heroic efforts by Dr. John Seale and other scientists to alert the medical research community to the true source of AIDS is specifi- cally recognized and gratefully acknowledged. Continuing efforts by Dr. William C. Douglass to \"tell it like it is\" on the AIDS crisis is specially pointed out. His permission to extract and present an excerpt from his research, pointing out tested healing of viral infections by UV irradiation of the blood, is deeply appreci- ated. The unyielding and continuing efforts of Dr. Eva Snead, to alert the national authorities to the fact that there is more to AIDS than meets the eye, is also particularly recognized and appreciated. Decades of effort by John Crane to bring Royal R. Rife's work out of suppression are specifically recognized and appreciated.

Box 1649, Green- ville, Texas 75401, 1986), I specifically pointed out that I was of necessity neglecting the biological warfare (BW) aspects. I intended to later write a second book covering the BW aspects. This book contains the most important item of that planned second book, including the photobiology aspects of BW. The material is put down in great haste, for it is meant to serve as an urgent warning. There is no time to do the six months additional research and compilation necessary to \"flesh it out\", sculpture it and meticulously document it, as should be done by a careful scholar. I apologize to the reader for this lowered standard, but in this case the basic information is far more important than scholarship. Further, I acknowledge the fundamental contributions of Dr. Robert B. Strecker, M. D., Ph. D., who together with his brother Ted, has for some time urgently called attention to the terrible threat posed by the AIDS epidemic. I specifically acknowledge his important warning, \"This is a Bio- Attack Alert,\" Mar. 28,1986, which was sent to the U. S. President and Vice-President, Governors of the states, various federal agen- cies such as Departments of State, Defense, and Agriculture; National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency; and three members of Congress. Dr. Strecker has also strongly pointed out the covert involvement of Soviet and other communist agents in the epidemic, and the absolute necessity for an electromagnetic solution. Also recognized are the efforts of the other medical scientists, such as Dr. John Seale, M.D., and Dr. Eva Snead, who have tried 1"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Foreword repeatedly to call attention to the nature of the AIDS initiation, only to have their submitted papers resoundingly rejected by important journals such as New Scientist, The Lancet, etc. Work by Dr. William C. Douglass in alerting the public to the no- nonsense truth about aids is particularly recognized. His monthly newsletter, The Cutting Edge, is an oasis of clarity sharply stand- ing out in a sea of misinformation. Permission to reproduce his published research article on UV irradiation of the blood to success- fully heal viral infections is deeply appreciated. The continuing efforts of Dr. Andrija Puharich and Dr. Robert Beck to assist in achieving an AIDS solution are pointed out and recog- nized. Important contributions by Ed Skilling are also recognized in this regard. The vital and extensive contributions of Christopher Bird are par- ticularly acknowledged. Chris has unstintingly and unselfishly shared with me the results of his enormous research on the Priore device and affair and the results of his translations from the French. He has most graciously permitted me to publish his important summary of the Priore affair, and I am greatly in his debt. The reader will find that material most illuminating, and well may be shocked at the depth and malevolence of the scientific and political suppression of Priore's rigorously demonstrated electromagnetic cure for cancer, leukemia, and other killer diseases. Special acknowledgement is made to Robert Whitney, who so nobly labored to bring the Priore technology into the mainstream of medical treatment, only to be ruthlessly suppressed in his efforts. Photographs of the Priore machine were furnished by Bob from his collection. My special thanks to colleagues John Bedini, Frank Golden, Andrew Michrowski, George Fencl, Ken Moore, Tom McLaughlin, Joe Par- rott and Randy Davidson, without whose assistance this project could not have been accomplished. The material in this present small book is intended to be of any assistance possible to certain brave colleagues who — with little or 2"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Foreword no funds or resources except what they can tear out with their bare hands — are already laboring around the clock to develop a perma- nent solution to the AIDS problem. As a matter of discretion, I shall not mention the names of those colleagues. The solution sought is radical, by orthodox assessment. Yet it is the only possible approach that has any chance whatsoever of succeeding. What they are doing, I cannot do. If they do not succeed, no one can. But I will say this, and most strongly: In my view, the only hope for humanity lies in the work they are doing, and they have my utmost admiration and support. Their initial results are exciting and encouraging. Basic phase conjugated electromagnetic \"mixed-modulations\" signals lethal to bacteria, nematodes (hookworm-like organisms), various amoeba, viruses, etc. at very weak power levels have been synthesized and demonstrated. In my best estimate/opinion, these researchers must succeed in two years or less, certainly in no longer than three years, else the AIDS incubation already accomplished by then, and the implementation time delay — even given a cure —together will insure a devastation of humanity unparalleled in all of history. Let me accent that developing this AIDS cure is far more important than developing our entire arsenal of new military weapons. It is even more important than the development of defenses against the Soviet scalar electromagnetic weapons I detailed in Fer-de-Lance. Problems in the Middle East, Korea, and Nicaragua are insignificant compared to the AIDS problem. Desperate Diseases, Desperate Remedies Spurred by the looming holocaust of AIDS, and by the strong efforts of my colleagues, I have decided to release specific informa- tion on how to develop electromagnetic healing, essentially against any and all of the \"killer\" diseases including cancer, leukemia, and AIDS. 3"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Foreword Figure 1. Conventional science cannot do the job. Unavoidably this also releases a major principle of scalar elec- tromagnetics: what is really going on in phase conjugation. If phase conjugation is truly understood and applied, all the Soviet weapons I have pointed out in Fer-de-Lance can be understood, designed and developed. I'm also releasing specific information on mind and thought that will enable them to eventually be directly detected, measured, and investigated scientifically. Unfortunately, this also will enable them to be technologically manipulated for nefarious purposes. However, the developing scalar EM technology for the AIDS cure must not be hamstrung. There is no time to apply the standard \"Let's classify it!\" response. If we do, we'll win the skirmish and lose the war. As shocking as it sounds, I am convinced that the Soviets have already launched WW III, to the hilt. And it's not at all the kind of war we've been expecting. There's no time to rail against the Soviets, who have cunningly and in great secret \"struck our vitals with the mailed fist.\" We've been struck in such a way that, unless we can solve the AIDS problem, in two to three years or less, we are already finished. We have been preparing to fight a better World War II. The one we're preparing for is never going to be fought. The real World War III is already raging. Our death knell has been sounded, and we've not yet even recognized that the battle is underway. 4"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Foreword A great Soviet \"first strike to finish us\" has already been accomplished. The new \"Pearl Harbor\" has already happened. The enemy has already overrun our Maginot Line; we are at our Dunkirk. There are no boats waiting, and there are none on the way. The great Soviet first strike has been delivered with surreptitious biological warfare, not with nuclear weapons or ground forces. As always in the past, we have almost no troops facing the brunt of the first strike and trying to turn it. This time we have far fewer than we've ever had. Just two or three unorthodox researchers. All the orthodox researchers are manning the wrong ramparts. Ironically, this time our entire system—the government, the medical establishment, the scientific establishment, the universi- ties — all are far too dogmatic, and have far too sluggish a response time, to offer any assistance at all. They are simply so \"out of it\" that they don't even know what's really happened. The bureaucracy simply is so stagnated that, even with a giant paroxysm, it cannot change quickly enough to do the job in time. The best response the orthodox system could theoretically make —if it immediately placed the nation under martial law, marshalled all the universities and scientists, everything — would require at least seven years to produce results. A more likely response time is 10 to 14 years. That won't do the job. So the job has to be done from completely outside the system. It has to be done with independent financing. Financing without a lot of conventional, bureaucratic strings on it. Resources must be committed as needed, immediately, not with a several months' approval process. Everything in the orthodox establishment simply has to be bypassed. The government, the medical establishment, the scientific es- tablishment, the universities, everything. Otherwise, we're as good as finished right now. The \"Dirty Dozen\" In the West, there are only perhaps a dozen persons or so that I know of, who are qualified to work on the main task required. They 5"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Foreword are all unorthodox researchers and scientists. There are thousands of fine orthodox scientists, of course, who can help with the peripherals — making and testing viral solutions, setting up and operating equipment, doing interminable tests, all the lab stuff, etc. But only about 12 unorthodox guys are qualified and mentally and emotionally prepared to come to grips with the particular scalar EM technology required for rapid development of an AIDS cure. Right now, there are just two or three of the 12 working on this, hammering away as best they can, at terrible cost to themselves and their normal endeavors. Obviously immediate funds are needed for facilities, equipment, and marshalling that dozen unorthodox researchers and a team of scientists — along with support staff and personnel. An Analogy I'm reminded of a story from WWII. On the beach at Anzio, in a battle lull some doughboys were briefly resting near their foxholes, eating lunch from C-ration cans. A lone German Messerschmitt appeared, closing on them fast and low with machineguns blazing. They were forced to hastily jump into their foxholes as the Messerschmitt strafed their position. The pilot continued to make strafing run after strafing run, low and \"on the deck.\" Obviously lunch was rather totally disrupted. Suddenly, in total disgust a soldier leaped up and flung his half- filled C-ration can into the air directly at the approaching aircraft, full in the teeth of the machinegun fire. Incredibly, the can sailed straight up into the air intake of the hurtling aircraft, where it was sucked into the engine, which sput- tered and died. The surprised German pilot banked his plane upward and bailed out. He was promptly captured by the very troops he had been strafing only moments before. Those two or three colleagues of mine are literally \"throwing their C-ration cans\" in a desperate effort to ward off a monstrous threat. 6"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Foreword Those two or three are striving to the limit of their endurance. This book and the release of the material in it represent my own \"Oration can\" hurled into the teeth of the actual Soviet threat as a last resort. Hopefully we can \"hit the air intake\" of the Soviet juggernaut, so to speak, and stop its progress. The giant Soviet scalar electromagnetic weapons that I detailed in Fer-de-Lance, e.g., are easily countered — in six months or less. Primarily, it is necessary to make a pumped phase conjugate mirror adjunct (PPCMA) that operates at the frequency band of interest, and associate it with a receiver. Once a signal is received from the enemy weapon — say, from a Woodpecker transmitter — it is intro- duced to the PPCMA. A powerful phase conjugate replica energy pulse is returned into the distant hostile transmitter, totally de- stroying it. To meet the viral biological warfare weapon, however, we must develop electromagnetic healing. In an important article, \"SDI vs. the plague,\" Mar. 8,1988, p. 6, the Washington Times revealed a startling Pentagon conclusion that the Soviets may counter SDI with genetically engineered weapons. Valentin Falin, Chief of the Soviets' Novasti Press Agency, is quoted as saying: \"We won't copy you anymore: We'll take asymmetrical means with new scientific principles... genetic engineering could be a hypothetical example. Things can be done for which neither side could find defenses or countermeasures, with very dangerous results. If you develop something in space, we could develop something on earth. These are not just words. I know what I'm saying.\" The genetically engineered Soviet counterstrokes exist and are already being taken. This book tells you what the asymmetrical means, new scientific principles, and genetically engineered weap- ons are. May God help us all. If we do not move immediately and correctly to augment the effort of my colleagues, the Free World and half of the peoples of the earth will perish before another decade passes. 7"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Vaccine Connection CHAPTER 1 THE VACCINE CONNECTION The following quote is from Don Rowe, Wall Street Digest, 214 Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. \"The AIDS Plague will affect society in ways that you cannot now imagine. AIDS is 100% fatal. Scientists and medical research people are not optimistic about an immediate cure to [or] vaccine. They do not expect to develop an effective vaccine within the next two decades. Public health officials estimate that as many as 2.4 billion people (half the world's population) will die from AIDS within the next 15- 20 years.\" \"Economically, the insurance and medical health systems could be devastated in the 1990's. Nothing short of a spectacular medical breakthrough will keep Western civilization from suffering the worst catastrophe in the history of the world.\" The first official U. S. AIDS case was diagnosed in San Francisco in 1981. This followed the puzzling outbreak of the disease in Third World areas such as Africa and Haiti in the 1970's. The U.S. AIDS outbreak at first seemed to be confined to the gay community, such as in San Francisco. No one seemed to connect the apparently unrelated facts that, before the outbreak in the U.S. gay community, (1) the World Health Organization had accomplished substantial smallpox vaccination in Haiti, and (2) West Coast gays — particularly from San Francisco — had made Haiti a main playground and vacation spot. Most orthodox medical scientists have not the foggiest notion why such a drastic \"explosion\" of the virus has occurred. It has occurred because AIDS was introduced by contaminated vaccine used by WHO in its smallpox eradication campaign. A high correlation exists between WHO vaccination and subsequent out- break of AIDS. 8"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Vaccine Connection Figure 2. The \"monkey-bite\" theory. The \"Monkey-Bite\" Theory As the prevailing rationale goes, a naturally-mutated monkey AIDS virus derivative or strain is believed to be the cause of the monstrous plague looming to strike down half of all the humans on earth. That is, a monkey is supposed to have bitten a man—an African —and transmitted the normally harmless monkey AIDS virus to him. The virus is then supposed to have naturally \"recombined\" its genetic material with other viral genetic material and the man's human genes, to produce the virulent new strain of AIDS. Then this new strain, from its single human host, is supposed to have rapidly started spreading through Africa and around the world. That is simply nonsense. In Africa, for example, monkeys as well as other animals have had their viral diseases for thousands of years. If monkey virus were the culprit, African man would have been devastated by AIDS thousands of years ago. He either would have been dead or—as have the monkeys — he would have developed a certain resistance and tolerance for the disease, so that it is no more harmful than others. Understand, the \"monkey bite plus human cell modification\" undoubtedly does occur in Africa with great rarity — once in several thousand years. 9"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Vaccine Connection 10 However, even if that rare natural recombination of the monkey AIDS virus were to occur in a single human, normal contact between other humans and the infected human is totally insufficient to provide any substantial infection rate unless the rate of infection of new individuals is greatly assisted and vastly speeded up by some other outside mechanism — for example, by something like AIDS- contaminated vaccine and a mass inoculation program. Retroviruses and Recombinants As Dr. John Seale has pointed out, \"The AIDS virus (human immunodeficiency virus or HIV) is a lentivirus — a little-studied sub-family of the retroviruses. It is highly pathogenic to man but it differs profoundly from any other virus of humans. It is spreading rapidly in the general population of central Africa, and amongst homosexual men and drug addicts in the West. It is the first virus to have appeared in mankind for many centuries which is entirely new, highly lethal, and spreading steadily from person-to-person world- wide.\" [accent by the present author.] Dr. Seale has courageously pointed out some other very disturb- ing facts: (1) Retroviruses of animal origin, if repeatedly passed from human cell culture to human cell culture, will gain the ability to infect human cells preferentially. Indeed, they may then even cease to be infectious to their original animal hosts. (2) In 1982 Robert Weiss pointed out that, in the laboratory, the genetic code of retroviruses commonly recombine if two of them infect the same cell simultaneously. (3) In a 1984 article in the Journal of Virology, David Baltimore showed an efficient means of overcoming the cell's block against simultaneous infection by two or more retroviruses. (4) Further, Baltimore reviewed how this had widely been done during the preceding ten years! (5) Outside the laboratory, recombination of multiple simulta- neous retroviruses has not been shown to occur naturally in humans. (6) In animals, there is some evidence that it may occur naturally with extreme rarity — indeed, only once in many thou- sands of years."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"11 The Vaccine Connection (7) By the early 1970's, the technology to make new recombinant retroviruses virulent to humankind was already developed and had been widely published. To the layman, the infection and reproduction by retroviruses is peculiar to say the least. When a retrovirus infects a cell, from its own genetic material (RNA) it first makes a \"template\" or pattern (DNA) for forming other retroviruses just like it. It then inserts this \"DNA template\" into the DNA of a cell. The host cell itself is now a \"sleeping factory\", ready to start producing retroviruses. When activated, the \"template\" in the cell causes the factory to go into production of retroviruses. Activation is varied. The \"infection production factory\" can just remain dormant, be slowed over years, take place almost immediately, or be slowed for years and then \"explode\" to rapidly increase the infective viruses. Genetically, the cells of any person infected with AIDS or any other recombinant retrovirus have been permanently transformed. Literally that person has acquired a new set of genes. He or she has been converted into a \"factory\" for producing — and spreading — the virus. Cancer Research Produced Ideal Biological Warfare Agents In 1971 President Nixon signed into law the National Can- cer Attack Act. Though certainly not intended by the President and the Congress, the inadvertent result of this act was that taxpayer's funds were used to research and develop the precise things that constitute the most lethal kind of viral biological warfare. The on-going small effort in medical research laboratories to alter animal tumor viruses — including retroviruses —to replicate efficiently in human cells was drastically speeded up, as part of the new \"war on cancer.\" In other words, whether intended or not, much of our cancer research money was converted into the precise kind of research that develops virulent biological retroviruses for potential use in biological warfare. Not only was the research drastically accelerated, but also the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Vaccine Connection 12 direct participation by Communists and scientists sympathetic to the communist cause was accepted and encouraged. Astoundingly, this open invitation to the communist scientists was issued at a time when one of the high KGB priorities was to infiltrate our recombinant DNA genetics laboratories! To the Sovi- ets' utter astonishment, we simply opened our labs and invited them in. The Soviets participated — and penetrated — with alacrity. It is an obvious conclusion that a number of the Iron Curtain scientists sent to help staff our laboratories were undercover KGB agents. In the cancer laboratories, on a wide-spread scale, animal retroviruses were injected and reinjected into human cell cultures, until these retroviruses had become efficient, lethal recombinants favoring human cells as their hosts. At that point, infection of one or more persons by one of these lethal new retroviruses could unleash a massive AIDS-like plague on all mankind. A single laboratory accident (or a single act by one Communist agent) could unleash the Great Death Plague. Weak and ineffective reference to this forthcoming danger was made in 1974 by the Committee on Recombinant DNA Molecules, which had been established by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. According to Science, July 26,1974, p. 303, the Commit- tee made the following rather bland and ineffectual recommenda- tion: \"Scientists throughout the world (should) join with the members of this committee in voluntarily deferring experiments (linking) segments of the DNA from (cancer-causing) animal viruses to... possibly increase the incidence of cancer or other diseases.\" So much for the great scientific watchdogs.

Incomprehensi-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"13 The Vaccine Connection bly, enemy fingers were permitted — even encouraged! — to be placed on the trigger. Many of our medical research facilities involved in this research contained known Communists, dissidents, etc. For example, see page 106 in Omni, March 1986. Carlton Gajdusek, presently Chief of the National Institute of Health's Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies and Laboratory of Slow, Latent and Temperate Virus Infections, was asked the ques- tion, \"Isn't Fort Detrick in Maryland such a biological-warfare research facility?\" He responded: \"No, emphatically no! There is no defensive or offensive warfare microbiology done at Fort Detrick today. It is the national cancer research facility of NIH. In this facility I have a building where more good and loyal Communist scientists from the USSR and mainland China work — with full passkeys to all the laboratories — than Americans. With night-working U. S. citizens and foreign Communist investi- gators here, obviously there is no \"secret\" bacterial warfare activity going on. Even the Army's infectious-disease unit is loaded with foreign workers — not always friendly nation- als. It is a valid basic research unit on worldwide problems of infectious -diseases in which no classified or secret activi- ties unfold.\" The point is, what was being produced in these labs were viruses that would grow in human cells. Under tight control, these new lethal agents could be safely studied, and many things could be tried experimentally to see if they would slow, stop, or kill the viruses and heal or benefit the virally infected human cell cultures. The viruses were being developed to benefit man by aiding in the war on cancer — we accent this most strongly. However, many of them were precisely the same things that would be developed in a biological warfare lab: lethal new viruses that preferred the human as a host, and against which humans have developed little or no immunity."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Vaccine Connection 14 The Deed Was Easily Done Now one can see the subtlety and irony in the Soviet Union accusing the U. S. of having made the AIDS virus at Ft. Detrick! It's both true and false at the same time. There is substantial information indicating that the AIDS dis- ease is manmade, and has been deliberately unleashed on mankind by Soviet and other Communist agents, augmented by the interna- tional control groups and shockingly inept work by U. S. and European medical researchers. Human cell cultures deliberately infected with animal viruses were carelessly handled in U. S. and European laboratories — carelessly handled in that far too great (essentially open) access to the new viral strains was permitted. Our own scientists were apparently unwitting pawns, and So- viet agents performed the \"final touchups\" to insure release — whether intentional or inadvertent — of the lethal new agents against an unsuspecting world. Viruses can infect bacteria, since a bacterium is a one-celled organism and the virus is a single molecule. Cell cultures where vaccine is made from weakened bacteria could easily be contaminated with the desired recombinant viruses available in the cancer laboratories. To insure worldwide release of the lethal virus, covert Commu- nist agents apparently caused contamination of the smallpox vac- cine that was prepared in quantity in Western laboratories. This contaminated vaccine then was widely used to inoculate Third World peoples and others, in the successful international program to eradicate smallpox. With only a few agents in key places, the Soviets could easily have taken advantage of the looseness of Western laboratory proce- dures to deliberately contaminate the animal cell cultures used to make the vaccines. They had an abundance of agents in the key laboratories, for they were openly invited in and accepted! The Soviets had their fingers in it, up to the elbow.

All that was needed was to contaminate the WHO vaccine by one or more of the lethal new recombinant retroviruses that had been developed — and were continually being developed — in cancer research laboratories filled with Communists agents. The opportunity was presented for a great Soviet \"first strike\" against the West, using biological warfare agents developed in U.S. and European laboratories and administered by an international agency. The opportunity was ripe for the taking. It was irresistible. You can be sure the Soviets took it. It 's Actually Documented! Virus-contaminated vaccines were then widely administered to Third World countries—particularly in Africa, South America, and Haiti. Administration of these vaccines by the World Health Organi- zation is precisely correlated to the subsequent outbreak of the AIDS"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Vaccine Connection epidemics in those countries. This strongly indicates that the vaccine itself was the \"precur- sor\" agent initiating the start of the AIDS infection. In a shocking article, \"Smallpox vaccine 'triggered Aids virus',\" in the London Times of May 11,1987, Times Science Editor Pearce Wright announced that the AIDS epidemic may have been caused by World Health Organization (WHO) smallpox inoculations in third- world countries. In an important article in Easy Reader, June 4, Jon Rappoport reported the Times article and the results of an interview with Robert Matthews, technical correspondent of the Times. According to Rappoport, Matthews informed him WHO itself had somehow suspected that its immunization program against smallpox might be connected to AIDS. An outside consultant was employed to perform an independent study, and the study confirmed that WHO vaccines were indeed — somehow — causing AIDS to evidence in inoculated persons. Needless to say, WHO promptly buried that report—whose con- clusion must have been the last thing WHO wanted to hear. The consultant then came to the Times. The Times heard him out and printed the story. This astounding story has almost startling correlations: \"The smallpox vaccine theory would account for the position of the Central African states as the most afflicted countries; why Brazil became the most afflicted Latin American country; and how Haiti became the route for the spread of AIDS, to the U.S.: Brazil, the only South American country covered in the eradication campaign, has the highest incidence of AIDS in that region.\" Rappoport confirms that the subject of contaminated vaccines— \"vaccines which, made in tissue cultures of animal parts, contain 'extra' dangerous viruses\" — has been of increasingly serious concern to medical scientists in recent years, and the WHO smallpox vaccines may have been contaminated in this fashion. A documented U.S. Army incident is a case in point. New U.S. Army recruits are routinely vaccinated against a 16"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"17 The Vaccine Connection range of diseases. One of them is smallpox, in case an enemy should try to use smallpox as a biological warfare agent. A healthy 19-year old Army recruit developed AIDS after vacci- nation, and was admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he died. In a paper published in the New England Journal of Medi- cine, Walter Reed medical team scientists reported their discovery of the connection between vaccination and stimulated AIDS disease. They also warned against the WHO plan to use modified ver- sions of the smallpox vaccine to combat other diseases in developing countries. WHO's 13-year vaccination and eradication program ended in 1980. The program is credited with saving two million lives a year and preventing 15 million infections. It may be inadvertently responsible for the ultimate death of bil- lions. In a meeting of 50 experts near Geneva in May, 1987, it was revealed that millions of new AIDS cases are about to hit Southern Africa. The experts believe that up to 75 million Southern Africans — about a third of the population — may have AIDS within the next five years. From our previous statements above, it appears almost certain that Communist agents who had penetrated U.S. and European laboratories manipulated the contamination of the altered vaccines. Further, the Soviets may be stimulating the disease and guiding it electromagnetically, by special implanted signals carried by the giant Soviet woodpecker \"over-the-horizon radars\" and other Soviet transmitters. Or, the Soviets may be using their own transmitters and ours, including our own power lines and radio and TV stations, to broad- cast signals that \"precondition\" and greatly amplify our population's vulnerability to certain selected diseases — AIDS and otherwise. We will address these issues and Soviet subtle EM capabilities later. Soviet Biological Warfare Background In World War I, the Russians suffered half a million casualties"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Vaccine Connection to gas warfare, including 50,000 dead. At 10,000 troops per light division, that's the equivalent of 5 divisions killed and 45 divisions incapacitated. This made a deep and lasting impression on the Soviets. Lenin himself ordered a major effort mounted to develop and manufacture chemical and biological weapons, for he understood the implications of such mass-destruction weapons. In 1919 the Soviets began work in earnest on BW weapons. Work on them has not stopped since then. It will not stop so long as the Communists remain in power. To loyal Communists, Lenin's dictate to develop and lead the world in biological weapons is absolute and unquestioned. By 1937, the Red Army was fully equipped and psychologically prepared to wage chemical and biological warfare. Continuing today, the Soviet forces have the highest training in chemical warfare of any troops in the world. Red Army soldiers practice regularly, often using actual chemical agents. Decontami- nation is a standard measure and practiced as a matter of course. Even though the Soviets, along with many other nations, signed the Geneva Protocol of 1925 which banned the use of deadly chemical and bacteriological weapons, the Soviets have never ceased develop- ment of such weapons. In the 1930's, a secret Soviet bacteriological institute was set up at the town of Suzdal. Prisoner microbiologists worked on a variety of new weapons and vaccines, including bubonic plague and tulare- mia (rabbit fever). By World War II the Soviets were prepared to retaliate vigorously to any use by the Germans of chemical and biological warfare agents. After the war, Soviet research and development in chemical and biological weapons continued apace. However, much of the genetic work was hampered by Stalin's stern support of the autocratic control of agronomist Trofim D. Lysenko. Lysenko's crackpot theo- ries on genetics, for example, held that genes did not even exist. After the death of Stalin, Lysenko's work was discredited, and the Soviets set forth immediately to \"catch up\" with the West in genetic implications such as recombinant DNA techniques. Thus in the early 1960's the Soviets began sending Russian 18"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"19 The Vaccine Connection scientists to the West to catch up with Western genetics research. One of these scientists was David Goldfarb, who later became a leading Soviet expert in the field of molecular genetics. He headed up the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Bacteria and Bacterioph- ages of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Although he did not work on secret Soviet projects, the Soviet authorities stopped him cold when he applied for a visa to leave in 1979. Goldfarb was a specialist in plasmids, antibiotic resistances, and recombinant DNA technology—all very, very useful to the Soviet effort in biowar. One can readily understand the reluctance of the authorities to release scientists such as Goldfarb. After all, the Soviet \"dirty work\" with the deliberate AIDS contamination of the World Health Organization's smallpox vaccine had already been accomplished and a great Soviet biological warfare \"strike\" was already underway, thanks to the massive smallpox vaccination program of WHO. In 1972, in the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, the Soviet Union and every major power agreed not to develop or use biological weapons. The agreement went into effect in 1975. Al- though it bans the development, production, and stockpiling of biological agents and toxins for hostile purposes, it has not slowed or altered the Soviet program. In the early 1970's, Soviet leaders made a decision to use genetic engineering to produce new and improved BW weapons. Highly secret institutes for this purpose were set up in Moscow, Leningrad, and Novosibirsk. These laboratories specialize in seeking ways that genetic engineering techniques can be used to develop virulent strains and agents that their opponents cannot resist. Every Soviet civilian institution dealing with bacteriology and epidemiology is responsible for certain military work as well. The Soviet Academy of Sciences in fact funds appreciable research of such nature at these institutions. One of the major Soviet centers for recombinant DNA techniques in biological weapons research is in the village of Protvino, near Moscow. Research on chemical and biological weapons is very easy to conceal, and the Soviets are sure that they will not be caught. Satellites cannot detect what is going on in the labs. The payoff is big and the risk is minimal. The Soviets push this area vigorously."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Vaccine Connection 20 A number of installations capable of producing disease agents and toxins on a large-scale basis and placing them in munitions and delivery systems have also been identified. One such facility is in the city of Sverdlovsk and has a long history of BW research and development and production, with emphasis on anthrax. During early April 1979, an accidental release of anthrax occurred in Sverdlovsk that caused many casualties and deaths in spite of heroic efforts by Soviet doctors and cleanup and decontamination crews. Note that, according to DoD's 1987 edition of Soviet Military Power, page 110, \"Anthrax causes a high mortality rate when the infection results from ingestion (up to 70 percent fatal) or inhalation (almost 100 percent fatal) if treatment is not promptly begun.\" In addition to military BW institutes, military officers and KGB agents are assigned to key posts in the Soviet Union's normal health and science ministries to monitor research and development that has possible military significance. Also, the KGB has a continuing and highly active program to insert recruited Soviet Scientists in Western genetic research insti- tutes and agencies. This is a high priority effort, and it has been very successful. Also, it obviously says something about the probability of Soviet agents penetrating U.S. and Western European cancer research institutes, particularly those using recombinant DNA techniques. To make it even worse, we simply invited them in with open arms! Indeed, it was that KGB program plus the \"open arms\" in Western cancer virology research institutes that enabled the Soviets to set up and bring about a massive \"first strike\", using WHO and Western laboratories to do the actual dirty work unknowingly. We Need An Immediate, Full Scale Investigation Annually, President Reagan makes a report to the U.S. Congress o n the subject of Soviet noncompliance with Arms Control agree- ments. In April, 1984 Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger put it this way:"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"21 The Vaccine Connection \"There is an apparent effort on the part of the Soviets to transfer selected aspects of genetic engineering research to their biological warfare centers... Soviet research efforts in the area of genetic engineering may also have a connection with the biological program...Normally harmless, non-disease-producing organisms could be modified to become highly toxic or produce diseases for which an opponent has no known treatment or cure. Other agents, now considered too unstable for storage or biological warfare appli- cations, could be changed sufficiently to be an effective agent.\" At the time that Secretary Weinberger made this statement, a devastating biological warfare strike using those exact techniques had already been unleashed on the Western world by the Soviet Union, cleverly disguised under the banner of the World Health Organization's smallpox vaccination program. It is imperative that the Congress of the United States launch a full investigation of the entire background of the AIDS biological warfare strike, as a matter of the highest priority. The investigation should include the role of the Soviet Union, fellow-travelers, and Western scientists openly sympathetic to the Soviet cause. It requires little investigation to see that there is a well-marked trail for several decades, showing that such a biological warfare strike against humanity has long been considered — and even preferred — by those advocating the Communist cause and world domination. For example, Bertrand Russell, philosophical spokesman for a group of Westerners, explicitly stated this diabolical BW capability for consideration, in his Impact of Science on Society: \"At present the population of the world is increasing at about 58,000 per diem. War, so far, has had no very great effect on this increase, which continued throughout each of the world wars... War has hitherto been disappointing in this respect... but perhaps bacteriological war may prove effec- tive. If a Black Death could spread through the world once in every generation, survivors could procreate freely with- out making the world too full. The state of affairs might be"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Vaccine Connection 22 unpleasant, but what of it?\" The blood of every American — and every European, African, and Asian — should curdle at such words. We are now facing the very \"Black Death\" type of plague referred to by Russell in such glowing terms! Highly influential followers of the Russell philosophy — and his callous approval of the periodic slaughter of much of the world's population — may have continued to view the great destructive power of new viral warfare agents as the best means to achieve their end: Selective thinning of the world's population. At least a few such men may have continued to cooperate with the Soviet Union to work powerfully behind the scenes in interna- tional organizations, trying to arrange the proper opportunity to achieve their nefarious purpose. The \"East-West cooperative effort\" in cancer research created and gave them the precise biological agent custom-made for the job. WHO's massive, worldwide smallpox inoculation program gave them the precise means to rapidly get the deadly virus into enough human veins to assure a new \"Black Death.\" All that had to be done was surreptitiously contaminate the vaccine — the easiest thing of all. This plague has been knowingly, with malice aforethought, unleashed upon mankind. The perpetrators should be hounded down like the wild beasts they are, uncovered in the full light of day, and suitably punished with the swift and sure justice they deserve. At least one outstanding medical consultant had the courage to report to WHO that their vaccine was generating the AIDS epidemic. When WHO suppressed the evidence, the London Times had the courage to print the story. I strongly urge every U.S. Senator and Congressman to introduce and/or support immediate legislation that would launch a full-scale, massive investigation, with no stone left unturned. I urge every concerned activist to demand and support such an investigation at the highest level.

In laboratory experiments that were a legitimate and vital part of the war against cancer, animal retroviruses were repeatedly injected into human cell cultures until they recombined to produce strains hostile to human life—strains that would thus live in human cell cultures. Even though their work was accomplished for a totally different purpose, cancer laboratories produced the ultimate, made-to-order biological warfare agents. The World Health Organization (WHO) is also strongly pene- trated — and even controlled at some levels—by communist agents, as are many other such international agencies. And WHO's massive smallpox vaccination program in Third World countries provided the Soviets a made-to-order opportunity to have (ostensibly) \"someone else\" deliver the actual BW strike. In other words, the Soviet deception plan was complete. It was very simple for Soviet agents to contaminate the cultures in which smallpox vaccine was being produced for WHO's inocula- tion campaign. This insured the production of vaccine contaminated with AIDS viruses, and the subsequent massive infection of the African peoples and other Third World nations.

Where WHO smallpox vaccination occurred, the mysterious symptoms of AIDS disease appeared in due time. Even the eventual spread of the AIDS virus to the U.S. homosex- ual community is explainable. For example, the economy of Haiti had earlier been made a shambles. The poor citizens of that impoverished island had been reduced to desperate straits. In desperation many younger Haitian males had begun to prostitute themselves to visiting homosexual tourists. The Haitian males were not homosexual themselves; rather, they were desperate to gain money to provide for their starving families. In response, U.S. homosexuals — particularly from San Fran- cisco and New York — had made Haiti their vacation playground. They even ran ads to this effect in their gay newsletters and mngazines. WHO then vaccinated some 15,000 or so Haitians against smallpox, using the vaccine contaminated with the AIDS virus. This introduced AIDS into Haiti and into the Haitians. The U.S. homosexuals quickly picked up the AIDS virus by direct contact, and brought it back to the U.S. with them. There the nature of the activities engaged in by homosexuals was responsible for enhanced spread of the virus among members of the homosexual community. Engineering the AIDS epidemic appears to have been a collusion between Communists and the international control groups. Apparently the control groups wished to \"clean out the African continent and other Third World areas\" — possibly to provide room for relieving population pressure in the developed countries. This may have been seen as the way to solve the problem of the ballooning human population — the so-called \"biological time bomb.\" The Soviets, however, realized that contamination of the small- pox vaccines would result in an epidemic of unparalleled propor- tions. They recognized the opportunity for safely initiating — and winning — World War III with a great first strike."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"27 Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React The Soviets themselves already possess an electromag- netic cure for diseases such as AIDS, but they have not unveiled it. All such products of scalar electromagnetics (which the Soviets call energetics) are held tightly by the KGB. That the Soviets have kept such a cure secret strongly implies that they regard it as a known antidote for biologi- cal warfare agents, and thus highly classified. The importance of this can easily be seen: Presently the West has absolutely zero defense against a biological warfare strike using viruses as BW agents. In such a strike, fast-acting viral strains can easily be used — say, agents which are highly infectious and kill within two or three days. Development of a vaccine is impossible. There is simply no time to do that. Further, even if the virus was slow-acting, a vaccine could only be developed if the virus is stable. If it is unstable (constantly mutating), development of a vaccine is impossible. The greatest vulnerability of the U.S. today is its total vulnerability to unknown BW viral agents. Absolutely noth- ing we have or are doing in our Department of Defense is of any consequence or protection against new BW viruses for which no vaccine is developed or possible. The great ease with which such cheap new, highly lethal viral BW agents can be developed means that even a relatively small military power—such as Libya, Cuba, or Iran—can develop and use them against the U.S. Such BW viral agents can also easily be clandestinely planted across the U.S., to devastate an unsuspecting, unprotected Ameri- can populace. In fact, even a single deranged madman can readily develop lethal BW viral agents sufficient to devastate even a great military power. Further, in an open society such as the U.S., that same madman can easily introduce such an agent he develops — and, if he's clever, not even get caught in the act. Past isolated cases of \"contamination\" of on-the-shelf drugstore medicines is just a faint prelude of that which is to come."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React 28 Indeed, we may unwittingly do it to ourselves by accident, even without a BW strike by the Soviets, small enemy powers, or a madman. Throughout the West, it is now most fashionable to experiment with the production of new bacteria and viruses. Gene-splicing, rccombinant DNA genetics, etc. are being employed on a grand scale as the latest \"scientific marvel.\" Even some high school students have experimented with this sort of thing. Many other colleagues, universities, and private persons are proceeding full-tilt with casual experiments. Most of this \"casual experimentation\" is uncontrolled. When finished, the residue gets dumped in the trash can or flushed down the drain. In any case, it goes into our biosphere. Some of this residue contains unstable, highly adaptable viruses. It's only a matter of time until one of these unwitting agents gets loose and survives — one that's lethal, fast, and highly infectious. Make no mistake: It's a near certainty that this will happen. The only question is when. Also, with the recent Supreme Court decision allowing the patenting of a virus or bacteria, a number of laboratories and companies are now feverishly developing new agents to unleash in the biosphere upon persons, animals, and plants. For the most part, these experiments are tightly controlled. However, it is impossible to test in the laboratory the result of the natural recombination and mutation of these agents once they are loose in the environment and in a free exchange with all the natural bacteria and viruses. Once loosed in the biosphere, a new viral agent undergoes combinations and recombinations with the greater number of vi- ruses already present. The situation is like an increase in a large factorial number: Only a few additional viruses will result in millions and millions of additional combinations — at least some of which inevitably will be lethal and quick-acting. This is not tested in those laboratories making, patenting, and releasing new viruses. Humans have spent millions of years developing sufficient immunity to the natural BW agents to allow humanity to survive. Very shortly we are going to have increasingly large numbers of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"29 Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React new environmental BW agents emerging all around us. For some of them, it is a foregone conclusion that we have little or no natural immunity developed. So we are going to enter an increasingly harsh environment, characterized by the rise of great epidemics and pandemics of many kinds. Inevitably some of these coming scourges are going to rival the \"Black Death\" in ferocity and lethality. Effective defense against one or more such BW viral attacks — either against our forces in the field or against our civilian population — can only be provided by a ready, fully developed technology of electromagnetic healing. It does not really matter whether the BW strikes are performed by a hostile foe, a madman, natural mutations within our now drastically stimulated viral environment, or as a result of some particular \"residue\" discarded by an enthusiastic high school or college student. The end result — the decimation of humankind — is going to be the same unless we develop and use electromagnetic healing tech- nology. However, with the present enormously self-hostile state of mankind, one or more enemies or madmen will almost certainly launch a strong, clandestine BW strike against the United States Armed Forces and the U.S. populace. With EM healing technology, a specific \"antidote\" to any viral disease — known or unknown — can be developed in a matter of hours. Mass electromagnetic treatment can then be started immedi- ately, even for an entire army in the field or for our population in the heartland. Within hours of recognizing a BW strike, cure rates above 90% can be quickly achieved in exposed personnel. Further, using electromagnetic healing technology, if necessary a more conventional vaccine can also be rapidly developed — say, in two weeks — for mass distribution and inoculation of the civilian populace. The bottom line is this: Neither the U.S. Armed Forces nor the U.S. civilian populace can or will survive the coming lethal viral"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React 30 warfare strikes unless we quickly develop electromagnetic healing technology and have the necessary diagnostic and treatment devices already ready and waiting. The clandestine AIDS strike by the Soviet Union is just the precursor of a great deal more to come. The USSR Has Repeatedly Verified Our Nonreaction The Soviet Union already knows that Western science and governments are too stereotyped and dogmatic to react to anything highly unorthodox. For years, the Soviet have been proving this, over and over, in their development and testing of frightful scalar electromagnetic superweapons of unprecedented power. In the face of overwhelming evidence of this, the West has kept its head buried in the sand like an ostrich. It wasn't invented in the West. Therefore it cannot be. Years of substantial Communist indoctrination of students in our universities, by leftist/liberal professors, has placed a massive imprint into our society. An entourage of sympathetic groups has resulted — groups which believe that the Soviet leaders are just like us , that the Stalinist era is long since over, and that the Communist leopard has changed its spots and really isn't trying to take over the world anymore. As a system, then, much of the West simply refuses to accept anything unorthodox, anything \"not invented here\", and anything that indicates Soviet aggression. The Soviets know the U.S. is totally ignorant of advanced scalar EM weaponry. They have proven over and over that the U.S. will not even comprehend that it has been deliberately struck, if the strike is sufficiently unorthodox. The Soviet scalar EM superweapons have already been docu- mented in Fer-de-Lance, Tesla Book Company, 1986, and that documentation will not be repeated here. Only a short summary of events will be presented, to put the Soviets' confidence into perspective. A longer chronology of selected events is included as Appendix IV."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"31 Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React The Soviets were quite confident in arranging for a great biologi- cal warfare strike, because of the total lack of the U.S. to comprehend incidents such as the following: 1. Beginning in the late 1950's, hidden Soviet transmitters across the street targeted \"weak microwave radiation\" against the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Over the years the radiation continued, sometimes continuously, sometimes intermit- tently. The Soviets electronically induced diseases that re- sulted in extensive health problems of Embassy personnel, the death of two U.S. Ambassadors, and the sickness of a third. Several U.S. Presidents have protested the radiation. Both U.S. Intelligence and the U.S. scientific community have been totally baffled. They still do not know the true nature of the radiation, nor its purpose. 2. In the winter of 1957-58, an unexplained nuclear event hap- pened near Kyshtym, within the Soviet Union. A huge explo- sion occurred in the stored nuclear wastes in the disposal section of the Soviet atomic weapons industry located in the southern Urals. Radioactive contamination covered 1,000 square miles. For years the story was opposed — or sup- pressed — by U.S. intelligence agencies, perhaps to allay public resistance to the U.S. nuclear industry. At the time, Soviet experimentation with large scalar electromagnetic transmitters was well underway. A large transmitter proba- bly failed, discharging its built-up, giant electrogravitational potential (EGP) into the earth. Such a pulse would have propagated through the earth as a wave; the first nuclear material contacted would have been fissioned immediately. The stored nuclear wastes probably exploded due to receipt of an EGP from the inadvertent failure of one of the Soviet Union's new superweapons in development. Survivors re- ported that indeed the nearby nuclear wastes exploded. 3. In January 1960 Khrushchev announced to the Presidium that a new fantastic weapon was in development.

In May 1960 Gary Powers' high-flying U-2 spy plane was mysteriously disabled over the Soviet Union, resulting in its subsequent crash and the Soviet capture of Powers himself. A flash appeared behind Powers' aircraft, as if from an explosion — except that the flash persisted, showing that it was not a normal HE explosion at all. A tracking radar, employed in a scalar EM mode, probably was used to cause the electromag- netic \"flash ball\" and disable Powers' aircraft. Harmless SA- 2 missiles fired far below him may have been employed to deceive Western intelligence analysts. Figure 10. The U-2 high altitude reconnaissance aircraft.

In Afghanistan, in 1981 and at intervals since then, Soviet helicopters have sometimes attacked Afghan guerrillas or villages with a strange new weapon. A body struck by this weapon dies instantly and completely. It falls like a limp rag, and does not decay even in 30 days. Every cell, bacterium, virus, etc. in the body has been killed instantly. Nerve gas rockets and chemical rockets are also usually fired to provide a \"deception cover\" for the nature of the real weapon. This eery Soviet weapon has been mislabeled as some strong new gas, and is referred to as \"Smirch\", a combination of the two words \"smert\" (death) and \"semerch\" (sandstorm). 7. In April 1984 a monstrously huge scalar EM incident occurred off the coast of Japan, near the Kuriles. Subsequent inter- views with the pilots sighting the incident have revealed that several combined tests of the various modes of a scalar EM howitzer occurred. A giant \"cold explosion\" occurred, raising a giant mushroom cloud to over 60,000 feet and greater than 150 miles diameter in two minutes. A glowing dome appeared, and expanded to monstrous size.

Numerous incidents of hemispherical shells of light and giant balls of light within the Soviet Union have been seen from Iran and from Afghanistan. Such giant artificial phenomena have also repeatedly been seen over the oceans by mariners and airline pilots. 9. Several instances of anomalous disabling of jet engines of commercial airliners have occurred while the aircraft were in flight. 10. Direct and intensive weather engineering over the U.S. itself has been accomplished by the Soviet Union for a decade, using the interference grid resulting from the crossing of two or more giant beams from the woodpecker \"over-the-horizon radar\" transmitters. Specific cloud signatures (anomalous holes, giant radials, twin giant radials, and razor-sharp giant inter- ference patterns) have continually occurred, but the orthodox system has blithely ignored them. 11. A giant test of over a hundred huge Soviet scalar EM weapons occurred in and around May 1, 1985 for the 40th anniversary of the end of WWII. The entire Western scientific and intelli- gence establishment remained sublimely unaware of the giant exercise. They had not a single scalar EM signal detector — even though the air, land, and ocean was filled with hundreds of Soviet scalar EM transmitters, chattering away to Soviet armed forces, submarines under the water, etc. Underneath our feet, the earth itself was in giant scalar EM resonance on 54 frequencies — 27 pairs, each of which tapped energy directly from the molten core of the earth and fed it to an ensemble of giant Soviet strategic scalar EM weapons. *See Science, 227 (4584), Feb. 8, 1985, p. 607-611; Science 234 (4775), Oct. 24, 1986, p. 412- 413."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React 40 Figure 12.

In late November, 1985 the Soviets tested their Launch Phase ABM system over Florida, using the launch of a U.S. space shuttle as a convenient test target. A marker beacon (ball of light) was placed in the sky, hovering near the launch area. It was seen by hundreds of persons, and photographed by George Suchary. During the final countdown to launch, a scalar EM \"missile\" (ball of intense energy) was fired, offset from the shuttle. This ball of energy was not in the visible spectrum, but may have been accidently photographed by Bob Gladwin. Twelve minutes offset after launch, a tremendous rumbling overhead boom echoed through the area — so huge it was heard for hundreds of miles up and down the East Coast. This was the third U.S. shuttle launch in which NASA had noted as- sociated anomalous phenomena, but did nothing. 13. On December 12, 1985 the Soviets used the same weapon in the anti-bomber mode to destroy an Arrow DC-8 jet just after its takeoff from Gander Air Force Base, Newfoundland. Over 250 U.S. soldiers and civilian crew members were killed. Gander has long been a registration point for the Soviet scalar EM weapons. For example, in one 4-day period in 1982, 36 anomalous incidents occurred in and around Gander, involving moving lights, lights in the sky, etc. 14. On January 28, 1986 the Soviets destroyed the U.S. space shuttle Challenger, shortly after its launch. A dozen signa- tures are associated with this Soviet kill, too many to mention all of them. To give only a few: First, the Soviet ships monitoring the launch site suddenly departed at high speed, four hours before the launch. This was unparalleled. Second, according to General Daniel Graham, the following evening KGB headquarters gave a party to celebrate the success of the KGB's perfect active measures against the Challenger!

The total is a very strong statement that the Soviets destroyed the Challenger with the same weapon they had tested against three previous shuttle launches, and which they had used to kill the Arrow DC-8 at Gander Air Force Base only six weeks earlier. 15. A whole series of anomalous missile failures occurred, involv- ing Titan, Delta, and Ariane launches. The odds against all these launches failing in that pattern were millions to one. In one Titan failure, video taken of the event showed the anoma- lous \"marker beacon\" light in the vicinity, high overhead. Frame-by-frame analysis of the video showed that the light was indeed independent of the explosion, and it moved off separately after the rocket exploded. Figure 25.

He used the phrase, \"more frightful than the mind of man has ever imagined.\" Shortly after, at the United Nations, Gromyko had even introduced a draft agreement for all nations of the world to sign. Again, the West had not the foggiest notion as to what the Russians were talking about. 17. The orthodox U.S. news media has been, and is, almost totally \"out of it.\" Ironically, at the time of our deadliest peril, and the most momentous period in history, incidents such as the indiscretions of a presidential candidate and of a television evangelist, and the \"Iran Gate\" actions of the National Secu- rity Council in trying to illegally get arms to the Contras, are the \"burning issues of the hour\" — and the week, and the month, and the year, and HO on ad nauseam."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"57 Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React 18.

In addition, the orthodox filtering networks sur- rounding him have effectively isolated him. He has been unaware of the extensive information that shows just how certain it is that the Soviets have fantastic superweapons and have been gingerly using them against us for decades. He and his immediate advisors are fed highly filtered, shaped and interpreted data. U.S. intelligence is very good at doing the things that it does. However, it is also very good at ignoring the things that it ignores! Further, the intelligence community is a past master at \"slick-tonguing\" the interpretation of any- thing new, and anything it really doesn't understand, in terms such as \"We have no evidence that ...\" For decades, the community has consistently underestimated the Soviet threat, and it has also usually projected any unpleasant present Soviet capability in the terms that \"If the Soviets keep this sort of thing up, it may prove to be a real threat 30 years from now!\" For years U.S. intelligence was unaware of a Toronto inventor's development and public demonstration in the late 1960's of an inertial field generator device, for ex- ample, because it simply did not place high value on simple overt intelligence such as reading the newspapers! The entire event was printed in detail in a Canadian newspaper. Only very recently, within the last few years, has the community again realized that the most important intelligence can only come from human (HUMINT) sources.

Western science has also shown itself to be highly dogmatic and ensconced in the comfortable \"status quo.\" It has regally ignored the important Soviet developments in unified field theory. It has assumed an aristocratic stance, regarding the Soviet scientists as little more than peasants still trying to cl ean the mud off their boots. In fact, the Soviet scientists have been ahead of the rest of the world in nonlinear science — the t ruly hard stuff— since the beginning. They have always been the best nonlinear mathematicians in the world. Soviet scientific papers regularly appear which deal with local gen- eral relativity and the overcoming of the sacrosanct conserva- tion laws as a matter of course. That subject is still a \"no-no\" in U.S. scientific publications, even though breaking symme- try and consequent violation of conservation laws has long boon proven in particle physics. To my knowledge, with the exception of Hooper's obscurely published work, not a single US. scientific paper appears in the literature showing any detailed investigation of \"bucking fields\" as such and investi- gating the behavior of materials exposed to such \"sum-zeroed\" fields. Yet ironically a whole area of optical physics — phase conjugate optics (PCO) — has shown great activity since we discovered it in the open Soviet literature in the late 60's, and s ince two Soviet scientists visited Livermore* in 1972 and briefed us upon the subject (as another stimulus to see if we recognized the awesome weapon implications).

Using it on nonlinear materials produces extraordinary results — such as electromagnetic waves traveling backward in time. Further, the PC effect is known to be universal, and not just in the optics region at all; for example, it has also been done with sound waves.

The Soviets knew there would be no retaliation, so long as the blow was sufficiently unorthodox. After all, the Soviets have been waging a slowly increasing unorthodox war against us for decades, and totally getting away with it. Consequently the Soviets manipulated the cancer research and the contamination of the World Health Organization's smallpox vaccine to produce the perfect biological warfare \"first strike,\" administered unwittingly by the WHO itself in its mass immuniza- tion program to eradicate smallpox. The Soviets continue to ma- nipulate the spreading AIDS viruses electromagnetically so that the West will be devastated, as well as Africa and the Third World. At least one other spreading AIDS-strain has already appeared in Africa. Testing for exposure to the first strain in most cases did not detect exposure to this second strain. Officially no one knows whether it will be as infectious as the first strain. However, a suspicious correlation has appeared be- tween hepatitis vaccination in several large U.S. cities and conse- quent outbreak of AIDS among the persons inoculated. Further, the latest studies are beginning to show that (1) AIDS may be just as spreadable, though more slowly spread, in the heterosexual community as in the gay community, (2) the AIDS tests themselves are far more unreliable than suspected; one may have the AIDS virus — and serve as an active carrier —for up to three years before the tests begin to detect it, and (3) no one has any real idea as to how many persons have already been infected. As can be seen, even orthodox scientists are beginning to suspect a coming AIDS infection \"asymptote\" which may represent an explosion of the disease into a mass pandemic in the world popula- tion. In Africa, for example, AIDS is spreading freely among the hetersexual population as well as the homosexual population. * We may be on the verge of seeing a similar phenomenon emerge in the *Although there is much speculation as to why African heterosexuals seem so vulnerable, at present no one knows why it is true."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React 62 Western world. If so , we are looking full in the face of a forthcoming AIDS massacre that makes the 1918 influenza pandemic pale by compari- son. Not only will AIDS decimate Africa and the Third World, but it will also decimate the West a little later. In the Soviet plan, after the AIDS massacre has peaked, the remaining much smaller U.S. and European populations will be decimated and totally powerless. The demoralized and devastated Western nations will easily capitulate and pass under the Soviet hammer and sickle. In their deception planning, the Soviets even are allowing some contamination of their own citizens by AIDS. Thus they can keep up a pretense that they are just as much victimized as we are, and just as much \"in the dark\" as we are about the whole thing. Of course, once the AIDS infection does its lethal dirty work in the West, the Soviets can easily eradicate it in their own population at will, using the electromagnetic healing technology they already posess. The Soviet planners regard the loss of a few Soviet citizens along the way as one of the things necessary to insure the success of the Great Strike and the Final Revolution. Forward divisions in the standard Soviet attack are always regarded as such sacrificial pawns to guarantee the success of the follow-on echelons in the attack. In this BW strike, the sacrifice of some Soviet citizens is deemed necessary to the overall success of the attack. Remember, these are the same type of Soviet communist plan- ners who killed 20 million Kulaks — their own people — to forcibly collectivize Soviet agriculture. For their highest purposes, these planners are still quite capable of ruthlessly sacrificing millions of their own people to achieve their objectives. The Asian Tiger Mosquito: A New and Efficient Vector As almost everyone now realizes, in the past our government has greatly understated the AIDS problem. Past projections of the limitation oft he spread of the disease have been far more optimistic than warranted. For example, officially the government is still denying any possibility of insect vectors for the disease."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"63 Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React Don't believe it. In fact, highly efficient insect carriers of the disease are already on the way. Insects in Africa have positively been verified to be harboring the AIDS retrovirus. Of course, such reports are always accompanied by the bland assurance that \"We have no evidence... (that the insect bites will give AIDS to humans). Let's see now: We're supposed to believe that a monkey bite will do enormously more than that. Even when the monkey didn't have the exact present form of the AIDS retrovirus. Even though monkey bites hadn't done the trick in thousands of years. But we're supposed to turn right around and believe that an insect carrying the live AIDS retrovirus can bite you, inject into you some of his body fluid containing AIDS viruses, and you won't stand any chance of developing AIDS . What are we supposed to believe? That the injected AIDS virus from an insect bite won't bother you, but the injected AIDS virus from other causes will? Nonsense! Anyone who believes that is a prime candidate for purchasing that bridge down the road... Of course insect vectors will give you AIDS! And we've got a real tiger — mosquito, that is, on the way to do just that. The Asian Tiger mosquito has been introduced into the U.S. (it just \"accidentally\" appeared, of course!) and is now spreading through the Southeastern states. This vigorous and voracious mosquito prefers man as its target, and has an unusually wide range. Recently U.S. scientists have reluctantly confirmed the presence of the AIDS virus in the Asian Tiger mosquito. However, as usual we are presented with the same tired refrain, \"We have no evidence that... the mosquito's bite is capable of causing a human to develop AIDS.\" Of course, you can be sure that eventually we will have evidence of precisely that! The AIDS virus is now known to be able to live outside the body for up to at least 15 days, if not longer."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React 64 Also, the AIDS virus is an unstable virus — it's constantly mutating and changing its form. That means it's \"highly adaptable\" - that is, it's continually adapting to its environment, at a rate millions of times faster than normal stable viruses change and That fact implies that some mutant strain of the virus will almost certainly be adapted to living in the Asian tiger mosquito and being introduced into its human host by the mosquito's bite.* It's not a matter of \"Can it do that?\" or \"We have (as yet) no evidence of that.\"; instead, it's a matter of \"How long will it be until that occurs and we confirm it?\" The Asian Tiger mosquito apparently is intended to serve as the major vector (carrier), or at least one of them, to eventually rapidly increase the AIDS infection rate and devastate the U.S. population. AS the vector spreads and the virus adapts to that mode of transmission, the rate of increase of the AIDS infection will itself accelerate. This means that all the projections for \"doubling times\" are seriously in error. The latest data from Alabama, for example, shows that the disease is now doubling every six months instead of every year. Also, the doubling interval itself has been shortening, at least up to the p resent. Note also that, from the data of the new studies confirming a much longer lag time for the AIDS test to indicate the presence of the infection, even the present data on the number of persons infected and the doubling time are underestimated. If these and other data are a true indication, it appears that we literally may have an \"explosion\" of the AIDS infection in no more than two to three years. In addition, as we said the AIDS virus is an unstable virus. Mutations in the virus itself are occurring so rapidly that producing an effective vaccine essentially will be impossible. Without a totally new means applied to produce an AIDS cure, AIDS simply cannot be stopped. •And one or more strains will eventually evolve that can be infectuously spread like the influenza virus is."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"65 Soviets Knew The U.S. Wouldn't React In fact, recenly it has been discovered that the AIDS virus is far more devious than previously susupected.* It attacks in more ways than suspected. It changes in the body, increasing its virulence as the disease progresses. Macrophages, the immune system's scavenger cells, become infected and carry the virus to other body cells. It appears that macrophages may pass the virus to the T-cells, conditioning the destruction of the immune system. Infected macrophasges are found in rectal material of AIDS patients and in cervical fluid and semen. Thus through infected macrophages the AIDS virus is able to infect partners through exhange of semen, cerical fluid, and rectal mate- rial — even though there are no breaks or tears in the skin, and even though the number of free AIDS viruses in thefiuids is too small to pass the infection. Other immune system cells —such as Langerhans cells—are also suspected to be capable of serving as AIDS carriers when infected. The end result is that, as the AIDS patient sickens, the virulence of the AIDS virus increases, so that it attacks a greater variety of cells and can more easily infect them. Present orthodox methods cannot cure AIDs in time, if ever. Unless unorthodox technology is applied to solve the problem the West is already defeated. *See Gina Kolata, \"Fatal Strategy of AIDS Virus Grows Clearer,\" Science Times section, New York Times, Mar. 22, 1988; see also \"Growth in AIDS Virus Virulence Found,\" Los Angeles Times, Apr. 1, 1988."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"World War III Is Raging 66 CHAPTER 3 WORLD WAR III IS RAGING AND WE'VE NEARLY LOST IT More on AIDS Doubling Time AS we said, the AIDS problem is much, much worse than officially announced. As stated, in some areas at least, the number of new AIDS cases diagnosed has been doubling every six months instead of every year. New studies have shown that the tests to identify infection by the AIDS virus may themselves have a 3-year lag period in which they do not reliably indicate the presence of the infection. These facts probably make all previous \"officially announced\" estimates and projections off by several orders of magnitude (at least three). If the incubation period (nominal) is, say, 5 years, then there is a factor of up to 2 (exp 10) of AIDS cases already in incubation. The lag in accuracy of the AIDS tests however, may mean that there are even more AIDS cases in incubation than this. And we may have a new entry into the equation at any time, once the AIDS virus adapts to its transmission by the Asian tiger mos- quito and possibly even other insect vectors.* Remember, we've got the U.S. data for only a relatively few years since 1981. So it's statistically difficult to project ahead with any accuracy. However, the best interpretation of the data we can make shows a spiraling (speed-up) trend in the rate of acceleration of the disease, indicative of a forthcoming asymptote. If that interpreta- tion of the data holds true, the asymptote represents literally an \"explosion\" of the disease. That is, the six-months \"doubling interval\" is slowly becoming the s ix-months \"tripling interval,\" the six-months \"quadrupling interval,\" etc. The best indication/projection I can tentatively arrive at is this: If the total cure is not accomplished within about two to three years, then - considering the incubation ongoing by then and the speedup *Another HIV virus has now been identified."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"67 World War III Is Raging ahead — somewhere between a third and two thirds of all humans on earth will perish.

And all of our tanks, ships, bombers, missiles, nuclear weapons, and armed forces put together can't save a single AIDS victim. We've got more generals than ever before in our history, includ- ing World War II. And not a one of them has a single tactic or a single weapon to use against this mortal attack. Understand, our generals have not failed us against the enemy they know and recognize. The bellies of our B-52 bombers and the aircraft aboard our distant aircraft carriers are filled with nuclear bombs sufficient to destroy the world many times over.

Ironically, Soviet announcements have cleverly started claim- ing that the U.S. has produced the AIDS virus and unleashed it. That's a very clever propaganda trick to shift suspicion from themselves. Indeed, in the Third World the propaganda has been very effective. Most Third World peoples now give at least credence to the Soviet claim. Unless we move immediately to effect a total cure, the armed forces and the populaces of all the Western nations will shortly be devastated — perhaps even worse than if they been attacked with nuclear weapons. With our armed forces and populations devastated, we surren- der. We lose. The Soviets get the U.S. (and European) farmland. That's what they really need. Of course they also will have rid themselves of about 200 million Americans or so along the way.

That equates with destroying the U.S., the major capitalist country. Communists have always taken the long view, willing to struggle for decades to eventually accomplish their aim. If you think no modern nation could be so incredibly savage as to deliberately destroy untold millions of people, look at the actual record of the Communists. When the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia, they murdered a third of their own people. The Soviets murdered some 20 million or so Kulaks when they collectivized the Soviet farms. The Red Chinese also slaughtered Chinese peasants by the tens of millions — perhaps as many as twenty or thirty million — when they collectivized the farmers. Lenin's followers have proved over and over that they are capable of murdering even their own people, on a scale of millions. Dedicated communists are highly religious people — even fanat- ics. Deliberate murder to achieve communism's goals is part of the accepted dogma. The communists are quite capable of killing a billion or more \"foreigners\" and \"enemies,\" given the chance. Particularly when the goal is to win the \"Final Revolution.\" The opportunity to strike the decisive final blow without conse- quences, using as simple and unorthodox a weapon as the AIDS viruses, could simply not be ignored by men who have spent their lives trying to control the world. The unparalleled strike opportunity was particularly irresist- ible since someone else (the Western cancer research institutes) would develop the weapon itself, someone else (the World Health Organization) would unwittingly deliver the strike, and the blow could easily be clandestinely arranged (simply by secretly contami- nating the WHO smallpox vaccine) and accomplished without reper- cussions to the Soviet Union. Western Medicine is Inadequate But what of Western medicine? Doesn't it always come through to save us? Present Western medical science is totally inadequate to do the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"World War III Is Raging TO task required. For example, present medicine is largely based on \"slowing or killing the invader of the body.\" Whether that invader is a germ, bacterium, virus, or whatever. If there's a mechanical difficulty, then present treatment is to try to mechanically remedy it — remove a bad appendix, set a broken leg,etc. However, then it's strictly up to the body's own natural healing system - its immune system and its repair system — to actually do the healing and repair/reconstruction. The problem with AIDS is that it directly affects and suppresses the body's systems for healing and repair. Once this protection and repair system is in disarray, any disease organism can attack the body and infect it. If the immune system can't handle the problem, eventually the invading disease organism kills its host. Even if a way is found to destroy the AIDS virus itself, present medicine h a s not the foggiest notion of how to restore the healing and repair system from the damage and destruction it will have already sustained by massive AIDS infection. Compare the situation to division combat: Hostile invaders are met at the front of the division by the division's combat forces. A battle ensues, with penetration and damage to the rear area support and sustenance facilities. After the enemy is beaten back or de- stroyed, the rear support and the combat forces must be renewed and restored. If that cannot be done, the seriously weakened division can still literally be boiled over by almost anything that comes along and hits it.* *For this reason, standard Soviet doctrine is to attack in echelon, say, by three divisions — one behind the other. Thus, even if the first division is annihilated in the attack, the second and third divisions meet a seriously weakened enemy division and blast right over it. Similar tactics in the BW crisis - multiple viral strikes, one after the other — can almost inevitably be expected, now that the \"first division\" - AIDS - has engaged us. The Soviet \"repetitive attack\" method works, in case anyone has doubts. For example, see George C. Wilson, \"Army training exercises raise troubling questions,\" The Washington Post, as printed in the Huntsville (AL) Times, Feb. 28, 1988, p. 21A. Repeated U.S. Army tests in the Mojave Desert have shown that, in nonnuclear combat, when attacked by multiple Soviet echelons with 3:1 strength, U.S. forces lose every time!

The same inability to cope with the problem also applies to our government bureaucracy, government agencies, the private compa- nies, the universities, and to Western science in general. If we have to depend on any or all of our present \"system,\" the war is already over and we are all already doomed. Half of humanity will die within possibly five years after the upcoming two- to three-year \"point of no return.\" Medical insurance, treatment centers, and even private physi- cians are quickly going to be bankrupted as the AIDS plague increases. With the collapse of Western medicine, panic and pande- monium will reign in the streets. Martial law will be a necessity, and rioting on a scale unparalleled in American history will occur. We are likely to see our own U.S. dictatorship, in the form of a military junta making a coup and seizing power \"to restore order and keep the lid on.\" Study carefully the performance of governments and military regimes in such countries as Korea and South Vietnam, when those countries were hard pressed by enemy forces and in great disarray.

If the Soviets extensively studied cellular death trans- mission by electromagnetics, you can bet they also studied the reverse: electromagnetic healing, or time-reversing the electromagnetic \"death\" signals themselves to produce spe- cific \"healing\" signals for any type of cellular disease. This is particularly certain since the Soviets also discovered and possessed the necessary \"time reversal\" electromagnetics: phase conjugation. This had been widely used by the Soviets in developing their enormous scalar EM weaponry, beginning about 1950 or so. The curative signal technology was kept secret, of course, since the Soviets realized that it provided the only viable defense against viral biological warfare weapons. The Soviets most certainly have the necessary AIDS cure. They can readily make the correct electromagnetic healing signal, by phase conjugating the AIDS death signal from dying human cells that contain AIDS retroviruses. They also know we most certainly do not have the necessary EM cure. Years of weak microwave radiation of personnel in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, and inducing illnesses in those personnel and even U.S. ambassadors, have shown that our own intelligence and scientific communities don't know what's really going on there. Specificially, we've demonstrated (after checking with the DIA, CIA, NSA, and the orthodox scientists) that we do not recognize electromagnetic biological warfare —the deliberate introduction of cellular disease and death by electromagnetic means. Not only do we not recognize it, we can't do anything about it when it hits us. And make no mistake, time-reversed electromagnetic medicine is shockingly cheap and effective, once developed. Specific healing signals for specific diseases — viral or whatever — can be quickly developed (within hours) and immediately used for mass treatment of entire populations. For example, given the developed healing or \"antidote\" signal, it can even be recorded and played over ordinary transmitters, using * There is now reliable information more closely associating Kaznacheyev with military institutes near Moscow, engaged in microwave weapon (directed energy) research"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"73_ World War III Is Raging their normal transmissions as carrier waves. A populace continually bombarded by such \"healing\" television, radio, and powerline sig- nals simply doesn't get the disease. And those already infected recover when continually exposed to such healing signals. So the Russians can stop the AIDS epidemic cold, anytime they choose to do so. Electromagnetically they can also gently guide and stimulate the progress of a disease such as AIDS, once the disease is introduced into a targeted population.* Or, the Soviets can pull out all the stops and induce the disease in a distant population directly, placing the \"death signals\" on common carriers. Such as on our power lines, radio stations, televisions, and directly by induction from the Woodpecker over-the- horizon radar signals which continually bombard us. The West cannot do any of these things. Neither can the West counter them, or defend against them effectively. Unless a totally different tack is taken in the Western effort to counter this viral BW threat, Gorbachev's entrancing smile has already lured us to our doom. We are faced with a direct realization of Lenin's words: \"In the final revolution it does not matter if three-quar- ters of the earth is destroyed, so long as the remaining quarter emerges communist.\" And Khrushchev's ghost will have the last laugh after all. We will have fulfilled the prediction he made to Nixon in their famous \"Kitchen debate\": \"We will bury you!\" Quite simply, for some decades the Soviets have had a new science — one they call energetics, and one which I have called scalar electromagnetics.

Actually he did far more than that, in his theory as originally written. In fact, he had produced a theory which also captured the free interchange between electromagnetic energy and gravitational energy, but no one — including Maxwell himself—realized it at the time. Maxwell wrote his original theory in quaternion and quater- nion-like mathematics. The modern form of vector mathematics had not yet been finalized by Gibbs and Heaviside. It is most instruc- tional to examine some of the fundamental differences between a vector and a quaternion. In a conventional 3-dimensional vector, one may have three vector components, such as v= ai + bj + ck (4-1) where i, j, k are unit vectors in the directions of the x, y, and z axes respectively and a, b, and c are constants. Obviously if the vector components of vector v are zero, then v = 0  (4-2) We shall be interested in the \"vector product\" of two identical vectors v, where (4-3) and A is the length (magnitude) of vector v, is the angle between the two vectors (in this case zero), and O is the zero vector."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"75 Extraordinary Physics Now let us look for a moment at the quaternion situation. First, in addition to the three vector components, a quaternion also has a separate scalar component, w. So the quaternion q for this situation is q = w + ai + bj + ck (4-4) Now when this quaternion is multiplied times itself, the vector part zeros, just as it did for the vector expression. However, the scalar part does not go to zero. Instead, we have qXq = A 2 =a 2 + b 2 + c 2 (4-5) There is a very good physical interpretation of this result. It is a square of the amplitude, hence for the vector part of a wave, it is directly proportional to the energy density of the vacuum, as a function of time, at the particular position. However, we now need to make a short explanation of variation of stress energy density of spacetime. First, we note that, according to general relativity, the \"gravita- tional potential\" is just a conglomerate of potentials of all kinds. Basically, a potential represents a G-potential, and consequently a curvature of spacetime. The potential also represents \"trapped energy.\" Second, we note that Kaluza combined electromagnetics and gravitation as a unified theory in 1921. Kaluza added a fifth (spatial) dimension to Minkowski's 4-space, and applied Einstein's relativity theory to 5 dimensions. To Kaluza's delight, a common 5-d potential is responsible for both electromagnetic field and gravitational field. The \"bleed-off of this 5-potential in the 5th dimension (which is wrapped around each point in our 3-space) is what we know as the electromagnetic force field. The bleed-off of this 5-potential in and through our 3- space is what we know as the gravitational force field. Since the EM field is very much stronger (by a factor of 10 42 for electrons) than the gravitational field, it is obvious that most of the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 76 bleed-off of the 5-potential is in the 5th dimension, as EM force field. Only a tiny bit is left to bleed-off in 3-space, producing a very weak gravitational field. 1 We state this fact: as a mass moves in space, it generates increased \"activity\" with the virtual particle flux of vacuum itself. The Increased virtual particle flux activity exchange between vac- uum and mass is analogous to a strange kind of \"virtual resistance.\" Since the resistance is virtual, it does not observably slow down an observable object moving in an (unobservable, virtual-particle flux) vacuum. The increased flux activity represents an increased \"virtual energy density\" of space time, and an increased \"trapped potential\" (mass; resistance to an accelerating force) of the moving object. It represents a rotation of the spacetime frame, vis a vis the laboratory observer). In the virtual vacuum (which contains both positive and nega- tive time), one sees two antiparallel virtual forces: one in positive time, along the velocity vector of the object, and one in negative time (time reversed, or phase conjugated). The reason one sees virtual forces is that, each virtual (subquantal) change in the virtual flux activity represents an individual (unintegrated), separate change, hence a virtual acceleration. The observer (where things are inte- grated), sees the integral of all these accelerations, hence observable velocity. The vector sum of these two virtual forces in the vacuum is a zero vector; however, the two taken together represent a stress in the local energy density of vacuum. Since we may regard an EM wave as a stream of virtual electrons/positrons, each engaging in tremendous virtual particle flux exchange with the vacuum, then the same basic picture applies. Now for our physical interpretation of (4-5): If we refer to an EM wave moving in the vacuum, the rotation of the frame is maximum (90 degrees). But this same rotation is just the same as additional vacuum stress, so the vacuum stress is maximum. 1 Electromagnetics is 5-gravity sliding around our 3-space. 3-gravity is 5-gravity oozing through our 3-space."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"77 Extraordinary Physics This leads to these conclusions: An electrical force field vector represents a local maximum linear stress in spacetime, along the line of the vector. (Note we specifically deny that the electrical force field vector, of an EM wave in vacuum, is transverse. Instead, it is longitudinal. That has been addressed elsewhere by the author and will not be covered further here.) Another electrical (stress) vector interacting with the first one adds more \"urging\" stress to the first. However, this action is occurring in the rotated frame of the moving wave, and so is rotated 90 degrees from the electrical velocity vector. Therefore it is lateral (but in a hyperdimension, not in 3-space) at right angles to the electrical velocity vector. The combined \"urging\" action of the two vectors thus sweeps out an area with respect to the laboratory observer. This means that the total \"urging\" or \"stressing\" action of the two vectors is analogous to a vector area. It also means that this \"area\" function may be taken as the \"swirl\" of the electrical vector, but in a hyperdimension, not in 3- space. That is, we have described the magnetic force field. Thus any two electrical vectors that interact will have an \"area\" or \"resistance\" component generated. Any two that interact. Whether they add vectorially, cross-product multiply, or dot-product multiply. What is actually happening is that the wave exists in the 5- potential. The E and B fields just represent the oscillations in that 5-potential. They represent oscillations in the bleed-offs of that potential as E-field (longitudinal) and B-field (swirl). The drag-area represents the accumulation of extra potential — hence the local rotation of spacetime. Since this accumulation is moving (along with the EM wave), as it passes a point it represents a change in the local virtual particle flux density of vacuum at that point, hence a local curvature of spacetime. Hence, the EM wave makes a 5-dimension G-potential wave as it travels. The 3-dimensional gravity wave associated with this is normally very, very much smaller in magnitude — say, by a factor of 10 -42 or so. However, if the two vectors interact so as to produce a vector zero resultant, then all the electromagnetic energy of tho two vectors is"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics  78 captured. That is, all the \"EM vector zero\" resultant means is that the EM bleedoff of the 5-space gravitational potential wave has been stopped. The 5-potential is still oscillating, and now all its trapped 5-energy must bleed off as 3-gravity force field. Mass acts as an accumulator for this \"trapped-EM energy turned into local curvature of 5-space.\" If we continually irradiate a mass with such a wave, the atomic nuclei of the mass slowly charge up with the new energy. Note that this potential delta may be positive or negative, if one adjusts accordingly. In this fashion one may change the mass of a static object in the laboratory. One may either increase the mass or decrease it, or cause it to float, or even cause it to accelerate upwards. But to return to our vector interaction and our interpretation of the scalar remainder of the quaternion. The rule is, when the two EM vectors interact so as to form a zero EM resultant, then the EM energy represented in each of the two vectors has been converted into a special form of 5-space gravita- tional potential, one that is not bleeding-off in the fifth dimension (electromagnetically), but one which will gradually produce a 3- gravity potential in a mass's atomic nuclei as a function of time, the individual element, permeability and absorption factors of those nuclei, etc. Therefore in our mathematical theory we ought to have a scalar component remaining when two EM vectors interact to form an EM vector zero resultant. That scalar component represents what is happening in the 5-potential, that will only bleed into 3-gravity. With exploration of this phenomenology in the laboratory, one can work out the functions, constants, coefficients, and parameters which specify how the \"5-G to 3-G and vice versa\" component works in conjunction with mass, motion, and other fields. That's the magic secret of electrogravitation. It was captured inherently by the quaternion theory of Maxwell published during the American Civil War!"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"79 Extraordinary Physics After Maxwell's death, when the scalar portion of the quaternion was discarded (by Oliver Heaviside) to form \"modern\" EM theory, that also discarded the unified field interaction between electromag- netics and gravitation. Electromagnetic field and gravitational field were then modeled and regarded as mutually exclusive. EM field, therefore, was thought to produce no specific gravitational effects in the vacuum itself. Hence when Albert Einstein was formulating general relativity some decades later, he knew only one way to \"curve\" spacetime: that was gravitationally, by \"attraction of mass\" forces. But gravitational force was so weak that only a huge collection of mass would exert enough of it to measurably curve spacetime. That would require a sun or star. Since the observer and his instruments would never be on the surface of the sun or a star, Einstein assumed that the local spacetime of the observer would not be curved. Hence he severely crippled his general relativity theory. In the West, it remains an assumption to this day. It is not a universal assumption in the Soviet Union, however, since the Soviets have long since written — and developed in the laboratory—unrestricted general relativity with local spacetime curvature, and hence local violation of conservation laws. So the scalar part of the quaternion interaction, that remains when the vector part of the resultant is zero, is magic indeed. That is the magic unified field portion that everyone has been seeking for decades and decades! It was there at the beginning. Then we inexplicably threw it away! But to return to our vector/quaternion examples. Note also that the two vectors Vj = ai +bj + ck, v 2 =-ai-bj-ck (4-6)"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 80 sum to zero vectorially when added, such that v 1 + v 2 = 0  (4-7) However, quaternions may behave quite differently, even under addition. For example, the two quaternions q 1 = w +ai + bj + ck, q 2 =w -ai-bj-ck (4-8) sum their vector parts to a vector zero resultant, but do not sum to a scalar zero as well. Instead, they sum to q 1 +q 2 =2w (4-9) AS can be seen, quaternions which have the same vector parts as vectors, do not necessarily yield a complete zero when the vector parts sum to zero. And when two vectors multiply to provide a zero vector resultant, corresponding quaternions may yield a scalar term that is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors. In this way, the quaternion approach can capture the stress of the medium, induced by opposing or multiplying vectors. In the vector approach, the stress of the medium is entirely lost when the two vectors sum or multiply to a zero resultant. Let us see just how important this \"vacuum stress\" can be. First, the \"stress in the medium\" represents curvature of space- time when that medium is the vacuum/spacetime. In other words, the quaternion approach captures the ability to utilize electromagnetics and produce local curva- ture of spacetime, in an engineering fashion. Heaviside wrote a subset of Maxwell's theory where this capability is excluded.* *Dr. Henry Monteith has independently discovered that Maxwell's original quaternion theory was a unified field theory. See his important \"Dynamic Gravity and Electromagnetic Processes,\" in publication"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"81  Extraordinary Physics Note that, by Maxwell's original quaternion theory, however, Einstein's assumption need not be true at all. For example, look at equations (4-5) and (4-9): Here we may utilize electromagnetic force quaternions to produce zeroed EM forces, and an increased stress in local spacetime. In other words, we have curved local spacetime electromagnetically. Since (with electrons) electromagnetic forces are about 10 42 times as strong as the gravitation force, this local curvature of spacetime is not negligible. That is, we have produced a scalar effect from zeroing vector operation between electromagnetic forces. I have called this scalar electromagnetics, and pointed out that it is truly electrogravita- tion. We stress again that this violates one of the severely limiting assumptions that Einstein placed upon his theory of general relativ- ity. He assumed that curving spacetime could only be done by the weak gravitational force due to mass. Since gravitational force is so weak, only a stupendous collection of mass — such as the sun or a star — could curve spacetime enough to notice experimentally. Since obviously the observer and his laboratory instruments would never be located on the surface of the sun or a star, Einstein assumed that the local spacetime would never be curved! In other words, the local frame would always be a Lorentz frame. This meant that, locally, the familiar conservation laws of physics would always apply. Curvature of spacetime would only occur at great distances, and at huge collections of mass such as a star or dwarf star. Einstein did not write a complete, unlimited general relativity. He wrote a sort of \"special relativity with distant perturbations.\" If Einstein had had electromagnetic theory in quaternions, the scalar \"vacuum pressure\" parts would have been there for him to ponder. It is highly probable that he would have captured the \"electromagnetics-to-gravity conversion remainder\" in the quater- nion interactions. If so, he would have written the full theory of general relativity, involving local violation of conservation of en- ergy, a unified field theory, and the direct engineering of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 82 gravitational and antigravity effects on the laboratory bench by electromagnetic means. In that case, we should long since have navigated all around the solar system, colonized the planets, produced practical free energy devices and power systems, and avoided two great world wars and a host of little ones. But let us now see if we can make a gravitational wave, electro- magnetically. Again, regard equations (4-5) and (4-9). Suppose these are instantaneous operations of EM force quaternions whose vector parts are varying in magnitude, but in such a manner that the vector parts ways form a zero vector resultant. Now one can see that the scalar part remaining — which represents the stress of local space- time - is varying as the product of the magnitudes of the vectors in the interaction vary. This means that one has now produced a scalar wave that represents the local variation of spacetime curvature in an oscillat- ing manner. Rigorously this is a gravitational wave. It has been produced locally. It has been produced by Maxwell's original unified theory. Again, I have called this area scalar electromagnetics. The Soviets call it energetics. Where local spacetime curvature is varied, conservation laws (energy, conversation, etc.) need not hold. Curved one way, the local spacetime acts as a source (of energy, charge, etc.) Curved the other way, the local spacetime acts as a sink (of energy, charge, etc.) The Soviets often do not utilize the same restricted kind of general relativity that Western scientists adhere to. Soviet papers in general relativity regularly point out the complete and unrestricted theory, where local spacetime curvature is allowed. They also point out that all conserva- tion laws may be violated by such local curvature. Thus the Soviets have no unduly dogmatic respect for conservation laws. Further, by assuming the possibility of local spacetime curva- ture, Soviet scientists have assumed the possibility of direct experi-"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"83 Extraordinary Physics mentation with general relativity on the laboratory bench. In the West, we have assumed that such cannot possibly be done, because of Einstein's limiting assumption of no local spacetime curvature. Thus Western physicists are strongly conditioned away from electrogravitation. This is particularly ironic since the basis for just such an experimental theory was produced by none other than Maxwell himself in his original theory of electromagnetism. Indeed, shortly after the U.S. Civil War, we should have been developing antigravity spaceships. We should have developed electromagnetics a la Maxwell and been on our way to the planets of our solar system. For Maxwell had — admittedly somewhat unwit- tingly — given us the basis for the necessary engineering theory of unified electrogravitation. Heaviside's Mutilation of Maxwell's Theory Well after Maxwell's death,Oliver Heaviside helped to finalize what is today vector analysis. Then he undertook to \"translate\" Maxwell's theory from quater- nion form to the new vector mathematics form. Now quaternions were devilishly difficult to calculate in. So much so, that a majority of the electrical scientists (there were not very many of them in those days!) were in despair. Not to worry! Heaviside took a broadax, figuratively speaking, and simply chopped off the scalar term, leaving only the vector components. With that artifice, he greatly simplified the calculations to be performed. Of course, he also threw away the EM stress of spacetime! That is, he threw away the \"gravitation\" part of Maxwell's theory! Let me stress this fact most strongly. After Maxwell's death a single man —Oliver Heaviside—directly altered Maxwell's equations, eliminating localized electrogravitation and producing the form of the theory taught throughout the West today as \"Maxwell's theory.\" Maxwell's theory has never been taught in Western universities! Only Heaviside's crippled subset of the theory has been taught!"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 84 Then, shortly before the turn of the century, a short, sharp \"debate\" erupted in a few journals — mostly in the journal Nature. Only about 30 scientists took part in the \"debate.\" It wasn't really much of a debate! The vectorists simply steam- rolled right over the remaining quaternionists, sweeping all opposi- tion before them. They simply threw out the remaining vestiges of Maxwell's quaternion theory, and completely adopted Heaviside's interpreta- tion Thus, a little over a decade later when Einstein wrote his general relativity theory, he did not know that the original work of Maxwell already indicated the unification of gravitation and electromagnet- ics, and indicated the ease with which local spacetime could be electrogravitationally curved locally and engineered. Accordingly, he placed the scientists of the West on a road which rigorously assumed that a unified field theory was yet to be discov- ered. It also strongly discouraged any experimentation aimed at curving local spacetime, for it assumed that such could not be done. After Potsdam and World War II, a frustrated Stalin was to drive his scientists to review the entire scientific literature of the Western world, actively seeking a great new technical breakthrough area such as the Allies had demonstrated with the development and use of the atomic bomb. Great Soviet institutes — one staffed, for example, with over 2,000 PhD's — were set up to thoroughly review all the Western scientific literature from its very beginning. Anything interesting, anomalous, or unknown was put aside for further examination. It is a good bet that the meticulous Soviet scientists discovered the difference between Maxwell's original electromagnetic theory and Heaviside's mutilation of it. Great mathematicians that they are, Soviet scientists would have realized the implications of the difference. With their knowledge of unlimited general relativity, they would have made the connection to electrogravitation. By 1950 they had indeed done so, and were deeply into the development of what they called \"energetics\", and I have called"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"86 Extraordinary Physics scalar electromagnetics. They had also reached another milestone about the same time — 1950 or so. After WWII, both the Soviets and the U.S. were keen on securing the best of the German scientists. The U.S. particularly wanted missile scientists and rocket engineers. The Soviets wanted them too; but they also wanted the German radar specialists and infrared specialists. The West didn't care about the German radar scientists and engineers, and the IR fellows. The Soviets did, and they got them. That was to prove a most spectacular benefit indeed. During the war, the Germans had placed extreme emphasis upon radar and radar absorbing materials (RAM). The German scientists had fantastically developed and extended the science of radar cross section — which is the heart of the matter and very, very complex. They were much further ahead in radar cross section theory at the end of WWII than where the U.S. is today, in the opinion of some U.S. radar experts. So the Soviets started with a great jump on us in radar knowl- edge, and they have steadily increased the lead over the years. In addition, the Germans had developed highly successful radar absorbing materials, and much of the theory to accompany them. Such materials turn out to be the key to how to build and develop a radar phase conjugation mirror, to produce a time- reversed radar wave. Thus, because of the German scientists, by 1950 or so the Soviets had already discovered phase conjugation. And they had discovered it in radar first, not in optics! They would have been primed for the discovery by their great review of Western literature and the foundations of science, since they would probably have noticed that the time-reversed wave is a solution to the wave equation. If so, they would certainly have realized its generality throughout all physics, all frequency bands, and all types of waves. Superb mathematicians that they are, the Soviets would cer- tainly have made the Kaluza-Klein theory connection, and also"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics  86 realized that phase conjugate waves carry negative energy as well as negative time. They would quickly have seen the gravity and antigravity implications. So about 1950 or so, the Soviet Union would have started phenomenology experimentation in earnest, with phase conjugate radar mirrors and phase conjugate radars. This is what was referred to as e nergetics. The Soviets began a massive program in energetics about the time of the beginning of the Korean War. By 1957-8 the Soviets had progressed to the point of a giant scalar EM accident in the Urals which exploded nearby atomic wastes, devastating the area. They had also progressed to develop- ment of great new superweapons using their new energetics — weapons to which Khrushchev referred in 1960 when he informed the Soviet Presidium of a new, fantastic weapon in development, a weapon \"so powerful that it could wipe out all life on earth if unrestrainedly employed.\" About the same time (mid-to-late 50's), the Soviets had also started the eery low-level microwave radiation of the U.S. Embassy in MOSCOW, to see if the U.S. knew of scalar electromagnetics (energetics) and was developing its own electrogravitational weap- ons and defenses. Building Upon Whittaker's Fundamental Work In 1904, a most fundamental paper in the foundations of electro- magnetics was delivered by the British mathematician E. T. Whit- taker. (E. T. Whittaker, \"On an expression of the electromagnetic field due to electrons by means of two scalar potential functions,\" Proc. Lond. Math. Soc., Series 2, Vol. 1, 1904, p. 367-372.). In this important paper, Whittaker showed that the electromag- netic force field equations can be replaced with the derivates of two scalar potential functions. He also derived the most general form of electromagnetic distur- bances in the ether. This means that the coupling of two dynamic scalar functions can replace vector electromagnetics in the vacuum. Note that Whittaker's work pointing out the overriding impor- tance of scalar fields also accents the erroneously discarded scalar"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"87 Extraordinary Physics part of Maxwell's quaternion electromagnetic theory even more strongly. Let me explain now how I got from Whittaker's paper to scalar electromagnetics, Soviet Tesla weapons, free energy, antigravity, and electromagnetic healing. When I discovered Whittaker's paper, I had already strongly objected that \"charges\" and electromagnetic vector force fields — as presently included in the Heaviside version of Maxwell's equations — included observable mass. Of course there was no observable mass in the vacuum, hence the prescribed kind of EM force fields could not exist as such in the vacuum. Obviously the foundations of our ordinary electromagnetics theory were seriously flawed. Although my objections fell on deaf ears, I determined to examine the foundations of EM theory, dis- cover the flaws, and at least point out the necessary corrections to be made. Though this was an arduous task to undertake and it required many years, slowly the flaws showed themselves, and the necessary corrections slowly became clearer. Most exciting of all, in working with several unorthodox re- searchers, I was able to see many of these new ideas tried, adjusted, and demonstrated. In addition, the proprietary discoveries of these colleagues continued to reveal new and unique principles and concepts. The only disadvantage was that I could not reveal the propriety apparatuses and demonstrations of my inventor associ- ates, but only the principles and concepts that developed. In turn, I also developed principles and concepts to explain what they were doing and the results they were obtaining. So over the years I have slowly been releasing the principles and concepts. Some of them are my own discoveries, many of them are the discoveries of my associates. Some of them are simply a mixture of both. Early on, it became obvious that the Soviet Union was far ahead on this path, and was already utilizing the new unified field theory to build eery, powerful new superweapons. Since no one else in the U.S. seemed to be \"watching thin particular store\" (I was rather universally regarded as some pecu-"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 88 liar sort of fool!), I also began to compile information and data on the Soviet weaponization of this unrecognized technology. This infor- mation I have released in a series of papers, briefings, and books, the most recent being a 1-hour videotape, \"Soviet Weather Engineering Over North America,\" 1985, and a detailed book, Fer-de-Lance: A Briefing on Soviet Scalar Electromagnetic Weapons, Tesla Book Co., Greenville, Texas, 1986. Building upon Whittaker's important work, I formulated a conceptual revision to electromagnetics, which I dubbed scalar electromagnetics to accent that the observable EM vector force fields did not exist as such in vacuum, but dynamic scalar fields did. I also wished to call strong attention to the fact that observable force does not exist until an observable particle of mass is coupled to the interference of the two scalar fields (much like in the Aharonov- Bohm effect). The Soviets, of course, call this area energetics, Energetics technology has been used in gigantic weapons programs of the Soviet Union for decades, and it appears to be developed under the most highly classified program that the Soviet possess. All development and deployment of energetics weapons is under the KGB and controlled directly by that organization, not by the Soviet Armed Forces. Peter Kapitsa, the great Soviet physicist, was once pressed by Nikita Khrushchev for a total defense against missiles and air- and space-borne vehicles. Kapitsa replied that it could only come from the new energetics. In 1960, of course, Khrushchev gleefully an- nounced to the Presidium that a new, fantastic Soviet weapon was in the development, \"so powerful that, if unrestrainedly used, it could wipe out all life on earth.\" Ironically, Khrushchev \"jumped the gun\" before his new super- weapons were deployed. In the fall of 1962 he began inserting long range missiles into Cuba, bracketingthe U.S. with nuclear firepower in an attempt to immediately change the balance of power. Kennedy, of course, backed him down \"eyeball to eyeball,\" so to speak, in a blunt confrontation, but promised not to invade Cuba. Khrushchev, with his days numbered, was desperate to deploy his new superweapons and provide a dramatic demonstration to recover face."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"89 Extraordinary Physics By destroying the U.S.S. Thresher on April 10,1963 and, on the next day, producing a gigantic underwater explosion 100 miles north of Puerto Rico, the Soviets demonstrated that the new superweapons had been deployed. Khrushchev managed to retain his position a while longer. In the 1960's and early 1970's, I was also deeply involved in the study of paranormal phenomena. In 1969, I entered the Georgia Institute of Technology to pursue a Master's Degree program in nuclear engineering, graduating in 1971. In 1973, I published a rather simple paper, \"Quiton/Perceptron Physics: A Theory of Existence, Perception, and Physical Phenom- ena,\" in which I pointed out the nature of quantum change, gave a new definition of mass and acceleration, and pointed out the funda- mental nature of inversion of time. The paper also contained a simplified derivation of Newton's laws of motion, relativistic form. The elements of this paper had been worked out in 1971 while I was finishing my Master's program in nuclear engineering. Finishing the work had been interrupted by a slight sidetrack — a tour in Vietnam from summer of 1971 until summer 1972. At about the same time, I formulated a fundamental correction to Aristotle's logic, adding a fourth law of logic to Aristotle's three, and a proof of it. The new logic was of great use in discovering and uncovering new concepts in unified field theory. Incorporating Kaluza-Klein 5-dimensional concepts, scalar EM became a field theory that unifies electromagnetics and gravitation. Incorporating dynamic sum-zeroed EM vector systems (which are discarded in normal EM theory) allowed the direct engineering of the unified field theory, including structuring the vacuum, curv- ing local spacetime, and producing effects at a distance and in higher dimensions. Actually it allowed the recovery of much of the scalar part of Maxwell's original theory. I then realized that, inside a vector zero EM force field summa- tion/multiplication, the virtual particle flux of vacuum/spacetime was ordered and controlled locally and macroscopically. This of course violated one of the major assumptions (a postulate) of quan- tum mechanics; the assumption that the structure of vacuum was"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 90 randomized, and could not be deliberately ordered, engineered, and curved locally. Adding phase conjugation (time reversal) aspects and extended quantum mechanical concepts allowed local antigravity and local curvature of spacetime to be included — again, on an engineering basis. It also allowed one to produce a mechanism responsible for Newton's third law, and to engineer the reaction force at will. Further, it revealed that the law of entropy was simply the positive time s tatement; it showed that there was another half of the law, the negative time part or the law of negentropy. In addition, a startling new concept of mind, thought, life, biofields, disease, and healing emerged from all this — again, on an engineering basis. As we stated in the beginning of this book, it is now an urgent necessity to release my work on the basis for electro- magnetic disease and electromagnetic healing. We must produce a very quick, positive treatment and cure of AIDS and other coming lethal viruses before the world is decimated. Accordingly, this work is being released in this book. In this chapter we will next present some perhaps surprising material on phase conjugation, from the scalar EM viewpoint, after first briefly explaining symmetry and parity. In following subsections, we will cover briefly the remaining major concepts in scalar electromagnetics. This will then set the stage for the following chapter, Extraordinary Biology, in which we will deal with the basis for unparalleled electromagnetic healing. Symmetry and Parity The basic idea of symmetry is the arrangement of the parts of a body or system about an axis so that two or more parts appear the same with respect to some operation. The most obvious example is to look in a mirror, where we notice that our image has been reversed, left to right. Yet otherwise there is no difference; and so we may say that the reflection has \"mirror symmetry.\" It's the same except that left and right are reversed. If you know the details of a system at one point, and at another"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"91  Extraordinary Physics point you know that the system will possess mirror symmetry, then you can predict exactly what state the system will be in at the latter point. It will be \"left to right reversed.\" You don't have to calculate the laws of reflection and the laws of motion of the system. All the laws of nature that possess \"mirror symmetry\" have a special property: If the words \"right\" and \"left\" are interchanged in the statement of the law, then the behavior of a system that obeys the law is unchanged. Thus symmetry became a powerful idea in physics. For a system with a great number of possible interactions, etc., one can usually eliminate a very great number of them due to symmetry considera- tions. In other words, if one can assume that symmetry of the system will not be violated, then all the possible interactions that would yield \"broken symmetry\" can be eliminated. On the other hand, if symmetry is broken in a physical interac- tion, at least one of the conservation laws is broken in that interac- tion. Broken symmetry — and hence violation of individual conser- vation laws — is a well-established fact in particle physics today. Another concept intimately associated with mirror symmetry is parity. Each particle is assigned a number (+1 or -1), depending upon what kind of particle it is. One adds up these numbers for an assembly of particles, to obtain an overall \"parity\" number for the system. If parity is conserved in an interaction, then this total number does not change in the interaction. Table 13.

The result of all this was that particle physicists established that Extraordinary Physics 96"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics (1) symmetry can be, and is, sometimes broken, (2) individual conservation laws can be, and sometimes are, broken. Particle physics, however, concerns itself primarily with micro- scopic interactions. Most of the delightful new things discovered in the microworld have not yet been applied — by physicists, that is — in the macroworld. If you can successfully apply broken symmetry in a major system, for example, you should be able to violate the conservation of energy law and thus produce a \"free energy\" engine. Several inventors with whom I work have done precisely that. The tech- niques and technology are still primitive and they need much further development, but the principle has been clearly established and replicated. Physics is correct in certifying broken symmetry, and you can do it in large systems as well as in microscopic particle interactions. Of course you also curve local spacetime as well, something which Einstein and his followers have assumed cannot be done. Charge-Parity-Time and Negative Energy The upshot of all this is that the physicists came up with the idea that what is really conserved is a consolidated thing called Charge- Parity-Time. You don't have to conserve any one or two of these three, but only the combined product. Here they overlooked one key factor that is very important to our thesis: In the photon interaction, if you reverse charge and time, you reverse the sign of the energy. That is, a photon that is emitted from a positive charge carries negative time negative energy. It is different from a photon that is emitted from negative charge, for that one carries what we have conventionally established as positive energy. Thus physics has not considered the exclusive use of negative- energy / negative-time photons, even when some of its interactions produced them. Instead, it has just lumped together photons and antiphotons, and considered them both to have positive energy. Antimatter systems don't have positive energy, for example; they have negative energy. Here we don't use the positive and negative signs to indicate the direction the energy is traveling, but the fundamental kind, of energy that it is—time forward or time reversed."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"For example, consider the local conservation of energy.

Yet one is perfectly free to build a system into which he inputs 100 joules of positive energy, and from which he outputs 300 joules of positive energy and 200 joules of negative energy! For the real conservation law, that's the equivalent of putting in 100 j oules of positive energy and outputting 100 joules of positive energy. Now negative energy will run motors, light lamps, etc. —often much better than positive energy. It can be transmitted, trans- formed, stepped up or down in \"voltage,\" rectified, received, etc. It can be translated into positive energy or vice versa. Circuits run \"cool\" when using negative energy. If you short out a circuit of negative energy so that a violent discharge occurs, it produces cooling instead of heating, greatly lessening the danger of fire and destruction. If you mix negative energy onto a line that is carrying the same amount of positive energy, however, the two negate each other and there is suddenly \"no power\" on the system. Think of what you were taught in simple arithmetic. You can take a zero — the absence of any single specific number — and replace it with any set of multiple numbers whose algebraic sum is zero. The presence of this special set of numbers you choose does not violate the condition that the zero means that you could not use just a single number. Although zero is the absence of just a single thing, it can be the presence of multiple things. The same thing works with energy. In the microworld, every- thing is fantastically energetic, and wildly fluctuating. For example, in a copper wire carrying a current of one ampere, wild momentary fluctuations at extremely high frequencies are occurring. According to classical electrodynamics, the instantaneous cur- rent in a single one of these micro-micro fluctuations may reach thousands of amperes, and the instantaneous voltage may reach 10 40 volts or more. As can be seen, the instantaneous energy and power are enormous. Yet outside the wire, we see a very placid and peaceful situation.

We've got about 20 megawatts of positive power, and about 20 megawatts of negative power, in there — in the microstructure of the electrical current itself--but disintegrated By applying unconventional scalar EM engineering techniques, we ought to be able to take such an \"input\" (a straight wire with one watt of power at a frequency of a megahertz) and get an \"output\" of up to 40 megawatts. It is relatively straightforward to get out 1 megawatt; such ratios have actually been achieved on the laboratory bench by my associates. Of course we will have curved the local spacetime to do such a thing. But it is absolutely permitted to do that, by the laws of nature as best we know them from particle physics. It is also possible to do that by Maxwell's original theory. And it has been proven in the laboratory. Table 24.

And we include negative energy/ negative time production in those systems and effects. Here's the extended magic rule: First we write down the expres- sion CPTEGS. In this expression, C stands for charge, P stands for (space) parity, T stands for time, E stands for energy, G stands for gravity,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 102 and S stands for entropy. We are referring here to the algebraic sign of each term, and to a complete photon interaction (absorption and re-radiation) with a charged particle inside an atom of matter. Specifically, we are refferring to the result, after the reaction has occurred. Normally the photon interacts with one of the electrons in the atom's outer shell. This interaction with the negative electron charge produces the \"normal\" physical world/physical reality we see around us. In the interaction, normal parityis produced, andnormal gravitation (attraction of mass) is produced. Also, in a series of such interactions, the normal entropy (movement from order to disorder) is txperienced and produced. So in the expression CPTEGS normally the charge term is negative, and every other term is positive, for the complete photon interaction in an atom. Now here is the magic engineering rule: In the complete photon interaction with a charged particle in an atom, if one of these terms is reversed in algebraic sign, all the others will be reversed also. For example, if the photon interacts with the positively charged nucleus, then parity is reversed, the bit of time-advance is reversed, a negative/time-reversed photon is emitted, a tiny bit of antigravity is produced in the nucleus, and negentropy is produced. By negen- tropy, we mean that the emitted photon exhibits the strange charac- teristics of time reversal, and hence it will return from disorder to order. This rule is actually a statement of phase conjugation and time reversed waves, as we shall see later. For example, using the rule, the production of antigravity is straightforward. Simply produce a great excess of negative energy and negative time in an object or generator by scalar photon inter- action with the nucleus, at a sufficient rate. In negative time, gravitational force is reversed. Thus in negative time gravity is a repulsion, not an attraction. Production of excess negative time in the atomic nuclei of a system produces antigravity in that system. Period.* *At 100 Hz about 500 negative watts/lb is required for flotation. At 1 GHz, the effect is so weak it cannot be measured, and no amount of power will float the mirror."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"103 Extraordinary Physics Let me amplify that statement. There are two kinds of energy, negative and positive. Normally, everyone thinks only of positive energy. Take Einstein's formula for the amount of energy that's \"bottled up\" and stored in mass: E = mc 2  (4-11) That's positive energy and positive mass. It automatically im- plies that we are looking at things where time is forward-going. Now suppose we \"charge up\" that mass with negative energy: Then the mass is negative, like this: -E = (-m)c 2 (4-12) And negative mass is repelled by positive mass. (Like mass G- charges attract, unlike mass G-charges repel.) That's all there is to it! Simply charge up the protons/neutrons of the atomic nuclei of a mass with excess phase conjugate (negative) energy/time, and it exhibits antigravity compared to the earth. Nothing could be simpler. Again, it's been done in the laboratory by an associate. So, with respect to a negative energy/negative time generator, you just add more load and draw more negative power from the machine, forcing it to produce more. It produces more negative time, and hence more antigravity and more \"repulsion.\" When the repul- sion balances the earth's attraction, the system \"floats in air.\" Draw still more power by adding still more load, and it accelerates upward. Draw less power by decreasing the load, and it sinks downward again. That's all there is to it. We should have been working upon this, shortly after the U.S. Civil War. Again, there exist two completely different kinds of electromag- netic energy: positive and negative. These have been totally and hopelessly confused by modern physics, even though physicists sometimes use these terms. But in dealing with CPTEGS in the photon interaction in an"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 104 atom, we must clearly keep in mind what kind of energy we are dealing with. The basic engineering rules are these: (1) If any one of the factors - C, P, T, E, G, or S — is reversed, all the others are reversed. (2) If positive charge is involved in the photon interaction, then time (carried by the emitted photon) is negative and so is the energy carried by it. (3) The simplest scalar EM wave may be considered as two EM waves locked together (modulating each other), where one component wave carries positive energy and time and the other com ponent wave carries negative energy and time. (4) Separation of the two components by interaction with charged particles creates both positive and negative time and energy. (5) If the interacting particle is negatively charged, the positive energy/positive time component will interact with it. (6) If the interacting particle is positively charged, the negative energy/negative time component will interact with it. (7) The interacting particle phase conjugates (time reverses) the component with which it interacts. (8) The primary interaction with negative electron shells of atoms yields positive energy and positive time: constituting ordinary physical reality as we observe it. (9) The secondary interaction with the positive atomic nucleus produces phase conjugated (time-reversed) physical reality. (10) Secondary interaction (nuclear phase conjuga- tion) normally produces Newton's third law of motion. (11) In Newton's third law, the reaction force need not be equal, and need not be antiparallel. Note, however, in such case local spacetime is curved. (12) The present law of entropy is only the positive-time half; the other (negative time) half is the negentropy law. Phase Conjugation (Time Reversal) It is a most remarkable fact that Soviet radar engineers and radar scientists are also trained in optics. While this seems little short of astonishing by Western standards, the Soviets have an exceedingly good reason: As a matter of course, most Soviet radar systems are also operable in, or associated with an- other system that is operable in, a time-reversed (phase conjugate) mode. In this mode the radar and/or its associated system is also an"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"105 Extraordinary Physics extremely powerful directed energy weapon, having capabilities undreamed of in the West. A phase-conjugate (time-reversed) wave actually is a wave that travels backward through time.* That is, it is capable of precisely retracing the path through space, taken by another wave that traveled that path to a nonlinear mirror, stimulating the reflection of the time-reversed wave. Further, in retracing its invisible path through space, the phase conjugate replica wave does not diverge as do normal waves. Instead, it continually converges upon its invisible trace. Consequently all its energy arrives back at the distant source that emitted the stimulus wave originally. This was Tesla's original secret of his \"wireless transmission of energy at a distance with no losses.\"** It can easily be shown, however, that the phase conjugate wave is a legitimate solution to the wave equation. Hence it is a general property of all types of waves: sound, magnetohydrodynamic, etc. It is not confined just to the optical band. Obviously such a startlingly different wave has phenomenal uses. Literally it ushers in a new physics. Let us turn now to look at this strange wave that has emerged on our scientific horizon. In the late 1960's, Soviet researchers cautiously pointed out the possibility of a time-reversed wave. Papers appeared in the open Soviet scientific literature, and shortly thereafter U.S. physicists began to read about it. In 1972, Soviet scientists visited Lawrence Livermore Labora- tory and specifically briefed U.S. scientists on the optical phase con- jugation (OPC) phenomenon. Thereafter the effect became of in- creased interest to American scientists. (Note, however, that phase conjugation (PC) is a major phe- nomenon of all physics. It is not confined merely to the optical spectrum, nor just to electromagnetic waves. Phase conjugation is a general phenomenon true of all waves, regardless of type. We will primarily discuss OPC, since most Western experimentation has *T'he external positive-time observer sees this time reversal as length (space) reversal. **The great electrician had actually discovered what today is known as phase conjugation or time reversal of EM waves."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 106 been in the optics domain, and the literature is rich in that respect. However, we also point out that Western scientists have absolutely no inkling of the mechanism causing OPC. They have simply written a model for a time-reversed wave by taking the equation of a normal wave und writing the conjugation (adding an asterisk exponent) to the appropriate term, and pointed out that this new equation also satisfies Maxwell's wave equation. They also do not clearly recognize that an EM wave carries time and energy, and that a time-reversed EM wave carries negative energy and negative time. Further, they do not at all comprehend the startling implications for generating gravitational fields, including antigravity and inertial effects, di- rectly on the laboratory bench.) In optical phase conjugation, when an input EM wave (ordinary) enters a nonlinear medium, the medium \"reflects\" or produces a strange, time-reversed EM wave in response. Figure (35a) shows the effect. In the figure, E1 is the normal input wave, entering a distorting, nonlinear medium (the \"blob\") as shown. Wave E 1 moves on through the blob, emerging on the other side and continuing, though now in distorted form. The medium produces a second wave, E 2 , which precisely re- traces the steps of E 1 That is, everywhere E 1 is, E 2 now appears. The phases of the E 2 wave are precisely reversed from those of E 1 The only difference in the two waves is that wave E 1 carries positive time and positive energy, while wave E 2 carries negative time and nega- tive energy. (U.S. physicists are well aware of everything in the above statement except for the negative energy portion.) The historical background of the phase conjugate wave is given in Table 25. (We strongly stress that the West did not discover the time- reversed wave; the Soviets did. At the time (late 1960's) this ap- peared in the open Soviet literature, the Soviets had already been using it for about two decades in their giant energetics (scalar electromagnetics) weapons development program.) However, to return. The time-reversed wave is called the phase conjugate replica of wave E 1 .

In a photon interac- tion with that particle of mass, the interacting (input) photon (positive energy, positive time) causes the generation and emission of a phase-conjugated (time-reversed) photon. This time-reversed photon provides the precise mechanism for generating Newton's third law: For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction. This will be covered later. But back to our nonlinear medium, and the two waves E 1 and E 2 . E 1 and E 2 are \"locked together\" as a scalar EM wave unless something else is specially done to separate them. That is because the nonlinear medium is a modulator, and the two waves modulate each other (lock together as a single wave). (We interrupt again to strongly point out this fact: This directly shows that all EM waves in vacuum exist as scalar EM waves, not as the so-called Maxwell-Hertz transverse waves of conventional theory. Nikola Tesla, the greatest electrical scientist the world ever produced, always adamantly insisted that EM waves were \"sound\" type waves, not \"transverse\" waves. For one thing, the vacuum- medium would have to be a solid to produce transverse waves! Tesla even visited Hertz in Europe and tried to convince him of the error of his so-called \"proof of transverse EM waves.\" Tesla found Hertz, adamant on the subject, however, and returned without changing Hertz's mind. Ironically, Tesla was right and all the textbooks in the Western world have been consistently in error as to the nature of the EM wave in vacuum.) We simply state here that, for a single-frequency EM sine wave in vacuum, a \"full photon\" of that wave in vacuum is actually a single sine-wave oscillation. The positive (positive energy, positive time) half of that sine wave is the same thing as a virtual electron (negative charge). The negative (negative energy, negative time) half of that sine wave is the same thing as a virtual positron — a virtual electron travelling backwards in time, or \"time-reversed\", which we detect as length-reversed and charge-reversed. Further the vacuum — including the vacuum inside each rela- tively empty \"mass structure\" such as an atom or molecule — is a seething inferno of activity of virtual particle fluxes. It is upon that"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 110 mediumthat all physical reality and physical changes are im- pressed. Thus there is nothing static in the world; what actually exists is switching of virtual particle fluxes. What we call a \"static thing\" is only an equilibrium in this switching activity. And, once switched on, any stream continues until switched off or switched to change it. For that reason, the full photon has always contained twice as much absolute energy as is provided by the presently used equation E = hf  (4-13) Where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is frequency. One half the photon carries negative energy and negative time, while the other half carries positive energy and positive time. In the full photon interaction, one half of the photon interacts and \"switches off\" the stream. Thus the photon interaction makes a single change of action, energy x time, both switching on the beginning of the quantum change and switching off the ending of it. The full photon in vacuum is, and has always been, a scalar EM photon. It rigorously is the presently accepted photon plus its directly \"hooked on\" and accompanying phase conjugated replica photon. That is, in terms of the present physical view, the scalar electro- magnetics view of a full photon in vacuum is that it consists of a photon and its antiphoton, directly combined in serial fashion. Further, this antiphoton part is not identical to the photon, since it is time- and energy-reversed. The present physics makes no distinction between the two types of photons, hence makes no distinction between positive and nega- tive photon energy. It also still considers \"static\" things to independ- ently exist. It does not pursue the fact that all things appearing \"static\" are equilibrium states in nearly unbelievably intense virtual particle streams. Since it does not pursue that fact, it does not build a \"switching\" model for quantum change, not does it arrive at a method of directly engineering these \"switching\" operations. For that reason, present physics has totally missed local general relativity and the engineering of spacetime curva- ture by electrogravitational methods, as was contained in"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"111 Extraordinary Physics Maxwell's original theory. For the same reason, present Western physics has not worked out the basic mechanism that produces phase conjugation, and it has not realized that all conservation laws can be locally violated with the new methods — methods actually hailing back to Maxwell's original theory! Now returning again to our nonlinear medium and waves E 1 and E 2 : It is possible to separate (demodulate) wave E 2 from wave E 1 In that case, E 1 is an ordinary EM wave, carrying positive energy and positive time. E 2 is a phase conjugate replica, carrying negative energy and negative time. Irradiation of an atom in a new sample of material with a normal EM wave such as E 1 , just provides the normal photon interaction with the electron shells. That is, the electron part of the full photon adds to the orbital electron's energy state in positive time, raising the orbital electron to an \"excited state.\" (Remember, this has switched on a continuous process of \"keep raising the energy level of the electron\" in positive time.) The \"state-increasing\" orbital electron then interacts with the second, positron-part of the full photon, which switches off the increasing, leaving the electron in its \"static excited state.\" Simply put, one half of the full photon turns on an uplifting spray, and the second half of the full photon turns off the uplifting spray, leaving the electron in equilibrium state at a new level.* Thus in orthodox physics we have taken the view that an electron in a shell absorbs a \"photon\" from the incident wave, taking extra energy and being raised into an excited energy state. In the orthodox view, the excited-state electron then decays to release another ordinary photon (since it comes from a negative charge). What actually happened was that, when the \"full photon\" of the incident wave is absorbed by the orbital electron, increase of the electron energy is switched on, then switched off, leaving the elec *We state here a magnificient principle without proof. When one furnishes (inputs) electrical power to a system, all the \"input work\" is expended purely upon switching fields by fighting against them in brute-force fashion. E.g., electrical power furnished to an electric motor does not run the motor, but only continually wrestles the internal fields to switch them. Obvi- ously, to build an over-unity device, one must get it to switch its own fields, at least a significant fraction of the time."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 112 tron in equilibrium at a new energy level. What happened in the middle was phase conjugation. In absorb- ing the first half of the incident full photon, the electron acted as a phase conjugate mirror (we will explain that term shortly). It emitted a forward-travelling phase conjugate replica (PCR) of that first photon half, and this conjugate replica entered the nucleus, where it is absorbed to cause the Newtonian reaction force. Note that this PCR emission by the electron does not generate recoil in the electron -PCM, as is well known in OPC theory and experiment. The same type of phase conjugation happened when the state- increasing electron absorbed the second half of the incident full photon. It phase conjugated again, sending this half to the nucleus to acompany the former PCR half. In the nucleus, this second half switches off the increase in excited state of the nucleus that was engendered by absorption of the first half. The photon interaction is a process for switching on and off a continuous rate of action increase or decrease. At the conclusion of the full photon absorption, both the orbital electron and the nucleus are in excited states. The nucleus has incre ased its gravitational mass. Then the situation precisely reverses. Both nucleus and electron dec ay, again emitting full photons and again phase conjugating. The PCR photon emitted by the nucleus reduces the positive mass of the nucleus. The PCR photon emitted by the electron is reversed from the electron's absorption record, reducing the nega- tive charge's energy state, and the electron is said to \"decay\" from its excited state. The PCR photon emitted by the electron now (to the observer) will appear to carry positive time and positive energy. (In passing, we point out that, actually, the situation is far more complicated. Both the electron and the positively charged nucleus are enmeshed in continuous streams of virtual particle flux, includ- ing intense streams of virtual photons. One must go to n-wave mixing, where n is greater than 4, to fully understand the total reaction. The main points are, the Newtonian reaction forces within the atom are generated by phase conjugation, the photon emitted by the decay of an excited state electron will normally carry what we call positive energy and positive time, and the photon emitted by the decay of an excited state positive charge will normally carry what we"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics call negative energy and negative time. Full coverage of these interactions is beyond the scope of this book, and must wait for another effort in the future.). Now once again we return to our simplified model of phase conjugation, and waves E 1 and E 2 in our nonlinear, modulating medium! As we stated, we can engineer the situation so that the phase conjugate replica E 2 can be separated from E 1 . A separated E 2 , however, is a quite different breed of cat. It is a phase conjugate wave, carrying negative energy and negative time. E 2 is a magic wave indeed! Irradiation of the nucleus of an atom in a new sample of material with a phase conjugate replica such as E 2 causes the nucleus of the atom to interact in reverse of its normal interaction.* That is, one of the positive charges in the nucleus interacts with a photon resulting from wave E 2 , and goes into an excited \"negative energy\" state. That state, in decaying, emits an ordinary virtual photon which promptly interacts with a virtual positive charge in the nucleus, which decays to emit the virtual photon, which interacts with another positive charge in the nucleus, etc. In other words, the negative energy of the absorbed antiphoton is captured by the nucleus, and the nucleus overall does not immediately decay to discharge the negative energy. Instead, the nucleus acts as an accumulator or capaci- tance, charging up and then discharging far more slowly than the normal photon/electron interaction. (For the purist, the nucleus does phase conjugate the input negative energy/negative time wave, and phase conjugates it again — upon an electron in the electron shells, through spin coupling This second phase conjugate replica is now just a normal EM wave, and the electron exhibits a normal EM interaction. Thus our instruments (Which are electron wiggle detectors) detect a normal *Irradiation of the nucleus with a PCR wave is easily accomplished by using ordinary magnetic resonance, and modulating the PCR wave upon the magnetic carrier, as Antoine Priore did. 113"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 114 EM wave detection and do not discriminate between photon and antiphoton halves of a full photon. For that reason, scientists have not clearly noticed the difference between positive and negative energy, and between photons and antiphotons. They have also not resolved the basic conflict between the particle and wave theories of electromagnetics. Note that the full photon concept, where the full photon is a normal photon and phase conjugate replica of that photon hooked together into a single sine wave, resolves the long-standing wave-particle controversy.) In most of their instruments, present scientists are detecting a secondary normal EM wave for the phase conjugate replica interac- tion, since the phase conjugate interactions in the instrument are not sorted out, and since the instruments measure only one kind of PCR, that emitted by a negatively charged electron. Hence scien- tists think the antiphoton has positive energy, and interpret it in positive time. Consequently they tend to accent that the wave is \"phase-reversed,\" and not accent the negative time/negative energy implications since they have not clearly sorted them out. Let us return to our consideration of the irradiation of the nucleus of an atom (with an incident E 2 phase conjugate replica wave carrying negative energy and negative time, with respect to our electron-wiggle-detecting observer). AS irradiation continues, the actual \"structured charge pattern\" existing on the incident E 2 wave slowly charges up the nucleus of the atom with that exact charge structure, in the negative energy/ negative time state. We shall find that most interesting fact of great utility when we later discuss the mind, thought, cellular control systems, and gener- ating a specific electromagnetic phase conjugation pattern to re- verse cellular disease. We shall also find that it is of great interest in accomplishing antigravity when we use extremely low frequency PCR irradiation. The Phase Conjugate Mirror Any system which phase conjugates the input wave and returns a phase conjugate \"reflection\" is called a phase conjugate mirror, or PCM for short."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"115 Extraordinary Physics But the phase conjugate mirror has some very unique proper- ties, as can be seen in figure 35b. For example, if you look in a normal mirror, you see your own reflection. You see your shoes and legs, for example. Light from your shoe scatters across the mirror, and it hits one spot on the mirror which reflects it at the proper angle to strike your eye. But that simply doesn't happen with a phase conjugate mirror! If you were looking into a phase conjugate mirror (PCM), the light that left your shoe and scattered across the mirror would be reflected right back to the shoe, since it would retrace the path taken by the previous light striking all across the PC mirror from the shoe. So all you would be able to see would be two black dots: the retinas of your eyes. Light reflecting off them and striking the PCM would be reflected back to the source — the retinas — so you could see that light and that light only. This path reversal is most important to keep in mind. With a phase conjugate signal, you are not functioning with an ordinary signal. Further, it has a \"precursor\" path taken by the incident wave that stimulated its emission from the PCM. Unless interfered with, the PCR will trace back down the invisible vacuum trace of that incident wave, or back down its wave path, like electricity goes down a wire. This, by the way, is the secret of Tesla's wireless transmis- sion of energy at a distance with no losses. When broadcast into space, a normal EM wave (positive time, positive energy) diverges or scatters from its path. Precisely the opposite happens with a PCR wave. When broad- cast (reflected) into space, the PCR wave continually converges back upon the invisible trace taken by its incident stimulus precursor. Thus all the PCR energy is continually converging upon an invisible beam or \"wire\" through the vacuum, back to the source of the original incident wave.* If the PCR wave is highly amplified (and means to do this are now well-known), then large amounts of EM energy can be precisely *One can effectively move the entire imprinted vacuum path, however, by adding an additional input vector wave computed so that the resultant input would have come from the desired shifted distant point.

If a micro-microwatt is received from a point thousands of miles distant, then a gigawatt can readily be returned precisely to that distant point. This was Tesla's magic secret. The great electrician had discov- ered phase conjugation, though he did not use that term. He did, however, point out that he could create an invisible wire through space to a distant point, and could send any amount of energy to that distant point without any scattering losses along the way. He also accomplished the same thing with sound waves and mechanical waves. He pointed out that he could produce an undi- minished physical (mechanical) effect at any distant point, and could eventually split the earth if he added power long enough. Tesla had given the principles of radar in World War I! He later even spoke of his \"big eye that can see at a distance.\" Here he was probably referring to stimulating the emission of a PCR return from that target. The PCR would automatically correct for the distortion in the intervening medium, and fairly sharp pictures of the distant scene — without showing the size dispersion of distance — could probably be obtained. Note that a non-scattering signal to a distant observer does not make him suffer any loss in field or apparent size and detail of the scanned object, which can be recovered to any resolution, limited only by the state of the art of the physical realization technology. The implications for far greater resolution microscopy— far heyond the present limitation to about 4,500 — should be immediately obvious. The implications of such a microscope - that can see directly inside atomic nuclei; photograph nuclei and fundamental particles directly; see living viruses, molecules, and atoms directly; and theoretically see even into the virtual state itself— should be immediately obvious. I n discovering phase conjugation, the Soviet Union was attempt- ing to break Tesla's secret of wireless transmission of energy without losses, and the Soviet scientists did so by about 1950. They highly weaponized the effects of phase conjugation, phase conjugate mir- rors, and amplified phase conjugate mirrors, both in radar waves,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"117 Extraordinary Physics mechanical waves, and sound waves, for nearly two decades. Then the Soviets cautiously stimulated the open literature with a limited paper on optical phase conjugation, to ascertain whether or not we realized the severe weapon implications of time-reversed waves, their production and use, and their amplification. So phase conjugate mirrors can do very useful things. For example, look again at figure 35a. Suppose we are trying to photograph something on the other side of the distorting medium, say through a distorting gas, such as a turbulent atmosphere. In that case E 1 on the left is, say, light coming from an object on the left and passing through that distorting medium. If we just used ordinary waves in a camera on the right, we would see a very distorted wavefront, as represented by the distorted E 1 . However, if we illuminate the object by sending a wave through the distorting medium, and detect the phase conjugate signal that returns, it will have reversed the distortion when it gets to us, and we will get a clear picture. A very nice photo of just this process is contained in David M. Pepper, \"Applications of Optical Phase Conjugation,\" Scientific American, 254 (1), Jan. 1986, p. 75. Phase conjugation has many more uses than we have covered in this brief paper, of course, but this is an important use: the removal of distortion effects from optical systems. It would, however, be nice to be able to amplify the effect. And so we can. Amplifying the Phase Conjugate Effect Let's look now at figure 36, where we will develop how to amplify the phase conjugate replica. Be careful to notice that we are changing subscripts on you. By convention, optical scientists use A 1 and A 2 as two additional waves, called the pump waves, that are used to stress the nonlinear medium, and input signal wave A 4 . Wave A 3 then is the stimulated PCM output, or the phase conjugate replica (PCR) wave. In this figure we show a scheme for amplifying the phase conjugate signal that is generated and returned by the phase conjugate mirror (PCM). We do this by adding two opposing waves of the same frequency"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 118 (in this simplified case). These are the two \"pump waves\", and impressing them upon the PCM is called \"pumping\" the PCM. Actually, in producing the pump wave, we are adding two input waves of the same frequency, 180 degrees out of phase with each other. Since the nonlinear medium is a modulating medium, the waves are forced to modulate each other and \"lock together\" as a single scalar EM wave of most interesting characteristics. Indeed, its E fields sum to a zero resultant vectorially, and its B-fields sum to B zero resultant vectorially. However, the scalar parts remain and are multiplied together, as in the original Maxwell quaternion theory. Since the magnitudes of the vector components in the scalar summation (quaternion multiplication, since we are addressing modulation) are varying, then the magnitude of the remaining scalar part is varying. We have therefore produced a standing scalar wave in the nonlinear material medium, having zero vector EM gradient components. We have produced a purely scalar EM wave of pure potential — and this is an electrogravitational wave, rigorously, since it represents a time oscillation of the local energy density (local virtual particle flux density) of vacuum. This scalar EM wave passes through the electron shells and enters the nuclei, where it is phase decoupled by the extreme nonlinearity of the violent virtual particle currents of the nucleus. Its energy is then absorbed by the nucleus, raising it to an excited pseudopotential. This potential decays, returning the scalar EM stress wave into the local vacuum and area. We are now pumping the atomic nuclei of the nonlinear PCM material with our two pump waves, and we have created an oscillating local gravitational field around the PCM. This increased nuclear G-potential, looked at in Kaluza-Klein theory, is a 5-space potential. It is ready to burst out in the 5th dimension (as electromagnetic bleedoff) at the slightest provocation. That provocation is the entrance and absorption of the input signal wave, E 4 . Note that E 4 acts as an \"initiator\" (or a pinprick into a highly inflated balloon, if you will) on the built-up, excited 5- dimensional gravitational pseudopotential of the nuclei.

Summarizing figure 36 and amplification of the phase conjugate replica: When we consider the addition of the input wave and the resulting phase conjugate wave that will be produced, we shall have a total of four waves. Thus this particular process is called four-wave. mixing.* On the diagram in Figure 39, A 1 and A 2 by convention are taken to be the two opposing EM pump waves. Notice that these two pump waves stress the medium. Since the medium is nonlinear, it is a modulator. Hence the two pump waves modulate each other. The two waves thus lock together into a scalar EM wave. This scalar EM wave is an oscillating artificial scalar EM stress wave, and it goes directly into the atomic nuclei of the medium and pumps the nuclei themselves. The atomic nuclei are now rhythmically stressed with the oscillating scalar wave. *Probably the best single introduction to optical phase conjugation in the English language is David M.

By our CPTEGS rule, the positively- charged nuclei generate a negative energy/negative time wave — in short, a phase conjugate replica wave. Further, it is a highly amplified PCR, and may contain as much raw energy as was fed into the pumped mirror by our pump waves. This \"seeker wave\" or \"electromagnetic missile\" wave then sets out on its invisible path through space, seeking a distant \"A 4 source point\" and delivering all its energy intact to that point. The Phase Conjugate Mirror as a Vacuum Triode The pumped phase conjugate mirror (four wave mixing) can best be understood as a special kind of vacuum triode. The pumped artificial potential on the atomic nucleus provides a powerful cathode in positive time, and a powerful plate as well in negative or reversed time. The electron shields, in their spin coupling to the nucleus, act as a grid in positive time. The input signal A 4 itself acts as a relatively weak signal onto the grid of the triode. The positive charge difference in potential between the powerful pump potential of the nucleus (cathode, in forward time) acts as the plate voltage. The decrease of this potential when discharging (increase of the negative time, negative aspect) acts as the produc- tion of a plate signal to the negative time operation (production of the amplified, time-reversed PCR wave). The excited nucleus immediately decays upon stimulus by the \"grid signal\" A 4 , emitting a \"time- and energy-reversed\" strong signal — in short, amplified phase conjugate replica wave E 3 . The amplified phase conjugate signal moves from the cathode (nucleus) out to the electron shells and beyond, precisely because it is time-reversed. To a time-reversed signal, the grid (normal input) acts as the final plate (external output) — that is, in negative time, the elements ofthe triode are reversed. This makes it possible for the material to emit the powerful PCR. I have called this effect/analogy a vacuum triode, to accent the direct engineering possibilities.

The actual \"amplitude gain\" of the vacuum triode is the ratio of the amplitude of A 3 to the amplitude of A 4 . The square of the amplitude gain is proportional to the power gain; this entity is called the nonlinear power reflection coefficient. Figure (38a) shows the typical nonlinear power reflection coeffi- cient for a pumped phase conjugate mirror, as a function of the input energy and the depth of the material. As the input signal increases, the gain increases. The ultimate condition would be that the \"free oscillation\" condition is approached. This occurs when the angle between the input wave A 4 and the pump waves A 1 and A 2 is 90 degrees. Figure (38b.) shows the oscillation condition and the fraction of the total pump power that is in the input wave A 4 and its output phase conjugate replica A 3 . At the oscillation condition, an \"infinite\" gain exists at the correct depth in the medium. This means that essentially all the energy being fed into the pump waves A 1 and A 2 will now be emitted in the output wave A 3 . At that point, \"saturation cutoff\" of the triode output occurs, and it cannot output higher energy, since it has no more. Notice that, at the oscillation condition, for the slightest output, the full power of the pump waves is fed into the phase conjugate replica. This powerful wave then retraces the path taken by the o riginal input signal, unless something else is done to divert it.* The interesting question then arises: Since we can have infinite gain, can we get a special oscillation condition so that the pump wave furnishes its own energy? In other words, can the pump wave \"resonate\" with the vacuum flux in such a fashion that it is self- pumping and self-perpetuating? In at least three materials, the answer is yes. Such effects have been experimentally accomplished in special forms of barium ti- ta nate. See, for example, J. O. White et al, \"Coherent oscillation by self-induced gratings in the photorefractive crystal BaTiO 3 ,\" Appl. Phys. Lett., vol. 40, 1982. p. 450. *Recall that the PCR can be steered by introducing a minute wave A 5 to vectorially sum with input A 4 , In that case, the effective input is the vector resultant of (A 4 + A 5 ).

Theoretically it applies to any sort of wave: electromagnetic, scalar, sound, mechani- cal, etc. By using it, incredible new effects and an entirely new physics can be accomplished. It is a new and exciting field, little- known outside specialist circles, and still not well-understood. Most discoveries in the field are yet to be made.* Newton's Third Law and the Full Law of Entropy For example, the present author noticed that Newton's third law— for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction — is actually a result of phase conjugation. To explain that, we diverge a bit. First, phase conjugation is also involved in the fact that a charged particle of mass is a little \"dynamo\" or engine. Actually, a particle of mass is itself a \"nonlinearity\" in vacuum spacetime. When a photon (virtual or observable) strikes a particle of mass and is absorbed by it, it's the same as \"interacting with a nonlinear medium.\" In terms of virtual photons, the charged particle is continually bombarded with them, from the vacuum flux. The charged particle, being a \"nonlinear medium\", phase conjugates each input virtual photon, emitting a phase conjugate replica. If it absorbs a normal virtual photon, it emits a \"negative energy, negative time\" phase conjugate replica. If it absorbs a normal virtual photon, it emits a \"negative energy, positive time\" phase conjugate replica — just a normal virtual photon. Note that the particle of mass thus does not exist in time. Or, it exists equally in positive and negative time. Since we only observe particles, it follows that time is not normally an observable, as quantum mechanics has assumed. The emission of a phase conjugate replica does not affect the momentum of the emitting PCM, as is well-known. For an observable photon, the particle (nonlinear medium) absorbs the normal photon, which does not affect the energy and momentum of the PCM particle of mass. If there is no other mass to accept the PCR, it just moves off. *The U.S. may finally be waking up. SDI is now starting to study EM missiles \"in the time domain\" as opposed to frequency. See Av. Wk. & Spurn Tech., Feb. 29, 1988, p. 56."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 126 If there is another mass to accept the PCR, the PCR is absorbed and phase conjugated by it. A charged particle in vacuum is continually bombarded by a flux of essentially \"randomized\" fluctuations. However, on the average these all \"average out\" to zero. Any particle is automatically in a very high vacuum potential, and is in a state of great agitation at all times, even if it's \"at rest\" with respect to ordinary observers. It's really \"smeared all over the place,\" so to speak. When we expose a charged particle to a normal potential, the interior virtual particle flux of that potential is disorganized. Hence the particle just \"wiggles a bit more frantically,\" so to speak, randomly in every direction. However, when we expose a charged particle to an artificial potential made by zero summed/multiplied EM force fields or waves, the particle wiggles more frantically in organized directions.* This is just as true for virtual particles as it is for observable particles. Thus the use of such artificial potentials in scalar electromag- netics enables us to overcome the disorder of the internal structure of normal electromagnetics. By this means, we can structure the vacuum, organize electricity and electromagnetic waves, accomplish negentropy, curve local spacetime in complex, deterministic fash- ions , produce free energy and antigravity, reorganize and transmute nuclei (transmute elements) with miniscule input energy, etc. Rigorously, this means that the present law of entropy is only half of the full law of entropy. Specifically, it is the \"positive time, positive energy\" half of the law, and it states that in closed real physical systems, continuing operations of ordered \"positive time, positive energy\" effects tend to inevitable \"disordered\" effects pro- duced in the apparatus or system. In other words, the present law of entropy really states that no ordered system is totally closed. The system will inevitably have energy and actions that escape the system's order, and hence (to the system) this escape represents \"loss of order\" — or in short, disorder. The present law of entropy specifically excludes (by implication) * I.e., the electronic noise is partially organized. This is a major key toward building scalar EM detectors.

However, experimentally we can produce both negative energy and negative time, in deliberately time-reversed operations such as phase conjugation and with devices thnt serve as phase conjugate mirrors. Further, we can amplify the phase conjugation and disorder-to-order operations. Hence the present law of entropy is incomplete, and states only half the true possibilities. The other half of the law is the law of negentropy. In this law, disordered operations outside the ordered system undergo time-reversed (and possibly amplified) effects. These reordered energy effects — which may be highly amplified in"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 128 comparison to the disordered escaped energy—reenter the \"ordered system\", restoring order. Since this process moves in negative time, it goes from disorder to order. Hence it is negentropic. Therefore we have solved the old thermodynamic problem of the \"eventual decay of the universe into disorder.\" Not to worry; the other half of the full law of entropy prescribes negentropic operations in negative time/negative energy, and these restore the order of the universe. That takes care of the problem. It also means that, in highly disordered systems of many degrees of freedom and far from thermodynamic equilibrium (that is, when the disorder law is saturated), then one can expect to see further stress \"create\" negative time and hence create order emerging and stabilizing from disorder. And of course that is exactly what is seen. Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1977 for writing a new thermodynamics predicting precisely such effects, and experiments have proved his case. But to return to Newton's third law: Newton abstracted his third law from the classical interaction between two colliding balls. If one ball is at rest and another approaches it at some velocity, the approaching ball carries momentum and kinetic energy. As it \"collides\" with the resting mass, quantum mechanics tells us what actually happens: Particles of mass in the moving ball are producing virtual photons continually, and these virtual photons strike the particles of mass of the resting ball and are absorbed by it. The resting mass now acquires extra energy and momentum from the absorbed photons. At the same time, it acts as a nonlinear medium. It produces phase conjugate replica virtual photons, and these time-reversed virtual photons are emitted. These photons produce no change in momentum or energy upon the emitting mass. However, being phase conjugates, they precisely follow back along the paths taken by the first or \"stimulus\" virtual photons, striking the moving ball. They are absorbed by that ball, producing (to the external observer) negative momentum and negative energy in it."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"129 Extraordinary Physics These subtract from the kinetic momentum and kinetic energy of the moving ball, reducing them. The virtual photons emitted by the approaching ball perform positive work upon the target ball. The virtual, phase conjugated photons, emitted in return by the mass of the struck ball as a PCM, reverse to strike the approaching ball to do negative work upon it. Notice that twice as much absolute work is always done on the system of two balls as we \"input\" with the approaching ball. Also notice that, if we directly \"engineer\" the phase conjugation of the struck system, we can directly tamper with, and drastically change, the production of the negative energy and negative momen- tum in the moving ball. Hence we can drastically alter Newton's third law. We can now make a Maxwell's Demon. This alone clearly establishes that it is perfectly possible to build a so-called free energy device. Though subtle mechanisms must be used, it's nothing more spectacular than putting a paddle wheel in a river, and extracting shaft power from the wheel, furnished by the river's current.

For just one example, by phase conjugation, real-time holography can be accomplished without having to separately make and illuminate the holograms. Now with holography and multiple projectors — and particu- larly with two intersecting \"normal\" beams to backtrack upon with ever-converging PCR signals—you can assemble a \"form of energy\" at an appreciable distance from the projectors in three dimensional space. With phase conjugation, you can do it in real time. And you can do it at a great distance back along the path of any signal you use as an input. By using PCM holography, degradation with distance is not appreciably experienced. After all, the PCR waves utilized are ever- converging. The energy does not diverge and spread. Therefore, if you can make a 6\" diameter ball of intense EM energy at a short distance in the laboratory, you can make that same 6\" diameter ball of intense energy at several thousand kilometers distance, using PCR real-time interference holography. With highly amplified PCM's, you can put far more energy into the distant interference form than you can with normal holography. Conceivably it is possible to assemble so much energy in the holog- raphy \"object\" that it condenses into a real material object! In other words, it materializes or semi-materializes. Both the \"intense light form\" usage and semi-materialization of forms (such as light forms, flying geometrical forms, etc.) have been created worldwide by the Soviets for decades, to stimulate UFO reports and provide a deception plan for their development and testing of large, strategic energetics weapons using highly amplified PCMs and PCR holography.* Other bizarre considerations also arise. For example, in radi- onics one utilizes a \"witness\"—such as a photograph—of the object one is attempting to send \"energy\" to.

There exists a continuous, invisible \"stimulus photon and its connections\" trace in time and space, between the plant when the photo was taken and that photo now, even if one or both of them have moved. That trace is highly persistent (as Australian experimenters Reid and Barsamian have shown). A phase conjugate (time-re- versed) signal can be made to retrace that track and travel all the way back to the plant, in the present. The effect of using the photo (or sample of the object) as such a \"witness\" of the real plant and directing weak PCR energy back along the invisible trace into the object is called radionics. In most cases, the two cerebral hemi- spheres of the operator's brain are depended on to form the necessary scalar \"pump wave\" to pump the \"witness\" and produce phase conjugated signal energy, time-reversed to travel back into the distant object.* The problem with present radionics is that it is far too weak, and it is \"operator dependent\", changing with the mood, temperament, and skill of the operator. It does objectively work, however, though Often erratically. In countries such as England, France, and Ger- many, use of radionics to treat human disease is legal and permitted, though operators (for example, in England) must undergo extensive training and certification. Its results are roughly comparable to the results of normal medical doctors. Radionics does not replace orthodox medicine. It can successfully treat certain things that orthodox doctors have little or no success with (such as lupus), and orthodox medicine can successfully treat many things that radionics has little success with (a broken leg or ruptured appendix, for example). The two treatments are best used in conjunction with each other. However, we must point out that a new, amplified PCM radion- ics is likely to emerge in the near future. Such a new approach will offer highly effective, powerful treatment of diseases, even at a distance, by amplified PCR electromagnetics. Again, the radiation in and from a photo or witness of a diseased patient can be used as a \"grid signal\" into a powerful, pumped phase conjugate mirror.

Of course, any powerful tool is two-edged. It can be used for harm as well as good. I think the reader can appreciate the damage that can be done to systems and persons at a distance by means of such powerful new amplified PCM radionics devices. You can also see the security problems posed to large comput- ing facilities in banks, federal facilities, state and municipal facili- ties, the IRS, U.S. military weapon systems, ships, aircraft, etc. Obviously such devices are going to have to be highly regulated and controlled. Else criminal operators will be killing people and destroying things wholesale, secretly and at a distance, and they will have perfect legal alibis to allow them to escape prosecution. To summarize: if a photograph or witness pattern of an object or person can be correctly stimulated by phase conjugate electromag- netics so that the emulsion acts again as a PCM, can one not argue that—theoretically — phase conjugate energy from the photograph and the instrument can be sent back along all paths, all the way back to the original object? After all, this has been rigorously demon strated by University of Sydney researchers. Is there not an actual physical mechanism for radionics? For highly amplified, powerful radionics where the operator himself is removed from the circuit?

To do this, scalar EM utilizes summed-zero vector forces and force fields to construct polarized vacuum potentials. Although externally it has zero E and B vector gradients, an \"artificial\" potential possesses an internal, dynamic E and B vector field structure. This \"infolded\" (Bohm's term) structure has finite size and is deterministic. The infolded structure of the artificial potential in turn deterministically structures and polarizes the vacuum and curves spacetime locally, contrary to presently as- sumed limitations of general relativity. Since in free vacuum a potential normally extends to infinity in a decaying exponential fashion, then this infolded E and B vector structure of an artificial potential extends to infinity in a decaying exponential fashion. The artificial potential itself may be rhythmically varied either in structure, magnitude, frequency, or all of the above. This pro- duces waves of potential, and waves of the structure of vacuum/ spacetime — again, in the free vacuum case, reaching to infinity in a \"decaying exponential\" fashion. These \"scalar EM waves\" are gravitational waves. Each photon (one major wave length of the \"carrier\", complete with modulations) of the scalar EM wave also has structure (its included modulations). Modulated waves have compound or \"giant\" photons — photons containing infolded photons. Each compound photon of such a scalar EM wave is a vacuum engine. It deliberately structures and patterns — dynamically — the energy density and charge of vacuum. (1) By canonically varying two or more components of the electromagnetic vector structure of the zero-summed EM force vector system, the local structure of vacuum spacetime is macro- scopically varied in its internal composition.

This is simple vari- ation of overall curvature of local spacetime, involving primarily relativistic effects. Rigorously, each of these two methods produces a localized gravitational wave, where the local stress of vacuum is deliberately patterned as well as oscillated in amplitude. Both methods may be applied simultaneously (and multiple infolded times) to produce an even more sophisticated gravitational wave, and more sophisticated structuring of the local stress energy density of vacuum. The resulting unified electromagnetics/gravitation is called scalar electromagnetics, since the electrogravitational effects are obtained by deliberately opposing EM vector force fields so that they vectorially sum or multiply to a zero vector EM resultant, while the infolded (Bohm's term) EM vector components structure and vary the stress energy density of vacuum.* * Gravitational potential is just \"in-folded and locked in\" dynamic electromagnetic forces.

The use of the scalar EM wave directly engineers the virtual state and the vacuum itself. Hooper's work represented important work in this respect, as does other related experimental work by Bedini, Watson, Golden, Dea, Faretto, Beck, and other inventor colleagues who do not wish their names mentioned. Scalar EM theory also bears a strong relationship to the Kaluza- Klein unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetics. At least five dimensions — four spatial and one time — are required as a minimum. Nested levels of virtual state may be modeled as identical to successive hyperspaces. Internested levels of zero-summed vector EM force fields allow the direct engineering of those hyperspaces. Negative energy and negative time flow are especially important when building free energy devices and antigravity. The mechanism producing negative energy and negative time flow is the forced amplified production and absorption of phase conjugated waves. In addition, phase conjugation is a basic phenomenon of nature: for example, as previously pointed out, it is the direct mechanism that generates Newton's third law of motion. It also adds a negen- tropy law (for negative energy/negative time). Accordingly, if we engineer phase conjugation, we can change Newton's third law to our will. And we can invoke the negentropy half of the total law of entropy, so that we can go from disorder back to order. Again, we can make a Maxwell's Demon at will! In Newton's third law, when manipulated locally, the reaction force need not necessarily be equal in magnitude to the action force It also need not necessarily be parallel to it. It can even be phase conjugated itself to yield an addition force, assisting the propelling of a particular engine or device. Phase conjugation may also be manipulated so as to cause like magnetic poles to attract, and unlike poles to repel. Magnetic \"force field lines\" of a bar magnet normally exist in conjugate co-existing pairs.

The second line of the pair is a phase conjugate of the first, and exists in negative observer time. Thus, to the \"positive time only\" observer, it will appear to run from the south pole to the north pole, perfectly retracing the path of its twin. Howard Johnson uses a \"two particle\" theory of magnetic field, for example, where one particle (photon) is the phase conjugate of the other. This is identically the same as the scalar electromagnetics concept of phase conjugate pairs of field lines. By very complex, specialized, compound permanent magnets, Johnson is able to partially separate the two lines, and spatially concentrate or dimin- ish the phase conjugation (negative time) component in a given area of operation. If the negative time component lines are concentrated to out- weigh the positive component lines in a local region, then the laws of magnetics are reversed in that region. There like poles attract and unlike poles repel. In his rotary permanent magnet motor design, he concentrates the negative time component in that part of the rotation where a north rotor pole is approaching a north stator pole. Normally, in this part of the cycle, one has to overcome the repulsion of like poles to \"force energy\" into the device for later extraction. However, now in that region like poles attract. There the north pole of the rotor is attracted toward the north pole of the stator, adding impetus to the rotor. As the rotating north pole passes the stator north pole, it leaves the region of negative time concentration and returns to a normal \"positive time\" region again. Now the north poles repel again, and impetus is again added to the rotor. In that manner Johnson is able to violate local conservation energy, and make a \"free energy\" permanent magnet motor. The motor will rotate itself and deliver constant shaft power to a me- chanical load. By attaching a standard electrical generator, normal electrical power is continually and freely produced by the complete motor generator power system. Johnson's complex nonlinear magnets severely curve local spacetime, allowing local violation of energy conservation."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics Scalar EM View of the Vacuum In the modern quantum mechanical view, the vacuum is not an emptiness, but instead is a plenum. Today the vacuum is considered to be filled with incredible virtual particle activity. From nowhere, virtual particles continu- ally arise — even with fierce energy — then disappear again into nowhere, so rapidly that they cannot be individually observed. However, these virtual particles are quite real, for they cause all the forces of nature when they interact in the aggregate with observable particles. To the observer, the fleeting particles also appear and disappear in both positive time and negative time. That is, the flux consists of both particles and antiparticles. Thus the vacuum is a seething inferno of virtual particle fluxes. The concept of an ether is again accepted. It refers to this \"virtual flux\" vacuum. Note, however, that this is an ether far different from the old material ether that was theorized prior to relativity. In the new vacuum ether, every imaginable type of particle continually and spontaneously arises (creation) and disappears (annihilation) at every point in the vacuum, according to modern quantum mechanics. The rate of this seething virtual particle creation and annihila- tion is essentially unlimited. Hence the \"flux density\" of vacuum is essentially unlimited. Further, any virtual particle created has a flux of even finer virtual particles associated, and so on without limit. The vacuum's virtual particle flux is thus comprised of nested levels of ever finer virtual particle fluxes, in the modern view. We state without proof that each deeper virtual level may be modeled as a higher dimension (hyperdimension). This yields an infinite-dimensional vacuum spacetime (hyper- space) that is identically the infinite nested levels of virtual state. At the same time, every nucleus in the universe is continually absorbing and emitting scalar EM (electrogravitational) waves. The emitted scalar EM waves of pure potential are waves in the stress and structuring of the vacuum itself. 139"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 140 VACUUM IS IDENTICAL TO: • VIRTUAL PARTICLE FLUX • SPACETIME • ANENERGY • MASSLESS CHARGE VACUUM IS: • MADE OF UNQUANTIZED ACTION • WITHOUT DEFINITE LENGTH INTERVALS • WITHOUT DEFINITE TIME INTERVALS • N-DIMENSIONAL (UNFIXED) Figure 44.

This scalar EM flux causally drives (constitutes) all the enormous quivering of the vacuum spacetime medium itself. In other words, it drives subquantum (virtual) change, which in turn drives quantum change. This is a drastic reorientation of quantum mechanics. In scalar EM, we view that the virtual flux of vacuum is causally driven or created by interacting scalar EM waves. This replaces the present view that the virtual flux is entirely chance. It opens up the direct engineering and structuring of the vacuum — and hence the atomic nucleus — by scalar EM means. However, it does not replace the normal statistical nature of the basic changes of the background vacuum medium. We normally have little or no knowledge of the myriad of drivers that cause the basic background waves of that medium. We may, however, delib- erately create special vacuum potential waves which are determin- is tic, and which we have knowledge of. To the observer, from a purely statistical viewpoint, in this violent vacuum flux any and every finite pattern of virtual particles is also continually being momentarily created and destroyed — and at every level and in every hyperdimension. Thus, in the vacuum there continually exists — at any and every point, and in any and every region — the ghostly image of anything and everything, whether in the past, present, or future; and whether potential, probabilistic, or actual.

As the coalescing operation continues, the light-form will eventually be- come fully formed. If it continues, it will start to coalesce further into thin, ghostly material form, appearing much like a faint fog-form. With continued coalescing, it will become a very solid, material form which exerts pressure on tree limbs, breaks them, leaves traces, etc. Long ago I dubbed this process kindling. It is rather widely met in paranormal phenomena of many types. But back to the basic idea of ghostly images in the virtual states of vacuum. In this view, Everett's many-worlds interpretion (MWI) of quan- tum mechanics is literal and real, albeit the additional worlds are to bo taken as virtual and hyperdimensional to the laboratory observer. (It is rather simple to show that ever deeper, nested levels of the virtual state are exactly the same thing as ever higher dimensions. By \"rotating\" an object in many-dimensional space, one can show that, after three rotations, a physical object has lost all physical intersections with our normal 3-space, to us now only occupying time . Since this is the precise characteristic of a thought form, I used this phenomenon and spatiotemporal model to make a multidimen- sional space model directly including thought, mind and matter. That is, one is thus able to form a unified field theory of mind, th ought, life, and matter — a model that is testable, makes predic- tions , and actually unites physics and metaphysics. That work and its plications, however, are largely beyond the scope of this book.) It is stressed that the basic scalar EM image (interpretation) of reality is directly implied by quantum mechanics. It is not idle metaphysics. Other than the scalar EM wave causality for the observer's statistical microscopic dynamics (and the extended model unifying mind, thought, life, and matter), it is not the construct of this author.

Further, the magnitude of the selected flux (usually expressed as a flux density) through the point may be taken as the magnitude of the vacuum's charge there in that type of particle. In other words, at a point the magnitude of the vacuum's charge (VPF) is one type of potential at that point. Various kinds of fluxes constitute various kinds of charge, and comprise various kinds of potentials. Immediately we see that one type of charge may always be decomposed into other kinds of charge, as can potentials. This point is beyond the scope of this book and will not be further amplified. Continuing our example, the magnitude of the electrostatic scalar potential at a point in vacuum represents the magnitude of the flux of virtual photons through the point, and hence the electrical charge at the point.

By Dirac theory, a positron is an electron traveling backwards in time. Further, pair production produces time-smeared particles — an electron and a positron. Pair production, then, actually produces two electrons, one coupled to (smeared in) a positive piece of time and one coupled to (smeared in) a negative piece of time. Thus in the vacuum two discretized streams of time, one positive and one negative, are continually created in conjunction with pair production, and destroyed by pair annihilation. Further, integration of tiny virtual pieces of time (from virtual photons) to form \"passage of time\" macroscopically is directly asso- ciated with the charge (the absorption and emission of virtual particles) of an observable particle. This is what is meant by an object \"existing\" (persisting). Its continual virtual photon interactions are integrated by its mass (timeless part) to continually create its energy states and its march through time. The absorption and emission of an abservable photon, however, moves the mass (timeless part) in (comparatively) larger jumps through time. The absorption of the photon connects a positive piece of time to the mass of the particle, converting it to masstime. The subsequent emission of an observable photon \"tears off the little time-tail,\" so-to-speak, and leaves behind a totally spatial mass entity, having no large connection to \"the flow of time.\" This is what is really meant by \"observation.\" Because the \"observation\" disconnects time from the previously \"excited mass\" (masstime), then it follows that time is not an observable.

That is, a photon is a little piece of energy, welded to a little piece of time, with no seam in the middle. Two kinds of photons exist: the normal photon exists as (+dE) (+dt). The phase conjugate photon exists as (-dE) (-dt). Figure 59. A photon is a single oscillation of a carrier wave.

If the photon is less than h in magnitude, then it is a virtual photon. A simple photon in vacuum can also be considered to be one cycle of a sine wave. One half of the sine waves exists in positive time, hence is/contains a virtual electron. The other half of the sine wave exists in negative time, hence it is/contains a virtual positron — an electron traveling backward in time. This second half of the full photon (a single sine wave oscillation) is the phase conjugate (time reversal) of the first half. As we stated previously, the full photon in vacuum actually exists as a presently visualized \"positive time\" photon and a phase conjugate \"negative time\" photon , a \"serially linked pair,\" where each photon is only one-half the sine wave. This resolves the conflict inherent in wave/particle duality. It also has a great deal to say about engineering the vacuum and about detectors and the detection process. In the spontaneous decay of a virtual photon, it can be seen that one part (the virtual electron) is associated with positive energy and positive time; the other part (the virtual positron) is associated with negative energy and negative time. The continual \"switching\" between positive and negative time in an observable particle's absorption and emission of virtual photons (and the associated electron/position +t/-t pairs) means that the positive flow of time, to the macroscopic observer, is continually being \"started\" and \"stopped\" (created and destroyed). This continual attachment and detachment of positive time to and from the \"observer particle\" creates the \"past\" and the \"future\" to which the observer seems somehow to be connected, and yet not connected.

In a curved spacetime (nonlinear vacuum), one of the two triplets (positive electron/energy/time or negative electron/energy/time) predominates. Hence in a curved spacetime the rate of flow (produc- tion) of the two time streams is unequal, as is the production of the two kinds of energy and the two kinds of electrical charge. A locally curved spacetime thus produces a predominance of either positive or negative electrons, and either positive or negative energy, and a predominance of the addition of either positive or negative time production. The curved spacetime acts as a local source or sink accordingly, and both conservation of energy and conservation of charge can be locally violated in such a curved spacetime region. As we stated, the locally curved spacetime produces either positive time or negative time more predominantly, acting as a source or sink for normal (positive) observer time. The local rate of flow of the observer's time can thus be speeded up or slowed down, depending upon the type of local spacetime curvature utilized. It follows, then, that standing local gravitational waves can result in localized, stable gradients in the vacuum virtual particle flux, between the \"high potential\" part of the standing wave and the \"low potential\" part.

This severe assumption had the effect of \"saving\" the sacrosanct conservation laws, and maintaining the exclusion of electrogravita- tion.

It is precisely this near-total Western scientific prejudice — along with Heaviside's mutilation of Maxwell's original theory — that has excluded electrogravitation from being developed in the West. Note also that, by embracing a \"locally flat spacetime\" assumed to be decreed by the \"laws of the universe,\" in their rigid mindset Western physicists have excluded any possibility of performing simple laboratory experiments in locally curved spacetime. They do not believe it can be done, so they have never tried. But let us further address the importance of the negative triplet (electrical charge/energy/time) and its concomitants parity, gravity, and entropy: Engineering Antigravity In negative time flow, gravity is a repulsion, not an attraction. Producing antigravity in an object is simply the produc- tion of excess negative time flow in that object. That is readily achieved by curving local spacetime in the appropriate direction, and forcing the object to produce excess negative energy. Mass, for example, is just a special form of trapped energy—and trapped energy (potential) is just trapped charge of one kind or another, whether observable or virtual.* As such, mass represents a \"localized potential\" in the ambient vacuum, of a certain kind of \"trapped energy/time charge.\" *Actually, since it is in equilibrium in a dynamic and continual flux, a mass particle is actually a special trapped rate of action flow. A defining equation for mass in terms of the rate of action flow was given by the author in Quiton/Perccptron Physics, NTIS, 1973.

The mass is \"in equilibrium\" at its fixed potential. Normal (\"positive\") mass is simply charged up with positive energy and positive time. And its external electron shells result in it presenting a \"negative charge\" face to the world. If we charge up the mass, however, with negative energy and negative time, so that some of its charge potential now is of this second type, the trapped energy will now consist partially of negative energy. In addition, the mass will partially exist in negative time (be charged up partially with negative time). When excess negative time flow is produced in a mass, the mass begins to be repelled by the earth as well as still being attracted to it in its positive time stream. The net result of the object's fixed attraction and increasing repulsion is that the object begins to lose weight in the earth's gravitational field and gets lighter. When a sufficient rate of excess negative time flow (sufficient local spacetime curvature) is produced, the mass floats freely. With additional negative time production rate, it accelerates (\"falls\") upward. The rate of excess negative time produced may be controlled very simply by using a \"negative time/negative energy\" generator and varying the amount of the load applied to the device. The negative time/negative energy generator can be rigidly affixed to a flying apparatus, serving as a sort of gravitational rocket or gravitational propulsion system. Of course, the negative energy produced in the propulsion process can be used to light lamps and power electrical loads, as well as host of other things. (Yes, Virginia, it can also be used to generate force fields, power weapon systems, etc.) Thus one can \"eat his cake and have it too\"; by using negative energy flow for power, a very practical antigravity spaceship can be developed. An additional side benefit to the passengers probably exists: they should age at a slower rate when traveling in the vehicle. As can be seen, since many kinds of VPFs exist in vacuum, the vacuum is filled with (and consists of) many types of \"potentials.\" Overall, this matches very closely the view of general relativity, if we"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"159 Extraordinary Physics regard the vacuum itself as indefinite \"spacetime\", where no ordered universal frame with a fixed metric has yet been associated or prescribed. Curved Spacetime and the Disintegrated Vacuum From general relativity, additional characteristics of the mod- ern vacuum/spacetime may be inferred or interpreted. First, we may take a \"flat spacetime\" to consist of a charged vacuum, such that both the magnitude and structure of the VPF are essentially unchanged from point to point, and the flux of virtual particles and virtual antiparticles are balanced. Equal positive and negative time flows/charges exist. Note, however, that we can have what casually may appear to be a \"flat spacetime\" but instead is \"warped.\" This case exists when the magnitude of the overall VPF comprising the vacuum does not change from point to point, but the component structure of the VPF does vary from point to point. In other words, the overall vacuum potential remains the same from point to point, but two or more individual potentials may canonically vary. Let us further clarify this point by analogy. Suppose we view the vacuum/ether/spacetime as a special sort of gas, where the \"gas\" is actually a mixture of many, many gases. It is a rather peculiar sort of gas; it exists in five or more dimensions and is composed of very strange, fleeting particles which . spontaneously are created and destroyed, each arising out of no- where and returning to nowhere almost immediately. There is only minuscule (negligible) time overlap (integration) of the existence of these virtual particles in the main. That is, mostly each virtual particle — along with its associated energy, movement, momentum, charge, and increment of time — exists almost entirely as an individual. The energies, movements, momenta, charges, and time incre- ments of the individual virtual particles do not integrate or sum to any appreciable degree in vacuum. Thus, although casually this ether/gas may seem to contain enormous \"energy density\", momentum density, charge density and time increment density, these are not integrated energy density, momentum density, and time density in the normal sense."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 160 Instead, they are the densities of disintegrated energy, disinte- grated momentum, and disintegrated time flow. In scalar electromagnetics, we have called the disintegrated energy of vacuum anenergy. This clearly distinguishes that it exists in a fashion altogether different from normal, integrated energy with which we are accustomed. By integrating anenergy, of course, one obtains ordinary energy—but it first requires an integrating agent. The most usual integrating agent/operation is the spin of an observ- able particle of mass. Similar considerations apply to momentum and time. With this more precise interpretation, the vacuum con- tains enormous anenergy, but essentially no energy. It contains enormous virtual energy, but no observable energy. Unfortunately, however, orthodox physics does not yet clearly differentiate between the two states of energy, virtual and observ- able (disintegrated and integrated). Instead, it continues to loosely utilize the term \"energy\" for both states, whether integrated or not. Thus it exclusively uses the term \"energy density of vacuum.\" Rigorously, the term should be \"ane- nergy density of vacuum.\" Indeed, most physicists are not clearly aware of the distinct difference between the two different states of energy, insofar as the implication of integration or nonintegration. Regrettably, then, we will continue to utilize the orthodox term, \"energy density of vacuum.\" but the reader should be clearly aware that the vacuum \"energy\" and vacuum \"stress energy density\" as s uch are totally disintegrated. Separation of Vacuum and Observable States Because the energy density of vacuum is unintegrated, an integrated physical body — including one's personal body — can exist \"in\" the vacuum medium of incredible \"energy\" density, yet observably exist in a medium of zero energy density.

Note, however, that in our hyperdimensional interpretation of the levels of virtual state, the vacuum spatially does not exist in the normal 3-space of observable matter.* The vacuum occupies the 4th dimension (time) and all spatial dimensions (hyperdimensions) greater than the third — it occupies all levels of virtual state, but not observable state. It occupies all levels of disintegration, but not the levels of observable integration. Exchanges occur between normal 3-space and the hyperspatial vacuum, through the common connecting dimension, time. These exchanges (of virtual particles) are integrated by the spinning observable mass particle into the first quantally excited state — a delta (change) representing a single entrapped quantum — of the 5-space potential represented by the particle and its accumulating VPF. At that time a sharp electromagnetic (fifth dimensional) discharge of the quantum occurs, converting the accu- mulated 5-G quantum to the ordinary EM quantum of the 4th (time) and 5th (infolded space) dimensions. This accounts for the so-called \"collapse of the wave function\", the production of unitary quantum change, and the discretizing of observable change. We note in passing that time is the only \"dimension\" where everything can be considered to occupy the same \"point\" or \"inter- val\", but it is discretized and chopped into pieces (disintegrated), quite different in nature from the familiar three spatial dimensions of the observable (integrated) universe. The dimensional separation (spatially) of the seething vacuum \"energy\" (anenergy) and the 3-space of normal matter allows a physical body to enormously interact with the vacuum at or near equilibrium at the microscopic level, but maintain its macroscopic form and stability as if no interaction were going on.

In that fashion, one may conceivably obtain radiation energy at the expense of mass, or mass at the expense of radiation energy. Or one may convert between potentials where one or more of the converted potentials are as yet unknown to orthodox physics. Kaluza theory, for example, contains many potentials that are as yet unknown and undiscovered in nature. When undue simplifica- tions are made to arbitrarily exclude the unknown potentials, the adapted theory leads to error in its predictions. This was originally regarded as a great imperfection, and Kaluza theory fell into disfavor for decades. Then as modern particle physicists began to produce fundamental particles of an astounding variety, a Kaluza-Klein theory of 11 or more dimensions was found to very reasonably describe the emerging situation. Once again, then, Kaluza-Klein theory became a moving force among modern theorists. One may also convert electromagnetic field energy into gravita- tional field energy, for example, and obtain enormous amplification of gravitational effects. This is precisely what scalar electromagnetics seeks to do. Since the electrical field between two electrons is about 10 42 times as strong as the gravitational force between them, conversion of the EM charge flux into gravitational charge can conceivably yield up to 10 42 times as much gravitational force as normal, depending upon the efficiency of the conversion process. Even with a process or device that uses electron currents and has an efficiency of only 10 -22 , gravitational/inertial gains of 10 20 are possible. Note, however, that the levels of vacuum may also be compared to horizontal planes beneath the ocean. For example, we may take a particular level of vacuum potential, and that level constitutes a sort of included \"flat spacetime\" of its own. By biasing the potential of a scalar transmitter and receiver to a given level, one may transmit (in either direction) at that level only, Receivers at higher or lower levels will detect nothing."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 164 The immediate application to engineering the nucleus for such things as nonradioactive transmutation of elements, controlled nuclear fusion, electromagnetic healing, and processing nuclear wastes to render them harmless should be apparent. To recapitulate our analogy, a true \"flat spacetime\" is a vacuum whose VPF does not essentially vary overall or in each constituent part, between two comparative points. A \"curved spacetime\" is a vacuum whose overall VPF varies in overall magnitude, between two comparative points. A \"warped spacetime\" is a vacuum whose VPF may or may not vary in overall magnitude between two comparative points, but whose partial VPFs vary their ratios, between the same two points. Note that a vacuum/spacetime can be both warped and curved. It is stressed that we have not limited the number of dimensions that can be placed on the vacuum to Minkowski's four. We hold the number of dimensions necessary to represent both vacuum and observable matter to be arbitrary, but greater than four. To unify electromagnetism and gravitation (which is what scalar electromagnetics is about), we must take five dimensions — four spatial and one time — to be the minimum necessary in modeling the unified theory, similar to Kaluza. We state now a major characteristic: Vacuum/spacetime consists entirely of potentials, nothing else, and these are hyperspatial a priori. The vacuum does not contain observable force fields nor any Other non-potential entity. We also state without proof that in scalar EM theory it seems very possible to model the mind and its unification with physical reality, in a fashion subject to experimental verification. Force and Mass Are Inextricably Intertwined In foundations of physics, it is well-known that, paradoxically, force and mass can only be defined one in terms of the other. We may use that paradox for a new interpretation of force and force fields: a force may be interpreted to consist of the time rate of changing the \"mv\" momentum of a mass system or object, instead of being the cause of its dp/dt."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"165 Extraordinary Physics That is, we may take the view that (4-14) not just that (4-15) We have previously pointed this out and called it the \"strong definition of force.\" This immediately suggests the question: If force is an effect and not a cause, what, then, causes force? Quantum mechanics already provides the answer: A differenti- ating operator must be applied to (coupled to) potential in order to produce a force field. The most usual \"differentiating operator\" is an observable spinning charged particle. A charged particle exposed to the variation of electrostatic scalar potential between two points is exposed to a gradient (flow) in the virtual photon VPF, and hence to a directional \"stream\" of virtual photons. The observable charged particle couples to that stream. Its spin integrates the unobservable, disintegrated anenergy of the gradient flux into integrated, observable energy of the particle. With greater integrated \"pressure\" on one side of the particle than on the other, the observable particle accelerates and translates This produces or \"detects\" (and comprises) an electric force between the two points. Force is the mass particle(s) accelerating, either in time or in mass. Observable force is observable particle(s) accelerating. Vir- tual force is virtual particle(s) accelerating. In Quiton/Perceptron Physics, I gave a new definition of mass that is consistent with this viewpoint: 1 kg. mass = 17.053 x 10 50 switches/sec (4-16) where a switch is h/4*pi), having the units of action/time, or energy. This directly defines mass in terms of energy accumulation, where"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 166 the energy accumulated is in equilibrium in a differentiated action flow. Note that \"energy\" is the time rate of flow of action. Energy can only be accumulated (as a mass or a potential) by possessing two rates of flow of action simultaneously, one in positive time and one in negative time. This is a very deep statement that affects all of physics, but unfortunately it is beyond the scope of this present book. To return: The observable electric force field does not exist as such in vacuum. The vacuum and all its constituents are totally virtual. Only the potential (\"potential for the electric force field, given a coupled charged observable particle\") exists in vacuum, as pointed out by Richard P. Feynman et al, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass., 1964 vol. 2, p. 2. The Concepts of Zipped and Unzipped Forces As noted previously, the potential exists as an unintegrated virtual particle flux (VPF). Further, each little moving virtual particle is smeared in length and time, is coupled to finer VPF, and thus may be said to constitute a minute \"force vector\" while it exists. Thus, the electrostatic scalar potential is composed of a myriad of little individual \"virtual particle force field\" vectors. Since these little virtual vectors are essentially separate and unintegrated, one may say that the electric field is unzipped in vacuum. By \"unzipped\" we mean that the individual virtual particle E-field vectors are unintegrated. A potential, for example, is composed of unzipped vector fields since it is comprised of unintegrated, virtual vectors. To be static, the potential must be comprised of a pair (at least one pair) of unzipped vector fields, one in positive time and one in negative time. These unzipped vector fields must in turn be locked together. In this case, the positive time observer sees nothing (vacuum only), until he \"observes\" or detects. Normal detectors detect (and in so doing, they zip together) only the positive time unzipped component. The negative time (phase conjugate) vector held retraces the positive time field, in Newton's third law. Or, if generating a wave or pulse, it would be seen as a phase conjugate"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"167 Extraordinary Physics replica which affected the disturbing source. Let us be very plain. A \"scalar EM potential\" is actually two vector fields zipped together: one is in positive time, and the other is in negative time. Each half is composed of microvectors. A dynamic gradient in this scalar EM potential (i.e., a scalar wave, for example) actually consists of two waves: one is the normal\" positive energy/positive time\" EM wave, while the other is the phase conjugate replica. When we detect the normal half (with electron detectors), we actually detect the second half with the atomic nuclei. Since it is a phase conjugate, it produces a negative momentum change on the nucleus {since one has p/(-t)} instead of LeSage's positive momentum change. In other words, it produces a drawing (attracting) force on the absorbing nucleus, instead of LeSage's assumed repelling force on it. That is the entire secret of gravitation. And of electro- gravitation. Knowing that, you can easily work out how to apply the necessary engineering to get antigravity. But to return. The potential can also be comprised of many unzipped vector fields at once. These may be deterministic (artificial potential) or randomized (natural potential). The \"force field\" is disintegrated (unzipped) in vacuum, and integrated (zipped) on, of, and by an observable charged particle. In vacuum, it is always accompanied by its phase conjugate twin. When detection by an observable particle occurs, the spin of the particle acts as the \"zipper,\" producing an observable force (which is actually of the particle accelerating, not \"acting independently upon it.\") Vacuum is unzipped; observable mass is zipped. Any zipped entity exists observably in 3-space; any un- zipped entity exists in hyperspace outside 3-space, and is unobservable and virtual to the 3-space observer. This interpretation is still consistent with the extended quan- tum mechanical view, where ultimately all observable forces are considered to be generated by absorption and emission of virtual particles by/from an observable particle (mass), at least insofar as what we may observably measure or detect."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 168 Force, Force Field, and EM Waves in Vacuum In the new interpretation, consistent with the quantum me- chanical view, observable force becomes an effect, not a cause. One may interpret quantum mechanics as stating that any observable is an effect, since it is assumed to have a virtual state cause. In the axioms of quantum mechanics, an operator is required for every observable. The primary causative agents are potentials, not force fields, as is now firmly established in quantum mechanics. The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is a striking illustration of the primary reality of the potential rather than of the force field. In the AB effect, potentials may still exist when the force fields are zero, and their interference can still cause real effects. The AB effect has finally become generally accepted by physicists after nearly three decades of controversy. The immediate result is that, contrary to the outdated view imbedded in classical EM, observable E and B force fields do not exist as such in vacuum. This allows a totally new interpretation of the nature of the EM wave in vacuum: It is longitudinal. And actually, it exists in longitudinal pairs: the second is the phase conjugate of the first. But of course we detect transverse waves with our detectors! However, this has a simple explanation. Examine, for example, a straight-wire antenna. The spinning conduction electrons are longitudinally constrained, as is well known. The electrons are relatively unrestrained transversely in the wire, but can only \"drift\" longitudinally down the wire with a speed usually on the order of centimeters per second. The signal potential, however, moves longitudinally down the wire at almost the speed of light. Obviously it is not the longitudinal movement of conduction electrons that constitutes the \"signal\", even though classical electro- magnetics represents it that way.* We note that a spinning electron whose movement is longitudi- *Actually, we do not really know how current/electrons travel down a wire, or even if it does/ they do.

Further, the axis of this gyroscope may be taken as lying in a plane perpendicular to the straight wire conduc- tion path, since the electron is relatively unrestrained transversely. If now disturbed by a vacuum potential gradient, the gyroscopic electron is free to precess at right angles to the length of the wire. In other words, given a disturbing force, the electron will move trans- versely, or radially in the cross sectional plane of the wire, because of gyroscopic precession. Thus, assuming a gyroscopic electron and its longitudinal con- straint, we will detect transverse oscillations in the electron gas in the wire, IF AND ONLY IF the incoming disturbance in the vacuum is longitudinal, and IF AND ONLY IF the unzipped vacuum distur- bance \"couples\" to (is zipped by) the gyroscopic conduction electrons. Two things are certain in our electron-detector model: First, by the nature of a gyroscope, the conduction electrons move (precess) at right angles to the \"disturbing force.\" Second, we only detect the movement of the electrons themselves. Since we do detect transverse oscillations of the precessing electrons in the straight wire antenna, then it follows that normal electromagnetic waves in vacuum—that is, the component half that, interacts with the atom's electron shells and not with its nucleus — are (1) longitudinal, and (2) of such form that they couple to electrons. Note that Tesla always insisted that electromagnetic waves in vacuum were longitudinal. For example, he called them \"electro- magnetic sound waves\" in the ether. In \"Tesla Maps Our Electrical Future,\" H. Winfield Secor presents Tesla's view of transverse waves in this fashion: \"Tesla upholds the startling theory formulated by him long ago, that the radio transmitters as now used, do not emit Hertz waves, as commonly believed, but waves of sound... He says that a Hertz wave would only be possible in a solid ether, but he has demonstrated already in 1897 that the ether is a gas, which can only transmit waves of sound; that is such as are propagated by alternate compressions and rarefactions of the medium in which transverse waves are absolutely impossible.\""},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics no In his \"The True Wireless,\" Electrical Experimenter, May 1919, Tesla himself further stated: \"The Hertz wave theory of wireless transmission may be kept up for a while, but I do not hesitate to say that in a short time it will be recognized as one of the most remarkable and inexplicable aberra- tions of the scientific mind which has ever been recorded in history.\" It should also be pointed out that our analogy permits the option of making a longitudinal wave in the vacuum in such a fashion that It will not couple to electrons. In that case a normal\"electron gas\" conduction detector will not detect the new wave. Such a noncoupling EM longitudinal wave is referred to as a scalar electromagnetic wave, where by use of the term \"scalar\" we call attention to the fact that the vacuum potential is varying, but electron coupling to form vector force fields in an electron gas does not occur. Since according to general relativity the variation of a potential in vacuum rigorously is a gravitational wave, then the scalar EM wave is a gravitational wave.* We often say it is an electrogravitational wave to call attention to its electromagnetic origin, and to the absence of EM force field \"bleeding away\" of the 5-space Kaluza-Klein gravitational potential. We will discuss the 5-space G-potential shortly. The conventional equation (4-17) thus applies in the detecting electron gas, but not in the vacuum. Instead, in the nonmaterial vacuum, rigorously (4-18) and this states that a gradient in a vacuum electrostatic scalar *It is also a very powerful gravitational wave, since for electrons it is some 10 42 times as strong as \"mass attraction\" gravity waves."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"171 Extraordinary Physics potential produces an antiphased electric force on and of a particle, on condition that a particle is present. The intent of equation (4-17) should be stated as (4-19) where the vertical line means \"on condition that\", and cp means \"charged particle\" (i.e., \"that a charged particle is there.). Equation (4-19) clearly shows that, in the vacuum, only the organized potential for an E field exists due to the quantity essentially as pointed out less strongly by Feynman et al in The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Certainly, in the quantum mechanical interpretation, it is the potential that is real. The force field can only be made from the potential by a differentiating operation. Since there is nothing in vacuum to perform this differentiating operation observably, one may interpret quantum mechanics as already prohibiting the existence of observable electromagnetic force fields in vacuum, at least in the form prescribed in classical electromagnetics.

A force-field vector is a movement of mass in one direction."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 172 One may regard quantum mechanics — and physics in general - to be incomplete until electromagnetic theory is changed to incorporate the implications of quantum mechanics. In scalar electromagnetics a new interpretation is taken, and the \"overhaul\" of electromagnetic theory is in progress. We accent that scalar electromagnetics is still embryonic. It is at a stage similar to that where electromagnetism was when experi- menters were still rubbing glass rods with cat fur and experimenting with little charged pith balls. Early experiments are enlightening and encouraging; nonethe- less, the phenomenology and the myriad of variables are not at all well-understood, even by the experimenters themselves, and cer- tainly not by this author. Zero-Summed Vector Systems: Shortcoming in Vector Analysis It has long been pointed out by this author that a fundamental shortcoming exists in classical vector analysis itself when applied to physical systems. Let us briefly look at the construction of the vector mathematics theory, to clarify this shortcoming. First, an abstract entity called a \"vector\" is conceptualized. This vector has both direction and magnizude, as contrasted to a \"scalar\" quantity, which only has magnitude. Next, an abstract \"vector space\" is defined; this is a sort of \"container\" for mathematical objects called vectors, with certain inherent properties of the system specified. In other words, a vector space is an abstract \"system\" or \"space\" which can contain objects called \"vectors.\" Next certain other properties, operations, and entities are de- fined, one of which is the is the \"zero vector\". Essentially the zero vector is defined by a set of operations; however, one simplified interpretation is \"the absence of any vector of finite magnitude.\" By implication, in the abstract vector theory, all zero-vectors are defined to be identical.* * Because, by their nature assumed in the concept, they have no internal structures. That is, effectively the zero vector has been too restrictively defined as \"the absence of any and all fin ite vectors.\" It should be redefined as \"the absence of any single vector being present al one.\" In that case the definition would admit \"the presence of multiple translation vectors, where their combined translation action is zero.\""},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"173 Extraordinary Physics In the vector addition operation, a group of finite vectors adds to a single vector called the \"resultant.\" It is standard practice in abstract vector analysis to replace a system of summation vectors by their resultant, since all appropri- ate properties of the summation system are retained by the vector resultant, in the abstract mathematical model. This, however, is only possible because the abstract vector space has no such thing as stress, and a zero-vector has no substructure by definition. In the abstract space, only translation and rotation are possible, by assumption It is also possible for two or more finite vectors to add to a zero resultant, in which case the system is replaced with a zero vector. Note that all further action by the summing vector components is eliminated by this assumption. Again the appropriate properties of the summation system are retained by the zero resultant, in the abstract mathematical model, only because the medium (the abstract vector space) is not subject to stress, translation, rotation, and structuring. Note however, that in physical systems, one cannot simply Figure 62.

The physical medium - including the virtual flux of the vacuum, is subject to stress, translation, rotation and structuring. Physically, the presence of the summing vector component forces creates a stress and a dynamic macroscopic structure in the physical medium in and on which the forces are acting. Therefore the stress of the medium and its structure must be preserved and accounted for, even though a zero vector resultant force exists. This is particularly true in the vacuum, where internal (in- folded) stresses cause charge and energy conversion between one kind of charge/potential and another. Maxwell's Theory Was Altered and Curtailed In fact, Maxwell seems to have been well aware of the electro- magnetic stress of the ether and its importance. After all, he believed the ether to be material and mechanical, and developed his theory accordingly. For example, in his Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, he wrote: \"There are physical quantities of another kind which are related to directions in space, but which are not vectors. Stresses and strains in solid bodies are examples of these, and so are some of the properties of bodies considered in the theory of elasticity and in the theory of double refraction. Quantities of this class require for their definition nine numerical specifications. They are expressed in the language of quaternions by linear and vector functions of a vector.\" Maxwell worked out his theory in quaternions since, at the time, the modern form of vector analysis had not been originated by Heaviside and Gibbs. To recapitulate what we stated earlier: A quaternion consists of a vector part and a scalar part and can readily take into account the stress and strain of the medium. A vector consists only of the vector part, and does not take into account the stress of the medium. It seems certain that Maxwell knew that the scalar part of the"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"175 Extraordinary Physics quaternion could be present and vary, even though the vector part was sum-zeroed. Quaternions, however, are devilishly difficult, and even in the time of their founder, Hamilton, few mathematicians and scientists ever mastered them.

In the remodeling, the \"unified\" basis was omitted, and electro- Table 37.

Heaviside wrote a severely limited subset of Maxwell's theory; he did not by any means capture all of it.* The new Heaviside vector reinterpretation of EM was far easier to calculate in than Maxwell's quaternions. Many physicists (there were really very few scientists in those days!) immediately loved it. FitzGerald wrote glowingly of Heaviside's translation (and mutilation!) of Maxwell's theory: \"Since Oliver Heaviside has written, the whole subject of electro- magnetism has been remodelled by his work. No future introduction to the subject will be at all final that does not attack the problem from at least a somewhat similar standpoint to the one he puts forward.\" Thus it was that Heaviside discarded the basis for scalar electro- magnetics and electrogravitation from Maxwell's original work, and the so-called \"classical Maxwell Equations\" appeared for the first time in their modern vector form in Heaviside's work. Then in the early 1890's a short but vigorous debate on vectors and vectorial methods occurred, involving eight journals, twelve leading publications, and over 30 scientists. Over half the publica- tions were in the leading British scientific weekly journal Nature. This debate, which Lord Rayleigh characterized by the state- ment \"Behold how these vectorists love one another,\" together with the far greater difficulty of quaternion methods as compared to Gibbs' and Heaviside's vector analysis, spelled the death knell to the position of quaternions. After some years, the Gibbs-Heaviside vector theory was firmly entrenched. The quaternion theory of Maxwell was forever modified and limited to the form we know today as \"Maxwell's equations.\" What really happened was that electrical physicists, faced with the formidable difficulties of quaternions, simply stampeded down the far easier road blazed by Heaviside, bowling over all protests against Heaviside/Maxwell/Hertz theory. *Specifically, Heaviside wrote the subset of Maxwell's theory where gravity and electromag- netism do not interact and are mutually exclusive."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics In Western universities today, no one actually teaches Maxwell's true theory! Instead, Heaviside's curtailed reinterpreta- tion —- a severely restricted subset of Maxwell's theory — is taught. And so that is the EM theory that is learned and applied. One may rightly argue, therefore, that Maxwell's theory has only been partially applied in its modern translated form, and the modern form of the Maxwell/Hertz electromagnetic theory is very much incomplete. To recover the stress factor in Maxwell's original theory, electro- magnetics must take into account the artificial potential, which has a deliberately ordered, dynamic, deterministic structure. Scalar electromagnetics takes the patterned stress into account and delib- erately uses it. Normal electromagnetics only considers the natural potential with randomized VPF structure implicitly assumed. Scalar Waves and Polarization of the Vacuum Let us use a simple analogy. This will lead us into the profound implications of the deliberate vacuum polarization and curving of local spacetime that is provided by the vector zero summation (artificial EM potential) method of scalar electromagnetics.* Visualize two sets of opposing and balanced forces pressing on the sides of a plate. The forces sum to zero, so the resultant force acting on the plate for translation is zero. Hence the plate does not translate (move away or accelerate). However, the plate is under internal stress (compression), and is in a quite different condition than when it has no external forces at all acting on it. Now visualize the forces being applied with rigid rods welded to the sides of the plate, so that the forces may alternately \"pull\" as well as \"push.\" Let the forces rhythmically vary, alternately \"pulling\" and \"pushing\", but always remaining balanced so that their summa- tion for a translation resultant is constantly a zero vector. The plate never accelerates or moves in translation, but it now contains an internal stress wave which rhythmically varies between compression and tensile stress. Rigorously the plate internally *Vector multiplications that yield a zero vector product are also highly significant. 177"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 178 possesses a scalar stress wave, or a wave of \"internal stress in the medium.\" Now visualize a similar \"plate-like\" region of vacuum, with its virtual particle flux, instead of the material plate. Visualize two opposing sets of (unzipped) EM force fields, acting in and on the plate-like region, so that they rhythmically increase and decrease, changing direction also, but always with a zero vector summation. In this case, there is an unzipped zero resultant EM force field (it is zero, by our assumed conditions), but there is a rhythmic oscillation of the intensity of the vacuum flux (intensity of the vacuum potential) and the vacuum structuring in the region. That is, there is a rhythmic and steady oscillation of the stress energy and structuring of vacuum, and hence of the curvature of spacetime, in the plate-like region. Rigorously, this oscillation — which we call a scalar electro- magnetic wave—is a gravitational wave, since the local curvature of spacetime is being oscillated. Further, it differs from a \"natural\" gravitational wave in several respects: 1. It has a deterministic pattern or substructure, 2. It patterns or \"polarizes\" the vacuum, 3. It constitutes local curvature of spacetime, and hence localized general relativity - something which ordinary general relativ- ity assumes cannot be accomplished, 4. It deterministically engineers the virtual state and local spacetime, 5. Since it is achieved by converting EM field energy into artifi- cial G-field energy, one can expect tremendous gains of gravi- tational and inertial effects in and around electrical circuits utilizing such fields precisely, 6. It affects the Schroedinger wave and the probabilities of the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"179 Extraordinary Physics states being propagated forward by the Schroedinger wave. With the scalar EM wave, one can thus deterministi- cally engineer the emergence of quantum change, and violate one of the fundamental assumptions of quan- tum mechanics, that of the totally statistical nature of quantum change, 7. The scalar wave can accomplish direct and localized change of the rate of flow of time (even to its reversal) and variation of mass and inertia, without concomitant translation of matter, 8. By locally curving and patterning vacuum spacetime, a stabi- lized standing scalar EM wave can provide macroscopic viola- tion of the conservation laws, which rigorously depend upon a locally flat spacetime (Lorentz frame), 9. Since the components in the zero summation may be EM waves, and may be \"locked together\" and broadcast to a great distance and interfered there, effects at great macroscopic distances may be achieved, in violation of present assumptions of physics, and 10. Since excess negative time flow may be locally produced, anti- gravity, negative energy, and negentropy may be locally pro- duced. These are the startling implications inherent in correcting classical electromagnetics' improper treatment of zero-summed EM force vector systems in vacuum.* By classically replacing the force vectors in a zero EM force field summation with a zero vector and discarding the components, one is totally discarding the fact that such a patterned system of oppositive forces forms a deterministically patterned stress in the vacuum medium.

Generations of Western physicists and electrical engineers have acquired a mindset in only one aspect of the vastly expanded electromagnetics actually available. Vector Zero Systems and the Kaluza-Klein Approach Prior to 1921, Theodor Kaluza applied Einstein's new general relativity to five dimensions. He produced a unified theory of electromagnetism and gravita- tion. In Kaluza's theory, the ordinary 4-dimensional gravitational field and the electromagnetic field are but two different aspects of a single more fundamental field: the 5-dimensional gravitational field. Kaluza's theory was published in 1921, on the personal recom- mendation of Albert Einstein, who had had Kaluza's paper for two years. In Kaluza's model, electromagnetics is the 5th dimensional aspect of the 5-d G-field, while the ordinary 4-d G-field is the intersection of the 5-d G-field with our ordinary world. Five years after Kaluza's epochal paper, Oskar Klein explained where the extra space dimension — the fifth dimension — was. He modified it as \"wrapped around\" each point in our ordinary 3-space. In the Kaluza-Klein model, then, an electromagnetic wave — which moves spatially only in the fifth dimension — does not move through our 3-space at all. Instead, on its trajectory it \"flows around\" each point in our 3-space along its path. Using Kaluza's model, we may regard the EM field as the normal \"bleed-off' or escape of the 5-dimensional gravitational potential in the 5th dimension. Any gradient in a potential represents a bleed-off of the potential from the high point to the low point. The way to prevent effective bleed-off of a potential at a point is to add an equal amount of bleed- in! The bleed-out and the bleed-in at the point then become balanced, so that an equilibrium state exists in the potential. By this mean, the magnitude of the potential can be fixed by the two opposing bleed processes in equilibrium."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"181 Extraordinary Physics Table 38.

Usually, very little bleed-off of the 5-potential occurs in our normal 3-space. When the 5-space G-field is bled off on electrons, e.g., the resulting 5th dimensional E-field bleed-off is on the order of 10 42 times as much as the 3-space G-field bleed-off. This accounts for the enormous magnitude of the ratio of the electrical force between two electrons to the gravitational force between them. Even when the 5-space G-potential is bled-off on and against the greater inertia of much more massive protons, its 5th dimensional E- field bleed-off is still on the order of 10 36 or so times as much as the 3-space bleed-off. Note that if we can stop the acceleration of the charged particles, bleed-off of the 5-space G-potential as EM force field cannot occur, and instead all of it must bleed-off as 3-space G-force field. This 3-G bleed-off normally occurs only minimally in electromagnetics, even for so-called \"static\" charges. This can be seen as follows: When one charges a conductor such as a large metal sphere, for example, the electrons are unconstrained on the surface of the sphere. They are in constant agitation and motion on the surface, thus constantly bleeding-off the 5-space potential as myriads of squirming little E-fields. Only a very little is bled off as 3-dimen- sional G-field. On the other hand, when one charges a dielectric, the electrons cannot be in as much agitation movement as they are on a conducting surface. Hence slightly more of the 5-dimensional G-potential is bled off as 3-dimensional G-field. Therefore, charged conductors and charged dielectrics should exhibit slightly different gravitational and inertial properties when exposed to a gravity field potential difference. Highly charged capacitors, for example, should exhibit a small but detectable unidi- rectional thrust in vacuum. Apparently they do, as exhibited by the Biefield-Brown effect. In addition, different materials should exhibit slightly different fall rates gravitationally. Again there is some evidence that they do, 185"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics as exhibited by the Eotvos experiments in a modern reinterpretation by Fischbach et al.* Electrogravitation Amplification Factor If the movement of two free electrons could be entirely stopped, all EM bleed-off of the 5-d G-potential between them would be effectively zeroed or blocked. Then the 5-d G-potential would be forced to totally bleed-off into ordinary 3-d G-field. For two electrons, this could increase the gravitational force between them by a factor of 10 42 , if the EM bleed were perfectly blocked. Such perfect blockage of the 5th dimensional EM bleedoff cannot be accomplished in practice. Normally, with the increase in potential caused by zero-summing, agitating electrons in a statically charged object agitate more intensely, moving and squirming in local, erratic constraints. However, conversion efficiencies on the order of 10 10 or even 10 20 appear to be achievable in ordinary circuitry. In that case, gravito-inertial amplification gains of up to 10 22 or even 10 32 appear to be achievable. Gains of 10 10 or more appear to be fairly readily achievable. Time delay in producing the gravito-inertial effects may be experienced, however, because mass (nuclei) acts as a capacitance to incident scalar waves, exhibiting capacitive charging and discharg- ing \"time constants\" when charging scalarly for a particular effect or to a particular pattern. In these achievable amplification ranges, a single milliwatt of electrical power can control enormously powerful local gravitational and inertial effects, once the scalar EM charge is built up in the nuclei of the target material. Excessive and frustrating \"fiddling time\" with the circuits is usually required, however, due to the charging \"time constant\" effect, the general lack of adequate measuring instruments, and the great uncertainty as to the phenomenology and major variables involved.** *Ephraim Fischback et al, \"Reanalysis of the Eotvos experiment,\" Phy.

By beaming and wave interference, effects at a distance can be achieved. When gravito-inertial amplification of many orders of magni- tude are involved, the assumption in ordinary general relativity of a local Lorentz frame (local special relativity, with local conservation laws applying) is readily violated. Now one may have local general relativity, with concomitant violation of conservation laws, and local broken symmetry on a macroscopic scale. Soviet papers already strongly point out that such unrestricted general relativity allows the violation of all conservation laws. In the Soviet Union, scalar electromagnetics is called energetics. Comparison of EM Concepts Table 41 shows a comparison between three concepts of electro- magnetics: classical, quantum mechanical, and scalar electromag- netic views. As can be seen, scalar EM re-introduces Maxwell's original potential for electrogravitational variation and structuring of the stress energy density of vacuum spacetime. It applies Kaluza-Klein 5-dimensional unified theory in an engineering fashion. It deliberately utilizes phase conjugation as a tool to achieve startling negative time/negative energy capabilities and results, including \"free\" energy and antigravity. With scalar EM, it should be possible to overcome or circumvent most of the severely limiting assumptions of present physics and engineering.

Aharonov and Bohm showed that, even in the absence of the EM force fields, the potentials may still exist and interfere to produce real effects in physical systems. They suggested experiments to prove these predictions. Interference of the potentials is the key mechanism producing real effects in charged particle systems, even in the presence of zero E-field and zero B-field. Unfortunately, Aharonov and Bohm did not address this issue of zero-summed systems of EM force fields as one way of producing artificial potentials having unique interference characteristics. That is, by implication they did not consider the deterministi- cally substructured \"artificial\" potential, but only the randomly structured \"natural\" potential. At any rate the \"AB effect,\" as it came to be called, was rather hotly debated and fiercely resisted over the years. Steadily, more and more experiments were added, validating the AB effect.

Further, it can directly act on charged particle systems, even when classical electromagnetics does not recognize the in- teraction. Curl-Free Magnetic Vector Potential (A-Field) As an example, in classical EM the vector magnetic potential (the A-field) had been defined as a mathematical convenience by the equation (4-20) But if the potentials are real, then conceivably the A field can be loosed from its enchainment to the operator.

For instance, its defining equation shows that magnetic force field can be made from it, and the rightmost term of the equation (4-21) shows that its time rate of change makes an electrical field. Let us explain this in simpler terms, and somewhat more precisely than conventional theory. We will use the Kaluza unified G-EM interpretation and electron flow in our explanation. In the A-field, we have a certain kind of 5-dimensional G- potential which can bleed-off as EM force fields in two ways: (1) in a swirl fashion, where the vortex producing the swirl moves parallel to electron movement, and the swirling is a torque or spin, and (2) in a linear fashion, where the time rate of change of the A-potential produces a linear E-field on the electrons. The first bleed-off as given by equation (4-20) constitutes the magnetic B-field, and the second bleed-off as given by the rightmost term of equation (4-21) creates a component of the overall electrical E-field. Bleed off of the electrostatic scalar potential produces the other component of the E-field. Now in general relativity (GR) theory, \"the\" G-potential is just a conglomerate of many things, each of which has the characteristic of curving spacetime. \"The\" gravitational field is not a single thing at all, but is composed of a collection of many things. Thus if we realize that both the electrostatic scalar potential field) and the magnetic vector potential (A-field) are components of the 5-d G-potential, then we see immediately that bleed-off of these two components of the 5-d G-potential creates all normal EM fields. It follows that, if we produce a zero-vector summation of the two or more EM bleed-offs, we are actually \"putting as much back in\" to the 5-d G-potential through its A and components as we are taking out electromagnetically. In that case, the 5-potential is in a state of equilibrium with respect to EM bleed-off in the fifth dimension. It is now forced to bleed-off in the only other way it can: as ordinary 3-dimensional"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 192 gravitational field. Thus by vector-zeroing EM force fields, we turn KM field energy into G-field energy and vice versa, via the interme- diary of the 5-potential. At any rate, soon after publication of the Aharonov-Bohm paper, experiments showed that, if the magnetic field is trapped inside a long solenoid, a phase shift still is induced in the two-slit electron experiment, even though — classically — no contact of the enclosed magnetic field and the moving electrons occurs. This phase shift is explained by the fact that the freed A-field exists outside the trapping solenoid, even though the B-field does not. Consequently, interaction of this curl-free A-field with the electrons produces a phase shift of the QM interference detection pattern. This proves that curl-free A-field is real and causes physical effects. It also proves that a form of \"action at a distance\" is real, just as required by quantum mechanics. Years ago, Frank Golden and this author — together with Dr. William Tiller — experimented with \"free A-field\" devices. Golden went on to develop prototype transmitters and receivers and a prototype underwater communication system. Since that time, Gelinas has patented several curl-free magnetic vector potential (free A-field) devices. See U. S. patents numbers 4, 447,779, May 8,1984; 4,429,288, Jan. 31,1984; 4,429,280, Jan. 31,1984; and 4, 432, 098, Feb. 14,1984. These patents are assigned to Honeywell. Fractional Charges, Magnetic Monopoles, and Magnetic Currents Fifteen years ago, a most distinguished gathering of physicists occurred in Trieste, Italy to review the physicist's conception of nature and how it developed. Seven Nobel Laureates were in the prestigious audience. The keynote address, appropriately, was given by P. A.M. Dirac, and — appropriately — was entitled \"Development of the Physicist's Conception of Nature.\" Dirac called attention to the possibility of fractional charges, and unexpectedly presented some of the data from experiments done lung before by Felix Ehrenhaft. Years earlier Felix Ehrenhaft, former director of the Physical"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics Institute at the University of Vienna, had reported a number of experiments where — purportedly — he easily obtained fractional electrical charges. Whereas Millikan had used liquid oil drops in his experiments to determine the charge of the electron, Ehrenhaft used little solid, red selenium oxide spheres. Not only could Ehrenhaft get a frac- tional charge, but he could actually vary the size of the fraction by varying the size of the spheres. (Knowing what has been discovered in the last two decades on the complex bond structuring of water and liquid hydrocarbons, one might very well suspect that a solid — which has one less degree of freedom than a liquid — could possibly yield a very different experimental condition from a liquid, from first principles. However, no one seems to have noted that, or taken it into account.) (Also, Ehrenhaft's results were replicated by other researchers who used his experimental methods. They published scientific papers, but that made not a whit to the scientific community, which simply rejected the experimental evidence.). Dirac pointed out that Millikan himself, in his oil drop experi- ments that established the charge of the electron, reported one anomalous experiment which yielded a fractional charge. He dis- carded the results of that experiment. Ending his speech, Dirac stated that it all made him wonder if perhaps Millikan did have a fractional charge in that one experimiment after all. And well he might wonder. Ehrenhaft — almost unknown now to the present generation of physicists — may have found not only fractional electrical charges, but the magic magnetic monopoles as well. Over and over, Ehrenhaft reported the results of experiments which disagreed with the notions of magnetic theory at the time. Again, some of these experiments were replicated, and reported by those researchers replicating them. It didn't make any difference at all. Now, finding a magnetic monopole — and the accompanying magnetic charge current — would be most satisfying to many theorists. That would make the equations of magnetics quite \"bal- anced\" with respect to electricity. However, no one —at least whose results have been accepted - 193"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 194 has yet found a magnetic monopole or magnetic current. Stanford researchers have perhaps come closest, and even re- ported the results of one exciting experiment that found the mag- netic monopole. However, the team has consistently failed to be able to replicate those results. And in science, \"no replication, no accep- tance\" is necessarily the dictum. In a moment we will address a possible cause for this failure to find the magnetic monopole and magnetic charge current. Some Ehrenhaft Experiments Let's look at some simple, rather informal experiments that Ehrenhaft showed. We call attention to Alden P. Armagnac's excel- lent article , \"Magic with magnetism,\" in Popular Science Maga- zine, June 1944, p. 130-133, 222, 226. In the first experiment, Ehrenhaft seems to have dissociated water with a permanent magnet. First, Ehrenhaft seals two rods of pure iron, in holes through opposite sides of the U in a U-shaped glass tube filled with water. Then he uses the two rods — which protrude through the tube into the water — as the pole pieces of a horseshoe magnet — either an electromagnet or a permanent magnet. Dilute sulfuric acid — one percent by volume — is in the water, to give it a very slight acidity. Bubbles of gas rise up through the twin vertical columns of water, and are collected and analyzed. Most of the gas is hydrogen, as is to be expected from common chemical interaction of the iron rods with the very dilute sulfuric acid. However, some of the gas — ranging from two to twelve percent — is oxygen, and most of the oxygen is produced at the north pole of the magnet. The pole pieces may be short-circuited with wire, to insure they are at the same electrical potential and prevent any electrical dissociation of the water. Without the magnet, all the gas liberated is hydrogen, as is to be expected. No oxygen at all is produced. And another very interesting phenomenon occurs. A strong permanent magnet of the Alnico type gradually loses a marked fraction of its strength — say, 10% in 24 hours. It appears that the energy dissociates water — very similar to electrical energy from a ba ttery draining away when electric current is used to dissociate"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"195 Extraordinary Physics water. The real question is: Is this experiment a demonstration of magnetic current? If it is, then the textbooks are wrong, and there's another constituency in magnetism that has not been taken into account. Further, if it proves magnetic current exists, it has also proven magnetic charge — the magnetic monopole — exists. If it is not a demonstration of magnetic current, then what is it? Why don't you get any oxygen liberated when the magnetism is removed? What causes the magnet to discharge its magnetic strength? These serious questions do not appear to have ever been re- solved. In all fairness, however, we must warn the reader that other factors in the water can very seriously affect the outcome of this EARTH • SUN - MOON TRIAD Figure 69.

The phase-conjugate energy (negative energy, negative time) streams affect all \"subtle-energy\" earth experiments"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 196 experiment. As we now know, the bonding structure of water is incredibly adaptive. Every bit of water you examine, for example, is absolutely unique in many respects. And in other respects, it's a sort of \"single giant molecule.\" Be forewarned also that subtle experiments with water are affected by just about everything under the sun. Including the sun! Ehrenhaft himself was quite embarrassed when this \"decompo- sition of water\" failed to be 100% repeatable. It can be done — but you may have to work at it a bit. The best water for this experiment is the most natural, pure ground water you can obtain. At any rate, it may be that these experiments of Ehrenhaft's are related to the old notion of \"watergas\" — the changing of water in some fashion so that, as it enters an internal combustion chamber, it decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen, and is ignited by the spark and burns as a fuel. In the typical watergas case, the experimenter has a \"green powder\" which, when added to water, will allow it to be burned as a fuel when it is used in an ordinary engine. Such a capability, for example, seems to have been exhibited at least once, to the U.S. Navy, by an unorthodox experimenter named Anderson. Of course, if fractional charges exist and can be controlled (and Ehrenhaft's experiments certainly seem to confirm this), then it is conceivable that a material could be found that would do the \"green powder\" function. That is, if the bonding electron that bonds hydro- gen and oxygen in water were replaced by a fractional charge, the \"fractionated water molecule\" could just barely be holding together an a liquid. A strong hydroshock — such as going through the jet nozzles in a carburetor — could then cause many of these molecules to break apart, effectively dissociating the water. A possibly related phenomenon was reported by Le Bon in his Evolution of Matter. The experiment was to hold a piece of ordinary aluminum under the surface of mercury in a container for a period of time. Then the piece of aluminum is taken out and thrown into a container of water, where it violently dissociates the water. At least one colleague was able to replicate this experiment by holding the aluminum beneath the mercury for 36 hours. These Ehrenhaft experiments may also be related to the exten- sive use in the Soviet Union (and to some extent, in the U.S.) of"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"197 Extraordinary Physics magnetic treatment of water pipes so that boilers do not develop so much hard precipitate. Magnetic treatment of water, for example, can rigorously be shown to alter some of a liquid's properties. Ament, for example, in numerous well-controlled repetitions has clearly shown an increase in auto gas mileage by using a strong magnetic apparatus on the fuel line. Best results are obtained by a magnet which only has one polarity facing the fuel line, and using three stages where the middle polarity is reversed. The effect of this apparatus is definitely scalar EM (gravitational) and expressed in the atomic nuclei in the molecules of the fuel flowing through the line. Again, the Ehrenhaft experiments may be related to the strange results of Viktor Schauberger, who obtained motive results with water and natural energy that have not been duplicated before or since, so far as anyone can tell. Schauberger utilized \"implosive\" energy rather than \"explosive\" energy — strongly suggesting he was using the negative time aspects of energy, hence negentropy. Schauberger also conceptual- ized this energy in a spiral form — and that is precisely the type of motion Ehrenhaft observed in many of his bubble experiments. That such negative time/negative energy is \"natural\" energy will be apparent from our next chapter, where we point out that all living things must use negative time/negative energy processes if they are to defeat the inexorable law of entropy — the increasing disorder of a system as its positive flow of time progresses. Note, for example, that a system that is 20% efficient in positive time would be 500% efficient in negative time. Let's look at another of Ehrenhaft's magnetic experiments. Taking the air gap between two very flat, very parallel pole pieces of sufficient width, one obtains a very accurately-parallel, uniform magnetic field in between them. Now suppose you place some very small particles of material—both magnetic and nonmag- netic — in the air gap. Common sense assures us that, if closer to the south pole, for example, one of the little magnetic particles will be attracted by the preponderance of south polarity. That is, a little magnetic north pole"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 1 98_ will be induced on the side of the particle nearest the south polepiece, and a little south pole will be induced on the particle on the side away from the south polepiece. The little particle will then be attracted to the south polepiece. Again, common sense assures us that, if closer to the north pole, the situation is reversed and the little particle is attracted to the north polepiece. Well, that isn't quite what happens. Some move to the south polepiece, and some move to the north polepiece. And it seems to vary by the type of material the little particle is comprised of. Now try another experiment. Let's make a permanent magnet motor. Understand, this one is not quite \"for free,\" for we'll consume \"fuel\"—the strength of the magnet and the acidified water solution. In this one, we use a glass cylindrical cell, with one vertical iron rod at the top and another at the bottom, and the rods serving as the pole pieces of a giant horseshoe magnet. (Or, for ease you can use an electromagnet). The cell is filled with the same acidified solution as before. Without the magnet, hydrogen bubbles can be seen rising as before. Now put on the magnet (or turn on the switch). Voila! the situation with the bubbles changes drastically. A spectacular mini- ature merry-go-round — a \"whirligig\" — of bubbles forms between the faces of the poles and parallel to them. Add some copper particles to the solution. The particles will rotate in the same plane, but in opposite directions from the bubbles. The stronger the magnetic field, the faster the particles and bubbles will contrarotate. If the magnetic field is reversed, the rotation of both the bubbles and the copper particles is reversed. Only a few months after this was reported in Popular Science Magazine, Brother Gabriel Kane of Manhattan College and Char- lea B. Reynolds of the Federal Communication Commission con- firmed Dr. Ehrenhaft's discovery of magnetic currents. They made a drop of copper sulfate solution spin between the polepieces of a permanent magnet. They also made an interposed microscope cover glass spin from the rotation of the copper sulfate. It was hinted they were heading toward power machinery. If so,"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"199 Extraordinary Physics nothing else was heard — possibly because they never solved the problem of consuming the magnet's strength and the acidified solution. Bill Mueller, the present inventor of a free-energy device, has also demonstrated the spinning of a piece of plastic in a magnetic field. After WWII, Dr. Ehrenhaft returned to his post in Vienna, published later work in French and other scientific journals, and died not long after. What is a magnetic monopole? First, let's reiterate what we mean by \"magnetic field.\" It'll take a little bit to get there, so please bear with me. By electric charge, we mean the virtual photon flux connected with a particle of mass or an object (of mass). One type of charge (by convention, positive) is modeled to constitute a \"source\" of this flux. The second type of charge (negative) is modeled to constitute a \"sink\" of this flux. Everything in electromagnetics is fluid flow, you see. The old guys who formed the theory believed that electricity was a thin material fluid. So they modeled it that way. They modeled the positive charge as an everlasting \"sprayer\" and the negative charge as a \"sink\" or everlasting accumulator. They reasoned that of course this \"stream\" of electric fluid could \"swirl\" or rotate, just as normal fluids can. This \"swirl\" in the stream of virtual photons is magnetostatic scalar potential — or magnetic pole for short.* Obviously there can be two directions of swirl — one right- handed, and one left-handed, with respect to the direction of the virtual photon stream. So there are two kinds of \"magnetic pole\" — north (right-hand swirl) and south (left-hand swirl). The strength of one of these \"swirls\" can vary, of course, and that's a variation in the strength of the corresponding pole. You can also think of the \"pressure\" of the swirl, so to speak, at least for modeling purposes. In that model, north swirl is \"higher *Rigorously, a permanent magnet does not produce an observable B field in vacuum! Instead, it produces the dynamic, swirling \"potential\" for that field — i.e., an unzipped field. A particle of observable mass placed in this field integrates and \"zips\" — producing the observed B-field on and of the spinning observable particle."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 200 than ambient\" pressure, and south swirl is \"lower than ambient\" pressure, where \"ambient\" means \"with respect to right-hand swirl.\" The swirl pressure is then considered to \"bleed off/flow\" from north pole to south pole. This is modeled by Faraday's \"flux lines of force.\" This bleed off (gradient) from north pole to south pole is called the magnetic force field, or just \"magnetic field\" for short, even though in vacuum it's really an unzipped magnetic field. Note that the original modelers didn't consider negative time and negative energy at all. And they didn't know anything about phase conjugation — in fact, the electron had not even been discov- ered when all this model was originally put together. But back to the model. Considering the swirling fluid as \"con- served\", if you produced a concentration of one kind of swirl at one place, you had to decrease the concentration elsewhere, which is the same as producing and adding opposite swirl there. Thus, conceptu- ally, in the simplest case (only two swirls allowed), a north pole and a south pole always occur together in a pair — though of course there's no limit to the distance between the pair. Notice that if you have a conservative field such as we assumed, you are keeping your overall frame of observation Lorentzian — in other words, conservative. You do not have a \"curved spacetime\" to speak of, by assumption. Now of course, you can have compound and very complicated magnets and magnetic fields — you don't always have to have everything so neat and simple. In that case, conceptually you could have — for example — one north pole and two south poles. In fact, it's easily possible to demonstrate that: a bar of magnetic material is simply magnetized so that a north pole is in the middle, and a south pole is at each end. Now bend it around a bit, and you get the point. However, now let us suppose that we curve spacetime itself, locally — something they avoid in present physics by pure assump- tion. Specifically, we curve our local spacetime in such a fashion that there's more right-hand swirl in the local region than there is left- hand swirl there. In that case, we have a north-pole region there , all by itself. We"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"201 Extraordinary Physics have a magnetic north monopole. If that \"curved spacetime\" region of trapped swirl is moving, that constitutes magnetic current, and it may be either positive (north polar) or negative (south polar) flow. It's as simple as that! Only when you curve local spacetime can you get a magnetic \"charge\" or monopole. Everyone who's trying to demonstrate a magnetic monopole in uncurved spacetime is doomed to failure a priori. It takes but little reflection to see that, conceptu- ally, a magnetic monopole is a curvature of local spacetime. Indeed, each of the two poles of a bar magnet is precisely that anyway. Now a monopole can indeed be \"made\", by bending local space- time correctly. It can be made in two ways: in the virtual state vacuum itself, or in and on physical materials. It's easiest to make it in the virtual state: just curving the local spacetime will do that. When this \"excess swirl flux without corresponding antiswirl flux\" is impressed into and onto matter, however, the atomic nuclei are affected, producing excited \"magnetic states.\" In addition, a great deal of physical stress is created in the material, due to monopolar repulsion between the various \"nuclear monopoles deposited in it.\" If a sufficiently strong monopole intensity (magnetic charge) is produced in the material, the material will violently fragment from internal stress. When a metal, for example, undergoes such a \"monopolar fragmentation\", it is common to see \"tiled edges\" of the metal rupture, much as twisted little \"planks\" or tiles of metal unfurled and \"split.\" Such a break may be a positive signature of the involvement of virtual magnetic monopoles (i.e., by the metal having acquired virtual magnetic monopolar charge, causing the disrup- tion). This precise type of metal fracture has been very well demon- strated in experiments by Canadian experimenter John Hutchin- son. Anomalous, powerful breaks in metal have been obtained by Hutchinson where the two ends that break apart both have a north pole or a south pole. The anomalous hole in the fuselage of the Arrow DC-8 destroyed at Gander Air Force Base, Newfoundland on Dec. 12,1985, strongly suggests that an electromagnetic missile struck the aircraft, inducing monopolar effects. That would also match the- three eyewitnesses' description of an anomalous glow on part of the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Physics 202 aircraft as it faltered and then fell. Supercharges and Fractional Charges Now without further ado, let me just state flatly that the only way to get a fractional charge is to have an appreciable curvature of local spacetime. To get that local curvature, it's going to be very difficult to use liquid. For weak effects, it will almost always change its bond structure and not localize the curvature in the nuclei. So \"fractional charges\" in liquid are much harder to come by. However, with solids it's a different thing, particularly if you make the solid material very, very small and nonlinear — precisely like Ehrenhaft's little red selenium oxide spheres. There you can get the curvature to localize without so much bleedoff through the bonding lattice. The greatest electrical wizard of all, Nikola Tesla, reported producing electrons with 50 times the normal electrical charge of an electron. That's readily understandable if you look at what's happen- ing to the charge of a particle: To have 50 times as much charge, the electron must be exchanging virtual photon flux with its surround- ing vacuum at 50 times the rate of the normal vacuum. In other words, it's the vacuum (spacetime) which must be NODAL POINTS Figure 70. Forming magnetic monopoles with a standing scalar EM wave.

Actually, that happens anyway whenever the electron is in an electrical potential field. There are many unrecognized assumptions in the postulate that the electron charge is fixed. If you curve local spacetime in one direction, you get the charge, of an electron increased. If you curve it in the other direction, you get the charge decreased. In that case it's called a quark. At any rate, our own scientists have been looking in the wrong way and in the wrong place for magnetic monopoles and fractional charges. Work such as that of Ehrenhaft and others should be re- evaluated. And, most certainly, the basis of the present electromag- netic theory should be both re-examined and reformulated. *Such as the implication that the free electron is always free to move, and that potential surrounding the electron always possesses a translating gradient when it changes.

Most chemists also insist that all reactions occurring in living systems are chemical in nature. They believe fervently that chemistry can and must explain life itself. In the early 1960's, a French researcher named Louis Kervran published work which flew directly in the face of the accepted chemistry dogma. Kervran reported the astounding results of his research showing that living plants were able to accomplish limited transmutation of elements. Kervran was then the Conferences Director at the University of Paris, and his first paper was published in La Revue Generale Des Sciences, July 1960. What was so revolutionary was that, according to the prevailing wisdom of science, you can't transmute elements (permanently change the nucleus) except with enormous energy — certainly not with the microvolts and millivolts (and microwatts and milliwatts) that living systems can muster electromagnetically. * Rutherford, the British physicist who discovered the nucleus of the atom, had shown in 1919 that you can bombard elements with alpha particles and transmute them. The accepted wisdom of today is exactly the same, except that the physicists have used heavier and heavier \"bullets\" in their artillery approach. No one has tried a controlled approach, for the catchecism is that you have to use the wham it harder! approach. In other words, to most scientists the whole thing had to be preposterous, and Kervran had to be deluded. Kervran published further details of his work in a book, Trans- mutations Biologiques, Maloine, Paris 1962. But the initial reac- *Note, however.that since gravity is infolded EM, one can have extremely powerful infolded EM, yet only have miniscule electrical (outfolded) residues.

Few scientists would stoop to repeating Kervran's experiments, which of course they knew could not work anyway. Actually the effect is widespread amongst living systems. As Kervran pointed out, the ground in Brittany contained no calcium; however, every day a hen would lay a perfectly normal egg, with a perfectly normal shell containing calcium. The hens do eagerly peck mica from the soil, and mica contains potassium — a single step below calcium in the standard table of elements. It appears that the hens may transmute some of the potassium to calcium. Further, if one tests this assumption, it is quickly shown to be true. Hens denied calcium but not potassium, stay perfectly healthy and lay perfectly normal eggs. Hens denied both potassium and calcium will be sickly and lay only soft-shelled eggs. If these sick chickens are allowed to peck only mica — which they will frantically do — everything returns to normal again. Most orthodox scientists nevertheless remained skeptical or downright hostile. However, a few other scientists began to repeat Kervran's Figure 72. The Kervran effect.

Several of these corroborat- ing scientists were (1) Professor Hisatoki Komaki, Chief of the Laboratory of Applied Microbiology at a leading Japanese univer- sity, (2)Professor Pierre Baranger, Head of the Laboratory of Chemi- cal Biology of the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, and (3) J.E. Zundel, then head of a paper company with a chemical analysis laboratory, and later a chemical engineer of the Polytechicum School of Zurich, Switzerland. Later work by Zundel was particularly decisive: he utilized the mass spectrometer at the Microanalysis Laboratory of the French National Scientific Research Center, and neutron activation mass analysis at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research in Villigen to positively confirm an increase in calcium of 61% to an accuracy of 2%. Such results and instrumentation, of course, removed any doubt that the effect could be due to statistical variation. In the same experiments, the plants increased their phosphorus 29% and their sulphur 36%. Komaki became head of a research laboratory at Matsushita Electric Company. There he conducted research conclusively prov- ing that microorganisms (including some bacteria and two kinds each of molds and yeast) could transmute sodium into potassium. In fact, he placed a brewer's yeast product on the market that, when applied to composts, increases their potassium content. Extensive work in the area has been done in the Soviet Union, where results similar to Kervran's have been substantiated. Thus all doubt (to an open-minded scientist) was removed: living systems are able to change one element into another by some unknown means, using very feeble energy. A noted French physicist, O Costa De Beauregard, suggested a mechanism for the transmutations, using weak force interactions and advanced waves. No one — even Kervran himself— thought of negative energy/ negative time interactions. The jury is still out on the actual mechanism, but it is absolutely clear that the transmutation does indeed occur. The Japanese researchers, having replicated Kervran's as- tounding results to their complete satisfaction, recommended him to Extraordinary Biology 206"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"207 Extraordinary Biology the Nobel Committee for a Nobel Prize for such epochal work. Thus Kervran became a Nobel nominee, though he was not granted the prize. Kervran has since passed away, leaving behind his books and papers that point to a revolution in chemistry and physics - transmutation of elements at very weak energy. Biological Transmutation Has a History Actually biological transmutation — and transmutation of ele- ments (alchemy) in general — has a history, of both results and suppression. Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, a celebrated French chemist, discov- ered that chickens could produce more calcium in their eggshells than entered their bodies. Hence they had to be able to \"create\" the calcium, else their own bodies would have been completely depleted. One of his contemporaries, however — Antoine Laurent La- voisier — became the \"father of chemistry.\" Lavoisier laid down the dictum that nothing was created. So chemistry fixed upon the notion that the combinations of elements could be shifted, but the element itself could not be transformed. Not until the discovery of radioactivity did any crack in this solid wall appear. But still, the basic ideas of chemistry said the element couldn't be transformed chemically. It could only be transformed if one blasted the daylights out of it with an atomic or particle bullet. . Today most chemists still hold that exact same opinion, un- shaken. To resume: Over a century ago, a chemist named Albrecht von Herzeele proved that germinating seeds somehow transmuted ele- ments in the process. In 1873 von Herzeele published a book, The Origin of Inorganic Substances, where he showed research proving that plants continuously create material elements. Even earlier, in 1822 an Englishman named William Prout had studied chicken eggs in incubation. He found that hatched chicks had more lime (calcium) in their bodies than was originally present in the egg! Another French scientist named Henri Spindler discovered that, a kind of algae called Laminaria could create iodine. A German researcher named Vogel had planted cress seeds in a"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 208 bell jar. They were fed nothing but distilled water; still, when grown they contained more sulphur than had been in the seeds originally. Lawes and Gilbert, two British researchers, also found that plants could \"extract\" more elements from the soil than the soil actually contained in the first place. Baranger performed thousands of meticulous experiments in plant transmutation of elements. He proved that the transmuta- tions do occur. He also discovered that many things affected the germinating seed transmutation process: the time the seeds germi- nate, the type of light they are exposed to, the phase of the moon, etc. None of these experimenters understood the transmutation process used by the living organism. But they proved beyond ques- tion that the process existed, and universally occurred. Surplus-of-Energy Mechanisms Proposed by the U.S. Army There has also been other very positive support for the thesis that if living systems transmute elements, they can produce a net source of energy in the process. In 1978 an officially-funded effort of the U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Command, Fort Belvoir, Virginia positively confirmed that mechanisms for elemental trans- mutations could occur in biological systems, from an energy consid- eration. The work was performed under the direction of Emil J. York, Chief of the Material Technology Laboratory. Solomon Goldfein was the principal investigator for the effort. Robert C. McMillan, Chief of the Radiation Research Group of the laboratory, provided guidance on matters of physics and nuclear physics. The abstract of the final report (S. Goldfein, Report 2247, E nergy Development from Elemental Transmutations in Biological Systems, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Command, May 1978. DDC No. AD A056906.) reads as follows: \"The purpose of the study was to determine whether recent disclosures of elemental transmutations occurring in biological enti- ties have revealed new possible sources of energy. The works of Kervran, Komaki, and others were surveyed, and it was concluded"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"209 Extraordinary Biology that, granted the existence of such transmutations (Na to Mg, K to Ca, and Mn to Fe), then a net surplus of energy was also produced. A proposed mechanism was described in which Mg adenosine triphosphate, located in the mitochondrion of the cell, played a double role as an energy producer. In addition to the widely accepted biochemical role of MgATP in which it produces energy as it disintegrates part by part, MgATP can also be considered to be a cyclotron on a molecular scale. The MgATP when placed in layers one atop the other has all the attributes of a cyclotron in accordance with the requirements set forth by E.O. Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron.\" \"It was concluded that elemental transmutations were indeed occurring in life organisms and were probably accompanied by a net energy gain.\" The researchers also concluded that elemental transmutations occurring in life organisms are accompanied by losses in mass representing conversion to thermal energy, and that such energy probably is a net gain when compared to the amount required to effect the transmutation. All in all, they concluded that the little cell with its feeble energy does quite well! It's in control of cyclotrons, and cyclotron forces, and direct conversion of mass to energy. Pretty good for a little bitty beastie, wouldn't you say? Actually, one should point out that, according to nuclear phys- ics, an atom gets a little heavier when it absorbs (usually by means of an orbital electron) a normal \"positive energy\" photon. That is, the addition of positive energy results in the addition of a little bit of \"positive mass.\" Negative energy, of course, does a similar thing to the nucleus — except that it adds \"negative mass.\" Thus the nucleus of the atom, when it absorbs negative energy, gets lighter. This is seen in the external world as \"loss of mass.\" With our present nuclear physics, only positive energy is as- sumed except in extremely rare cases. Thus the Army study — which was conducted and controlled by some excellent scientists — worked out a \"loss of mass\" the way"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 210 they're trained to. By adding some positive energy, the nucleus would gain some positive mass. By adding some negative energy, the nucleus would lose some corresponding positive mass. The conventional physics then would equate this \"loss of mass\" as the direct conversion of mass to energy. And so it is, only it's conversion to negative energy! However, by pointing out the cyclotron mechanism in the cell MgATP, the Army researchers have made a most important contri- bution. Note also that the whirling motion may be very much related to Viktor Schauberger's work and to Wilhelm Reich's work. Both of them worked with what they viewed as an unusual kind of living, spiraling energy. All the orbital electrons of an atom also are whirling around in orbit, in the simplest model. Further, these orbits themselves move and rotate or precess. Similar orbits and shells occur in the nucleus, at least in some models (several rather independent models are used there for specific things.) It may be that a whirling, spiraling (cyclotron) energy motion is necessary to connect positive energy to orbital electron (negative charge) shells, and to connect negative energy to positive charge shells in the atomic nucleus. * Alchemy and Unusual Critters In ancient times, the old alchemists pursued the dream of making gold. Obviously, if one could do that economically, one could become quite wealthy. Just as obviously, the kings and rulers of the world took rather a dim view of such proceedings. After all, much of their own power rested on their ability to get and control gold. And if some \"loose cannon\" could make all the gold anyone wanted, then the national t reasury of the king wouldn't be worth a plugged nickel. And that would finish the king, for he would be powerless. •The spinning/whirling motion may be viewed as integrating the unzipped vacuum flux virtual vectors into zipped observable force vectors —just as great grandma's spinning wheel integrated fibers into continuous threads."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology There are some unorthodox researchers today who take the view that the alchemists were stamped out — not because they failed, but because they succeeded. I subscribe to the same view. T.H. Moray had a process to \"recover finely divided gold from quartzite sands.\" My personal, strong belief is that he possessed a practical transmutation process. His knowledge and techniques, of course, are still possessed by his sons, and reside through them in Cosray Research Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah. The possession of such a technical secret may be one of the major reasons why the Morays have met with such intrigue, harassment, and suppression over the years. To speak further on \"making gold,\" we first have to present some details on some special \"critters\" that live, but that can't be observed through a normal microscope — even an electron microscope. In that vein, toward the end of this chapter, we will present some of Royal R. Rife's fundamental discoveries. Pay particular attention to his discovery of \"finer\" living forms — which today we could only refer to as \"living energy, virtual-state forms.\" Let's call them critters for short. At one time, when the earth was young and the radiation from the sun was different, conditions on earth were much hotter. Great volcanic activity and fiery eruptions were commonplace and nearly continuous. Huge storms, of size and magnitude undreamed of today, swept the primitive atmosphere. The oceans were frenzied. Under those conditions, many types of \"critters\" were highly active. Most of the critters, for example, lived in and worked on the atomic nuclei of matter . After all, the critters are living, virtual-state organisms. There's a continual exchange between the virtual state (the vacuum, or spacetime) and mass (the observable state). An atomic nucleus is like an island in the \"virtual state ocean\", and the flux interchange is like waves breaking onto the island and then washing back to sea. The critters live in that ocean, and wash upon, so-to-speak, the mass-islands and interact with them. In those primal days, many of the present great mineral deposits of the earth were created due to the transmutation activities of the 211"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 212 critters. One kind, for example, lived in copper. In an \"energetics\" sense, this critter \"ate\" copper and \"excreted\" gold, so-to-speak. Much of the gold that occurs in great copper deposits today was formed this way in the old days under primal conditions. When conditions on earth changed, these little \"copper critters\" ceased their incessant activity and became dormant, just as viruses can do. But the critters are still there in the copper ore, waiting to be activated. And activate them you can! You can even get the critters into a solution, and then crystallize them out as crystals. These crystals are what the alchemists of old called the philosopher's stone, with the power to transmute base elements into gold. There are several kinds of philosopher's stones; this kind is for copper. At any rate, you can then place these special crystals on some copper (and add another thing or two), and restore them to a similar primal environment as of old. That is, heat them in an electric furnace. Blast them with terrible electrical bolts. Bathe them in intense ultraviolet light. That's just a nice, refreshing spring day for the critters!* That stimulates them and revives them. They wake up after a long sleep — and they're immediately \"hungry.\" So they go right to work on the copper. Boom! In a little bit there isn't any more copper, just mostly gold, with a little other miscellaneous residue thrown in, such as black ruby and silver (in the experiments of one of my close colleagues). The gold is radioactive when first made. Fortunately, all isotopes of gold are very short-lived: just minutes suffice for the radioactivity to die away. So you wait half an hour and everything's okay. That's all there is to it. And if you do that and try to capitalize upon it, your life expectancy is about 24 hours. I don't know whether or not biological systems, in their Kervran- *Note the probable similar effects involved in the Miller-Fox-Urey experiments in biogenesis"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"213 Extraordinary Biology transmutations at weak energy, deliberately manipulate similar \"critters.\" I suspect, however, that they do, at least to some extent. The Cell Also Lives and Functions in the Virtual State Obviously, to transmute elements the living system has to be able to directly affect and influence the atomic nucleus. It has been shown that this is a cellular capability, for single- celled organisms can do it. As we shall see, Rife's work showed that the living cell is connected to at least 16 intemested deeper levels of reality than a relative \"point\" under an ordinary microscope. Further, all levels are structured and organized. Think of it! Each one of those levels is to the preceding level as microscopy today is to the normal world. Sixteen levels! I think it's reasonable to state that the life of the cell is patterned and dynamically structured and functioning all the way into the virtual state; indeed, to very deep intemested levels of the virtual state. That is, it also functions hyperspatially. We shall also see that the mind and thought involve these more subtle physical (though virtual) levels. Thus the living virtual-state levels are a reality, for Rife proved it. The living organized structures at each level are a reality, for Rife proved it. The living ordering and control of dynamic functions on all those levels is a reality, for Rife proved it. Those living virtual-level parts of the living organism — plant or animal — thus affect, function in, and reside in the atomic nuclei of the material that composes its bodily structures. Beasties like bacteria and viruses also have living, organized energy structures in multiple levels of virtual state. Apparently, for these more primitive life forms, the virtual-state \"energy part\" can be separated and pass through a filter, then re-engender the physi- cal form and/or itself cause the disease in a host! At least that is what Rife and other scientists showed. \"Bigger fleas have smaller fleas to bite 'em, And so on, ad infinitum.\" Of course the living system can \"work on\" the nucleus and"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 214 change it a little bit! If it couldn't do so, it couldn't stay alive and function in there in the first place! The Kaznacheyev Experiments Dr. Vlail Kaznacheyev is Director of the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Novosibirsk. For 20 years he has been directing highly unusual experiments with twin cell cultures. These experiments are vital to understand- ing disease and healing on a more fundamental basis than is presently utilized by orthodox medical science. The Kaznacheyev experiments (several thousand) in the Soviet Union proved conclusively that any cellular disease or death pattern can be transmitted electromagnetically, and induced in target cells absorbing the radiation. In the experiments, two sealed containers were placed side by side, with a thin optical window separating them. The two contain- ers were completely environmentally shielded except for the optical coupling. A tissue was separated into two identical samples, and one sample placed in each of the two halves of the apparatus. The cells in one sample (on one side of the glass) were then subjected to a deleterious agent — a selected virus, bacterial infec- tion, chemical poison, nuclear radiation, deadly ultraviolet radia- tion, etc. This led to disease and death of the exposed/infected cell culture sample. If the thin optical window was made of ordinary window glass, the uninfected cells on the other side of the window were undamaged and remained healthy. This of course was as expected in the ortho- dox medical view. However, if the thin optical window was made of quartz, a most unexpected thing happened. Some time (usually about 12 hours) after the disease appeared in the infected sample, the same features of disease appeared in the uninfected sample. This startling \"infection by optical coupling\" occurred in a substantial percentage of the tests (70 to 80 percent). From an orthodox medical view, these results were unexpected and unheard of.

Guided by A.G. Gurvitsch's work that showed that cells give off mitogenetic radiation (photons) that can affect other cells, the Kaznacheyev team sought an answer by looking for photons given off by the infected culture sample as its cells died. They found that the cells in the infected culture gave off photons in the near ultraviolet when they died. The normal window glass was opaque to these near-UV photons and absorbed them. In that case, the uninfected culture on the other side of the glass was not exposed to radiation by the UV \"death\" photons from the dying cells, and they remained serenely healthy. However, the quartz window was transparent to the UV \"death photons\". When the quartz window was installed, the UV \"death photons\" passed through it and were absorbed in the uninfected culture on the other side of the window. Most of the time, the uninfected culture which absorbed \"death photons\" sickened and died with the same disease symptoms. The Kaznacheyev experiments proved conclusively that cellular Figure 75.

That is, the cells of the biosystem are charged with an electromagnetic potential, and addi- tions and changes to the potential are continually received. The cell is thus in minute disequilibrium. Usually the myriad of continual inputs from the external envi- ronment into the cell's potential charge pattern (in its atomic nuclei) may be taken to be potential changes whose substructures are disordered. In that case, no specific environmental effect is observed except slight fluctuations without order — a miniscule form of \"heating.\" However, if a continual ordered substructure exists in the input from the external environment into the cell's potential, the cell's potential will gradually \"charge up\" with that pattern. An analogy will prove helpful. Imagine an accumulator, a largo pot, that holds a volume of water. Several pipes are connected to tho pot, some are inputs for water coming in, and some are outputs for water flowing in. Imagine the inputs all containing \"blue\" water, just in slightly varying shades. The water in the pot is blue, and may slightly rise and fall in level as the input flow rates vary. The water in the pot may also vary slightly in its blueness as the inputs vary. However, it will still be blue. Now suppose that yellow water starts flowing through one of the input pipes, and at a goodly rate. Slowly the water in the pot will start to turn greenish as a greater percentage of yellow builds up. In other words, the pot slowly charges up with some of the \"yellow\" charge, in the process acquiring a \"green\" charge. *We point out that this effect has been investigated in both the infrared and ultraviolet. IR to UV may be taken as a single harmonic interval — an octave, musically speaking. The same effect can be reproduced in any other \"octave\" (single harmonic interval) of the electromag- netic frequency spectrum. The reversal of the effect can also be achieved in any harmonic interval. The mechanism for these effects involves the cellular biopotential, Popp's master cellular control system, and the deterministically-tailorcd substructure of photons."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 218 The biopotential in the cell experiments works the same way. A cell has a biopotential built up, which represents the \"nominal equilibrium\" of the scalar charge on the cell. This biopotential, being mostly a \"sum-zero\" of virtual state vectors, is centered in and on the atomic nuclei of the cell, constituting charge patterns in these atomic nuclei. The biopotential extends out of the atomic nuclei, through the electron shells, into and through the molecules, through the internal cell structures and membrane, and outside the cell. From the atomic nucleus on out through the cell, every layered structure or organization of the cell will layer, structure, and organize the biopotential accordingly. This organized, structured cellular biopotential is continually receiving \"charge patterns\" contained in incoming photons absorbed by the cell. The biopotential is also continually exhausting some of its biopotential charge pattern in the photons (heat, light, etc.) that the cell emits. The Cell's Electromagnetic Breathing Via structured photon exchange, the biopotential of the living cell thus \"breathes in\" the virtual state charge structure of its environment, and \"breathes out\" its own internal virtual state charge structure. So, in the experiment, the uninfected cells are continually absorbing photons from their surrounding environment, and emit- ting photons back to it as well. According to our scalar EM view, each photon it absorbs has a substructure that depends upon the part of the environment from whence it came. These \"substructures\" are actually patterns of the sum-zeroed virtual vectors comprising the potential of the absorbed photon carriers. Normally, since a large number of very different substructures are continually being \"input\" into the cell's potential from the absorbed photons, the substructure of the cell's potential receives an essentially disorganized continual input from the environment. This liquates to the fact that the environment does not normally specifi- cally influence or change the cell's potential with ordered informa- t.ion (organization).*"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"219 Extraordinary Biology When a cell dies, it ceases to maintain the bio-dynamics that sustained its artificial potential (that part due to bio-ordering by its organized life processes, above the background level of its \"inert matter\" potential). The dead cell's built-up artificial potential then \"discharges\" by emitting a structured photon.** Since this photon (energy) comes from an organized potential drop, the virtual substructure of the emitted photon is organized. The photon, then — among other things — carries the exact organized virtual charge pattern of the dying cell's disease. We strongly insist on the quantum mechanical view here: All physical changes — chemical, material, mechanical, whatever — at root level are constituted and caused by virtual state interactions, in direct patterns of virtual particle exchanges. In the full QM view, what's really going on in primary physical reality is just a complex set of patterns and changes in potentials anyway. The Summed Virtual Structures of Kaznacheyev's \"Death Photons\" Physically Kindle the Disease At any rate, the Kaznacheyev experiments showed that the dying cells from the infected culture emitted photons in the near UV that contained artificial (structured) potentials. The virtual-state, patterned-substructures in this photon flux directly represented tho cellular disease pattern caused by the original cell's specific infec- tion. In other words, as the infected cells died, they emitted \"death photons\" which contained the template pattern of their death condition. When these \"death photons\" are absorbed into uninfected cells, their deterministic substructures gradually diffuse into the cell's bio-potentials.

The master cellular control system of the biosystem is itself a dynamically changing, ordered pattern in the biopotential of the cells, which is centered in the atomic nuclei comprising the cell materials. As the bio-potentials of the cells gradually acquire the \"death photon's\" substructure pattern, this pattern is also diffused throughout (modulates) the master cellular control system. All the cells in the sample (or in a biosystem) are now slowly charging up with the \"death photon\" pattern. As Popp discovered, photons continually \"leak out\" of the virtual photon master control system of the biosystem. Some of these leakage photons are observable photons, but most are virtual pho- tons. Further, they are structured photons. In other words, as leakage photons spill out of the master control system, observable change is now being slowly initiated in the physical structures, biochemistry, etc. of the biosystem's cells — and those changes are in consonance with the integrated \"cellular death pattern\" of the originally infected cells. Note particularly that it is already well-known in quan- tum mechanics/electrodynamics that, when a photon is emitted from the surface of a dielectric body, the entire dielectric body participates in that emission. If a photon is absorbed on the surface of the dielectric body, the entire"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"221 Extraordinary Biology dielectric body participates in that absorption. Thus as irradiation by the \"death photons\" continues, the \"death structure\" in the irradiated cells increases. It is spread throughout the cell culture by the master communication system, gradually charging the virtual state structure of that system with the death pattern. Spillage photons from the cellular control system occur through- out the culture. These photons are structured with the death pat- tern, and gradually affect the cell and its biochemistry physically. The previously uninfected cells thus physically start to acquire and exhibit the symptoms and characteristics of the disease pattern that killed the infected cells. Electromagnetic Infection Results in Physical Disease The new cells are now electromagnetically infected and physi- cally diseased. After all, that is all a cellular disease is in the first place — physical, electrical, and biochemical changes in the normal function- ing of the cell. For a given pattern of changes in the cells, a specific \"disease\" exists in them. It absolutely does not matter what causes this exact pattern. If the specific physical pattern is there, the specific disease is there. Note that any ghost pattern in the virtual state flux can charge up physical matter — that is, the atomic nuclei of a mass. All that is necessary is that a continual flux of thin virtual pattern continually bathe (irradiate) the mass's atomic nuclei. The eventual emergence of this \"ghost template pattern\" into observable physical reality is called kindling. Kindling is charging up one or more atomic nuclei with an integrated virtual charge pattern until the integrated pattern breaches the quantum thresh- old, resulting in emergence of that pattern into observable physical change.

Mirror CPE appeared only when the quartz or mica window was no thicker than 0.8 mm. A. F. Kirkin also duplicated the experiments using a thin plexiglas window. There are conditions which enhance the effect, and others which inhibit or degrade it. Irradiation of the detector-culture with a low dose of UV prior to its optical contact enhances the effect, increasing 4 Rev. Gastroenterol. 15 271-277, 1948. 5 Am. J.

Increasing the temperature to 38.5 degrees centigrade also enhances the effect (from 37% to 90% for example).* A necessary condition for the success of the experiment is the rotation of the holder with its two optically-coupled samples at a rate of about 24-25 revolutions per hour. Optical contact between the inductor and detector cells for a minimum of 4-6 hours is necessary, after which the cell cultures can be separated. A longer contact time is necessary for complete development of the irreversible effect. Both cultures must be maintained in complete darkness throughout the experiment. Use of the detector as a new inductor in a successive state reduces the effect by 20-30%. Three or four such stages is sufficient to eliminate the effect. There is a seasonal variation in the results. In more than 15,000 experiments, monthly variations and daily variations were noted. (The present author's interpretation of this is that it is due to the monthly variations in the virtual photon substructure input from the moon to the substructure of the cell's bio-potential. The daily variation is due to the daily variations in the virtual photon substructure input from the sun to the substructure of the cell's bio- potential.) Negative results appear more often in winter. (The present author's interpretation of this is that it is due to the fact that the scalar potentials of the earth and the biopotentials of each living cell on earth are lowered in winter by the weaker flux from the sun.) Effects are correlated with the polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field. Negative polarity of the field usually precedes the appearance of mirror CPE. (This is because of the positive nuclei — which prefer one direction of the magnetic field over another). Disturbance of the geomagnetic field several days before a culture planting also results in enhancing the mirror CPE effect. (Disturb- ing the geomagnetic field provides a \"dithering magnetic distur- bance\" in the atomic nuclei which \"livens\" them. Consequently their readiness to charge-up and emit structured virtual state charges is increased). Kaznacheyev further discovered that the Sun's activity and the •This is very important. Preconditioning the cells by \"dithering\" them in the frequency band of interest, or in a subharmonic band, \"livens\" the cells for developing the irradiated pattern. Thin is similar to a dither voltage placed on a missile fin, making it much easier and quicker for the fin to move when an actual order is placed on it."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"225 Extraordinary Biology Earth's magnetic field greatly affected the results of his experi- ments. Large flashes on the sun seem to inhibit the effect. (Such flashes cause substantially increased irradiation of the atomic nuclei by sun-emitted substructures, charging them mostly with this disordered substructure pattern and literally \"burying\" the disease structure several decibels below it.) In a season of active sunspots, the mirror CPE effect becomes highly unstable. (The sun emissions are sporadically jamming the effect.) Under active sun conditions, the effect varies from 90-100% on some days to complete absence on others. Some Biological Warfare Implications The Soviets reported detecting near-ultraviolet photons — bio- luminescence — as carriers of the death/disease pattern. However, scientists at the University of Marburg in West Ger- many also duplicated the effect in the infrared. This shows that bioluminescent photons in the near UV and in the IR can definitely carry \"disease and death\" information between cells. Further, inte- grating a continuing input of such photons coherently integrates the disease or death pattern from the virtual state into the observable state. Note also that portions of the infrared spectrum are a subhar- monic of the near ultraviolet. Harmonics are well-known in nonlin- ear oscillator theory, and biological systems are filled with nonlinear oscillators. It may be that harmonics and subharmonics are directly involved in the death pattern. If so, the induction of such \"death patterns\" upon normal electro- magnetic carriers is directly indicated. For example, modulations covering several octaves in the region of 10 gigahertz and above might be constructed that are the analogues of some particular cellular disease. This modulation pattern could then be added to a common microwave carrier — say in the communication band, from 3 to 30 megahertz. Say, that is, to something like the giant Soviet Woodpecker \"over-the-horizon radar\" signals as carriers. In that case, a large population could be bombarded, even on the other side of the earth, with \"death photons\" whose virtual state substructures carry the particular disease pattern. With sufficient"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 226 time, many of the targeted persons would develop the disease. Note that, even if the power and/or irradiation time is reduced so that the absorbed \"death photons\" are insufficient to actually kindle the disease in the targeted population, a heightened change in the substructure of the biopotentials of the cells of the targeted persons is still accomplished. In that case, a precursor pattern — a predisposition for that disease — exists in the targeted persons. If the actual disease agent is now loosed on that popula- tion, the agent will be far more infectious and lethal than it otherwise would. In this way, even diseases which normally do not kill or seriously debilitate the infected person can suddenly become very lethal agents indeed. Influenza, the common cold, etc. can become devastating killers if the exposed population has been electromagneti- cally \"pre-conditioned\" for enhanced susceptibility. What Kaznacheyev Hid: The Role of Phase Conjugation If cellular disease can be electromagnetically induced, can it not be electromagnetically corrected or healed? If one could time-reverse the exact signal structure (the informa- tion) that kindled the effect, and bombard the diseased cells with that reversed pattern, would not the cell deviate back to \"normal\" and be healed? The burning question as to whether cellular disease conditions can be corrected by time-reversed disease signals must certainly have occurred to the Soviet experimenters. It is highly significant that they did not openly publish those results.* As we have explained in the sections on phase conjugation and scalar electromagnetics, there are really two major kinds of photons: *Recent information indicates the strong connection of Kaznacheyev with the Institute of Physiology and Biophysics and the Frank Institute in Pushkino, just outside Moscow. Since these institutes are deeply involved in microwave and coherent microwave \"directed energy\" weapons, it is highly probable that the Soviets are applying Kaznacheyev's \"death photons\" to microwave weapons — such as the Woodpecker transmitters. If so, obviously they would develop phase conjugate countermeasure signals as well."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology (1) the \"normal\" photon carries positive energy and positive time. (2) the \"time reversed\" or phase conjugate photon carries negative energy and negative time. Further, the Soviets certainly knew all about phase conjugate signals. After all, they discovered and developed the effect. We discovered it only from the open Soviet scientific literature! Let us assume that the \"death photons\" in the mitogenetic radiation emitted by the dying cells are ordinary photons. Their virtual state structures (in positive observer time) are exact \"tem- plates\" for the disease pattern. Now suppose we detect the \"death photons\" with a phase conju- gator, which by definition will produce a time-reversed counterpart to the input signal detected. In other words, the death photons are allowed to strike a phase conjugate mirror (PCM). Time-reversed counterpart photons — carrying the exact time-reversed template of the death pattern — will be created and emitted by the PCM. These newly emitted photons now carry the exact \"heal- ing pattern\" for that specific \"death/disease pattern that was received and detected.\" Further, if we \"pump\" the phase conjugate mirror, we can greatly amplify the output pattern, and hence greatly in- crease the healing pattern! If one records the pattern of the \"death photons\" for a specific disease, one could of course modulate that pattern upon ordinary photons/signals — such as the Woodpecker signals — and accom- plish disease induction or precursor conditioning. By phase conjugating the pattern of the \"death photons,\" one can produce an exact antidote. One can modulate this specific healing pattern upon ordinary photons/signals — such as the Woodpecker signals — and accomplish healing induction for that specific disease. In other words, one can create the healing pattern — the antidote, if you will, for any biological warfare agent. Can- cer, leukemia, AIDS, viral diseases, bacterial diseases, what- ever. One can create the antidote within minutes after the first symptoms of the disease or death pattern appear.

Now one can see why the Soviets are so ready to expose the entire world to something like AIDS. It doesn't represent a real problem to them, the instant they decide to negate it. So they can devastate the rest of the world, with the assurance that their population is safe. They can allow some of their own people to develop AIDS — and even some to die of it — as a deception plan to delude the West while Western populations are succumbing en masse. Then they can snatch their own population right back to health, from \"the brink of the grave,\" so to speak. Our government must immediately develop the same capability. It is straightforward. As weapons and counterweapons go, it is enormously cheap. It can be immediately and widely implemented. And it can protect our population against AIDS or any other biologi- cal warfare strike by the Soviet Union. We can save our people from the AIDS knockout already un- leashed upon us by the Soviet Union. First let us do that. Then let us negotiate. Remember this: You can negotiate with the Russians only from a position of strength. If you are weak, they will bury you. If we do not immediately develop this biological warfare counter- measure, we are already as good as dead. Popp's Master Cellular Communication System Dr. Fritz Albert Popp has already discovered and pointed out the \"virtual state\" master communication system that controls all cells in the body, and all their functions. Based on a thesis derived to best fit experimental results by Ruth nnd others, Popp postulates that biological systems generally have the capacity to store coherent photons that come from the external world. In other words, the biosystem is open to environmental commu- nication and exchange."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"229 Extraordinary Biology He has shown that the cell population is in a quasistationary state that is far away from thermodynamic equilibrium, as pointed out by Ilya Prigogine. Popp also concludes from his analysis that ultraweak photon emission within biological systems can influence chemical reactiv- ity. In fact, his analysis strongly implies that \"ultraweak\" photon intensity can regulate the whole cell metabolism and related phe- nomena. The cell takes up photons from external radiation. This includes both \"observable\" photons and \"virtual\" photons. Since it stores virtual photons, it stores charge, or biopotential changes. Since its stored virtual photons may be coherent virtual photons, it effectively \"polarizes\" or structures its stored photon charge, hence its biopoten- tial. The cell emits \"spillage\" photons — both coherent and incoher- ent — from its stored potential. Although Popp only uses conventional \"unstructured\" photons in his analysis, he shows that, at the molecular level, there is a stationary equilibrium, as far as photon storage and emission are concerned, between the molecular photon traps, the cell population, and the external world. It follows that coherent photon/charge inception from the exter- nal world can directly and precisely influence the cell's biopotential, hence its functioning and control, by information input. Incoherent photon inception, on the other hand, can only grossly affect the cell, such as by heating or sporadic effects. In his \"Photon Storage in Biological Systems,\" Popp points out the master cellular communication and control system as follows: \"The photons which we have measured can be seen as a sort of \"waste\" from a virtual electromagnetic field with a high coherence. This field has a tendency to become stationary over the whole organism.\" After additional analysis, he adds: \"....Consequently, biological systems must exhibit 'holographic' properties to an extremely high degree. The successful trials in"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 230 finding 'pictures' of various organs in each other organ, such as the ear, the hands, the eyes (acupuncture, iris diagnosis) support these conclusions. Our assumption that the entire genetic information of the DNA is stationarily delocalized over the body in form of genons may be seen as a further striking example.\" \"From this we can easily deduce that pattern recognition, as, for example, repair mechanisms and immunity, depends finally on the coherence of the photon field within the body.\" Finally, Popp states a most important conclusion: \"...In medicine new aspects have developed, and not only for cancer problems. Diseases in general can possibly be understood in terms of electromagnetic interactions within the organism.\" Scalar EM Comment on Popp's Communication System Popp and his colleagues have produced most important work and results indeed. They only need to add the impact of the zero- summed/multiplied electromagnetics (electrogravitation). As we cover in this book, the biopotential of the cell is rooted in the nuclei of the atoms of the cell's constituent materials. To be sure, every internal physical structure of the cell correspondingly \"levels\" and structures the biopotential. The overall cellular communication system is actually the exchange of \"leakage\" photons — both observ- able and virtual — throughout the overall biopotential of the organ- ism. Further, going beyond Popp's work, both the biopotential and the leakage photons have extensive, complex internal substruc- tures. Leakage and intercommunication occurs laterally at all levels of the biopotential, and vertically among cells and substructures. The master cellular control system's primary electrical conduc- tivity path is not through the electron shells of the atoms, but is through the nuclei-to-nuclei scalar EM \"biopotential levels\" path- way. With scalar EM methods, organized signals (signals with spe- cific internal nonzero vector EM waves, but which externally sum to z ero vector resultant E and H fields) can be constructed for essen-"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"231 Extraordinary Biology tially any specific purpose. This includes \"killing\" a cancer or leukemia cell, destroying a virus, changing the DNA, etc. This approach can directly reach and manipulate all immune and repair system functions. The entire biochemistry and functioning of the cell — including its genetics — is totally engineerable. The Soviets have long known this, and have long since done it. Further, a specific \"charge pattern\" of desired specific immunity (antibodies, etc.) can be designed and used to \"charge up\" the nuclei of the biosystem. This charge is then maintained by the system to provide permanent immunity. Thus one can develop, for example, an \"electromagnetic innoculation\" for AIDS, one for cancers and leukemias, etc. Since the cellular control system is holographic, the \"charge pattern\" of immunity resides in every cell, including the blood cells. Injecting a drop of blood from a scalarly immunized animal into another non-immune animal carries the scalar EM immunity pat- tern into the new animal. That charge diffuses throughout the overall biopotential of the organism, and the charge pattern acti- vates the animal's immune system, including causing it to produce antibodies — according to the EM-transferred antibody template. Antoine Priore demonstrated this effect numerous times. Thin was one of the great mysteries that confounded the orthodox mem- bers of the French Academy of Sciences. The French Academy did not know of scalar electromagnetics, the cellular biopotential rooted in atomic nuclei of the cellular material, the cytopathogenic effect of mitogenetic radiation from diseased and dying cells, phase conjugation, and phase conjugated electromagnetic healing. It is little wonder they did not comprehend the operational healing mechanism of the Bordeaux cancer-curing machine of Anto- ine Priore! A New View of the Nature of Mind and Thought The reason that Western science has not discovered what mind and thought are is simple: They have only built instruments and tools to look where the mind and thought are not to be found."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 232 Let's look where they are to be found. For example, consider the ionic discharges in and across the tremendous numbers of synapses of the human nervous system, and the slower discharge and migration of ions across cellular mem- branes, etc. Considered as a single biological ensemble, these are much like a vast array of continual and continuing spark discharge vectors, slow charge current vectors, etc. Overall, within the macroscopic space occupied by the body, these electromagnetic vectors sum almost entirely to a zero vector resultant. Only a tiny nonzero vector residue remains. However, this vector zero summation has incredibly rich in- folded signals, channels, and dynamic relationships (structure) within it. Modern science/medicine measures the small nonzero electro- magnetic residue (the remaining weak E and H fields) and tries to ascertain where and how mind and thought are accomplished, by studying that residue. However, the residue E and H field remainders are simply the \"garbage thrown out\" of the glorious engines dynamically operating inside the vector zero summations (and multiplications). The E and H field residues are the wastes or exhaust by- products. They are not the functions of the mind/thought process itself; instead, they are the spillage or leakage from those functions. Take a \"frozen time\" snapshot of the components of the zero vector summation. Regard the highly complex, infolded structure or pattern these components form. Now take a second \"frozen time\" snapshot of the components of the zero vector summation, a very, very short time later. Subtract the previous \"frozen pattern\" from this second \"frozen pattern.\"* The difference or \"delta\" between the two patterns represents a myriad of thoughts, hence it represents the contents of the \"thinking mind,\" in the most general sense. The \"mind\" is the overall functioning and changing of the entire pattern's substructure, and the ability of an organism to have such and do such.

Rife's microscope, for example, could reveal some of these levels; using evanescent waves, it could resolve some 16 ever-deeper levels of dynamic energy structure. Everything driving the component vectors themselves is higher dimensional. \"A thought\" is the exact change of a localized pattern (localized Figure 76. Hyperframes, vacuum, virtual state, minds and thoughts. zero vector summation whose components are changing but remain ing zero summed) from one moment to the next. Thought is always a pattern change, of the components inside an EM vector zero summation. Most thoughts are totally \"unconscious\" (multiple simultaneous"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 234 or \"parallel\" thoughts). A few are conscious (serially ordered, singularly considered and processed). The unconscious mind is totally a parallel processor (many things/thoughts at once). The conscious mind is totally a serial processor (only one thing/ thought at a time). Most persons never take the time and trouble to reflect and notice that, consciously, they only can perceive one single thing at a time. Of course, the conscious mind is so rapid that by habit they assume they can perceive many things at once. Since the conscious mind cannot discriminate the \"multiple images in the slide projector at once\" of the unconscious mind, that's what makes it unable to \"be conscious\" of the contents of the \"unconscious.\" In fact, the unconscious mind is totally conscious — it's just multiply conscious \"simultaneously.\" (Which sheds some inter- esting light on why one can develop multiple personalities, for instance). When the conscious mind \"regards\" the unconscious contents, it sees \"something\" which has \"multiple meanings at once.\" That's what we call symbolic. A symbol is something which can have many meanings at once. That's why the unconscious content always \"symbolizes\" some- thing when it's trying to communicate to the conscious mind. It's necessary to interpret the symbols to understand what the message being communicated is. That's why dreams, for instance, are symbolic. And why it usually takes a trained psychiatrist or psychologist to properly interpret the symbolic representations manifested in mental disor- der, and get at the underlying cause being symbolized. With deliberately constructed scalar EM, any or all of the conscious/unconscious portions of the mind can be available for engineering and control/change.

Unfortunately, Lisitsyn's work reveals that the Soviet Union has long since applied energetics (scalar electromagnetics) to mind control and mind engineering, including deciphering the genetic code operation. Controlled induction of images and sensations inside the brain — where they are processed as if self-originated — has been reported by the Soviets. Indeed, they have reported being able to control whether or not the induced material should rise to conscious awareness, as well as when it should rise to consciousness. For years, U.S. intelligence analysts and U.S. scientists simply did not believe that electromagnetic signals could directly influence consciousness. However, they were forced to reevaluate that position when a Soviet medical machine — the LIDA device — was openly obtained and evaluated. The LIDA machine — a small unit somewhat larger than a briefcase — has been used in Soviet medical facilities to treat humans for decades. The device uses a 40 megahertz EM carrier and very complex waveforms (signal modulations with complex mixtures of frequen- cies, phases, etc.) When exposed to it, a person is caused to gradually fall into a trance-like, catatonic-like state within a few minutes. That person becomes very still and very quiet. It was reported that the machine was tested upon a cat and had the same effect upon it. One American scientist stated that the device had actually been used in North Korean \"brainwashing\" of U.S. prisoners of war in the early 1950's during the Korean War!

But to return to the brain activity, with its innumerable, zero- summed minute EM vectors, and its extremely rich and complex deterministic substructure. Note that the ensemble of sum-zeroed vectors forms potentials. These potentials — i.e., the scalar EM — penetrate to the atomic nuclei in the brain and body. Internal changes in the potentials' substructures (i.e., thoughts) also penetrate to the nuclei. The nuclei continually \"charge up\" (the particles change their states) to these impressed potentials, including the \"potential\" or \"charge\" of each component of the impressed potential. That is, the nuclei charge up with both dynamic overall potential (mind) and thought (individual substructure changes). Notice that mind, thought, and memory reside in, and are recorded in, the atomic nuclei. At many virtual state levels. In many hyperdimensions. Thus the functioning mind and bio-control systems — including Popp's master cellular communication system, the immune control system, the acquisition control system, and the repair control system - all \"reside\" in the nuclei as dynamically interacting, patterned potentials or \"patterned charge,\" complete with resonances and frequencies, etc. We can regard the mind and its interactions as physical, in the extended sense we have briefly developed here. Everything \"mental\" can be directly interfaced with and engineered.

We can, for example, transmute the nucleus into another form. Here an isomer form is the easiest. An isomer for an atomic nucleus (a specific isotope) has the same number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) overall as that isotope does, but a different number of protons. So it's a different element, but very specially related to its isomeric \"brother.\" All that it takes to change a neutron into a proton or vice versa, is to \"flip\" a single quark (subparticle of the nucleon). Living systems can do that and transmute elements, to a small degree. For example, living systems must use phase conjugation, nega- tive time, and negative energy. To do so, they must function nonlinearly. That is the only way they can defeat the otherwise inexorable second law of thermodynamics: that all (linear) processes continue to more and more disorder as time passes. (That's called \"increasing the entropy (disorder).\" Unless a biosystem could defeat that law, its genetic pattern would inevitably be disordered in a few generations, and the species would disappear. By using phase conjugation and time reversal, the living system is able to reverse the law of entropy in its time- reversed channel. That is, in that channel things go in reverse: fro m disorder back to order! That's called \"negative entropy\" or negentropy\" for short.* It follows a priori that, to do this, the living system of necessity possesses phase conjugate energy systems (negative energy, nega- tive lime systems) that are rooted in the atomic nuclei of its body.

If the system deliberately utilizes and manipulates phase conjugate energy/time in its atomic nuclei, it is a living system. If it does not deliberately use this, it is an inert or nonliving system. For example, this sheds a great deal of light on the nature of a virus. A virus is a single molecule. Ordinarily it clouds the distinction between life and death. Viruses can be crystalized out of solution, formed into \"rock-like\" crystals, and placed on the shelf, so to speak. There they can remain for many years or centuries, seemingly an inert rock. Then when placed back into their \"preferred medium,\" so to speak, the virus crystals dissolve, separate, and \"come back to life\" and resume their living function. Yet the virus can be killed, in which case it is just a \"hunk of rock,\" sitting on the shelf. In that case, it won't come back to life when placed back into its preferred medium. In one case its \"deterministic phase conjugate energy system\" — its mind, to put it simply — remained in the nuclei of the atoms of the crystaline form. In the other case its \"mind\" was destroyed or disconnected from the crystalline form.* A somewhat similar effect can be demonstrated in bacteria. You can \"kill\" bacteria, for example, with UV radiation, then hold them in the dark for 24 hours (say, for 12 generations, since a nominal bacterial generation is about 2 hours.) They will remain absolutely \"lifeless\" and static, with no movement or cell division. Then if you place them in the sunlight, you will be astounded to see them revive by the hundreds of thousands. In the \"special kill\" case here, the virtual state substructure of the UV photons just totally \"jammed\" the biopotential substructure functioning of the *In the living case, the atomic nuclei remained patterned by the structured biopotential In the case of true death, the structured biopotential is lost and the nuclei revert to their \"inert\" form."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 246 \"minds\" of the bacteria on one key channel. It didn't physically damage their bodies or \"physical tuners.\" Then when placed in the sunlight, the broad frequency spectrum of the virtual substructure of the photons \"dithered\" and stimulated the bacteria's body-tuners, much like a \"frequency massage\" in all the bands. This set the physical tuners vibrating — and therefore responding once again to the biopotential substructure changes of the mind. Hence the bacteria \"revived\" and swam about — fat, dumb, and happy. We have stated that the mind is a physical thing, albeit a virtual or hyperspatial thing.

We accent that this is not mysticism, but physics. But now let us return to phase conjugation and the Priore machine. The Priore Machine and Phase Conjugation In the 1960's and 1970's, in France Antoine Priore built and tested electromagnetic healing machines of startling effectiveness. In hundreds and hundreds of rigorous tests with laboratory animals, Priore's machine cured a wide variety of the most difficult kinds of terminal, fatal diseases known today. Funded by the French government in the amount of several million dollars, Priore's machines concretely demonstrated a nearly 100% cure of all kinds of terminal cancers and leuke- mias, in thousands of rigorous laboratory tests with animals. These results were shown to medical scientists as early as 1960. Many of the experiments and tests were done by prestigious members of the French Academy of Sciences. Robert Courrier, head of the Biology Section and Secretaire Perpetuel, personally intro- duced Priore's astounding results to the French Academy. The operation of the Priore machine was seemingly incompre- hensible. Many orthodox French scientists — some of them world renowned — were outraged at the success of such a machine, shrilling that science had nothing to do with \"black boxes.\" They loudly called upon the inventor to explain the mechanism utilized by his machine, but the inventor either wouldn't or couldn't, explain the curative mechanism. Priore certainly knew how to build the machine and make it"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 248 work. It is debatable to this day whether anyone — Priore included — actually understood its principle of operation. Neither the French Academy nor Antoine Priore knew anything of phase conjugation at the time. In fact, the entire Western World knew nothing of phase conju- gation in the 1960's when Priore was getting his finest results. At that time, only the Soviets knew of time-reversed waves. Certainly Priore's machine was impressive. Into a tube containing a plasma of mercury and neon gas, a pulsed 9.4 gigahertz wave modulated upon a carrier frequency of 17 megahertz was introduced. These waves were produced by radio emitters and magnetrons in the presence of a 1,000 gauss magnetic field. Experimental animals were exposed to this magnetic field during irradiation, and the mixture of waves (some 17 or so) coming from the plasma tube and modulating and riding the magnetic field passed through the animals' bodies. Amongst other things, a plasma can convert a transverse wave to a longitudinal wave. Also, phase conjugate (time-reversed) waves Figure 89. One of Priore's intermediate devices.

Priore's apparatus produced a scalar EM wave/signal with deliberately constructed, infolded components including phase conjugate waves. One may roughly view a cancer cell as a normal human cell gone \"awry\" and out of control of the body's master cellular control system. The cancerous cells, viewed as a sort of separate, parasitic group of cells, form a special kind of organism having its own master cellular control system \"level,\" immersed in the host's biopotential.* There is thus a specific, constant electromagnetic \"delta\" that differentiates the parasitic cancerous \"organism\" from the normal human cellular organism. This \"delta\" can be considered a sort of constant, complex- structured charge existing in the body's atomic nuclei. It's exactly as if the body biopotential had been charged up by Kaznacheyev's \"death photons\" for that specific cancer condition. If this cancerous \"delta\" (which may be rather like a complex intermodulation mix of waves) — or a frequency shifted \"transform\" of it to a different frequency band — is phase conjugated, a specific healing delta frequency pattern results. If phase conjugate replicas of a cancer's cell's specific \"delta\" frequencies are fed into the body having that cancer, the deviation of the cancer cell's master cellular control system will be \"time- reversed.\" That will return the cancer cell to control of the animal's proper master cellular control system. The cancerous cell will be immedi- ately destroyed, or reverted back to a normal cell of the animal. A very similar process exists for just about every disease bacte- rium and infectious agent that attacks the body. Phase Conjugates of \"Death Photons\" are \"Healing Photons\" The Kaznacheyev experiments in the Soviet Union proved that, any cellular death and disease pattern can be induced by a specific electromagnetic pattern carried on an electromagnetic signal, if the *One strongly points out the relevance of Dr. Robert Becker's epochal experiments proving that cells can be dedifferentiated and redifferentiated electrically.

In simplified terms, if an action in forward time induces a condition, then the time-reversal of that action will reverse the condition. The concept is almost laughably simple. The time-reversal of an electromagnetic disease process is a specific healing process for that disease. In his device, Priore internally structured the carrier photons themselves — making them vacuum engines. He phase conju- gated his vacuum engines, and then passed these time-reversed vacuum engines down and through a strong magnetic field which thoroughly penetrated all cells of the biological organism being treated. The scalar components (structured photons) representing the time-reversal of the disease were absorbed and reradiated in all the cells, \"charging up\" the nuclei of the atoms in the organism to some potential level of the exact \"healing and reversing pattern.\" In the process, the cancer/leukemia pattern/charge also de- stroyed the cancer cells, or converted them back to normal cells as appropriate. As a highly simplified analogy, the complex signal — viewed as a scalar Fourier expansion — represented a \"stress\" against any abnormal cellular control system encountered and returned it to the normal cell's master cellular control system of the body. Encountering the normal control system in normal cells, it produced zero stress. Encountering the abnormal control system in tumerous cells, it produced great stress on it, reverting it to the normal control system of the body's normal cells. Thus to a normal cell the Priore signal pattern acted somewhat as a comb passing through one's hair."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"251 Extraordinary Biology No interference occurred with the normal cell (one whose scalar control pattern is phase-locked to the body's master cellular control system and in phase with it). The Priore signal stimulated and \"stroked\" the normal cell, but did not hurt it at all. On the other hand, the scalar control pattern in and of an abnormal (cancerous) cell is out of phase with the body's master cellular control system, and is not phase-locked to it. Hence the Priore signal caused direct interference with the abnormal cell's independent scalar control system. The interference pattern constituted the reconstruction of normal energy directly in the cancerous cell, and also jammed its abnormal scalar life signal. This destroyed the cancerous cell by two mechanisms: (1) physical energy was kindled directly in the abnormal cell, causing direct mechanical damage, and (2) the cancerous cell, being an \"independent living critter,\" had its scalar life channel (connecting its primitive \"mind\" to its \"body\") jammed and stopped. If the cancerous cell was reverted to a normal cell by the Priore stress before being destroyed, it became just a normal cell and the Priore stress had no further effect upon it. The Effect is Universally Applicable Any disease with cellular, biochemical, or genetic basis can be cured in like fashion. Priore's method, for example, was clearly shown to be able to completely reverse clogging of the arteries with fatty deposits, and to be able to lower the cholesterol level to normal, even in the presence of an abnormally high cholesterol diet. His method also showed complete mastery and cure of sleeping sickness and trypanosome-induced illnesses. Often Priore found that every cell of the body — even the hair — must be irradiated and treated (\"charged up\") with the signal, for the disease pattern was in every cell. The master cellular control system is holographic — the pattern (substructured potential with its dynamic, oscillating components) is in each component (each atomic nucleus, hence in each cell.) Every structural level of the body larger than the cell also has its"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 252 own correlated pattern, or modulation, on the overall. A biological organism can regenerate lost limbs, for example, if it can utilize its natural recovery process in a Priore manner. Even though Priore's work was presented to the French Acad- emy of Sciences by Robert Courrier, the prestigious head of the Biology Section, the Academy could not understand the device and its functioning. That was because the Academicians knew nothing of scalar electromagnetics, and phase conjugation, and the Priore machine was a scalar electromagnetic device using phase conjugation. In the Mid-70's It Ended In 1974, a change of local government lost Priore his government supporters. His support and funding were lost. Ironically, Priore was just completing a 4-stories-tall apparatus capable of radiating and treating entire human bodies. It would have been capable of curing cancer and leukemia in humans rather than just in laboratory rats. (His previous machines were much Figure 90.

In that machine Priore used a \"lamp,\" a special section, in which 17 specific frequencies were mixed and modulated upon the 9.4 gigahertz carrier. The machine was large enough to irradiate humans over their whole body. It should have been capable of curing cancer and leukemia in two five-minute irradiations, one week apart. While Priore was still alive, with my associates I spent nearly two years of my life in an effort to bring the Priore device to market and into the mainstream of medical research and development. Robert Whitney, Frank Golden, and Tony Gideon played the major role, going to France and negotiating directly with the Priore group and the French government. Verbal agreements with both the Priore group and with the French government were obtained. The machines were to be built, assembled, and tested in Bordeaux. Then they were to be dismantled and shipped to the purchasers — large medical research and devel- opment laboratories where they would be reassembled on site."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 254 A group of wealthy backers was going to provide the necessary millions to fund the effort. Final contracts were being drawn. Mysteriously, all funding for the project was suddenly with- drawn. Our backers were \"leaned on\" very hard and strongly threatened. Nothing we could do could revive the project. Priore never again recovered his funding, and later died. The machine fell into disarray and was disassembled. However, the proof that the requisite time-reversed signal can be produced, and will ride down a magnetic field, to penetrate every cell and every atomic nucleus in the body, is already in the present hard-core physics literature, if one knows where to look and how to properly interpret the work. The fact that such signals can reverse nearly every major cellular illness condition of the body also has been proven by Priore and the scientists who worked with him, and it is in the French scientific literature. The Priore-type cure for AIDS and other diseases only requires the necessary funding and personnel to be redeveloped and re- established. Work of Australians Reed and Barsamian, and the American G. Wilbanks At the University of Sydney, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, some magnificent work of great importance to our thesis has been accomplished. Indeed, this Australian research may well be some of the most important work going on in the Western world today. Dr. B. L. Reid, Dr. S. Barsamian, and their colleagues have produced experimental studies that positively verify pattern and form transmission at a distance, even through Faraday shielding. They have directly shown the reaction to, and results of, an unex- plored information field on both living cells and inert crystalline matter. In addition, they have replicated — and extended — the pub- lished results of Kaznacheyev on the cytopathogenic effect. In fact, they have obtained the effect at over 100 meters."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"255 Extraordinary Biology This shows, of course, that the effect is not just mesoscopic, but also macroscopic. Whether we like it or not, structural patterns of cellular disease can positively be transmitted electromagnetically, and kindled in target cell structures at a distance. Dr. Reid has been interested in the origins of cancer since at least 1958. After much work in the standard models, by the late 1970's he was convinced that the present approach of medical science is wrong. He reasoned that we should pay stricter attention to the nature of growth before examining new growth, i.e., cancer. Growth, of course, is creation — and so the problem became, what is creation? As a metaphor for biological growth to work with, he and his colleagues chose the growth of crystals. With keen foresight and intuition, they directed their inquiry so as to expose the complicity of some force — if any — external to solute and solvent. Their work began to show that such a force existed, and it was a type that was unaffected by interposition of a Faraday cage. In other words, it was not a conventional electrical force.* Dr. Reid and his colleagues then included biological subjects in the form of living cells. They were familiar with Kaznacheyev's work in Alma Ata, Kazakstan on the subject of long range transmission of pathological (viral) effects on cells. In addition, they were familiar with the seminal studies of Gurwitsch on transmissions by onion roots cells, in the 1920's. Most of their basic studies on the nature of the new force, however, were made with common salt, drying from aqueous solu- tion, Some of their major results were as follows: 1. The familiar cubic symmetry is altered toward a higher energy form of dendrite crystals when biopolymers such as protein are included in the solvent. 2. A mass of lead 12-20 kg in the crystal space (up to 1 meter distant) causes an interference pattern in the salt crystal display. 3. A prospective dendrite pattern is not realized when a prospec- tive cubic-pattern of the salt is dried in the local space (up to \"For one related possible scalar EM (electrogravitation) interaction, see Ya. B. Zel'dovich, \"Electromagnetic current and charge due to interaction between a gravitational and a free electromagnetic field,\" J. Exper. and Elec. Phy.

The latter by its presence in space is able to prevent the dendrite expression and enhance the cubic symmetry expression. A photograph of crystals of cubic symmetry when moved by a vibrating holder (2 cps) has the same effect on the real crystals drying from the solvent. 4. Dendrite forms of salt crystal result when certain chemical reactions involving proton or ion movement occur up to 30 meters away, separated by brick walls, glass, etc. These reactions were detailed by Dr. Reid and his colleagues. If the mother solution is examined by ac capacitance on a sensitive bridge, variations in capacitance of over 300% accompany the receipt of the signal. 5. If such a transmission from 30 meters distance is regarded as a carrier wave which is modulated by a foreign — and thus detectable — chemical, the chemical can be detected in the distant atmosphere some 3 months later in the form of a discrete or adiabatic 'cloud' which contaminates sodium chloride drying at the same time. In this way, copper sulfate dissolved at a site A in June 1985 could be repeatably detected at site B, 30 meters distant and separated by walls, screens etc., by a drying solution of sodium chloride solution in September 1985. Serial dryings of the sodium chloride solution on glass slides showed that each day, the cloud hovered over a space of 1-2 cm at the end of a venturi tube for several hours before 3 p.m., and then moved off at 1 meter per hour in a NW direction. The copper content of the cloud was discernible by crystal structure and chemical means from the adjacent sodium chloride. 6. All of the above crystal forms required ambient oxygen for their manifestation. Atmospheres of nitrogen and argon prevented their display. At the time, the researchers sus- pected that the effects may have been carried by orbital electrons of oxygen showing unpaired spin which had inter- changed with electrons of the copper solution. They then"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"257 Extraordinary Biology developed an information-carrying device which could 'infect' the electron cloud of a target molecule sufficient for the chemical display of properties of the infecting electron's parent atom. This concept seemed to explain the experiment of the following paragraph. 7. Two beakers of sodium chloride solution were connected in series with a small voltage source (say a 1.5V dry cell) to provide a transfer of electrons through each beaker. The second beaker in series was sampled for subsequent drying and display of the crystal form. A crystal form of cubic symmetry resulted. When the solvent of the first beaker was altered by the addition of a protein solution (such as albumen or globulin), the crystal pattern of the second beaker was altered from cubic to dendrite pattern as though protein were present in the second solution. 8. During attempts to stabilize salt crystals on glass by means of thin plastic films drying from appropriate solvents (in order to stain the salt with aqueous solutions of dyestuff), it was discovered by chance that the crystalizing process is accompa- nied by structural patterns on the plastic film so exposed. These patterns were of two major types: (a) vortices, or spirals in the film plane, of 0.1 to 1.0 mm diameter, and (b) smaller curled structures into which the spiral could be seen to merge or grade. From a concurrent mathematical study of vorticeal interaction as designed by Barsamian, the similarity of the curl structures in plastic films (the researchers usually used 0.25% polystyrene in benzol) to computer simulations of vor- ticeal vectors was shown to be remarkable. 9. The researchers then dispensed with the underlying crystals and exposed the drying polymer film to a variety of spaces where the field, thought to be responsible for many of these tele-effects, was operative. With this technical advance, the team has made rapid progress over the last year or so. They have come to have a more comprehensive grasp of the ether"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 258 field than was possible by less direct methods involving forma- tion of crystals. 10. On the biological side, they repeated the Russian studies done at Alma Ata with transmission of the cytopathogenic effect of viruses on animal cells. They used the cytopathogenic effect of colchicine and its relative vinblastine on cells with the follow- ing differences from the published Russian work: (a) The effect can be transmitted at least 100 meters between campus buildings, (b) it is not necessary to use a magnetic field for the propagation, (c) it is not necessary to use quartz vessels; glass is quite effective. These experiments came to the attention of a colleague, Dr. G. Wilbanks, Head, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical School, University of Chicago in 1983. Dr. Wilbanks was able to repeat them with similar results. However, in a more faithful copy of the Russian experiments, he used quartz vessels with cells placed in a magnetic field, with the vessels separated by no more than 1 mm. Both the Australian researchers and Dr. Wilbanks shared another thing in common: their uniform inability to interest the editors of several scientific journals such as Science, Nature, Naturewissenchaften, and others in publishing papers describing these fundamental experiments and results. 11. Experience with interference of a lead mass in the crystal work prompted the use of several metals in the ambient field of growing cells. Only lead (and to a lesser extent tin) showed the following properties: (a) Cell growth with 0.5-5 Kg lead in the ambient field is depressed sometimes to one third normal, (b) The cells die (dye exclusion test) but then can be revived by placing a small bar magnet in the local space with its poles in an E-W orientation. At least in Sydney, a N-S orientation of the bar magnet does not revive the stricken cells. 12. The effects of energy flowing through living matter have been documented by Kirlian's method. It was therefore of interest"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"259 Extraordinary Biology to the Australian researchers to expose living systems to drying films of polystyrene. They found that the staining properties of the ambient-derived image on plastic films par- allel those of the real organism. 13. By appropriate use of an imposed potential on living cells, it proved possible to match the field strength and show the actual imposition of the ambient (scalar) field on the bio- polymer content of the material during the permeation proc- ess. The traces obtained are not unlike noise and would be so regarded by the casual investigator. The design of this appa- ratus and associated experiments was the work of Dr. Bar- samian. Concepts of Dr. Reid and Associates Dr. Reid has kindly shared with me some of the concepts he and his colleagues have formulated. These concepts, it is stressed, are consonant with direct physical results they have obtained in the laboratory. Note that any errors in this explanation are strictly the fault of this author, and not of Dr. Reid and his colleagues. 1. Matter is bathed in an energy sea familiar to quantum theo- rists. The Australian team prefers to call this sea of energy ether, as a relatively bland term, perhaps in a way to rescue it from the oblivion where Einstein banished it. The key to the silence of this sea is its \"fractional-charge\" charged particle status and low energy values. The former conceals it from physics, while the latter conceals it from chemistry and th- ermodynamics. 2. The differing energy levels of this sea, combined with its enduring motion, are theoretically and practically best ex- pressed as a vortex. Dr. Reid and associates have detailed this theory to explain the creativity of biology. The incipient creativity of the vortex is given material expression by its association (as part of the EM field) with an electron which it"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 260 now endows with equivalent novel properties. There is no intuitive reason why the energetic rearrangements of the electron cloud cannot proceed to the nucleus, there to set up a quark or proton rearrangement — or, as the quantum theorist would say, a virtual particle exchange — leading to transmu- tation. Kervran's work on biological transmutations is rele- vant; the literature of such effects goes back to 1798 at least! The team suspects that some such mechanism may underlie their experimental result of the transition of sodium to copper. 3. A further prime property of vorticeal interaction is its proclivity for amplification, wherein the atomic-size vor- tex can be built up to the meteorological hurricane by such adherence or affinity. The team has noted the affinity of ambient field vortices to those produced by an electric current in a metallic conductor, with particular reference to the ill- defined boundary between the two. This parasitism was the reason behind the team's use of \"carrier waves\" from chemical reactions as transporters of fields whose identity of origin were sufficiently specific to trace the field subsequently. It is at least conceivable that the whole process could be amplified and used to parasitize (modulate) a radar beam as carrier. The affinity property of fields may be exhibited by the experience of mariners with what they loosely term \"magnetic phenom- ena\" thought to be derived from luminescent plankton. In the South China and Arabian Gulf seas, giant \"wheels\" of light, 5- 15 km in diameter and containing spiraling spokes, revolve about the ship at night, reversing their direction of rotation as they pass the midpoint of the vessel. The key observation in the context of the field affinity concept is that the luminescence is manifoldly enhanced when the ship's radar is switched on. There could thus exist a chain, scalar-EM/plankton-optical, the first leg (scalar EM) of which can be amplified by radar EM. 4. The property of affinity means that a scalar field's trans- form or copy, of the energy disposition imposed on it by the experience of matter last permeated, may persist as"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"261 Extraordinary Biology a memory in space, as many of the Australian observations attest. The team found that recall was not all that difficult technically. The energy transform for copper sulfate existing as a non-dissipated cloud with marked adi- abatic properties could be recalled five months after its formation. There is no reason why informationally more elaborate spatial configurations of energy, in- cluding human thoughts, will not behave in precisely the same way. The cell nucleus could conceivably be the candidate for the first site for storage of such energy. The nucleus has a highly ordered structure and an associated high permittivity, and this would make it a real target. In the human subject, there is experimental evidence that the mon- goloid polymer constitution will have a higher activity for storage of the ambient field than will the Caucasian. Other Important Ideas Dr. Reid also shared other important insights: Lavoisier in 1748 advanced the concept that matter itself (chemicals) is inert. The activity of all chemicals, according to Lavoisier, resided in their associated ether — and God sent the ether! Taken to its limit, this suggests that the source of the energy which we call thought is a property of the scalar field. Matter (say, the nervous system) interacting with these fields, would be inca- pable of discerning the source of the field as presented, whether of self or external origin. In his book Hidden Variables in Quantum Theory, Dr. David Bohm felt that in 'elevating' (his word) matter (as particles) from the sea, it might be possible to consider the idea as containing even more elaborate energy transforms such as biological shapes, these trans- forms themselves undergoing metamorphosis. [Comment by this author: Rife's microscope, using evanescent waves, actually allowed one to directly see and photograph such forms, proving the thesis.] The ability of the Australian researchers to rescue these trans- forms on films together with evidence that they could be seeing the results of the exclusively space interaction of virtual forms (say"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 262 microbe and antibiotic), is also a direct technical step toward validat- ing Bohm's important idea. Wider Implications of Structured Field Information As T.D. Lee points out in his important book, Particle Physics and Introduction to Field Theory, particle physicists have not attempted to use the structure of the vacuum nor the structure of potentials. Dr. Barsamian has shared other wider implications of the structured ether. Over the ages a phenomenon which, as discussed, can have no representation in real (that is, electromagnetic or thermodynamic) terms can hardly have been thought of as possessing specific struc- ture or function. Instead, it signaled its undoubted presence to generations of philosophers and physicists before Einstein, solely through statistical effects. The writings of Helmholtz, James Clerk Maxwell, and Neils Bohr are examples. The more recent Dirac and Fermi statistics are a continuation of the process. If an alternative definition of science is the continuing refine- ment of that which we partially knew or took for granted, then the refinement of these statistical approaches ~ with their obligatory uncertainty as defined by Heisenberg — is a worthy goal. In this sense, a more articulate description of the anatomy of the field is a logical progression from the beginnings of the ether concept in Classical Greece through to the statistics of the nineteenth to the early twentieth century. A hundred years ago, this orderly progression even reached the concept of a vorticeal atom at the hands of J. J. Thompson. However, i t was interrupted very effectively by Einstein's publication of the special theory of relativity. Einstein was fortunate in that he had chosen for his mathemat- ics a pivotal feature of the ether field, its elasticity. The mathematics of elasticity had been evolving — through the developments of Hooke, Young, invariance, and the calculus — to handle its histori- cally increasing complexity (by tensors). This mathematics of elasticity was then available to Einstein. The wisdom of this choice"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"263 Extraordinary Biology was vindicated by the remarkable special relativity predictions which were born out in subsequent observation and experiment. There was seemingly no need to suspect, let alone probe, any special properties of the medium underlying the mathematics.* The success of these predictions effectively blocked any chance of a return to the ether field concept. Indeed, it was seen as an arrogance to despoil the \"elegance\" of the mathematics. Nor was the success of quantum mechanics — the other leg of the Western World statistical approach to the nature of reality — able to get the physicists to heed Bohm's 1958 ideas on the hidden variables in its fabric or Dirac's 1952 ideas on a lesser uncertainty of the particle- field relationship than Heisenberg had formulated. Recently Dr. Barsamian has originated the concept of an aliena- tion of the electron from its field. The full expression of this could see the field so alienated that it is well-nigh autonomous, and some kind of fundamental entity in its own right. In this sense, the freed autonomous field — at least conceptually —could proceed with its creativity by hybridization with other fields and so return the product of these asides to the particle. In atoms of the next fragment of matter with which the particle then associates, this product could create novel properties derived from the inter- change. The multiple properties of such a field allow it to be resolved in EM (electrostatics and electrodynamics), in atomic structure (elec- trons and nucleons), and in pressure (gravity) terms. This univer- sality makes a new concept possible, long beloved of the GUT (Grand Unified Theory) theorists: that there is only one energy. It is also quite possible that this ubiquity need not be confined to physics. It may penetrate the biological imponderables of growth, new growth and consciousness. In view of the work of Dr. Reid and his associates, and other work — such as that of Hines and Chimonas showing atmospheric gravity waves launched by auroral currents — the prospect of amplification and transmission of transforms and patterns over long distances, *As, for example, whether or not the concept of an abstract vector space in vector mathematics must be modified to correspond to what we know about the vacuum medium.

Dr. Reid stated that it would be surprising if other laboratories outside Russia had not progressed as far, if not further, than he and his associates had. Obviously the lack of similar publication indi- cates the nearly impenetrable editorial curtain confronting Western researchers in this and related areas. Dr. Barsamian's Important Theoretical Insights Dr. Barsamian has formulated a theory in relation to the development of cancer that is of great importance. In his theory, he is developing the approach of classical mechan- ics to electromagnetic interactions between charged particles and between dipoles. The field associated with the primary moving particle is not neglected in his theory, and this part of it differs from Dirac's \"new electromagnetic theory.\" The field associated with the primary moving particle, in Dr. Barsamian's approach, is viewed as an important part of the particle's interactions. This field is stressed in the sense that diverse phenomena — from Maxwell's EM field radiating from the remotest regions of the universe to the controlled charge flow in the matter medium — are viewed as manifestations of EM forces. This of course is unlike the traditional relativity view of EM force action on moving charges. In Dr. Barsamian's view, the potential vectors (derived by a reatment from fluid mechanics theory) form an EM field and are positioned on a vortex curve. All parameters of such a field can be treated mathematically, and Dr. Barsamian has one or more papers presently in publication. The duality of such potential vectors (gradients) is to conduct the motion of particles (which are always either charged or dipolar) appearing in nonmatter, which is taken as an incompressible contin- uum — the \"void.\" Because the final results of these forces are always movement of matter, Dr. Barsamian prefers not to classify them by their origin. Such a field may persist with great permanence. There are some limitations in summation (triplet conditions) and selectivity (perio- dicity) of the vortices themselves. Part of these limitations takes the"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"265 Extraordinary Biology form of particle characteristics. Presently he is rather sure that the formation of patterns of organic, inorganic and liquid crystals (typical to living biomatter) are partially responsive to the effect of the described field. Dr. Barsamian is attempting to synthesize his own experimen- tal findings on the dielectric behavior of biosystems as they enter the cancer process with the data that Dr. Reid is producing with respect to action at a distance. With respect to living systems, he has slowly been approaching the conclusion that existing physical laws are just not applicable concerning (1) entropy, or (2) energy breakdown, or (3) random collisions of particles in quantum terms, or (4) electron-ion ex- changes in bioelectrochemistry terms. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to find a referee who sincerely understands the related experiments and their underlying theory. This presents a nearly impene- trable barrier to publication in leading scientific journals. This is tragic, because these considerations and experimental results at least provide an entry into more fundamental experiments with present lethal diseases such as cancer and AIDS which annu- ally take large numbers of human lives. The present state of the art is telling everyone loud and clear that something fundamental is wrong with present theory, and that we should come to terms with more novel views. Comment by the present author: In his prophetic insights, Dr. Barsamian has placed his finger squarely on the fundamental struggle of living systems against the \"positive energy/time\" laws of present physics. In its struggle, the living system must use negative energy/time, to correct from disorder to order and provide the extra free energy to do so. Otherwise, the steady progress toward increas- ing disorder in all its actions, would very shortly reduce the living system to such a disordered state that it could no longer reproduce the clear genetic pattern of its own kind. We have already pointed out the hitherto unexpected role that phase conjugation plays in allowing the living system to violate and break the iron dictates of conservation, nontransmutation, entropy, and raw statistics. To live and survive, a living system must have access to other functional levels and other mechanisms beyond those contained in"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 266 our present physics, electromagnetics, and biochemistry. The incredibly productive and important work of Drs. Reid, Barsamian, and associates is of the utmost importance. Their work clearly moves everything in biochemistry and the knowledge of cellular functioning a major step forward. It is a betrayal of the scientific method that such vital work goes so largely unreported in the leading journals. Indeed, the work of these Australian scientists should be galvanized and well-staffed and funded. They can literally usher in a new science, given the chance to further exploit and develop their results. Royal Raymond Rife In the 1930's and 1940's, Royal Raymond Rife revolutionized everything that has been done before or since in high resolution optical microscopy. He also revolutionized everything before or since in cellular biology. He carried cellular structure far beyond anything ever dreamed of at the time or presently. He revealed the direct connec- tion between organized living energy forms and organized biological systems. He revealed that life itself is organized and dynamic, to a far finer level than anything in the textbooks today. He revealed that our present theory of disease is fundamentally very, very wrong. He produced direct, economical, electromagnetic cures of cancer, leukemia, and other such debilitating diseases. His work presages a future mankind could have had, where most debilitating diseases were quickly and economically corrected, and where no poisonous drugs, violent nuclear irradiation, and harsh chemotherapeutic \"burning\" of the patient would be necessary. For such epochal work, he was ostracized, essentially impris- oned in a medical treatment facility, broken, condemned, and re- jected by his peers. His findings, though printed in reputable publications and journals, were discredited and ridiculed. He literally was reduced to a non-person by the power of the medical cartel. Finally escaping from his enforced confinement, he lived out his remaining years and died quietly and unknown."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"267 Extraordinary Biology Rife's Universal Microscope With his universal microscope, Rife achieved optical resolution of up to 31,000 diameters and magnification up to 60,000 diameters. His microscope could examine living viruses, living bacteria, and other as-yet-undiscovered living organisms and living energy forms that no other microscope before or since could see. Even today, only the electron microscope furnishes such resolu- tion, and it zaps-to-death the objects that are being examined. Further, it will not at all detect or see the \"living energy forms\" revealed by Rife's microscope. To appreciate Rife's accomplishment, let's briefly summarize some of the performance factors of an optical microscope.* Several factors are important in the functioning of a microscope: Resolution, magnification, and contrast lead the list. By resolution we refer to the ability of the instrument to distin- guish a small object. In other words, something like looking at a medical doctor's eye chart, and specifying the smallest print one can clearly see. Resolution is often referred to as resolving power. By \"magnification\" or magnifying power we mean the ability of the instrument to \"blow up\" or enlarge the image produced. Roughly, it's the ratio of the apparent size of the object seen through the microscope to the apparent size of the same object seen without the instrument. Magnifying power is exactly like enlarging a photograph. It won't improve the resolution or make the photograph any clearer, but may make whatever was captured (resolved) easier for the human operator to see. If you just keep enlarging the photograph, it will get more and more grainy, until no further details can be seen with higher magnification. Contrast refers to the distinctness by which the various parts of the object can be distinguished from one another. To enhance contrast of objects under the microscope, staining of the objects is often used. Very often the act of staining will itself kill the living organisms — such as bacteria — that are being examined. *The electron microscope reveals only the \"dead carnage\" of the battlefield after everything is destroyed. With it, one is observing physical residuals, not the living players. For some encouraging modern work, however, see Michael Hercher, \"Virometer — an instrument for the measurement of the size of viruses using an optical microscope,\" SPIE Seminar Proc ., 1977, p. 17-22."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 268 Figure 92.

Or we may just simply and loosely speak of so many thousands of diameters. The resolution of an optical microscope depends upon the illumi- nation conditions, its optical system, and the fact that the object viewed diffracts and spreads the light. A wide variety of mechanisms for illuminating, resolving, contrasting, etc. are used in optical microscopes. According to standard Rayleigh theory, normal optical micro- scopes are limited in resolution to about half a wavelength. That corresponds to about 250 nanometers for visible light illumination. One can do a little better than that by using ultraviolet light and quartz optics. The UV has a higher frequency than visible light and hence a shorter wavelength. However, beyond 240 nanometers the resolution of an optical microscope quickly disappears. A few researchers — notably in the 30's and 40's — remarked about other factors, such as \"quality of the lenses,\" affecting resolu- tion. Some of them reported results to about a tenth of a wavelength. Loosely, that translated to somewhere in the order of 5,000 to 6,000 diameters. The dependable upper limit seemed to be — and still is — about 3,000 diameters, however. Normal optical microscopes simply are almost useless for trying to look at viruses. They will not resolve any but the very largest viruses, and will not resolve the internal features of even those few giants. Much of today's knowledge of virus structures and shapes comes from the use of electron microscopes. They bombard the object viewed with a fierce rain of energetic electrons. These instruments see nothing of the functioning of the virus, for they kill it instantly in trying to view it. With Rife's universal microscope, the dynamic living functions of the virus could be observed without killing it. With Rife's microscope, a whole range of complex organisms and structures below the size of bacteria was revealed. Many of these organisms are still not known to present science, even though some of them were written about at the time. Filterable forms of bacteria"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 272 — forms which readily passed through filters supposed to easily block their passage — were discovered and reported by Rife and his medical colleagues. In addition, Rife's microscope — which contained block-quartz prisms and lenses and interference stages — revealed halos around living organisms that other microscopes could not see, even though the object was within their resolving power. Further, it revealed the existence of entire organisms and forms which other microscopes could not see — even though, again, the size of the organisms was within their resolving power. In other words, Rife's microscope not only revealed smaller physical forms than any other microscope could see, but it also revealed sizeable \"living energy\" forms which no other microscope could see. Rife Proved That Everything Is Alive The degree of smallness to which Rife's microscope would re- solve, and the extraordinary energy forms it could detect, showed that direct detection of the virtual state organization of the living organism was accomplished by the instrument. The science of the day was only just groping its way toward any sort of physics that could explain such an astounding instrumental result. Today, however, in the hard-core literature there is demon- strated proof that the optical limit of resolution can be drastically overcome, using evanescent waves.* Shortly we will briefly give an \"ad hoc\" explanation of such evanescent waves. Electromagnetism has been shown by Kaluza-Klein theory to actually exist in the fifth dimension. In other words, EM itself is hyperdimensional. It flows in the fifth dimension, which is \"wrapped around\" each point in our ordinary space. It is — to the first approximation — the external environment of every normal point in *E.g., see T. Sato et al, \"Application of evanescent waves to microscopic observation,\" Bull. Tokyo Inst. Technol. (Japan), No. 125, 1974. p. 35-41. See also G.A. Massey, \"Microscopy and pattern generation with scanned evanescent waves,\" Appl. Opt. (Poland), l3(3), 1983, p. 247-255."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"273 Extraordinary Biology our 3-space. Let's say that again. The electromagnetics \"medium\" itself is totally external to each point in our space. Each of our points is surrounded in higher space by the electromagnetic medium. We live inside a totally electromagnetic medium. It's not just an \"electromagnetic environment\" in our own space; instead, it's an electromagnetic environment in hyperspace. Everything already is just the internal structure of the electromagnetic medium! That's what the \"vacuum\" is. That's what \"spacetime\" is. That's what the \"virtual state\" is. That's what physical matter is. And it's all alive. Totally and completely alive. Everything is alive. There is nothing but life. The electromagnetic medium is alive. Except within a locally-organized biopotential area, it's just \"equally alive in all directions.\" So it appears inert, where by \"inert\" we mean not singly preferential. Every biopotential change, at any level in a biopotential, extends \"decaying-expotential-wise\" to infinity, by standard theory. Part of that potential change exists at every point in the entire spatial universe. And there at that point, so do the biopotential changes for every other biosystem in the universe. Everything's alive. There is nothing but life. Anywhere. Any- time. An interchange between this \"living, surrounding electromag- netic medium\" and each particle of mass in our 3-space continually occurs. This exchange involves the so-called virtual particle flux. If we model higher dimensions, such as are necessary to include the \"particle zoo\" discovered by modern particle physics, each of these \"higher dimensions\" corresponds to a \"successively deeper-\""},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 274 internested level of virtual particle flux—of the vacuum, or of this electromagnetic medium that surrounds us. The living system orders, structures, and dynamically functions and interchanges electromagnetically throughout many higher \"dimensions\" — throughout many such internested levels of virtual- state/vacuum/spacetime. Except for the first layer of virtual state (the 5th dimen- sion in Kaluza-Klein theory), gross (classical) electromag- netic theory totally ignores the infolded, ordered deeper structure of eleetromagnetism (of the EM medium). Using such gross electromagnetics, orthodox science thus can only detect and grasp the gross results of the living organism's functioning. Further, it can only detect and grasp those gross results that actually move 3-space matter — observable particles. So it only detects the grossest interchanges between \"mind\" or \"life\" and matter. Specifically, it only detects the final results of that interchange—the gross movement of material particles themselves. The first hypernumber — \"i,\" the square root of minus 1 — is used to model another dimension at right angles to our normal three. An electromagnetic wave thus is modeled to have two parts: the first is the part that affects or moves a material particle, and that's called the \"real\" part or \"observable\" part. The second part of the EM wave is the component that lies in this \"imaginary\" (unfortunate standard term!) dimension. That imaginary part does not of itself move charged particles, so it is considered to be \"something other than real.\" Note that what's really done in this sort of orthodox modeling is to define observation as the movement of observable charged par- ticles. The human \"conscious mind\" is a functioning part of the overall human mind that has been specifically fitted to function almost totally with our gross bodily detection of the photon interaction. We thus consciously detect and \"are aware of only the first level of reality: the interface between the first layer of virtual-state/ vacuum/spacetime/ and the 3-space of observable particles of mass. Since the physicist must be \"conscious\" of his observation or instrumental detection, the detection process ultimately has to have"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"275 Extraordinary Biology a final stage that produces a photoelectric interaction with his body — for that is all the conscious mind detects and processes. Everything chemical, electrical, etc. — according to quantum mechanics — will involve at its root level only the photoelectric effect. Rife's Microscope Used Evanescent Waves However, it is certainly possible to build an instrument which is multi-staged, and one in which higher stages interact primarily with deeper internested levels of vacuum virtual state. That is, an instrument that interacts with higher dimensional phenomena. That is, one that interacts with deeper internested levels of electro- magnetics. If these stages interact causally in a vertical manner, then the final interaction with the human body and nervous system can still be \"normal electromagnetics\" and yet indicate a higher dimensional phenomenon, event, or function. That is precisely what Rife did: His universal microscope penetrated to a much finer level of reality because its multiple stages used evanescent waves. Here's what we mean by that. An electromagnetic wave consists of a \"real\" part and an \"imagi- nary\" part, as we have discussed. It's possible, however, to have the real part become zero, and still have the \"imaginary\" part remain and dynamically vary. This sort of wave — containing only the \"imaginary\" part — is said to be one type of complex wave, or an evanescent wave. In advanced EM waveguide and optical theory, such evanescent waves can function to guide or determine the real parts of the EM waves. That \"real part\" is the part that is then going to interact with electrons and move them, and give us a \"detection.\" In other words, the \"real\" part of the EM wave will be moved and guided by the \"higher dimensional\" or evanescent part, or even by separated evenescent parts — pure evanescent waves. So one can build a device or instrument that utilizes such an effect to reveal what's going on in a whole dimension beyond what we"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 276 normally see. Waveguides in certain RF radars already do that. Such instruments are not limited to the resolution determined by the \"real\" part of the EM wave (such as the \"real part\" of light). Such a microscope would not necessarily be limited in resolution by the wavelength of the light it used to illustrate the observed object. Indeed, if one uses a higher dimensional Kaluza-Klein model (which particle physics of necessity has to consider), one could build a \"repetitive stages\" instrument which could view many more higher dimensions. That's exactly the same thing as viewing many more deeper internested levels of virtual state. That is precisely what Royal R. Rife did: He developed a microscope using multiple stages, special interferences, etc. He built a multistaged evanescent wave instrument that could see into higher dimensions and deeper levels of virtual state. Rife's microscopes were thus startlingly different from normal microscopes. That is why he could see phenomena and organisms, ostensibly within the size capability of normal microscopic resolu- tion, which ordinary microscopes could not see.* Evanescent waves penetrate the virtual state (hyperdimen- sions) and interact with what to us is \"dimensionless\" (what does not spatially intersect our 3-space). Interfering multiple evanescent waves reflected from/having interacted with these (to us) nonphysi- cal forms can again reproduce ordinary electromagnetic \"light.\" Thus the evanescent wave microscope, if properly built, allows one to directly \"see\" (and photograph) what is to us living forms of energy, nonphysical, and without 3-space matter bodies.** The same scheme can be used to develop instruments capable of directly revealing the living nonphysical world around us — such as the human biopotentials, their internal structures (including *However, Rife's microscope was extraordinarily difficult to focus. Rife often spent 24 hours straight at his universal microscope, just in focusing it. **If one is going to accept the many-dimensional theories necessary to explain particle physics, one must accept the possibility of higher dimensional living things, which we would see as living energy forms or as thought forms. These would appear nonphysical to us - as is time itself— but would be real and interactive nonetheless."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"277 Extraordinary Biology \"thought forms\"), etc. What the Soviets call bioplasma can be directly observed and photographed in this fashion. We have only to develop the necessary instruments; the science required is difficult, but it is already in the literature. That is what Rife's microscope did. It was a forerunner of the instruments we need to develop in electromagnetic healing, and Rife was a truly great and unappreciated pioneer. In one swoop medical science could have jumped a cen- tury ahead. The ruthless suppression of Rife and his fantas- tic scientific breakthrough was one of the most dastardly deeds ever perpetuated by the orthodox scientific establish- ment. Rife Revealed a Far More Fundamental, Living Biology With Rife's powerful universal microscope, it was also possible to view the interiors of the so-called \"pinpoint\" cells situated between normal tissue cells and just barely visible to ordinary microscopes. Here is the astonishing living world inside those \"pinpoint\" cells, as revealed under Rife's powerful instrument: When one of the \"pinpoint\" cells was magnified, still smaller cells were revealed within its structure. When one of these still-smaller cells, in turn, was magnified, it too was seen to be composed of even smaller cells. With Rife's microscope, this process could be repeated 16 times. An astonishing internested series of organized levels of a living cell was revealed, far more fundamental than anything that exists in present biological theory. The present author points out most strongly that these levels correspond electrically to, and are in virtual particle flux pattern exchange with, the electromagnetic potentials of their environment. This includes their own biopotentials that are centered in the atomic nuclei of the atoms comprising the physical material of the cells, and that charge up with specific internal patterns. The biopotential itself is organized into a corresponding virtual- state series of internested levels and functions. The structured biopotential of the cell is a living, organized, functioning thing, and its internal functioning literally constitutes the \"spirit\" or \"true nonmaterial deep mind\" of the organism."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Biology 278 All the internested levels are in constant electromagnetic ex- change \"up and down\" with each other, particularly with respect to organized virtual particle flux patterns. In addition, all the cells are in constant electromagnetic ex- change \"across\" with each other, at all levels. This provides a dynamic, structured, living biopotential for the entire bio-organism (the entire body). Within this potential, dynamic interchange on all levels is continually occurring. This is the basis for the master cellular communication system that Dr. Fritz Albert Popp discov- ered. Rife's powerful microscope had revealed nonmaterial function- ing life forms (structured, dynamic, living biopotentials) connected to material bodies. He could follow \"filterable\" forms of bacteria — actual living biopotential forms of the organisms that could not be separated out by filters, but which would easily pass through any filter.* He could observe interactions of these forms, changes of forms, translations and transmissions of forms, etc. — none of which is detectable by present biological theory or medical science. Rife had advanced biology and biophysics a century in one jump. As always, orthodox scientists — most of whom in their scientific paradigm are self-admitted materialists — were quite unready to tolerate such heresy. Obviously the materialistic dogma of the science of his day — and of the science of today — reacted most hostilely to such hogwash. Contrary to the prevailing mystique, most scientists are dogmati- cally attached to materialism and to the dogma of their present paradigm. Faced with a conflict provided by experiment, most will uphold the dogma and reject the experiment — the exact opposite of the scientific method they espouse. Rife's revolutionary work was no exception. He incurred the unending, total opposition of powerful individuals controlling the direction of biology and medical science for their own personal gains. Rife was hounded into court on trumped up charges. Though he was acquitted, he emerged a shaken, broken man and an alcoholic. *More precisely, they would easily flow around the 3-dimensional filter, since they were hyperdimensional."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"279 Extraordinary Biology His work was suppressed. His equipment was left to gather dust. He was also forcibly committed to a medical treatment facility. Finally escaping from his \"prison,\" Rife lived out his remaining years quietly. He died without ever being vindicated for his marvel- ous, world-shaking discoveries. But at least he left us a legacy. Persons are still alive who knew Rife and his work, to one degree or another. Some of his microscopes are still in existence, though non-operable due to missing or stolen parts. With proper funding, an enlightened team of scientists and researchers can be assembled to quickly repair Rife's remaining instruments and duplicate his incredible work. With concentrated effort, Rife's work will yet play a primary role in the development of a direct electromagnetic cure for AIDS. As a byproduct, it will play a role in rapid development of cures for cancer and other debilitating diseases. Royal R. Rife's contributions may yet help save half of human- ity, and prevent a Soviet takeover of the world."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Developing The EM Cure For AIDS 280 CHAPTER 6 DEVELOPING THE ELECTROMAGNETIC CURE FOR AIDS By now, how one goes about developing a electromagnetic cure for AIDS — and for cancer and other killer diseases — should be apparent. One must set up a modern research laboratory and assemble as many of the \"dirty dozen\" together as is possible. One then tackles the problem head-on, adding the necessary support staff and special consultants. First the Kaznacheyev effect for AIDS must be isolated and determined. Then it must be reversed, to yield the precise \"curative\" signal. Transforms for these Kaznacheyev IR/UV \"death photons\" and their phase conjugated \"healing photons\" must be obtained for a lower electromagnetic frequency band — such as, say, 10 to 20 gigahertz. Away must be found to irradiate the whole human body with the curative signal. The ideal way is to utilize a scalar EM curative transform so that the atomic nuclei of the body — and hence its entire master cellular control system and immune control system—will be \"charged up\" with the correctly structured \"AIDS cancellation message.\" The entire procedure and apparatus must be as simple and small as possible. My colleagues have already achieved very promising — even remarkable — progress in this respect. Reversing the Kaznacheyev Effect The \"Kaznacheyev effect\" for AIDS virus condition must be stimulated between cell cultures, so that the disease condition is electromagnetically transferred from one to another. The actual electromagnetic \"delta\" constituting the contribution of the AIDS infection must then be isolated electronically. The best way to do this"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"281 Developing The EM Cure For AIDS is probably to subtract the normal cell radiation pattern from the \"cell plus AIDS\" radiation pattern.* With the \"AIDS delta\" determined, the delta is then fed into the appropriate phase conjugating mirror system, so that its time reversed replica is produced. The new phase conjugated signal is then the required AIDS reversal signal to reverse the effects of the AIDS virus itself, inside the cell where it resides dormant. This \" time-reversed\" signal will reverse the genetic change in the cell, not just kill the HIV virus. In a crude way, one is making an electromagnetic anti-virus. For ease of development and treatment, microwave technology is most attractive. Obtaining transforms of the signals in the radar band is ideal, since a wide variety of techniques, instruments, and electronic parts are available for that region. Millimeter waves would be most attractive, for the equipment could then be highly miniaturized. One can regard it another way also: energy forms (critters) are involved. The action of the AIDS virus in its host cell, upon the DNA of the host, is underlaid by manipulation of energy critters. If one makes the electromagnetic anti-virus form, one is also manipulating the energy critters in their virtual state substrata. The net result is that essentially the virus pattern — even the virus itself — can be phase conjugated by the energy critters. The result can be to turn the actual virus in the cell into a negative virus, accomplishing recombinant DNA procedures in reverse. Remember that the signal we seek to use involves negative energy and negative time. We are also engineering the virtual state directly. The ordinary positive energy/positive time/observable state rules and limitations do not necessarily apply. And the \"fixed form\" first order physical reality as we normally conceive it need not *Procedures along the lines of the extraordinary double-exposure holographic work of Dr. Robert Powell will probably be necessary. His work on biologically significant spatial frequency spectroscopy has blazed the trail as to how to obtain the specific delta patterns desired. It is hoped that Powell will shortly publish the remarkable results of his 15 years' work."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Developing The EM Cure For AIDS 282 be so fixed at all. Physical reality itself can be directly engineered. The engineering we seek to accomplish is directly upon the probability states propagated by the Schroedinger equation, before observation and collapse of the wave function occurs. We seek to engineer physical reality before it is born, while it is yet forming. Only at such a level can the previous action of the AIDS virus — that in which it combined its genetic material with the genetic material of the host cell — be reversed and undone. Only at such a level can we convert the infected human body from an \"AIDS virus factory\" back to an uninfected normal human body without AIDS. The Proof: Priore's Work Antoine Priore's pioneering work largely proves that it can be done. Cancers, leukemias, and many other virulent diseases yielded to his phase conjugated signals passed down through a powerful magnetic field to totally penetrate every cell in the treated patient's body. And Royal R. Rife's work proved that a virus and a bacterium are not at all the \"rigidly fixed\" physical forms that our normal science has led us to believe they are. Instead, both the organisms and their biochemical and genetic actions can be addressed — and changed — on a much finer level of reality. Of course, it would be enormously helpful if one had a working Rife microscope. My colleagues are attempting to rebuild one of the original Rife microscopes, which has parts that were missing from it. They have every hope of having the microscope in action in the future. Another angle of attack is also possible. One of my colleagues has discovered a very peculiar, weak electromagnetic signal that will kill viruses, harmful bacteria, toxic protozoa, etc. but not harm living human cells. Only a few volts and"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"283 Developing The EM Cure For AIDS a few milliamps are used. However, there exists a major problem in getting any such very weak signal into every cell in the body — which is required if one is to heal blood diseases such as AIDS and leukemia. After all, that was the reason that Priore utilized a powerful magnetic field of thou- sands of gauss. The magnetic field penetrated every cell in the body — even those in the bone marrow where all the blood cells are manufactured. By using the all-penetrating field as the carrier, the phase conjugated healing signal pattern could thus be introduced into every cell in the body, bathing it completely, inside and out, with the restorative signal. Remember, one must not just get the signal into the cells themselves — instead, one must get the restorative signals directly into, and absorbed in, the atomic nuclei. Again, that is why Antoine Priore found it necessary to employ a \"rippling\" magnetic field. The \"ripple\" was actually a magnetic wave, and nuclear resonance then provided the magic mechanism to penetrate all the atomic nuclei. So the initial problem is, how does one provide a mechanism to carry the desired signals into and through each and every cell of the body and into each and every atomic nucleus of the matter of the body? Obviously one can utilize nuclear magnetic resonance, after the fashion of Priore. If so, the resulting apparatus is going to be extremely large and expensive. It would be highly desirable to do it a different, simpler, much cheaper way. After many hundreds of back-breaking experiments, one of my colleagues appears to have discovered a completely unique and direct way of introducing the desired EM restorative signals into and completely through every cell of the body, and into every atomic nucleus. Though much additional work to confirm this still remains, the initial results are marvelously encouraging. Another colleague has succeeded in developing a peculiar sort of detector that should prove adaptable to detecting the actual \"biopo- tential structural patterns\" themselves, directly in and out of the atomic nuclei. Though obviously much more work is necessary before the final instrumentation is ready, the preliminary results"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Developing The EM Cure For AIDS 284 are again most encouraging. As I write these words on paper, this work is proceeding, but very, very slowly due to lack of the necessary funds to attack the research problems in force. What is Needed Time is running out —most conventional science appears to be driven by special interest groups/Drug Manufacturers who are un- able and/or unwilling to counter the AIDS epidemic with anything other than extensive \"Addict Style\" symptom-reducing drugs that generate dollars, not cures. Though this is not universal, it is the conventional norm. Unconventional disorders or diseases require unconventional science for unconventional cures. Immediate funding is required if this awesome threat to human- ity is to be stopped. An American public alerted in time to this desperate situation can demand that the government and/or private business immediately address and act on this life-threatening issue in a different, unconventional manner. Encouraging Preliminary Work One of my associates, already familiar with scalar EM devices, has exerted every effort to try to reduce the scope of the problem. In literally hundreds of experiments, he has been able to narrow down the search, and obtain at least some very promising results. He has obtained an initial candidate phase conjugated signal for further test and trial. He may well have succeeded in discovering a new and unique method to communicate signals directly into the atomic nuclei inside the matter in the human body. This signal presently appears to directly interact with the cellular biopotential and with the body's master cellular communication system. Remember, however, these are preliminary results. They still must be fully substantiated in a great many more tests. Undoubt- edly a great deal more research, analysis, and adaptation is neces- sary. We certainly cannot presently say we have any sort of \"cure\" for the AIDS virus or anything else — or that these results are to be considered as proven in any fashion."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"285 Developing The EM Cure For AIDS But what we can say is that my colleague has been able to derive a very complicated phase-conjugated signal, which produces nega- tive energy and negative time of the general sort required. And he may just have made a most marvelous discovery that will point the way to eventual equipment much, much smaller than the 4-stories high machine with which Priore intended to treat terminal human cancer patients. The initial signal discovered by my colleague, when applied to the body at miniscule voltage, seems to zap all sorts of \"bad things\" — viruses, harmful bacteria, dangerous protozoa, microworms, you name it — without harming the blood cells, the normal body cells, or the hosted friendly bacteria. The signal does this at miniscule voltage and amperage. It can be applied directly to the body through special electrodes. Through a special feature, my colleague has been able to get the signal to reverberate the entire body, all cells, all parts, and even penetrate the atomic nuclei and establish scalar resonance therein. There turned out to be some extremely strange things that have to be done to the phase conjugated signal before it will accomplish what is being sought. At least some of these \"strange things\" have been uncovered by my colleague. One of the peculiarities is that the entire electrical apparatus is part of the input \"form\" (that conditions the potential wave struc- ture) being phase conjugated and sent to the organism. If a lead-acid battery is included in the apparatus to power it, one will inject the electromagnetic form for the battery acid directly into the organ- ism,* destroyingit. This includes destroying the host's cells. In this case the signal is lethal, not curative. Substitution of a dry cell battery with no liquid electrolyte eliminates the problem. Exactly why a liquid electrolyte has a toxic effect and a \"sludge\" or solid electrolyte does not, is not understood at this time. Other such anomalies in the tentative process have been discov ered and compensated for. However, the way ahead is exciting. It suggests that the body *Via a mechanism similar to that found by Reid and Barsamian"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Developing The EM Cure For AIDS (atomic nuclei) can literally be \"charged up\" (i.e., the living biopoten- tials can be \"charged up\" with the signal structure) so that the \"disease-proofing\" is very lasting, possibly for many years or even for a lifetime. At least my colleague has pressed this to the point of demonstrat- ing a long-lasting charge being acquired by the body. For example, at one time his body became so \"charged\" from his lengthy experiments that a one-inch blue spark often leaped from his fingers when he reached out for something metallic. The discharge was cool, negative energy — living energy, if you will. It should be negentropic, not entropic. It was definitely not the type of energy the orthodox scientific community is accustomed to. And normal elec- tricity will definitely not charge up the body in such a continuing fashion, so far as is known. Let me clearly state again that we have not yet produced the specific anti-pattern per se. What my colleagues have discovered appears to be a broad-band signal that appears to act hyperspatially, analogous to the manner in which a broad-band drug such as penicillin acts biochemically. Even this much remains to be clearly established. However, it is a most encouraging and promising first step. Much more work, and a great deal of experiments to substanti- ate or adapt these tentative results, still need to be done. Now there is no substitute for rigor and thoroughness — and there is no substitute for clearly and scientifically demonstrating the proof of the concept in the laboratory. It is not just good intentions that we seek, but solid, concrete, proven results substantiated by proper scientific procedures. Much work remains to be done. But the preliminary results are very encouraging indeed. Let me briefly share with you some of the things we foresee, if this present line of successful development continues. We foresee being able to eventually develop and set up — legally and under proper medical auspices, of course — tested and proven 286"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"287 Developing The EM Cure For AIDS devices that can easily treat up to two or three hundred persons at once. A treatment of about 45 minutes to one hour is all that would be required. Several repetitive treatments a week or so apart, might prove advisory. In addition,once the entire gamut of the treatment process is validated and proven, and shown to be completely harmless and safe in accordance with legal medical requirements, if need arises we foresee simply adding the signal to ordinary radio and television transmitters — perhaps as simply as modulating the electrical ground. If so, a \"maintenance\" signal could be established to negate the AIDS virus (or other disease such as cancer and leukemia) in an entire area, and keep out other diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, etc. Another advantage of such machines would be their portability in time of conflict. Also, they would be most useful indeed as defensive measures against biological warfare. For example, the inhalation of only a relative minor amount of anthrax agent is sufficient for 100 percent certain death unless treatment begins promptly. With the portable machines, however, this would be easily negated in any troops exposed to the agent, even before the lethal disease is evidenced. For a totally new agent, a \"phase- conjugate delta signal\" could be rather quickly ascertained and developed, and the proper settings made on the machines for imme- diate treatment and immunizing. And even later, when we proceed to the direct engineering of the living energy form strata themselves, we shall see remarkable cures and remissions of diseases for which medical science offers little hope today. Arthritis, multiple schlerosis, lupus, and other such debilitating diseases come readily to mind. Even reversal of the aging process should be possible.* *Two other promising approaches have recently been discovered First, an electrolyte compound has recently been approved by the FDA for clinical testing. This compound has the remarkable property of raising the cellular electrical potential back to that of a strong, healthy cell. In several years of lab animal testing, this alone was indicated to be over 80% effective against cancer. It may also prove effective against diseases such as arthritis, where the body's immune system attacks body tissue with lowered cellular potentials, since it fails to recognize the weakened cells as those of the body. Second, Baylor University reseachers have found that treating blood with certain laser EM radiation kills the AIDS virus, but does not harm the blood cells This means that it will be possible to assure that blood used in transfusions will be AIDS - free, eliminating one sorce of AIDS transmission."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Developing The EM Cure For AIDS 288 Conclusion We have now come to the end of our road, literally and figura- tively. All of us have been struck a mortal blow by the Soviet AIDS first strike. Make no mistake, this is real. We and our children are already as good as dead unless we move as we have never moved before. We have a chance. A slim chance. Americans have always come through when the chips are down. We can conquer this thing. We can overcome this mighty death blow that has been launched against us. We can defeat the others yet to come. But we've got to move. Now. Remember, Pandora's box has already been spilled. Even without the Soviet biological warfare strike, hosts of new viruses and different strains of old ones are going to be, and are now being, dumped into the biosphere by our own culture. It is also only a matter of time before terrorists and meglomaniacs turn to the use of this potent weapon against a wide-open society such as ours. Both our Armed Forces and our civilian populace are totally defenseless against electromagnetic biological war- fare. Now. At this moment. Even without the Soviet BW strike implication, it is only a matter of time until we perish, unless we develop electromagnetic healing and electromagnetic biological warfare countermeasures. We've come to one of those profound momentary pauses in history that determine the fate of the entire world henceforth. It's like the parable of the lady or the tiger. We're facing, so to speak, two doors."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"289 Developing The EM Cure For AIDS Behind one is the most fearsome and hungry tiger of all time. If we delay, that door will open and we'll get the tiger full upon us. We shall be utterly destroyed. That mighty tiger will consume half the world in his roaring frenzy. Our children, and our children's children — what few of them will be left — will wear the hammer and sickle yoke for eons. Those few future survivors will be taught strange things. How you and I were the real enemy. How we were absolutely destroyed for the good of all mankind. How glorious and necessary it was to unleash the great plagues upon us. And how heroic were those who performed the \"noble deed.\" Our own distant children will curse us and revile us, and they will be taught to worship at the throne of a false prophet. The world will descend into a new \"Dark Ages\" far more frightful than George Orwell ever envisioned. On the other hand, behind the second door is the most beautiful lady of all history. Literally all of humanity's dreams of health, beauty, and vitality lie behind that door. If we open it, we achieve a freedom from disease and a measure of bountiful health for all mankind that has heretofore only been dreamed of. Even reversal of the aging process itself lies beyond the second door. Health and youth — the dream of the ages — can be ours. But we have only a moment to open the second door. It is firmly shut, and we must exert ourselves to the fullest if we are to open it at all. On the human stage, the first door is already slowly opening, inexorably. In only a few moments it will be open and the tiger will be upon us. We must move quickly. Which will it be for mankind, the lady or the tiger? The next few moments in the human play will most assuredly tell."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Selected Bibliography 290 SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY Note: An extended bibliography for this book would consist of literally thousands of references.

Millions of persons in this country were inadvertently injected with a widely-used substance called simian virus 40, or SV40. Tests proved that SV40 caused cancerous cell growth when injected into ani- mals. SV40 was an unrecognized contamination of polio vaccines given before 1962 and of some cold shots given about the same time.

Specifically, SV40 does not appear to have been searched for in AIDS victims. Lack of detection has little meaning, since SV-40 may disappear and not reappear until triggered or promoted by another virus or chemical. Yet SV-40 has been shown to be one of the activators of the HIV or AIDS virus, as reported by Howard E.

To show some of the scientific disagreement as to the cause of AIDS, we quote from Dr. Duesberg's article: \"AIDS virus is not sufficient to cause AIDS and ... there is no evidence, besides its presence in a latent form, that it is necessary for AIDS.\" Dr. Duesberg pres- ents an impressive set of technical objections to the present, theory that the accepted AIDS virus actually causes AIDS. 45. Steadman's Medical Dictionary, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, 1966. p. 874. A German bacteriologist named Robert Koch established three \"laws\" to determine whether a certain micro-organism is the cause of a specific disease. These laws provide a basis for scientifically investigating infection andits causes. Koch's laws are: (1) Whether it be a bacterium, protozoan, or virus, the micro-organism must be present in all cases of the disease. (2) Inoculating animals with pure cul- tures of the micro-organism must produce the same disease in them. (3) It must be possible to obtain the micro-organism from these animals and further propagate the micro-organism in pure cultures. (Note that this leaves a real problem with any disease caused by complexes of different organisms, rather than just one.) 46.

Our own thesis is that this merely shows how clever and coordinated the Soviet BW strike really is: the deception plan was complete and ready made. The viruses were made elsewhere (in cancer research labs), someone else unwittingly injected the contami- nated vaccines (World Health Organization), and a good cover story was immediately at hand (simply blame the U.S.). 53.

Pepper, \"Nonlinear optical phase conjugation,\" guest editorial, Optical Engineering, vol. 21, no. 2, Mar./Apr. 1982. p. 155. One of the leaders of the field of nonlinear optical phase conjugation (NOPC) tells one in clear English what all the excitement is about. He also points out that the conceptual extension of these techniques to other portions of the electro- magnetic spectrum should follow. 32. David M. Pepper, \"Nonlinear optical phase conjugation,\" Optical Engineering, vol. 21, no. 2, Mar./Apr. 1982. p.156- 183. This paper is the best introduction to, and summary of, nonlinear optical phase conjugation (NOPC) in the English language. Also, on p. 156 the author specifically notes that \"...these processing techniques can, in principle, be extended to other portions of the EM spectrum (e.g.,, rt, radio, micro- wave, radars, UV, etc.); and can also involve other fields (e.g., acoustic waves), given the proper nonlinear medium.\" In other words, phase conjugation is a universal nonlinear phenome- non, unknown until recently.

Comment: By reflecting upon this paper, one can grasp that essentially the same approach can be used to show that phase conjugation gener- ates Newton's third law of motion. 38. G.S. Agarwal and Emil Wolf, \"Theory of phase conjugation with weak scatterers,\" J. Opt. Soc. Am., 72(3), Mar. 1982. p. 321-326. The effect of a distorting medium on an incident wave is eliminated by phase conjugation if certain conditions are satisfied: (1) the incident wave contains no evanescent compo- nents, (2) the transmitting medium is a weak, nonabsorbing scatterer, (3) backscattering of incident waves and of conju- gate waves is negligible, (4) effects of scattered evanescent waves are negligible.

A most important paper, presenting what I have been calling the master cellular communication system. Ruth has confirmed the existence of the \"degradation radiation,\" (\"death pho- tons\"). Experimental results of Ruth and others have led Popp to postulate that biological systems generally have the capac- ity to store coherent photons which come from the external world, and that ultraweak photon emission from biological systems is governed by photon storage (\"charge up\") within the cell population. 23.

References Related to the New View of the Nature of Mind and Thought Author's Note: So far as I can find, there are no available references other than my own that deal precisely with my particu- lar approach to the nature of mind and thought. There is, however, a serious debate over whether (a) the mind is simply the physical brain, similar to a computer (the prevailing materialist view of orthodox science), or (b) the mind is something else altogether, and metaphysical — at least with respect to the level of scientific knowledge today. My own approach utilizes a non-Aristotlean fourth law of logic (included in an appendix to this book) by means of which the dichotomy between mind and matter is removed. In that fashion, one can model the mind as material, or model matter us mind. Some references that have influenced my thinking are given below."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"325 Selected Bibliography 1. Publications by Thomas E.

Information on hydrancephaly, persons with normal intel- ligence but with large cavities in the area normally occupied by cortical tissue. Most of the data on these anomalous cases is buried in obscure medical journals. (Hydrocephaly — an excess of fluid in the cerebral/spinal system — is much more widely known.). See also Anthony Smith, The Mind, Hodder & Stoughton, 1984 for additional information on hydranceph- aly."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"327 Selected Bibliography Quoting from Costello: \"Actually cases of this kind have been turning up at autopsies for years, and reported in the appro- priate medical journals, but have been disregarded, perhaps because they are so destructive of established beliefs about the relationship between consciousness and the human brain.\" Costello goes on to point out that a group at Sheffield Univer- sity has collected a great deal of data on this subject, from case studies of 253 hydrocephalics and hydrancephalics. There seems to be no correlation between the IQ of these individuals and the amount of residual brain tissue. One living subject, Roger, has an IQ of 126 and a First Class degree in Mathematics, yet has no more than 5% of the normal amount of brain tissue. A Swedish documentary on the subject was shown on ITV in 1982. Fortean Times 38, p. 30 also contains an item on surviving adults with no detectable brains. 3.

He would be killed when the Germans left Bordeaux, he said, and since they were by that time obviously losing the war, the day of his execution was at hand. The police officer, who also worked clandestinely for the French underground, told the engineer to get in his car, then simply drove him out of the base and introduced him to the 7th battalion of underground resistance fighters, in the nearby province of Dor- dogne. There he so distinguished himself in military operations that he was ultimately decorated by the French government. It was due to his thankfulness to his savior, and his loyalty to his companions-in-arms, that Antoine Priore decided after the war's end to live out the rest of his life in Bordeaux. Thus he became the focus of one of the strangest, and most scandalous, chapters in the scientific history of France or any other nation. Antoine Priore had earlier graduated from a small provincial school for electricity in Trieste, Italy and become a radar operator in the Italian Navy. During this period he observed what to him was an exciting anomaly: some oranges left in a room filled with electrical bric-a-brac had fallen into an assemblage where they seemed to have been preserved in the same fresh state they had enjoyed when bought off a fruit stand. Other oranges in the room, bought at the same time, were rotten and putrid. Stunned by his observation, Priore dreamed throughout the war of one day working out an electrical means of conserving foods in their fresh state based on what he surmised was a new, and wholly unexplained, principle. Newton's apple had become Priore's orange. Occupied during the day as a humble electrical repairman — and projectionist in a movie theater — the almost wholly self-taught P riore devoted all his free time and his meager resources to research. With the help of his war-time companions, some of whom had attained high rank in the Bordeaux police force, he was able to beg, borrow, steal, scrounge, or otherwise acquire a mini-warehouse of electrical and electronic components and parts. With these he put together a device worthy of Rube Goldberg.

He got similar results for tulips, asparagus and other plants. Shifting his focus, he next irradiated fertilized hens' eggs, only to see the chicks hatch in 19 days, instead of the normal 21. Though he could not explain these astonishing results, he realized he had stumbled upon a process basic to the enhancement, or speeding up, of cellular growth. It was at this point that one of his police friends introduced him to Francis Berlureau, the former Director of Studies at the School for Veterinary Medicine in Toulouse and, at the time of their meeting, director of the Bordeaux abbatoir. Priore asked Berlureau to supply him with various animal tissues for experimentation. For 10 years they worked together, Priore's free time allowing, during which Priore noticed he could get no electrical measurement from a cancer- ous bull's testicles. Since he realized that, in some way, his newly constructed device (no trace of which remains today, except for a snapshot of it) affected the electrical properties of cells, he put two and two together and his sum of four led him to believe that he might be onto an electromagnetic cure for cancer. Newton's gravity had become Priore's cancer cure. Berlureau next allowed him to expose a cat with cancer of the mammary glands to radiation of his machine. To make absolutely sure that he was not exposing himself to mockery, the veterinarian had all the histological work done by his friend and colleague, a Professor Drieux at the famous Veterinarian School of Maisons- Allfort, near Paris. Drieux wrote a technical report proving that a tumor taken from a cat had, before treatment, started to become cancerous and, after treatment, had become benign. By 1953, with the help of a doctor of general medicine, Maurice Fournier, Priore began treating human patients whose cancers had been judged hopeless. The huge file of cases maintained by Fournier, and filed with a notary until after his death, was subsequently mysteriously lost. But a few details were preserved in letters discov- ered in an old dog-eared file. Some of these dating to the year 1954 concerned a 12-year old boy, Alain B., whose diagnosis wavered between one of reticulo- histio-sarcoma and a malignant form of Hodgkin's disease. The boy was taken by his parents to Priore, who irradiated him. Though the exact nature of the radiation was not known, 12 years later a Bordeaux physician, after a medical examination, certified that the boy, now become a man of 24, was free of disease. A second case unearthed from the old file indicated that a patient"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"The Case of Antoine Priore 348 with cancer of the larynx was able to avoid a laryngectomy and be totally cured after Priore's new ministration. Fascinated by the principle which he suspected must lie behind the strange Priore Ray, Dr. Berlureau tried to get some Bordeaux University physicists interested in the problem but was laughed out of their offices. He next turned to cancer specialists, beginning with Professor Lachapele, the Director of the Bergonie Foundation, a prestigious center for cancer research, to whom he proposed animal experiments to prove the efficacy of Priore's methodology. His plea met with a stony affirmation on Lachapele's part to the effect that he and his colleagues had no need of the new discovery, inasmuch as \"all the patients treated in his hospital were cured and departed in perfect health.\" As if bound in the chains of his curt reply, years later Lachapele was to become one of the bitter adversaries of Priore's pioneering research. Only somewhat discouraged, Priore kept up his momentum. He went on to build a new and more complicated version of his treatment device, called the P-l, over the next year. When it was finished he secretly and unofficially began to treat dozens of cancer patients who had been given up by their doctors as incurable. At his funeral in March of last year, among the crowd of mourners was, it is said, a small platoon of older people who had been cured of their terrible afflictions by Priore in the 1950s. While his findings excited him, he nevertheless felt tremen- dously frustrated that he could apparently get no one in the world of medicine or science to pay attention to them. Undaunted by his previous rebuffs, his friend Berlureau next introduced the Italian at the end of 1959 or the beginning of 1960 to Professor Tayeau, vice dean of Bordeaux's Medical Faculty. Unlike Lachapele, Tayeau behaved as a true physician and scientist. He sent Priore to two researchers, Biraben, head of the Faculty's Department of Patho- logical Anatomy, and his assistant, Delmon. The two had been working together on cancerous rats for two years—specifically on animals grafted with T-8 tumors, discovered by the internationally famous team of Guerin and Oberling in Paris, which had proven to be intractable to any form of treatment yet known. To their utter surprise, the tumors in the rats treated with Priore's machine were reduced in volume by 60%, marking the first time in the history of cancerology that the virulent T-8 tumor had in any way been affected by any form of treatment. Knowing that the mayor of Bordeaux, Jacques Chabans~Del- mas-who has kept his post until this day, and was soon to become prime minister of France-- was most interested in the work of Priore (who, he too, had known as a fellow resistance fighter), they also"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"349 The Case ofAntoine Priore informed Chaban. Promptly Chaban convoked not one, but two, commissions made up of Bordeaux and Parisian scientists to study the Biraben-Delmon results in detail. Both commissions rejected Priore and his machine out of hand, and without appeal. It is curious that, in the science of our day, a result, undeniable though it may be, seems to have no hearing unless and until all means to effect it can be adequately explained. It was for this ostensible reason that the two commissions decided to so adamantly reject the research: Biraben and Delmon could not explain the nature of the radiation engendered by the Priore device. One can stress the word ostensible here because the principal reason for the rejection lay elsewhere. The decision by the first commission was, in fact, hardly unanimous. But among its members was the same Professor Lachapele who had refused Berlureau's plea for assistance. His opinion was that even the results themselves were of little value because they were obtained, not on spontaneously arising, but on grafted, cancers. The fact that no treatment whatso- ever had ever affected a T-8 tumor was totally discounted. As the sole cancerologist on the commission, Lachapele's dictum was prepon- derant. When he learned that the rejection of the first commission had actually been a split decision, the Bordeaux mayor asked for the formation of a second commission to re-examine the problem. Fear- ing a reversal, Lachapele was able to get one of his colleagues, Professor Courtial, director of the Radium Institute in Paris, and one of the so-called top authorities of French cancer research, named to it. It was all but impossible for the other physicians on the new com- mission now to outvote not one, but two, cancer specialists, so again the antagonists won the day. At no time did either of the commissions bother to interview Priore himself or to run a supplementary experiment under their own control. This seemingly incomprehensible attitude on the part of scien- tific authority was only a foretaste of what was to come, again and again, over the years. Biraben and Delmon went on to do new experiments. They modified either the time after grafting that the radiation was applied, or the length of its duration. This time their efforts were crowned with unequivocal and complete success. The tumors stopped growing and, when still living cells were excised from them and implanted in healthy control animals, none of them became malignant. Though these results should normally have fascinated any academy of medicine or sciences, the two researchers did not publish"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 350 them. Why? The reasons horrify or disgust. It seemed that Biraben was simultaneously preparing an examination for the agregation, the highest French academic degree leading to a senior university teaching post. In charge of the committee to pass on, and award, this degree was none other than that same Professor Lachapele who told him: \"Either you get the degree, necessary to your professional advancement, or you publish your research paper. But not both!\" Discouraged, Biraben ceded to this demand but nevertheless contin- ued to work on the research that looked so exciting and promising. Most mystifying to him was how the machine operated to achieve its startling results. At the 3rd Congress of Biometerology held in 1963 in the Pyrennees mountains, a New York City re- searcher by the name of Kenneth McLean reported he had been able to obtain regressions on tumors and improve the health of cancer patients by using a magnetic field of a strength of 3000 gauss or more. Acting on this hint, Biraben and Delmon made an electromag- net that put out a field of 4,500 gauss and tried it out on the T-8 tumors but without the slightest success. Obviously, something other than a simple magnetic field was at issue. In 1966, after others had had the same success with the T-8 tumor by irradiating it with the \"Priore Ray,\" the two scientists finally published a memoir in the Revue of Comparative Pathol- ogy in which they stated that neither magnetic fields nor X-rays had any effect on the T-8s and that \"only certain devices associating a magnetic field with high frequency waves seem at present to reveal therapeutic properties...\" Their conclusions were too late for, by that time, a campaign to stamp out Priore and his electromagnetic approach to cancer cure was well underway, a campaign that has lasted right up to the present moment. The all-powerful Lachapele had sealed the fate of the Priore device as far as the local Bordeaux medical community was con- corned. Veterinarian Berlureau and Priore next decided to carry their case to Paris. They contacted Professor Guerin at the cancer Institute at Villejuif, the leading French center for cancer research nnd the equivalent of the American National Cancer Institute in Be- thesda, Maryland. Guerin, one of the discoverers of the T-8 tumor, which for the first time had been stopped in its tracks by the Priore device, courteously received his guests and heard them relate the whole story of how the device had come into being, starting at the point. when Priore had seen the oranges strangely preserved by some unaccountable electromagnetic effect. Guerin was sufficiently impressed that he assigned his col- league, Marcel-Rene Riviere, to delve into the whole question. For"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"351 The Case ofAntoine Priore two years, Riviere, who also had teaching responsibilities at the University of Rennes in Brittany, unremittingly worked to corrobo- rate the Biraben-Delmon findings. On 9 December 1964 a note was sent for publication in the Proceedings of the French Academy of Sciences detailing the research and modestly concluding: \"... as of now, one may already state that our first observations show that electromagnetic fields used can lead to most interesting data from a point of view of the biological behavior of grafts and their therapeutic action on experimental tumors.\" Riviere next decided to see if the Priore Ray could affect another tumoral form that had never been affected by any therapeutic method, the 347 lymphoblastic lymphosarcoma. The results were even more spectacular than for the T-8 tumor. The effects produced were of broader scope and took place more rapidly. A second note was sent to the Academy for publication. The conclusion read: \"We can now already affirm that our research offers proof that electromag- netic fields are capable of producing effects on quite different types of neoplasms.\" At this point one of the key characters in this extraordinary drama must be introduced. There might have been no drama at all without his appearance on stage. This personage was Robert Cour- rier, an eminent endocrinologist, who had been named, while still in his 30s, a full professor. Courrier was now perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences and later would become President of the Academy of Medicine. Because no scientific paper can be accepted by an academy unless introduced by one of its members, Riviere would have had no chance to see his work so prestigiously published had not Courrier, who knew Riviere well, since he had shepherded him through the winning of his doctorate, taken the responsibility for its introduction. It was Courrier who, at this point, also took up the cudgel to interest various highly placed French organizations responsible for the administration of scientific projects and their funding. Thus, ho sent a personal letter to the French Minister for Scientific Atomic and Space Research, who immediately offered to try to make funds available for further research on and with the Priore Ray. He also personally asked the Director of the CNRS (National Center for Scientific Research, which coordinates and oversees all such activity in France) to receive Priore and Riviere. That this meeting was, in its way, somewhat of a disaster, can be explained in part only by a brief resume of the complex character of Priore himself. Priore throughout his life had great difficulty making himself understood in the French language and, as the years went by, he even forgot how adequately to speak his own mother"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 352 tongue, Italian. Added to these twin impediments was his lifelong fear that his discoveries and inventions were prone to being stolen, a fear which led him never to fully explain the exact nature of the complex radiation emitted from his machine, far less the settings which controlled its various parameters. Whether Priore would not, or could not, exactly explain the functioning of his invention (which, as we shall see, went through several increasingly complex genera- tions) is a question to which no precise answer has been given. It would appear that Priore was an excellent engineer gifted more with a God-given intuition than with school-book reasoning and logic. In short, Priore had a combination of talents that could remind one of the same enigmatic personality that was Nikola Tesla, the deductive reasoning behind some of whose discoveries has never fully been unravelled. Highly placed scientific administrators are neither comfortable with, nor sympathetic to, what they see as self-appointed geniuses who have not run the same academic gauntlet through which they themselves had to pass. Thus the CNRS director took aversion to Priore's somewhat incomprehensible, yet fairly prolix explanations of his technology and only recommended that a physicist be sent to look over his device to properly decipher its working. At the same time, the Minister, together with the head of the general delegation for Scientific Research (DGRST) — still another key body in the administration of the French scientific decision-making process — let it be known to Robert Courrier that they had not understood a tingle thing about Priore's invention despite his best efforts to present it. Advancing one more step into what was to become for him a 20 year-long expedition into a jungle of scientific intrigue, Courrier next resolutely decided to send to Bordeaux one of his most trusted laboratory workers, Madame Colonge, to repeat Riviere's experi- ments under her personal supervision. The DGRST director fully Concurred with Courrier's decision, while letting slip his admission that he strongly suspected that Riviere might well have been duped in some manner by Priore. When Courrier asked the minister for travel funds for Madame Colonge, he was refused with the dry remark that such a request was \"premature.\" The now angry Cour- rier telephoned to reply: \"You've been spending millions for pro- grams and hypotheses about the cancer problem. Riviere has been presenting you with facts!\" The physicist who had been sent to try to elucidate the function- ing principles of Priore's device, reported that he could make neither \"head nor tail\" of the machine. Madame Colonge's experimentation was as prolonged as neces-"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"353 The Case ofAntoine Priore sary. She was so meticulous that, in order not to take her eyes off the experimental animals for an instant, she limited her lunches to sandwiches eaten in the laboratory. She returned, profoundly im- pressed, to Paris. Nor was Riviere idle during this period. He decided to experi- ment with the L-52 lymphosarcoma, a tumor similar to, but even more malignant than the 347. This time, he used not rats, but mice, as hosts for the grafts. So successful were his results that, this time, Courrier decided to bar no holds. Instead of simply having a note published in the Academy Proceedings on the quiet, he decided to present it personally, orally, and in all solemnity, before his fellow academicians at an official meeting scheduled for 1 May 1965. That date was, and is, a turning point in what came to be known in France as the \"Priore Affair.\" From then on the whole French, and even the international, scientific community could be divided into a minority and a majority group, the first that believed in the research, the second that did not know enough details about it, did not or would not believe, or simply didn't give a damn. Before Courrier could make his presentation, its scheduling and subject were inadvertently and prematurely leaked to the press. Immediately thereafter, a horde of journalists arrived in Bordeaux. After one or two of them managed to all but force entry into his lab, Priore closed its doors and, with the help of his friends, wrote a printed press release that stressed his thankfulness to the many people who had helped him over the years rather than providing any comprehensible details about the machine he had brought to birth. Stymied, many of the newsmen travelled across town to seek an explanation from its leading cancerologist, Professor Lachapele, who informed them acidly that the machine was all but useless and unworthy of their attention or their time. The journalists' reports, founded as they were on rumor of outright lies, roiled the pages of their newspapers and magazines in such a way that they either over-exaggerated the potential or a forthcoming cancer cure, or came close to billing Priore as just one more cancer-cure charlatan. All of which so alarmed, among many others, Dr. Wilhelm Bernhard, world specialist in electron micros- copy, that he called his friend Courrier to warn him that his forthcoming presentation to the academy might put his hard-won reputation at risk as well as those of Guerin, Riviere and the Villejuif cancer institute itself. In the journalistic melee, no one had bothered to read the declaration carefully issued by Riviere from Rennes, where he was occupied with his university courses, which formally stated: \"Our experiments are of real interest. Much more experimental research"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 354 has of course to be done before any therapeutic application on human cancer victims can even be considered. It goes without saying that this will take a certain time and no little effort of many types, both scientific and financial. Our work, as fascinating a perspective as it might hold, in no way, therefore, allows anyone to offer the public hope which could only lead to deception at the present time.\" On May Day, Courrier gave his report to an Academy assembly hall crowded with scientists, newspapers and television reporters, photographers and an unusual number of curious bystanders. Ac- companied with slides showing histological details, and animals before and after treatment, his lecture was heard out in almost tomb- like silence. When the lights came on again, he announced that he had personally checked the validity of Riviere's findings through the offices of his personal assistant, Madame Colonge. He then went on to say that he had taken the responsibility of presenting three notes to the Academy for two reasons. The first was a ringing declaration and a challenge to critics and skeptics of every stamp. It reads \"When it is a question of a problem as serious as that of cancer and when one sees a little light beginning to dawn, one has the obligation to see what this light might represent. One has no right to snuff it out before learning what it may be worth.\" The second was a tribute to his colleagues who had done the pioneering work, particularly Guerin, Riviere and Madame Colonge, and a statement of the essence of the problem to be faced down the road. It read: \"Attention must naturally be given to the apparatus which Monsieur Priore has conceived and constructed. It has appar- ently already been examined by several physicists. It is found to be too complicated. While that may be possible, it is nevertheless a fact that Guerin and Riviere have obtained results with it that had to be made public. What is emitted from such an apparatus? I hope Monsieur Priore will allow disinterested physicists to study it at their leisure, for Science cannot tolerate apparatuses enveloped in mystery.\" Then, as almost a footnote to the history of the moment: \"The biological action of magnetic fields is the object of intense research in the United States. In specialized institutes, the influence of these fields on tissue cultures, microbes, plant forms, diastases and certain tumors is under study. Up to now, the results obtained on grafted tumors seem less significant than those which have here been presented.\" After Courrier sat down, a leading cancer specialist, Professor Lacassagne, rose to ask snidely why the notes had included no bibliographical references on work done on the bio-effects on tumors from electromagnetic fields, and criticized the experimentation as \"impromptu.\" When Courrier denied this allegation as ludicrous,"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"355 The Case ofAntoine Priore Lacassagne stalked out of the assembly hall in full view of the audience. The meeting caused a new eruption of media reports which unfortunately accented one of three aspects of the problem at the expense of the other two. These were 1) the hope that a miraculous cure for cancer was in the offing 2) the contradictory, not to say discordant, reception of the data by various academics and 3) the enigma of Priore's personality. Remarkably, no serious discussion among the scientists present at the meeting ever took place. This led a foreign scientist, present in Paris at the time, to remark: \"I don't understand. Here is a report given to the most authoritative scientific body in France by one of the most respected and eminent of its members and it is publicly subject to doubt without that leading to any reaction whatsoever.\" The General Delegation for Scientific Research was at this point still open to the idea of providing funds for more research with the Priore Ray. The big stumbling block, however, was one related to niceties involved in relations up and down the scientific hierarchy. To open the way to the allocation of such funds required the approval of the Delegation's own section for cancer research and that section was headed by none other than the same Professor Lacassagne who had so rudely walked out of the Academy's assembly hall. At the same time the General Delegate diplomatically covered himself by suggesting to Robert Courrier that he had to have more information underscoring the potential importance of the research accomplished. Courrier told him to simply re-read the three notes he had presented to the academy. His matter-of-fact, yet terse, come back then elicited his invitation to a full-dress meeting of scientific experts at the Institute for Scientific Cancer Research. In this short historical account we obviously cannot go into the ins and outs of what transpired at this meeting or any of the many similar meetings which followed it. A paragraph in a brilliant book, four years in the writing, by the courageous Bordeaux journalist, Jean-Michel Graille and entitled: Dossier Priore, A New Pasteu r Affair (of which this account is but a tenuous synopsis) must suffice to pointedly characterize the nature of the problem in its most general sense. Writes Graille: \"To read what follows in this chapter might well seem tedious: an enumeration of names and titles, the content of a debate held at an administrative meeting, personal remarks by one ranking personage or another, exchanges of letters following the meeting itself and the official report which came out of it. Tedious but indispensible for not a few reasons. It is important to know who were the participants at this meeting and what of these participants each"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 356 was trying to represent. It is important to know how such scientific meetings go about their business at the 'top level,' And, finally, it is important to learn about and to understand, in the particular case of the Priore Affair, the behavior and reactions of all concerned. A reading of all this could be difficult (and it won't be the only such passage in this book) yet it is necessary to understand the essence of the dossier in order to be able to create for oneself as clear and well- motivated a personal opinion about it as to subsequently be able to discuss it, or to hear it discussed, with a thorough knowledge of the facts.\" In this single paragraph, Jean-Michel Graille has, in my opinion, pointed to both the nub and the difficulty in getting at the essence of the real facts behind a case such as that of Priore's that are so important to its proper understanding, an understanding which can be painted against the backdrop of the history of science and the backdrop of human pettiness and maliciousness or human courage and magnanimity. One of the participants, Professor Andre Lwoff, soon to become n Nobel Laureate for his work in virology, was violently against the meeting's central issue: namely, whether or not funds should be spent to build a new and better Priore machine. Not only did Lwoff aver that the three notes presented to the Academy never should have been published, but he also opined that since all the work was done, not on spontaneously generated but on grafted cancers, the effects of the machine were hardly impressive. He later added in writing that 1) the patents issued to Priore for his device were nothing but a web of nonsense, 2) the machine itself could never be duplicated based on any description given for it by its inventor and, in a repetition of his oral remarks, 3) the fact that only cancer grafts were experimented with was nothing to shout about. He strangely added that because the animals who had been irradiated subse- quently were able to entirely reject new grafts, the whole phenome- non offered no proof that cancer cells could be killed while healthy cells were not. The whole thing came down to a question of immunity, he said, as if that were not of the greatest possible importance. To which, in due course, Guerin and Riviere replied: \"It has been claimed that our experiments are valueless because they were carried out on grafted tumors and that other therapeutic measures were known to get rid of such tumors and their metastases. We defy those persons who have made such affirmations to prove, with the use of such other measures, that animals infected with T-8 tumors can be cured at a percentage rale identical to those obtained by using the device which Monsieur Priore has developed.\" Not a soul has responded to this challenge, then or since."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"357 The Case of Antoine Priore A second cancer expert at the meeting, a woman of great influence, resorted only to the cavil that the experiments had been of doubtful quality since none of the animals had been weighed. The fact that those same animals had survived normally lethal cancers seemed not to have weighed with her. There were many more observations of the same ilk. They seem atrociously paltry, trifling and picayune coming from professionals who, if they no longer believed in the Hippocratic oath to which they once swore, are considered by the public in general, and by cancer patients in particular, at least to be concerned with seeing what a little light on the problem might reveal before extinguishing it, as Professor Courrier expressed it. At the same time, we must not forget Priore's decidedly difficult personality. He was an inventor determined at all costs that his invention be developed for the benefit of humanity, yet anxious that that same humanity not steal it from him. As author Graille puts it, \"His conceptions and attitude directly or indirectly conditioned the overall essence of this affair. Full of enthusiasm, from the very day he discovered that the ray he had developed had a curative effect on a cancerous cat, he developed a single-minded fixation on cancer One could understand and sympathize with him on this score. Here he is, a little Italian immigrant without money or means, and he is going to offer the world a cancer cure. He is so convinced that he wants to move ahead to doing just that. He will never understand or accept the exigencies of Science or Medicine. For him, experiments, controls, verifications and parallel research are a waste of precious time. 'I've made machines which cure cancer. Take them and treat cancer patients. Don't bother with the rest.' Such would be a summation of his point of view.\" Through the efforts of persons kindly disposed to the inventor, this point of view was softened and he came finally to understand the- necessity for what has been called scientific rigor, on the other hand. another aspect of his character never changed an iota. This was his determination to preserve the secret of his invention, motivated first of all by his unshakeable desire that it be developed in Bordeaux, the city of his adoption, for the citizens of that city. Deeply rooted was his belief that if he made his secret public, the machine would be taken from the Bordeaux region and further developed by Parisians, those who considered themselves to be in the penthouse of the scientific edifice. Once this was accomplished, he would likely not have one more word to say about the matter. Therefore he continued jealously to conserve his secret and put confidence in nobody. As Graille generously concedes, he may well have been right. and adds: \"All his life he had to go up against men, whether scientists"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 358 or industrialists, who had but one idea in their heads: to get to the bottom of the inventor's secret in order to build for themselves a machine which they then could exploit for their own account, for their own glory. Many such 'Priore Machines' were to be actually built more or less surreptitiously or clandestinely. Not one of them ever worked.\" While one might easily accuse Priore of a limited view, the horizons of the researchers themselves were certainly not as broad us they might have been. Those involved in bio-medicine were content with the results produced by the machine, the workings of which were of no concern to them. A black box, as it were, emitted a ray that definitely affected experimental animals. At the same time, as researchers specifically interested in the cancer problem, they never gave a thought to what the Priore Ray might accomplish in the wider clinical domain of other afflictions. As for the physicists, they were seemingly not up to the task of comprehending a complex radiation that had miraculously sprung, as from the head of Zeus, out of the intuition of a man they considered to be an undereducated and all but illiterate gadgeteer. Still others, whether physicists, biologists, doctors of medicine or specialists in a dozen other fields, were willing to throw the baby out even before it went into the bath water. In their eyes Priore was just a nobody. Behind the scenes, many of these scientists resorted to using the press to achieve their own ends. Thus, the chief medical chronicler for Le Monde (the French New York Times), herself a doctor of medicine, was led to write outright lies about the Priore Affair— specifically and falsely stating that cancer patients had been treated with the Priore Ray in the clinic of Professor Lachapele in Bordeaux with not only negative, but disastrous, results. On the other hand, a journalist for another leading Paris daily, Le Figaro, scrupulously conscious of his responsibility to fairly report what was going on, aptly wrote: \"We would like to see at least one thorny point clarified as soon as possible. Several years ago P'rofessor Biraben of the Bordeaux Medical Faculty (who at that time had not become a ranking professor) was involved with the Priore device. According to certain reports from medical circles, his results seemed, even at that time, to have been already quite positive on small animals and he seems to have written a report to that effect, He was advised by highly placed authorities \"to keep quiet\" and stop talking about this affair. If this turns out to be true, it would be a veritable medical scandal to be judged in the harshest terms.\" Could one have put it more succinctly? The foregoing is to present something of the flavor of what was transpiring in the wide world far removed from the laboratory of"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"359 The Case ofAntoine Priore Priore who, at the time unaware of it, was revelling in the fact that his machine had been successfully used by high-ranking French cancerologists and its results reported in three separate notes to the Academy of Sciences. His courage was also more than buoyed by the arrival on the scene of the commercial director of a large French industrial firm specializing in the intricacies of manufacturing glass components. This man had heard that Priore needed a large tube that was beyond all existing norms and perhaps did not exist anywhere in the world. This tube, it can be stated, contained a rare gas, neon, which when excited into a plasma, seemed somehow to convert the various electromagnetic inputs into a single Priore Ray which surged from the business end of the tube. In the tube were an anode and cathode. Peculiar to the anode was that it had to rotate to produce the desired biological effects and this is but one of the anomalies in Priore's equipment which physicists and bio-physicists have to this day been unable to explain. The manufacturing company, a subsidiary of the internationally known company, Saint Gobain, was looking for a new product. The commercial director thought the new tube might fill the bill, particu- larly if it could be adapted to a machine that might ultimately cure cancer, a product that indubitably would have an enormous market across the world. There were plenty of problems with regard to the tube, notably those of its large dimension, its resistance and its conductability. When the tube was finally made, it now seemed that. Priore would have to explain his discoveries to the scientists of the company that had made it. One of these was sent to elicit such an explanation but was, so to speak, \"shot down in flames\" by Priore. So a second attempt was made by Ivan Peyches, a senior executive of the company, and president of the Society of Civil Engineers of France, who made a detailed investigation of the device. His reports were subsequently lost, but there remained an article he published in a leading French journal, Sciences and Technics, a short time before his death in 1978. It bore the intriguing title: \"What Are So- Called Paranormal Phenomena?\" In it the engineer wrote: \"There was so great an accumulation of components capable of having some kind of action, and being unable to work separately, that the results of measurement were limited to proving that there were no specific rays that issued from the tube (Priore talked about canal rays), no more than there were any X rays. On the other hand one could detect a magnetic field which was the end result of a field proper to the tube and of the magnetic field of a solenoid that constituted the experimental chamber, an electromag- netic field with a frequency of 16 megacycles (19 meters) and a high"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 360 frequency field (metric waves), the whole being pulsed at a very low frequency of an order of one per second. It was impossible, in such an imbroglio, to determine what was necessary and what was suffi- cient. Priore maintained that the simultaneous action of his various generators was indispensible to achieving his effect.\" Peyches then went on to relate how he tried to persuade Priore to offer a more precise definition of his thinking about the workings of his device. He wrote the inventor: \"At this point, I would say that all reticence on your part, which in your eyes would be justified by the fear of seeing yourself partially dispossessed of your work, would be of far greater detriment to you than any safeguard of your interests. Moreover, since it has become a question involved in public health, you are no longer entirely your own boss...you absolutely must bring all this to the clear light of day and I don't believe you can do it alone...You must supply all the characteristics so that third parties can reproduce your results.\" Then, he concluded by citing the words of an academician: \"Many phenomena are rejected by the scientific world because they are considered irrational: But it is not B proof of scientific honesty to refuse a priori to try, out of homage to truth, to have a look at them and perhaps to understand them. Will Science one day be able to abandon its taboos?\" It was Peyches' final conclusion that, in the end, Priore was a man of genius who knew absolutely nothing about what occurred in his machine from the scientific point of view. The company which he represented no longer exists since it was bought out by the American firm of Corning Glass. Industrial interest in the Priore device was not limited to the Saint Gobain subsidiary. Next into the lists was a company in Anguouleme, Leroy-Somer, which specialized in electric motors, generators and later was to branch out into solar power. Its presi- dent, Georges Chavanes, took the initiative to write to Priore in 1965 that his company was interested in providing some of the complex electrical equipment needed by the inventor, more particularly high- powered generators, on the condition that Priore move his operation to the company seat at Anguouleme. When the inventor categori- cally refused, Chavanes tentatively agreed to build a factory to manufacture the Priore device in Bordeaux itself. The alliance between Leroy-Somer and Priore, shaky at best, lasted two years and blew up on Holy Thursday of 1967. The period was a stormy one for both parties to the agreement. Priore did his best to convince Chavanes to commit himself to building a huge machine with a magnetic gauss strength of 10,000 gauss. In the end he got one that put out only 920 gauss, not much stronger than the machine he had already built which put out 620 gauss. Since the field"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"361 The Case ofAntoine Priore of action increased with the gauss strength, Priore reasoned that a machine of literally behemoth size would be able to irradiate the whole, or every part, of a human cancer victim lying on a stretcher, whereas the smaller machines had been effective only for small animals or for treating a limited portion of the human body. Chavanes and his company were aware that it would be a tremendous financial burden to contemplate building the larger machine. So they went ahead with plans for the smaller one while at, the same time putting great pressure on Priore himself to make him feel that he was the least important cog in a new gear, in fact that his status was reduced to being a simple employee of Leroy-Somer. In Graille's estimation, this lack of psychological finesse on Chavanes' part constituted what he called \"the blackest pages in the Dossier Priore.\" Even the smaller machine was to cost about half a million dollars, a price which today, due to inflation, could be tripled or quadrupled. During a stage in which an intermediate machine was designed by the chief Leroy-Somer engineer, Ribeau, a machine that never did function properly, Chavanes all but forced Priore, who was heavily in debt, to sign a contract which was falsified. The falsifica tion was a matter of one word which was changed in the contract. In a phrase reading that an exclusive license of patents, and subse- quent patent modifications, would accrue to the company \"for all countries solely for therapy on cancers concerning animals and humans,\" a word was inserted by hand so that the phrase read. \"concerning particularly animals and humans\" implying that other uses of the machine, whatever they might turn out to be, would also accrue to the company. This one word change was amended on Priore's copy of the contract by calling the word \"particularly\" a \"nullified word,\" but on Chavanes' copy it was called an \"added word.\" Leroy-Somer believed it was sufficiently well positioned in the driver's seat to be able to deal on behalf of Priore himself with the French governmental institutions, mainly the General Delegation, concerned with the funding of the new machine. When Priore learned of Chavanes' contact with the General Delegation he wrote a letter informing it that no one had the right to deal in his name. Nor did Chavanes even attempt to cut the Saint Gobain subsidiary, which alone could supply the tube, key to the device's functioning, in on the government funding. In the meantime, no less a figure than Professor Kastler, soon to win the Nobel Prize in Physics, came down from Paris to inspect. the existing Priore device. He brought with him Delmon, who, we recall, had worked with Berlureau on the first animal experiments and who"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 362 NOW, it turned out, was trying to build his own version of a Priore device on the sly without telling Priore. Kastler's bringing Delmon with him to Priore's lab so angered Robert Courrier that he told the physicist he had committed a real gaffe. He also convinced Kastler that Leroy-Somer should build a machine with a power of at least 5000 gauss, but Chavanes refused. There seemed to be no harmony of outlook between the leading industrialist concerned, on the one hand, and the top physical and biological scientists on the other. While all these, and many more, peripatetics were proceeding, Priore's sister in Italy came down with cancer. Beside himself with g rief, Priore informed all concerned to commit themselves either to building an intermediate machine correctly, under his supervision or, better, the 5000-gauss machine, and to do this in time to save his sister, or he would wash his hands of the entire matter. Confronted with this ultimatum, the company began to work round the clock to perfect the intermediate machine but engineers involved, believing themselves to be more adroit with respect to its design than Priore, left out a host of what, to them, were unnecessary components. The result was that when the machine was first put to trial, most of the components burned out or otherwise failed, and the machine itself became a useless pile of rubble. Shortly thereafter, Priore's sister died of cancer. Her grief- s tricken brother went into what amounted to total isolation, unwill- ing to talk to a soul. The whole Priore affair might have ended at that point, in the early part of 1967, were it not for the entry onto the scene of a key figure, Professor Raymond Pautrizel. Born on 3 June 1916 in Basseterre, capital of the French Carribean island of Guadeloupe, at forty years of age he was on the Faculty of Medicine at Bordeaux. He so on became known, world-wide, as the \"father of parasitological im- munity,\" a title he never accepted, saying that, if others had awarded it, it was simply because \"he had searched through old scientific publications to find ideas that were as valid for modern research as they were forgotten by modern researchers.\" And he later was q uoted as adding: \"It is really too bad that researchers today don't pause from time to tome to dig into studies made by their predeces- sors, some of which were performed even decades ago!\" Professor Pautrizel was awarded the first academic chair in France for immunology, and later a special unit was created for him for parasitological immunology, a subject which is both simple and complex. The simple part involves the fact that various immunologi- cal techniques can be applied to diagnosing specific parasites that have invaded an organism in order to develop preventative actions a gainst them via vaccines, or curative actions via serums."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"363 The Case ofAntoine Priore When invaded by parasites, organisms react by creating anti- bodies, specific substances aimed at killing the invaders also known as antigens. These antibodies are liberated, like an attacking army, into the blood. Simple enough so far. The complexity arises because the defending army, the parasites, don't just lie down and die under the attack. They are capable of modifying their \"personalities,\" as it were, and of changing various of their characteristics such that the mechanisms that the host uses to recognize, or detect, the invaders are invalidated. Thus, the substance which an organism would secrete to destroy an invader A becomes incapable of recognizing A, now become A-l, and therefore incapable of destroying it. The organism at this point seems to realize it has to create a different substance to rid itself of its antagonist but, in the mean- time, the metamorphized parasite is getting on with its assigned destructive task. Alternatively, the parasite has another capability: that of itself liberating substances which can annul or annihilate the organism's overall defense system. A sort of \"in the blood\" version of Star Wars is going on at the microscopic level. The study and classification of the substances - - call them weapons - - emitted by parasite-attacked organisms allows for the establishment, in turn, of batteries of tests to define the exact nature of the parasites themselves in order to come up with an appropriate therapy or counter-weapon. This then, is the essence of parisitological immunology, Ray- mond Pautrizel's area of research. He specialized on a particularly lethal parasite known as trypanosome, the scourge of tropical third- world countries where, in one form, it causes sleeping sickness in animals and humans, in another, equine syphillis, in still othera, other afflications. Over the years, during which he produced a small library of literature on the problem (known mostly to specialists in countries where that problem is acute), Pautrizel and his team discovered, among other things, that the trypanosome can modify itself, again and again, up to 101 times over a period as short as only three weeks. Even before his work on trypanosomes, Pautrizel, back in 1949, was one of the first researchers to discover what is known as ambivalence in drugs, notably histamine. Histamine is a substance which is secreted by an organism as a defense mechanism but if oversecreted by certain cells circulating in the blood, it becomes virulently noxious, mainly by overdialating blood vessels, thus making them permeable to water and leading to edema and even death. This process occurs, for instance, in some human beings who are highly susceptible and over-reactive to bee or wasp stings. Pautrizel's research on the noxious aspects of histamine led to"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 364 his finding that the same substance, applied in requisite small doses, is extremely important to the defense system of the organism. Today he stresses the notion of ambivalence in many areas of his work and characterizes it as \"a key to the biology of the day after tomorrow.\" To finish with the background on Pautrizel, before bringing him on stage in the Priore drama, it may be added that only a few years ago, at a formal reception for him attended by the medical elite of France, he was given a Basque makila, an iron-bound honorific cane of sculptured wood, in tribute to his work. On it was the incised inscription: \"Sometimes to heal, often to alleviate, always to con- sole,\" an epithet that perfectly characterizes a medical doctor im- bued with that kind of rare compassion that marked Pautrizel's character. When Robert Courrier sent Madame Colonge to Bordeaux, it was Pautrizel whom he asked to provide her with every assistance. In this way, Pautrizel was first introduced to Priore and his device. After witnessing the results obtained with it he was to say: \"What stupified me, and led me to ponder the question, was to see the control animals die from their tumors in 3 weeks, while at the same time I could observe that the tumors in the animals under treatment were literally melting away and the same animals were taken back to Courrier's lab at the College de France in Paris in perfect health.\" AS a result of his thinking about the problem, Pautrizel came to the belief that the machine, however it worked, did not exert any action at all to kill cancer cells but, through as yet unexplained mecha- nisms, stimulated the afflicted organisms to provide themselves with new immunological weapons that could overpower the cancer cells. To shed light on this problem, Pautrizel proposed the simple expedient of experimenting, not on cancer-infested animals, but on in vitro cultures of cancer cells. He made this proposition to both French and British cancerologists but they were convinced that the Priore device had to be actually killing cancer cells themselves,. They could not see the point that, if the machine did not kill cancer cells, then it was doing something else to the body to allow it, and not the machine, to do that job. Pautrizel's involvement with the British was the result of a team being sent from England to experiment with cancer mice with the Priore Ray. What happened cannot be related in this brief resume except to say that, out of a lack of understanding on the part of certain British cancer experts and malicious conniving on the part of one member of the cancer \"aristocracy\" in Paris, the experiments were put under a cloud. It was alleged that mice had been substi- tuted somewhere during their long round-trip voyage between"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"365 The Case ofAntoine Priore England and Bordeaux to make it look as if a failed experiment had been successful. This did not prevent Sir Alexander Haddow, chief of the prestigious Chester Beatty Research Institute for Cancer from stating, at a meeting in Paris, that the Priore machine had been indubitably effective on the English mice and supporting Pautrizel's idea that experiments should forthwith be done to see if the Priore Ray had any effect on cancer cells in vitro. Haddow's suggestion backing Pautrizel's recommendation fell on deaf ears. Because of the emotional turmoil and rancor with respect to cancer that had so long surrounded Priore and the workings of his machine, Pautrizel suggested that it be tried in a completely new area, one he knew so well, namely on afflictions caused by the trypanosomic pathogen. Before these could get underway, however, someone had to persuade the still desolate Priore to return to work. Pautrizel, known to those really concerned with and knowledgeable about the potential of the Italian's invention, at last was able to convince the inventor to cooperate and get back into harness. This ho did with that rare combination of diplomatic tact and warm human sympathy with which only the Pautrizels of this world are gifted. In the meantime, Riviere had gone on to implant new 347 tumor grafts in rats previously cured of 347 tumors. When none of the tumors developed, that result added one more argument to back Pautrizel's idea that the machine was, in fact, affecting the immu- nological defense system of the animals. However, when Riviere tried the same procedure with the T-8 tumors, his animals died. This lead to the conclusion that the immunity acquired by the animals to lymphoblastic lymphosarcoma 347 was specific to that tumor. When a note on this research was sent, again through Courrier's good offices, to the Academy, for the first time, it strangely omitted from the listing of the participating researchers the name of Antoine Priore. It seemed that Riviere had been taken to task by fellow cancerologists who believed that Priore was nothing but a naive bumpkin or, worse, a swindler. They had warned him against pub- lishing any papers with which Priore's name would be associated This rank injustice and lack of fair play again sent Priore into a fit of despondency and depression from which he could only be wilth drawn by those subtleties involved in Pautrizel's sympathetic and friendly counsel. On 25 July 1966, another note was sent to the Academy filed for the first time not under the rubric Cancerology but under the rubric Immunology. It was entitled \"Influence of Associated Elec- tromagnetic and Magnetic Fields on the Immunity of Mice Infected with Trypanosoma equiperdum.\" The conclusion read: \"The treat- ment allows the organism to rid itself of parasites even when these"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 366 have invaded it in a most intensive way.... There is an enhancement of both the specific and aspecific factors of immunity.\" Thus, for the first time, the field of research shifted from the narrower field of cancer to the much vaster domain of immunology. And, for the first time, Pautrizel's name appeared as the senior author on the paper. It also appeared that, for the first time, there should no longer be any problem about experimenting with the I'riore machine. Such was not the case. Still complicating the whole issue was the fact that Priore himself was using different setting to produce different varieties of radiation depending upon his own intuitive evaluation of the par- ticular biological experiments being run with his machine. He would never reveal the nature of these settings. At this point there appeared on the scene a new researcher who became Pautrizel's loyal ally, a young woman, Pierette Chateau- Reynaud Duprat. During her work in Paris, she had learned of the Priore controversy, and, against the stern advice of mentors senior by many years to her in the cancer hierarchy, she came to Bordeaux to meet Pautrizel and learn more about the research. Her work, performed over many years, is too detailed for presen- tation here but it led to important conclusions. One was that the Priore Ray had no direct effect on the trypanosomes themselves but stimulated and reinforced the defense mechanism of the infested organisms, allowing them to reject the parasitical influence with an effect so durable that they were no longer subject to this influence even after treatment stopped. Another conclusion was even more important and involved, in part, British research. It pertained to the effects of the machine on both allografts or those made between two different individuals of the same species, and isografts, or those made between two different individuals of the same genetic line having in common antigens that were characterized by what is called the same histocompatability. The conclusion was that not only was the rejection of allografts acce lerated by the Priore Ray but that isografts were also rejected. This meant, in sum, that the ray stimulated not only the defense mechanisms of the organism but also, and more importantly, its re cognition mechanisms. In the case of an isograft, this allowed the recognition of weak antigens that were not recognized in non- irradiated animals. In other terms, where at first the anti-aircraft batteries could not shoot down the aircraft because they could not see them.now they could shoot them down because they could see them. In immunological terms, the ray affected both humoral and cellural, both specific and aspecific, immunity. Here we must return to the mystery of the settings on the device."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"367 The Case ofAntoine Priore As a result of the new experimentation it seemed that, depending on those very settings, the active ray, complex as it was, could have either similar, totally different, or diametrically opposed effects. Thus it was not a question of a ray having universal effects — a kind of magic bullet capable of killing any target — but of multiple radiations which, due to the complexities in Priore's personal ma- keup, have unfortunately yet to be sorted out and explained. Thus, the machine originally designed by Priore, called the P-l when it put out a wave length of from 19-21 meters, had a radical effect on certain animal cancers, on cellular defense mechanisms, and finally, but not universally, on organisms infested with Try- panosoma equiperum, (hereinafter called T.e.). A second machine, dubbed the P-2, was at first not able to produce these frequencies. What it did put out was a frequency of 17 meters that was universally effective against T.e. and seemed to act. not on the cellular, but the humoral, defense mechanisms. The rejection of grafts depends on the cellular defense mechanisms, which partially explains why Pautrizel when using the P-2 machine, selected the T.e. vector, as it is called in microbiology, just because this creature is fought by the organism's humoral defense system. Consequently, the bio-effects that were successfully attained depend on the varying, not to say quixotic, nature of the radiation At one point Pautrizel actually did experiments on animals infected with plasmodia — the vector for malaria which attacks red cells - and found that the settings used were effective while never learning exactly what they were or the exact nature of the radiation. Further more, Priore himself maintained that over the years he had success fully treated cases of human tuberculosis but, again, never revealed which frequencies had been used to achieve this. Several more notes were sent to the academy on the successful work performed with the Priore Ray on animals affected with T.e. But the central issue remained: how to find out exactly how the- machine worked. It fell, not to civilian scientists, but to those in the- French army service to attempt, at this point, to work out the problem. The army service brought into the picture was the DRME (an acronym which translates as Administration for Research and Test Methods), to which Pautrizel had sent a request for funds in 1968. This request was the subject of a meeting at which were present three of the top names in French science, one representing biology, the second physics and the third, medical physics. The latter two turned in extremely unfavorable reports recommending that no money be wasted on the problem. The biologist, however, turned in a most favorable report and, despite the fact that he was in the"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 368 minority, his opinion won the day. As remarkable as was this victory, it was even more stunning and incredible given the fact that this biologist was the same Andre Lwoff who had so adamantly opposed the Priore research a couple of years previously. Lwoff had summoned the courage to completely reverse himself only after he sent one of his most trusted colleagues to do secret experiments with the Priore Ray on mice injected with peroxydase (an antigenic solution) to see if they would produce a higher level of antibodies than non-irradiated animals. This they did so well that Lwoff became convinced that the Priore Ray caused an extremely important increase in immune reactions. These results were never published because, before the experiments could be repeated to be absolutely sure of their results, the machine suffered one of its many interminable breakdowns. The DRME report was at length, and in length, issued but not publicly since it was protected by a military classification. However, a synthesis of it was finally published in November 1979 by Herbert Gossot, Secretary General for the French Association for Bioelectro- magnetism, under the title: \"A Scientific Balance Sheet on the Priore Ray.\" Its contents were as follows: \"The two physicists assigned by the army made a complete analysis of the electromagnetic radiations and magnetic fields acti- vated by the Priore device. They thus determined the spectrum of frequencies which the device emitted. They showed particularly that frequencies in the visible light and infrared range had no biological effect; that there were no X-rays or Y-rays; and that the pulsed ultra- high frequency electromagnetic wave was modulated in amplitude to that of a high-frequency wave. They did a topographic survey of the respective intensities of the various magnetic and electromag- netic fields in the experimental plane of the device. In particular, they determined the spatial repartition in this plane of the density of the strength of the ultra-high frequency wave. They showed that its value was very weak and that it could not produce any kind of overall significant thermal effect imputable to the hyperfrequency ray. Finally, and most importantly, by using what they had learned about these repartitions, they demonstrated a clear correlation between the biological effects obtained and the intensity of the hyperfrequency ray. What they actually observed was that, on the biological model used, i.e. experimental trypanosomosis of the mouse, there was a diminution of the rate of evolution of the parasitemia that was proportional to the strength of the hyperfre- qu ency wave. To quote them: 'These experiments of correlation are of certain interest: they confirm, if there is still any need of so doing, the"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"369 The Case ofAntoine Priore biological efficacy of this device.\" The two physicists, Bottreau and Berteaus, are still interested in rebuilding a Priore device with which additional biological re- search could go forward. At the same time they suggested to admin- istrative bodies in French science the creation of a special laboratory for bioelectromagnetism to fund more work, a suggestion in which Professor Pautrizel concurred. No action was taken and their report was kept under wraps. In a note they presented to the Academy of Sciences on their investigation, they were not allowed to include the names of the laboratories where they worked: in the case of one, the CNRS Magnetic Laboratory at Bellevue near Paris, and of the other, the Laboratory of Ultra-Hertzian Optics and Talence near Bor- deaux. Why? Because the directors of these laboratories did not want any mud in the Priore affair to be spattered on them. The next experiment done by Pautrizel was on rabbits whose testicles had been so seriously affected by trypanosomes as to be almost entirely destroyed. After radiation the same testicles took on their normal histological appearance and the rabbits, able to procre- ate again, in no way abstained from their newly regained ability. This implied the complete regeneration of an organ that had all but completely degenerated. Yet journalists, who sought out truths about the Priore affair in Paris from high officials they believed would know best about what was going on, continued to be led astray. For example, an American scientific reporter, writing in the Saturday Review of Science in 1973 saw fit to state: \"It is really a question of a mystical problem that has little to do with science.\" He was quoting Professor Bader, a man who for 15 years held top administrative posts in science that could have allowed him to back the Priore research with all the funding necessary to its accomplishment. At the time Graille's book came out, Bader issued a book of his own about the Priore affair which offers no real idea of what was involved. When I asked several people in France why Bader had written the book, they were unaware of Bader's inmost motivation. Machinations continued to swirl about the case over the next several years. Behind-the-scenes intrigues, distorted accounts in the press, lethargic attitudes on the part of administrative officials who would not take responsibility to cut an increasingly tight Gordian knot, outright fear of various personalities to become too deeply implicated lest they lose their jobs - - all these, and more, continued their daily round in an atmosphere of \"Business AS Usual,\" and \"Don't Risk Your Neck.\" To get to the nexus of the situation, we have but to cite the observation of one of the few perspicacious journalists who, in the"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 370 prestigious scientific monthly, Sciences and Life, wrote: \"The physicists are convinced that the effective Priore Ray is very complex but to analyze this further some things first have to be made clear. One is to raise the suspicion that has surrounded Monsieur Priore with a fabulous acretion of misunderstandings, insults and accusa- tions of being a swindler over many years. What is needed is a veritable national effort to act effectively and to act rapidly.\" Over the next two years the decision-making process of the French government lumbered its way along until it was finally decided to back the construction of a powerful machine. This deci- sion was not favorably accepted in many quarters. As Le Monde would comment: \"The decision was made in spite of the disapproval of many scientists. When money is tight, one should pay particular attention to how it is being spent. Such seems not always to be the case. A credit of some $3.5 million francs (or about a million dollars) has just been accorded to finance the construction of a new Priore machine.\" The scientists to whom the article referred were in a rage. They understood, at this juncture, that the only way to put an end to the affair was to eliminate Pautrizel who, because of the very success he was having with his research, was seen as a dangerous competitor that might even become one of the top figures in medicine and science on a national, or perhaps, on a world scale. Indeed, it was learned that Professor Courrier had gone to the length of sending a report on Pautrizel's behalf to the Nobel Committee in 1979. To make a long story short, the large powerful machine, the M- 600, was built but a huge tube in it, after functioning for about a week, exploded. Due to the galloping inflation of the 1970's, to replace it would have cost another million dollars. The money was not forthcoming. In the meantime Pautrizel, ever experimenting with the still functioning smaller machine, was to discover new facts. Mice with their spleens cut out, for example, also could survive injections of T.e. The Priore Ray had important implications for Arterio-sclerosis, since it effected lipid modifications in rabbits given a dietary regime high in cholesterol. This research, published in another note in the Academy Proceedings, instead of being warmly received, only irritated the cardiological fraternity which felt, as some of its members put it, \"trapped\" by Pautrizel's efforts. One particularly virulent opponent was Professor Bricault, Dean of the Bordeaux Medical School who, as late as 1980, was telling his own students that the published results were a farce and had never been obtained. The students, who carried out a special investigation of the matter on their own, were able to judge what a"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"371 The Case ofAntoine Priore farce their own medical dean might represent. L'Express, the Time magazine of France, read by at least half the population of French intellectuals, had the gall to compare the results of the Priore research to those of the infamous Trofim Lysenko of the Russia of Stalin's day. Haughtily L'Express added: \"Today Priore's defenders explain that his machine has not only cured cancer but, in all probability, altered the immunological characteristics of mice. Were this, in fact, so, all the immunologists, all the geneticists of the world would unite to affirm that a machine capable of changing the genetic patrimony is the discovery of the century, far more important than the atomic bomb or the conquest of the moon. Unfortunately, the history of the whole thing has never been properly elucidated.\" The article was illustrated with photos distortedly selected to convince viewers that the Priore machine was as serious and effective as the one that purportedly brought Frank- enstein to life. In this poisonous atmosphere the slow work of building the M- 600 went forward. To give anyone who was not there a feeling for this endeavor we may now cite verbatim a passage from Graille's book: \"The construction and assembly of the prototype —the M-600, that of highest power and variable parameters — were fraught with many uncertainties and delays on the one hand and, on the other, were marked by the stamp of Antoine Priore's sparkling genius. \"To go from an apparatus that developed 1,240 gauss applied over an effective area of some 20 centimeters, to one developing 5000 gauss over an area of 60 centimeters means to take on an extremely risky technical and technological wager. Electrical, mechanical and glass-blowing specialists plunged into the unknown. They had to conceive, make, adapt and put together all the various myriad components almost haphazardly with no precise technical study being previously available. Priore's stubbornness forced them to take on a trial-and-error manufacturing \"gimmickry\" without prece- dent. As the thing was put together and preliminary tests made, it became clear that many of the components were unsuitable and that they would have to be modified or replaced. The tube itself, made of pyrex, 60 centimeters in diameter, and 6 meters tall, had to be replaced twice after it imploded. In fact, practically everything had to be reconsidered or readapted. \"Everything\" meant the parts going to make up a generator of 50 tons in weight. For example, the coil which created the magnetic field: 5.5 tons with 11 miles of copper wire. For example, the numerous cooling circuits which stabilized the thermal equilibrium of the generator and its environment or, additionally, the circuits governing command, control regulation and selection — 6 tons of electrical cables of which 15 miles were of"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"The Case of Antoine Priore 372 tele-command wiring. \"Priore astonished everyone. Breakdown after breakdown, inci- dent after incident, it was he alone who showed what to do next, indicated the proper steps to take, the right settings to adopt, the right way to assemble the components: He was virtually building his machine by himself, nursing its construction along day after day, all the engineers' studies and efforts actually, and ultimately, serving only as a preliminary attempt, a sketch as it were. When Priore made his presence felt, things began working.\" Then.... after the machine was built: \"The part of the entire apparatus to generate electricity was set up on a provisional basis. It was so noisy that, while functioning, it woke up the whole neighborhood. The number of experiments had therefore to be curtailed so that the machine would not be used at night. And, all at once, everything came to a halt. The Faraday cage, shielding and isolating Priore's apparatus, was torn and fissured by the shock of the cement pilings that were being sunk into the ground all around to hold up the building under construction. This allowed high- frequency waves to escape which disturbed radio broadcasts emitted by local radio stations, the army, and civilian aircraft for miles around.\" Nevertheless during the week or ten days that the machine was in good operation the results of experiments performed with it were more than formidable. First of all, it allowed for as many as forty experiments to be performed on some 280 animals in a remarkably short period of time. Among the discoveries made were: The ray emitted provided the treated animals with an extremely strong immunitary response. Animals whose immune defenses had been attentuated by an immuno-depressant were able to overcome the effects of injected parasites but relapsed a few days later. One could therefore conclude their immune response was much weaker than those normally infested and treated. Newborn animals, whether treated or not, developed a marked parasitemia leading to their deaths. At the time of death, the parasites had the same antigenic structure as those of the innoculum which thus implied that they had met with no defense at all in the infected organisms. This also proved that the Priore Ray did not act directly on the parasites themselves but only by way of an increase in the immune defense system of the organisms. The newborn animals succumbed to their parasitemia because their immune sytem was not yet sufficiently developed to be stimulated by the P- Ray. The phenomenon of a stimulation of the immune defenses was demonstrated by the fact that animals which had received soluble antigens developed, after being irradiated, a level of antibodies far"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"373 The Case ofAntoine Priore superior to the controls. These and other conclusions were the object of notes presented to the Academy of Sciences by Pautrizel and his team in 1978. Even before, at a colloquium held in Antwerp, Belgium devoted to African human trypanosomiasis, the same team had offered the conclusion that the stimulation of the immune defense system that allowed organisms to throw off the effects of trypanosomiasis had to be very significant in that all attempts to try to effect such stimulation through immuno-stimulants as well known as B.C.G., or Coryne- bacterium granulosum, had led neither to the cure produced by the Priore Ray, nor to any prolongation of the infected animals' lives, nor even to the slightest modification in the evolution of the Trypano- somiasis. These three scientific papers did little for the cancerologists who read them except to exacerbate their urge to oppose the Priore research, if not to arouse their outright hatred for the principal experimenter, Raymond Pautrizel. Could this have been because, for over 20 years, the same cancerologists had been working in vain to provoke in cancerous organisms immuno-stimulative reactions by intensively and successively vaccinating them with B.C.G.? Many others had been life-long apostles of chemotherapeutic cocktails of all sorts, or life-destroying ionizing radiations, or, what more re- cently has become the fashion, of applying the two methods in endless combination. For this reason, they saw Priore and Pautrizel as nothing more than spoil-sports who had to be destroyed. One of the opening shots in this campaign was a letter received by Pautrizel to inform him that his request for funds to continue his research through Unit-89, a unit that had been specially set up for him to direct, had been denied. It took many months of investigation for Pautrizel to learn that the real reason for the refusal was because of his work with Priore. Next Pautrizel was informed that his appointment as director of the same research unit would be extended for only two years, whereas the normal extension for similar units was five years. A third insult came when Pautrizel tried to win a post within his unit for a high-ranking military physician, who had been his student and who had decided to quit the military in order to participate in the fascinating research prosecuted by his mentor. Pautrizel's request for funds to pay this physician, who all his life had been working on tropical medicine closely associated with problems of trypanosomia sis, were refused four times in a row with no cogent reason given. The physician, who in the meantime had volunteered his time without pay, finally became so emotionally overwrought that he gave up his"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"The Case ofAntoine Priore 374 medical career and retired to the countryside where he gave himself over to alcohol. Then Pautrizel tried to get a salaried post for another of his brilliant collaborators (who still works with him). He was told that this man could take up his new functions only if he left Bordeaux. One could go on with many other shocking stories but we will leave it to Graille to conclude: \"Everything possible was done to isolate Pautrizel, to separate him from his collaborators. Every single one of these collaborators saw their careers put in jeopardy, compromised, or broken.\" As a final insult, when the time came again to renew Pautrizel as director of Unit 89, those responsible, not daring to overstep what even they knew to be decent limits by not extending him, simply abolished the unit. And to add injury to that insult, a doctoral thesis that had now been prepared by Priore, and backed not only by Pautrizel but by Nobel Laureate Andre Lwoff himself, was summa- rily refused by the President of the University of Bordeaux. It is perhaps unnecessary to state that the details behind all of this skulduggery could, and did, fill up two chapters of a book and make for the most heart-rending reading imaginable. So what happened next? In the autumn of 1977, Professor Georges Dubourg, one of the leading lights in Bordeaux's company of surgeons and a friend and admirer of Pautrizel's, came to him to say openly and baldly: \"My friend, at the point you've reached, there is only one more way to jolt medical opinion and that is to treat human cancer patients.\" Pautrizel was hesitant, believing his role to he one of continuing with his animal experiments but where would the funds for that come from now? He therefore asked his old mentor, Robert Courrier's advice. Courrier gave the green light. The treat- ments were restricted to terminal cancer patients whose immune defense systems had been disastrously weakened by chemotherapy or radiation or both. At least one of them was totally cured. The other 1ived, without pain, for a period many times longer than predicted by prognosis. Dubourg, Pautrizel and their collaborators wrote up the results and sent them as an official communication to the French Academy of Medicine for publication. The reply they received from that Academy's perpetual secre- tary reads: \"Experts whom we consulted consider that your work does not fall within the jurisdiction of our members and that it would doubtless find an audience more worthy of its purpose in a more specialized society.\" To which Pautrizel formally replied: \"Since two of the four signatories of our note are corresponding members of your Academy, could we not benefit from the remarks and comments made by the committee which saw fit to refuse our paper? And even, if this is not"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"375 The Case ofAntoine Priore too indiscreet a request, to learn the names of the expert members who were consulted which would allow us to get into contact with them directly and to benefit from their singular competence?\" His letter has remained unanswered for four years. There was nothing more to do except one thing which Raymond Pautrizel, as a man of science, had always been careful to avoid: Get a responsible journalist interested in the case, inform him of all possible details, and let him carry the Priore Affair in all its harrowingly loathsome aspects to the broad reading public. That journalist was Jean-Michel Graille. For four years, Graille went about his task, publishing three consecutive long articles in his newspaper Sud-Ouest France and finally the book to which we have referred and of which this presentation is largely a resume. As early as 1980, Graille would write in his newspaper: \"The Priore Affair is simple in essence. It can be reduced to a simple alternative: either the machine developed by Antoine Priore is of no interest and, having shown this, the affair can be considered at an end. Or else the machine is of real and demon- strable medical interest and, if that is officially recognized, he would be allowed to get on with the work. For this dilemma runs the risk, yet again, of being buried under delays and evasions. Beyond all the powers-that-be that have been directly connected to the affair for many years now — the power of finance, the power of medicine, the power of science — perhaps it is now political power with which responsibility lies if it can rise to meet and assume that responsibil- ity through decision.\" That was Graille's statement in 1980. His book which came out four years later ends with the sentence: \"The Dossier Priore thus depends, from here on out, on a decision that must be taken on the very highest level, and imperatively. This responsibility devolves, in last resort, on the chief of state and on him alone. Will he assume it?\" Would the President of the United States? Note added by T.E.B.: Antoine Priore is now dead. His machine has been dismantled. The iron dogma and hatred of electromagnetic medicine by bureaucratic science may have doomed hundreds of mil- lions of humans - - whom Priore's device could have saved - - to bitter, agonizing, and unnecessary deaths. Hitler, Stalin, and Mao com- bined were not responsible for the deaths of so many."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Patents  376 APPENDIX II PATENTS English Translation of the French Patent No. 1,342,772 of Antoine Priore, 7 Oct. 1963. Procedure and Assemblage for Production of Radiation Especially Serviceable for the Treatment of living cells. Brevet d'Invention. P.V. no. 899.414 no. 1.342.772 Classification Internationale: A61 k-H 05 g Procedure and assemblage for production of radiation especially serviceable for the treatment of living cells. Antoine Priore Requested 1 June 1962, 14.52 hours, Paris Released by decree (arrete) of 7 Oct 1963 The invention deals in a general manner with radiation capable of penetrating matter. More exactly, it aims at a procedure and an apparatus making it possible to obtain a combination of radiations of different types able to penetrate matter and especially to pene- trate intimately living organic tissues in order to produce in them certain effects, particularly in human tissues with a view to a therapeutic effect without destroying essential elements such as the enzymes. In conformity with the present invention, one emits in a cavity a stream (rayonnement) of electrically charged particles upon which one superposes electromagnetic radiation of the centimeter wave- length range, the wavelength of which is preferably between 3 cm and 80 cm, and one directs the resulting radiation emerging from the cavity on to the object to be irradiated. This applicant has shown that the penetration and, in particu- lar, the curative effects are very distinctly improved when one gives the electromagnetic radiation a frequency determined as a function of the organ or the tissue to be penetrated or to be treated. For example, a wavelength of 14 cm is suitable for the liver and a wavelength of 19.5 cm for the spleen. Preferably, the stream of charged particles is accelerated in a particle accelerator in such a way as to increase the force of penetra- tion."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"377  Patents The resulting radiation is advantageously applied and directed upon the target, that is to say, upon the tissue to be penetrated, by the intermediary of a tube which is the site of electric fields and of magnetic fields for acceleration and control, the said radiation being preferably guided and/or reflected by a rotary deflector placed in the tube. It is often advantageous to modulate or impose rhythm on this stream of particles by means of variable magnetic and/or electric fields so as to augment still more the force of penetration. This rhythm is preferably consistent, especially in medical applications, with the intrinsic period of the tissue to be penetrated or of the neighboring tissues, for example, muscle. These intrinsic periods arc well-known in medicine and are applied, particularly, for diathermy: they are situated in the wavelength range from 1 m to 50 m and more especially from 1 m to 18 m. Preferably, one arranges to modulate the emission of radiation, the accelerating magnetic and electric fields, and perhaps also the rotatory deflector, to the cardiac rhythm of the subject. It seems that the result obtained by the invention in the treat- ment of maladies of living cells (vegetable or animal) are due to certain phenomena which will be described, it being understood that this exposition will not circumscribe the invention. As a function of its electro-physico-chemical constitution, the cellular pair nucleus-protoplasm is endowed with electric conductiv- ity in direct relationship with ion exchange processes provoked by metabolic phenomena. One finds in tissues the presence of an accumulation of electricity at different potentials according to the different cellular densities of the tissues. The work of Renshaw, Forbes, Morison, Amassian, de Vito, Ruset, Albe-Fessard, Tauc, Adrian, etc. has shown with the aid of micro-electrodes the existence of slowly oscillating elementary elec- tric activity in the interior of cells; it can be thought that the rythmeur (or pace-maker) is achieved by the oscillatory electro- magnetic system comprising the cell nucleus. This nucleus, in effect, is made up essentially of tubular filaments of insulating material (related to chitin) containing in its interior an electrically conducting saline liquid, and these filaments, coiled upon themselves, can be considered to constitute real little oscillatory circuits. The recent work of Warson (sic) in America, as well as that of French scientists, including a communication from Polonsky, Don zon and Sadron presented to the Academie des Sciences by Prof. Francis Perrin on 16 May 1960 (Rec. comptes rend, heb., 250 No. 20, 3414-3416) making it clear that experimental samples of solid DNA manifest properties analogous to those known in ferroelectric"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Patents 378 materials, makes plausible the hypothesis that a potential differ- ence may exist between nucleus and periphery of cells. Certain recent theories go even further and liken the cell to an electronic receiver-emitter device normally functioning in harmony with the ambient media. The oscillatory system of demand waves, consti- tuted by the cell nucleus, would behave in accordance with the laws governing semi-conducting materials. The applicant is led to the conviction that in a normal state of physico-electric equilibrium, the cell nucleus is positively charged, but can acquire a negative surcharge following phenomena analo- gous to polarization. The invention, especially, enables organs afflicted by this inver- sion of their electric potential, particularly in the case of the pathol- ogic negative surcharge of cancerous nuclei, to recover their former equilibrium. The following description in regard to the attached drawing, given as a non-restricting example, will make it possible to under- stand how the invention can be realized, the details which emerge both from the text and the drawing being, of course, part of the said invention: Fig. 1 is a schematic section showing an apparatus for produc- tion and emission of an electromagnetic field combined according to the invention.

The assemblage of Fig. 1 contains an apparatus 1 emitting electrically charged particles 2 in a cavity or passage 3, a cyclotron 4 accelerating the particles 2 and sending them into a cavity 5 forming a tube into which merges another cavity 6 acting as wave- guide for electromagnetic radiation of frequency in the centimeter range emitted by a magnetron 7. The cavity 8 formed by the joining of tube 5 and waveguide 6 leads into a tube 9 in which the resulting radiation is accelerated and aligned. The interior of the cavity- formed by the assemblage of elements 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 contains argon at a pressure of 2 mm mercury. The particle emitter 1 consists of an electron gun comprising a plate 10 and a cathode 11. The cathode 11 is of molybdenum and has the very special form represented in Figs. 1 and 2. It consists of a rim 1la connected by two aligned spokes 11b to a hub 11c pierced by a hole 11d with its axis along XX'. The rim 11a is in two parts (as one sees in Fig. 1) which may be held together by screws (for example) forming a cavity of revolution 11e traversed by a number of holes 11f parallel to the axis XX' and regularly spaced. The filament for heating, 12, situated in the interior of the cavity 11e and is connected to the power supply conductors 12a. The best results are obtained with a cathode 11 of molybdenum. The applicant has obtained satisfactory, but slightly inferior, results with tungsten cathodes. It turns out that molybdenum, and to a lesser degree tungsten, are the metals whose valency is closest to the mean valency of the chemical molecules constituting living tissues and more particularly those of human beings. One might well seek to use this fact to explain scientifically the phenomena involved, but it is understood that the invention is not limited by any scientific explanation. Concerning, on the other hand, the gas present in the apparatus at low pressure, the best results have been obtained with argon; the applicant has also obtained satisfactory, but slightly inferior, results with other gases of the rare gas series. Surrounding the tube which constitutes the electromagnetic chamber are arranged: an electromagnet 13 with its winding 13a, placed at the level of the accelerating coils 14 and 15. Other acceler- ating coils 14,15 and 16 are similarly dispersed around the cavities 3, 5 and 8.

This cathode 17 is supported by a hollow pillar 18 pierced by holes 18a close to its junction with the bottom of tube 9. This pillar 18 communicates with a tube 18b emerging on the axis of a rotary deflector 19 carrying at each end a \"crown\" of graphite plates 19a inclined at 45° to the vertical. The rotating axis 19b of the rotary deflector is mounted in a support 20 fixed to the interior of tube 19 and carries at its upper extremity magnetic bobs 19c which ensure that it will be set in motion in cooperation with the magnetic bobs 21a mounted on the shaft 21b of a motor 21. The lower extremity of the rotary deflector 19 is composed of a piece of molybdenum or of tungsten 19d in the form of a pyramid whose apex is opposite the open end of the tube 9. The hollow base 18 and the tube 18b can be of a borosilicate glass of low coefficient of expansion such as that sold under the trademark \"Pyrex.\" They may also be of quartz. Tube 9 itself can be of \"Pyrex\" as above or of another glass of the quality currently used for the manufacture of electronic tubes, but its bottom 9a, which is trav- ersed by the radiation, is advantageously made of quartz. The duct 8 joins the tube 9 by way of several tubulures such as 8a and 8b directed in vertical planes towards the plates 19a at a certain angle, which is advantageously about 22.5°. An electromag- net 23 analogous to the electromagnet 13 of the emitter tube 1 is placed around the cathode 7. Similarly, accelerator windings 24 are disposed around the tube 9. This tube also carries, at positions indicated in the drawing, three electrodes 25, 25a, and 25b sur- rounded by windings 26, 26a, and 26b, respectively. The drawing shows the supply lines, 17b, 17c of the cathode and its filament and that of the plate, 22a. The basic plan of the electric supply is represented in Fig. 4.

The current so modulated is passed through the electromagnets 13 and 23 in such a manner as to generate, normal to the cathodes 11 and 17, a modulated field of 10,000 to 20,000 gauss.

The current produced by the converter 32 also feeds a voltage step-up apparatus 33 consisting of a vibrator followed by a trans- former and a rectifier, and producing a direct current varied at 30 to 120 pulses per minute imposed by the variometer 30. The maximum value of the voltage produced by the apparatus 33 is, for instance, 300,000 V, but this value may vary up or down, depending on the power one wishes to operate with. The current produced by the voltage step-up apparatus 33 feeds the coils 4b of the cyclotron and 24 of tube 9, as well as a rheostat 34 permitting regulation of voltage to the desired value between 5000 V and 70,000 V. This voltage is applied to an oscillatory circuit 35 which produces oscillations at a frequency variable at will of wave- length between 1 m and 18 m. The current available to the output terminals 35a, 35b of this oscillating circuit 35 is thus a high tension current modulated first at 30 to 120 pulses per minute (by the variometer 30) and secondly at a wavelength 1-18 m. This current feeds the coils 4c and 14; the electrodes, 25a and 25b are connected to terminals 35a and 35b, respectively, and electrode 25 is connected to the mid-point 35c. Cathodes 11 and 17, the \"dees\" of the cyclotron, and the plates 10 and 22, not shown in the diagram of Fig. 4, are connected to the output of the step-up assembly 33, while the heating current for the filaments 11e and 17a is furnished by the resistance 29. To operate the apparatus, one adjusts the controls of the resis- tance 29 and the variometer to the desired rhythm; in medical applications, this is advantageously the subject's cardiac rhythm: This rhythm is thus imposed upon the whole installation. The cathode 13 emits toward the left a stream of positively charged particles 2, which are concentrated by the electromagnet 13 and accelerated by the coils 14, 15 and 16 and by the cyclotron 4. Superimposed on this particle stream in the duct 8 is the electromag- netic radiation from the magnetron 7, which is adjusted to the wave- length found by experience to be most appropriate to the cells which are to be penetrated, e.g., 14 cm for the liver and 19.5 cm for the spleen. The resulting radiation is deflected, directed and accelerated"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Patents 382 in tube 9 and is directed by way of the base of this tube toward the target to be penetrated. It must be noticed that the magnetic field of the coils 15,16 and 26 is modulated, by means of the converter assembly 31, at a frequency adjustable between 300 and 900 Hz. This modulation has the effect of concentrating the particles, that is to say to detach them from the walls of the tubes, and it also permits an appreciable saving in weight of the iron cores of the coils. One chooses the highest frequencies (i.e., around 900 Hz) when one wishes to produce hard radiation at the exit of tube 9, and the lower frequencies for soft radiation. The unidirectional magnetic fields of the coils 4c of the magne- tron (sic) (cyclotron?) and the accelerator coils 14 as well as the electric field of electrodes 25, 25a, 25b, are modulated by the oscillatory circuit 35 at a chosen wavelength between 1 m and 18 m. In medical applications notably one selects the wavelength that best suits the organ to be treated or its surroundings, such as muscle. As already indicated, experience with diathermy makes it possible to determine the most suitable wavelength. It must be noted that the resulting radiation already possesses, in tube 8 (Fig. 1) a considerable penetrating force. One could therefore use the assemblage described by omitting tube 9 and terminating the cavity at the end of tube 8 by means of a glass or quartz base, the resulting radiation being accelerated and directed, for example, immediately upstream from the base, by a final coil (not shown) surrounding tube 8. However, tube 9 appreciably improves the results. Figs. 5 and 6 represent another mode of realizing the assemblage in accordance with the invention, in which the elements playing the same role are indicated by the same signs as in Figs. 1 and 3, modified by primes. The arrangement of the connecting ducts of Fig. 5 in relation to tubes 1' and 9', to the magnetron 7' and the cyclotron 4', is different from that of Fig. 1 and has been used successfully by the applicant. The waveguide 6' of the magnetron 7' opens into the end of tube 1' and the duct 3', carrying the resulting radiation, divides into two branches: Branch 36, which conducts the radiation directly to tube 9', and branch 37 which conducts it to the cyclotron 4'. This blocks the electromagnetic radiation and accelerates the stream of particles which is passed by way of duct 38 to the tube 9'. This arrangement can be used with a particle emitter and an accelerator and director tube similar to tubes 1 and 9 of the preceding figures. However, tubes 1' and 9' of Figs. 5 and 6 are constructed in a different manner with regard to their cathodes and anodes."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"383 Patents Tube 1' contains a first electrode 11' exactly like that of the cathode 11 of tube 1, and an identical second electrode 39 furnished with a filament 39a. Tube 9' (Fig. 6) contains in its lower part a first electrode 17' with filament 17'a and an identical second electrode 40 with its filament 40a. In normal operation, i.e., to produce radiation identical to that described in connection with Figs. 1 to 4, electrode 11' serves as cathode and electrode 39, given a positive potential, plays the role of the plate 10 in Fig. 1, the filament 39a being unheated. Electrode 40 and its filament 40a are disconnected; cathode 17' and plate 22' are supplied as in Fig. 3. To obtain particularly penetrating radiation, the polarities are reversed: Electrode 11' becomes an anode and its filament 11'e is disconnected, while electrode 39 receives the cathode supply and its filament 39a is heated; electrode 17' (with filament 17'a discon- nected) and electrode 22' become anodes, while electrode 40 serves as cathode and its filament 40a is heated. For example, one can establish a potential difference of 250,000 V between 40 and 17', and 50,000 V between 40 and 22'. It is understood that in these conditions the cathode 39 emits to the left a stream of electrons which is concentrated, modulated and accelerated by the various coils and in the cyclotron, the polarities of which must of course be established in the proper direction. This stream of electrons is combined with the centimeter radiation emitted by the magnetron 7', resulting in tube 9' in the emission of very hard x-rays, modulated at the chosen frequencies, combined with the centimeter radiation of the desired frequency. The assembly shown in Figs. 5 and 6 thus permits one to obtain at will either very hard x-rays or the radiation described in connec- tion with the preceding diagrams. The following description, referring to Figs. 7 and 9, relates to certain details of the apparatus used for modulating the electric current. Fig. 7 represents schematically the apparatus for control of the resistance 29 and the variometer 30. The variable resistance 29 consists of a graphite helix 29a immersed in a conducting liquid 29b; another electrode 29c, also of graphite, partly immersed in the liquid, is set into up-and-down oscillations by a connecting rod 41a linked to a fly-wheel 41. The fly-wheel is set in rotation, through the intermediary of a worm transmission 41b, by an axle 42 which can be driven, thanks to a double clutch 42a, 42b, either by a motor 43, or by the shaft 30a of the variometer 30. The variometer 30 is driven by a motor 44 by way of the worm transmission 44a.

In this case, the motor 44 of the variometer 30 can be stopped and the remainder of the installation is then not pulsed. If, on the contrary, the fly-wheel 41 is engaged in 42b and disconnected from 42a, the motor 44 activates the variometer 30 and the resistance 29 at the chosen rhythm. The speed of rotation of motors 43 or 44 can be regulated at the required speed, corresponding visibly to the cardiac rhythm of the subject, by acting upon the excitation of these motors by means of a manually adjustable rheostat. If one prefers to regulate the speed of motors 43 or 44 in direct accord with the cardiac rhythm of the subject, one can use an assembly such as that represented schemati- cally in Fig. 8: At 46 there is a contact microphone which, when placed over the subject's heart, produces impulses. These are ampli- fied in the circuit shown and applied to an electromagnet at 47 with a moving core which activates a rheostat; this in turn regulates the current running the motors 43 or 44. Fig. 9 shows schematically the principle of the oscillating circuit 35. The rectified potential, adjustable between 5000 V and 70,000 V by means of rheostat 34 (Fig. 4) is applied between the terminals 48 and 48a. Terminal 35c (which is also connected to electrode 25, Figs. 2 and 4) is connected to the neutral point on the high tension side of the transformer which is a component of the step-up assembly 33 (Fig. 4). The terminals 49 and 49a receive the heating current produced by the resistance 29. The variable condensers 50 and 50a make it possible to regulate to the desired wavelength (which, as seen, is between 1 m and 18 m) the current available at the output terminals 25a and 25b of the oscillator shown. The modes of implementation described gave been successfully carried out but it is self-evident that these are only examples, and that they might be modified, notably by substitution of equivalent techniques, without going beyond the bounds of the invention.

Identity or nonidentity then results as a decision from an algorithm — a set of perceptual opera- tions and comparisons — in which case the nature of a particular identity is conditional upon the nature of the set of perceptual operations comprising the algorithm. Ordinary logic does not account for the temporal aspects of perception, merely accounting for the spatial aspects. In other words, Aristotlean logic is a synthesis of primitive observation, fitted to the partial (spatial) reality emerging from spacetime after the imposition of the monocular (one-at-a-time) photon interaction with matter. In quantum mechanics, time is a parameter, not an observable. Hence measurement/detection (of observables) deals with primitive observation and Aristotlean logic (topology). Total reality includes nonprimitive observation — hence, non- Aristotlean logic (chronotopology) — as shown in Young's two-slit experiment. By applying temporal accounting to each perceptual operation, Aristotle's three laws can be shown to be self-contradictory and incomplete as written. That is, they are topolological, not chronoto- pological. A simple derivation of a fourth law is shown and an application rule given which itself may be regarded as a fifth law of logic. A proof of the fourth law by demonstration is given. The resulting four law logic is chronotopological. The applica-"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"429 Fourth Law of Logic tion rule states that either Aristotle's three laws apply explicitly and the fourth law is implicit, or the fourth law applies explicitly and Aristotle's three laws are implicit. The four-law chronotopological logic is theoretically capable of resolving every present three-law paradox. Aristotle's Laws and the Paradox of Change Aristotle's three laws of logic, on which foundation rests all mathematical, physical, and rational thinking, can ordinarily be stated as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Aristotle's three laws of logical thought A variety of arguments can easily be produced to show that these laws are incomplete; i.e., they do not specify all reality, for parts of reality can be shown to contradict one or more of Aristotle's laws. Indeed, all \"observed\" reality can be shown to violate all three- laws. E.g., the most direct violation is posed by the problem of change, a problem originally propounded by Heraclitus about 500 B.C., and unsolved to this day. Heraclitus pointed out that, for a thing to change, it must turn into something else, and then asked how a thing could be something other than itself? We may think of a thing — say, —some feature A of which is said to change. If A changes, it turns into thus violating logic laws one and two. Further, we are considering A as the \"changed thing. i.e., something which is somehow both A and so logic law three is violated as well."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Fourth Law of Logic 430 Thus, if Aristotle's laws are taken to be all the fundamental laws of logic, then logically there can be no change whatsoever, because change negates all three laws. I.e., either change does not exist or it is totally illogical. Since all measurements, detections, thoughts, and perceptions are simply changes, then it follows that these operations logically cannot exist. Or, if we assume the \"operations\" to exist, their outputs cannot exist. If the operations do not exist, then again their outputs do not exist. So if the products or outputs cannot exist, then by this reasoning no perceived, detected, measured, conceived thing exists. If we then insist that such things do indeed exist, then all is paradoxical and illogical. This is essentially the nature of the paradox posed by Heraclitus. Heraclitus's change paradox has not been satisfactorily resolved to this day, and rigorously all the rational science of the Western world, being based on paradoxical change (detection, perception, observation) is itself totally illogical by its own logical standards. Resolving the Paradox of Change However, the conditions necessary to resolve the problem of change can be stated simply by inspection of the problem as follows: (1) Aristotle's three laws must specify or apply to only that which is not changing, since change violates or negates all three laws; (2) If change is to logically exist, there must exist at least a fourth law of logic, one which applies to change; (3) This fourth law must contain the negations of each of the first three laws, since change negates them; (4) To be consistent, in any particular logical case, either the three laws explicitly apply or the fourth law explicitly applies (i.e., either change explicitly exists in that particular case or it does not); (5) Since all four laws must apply at all times, then when the three laws apply explicitly, the fourth law must be implicit—and when the fourth law applies explicitly, the three laws must be implicit. With the five stated conditions, a fourth axiom of logic can be written simply by writing down the negations of Aristotle's three"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"431 Fourth Law of Logic laws, and synthesizing these negations into a single fourth law, as shown in Table 2. Table 2. Negations to Aristotle's laws. However, even though we can synthesize the negation into a single law — the old \"identity of opposites\" idea — we still have the problem of understanding such a law. Though at first glance the negations and the synthesized fourth law seem bewildering, we can readily comprehend them if we carefully consider the temporal nature of the process that occurs in logical thinking. The Importance of Time Specifically, a finite interval of time is required to perceive, think, detect, or observe an entity — regardless of whether we refer to \"physical\" or \"mental\" detection, because both physical and mental processes are temporal. Indeed, we flatly state without further discussion that ultimately the identifying or mapping of physical and mental operations onto each other is what time is a priori. At any rate, we now carefully account for each individual time interval required to think, conceive, detect, perceive, or observe any entity — whether that entity is physical or mental — and we also account for the finite time interval required to perform a logical operation. So we rewrite Aristotle's three laws as shown in Table 3, with subscripted numbers indicating the separate time intervals in each law. *These negations mean that A and are totally undifferentiated."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Fourth Law of Logic 432 Table 3. Temporally accounted laws and negations. The resolution to the entire mystery so long inherent in these axioms of logic now stands simply revealed: Whether one of Aristotle's laws holds or its negation holds is determined solely by the nature of the logical operation in time interval three. 1 I.e., the operation in interval three may be regarded as an algorithm comprised of subsidiary (assumed) operations in separate time subintervals that, taken together, comprise the overall opera- tion implied by the logic symbol. Thus in the first law, if temporal tags (time snapshots) are not accounted (i,e., if they do not apply), then Aristotle's laws hold, for the snapshot 1 of A is not differentiated in algorithm 3 from snapshot 2 of A. This then rigorously holds for spatial (L 3 ) entities, but not for spacetime entities. The snapshots in this case for Aristotle's first law (and the others as well) are spatial snapshots. On the other hand, if snapshots 1 and 2 of A are themselves temporally differen- tiated in algorithm 3, then the negation of Aristotle's law applies, because the spacetime snapshots A 1 and A 2 are different. This is immediately apparent, e.g., in a Minkowski geometry representa- tion, where the second snapshot of A will have a time coordinate different from the time coordinate of snapshot 1. This is represented as shown in figure 1, where \"A\" is taken as a simple magnitude, in this case 5."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"433 Fourth Law of Logic Figure 1 . Spatial snapshots of spatiotemporal A differ. As can be seen from figure 1, 5 1 is not identical to 5 2 unless we imply the operator in the time interval three algorithm. The negation of the second law may also be simply understood if we use temporal accounting. E.g., suppose we take A 1 = +1, and then pose the absolute value operator || for potential use in algorithm 3. If || is not used, then and Aristotle's second law holds. If || is used, then and in that case Note we are taking the view that there is nothing \"absolute\" or \"inherent\" about identity or non-identity; instead, each is a condi- tional result that can only be established by some logical, comparn"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Fourth Law of Logic 434 tive set of operations. If the suboperations comprising the decision algorithm for the identity/non-identity determination are changed, the finding of the algorithm (the decision) may often change. Specifi- cally, one can have the cases Thus we advance a conditional identity criterion to be incorpo- rated into formal logic: \"Identity\" or \"non-identity\" is defined by a decision made as a result of applying an operational algorithm; changing the internal operator components assumed inherent in the algorithm can change the decision. We are stating a fundamental principle that \"identity\" and \"non-identity\" are conditional and only conditional; they are never absolute. Primitive Observation and \"Reality\" With these points made, we now turn to the third law. From Table 2, on examination it can be seen that the third law actually is a statement for monocular perception, detection, observation, thought, or conception. Indeed, this law says that only a single thing at a time can be perceived, detected, observed, thought, or conceived. As we pointed out in a previous paper 2 , there is a very good reason for this \"law.\" Primitive man lived almost exclusively in a reality detected by light, by the photon interaction. Even in the absence of visible light, all bodies have temperature, and man is immersed in a \"sea\" of continual electromagnetic photon with inter- actions. The photon interaction is monocular - - only one at a time interacts with a particle of mass. Further, photon interaction con- stitutes the operator invoked upon L 3 T spacetime. Photon emission carries away time (the photon is made of leaving behind an L 3 spatial reality, as we have previously pointed out. 3 So all our primitive concepts, ideas, and notions about reality have come from over four million years of hominid and human experience in the photon-detected partial reality (\"physical,\" \"objec- tive,\" or \"spatial\" reality) that remains when the time \"dimension\" (fundamental variable) is destroyed from L 3 T spacetime, leaving"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"435 Fourth Law of Logic only L 3 space behind. Specifically, our observed macroscopic reality consists of large temporal (mental) aggregates of such spatial re- sults, where we cannot distinguish the tiny temporal separations of the pieces. Thus all our observed/perceived entities are spatial, and further, each perception/observation snapshot results in a frozen, unchanging spatial entity (resulting — in physical detection — from the so-called \"collapse of the wave function.\" The loss of a wave function is simply the loss of time.) We vaguely sense \"time\" and \"change\" as the relation between these snapshots — i.e., by causal- ity, or the ordering of the spatial changes — much as we see \"movement\" in movie frames rapidly projected onto a screen one-at- a-time. Thus our primitive observations, from which have painfully been formed our relational concepts and ideas, are monocular, unchanging, and spatial. Aristotle's three laws of logic — which indeed may be taken to be only a simple synthesis of our primitive observation and corresponding relational concepts — then exhibit the same characteristics; they are monocular, unchanging, 3-dimen- sional, spatial, non-temporal relational statements. Any statement that is temporal, changing, or 4-dimensional will thus appear as a logical paradox to this logical shorthand. But from Young's two-slit experiment, we already know that reality and relationships between its parts are quite different if the photon interaction is not invoked — i.e., if is not invoked. Classical reality (as prescribed by Aristotle's laws) is directly vio- lated by an electron in the two-slit experiment, e.g., if and only if photon interaction with the electron is not invoked. Again, this has been simply explained by the present author 4 , and Charles Muses as early as 1957 pointed out the absence of any mystery in Young's experiment if the chronotopological aspects were considered. 5 The Conscious Mind is Fitted to the Photon Interaction However, what is normally referred to as the \"conscious, think- ing mind\" is simply a functioning temporal (rigorously, chronotopol- ogical) mechanism that is painfully built up in the individual's awareness (his mind in the greater sense of both thought and aware- ness, whether monocular or multiocular) by training, conditioning and experience. Its functioning is largely conditioned by one's 90% or so attention to visual stimuli (to the partial reality remaining after"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Fourth Law of Logic 436 photon interaction has been invoked, and to the memory-collated ordering of vast numbers of such photon interactions) and by one's cultural conditioning — which itself has been almost exclusively conditioned and shaped by the monocular photon interaction at base root. Thus, since the beginning of man, his conscious, rational mind has been trained and constructed to function almost exclusively in basic correspondence with the photon interaction, and his experien- tial reality consists of the partial reality stripped from fundamental reality by photon interaction. All \"perceived differences,\" e.g., are created by this deep mind- set. As has been previously pointed out, 6 the solitary human problem responsible for all man's inhumanity to his fellow man is directly dependent upon man's almost exclusive detection, observation, perception, and conception of \"difference\" between humans, these \"differences\" being due exclusively and totally to the fitting of men's conscious minds to the photon interaction's monocular separation of spatial reality from nonspatial reality, i.e., to Such well-nigh total devotion to, and enslavement by, photon interaction also is responsible for the scientist's well-nigh total devotion to, and enslavement by, the present imperfect and incom- plete three laws of logic, as presented by Aristotle. The depth of that devotion and enslavement is evidenced by the fact that the resolu- tion of such paradoxes as Heraclitus's problem of change have eluded the best minds of humanity for several thousands of years. Indeed, these paradoxes cannot be resolved by the conscious, rational mind in its present state, for it has been most firmly constructed and fitted to function in accordance with the photon interaction. 7 One cannot hope to resolve any logical paradox by using only those same logical methods that found the situation to be paradoxical in the first place! Dimensionality That we need not be constrained by such universal delusion is already shown by binocular vision. Specifically, in viewing a three- dimensional object, each eye never detects a \"third dimension,\" but detects only an L 2 2-dimensional picture. By taking two slightly"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"437 Fourth Law of Logic different 2-dimension snapshots and superposing them, the third dimension is gained. One then essentially sees the resultant super- posed pictures as \"almost the same but not quite.\" I.e., the Aristot- lean identity algorithm, if satisfied, yields \"no difference, hence one object,\" and if not satisfied, yields \"difference, hence multiple (ex- tended) object(s).\" So if the two snapshots are almost Aristotlean- identical but not quite, we get an extended-two-dimensional (three- dimensional) object. Otherwise we see two separate, two-dimen- sional snapshots blurred together (the reader is urged to try this and see). The point is, \"dimensionality\" and the identity algorithm are directly related, and geometrically one follows from the other. Awareness of Time In very similar manner, we can only gain cognizance of aware- ness of \"time\" (as a fourth dimension) by the superposing of two slightly differing (Aristotlean-wise) 3-dimensional snapshots. As is well known, e.g., time is not an \"observable\" in quantum mechanics; it is a \"parameter.\" Rigorously, the only place such snapshots — each of which is \"past\" (spatially separated by the annihilation of time in the collapse of the wave function) — can multiply exist is in the \"mind\" in its most general sense. In a rigorous sense, mind and time can be taken as identical, and the \"flow of time\" can be taken as the \"flow of mind connections or superpositions\" of its spatial components. I.e., measured/detected/observed \"physical phenom- ena\" are a priori 3-dimensional and spatial, while a mind is four- dimensional and hyperspatial. 8 Spacetime exists mentally but not observably. Time is logically implicit, not explicit. Temporal Aspects of Logic Now we return to the temporal aspects of logic. Each perceptual part of each Aristotlean law is fitted to the photon interaction, hence monocular. The logic operation, inherent in the logic symbol in each statement, involves temporal superposition or comparison of spatial perceptual objects. Hence the logic operation is hyperdimensionally a function of mind and injects mind/time into the statement. Yet these laws, being fitted to or synthesizing photon interaction, at- tempt to prescribe the absence of time, even though writing down the logic operation rigorously invokes time. They are thus totally contradictory, since as written they implicitly violate themselves."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Fourth Law of Logic 438 Table 4 summarizes the operations now to be permitted in the time-three algorithm, in developing a new four-law logic: Table 4. Conditional identity rules. Rules one and two simply state that, when snapshots 1 and 2 are superimposed (subtracted) in time interval 3, the resultant snapshot 3 may be zero or nonzero. If zero, snapshots 1 and 2 are said to be identical, and if snapshot 1 is to be labeled A, then snapshot 2 is to be labeled A. If snapshot 3 is nonzero, snapshots 1 and 2 are said to be nonidentical; if snapshot 1 is labeled A, then snapshot 2 is labeled Rule 3 says that snapshot 3 is a \"memory\" snapshot, and it may be particulately examined to monocularly separate snapshots 1 and 2. Rule 4 states that snapshot 3 is not a \"memory snapshot\" and may not be further separated. Note that in logic we repeatedly apply these rules in combina- tion, serially or compositely. Note further that Rule 1 must serially apply both rules 3 and 4, as must rule 2 also."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"439 Fourth Law of Logic If we take to mean \"rule 4 applied conditional to rule 3 also being applied,\" and to mean \"rule 4 applied conditional to rule 3 not also being applied,\" we may write Table 5: Table 5. Conditional identity, non-identity, and oneness. As can be seen, this type of reasoning also sheds a great deal of light on the long-standing problem of the \"thing-in-itself,\" but that is beyond the scope of this paper. The Fourth Law of Logic Now we write the fourth law of logic as follows: where all we have said is that, by rule 4, in snapshot 3 no memory process is allowed, and no separation/differentiation whatsoever of A 1 and is permitted. Under these operational conditions for identity, what had previously been called A 1 in snapshot 1 and what had been called in snapshot 2 are indistinguishable, hence identical. Figure 2 shows this concretely, and may be taken as a proof of the fourth law by demonstration."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Fourth Law of Logic 440 Figure 2. Proof that two opposites can be identified. What was separately perceived as A 1 in time snapshot 1 and what was separately perceived as in time snapshot 2, cannot be distinguished in time snapshot 3. Thus the age-old philosophical dilemma posed by the illogical identity of opposites has a simple resolution if one considers tempo- ral aspects, and introduces temporal conditions for identity or non- identity decisions. We now write the new four law conditional identity logic as shown in Table 6: Further, we point out that all four laws now apply. Laws 1,2, and 3 are the laws of explicit monocular perception, with implicit binocu- lar perception. Law four is the law of explicit binocular perception, with implicit monocular perception. Both monocular and binocular perceptions must be and are used in each law. So in any situation, either the triad applies explicitly and the fourth law applies implic- itly, or the fourth law applies explicitly and the triad applies implicitly. Indeed, one can even take the view that we have prescribed a five-law logic, the fifth la w being taken as shown in Table 7:"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"441 Fourth Law of Logic Table 7. A possible fifth law of logic. In a previous paper 9 , the author has already presented methods to apply this new logic to resolve present paradoxes. At least hypothetically, every present paradox should be simply a statement of the explicit fourth law, and it should be resolvable by explicit application of that law 10 . NOTES AND REFERENCES 1. Specifically, by whether or not exclusivity applies. I.e., we may read Law 1 as \"In snapshot (time interval) 3, what was A in snapshot 1 is exclusively identical to (unseparated from) what was A in snapshot 2.\" Law 2 may be read as \"In snapshot 3, what was A in snapshot 1 is exclusively not identical to (is exclusively separated from) what was not-A in snapshot 2.\" Law 3 reads, \"In snapshot 3, what was A in snapshot 1 and what was not-A in snapshot two are exclusively separated.\" Thus it can be seen that the three laws simply are statements involving whether or not two former perceptions are to be separated in a third perception. These three statements presently prescribe the total separation of the two previous perceptions and prohibit any admixture of the two — the so- called \"excluded middle.\" Thus the three laws prescribe monocular, one-at-a-time perception. What we call a \"wave\" exists in time and is considered to contain an admixture of timeless, static spatial states (such as \"wavelengths.\") The prohibiting of admixtures thus repre- sents the \"collapse of the wave function\" and corresponding loss of time. This defines \"observation\" and explains why all \"measurement\" and \"detection\" and \"observation\" — requir- ing a collapse of said wave function — are spatial and not spatiotemporal. That is why time is a parameter in quantum mechanics, not an observable. Relativity, being constrained by such logic, obviously can find nothing \"physical\" (observed, spatial, timeless thing frozen by"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Fourth Law of Logic 442 the collapse of the wave function as engendered by or fitted to the photon interaction) that is traveling faster than light — i.e., that violates the conditions implied by the \"observing/de- tecting agent.\" That reality need not at all be so constrained is clearly shown by Young's two-slit experiment, the heart of all quantum me- chanics. In this experiment, \"classical' reality is violated if and only if the photon interaction is not invoked. Classical reality is obeyed if the photon interaction is invoked. With appropriate change to logic to fit \"reality that has not been interacted with by photons\" and therefore is spatiotem- poral, a new physics becomes possible. 2. Thomas E.

With the possible exception of Kozyrev — whose more techni- cal works on time remain undisclosed to open science — no other person known to this author seems to have grasped the implications of a dynamic structure of time as penetratingly as has Charles Muses. The importance of the time interaction explaining the two-slit experiment (i.e., in explaining wave- particle duality) was noted as early as 1957 by Muses. See, e.g., Muses' introduction to Jerome Rothstein's Communica- tion, Organization, and Science, The Falcon's Wing Press, Indian Hills, Colorado, 1958, p. lxii, where Muses pointed out that the celebrated wave-particle paradox remains a paradox only so long as the chronotopological (his word) phases of the phenomena are left unrealized in the analysis. The entire foreword by Muses is a remarkable document which analyzes the structure of time itself. With his hypernumbers Muses can describe the nested structure of time, which is what is actually"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"443 Fourth Law of Logic being carried by the photon. Further, he can theoretically predict mechanisms by means of which these structures can be orthorotated. It would appear that practical devices should be constructable on the principles elucidated by Muses, and it is little short of astonishing that fundamental work of such importance and application has been thus far little used by theorists, though it is already recognized in the standard literature; e.g., the profound summary paper \"Hypernumbers II\" in the January 1978 issue of the journal Applied Mathe- matics and Computation, published by Elsevier. 6.

These incidents were not unique, as many think, but were actually only a portion of thousands of related incidents showing the Soviet testing of advanced weapons throughout the world. This listing will show the types of incidents referred to. The listing is not intended to be complete at all, but only representative. Hundreds of incidents of weather engineering, giant cloud radials and grids, suspicious light incidents, etc. could easily be added, were there time and room. No attempt has been made to exhaustively map the \"aerial booms\" that have blanketed the U.S., Europe, and other parts of the world. The light and \"maybe it's UFO's\" reports alone would add thousands of incidents to the list. Our message is succinct: The Soviet Union has developed a new science and weaponized it, since at least the latter 1940's. It has utilized that science — energetics — to develop superweapons and supervehicles. Because of the danger from accidental initiation of nuclear weapons and materials, it is exceedingly difficult and dan- gerous for the Soviets to make extensive use of these weapons. Accordingly, a biological warfare strike — AIDS — has been utilized to deliver what is to be the knockout blow to the West. DATE, INCIDENT, LOCATION, REMARKS Early spring 1966 - Malstrom AFB Montana.

In and around May Day 1985, the Soviet Union held a giant exercise of all its strategic scalar EM weapons. 27 \"power taps\" into the earth — each two frequencies 12 KHz apart — were activated. The earth was thus in forced gravitational resonance beneath our feet on 54 frequencies. Each tap estimated to power up to six of the giant weapons; thus over 100 major strategic scalar EM weapon transmit- ters were activated. Frequency bands were filled with scalar EM transmissions, command and control, including to subs on station underwater.

Marker beacon used in precise registration. Note it was evidenced again above the explosion of the Titan on 18 Apr. 86 at Vandenberg AFB. Boom is from energy induced over a large area; which can catch multiple missiles being launched, a large Naval task force at sea, or a whole flight of airborne bombers, fighters, or helicopters. Also can catch an entire organization on the ground, or an installation - - wiping out all electronics, exploding explosives and ordnance, stunning or killing personnel, etc. Again hundreds of NASA engineers and scientists did not recognize what was happening at the site and over their own heads."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"467 Selected Incidents 12 Dec 1985 - Gander, Newfoundland. Arrow DC-8 crashes immediately after takeoff at Gander AFB, Newfoundland.

Aircraft seen by three eyewitnesses to have an orange glow on it. Symptoms of negative energy intro- duced into engines, cancelling some of heat energy of the engines and seriously interfering with combustion process, causing loss of power. Glow may have been steady, small electromagnetic ball of energy against the aircraft, causing it to electrically charge and exhibit corona. Anomalous hole in right fuselage, just ahead of engines, as if from internal explosion; however, no explosive residue (it was tested). One other anomalous hole found. Wild swings of some instruments recording just at/after liftoff — ignored by investigation. Note previous 36 light incidents in and around Gan- der, Jan. 1982. Gander Airport is major stopover for Soviets, and a major \"registration point\" for scalar EM weapons. Note anomalies in shuttle launch 2 wks earlier, and apparent actual test of the small EM missile then, offset so as not to destroy that shuttle. Aircraft crew one of Arrow's best. Aircraft should have flown okay, if not interfered with. Serious indications that the DC-8, with over 250 U.S. soldiers and air crew, was deliberately destroyed by test of a Soviet launch-phase antibomber system. Note metal-softening Soviet signal detected on 1 Jan 86 by Frank Golden may actually have been on the Woodpecker transmissions on Dec 12,1985.

Frank Golden discovers a metal-softening signal on the Soviet Woodpecker interference grid. Performs experiments to verify the metal-softening ability of the signal. Signal is of such a nature that only Golden's instrumentation could have detected it. He then scalarly cancelled the signal to totally prove it. 24 Jan 86 - Ventura, California.

In greater Los Angeles area, Margaret Wilson observes 3 classic giant radial clouds form at 10 min. intervals: 1:15, 1:25, and 1:35 p.m. Appeared one after the other, till all three were there. Last one lasted about two hours, gradually distorting. Shows a great amount of structuring to capture and turn the Jetstream, to direct cold weather to the Florida Panhandle and catch the Challenger before its impend- ing launch, exposing it to drastic cold conditions. Definitely Soviet engineered. 27 Jan 86 - Santa Monica, California. On evening prior to the Challenger disaster, Al Matthews photo- graphs a strange bar-grid cloud formation, absolutely rectangular bars, from the Los Angeles freeway.

About 4 hr. before the launch of the Challenger, all Soviet ships off- coast, which normally monitor shuttle launches, suddenly depart at high speed. Soviets do not want any suggestion that the ships' radars and transmitters may have interfered with the Challenger launch. Total anomaly. Unprecented event. 28 Jan 86 - Cape Canaveral, Florida. National radio and TV newsmen comment on the highly unusual fact that no birds are flying in the launch area. Reason: For severe localization, high frequency content of the scalar EM signals had been drastically increased. A bird's brain will detect and resonate to this energy, if the wavelength approaches the diameter of its brain. This resonance will cause great pain and/ or death of the bird. Thus the birds flee the area when this begins to occur — or they die. When birds accidentally fly into such a high frequency scalar EM signal, their nervous systems are instantly jammed. They die and fall from the sky. 28 Jan 86 - Cape Canaveral, Florida. Space shuttle Challenger, launched from Cape Canaveral after exposure to cold weather conditions, disastrously explodes. Booster seal problem. Encounters air turbulence during launch, at most critical altitude. Soviet metal-softening signal has been added to grid. Extreme localization in area because of high frequency content added; shown by birds having vacated the area. Anomalous depar- ture of Soviet ships offshore, 4 hrs. earlier. Three previous tests of the weaponry in that exact launch area, against the three previous shuttle launches. Kill of the Arrow DC-8 about 6-112 weeks earlier. Actual celebration by the KGB of perfect success of their active measures against the Challenger! U.S. space program crippled and set back severely. 29 Jan 86 - Moscow. At KGB headquarters in Moscow, the KGB holds a jubilant party to celebrate the perfect success of their active measures against the Challenger.

Possible test of weapon that killed the Challenger, in the earth transmission / earthquake induction mode. 2-4 Feb 86 - Birmingham, Alabama. In Birmingham, Alabama dead birds plummet from the air to the ground for three days. Blackbirds, cardinals, sparrows, bluebirds, etc. No trace of poison in carcasses. Only a few days after kill of the Challenger. To divert the Jetstream further south and hit Florida, the Soviets had moved the normal \"hinge pin\" — where scalar EM energy, either positive or negative, is focussed — from Huntsville to Birming- ham. Hinge pin area was still activated. The high frequencies used for extreme localization against the Challenger were lethal to birds. Therefore birds that inadvertently flew into this zone were instantly killed and dropped from the sky. 10 Feb. 86 - Europe. Super Frelon (French) helicopter crashes, with 11 killed. Aeronau- tique Navale aircraft. Part of a spate of crashes of French military aircraft in four months (through June 86). Defense Minister Andre Giraud launched a special investigation. 23 Feb 1986 - Irish Sea. Over the Irish Sea in an airplane, England's Prince Charles sights a brilliantly glowing, red object hovering near them. His pilot reports the object to air traffic control. Four other aircraft traveling through that area radioed similar reports. Probably either a Soviet craft or a Soviet holographic scalar EM demonstration as part of the overall deception plan, and/or a stimulus to a member of the Royal Family to observe what action is taken by British Ministry ofDefense. By actions, could ascertain whether or not Britain knew what was going on. 30 Mar 86 - Ventura, California.

Bill Bise detects the sudden loss of the East-West Soviet woodpecker transmitter he is monitoring in the field, leaving the North-South transmitter. The failed transmitter was about 20-30 km. from Chernobyl. The Soviet transmitter sites safety circuits go-in full, trying desperately to hold back the giant scalar EM standing-wave potential that has been built up, and slowly and safely drain it away into the earth. In alarm, Soviets shut down nearby reactors at Cher- nobyl. Any \"flash discharge\" escape as a flash-over pulse of the scalar EM potential will produce a giant EGP pulse into the earth. When this EGP pulse reaches the four reactors, they will violently explode, full- up nuclear, like giant hydrogen bombs — perhaps 1200 megatons equivalent. Later the Soviets will claim that the operators shut the plant down to do some \"unauthorized experiments.\" 26 Apr 86 - Chernobyl, USSR.

The real Soviet concern, he indi- cated, is that the U.S. would make a great technical breakthrough and deploy new devices in space as a modification to SDI presenting an unacceptable threat to the Soviet Union. Peter Jennings' ABC News Show, Los Angeles, CA 13 October 1986. Gerasimov let the cat out of the bag! With their deployed scalar electromagnetic weapons, the Soviets would immediately hold the winning hand-if these weapons could be unrestrainedly brought to bear. As pointed out in Fer-de-Lance: A Briefing On Soviet Scalar Electromagnetic Weapons, Tesla Book, Co., 1986, the use of massive Soviet scalar EM weapons can only be gingerly applied. Ac- tivation and use of the Soviet scalar EM weapons is fraught with grave danger to the entire earth and to the whole human species because of the presence of nuclear facilities in the desired target area, and because of the \"backlash\" potential against the Soviet Union's own nuclear weapons and facilities. The explosion at Chernobyl was apparently caused by the acci- dental failure of a nearby scalar EM transmitter, and the eventual impulsive loss of part of the electrogravitational potential built up by the transmitter before it failed. The resulting electrogravitational pulse (EGP) in the earth \"pulsed\" the nearest nuclear material... feul rods in the reactor at Chernobyl. Had the EGP not been depleted prior to its escape, all four reac- tors at Chernobyl would have exploded with the same intensity as if *The term \"Dead Man Fuzing\", means that, even though your opponent kills you, a weapon or effect of your own will inevitably result which will then kill your opponent."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"483 Dead Man Fuzing they had been \"triggered\" by a fission explosion. In short, if unrestrainedly used, the EGPs from the Soviet scalar EM weapons would initiate most of the nuclear weapons where they are in the targeted area-in storage, in silos, in aircraft, etc. Target area nuclear reactors and nuclear wastes would also be violently initiated into nuclear explosion. The resulting vast megatonnage of nuclear explosions, much of them \"in the dirt, \" would provide an unthinkable holocaust. The effects of these giant explosions, deadly fallout and dense clouds of smoke and dirt, would blanket the earth with nuclear effects greater than is presently expected from an all out nuclear war, in which many of the weapons are expected to be destroyed or lost without being exploded nuclearly. Deadly nuclear radiation would blanket the globe, contaminating it for thousands of years. From the covering of the earth by dense smoke and dirt clouds, a new and deeply bitter global ice age-not just a \"nuclear winter\"-would almost certainly be initiated. In 1960 Khrushchev appropriately characterized these fantastic weapons by stating that they could wipe out all life on earth if unrestrainedly used. A country's nuclear weapons and facilities, then, become its in- advertent \"dead man fuzing\" to prevent any substantial employ- ment of large scalar EM weapons against it. So long as nuclear \"dead man fuzing\" is in place in a country, its adversary can only utilize scalar EM superweapons against it with great difficulty, and then only sparingly. At present, both the U.S. and its NATO allies are \"dead man fuzed\" by the presence of Western nuclear weapons-and to some extent, by the presence of nuclear reactors and stored nuclear wastes. Obviously the Soviet Union's task of world domination—and the mind-rending risks it must take in employing large scalar EM weapons—would be greatly expedited if the obstacle of \"deployed U.S. and NATO nuclear weapons and facilities\" could be eliminated or minimized. Also, Gorbachev must be acutely aware that the U.S. is finally beginning to look at the possibility of scalar EM weaponry. He would assume that either the U.S. is already on the way to acquiring scalar EM weaponry of its own, or else the time is imminent when it will do so. If this happened, and the U. S. then were to deploy SDI scalar EM lasers in space, the effects of each laser would be enormously increased by the electrogravitational amplification factor. Reason- able gain increases of the yield of each laser shot might approach, for"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Dead Man Fuzing 484 example, on the order of 10 20 . In that case, each laser could suddenly devastate a whole state or region with one or two shots, instead of just being able to destroy one little missile. The Soviets know that Reagan's Star Wars weapons-if modified to the \"improved\" kind and deployed in space—could deliver a surprise first strike in seconds, and devastate Russia before all the Star Wars space weapons could be knocked out by Soviet ground-based scalar EM beams. The Soviets also know that it is not too difficult to modify lasers to become such powerful scalar EM lasers. This means that Gorbachev needs to insure that the Star Wars weaponry is not actually tested in space. Testing in space requires developing at least prototype \"space deployment\" SDI weapons, to get them up in space to test them from there in the first place. And even such \"prototype\" SDI weapons would be sufficient to devastate the Soviet Union, given that the prototypes employed the technologi- cal breakthrough represented by scalar EM weapons. This is what Gerasimov was really referring to! Thus Gorbachev simply cannot allow such space testing of SDI weapons, if he hopes to be able to safely seize the opportunity to employ his own already-deployed, massive scalar EM weapons during the \"window of time\" that would be provided by dismantling of U.S., NATO, and Soviet nuclear weapons. And-given that he gets agreement and implementation of the \"zero option\"-Gorbachev knows he will only have a narrow \"window\" of time in which he can hope to achieve world domination. It can be only a short time until the U.S. produces results in scalar EM weapons, and promptly develops such weapons of its own. Faced with that eventuality, Gorbachev would then have no choice but to turn away from the Communist dream of world domination, and reach a mutually agreed accommodation with the West. Both the West and the Soviets then would have to take immediate and drastic measures to prevent the rapid development and spread of the relatively cheap scalar EM weaponry throughout other nations, particularly those motivated from fanatical beliefs and quite capable of \"blowing up the earth\" deliberately. Thus, before the U.S. becomes aware of scalar EM weapons and builds its own, Gorbachev desperately needs to get rid of the \"dead man fuzing\" problem posed by the nuclear weapons and facilities possessed by the U.S. and its Nato allies, so that he can utilize his superweapons to dominate the world without destroying it."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"485 Dead Man Fuzing And he needs to block any chance that the U.S. would be able to have space-tested high energy laser prototypes which could be quickly modified to scalar EM weapons, fired into space, and used to counter Soviet aggression or even destroy the Soviet Union in retaliation. In short, today the paramount and almost desperate need of the Soviet Union is to reduce American dead-man fuzing and keep the SDI space laser genie bottled up in the lab on the ground. Accordingly, in Iceland, in what appeared to be a stunning concession on nuclear arms, Gorbachev suddenly offered Reagan a complete dismantling of all nuclear weapons-Reagan's \"zero op- tion.\" Actually this move had been planned by Gorbachev from the beginning; it was not a spur-of-the-moment offer. The reason was simple: If the U.S. could only be persuaded to quickly get rid of its nuclear weaponry, the Soviets would hold an absolutely winning hand. Their massive, deployed, operational scalar EM weapons could then be unleashed with minimal restraint. The extremely delicate and incredibly dangerous problem of bringing the large scalar EM \"continent-buster\" weapons to bear, without inadver- tently causing world destruction, would be vastly eased if only the ordinary U.S. nuclear facilities such as nuclear power plants and radioactive wastes had to be reckoned with. Fortunately, Ronald Reagan fervently believes in defense . He made the right decision, whether or not it was for the right reasons. Indeed, he probably knew in advance that SDI was to be targeted in Iceland by the Soviets, and that sweeping concessions might be offered by them for that purpose. According to one report (\" 'Blinded' Satellites,\" Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, Washington Post, Oct. 29,1986), just before Reykjavik the CIA-sent a report to Reagan with the warning that \"the sole reason for Gorbachev's wanting the Iceland summit was to offer unprecendented inducements for Re- agan to drop SDI.\" Fortunately, Reagan rejected Gorbachev's proposal, because he does not wish to give up what he truly regards as a potential defense against incoming Soviet missiles. Apparently neither Reagan nor his advisors were aware of the real reason for Gorbachev's unexpected and breathtaking proposal for what would essentially be near-total nuclear disarmament. The Soviet ground-based scalar EM lasers could sweep the"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"Dead Man Fuzing 486 heavens of the presently conceived SDI weapons, as Gerasimov obliquely implied. However, this would not change the barrier represented by U.S. nuclear dead man fuzing, unless the nuclear weapons had been removed. Meanwhile, Gorbachev's chess game to remove the dead man fuzing is certainly not over. The Soviets have mounted an intense propaganda campaign urging nuclear disarmament and cancella- tion or restraint of SDI. With a Democratic Senate now in, and with the approaching end of Reagan's term in office, the Soviet effort to clear the U.S. nukes-and the dead man fuzing-out of the way for Soviet deployed superweapons, while keeping the SDI genie in its laboratory bottle, can only be intensified. Already the Soviets are beating every drum to get substantial antinuclear segments of the U.S. scientific, congressional, political, and pacifist communities aroused to oppose SDI and urge a quick zero nuclear option. The treaty for dismantling certain missiles in Europe has al- ready been signed by the President, and its ratification by the U.S. Senate appears imminent. More is yet to come, and quickly. In its aching desire for peace, if an unsuspecting America falls into Gorbachev's trap, shackles SDI and removes its dead-man fuzing, the Soviet Union will be free to enforce its will wherever and whenever it wishes.* If that happens, our beloved stars and stripes will be replaced with the atheistic hammer and sickle. And the noblest experiment of all—freedom for the common person—will have come to an ignoble end. *Just as Brezhnev forecast for 1985, at a secret meeting in 1972 of the communist party leaders of E urope."}]
