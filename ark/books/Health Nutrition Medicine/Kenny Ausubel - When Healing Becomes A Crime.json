He founded the Exceptional Cancer Patient Program, a support group system enabling cancer patients to mobilize thei1· fit!! human resources fo r healing. Wben Healing Becomes a Cl-ime needs to be read by every health care pro­ fessional and legislat or, as well as every citizen , since we are all potential patients during our lifetime. Its importance lies not in convincing anyone of the efficacy of Hoxs ey's treatment, but in demonst rating the closed­ mindedne ss of the medical profession. We must not keep repeat ing the scenario and making criminals out of well-int entioned peopl e. Tw enty-five years ago I was chastised fo r suggesting that perso nality, life events, and state of mind had an effect on the course of one's cancer . Although this was somet hing other s had seen fifty years prior to my aware­ ness, I am still on some We b site quack lists. Ye ars ago I was on all the talk shows and was exposed to criticism fo r causing guilt and blami ng people for their illness. None of this was true, but no one wanted to support my resear ch or listen to what I had to say-except the people who had the illness. To day many doctors have come around to my view because they or their loved ones developed cancer and they experienced first- hand the power of the human spirit under desper ate circumst ances. We need to chang e the system so that future doctors do not receive just medical informati on but are given a true educat ion. They need to learn how to treat people, not diagnoses . They need to be trained to be willing to accept that which is experienc ed. We have to remember there is more to healing a person than there is to curing a disease. The system needs to open up so that the pages of medical journals are not 50 percent pharmaceutical ads, thus closing minds and doors to alter­ native and integrative treatment s. In the future , companies need to be rewarded for researc hing alterna tive treatment s that cannot be patent ed."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"x FOREWORD Our gover nment could easily remed y that with tax breaks and deductions for the cost of the research, while allowing the compan y doing the re­ search to profit from its work in a similar manner to any other commer ­ cial ventu re. I hope this book will awaken people to the possibi lities of true heal­ ing. Ye s, I am against quackery-taking advantage of sick people -even though believing in a quack may cure someone whom a doctor has de­ clared hopeless. What I seek is an open system to assure that we do the resear ch and give people the informa tion, enabling them to make ra­ tional choices that are appropriate for them. Life is a labor pain and we each have the right to decide what pains we are willing to experience to give birth to ourselves. When my father was dying of cancer, I ordered medicat ion from over­ seas to give him hope . One day I received a phone call from the post office. They told me the FDA wouldn't allow the package to be delivered unless it was labeled botanical products rather than medication, so the change was made and we received the medicat ion. Someone in the post office treated us like human beings and cared. We are all entitled to make decisions about our lives and health. Let us hope that some day our medical and healt h care systems include freedom of choice, communication, ap­ propri ate research, and the desire to help the patient exper iencing the disea se. I've had it easier than Harry Hoxsey because I was a doctor, and when people saw that what I did work ed, it became policy. To day the things I was criticized for are a part of qualit y treatment. No one is against suc­ cess, so let us approac h healt h care with an open mind and acceptance of what works . And as healers, let us not forget the Hippoc ratic Oath, whose central messag e is, \"First do no har m.\" True healing should never be a crime, or healer s crimin als.

Expensively placed in the New York Times, instead the ad heralds the opening of the new Integ rative Medicine Center at Memorial Sloan-K ettering Cancer Center , the bulwark of the cancer establishment that has historically ab­ horred such alt ernative influences -until 1999, that is. Althoug h this shift appears sudden, it actually marks the surpri sing revers al in a centuries-long power struggl e, a bitter medical civil war be­ tween conventional and alternat ive approaches. After a long exile, these alternative therapies are now ascendant, riding a crest of popular demand, scientific valid ation, and commercial promis e. Actually the tide is just starting to turn, and the face of cancer treatment may soon become al­ most unrecog nizable as valuable alternat ive therapies permeat e main­ stream pract ice. If Harry Hoxsey had lived to witness this apparent sea change in medi­ cine, he would likely feel very mixed emot ions. He would heartily cheer the grassroot s surge propelling the movement, the same kind that once carried his Hoxsey Cancer Clinics to unmatched heights of popularit y and va lidation. He would be exhilarated by the philosophical conversion of his enemies. But he would also be cynical, suspicious that a clinging monopoly was fighting to save face and above all keep its corner on the cancer market. But then, Hoxsey survived decades of being \"hunted like a wild beast\" only to see his clinics padloc ked without a scientific test. He died a broken man, anguished over the future he felt was robbed from himself and from humanit y. The Hoxsey treatment did live on, thriving as an underground legend still attracting more patient s today than any of the other banished therapies, irrepressible after all. The astonishing saga of the rise and fall and rebirth of the Hoxsey Cancer Clinics provides a classic case histor y of the corros ive medical polit ics that have long prevented the fair investigation of promising"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"alterna tive cancer thera pies, the kinds of practices whose ultimat e accep­ tance now seems inevitable. When the gover nment' s Office of Alterna­ tive Medicine, part of the National Instit utes of Health, recen tly com­ missioned a preliminar y scient ific review of Hoxs ey, it signaled a radical departure, a seeming cease -fire in organ ized medicine' s nearly seventy­ five-y ear crusade against this reputed \"cancer quacker y.\" The govern­ ment was finally giving a state nod to what is arguably the most notorious alternat ive cancer therapy in American history. Hoxsey' s powerful archene my, the American Medical Association, had previ ously crystallized the medical establishmen t's sentiments in its su­ premely influential Journal of the American Medical Associa tion (lAMA) . \"It is fair to obser ve that the American Medical Association or any other association or individual has no need to go beyond the Hoxsey label to be convinced. Any such person who would seriously contend that scientific medicine is under any obligation to investigate such a mixture or its pro­ moter is either stupid or disho nest.\"1 Paradoxical ly, this long-standing denunciation has not been based on the objective scient ific evidence that is supposed to determine the accep­ tance or rejection of medical therapies. Rather, the dismissal typifies the kind of prefactual conclusion that has characterized \"scient ific\" medicine' s century- long pattern of condemnat ion without investigat ion. To day substant ial laborat my data indic ates that the Hoxsey herbal tonic could have genuine value against cancer . Thousands of patients believe it saved their lives. There is no dispute that the Hoxsey remedies for external cancer are effective . Over the course of this centu ry, numer ­ ous prominent figures including senators, congr essmen, judges, and even doctor s have affirmed Hoxsey' s reputed cures and repeat edly called fo r an investiga tion. Why, then, has it taken so long? The answer is buried in medical politics. It revolves around a fierce trade war fought over money as well as a fundamental conflict of medical opinion . Its consequence has been the exclusion and outright suppres­ sion of Hoxsey as well as nume rous other unorthodox cancer therapies. In fact, that war is subsi ding at the precise moment when yesterd ay's \"quackery\" is repeat edly emer ging as tomorrow' s medicine. As the pre­ eminent herbal cancer therap y, Hoxsey is now revisiting a therapeutic terrain dramat ically expanding to embrace botanical and natural medi­ cine. Its return symbo lizes a much larger social transf ormation . This book is a kind of investiga tive biography of this gr anddadd y of alternat ive cancer therapi es. By exploring the unorthodox careers of renegade healers Harr y Hoxsey and Mildred Nelson, we hold a mirror to the turbulent social and economic fo rces shaping medic ine across the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"•m:roauctlon j rich arc of the twentieth century.

It helps de­ code the arcane legacy of retrogra de public policies still haunt ing us to­ day, illuminat ing the emerging path to a future that is meaning fully in­ clusive of natural medic ine. This journey through the shado w side of medicine does raise very disturbing quest ions. If there were unorthodox treatment s for cancer that were effective, would doctors even know about them? By refusing to in­ vestiga te, has organized medicine denied countl ess people access to po­ tentially life-saving therapies? And who has the ultimat e right to deter ­ mine the health-care choices of patients, especi ally people facing life­ threatening illnesses for which conventional medicine has little to offer? I began my odyssey into the Hoxsey story as a filmma ker and journal­ ist in 1983, launching my own investigation into the treatment and its amazing histor y. Collaborating with public healt h nurse Catherine Salveson, I produced a documentar y film on Hoxs ey, and we both subse­ quent ly stepped through the lens to become players. The book also tells the personal story of how we slipped through the looking glass into the upside- down world of cancer politics during this era of dramatic flux. Catherine and I bore witness to the creation of the Office of Alterna­ tive Medicine (OAM) in 1991, which grew directly from years of extreme public pressure mobi lized by the large, highly organized alternat ive medi­ cine communit y. In partic ular, the ardent constit uency demanding the fair evaluation of uncon ventional cancer treatment s led the effort. Con­ gress firmly set the OAM's missi on: to \"investigate and validate\" alterna­ tive therapies, with a priorit y on cancer . As early as 1987, national polls showed Cong ress that over half the American public favored the com­ plete legalization of alternat ive cancer treatment s.2 The tacit reason for such widespread and passionat e popular interest in alternatives is sadly obvious: The medical establish ment has largely lost its celebrated \"War on Cancer\" using surge ry, radiation, and chemotherap y. But what has remained hidden from most people is the existence of an­ other cancer war: the zealous campaign against unconventional cancer treat­ ments and their practit ioners . Over the course of the twentieth centu ry, innovators such as Harry Hoxsey advanced more than one hundred alter­ native approaches, several of which seem to show significant promise. Ye t rather than inviting interest and investigation from mainstream medicine, their champions have been ridiculed, threatened with the loss of profes­ sional licenses, harasse d, prosecute d, or driven out of the countr y. The facts clearly reveal that a consortium of interests has repeatedly condemned these treatments without investigation: the American Medical"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"4 11'1 11\\VUU I.,.. I lV I\" Association (AMA), Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA ), National Cancer Institute (NCI), and American Cancer Societ y (ACS), as well as certain large corporations that profit from the cancer indus try. It is impor ­ tant to emphasize that this confederation of interests known as organized medicine consists principall y of medical politicians and business interests, not practicing doctors . Physicians themsel ves have often objected to the unscient ific rejection of alternative therapies and to restrictions on their own freedom to research or administer them. The news blackout muffling this scandal has been so effective that most people do not happen into the under ground of\"disappeared\" thera­ pies until the fateful moment when they or their friends or relations are diagnosed with the dread disease. It is usually while fighting for their lives that patients discover the plethora of alternat ive cancer therapies claiming to offer hope and benefit, though with little if any scient ific evidence to support their assert ions. Depending on whom you believe, Harry Hoxsey was either a fabulist of epic proportions who led credulous cancer sufferers to a certain death, or an effective healer persecuted by a medical trust. Often called the wild­ est story in medical history, Hoxsey is worth the telling sheerly as a great yarn. Beginning with the treatment' s reputed discovery by a horse, it is a chesmut of Americana that might have sprung from the pen of Mark Tw ain. Were it presented as fiction, no one would believe it possi ble. For over thirty-five years, Harr y Hoxse y doggedly sought a scientific test of his herbal cancer remedies while organized medicine systemati­ cally blocked him. Though largely forgotten today , Hoxsey' s quest ig­ nited a cancer war that blazed across the national stage from the 1920s through the 1950s. Against all odds, he won a formidable series of victo­ ries, especially against his medical nemesis : AMA chief Dr. Morris Fishbein, the \"Voice of American Medicine\" for twenty-five years . These two figures came to personify the acrimoni ous schism dividing medici ne. In the McCarthyite wake of the 1950s, Hoxsey ultimat ely lost the war when the treatment was forced out of the country to Tijuana, Mexico. It was the first alternat ive clinic to set up shop south of the border . Hoxsey' s successor, nurse Mildred Nelson, has quiet ly treated patients there ever since . Like Hoxs ey, she claims a success rate as high as 80 percent, but her contention is unverifiable since the treatment has yet to be rigorously test ed. The campaig n against uncon ventional cancer therapies has contin­ ued to boil, and the story of Hoxsey remains acutely relevant because it vividly illustrates how this struggle is nothing new. Where just a hundred years ago medic ine was a rich grove teeming with diverse pract ices, it has been supplanted over the course of the twentieth century by a medical monoc ulture. How did this happen?"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"What radicall y tipped the balance of power was the arranged mar­ riage between organized medicine and big business. Only since 1900 has medicine transformed itself into a vastly lucrative indus try. Intent on elimi­ nating economic competit ion, this medical-indu strial complex has bal­ looned into today's $1 trillion medical- corporate state, within which can­ cer treatment is very big business . It has often been profitabilit y that has driven the adopt ion of official therapeutics, and, as we shall see, orga­ nized medicine has been far more successful at contr olling the cancer indus try than at contr olling cancer itself . Along with economic competition, at the heart of the conflict is also a pronounced polar ity of medical philo sophies . In truth , both tradit ions, known as the allopathic and empiric schools, have made important contri­ butions. Yet patients facing a life-threatening illness often poorly treated by conventional means have been denied access to all but the allopat hic brand of cancer treatment. Medical politics aside, Hoxsey may well represent a valuable cancer thera py. In these pages, you will travel through the unde rground of can­ cer patients who appear to have recovered using Hoxsey' s \"snak e oil.\" Their positive experience bespe aks the contemporar y renewal and vali­ dation of herbal and folk medicine. It marks the return to a rich materia medica empir ically gleaned by keen clinical obser vers and intuitive heal­ ers throughout the ages. Ironi cally, actual snake oil, the favorite archet ype of medical charla­ tanism, seems to have gotten a bad rap after all. Contempor ary resear ch has found it to have impo rtant therapeutic value, possibly even against cancer . It contains the same omeg a-3 essent ial fatty acids that have el­ evated fish oil to a highly prized therapeutic agent. Recent studies dem­ onstrate that natural compounds in these same fish oils increase immune response and prolong survival among cancer patient s. Snak e oil itself has a long histor y of medical usage that continues today in China, where it is successfull y employed to treat arthritis and skin disorder s.3 When resear cher Dr. Richard Kunin bought snake oil from a Chinat own herbal shop in San Francisco and subjected it to labor atory analysis, it proved to have even higher levels of key therapeutic fatty acids than does fish oil. Intrigued by the results, Dr. Kunin went on to test two U.S. species of rattlesnakes against the princi pal variet y used in China. He found that the Chinese species has at least five times the active con­ stituents of the others . How did Chinese healer s know? How is it that traditional and folk-medicine systems have consistently prefig ured and predated innumerable scient ific \"discoveries?\" Empiricism is a way of knowing based on direct obser vation and expe­ rience.

The herit age of this conflict between allo­ pathic and empiric philosophy is sharply expressed in Webster 's definit ion of empiric: \"One who enter s a practice without a professional education and the proper experience; a quack. \" In 1927 Dr. Morris Fishbei n, whose overarching influence would guide orthodox medicine for the rest of the century, wrote, \"Obviousl y a sys­ tem of therapeutics that depends on ancient empiricism in its use of drugs cannot hope to be permanent in the present system of scient ific medi­ cine.\"4 Clearly he never got to Chin atown, much less to China. When all the tangled politics are cut away, Hoxsey is really about plant medicine. Herbs are today enjoyi ng a renaissance and the Hoxsey tonic epitomizes the bounti ful botan ical legacy that is the cornerstone of moder n pharmacy. The very word drug derives from the Dutch term droog, which means \"to dry,\" since people have historicall y dried plants to make medici­ nal prepar ations. Whether the Hoxsey herbal tonic does successfully treat cancer rema ins an open question, but it is well proved that many botanicals possess powerful anticancer properti es. Several major chemotherapy drugs derive from plants, as do numerous primar y pharmaceut icals. The tragedy framing this story is that cancer has reached epidemic proportions. Cancer incidence in the United States has risen by 60 per­ cent just since 1950, and by twenty-seven times since 1900.5 Each year, a staggering 1.2 million Ameri cans-one in two men and one in three wom en-deve lop some form of internal cancer /' The cancer death ra te has also climbed preci pitous ly. Where in 1899 the disease killed 30,000 people, in 1999 over 560,000 died.7 Cancer is poised to become the top killer in the United States, making cancer treat­ ment the \"dominant specialt y\" of American medicine.x This most feared afflic tion has become the vety emblem of modern civilization. Ye t outside a small handful of success stories, the cure rate using con­ venti onal cancer treatments has hardly improved since the 1950s. Then as now, despit e $30 billion spent on the \"War on Cancer\" since 1971, over half of cancer patients die, every year more than twice as many Ameri­ cans as were killed in all of World Wa r 11.'1 As we shall see, credible critics say that even these disappointing success rates may be doctored to appear more favorable than they really are.

As we will also dis­ cover, a very large proportion of cancer is preventable, which is not a medical problem but a political one. The bottom line is that ever-growing numbers of patient s are turning to unconventional therapi es, with or without the approval of their physi­ cians . Va rying estimat es suggest that as many as 64 percent of cancer pa­ tients are now using alternatives, a startling figure suggesting the depth of desperat ion.10 Their footprints are easily tracked to places like Tijuana, the Bahamas, and Europe. Patient s are seeking alternative options despite or­ ganized medicine' s opposi tion, the lack of insurance coverage, and the fact that most doctors can provide little or no information about them. This runaway popular demand is triggering tectonic shifts in the ori­ entations of medical pract ice, government policy, insurance coverage, and the mass media. Alterna tive cancer therapies are gaining dramaticall y heightened prominence and some are already starting to enter the reper ­ toire of mainstream medicine. Ye t even now terminall y ill cancer patient s whose doctors have given them up to die are compel led to cross international borders in search of potent ially life-saving therapies. These basic human-rig hts issues are echo­ ing loudly through the halls of Congress, where a relentless movement of cancer patient s and activists seeking medical civil rights is steadil y influ­ encing public policy to allow more options for both patie nts and doc tors. What we may be witnessing at last is a rapprochement between these polarized camps, a long-overdue truce in the cancer wars. Conven tional medicine is approaching alternatives with a tentative handshake, though only time will tell whether the gesture is sincere or just a temporary con­ cession in the winner -take-all game that has dominated U.S. medical politics for so long. But what we are unequi vocally witnessing is a marked increase in for­ mal resea rch on alternat ive cancer therapies . The government' s creation of the Office of Alternat ive Medicine inaugurated a new openness, giving societ y permission to probe these taboo treatment s through unbiased resear ch and discussi on. The OAM has recently been elevated to the National Center for Complementary and Alterna tive Medicine with in­ creased funding, and other federal agencies including the National Can­ cer Instit ute are expanding their resea rch into alternat ives. Among the participants are top mainstream medical instit utions, univer sities includ­ ing Harvard, Columbi a, and Stanford, as well as elit e cancer center s such as Memorial Sloan-Kett ering and M.

This economic impe rative is acceler ating its legitimization and relaxing the political polarization. Using Hoxsey as a compass, these pages navigate this extraordin ary transf ormat ion. The book is divided into three main parts. Part 1 begins with the story of how I got involved with Hoxsey through making the film and describes my first life-chang ing visit with Catherine to the Bio Medical (Hoxsey) Center in Mexico. It goes on to explore the dramat ic recoveries ofHoxsey patients \"who got well when they weren' t supposed to.\" Subsequent chapt ers paint the colorful tableau of the rise and fall of the Hoxsey Cancer Clinic s until shortly after the government drove the treatment from the United States in the 1960s. Part 2 delves into the fascinating and long-standing conflict of medi­ cal opinion around the Hoxsey medicines. It probes both the science and folklore behind Hoxsey' s herbal tonic and external salves, and reveals sur­ prising evidence of bot h their possible worth and proven efficac y. It also examines the nutritional and attitudinal elem ents of the treatment, gen­ eral practices that are being scientificall y validat ed today. The therapeu­ tic investigation moves into a critique revealing the severe limitations of conventional cancer treatment s. Threaded throughout is the hidden his­ tory of how these two schools of medicine have been at odds for centu­ ries, culminating with the Hoxsey dispute as the quintessent ial moder n expression of this conflict. Part 3 cuts to the pitched cancer wars of the 1980s, when the antago­ nism between conventional and alternat ive cancer camps heated to a flash point, with Hoxsey sharing center stage . This clash unexpecte dly cata­ lyzed a historic shift and precipitated a shaky resolution that included the start of the first-ever gover nment investigation into Hoxs ey. Several chap­ ters look inside the profit-d riven corporat ization of the cancer industry and the commercial entry of alternat ive therapies. Subsequent chapters examine emerging solutions and \"polic y cures ,\" including basic human­ rights questions of freedom of choice, now gaining political moment um. Final ly, the book point s to the signs of a hopeful healing now under way, of both cancer and the wounds of medical politics.

I had a far more personal motive, however, for taking a serious interest. One evening in 197 6, over dinner at the small farm where I was living north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, I got a phone call from my mother. My father had cancer . Six mont hs later, at age fifty-five , he was dead. About two week s after my father's death, I received a newsletter in the mail unbidden . It contained testimonials of cancer patient s who swore that a complex nutritional program developed by dentist Donald Kelley cured them after their doctors gave them up to die. I read with shock, amazement, and disbelief. Like many people in 1977, I believed what the doctors told me: Can­ cer was largely incura ble. I certainly knew nothing of alternat ive treat­ ment s. I was skept ical, even hostile, to the idea, but with my father freshly buried and my heart broken, I was open. If there was anyth ing at all to this, I had to know. I started reading everyt hing I could get my hands on and spoke to anyone I could find who had a direct personal experi ence. I quickly dis­ covered a subterranean netherworld of purported cures using a variety of therapies -from nutrition and mental imaging to her bs and immunolog y. It was only when I came across an obscure article about the Hoxsey Can­ cer Clinics that a lightbulb flashed in my head, illuminating the warp I found myself in. The article by Peter Barry Chowka detailed the astonish­ ing social histor y of Hoxsey.7 I began to realize that, like most human affairs, medicine is political. Had ideol ogy buried science without an obitu­ ary? Were \"unort hodox\" treatment s being politicall y railroaded instead of scient ificall y tested? Chowka 's piece ment ioned Hoxsey' s autobiograph y, and I set out to find a copy.

I was a budding filmmaker at the time, and decided to channel my interest in alternative medicine into movi es. After my wife illustrated a book about southwestern herbs, I became friendl y with the herbalist au­ thor and ended up producing my first documenta ry, Los Remedios: The Healing Herbs, about the rich legacy of plant medicine in the Southwest. A friend showed the program to Cather ine Salveson, a registered nurse with a backgro und in cancer care, herbs, and media. Over lunch, I shared with her the story of Hoxsey. Catherine, who even in her nursing uni­ form bore an uncann y resemblance to singer Joni Mitchell, turned out to be extremely bright, articulate, and open. We connected strongly, and by the end of the meal, we resolved to make a trip to the Tijuana clinic to see for ourselves . Perhaps we would find a film there.

The van cruised easily through Mexi can customs and we entered another countr y. The only images in my mind of Tijuana were bare lightbulbs and dirty needles. Climbing steep hills overl ooking the city, we arrived early at the Bio Medical Center , as the Hoxsey clinic was now known .

If we wanted to know the real story of Hoxs ey, she said, go talk with the patients. Trailed by an entourage of clinic staff, Mildred moved so swiftly that she seemed to walk through walls, vanishing down a long hallway before we could open our mouths to respo nd. It was certainl y not the reception we planned after mont hs of anticipation and prepar ation . We wandered into the waiting room, which was filling with yet an­ other vanload of patients . We were on our own. The spacious room looked out grandly through large plate-g lass windo ws across the sprawl of bus­ tling Tijuana. Sunlig ht ignited the buzz of early-morning activity as medi­ cal orderlies started taking blood and performing other tests. The mood was definit ely not what we expect ed. People laughed, joked, and circu­ lated freely. As the day wore on, we came to recognize the new patients. They were the ones looking distressed and depres sed. As the hours passed, they shared the same experience we did, listening to countless older Hoxsey patients cheerfully tell how Mildred had cured them three, five, and twenty years ago. And healed their mothers, their neighbors, and their best friends. Even their dogs. A few said they'd been cured in Dallas in the '50s by Harry Hoxsey himself . We were stupefied. The stories were miraculous and they were legion . They involved almost every type of cancer, including the most deadl y forms such as pancreat ic, lung, and melano ma. Many people complained bitterly of prior abuse by doctors in the States, such as one lady who told how the doctor had removed one-and-a-half lungs, charged $100,000, and then in­ formed her he hadn' t expected it to work anyway. We also heard several accounts of relatives who had died while trying Hoxs ey, but who experi­ enced a relief of pain pronounced enough to stop taking paink illers. The treatment was inexpensi ve, too. Mildred then charged a one-time fee of $1,500. Many patient s paid in installment s as low as $5 a mont h, and those who were destitute paid nothing. In his book, Hoxsey said that this tradition came from his father's deathbed charge that no patient be turned away for lack of funds. Riding the van back to the cancer motel that afternoon, we fo und the mood decidedl y upbeat. The passeng ers laughed uproariously at the idea of writing a cancer patients' joke book.

We all knew we had crossed not just a political boundar y, but a philosophical border as well. After a couple of more days at the clinic, Catherine and I passed the better part of Memorial Day weekend holed up with Mildred in her small trailer next door where she had lived since coming to Tijuana. A once mobi le home, it was now stationar y atop the tiny pharmacy that originally served as the first Bio Medical Center . Acco rding to rumors, the beautiful new clinic next door was a former house of ill repute whose senora got busted on narcotics charges. Mildred put in an impr obabl y low bid on the repossessed estate and, to her amazement and delig ht, she got it. Imbibing a steady stream of coffee and smoking her trademar k long brown cigarett es, Mildred reg aled us in her thick Te xas twang with count­ less anecdotes ofHoxsey' s war with the AMA and FDA, stories regula rly seasoned with rambling recollections of remark able remissions. After a while, it became clear to us that Mildred was utterly sincere. She got involved with Hoxsey when her mother was successfully treated in Dallas in 1946 after being given up on by her doctors. Initially hostile, Mildred became a believer. The phone interrupted constan tly, day and night, with the frantic calls of cancer patient s from all over the United States, Canada, and the world. Mildred answered every call, no matter what day of the week or time of day. \"How would you as a cancer patient like to get an answering ma­ chine?\" she challe nged us sharp ly. As nurses on the front lines of caring for the sick, Mildr ed and Catherine under stood each other perfectly. In the course of convers ation, we learned chill ingly that Mildred had no successor . Sixty-five years old with two strokes behind her, she was searching. Interested doctors had come and gone, but none had the de­ votion and moxie it would take to preserve the contentious legac y. Be­ cause the Mexican government exacted a prohibit ive fee of $50,000 a year fo r work ing paper s for U.S. physicians, Mildred emplo yed solely Mexican doctors, none of whom had the political savvy, in her opinion, to keep the Hoxse y clinic alive. Either the right person will show up, she told us, or it will be lost. She seemed to have more serenit y about the prospect than we did. We had seen enough to convince us that this treat­ ment needed to be explor ed. At the end of the week end, Catherine and I looked at each other ner­ vously , and finally I popped the question. Could we make a film about Hoxsey? Perhaps a film would help spur an investigat ion. Mildred took one of her charac terist ically endless pauses, blowing smoke softly into the air. \"I've turned down everybody that' s ever asked, you know, \" she"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"10 III L.

Back in Santa Fe, we swiftly made plans. I had primary respons ibility for producing the film, since Catherine kept her day job, but we worked closely as coproducers . We started by holding a series of receptions for funders . As an independent filmmaker, you are actually very dependent­ on funding. Raising money for a movie is just slightly easier than raising the dead. The film addit ionall y started out with three strikes against it in 1984. It was the \"D\" word , document ary; the \"C\" word, cancer; and the \"P\" word, political. Filmmaking is often perceived as a somewhat glam­ orous occupation, but we quick ly learned that the surest way to deflate a conve rsation at a party was to say we were making a film-about cancer . Ye t we believed passionat ely in its impor tance, and if anything could make cancer entert aining, it would be the larger-than-lif e story of Hoxs ey. Over the next few months we raised enough money from good-hea rted angels and people int erested in natural medic ine to do the first shoot in Tijuana and start the resear ch. The film would take a harrowi ng four years to complete and launch us on an irrevocable journey into the mind­ bending realm of cancer politics. With only one hiatus after the initial filming, I managed to keep it funded continuously to completion, although it was whi te knuckles every step of the way, never knowing from week to week where the mone y would come from. Wo rking with film researcher Ray Hemenez, I began to grope my way into the vapor ous mists ofHoxs ey. Using You Don't Have to Die as a road map, we sought to confirm or deny its many seeming ly prepost er­ ous claims and allegations. Ray started in Dallas, exhausting all public records including newspaper s and court transcri pts. He also began to try to track down any living survivors of the strugg le. If there was a needle in a haystack, Ray invariably found the thread with it, too. One reason it took four years to produce the movie was that the docu­ mentation had to be impecca ble. I am a journalist, not a doctor or scien­ tist, and especiall y in matters of life and death like this, we all felt the acute responsi bility to be fastidio us in our factual accura cy. We gained access to the private files of the AMA , where we found a King Solomon' s Mines of materials. The AMA's Bureau oflnvestigation gathered and kept virtually every scrap of information on Hoxsey and generated a vast out­ put of its own. I sifted through original newspaper clipping s dating back to 1924 that were so brittle I feared they would disint egrate in my hands. I carefully examined everyth ing there, making voluminous notes and copies. We had to file twice through the Freedom of Information Act to get Hoxsey records from the FDA, which apparently still considered these"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Kl<lmg the Lancer Under ground 19 documents a threat to national securit y. We also tracked down obscure private collec tions across the countr y and searched all public and court records . At the completion of the film, the National Library of Medicine requested our resear ch as a donat ion to its archiv es.8 We did manag e to find a surpr ising number of individual players from the Hoxsey drama still alive. The terrain was as polarized as Bosnia or the Middle East, and both sides were deeply suspicious of us. The pro-Hoxsey people were often reluctant to talk, fearing reprisals comparable to the quack attack of the 1950s when federal and private health authorities in­ stigated a broad prosecutorial assault on unorthodox practit ioner s. The anti-Hoxsey forces were equall y hesitant, loath to risk letting the genie back out of the tonic bottle.9 Finally we manag ed to piece together most of the puzzl e. Some parts remained elusive . \"Facts\" swayed like seaweed in a shifting current. A neptunian haze clouded key events, while time and memor y lapses made verification of certain incidents impossibl e. Fraught with charges and coun­ tercharges , the story was riddled with irreconcilable dis pute and unprov­ able myste ry. Overall, though, a distinctive picture did finally emerge, which led me to call the movie Hoxsey: How Healing Becomes a Crime. But to grasp the slipper y story of Hoxs ey, it's necessar y to ask the central quest ion: Do people get well using the treatment?

There we met Mrs. Margaret Griffin, the Hoxsey patient whom we came to film.' Mrs. Griffin was graciously attired for her screen debut in a powder blue dress and pearl necklace. She had waited a long time to tell her story and was eager to start. Speaking with a distinctive Pennsylvania lilt, she related her encounter with cancer . \"Around November of 1966, I kept blacking out, and repeated X-rays in three different hospitals showed that I had two tumors around my aorta leading into my heart. The diagnosis was lymphosarcoma [cancer of the lymph system]. When my friend said to get another opinion, I went to two other doctors, and it was the same verdict: two tumors around the aorta. I didn' t want to accept that, but in time I had to. So I finall y went into one of the hospit als. A doctor did explorat ory surge ry, and he didn' t remove anything, but he scooped back a large area under my right breast from the front to the back. What he saw was two tumors blocking the superior vena cava (the vein leading into the heart ), lesions in the right lung, and cancer in all my lymph glands. \"I did take thirty treatment s of cobalt radiat ion,\" Mrs. Griffin contin­ ued, \"but I was rapidl y going down hill.

So I immedi ately wrote to her through the Enquirer, and fortunately some­ body forwarded it to Jeanne. It went through her secret ary, and one day I got a phone call from Lee Alexander, a wonderful guardian angel, as I call him. He had been a pilot with American Airlines, which flew into Dallas, and so he knew about the Hoxsey therapy. He proceeded to talk about Hoxs ey, and I knew that it was somet hing controve rsial because Harry Hoxsey went to court against the FDA and, of cours e, he lost. \"So Lee had befriended the secret ary and asked her, if anybody in­ quired about cancer , to turn their name over to him. That' s how he con­ tacted me to tell me about the Hoxs ey. I was recep tive because I knew my time was short. I had no other choice. If I die, I die, and all I'd lost was a few thous and dollars, and I don't even consi der that a great loss. I de­ cided I'm going. By that time the clinic had been closed, but Dr. Durkee had been part of the Hoxsey clinic and he had the formula. So under­ groun d, he would furnish a suppl y of the tonic.\" (Dr. Joseph Durkee was Hoxsey' s leading doctor at the Dallas clinic from 1946 to 1952 before a falling out with his emplo yer. He continued to tre at cancer patient s ille­ gally under ground with the Hoxsey formulas into the 1960s.) \"I had this premonition when I went out ont o the tarmac that Octo­ ber morning. It was a gorgeous morning, and the sun was shining on this great big silver plane that I called the silver bird. I had never flown . I was always afraid to fly, but I was determined that I had to go . So I walked out onto that tarmac and looked at that beautiful bird and I thoug ht, 'Y ou're taking me to life.' And it did.'' When she started her cancer odyssey, Margaret Griffin recalled that she was in very bad shape. \"I had just taken a leave of absence from work.

So I knew then that it was working. All of a sudden everything got better. By the tenth month, everything turned around. The X-rays of my chest where the two tumors were around my aorta showed that there were no longer tumors. I went back to work and I worked many years after that. From time to time I'd fly down to Dallas, get a supply of the tonic, bring it home. Here I am today to talk about it. It truly work ed.'' Eager to share her great good fo rtune with her physi cian, Mrs. Grif­ fin was shocked by his respons e. \"When I went back to my regular doctor who had originally diagnosed it, I was all thrilled. I made the appointment and his nurse said, 'I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin, but Dr. So-and -So doesn' t want you as his patient anymore because you didn' t believe in him.' So"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"11 IM I: VV IL UI:;) I ;)I V I'.I II'I I.I I:UI \\.. 1\"\\L MI;) IV I'\\1 that was the end of that. I thought, 'Well, forget you.' I'm going my way and I'm not going to be looking for troub le going to this doctor and that doctor. If I drop in my tracks , so be it. I figured this worked and that's how I live. I haven' t bothered to do any follow-up, and the Hoxsey works beautifull y.\" Mrs. Griffin told us she later paid the fee at the BioMedical Center to receive a lifetime supply of tonic, which she used continuously for eight years and intermi ttently since . She followed the Hoxsey program of the tonic and a prescribed diet. \"It's very simpl e. It doesn' t make you ill. Your hair doesn' t fall out like chemo, and it's almost too good to be tr ue, you might think. But it does work.\" In preparing this book, I decided to try calling Mrs. Griffin over ten years later to see if she was still alive. She answered the phone and hap­ pily told me that she is cancer-f ree at the age of seventy -nine , thirty-four years after starting Hoxsey . She does have heart trouble and other ail­ ments, but her greatest anguish lies elsewhere. \"My friends look askance at me,\" Mrs. Griffin said with exasperat ion. \"I've been able to convince a few people to go to Hoxsey and they too have benefit ed by it. But the major ity of people don't believe me, and they don't want to believe me. What can I do? I write letters to the editor and I loan that [Hoxsey} film out, but nobod y ever calls. We lost a daugh­ ter at the age of four to a brain tumor, and I was very suppo rtive at that time of the Amer ican Cancer Societ y, but I lost confide nce and faith in them . That was another reason why I thought I have to go this route . I think really we need anarchy in the streets. Then maybe we'll get some­ thing done .\" Surprising sentiments emanating from a staid Pittsburgh suburban neighborho od, though not uncommon ones. As we bounced around the country tracking down Hoxsey patients, we slipped into a kind of parallel universe of \"people who got well when they weren 't supposed to,\" as cancer surgeon and author Dr. Bernie Siegel terms these remar kable re­ coveri es. Like Mrs. Griffin, their stories have been stricken from the record . Orthodox medicine, rather than studyi ng such cases, dismisses them as \"anecdotal evidence\" lacking credibilit y since they were not part of a contr olled scientific study. Was Mrs. Griffin indeed cured by Hoxsey? Or possibly by the radiat ion she receiv ed? By other influences ? By stan­ dard measures, we do not know. For the film, we worked closely with Dr. Hugh Riordan to document the validit y of patient histories such as Mrs. Griffin's. Dr. Riordan is the head of a large Kansas clinic and former president of the American Ho­ listic Medical Association. In documenting new cases for this book as"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"\"People Who Got Well When They We ren't Supp osed To \" 23 well as recheck ing the others, I consulted with Gar Hildenbrand, whom you will meet again later in these pages. Former director of resear ch for the Gerson Instit ute, a nutri tional cancer therapy with its own belea­ guered histor y, the cancer activi st went on to become an epidemiolog ist, working for the OAM and other respected groups verifying medical data. I asked him and his partner Christeene Hilde nbrand to assess all of the cases discus sed here, for both the validit y of the medical records and the prognosis for their disease with the treatm ent they had. The Hildenbrands confirmed Mrs. Griffin's cancer diagnosis and com­ mented, \"This tumor was originally believed to have a particula rly ad­ verse prognosis. To day she would have been treated aggressively with chemotherap y and radiothe rapy. The outcomes of these combined treat­ ment s show approxima tely a 50 percent five-year survival rate. But when she was originally treated, the expectation would be for her cancer to recur after radiation thera py, even if the doctors had achieved complete remis­ sion, which we doubt they did. Her memor y of the event was that the cobalt therapy did nothing and her physician told her she had about a year to live. Without Hoxs ey, that prognosis would have been pretty accurate. \"2 In writing this book, I searched fo r more case histories of cancer pa­ tients who seem to have benefit ed from the Hoxsey treatment. While visiting Mildred, I noticed her reading a letter from New Zealand and inquired whom it was from. It turned out to be Gwen Scott, a breast can­ cer patient who started the Hoxsey Connection newsletter in her region .3 New Zealand and Australia are home to an unusual cluster of Hoxsey patients because a local medical doctor there, Dr. Eva Hill, journeyed to Dallas in the 1950s and received succe ssful treatment for a severe skin cancer on her face.4 Upon retur ning home, she began offering the Hoxsey treatment against considerable legal diffic ulties. Although a protracted and high-profile court clash with medical authorities was ultimat ely re­ solved in her favor, she continued offering Hoxsey for the rest of her many days under constant pressure from medical authorit ies. Dr. Hill cultivated a large and thrivi ng Hoxsey practice there, but after her death at the age of ninet y-two, patients like Gwen had to resume the trek to Tij uana. Speaking in a sing-song down-under dialect, Gwen Scott described to me her encounter with cancer . \"It started late in 1993. I had a lump on my breast for eight months. It was testing negative in the needle biops y [a method for diagnosing cancer ] in Januar y 1994, so I wasn't really wor­ ried about it, althoug h I have a family histor y-! lost a sister with breast cancer . I didn' t actually under stand that these biopsies are not always ac­ curate . It tested four times as being a benig n cyst, but it was growing all that time, and I wasn't happy about it.\""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"24 I HI: WI LUI::> I ::> IUKT 11\"1 lvi�UII...f\\L HI::> lU I'\\ I Gwen's general practit ioner wasn' t able to get her an appointment at the hospital because her biopsies showed up negative for cancer . \"In that eight-month period,\" Gwen recalled with a deep sigh, \"it grew huge, and when I was finall y seen, it was almost ulcer ating. It was about four inches long and about two inches around. It was certainly very cance rous and was described as 'Grade III, infilt rating carcinoma with vascular perme­ ation and axillary lym ph node metastases .\"' Gwen's condit ion is consi d­ ered a very advanced and usually deadl y breast cancer with involve ment of the lymph system . \"Vascular permeation\" implies malignant seed cells in the circulating cells, which would be very bad news. The addit ional circumstance that her case was initially misdi agnosed could easily have cost Gwen her life. When the biopsy showed potentially fa tal cancer , she opted for sur­ gery. \"I had a lumpect omy and then a mastectomy in the hospital here in August 1994, and the advice of the surgeon was that there's no [further ] treatment that would be any good because I was going to die anyway. There was no chemo or radiat ion-they were not offered to me. The doctor expected for it to be in the brain or lung within a month' s time­ that was August, September , 1994--and that October they expected me to be in a bad way.\" Gwen was also given Tamoxifen, a pharmaceutical drug used to treat breast cancer. \"What the surgeon actually said to me was, 'No treatment will do you any good because you are going to die anyway.' I asked, 'Well, when?' because I didn' t know whet her to spend what little inher itance money I'd thought was coming, get the bathroom fixed, or blow it all on a trip over­ seas. I really wanted to know when this demise was going to take place. He said, 'Within a month' s time you will be in a bad way, and then we will be able to tell more accurately when that demise will be.' There was noth­ ing more, in their opinion, that would help me.\" Gwen decided to take action on her own, a pattern typical of many cancer survivo rs. She saw it as the cruci al moment to take personal re­ sponsibilit y for her situation by doing some homework. \"At that time I didn' t feel like dying and I also had a problem. I got partially paralyzed for some reason, whether it was a reaction to their drugs or whatever it was. No medical doctor could actually give me a reason of what it was, and that started me searching in librar ies. I did start straig htaway on a course of antioxidants [vitamins, minerals, and other natural substances believed to have anticancer activity and other healt h benefit s] and thing s like that. \"Visiting the libraries and looking at things on breast cancer medicall y as well as on alterna tives was so confusing, because every time I found"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"reop1e vv no uot vve11 vv nen 1 ney weren't :Supposed To \" 25 something, I would go back to the doctors, and they either didn' t know what I was talking about or didn' t have an answer for it. I graduall y lost respect for them, but I did gain a knowl edge that they actually didn' t know a hell of a lot about. In that time, I was searching for something that would suit me. \"I could not plow myself through all the different confusing and con­ flicting report s, medicall y as well as alternat ive. I didn' t have the faith in either to provide me with any answers because there were so many con­ flicting reports. The more you read, the more confusing it became . I really had to go by the cost, for one thing, and the easiest to foll o w, be­ cause I'm basicall y a lazy person. And the highest success rate. That was pretty obvious : It was the Hoxse y treatment. \" Gwen was still not sure what to do. The clinic lay thousands of expen­ sive miles away. Like most cancer patients, she was starkly confronting her looming mortalit y and still had little solid information to go on. \"I couldn' t say that I was act ually praying for help-1 suppo se, medit ating and asking for guidance to find somet hing. I went into a secondhand book shop. A book fell off the shelf at my feet. I picked it up and put it back. It fell off again. So I actually bought it for $3, and it was a book called Cancer and Cure. It told the story of Dr. Eva Hill. The same day I also bought a magazine from a healt h food store which told the story of the [Hoxsey] clinic in Tijuana . I got in touch with the writer and the editor of the magazine and got the phone number . I rang the clinic. \"I started immediat ely on the Hoxsey treatment through the generos­ ity of Mrs. Nelson, on a trial basis. Another patient was able to put me on it until I was financially able to make the trip over to Ti juana. The clinic told me that ifl could stay cancer-free for two years, I may have a chance .\" Gwen began to feel a portentous effect immediatel y. \"The first night I took it, I had a wonderful sleep. The feeling of well-being was almost immediat e. I had an incredible dream .\" Gwen soon noticed palpable physical progr ess. \"I did have other lumps, which may or may not have been cancer [on the other breast and under the arm] that disappeared . I didn' t actually know that I had them until the oncologist here said, 'Oh, those lumps have gone.' \"One of the things I found quite surprising was the oncolog ist here told me I was wasting my money, which I thought was funny, because I didn' t have any money. It wasn' t a problem. Hoxsey seemed the right thing to me all the way through . I'm cancer-fre e. All around, the whole thing has been immensel y successful for me.\" Gwen Scott has now passed the five-year survival mark since her diagnosis, the medical standard to deem a cancer patient cured. After"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"26 THE WILD EST STORY IN MEDIC AL HISTORY starting Hoxs ey, she is compl etely free of cancer with a stage of disease that her doctors expected would kill her in a matter of mont hs. Her medical records confirm her original cancer as well as malig nancy remaining af­ ter her surgery. Mter confirming Gwen's documentat ion, the Hilden brands also vali­ dated her grave prospe cts. It included an \"invasive neoplasm [cancer tu­ mor] with the poorest prognosis of all ductal cancers\" at a stage consid­ ered the worst. The fact that it infilt rated ten different lymph nodes again put her in the worst category for recover y. \"Even using Ta moxif en,\" they went on, \"she would have been expected to have a recurrence within the first couple of years, and the staying power of the drug is under two years [after it is discontinued] .\" However, because Gwen did receive Ta moxifen, her case is not en­ tirely clear-cut. She did stop the drug after two years and has not taken it for over three. Because most Hoxsey patients have previously received various forms of conventional treatment, her case is representat ive of the ambig uity characterizing many such cases . What seems certain is that she was not supposed to get well. Through Gwen, I came in contact with Rex Major , a retired police­ man from New Zealand who shared with me his struggle against both the disease and his doctors. His personal drama exemplified the tug-of­ war that has plagued Hoxsey patie nts since the 1920s. Rex checked into the emergency room in 1993 feeling \"terrible.\" He ascribed his condit ion to his diabetes and a severe flu. Following a blood test and colonosc opy (internal examination of the colon) in September , he was diagnosed by an Austra lian doctor with Duke 's C cancer of the colon, a very serious form of the disease. He had major surgery to re­ move the tennis-ball- sized tumor. Conva lescing at home, he got a call a week later from the doctor, who told him that a biopsy revealed four lymph nodes invaded by carcinoma that was metastasizing, spreading else­ where . Rex asked what his options were, and the doctor gave only two: chemother apy or face death in three to six mont hs. \"I was fortunate in having a cancer resea rcher as a friend and associat e here in New Zealand ,\" Rex related passionat ely to me, \"and this guy gave me information and showed me documenta tion and an admissio n by the oncolog y depar tment at Auckl and Hospital on the subject of chemo­ thera py. That article indicated that, of every two hundred people that went through the oncolog y department at Auckl and Hospit al, one hun­ dred and forty are dead in two ye ars. Now my quest ion was, 'What hap­ pened to the other sixty?' The answer was they went through all the traumas of the adverse reaction to the chem otherapy. I said, 'No, I'm"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":".. People Who Got We ll When They We ren't Supposed To \" 27 not going to do that.\"' Because chemotherap y drugs are powerful and debilit ating poisons, many patients such as Rex Major consi der the treat­ ment as devastating as the diseas e. (For a full discussion of chemot herapy and conventional cancer treatment s, see chapter 15.) Rex Maj or recalled his confrontation with the oncologist over his re­ jection of chemotherap y. \"He rang me up, and he and I had a real set-to over the telephone. I told him, 'I am going to discontinue this conve rsa­ tion. I'm going to put the phone down because I will not have you plant­ ing any seeds of doubt in my mind. I have made my decision. Thank you for your advice and I appreciate what you've done. This is my existence we're talking about. I'm going to be in control of it from here on.'\" Rex started shopping around for other choices. \"I didn' t just settle on Hoxsey straigh taway. I actually looked at eight different options. I elimi­ nated the ones that I didn' t like, particularly chemotherapy once I'd inves­ tigated it. Being a policeman all those years, I always investigate anyth ing that I get involved in, and when my life was at stake I had the utmost motivation to be sure that I was doing exactly the right thing. So it was a case for me of checking these out, ticking them off as they fell by the waysi de, and ending up with one. Not that there's anything wrong with a lot of the others. There was quite a lot of merit with some of them, but they didn't fit the bill for me.\" Part of Rex's latter working career was with the Dale Carnegie Orga­ nization, famous for its utiliz ation of the \"Power of Positive Thinki ng.\" Through the group, he knew a former Hoxse y patient and decided to hear her story. Yvonne Chamberlain recounted to him her brush with melanoma, a deadl y form of skin cancer . She had no other treatment and credited Hoxse y with saving her life. \"I was blessed with the information on what to do when my turn came to be diagnosed with cancer ,\" Major related to me. \"Yvonn e's recom­ mend ation and the conve rsations I had ove r the telephone with Mildred in those early days convinced me that that's what I needed to do. So, three weeks to the day, I was on an airpla ne. I went through the airports in a wheelchair . My wife had to be alongside me because I was still pretty weak after the operation, but I got myself over there as quickl y as I possi­ bly could. My experience was one of amazement, particula rly at the facil­ ity. I was really taken with this beautiful big building that looks like some­ thing out of Gone With the Wind. A big bird aviar y in front and a beautiful view looking back toward San Die go-it's a marvelous place .'' Rex Maj or started treatment immediat ely with the Hoxsey tonic and diet. \"The thing that I was intrigued about was the attitude of most of the people in the waiting room. There' s an awful lot of very sick people there,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"28 THE WILDEST STORY IN Mt:UIL AL HI::>I V�T usually the first-t imers. But the laughing and the jokes and the friendly camaraderie that are created in that place are somet hing to behold. I was very, very taken with the place, and very taken with Mildr ed.\" Rex quickly began to feel posit ive effects from the treatment. He lo­ cated a new doctor in New Zealand who worked closel y with him to test and monitor his ongoing condit ion, including regular examinat ions of his colon. \"I've got some beaut iful, clear Te chnicolor photographs of the inside of my colon, which is in perfect condition today. \" Six years later, Rex Major is cancer-f ree. Did Rex Major in fact have cancer in the first place? The official biopsy reports confirm that he did. Was he cured by prior surgery? He still had the disease in his lymph nodes when he went to Hoxs ey, as a biopsy show ed. Was Rex Major really cured by Hoxsey? The Hilde nbrands assessed Rex's case. \"He refused chemot herapy from a physician who was very concerned about recurr ence. The staging of the cancer had a very poor prognosis . The five-year survival rate for Duke 's C is only 15 percent with state-of -the-ar t contempor ary treatment, including chemothe rapy. The fact that he did not receive this makes him a rarity indeed. Althoug h one would not want to argue that surgery alone might not result in the occasional random cure, it would be foolish to argue that the Hoxsey management might not have contribut ed.\" Colon cancer, the second lead­ ing cause of cancer deaths in the United States, is considered one of the most curable only if it is found in the early stages.5 Could Rex Major be the rare one in 100,000 case of spontaneo us re­ mission? Could there be other factors besides the Hoxsey tonic respon­ sible for his recover y, such as his faith and posit ive attitude? These kinds of questions can be answered definit ively only by an ob­ jective scient ific test. The recoveri es of Rex Major, Gwen Scott, and Margaret Griffin would all be discounted by the orthodox medical pro­ fession as unscientific anomalies whose causes cannot be known outside carefull y contr olled studi es. Doctors have often contended that patients such as these were actually cured by prior conventional treatment s of surge ry, radiation, or chemotherap y. Their cases fit the classicall y intrigu­ ing but inconclusive profile ofHoxsey patients caught in a medical hall of mirrors amid a confusing volley of claims and counter claims. The case of Mrs. Martha Bond was more clear-cut, however. In 1986 our film crew traveled to Colorado to visit with this soft-spok en woman of about sixty years of age. She sat shyly behind tinted glasses in a perfectly pressed white dress as she told us her remark able story from the heart of middle America ."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"r-eop1e vv no �o t VVell VV hen 1 hey Weren't Supposed To \" 29 \"I first noticed it in about 1974-a mark on my cheek-but we didn' t pay any attention to it because it was flat and there was no pain. We never thought it was cancer . Then in 1979 I got a dark mark on my leg, and that started to grow faster and it raised up high. So I told my husband about it. He's blind, so he didn' t see it, but he felt it. He said, 'Oh, that' s cancer . We 'd better go down to Tijuana to the Bio Medical Center .' \"We went down there and they looked at it. They gave me the tonic and vitamins, and told me to keep taking it and to call them back and let them know how I was doing. That was in April. Around August, a friend of ours thought we ought to get a second opinion, so we went to our local doctor, a skin doctor, and he said that it was melanoma cancer . So he suggested I see Doctor X, a surgeon, and have it surgi cally remove d. We asked Dr. X if there was any way we could take it off just locally by put­ ting any salve or taking any tonic. He said, 'No way. There's no way but surge ry. If you don't go into surge ry, you're not going to li ve long. ' I said to him, 'I've been taking somet hing, a tonic, and it is getting flatter.' He says, 'No, it just can't.' He wanted to put me in the hospital that next week. \" Melanoma is an especiall y deadly form of cancer . Usually manif esting as a black mole on the skin, it is not considered solely a skin cancer readil y treatable by surgery because it also can spread internall y to form tumors elsewhere with frightening speed. Surger y can be effective if the tumor is entirely removed before it has spread, but the knife can be a chancy propo­ sition because cutting can spread it rapidly through the body. Doctors generally advise immedi ate and radical surgery for early-stage melanoma. Advanced melanoma is almost always fatal, with an expected survival time of only about seven mont hs. Mrs. Bond' s surgeon clearly saw her cond i­ tion as very urgent and dang erous . Mrs. Bond held up her hands to show our camera the size of the tumors. \"The large one on my face was about a silver-dollar size, and the one on my leg was not quite as large, but it was thicker and deeper. The second one on my leg would be about a dime size or maybe quarter size. They just kept forming pus and blood around them.'' After several mont hs on the tonic, Mrs. Bond contacted the clinic again. \"We talked to Mildred Nelson ,\" she remembered, \"and she looked up my records and said I must come down there and they would remove it, and not to let anyone cut it at all. So we went down to the clinic. It took three week s.\" This time, Mildred applied the external salves. \"While I was taking the tonic, the one on my leg was going down and getting flatter after three and a half mont hs. Mildred said that was a big"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"30 THE WILD EST STORY IN MEDICAL HISTORY help that it was going down. Then she put on a salve right directly on the two lesions . I could feel the feelers going to the roots of the cancer . She said not to touch it, and all we did was leave this cotton on it. When enoug h pus and blood seemed to form around them, they just fell out automaticall y. As soon as they fell out, there was no more pain. It was only painful while they were eating their way out. That' s all Mildred did. In three week s, they just fell out by themsel ves. \"When the second one was removed from my leg, there was one dot left, just like a pinhead, very small . She said, 'If we don't remo ve this, you're going to be sorr y because it's go ing to spread, and then we've got to start over again .' So, we started over again with the salve, and that took about ten days, and then that one came out. Then she just put another salve on my face, and that closed up the opening on my cheek and that's all we did.\" We asked Mrs. Bond what the conventi onal procedure proposed to her would have been. \"The original surgeon wanted to scrape my face. If he had, he'd have left all these roots in my face. He told me that the hole he would cut on the one on my leg would be about the size of a fist. Now I only have just a slight indentation there. But if he had done the same for my face-b ecause it was just as large on my face, if not larger, than on my leg-he'd have taken half of my face off. This way I have just a very slight scar. \"This was seven years ago and I am still here,\" Mrs. Bond said proudl y, holding up a mason jar of pic kled tumors . \"I asked Mildred to let me have these cancers because I wanted them in a jar so I could show other people to prove that it really works . I would go around in the clinic and show all the people this cancer in the jar. I said, 'Look, I'm walking around carry­ ing my cancer in the jar instead of inside of me, which is much better.' It made them happy to think it really works . I've kept it, wondering what I should do with it, but I thought I should keep it in case I meet someone else that needs the encouragement of seeing this.'' Mrs. Bond provi ded us not only with the biopsy from her original doctor, but also with an alarming letter from the surgeon she consulte d. It read, \"Mrs. Bond, the skin tumors that you have are a very serious problem and I would urge you to reconsi der this decisi on. I would strongly urge you to have these lesions surgicall y remo ved. Local therap y is not effective in treating a malig nant melanoma, and these tumors will spread and ultimat ely result in your death, if not surgically remov ed.'' The Hilde nbrands confirmed her recor ds. They indic ated that the prognosis for leaving melanoma untreated is extremel y poor, and the likelihood of surviving for seven years is very small, as her doctor stated"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"··t'eople vv no (..ot VVell vvnen 1 ney vveren·t ::,upposed lo\" 31 in his fatalistic letter. The sole treatment she had was Hoxs ey. (After this time, I lost track of Mrs. Bond and could not ascertain her status.) Only after first putting Mrs. Bond on the tonic for several mont hs did Mildred Nelson apply both a caustic red paste and a yellow powder di­ rectly to the tumors . The salves \"ate\" and removed the tumors, and Mildred then kept Mrs. Bond on the tonic for five years. Like Har ry­ Hoxsey before her, she views melanoma as both an internal and extern al phenom enon. What are these external remedies? The red paste and yellow powder, whose formulas have been published and are discussed in depth later along with all the Hoxsey remedies, are escharoti cs, caustic substances that burn tissue and kill cells. Escharotics are an old form of folk medicine with a long histor y of popular usage in both human and veteri nary medicine. Surpr isingly, organized medicine has not disputed the efficac y of these treatment s since around 1950 and classifies them as a \"standard\" treat­ ment, thoug h one that is seldom if ever used. The red paste is a \"true\" escharotic that will \"eat\" anyth ing it touches. It is intensely painful. Mildred uses it mainl y on large tumors . \"You apply it daily over a period of time,\" she descr ibed. \"You start at the top and go to the bottom of the tumor. When it comes out, when this dies, it sepa­ rates just like you cut it out with a knife.\" The red paste contains several chemical and mineral ingredients, as well as bloodroot, a plant used on extern al cancers by Native Americans for centuri es. The yellow powd er is a modified eschar otic, unusual because it is claimed to be selective , killing only malig nant cells. Normally it is ap­ plied topicall y on the surface. \"The tissue where you put it that is malig ­ nant dies,\" Mildr ed explained. \"Only the malig nant part dies. Then it separates itself from the normal tissue by an accumu lation of white cells underneath, which pushes it off. It separates cleanl y. I have put the yellow powder in the eye.\" To emphasize its safety, Mildred dipped her fingers in a small jar of the powder , ate a pinch, and arched her eyebrows provocatively. It can also be injected internal ly, as the case of Stephen Crutch er, presented in chapter 13, demon strates. While filming, we observed Mildred treating several external cases . One man had a cavity in his upper back and shoulder at least three inches deep, a hideous, foul-smelling cancer . She peered intent ly over her bifo­ cals and extended long agile fingers that looked like those of a young woman. To clean the festering mass, she dipped a cloth into a large bowl contain­ ing Pine Sol, which she uses as a disinf ectant. Pine Sol is an off-the-shelf house-cleaning fluid she favors as the most effective agent not only for disinf ecting these masses, but also for eradi cating their unbearable stench ."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"32 THE WILD EST STORY IN MEDIC AL HI::, I UKT Several patients told us that this treatment marked the first time they were relieved of the horri fic odor that intensi fied their disco mfort and made it hard to be around other people. Mildred sprinkled some of the yellow powder into the gaping wound with a large Q-t ip, and dressed it with bandages. The patient seemed none the worse for wear, put his shirt back on, and went off to the waiting room. Mildred retreated across the room to her desk. Expansive picture win­ dows looked out over Tijuana across to the U.S. border in the distance. She started another cigarette and settled comfortably into her spacious chair , framed by a photograph of natty Harry Hoxsey hanging on the wall behind her. The streaming sunlig ht highlighted deep lines on her weathered face as she ruffled through a folder and readied herself for the next case. Patients walking to consult other clinic doctors necessaril y tra­ versed the hallway at the open end of her office, and she nodded know­ ingly to each of them. We found the Bio Medical Center a modern, competent ly run facil­ ity. Employ ing six Mexi can physicians, the clinic had a laborator y, X-ray quarters, and a professional staff. It has always been an outpatient clinic, and except for external cases that may take several week s or mont hs to treat, most people spend about two days going through tests and then meeting with Mildred and the doctors . If they have cancer , they get a bottle of Hoxsey tonic that lasts about six months, along with other sup­ portive treatment s and instructions for the special diet. The clinic today charges a one-t ime fee of $3,50 0, plus the costs of tests. If necessar y, patients are permitted to pay on an honor -system in­ stallment plan. The clinic has never sent out a bill, and does not even have the administ rative appar atus for mailing invoices. Poor people are treated free, contingent on verification of their need from a minis ter, doctor, or another reputable party. Organized medicine has long accused the Hoxsey clinic of financiall y exploiting cancer patients. We found no evidence to suppor t the charge . \"My surgeon got so mad,\" chimed in Stella Gladis, a patient in for a checkup . \"When he found out I wouldn't take chemot herapy and radia­ tion from his friends, then he really screamed and hollered at me. He said, 'Why are you going down there? They'll only take all your money.' I said, 'Uh- uh-'cause you already did!\" Stella Gladis paid $900 for her Hoxsey treatment. She estimated her bills from her cancer operations in the tens of thousands of dollars. The famous Hoxsey tonic, which comes in a large old-f ashioned glass bottle, is a dark brown liquid tasting a bit like flat root beer. It contains potassium iodide and herbs. (For people with stomach sensit ivities or"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"r-eop1e vv no (.;Jot Well When They Weren't Supposed To \" 33 ulcers, there is another form called the \"pink tonic\" in a base oflactate of pepsin without a couple of the laxative herbs .) A strict diet emphasizing fruits and vegetables is recommended in tandem with the tonic. Acco rding to Mildred, it evolved mainly from empirical observation that certain foods appear to negate the tonic' s ac­ tivity. Compared with many natural foods dietary programs for cancer , it is a relatively simple progra m. The clinic also offers a multit ude of suppor tive treatments, including vitam ins, yeast, garlic, and a host of other natural medicines. The list changes as Mildred lear ns about new devel opments, and she is perpet u­ ally experimenting with new treatment s that she hopes may help. There is another ingredient to the treatment that Mildred considers essent ial. Sitting back in her reclining office chair , she squinted with a fierce gaze, exhibiting the no-nonsense gravity of someone who sees a lot of serious illness. \"Probably the greatest success comes with the patient' s attitude. When they come in the front door saying, 'I'm here to get some medicine because I'm going to get well,' then I'm just as happ y as they are. But when they come through the door saying, 'Well, I don't think anyth ing's going to help, but they wanted me to do this' \"-Mildred gri­ maced- \"you can't make 'em get well. They have to want to do it them­ selves.\" There is a term in Spanish flamenco called duende. The best dance rs are said to carry it with them always . Duende signifies the awareness that death is always on our shoulder , ready to take us in the wink of an eye. Its gift is the heightened awareness of the precariousness and preciousness oflife. Cancer patients dance with duende, bringing a palpable immedi acy to life. To face cancer fully demands a choice, Mildred suggests, at the inescapable moment of truth when the result s of the tests come back. Whatever the outlook may be, people must first want to live. Only then can healing happen. Many patients we met had made this choice to live. According to Mildred, getting well at the BioMedical Center is a healing partner ship that takes two to work. After spending considerable time at the clinic and filming repeatedl y, we became convinced that Mildred Nelson' s dedic ation as a nurse and her belief in the Hoxsey treatment are genui ne. A cross between Mother Te resa and Calamit y Jane, she certainl y never expected the life she has led. A compassion ate caregiver, she despises politics almost as much as sitting in front of a camera. Unlik e Harry Hoxs ey, she has long shunned both controversy and publici ty. \"The first question the press may ask,\" Mildred sharply told our cam­ era, \"is, 'What' s your fight with the AMA? ' I have no fight with anybody."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"34 THE WILD EST STORY IN MEDIC AL HIS IUKT I try to do the thing s that I know are right for the people, take care of 'em, help 'em.

They were like the ones she herself first heard when she came to the Hoxsey clinic in 1946, like the cases she would share with resea rchers from the Office of Alternative Medicine arriving in 1997 with Catherine to pore over records. They were what Harr y Hoxsey built his career on and what won him an unlik ely series of court trials all the way to the federal bench. But they were not suf ficient to get the investigation he pleaded for. The cases documented here are but a modest sampling, tantalizing leads tracked down by an independent journalist and a public health nurse. Although they are in no way definit ive, one might expect such seeming successes to provoke interest from the medical communit y. \\Vhy did it take the government seventy-five years to investig ate? It is hard to believe that such a seemi ngly harmless program of a non­ toxic herbal tonic, folk salves, a nutri tional program, and an attitudinal approach to healing ignited one of the most bitter controve rsies in medi­ cal histor y, a spectacular cancer war between organ ized medic ine and one man: Harry M. Hoxs ey. Since the Hoxsey treatment has never been rigorously investigated, the quest ion remains : Wa s Harry Hoxsey a hoax, or was he \"the quack who cured cance r\"? We set off to find out for oursel ves."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"3 A Formu la for Conflict O ne afte rnoon in Mildred' s trailer, Catherine and I were relaxing after a strenuous day of filming. Mildred arose abruptly from her Lazy-Boy recliner and whisked to the closet. She emerged mysteriously with a large film can and handed it to us. It cont ained Harry Hoxsey' s own movie, a promoti onal film we had not known about made at the Dallas clinic in 1957.1 Incredulous at our great good fortune, we raced back to San Di­ ego, rented a 16 millimeter projector, and gazed at the black-and -white imag es flickering on the motel wall. The film opened with a title card displa ying the antique cameo of a horse grazing by a steepled church, above the words: \"This is a film based on a story of intolerance, in the best American tradition. Our fathers left us with a heritage of Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Religion, and Free­ dom of Choice. If you have the right to choose your own church, your own minister or priest, why not your own doctor? \" Then there was Harr y Hoxs ey, larger than life. A big man wearing a snapp y suit and diamond ring, he cut an embat tled figure. He was hag­ gard, with deep blac k bags under his eyes, but fire burned through his fatigue. \"We now have in our files and our records many, many thou­ sands of case histories, pathological proof s, and X-ray photogra phic studies showing that we do positivel y cure cancer , both internal and extern al. We now have records proving the cure stands up for many, many years, as far back as over twenty years here in Te xas.\" Later in the film, holding up a copy of his newly published book, which he had just sent to every senator and representa tive in Washing­ ton, he thumped on his big desk and thundered, \"This book, entitled You Don't Have to Die, is filled with dynamite. In fact, it should have been printed on asbest os paper . I give you names, dates, times, names of doc­ tors, names of instit utions. But they have never proven this treatment don't cure cancer .\" It was easy for the medical profession to paint Hoxsey as a quack: He 35"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"36 I HI: VVILUI:� I �I UK.T IN lvi i:UI I....

His fast-talking, carniv al-bar ker manner pegged him as the huckster of the ages. Throughout his career , he was buffeted by a tempest uous con­ flict of medical opinion. The surviving players from the Hoxsey melo­ drama reflected these wildly divergent views . \"He knew the tre atment work ed,\" commented Mildred Nelson matter­ of-factly. \"He had no doubt in his mind that he was going to get all of them well if he could get a chance to get them.\" The AMA could not have disag reed more vehemen tly. \"He did per­ suade people that he had somet hing of merit, and that he was being treated unfairly, \" said Oliver Field, who zealously pursued Hoxsey while heading the AMA's anti-q uackery Bureau of Investigation in the 1950s. \"The idea of being for the underdog is one of the things that most people have in their way of thinking-they favor them. He wasn't an underdog at all, as fa r as the medical profession was concer ned. He was doing his thing and he had no business doing it. In fact, Hoxsey met the legal and dictionar y defi­ nition of a quack: one who pretends to medical skill he does not possess .\" \"Some people say that if you walk like a duck and look like a duck and quack like a duck, you must be a duck, \" observed James Wakefield Burke, an accomplished journalist who wrote about Hoxsey and briefly worke d fo r him. \"Man y people judged Ha rry at first impression like that, which didn' t always bide good with strang ers and certain officials in the AMA a nd in Washingt on. But those who got to know him, you didn' t think that. He had a great deal of basic nobilit y about him, and any person with any intelligence would see that.\" \"I think everybody agrees that he was a great con man, a great salesman ,\" countered William Grigg, public affairs director of the Food and Drug Ad­ ministration , which battled Hoxsey for over a decade. \"He was the kind of person who understood the value of publici ty. Even though he was a very poorly educated man, he was very good at playing all the angles and wrap­ ping up state governments, the AMA, and the FDA itself. Clearly, however, he had no belief that this treatment was useful. He was a great liar.\" \"As a crime reporter for ten years,\" remembered Jimmy Kerr, a Dal­ la s TV newsman who covered Hoxsey for many years, \"I was pretty good at recognizing a con man a mile off. Hoxsey was a bit of a used-car sales­ man, but I really don't believe he was a con man. He certainly believed in what he was doing. And I have to say, personall y, that I believe he truly helped some people with cancer .\" \"For internal cancer he had absolutel y nothing to offer,\" charged Dr. l lan y M.

It takes lots of nerve to put up a big nice place in a big city like Dallas and hold yours elf out as being able to furnish medicines that'll cure cancer . It takes nerve to do that. I don't believe a man that knew he was lying could do it. Be hard to do.\" \"Mr. Hoxsey was a rainma ker,\" offered Robert Heath, the director of the Dallas Count y Medical Societ y and son of its past director, Millard Heath, whom Hoxsey sued in the 1950s. \"There were people who des­ perately needed an answer to the problem they had. Whet her he had the answer or not, he was able to persuade them that he had the answer. The interesting thing about it is that, even with the rainmaker who used to travel the country during the late 1800s and early 1900s, occasiona lly it would rain. There were enough people who felt they were benefited that caused Mr. Hoxsey to be succes sful.\" \"Dad was always what I would call eighty/twen ty,\" added Hoxsey' s son. \"Eighty percent of what he said was true, but he couldn't resist em­ bellishing thing s that extra 20 percent. He didn' t have to do it, but that's the way he was. He was a bit of a showman .\" These living players helped me const ruct a unique oral history of Hoxsey never recorded elsewhere . Several died not long after we filmed them, includ ing] ames Burke and Jimm y Mart in. When I located Hoxsey' s son and daughter, they spoke to me only on the condition of anonymity because they had once been so severel y stigmatized as the childr en of a \"quack. \" I have respected their priva cy, just as I have omitted details of Hoxsey' s personal life because I do not find it germane to the central meaning of the story: his quest for an investig ation. He was a ladies' man, married four or possi bly five ti mes. Other wise, he was a man obsessed with his mission, and that is what this book explores. Through exhaustive research , I was able to document much ofHoxsey's story. Where account s are at odds, I have tried to present the dispar ity of views and allegations. For Hoxsey' s youth and very early years , there is primar ily his own account. By the founding of his first clinic in 1924, I was able to find substantial documentation against which to measure his own rendering of events . In subsequent periods, I found a great deal of other material to confirm, deny, or color his depiction of the story.2"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"38 THE WILDEST STORY IN MEDIC AL HISTORY Harry Hoxsey was an American original. \"I come of pioneer stock,\" he attested in You Don't Have to Die, a self-aggrandizing chronicle amply color­ ized with the Hoxsey legend. He traced the original \"Hoxie\" lineage from Scottish, English, We lsh, and Dutch stock back to Plymouth Colony in 1650. According to Hoxs ey, early colonial records indicate that the family became Quak ers and ran into trouble with hostile local authoriti es. \"The Friends are a religious fellowship without formal creed or priest ly hierar ­ chy,\" he wrote, \"hence the Hoxseys were inclined to reject all religious, political or scientific dogma, to deny the authorit y of witch-doctors of any kind to impose their theories upon the communit y as divine doc­ trine. The Friends are opposed to violence, regard human life as sacred; hence the Hoxsey conviction that the preser vation of human life is the sacred duty of all men, not merely those entitled to add 'M.D.' to their names .'' Throughout his career , Hoxsey cultivated the persona of a popu­ list folk healer and work ing-class hero. The family migrated to Rhode Island and later to West Virginia, Ken­ tucky, and finally Illinois, where Harry Mathias Hoxsey was born on October 2 3, 1901, in the small burg of Auburn near Springfield, the state capital. His father was John C. Hoxs ey, a veterinarian who had inherited his own grandf ather' s cancer formulas. John C. became known in the region for treating animals with cancer and tumors, and boarded sick horses during winters for the Ringling Brothers ci rcus. }{nmg Hany Hoxsey (sitting on his fa tlm·'s knee) with fa mily, c. 190 5."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"/\"\\ rOrll lUid lUI \\,... UIIIII I.. L �7 By the turn of the century the fertile farmlands of southern Illinois were giving way to coal mines, smok estack s, and waves of poor European immigrants. Flush wages for miners spawned a boom town rush of rau­ cous saloons, gambling joints, and brothels. Industr ialism was ascendant, and so was cancer . Va cating the small Auburn farm, John C. Hoxsey set up shop in a modest home office in small-t own Girard, where he quietly began treat­ ing cancer patients under the auspices of two local do ctors . In a cramped livery stable next to the town square, he kept a stock of the three medi­ cines in locked cabinet s along with bandag es and surgical dressings. Each summer the veterinarian return ed to the family farm to brew a year's supply of the cancer remedi es. Harr y, the baby of twelve children, was the only one to show an interest in the cancer work, and started appren­ ticing with his fa ther at the age of eight. Harry Hoxsey' s defining moment shone during the first healing he wit­ nessed as a young boy assisting his father. Cancer sufferer John Fromm ie, a prominent local citizen, came for treatment of two tumors including one on his nose the size of a walnut. For each session, Harry was permitted to cut bandag es and tie elaborate strings reaching around the man's nose and behind his ears. After six months, Frommie reputedly recove red. Placing his hand on the child's head, he exclaimed, \"Doc, it was Harry and his halters got me well!\" As Harry recalled, \"Right there and then I resolved that when I grew up I would cure people like my dad did.\" He said it was presumed from then on that he would go to medical scho ol.·1 Harry spent all his spare time helping out in his father's office. As the cancer practice grew, John C. gave over his veter inary business to an as­ sistant in order to devote himself to it full time. The move entailed finan­ cial sacrifice in an impoverished communit y that seldom had more than a sheep or goat for payment. Ye t he never turned people away for lack of funds, instructing Harr y, \"Son, cancer don't pick and choose. It hits rich and poor, black and white, Catholic, Protestant and Jew. All of them have a right to be treated, whether they can pay for it or not. Healing the sick and saving lives isn't a business; it's a duty and a privilege.\"4 Then tragedy befell the family. John C. tripped over a loose board, break­ ing his nose. Complications set in, his health declined precipi tously, and the fa mily had to sell the farm. At the age of fifteen, Harry quit school and went to work in the coal mines to support the family. Because of his expertise in handling animals, he soon graduated to muleskinner, driving ornery teams two and a half miles into the dark pits. During summers, he drove a taxi, shuttling miners to brothels and saloons . He built silos and chauffeured sales­ men around the county in a horse and bugg y.

The tal l, ro­ bust farm boy played semipr ofessional baseball for three teams under different names. He boxed and wrest led for cash, and sported a scar from a bout with a seven-f oot Indian who flipped him out of the ring. He worked as a human fly carrying Coca-Cola signs up seven-st ory buildings. He picked up a bullet during a wave of blood y labor strikes in a region locked in violent class war between labor and capital, rocked from half a world away by Bolsheviks seizing power to establish a worke rs' state. By 1919 John C. Hoxsey was bedridden. Acco rding to Harr y, the di­ agnosis was erysipelas, an acute bacterial infection of the skin that re­ sembles cancer . Before antibiotics, such conditions were often fatal. De­ teriorating rapidl y, the invalid father directed the boy to go to the People' s Bank to retrieve his safe deposit box and then stop at the drugstore to buy three Big Chief writing tablet s. John C. propped himself up in bed and riffled through the met al box, withdrawing a small white envelope. \"These are the cancer formulas I got from my father and he got from his. Now it's my turn to pass them on. When you were just a little shaver, asking questions about my work and watching me treat patients, I knew you had the call to be a doctor. That' s why I picked you to inherit the family formulas.\"5 John C. gravely removed the content s of the envelope and handed Harry the first of the Big Chief tablets, illustrated on the fire-red cover with an Indian chief in full headd ress. Slowly he read aloud the formula for the internal tonic. Harry copied it down word for word . The father instructed him to go in the dining room and write the formula on each of the 250 blank pages. Around midnig ht, young Harry fell asleep at the table half done. Roused by his mother in the dawn light, he refused break­ fast and wrote all morning to finish. The lad brought the tablet to his father, who asked stern ly, \"Do you have it by heart? \" Harry recited the formula flawless ly, and his father tore the original and copies into little pieces, put th em in a wastebask et, and motioned him to incinerate them in the woods tove. John C. then dic­ tated the formula for the external red salve, and Harry went to work in­ scribing the second Big Chief tablet. He finished the next nig ht, and brought the work back. Again he parroted the formula and burned the papers. His writing hand aching and stiff, he took down the last recipe for the yellow powder.6 When Harry completed the task the next day, he return ed to find his father enfeebled and dying. Ta king the boy' s hand, the patriarch solemnly passed on the family legacy. \"Now you have the power to heal the sick and save lives. What I've managed to do in a tiny part of this state, you"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"can do all over the coun try, all over the world.

Now you'll have to go it alone . Yo u've got a long hard battle ahead, and you're going to make yourself a lot of enemies.

Don' t under rate them, they're powerful , they're the High Priests of Medicin e. But in the end, you'll win. Because there's one thing they can't do, and that's put back the cancers you removed.\"8 With the transmission of the family legacy complete, John C. Hoxsey shut his eyes and sank into the bed. Several days later he was dead. Ac­ cording to Hoxs ey, a local doctor came and signed the death certificate, citing the cause as erysipelas. Charged with a daunting deathbed patrimon y, Harry Hoxsey dedi­ cated himself to curing cancer. To accomplish the mission, he recognized he had to become a doctor. With no mone y and a widowed mother and sick sister to support, he focused on making a living at his medle y of jobs. He returned home late every night to study for a high school diploma, which he gained by correspondence course. He deposit ed his earning s each week in a cigar box marked COLLEGE. Te llingly, he also took a mail­ order course in forensic medicine, the legal aspects of medical practice. He was apparent ly girding himself for the rules of the road as an uncon­ ventional healer . Locals in the communit y knew that Hoxsey had a suppl y of the medi­ cines locked in the cabinet, and over the next two years several came pleading for treatment. He rebuff ed them for fear of jeopardizing his medical school plans. After the death of his mother and sister , he moved to nearby Taylorv ille to save on expenses by living with another sister. To iling in the mines wit h his premium mule Short y, he was now stashing over half of each paycheck in his cigar-box colleg e fund. But Hoxsey soon saw his plans subvert ed.

Yo u have the power to save mine, if you treat me now. If you don't, I'll surely die, and you'll be guilty of murder .\"'' To rn by the life-and-deat h decision, Hoxsey reluctantly relented, agree­ ing to treat Larkin only if he swore to secrec y. Larkin consent ed, but when he returned fo r his next session, he brought a friend, E. C. McVicker, a director of the Farmer' s Bank who had a black sore on his temple diag­ nosed as cancer. Hoxsey protested angri ly, but Me Vicker promised he would give him a big check for colleg e if Hoxsey cured him. \"Mig ht as well treat two as one,\" the banker quipped, and Hoxsey sudde nly acquired a second patient and the financial means to a higher education .10 Hoxsey founds his first clinic in 1924. When the two men re­ turned for their next treatment, they brought along yet another cancer sufferer. Mter a heated argument, Hoxsey realized that-ready or not-he was in business. His patient s became his patrons, and he quit his job in the mines and began dis­ creetly treating cancer . Over the next two years, he claimed numerous cures. McVicker and Larkin appeared for years af­ terward as convi ncing Hoxse y testimonials at rallies and reviv­ als. 11 (There are no medical records of these cases, and in that era, diagnosis was dicey.

Seeking guidance, he consulted Dr. Maxamillian Meinhardt, a physician with a Chicag o sanit orium. Dr. Meinhardt proved to be far more interested in Hoxsey' s cancer remedies than in his prospe ctive educat ion. \"You don't need to go to medical school if you have a cure for cancer ,\" Meinhardt lobbied him. \"If this thing will work, your troubles are over. \" He invited the credulous young man to treat some test cases at his Chicago facility. 1 2 There Hoxsey met Dr. Bruce Miller , who would figure prominently in his future. The physician came down to Ta ylorvi lle to check out some of Hoxsey' s alleged successes . Impressed with the cases, Dr. Miller ex­ plained to Hoxsey that the medical profession was largely helple ss against cancer using surge ry, radium, and X-ray once the disease had spread. But, he warned, organized medicine would nevertheless oppose him as an out­ sider to the medical fraternity. When Hoxsey explained that he was going to become a doctor and bring the remedies in through the profession, Dr. Miller broke the news that various doctors were already complaining to the State Medical Board against the outlaw healer . Hoxsey was bl ack­ balled and stood no chance of admission to medical school. Hoxsey listened numbl y as Dr. Miller went on to propose that they go into business to­ gether . They could use the fifty­ seven-year -old physician' s medi­ cal license to comply with legal requirement s, with Hoxsey le­ gitimately serving as a medical technician. This structure became his modus operandi for the rest of his career. His course in forensic medicine may well have prepared him for this eventuality . Hoxsey and Dr. Miller formed a legal partnership predi­ cated on the condition that Hoxsey not be required to di­ vulge his secret formu las. On March 1, 1924, they opened the first Hoxsey clinic in Ta ylorville. \"I tried it out after long and care­ ful investigat ion,\" Dr. Miller was ==================-:::::::::::-- URES ARE CREDITED I TO NEW CANCER TREATMENT f �ly n�� \\'ntf!'rlna n· was Hoxte, be«:B.n to taraUon on l men and �r I'Uffer�rel\\. •Ia hJ t.ho story buk ot rl\" Dr. Dn1c:e .\\ 1tl l<:>r. tctor or l1lo mtmttrt Ututto. bu brOu�ht lo1 o m.edtcal •u. thorltt� •- l u.r he nhtn.ln�,, lh f.ral yoaf\"M o..-o fr�n a Trtylor\\·Jll,. coal min• the fat1Jer had pauf>: • cS� oo r c��n�t: ��':,h I IJ'flUon Is bt>fn« ua�d lcs at West End ltots· dir ection ot prom llleot � JD of the tr\"(\" a.tmenl tn brought d..,� -n on thu .

The physician would continue work ing wit h Hoxse y or his treatment for decades to come. The clinic was soon deluged with patient s, and within two mont hs the partners had to find big ger quarters. Hoxsey had his eye on a spacious building on Main Street owned by the Loyal Order of the Moose, and held a meet ing wit h the Lodge board where he presented a dozen cured cases including McVicker and Larkin, as well as a secret ary of the Lodge. The sensational testimonials did the trick. His dramatic cures were al­ ready emerging as his stock -in-trade. Though never one to think small, Hoxsey could hardly have imag­ ined the synchronous connections awaiting him at the Loyal Order of the Moose. Lucius 0. Everhard, a Chicago insurance broker and Moose Lodge member , atten ded the fateful gathering. \"This is the biggest thing on earth,\" Everhard reportedly told Hoxsey , boasting that he had recent ly written a large insurance polic y for Dr. Malcolm L. Harris, chief surgeon of the Alexian Brothers Hospital in Chicago and secretar y of the Ameri­ can Medical Associat ion. Everhard proposed contacting Dr. Harris to arrang e a demonstrat ion.14 Hoxsey was elated when Dr. Harris agreed. Hoxs ey, Dr. Miller , and Everhard drove the two hundred miles to Chicago the very same night, landing at the swanky Sherman Hotel. The following morning at 8:30, they waited eagerly outside the hospital until a chauffeured car delivered the distinguished Dr. Harr is. The small, dapper physician stood in awk­ ward contrast to Hoxsey in his ill-fit ting Sunda y best, and uncomfortably shook the ex-miner' s rough, pawlike hand. Dr. Harris led the trio to the funereal hospital room of Thomas Mannix, a sixty-six-year-old former police desk sergeant. A terminal can­ cer patient, the ghostly Mannix had a severe epithelioma, a grotesque mass of diseased flesh festering four inches across his shoul der.

Four weeks later, the cancer hardened and turned black, and started separating from the healt hy tissue. His general health improved as well. Hoxsey told Dr. Harris that within a few days it would be possible to remo ve the dried, hardened tumor entire ly. Dr. Harris suggested that the procedure take place in the hospital amphit heater in front of the entire staff. 1 7 The amphitheater swelled with ten doctors and another fifty interns and students. Hoxsey said Dr. Harris introduced him to several physi­ cians, among them Dr. Morris Fishbein , editor of the influential Journal of the American Medical Associa tion (JAMA). Dr. Miller and Hoxsey suc­ cessfull y remo ved the necrosed tumor, slipping off the stony mass cleanl y with a knife. Hoxsey said the electric crowd descended around them and fired agitated questions for hours. Here the account s diverge radical ly. Acco rding to Hoxs ey, the next morning he was invited for a meet ing with Dr. Harris, who effusively dubbed the treatment \"the eighth wonder of the world.\" The AMA offi­ cial then made him an offer. \"Do you remember Dr. Fishbein? He is the biggest man in medicine . He is the man that dictates the policy of medi­ cine in this countr y. With this treatment, or this put in the proper hands, we will take it over and it will be the greatest boon to humanit y on earth. Now, I drew up a contract for you to sign.\" 1H The alleged contract proposed an extens ive five-year testing period and stipulated that Hoxse y turn over his formulas with a large supply of the medicines. It further specified that Hoxse y would have no further involve ment with the treatment and must immediat ely cease his own op­ eratio ns. The formulas were to become the propert y of a consortium of doctors including Dr. Harris and Dr. Fishbein, with Hoxsey allotted 10 percent of profit s after ten years, if the treatment panned out. Ta ken aback, Hoxsey suggested that he would have to show the docu­ ment to his lawyer to review possible changes. \"I promised my father,\" Hoxsey recalled objecting, \"I would never give these formulas to any­ body without an agreement they would carry his name, and they would agree to treat poor people, whether they had mone y or not.\" 1 9 Dr. Harris sidestepped the query and pressured him that no reput able doctor would have anyth ing to do with him unless he signed the document. Hoxsey stood his ground, prompt ing Dr. Harris to reach for the phone to call the hospital to deny Hoxsey access to Mannix until he inked the agreement. \"I waited until he hung up the receiver, \" Hoxsey related, \"and called the Mannix home.

Hoxsey' s charges became shrouded in inscru­ table myste ry. Did AMA doctors try to suppress a cancer cure they couldn't contr ol? After extensive research, I was able to verify the medical case but not the allegations . Dr. Harris did later admit in a court deposition that Hoxsey held a demonstrat ion in the hospit al. In the AMA archives, I found grisly before-and-af ter pictures of Mannix, whose corrosi ve cancer vis­ ibly vanished following Hoxsey' s treatment. He later lost his collar bone after an accident shoveling coal, though the AMA contended that it was the destructive result of Hoxsey' s powder . As Mannix testified on behalf ofHoxsey in a later court trial, \"If anybody got closer to hell than I did, I would like to see them. Bruce Miller today is the best friend that I have got. He saved my life.\" Mannix died in 1934 of heart disease and high blood pressure, twelve years after receiving the Hoxsey treatment. The AMA did finally acknowledge Mannix' s recovery but maintained that he had act ually been cured by the prior surgery and radiat ionY Dr. Harris and Dr. Fishbein subse quent ly contended that they had instant ly flagged Hoxsey as a quack, and they flat ly denied offering him a contract for his formulas. Ye t one thing was certain: Hoxsey had made a very powerful enem y. By crossing swords with Dr. Morris Fishb ein, he alienated the most powerful figure in medicine. Dr. Fishbein held a unique posit ion. As Joumal editor, he contr olled the main income-pr oducing organ of the AMA , and thus the organization. The Joumal also set the accepted standards of medical pract ice, and without its blessing the medical gates were soundly shut. For the next twenty-five years , Hoxse y would battle Dr. Fishbein and the AMA for an investigation in a spectacle of national dimensions. In 1924, however, the AMA had but recently gained the centralized power that Hoxsey suddenly found opposing him.

To do so, he started touting a political plan to restructure the AMA and endow it with authorit y to set national medical policy. With two compat riots, he quiet ly commenced revamping the AMA into a rigid hierarchy of coun ty, state, and national medical societies, with power re­ siding exclusively in him at the apex of the pyramid.

Within twenty years, the vast major ity of doctors were members, and it became profes­ sional suicide not to belong to the AMA . This process marked a cruci al turning point in what Pulitzer Prize­ winning medical sociologist Paul Starr has characterized as the unique \"rise of a sovereign profession\" within the \"social transf ormation of Ameri­ can medicine .\" As Starr notes, the profession was soon able to convert its authority into \"social privilege, economic power, and political influence .\"25 Dr. Simmons also launched a crusade against \"irregulars\" and \"quacks,\" which encompassed all schools of medicine other than allopathic M.D.' s. He vigorously targeted homeopaths, herbalists, osteopat hs, chiroprac­ tors, and the diverse array of \"irregular\" practitioners who populated medicine at the time. Some were coopted through admission to the AMA , and the many who were excluded found themsel ves increasing ly restricted from most medical practi ce. Simmons set up the Department of Propaganda for Reform, later to be­ come the Bureau of Investigation, to catalog all irregular practitioners. The thrust of the bureau was \"the collection and dissemination of information on 'patent medicines ,' quacks, medical fads, and various other phases of pseudo­ medicin e.\"26 Heading the Propaganda Department was Dr. Arthur J.

The organization also consolidated its dominion over the regular medical profession . By 1922, resistance to Simmons' s controversial actions was fer­ menting across the land even within the orthodox community . The Illinois Medical Societ y in the Illinois Medical Journal openly attacked the AMA . Few of the member s of the AMA realize the centraliz­ ing changes that have taken place in their organization within the last twenty-five years. So adroi tly and insidi­ ously have these changes been brought about that the majority of the member s, dazzled by the material pros­ perity of the AMA , have entirely overlooked the fact that the Associ ation has been converted from a democrat ic and self-gove rned body of professional men into a highly centralized machine with absolute control concent rated in a single individua l.

The newspaper followed with reports that Dr. Keeney consi dered the Hoxsey remedies a specific for cancer , and dis­ closed that he got the approval of the Calif ornia State Medical Board to use it. Not long after, Dr. Keen ey, who indeed came and investigated the treatment, stated, \"I found enough of interest to detain me there for five days.\".! However, he was \"prevented from making a speech on Hoxi de by the local doctors, under the threat they would break him in Calif ornia for unethical practices .\"4 Caving to added professional pressure from the Journal's negative portrayal of him, he quick ly dropped the whole affair. Undeterred, the chamber of commerce continued \"circularizing\" doctors nationally with pamphlets encouraging them to come see for themselves .5 Shortly an agent of the AMA Bureau of Investigation showed up in Taylorville. He queried locals about Hoxsey, his family, and his supposed cures, and was spotted around town poking into any dark corners he could find. He never met with Hoxs ey, although Hoxsey said he sought a meeting. Several months went by quiet ly before lightning struck. On Januar y 2, 1926, the Journal published its first tirade under the banner of Propa­ ganda for Reform: \"The Hoxide Cancer 'Cure': A Chamber of Com­ merce Sponsors the Nostrum of a Horse Doctor .\"6 The AMA editor ial branded Hoxsey' s \"cancer cure\" a \"secret remedy ,\" the surest sig n of a quack. By doing so, Dr. Fishbein issued the medical kiss of death. No reputable doctor or researcher could now have any association with it. Of course, if Hoxsey' s charge that the AMA tried to buy his formulas was true, he had every reason to keep their composition bet ween him and the fence post. The coveted recipes became what film director Alfred Hitchcock liked to call the \"MacGuf fin,\" the object of desir e that drives the plot.

It further charged that he had actually died of canm·. The article went on to discredit Lucius 0.

The editorial quashed \"rumors\" that the treatment was being used in \"high-grade hospitals and by physicians of unquestionable standing.'' The Journal asked rhetorical ly, \"What is the Hoxi de cure? Essent ially the eschar otic treatment with arsenic as its base. Specimen s of the stuff used when the Hoxsey outfit was in Chicago were examined in the Associat ion's laborat ory and arsenic in large quantit ies was fo und.

One of the leading physi­ cians of Ta ylorville wrote to the Joumal that the first information he heard 'was from an under taker who showed enthusiasm about the matter.\"' The editorial conceded that people with \"nonmalig nant or superficial growth s\" would have them remo ved, but with unnecessar y pain and ex­ pense. It castigated the chamber of comm erce for holding out this \"false beacon\" and predicted trage dy. Hoxsey replied furiously with a letter to Dr. Fishbein in what would become a lengthy one-sided correspo ndence. His father had indeed been charged with blackmail but was exonera ted. He had not died of cancer, but of erysipelas, and his death certificate was on file in the state capital. Hoxsey further denied that his yellow powd er contained toxic arsenic and chal­ lenged Dr. Fishbein to verify even one case wher e anyone bled to death. He demanded the public release of Sergeant Mannix' s medical records . a Dr. Fishbein did not have to reply. Hoxsey was now officiall y stigma­ tized as a cancer pariah in the medical communit y, and he was vulnerable indeed. His relationship with the shifty Everhard was merely the first of many such shadowy associations that would undermine his credibilit y. 1\\s Hoxsey' s daughter told me, \"Dad could be a real sucker if you knew how to strok e him.

If they won his favor, in his eyes, they could do no wrong.\" At the time, it appear s th at Hoxsey was treating mainl y external can­ cers with his escha rotic yellow powder . Considerable confusion exists around this pivotal issue . According to several references I found, it ap­ pears that Hoxsey mainly relied on the yellow powder and principally promoted his treatment of external cases, although he also used it on some internal cancer s throug h injection . Explicit references to external treatment s mention only the yellow powder , not the red paste. I did find two specific mentions of his use of an internal treatment between 1924 and 1930. If he was using the internal tonic in the early days, it was not his focus and certainl y was not what he was promoting. By 19 30, he defi­ nitely had an internal reme dy. 9 (The central mystery of just what these remedies are and where they may have come from is explored in depth in chapter 11.) Nevert heless, his greatest and most spec tacular successes clearly came from removi ng external cancers where the result was visi bly unde niable. Dr. Fishbein offered no proof that the yellow powder was causing toxic reactions, but his attacks signaled the onset of a protracted medical con­ troversy that would climax in a surprise ending. With Dr. Fishbein's rebuke, the Chicag o heat was on in the city noto­ rious during Prohibit ion for its violence and gangsters such as AI Capo ne. Hoxse y launched a $250,000 suit against the AMA and tried to enlist the illustrious Chicag o lawyer Clarence Darrow. \"I have been consulted in the case,\" Darrow said, \"but not unde rtaken it. This instit ution is en­ gaged in curing cancers. I have seen and heard of so many cures that did not make good that I mean to be sure before I unde rtake it. Four doctors in regular standing have given me their exper ience and have the fullest faith in it. I have seen about ten cases that appear to be cured.\" Darrow ultimatel y refused the case, and Hoxsey would later say Darrow was \"reached\" by the AMA. 10 When the AMA later forced the suit to trial, a financiall y strapped Hoxsey dropped it.11 Hoxsey soon found the AMA subverting his relationship with an un­ nerved Taylorville Chamber of Commerce, which terminated its support. It marked the beginning of a state of siege. Return ing from a movie one night in a nearby town , Hoxsey heard newsboys hawki ng the sensational headline, \"Downstate Cancer Mill Raided.\" He read with amazement that he had been arrest ed, only to find the clinic intact when he got back to Ta ylorville. An investigator from the State Medical Board prompt ly arrived in town and charged Hoxsey with practicing medicine without a license."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Quacking Around 57 The bust set a pattern in which Hoxsey would go on to be arrested al­ most continually for the rest of his career . In fact, by work ing as a medi­ cal techn ician under the aegis of a licensed doctor, Hoxsey was fully within the law. His forensic correct ness, however, did nothing to halt the bliz­ zard of warrants burying his pract ice. With the typical synchronicity of cancer politics, the local deputy sheriff refused to serve the warrant because Hoxsey was treating him for cancer. When the case finall y went to tr ial, Hoxsey was acquit ted. Delivering the verdict was a jury composed of two former patients and ten others who had relatives or friends who believed they had been helped by it. These kinds of intimate connections sown by cancer would reach across seren­ dipitous social pathways to exonerate Hoxsey on many occasions .12 Seven more warrants never even reached trial, but Hoxsey soon found himself facing a puzzling half-million-dollar trover suit from eight of his brothers and sisters for illegally appropriating his father's estate : the can­ cer formulas. The suit cited the formulas that John C. Hoxsey had used \"with a great degree of success \" and valued them at $500,000Y Digging deeper , Hoxsey learned that his relatives had been approached by Chi­ cago lawyers allegedly representing a group of Chicago doctors offering to buy out the relatives' share of the estate when they won the suit. When he grilled one brother on his motivation , Hoxsey was told that \"I had stolen those formulas out of dad's bank box, and was making a lot of money. I was going to make a million dollars with it, because the lawyers told him so, and he wanted his part of it.\"14 Faced with having to post a prepost erous $500,000 bond, Hoxsey watch ed his clinic and all his personal assets stripped. When the clinic physician, Dr. Washbur n, took his license off the wall and quit, he was stran ded again . Patients under treatment pleaded with Hoxsey to continue helping them. Aware that he was under surveillance and no longer shielded by a doctor' s license, he faced an existential dilemma . \"What was I to do?\" he wondered. \"Let these poor unfortunates die?\" During the next eighteen months, he moved his clinic to the neighboring towns of Carlinville and Jacksonville and kept treating patient s. Arrested repeatedly for practicing medicine with­ out a license, he pleaded guilty to three counts and paid $100 fines for the misdemeanors. \"Those cases hung fire for a long time,\" he later defended himself in court. \"It was the cheapest and quickest way out. \" 15 When the trover suit finally reached trial in the summer of 1929, it was decided in Hoxsey' s favor.

I will say that if the American Medical Associat ion will sign a con­ tract to treat every cancer sufferer in the world, let him be rich or poor, fo r nothing, I will immedi ately give my remedy free of charge to the world .\"19 Hoxsey flaunted his open invitation to Dr. Fishbein, who, of course, failed to show up. \"If the American Medical Association had one bit of guts,\" he taunted his remote enemies, \"they would be here, but no, they are thieves in the dark. Friends, why would a bunch of jealous, narrow­ minded penn y-lovers resort to the dirty tactics that my enemies have re­ sorted to?

There were no takers . Hoxsey was certainly not mending any fences at AMA headqu arters. Dr. Fishbein' s Journal struck back immedi ately in an editorial titled \"The Hoxide Quacker y Again\" deriding the Girard Chamber of Commer ce and its citize ns. \"They will get the doub tful privilege of the reputation of living in a town that fattens off the sufferings of those unfortunates who are lured there by the fa lse hope that an ignorant faker has discov­ ered a 'cure' for one of the most dreadf ul scourges afflicting the human race.\"21 The AMA jab crum bled the resolve of the Girard backers, and under mounting pressure Hoxse y was relieved when he got an auspicious long­ distance phone call in Februa ry 1930 from Norman Baker. Baker identi­ tled himself as operating a cancer clinic using unorthodox methods in Muscat ine, Iowa .

Baker wanted a demonstration of the treatment and offered him a job if it showed results . Hoxsey drove up the next day to the Baker Hospital on the banks of the Mississippi River . Billed as \"The Castle in the Air Where Sick Folks Get We ll,\" the fa­ cility was part of Baker's home- grown empire comprising Radio K-T-N-T (\"Know The Naked Truth\") and the KTNT magaz ine, catalog, gas station, and restaur ant.22 Baker, a former stage hypnotist, was previously married to Eva Ta nguay , the \"I Don't Care Girl,\" with whom he performed a mentalist act in which she used her telepathic powers to read the number s from playing cards. Baker sported white suits and shoes matched with purple shirts and ties, and was famous for his silver tongue and mesmerist eyes. An inventor, he desig ned and built the calliaphone, an organlik e musical instrument used on top of cars for advert ising, which he manufactured and sold nationall y. Hoxsey arrived to find Baker on the air. \"The subject of his talk was curing both internal and external can­ cer at the Baker Institute ,\" Hoxsey later testified. \"During his talk he gave a staunch plea for funds for the Peoples Protective Association which he said would only be used for the purpose of giving the people medical freedom and taking the facts to Wash­ ington where he was going to go before the President and show that The Baker Hospital: \"A cancer cure with cheap cigars and a cheap magazine as sidelines. \""},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Quacking Around 61 cancer was curable and they were curing it in Muscat ine. He asked the people to send in donat ions and made it very plain to the people that the officer s of the Association would receive no salaries .\"23 After the broadcast, Hoxsey got a tour of the hospital and met Dr. Statler, Baker' s only licensed physician. Baker offered Hoxsey a lucrative salary, but Hoxsey countered that his only deal would be for part of the profits. Baker declaimed that he wasn' t interested in making money, only in \"busting the Medical Tr ust.\" Hoxsey replied, \"I told him I was inter­ ested in both mone y and saving lives, but I didn' t want one dollar of a poor dying victim's mone y if we didn' t posit ively think he could be cured .\" Hoxsey insisted on treating poor people for free and noted shrewdly that his charit y cases were often his best advertisements, a good deed that was also good business. During heavy negotiations, Baker finall y agreed to give Hoxsey a percentage interest for the cases he treated.24 Since Baker was already using an internal \"needle\" treatment devel­ oped by a Dr. Ozias, he put Hoxsey in charge of a new external cancer division. Hoxsey started treatment on several patients, frustrated that he was limited to external cases. That night Baker summoned Hoxsey to the radio station in the home y upstairs room outfitted with sofas where he was playing his tradem ark organ while dedic ating doleful tunes to his gray-haired mother . When Baker gave over the microphone to Hoxs ey, it was love at first sight. Hoxsey held forth, spending an hour at a time several times a day promoting his cures. As Hoxsey commented to Dr. Miller , \"My God, it looks like an opport unity of a lifetime. That man has a radio station, and Fishbein can't stop a radio station from talking, regardless of how many dirty ar­ ticles he runs. He can't get to all the people we talk to. We will have patients come to the radio and do their talking.\"25 At the nadir of the Great Depression, he mixed his evangelical oratory of miraculous cures with a drumbeat of populist politics berating the Medical Trust and M.D.' s-\"'M.D.' stands for 'More Doug h.'\" Within a week the Baker Hospital was overrun with three hundred patients a day spilling over from the Baker hotel into boardinghouses and rented rooms in private homes. Soon came Hoxsey' s most sensational and bizarre case. When cancer sufferer Mandus Johnson heard Baker on the radio, he set out for Muscatine in March 1930. His head was ban­ daged as heavily as a mum my, spooking pedestrians to flee to the other side of the street. Hoxsey called it the worst case of cancer he ever saw. When the retired fa rmer entered the treatment room, the stench was so overwhelming that Hoxsey insist ed, \"W e got to get this man out in the wind or leave.\" The entire top of]o hnson' s head was rotting flesh. The"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"62 THE WILDEST STORY IN MEDIC AL HISTORY cancer had eaten away the scalp, exposing his skull. Doctors had inser ted tubes into holes cut in his skull to drain the pint of pus generated every day. \"Either cure me or kill me,\" the desperate Johnson pleaded .U• As Johnson later told his tale, \"I had to dress it out about six or three times a day and I couldn' t see anything with this eye here. It smelled [like] flesh. I took them rags and put them in the furnace and I go away two blocks and smell the odors then.\"27 The fa rmer had banged his head bringing down a pump handle and it never healed, turning malig nant. The doctors operated and gave him eleven X-ray treatment s over a three­ year period, but it got worse. Then he heard Baker on the radio. When Baker enter ed the room and saw the horrible sight, Hoxsey told him, \"This man here has got one chance in ten thou sand, and that's one chance too many. But ifl can get at treating him, I think we'll do a lot of good . If we don't, it will blow you out of the water .\" Baker decided to take the gamble.2 H Hoxsey applied the yellow powd er under Dr. Statler' s super vision, and sent Johnson home. The patient returned ten days later much im­ proved. After going home again, he sent letters through his wife saying that the odor was gone and he could sleep. Baker direct ly went on the radio and theatrically announced a public demonstration outside the ra­ dio station in which the top of)ohnson 's skull would be remo ved, and the cancer with it. Around a covered gazebo on a high hill overlook ing the Mississippi River crowded a \"human landsl ide\" of 32,000 people, twice the popula­ tion of Musca tine.

The next day, local doct ors reported that Mandus Johnson had died horribly at the hands of the \"murder ers\" Hoxsey and Baker. The Journal attacked immediat ely in a polemic titled \"Broadcasting Bunk. \" It charged that one of Baker's supposed cancer cures was a man suffering from noth­ ing more than \"barber' s itch.\" The editorial reveled in Hoxsey' s associa­ tion with the notorious Baker as Dr. Fishbein wrote that Baker was sell­ ing \"a cancer cure with cigars and a cheap magazine as side lines. His cancer cure includes the old Hoxsey fake.\"29 By now, JAMA had also unearthed more juicy details on Hoxsey' s close associat e Dr. Bruce Miller . The physician indeed held a valid medi­ cal license, but had not practiced in almost thirty years. During that time he joined his father's woodwo rking business to help him protect valuable patents, and spent about ten years in Europe where he ex hibited a me­ chanical orchest ra of lady dummies he had const ructe d. Dr. Miller fully ackno wledged the truth of his eccen tric past. 30 He got interested in medicine again only after his sister died of cancer . When he began looking for potentially effective treatment s, he linked with Hoxs ey. It is unclear whether Hoxsey knew about his partner's professional his­ tory, although undoubtedly his main concern was the validity of the physician' s license. Dr. Miller did, however, dedicat e the next twenty years of his life to working with the Hoxsey treatn1ent. He was convinced of its merit, mainly for external cancers , and started a practice in Los Angeles . By the 1940s, he became a prominent figure as president of the National Medical Asso­ ciation, an alternat ive to the AMA composed of irregular physicians. Nevert heless, this time Dr. Fishbein had a live one. Baker and Miller made glorious addit ions to the AMA's wax museum of quackery, and in­ deed medical charlatanism was rampant. During the same period, the Journal was purs uing the infamous Dr. John Brink ley, who was perform­ ing his notorious \"goat-g land\" transplant s in Kansas with promises of restoring virility to a clamoring male client ele. The macabre operation was outright fraud and produced gruesome casualt ies. The outrageous Brinkley, whose widespread popular ity spurred him to run for state of­ fice, made a big target for Dr. Fishbein. There was often good cause for the AMA's actions to limit such medical abuses, and it was high tide for quacker y at AMA headquarte rs.

Hoxsey was boldly stretching the bounds of the battleground and must have known he would invite severe retribution from his enem y. The same day that \"Broadcast ing Bunk\" appeared, Hoxsey and Baker went on the air at midnig ht. At Dr. Fishbein's behest, the FCC had by now intervened to limit their hours to non-prime-t ime: afternoons and the wee hours . After Baker finished deriding \"M.D.'s -More Drugs\" and \"the AMA - the American Meat cutters Associat ion,\" he signed off emotionally for the night as the \"friend of the farmer, the laborer , and the country folks\" to wisps of plaint ive organ tones. When Hoxsey heard a dog barking outside the wind ow, he moved cautiousl y to peer from the side of the curtains. There had recen tly been anonymous threats on their lives, and Baker had posted a permanent watch man, who that night re­ ported a tip-off about a suspicio us Buick parked in front of the KTNT restaurant. Hoxsey and Baker were armed, and Hoxsey had his hand on his revolver as he inched his nose to the edge of the fluttering curtains. Hoxsey spotted a man with a drawn gun and they fired at the same in­ stant. Hoxsey wounded the assailant, but two figures dragged the man away and escaped across the bridge over the Mississippi. Hoxsey raced outside in pursuit while Baker trailed a distant second, terrified and hanging back, ac­ cording to Hoxsey. While they were scouring the grounds, two bombs ex­ ploded nearby at the base of the radio tower in a rain of hot sparks. Hoxsey subsequently claimed that he was fully prepared , forewarned by a Chicago gangster whose mother he had cured .31 He was a good shot for a Quaker. The Chicago Daily Tribune ran the lurid headline, \"Hunt 3 Gunmen Routed by 'Quack' Doctor-Gun Fight Clim axes Fight with Dr. Fishbe in,\" while the Post followed with, \"Try to Shoot Up KTNT; At­ tack by Dr. Morris Fishbe in. \"32 Hoxsey implied that Dr. Fishbein was behind the attack, but he had no proof , and the accusation was probabl y spurious .33 The three gunmen were never caught, but there was no question that it was high noon in the cancer war. Baker set up machine gun nests around KTNT and sped the publica­ tion of a self-aggrandiz ing book called Doctors, D y namiter s and Gunmen portraying himself as a two-fist ed hero. Some weeks later, Hoxsey' s brother Dan was mysteriousl y found shot dead execut ion-style in the backseat of his car in Muscat ine. No one was ever charged with the murder , and given the temper of the times, there's no telling what else Dan might have been involved in, from bootlegging to gambling. Hoxsey never spoke further about it."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"66 THE WILD EST STORY IN MEDIC AL HISTORY To quell rumors of Mandus Johnson' s death, Hoxsey and Baker went on the radio to announce \"The Resurrection ofMandus Johnson\" to take place in We ed Park on Decoration Day, May 30. This time, 50,000 people turned out, including the governor of Iowa , who shared the platform. Mandus Johnson appeared, whole and healt hy. To explain the stupen­ dous recover y, the ]oU1'nal countered with an editorial claiming that Johnson actually had osteomy elitis, not cancer, which cleared up by it­ self.H Johnson lived on into the 1950s, free from cancer. He had plastic surger y to reconstruct his scalp, and one of the clinic nurses kept his necrosed skull bone as a memento, using it as a work basket. The Baker Hospit al was now attracting a hefty 365 patients a day, but its prosperity put Hoxsey increasing ly at odds with Baker. Hoxsey ob­ jected angrily to the use of the other internal treatment, which he be­ lieved was worthless, and he bet the nurses a squirrel coat if they could show him even one cure from it. As receipts climbed, Baker started cooking the books and reneged on their percentage contract, which he com plained would pay Hoxsey more than the president of the United States. He was stiffing nurses for the salary of dishwasher s, and procuring the cheapest ingredient s he could find. Finall y Hoxsey discovered the greedy Baker turning away impover ished patients, while coercing an elder ly wom an into selling her fa rm to pay fo r treatment. \"The first of September I was throug h,\" Hoxsey recalled. \"Norman told me to go straight to hell. He wouldn' t have me dictating to him. I said, 'Norman, it isn't that I am jealous, but I will be damned ifl will see a human slaughterho use.

Baker went on to run fo r Iowa governor on the Labor Party ticket and kept blasting the AMA from XENT radio in Mexico after the FCC revoked his radio license . Charging the \"Medical Trust\" with offering him a million dollar s for his cancer cure, Baker sued the AMA and lost. After setting up a failed clinic in Arkansas, he was con­ victed in 1941 of mail fraud for promoting fa lse cures for cancer and other diseases. He served four years in Leavenworth federal penitentiar y, and then retired to Florida on a palatial yacht once belong ing to robber baron Jay Gould .

If the Devil himself had offered me the facilities and doc tors to treat cancer legitimate ly, and thus save the lives of thousands of victims, I would have accept ed.\"36 As far as the AMA was concer ned, Baker was the devil, and Hoxsey' s dance with him cost him dea rly. Muscatine signaled the beginning of Hoxsey' s skillful use ofthe mass media to fight back against Dr. Fishb ein. Both men became masters of publicit y in their own right and would increasi ngly wage their highly public battle through the media. Hoxsey proved to be a charismatic pro­ moter at a time when advertising was forbidden to doctor s. \"I have fre­ quent ly been accused,\" he later wrote, \"of being a flamboya nt showman and promot er, as well as a healer . If I am all of these things , it is because the AMA forced these roles on me. The relent less campaig n of innuendo and outright slander against me has been largely a subterranean one. The plain truth is, I had to become both showman and promoter in order to continue to treat cancer by unorthodox means and survive .\"37 Undaunted by his latest blowout, Hoxsey kept up his incessant bar­ rage of letters to the Vo ice of American Medicine, pleading for a test of his remedies . His entreaties got no response, and he found himself irre­ vocably exiled to the under world. An investigation was nowh ere in sight. Following his acrimonious split wit h the crooked Baker, Hoxse y set up quart ers a block away and continued treating patient s until he was soon offered an enticing new opport unity by wealt hy citizens of Detroit: Ernest Maross, a financier of Henr y Ford and founder of the Indianapo­ lis Speedway, and his wife, Maude Slocum, an opera star. The Marosses proposed to set up a free clinic in the Motor City. If Hoxsey could dem­ onstrate results, they pledg ed to sponsor and fund a free clinic:1 H Hoxsey moved to Detroit under the aegis of Dr. Homer Va n Hy ning, Maude' s personal phy sician. On the first day, the clinic hosted 118 pa­ tients. But the fix was already in. Tw o days later, accompanied by Maross, l loxsey was called into the prosecutor' s office. The prosecutor reported the dissatisf action of the Wayne Count y Medical Socie ty, but implied that some discreet payments might correct the situation. Hoxsey and his benef actor angrily walked out. Te n days later Hoxsey was arrested for practicing medic ine without a license.

Hoxsey was convicted of practicing medicine without a license, con­ trary to evidence that he served merely as a technician for the physician . Sentenced to six months in jail and a $200 fine, he was bailed out by Maross and immediat ely appealed the verdict. Seventeen mont hs later, the Michig an State Supreme Court overt urned his conviction and fully exonerated him on December 6, 1932.40 But with his license revoked in Michigan, Dr. Van Hyning retired to Ohio, and no other doctor was willing to risk professional censure . Even Maro ss's formidable political pull couldn' t remedy the situation. As Hoxsey later noted, \"There's only one thing that organized medic ine fears more than unorthodo xy, and that's free medical treatment.\"41 Between 1926 and 193 1, Hoxsey had been arrested 119 timesY He was convicted only three times on the misdemeanor s in Illinois, and once in Ohio, where he got a suspended sentence. He was also permanent ly enjoined from practicing in Iowa after the Baker fiasco. He spent the next five years \"quacking around,\" as Mildred Nelson termed it, con­ stantly boosted by high hopes that were perpet ually punctured by the barbed wire Dr. Fishbein set in his path. In May 193 2 Hoxsey settled in Wheeling, straddling both sides of the Ohio and West Virginia border . He began remodeling an office for a Hoxsey Cancer Clinic in the Hawley Building on the tenth floor next to Radio WWVA , where he bought a broadcasting contract. He invaded the newspapers with ads depicting a folk-art cartoon history of his life, which was smoot hly evolving into populist fa ble. His third wife, a \"sassy redhea d\" named Eva Ruth , opened the offices, while Hoxsey refurbished the furniture and walls, which he striped in black. Before the clinic could open, he was arrested on charges instituted by the Ohio State Medical Soci­ ety, which had already been in touch with Dr. Cramp at the AMA . The medical society threatened the radio station owner with complaints to the FCC, resulting in the cance llation of his broadcasting contractY Hoxsey placed bold ads in the local press, touting his famed testimo­ nials and claiming the treatment was now in use in ten states . He also issued a $10,000 challenge to treat twenty-five cases on an equal basis with the doctors and cure twice as many as his rivals.

Amid snowdrifts deep enough to swallow a man, Harry Hoxsey arrived in November 193 3 to spend a month treating two hundred laboratory mice with the Hoxsey remedies. The account s of what happened next conflict sharp ly. In Hoxsey' s ver­ sion, he claimed to treat the mice successful ly, whereupon Dr. Little went away for a meeting at the Rockef eller Instit ute in New Yo rk City. Soon after his return, he informed Hoxsey that he had been unaware ofHoxsey' s vendetta with the AMA , which precluded any further association. \"The only way I can help you,\" Hoxse y contended Dr. Little said to him, \"is for you to give me your formulas, and you step out of the picture. Or else go to Europe and let this come back as a disco very from Heid elberg, or some reputable place, and you stay over there four or five years and let this be exploited in this countr y.\"53 Hoxsey was uninterested in the proposit ion. \"I told him that the Alneri­ can flag was the only fa ther and mother I had, and I was not going to leave it to give something I had away. \"54 Hoxsey was convinced that Dr. Fishbein was the unseen ventri loquist speaking through Dr. Little to pur­ loin his MacG uffin. However, in later court deposit ions and interviews with the FDA, Dr. Little related an entirely different story. He at first acknowledged the possible initial success of the test mice he sent Hoxs ey, but later retracted the statement. 55 He also desc ribed other alarming problems that set in at Bar Harbor . \"Hoxsey had been doing a good deal of loose talking around town both as to his abilit y to cure cancer and other diseases, his work at the laborat ory and his personal situation as regards wealt h.\"56 Dr. Little recounted that Hoxse y had illegally treated two people. The first was a boy with a swollen foot, which Hoxsey cut with a razor, mak­ ing it worse and causing Dr. Little to call in a doctor. The second was the hoy's mother , treated for an unspecified ailment, whom Hoxse y told that he had somet hing better than her doctor. He did not charge money for"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Quacking Around 73 either treatment, and boasted that theref ore the authorities couldn' t con­ vict him for pract icing medicine without a license. 57 It was another lesson from the pages of forensic medicine. By refusing remunerat ion, he wasn' t legall y liable. According to Little, Hoxsey then gave a speech at the Mount Desert Lions Club. \"It is evident that he gave the impr ession he was a doctor ,\" Dr. Little related. \"He mentioned his connection with the laborat ory. This of course was a public breach of confidence of the terms of the agree­ ment.\" When the scientist heard about the violation, he severed his tie with Hoxs ey. Hoxsey remained in town \"talking more loosel y than ever.\" Among other charges, Little claimed Hoxsey said that he and Dr. Little had \"rival cancer cures ,\" hence Dr. Little's hostilit y to him. 58 \"My impression ,\" Little added, \"was that he was a skillful promoter , watching for every oppo rtunity to advance himself . He was presentable and ingratiating, and made a very good first impression. This, however, in the days and weeks that followed broke down at every real test to show that he was unreliable .\"59 Dr. Little maintained that the Bar Harbor experiment s showed noth­ ing of value and that the yellow powder was a \"corros ive agent\" that actu­ ally injured the mice. He published his uniformly negative finding s in the AMA Journal in 193 5.6 0 All records of the experiment s were allegedly consumed in a fire at the lab years lat er, atomizing any documentation to support either side's story.61 In later correspondence with Dr. Little, Herbert Brower of the En­ docrine Comp any regretted having made the ill-fated introduct ion. \"My general impression from watching some of the cases treated in Dr. Drew's sanitarium at the time in question was one of extreme interest. I'm cer­ tain, temporari ly at least, that there were some cases with retrogression of the so-called cancer ous growth and improvement in cond ition. The initial testing [of the mice] showed encouraging results. It was then we arranged for the Harvard Club meeting and subsequent arrang ements for further experimental work at your labor atory. From then on the pic­ tur e changed and I am still sorry for the inconveniences caused you.\"62 Hoxsey retur ned belat edly to Philadelphia to spend two more years with Dr. Drew. They parted ways in 1934 when Dr. Drew called it quits. \"Harry, I have been thinking this thing over, \" Dr. Drew wrote him. \"A man of my age, my standing, I figure getting into politics and runn ing for Congress in 1936. Ifi get in this thing, it may ruin me politicall y. It may ruin me every way. I don't think I can stand it. I had rather not start the tight here.

He said that Hoxsey is a monumental liar and that you can' t believe a thing he says. He won't listen to advice. Hoxsey is the type of man who simpl y will not play ball with anybo dy. He is so jealous of his external treatment with yellow pow­ der that he guards it with his life. Hoxsey is a braggart, a liar, a schemer , and a conni ver. \"64 The FDA report concluded with a paradoxical summation of Dr. Drew' s perspect ive on Hoxsey. \"In spite of Mr. Hoxsey' s shortcom ings, Dr. Drew claims he lik es him and is absolutely sold on his treatment for curing cancer . He said he has seen many of the cures. He said that Mr. Hoxsey was truth ful in one respect, and that was he told the patients exactly what were their chances of being cured, and that nine times out of ten he was right. [Dr. Drew was] frank to admit that never once did he catch Hoxsey in a lie pertaining to the success or failure of his treatment in a particular case.\"�•; Despit e repeated affirmat ions of at least some merit to his treatment, Hoxsey found himself barred from any official investigation and ban­ ished to a medical no-man' s-land. Without quest ion, his own inferiorit y complex and need to be a big shot, as Dr. Drew characterized his person­ ality, contri buted mightily to his standing as an untou chable. Ye t where Hoxsey was less than trustworthy in many ways, he did seem to draw the line where it came to the real issue : his cases. Perhaps Hoxsey' s abrasive demeanor and lat itude with the facts ter­ minall y estranged him from the only people who could satisfy the ques­ tion of the efficacy of his remedies.

The truth would never be fully known, but events were yet to unfold that would shed disturbing light on the mystery. Rootless and married for the fourth time, Hoxsey decamped from Philadelphia back to Illinois. \"But I was getting restless ,\" he later wrote. \"Time was moving along; I was nearly thirty-five years old, I'd been treat­ ing cancer for close to fifteen years and yet my ultimate goal-recog ni­ tion and acceptance by the medical profession-was as distant as ever.

(The Eclectic tradit ion is explored in part2.) Since coming to Te xas in 1899, he watch ed the small town of 41,000 swell to a burgeoning metropolis of 330,000 residents. 6 \"Don' t Give Up Hope,\" exhorted the clinic' s new brochure, amid graphic photographs of compelling Hoxsey external cures .7 1t explicitly character ­ ized cancer as a \"constitutional disease ,\" contrary to organized medicine' s view of cancer as a local phenomenon. Hoxsey' s first patient was Mrs. J. B. Whitehead, who subsequently wrote Dr. Spann a letter about her experi­ ence. \"Now that I am going back home, I have the mixed feeling of happi­ ness at returning to my family in good health and regret at leaving all those who have been so kind to me during the thirty-three days I have spent at Spann Sanit arium . I have felt more like a guest than a patient.\"H Mrs. Whitehead described the horror of her illness. \"I had suffered severe hemorrhag es of the uterus for about two years . In September 193 5, the dischar ge became filled with pus and caused me consi derable pain. Last December I consulted Dr. Joseph Elmer Kanatser of Wichita Falls, Te xas, who immedi ately diagnosed my condition as cancer and recom­ mended radium treatments. I was unwil ling to accept the judgment of one physician, so went to Dr. Percy Ki ng Smith. Dr. Smith confirmed the diagnosis and had me go to Dr. Everett Foster Jones, who also made an examinat ion. Dr. Jones, under the direction of Dr. Smith, gave me eighty-four hours of radium treatment in the Wichita Falls Clinic Hos­ pital. These treatme nts stopped the flow and gave me temporar y relief , but it was not long before I was worse than before.

Following Mrs. Whit ehead's appar ently successful outcome using Hoxsey' s internal tonic, her husband shared his enthusiasm for the treat­ ment with his fellow railroad workers and was soon fired. Hoxsey helped initiat e reinstatement proceeding s through the National Labor Relations Board. Railr oad officials contended that Whitehead was initiall y reduced to a lower salary, then let go \"on fur lough\" because of a reduction in the workf orce. In the interim, the train car repairman was broke, and Hoxsey bought some laundr y machines and set him up in business. Whitehead did finall y regain his job, but when he was killed in an accident sev eral years later, Hoxsey and his wif e took in their son and raised him to allevi­ ate the fa mily's financial burden .111 When Hoxsey' s contract with Dr. Spann ran out, he joined fo rces with Dr. Hartzog to set up the Bryan and Peak Cancer Clinic in a small building near downtow n.11 Hoxsey started placing newspaper ads and quickly attracted the ire of Dr. T. J. Crowe , head of the Dallas Count y Medical Soc iety. Dr. Crowe showed up at the clinic and began harangu­ ing Hoxs ey. He threa tened Dr. Hartzog with the loss of his license as well as jail and swore he would close the clinic. Hoxsey banished him from the premises. The next day Dr. Hartzog was ordered to appear bef ore the State Medical Board to show cause why his license shouldn' t be revoked . He refused, and several weeks later Dr. Hartzog, Hoxsey, and his wife Martha were arrested and thrown in the Dallas Count y jail. Hoxsey was enraged at the arrest of his wife, who was put in the tank with prost itutes and slapped around .11 What ensued was a Te xas tornado of arrests at Dr. Crowe's behest, but the state's \"complaining witnesses\" turned out to be sympat hetic pa­ tients who wouldn't cooperat e with the authorit ies, and who didn' t even reside in the proper jurisdict ion.

There was a conversation on the other end, and then Harry said, 'No, I'm not going to do that.' He sat and listened for a while longer and said, 'No, goddammit, you're not going to do that either.'

He was going to come and take the sign on the lawn down , and you heard what I told him.\"' James Wa kefield Burke met Hoxsey as a reporter sent to cover the cancer controve rsy. We found Burke during our research and filmed him in Dallas. A dapper , articulate writer dressed in sporty clothes and a blue tie threaded with silver, he knew Hoxsey fo r a span of three decades. But when Esqui1-e magazine first sent Burke to Dallas to expose Hoxsey around 193 7, the journalist was surprised to find that he had already encountered him years before. \"When I first met Hoxs ey, I was a student at the Univer­ sity of Chicag o. I had heard about this man from southern Illinois who was being arrested for curing cancer and I didn' t pay much attention. In the summer there was a notice on my fraternity brothers' board that th ere were jobs to be had. This was in the days of the Depression when it was hard to get a job, and they wanted student s from the university to apply for jobs. I went down to a hotel and here was a young, robust, tall man giving a speech about selling pots and pans. I was fascinated by this man's speech and his drive . Why he wanted university student s was to set up dates with wealt hy families in the suburbs of Chicago, and he would cook a meal and show them what good pots and pans he had. Later on I learned it was Harry Hoxs ey, the cancer man. He could sell anything. He could convince anybody of anything. He had power over people that was per­ suasive . He sounded like he believed in what he was doing. \"About ten years later, Wo rld Wa r II was steaming up and I was still going to school , still work ing my way as a salesman and writing some articles for Esquire. By this time there had been a lot of publicit y here and there about the quack who was treating people with a tonic in Te xas. Arnold Gingrich, my boss, says, 'Hoxsey is getting too big and the Ameri­ can Medical Associ ation would like to put him out of business. Yo u go down there and get acquai nted with him, and we'll do a coup le of pieces on him and put an end to thi s.' It was an assignment. \"So it was arranged and I did come to Dallas to meet Hoxsey throug h a fraternit y brother who gave big parties. He was introduced to me and I told him right off, 'I'm down here for Esquire magazine to expose you, so we might as well get this thing straight on the table.' He smiled and said, 'What time do you want me to pick you up?' \"Next morning at eight A.M., he was at the door. He took me out to his clinic, which was a converted dog kenne l. He had a few old men and women sitting around there, and he led me around and introduced me as 'Doctor Burke from the Univ ersity of Chicag o.'

' I thought any"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"80 THE WILDE ST STORY IN MEDIC AL HISTORY moment I'm going to get information that he's a quack and be on my way.\" Burke followed \"Doc,\" as he was commonl y known, on his rounds. \"His first patient had been an old gentleman that he had been treating for six or eight week s who had cancer of the eye. I learned later that he was not supposed to treat people because he wasn't a doctor. He did have an old doctor on the payroll who'd sit around and watch him, but Harry did it all himself . He brought the patient in, took off the bandage, and he says, 'Well, dad, I told you, you were going to get well. Let me take that thing off. ' He took his scalpel and peeled it off, and sure enough, the cancer was gone, and he threw it in the wastebasket. He put some medi­ cation on it and put a bandag e on it. \"The next patient was the wife from a wealthy young coup le in their mid-f orties. The man was very concerned because the doctors had told him his wife had a melanoma and there was no way to treat her to get well. So this man wanted to talk to Dr. Hoxsey private ly. I met with him in another room while his wif e was lying on the treating table. This man wanted to know if he could cure her . Harr y was posit ive that he could, so the man wanted to know about what it was going to cost him. Harry said, 'You don't believe I can cure her, and I do believe I can cure your wife. Let's go down to the bank and I'll put $10,000 in esc row, and you put up $10,000. The day your doctor says she's well, I pick up the money.' So that was agreed upon, and he came back for the treatment, and I learned later that doctors never put a scalpel on a melanoma . So Harry looked at this woman. She had it on her navel, a big black one about the size of a walnut. He took his scalpel, slashed it two or three ways , put some of his powd er on it, put a bandage over it, and said, 'Go get dressed .' He gave the husband a bottle of his tonic and said, 'Now you come back next week. ' So I thought, well, this is pure quacker y.'' Burke decided to do some further checking of his own. \"Six mont hs later, I went over to Fort Worth, saw this woman and she was well. Tw o years later, I checked on her and she was well. Graduall y I became a be­ liever. A believer, not a disciple. I became friends with Hoxs ey. He had a great heart, and he was able to cure people as far as I could see. \"I expected to stay about a day, get my information and leave. I be­ came fascinat ed. I stayed for six weeks. Every day Ha rry would pick me up and bring me to the clinic. Hoxsey was a fascinating man. He was highly intell igent, but rather crude- talking, but not in an obscene or vul­ gar way. We 'd come in in the morning and he would put his arm around these old men and wom en, and say 'Dad, them doctors been cutting you up, but I ain't gonna let those sons of bitches kill you.' They'd begin to get better and begin to get well."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Gone to Te xas 81 \"Of course, Arnold Gingrich had sent me down here to write an ar­ ticle exposing Harr y Hoxsey as a quack.

I sent it back to the editors, but I guess it was too hot-i t never came out.\" Meanw hile Hoxsey' s splenetic feud with the Dallas County Medical Societ y escalated. Between 193 7 and 1939, he was arrested more than one hundred times. 13 The eager young assistant district attorney AI Te mplet on brought most of the cases against him. Not one of the-charges resulted in a conviction because none of his patients would testify against Hoxs ey. As Jim Burke recalled, \"He always carried a big roll of money, about $10,000, in his pocket. The authorities would pick him up and put him in jail, and he'd bail himself out. Once in a while he would deliber ­ ately stay in jail a few days. He knew what would happen.

The cancer returned and spread throug h his body . Down to eighty-three pounds, Mike Te mplet on was doped up on morphine, waiting to die. The odor became so unbearable that he had to go live with an uncle, where he was attended by private nurse Jack Howard .14 When Jack Howard showed up in November at Hoxs ey's clinic seek­ ing help, Hoxsey asked if Mike Te mpleton' s D.A. brother knew he was there. The answer was no. Hoxsey agreed to treat Mike secretl y. Within a month, Mike Te mpleton was off the narcotics and gaining weight. On Christmas morning, he rose from bed, dressed himself , and went to his brother's house. Standing at the door, he asked if he could borrow the shotgun.

He resigned his post of seven years as assistant D.A. to sign on as Hoxsey' s lawyer. 15 When he appeared in court at Hoxsey' s next arraignment, Dr. Crowe was shocked at finding his prosec utor now com­ fortably seated at Hoxsey' s table, while the judge informed him he had to drop or refile all the cha rges prepared by Te mplet on.

He began his political ascent in Te xas. 17 Unable to get patient s to testify against Hoxs ey, the medical societ y took another tack. In the racially segregated southern city whose news­ paper ran headlines such as \"Neg ress Sues for Alimon y in Steak s,\" Hoxsey was already notorious for letting black people in the front door with everyone else. In a confide ntial letter Hoxsey managed to obtain, W F. McBride of the Te xas State Board of Medical Examiner s wrote to the counsel fo r the board, \"It seems that we are having a hard time connect­ ing up a good case on Hoxsey where white people have been treated.

He never shunned anyone. He'd always say that you never knew when you might be down and out, and someone you helped along the way might help you. \"211 Unable to get black patients to testify against Hoxs ey, the medical societ y resorted to other tactics. In 1940 Hoxsey learned that pathologist Dr. Marvin Bell, threatened with the revocation of his medical license, would no longer perform biopsies for him. Since a biopsy is consi dered the only verifiable proof of cancer , Hoxsey could no longer validate his cures. He soon found himself excluded from obtai ning cruci al medical records from labor atories, hospit als, and doctors across the country .21 Dr. Crowe continued the bombar dment of legal cases, but gained only one conviction , which was overtur ned. In 1940 a beleag uered Dr. Hartzog brought suit against Dr. Crowe . Hoxsey gathered over one hundred pa­ tients from all over the Southeast in front of]udge W. L.

Moreover, World Wa r II was in full swing now, the newspapers had little space to devote to the involved controversy between Harry M. Hoxsey and the AMA . \"24 In 1942, however, Dr. Hartzog had a nervous breakd own under the relentless pressure from Dr. Crowe and the medical societ y, and quit and moved to Louisia na.

Scothorn , a respected osteopat h and former president of the American Osteopathic Association, took his wife to Hoxsey to treat her ovarian cancer after radiat ion failed. Introduced by Dr. Drew of Philadelphia, he found Hoxsey willing to treat his wife, but equall y interested in getting a fair test. Dr. Scothor n enlisted several osteopat hs to review twenty-seven cases using biopsies they conducted themselves. All but three patient s lived. In the interi m, Mrs. Scothorn got well. Dr. Crowe angrily ordered Dr. Scothom to appear before the Medical Board. He refused, indignant at the affront to his credentials, having served on the State Board under three different governors in a state where osteo­ paths and medical doctors shared equal legal standing. \"I have learned that your reason for calling me is because my wife was treated for cancer at the Hoxsey Cancer Clinic, generally considered a quack institution. I use 'quack' purposely because, since your Board was created in 1907, the AMA has looked upon all irregulars as quacks. But because I decided not to let my wife be destroyed by cancer and encouraged her to go to an irregular institution where she got beneficial treannent, I was told to give up my time and go to the expense of appearing before your Board and explaining my personal af­ fairs. I have practiced in Dallas County for thirty-nine years with never a suit against me nor an insinuation of any kind against my practice or character. I feel grossly insulted by your letter and do not intend to appear before the Board, because, in my opinion, the letter smacks of conspiracy .\"30 Dr. Scothorn' s charge of a conspi racy would increasing ly be echoed by other obser vers and by Hoxsey himself . Robert Heat h of the Dallas County Medical Societ y discounted the notion. \"There really was not a conspirac y in the purest definition of the term conspiracy. There was a concerted effort between many concerned individuals and groups of people to attempt to present truth ful scientific information about where scien­ tific knowledge was at that present time, and where the informat ion Mr. Hoxsey put forth failed to meet the standard of scient ific knowl edge.\"31 Neve rtheless, the trail of the \"concer ted effort\" Heath acknowledged invariably led back to Chicago, where Dr. Fishbein was acquiring kudos as abundant ly as Hoxsey was attracting warra nts. As the undisp uted Vo ice of American Medicine, Dr. Fishbein' s extravagent perso nality was syn­ onymous with the AMA .

While member dues accounted for half the AMA's revenues, the balance flowed from the Journal, now the most profitable publication in the world. Flush with revenues, it soon became known as \"the tail that wagged the dog.\"45 In addit ion, tl1e Journal owned or controlled another half-dozen medical journals along with the thirty-five state societ y journals, with advert ising revenues of over $2 million, a huge sum in those days.46 A5 Milton Mayer wrote for Harper's magaz ine, The Journal was the heart of the AMA , and the heart of the Journal was the AMA Seal of Acce ptance. Posses­ sion of the Seal certifies that a drug, appliance, food prod­ uct, cosmetic, or soap has been accepted by a commit tee of Men in White as advert isable in the Journal. The value of the Seal to the manuf acturer is incalc ulable, and the page in the Journal is only five hundred dollar s or so. Adve rtising men believe, as a class, that if they are good boys they will go to heaven when they die and get a job soliciting for the Journal. \"I turn down as much adver­ tising as I accept -over a million a year, \" the editor said. The Seal is probably the biggest \"puller\" of advertising ever concoct ed. The Journal was a to ll-gate on the high­ way to recog nition of medical research, and the editor was the gatek eeper Y The idea of Journal certification of products was originally devised around 1905 by Dr. Fishb ein's mentor , Geor ge Henr y Simmons, but it was Fishbein who perfected the Seal of Acceptan ce. It positioned the Journal as the sole portal to the medical mark etplace. Ye t the real story behind the money machine it generated was anything but wholes ome. Since it was considered \"unet hical\" to advertise medical products and services directly to the public, all promotions were compelled to traverse a web of arteries flowing directly to organized medicine' s heart in Chi­ cago. Inquiries to advertise in dispar ate county or state medical society journals received a timely reply from the AMA's Cooperat ive Medical Adve rtising Bureau. The broad AMA advertising network would cover with no overlap virtually all states as well as the national market.

However, the company had a scrolling criminal record rife with doz­ ens of convictions by the federal government and state of Pennsylvania for selling putrid butter and eggs. In 193 1 and 1933, Governor Gifford Pinchot of Pennsylvania hauled the company into court for multiple cases of adulter­ ating butter with excessive moisture. In New Yo rk and New Jersey, the com­ pany admitted that 399 cans of frozen eggs were \"filthy, decomposed, and that sugar had been added, presumably to disguise the smell. \"49 Meanw hile, cigarette manuf acturer Philip Morris, the Journal's big­ gest single advert iser, also ran into some problems. Blitzing the AMA Journal and thirty- one state and regional medical jo urnals, the start-up tobacco company was eager to publicize its innovative use of diethylene glyco l as a hygroscopic agent (to retain moisture) , in place of the glycerin used by other manufact urers . Philip Morris pegged its campaign on hyping the break through that its cigaret tes were consequent ly \"less irritating to the throat.\"50 When the corporation approached the Journal with its ads, Dr. £4ishbein courteously advised it how to go about cond ucting acceptable scientific testing to validate its unsubstant iated claims and thereby qua lify. 1 he cigarette manuf acturer was eager to link its product with health benefits, and Dr. Fishbein saw a vast new oppo rtunity for revenues from nonmedical products , despit e the fact that by this time in the 1930s medi­ ·nl journals were alread y publishing studies associat ing smoking with l u ng cancer . The comp any completed its testing at the Columbia University Col­ of Physicians and Surgeons with findings that the cigarettes with thylene glycol caused three times less swelling than other brands. The c·ompany used these studies to launch its medical ad campaign, while sup- 1 1 l y i ng free smokes to doctors .

But, having been black balled in the medical communit y, he was un­ able to provide biopsies in numer ous cases. Instead he supplied the names of laborator ies, hospitals, and doctors where they could be obtained -he presumed corre ctly-through the authorit y of the federal gover nment. What ensued was a bilious dispute over the state ofHoxsey's records. The NCI responded with a letter that fifteen of twent y cases of internal cancer lacked biopsies. It further characterized the other forty cases as inadmissible since they related to external cancer s, and that the majorit y of these also lacked biopsies. \"Obviously ,\" the terse rejection concl uded, \"this does not meet the policy of our Advisory Cancer Counci l. \"5 Hoxsey adam antly contested the NCI' s analy sis. What the NCI called \"externals\" included cases in which there was evidence of the spread of the disease. He provided specific records of biopsies from Dallas patholo­ gists, including Dr. Marvin Bell, where the NCI said there were none. Dr. Bell, however, had changed his tune after being chastised fo r his as­ sociat ion with Hoxs ey. Where six years earlier he found cancer , now, he wrote the NCI, \"the slide I find on Mrs. 0. G.

The status ofHoxsey' s cases dis solved into nebulous confusion . In fact, there was alread y in full swing a \"conc erted effort\" against Hoxsey involving the NCI, AMA , FDA, and Te xas medical authorit ies. The NCI had been in prior contact with the Dallas Count y Medical So­ ciety since at least 1941, when the agency received a letter seeking help prosecuting Hoxsey and complaining about his brochure mailings. The NCI responded that such matters were not under its jurisdict ion, and alternat ively suggested enlisting the Post Office Department for fraudu­ lent use of the mails. Meanw hile, the Dallas substation of the federal Food and Drug Administrat ion, spurred by Dr. Crowe, had been in close contact with the AMA Bureau oflnvestigation for years. Dr .

Thomas served in the Okla­ homa State Senate from its founding in 1907 to 1920 before ascending to Congress and the Senate. A populist and supporter of the farmer, he backed the New Deal and resisted corporat ions, and maintained close ties with his grassroot s constit uents. Yet he was ill prepared for the thorny medical politics about to draw his blood.8 When prosper ous Oklahoma contractor To m Chapman shared with Thomas the story of his child's recovery at the Dallas clinic, he also told the senat or how the Oklahoma Medical Societ y rejected his personal of­ fer to sponsor a Hoxsey test of twenty-five patients under its super vision. Following a similar rejection from the American Cancer Societ y, Chapman approached his senator in consternat ion.9 Senator Thomas visited a dozen Hoxsey patients from the Lawton area and listened to their fantast ical cures . Hoxsey wired Senator Tho­ mas to come to Dallas while fift een osteopaths would be touring the clinic. When the lawmaker arrived on Febr uary 2, 1947, Hoxsey brought in 125 allegedly cured patients amid a mock \"transcript of proceedings\" in a quasi -legal setting. Hoxsey upped the ante with a bold challenge to treat 100 ex-servicemen free of cha rge. If he failed to cure 80 percent of them, he promised to close the clinic and stop treating cancer. 10 The senator per­ sonally interviewed over twenty-five of the cases, focusing on Te xans and Oklahomans, and held a press conference with the Associated Press and United Press wire services as well as other reporters on hand for the show .11 \"I would like to have as much of the record as I can get,\" Senator Thomas told the assemb lage. \"I shall present that then to the medical heads of the bureaus in Washing ton, and I shall ask them to take steps to make an investigation .\"12 He went on to say, \"I'm not a doctor and don't know cancer when I see it. However, I feel that I have gone into the matter sufficient ly to justify asking medical authorities to investigate fur­ ther. If this is a real cure for cancer , as evidenced here today, then it should at least be given a fair test and made available to the wor ld. If not, the man must be exposed .\"13 Senat or Thomas wrote to Surgeon General Thomas Parran, whose authorit y extended to the NCI, requesting an investigat ion. The nega­ tive reply came bundled with copies of anti-Hoxsey JAMA articles and the admonition that it would be imprudent to spend public funds on such a project. 14"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"98 THE WILDEST STORY IN MEDIC AL HISTORY After four months of fruitless efforts, Thomas wrote to Hoxs ey. \"It seems that the medical fraternit y is highly organized and that they have decided to crush you and your institution, if at all possi ble.

In other words, the public officials seem to be afraid of their jobs and even of their lives.\" 1 5 In the next election, the AMA lobbied heavily against Senator Tho­ mas, and he was defeated, receding into private law pract ice. He contin­ ued to support the treatment, directing numer ous patient s to Dalla s.'\" Tw o member s of the Oklahoma State Legislature attempted an inves­ tigation concurrent with Senator Thomas' s efforts. Represent ative Charles Ozman and Senator Homer Paul introduced a resolut ion fo r a joint leg­ islative investigation ofHo xsey. Senator Paul charged from the floor that Dr. Fishbein was personall y blocking a test. The AMA vehement ly op­ posed the resolution, which nevert heless passed. A joint committee of ten senat ors and represent atives as well as three medical advisers trave led to Dallas on March 11, 194 7. At the start of the hearings, four member s were conspic uously absent. Represent ative Dr. A. E. Henning and the three medical advisers arrived late, because they had been secretly clos­ eted with the Dallas County Medical Societ yY Hoxsey trotted out his cured patient s and provi ded sixty case histories of internal cures. He waited several weeks in vain for a response, then made a couple of trips to Oklahoma Cit y to track the matter. The final report from the legislature advised that Hoxsey' s refusal to reveal the contents of the medicine \"mak es it impossible to evaluate its possible effect.\" It called the case histories \"insufficient, \" and concluded that the medicines had no beneficial effect on cancer and were \"toxic.\"' H Senator Paul objected furiously to the report. \"We can never get any cooperation on this Dallas cure from the American Medical Association, and I might as well say the Oklahoma Medical Association too. These doctors who went with us down there stayed through the meeting with fear and trembling in their hearts. We tried to get them to help us make out a report but they wouldn't do it until they had contacted the AMA to find out what to do.\" Senat or Paul noted that the stated reason the sixty case histories were deemed inadequate was that the physicians had not examined the patients firsthand. \"I know why they say that,\" he retorted. \"They're afraid of having their licenses revok ed.\" Hoxsey claimed that some of the doctors neverthe­ less covertly \"bootlegged\" patients to him for man y years afterward .19"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Hoxsey compl ained bitterly that once again the AMA sandb agged an investigation by coercion and innuendo. \"They all say they've been treated unfairly and that medicine won't pay attention to them ,\" the AMA's Oliver Field told our camera about \"quacks \" in general and Hoxsey in particu­ lar. \"It's true, because medicine does know that their products are worth­ less. If they had any merit they would be used. It's a rather unfair thing, really, to expect the AMA to waste its time with something that it knew was absolutely useles s.\"20 Undaunt ed, Hoxsey kept building his clinic. In 1946 he hired Dr. Joseph Durk ee, an osteopathic doctor who became the sh i ning star of Hoxs ey's staff fo r the next six years . A sophistic ated physician dedic ated to natural medicine, Dr. Durkee began to keep the proper records Hoxsey never had and initiated extensive resear ch. Along with Mildred Nelson, he became a tr usted associat e just as the clinic started its rapid expansion. Hoxsey kept the formulas in a bank safe deposit box in case of his death, while Dr. Durkee swore to stay with him \"till the bell rings.\"2 1 In 1946, Hoxsey moved from his overf lowing facilities at Brian and Peak into 4507 Gaston Avenue, the fo rmer Spann Sanit arium. He said he bought it from Dr. Spann, but the word on the street was that he won it in a game of dominoes with an unlucky Real torY An inveterate gambler , Hoxse y also frequented the racet rack, and started holding week ly poker games at his house with prominent local citizens including Judg es Al Te mplet on and Joe Brown. As the clinic grew and receipts rose, he made $10,000 donations to each of their campaig ns.21 Hoxsey had further cause to celebr ate. After years of bad luck wild­ catting, the incorrig ible gambler struck oil. \"Dad and his partner dug thirteen dry holes ,\" recalled his son. \"Finally his partner ran out of money and had to bow out. Dad hit a gusher on number fourteen. He gave his partner 50 percent anyway.\" Hoxsey's daughter added, \"Dad always loved a long shot.

Nevert heless, he was determined to lift Dr. Fishbein' s \"Iron Curtain\" and speak truth to power for the world to hear.37 While Hoxsey burrowed in, Dr. Fishbein' s invulnerabilit y was crack­ ing under mounting notoriety. As Milton Mayer wrote in Harper's, He had loved the AMA as he loved himself , and greater love had no man. Organized medicine might be a little seedy to its critics; it was always young and fair to Fishbein . The trouble was that under his loving care it was fading fa st away. Physicians who were interested in something besides their fees resented their identifica­ tion with his low-com edy routine. Worse, the routine wasn' t stemming the rising tide of protest -in as well as out of the medical profession-ag ainst the inaccessi bil­ ity of medical care to millions of Americans . Morris Fishbein not only had an Amer ican Dream: He was one. In his square-fin gered hands he held the pries tly power of one hundred fo rty thousand Men in White. He knew ten thousand practit ioner s by name, and among those ten thousand were what Fishbein calls \"the men who count.\" The AMA's membership was a model of detail. \"We keep track of everyt hing and ev­ erybody, \" said the editor with a small smile. Fishbein did the Associ ation' s shoe-leat her work. He did its lung­ leather work, too, and that was his peculiar genius. Non-members of the A.MA were the scum of Fishbein' s earth. Medicine was, and still is, good for lim­ itless exploitat ion, and when Fishbein set himself up in business it was virgin territor y. Medicine needed a spokesman; it got a spieler.

As expectations of the epic courtroom confrontation ballooned, Hoxsey started to draw attention from other mainstream medical groups that had scrupulousl y ignored him for so long. When the influential Ameri­ can Cancer Societ y, a mainst ay of the cancer establishment, sent its rep­ resenta tive Pat McGrad y Sr. to have a look, he found Hoxsey in a bold mood. \"We got a real scient ific place,\" the clinic operator told McGrady with typical bravado, and immedi ately cut to his obsession with Dr. Fishbein. \"I got him this time.

For breast cancer , he claimed a 50-60 per­ cent cure. Hoxsey complained that his clinic was a \"dumping ground\" for the terminal patients of the Dallas doctors and he had to turn away 20 percent, the hopeless cases. He claimed an 80 percent cure rate for patient s with internal cancer who had not received prior surgery and radiat ion.47 Dr. Durkee held an exalted position within the National Medical So­ ciety, an alternat ive to the AMA that was growing rapidl y with the many M.D.' s, naturopaths, chiropractors, and osteopaths espousing natural medi­ cine pract ices.

It was not until after Wo rld Wa r II that formal clinical testing to prove therapies began and not until the 1960s that it became widesprea d.

They revealed that he had operated under various noms de plume around Te xas, lied about his medical degrees, and left a weavi ng trail of alcohol abuse, all of which was true. Once again, Hoxsey was easy to discredit.r.t Then the Hear st lawyers played the joker in their deck, introducing a death certificate sho wing that Hoxsey' s father died of cancer . They con­ tended John C. Hoxsey had trave led to a St. Louis hospit al specializing in cancer , and checked out several days lat er. They alleged that he had been diagnosed there with cancer of the jaw, and recei ved radium but rejected surge ry. All recor ds, however, had been destroyed. The eviden­ tiary death certifi cate they submitted lacked the signature of an attending doctor , but in its place the Hear st lawyers supplied a sworn affidavit from the widow of a local doctor. However, there was no biops y, breaching steadf ast AMA policy regarding patholog ical proof Y Although prior Journal editorials had repeatedl y made the same allega­ tion about John C. Hoxsey' s death from cancer, Hoxsey was blindsided by the death certificate.63 He furiously condemned the document as a crude fake. His own lawyers had been searching for the document for many years since it seemi ngly disappear ed from state and county records shortly after AMA investigators first came to Ta ylorvi lle in 192 5.64 Hoxsey pointed out that the \"fake\" certificate had been filed in 1926, seven years after John C. Hoxsey' s death, and listed the wrong place of burial. Hoxsey did admit accompan ying his fa ther to the Missour i cancer hospit al, but said the diag­ nosis was ery sipelas, not cancer, and that his fa ther took no treatment there. Judg e Atwell nevertheless permi tted the death certificate into evidence.65 While Hoxsey was reeling from the shock, the Hearst lawyers riveted the courtroom by unwra pping their \"surpr ise\" witness. \"I don't know how Harry knew, but he did,\" chuckled Mildr ed. \"He knew what plane Fishbein was leaving Chicag o on, what time he'd arrive in Dallas, and where he was staying. \" As Hoxsey' s son recalled, \"Like they used to say, they kept the motor running at Love Field [airport]. He was supposed to leave town right after testifying. \"'''' Nobody was supposed to know that Fishbein was in town, but Hoxsey knew.

He had outraged them, too. President s of the Association had come and gone, nameless, face­ less, voiceless before the coun try. They were as impotent inside the organization as outside. Fishbein held all the strings, knew everything, was everywh ere, did everything. The taunt of \"the American Fishbein Association\" was a telling one. The knives flashed like satin in the sun.73 When finall y Hoxsey reeled Fishbein into court in 1952, it was as a pri­ vate citizen stripped of the bullet proof mantle of organized medicine. Rejecting eleventh-hour settlement offers, Hoxsey got his third day in court before Judg e W. L. Thornton . He pitted his down-home patient s against the blue-chip array of doctors from the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopk ins, and other elite cancer instit utions .74 Te lling ly, the defense made no attempt to resubmit the death certificate of Hoxsey' s fa ther. By now Hoxsey and Jimm y Martin had traveled to St. Louis and Illinois and tracked down the records, including evidence that the original document had disappear ed mysteriously from the official files. As Martin recalled, \"We examined the hospital records and the books where they had a notat ion of his fa ther' s entry and death. Someb ody had tam­ pered with that. It had been written down what he had died from, but they scratched it out. It was very obvious they inserted the word cancer. \" 75 The AMA's alleg ed fo rgery was equaled, however, by records that Hoxsey him­ self later provi ded, which also appear to have been alter ed. Once again, conflicting accounts evaporated in the swamp gas of medical politics.76 Dur ing the testimon y of several external cases, Fishbein' s lawyer stopped the proceedi ngs with a staggering admission. The Fishbein de­ fense conceded that the Hoxse y treatment does cure external canceT. \"We don' t deny that they cure cancer out there at the clini c,\" attorney Julian C.

Under oath, Dr. Fishbein made shock ing admi ssions. He fa iled anatomy in medical schoo l. He never com­ pleted his internship before going to work at the Journal. He never prac­ ticed a day of medicine or treated a single patient in his entire career . Dr. Fish bein was sweating profusel y by the time he left the stand.

If Fishbein did pri­ vately believe that Hoxsey' s remedies were authenticall y valuable, he must have lamented the cosmic curse of finding them in the hands of an ex­ coal miner so unworthy of the gift. As a doctor , Fishbein was a fraud. He exhibited no calling as a healer and never treated a patient. While Hoxsey was practi cing medic ine with­ out a license, Dr. Fishbein was practicing license without medici ne. His legitimate credent ials were as a medical journalist and politician, at which he exce lled, at least in his milieu. Nevert heless, like Hoxs ey, he was un­ questionably a true belie ver in his own brand of medicine. Many people considered Hoxsey a liar, and he routinely played rather wide with the truth, though appar ently not about his medical cases, the central issue. On the other hand, Dr. Fishbein became the master of the Big Lie: Te ll a lie big enough, often enough, and people will belie ve it. His false accusations about Hoxsey' s external remedies and subsequent reversal are ample evidence. That his own medical credentials were a fiction buried a painful hypocrisy under the inflammat ory tenor he brought to eradicat ­ ing medical fraud that would fracture med icine for the rest of the century. Both men desp erately wanted fame and recognit ion, and each got it in his own way. They became mast ers of publicit y, and perfected their respec­ tive schtick. Tireless promoters, Hoxsey and Fishbein graced the same pages of Time, Life , and Newsweek. H 3 Ye t as a folk healer during an era that con­ demned herbal and natural medicine as \"unscientific\" and primitive, Hoxsey was tarred on his forced descent into a Hadean unde rworld of quacke ry. His unsavory alliances certainly welded him with spikes and fins that re­ pelled many potential allies. The \"recessive\" ego that drove him to be a big shot also made an easy target. His rough coal-miner language and vulgar mann ers further sku nked innumerable potential supporters . The two figures also refl ected a deep class division. Always the under­ dog, Hoxsey adopted a populist persona that seems to have been genuine. His financi al largesse toward his patients was an authentic expression of his political bona fides. His explicit battle against the Medical Trust refl ected his conscious opposit ion to the commercializ ation and monopolizat ion of medicine by the interests of big business . When Hoxsey' s father warned his boy about the High Priests of Medicine who would \"fight you tooth and nail because you were taking mone y out of their pocket s,\" the counsel prepared him for the cutting edge of the emerging business of medicine. As an underdog not unlike Hoxs ey, Fishbein was equall y hungry for stature. Born in 1889 in St. Louis, Miss ouri, he was the son of a Jewish immigrant peddler who moved the fa mily to unglamor ous lndianapo­ lis. 8 4 Ye t Fishbein went on to gain the social prestig e he crave d, molting"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Hoxse y vs. the AMA 11 7 into an urbane sophisticate hobnobbing with the rich and famous.

Simultane ously, under his direc­ tion doct ors became the single richest profession in the countr y. While Hoxsey was letting black people in the front door in segregated Te xas, Dr. Fish bein' s AMA was a club of white men that ent irely barred blacks (and women) from member ship.85 The contrast was also very human.

A small child, little Morris was frustrated in his efforts to push his way through the crowd to behold the spectacle. \"Soon an ambulance drove up,\" he recounte d, \"and a little fellow dressed in white with a black bag jumped out.

During his quarter -cent ury building the most powerful trade group in the world, the crowd parted for him. At the same time, he used that crowd to block Hoxsey from the recog nition he hung ered fo r. In the end, Hoxsey turn ed the tables on the High Priest of Medicine. It was a stubborn victory for the populist dark horse hobbled for so long by his medical nemesis . Although the financial penalt y was minuscule, the grand symbolism was not lost on the AMA . It was Hoxsey' s spectacular victory over Dr. Fishbein that paradoxi­ cally ended up bringing down the house on both men. The AMA was increasing ly tremulous over its potential liabilit y in the escalat ing law­ suits resulting from Fishbein' s zealo us quarter -cent ury of quack attacks and political escapades. The organization rid itself of him and then de­ liber ately deflected Hoxsey into the fine-t oothed gears of the federal gover nment.

What the NCI was not telling him was that its solicitation was prompted by a request for the records by the FDA for the federal case it was preparing against him.1 When Hoxsey at last received a reply from NCI Director Dr. J. R. Hell er, the terse letter indic ated that the agen cy's review committee, the omnipotent Nationa l Advisory Cancer Counci l, still found the records inadequate.

Faci ng an unrelenting series of FDA legal actions, Hoxsey was about to be busier than a cat in a roomful of rocki ng chair s.

This time the Hoxsey tonic was unav oidabl y on trial, and the gove rnment was set on using the court s to elimin ate it from interstate commerce . Again Hoxsey faced off against the arist ocracy of American medici ne. The doctors testified that his medi­ cine couldn' t have any posit ive effect on cancer and might mak e it worse. Dr. Little's latest negat ive finding s were introduced as evidence . Bol­ stered by the testimo ny of prominent physicians, the govern ment as­ serted that the only acceptable methods for treating cancer were surger y and radiat ion. Among those testi fying was Dr. Gilcin Meadors, chief of Te chnical Services at the NCI, who reiterated the agenc y's position that Hoxsey' s submissions to the agency did not meet it s most basic criteria fo r a test. However, under cross-examination, Dr. Meador s acknowl edged that the NCI could have obtained the biopsy records in quest ion. But, he said, doing so would constit ute an investigat ion, which it was not authorized to conduct without the prerequisite record s. It was a textbook case of bureaucratic Cat ch-22.U When Hoxsey called his panopl y of cures to the stand, the prosecu­ tion once more objected voci ferously to admi tting the testimony of laypeople. Judg e Atwell overru led yet again and permitted the witnesses to describe their dramatic recove ries. The Hoxsey defense vigorously attacked the limit ations of conven­ tional cancer treatments . At the time, the Ame rican Cancer Societ y was claiming about a 32 percent five-year survival rate using conventi onal treatment s. However, as local treatme nts, surgery and radiat ion treat­ ment s could be applied to only about 25 percent of cancer s.14 After six days of testimon y, Judge Atwell retired to his chambers, returning the next afternoon to an overflowing courtroom to present his \"Finding s of Fact and Conclusions of Law .\"15 This time the judge did not sidestep passing judgment on the efficac y ofHoxsey' s medicines. He found: \"That the respondent s' treatment is not injurious . Some it cures and some it does not cure, and some it relie ves somewhat. That respon­ dent s do not guarantee to cure . That the percentag e of ef ficient and beneficial treatment s by respondent s is reasonabl y comparable to the effici ency and success of surgery and radium, and without the physical suffering and dire consequences of radium, if impr operly administer ed, and surger y if not successful in compl etely removing the entire malig ­ nant port ion.\""},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Uncle Sam's Quack down 121 Judg e Atwell declared Hoxsey not guilty of false and misleading la­ beling essent ially because he did have a real cure, though not a cure -all.

With his cure validated for a second time by a federal court, Hoxsey was on a roll. The AMA Journal struck back instantly with an editor ial headlined, \"Comment on Court Opinion That Internal Cancer Can Be Cured by Medicine .\" The editori al decried the admission of the lay testimony of patie nts, and called for an immediat e appeal .16 The government appeal took place without a jury in November 1951 in the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court in Fort Wo rth. It was handled as a kind of modern star chamber in which the case was based solel y on the prior trial record. No witnesses or further testimon y were allowed. In a rare judicial upset, the higher court reversed Judg e Atwe ll, point edly handing down its verdict in the middle of Hoxsey' s second trial against Dr. Fishbein in the summer of 1952. The court opinion adhered to the AMA's position that lay witnesses were unqu alified to testify regar ding cancer and entirely eliminated their testimony from considerat ion. The court found: \"The evidence as a whole does not suppor t the finding s of the trial that 'some it cures , and some it does not cure , and some it relie ves somewhat.

Atwell was outra ged, having been re­ versed but twice in his twenty-seven years on the bench. The two sides met to work out a deal.

It politicized a legitim ate difference of medical opinion, a disag ree­ ment whose rightful resolution is in a laborator y or clinic. The act also initiat ed a cruci al strat agem that the FDA would continue to employ up to the present day of using labeling laws to restrict or ban treatment s not conf orming to orthodox views . The ruling amounted to a gag order on one of the loudest mouths around. Hoxsey was fo rced to jettison his literature and stop shipping medi­ cines to the ten states where doct ors were administ ering the Hoxsey treat­ ment. z; All patient s would now be compelled to travel to Dallas to get the remedies by prescription from the clinic. But when the FDA sent agents to Dallas to inspect the clinic in 1954, they found Hoxsey unrepent ant. \"We were invited quite graciously into his office,\" wrote Inspector Prillma yer. \"We were notified by Hoxsey that he had nothi ng to hide and wished to cooperate with us in every way. Hoxsey was quite errati c in his conversation as he would divert the subject time and again about his re­ cent oil strikes that were bringing him in millions. Hoxsey began his usual story of how he welcomed any investigat ion. Hoxsey launched into quite an anim ated spiel of how he was helping mank ind, how the profit motive had never entered into his mind, how he had cured thousands of cancer cases given up as hopeless by the medical practit ioners, how he intended to do so in the fa ce of all the dif ficulties until 'they lay me out on a slab or bring in the milit ia,' as that is the only way he could be preven ted from operating. \"26"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"uncle ::,am·s Quackdown 12 3 Hoxsey bragged to the FDA agents about his latest suitors.

Dr. L. T. Cog geshall, a highly respected Chic ago doct or and dean of the Division of Biological Sciences of the Univers ity of Chicag o Medical School , had been con­ tacted by a local Hoxsey patient seeking his attention about the alleged cure of his son. Dr. Cog geshall in turn called the American Cancer Soci­ ety, which encouraged him to go to Dallas and report back. Dr. Cogg eshall agreed condit ionall y if Dr. Andrew C. Ivy would accompan y him because of his \"prominence in the national cancer prog ram. \"3 1 As vice president of the Univers ity of Illinois and head of its medical school, the largest in the countr y, Dr. Ivy was among the most venerated cancer researcher s in the nation. He was fo rmer execu tive director of the elite National Advi sory Cancer Council at the NCI and former board member of the American Cancer Societ y. The organizer of the Naval Medical Resea rch Instit ute, he had presi ded on behalf of the United States at the Nuremberg trials on the quest ion of medical ethics, at the recom­ mendat ion of the AMA itself . As a committed cancer man, Dr. Ivy agreed to join Dr. Cog geshall to look over the clinic.32 Dr. Cogg eshall also wanted Dr. Ivy along because he was trying to immuniz e himself against the contagious controversy surro unding Hoxs ey. When Oliver Field, di rector of the AMA Bureau of Inve stigation, first caught wind in 1948 that the esteemed Chicag o doc­ tor was considering an investigation of the Hoxsey Clinic, he wrote , \"I advised him that he would get himself in troubl e.\"33 Dr. Coggesh all un­ derstood that venturing to Dallas was a perilous act, even for the top figures in medicine. Drs. Ivy and Cogg eshall arrived at the clinic on February 10, 1949, and met with Dr. Durke e, who explained the remedies and freely dis­ cussed their constituent s. He conceded that poor or no records had been kept until his arriv al, and their investigation of various cases left them unimpress ed. \"We told Mr. Hoxsey that we had seen nothing which con­ vinced us that any inter nal cancers or metastases had been cured,\" Dr. Ivy later wrote , \"and that we were not particularly interested in the result s of treatment of skin cancers with escharotics, because we knew that they worked in some cases and that by radiolog y and surgery 95 percent could be cured.\" Dr. Ivy concluded that Hoxsey' s reputed cures were either cases of wrong diagnosis or the result of a delayed reaction to conven­ tional treatment .34 Nevert heless, Dr. Ivy strongly recommended that the American Can­ cer Societ y conduct a formal investig at ion. He observed that Hoxsey' s \"business quite obviously impr oves on high-grade opposition, since it seems to cause some patients and some prominent lay persons to belie ve"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Uncle Sam's Quackdown 12 5 that Mr. Hoxsey is being persecut ed. It would be an interesting experience to try a new appr oach to test and prove early the truth or falsity of an alleged cancer cure and in this way attempt to prevent the exploitat ion of the cancer patient. \"35 Dr . Cogg eshall concur red. \"There is absolut ely no way to determine whether he has anything of merit other than by a care­ fully supervised study in his clinic. In my opinion, Mr. Hoxsey is a very clever man. He seemed genuinely interested in having his method of treat­ ment evaluated by experts, and was complet ely willing to show the records of every case, including failures.\"36 As part of the terms, Dr. Ivy obtained Hoxsey's firm agreement not to advertise any test that might be arrang ed. This strong prompting by the eminent doctors did not lead to an invest igation, but Dr. Ivy soon found himself embroiled in his own controversy. If he was suspicious of Hoxsey' s tall tales of persecut ion, he was about to get a crash course in medical polit ics that would derail his career and test his faith in the medical instit utions he dear ly loved and himself helped build. Dr. Ivy had been fa scinated with cancer since his earliest medical edu­ cation , first developing a theory about it as a graduat e student in 1917 at the University of Chicago. He suspected that decreased resistance or a defic iency of some sort in the body led to the disease' s development. He concentrated his research on a natural subst ance in the liver that might inhibit the growth of the disease. He was approached in 1950 by another scientist working along similar lines. Dr. Stefan Durovic, a Yugoslavian researcher who had emig rated to Argent ina, conducted experi ment s there with government support, isolating an immune- boosting natural sub­ stance. Dr. Durovic injected horses with actinom yces, the organism that causes lump y jaw, a cancer like disease in animals, in hopes of stimulating their bodies to produce an immune react ion. He then ext racted what he belie ved was the immune -boosting factor from their blood.37 Dr. Ivy worked quiet ly with Dr. Durovic at the University of Illinois medical school and in private Chicag o hospit als for eighteen months, testing what they called Krebiozen. On Mar ch 26, 195 1, Dr. Ivy held a press conf erence at the Drake Hotel before one hundred scientists, phy­ sicians, and resea rchers in Chicag o to discuss Krebiozen as a possible agent for a new cancer dr ug. He related his obser vations of twent y-two cancer cases that were terminal when Krebi ozen was given to th em. Four­ teen were still alive, and two no longer had any evidence of the disease. Always fastidiously conservat ive in his projections, he was adamant in making no claims fo r the drug. \"It is my opinio n,\" Dr . Ivy wrote in a press release inviting the select medical group to review his data, \"that the substance merit s a thoroug h"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"ll.b lni: VVILUI:�I .:>IVr.l ll'j nt:UI'-1\"\\L nl.::>l\\..l r.l clinical study and evaluation since I belie ve it shows much promise in the manag ement of the cancer patient.\"3 8 To the electri fied gathering, he cir­ cumspect ly stated, \"Krebiozen is not to be viewed as a final goal in the chemot herapy of canc er, but I belie ve it is an impo rtant step in that di­ rection. I could hardly belie ve my eyes when measurement s showed an effect on humans sometimes in twen ty-four hour s.\"39 Dr. Ivy was immediat ely discredited by the medical profession . He was susp ended by the Chicag o Medical Societ y fo r three mont hs for us­ ing a \"worthless drug\" for cancer. He was stripped of his post as vice president of the Univer sity of Illinois, and volunt arily resigned from the American Medical Asso ciation. Incredulous, he fo und himself cast down from the acme of his prof ession . Ye t there were other , more disturbing circumstances besides outright intellec tual suppr ession, and like Hoxsey, Dr. Ivy now charged a conspi racy. Illinois legislat ors in 1953 appoint ed a commission to determine whether there was a conspir acy against Krebioz en and its sponsors. The target of the most alarming accusations was Dr. J. J. Moore, treasurer of the AMA and a promi nent Chicag o patholog ist. Dr. Durovic and Dr. Ivy alleged that Dr. Moore approached them with an offer fo r $2.5 million fo r the drug's distribution rights fo r two businessmen, associ ates of Dr. Moore . Dr. Ivy said he advised Dr. Moore that he first needed to com­ plete his testi ng. If Krebiozen proved effective , Dr. Ivy told him, he then planned to offer the drug nonexclus ively in commerce to preve nt price goug ing. He contended that his refusal resu lted in Dr. Moore' s threat to destroy Krebiozen and ruin both him and Dr. Durovic through his influ­ ence with the AMA and the univer sity. � 11 An article derogatory to Krebiozen quickly surfaced in the AMAJour­ nal, asserting that ninet y-eig ht of the one hundr ed Krebiozen patient s had died.�' Its claim was quick ly repudiat ed when ten patient s term ed dead or dying wrote letters to the Krebiozen Invest igating Commi ttee certifying they were alive and weliY Dr. Ivy charged that his records had been deliber ately fa lsified. Senat or Paul Douglas of Illinois headed up the legislat ive inquiry, which found that FDA repo rts attacki ng Krebioz en were \"based on un­ fa ir, inaccurate, and prejudiced statement s.\" At a press conf erence, Sena­ tor Douglas comment ed, \"Medical people are highly cons ervative, and the pundit s in medicine -the medical politicia ns-do not like inno va­ tion. There are a lot of other circumst ances in this particular Krebiozen case which may impl icate the American Medical Association itself , but I shall not mention them. I'll merely say that this is too impor tant a subject to be left purel y to medical politici ans.\"41"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The similar ity of Dr. Ivy's charges to those ofHoxsey was unmist akable: a failed attempt by an AMA official to buy his formulas, followed by black­ balling and a refusal to test the thera py. Where Hoxsey fit the image of a quack, Dr. Ivy surely did not. By echoing the allegations of conspiracy and dirty deals, Dr. Ivy gave weight to Hoxsey' s seemingly incredible story. \"After Dr. Ivy got started with Krebioz en,\" recalled Mildred Nelson , \"they almost buried him. He called Harr y. I was in the office when this call for outside help came in. 'What do you do? [Dr. Ivy asked.] How can I get out of this so I can go on?'

Hoxsey and Dr. Ivy, however, were far from the only ones to land on organized medicine' s \"inde x\" for their pursu it of alternat ive appr oaches to cancer . Serial condemnat ion over the course of the century left a trail of shattered careers and untested therapies. Prominent among them was William Freder ick Koch, M.D., Ph.D., a reputable labor atory scient ist }1Ild professor of physiolog y at the Detroit Colleg e of Medic ine. Dr. Koch built on the seminal discovery of Dr. Otto Warburg in the early twenti­ 'th century that cancer arises as an anaerobic condit ion in the absence or leficiency of oxyge n. He belie ved that the chemist ry of natural immunit y in tl1e body is able to destroy the toxicity of germs, and hypot hesized that Lhe body's oxidation mechanism is the key to burning off an excess of poisons. He devised two injec tible drugs, Glyo xilide and Benzoquinone, synthetic antitoxins that, he conj ectured, act as oxidation catal ysts to help th e body both build cell tissues and burn up waste product s. He also be­ lieved stron gly in the importance of diet and int estinal cleansing. When another practit ioner applied his work to human patients, the drugs showed impressive result s not only in cancer but also in tuberculosis and other di eases.45 Dr. Koch's work was highly praised in an AMA Joumal editorial in 191 3, and then condemned in 1919 after he claimed to treat eight cancer ·a es succe ssfull y, while simult aneously criticizing surgery and radiation. n ill-fated test ensued before the Wayne Count y Cancer Commit tee, composed of surgeons and radio logists, and was terminated acrimoniousl y hcfore its complet ion.

Refusing, he was demonized, and doctors associ ating with him were expelled from medical societies or lost their licenses. Dr. A. R. Mitc hell, chairman of the Board of Tr ustees of the AMA and a suppor ter of Dr. Koch, advised the researcher against any further publication in order to safeguard his formulas and methods Y Because Dr. Koch had never bothered to conduct the requisite animal studies with his drugs, the remedies were distributed widel y throug h Canadian stockmen and cattlemen in British Columbia to obtain docu­ mentat ion. Cattlemen in Brazil also took a strong interest. As pragmatic rancher s seeking tangible results, they were impervious to medical ideology. For over twenty year s, the veteri nary communit y carri ed out dramatic cures with the Koch remedies on animals with cancer , tumors, and other afflictions, keeping careful data. Doctors across the United States continued to use the preparat ions on people, and also claimed im­ pressi ve results in a broad array of diseases. Te sts in Mexico and Brazil included success with leprosy and dement ia.48 While conducting experim ents with human beings in Brazil in 1941, Koch alleg ed, he angered a representat ive of Park e-Da vis pharmaceutical company with his successes. Dr. Koch shortly received a communication from the FDA regar ding problems with his labeling. He cut short his trip and voluntarily retur ned to the United States to clear the matter up. He was immediat ely arrested upon his arrival in Miami and jailed in April 1942 on FDA char ges of false labeli ng, a case for which Dr. Fishbein took personal cr edit.4 9 The FDA' s Wa llace Janssen reflected the gover nment' s view when he quoted a federal prosecutor on the Koch remedies, which were highly diluted and contained only fractional amo unts of the \"active\" ingredients: \"This dilution was like dumping a cockt ail into the Detroit River and expecting to get a kick from the water flowing over Niag ara Falls.\"5 0 After five months, the jury set Dr. Koch free. In 1948, he faced new charges, ending in a mist rial. During the trials he was suppor ted actively by William Merrill Dow and Dr. Charles Hale, founders of Dow Chemi­ cal Compan y, who provi ded a thousand-page scientific testimon y docu­ menting the success of the Koch cancer reme dy. Dr. Hale called Dr. Koch a \"moder n Past eur.\"\" Gove rnment attorneys dropped the charges in 1948 amid a national controversy in which Dr. Koch, a devout Christ ian, had now gained wide­ spread public support as well as the representation of the Christian Medical Research Leag ue, a large national nonpro fit foundat ion to which Koch"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"unc1e :>am s �,JuacKaown 12 9 donated his formulas. 52 Senator William Langer supported him in Con­ gress, to no avail.53 Amid rumors of another aggressive government case in the works, Dr. Koch expatriated to Brazil in disgust. A permanent FDA injunction against the Koch remedies was granted in 1950, and a succes­ sion of doctors among the estimated 2,000 daring to use the therapy lost their licenses. Ye ars later , Nobel laureate Dr. Albert Szent-G yorgyi, who developed the free-radical theory of cancer with Dr. Linus Pauling, cred­ ited Dr. Koch as a seminal precursor of his work. 54 Mildred Nelson visited Dr. Koch in Brazil in the early 1960s, and recalled being st umped by his biochemical erudit ion. By the ea rly 1950s, the Hoxsey clinic accommodat ed patients who requested both the Koch remedies and Krebioz en.55 Meanw hile, outside Boston in Medf ord, Massac husetts, Dr. Rober t E. Lincoln was making another discover y. An obscure general practitio­ ner and research scient ist, he had conducted research at Harvard' s Labo­ ratory of Applied Physics on supersonic energ y in medicine, and invented a celebrated mechanical heart pump during his tenure there. When Dr. Lincoln took an interest in studyi ng the germ Staphylococcus aureus, that causes infection, he fell ac ross two strains of a virus that, he believed, attacked and killed the harmful bacterium. He started admin istering these two \"bac teriophag es\" (bact eria-killers) to treat sinusit is and grippe and got \"apparent cures \" in an astounding 95 percent of cases. Serendipit ously he noticed that the treatment seemed to clear up a variet y of secondar y conditions, including arthritis, angina, deafness, and blindness. Also among these was cancer , and his clinic was soon overrun with desper ate cancer patients . 56 A modest man, Dr. Lincoln said there was nothing new about his method except the therapy itself . He sought to destroy bacterial hosts for viruses in the body by using a virus developed to extre me potenc y. The application itself was simple : patients sat in a chair and breathed the strains through a tube. Dr . Lincoln charged from one dollar to five dollars, and accepted charit y cases free. He set up the nonprofit Lincoln Foundation to dispense the thera py. It should have been great news, but his woes had already begun several years earli er. The AMA Journal first rejected Dr. Lincoln' s 1946 paper detailing clinical case histories. When he resubmitted it in 1948 to Th e New En­ gland Journal of Medicin e, it was declined for \"lack of space ,\" althoug h there was room in the publicat ion for an article on \"The Vitamin D Con­ tent of Mare' s Milk. \" Dr. Lincoln invited a resear ch committee from a large Boston hospital to study his work, and was snubbe d.

The societ y meanwhile sent out derogatory letters in response to queries about the treatment. By 1949, the president of the AMA flatly refused to assist Dr. Lincoln in his efforts to publ ish. Among Dr. Lincoln' s cancer patients was Charles To bey Jr., who ex­ perienced a complet e remission. The patient' s fa ther was Senator Charles lobey Sr. of New Hampshire, who became impat ient over the apparent neglect of Dr. Lincoln' s work. The legislator used his clout to demand a formal investigation by the Ve terans Administ ration. A mont h later the Ve terans Administ ration responded that the National Resear ch Council (NRC) , the decision-making body at the NCI, opposed such a test. The sena tor went directly to the NRC and demanded an investig ation. The NRC deflected it back to the Massac huset ts Medical Societ y. Despit e an angry meet ing in the senator' s office, the federal agenc y insisted on de­ ferring the important investigation to the middling state societ y. 57 The Massachuset ts Medical Soci ety set about its \"investig ation\" by sending doctors to inter view Lincoln patients on the back porch of the physician' s home. Societ y representatives made another visit a month later and promised a hospital study, which never mater ialized. Subsequent ly, the suppl y of Lincoln antibiot ics was severed by the labs of Boston Uni­ versity Medical School, where they were manuf actured . Six weeks later , when the supply resumed, Dr. Lincoln discovered suspicio usly that his original strain was not present in the dr ugs. He had wisely retained cul­ tures of the strains, and was able to reconstruct the medicines. In Mar ch 1952, after eight mont hs of study, the Massachuset ts Medi­ cal Societ y released its report rejecting the Lincoln meth od. It attributed the cure of Charles To bey Jr. to prior surge ry and radiat ion. It stated that \"equall y benefic ial result s from X-ray and surgical treatment in this dis­ ease have been reported on patients who did not receive Dr. Lincoln 's treatme nt.\"5K The medical societ y exclusively advocated surgery and ra­ diation as the treatm ents \"of choice .\" It perempt orily dismissed Dr. Lincoln' s bacteri ophage .

A graduate of Boston Univer­ sity Law School, FitzGer ald had a backgr ound as a tough investi gator, trying federal malpractice cases both for and against doctors. Having also served in 1950 as chief counsel to the chair man of the House Commit tee to investigate lobbying act ivities, he knew that the AMA was the biggest lobby in the nation' s capital. We ll schooled in the inner workings of hardball Wa shing ton politics, FitzGe rald began scouring the .toun try, intervi ewing Dr. Lincoln, Dr. Ivy, Harry Hoxs ey, and a half-dozen other similar individuals. He also peered into the recesses of organized medicine' s own war on cancer , but cautiousl y avoided letting the AMA know what he was up to.61 FitzGer ald's secretive passag e through the underbell y of cancer poli­ tics led him to produce an explosive expose for the Senate Commit tee, titled A Conspi1·acy Against the Health of the American People Y It focused in dept h on Harry Hoxsey and Dr. Andrew C. Ivy, while naming a raft of other cancer treatment s systematica lly sunk by organized medicine with­ out fair investigat ion. FitzGera ld affirmed Hoxsey' s court victories and noted Judg e Atwe ll's decisio ns that the Hoxsey treatments were in some ways \"super ior to X-ray, radium, and surgery and do have therapeutic merit.\" Specify ing Hoxsey patient witnesses by name and address, he stated, \"It has been determined by patholog y, in a great many instances by labo­ ratori es who lly disconne cted from the Hoxsey Cancer Clinic, that they were suffering from diffe rent types of cancer , both internal and exter nal, and following treatment they testified they were cured.\" After scrupulous detective work, FitzGerald confirmed the validit y of Hoxsey' s records of reputed cures. FitzGera ld then examined Hoxsey' s fa iled attempt s at a fe deral inves­ tigat ion. \"No such investigation was made. In fa ct, every effort was made to avoid and evade the investigation by the Surgeon General 's office.

J. Moore (for the past ten year s treasurer of the AMA) could involve the AMA in an inter state conspirac y of alarming proport ions. \"It is my profound convict ion,\" FitzG erald cont inued, \"that Krebiozen is one of the most promising materials yet isolated for the management of canc er.

Behind all this is the weirdest conglomeration of corrupt motives, intrig ue, selfishness, jeal­ ousy, obstruction and conspi racy I have ever seen.\" FitzGerald also saw the Lincoln treatment fitting the same ominous pattern of obstruct ion. The government investigator summarized his report by conclu ding, \"My investigation to date should convince this Commit tee that a con­ spiracy does exist to stop the free flow and use of drugs in int erstate com­ merce which alleg edly have therapeutic value. Public and private funds have been thrown around like conf etti at a coun try fair to close up and destroy clinics, hospitals and scientific research laboratories which do not conf orm to the viewpoint of medical associations .\" FitzGerald further directed severe criticism at the limit ations of sur­ gery, X-ray, and radium. He cited the radical difference of opinion within the medical prof ession itself as to both their utilit y and harm. He de­ manded an investigation into the abuse of the AMA's Seal of Accept ance, and duly noted the organi zation 's previous conviction on conspir acy charges. His far-reaching probe turned up a morass of corrupt medical polit ics infilt rating the highest offices in the land.

Tw o week s later, FitzGe rald was relie ved of his job at the Jus­ tice Depar tment, while Senator Bricker was guest speak er at the next AM.A conventi on.63 Oliver Field, director of the AMA Bureau oflnvestiga tion, penned an angry letter to an Or egon doctor about FitzGer ald's tactics. \"It is obvi­ ous,\" complained the AMA official, who never visited the Hoxsey clinic, \"that Mr. FitzGe rald engaged in the rather peculiar stunt of having in­ vestigated the American Medical Associat ion without coming anywhere near it.\"04 With suppor t fr om Charles To bey Jr., FitzGe rald appealed to Senator William Langer , head of the Senate Judiciar y Committ ee, whose two ear­ lier Resolutions to the Senat e to investigate Hoxsey and other alternat ive cancer treatment s had already been smothered in comm ittee. In a leng thy letter to Senator Langer, FitzGe rald reiterated his finding s of a \"giant conspirac y,\" and revisited allegations Hoxsey had long ago made. \"From the evidence I have gathered,\" FitzGerald wrote , \"it appe ars that as early as 1924 the Hoxsey method of treating cancer was con sidered so effective by a former president of a medical associ ation that he personall y presented its sponsor with a written propo sal, which, among other things, prov ided for the relinquishment of valuable prope rty rights in the Hoxsey method and medicines and fo rmulae to the same offici al. The evidence indicates that when the proposition was spur ned, Hoxsey was advised to sign and accept the proposal or face ruination. Such tactics, if true, constitute black­ mail of the rank est order and this evidence should be examined closely to ascertain its cred ibilit y. \" FitzGera ld had seen enough of the seam y side of organized medicine to conclude that both Hoxsey and Dr. Ivy might well be telling the truth.65 FitzG erald closed by noting the prison er's dilemma he suddenl y found himself conf ronting. \"The fact that various agencies of the Federal gov­ ernment are manned by officials who are also active in medical associa­ tions requires a consid eration as to whether or not these officials are di­ recting their first allegiance to the citizens and government of America­ or to these same medical associatio ns.\"66 Besides its obsc ure insertion into the Cong ressional Record, the FitzG erald Report did manag e to reach man y citizens through energetic distribution by advocates including Charles To bey Jr., who printed 22,000 copies and began disseminat ing them nationall y in his crusade against the \"On-American Medical Associ atio n.\" He personall y canv assed the 389 doctors of his homet own, Concord , New Hampshire, to visit Dr. Lincoln"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"and review his reputed 5,000 cured patients.

The floor refused to recognize To bey, and the of ficials threatened to walk out if he persisted in int errupting. There would be no dialog ue on the matter . Along with Hoxs ey, practitioner s such as Ivy, Koch, and Lincoln, most of them respected medical men prior to their transgr essions, were point­ ing to a new therapeutic direction fo r cancer: immunolog y. Their theories wou ld not be em braced by mainstream medicine for over thirty years, and in 195 3 a dark wind of extreme political polar ization was sweeping through the nation' s capit al. Senator Joseph McCarthy was gearing up the commu­ nist witchhunt, a ment ality easily extended to \"quacks.\" \"Anticancer ideol­ ogy became an article of scientific fa ith,\" wrote Alex Jack. \"The disease was an irrational attack, a viral, bacterial or unident ifiable conspir acy sub­ versive to the human body , which must be hunted down and rooted out, whateve r the cost. \" Clear ly there was no room for a diffe rence of medical opinion.\"H Benedict FitzGerald went on to become an attorney for various unor ­ thodox cancer practit ioner s including Harry Hoxsey. Among other cases, he manag ed to free a Maine doctor from an insane asylum where he had been commit ted without having had legal counsel fo r administ ering the Koch remedies in his pract ice. The message was clear: A doctor offering alternative cancer therapies had to be crazy.m The FitzGerald Report exploded organized medicine' s dubious re­ fusal to investigate unconventi onal cancer therapies. FitzGera ld's disturb­ ing charges would continue to reverberate for decades to come in serial scandals displaying a similar pattern . Hoxs ey's charge of a medical conspirac y could no longer be discounted as the publicit y ploy of a lone crank. By 1954 even the staid Yale Law Jounzal would publicl y criticize the AMA's monopoli stic practices .7 0 Against the chor us of protest rising across the coun try from credible doctors, senators, and federal officials, Harry Hoxsey pumped up the volum e."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"8 Twelve Thousand Patients in Dallas: HYou Couldn't Run Me Out of Here with a Gatling Gun\" B ack in Dallas, Hoxsey was flying as high as the booming oil industry's fa med neon winged horse atop the tallest building in town .

In the inter ­ vening years, journalist James Wakefield Burke had ser ved as a test pilot in World War II, after which Esquire commissioned him to write a series of articles covering the Nurem berg trials, including an interview with the infamous Hermann Goering, deput y to Hitler and chief of the Luftwaf fe . Burke stayed on in Europe for sixteen years, and wrote Th e Big Rape, a book about the German invasion of Russi a.6 \"General Lucius D. Clay, the milit ary governor, discovered that I was his cousin,\" Burke recounted to our camera , \"and he asked me to take a leave of absence from Esquire and join his staff, which I did. It was a lot of fun, it was a lot of power. We were like the Roman conquer ors back in the old days . I was very comf ortable in a requisitioned mansion in Berlin. One day I picked up Time magaz ine, and here was this article about the high priest of quack ery, Harry Hoxsey. I smiled and read it. He was in Te xas, according to the article, curing cancer and being put in jail for it. But he was making a lot of money and the AMA was in an uproar . \"Well, I picked up the phone and called him. It was just like no time had passed between. We had become real good friends. I liked the man, thought he was a great per sonalit y, a great human being with a big heart. He was such a salesman, so persuasi ve, that he convinced me to give up this luxurious conqueror' s life in Berlin and return to Dallas to assist him in his battle with the AMA .\" Burke return ed to find Hoxsey thriv ing. \"He was no longer at his old dog kennel. He had converted an old mansion on Gast on Avenue with about seventy rooms. He had at least ten doctors and a bevy of nurses. He was really in the cancer -curing business. He was making so much mon ey, about $17,000 a day, and he had a lot of patient s coming in from all over the world. This had appar ently attracted the Te xas Medical Association as well as the AMA , and he was having a fierce battle with the FDA and the AMA . He had a brilliant mind, but he was handling it badly. He was writing tough , crudel y written le tters in his coal-miner lang uage to gov­ ernment people, trying to defend himself and his cure. \"He wanted to put me on the payr oll, but I didn' t want that because I realized that once I was on the payr oll my effectiveness for him would diminish because I would be just as guilty as he was.

When he would strike a well, he'd draw a line on that lease right next to that well and sell me the adjoining acreage for a dollar an acre. All I had to do was hire somebody to go drill the well. I never got a dry hole .\" Burke took stock ofHoxsey' s situation and launched a new battle plan. He went through the files and quickly concluded he had better take over any official correspondence to important officials. Burke's assessme nt was that Hoxsey needed a thorough makeover, starting with his own quar ­ ters. \"His office looked more like a book ie joint than it did a medical offic e,\" Burke recollected with bemusement. \"It had a little bronze sig n on his desk that said, 'There are two kinds of people in this world: Dem that gets and dem that gets took.

From behind owlish glasses , William Grigg, a public information officer for the FDA, represented these senti­ ments to our camera. \"Lik e some of the best salesmen, he was very con­ vincing. He was what one of our people called a blackguard, the worst kind of scoundrel who had no fe eling that he was harming anybo dy. They've probabl y been all the way back to early man, people that would take other people' s clamshells or their dollar s. He was certainly a master at it. He was a great liar, and he was able to mak e people think he was taking mone y from his oil int erests and plowing it into the clinic out of the goodne ss of his heart. The IRS recor ds, which we tried and were not able to get into one of the court cases , showed that he was doing the reverse. He was actually taking the money from these poor patient s and trying to mak e a buck in the oil business with that money .\"7 The FDA fa iled to produce any document ation to back up its asser ­ tion. But the very fa ct ofHo xsey' s financial winning s was enoug h to rank le gove rnment officials, a portf olio that included a 1 ,500-acre ranch, a dairy products compa ny, manuf acturi ng businesses, and a gold mine in Mexi co. H A confidential FDA memo revealed a close and secret collaboration be­ tween the agenc y and the IRS. \"The Intellig ence Unit of the Internal Reve nue Service has always been very coopera tive,\" the 1954 memo de­ scribed. \"One of the agent s was work ing on Hoxsey at this time, but he wished it to be understood that any information they passed on to us was to be held in the greatest confide nce and that we were under no circum­ stances to divulge the source. I fe lt that we then could take other means of obtaining it so that they would not be suspect ed. The Internal Rev­ enue agent s stated that they were quite perturb ed over Hoxsey' s brag­ ging manner over his having 'beat en the govern ment' in the Food and Drug case, and that 'they knew they were beaten.\"'9 Oliver Field of the AMA Bureau of Investi gation cut to the bottom line. \"The money!

'And if you need to come back, write me a letter and I'll send for you.' How could you not help a man like that? \" Hoxsey unremi tting ly broadcast his call fo r an investigation while organized medicine tried to di sconnect the microphon e. In 1954 ten medi cal doctors from around the coun try dared to make a three-da y in­ vestigation of the clinic. The physicians held a press conf erence at the dose of their visit and made a joint statement, which Hoxsey published as \"Ten Doctors Declar e 'Quack' Cures Cancer .\" \"We find as fact that our investigation has demonst rated to our satisf action that the Hoxsey Can­ cer Clinic is successfull y treating pathologicall y proven cases of cancer , hoth internal and extern al. We as a commi ttee fe el that the Hoxsey treat­ ment is superior to such conventional methods of treat ment as X- ray, ra­ dium, and surgery . We are willing to use it in our office, in our practice on our own patients, when at our discretion it is deemed necessar y.\" In private letters, the ten doctors made addit ional comme nts about 1 heir impres sions: \"That place does the best work in the field of curing ranc er and man y kindr ed condit ions. '' \"I am convi nced that he has some­ th in g for cancer .\" \"They are doing more to relie ve suffering humanit y among cancer suffe rers than all the other doct ors in that city.\" \"Doing very good work-the Hoxsey Clinic is genuine.\" \"Curing about 50 percent of the cases .\" \"The Hoxsey cancer cure is all it claims and more, for if the puhlic knew the real fa cts of its value, there would be an uprising. \"'' The doctors' press conference was blacked out in the media. Oliver Field had been busy blank eting the nation' s press with letters advising reporters against promoti ng quac kery. \"I'm sure you've heard about l loxsey's 'medical jury' publicit y stunt in Dallas over the week end,\" he wrote the science editor of United Press Associations .1 2 As the science l'ditor replied to the AMA , \"Nor do I have to tell you that the Unit ed Press carri ed nothing and won 't.\"13 Oliver Field supplied the media with a damning dossier on the ten doctors . He challe nged their credenti als, pointedly under scoring the fa ct that most did not belong to the AMA or state medical societies. All but two, he noted emphaticall y, were users of the Koch reme dy, and several were associated with the Lincoln treat ment. \"It appear s fair to say that"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"I \"tV I I IL.

It is obvious that if he [Hoxsey] had anyth ing of value in the treatment of cancer , he certainly wouldn' t need to advertise .\"14 Part of Dr. Fishbein' s enduring legacy was a pact with the journalistic prof ession to report exclusively on medical treatment s officiall y appr oved by the AMA. The Journal in 1940 boasted that the United Press wire service at its behest would now \"clear\" any stories on cures and human health with its \"science editor,\" who had an open line to the AMA. 15 Thank s to Dr. Fishbein' s efforts, this legitimat e media concern about en­ dangering the public health was now deepl y ingra ined in the press, but distorted by the AMA's partisan medical- political lens. When Hoxsey did manag e to get on national TV and radio shows, more often than not the AMA had gotten there first. Internal correspon­ dence between the AMA and news organizations revealed carefully scripted programs designed to discredit Hoxs ey, with copious back story supplied by the Bureau of lnve stigation .16 In other cases, the pressure was less subt le. After Hoxsey appeared on a public debate on KCOP-TV in Los Angeles, a member of the AMA legislat ive commi ttee suggested he would speak to friends in Cong ress about having the Federal Communications Commission revoke the stat ion's licens e.17 While the mainstream press was slighting Hoxs ey, he found another TH E OEfENOEK No torious evangelist Winrod takes up Hoxse y's cause with religious fervor. ally who had his own private media kingdom . The notorious Reverend Gerald Winrod was the \"rabble­ rousing publishe r-preacher -radio orator of Wichita, Kansas ,\" as Oliver Field tagged him. 1 8 Head of the Defender s of the Christian Faith, Winrod was a fire-and-brim­ stone fu ndame ntalist preacher whose Defenders had been founded in Kansas by his minister father. Winrod had a large national flock, and beamed his evang elical mes­ sage of apocal ypse and redempt ion throug h a widel y syndicat ed radio show and his popular Th e Defender magaz ine, whose forgotten ar­ chives we unexpectedly unea rthed in Kansas through one of our in­ vestor s in Wichita .19"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Twelve Thous and Patients in Dallas 141 Winrod was a prominent advocate for Hoxsey as well as Drs.

He mollified his sermon of hellfir e with the balm of godly natural healing, and often ended his wind y broadcast s by intoning, \"God bless the quack s, the only quacks who are curing cancer . \" 20 Winrod maintained that the Hoxsey treatment cured him as a child of a horrible neck cancer under the care of a Dr. Rochelle of Wichit a, a friend of Hoxsey' s father. He saw it as nothing less than an act of divine interven­ tion that he was now situated to lift Hoxsey' s righteous bann erY In many ways the granddaddy of moder n televang elism, Winrod was a voluble demag ogue with a tainted past. He had visited Nazi Gerinany in 1934 and returned home to herald its advances . After near ly winning the 193 8 Republican nomination for Kansas governor amid allegations of Ger­ man funding, he was brought up on charges of sedit ion during Wo rld Wa r II for his Nazi associat ions. He evaded the trial when a sympathetic right­ wing congr essman killed the investigation from behind the scenes. 22 An overt racist, anti-C atholic, and anti- Semite dubbed the \"Prairie Pogromist,\" Winrod served as the model fo r Buzz Windrip, the minister of vengeful salvation in Sinclair Lew is's novel It Can 't Happ en Here.23 At the heig ht of the McCarthy era, Winrod was at one with the zeitgeist, proudly publish­ ing \"Senator Joseph McCarthy: A Speech That Will Live \" in Th e Defender magaz ine.24 Not that his credibilit y was ever much of an issue, but The Defender also heralded \"Flying Sauc ers Consi dered Propheticall y. \" 25 Following in the ugly track s of Norman Baker, Winrod was the latest in Hoxsey's rogues' gallery of igno ble partners . Paradoxically, while close to \\Vinr od, Hoxsey continued to consort openly with black and Jewish friends who were aghast at this repellent bed­ fe llow. Hoxsey took comf ort where he found it. Paradoxicall y, the issue of medical freedom of choice united the libertarian wings of both left and right in common cause, a strange de facto alliance that continues to exist today. I have met Hoxsey supporters among left-wing radicals, midd le-American fundamentalists, flower-child hippies, and card-carrying John Birch Society stalwarts. 1ft � ���� I litiMI I D AMERICA'S MOST PERSECUTED PREACHER TO APPEAR HERE ! \"l\\1-o•l \"'' ,,. ,. . ,,., � •·', ,,, ,,, '\"'' · ' '• ,,., I i\"'' ... ...,� .. , .. ,, ll<oJ •MU ... , .o:l �\"\"' •l '• • .. • ,,,,,.,• ·, .,-, ,.:, � t �.·, ,..,. �ol \"·\"'\" •; ! l GOSPEL TAB ERNACLE Il l \\ I'\"\"\" ' '' I \"lo.IOI ' to.,,,.,, '\" ' ''\" ... , ...

Zealously proc laiming the Hoxsey clinic as the \"Medical Mecca fo r cancer sufferers ,\" he paint ed organ ized medicine as an infernal force. 26 When a subsequent FDA inves tigation uncovered Hoxsey making over $80,000 in paym ents to Winrod , Hoxsey weak ly defended them as legiti­ mate donat ions to a relig ious organizat ionY It was not the only media manip ulation Hoxsey attempt ed. After Man s Magazine continued to publish a torrid series of articles promoting Hoxsey cures, the FDA dug up a fistful of\"expense \" checks Hoxsey paid to writer Allen Bernard following his first article. It was war, and Hoxsey obvi ­ ously knew how to fight dirty, too. 2 K The FDA decided it was time to lift its investigative magnify ing glass to the sun to incinerate Hoxs ey. The agency instigated a broad probe into his affairs to put an end to his activiti es by any means necessary . The govern­ ment again cast a national dragnet, discha rging dozens of agents to scour the country to discr edit his alleg ed cures , reviewing a reputed four hun­ dred cases . 29 One agent drove 17,000 miles, knocking on patients' doors, interrogating them, and demanding \"samples\" of their medic ine. \"We were met with almost universal opposition by the Hoxsey patient s whom we visited to obtain samples and labelin g,\" reported an agent in frustrat ion. It was the same pattern of satisfied Hoxsey customers that had stym ied authorities since the 1920s.·10 One such case, reported in a letter from FDA Commis sioner Geor ge Larrick, stemmed from visits by FDA agent Gordy Johnston to three Hoxsey patients. Agent Johnst on soon received a visit from Hoxsey sup­ porter Harold Edwa rds, who \"was abusive, intemperate, prof ane, and threatening. He warned Inspector Johnston that he would get his skull split open with a meat ax, if, as Mr. Edwards put it, he continued his 'rat work under the direction of the rat outfit' he worked fo r.\"31 Another case was James Powe ll, the husband of a Hoxsey patient. Powell was so disturbed by the visit of an FDA agent to his home that he wrote to his Virginia congressi onal representa tive. His wife's healt h was fa iling after a cancer operation, and she was despondent when they decided to go to Hoxsey. \"She began to feel better almost immediat ely, and in one month, an amazing change for the better occurre d. Shortly after returning from our first visit to the Hoxsey Clinic, a representative of the Food and Drug Comm ission [sic] called at my house while I was at work and began asking my wife numerous questions about the treatment and also requested samples of the medicine that was prescri bed for her. The approach and manner in which the represen tative presented himself and the remarks he made to my wife about the clinic upset her so much that it gave her an awful setback. \"32"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"twelve I housand Patients in Dallas 14 3 When the FDA agent was rebuff ed in his second attempt to get a sample of the tonic, he aggressively demanded to buy it.

Go to people' s hous es, talk to them, tell them they were doing wrong, take their medicine. We 'd catch them in the parking areas, writing down number s.\" Despite the govern ment' s oper ations, Hoxsey kept magnet izing sup­ porters. The Man 's Mag azine articles attra cted hundre ds, perhaps thou­ sands, of patients to Dallas. Among them was Verne Halusk a Kielbo wick. As she told the magazine, after six months of vaginal bleed ing, she con­ sulted her family physician, who found a tumor of the cervix and called for an operat ion. Her brother, Pennsylvania State Senator John]. Halusk a, admini strator of the Miners' Hospital, made arrangement s at a Pittsburgh hospit al. The surgeon there decided against a hysterect omy because her condition was so fragile. She received eight treatment s of deep X-ray at the hospital, and thirty more back at the Miners' Hospit al. The radiat ion made her ill, and she returned home too weak to do her housework. When her nephe w picked up a copy of Man 's Mag azine, her brother the senat or decided it was time to take her to Hoxs ey. \"Two week s after I started the treatment, \" Ve rne Haluska Kiel bowick report ed, \"the bleeding halted and I haven' t had any hemorrhages since.

For Hoxsey it was a bit of a homecoming, since Haluska was also a former coal miner and presided over a coal-mining district. The senat or tried to enlist the support of the Miners' Hospit al, which he had ser ved since 1932, to take up the Hoxsey cause at a former nursing home near by.39 The Cambr ia Count y Medical Soci ety issued a surprising statement \"wholehear tedly endor sing\" Haluska's investigation of the AMA \"conspi racy\" against Hoxsey.4 0 The medical societ y joined Haluska in writing Senat or Langer, demanding such an investigation, while preparing to dispat ch a team of physicians to investigate the Hoxsey Clinic in Te xas on Man 's dime .41 The AMA intervened and stopped the doct ors' deleg ation from visit­ ing Dallas, while spurring the Miners' Hospital staff to call for Haluska's"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"1w e1ve 1 nousano ra 1:1e m;s m ua1 1as l\"t !l resig nation.

The senat or invoked his personal tragedy of losing his eig ht-year-old son to cancer and then conf ronting his sister' s looming mortality . To loud applause, he summoned his recovering sister to rise from the galler y.44 Decrying the \"carnage\" of conven tional treatments, Haluska also sig­ naled little Kathy Allison to stand in the galler y. The five-ye ar-old girl suffered from a tumor in her chest, and, after radical surgery and radia­ tion, she was prepar ing to \"meet Jesus and the angels\" when her parents took her to Hoxs ey. Clut ching her giant doll, little Kathy waved bash­ fu lly from the audience, blushing with health thanks to Hoxsey. Swirling with emotion, Halu ska motioned Hoxsey to rise. \"Mr. Presi­ dent, permit me now to introduce to you that great humanit arian, a man who needs a critic like I need a hole in my head; a man devoted to suffer­ ing humanit y; the man who wants to give this treatment to America; the man who has been put in jail because the AMA says he was practicing unorthodox methods .\" Hoxsey basked in the standing ovation from the floor of the State Senate.45 Amid charges he tried to extract a $1 0,000 payoff to bow out of the Miners' l lospital, Haluska resigned in a fury and launched his own Hoxsey Clinic in March 1954, attracting over 7,000 people during a two-day open house.46 Te chni­ l'ally unaffiliat ed with the Dallas head­ quar ters, the clinic hired Dr. Newton Allen, an ordained minister, osteopath, naturopath, and M.D. with experience with cancer who was impressed after a visit to Dallas.

He was licensed in Te xas in 1949 when the practice was legally recog nized. 5° As a naturo­ path, he was fully licensed by the Stat e of Te xas to pract ice. Hoxsey de­ scribed naturopat hy as \"the art and science of treating human ailme nts without the use of coal-tar prepa rations . With roots , herbs, foods, diets, light and water .\"51 By now, the AMA was also waging a full-t hrottl e na­ tional campa ign against naturopat hy hatched at its 195 3 conv ention.

Exasperated with its inabilit y to nail Hoxsey in court, the agency resorted to an obscure federal statute permitting extreme meas ures in a case where there is \"imminent dang er to healt h or gross deception to the consumer. \" Wallace Janssen, an FDA Public Affairs officer, devised the famed \"Public Warning\" against Hoxs ey. Signed by FDA Commissioner George Larrick, it saturated the country initially as a press release in April 1956, and then in January 1957 as a sensational black-an d-red poster tacked in 46,000 post offices across the country and distributed to all the hospi­ tals that agents could reach, along with fa rm, lodg e, and church grou ps.61 When I visited Wallace Janssen in the Kafka esque steel-and -glass hive of FDA headq uarters near Washing ton, D.C., I met a small suspicious man with a neat ly trimmed mustache and bow tie. In a trembling voice he told me that the dire action was justified because Hoxsey was a \"mur ­ derer. \" 62 Proudly he pulled from his fastidio us files the poster of which he was the author:63 Sufferers from cancer , their families, physicians and all concerned with the care of cancer patients are hereb y warned that the Hoxsey treatment for internal cancer has been found by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, on the basis of evidence presented by the Food and Drug Administr ation, to be a worthless treat ment. Its sale represe nts a gross deception to the consumer . The Food and Drug Administration has con­ ducted a thorough and long -contin uing investigation of Hoxsey' s treatment. In addit ion, the National Cancer Institute has reviewed case histories submi tted by Hoxsey and adv ised him that the cases provi ded no scientific evidence that the Hoxsey treatment has any value in the treatment of internal cancer. Those afflic ted with cancer are warned not to be misled by the false promise that the Hoxsey cancer treatment will cure or alle viate their condit ion. Cancer can be cured only through surgery or radiat ion. Death from cancer is inevita ble when cancer patients fail to obtain proper medical treatment because of the lure of a painless cure \"without the use of surge ry, X-ra y, or radium ,\" as claimed by Hoxsey.64 The FDA gloated over its ingenious legal maneuver, as government agents monit oring Hoxsey' s clinic parking lot witnessed a 50 percent decline in patient s.65 Gordon Granger , associate medical director of the FDA, wrote"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Twelve Thous and Patients in Dallas 14 9 to Oliver Field at the AMA , \"I am enclosing for your informat ion, educa­ tion and benefit, a work of art which is soon to be displa yed in every Post Office in the United States.\"66 FDA represent atives visited Oliver Field at AMA headquar ters to relish their victory.67 Several years later, a gratified Wallace Janssen sent a personal memento of the poster with an admiring letter to Dr. Morris Fishbe in.68 Janssen estimated that the warning dis- uaded at least 3,000 people from trying the Hoxsey treatment.69 We were originally scheduled to film with Wallace Janssen, Oliver Field, and the federal prosec utor who tried Hoxsey in Pittsburgh, but just days before the crew was scheduled to leave, I got a drama t ic tele­ gram from Janssen calling it off. He had been in communication with his former colleag ues. \"Regretfull y, I am recommending that you cancel your travel arrangem ents for filming me, since I am not conv inced that the project can be produ ctive of more good than harm. Specificall y, it seems increasing ly clear that to re-publiciz e the Hoxsey cases, which were deci­ sively concluded over thirty years ago, will result in causing some cancer atient s to again seek a tr eatment that was found both wort hless and audulent. The proposed film will inevitably advertise the Mexi can clinic, and this will be irresist ible to some of the man y thousands of people who are fearful about cancer . I do not wish to colla borate in this.\"7 0 After months of distraught negotiations, I was unable to convince Janssen and the federal prosecutor to film with us, but I did finall y prevail on Oliver Field and the FDA's William Grigg, who was familiar with the Hoxsey case although never person ally involved in it. Clea rly, however, the core team behind the \"concerted effort\" was still intact and ever vigilant. Hoxsey was sitting in his office, unaware, when word came that the 'warning was broadcast nationally over the radio .71 He immediat ely made the rounds of local TV and radio stations, and protested to the FDA ·ommissioner against \"this un-A merican persecut ion. It is the apparent obje ctive of your depar tment to give the general public the impr ession hat I am, in the eyes of the government, a crimina l, since most of the )OSters in the post offic es are of wanted criminals .\" He went on to say, \"This is the kind of beha vior I understand stems from behind the Iron nrtain, government officials using their offic e to 'liquidate' an individual. ou stated that you have sent investigators to my clinic.

One patient called me and said, 'May I take it down?' The next one called and said, 'I'm going to get it down .' And then they'd begin calling to tell how they got them down ! Some of them wou ld walk in and be fighting mad and yank it right off the wall with everybody standing there .''76 Gerald Winrod fought back with a massive \"Call to Prayer. \" Broad­ casting on the radio, he reassured his flock, \"I honest ly belie ve that Hoxsey' s survival must be attributed to answered prayer. Millions of Chris­ tians are at this hour interest ed and concer ned that the treatment shall be saved. The power of God must be released, and this can be accomp lished only through prayer. \"77 He launched a drive that landed a whopping two million petit ions on the FDA's door step demanding an investigation of the agen cy. 7H Hoxsey appealed the Public Wa rning in court, but lost.79 The noose was tightening, and James Burke was concer ned. \"They were closing in, and we realized, if we didn' t have a diversion right quick, that it might be closed up soon, and he might go to the penitentiary .\" Burke devised a creat ive distraction. \"At this time there were sixteen candidat es runn ing for governor. One morning I said to Harry-not se­ rious ly-'Y ou up for governor? Yo u're a public figure-everybody knows you. The church people and the black people love you, and the poor people love you. Announce you are going to get in the race and let's take some of this heat off! \"' H 0 Burke saw that Hoxsey was frightened by the prospect of runn ing for office. \"He didn' t want to go fo r that. That scared him a little bit. Re­ member , he was a coal miner and he realized that he wasn 't too well edu­ cated . But then I conv inced him that we're going to be all right. First of all, I cleaned out his of fice desk, took care of all this racehorse parapher ­ nalia, and I put a large picture in back of his desk of Christ on the cross, and pictures of his fa mily, his children, and the babies, and some nice Christian sayings on his desk. \"The next day I called a press conf erence.

I sat down and"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Twelve Thousand Patients in Dallas lSI wrote something, and I took it down to him and said, 'Now Harry, you're going to say exactly what I say.

' Harry asked, 'Caesar? \\Vho is Caesar? ' I said, 'Don't worry about it. It's a metaphor .' 'Metaphor? \\Vhat' s that? ' Anyway, he got the idea.'' Burke's ploy caug ht Hoxsey' s fancy, and the happy warrior embr aced electoral politics with gusto. \"The press appear ed,\" Burke went on, \"and Harr y made his little statement. 'Now,' he says, 'the only way I can keep curing people is I'm going to run for gove rnor and I'm going to win. Then we'll go right on curing people .' The press reacted very well to it, and Harry got carried away with himself . He had more power over an audie nce than any man I ever saw exce pt Chur chill. He could mak e a speech and spellbind an audience, and he had this group spellboun d. He saw that and he ended- 1'11 never forget-h e's a big man, powerful man, and I don' t know whether he did it deliber ately or instin ctively-he stood up before that picture of Christ on the cross, and he says, 'They cruci fied Jesus Christ, didn' t they?' Cameras went off. We went off flying fo r the governorsh ip.'' Hoxsey told the eager press that he was running to \"bring pressure to investiga te the Federal Food and Drug Adminst ration and bust up the monopol y of the American Medical Associat ion. I've run out of patience and everyt hing but mon ey.\" 8 1 \\Vhile Hoxsey' s left-handed run fo r the Te xas gove rnorship was gain­ ing moment um, Burke watched with bemused concern . \"I had no idea that putting Harry up in this race for gove rnor wou ld create such a sensa­ tion, but it did. As time went on, this became a serious matter. It never was serious with me, and I presumed it wasn' t serious with Hoxsey. One day somebody in the press called me and said, 'Look, you've been making a lot of fuss around here . \\Vhat the hell is Hoxsey' s platf orm ?' I hadn' t given that a thought because we didn' t expect to get that far along. I had no idea what to do, so I woke up in the morning, and I had set a press conference where Hoxsey would give his platform . Even the morning of the press conf erence, I didn' t know what to do. It occurred to me that, when I was on General Clay' s staff and the Soviets were pushing to com­ munize Berlin, they came up with Te n Point s of Socialism. I rushed around in my files and I found a copy of this. So I sat down very quick ly, convert­ ing those to Te n Point s of Democrac y for Te xas. \"I brought them down and told Harr y, 'Now, this is your platform. Yo u just follow these ten point s.'

He said, 'A farmer comes into the city of Dallas, and he buys an autom obile. He pays the taxes on it. He buys some gasoline to drive it home. Then he comes back into town with that car and then he parks it, and he puts a nickel in this meter to park it. That ain't right,' he says. 'When I'm governor, I'm going to take those sons of bitches up. Why give it to them people down in the whit e towe rs. That poor farmer, he don' t have to pay a nickel-n ot to drive his car.' The reporter sitting next to me said, 'You know, I'm going to vote for that fellow.'\" As the Hoxsey campaig n snow balled in the Te xas desert, the unortho­ dox candidat e's gambling instincts kicked in. Burke slipped his candidate a fa mous line from Davy Crock ett, about whom the journalist had writ­ ten a popular biog raph y. Hoxse y resurrected Crockett' s pledg e to voters during his run for Congr ess: \"Whatever my opponent promises, I will double .\" When the only serious competitor dropped out of the race, Hoxsey actually had a shot at winning. King maker Burke was edgy about the political monster he had ani­ mated, which was starting to lead an eccentric life of its own . \"It came time to put up or shut up. We had to make a formal register and go through the rites of which party, so I called another press conference and I didn' t say what it was about. This was the moment that Harry had to withd raw. I met with him in the office and I said, 'Harry, now your state­ ment is reall y go ing to be a tearjerker. Yo u're going to tell them that you know you could be governor, but that' s not the place for you, because these poor people dying of cancer deserve all your attent ion.' Say, 'I was guilty of ambition and I don't want to be that way. I want to serve these poor people. I'm going to withd raw.' I saw this shoc ked look on Hoxsey' s face, and he says, 'Jimmy, we can beat them sons of bitches ! We 're going to run. We 're going to beat 'em!' \"I saw Harry had caught the bug too. So I said, 'You dumb ass-;-if you do run and win, I myself am liable to assassinat e you. You can't be gover­ nor of this state .' We called it off. For the rest of his life, I don' t think he ever forgave me for that. Som etimes in the middle of talking about some­ thing, Harr y'd get a faraway look and say, 'Jimmy, we could have beat them sons of bitches ! \" ' For now, Hoxsey had more pressing matters to attend to. The govern­ ment was gearing up for its final campa ign to put him out of business just as the Dallas Hoxsey Clinic was spreading branches into seventeen states. 82 As high as Hoxsey had climbed, it was going to be a long way down ."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"9 Endgame: The Government HLiquidates\" Hoxsey T he gove rnment watched anxiously as it suffered yet a fourth dramatic court upset on the heels ofHoxsey' s high-profile victories against Hear st, Dr. Fishbein, ar.d the FDA. When Hoxsey beat the rap by the Te xas Boar d of Medical Examiners to revoke the licenses of all seven of his clinic doc­ tors, the federal gove rnment played out an endgame that would devolve into a calculated war of techn icalities. \"We have the time and we have the money ,\" stated the confident fed­ eral prose cutor, William Goodrich, going into the clamorous Pittsburgh trial known as the \"Ho xsey Pill Case\" in October 1956.1 Althoug h the haseless charges against Dr. Allen were dropped, matters did not augur well for Hoxsey in Pennsylv ania. The besieged Senator Haluska had just lost his Senate election under heav y lobb ying by the AMA and the J>ennysyl vania state medical society .2 The gover nment prosec ution set out to \"prove\" the wort hlessness of the Hoxsey treat ment once and for all. The Hoxsey forces vainly ob­ jected that such medical matters could not be settled in a courtro om, but only through the legitimate scient ific investigation Hoxsey had now been denied for thirty year s. The Portage Hoxsey Clinic faced off against a firmament of star allo­ pathic physicians well rehearsed to testify to the inefficacy of the internal tonic. All external cases were to be excluded from considerat ion. To p medic al witnesses including NCI chief Dr. J. R. Heller again maintained 1 hat the Hoxsey internal medicines were worthless at best, or might actually acceler ate the cancer.3 The Hoxsey defense retaliated with blist ering at- 1 acks on the destructive effects of surgery and radiat ion, and strutted lloxsey's famed cures before the jury.

The gove rnment unveiled secret evidence gath­ ered during an underground sting operation. The FDA had sent two agents posing as patients into both the Te xas and Penns ylvania clinics. Neither had cancer , yet both testi fied they were diag nosed with the disease. Dr. Harry Spence of Dallas confirmed on the stand that he had examined FDA agent Eucl id Gulledg e prior to his visit to the clinic and found him in perfect health. Gulledg e said that Hoxsey himself examined him and diag nosed prostate cancer .4 The gove rnment also reveled in the recent death of one ofHo xsey' s prize \"cures ,\" little Kathy Allison, who had suc­ cumbed to her cancer after all. Meanwhi le in Te xas, one ofHoxsey' s own doct ors died of cancer after a fa iled trip to the Mayo Brothers Clinic. 5 The credibilit y of Hoxsey' s cures was badly under mined, although he countered with the testimony of two medical doctors reputedly cured of cancer in Dallas, including Dr. Eva Hill of New Zeala nd.6 The trial was thick with skulldug gery. A Dallas physi cian subpoena ed to testi fy about patients who died after taking the Hoxsey treatment had instructed his office to ship the medical records to the hotel where he would be staying. The night he arrived, he laid the records out on his bed next to his briefcase and left for dinner . When he came back, the records were gone. Following his testimony the next day, he returned to his hotel room to find the documents mysteri ously reconstituted on his bed.7 The gover nment again cited Hoxsey' s pamphlet s as fa lse labeling, but this time there was a strange twist. The prosecution focused on the clinic brochure 's fa ithful reproduction of a report critical of surge ry and radia­ tion. The study was originall y published by the Go � ernment Printing Office and Hoxsey reprinted it verbatim from the Congres sional R�cord . H His fa te would ride on this controver sial document. The story behind the gove rnment-issue report was tangled indeed . Dr. Geor ge Miley, director of the Gotham Hospital in New Yo rk, had prev iousl y testi fied before a congress ional commi ttee in 1946 about a survey conducted by his close associate, Dr. Stanle y Riemann of Penns yl­ vani a. Dr. Miley's summar y of the survey revealed that over a long period of time cancer patient s lived longer if they did not receive surge ry, X -ray, and radium treatment s. The study further showed that the use of surger y and radiation did \"mor e harm than good\" to cancer patientsY Benedict FitzGerald quoted it in his report to Congr ess, exact ly as it had been entered into the Congre ssional Record ."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"r:::nagame l!l !l Dr. Riemann subsequ ently changed his tune, protesting that his sur­ vey was never completed or publis hed, and was thus inval id. He said he informed the Senate committee of his objections and was told that his refutation would be published as an addendum. But it never did appear in the Se nate report or anywhere else. 1 0 Under cross-examinat ion in Pittsburgh , Dr. Riemann revealed that, following Dr. Miley's Senate testimon y, he came under attack from the American Cancer Society and other phy sicians who disputed his find­ ings.11 Wa s Dr. Riemann altering his conclusions because of peer pres­ sure and the threat of prof essional censure? An internal FDA memorandum revealed yet another layer of the con­ troversy gleaned from an FDA visit to Dr. Miley in his New Yo rk office. The physician obser ved that surgery was often used when it should not have been, causing the disease to spread. He noted that Dr. Riemann was also concern ed about the presence of extensive X-r ay burns in many can­ cer cases and had wanted the abuse of X-ray therapy brought out at the hearing. 1 2 However, Dr. Mile y conf essed that the attendant publicit y about the disconcerting survey \"caused havoc in the medical prof ession . X-ray phy­ sicians were vexed about it.\" He added that \"Dr. Riemann got hell from the X-ray men.\" It was only then that Dr. Riemann disavowed the study.

I have no regrets because my first object ive as a scientist is to hang on to this theor y of the existence of an anticancer substance in the bodies of all multicellular animals, and all multicellul m- plants, \" a coded reference endorsing Hoxsey' s herbs, after all. 1 9 Dr. Ivy remained philosophical to the end. \"When you come fo rward with a commi ttee opinion to kill a scientific theor y or dest roy scientific observations, you're living in the past, in the dark ages of medicine. It is high time that when something new comes on the horizon which appar ­ ently is go ing to prolong life or alleviate suffering, we should all get to­ gether and work on it to try to decrease the scient ific lag.\"3 0 Following the national television airing of a high-pr ofile special about Dr. Ivy's struggl e, Krebiozen sympat hizer Reve rend Virgil A.

They estimated the costs of the criminal trial alone at over $ 1 million, with a total of$20 million spent by organized medicine to prevent a Krebiozen test over the fifteen-year ordeal. As an Ivy support group wrote, \"There has been displayed in the whole of this sordid transaction a wan­ tonness of addit ional persecution and ruffian-l ike ferocity by the United States attorn ey, rarely incident to the most depr aved and obdurate of our species.

Ivy, Dr. Stefan Durovic, and Dr. William F. P. Phillips. The purpose of this trial was not really to legally convict these great scientists, but to bankrupt them financially and spiritu­ ally.

Dr. Ivy cont inued working through the Ivy Can­ cer Resea rch Foundat ion on Carcalon, as he now called it, supported by wealt hy and prominent allies. Krebiozen disappeared with Dr. Ivy's deat h a decade later in 1977. When Mildr ed Nelson went into exile in Tijuana, Harry Hoxsey stayed in Dallas. As his son told me, \"He was from a different era. He lived three lives in one. By the end he was like a wore-out car. Everything just broke down at once. \"33 After suffering a heart attack in 1958, he was never fully well again.

He probabl y though t, 'Well, it didn' t work with me, but it worked on others . I'm just the unluck y one it didn' t work on.' He was rather bitter at the doctors who operated on him. There was some suspi­ cion in his mind that because he was Harry Hoxs ey, the high priest of quacks in their view, that they delib erately cut a little too much on him. I never belie ved that.\" Then James Burke faced an existential test of fire. \"Coincident ally, I too developed the exact same cancer . With Harry being like a brother to me all these years, I discussed it with him. He kept his counsel to himself . But day after day I'd bring it up and I'd say, 'Harry, what shall I do?' He never once told me to take his pills or his medicine. Final ly, one day I said, 'Harry, they're going to give me a maximum of two years, and I've got to decide. What do you say?' He thought for a long time and said, 'Jimmy, go let them sons of bitches cut it out.'\" Harry Hoxsey then closed the curtain on a Shakespearean fifth act. As Burke recalled, \"After I had my cancer and was cure d, I arranged to have my doctor, who is one of the most famous neurolog ists in the world­ he's called on to go to To kyo, Brazi l-to attend Hoxs ey, and that was Hoxsey's last doctor of recor d. Dr. Paul Peters told me that Hoxsey was free of cancer . But Hoxsey had a weak heart and he was an aging man, and he coul dn't last very long. I pinned my doctor down, and he said it was liver trouble and a weak hear t. He stated over and over that Hoxsey was free of cancer , and this man came to his house and treated him about every other day. \"Ho xsey died when this doctor was away, \" Burke contin ued. \"He could not be called to sign the death certificate.

One thing is certain from my viewp oint: He did make people well from cancer .\" Burke pause d, sighe d, and recalled a rueful exchange he shared with his dying friend. \"On his deathbed, I went to see him every other day or sometimes twice a day, and we'd talk about old friends and old times and good times and bad times. Harry would sudd enly get a fa raway look in his eye and he'd say 'J immy, we could have beat them sons of bitches ! \" ' As we filmed this poig nant remember ance with James Burke, his wife, Angela, joined us. A stately, silver-haired woman in an azure dress, she too had a story . 36 \"I first met Harry in May in 195 5. My husband and our three-year-old son and I were retur ning from living in Germ any for man y year s.

In 1985 I set off fo r Washing ton, D.C., to meet with J ames Duke, Ph.D., a renow ned botanist and author of twenty book s and over two hundred scientific articles.4 He has devoted his prof essional life to the study of phar maco gnosy , the branch of pharmacy that develops medi­ cines from natural sources. At the time, Dr. Duk e worked for the U.S. Depar tment of Agriculture (USDA), where he founded a world-class da­ tabase on plant medicine. He also collab orated fo r many years with the Nati onal Cancer Institute as part of a modest gove rnment program for drug discovery from natural product s including plants. Along with a small handful of other botanical explorers , Duk e helped lead the way to plant medicines that have produced pharma ceutical drugs such as the cancer drug Ta xol from the Pacific yew tree.

AL Ut\"II 'IIUN I sent Duk e the revised list of Hoxsey herbs published in the 1950s, which Mildred Nelson ostensibl y continued to use. Duk e decided to tap not only his own extensive USDA database, but also NAPRALER T, the Natural Produ cts Alert comput er database at the Univer sity of Illinois in Chicago. Founded by Dr. Norman Farnsworth , a glob ally revered phar ­ macog nosist, NAPRALER T gathers data from scientific and medical stud­ ies all over the world on plant s and other natural substances, and collates them into a comprehensive, centralized information source . It can sort the data into multiple categories of chemical proper ties and biological activities, a task ideally suited to computers work ing with gargant uan volumes of information .6 When I arrived at USDA headqua rters in Beltsville, Mary land, Duk e shuttled me to his near by Herbal Vineyard, the small farm where he lives. A tall, gentlemanly figure spor ting a trim goate e, he spoke in gentl e, south­ ern tones with understated authorit y. Guiding me around the lush Easter n deciduous forest, he delig hted in pointing out a number of Hoxsey' s \"her­ baceous weeds\" growing in his own backy ard. We inspected red clover, burdock, prickly ash, barbe rry, poke, and buckt horn, as well as bloodroot, the herb in one of the Hoxsey external formulas. Duk e noted that all the Hoxsey herbs have a long empirical tradition of Native American usage for cancer , several stretching back as far as three thous and years . Some of the herbs such as red clover and burdock, which were introduced to North America from Europe during the 1700s, were immediat ely adopted by the Indians. Duk e's first concern about the tonic was its safety, and he quickly pointed out that only one of the herbs, poke root, might be dang erous. A common plant through out the Southeast, poke is a well-k nown herb and food to local residents, who like to parboil the leaves and add them to salads. The root, berry, and leaf are toxic in larger quantit ies. The amount in the Hoxsey tonic, however , is well below any threshold of dang er. [Warning: Do not even consider self-m edicatin g with poke. Eating the leaves can also be toxic without proper prepara tion.] Back in Duke' s study, stacked high with books, papers, and over sized reference works, he lifted a hefty three-pound volume called simply Plants Used Against Cancer. The encyclopedic tome was authored by Jonat han Hart well, a chemist and virtual founder of the National Cancer Instit ute who went on to become an assistant chief of the NCI' s new Cancer Che­ mother apy National Service Center and head of the natural product s sec­ tion of the NCI' s Drug Resear ch and Development Program. Hartwell spent many years compiling a comprehens ive cross -reference of infor­ mation on the global folkloric traditions of anticancer plants. \"The his-"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Tempest in a To nic Bottle 177 tory of the herbal treatment of cancer ,\" he wrote, is synonymous with \"the history of medicine, indeed of civilization .\"7 Cove ring more than three thousand species, Hartw ell's compilat ion listed all the Hoxsey herbs. They ranged from having three to over thirty citations each-a very im­ pressi ve score, Duke noted. R A number of the plants, Duk e pointed out, contained chemical com­ pounds \"of consider able interest\" to the NCI. \"At least three of the herbs­ barberr y, cascara sagrada , and buckthorn- contain compounds that have been studied by the Cancer Instit ute as effective in some turr10r systems, though not studied in humans. So there are certainly biolog ically active compounds in these spec ies.\" · The data Duk e provi ded were sorted into several categories that indi­ cate both the nature of the tests performed and their relevance to possible anticancer activities. One grouping was for antioxid ants, which protect cells of the body against precance rous damage. Another was for antimut agenic propert ies, which shield against cellular mutations that can lead directly to cancer . A third was cytotoxic activity , which is a toxic action that can kill any cells, but is particularly effective at killing cancer cells since they are more sensi tive by virtue of dividing so quick ly. Another class of activity was antimicrobial (a ntiseptic ), consisting of both antibacteri al and antiviral activi ty. Antibacterial properti es are considered indicat ive of potential an­ titumor activit y, while antivi ral activity is important because some cancers are now belie ved to be caused by viruses (as Hoxsey asserted in the late 1950s). Dr. Duke ultimat ely wrote a short article based on his Hoxsey re­ search, published in 1988 in Herba/Gram, the peer -reviewed journal of the respected American Botanical Counc il.9 Eight of the nine herbs in the internal tonic showed antitumor activity in controlled labor atory ani­ mal tests. Five showed antioxi dant properties as protectants against can­ cer. All showed antimicr obial properties with activit y against viral or bacteri al infections . Duke' s assessment was that the Hoxsey internal tonic ingredients showed very significant chemical and biolog ical anticancer activity. The fo rmulation might or might not actually work, but in princi ple it defi­ nitely merited serious investi gation .* *For reader s interested in further techn ical aspects of the botanical information presented in this chapter , as well as a list of citations and sources of addit ional data, see the appendix along with the endnotes.

I con­ sulted again with Duke as well as with several other resear chers who have conducted independent investigations into Hoxsey in what turned into a medical detective story. One of these was Fr ancis Brinker, a naturop athic physician and scholar of botanical medic ine who made his own visit to the Bio Medical Center in 1983. Brinker subsequen tly published a defini tive article in the Joumal of Naturopathic Medicine conta ining surpr ising conclu­ sions about the Hoxsey tonic. 1 0 Anot her was Patricia Spain Wa rd, Ph.D., an esteemed medical histo­ rian who prepared a contract report on Hoxsey fo r the federal Office of Te chnology Assessment, the fo rmer research arm of Congr ess.

Before looking at these herbs, however, it is necessar y to probe the mystery surro unding the secrecy of Hoxsey' s formula.

Even then, such commercial interests remain evasive, like Coca-Cola and its fa mous secret formula. Because Hoxsey' s herbal remedies were not patent able, he had reason to be cautious. Perhaps Hoxsey fe lt, as Winst on Churchill once remark ed, that the truth was so valuable that it had to be protected \"by a bodyguard oflies.\" The MacG uffin might still be in play, after all.

After attending the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Port land, Oreg on, his fascinat ion with the rich heritage of the Eclectic physicians of the nineteenth cen­ ( u ry set him on an in tensive review of their botanical remedies where he would eventually make a puzzling discover y about the Hoxsey tonic. The name Eclectic originated with a group of doct ors devoted to clinical research and the use of herbal prepar ations in treating disease. \"l' hcy flourished in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuri es, and"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"between 1826 and 1939 had a string of medical schools that taught so­ phisticated methods of botanical prescribing, the main stay of therapeu­ tics of that era. Their work represented the apex of plant medic ine in the United States and persists as a rich reservoir of pract ical knowledge, some of which has yet to be equaled .1\" \"The Eclectics were able to differentiate well the ac tivities of various plant s,\" the erudite researcher notes. \"But most important ly, they were effective clinical obser vers. They could tell what worked and what didn 't. Even though their results were positive, their explanat ions were very of­ ten wrong, based on the limit ations and underst anding of medicine and science at that time. They had an empirical approach to medicine in which it's clinical result s that one looks for, not the absolute guarantee of under­ standing the process involve d. They were willing to use anyt hing that work ed. In fact, conven tional medicine eventually incorporated that phi­ losophy of Ecle cticism using clinical result s and obser vations, which to­ day are established through contr olled, double-blind studie s.\"17 In researching the Hoxsey formula, Brinker found that it bore a strik­ ing simila rity to an old red clover-b ased Eclectic formula. He traced the origins of the Tr ifolium (red clover) extract back to the ninet eenth cen­ tury, when Parke, Davis, and Co. produced a Syrup Tr ifolium Compound approximating the moder n Hoxsey formulas, except that in 1890 it did not contain buckthorn or licorice . \"Several decades later ,\" Brinker noted, \"in advertisement s appearing in medical journals, Parke, Davis, and Co. identified the Syrup Tr ifolium Compound as a long-established success prescri bed in every civilized country in the world .\"1H Credited to an ob­ scure Dr. Rush, about whom nothing more is known , the formula was also described in an official American Phar maceuti cal Association listing of drugs called the Na tional Formulary in 1926 and 1936. Ye t another Extract of Tr ifolium Compound was listed in the 1898 King's American Dispensatory, the preeminent compilation of medic ines used by Eclect ic doctors . Produced by the W S. Merrell Co. of Cincinnat i, it was celebrated for \"the alterative, tonic, and elimi native properties of the recently expr essed juices of extracts from fresh or green plant s with potas­ sium iodid e.\"lt was prescr ibed for sy philis, scrofula, rheumatism, and glan­ dular and skin conditions. This \"Compound Fluidextract of Tr ifolium\" cont ained all the Hoxsey ingredients except buckt horn, and also had may­ apple root, Podophyllum peltatum. 19 However, Brinker adds, there is no evi­ dence that anyone ever applied the Tr ifolium compound to cancer before Hoxsey did, an innovation for which Brinker gives him formidable credit. Why might Hoxsey apply it to cancer? Brinker point s out that the Tr ifolium compound was essential to the very fabric of the Eclectic and"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"lt:llq.J t:;)l. Ill 4 IUIIIf. CVl.l.lt: 101 naturopathic view of disease. It was used for its tonic, alterativ e, and elimi­ native propert ies. He explains these important concept s. \"Tonics, often bitter, were emplo yed to increase the appet ite and en­ hance the processes of digestion and assimila tion. They improved the qualit y of the blood and the nutrition of the ent ire system. ''Alteratives, known in fo lk medicine as 'blood cleanser s,' were seen as assisting organs that remove metabolic waste and toxins from the circula­ tion. Alteratives were believed to impr ove the qualit y of the blood by assisting digestion, impr oving circulation, and accelerating the processes of elimination, thereby correcting faulty metab olism. The knowledg e concerning their action was wholly empirical. Healt h was seen as a prod­ uct of the qualit y of the blood, since the blood bring s nour ishment to tissues and cells and must remo ve the cellular waste .\" In the Eclectic view, an alt erative favorably alters the course of an illness. It is used for chronic conditions in small amo unts over prolonged periods. Dr. Durkee explic­ itly characterized the tonic as an alterative. The eliminative function is also essent ial. \"Clea nsing the blood ,\" Brinker conti nues, \"occurs as it is filtered through the organs which ex­ crete cellular waste produ cts. When these organs of eliminat ion do not function adequatel y, it becomes increasing ly difficult to maintain a healthy ecolog y of the cells. This makes them more suscept ible to carcinogens .2 0 \"Attempting to enhance eliminat ion and immune function can be done by utilizing a variet y of methods and agents including herbs ,\" Brinker observ es. \"This model for the action of alterat ives was practi cally applied by the late-ninet eenth-cent ury Eclectic prescriber s in the treatment of chronic and cancer ous condit ions. Such was their success that the alter ­ atives were considered to have been among the most useful medicines in Eclectic thera peut ics.\" The Hoxsey formula's real purpose was not to kill cancer cells di­ rectly. Rather, it was to creat e an overall terrain unfavorable to the growth of cancer cells. Simult aneously its effect was the enhancement of the body' s own immune response and capacit y to elimi nate toxins. From these per­ spectives , the Hoxsey tonic is a credible appr oach. Independent scientific resear ch has validated certain effects of the Hoxsey herbs on overall physiological function. \"The tonic and alterative claims by Eclectics have been relatively substantiat ed,\" Brinker confirms .21 There is addit ional evidence that the tonic does also have a direct cytotoxic (cancer-k illing ) activi ty, according to Brinker. \"All of the plants of the Hoxsey tonic or certain of their active constit uent s have shown some degree of antit umor activity in human cancer cell-cult ure labora­ tory studies or in living animal systems.

He culled his own private plant data­ base, one of the most extensive in the world (Duke retired from the USDA in 1997), and dug up even more contemporar y evidence of compelling anticancer properties in the Hoxse y tonic herbsY Several are of speci al interest. Duk e as well as the other researcher s were pa rticula rly enthus i­ astic about recent discov eries concerning red clover, burdock root, and poke root. RED CLO VER Red clover blossoms, Tr ifolium pratense, which are proporti onall y one of the la rgest ingredi ents in the tonic, \"sho w up in all the 'quack' remedies ,\" Duk e told me.24 Hist orically red clover blossoms have been used as a folk cancer remedy both inter nally as a \"blood purifier\" and exter nally as a plaster. But, he added, \"now it turns out that it contains genist ein, the same estrogen ic isofla vone fo r which the soybean has been getting all the press lately. It also contains three other compounds which are estrog enic [mimic natural hormones] . I suspect those four are synergistic at pre­ venting or slowing the development of cancer .\" These component s have all been documented to produce anticancer effectsY Duk e further underscored the fa ct that these compounds are espe­ cially notable in light of recent findi ngs about tumor growth . They are antiangiogenic, meaning that they prevent the fo rmation of new blood vessels, thereby cutting off the abilit y of a tumor to grow. Red clover contains man y biologicall y active compounds, including phytoestrogens, plant compounds with hormonal estrog enic effects. These plant hormones may be responsible fo r the low incidence of breast and other female reproduct ive cancers among women in Japan, where soy­ bean products are regularly consumed .U• Further resear ch continues to confirm that consumption of soy as a dietary source of these phytoestrogens is associated with a lowered risk ofleukemia as well as cancer s of the breast, lung, and prosta teY Among 150 herbs tested for such hormone activi ty, the top six included Hoxsey' s red clover and licorice, along with soy.2H Science News in May 1990 reported that a compound was di scove red in soyb eans that resembles the conven tional cancer drug Ta moxifen.

The recent flurry of excitement around tests of the synthetic drug Ta moxif en, claiming it can prevent breast cancer in up to 50 percent of women, downpl ays the fact that it also can produce serious \"side eff ects\" such as uterine cancer and fatal blood clots.3 0 The compounds in red clover, says Duke, are a much safer natural alterna tive to this toxic synthetic drug. This angiogenic direction in cancer resear ch has gained some cur­ rency in recent years, and became the object of a media fe eding frenzy in May 1998 around the research of Dr. Judah Folk man. Celebr ated on the front page of the Sunday New Ytwk Times as a potent ially moment ous cancer break through , two new drugs devised by Dr. Folkman were de­ signed to utilize angiogenesis in preven ting tumor growth by cutting off the blood supply that fe eds cancer ous tumors. Jl Subsequent resear ch has confirmed Dr. Folkman' s experiments, and several angiogenesis inhibi­ tors are now being tested for tumor suppressio n in clinical trials.12 These new directions in cancer research, Jim Duke says, \"make the Hoxsey for­ mula seem even more cred ible.\" Duk e addit ionall y point s out that red clover's fo lk tradition against cancer was strongly cited in Hartwel l's Plants Used Ag ainst Cancer, as well as in the foundational herbal book Back to Eden by Jethro Kloss, who devoted many pages to its anticancer properties. Duk e also names it ex­ tensively in his own scholar ly work, CRC Handbook of Medicinal He1'b s.H Francis Brinker adds that the Eclectics prized red clover as an excel­ lent alterative. \"It was said unquestionably to retard the growth of cancer when administ ered internally for a prolonged period and was given freely to those with a tendenc y toward getting cancer .\"34 BURDOCK ROOT Duke cons iders burdock, Arctium lappa, an especiall y disting uished Hoxsey ingredient fo r its strong immune- boost ing propert ies.

The re­ searchers first included the plant in the project because of its histor y as a folk remed y for new growths and ulcerations .36 Another test dem onstrated how burdock inhibit s tumor growth .37 A Japanese study discovered a new substance in burdock uniquely capable of reducing mutageni city. \"So important is this new prope rty that these scientists named it the 'B-fac­ tor,' for 'burdock fa ctor, \" ' Ward report ed.3 8 Herbalist s often recommend burdock as a blood purifier and alter­ ative, and it is also famous for its inclusion in another herbal combination for cancer called Essiac. A formula widely used in Canada and the United States, Essiac originated in Canada in the 1930 s with founder Rene Caisse (Essiac is Caisse spelled backwa rds), a nurse who attributed the fo rmula to Ojibwa Indians as a traditional cancer remedy .39 It is notable when the same plant recurs in independent fo rmulas. POKE ROO T Duk e belie ves that poke root, Phytolacca americana, is another star in the Hoxsey tonic and he underscores its folk tradition. Poke roots , leaves, and berr ies, all of which can be poisonous, have long been used as anti­ cancer remedi es. Indians used the powdered root for cancer and early settlers applied the berry juice to skin cancer s. Tr aditionall y the juice was belie ved to alleviate cancer . As an ointment or decoct ion, the root as well as the leaf have long been used to treat cancer and tumors. Poke was widely celebr ated by the early Eclectics for its anticancer proper ties. After forty years of use, Eli Jones, a famous Eclectic physician whom science writer Ralph Moss has called \"one of the founders of mod­ ern oncolog y, \" considered poke the most valuable general remedy avail­ able for treating cancer .4 0 Among it s common names was cancer root. Poke hit the headlines in 1998 when Antimicrobial A g ents and Chemo­ therapy, the official journal of the American Soci ety for Micr obiolog y, published a study about a promising new drug that eradic ates HIV infec­ tion (AIDS) in mice .41 The new agent contains a potent antiviral protein from the pokeweed plant and was found to be 100 to 1,000 times more active than any other anti-HI V agent produced to date. The new medi­ cation works like a magic bullet, delivering the plant-d erived inhibit or select ively to AIDS-infected cells. The mice in the study were cured of human AIDS without side effects.

Barberry conta ins a wealth of anticancer , antitumor , antioxidant, and mutat ion- prev enting com­ pounds, as well as cancer -preventive properties .4(, Native Americans used the plant to cleanse the blood, among many other uses . Duke emphasizes that prickly ash bark, Zanthoxylum americanum or Z. clava herculis, contains some of the same alkaloid compounds found in barberr y, and he consid ers it another leading agent in the formula. Be­ cause the quantities in the tonic are relat ively small, however, its possible effect should not be overs tatedY BUCKTHOR N BARK, CASCARA SAGRADA, STILLINGIA ROOT, AND LICORICE ROOT The rest of the Hoxsey herbs have all shown meaningful anticancer activity as well. Buckthorn bark, Rhamnus frangula, has traditionally been used for internal cancers.48 It has long been a remedy for cleansing the blood, liver disorders, and constipation. It contains aloe-emodin, a laxative compound that has shown activity in animal tests against several tumor systems includ­ ing leukemia.49 Ward identified a study that isolates an antileukemic prin­ ciple from buckthorn. This discovery prompted the scientists to recommend retesting other similar laxative plant component s fo r antitumor activi ty. 5 0 Cascar a sagrada bark, Rhamnus purshiana, contains the same aloe­ emodins as buckthorn in twice the amount. 51 It has traditionall y been used as a purgative , laxat ive, tonic, and liver medicine.

A German physician who emig rated to the United States, he achie ved dramatic results against cancer and other conditions using a rigorous diet of natural foods, fresh juices, liver injections , and coffee enemas. He was celebrated by Nobel laureate Dr. Albert Schweitzer as \"one of the most eminent medical geniuses in the history of medici ne.\"67 Dr. Gerson believed that potassium iodide corrected impor tant bodily defiencies and enhanced metabo lism, which in turn retarded and inhib­ ited tumor growth .6H Other physicians in the 1940s and 1950s experimented with potas­ sium iodide fo r cancer with demonst rable result s. Dr. Kleiner , a profes­ sor of biochemist ry at the New Yo rk Medical College, and Dr. M. M. Black of the Brooklyn Cancer Instit ute treated advanced-cancer patient s with K1 with encouraging result s.69 An interesting contemporary footnote is that U.S. public healt h offi­ cials dispensed potassium iodide pills to nearby resident s after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. The subst ance is belie ved to block ionizing radiat ion from damag ing the thyroid gland. The FDA itself distributed Kl liquid to the popul ation around Three Mile Island.

Are we going to have to prove all thousand of them safe and efficacio us?\" The National Cancer Institute did perform labor atory tests on all the Hoxsey herbs using cancer cell lines in petri dishes. Almost all the results were negative, contrary to other data presented here. 71 Most of these test­ ing methodologies have since been abandoned because they are unreliable, and many scientist s find that the outcomes do not match actual results with human subjects. Both Duk e and Brinker are not fazed by the preponderant fa ilure of the Hoxsey herbs to show anticancer activity in the NCI screens because these experiments have been desig ned for one very narrow band of activity: the cytotoxic capabilit y to ki ll cancer cells direct ly in a dish. \"If it were tested against cell cultures and the tests came up neg ative, I wo uldn' t be surprised or bother ed,\" Brinker states . \"That's not what I'm expecting or looking for from that herb.\" While some of the plants may directly kill cancer cells to some degre e, most work by indirectly interfering with ma­ lignant cell growth through other mechanisms. Duke, who worked closel y with the NCI, is critical of its prot ocols. \"One of the major problems with the NCI screen is that they do not test the plant s in the way humans use the plants. I don' t know that they have ever given an oral extra ct of red clover to a human being, and that' s how it's used in fo lklore .

In 1990 Dr. Early gave the leftover tonic to Dr. David Ho, a senior research associat e in the Ohio Stat e Univer sity College of Pharmac y, who tested it against cell lines for five types of canc er. \"Sur­ prisi ngly the mixt ure was active against all five of the lines ,\" Dr. Early wrote . Dr. Ho verified the result s by repeat testingY The overall evidence is that the Hoxsey tonic is a biolog ic4lly active substance whose component s have individuall y shown signif icant immunomodulating, anticancer , and antitumor propert ies. \"You can make an educated guess,\" suggests Dennis McKenna from behind the thick glasses through which he daily pores over reams of scienti fic data, \"that, yes, there is some potential here fo r anticancer act ivity.

One admit tedly preliminar y review of Hoxsey patients did take place beginning in 1984 by a contemporar y naturopathic doctor, Steve Austin of Oregon . The study tracked a small sampling of cancer patients from the Pacific Northw est over a five-y ear period who went to three Tijuana alternative cancer clinic s offering, respe ctive ly, Hoxsey, Gerson, and la­ etrile (the extract of apricot pits)/1 Published in the Joumal of Na turopathic Medic ine, the review found that six of sixteen Hoxsey patients survived for five years and were disease­ free. These survivors included two cases of melanoma and two of lung cancer. In each categor y, one was very adva nced, and both types of cancer are often fatal. There were no survivors from the other two therap ies. Dr. Austin was entirely forthright in ackno wledging the severe limit ations of the modest study. \"Our Hoxsey results are uncertain due to the prelimi­ nary nature of our investigat ion. Neverth eless, we note that several long­ term survivors had very poor initial prognoses.

The excitement, upon closer examination, boiled down to labor atory tests showing only modest result s on mice. It is well known that mouse systems often do not trans late to human being s, and the NCI itself abandoned the mouse screening test several year s ago. Nor was consid eration paid to possible side effects. Given the well- documented antiang iogenic properties of Hoxsey' s red clover and licorice, why has there not been comparable attention paid to these and other plant s? Is a difference of medical philosoph y creating a double standar d for resear ch?

Doctors sanctioned only surgery and radiation as effective treatments, both being localized appr oaches reflecting their belief that tumors were independent growths on an other wise healt hy organi sm. After decades of taking the position that \"there is no known liquid medicine which cures internal cancer ,\" orthodoxy acknowl edged a systemic approach with the development of chemo therapy drugs in the 1950s.1 Even then, the exclu­ sive orientation was to kill cancer cells by using strong poisons . To the contra ry, Hoxsey and the lineag e of natural medicine he es­ poused characterized cancer as a systemic illness . He descr ibed it as a \"sys­ temic disease which occurs only in the presence of a profound physiologic chang e in the cons tituent s of body fluids and a consequent chemical im­ balance of the organism . Its real cause must be sought in the basic body chemist ry and cell metabolism. We belie ve that the organ ism's attempt to adapt itself to the new and abnormal environment causes certain muta­ tions in newly born cells of the body. Eventuall y a viciously competent cell evolves which finds the new enviro nment eminently suitable to survival and rapid self-reproduct ion. These cells are what are known as cancer .\"2 Hoxsey belie ved that a syste mic approach could remedy the imbal­ ance. \"It fo llows that if the constitution of the body fluids can be normal­ ized and the original chemical balance in the body restor ed, the environ­ ment again will become unfavorable fo r the survival and reproduction of these cells. They will cease to multipl y and event ually they wi ll die. Then if vital organs have not been too seriousl y damag ed by the malig nancy (or by surger y or irradiation) , the entire organism will recover to normal health. We attempt to get at the roots of the disorder , rather than deal merely with its end result. Our primary effort is to restore the body to physiological normalc y.\"·1 191"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Hoxsey called his approach \"nontoxic chemot herapy\" and, like the Eclect ics, saw the internal tonic serving several functions: to stimulate the eliminat ion of toxins poisoning the sy stem; to correct abnormal blood chemist ry; and to normalize cell metabo lism. In essence, he propos ed, the tonic alters the metabolic terrain to di scourage the cancer' s growth . \"In assessing the potenti al value of the Hoxsey formula in cancer treat­ ment s,\" naturopath Francis Brink er observes, \"the current conventi onal scientific method has been to look at its component plants individually or their isolat ed constit uent s in regard to cytotoxic or antitumor activity. While this may or may not help establish some degree of justificat ion, it does not address the intended purpose of using the formula as a means of normaliz ing physiologic processes and thereby assisting the body in its own control of cance rous growth .\" Rather than specifica lly aiming to kill the canc er, Hoxsey delib erately sought to support the body' s abilit y to cure itself . The Hoxsey herbs do in fact present a strong profile fo r precisel y th at activit y. The tonic is also harmless . Unlik e toxic chemot herapy drugs, the worst it will do is noth­ ing. The seminal Greek physician Hipp ocrates, whose famous Hippo­ cratic Oath doct ors take, is well known for his primar y princi ple: \"First do not harm.\" Clearly the Hoxsey tonic honors this credo. Hipp ocrates' s seco nd, less quoted principle was to \"revere the healing force of nature.\" This precept is at the heart of the Hoxse y tonic as well as virtually all the other unconventional cancer treatments. It hear kens back to a long-st anding concept known as vis medicatrix naturae, the heal­ ing force of nature, which was cent ral to Hoxsey' s medical philosoph y. He exalted the abilit y of nature to heal and the capacit y of the body to right itself when given proper support. This medical philosophy originat es from a cent uries-old tradition prominent in the United States in the 1800s and early 1900s among \"ir­ regular\" physicians. The irregulars were represented by diverse schools including the Eclectics, Physiomedicali sts, homeopaths, and the naturo­ pathic prof ession, which evolved in stages from all these approaches. The renowned turn -of-the-cent ury Eclectic physician Eli Jones stated, \"The Eclectic school of medicine was the pioneer in the successful treatment of cancer by internal medi cation. By my method of treating cancer as a blood or constit utional disease (as I was taught in the Eclectic colleg e over forty years ago), I have cured 80 percent of the cases of cancer which have come under my treatment. I hones tly believe, from my own experi­ ence, that 95 percent of the cases of cancer in our countr y could be cured by medicine if treated before any operation or the use ofX-ray .\"4"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"nu xse y s cct ecttc '\"'ppr oacn to �ancer 19 3 \\Vhatever the real origin of the Hoxsey medicines, they mirrored this empirical Eclectic tradition. Followi ng their reputed discovery by a horse , Hoxsey consistently claimed his father added other ingredients from popu­ lar home remedies of the day. Potassium iodide would likely have been among them, given its empirical veteri nary tradition. Because 1840 Illi­ nois was also Indian country at the western frontier of the nation, John Hoxsey most likely had contact with Native American healers who used herbs extensively and maintained wide-r anging continental trade routes that brought remote plant s into general circulation. The nonlocal herbs would have been familiar because th e region was also a hotbed of irregular medical pract ice.5 There were major Eclectic and Physiomedical medical schools in Cincinnat i as well as in Illinois, Indiana, and throughout the Midwest and Southeast. The most popular form of American folk medicine, called Thompson ianism, was rooted in indig enous American herbs since importing medicines from the East Coast or Europe was too expens ive. These various tradi tions converged to be­ come a re-indigenized, botanicall y based medi­ cine naturalized to North America. 6 Epit omizing the tra­ dition of empiricism, the Eclectic school deve loped essentially a native mate­ ria medica of indig enous American plants. The parallel school of Physio­ medicali sts eschewed chemical medicines of any kind along with toxic herbs, relyi ng solel y on \"nature' s medicines .\" Brinker concludes that \"it made eminent good sense for a veteri narian or a doctor in the Midwest in the mid-nin eteenth cen­ tury to rely upon the lo­ cal plant s as medic ine.\" Hoxsey' s herbs and latter WROLl!3 S.A:L:m & :a:.elf!' .AIL 'l'HOMSO.NIAN BOTA NIC ME D I C IN E STO RE .

It incorporated the rich new discov­ eries of indig enous plant s and Native knowl edge with existing European traditions. 7 The Hoxsey herbs were also listed in the Na tional Fonnulary, which originated around 1888 in response to the mounting exclusion of man y botanical fo rmulas from the United States Pbarmacopoeia (U.S.P), the offi­ cial listing of the American Phar maceutical Association . Even though the rise of the synthetic-drug indust ry began to displace many traditional plant medicines, both the Na tional Formulary and the U.S.P. still con­ tained a preponderance of botanical remedies well into the twentieth cen­ tury. Their continued inclusion indi cated not only their popular ity but also their probable efficacy. Apart from the herbs themsel ves, the speci al prepa ration of the tonic also owes much to naturopathic tradition. The tonic contains no alcohol, and no alcohol is used to mak e it, a fact that Mildred belie ves to be of primar y import ance. The herbs are infused or boiled in water to obtain extracts . Hoxsey was the first to concoct the formula strict ly as a water extract, which is an old naturopathic pract ice. (Like Harry Hoxsey, Mildred Nelson has never fully revealed the precise method of making the tonic. She compar es it to mixing paints, where the outcome depends on the precise order and sequen ce.)H The twentieth-c entury naturopathic move ment in which Hoxsey par­ ticipated grew directly out of this Eclectic lineag e. Originall y called \"drugless healing, \" naturopat hy emphasized cleansing and det oxifying the body as the currency of good healt h. It added botanical medicine to its reper toire of nutri tion, hydrothera py, and other nature-based prac­ tices . The naturopaths relied exclusively on medicines from natural sources rather than on synthetic phar maceutic als.'� The influent ial natur opat h Dr. John Bast yr, after whom Seattle's naturopathic Bastyr Univer sity is named, agreed with Eli Jones about treating cancer systemical ly, and utilized Jones' s seminal work, Cancer: Its Causes, Sy mptoms and Tr eatment s (191 1). As medical knowledg e has pro­ gress ed, the Eclect ics and naturopaths have proved to be ahead of their time in recog nizing cancer as a systemic or constit utional disease, which it is today known to be. Hoxsey himself obtained a diploma from the Sout hwest Colleg e of Naturopat hy, and his physicians, particularly Dr. Durkee, were quite fa ­ miliar with the empirical and Eclectic traditions. In the 1949 trial against Hear st, Hoxse y made a strong case that all his remedies were listed in the homeopathic pharmacopoe ia. Dr .

There is no definit ive explanat ion or ra­ tional understan ding at this point as to why and how these thing s work togeth er to do what they can do. However, desp ite a very Hmited nine­ teent h-century knowledge of healt h and disease from a scientific stance, the empir icists obtained many positive result s and were exce ptional clini­ cal obser vers unbound by philosophical strictur es. Ironical ly, their very prag matism of using what ever worked was later largely incorporated by orthodox medicine, if scient ificall y validated. For their day and age, the Eclectics were well in advance of convent ional practi ce.\" Even today , botany endures as the cornerstone of pharmac y. About 25 percent of prescription drugs contain at least one plant constit uent, and anot her 25 percent are modeled on plant s. Fully 40 percent of moder n pharmaceut icals are directly derived from either plants or other natural product s.12 The heart medicine digitalis comes from foxglove, suppos­ edly given to Dr. William Wi thering in 1775 by a Gypsy. Aspirin origi­ nated from willow bark, and to this day its action is not compl etely un­ derst ood, thoug h its efficacy is accept ed. Quinine, a drug used against the scourge of malaria, came from a South American tree bark. The popp y flower yielded the painkiller morphine, and the Bayer cor poration named its potent derivative \"heroin\" for its \"heroic\" anest hetic effects. The list of plant-based drugs is long and illustrious. In fact, a high number of standard cancer chemot herapy drugs origi­ nate from plant s. Vinc ristine and Vinblast ine, used fo r acute childhood leukemia and Hodg kin's disease, are derived from the Madag ascar peri­ winkle flower, Vinca 1·osea . The Pacific yew tree has yielded Ta xol, whose sales are now approaching $1 billion. Etoposi de, the chemotherapy dr ug of choice fo r testicular cancer , small-cell lung cancer , nonly mphoc ytic leukemias, and non-Hodgkin' s lymphoma, comes from the may apple, Podophyllum peltatum, an old Native American anticancer plant. It too was listed in the Extra ct Tr ifolium Compound .u About 30 percent of anticancer compounds presen tly in clinical use originate from natural products or their derivativ es.

My genes do not know tomorrow' s synthetic chemicals . \"Chemotherap y is reall y assault ing the immune system and assaulting cancer at the same time,\" Duke goes on. \"But we have to strength en ours elves as we weaken the enemy, and most of the NCI approaches have been weakening the patient while weakening the cancer . I would rather take something like Hoxsey that would boost my immune system at the same time it was fighting the cancer .\" Throug hout history, herbs have served as a primar y tool for healing. Medicinal herbs have been found with the remains of Neander thal hu­ mans dating back 60,000 years . Pollen from eight flowers and branches spread at their graves in a cave in Iraq was ident ified as originating from eight diffe rent species, seven of which are still used as traditional herbal medicines by the local resident s.15 The thrilling 1991 discovery of the \"Iceman ,\" a trave ler whose 5,300-year -old mummi fied body was found frozen in the ice in the Alps of northern Italy, revealed that he carried two walnut-sized lumps tied to a leather thong probabl y attached to his clothing. Microbiol ogist s have identified them as the fruit of the birch fung us, which contains a natural antibiotic he was appa rently using against the parasite found in his colon. 16 Not unlik e the Iceman, over 7 5 percent of the world's populat ion still relies on plant-der ived medicines for basic health-care needs, according to the Wo rld Healt h Organization .17 At the NCis own Cancer Chemotherapy National Services Center, studies have found that the occurrence of drug activity is higher in plants reported in folk literature than in plants colle cted at random, \"suggesting a corre la­ tion between plants used in fo lklore and those with anticancer activity .\"1 8 When researchers compared the efficacy of drugs screened at random against those suggested by fo lk use, the fo lk tradition yielded a 20 to 50 percent \"hit\" rate in contrast with I 0 percent from random screening. 1 '1"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Hoxsey·s t:clectic Appr oach to Lancer 197 Dennis McK enna' s greatest interest in the Hoxsey tonic emanat es from its folk tradition rather than from any labo ratory data. \"The folk usage is another kind of screen.

Herbalism in general and especi ally the way it was prac­ ticed in the nineteent h cent ury and still today is a pretty empirical sci­ ence. The real significance is that, if it does work from the standpoint of the person trying to cure the disease, that's good enoug h. They can let the molecular biolog ist worry about how it works . The Eclectic school and these other s were pretty savvy and they didn' t use things if they didn' t feel that they were getti ng some results .\" McKenna point s out that even conv entional cancer drugs derived from plants, such as Vinc ristine and Vinblastine, were missed in NCI screens until some researcher went back to look at them again on a hunch.2 0 \"There is no substit ute for the human factor, the human intuit ion,\" McKenna smiles, tossing his beloved science to the winds for a philosophical mo­ ment. \"That' s where the tie to folk medic ine comes, because the Eclec­ tics were very astute obser vationists .

It's like the idea that, if you put three billion monkeys in a room, one of them might write a Shakespearean sonnet. \" And what about Hoxsey' s horse ? Francis Brinker is respectfull y skep­ tical . A horse might possibly have nibbled on poke root, barbe rry, and burdock, while consuming substanti al amount s of red clover. Pric kly ash, however, is a decide dly aversive exper ience, inciting severe burning in the mouth. Animals seldom eat barks such as buckthorn , which causes sharp spastic contractions when taken fresh and must be aged for a year prior to human useY On the other hand, the field of zoopharmacog nosy, the natural sources of veterinary medicines, is now a legitimate discipline, practiced at Harvard, among other places. Jane Goodall, who has studied chimpanzees in Africa for several decades, reported observing the creatures straying twenty"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"minutes from their normal feeding grounds in search of the aspilia bush . They consumed only the leaves and swallowed them whol e. Researchers later discovered the leaf to contain a potent antibiotic that the chimps sought out when they were ill. African fo lk healers have long used the same plant for treating stomach upset and wou nds.B Many indig enous peopl es around the world maintain that they did not discover their rich tradition of botanical medicine by the perilous trial-and- error tasting of each plant. Rather, they obser ved the animals, a much surer and safer way to go. Though implau sible, Hoxsey' s horse story may well have had a kernel of truth to it. Hoxsey' s horse also rides a symbolic ally rich heritage. According to ancient mytholog y, it was the Greek god Chi ron, half man and half hor se, who gave herbal knowledge to human being s from his cave . Jonathan Hartwe ll, in the article \"Plant Reme dies for Cancer\" pub­ lished in Ca n cer Chemothera py Repm'ts, wrot e, \"Plants provi de a fe rtile sour ce of compounds with novel structures which are needed in cancer chemother apy, but which are difficult fo r the chemist to synthesiz e.

The empirical application of plant s to the ailing human body over thousands of year s has resulted in certa in obser vable effects interpreted as bene fi­ cial, and has culminat ed in the development of man y useful drugs fo r a number of diseases. If there is any hope in a chemical treatment for can­ cer, it is reasonable to belie ve that such an agent is as likely to originate from a plant as well as from pure synthesi s.\"H In fact, Hartwell decided to write Plants Used Against Cancer after learn­ ing that the Penobscot Indians were the first to use the may apple against cancer , event ually leading to the chemother apy drug Etopo side.25 Ye t even today, about 90 percent of the wor ld's flora remains unin vestigated by scient ific medicine .U• Hartwe ll closed his discour se on botanical cancer remedie s with words from the esteemed professor Geor ge Sarton, a scholar of medical history. \"The remembr ance of these astounding fo lk discoveries should sober our thought s when we criticize too freely the old pharmaco poeias.

Because the area was too sensitive for the caustic escha rotics she other wise might apply, Brinker watched the nurse prescribe solely the internal tonic, which had begun to reduce the tumor in size. As a result, he gained an added appreciation for the impor tance of the tonic. \"I merely went to obser ve and try to get a sense of the value of this thera py. I left with great respect for Mildred as a person .

As the Ameri­ can Botanical Counci l's Mark Blumenthal quipped, \"The epithet of 'a bunch of weeds' is fine with me. As Ralph Wa ldo Emer son said in The Future of the Republic, 'What is a weed?

We heard numerous similar accounts of how exter nal cancers dried up and fell out after appli cation of the red paste or yellow powder . The Hoxsey method is justifi ably fa mous fo r its escharotic rem edies. In fact, since about 1950 organized medicine has not even contested their efficac y. Mrs. Bond' s case shows the standard proce dure for the Hoxsey escharotics, which are usuall y applied topical ly. (Esch arotic means \"scar ­ forming. \") They are always used in combination with the tonic. When­ ever possible, patie nts start on the tonic before external treatment and continue on it fo r man y years after. As a true escharotic, the red paste is used only external ly. But as a selective agent, the yello w powder can also be used internal ly, as the fo llowing dramatic story describes. While making the film in 1985, we trave led to Calif ornia to meet Stephen Crutcher , a Hoxsey patient living in a suburb near the San Fran­ cisco Bay area. He was very soft-spoken, his eyes slightly masked behind lightly tinted glasses. Casually dressed in a sport shirt in his modest home, he exuded gentl eness in contrast to the chilling events that shook his life beginning in 197 5. \"I talked to a dentist who noticed a lump in the roof of my mout h,\" Stephen began softly. \"He wanted to know if I'd had it checked out, but at the time I hadn' t really thought about it. So I went to an ear, nose, and throat speci alist who took a biopsy right there. He called me at work one day and said he had to talk to me. \"That' s when he told me it was malig nant -cancer of the mucous glands. They wanted to do surger y right away, and not knowing about other things, we set it up right off the bat. Then my wife was very reluc­ tant about letting it go through and we started asking questions. The 200"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Hoxsey Eschar otics 20 1 doctor said it had to be done right away, but we wanted to get some other opinions first. He gave us the names of some doct ors and they generall y all had the same opinion : It was either radiat ion or surger y. That's when my wife's sister, who had heard friends of her s who had gone to see Mildred at the clinic, started trying to talk me into going. \" Stephen paused, revisiting the grim crossroa ds. We asked him exact ly what kinds of treatment the doct ors were recommending. \"They wanted to start by removi ng the upper palat e and then go to the jaw, then get at the upper gum by remov ing the teeth. And then 'what ever else they found' is what they told me-t hat's the term they used-wh ich kin d of scared me. One of the doct ors had said something about removing most of the palate, and plating it in gold or putting a gold one in, so that they could do radiation in the rest of the areas of the mouth without affecting the lower skull or brain area. But they never reall y did say they could cure it. That was one of the first thing s Mildred did say to me. She said, 'Well, we can cure this.'\" Stephen Crut cher decided to mak e the trip to Bio Medic al. He was understandably anxious. \"When I first went to Hoxsey, I had the opinion that if it's so good, why isn't it here in the U.S.? Seeing the place for the first time in the old building was kind of a shock after seeing moder n hospitals. My first impression was, 'What am I doing here?' But after talking to them, they put me at ease.\" Mildred injected the roof of his mout h with a liquid preparation of the Hoxsey yellow powder . She also put him on the internal Hoxsey tonic for several years to follow. \"I was going back every couple of days during the first two week s while they checked it to mak e sure there was no infection. All this time it was draining, and it felt like runners running down in my mout h and across the jaw. Mildred said it was probably from cancer trying to spread through the system . After that I went back regularl y, every three or six mont hs. Basically that' s all the treatment I've had, and I feel pretty lucky that that's the only thing I did do.\" His cancer disappear ed complet ely, and his mouth healed perfectly. When I tracked down Stephen Crutch er more than twelve years later to check his standing, I found him alive and well. He has had no recurrence and continues to work at a large Air Force base and serve in the National Guard . His records confirmed his cancer. According to the Hildenbrands' epidemiological verification, it was clear from the physician' s original notes that \"something was still there\" when he left for Hoxsey. Only after Mildr ed's treatment did it go away. Crutcher has now been cancer-free for twenty­ four years . He had no conventional cancer treatment, only Hoxsey."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"202 A CONF LICT OF MEDIC AL Ut\"INIUN Let's look more deepl y into these ancient medicines. As a \"true\" es­ charotic, the red paste is a corrosive substance that will burn or destroy any tissue in its path. It has a radiant effect that precipit ates a chain reac­ tion up to two inches from where it is applied . It is used mainl y on large tumors. It does not so much cure the cancer as kill it, forming a dead, hard, black remnant, or eschar, which then sloughs off. As an an indiscriminat e killer of cells , the red paste can be extre mely dang erous and disfig uring unless used by a skilled practitioner . Its main detriment is the intense pain it causes, though man y patients are willing to tolerate it given the alter natives of radical surge ry, radiat ion, or che­ motherap y. Local anesthetics do not reall y work over a prolonged pe­ riod . Mildr ed Nelson is opposed to morphine because of its addic tive power and asks patient s to withstand the pain. The red paste contains the mineral-based antimony trisulfide and zinc chloride, as well as the herb bloodroot, known by its botanical name of San­ guin m ·ia canadensis . Antimony trisu lfide is a salt of the highly toxic heavy metal antimony, also known as stibnite. It is believed to act as a \"permeant\" to facilitate infilt ration of the zinc chlor ide. Zinc chloride is a caustic chemi­ cal that opens the skin and permits the slough to fo rm. It acts as a \"fixative. \"1 Bloodr oot is a red root that acts as a chemother apeutic agent to kill the cancer cells. With a long history of widespr ead Native American us­ age, it was used by the Cher okee Indians for breast cancer , and both the Cher okee and Iroquois used it topicall y for cancer s. 2 Bloodr oot contains important chemical compounds that have shown antit umor activity in laborator y tests with mice as well as in petri dish cell lines. It has also demo nstrated action against disease-c ausing bacter ia.·l Jim Duke points out that it has been extensively studied by the National Can­ cer Institute, and that it got a fo rmidable twenty-two citat ions fo r external cancer in Hartw ell's Plants Used Against Canm: According to Duke, blood­ root possesses strong chemical antitumor and anticancer propert ies.� The old \"quac k\" remedy of zinc chloride is also being validated scien­ tificall y. A recent study published in a dermatolog y journal conc luded that its fixation of certain melanomas increased resistance to tumors by acting as an immune boost er. 5 The formula fo r the red paste has several historical antecedents . It is similar to Fell's Reme dy, developed by Dr. ]. We ldon Fell, an American physician who credited the Cher okee with showing him their use of blood­ root. Descended from a line of prominent physicians, Dr. Fell was among the founder s of the New Yo rk Academy of Medicine and was a fa culty member of the Unive rsity of New Yo rk. After acquiring the root from the Indians, he added zinc chloride to amplify its activity and claimed to"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The Hoxsey Eschar otics 203 be able to eradicat e large tumors in a matter of weeks. He published his formulas in 1857. Dr. Fell soon ran afoul of the orthodox medical commun ity and even­ tually expat riated to London. He conducted extensive work at Middle sex Hospital and freely published the formulas and result s. The treatment was later endorsed by the hospit al. Neverth eless, it was not adopted and disappeared from view. Another London physician, Dr. John Pattison, apparent ly took up the same fo rmula. An outspoken critic of surger y, he incurred the opposition of orthodox medicine. 6 Several other similar formulas were used and published . in the early twentieth century, when escharotics were a common fo rm of treatment used by medical doctors, empirics, and folk healer s alike. Along with sur­ gery, these caustics were the allopathic profession' s principal tools against cancer . Regular doct ors historically favored mineral-based treatm ents including arsenic and mercury. It is likely that the Eclectics appr opriat ed escharotics from the allopat hs. The use of eschar otics actually dates back in India as far as 2,50 0 year s to an arsenic paste, and the Greek physician Hippocrates also used one around 400 B.c.7 Bloodr oot and zinc chloride were favored by the Eclectic physician Eli Jones in tandem with an internal tonic and other internal remedies. Like Hoxs ey, Dr. Jones was adamant that caust ics were to be emplo yed only in conjunc tion with internal medicines because of the syste mic na­ ture of the disease. (He used another external paste made from poke root.) In his era around the turn of the century, eschar otic pastes were com­ monl y available in drugstores. H The most start ling parallel to Hoxsey' s red paste, however, was an identical fo rmula used by dermatologist Dr. Frederic Mohs at the Uni­ versity of Wisconsin medical school. Starting in the 1930 s, Dr. Mobs conducted meticulous experimentation on hundreds and even tually thou­ sands of cancer patients. He called his method chem o.rtn-gery, a micro­ scopicall y contr olled process he conducted with painstak ing care . By the time he published his results in 1941 in the journal Anhives of SU?-gery, he had alread y conducted eight years of labor atory work followed by four years of clinical practice on six hundred cancer patientsY The kicker, however, was that Dr. Mobs published his ongoing re­ search seven year s later in 1948 in ]AMA. \"The term 'chemosu rgery,\"' wrote Dr. Mobs, \"was coined to designat e a newly developed method for the treatment of cancer . The most important feature is the technic by which thorough microsc opic control of excision may be obtained. This microscopic control mak es possible the select ive destruction of cancer with the dual advantages of unprecedented reliabilit y and conser vatism.\""},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":".l.V\"t /\"\\ \\..VI'�rLI\\.. I Vr l\"lt:LJI\\...1\"\\L Vrii 'IIVI'I In 814 cases, he achie ved an \"unusuall y high propor tion of succ essful result s,\" ranging from 96 percent on basal cell carcinoma to about 85 percent in squamous cell skin cancer s. 1 0 Dr. Mohs achie ved these result s despite treating many advanced can­ cers, over a third of which had recurred following surgery and radiation. \"The unprecedented reliabilit y of the chemosurg ical treatment of cancer is indicated by compar ison with statistical result s from other centers for cancer treatment,\" he wrote . The curative success for Mohs' s technique was 93.5 percent compared to the standard 88 percent rate. His success rate under scored the treatment' s conserva tism, since it harms very little healt hy tissue. The method's other notable virtue was that it eliminat ed deaths from surgery. Dr. Mohs combined the eschar otic treatment with tedious microsc opic surg ical excisions, a factor that may have made his hybrid appr oach more palatable to the medical prof ession .11 He acknowl edged the long usage of zinc chloride by man y \"qua cks and irregulars,\" but distinguished his own protocol by its microscopic contr ol, able to avoid the wholesale destruc­ tion of tissue that escharotics can cause. Dr. Mohs never did addr ess the mystery of how he came to add blood­ root to his formula. As Ralph Moss has noted, \"Th at out of thous ands of agents Mohs just stumbled upon bloodroot by complet e happenstance strains credulity .\"12 When Dr. Andrew Ivy visited the Dallas clinic, he noted the similar ity of Hoxsey' s red paste to the \"Wisconsin paste\" used by Dr. Mohs. Dr. Durkee said it was the same.13 Did Dr . Mohs actually learn about the red paste from Hoxsey? Thus it was, when Hoxsey faced Dr. Morris Fishbein in court in 1949, that the AMA no longer disputed Hoxsey' s external cures. The Journal's publication of Dr. Moh' s procedur e with a paste identical to Hoxsey' s provi ded irrefut able proof of its efficac y. Fish bein' s attorne ys spent con­ siderable energy preparing defensive strategies to explain away the unde­ niable success confirmed by Dr. Mohs' s data . They advised Fishbein to say that the Journal often published pro and con opinions, and that pub­ lication of the article did not represent an endor sement. l 4 However, the AMA never again challenged the effectiveness of the Hoxsey external treatments, though belit tling them as archaic. The FDA also stopped at­ tacking Hoxsey' s exter nal preparations. Dr. Mohs continued to work and publish into the 1970s, refining his method amid a deafening silence from his peer medical community . Some proponents, including resear cher s at Harvard and the University of Wis­ consin, did adopt the practi ce, which is now considered a \"standard ,\" though seldom used, treatment for certain skin cancers . The only acknowledged"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Hoxsey Eschar otics 205 disad vantages are the pain and labor -intensive nature of the treatment. Apart from super ficial skin cancers, Dr. Mohs also found it useful for mela­ nomas, as well as otherwise sensi tive or surgi cally hard-t o-reach areas.15 To ward the end of his career, he relied increasing ly on his microsurger y, perhaps in frustration over the lack of recognition his work receive d. The Hoxsey yellow powder is yet another matter. It is the substance that the AMA charged \"ate into patient s' blood vessels\" and caused deat h by arsenic poisoning. To the contra ry, Hoxsey contended-as does Mildred Nelson-t hat it is nontoxic and selective of malig nant tissue only . It is used for the \"fine detail work\" of tumor eradication, while the red paste is reser ved for large tumors that need to be attacked quick ly. Hoxsey the­ atrically swallowed it in front of audiences or bathed his eye in it to dem­ onstrate its harmlessness. While filming, we watched Mildred Nelson nibble a taste of it, and she was obvi ously unconcerned about getting it on her skin. The yellow powder contains arsenic sulfide, yello w precipitate (pow­ dered sulfur ), sulfur , and talc. Arsenic trisu lfide is also an old form of escharotic, but a notorious one considered generally very destructive, dang erous, and indis criminate in its action against tissu es. Howe ver, Hoxsey claimed to have rendered the compound nonpoisonous, which appe ars to be true. It is not entirely clear when or how he accomplished this. Acco rding to my own research, it appe ars to have occurred by 1930, because subsequent experience by other prac titioners including Dr . Ira Drew confirmed the nontoxic quality of the medicat ion. Previously Hoxsey may or may not have been using a toxic form of arsenic. 16 The use of arsenic against cancer , which goes back to ancient Egypt and India, has been revived today in China, where complete responses are being achie ved against leukemia. Memorial Sloan-K etter ing Cancer Center is now exper imenting with it as well.17 As Ralph Moss point s out, \"Essenti ally, this is the same prescription an Egyp tian doct or would have made 5,000 year s ago.\"1H According to Mildred Nelson, tumors slough off \"like a pit from a peach\" within seven to fourteen days after starting eschar otic treatment. The scar left by the red paste is readil y identifiable, leaving a smooth depression . \"The scar isn't as pretty as the surgical scar,\" she concedes, \"but there are fewer metastases than with surger y. \" She generally starts external cases on the tonic for one to six months . prior to using the escharot ics. Francis Brinker offered an intriguing conj ecture about the possible combined actions of the ingredient s in the Hoxsey remedies. \"Given the presence of potassium iodide in the tonic, it is probable that the major"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"206 A \\.... UI'H\"LI \\.... I Ut\" i•lt:LJI\\....AL Ut'II 'IIVI 'I direct antit umor activity for both the tonic and the eschar otics is due in large part to the destructive effects of the mineral element s. On the other hand, the herbs indir ectly mak e these mineral agents much more effec­ tive by the ways they provi de the foundational healing and enhanced elimi­ nation to overcome the procl ivity toward cancer . In balance, it seems more apparent to me that it is the integration of the toxic chemicals, representat ive of allopa thy, and herbs, representa tive of nat ural healing, that empo wers the death-defy ing Eclectic approach .\" The use of eschar otics in cancer has several benefits, accor ding to Mildred. \"The end result is where the advantage comes. There' s less pos­ sibilit y of spread or recurrence in the same area. When I am in doubt ifl got all the cancer , I put the yello w powder back on the good skin. If nothing happens, that tells me I have no problem left. The y can't do this with su rgery, and they have to wait until the tumor recur s, and then an­ other surger y. The healing process is very rapid. Once the tumor comes out, it isn't sore and doesn' t hurt. \" While organized medic ine char ged that Hoxsey' s eschar otics were dis­ figuring, it fa iled to ment ion that surgery is too. As evidenced by Dr. Mohs' s data, the disfig urement using the red paste is often milder than with surger y. In fa ct, the fa ther of the famous \"Halsted radical mastec­ tomy, \" legen dary n1rn-of -the-cent ury surgeon William Stuart Halst ed, wrote glowingly of his encounter s with escharot ics. \"I have several times had occasion to operate on cancer which had been vigorously and repeat­ edly treated with caustics [eschar otics] and to note the compar atively ad­ mirable conditions, the freedom from cancer permeation of the surroun d­ ing tissues of the axilla; whereas, after incomplet e oper ation with the knife, the local mani festations of recurrence were almost invariabl y deplor able, and the prog nosis, of cour se, invariably hopeless .\"''' Francis Brinker spent seven days at the Bio Medical Center obser ving Mildred Nelson treat external cases . He conc luded that no two were treated exactly the same, and that she had a surprising ly broad repertoire of ways of applying the yellow powd er. \"I thought that Mildred had a lot of very practical skills, and her experience had taught her a lot in terms of being creat ive in variable approaches to applying the eschar otics. With the powder , I saw her variously dip cotton balls on the end of a hemostat [a medical clamp] into the powder and then tap it over an area to sprinkle it on lightly. I saw her use an insufflat or-a little bulb syringe device­ over a larger area covering most of the half of a side of a face with really extensive lesions, where the powder was blown over the area. There were cases where she took a little K-Y jelly and mixed the powder and applied it with a cotton swab. She would modify her techniques specificall y fo r"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The Hoxsey Eschar otics 207 whatever requirement that case had. She has a very homespun appr oach to clinical pract ice. She certainly was not embar rassed to appear simple, and at the same time she obvi ously had profound pract ical knowl edge and didn' t show it off. She was very genuine.\" Why aren' t these eschar otics used more widel y? \"Frank ly, I think the basic part is mone y,\" Mildr ed speculat ed. \"Second, the doctor s don' t want to spend that much time taking care of patients when they could surgi­ cally remove it, send them home, and not worry about it. It is time-c on­ suming. But the end mak es it well worth it.\" External treatment s can require week s or even mont hs of frequent care. Dr. Mohs also: indicat ed that using escharotics takes more time and attent ion. The dominat ion of conv entional cancer treatment by surgeons has greatly depressed any interest in escha rotics. Even the excepti onal result s achieved by Dr. Mohs combining surger y with escha rotics made little impact on conv entional practices, although, as mentioned earlier , the Mohs method is accepted and even listed in the orthodox Tabe1·� Cy clopedic Medical Diction m y . 2 0 Still, in the United States today, there is a large under ground of people using several fo rms of escharotics. They come variously from Native American healers on Indian lands and from assor ted fo lk traditions that have maintained them covertly . In a compr ehensive and unique book, Cancer Salves, author Ingrid Naiman explores a multitude of eschar otics, including many still in active use around the country today. Naiman has begun recons tructi ng and refashioning man y old empirical formulas for treating external cancer with these salves and their adjunc tive tonics. 2 1 \"There are reasons to accept the validity of this escharotic applicat ion to cancer based on empir ical evidenc e,\" concludes Brinker, whose own grandfather was success fully treated with eschar otics at the fa mous Nichols Sanit orium in Missouri, which treated almost 20,000 patients into the 1940s and claimed an overall success rate of around 7 5 percentY \"There shouldn' t be any controversy rega rding their use. The question is whether there is significant risk that doesn 't exist with an equally effective con­ vent ional techn ique. The simplicit y of these eschar otic fo rmulas would allow for some fa irly easy studies and animal tests.\" These escharotic treatment s today occupy a nebulous legal standing. The basic practice has been validat ed scientifically and published in the med ical literature, yet the use of these salves has been largely neglect ed, margina lized, or driven undergro und. This situat ion fosters the danger of their use in unskilled hands, where there have been cases of serious injury and disfig urement report ed.

From early on, the Hoxse y method has offered ubstantial \"supp ortive treatment\" including a diet, vitamins, nutrit ional supplements, and other miscellaneous therapies. The approaches are both physical and spirit ual. The Hoxsey diet is relatively simple compared with many anticancer diets. Much of it is founded in excluding foods that are belie ved to coun­ teract the activity of the tonic, based on empirical exper ience. Patients are barred from eating pork, vine gar, tomat oes, lard, carbonated bever­ ages, processed whit e sugar, white flour, and alcohol . Fried and highly piced foods are also eliminat ed. Overall it is a basic, reasonably healt hy nenu emphasizing fresh fruits and veget ables. The clinic also offers extensive suppo rtive treatments that are con­ tinually evolving with current knowledge. Mildr ed emplo ys a special diet aimed at candida (yeast) infections , which she belie ves often precede can­ ·er . She uses the BCG (Bac illus Calmette-Guerin) vacci ne, an immune­ ·timula ting serum widel y used in Europe, which also combat s tuberculo­ ·is. She dispenses vitamin C, yeast for B vitamins, and other vitamin and nineral supplement s. \"All I want is for that person to get well,\" Mildr ed leclares. \"If something else is going to help, more power to them .\" She 1as continued to experiment widel y with other contempor ary alternat ive )ractices, though the tonic remains the peren nial. \"No study into the cause of cancer would be complet e without weigh­ . ng the nutriti onal fa ctor, \" Hoxsey wrote in 195 5. \"Wrong eating habit s mquestion ably contribute to the origin and growth of many of the so­ ·al led incurable ailment s. Pastries, colas, alcohol , pork, bread made from bleached flour , fluorinated water , and other abnormal foods and liquids -reate inhibit ors to health in the human body . Ve getables grown in chemically treated soil depl eted of the proper mineral content have a similar effect.\"' 209"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Hoxsey saw himself as \"born and raised as a naturopat h and dieti­ tian.\"2 He vehement ly opposed the advent of chemical addi tives to fo ods that flooded the market in the 1950s, and attacked the FDA fo r not up­ holding its mission of protecting the safety of the food suppl y while \"throwing money away like drunken sailor s at a carniv al\" in it s assault against his natural medicine practices .l Throug hout Hoxsey' s era, organized medicine denied any link be­ tween diet and cancer . As Dr. Morris Fishbein cont ended, \"There is no scient ific evidence whatsoever to indic ate that modific ation in the di­ etary intake of fo od or any other nutritional essentials are of any specific value in the cont rol of cancer .\"4 Science has since cont radic ted him. In general terms, cont emporary research has shown that the Hoxsey diet does directly serve impo rtant anticancer funct ions. Reducing overall caloric intake, as this diet does, suppr esses and retards tumor growth. Most tumors are also promoted by the kind of high-f at diet Hoxsey ex­ cludes .' To day this diet would surprise few healt h-conscio us eaters, but in Harry Hoxsey' s era the regimen was quite radical, especially in a place like Te xas, where fried foods, meat at every meal, sodas and white sugar and whit e flour were standar d fa re. In many places in the United States today, patients still complain about the lack of availabilit y of fresh, healt hful fo ods to comply with the Hoxsey diet. As is now commonly known, subst antial data indicate that diet can both cause and alleviate canc er. Much contemporar y research confirms that certain fo ods, as well as the plet hora of synthetic addi tives present in most foods, can cont ribute to the onset of cancer .6 Resear ch has further shown that people who eat abundant fruits and vegetables have about half the risk of cancer and a lower death rate than those who don' t. The Nati onal Institutes of Health now reco mmends a diet rich in veget ables and fruits and lean in fa t. Of 156 dietary studies recent ly revi ewed, 82 percent showed that fruit and veget able consumption provi ded signi fi­ cant protecti on against many kinds of cancer s.7 A Finnish study found an inverse relationsh ip between lung cancer incidence and the consumption of dietary flavonoids found in fruits and veget ables.w A study in the Netherl ands has shown that allium veget ables such as onions, garlic, and leeks reduce the risk of stomach and colon cancer.9 A diet rich in antioxidant s from fruits and veget ables has been found to be a fa ctor in protecting against nonmelanoma skin cancer . 10 A 1988 study by Dr. Harold Foster at the Univer sity of Victor ia, Brit­ ish Colum bia, reviewing two hundred cases of\"spontaneous regress ion\" from cancer discovered that almost 90 percent had made chang es in their"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Nutriti on with Atti tude 21 1 diet preceding their recove ries. Most involved shifting to a vegetarian menu and eliminating white flour, sugar , and heavily process ed foods. Many also used vitamin and mineral supplements, as well as herbal teas. 11 Orthodox medicine now increasing ly ackno wledg es these connecti ons. In fact, a great body of this knowl edge alread y existed by the 1930 s and 1940s, and Dr. Fishbein did much to obstruct it. Most promi nent among his targets was Dr. Max Gerson, whose appe arance at the 1946 congres­ sional hearing s on cancer conducted by Senat or Claude Pepper brought forth provoca tive testimony on the abilit y of diet to palli ate or even cure cancer . 1 2 Dr. Gerson used an elaborate program of natural foods and fresh juices grown without synthetic chemicals, along with liver injections, potas­ sium iodide, and a sophi sticated course of vitamins and mineral supple­ ments . The diet was low in salt, fa t, and animal protein and high in car­ bohydrates and fresh organic fruits and veget ables. (Dr. Gerson adamant ly opposed the use of chemical fe rtilizer s.) It eliminat ed meat, milk, alco­ hol, and canned or bottled foods, and forbade smoking. Dr. Gerson claimed a documented success rate of around 30 percent with term inal cancer patients. Numerous Gerson patient s offered their testimonials at the hear ing, fo llowed by Dr. Geo rge Mile y of New Yo rk's Gotham Hospital, who, as discussed earlier , would later land in hot water for his testimon y on the failures of surgery and radiation. \"We do know experimentally that diet definit ely does influence cancer ,\" Dr. Mile y told the Senate committ ee. He called the Gerson method \"the first promising method which treats cancer as a systemic disease, that is, a disease of abno rmal chemist ry of the whole body .\"13 The basic element s of the diet Gerson recom mended are today widely ackn owledged fo r their general healt h virtues. Ye t, like Hoxs ey, Dr. Gerson was blackballed and harassed fo r the rest of his pro­ fessional career. Vitamin and mineral supplement s such as those prescribed by Hoxse y are also being proved today to influence the onset and treatment of can­ cer. Resear ch from Finland has shown a 32 percent reduction in pr ostate cancer incid ence among patient s using vitamin E, which may provi de protections against colo recta l and lung cancer as well.14 (Even by the 1950s, Canadian doctors had scientificall y established vitamin E as effective in preventing heart disease, although conve ntional medicine denied the con­ nection.)15 In a 1994 study on the effects of vitamin mega doses on the recurrence of bladder cancer, patients with cancer who received only the recommended"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"212 A CON FLIC T OF MEDIC AL OP INION daily allowance of vitamins and minerals exper ienced a tumor recurrence rate of 91 percent. Those who got the mega doses had a recurrence rate of just 41 percent. 16 Dr. William Fair, an eminent surgeon and former chairman of the urol­ ogy depar tment at Memorial Sloan-K ettering Cancer Center, began a nu­ tritional, Chinese herbal and holistic approach to his own colon cancer after four surgeries and chemot herapy failed. His cancer shrank and he has survived to launch nutritional resear ch focused principall y on vitamins C, D, and E, as well as the soybean, Chinese herbs, and the mineral seleniu m.17 Med itation, yoga, and other stress-relie ving techniques were an impor tant part of his thera py. A 1998 study by Harvard resear cher s published in the Journal of the Na tional Canm- Institute found that \"hig her selenium levels were associated with a reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer. \"18 In regard to diet and nutrition, clearly Harry Hoxsey was ahead of his time. But what if the Hoxsey tonic and diet really were worthless against cancer? Could they merely be placebos, \"lies that heal\" that work only be­ cause patients belie ve they will? (A placebo is an inert, inact ive substance with no actual physical therapeutic activi ty. Placebo is Latin for \"I shall please .\") \"Do n't Give Up Hope ,\" Hoxsey proclaimed on the cover of the 1936 brochure fo r the Spann Sanitarium. As he wrote in You Don't Have to Die, \"Cancer is not only a disease, it is also a psych osis. Te ll a victim he is 'hopeless' (or let him discover it from his family), and the will to live becomes paral yzed. Show him a way out, strip him of fear and hyste ria, give him even a forlorn hope, and the will to live is stimulat ed. It be­ comes a powerful ally in the battle against death.\"19 In his film Hoxsey elaborated on his view of attitudinal healing. \"These people have one simple thing in common : They were frighten ed, con­ fused. They did not know which way to turn for help. Fear is lik e a bullet fired into the mind . It can kill with deadly accura cy. Sent ence a patient to death, remo ve all hope, and he will obedi ently roll over to wither away. Their tissues, their bones, their blood may be diseased, but their will to live is sound and healt hy. That is why they are here. When the horror of this ugly scavenger casts its shad ow, each one of these people has asked, 'What do you do? Where do you go?' This place is their beac on of hope, the ray of light that might lead the way. \" 2 0 Jim Burke remembered watching how Hoxsey mingled with his pa­ tients. \"Dr. Hoxsey introduced me to the few patients around , and he wou ld put his arm around them, these old women with cancer , and say, 'Moth er, I ain't going to let you die. Yo u're going to get well. Them doctors are going to cut you up and kill you. But I'm here and I'm going to see that you get well.' They belie ved him."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Nutriti on with Atti tude 213 \"When Harry would come into that clinic, it was filled with people who had come from all over the world. The doctors had given up on them. Pitiful sight. But the man had something. He would come in and he'd put his arm around those old people and somehow he had the abilit y to inspir e them to get well. He must have triggered somet hing in their psyche or in their physical makeup that perhaps trigg ered somet hing in them that made them cure themsel ves.\" Observer s noted that Hoxsey seemed able to talk patient s into gettin g well. Mildred Nelson agrees. \"Har ry felt that the pat ients' attitudes played a very, very big part in their getti ng well. If he could say anyth ing or show them anything or convince them of anyt hing that would lead them to belie ve they could do this, he wou ld do it. 'Know that you're going to get well.' They belie ved him and would do it for him, along with the medica­ tion and everyt hing. \" Was Hoxsey just pitching an ephemeral \"castle in the air where sick folks get well,\" as Nor man Baker's hospital advertised? Organized medi­ cine thought so. \"There is a kind of hope that is useful and even thera­ peutic to some patient s if it is based on realit y, or even a small percentage of cures ,\" the FDA's William Grigg remark ed. \"But to raise a person' s"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"214 A CON FLIC T OF MEDIC AL OPINION hope in this way and then have it crash down, as you read in all these stories of these poor people, have them spend the money their families needed, and then discover that they had been duped in this way, you couldn't find anyt hing crueler. Even cancer itself was not as cruel as the horr ible realiz ation by these people that they had been duped .\" A poig nant 1950s internal FDA memorandum described a Hoxsey patient' s complaint about how agent s came and distur bed her fragile emo­ tional equilibr ium with derogat ory rema rks against the treatment. The FDA Commissioner himself respo nded. \"We are not unmindful of the well- known medical fact that sick people often show impr ovement from any new treatment. In man y cases the psychosomatic response is suffi­ cient justification fo r using the treatment even though its phar macologi­ cal activit y may be quest ionab le. This is not so, however, in the case of cancer , where early and compet ent treatment is of the utmost impor ­ tance to the welfare of the patient. \"21 Althoug h Dallas physician Harry Spence belie ved that Hoxs ey's medi­ cines were useless, he ackno wledged their possible psycholog ical ben­ efits. \"I think that hope is the greatest thing he had to offer. True, it was a misg uided hope, a fa lse hope. There was no hope. But still, from the patient' s point of view, it was hope .\" Oliver Field of the AMA went fur­ ther. \"People who think they've been treated, it's up here in their minds and in their hopes, and their unwi llingness to fa ce realit y. The hope has to be fa lse if they do have the fact of cancer in their bodie s.\" \"When you can define false hope, let me know, because there isn't any,\" countered Dr. Bernie Siegel as we filmed him in 1985 in his New Haven office near Ya le Universi ty, where he taught and operated his private can­ cer surgery practice .22 A spirit ed, radiant presence with shaved head and white doctor' s smock, he spok e in swirling gusts of ideas. \"What I think doctors call fa lse hope are statistics . Yo u take a disease, and it kills nine out of ten people. So you go down the line telling ten people they're supposed to die. You probabl y will kill ten out of ten by taking hope away. I see that in rever se. I say, 'Oh, 10 percent survive. That' s good.' Then I go into every room and I say, 'You have a chance of getting well, and I'll tell you how the 10 percent who get well do it.' I might get 30 or 40 percent well. At least I have an option then. There is no fa lse hope in the individual who has an illness. It is real, it is physiologic, and I have no difficult y giving it to people \"-Dr. Siegel then echoed Harry Hoxsey-\" because I know people today who are alive because I said, 'You don't have to die.\"' Dr. Siegel, who has authored several bestselling books on the subject of attitudinal healing, inclu ding Love, Medicine and Miracles, began to grope in his own practice for a profile of cancer survivo rs. \"People do get well"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Nutriti on with Attitude 215 when they're not supposed to. I met a lot of people who didn' t die when they were supposed to, and there are charts in this office of those people. The key factor was that, if you tell somebod y they'll be dead in six months and they're feeling better than ever in six months, they don' t come back for a check up. So most physi cians do not know who didn' t die when they were supposed to. \"I read Cancer Ward many times before the words came off the page, where Solzhenit syn uses the term self-induced healing -not sp ontaneous or miraculous. If we want to make medicine success-oriented, we would take the patients who get well or do better than they're suppose d to, identify it as something they had something to do with, and then teach that to other patient s who are willing to unde rtake it. That' s what I started do­ ing. Now, most patients don' t want the added work. That' s why we have so man y doctors. It's more difficult to change your life than it is to have an operation. The subm issive eight out of ten patient s come in and lie down , but the two out of ten say, 'Hey, I want to participate.\"' Dr. Siegel illustrated the medical prof ession' s own attitude toward people who get well when they aren' t supposed to. \"These are quotes from doctors : 'That case is a lie'; 'That's an error in diagnosis'; 'That' s a slow-growing tumor' ; 'Oh, that's a well- behaved cancer .' Never do they say the patient had anyt hing to do with the outcome. That's the point I keep trying to make : People have something to say about what happens to them .\" Dr. Siegel began to see a distinct portrait emer ge of the \"Exceptional Cancer Patient.\" \"They're all the people that doctors and nurses don' t like. When the nurse comes up to you and says, 'Your patient' s a real nuisance . He won't take his clothes off, and I can never find him in his room, and he keeps questioning every blood test, ' you say, 'Good, he's going to live long er.' In stud ies that are done at Ya le with patients with melanoma, the woman who did it, a psych olog ist, said it got to be a joke because there was a 100 percent correlation between the opinion of the head nurse of the patient and immune-s ystem activity. If the nurse said he's a real SOB and won 't let you draw the blood for the test, no trou ble with the immune system. If he was a wonderful, submis sive, gentle pa­ tient who will not question anyt hing, he was in trouble. \"In the study at Johns Hopkins, patient s with breast cancer -all long­ term survivors-were ide ntified by the doctors as having a poor relation­ ship with their doctors. So that's one piece of advice I give every body . Want to live longer? Develop a poor relationship with your doctor . The so-called 'bad' patient is a good patient from the standpoint of surviva l, and you can train people to be a good/bad patient. \""},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Although it is dang erously simpl istic to gene ralize about a \"cancer person ality, \" studies of patient s experiencing remark able remissions do generally affirm that survivors displa y a fighting spirit .23 Mildred Nelson sees the same profile in her clinic. \"The y're all free-thi nking people, or they wouldn' t even be here.

They're that de­ termi ned. Some of them do win it. Every one's told them that they can­ not, and they say, 'I will show you.' But those people have a totally differ­ ent mental attitude toward life and the value of life, what' s impo rtant to them, as fa r as their religion, their faith in God .\" In some sense, patients seeking out Hoxsey and other alternat ive can­ cer treatment s are self-selec ting. They are taking char ge of their lives and making a willful decision to live. They are sufficient ly advent urous to journey across an inter national border to a \"quack\" clinic. As such , they are alread y distinguishing themsel ves as poss ible survivors by sheer force of will and int ention. It is difficult to know how much impact this person ality profile affects the healing process . The atmosphere at the Bio Medical Center is decidedl y upbeat. When we filmed with Florence and Frank Gibson, a couple there to check up on Flor ence' s breast cancer , they described their experi ence . \"Just com­ ing to this clinic,\" Florence confided in a warm voice, soaking in the Mexi can sunsh ine, \"you get an entir ely different sense than when you go to a cold, sterile hospital, where nobody talks to anybody and everybody is afraid.\" \"That's the thing that impr essed me,\" chuckl ed husband Frank. \"I thought this was a psych iatric place, all these people laughing and talk­ ing, and they're supposed to be sick!\" \"Bec ause we have hope ,\" Florence added . \"We know cancer doesn't have to be a death sentence .'' When Rex Major came from New Zealand, he was unprepared for what he found. \"The thing that I was intri gued about was the attitude of most of the people in the waiting room. There's an awful lot of sick people there , usuall y the first-t imers. But the laughing and the jokes and the friendly camaraderie created in that place is something to behold. \"I was only supposed to be there for one day, but I decided to stay for three days . I kept going back, hopped on the shuttle bus with Raul from the International Motor Inn and went back across the border , my wife and I, just to be there . Just to chat with other people.

Maybe it's only 10 percent. My com­ ment generally is it's those people who have done it. I'm not sure that any of those th erapies mean anyt hing, but it has given them hope and instant group thera py, because a lot of people come together with those belief s and you see something happen. \"A placebo is a hope -giver ,\" Dr. Siegel under scored with convi ction. \"You have to remember the power within that word . We tend to label thing s we don' t want to understand, like 'spontaneous remissi on.' Yo u don' t have to study that: That' s a word . 'Placeb o.' Oh yeah, placebo.

That means within the body is this incredible power that the mind and body communicate, so why not stimulate that?\" Dr. Herbert Benson of Harvard, an early pioneer since the late 1960s in the nascent field of mind-b ody medicine, has extensively studied the \"placebo effect\" among people who exhibit actual medical effects after using the inactive deco y. A cardiologist, he successfully treated his own high blood pressure in the late 1960s through medit ation. He was ap­ palled to find that there was not one citation describing this mind- body interaction in the Index Medicus by the 193 Os, when such phenomena were discounted as impos sible.24 Even by 1985, a famous editorial in the New England Journal of Medicin e derided the abilit y of emot ions to cont ribut e to disease outcomes as \"folklore ... a myth [that ] serves as a form of mast ery.\"25 As Dr. Norman Sartorius of the United Nations Wo rld Healt h Organization wrote, \"The healing process has been relegated to the po­ sition of a disturbing effect, summed up under the name 'placebo,' equated to some kind of noise in the system.''26 Ye t what does the placebo trigger in a person to be able to accomplish such \"mir aculous\" results as significant ly leng thening survival time or even dispatching a suppose dly incurable cancer? How is it that people exhibit ing multiple personalit y disorder have real physical diseases come and go with shift s in persona ?

Dr. Irving Kirsch, a psychiat rist at the Universit y of Connecticut who conducted the review, concl uded that placebos are about 55 to 60 percent as effec­ tive for contr olling pain as most active med ications. 2 H \"Explanat ions of why placebos work, \" reported the Ne1V Ytwk Times, \"can be found in a new field of cogni tive neuropsych olog y called expect­ ancy t b e o ry - what the brain belie ves about the immed iate future.

Howard Fields, a neurosci entist at the University of Calif ornia at San Francisco who studies placebo effects.\" Dr. David Spiegel, a specialist in hypnosis and dissociat ive disor ders at Stanford Univer sity, conducted a study of breast cancer patient s to determine whether \"psychosocial inter vent ion\" could affect their degree of pain and disposition. He structured the exper iment with two groups, one that offered mutual support and social contact from the families and a control group without these fa ctors. The subjective experience of pain in member s of the support group was decide dly less and their abilit y to cope was enhanced .29 Several year s later , skeptical of the result s he himself obser ved, Dr. Spieg el returned to the group to see what had happened to the women. Although eighty-three of eighty-six ultimat ely died, the physician was amazed to learn that, where all the member s of the control group died within four years, a third of the inter vention group was still living after the same time frame. The inter vention group lived an overall averag e of twice the length of the control group. He also saw a \"dose response\" indicating that the more support sessions the women attended, the longer they surviv ed.·w A fo llow-up study looking at actual survival time among breast and prostat e cancer patient s using psych osoci al intervention found that the inter vention group did live \"significa ntly longer .\".l1"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":", , ,,,_,, , u .• vu YY I\\. 11 f\"'\\t.t.U ..

For year s, resear ch has shown that opti­ mist s weather coron ary bypass surgery better and live longer with H.I.V.

As a consequence of these and other definit ive studies, the medical prof ession is increasing ly embracing attitudinal healing as a valuable ad­ junct in cancer thera py. As a nonsurgical and nondr ug treatment, attitu­ dinal healing in a certain sense represent s less of a material threat to con­ venti onal medicine than, say, an herbal tonic. It does pose a philosophical challe nge, however, as evidenced by the fact that cases of remar kable re­ missions have seldom been studied until fairly recen tly. To day, mounting evidence shows that mind and body are not separ ate entities, but blend in a fluid plast icity of fa ntast ically complex interact ions. Dr. Bernie Siegel, citing a physicist noting important advances in our un­ derstanding of quant um physics, oberser ves simp ly, \"Desire and intention alter the physical world. They can thus cause things to occur which wou ld not normally occur if they were not desired. From my experi ence determi­ nation is necessar y too.\".ll Hypnosis is well documented as a practical tech­ nique fo r speeding the healing of wounds and altering basic physiologic processes. Emot ional and mental states have been shown to increase the neuropeptides and endorphins that seem to mirror or regulate moods and which have a direct relationship with immune cells. Dr. Candace Pert, fo rmer chief of the Brain Biochemis try Section of the National Institute of Mental Healt h and codiscoverer of endorphins, suggests, \"It's not far-fetched to think of cancer treatment based partly on emotional intervent ion. Maybe that's the reason emotional catharsis seems often to precede healing; it's like kicking an old TV set stuck on verti cal hold. \"34 In the comprehensive book Remarkable Recovery, authors Marc Barasch and Caryle Hirshberg roved the scientific literat ure and scanned numer ­ ous cases of improbable remissions from many afflic tions, including can­ cer.

A new medicine, too, must learn to color outside the lines; lines that sometimes artificiall y divide doctor from patient, fact from feeling, surgery from synerg y, chemo from caring. A medical sys­ tem sensi tive to the genuine needs of patients would base healt h care as much on the individua l's intang ible values and belief s as on tangi ble phar ­ maceuticals and operations .\"35 Barasch and Hirshberg found several key commonalit ies across the profiles of these survivors. Many described a profound emotional release often resulting in a spiritual catharsis preceding their recover y. They took the opport unity to redirect their lives and choose a more satisfYing path. Most had close personal loving relationships and an emot ional support system. Man y experienced a deep faith and surren dered their troubles to a higher power . Barasch and Hirshberg raise the fascinating conundr um of what role these spiritual factors may play across the entire spect rum of remissions, inclu ding those attributed to convent ional thera py. \"Can we ever be cer­ tain whether 'real' treatment does not owe an unknown portion of its curative power to these 'nonmedical' factors ? For that matter, how can we know the extent to which mind-body factors might account for the successes of even ostensibly well- proven treatments ? In 1994, at a meet­ ing conv ened by th e Nati onal Institutes of Healt h Office of Altern ative Medicine, a paper was presented analyzing responses of various disease conditions to 'nonspeci fic effect s'-that is, placebos -using both alter­ native and standar d thera pies. It is reported that for either approach 'when both healers and patients belie ve that a treatment is likely to be effective, one can commonly expect impr ovement s in up to 70 percent of the pa­ tients treated, even when the treatment is entirely nonspecific. \" > l 6 Part of the power behind placebos is the enthu siasm of the physician as an \"agent for optimism and hope and a great inducer of belief s.\"37 As Dr. Bernie Siegel relates, \"When Cisplat inum [the chemot herapy drug] first came out at Sloan-K ettering and they gave it with great enth usiasm, 70 percent of the people were free of cancer six months later. Then the drug gets dispensed and the rate dropped to 30 percent, because the en­ thusiasm didn' t go with the drug. So, yeah, I deliver surgery and drugs with enthusiasm and hope .\" As a droll French doctor once quipped, \"Use the new therapies as quickly as possible before they lose the power to heal.\""},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Nutriti on with Attitude 22 1 From their perspe ctive using standard cancer treatments, conventi onal doct ors report the dang er of another kind of false hope: Man y terminal patients want to belie ve that their odds fo r survival are better than the prog nosis offered by their physici an. One study of terminal cancer pa­ tient s dem onstrates that this kind of belief can lead patients to insist on \"aggressive therapies that are useless and increase sufferi ng,\" such as cer­ tain chemotherapy regimen s.3 8 At the same time that conventional medicine has ignored the potential value of the placebo, it has been casual in applying its opposite. When doc­ tors \"give a cancer patient six months to live,\" they are delivering a nocebo . The shadow side of a placebo, a nocebo has the potential to be equall y powerful as a kind of hex whose underlying messag e to the patient is to die. The belief s of patient and doctor, as well as their shared projection, fashion a double-edg ed sword that can cut decisively to either life or death. \"You always have to be realistic, but hope is not unrealist ic,\" said Dr. Larry Norton, head of the solid tumor division at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center. \"I can't necessaril y tell you how to guarantee victory but I can tell you how to guarantee defeat: Be pessimistic. People who do well with the disease are those who know they will do well and will do anything to accomplish that. They have an irrational confidence in the futur e.\"39 \"The history of [allopat hic] medicine before one hundred fifty years ago is the history of the placebo effect,\" Dr. Benson point s out. Only with relati vely recent discoveries did scientific medicine enjoy tang ible therapeutic successes . The proof by Rob ert Koch and Louis Past eur of bacteri al causes of disease resulted in effective antibiotics. Deadl y tetanus was effectively ended by an antitoxin, just as strept omycin cured most strains of tuberc ulosis. Penicillin finall y defeated syphilis and gonorr hea, and sulfa drugs proved effective against meni ngitis and scarlet fever. Sig­ nificant contemporary allopathic technolog ies, Dr. Benson notes, include artificial heart valves, aortic pacemak ers and defib rillat ors, blood and plasma transfusions, and organ transplants.40 Ye t Dr. Benson warns that an overemphasis on these mechani stic ad­ vances has eclipsed the undeniable wholeness of the human being. He finds that 60 to 90 percent of visits paid to doctors should appr opriat ely be treated in the mind-b ody realm, and from 10 to 40 percent of condi­ tions are fitting for convent ional physiological medical approaches . He envisions a new style of medicine reconstituted as a three-leg ged stool consisting of drugs, surgical procedures, and self-care founded in belief systems. Only around 1910 did the word placebo become a pejorat ive term in medicine. He suggests that \"placebo\" be rephrased as \"remembered wellness\" and celebrated again as an invaluable therapeutic tool."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The first national conference on spontaneous remission was launched in 1998 under the auspices of the Instit ute for Noetic Sciences, a non­ profit Calif ornia group founded by astronaut Edgar Mitchell that was among the first to bring scientific rigor to this crucial area.

Even by today' s science, cancer remains vaguely described as a broad group of diseases char acterized by the uncontr olled growth and spread of abnormal cells. It is an unusual disease because it afflicts veget able, ani­ mal, and human life. It is a very ancient killer, first recorded more than four thousand years ago in Egypt and India. Hippo crates first character ­ ized tumors as karkinos or karninoma, giving rise to the word carcin oma. The physician Galen (A.D. 131-200) first gave it the term cance1; likening it to a crab's feet. 3 There are hundreds of kinds of cancer , and its etiolog y remains mys­ terious. Causal theories abound ranging from chronic irritation to envi­ ronmental factors, genetic inheritance, and viruses or microbial hosts. Each theory has valid data to support it in certain instances.

One viewpoint suggests causalit y by carci nogenic chemicals that induce genes to mutate and stimu late uncontr olled growth . Another pro­ poses a viral origin in the creation of tumors . Both factors produce can­ cer genes called oncog enes, from the Greek onkos, meaning a lump or mass . Althoug h organized medicine rejected any viral theory of cancer for the better part of this cent ury, there is now credible data to indicate viral involve ment in certain cancers. Some scientists go so far as to sug­ gest that cancer may turn out to be a vi rally transmit ted infectious disease like smallpox, bubonic plague, and other s that were the primary cause of death in 1900.4 Whatever the theoretical disag reements, the medical profession' s over­ all fa ilure treating cancer is evident in its very terminolog y. Orthod oxy long ago ceased using the word cure in favor of five-year survival rate. A patient living five years after diag nosis is statistically counted as cured, even if the person still has cancer or later dies of the disease. According to credible critics, seeming impr oveme nts in survival rates are often the re­ sult of statistical manipulat ions such as earlier diag nosis. Called \"lead­ time bias,\" this numerical sleight-of-hand misleadi ngly only appear s to extend the life span of the patient. Since the 1950s evidence has steadil y accumulated that surgery, radia­ tion, and chemother apy are far less effective than the public is being led to belie ve. Investigative journalist Daniel Greenber g, writing in the Co­ lumbia Journalism Review in 197 5, produced the first widel y reported expose showing that cancer survival rates since the 1950s have not progr essed, and th at impr ovements from 1930 to 1950 were mainl y a consequence of improved hospital nursing care and support syste ms. The existing body of data came from a scant four \"tumor registri es\" around the country representing only a fraction of the cancer populat ion. He further warned against statistical misrepresentations stemming from wrong diagnoses, as well as the fact that cancer surgeons frequent ly rejected cases of advanced cancer to mak e their track recor d appear better.5 The potential margin of error and possibilit ies fo r distortion were great. Greenberg stated that even the valid impr ovements were very, very small, and that there had been no significant advancem ents in treating any of the major forms of cancer .

Ye ars before, in 1969, Dr. Hardin Jones had alread y released a shock­ ing report on this issue at the Science Writers Convention sponsored by the American Cancer Societ y. Dr. Jones, a respected professor of medical phys ics from the Universit y of Calif ornia at Berkeley and an expert on statistics and the effects of radiat ion and drugs, essentially concluded that \"the common malig nancies show a remar kably similar rate of demise, whether treated or untreat ed.\" He went on to identify fundamental flaws in methods of medical measurement, and stated, \"The possib ility exists that treatment mak es the average situation worse.\"7 Since 1956, when Dr. Jones initiall y made this kind of assert ion, the scant three studies testing his devastating thesis have supported it. 8 Join­ ing the fray, Nobel laureate James Wa tson char ged that the American public had been sold a \"nast y bill of goods about cancer .\"9 This eminent codis coverer of the DNA double helix remar ked scathing ly that the war on cancer was \"a bunch of shit. \"1 0 Surgery is the oldest and most successful of convent ional cancer thera­ pies. When the tumor is localized, surgery can be a life-saving procedure, and the scalpel account s for the majority of succes ses. One limit ation is that surgery is a purely local applicat ion th at is helpless when the cancer has spread through the syste m. Surgery, which dates to ancient times, has always been controversi al. Hipp ocrates , writi ng around 400 B.c., considered cutting int o tumors be­ low the surface dangerous and lik ely to shorten the life of the patient. He viewed cancer as a sys temic disease, as did many early physicians, whose consensus was to leave it alone beyond the early stages. By the twelfth century , doctors were closel y tied to the church, which officiall y defle cted the then barbaric practice of surgery from doct ors to the disreputable class of \"bar bers.\" Their practice was gruesome and filthy, and filled the population with dread. Prior to the discovery of anest hesia, surgery was an agonizing ly painful procedure, and few were willing to endure it. Before the recognition of asepsis (infection control), pat ients were as likely to die from infection as from the disease. Ironi cally, for hundreds of years the medical profession shunned surgery as qua ckery. The first statist ical analysis of the value of cancer surgery was con­ ducted in 1844 by Dr. Leroy d'Etoilles and published by the French Acad­ emy of Science . Spanning a thirty-year time frame, the study looked at case histories of 2,781 patients from 174 doctors. It compared survival after using either surgery , escharotics, or no treatment. \"The net value of surgery or caustics was, in prolonging life, two mont hs for men and six"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"226 A CON FLIC T OF MEDIC AL OPI NION months fo r wom en. But that was only in the first few years after the ini­ tial diagnosis. After that period, those who had not accepted treatment had the greater survival potent ial by about 50 perce nt.\"1 1 In the mid-ni neteent h cent ury the discovery of anest hesia and asepsis suddenl y made surgery viable on a large scale. Now able to cont rol pain and infection, surgeons began to flourish . Their new power coincided with the spik e in cancer incidence synchr onous with the Industrial Revolu tion. What had been a relat ively rare disease commenced its long ascendanc y to a pandemic. The figurehead of infatuation with the scalpel was J. Mar ion Sims, infamous as a \"woman' s doctor\" in the South during the latter part of the ninet eenth century. 12 Pract icing on black slave women, he began a set of grot esque experime nts that his biographer characterized as \"little short of murderous .\"i.l Sims started his practice even before anesthesia and asep­ sis, doping his captive subjects on opium. Relocati ng to New Yo rk City, he cofou nded the Wo men' s Hospital and amplified his activitie s with a coterie of other surg eons . Among his special interests was cancer . The \"Lad y Man agers\" of the hospital dismissed Sims in horror over his pract ices, alt houg h he later regained his posit ion. When the wea lthy Astor fa mily, several of whose memb ers were stricken with cancer , of­ fe red a large grant to the Wo men' s Hospit al to build a cancer wing, Sims convi nced them in 1884 instead to fund the New Yo rk Cancer Hospital, the first in the coun try exclusively devoted to the disease . Later to be­ come Memorial Hospital and then Memorial Sloan-K ettering Cancer Center , it was destined to be the flagship of conve ntional cancer treat­ ment, seeding a new medical terrain. 14 Cancer surgeons now had a vast theater of oper ations to advance their craft. Excesses were common, oper ations such as the hemi corporect omy to remo ve the entire lower half of the body below the pelvis fo r bladder or pelvic cancers, and the \"commando\" to remove the jaw in its entirety . (Also especi ally popular were wome n's operations, including the routi ne procedure of a hysterectomy -remo ving uterus, ovaries, and fa llopian tubes-for \"emotional problem s.\") Surgeons thrived on \"her oic\" acts, the more radical the better. Most prominent among these was the \"Halsted procedure ,\" a radical mast ectomy for breast cancer pioneered by and named for its originat or, the previously mentioned Dr. William Halsted of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore . Halsted and other surge ons became the rock stars of American medicine. Physicians and surgeons who objected to the excesses of heroic surgery were censured or ignor ed.

Dr. Hardin Jones suggested the likelihood that \"radical surgery does more harm than good.\"15 By the 1970s it was clear ly determined that massive amputations such as the Halsted procedure were generally unnec­ essar y. Far more conser vative \"lump ectom ies\" eventually proved at least as effective, as well as fa r less disfig uring and traumatic to the patient. 16 There is disturbing evidence that surgery may release cancer cells into the blood and lymph systems to spreadY Further studies have shown that cutting a tumor may increase its subsequent growth if it is not entirely removed .18 In addit ion, ample document ation exists showing that the physical trauma of surgery depresses the immune system immediat ely afterward, just when metastasis is most likely to occur. Even needle biopsies may spread can­ cer. '� There is also concer n that tumors may act ually secrete factors that control metastasis, and that removing them can disrupt a subtle balan ce in the body preventing the cancer' s spread. 10 Physicall y and emotionally trau­ matic, surgery is the treatment most feared by patients. 1 1 \"Sur gery is not really a 'cure,'\" says Ralph Moss, whose rigorous re­ search on conventi onal cancer treatment s and the exclusion of alterna­ tives led him to write several eye-opening book s including Th e Cancer Industry (orig inall y titled Th e Cance1· Sy ndrome) and Questionin g Chemo­ the1'apy . \"Rather it's an amp utation of the probl em. It doesn' t say any­ thing about solving it, but simpl y eliminat es the sympt om.\" 11 It must also be said that canm· s111·ge1y has saved innumemble lives and is the best option under ce1'tain cinumstances. Surger y has produced more re­ missions than radiation and chemotherapy combined. Ye t its limitat ions are also evident, and it does not fundament ally address the unde rlying causes and mechanisms of this systemic illness. Surgeons came to dominat e and define cancer treatment fo r the first thirty years of the twentiet h century until radiat ion treatment began to emer ge as a serious comp etitor in the 1920s. Ironical ly, surgeons vehe­ ment ly opposed radiation as quackery, and it was not until 193 7 that the American Coll ege of Surgeons finally endorsed itY Throughout its ten­ ure, radiat ion has remained fiercely cont rove rsial, among other reasons because radiat ion causes cancer . Radiation is a modern version of another very old fo rm of treating cancer: burning the tumor. Cauter y, or burning, was a preva lent tech­ nique as long ago as ancient Egypt and Greece-Hippocrates used a siz­ zling iron-but even then it was controve rsial and belie ved by man y to do more harm than good. Like surge ry, radiat ion is a local treatment. It is used on about half of cancer patients, despit e the fa ct that it can defini­ tively be said to \"cure\" onl y a scant number of types of the disease such as early Hodg kin's disease (lymphatic cancer ), and at times testicular ,"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"228 A CON FLIC T OF MEDIC AL OP INI ON cervical, and prostate cancer . Its principal role is to keep tumors from recurring, but it does not seem to affect the remission rate or long-term survival significant ly. 24 Radiat ion is frequent ly used as a palliat ive treatment to alleviate pain, especiall y in lung, esophag eal, pancreatic, breast, and colon cancer . It is often combined with surgery despite the fact that tests have generally shown it made no apparent favorable difference .ZS Radiation can, however, cause temporary remis sions , a fact that induced \"radium fever\" around the turn of the century and led to its widespread medical use by the 1920s. Because it was already well known several years after the discovery ofX-rays in 1895 that the invisible beams caused severe burns, radium pioneer Dr. Emil Grubbe surmised it might be medically applied to cancer ous tumors.U • Serendipit ously, Dr. Antoine-Henr i Becquer el, a noted French physi­ cist and early radium resear cher , discovered that the uranium ore called pitchblende emit ted comp arable rays, and Marie Curie and her husband isolated radium from it. When Becquerel carried a tube of radium in his vest pocket to a lecture in London fo r a few weeks, he noticed a conse­ quent irritation on his abdomen growi ng worse and harming the tissue. Experiment s were soon conducted putting radium inside screens and fo ­ cusing the beam on skin cancer . It did kill the cancer , but exposure to the radioa ctive element also caused leukemia, cancer of the blood. Both Marie Curie, the discoverer of radium who coined the word radioactivity, and her daug hter died as a result of their exposure to the seem ingly magic element that glowed in the darkY Fully half the cases of cancer from exposure to radioact ive materials at that time occurred among doct ors and tec hnicians. Radiolog ists began to die from cancer in large numbers by the 1920s. The AMA attri buted the deaths to an epidemic of commu­ nicable diseases .2H But by now industry had caught radium fever. Popular radium prod­ ucts included doll's ey es, fish bait, gunsight s, and the lids and handles of chamber pots.2� Radioact ive fluoroscopes were the rage in shoe stores for measuring fe et with X -ray vis ion, and doctors bathed the faces of teenag­ ers with acne in the magic rays.3° Companies produced chocolate bars infused with radium, along with radioact ive \"tonics\" and milk sugar .31 Companies manuf actured watches and instruments brushed wit h radium paint. About 4,000 \"luminizer s,\" mostly women, applied the novelty in factories by \"lip-po inting, \" using their lips and tongues to shape the brushes to a fine point.

By 1946 a New England Journal of Medic ine study found that radiol ogist s died of leuke­ mia eight times more frequent ly than other physicians. Studies published in the 1970s showed that childr en given X-rays for ringworm (a scalp disease) developed six times as man y cancers as nonir radiated childrenY But in 1945 destiny held other designs. The horror of the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nag asaki created a massi ve public relations problem fo r atomic energ y. The result was a spirited campaig n by the milit ary to give radiation a posit ive image, and \"our friend, the atom\" prese ntly donned a benig n medical fa ce. As the AMA claimed in 194 7, \"Medicall y applied atomic science has already saved more lives than were lost in the explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasak i.\"44 The chairman of the Atomic Energy Commis sion was also a trustee of Memorial Sloan­ Kette ring Hospit al, and promoted an aggressive strateg y to hype the vir­ tues and hide the perils of nuclear ener gy.45 In the 1950s Pres ident Eisen hower directed the Atomic Energy Com­ mission to \"keep them [the public] confused \" about radiation, while Cornelius P. \"Dusty\" Rhoads, director of Memorial Hospit al, publi cly proclaimed the harmlessness of aboveground nuclear testing, minimized the hazards of radiation exposure, and celebrated its newfound medical marvels.46 The subsequent cover-up of the dang ers of radiation by gover nment and military officials has been well documented decades after the fact. The medical cover-up has taken longer to leak outY For most of its shor t life, nuclear medicine has been cons idered by the medical mainstream as harmless at worst.4H The same negative infor­ mation withheld from the public was also to some degree cloaked from the prof ession, which was often ignorant, though sometimes willfull y so, of the data on the harmful healt h impa cts of irradiation. A casual attitude toward radiation' s dangers has prev ailed, and those doct ors and scientists who have spok en out against it have often been prof essionally stunted through the denial of grant s or penalized with the loss of their posit ions .49 Acco rding to some estimates, around 78,000 people a year get cancer from medical and dental X-rays.

It birt hed a substantial and cos tly medical resear ch inf rast ruct ure, weav­ ing a web of close ties among univer sities, resear ch hospitals, drug com­ panies, and the governm ent.73 The rising use of RCT s fo r cancer th erapies par alleled the expansive burst of chemother apy. But the abst ract purity of the scientific method soon became fund amentall y comprom ised by other exigenci es. The go ld standard of RCT s is the placebo-c ontr olled, dou ble-blind, randomized clinical tri al in which a control group given a placebo is compared against the \"arm\" (branch group) receiving the real dr ug. In princi ple, neit her subj ect nor doctor knows which arm is getti ng the real medicine, and the control group ser ves as a baseline for comparison.

The word allopath was act uall y coined by Sam uel Hahnemann, the fo under of homeopat hy.

A local bleeder arrived who prom ptly relie ved Wa shing ton of about fo ur­ teen ounces of blood.6 Still ill in the morning, Wa shing ton sent for his doctor , who soon summoned two other physi cians.

The wid espread medical use of toxic miner als and chemicals dat es back to at least 1500 in Eur ope. When the scourge of syp hilis rava ged the continent, the only practi tioner s having any apparent meas ure of success were the su rgeons . They had adopt ed the use of mercur y fr om Arab phy­ sicians who wer e enthr alled with alchem y, the myst ical ma rriag e of chem­ ist ry and philos ophy. Al chem y began capt ivat ing Eur ope in the thi rteenth cent u ry, and for three centuries it would preoccup y those seeking to un­ lock nat ure 's great mysteri es. The European surgeons made past es contai ning me rcu ry, which would temporaril y alle viate sym ptoms of syph ilis because of it s antibacterial ac­ tion . The su rgeons tr iumphant ly heralded th eir appar ent cures, claiming to tra nsf orm poisons int o medi cines by their alchemical magic. Any therapy for syphilis other than me rcury was prompt ly outlaw ed, and the commerce of apothecaries prospered greatly off the new business. When the legendary sixteenth-century Swiss-German doctor Paracelsus came on the scene, he fo rever changed medical practice wit h his passi onate embrace of the mineral re medies.

The new generation of progressive surgeons were probably bliss full y igno­ rant of the damag e they were doing. By the end of the sixteenth century, medical chemist s all over Europe were feve rishly exper imenting with ev­ ery metal or mineral known to man, reacting it with other chemicals, turn­ ing it into salt s or oils, and then admin ist ering it to a patien t.\"14 The excruci ating eff ects of the chemical medic ines perf ormed an odd double du ty. Since sy philis in par tic ular and disease in general were widel y belie ved to be manif estations of sin, the horri fic effects of the mineral ther apies served as both remed y and retri but ion. Man y doc tors were re­ luctant even to tre at the immoral affl iction of syp hilis, though prominent aristocratic fa milies such as Italy' s Bo rgias beg ged for relief . \"I n Rome this kind of illness is very part ial to the priests, and especiall y to the rich­ est of them ,\" Ben venut o Cellini coyly wrot e.15 The advent of the controve rsial chemical medicines, which were al­ ready deepening the schism wit h plant medicines, further ru pt ured the medical prof ession it self . The der ivat i on of the word quack originated with herbalist s who de scri bed do ctors using mercury and mineral poi­ sons as \"Q uac ksalv ers\" fo r their affinit y for qui cksilver. 1 6 Even other phy­ sicians held these mineral medicines to be the most odio us expression of qua ckery, and dragged fe llo w doctors into star chamber s-secr e tive tri­ bunals acting as kangaroo courts-to seek censure against th eir brethren 's mercury madness. Nonet heless, by the late 15 00s most surgeons were ent hus iast icall y ad opting the mineral poisons. They added arsenic, lead, and copper to their armamentarium of mercury and antim ony. Although they st ill relied heavily on plant s as well, the minerals brought irrefutabl y bold results, and the early adopt ers energet ical ly used them to induce the vom iting, purging, and intense diuretic expu lsion th at they belie ved were curative . Pat ients , awed by the raw power of the new remedies, eag erly sought them out. By 16 00 clever tink erers tr ansmuted me rcury int o its modified fo rm of calomel and applied it with abandon.

By the end of the cent ur y, royalty was being treated with heroic doses of mercury and wit h pills made of gold leaf and turpent ine. Mer cury was the treatment of choice fo r sy philis, as well as for ecz ema. Calomel quick ly became the standard prescription for purges and launched a fr enz y of mineral medicines that would persist for th ree centuries among allop athic doctors. Paracelsus himself had been conservative in his use of the deadly silvery met al, whose very mining the ancient Romans had fe ared enough to forb id. Even the fa ther of chemical medicine would most likely have been ap palled at its gleeful proliferation, a trend that would continue unabated in their journey from Europe to the therapeutic repertoire of the distant British colo­ nies soon to become the United St ates. Arm ed wit h heavy metals and the knife, doct ors in the United St ates discounted the body' s abilit y to cure itself and int erv ened ag gressive ly. Dr .

However, establishing legal fr aud required dem onstrating the intent to swin dle, which is dif ficult to prove .

With the new royal act in place, the physicians pulled rank in the hier a rchy of practitioner s . · l'hey sued the surgeons, the surgeons sued the barbers, and all of them savaged the lay practitioners for pract icing medicine without a license .3 Ho wever , as fate would decree, Ki ng Henr y VIII was an amat eur 281"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"282 MONEY, POWER, AND CANCER devotee of herbal medicine, and his Parliament countered with a radical \"Act\" legitimizing the practice of lay herbalism in 15 42 . \"It shall be lawful fo r every person being the King' s subject, having knowledge and experience of the nature of Herbs, Roots and Wa ters ... to practice, use and minister ... according to their cunning, experience and knowledge in any of the diseases ... without suit, vexation, trouble, penalt y, or loss of th eir goods .\"4 The Ki ng' s Act did not stop there .

But the ba ttle pitting doc tors ag ain st \"Empir ick s and unlicensed Pract isers\" was fa r from over. By the 18 30 s in the Un ited St ates, heroic medicine was losing fa vor with the public. Al lopaths appreh ensively watch ed their legal monopoly melt away as states successively aut ho ri zed the budding pluralism of al­ ternative medical practi ces. For the fir st time, empir ic practit ioner s gained legal fo oting equal to their allopathic counterparts, al lowing them to sue to collect their fe es. Al lopathic doctors , now str ipped suddenl y of the legal armor of th eir monopo ly, fo und themsel ves vulnera ble to intense economic competit ion.r ' Homeopat hy had begun its steep ascent, int roducing a complex, so­ phisticat ed, and har mless phar macopo eia. Homeopat hs had unde rtaken a rigorous and elabor at e system of \"pr ovi ng s,\" administ ering doses of a plet hora of nat ural products to obser ve the medical symptoms they cau sed, then preparing infin itesimal doses of these same substances to tre at those affl ictions. The therapy became popular not only with the public, but also among the social elite, including the cle rgy, intellectuals, the business com­ munit y, and the press. It also fo und a vast constituency among women, often including the very wives of the allopaths. 7 The sit uat ion became dou­ bly irritating to the doctors when homeopat hy beg an to attract numer ous member s fr om th eir own fo ld, including prominent phy sicians. By 19 00 as man y as a sixth of homeopaths came fr om allopat hic medical schools. Also thriving was the vast ar ray of herbal heal ers gro wing out of the movement of \"Indian doctors\" and \"r oot doc tors \" who had adapted the extensive Native American botanical pharmac opoeia.

As Paul St arr wrote , \"It was the aim of the Th ompsonians, whose declared sy mpathies were with the laboring classes, to overth row this tyranny of priests, lawyers and do ctors . The genius of the Thompsonian sys tem was to express a protest against the dominant order in its therapeutic as well as its polit ical idea s.\" 9 When Harry Hoxsey lat er railed against the \"H ig h Priest s of Medicine ,\" he was fir mly rooted in a vital Am erican populist tr adition. By 18 50 Thompsonianism gave way to the ri se of the Eclectics, whose fir st medical schools had now taken hold. By the 18 80s the Eclect ics had over 10 ,000 practitioners, about on a par with homeopat hy. De spit e th eir smaller number s compared to the 10 0,000 al lopaths, th e emp iric ranks were undenia bly draining away a gre at deal of busines s.10 It was in response to this com pelling econ omic th reat th at the Al neri­ can Medical As sociation arose in 18 47 . The profession env isioned a na­ tional org aniz ation as the solution to its cr isis. Under the leader ship of New Yo rk's Dr. Nathan Smit h Davis for the next fifty years, the stated purpose of the AMA was to \"i mprove medical educat ion,\" and the AMA branded as a quack any pract itioner not having a \"scient ific,\" that is, allo­ pathic, medical tra ining. 11 The AMA banned the publicat ion of homeo­ pat hic case hist ories fr om its medical jo ur nals. It fo rbade medical doctors to conduct consultations with homeopaths, and bar red them fr om medical societies alt ogetherY The subtext was to dele gitimize the empir ics and stave off any prospect of vigorous competit ion. As one nervous al lopat h wrote, \"Q ua ckery occasions a lar ge pecun iar y loss to us . The United St at es must be regarded as the very elysium of quacker y. They assume an equal­ ity, and by fr aud and deception, too frequently tr iumph and grow rich, where wise and bet ter men scarcely escape starvation .\"13 Th e AMA rat ionale was that impr oving medical education would re­ new public confid ence and distinguish \"s cient ific medicine\" fr om quack ­ ery. The public, however, was singula rly disint erested in this transparent subterfuge against fr ee mar ket fo rces.

What temporaril y restored public confidence in the doctors was not a reconst ruction of medical edu­ cation, but a shift in therapeut ics . De eply influenced by homeopa thy, the allopat hs beg an to relinquish bloodlet ting, diminish th eir heroic doses, and rely increasing ly on empiric remedie s. 15 As one all opat hic practi tioner wrote, \"F or more than half a centu ry, th ere has been a decided mov ement in the profession in opposition to an indi scriminate heroic tre at ment.

Fearing a loss of contr ol, the allo paths' response was to unify as a so v­ ereig n profession in a national org anization, the AMA , to cont rol medical licensure . Owing to the prolif eration of empiric sect s and the egalitarian nat ure of post- Jack sonian de mocrac y, most state medical licensure la ws had been dismantled by the mid- ninet eenth cent ury. Be cause a mere di­ ploma admit ted a practi tioner into the medical mar ket place, the AMA fo cus ed its efforts on creating a secondary system of state and ult imat ely nat ional lic ensing boards to regain control and also stanch the excessive number s of do ctors flooding the mar ket place and depressing inc ome.

The doctrine of in loco parentis (\"in place of the pa rent\") gui ded the FDA and other public healt h reg ula­ tory bodies to enforce mandat ory medical treatme nts whether patie nts wanted them or not.

The storming of the NIH and concu rrent public resistance to the doctrine of in loco parentis radically changed the way that new drugs are eva luated by the FDA, resulting in \"c ompassio nate care\" and \"f ast track\" gu idelines. Where it used to take up to fifteen years for a drug to complet e testing requir ement s and gain ap prova l, now the AI DS drug AZT and a number of other s got through much more qui ckly. A fr esh precedent was estab­ lished to permit do ctors to give patient s experimental drugs even when they did not know whether they were effective. They could dispense them in the hope they would be beneficial, and watch ed the pat ie nts very closely for any ad verse effects on \"f ast track\" acce ss. \"T hat' s what alt erna tive tre at ment s ar e,\" Cat herine suggest s . \"W e cannot verify the effec ts when the resear ch is not complete. The resear ch becomes par amount. \" When Mary Ann Richardson approached Mildred Nelson about per ­ fo rming research, Mildred referred her to Cather ine, who joined the OAM proj ect as a co-in vestigator . In the spring of 19 98, an OAM team consist­ ing of Richardson, an epidemio logist, and a biostatist ician met Catherine at the Tij uana clinic to begin a \"hi storical cohort study. \" They sel ected the roster of cancer patie nts fr om the first quarter of 19 92-a five-ye ar mar ker-and began the tedious task of ascert aining what has happened to these people since . The review of these ap proxi mat ely 15 0 cancer cases is a very prelimi­ nary step and cannot reve al anything definit ive . It could provi de potential leads by finding posit ive outc omes, and it does dip a toe in the resear ch waters whose ripples may lead to more in-dept h testing. After almost se v­ enty -five years, the fe deral gove rnment is at last fo rmall y investig ating Hoxsey and other alt ernative cancer ther apies. Hoxsey is, after all, the preeminent herbal tr eatment for cancer , and its social history and widespread use make it a prime cand idat e for re­ sear ch.

The number s alone justify scientific inve stiga­ tion. But what exactly does such an eva luation involve ? The step seems to symb olize a new era in medical resear ch, but what are the real chances of scientific object ivity and social fa irness? For such a test to have credibilit y, the resear ch desig n must be capable of wit hstanding scient ific rigor.

Mildred Nelson often turns away pat ie nts who have had prior chemother apy because th eir immune response is so severely impaired th at the Hoxsey tre at ment can no longer help th em. There is also a fundame ntal conflict of medical paradig ms a tissu e. A rev ealing parallel is the difficult y of test ing tra ditional Chinese medic ine by conventi onal standards. Classical Chinese medicine posit s the exist­ ence of chi, a vital lif e ene rgy somewhat analag ous to the vis medicatrix naturae. The basis of acupuncture, for ex ample, is to invigorate the per son' s chi by using small needles to stimulate a grid of meridians at hig hly spe­ cific poi nts relat ing to bodily sy stems. We stern medicine does not accept the exi stence of chi. Te sts have validated medical effects on these ene rgy meridians, which do not correspond to any recognized nerve , circ ula­ tory, or other phy siol ogical pa thway, but no one has yet been able to isolat e or quantify chi itself in a scienti fic sense .8 Simil arly, because im­ munolog y is a new and poo rly under stood realm, even defining which effects of the Hoxsey tonic to me asure is a question, alt hough there are some accepted ma rkers . An other major problem stems fr om the fa ct that classical protocols for medical testing are desig ned mainly for ev aluating synth etic drugs . Generally these test s seek to isolat e a single \"a ctive ingred ie nt\" th eo ret i ­ cally responsible fo r an effect based on a specific molecular mechanism . Something lik e the Hoxsey tonic has multiple ing redient s acting in syn­ ergy through potentiall y very complex mechanisms. As Gar Hild enbrand illu strat es, \"W e' re not going to know a mole cular mechanism . The hu­ man genome hasn' t been sufficient ly mapped yet.

The AMA was sing ular ly adept at positioning itself as a pr otector of the public healt h by invoking the sanc­ tit y of the doc tor -pat ient relationship while neat ly inserting itself as gatek eeper to the medical mar ket place. Because of its unique prof essional sover eig nty, the AMA remarkably managed to limit emerging corporate medical industries to outlying sectors such as the drug business and medical -supply compan ies. By the 19 70s, how­ ever, as Starr wrote, \"Enormous increases in cost seemed ever more certain; corresponding improvements in health ever more doubt ful.\"19 The conse­ quences were heightened critical scrutiny and government intervention. As annual national healt h care costs sky rocketed fr om $13 billion to $7 1 billion bet ween 1950 and 19 70, the critical condition of medical eco­ nomic s presented an irresistible target fo r comm ercial medic ine.10 Large corporate vent ures seized the opp ort unit y, promising ef ficient business management to control costs. The result was the ado ption of Healt h Mai ntenance Org ani zations (HMOs) . \"The organization culture of medicine ,\" wrote Starr, \"used to be domi­ nat ed by the ideals of prof essionalism and voluntar ism, which sof tened the under lying acquisi tive ac tivi ty.

Dr . William Fair, the Memor ial Sloa n-Kettering urologist who has suc­ cessfully manag ed his own cancer using alternat ive thera pies, envi si ons th e rein vention of cancer th erapeutics. He proposes not so much curing as controlling cancer, much as diab etes is held in check.70 It' s a course very diff erent from the sing le-minded assault to kill every last cancer cell in the bod y that has characteri zed allopat hic tre atment for the past hundred year s. Dr . Fair' s model hear kens back to a fundame ntal conflict of medical opinion fr om a century ag o bet ween Louis Past eur and his scient i fic rival Be scha mps.

A healt hy terr ain, he propos ed, def eat s patho­ gens or holds them har mlessl y in check in a dy namic balance. In other words, as Dr . Fair implies and Hoxsey and the empir ics have said, the medium may be the messag e in biolog y as well . People can live with cancer , by using strategy over brute fo rce, by fit ting together the exte ndable se gment s of advancing kn owl edge, by enhanc ing the terr ain. Or, as a doctor fr iend once remar ked as only a doctor co uld, perhaps our purpose as human bei ngs on Ea rth is to build immunit ies. It is only ve ry recently that medicine has entered the dawning ag e of biolog y. In this light, it is unsurpr ising that the drug industry has fa iled to find a mag ic bullet fo r cancer . An swer s will more likely lie in the vastly complex ecolog y of the biol ogical re alm, where the cancer industry has not been look ing. Rather than magic bullets, the most promising dir ec­ tions are toward strengt hening imm unit y and revi talizing the terra in. Nontoxic custom ized approaches may ultimately pr eva il fo r what man y now belie ve is not a single disease but a complex of man y kinds intima tely bound up with envi ronment, diet , lif est yl e, and personal belief sy stems. If there is one thing to count on, it' s that any scientific th eory will event uall y be proved wrong. Most gre at discoveries have come fr om empirical obser vers . Much of the contribution of the rationalist or allo­ pathic school has been to syste matize those insig hts and codify them int o sys tems acces sible to other practit ioner s. What seems sure is that medicine in the ag e of biolog y enter s the domain of vis medicatrix natw·ae. Perhaps something lik e the Hoxsey tonic and Dr . Bu rzy nski 's ant ineoplast ons and the Gerson diet are the true medical biot echnolog ies. Alterna tive medicine runs deep and wide in the Ame rican psych e. There is growing recog nition that medicine' s dest in y is a collabor ative one, a ret urn to the plur alism that existed just a century ag o.

For the past three years, Mildred has had serial healt h prob­ lem s-bronch itis, pneumo nia, a broken ri b, the pains of aging. I passed some time in the waiting room, look ing out across the ordin arily brown hills of Tij uana now saturated to a verdant green by the punishing rains of El Nino. A cluster of patient s sat around a TV monit or watching our Hoxsey film, pla ying on a continuous loop all morning. I wat ched the patient s wat ching the film. Heads shook at the high dr ama of Ha rry Hoxsey battling Morris Fis hbein. Eyes moistened at the victories of ot her cancer patients, at Mildr ed' s fie rce compassion. Hope filled the air . I went next door to vi sit Mi ldred . She was resting in bed, looking very fra il, slipping below a hundr ed poun ds. It was unnerving and painful to see her so debil itated; I was accust omed to the zestful woman who walked through wa lls. Like Han y Hoxsey , she has lived three lives in one. The strain was fina lly showing. For all her loving strictness with her patients, she herself makes a lousy patient. It was all anyone could do to get her to eat. We chatted awh ile, and Mildred was as lucid and combustible as ever, making big plans fo r the clinic. She had been shuttling back and fo rth to the respite of her Oreg on cattle ranch , her other gre at passion and the onl y place she could get proper rest away from the stress of the clinic. She was look ing fo rward to calving season on the land. \"I grew up the oldest of seven children ,\" Mildred recal led. \"My fa ther was a rancher west of Forth Wo rth , Te xas . I started to school on horse­ back, and all the years gro wing up, I might not have the horse I want ed, but I was never without a hor se. In the year s that went by, mot her got sick and I had the respon sibilit y of the children, but I still didn' t lik e anyth ing to do wit h the hou se. I wanted to be out and be around the horses and the ca ttl e. I became quit e accustomed to that type of lif e. \"B y the ti me I was ten years old, we were in the De pressi on. By the time I got out of hig h school , with se ven ki ds there wasn 't a lot of money , but a neighbor that had lived near by had been in a discussion with a fr iend of the fa mi ly, and they had decided, because Mom had been sick, th at I would mak e a very good nur se. I was asked to go to Fort Wo rth to drive. I'd go do wn dr iving, and when we'd get about halfw ay there, she said, 'Oh, do you know why we're coming dow n?' And I said, 'No, I'm not coming for anything- I'm just dr iving you .' And she said, 'Oh no, we'r e going to see if we can get nurse' s tr ain ing.

When I showed the let ter to Dad, he said, 'Why don' t you spend the mone y for something you want to do? Yo u will never go with this disc ipline to be a nurse .' And I said, 'No, I'll do it. ' He said, 'You won 't last six weeks. Yo u have not had that type of discipline or that type of a lif e. Yo u might as well spend your money for something you want. Yo u won't last six week s.'

I am al ways curi ­ ous about how Mildred sees the state of cancer , witnessing as much of it as she does. Cancer used to be an old per son' s affl iction, she said, but now it' s striki ng younger people all the tim e-t eenag ers, lit tle ch ildren . For the first time, she sees breast cancer in very young girls, and lot s more mela noma in gener al. The disease seems more vir ulent. People are diag­ nosed and they're dead in six mon ths-th at sel dom used to happen. Per ­ haps, she spec ulated, peopl e's imm une sy stems are so weakened by toxic pollution, stress, and bad diet that they just go fa ster . Cancer is rising in Mex ico, too, and the country is not prepared fo r it. More Mexicans are coming to the clinic these da ys . It' s bad. Mildr ed confir med her commitment to Cat herine to fo llo w throug h on the Hoxsey research, th oug h, ever tough and can ny, she exp ressed the same gu ardedness that has allo wed her to survive doing Hoxsey all this time. It was a dif fe rent worl d, I sugges te d, when she lef t the coun try in 19 63 . Medic ine seems to be changing, more open to alt ernatives, more inclusive . Cautiously she agr eed, wh ile maintaining her insomniac vigi­ lance against the tr eatment' s ex ploit ation or misu se. Mildred' s concerns about commer ci al exploi tation are va lid in today' s medical market place. There are already several Hoxsey -clone fo rmu las being sold that are not the Hoxsey fo rm ula, one of which is improperly prepared in alcoh ol. Catherine Sal veson helped Mildred obtain a tr ade­ mar k on the Hoxsey name, and supplier s of these other tonics are being notified to cease using \"Ho xsey\" in th eir promotions .3 In the late 19 50 s, after losing the final court battles, Harr y Hoxsey threatened to release the tonic as a patent medi cine without any claims for cancer . This scenario has been enacted more recently by Essiac, the Canadian herbal cancer reme dy.

Through Cather ine' s academic position at Or eg on Healt h Sciences Unive rsit y, the nur sing school authorized her to initiate medi cal res earch on Hoxsey. It seems eminent ly ap propriate th at the tre at ment th at has been shouldered by a nurse should come back through a nursing org ani­ zation. \"The nurses are more open-min ded,\" Mildred commented . \"Of cour se, they are the ones who are beside th e patient, all hours of th e day and night go ing through this thing, and with the fa milies. I think reall y they have a much broader scope of the hear tbreak and everyth ing that goes with it than even the doctor s.\"5 As a fe llow nur se, Catherine has st udied Mildred Nelson closel y. \"Mildred is not practicing as nurses are lic ensed to pract ice.

Mildred does not fo llo w any one' s ru les except her own . She doesn' t prac­ tice under anybody' s authorit y. In th at reg ard, she does not practice nurs­ ing, but she was tr ained as a nurse and she started as a nur se, and nur sing is about caring.

She calls herself a nur se. To my mind, even thoug h she doesn' t ha ve a legal, prof essional lic ense, she' s as much of a nurse as any one who' s ever been tra ined as a nurse and who cares for people. \"In the thirt y-five year s she has been in Mex ico, she has per sonall y monitored and been involved in the care of thousands of peop le. She has pa rtici pated in th e care of all of these people, and has insight and under ­ standing about cancer , and she does a lot by her in stin cts . She has also watched people die and get we ll, and, as a compassi onate healer paying at tent ion, she is commi tted to trying anyth ing. She would try a litany of treatment s of anyth ing that she could get her hands on that she thought would help people. When she finds out it' s not helpful, she stops it. The be drock under neat h all her commit ment is the tonic. Everybody gets the tonic. Be yond the to nic, she is always look ing for how to craft a treat­ ment for each indiv idual. If that means being woken up in the middle of the night to talk to some body about their nausea, she' s there. I've never met anyo ne as a healer who has her level of personal knowl edge and just plain commitment. She has been on twenty-f our-hour call forever, and you can' t ask for much more. \"I love Mildred Nelson . Even if th ere were no Hoxsey or if Hoxsey were gon e, I have come to know and love this woman as a member of my fa mi ly. She has inspired me. She has given me courage . She has helped me le arn how to stand up for myself as I watched her and what she' s gone through . She has taught me about compassion .\" As I sat with Mildred, a line of pat i ents awaiting the external medi­ cines was sta rting to loop down to the trailer , where she would tre at them from her chair in the living room, a bowl of Pine-Sol by her side. I ag reed to come bac k th at ev ening, and returned to the waiting room to visit with more patients. On the prominent black onyx fir eplace in the center of the waiting room was a new metal plaque.

The sentiment is reciproca l: Mildr ed lives fo r her pat ie nts . \"Pr obabl y the most imp ortant thing, \" Mildr ed said, \"is the fa ct that I do care about them, and th eir getting well is very impo rtant to me and to their fa milies.

Gwen Sc ott descr ibed her fir st visit there . \"T o be there when people are told that their cancer has gone and see the emot ions of others and fe el it: Yo u just need heaps of hankies. There was an Am erican lady who was very loud and very noi sy. She was henpec king the husband and the son quite a bit, and it was not a lady that I normall y would talk to, but I fo und her sit ting quiet ly on the bed. From having made such a noise to being such a quiet person, she reall y needed me to go and talk to her at th at time when she was quiet. She was waiting for her fir st thr ee-mont h re­ sult, and it dawned on me then that all the noise and bic kering were her way of coping with her concerns. \"She was sit ting there quiet ly waiting for the result s fr om her first scan. Be cause she was so lar ge, when she did walk int o the lounge at the clinic later on, it created an incident. The whole room sat up. There was nobody ta lk ing. It was really quiet, and there was this huge lady standing in the middle of the room with tear s in her ey es, saying, 'They've got it. They've got my cancer . My cancer is reduced in siz e.' \"J ust to be there and see th at woman and see that fa mily and see th eir emotions, that was that fir st trip for me. There was one girl who said, 'I f it meant my getting cancer all over again just to be here, I would choose to ha ve cancer all over ag a in.\" ' Catherine Sal veson sees Mildred Nelson 's Bio Medical Center as an expression of a lar ger pa ttern in the tr ansf ormation of Am erican medi­ cine. \"P art of the rise of alt erna tive medicine has to do wit h the fa ct that women are the ones who decide th e hea lth care of the fa mily . It' s the mama and it' s the wif e who pick the doctor , who pick the healt h- care plan, who mak e the decisions about what you 're go ing to get when you have a bad cold, whether you get echinacea or whether you get Advi l. Part of what' s happening with alterna tive medicine is that women in gen­ eral are being empowered regarding th eir role in healt h care. \"In most medical schools now, there' s gender pari ty, about 45 per cent women. Wo men are more open-minded about alt er nat ives than men are. They just think differently. The acceptance of al terna tives in to medicine is also happen ing because there' s been a fe mini zation of medicine. \"When Hoxsey was doing bat tle, there were no women' s fa ces on the wall at the AMA.

Ask any gerontologist. They'd much rather take care of an old man than an old woman. An old man will do what he's told. An old lady often won't. She'll do what she damn well pleases and what her neighbor does and what she heard about in church. And what's cheap. Mildred is a woman. I think part of why Hoxsey has endured is the myth of Mildred. Everybody had to walk past her desk. She would look up and look them in the eye, even if she never said anything to them. Those piercing eyes were like tossing somebody a life rope. She was like that silver thread, that placental cord saying, 'No! You don't have to get dead.' The fact that she was a woman and a mother mattered.\" When I returned that evening to see Mildred, she was propped up in bed watching a University of Te xas football game with the sound turned off. A fierce little dog named Trouble sat protectively by her side, growl­ ing whenever I leaned in too close. The dawning of 1996 marked the fiftieth anniversary of Mildred's \"working with Hoxsey,\" and 1998 clocked her thirty-fifth year in Mexico, a North American woman in a Mexican man's world operating a \"quack\" cancer clinic. Since going to Tijuana, she has treated upwards of 30,0 00 patients. How does she look back on her life work? \"Working with the clinic, getting it to where it is today, has been a rewarding experience that I wouldn't want to give up or trade for anything else. It's been lots of hard work. There are heartaches with it every day, but there's also daily re­ wards. Most people forget to count their blessings, and then you see how many there have been through the years. When you look back at the number of people that are here today that would not have been, there isn't an awful lot that could make you wish that you had not done what you have done for a lifetime.\" I once asked Mildred what she looked forward to. \"Getting as many people well as I can. We were not put here to be petty or be selfish. What we do for somebody else is the important thing in getting through this life.\" As a nurse, Mildred also holds a perspective on her relationship with her patients distinct from that of most doctors. \"Much of the time, the patient and the doctor do not have a good relationship. Doctors are afraid to have a relationship with the patient. Most of them are aware that, go­ ing down the route that they do, they'll lose the patient. They don't want the pain of losing a friend or somebody that they're really close to. As a result, the patient is very aware that he is avoiding them in many ways."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"The Other Heroic Medicine 349 When the patient would like to talk to him, discuss different things with him-their beliefs, their fears, their anxieties-the doctor says, 'Good morning, how are you? ' and he's gone. He tells the nurse to give them something, and the patients are very uncomfortable with it. \"I think doctors should know a little more about their patients: their thoughts, their wishes-what the patient wants, what they're entitled to. In most places today, they're given a number and they're treated as though they were a number. This isn't all of them, but the majority. Especially in your areas where there's a lot of research going on, the patient becomes the statistic and they know it. They feel it. They don't like it. Th ey are individuals. They are interested in living. Instead of the doctors saying, 'Well, you've got thirty days to live, is there anything we can do for you? ,' they could have a little compassion and a little thought for the patient, and make life much easier in the end. \"If doctors had this type of relationship with the patient, and found out what pleasure it is to accomplish something that everybody else said that you can't do, then yes, they'd all enjoy it. The patient would be hap­ pier, and the doctor's happier. To day, they're patients. To morrow they're not patients; they're people who are friends and relatives. I think that there are more people in the medical profession who are becoming aware of the fact that they are really missing something in their care for pa­ tients. Whether it's cancer surgery or whatever, they seem to be afraid to have a real doctor-patient relationship for fear they're going to get hurt. When it comes to hurting, we hurt every day.\" I returned to the Bio Medical Center a few months later. It was calv­ ing season and Mildred was at the ranch, recuperating and overseeing the mass spring birthing. Her sister Liz Jonas was now presiding. Liz stepped in to manage the clinic in 1997 during Mildred's increasingly extended sick leaves. Another open-hearted Te xan, Liz did not expect to be operat­ ing her sister's cancer clinic. She is not a medical person, but does have a strong business background as a business administrator and CPA for the Tandy Corporation, owner of Radio Shack. She has also managed the family affairs for many years. \"I was meant to be here,\" Liz told me philosophically.7 It has been challenging, since she commutes back to Te xas often, trying to keep work and family together. She believes that ultimately the clinic will return to the United States. In the waiting room, the anxiety over Mildred's absence was palpable. A hushed muttering passed through the room in periodic waves, wonder­ ing whether she would return. Just how sick was she? What would happen to the clinic and to their medical lifeline?"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"350 MO N EY , POWER , AND CA NCER Many years before, while making the film, we asked Mildred about the future ofHoxs ey. At the time, she'd already had two strokes, and the fate of the treatment was a real concern. \"The future of the Hoxsey treat­ ment? Of all those people out there, there has got to be somebody that will want to do it, to give part of themselves to take care of people who are sick. That person will come along while I'm physically able to train 'em and teach 'em. When the day comes, I will teach 'em. So that isn't a worry to us. If that doesn't happen, then I'm sorry it is lost, and it wasn't intended to go on.\" Mildred did train several people, but they didn't stay. One set up a competing clinic; another gave up and went back to the States. A New Zealand physican who studied with her extensively was ultimately blocked from practice abroad. There is no successor, and much of the profound reservoir of empirical experience Mildred has gained over fifty years will go with her. The clinic will probably survive, at least for a while. Liz Jonas is a very competent businesswoman dedicated to her sister's legacy. There is a strong core of highly competent doctors and staff who have worked with the program a long time. But Mildred Nelson, like Harry Hoxsey, is one of a kind. \"I don't know what the future ofHoxsey is,\" Catherine Salveson sighs. \"Mildred Nelson has encouraged me to go ahead and do the research. The future of Hoxsey is very much tied to this research because, if any­ thing were to happen to Mildred, the forces that are currently in play are very unpredictable. If the research is in place, then it doesn't matter as much what happens with the rest of the clinic and the infrastructure that she has built in Mexico. There will be a second infrastructure, the re­ search infrastructure, that will contain the treatment. \"There's no question in my mind that this tonic helps people,\" Catherine adds. \"I also know that the kind of person who goes against their doctor and who goes to a 'Third World' country to a 'quack' clinic to take a weird tonic is an unusual person. Many people come from a support system, whether it's a spiritual support system of being a Mor­ mon, Jehovah's Witness, Amish, or a Seventh-day Adventist, or simply a person who is determined to live or has a relative who's determined to keep them alive. \"I also know that these herbs have value in helping people who are fighting cancer. I believe that people who had cancer are alive in part because they took this tonic. That's why I'm so committed to doing this research and helping bring this treatment back to the United States so it can be available to people more easily.\" If the therapy were validated, a vigorous alternative medicine commu-"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"I he Other Her oic Medic ine 35 1 nity now exists to carry it on. Intense interest exists among the burgeon­ ing numbers of naturopathic physicians, who are already using Hoxsey­ like formulas and studying the medicines. IfHoxsey is lost, it certainly won't be the first time a promising alter­ native cancer therapy has succumbed to medical politics. Most of the hundred or so such therapies over the course of the twentieth century vanished with their founders. The shadow side of \"scientific medicine\" has been its recurring pattern of condemnation without investigation. Clearly, conventional cancer treatments have an important place in medicine and save many lives. But a hundred years from now; medicine will likely come to regard some of these methods the way it now remem­ bers the use of mercury and bloodletting. Scientific theories are provi­ sional, based on steep learning curves and embedded in the temper of the times. Dr. Abigail Zuger recently wrote a medical meditation of sorts in the New Ytn·k Times contemplating the hundredth anniversary of the 1899 Me1·ck Manual, the \"venerable\" medical textbook which at that time rec­ ommended many highly toxic drugs that today are museum-quality hor­ rors. \"We have harnessed our own set of poisons for medical treatment; in a hundred years a discussion of cancer chemotherapy may read as chill­ ingly as endorsements of strychnine for tuberculosis and arsenic for dia­ betes do today. \"H Yet although allopathic medicine has largely failed against chronic killers such as cancer and heart disease, it excels at surgery, emergency care, the treatment of trauma, and certain bacterial infections. Many of its diagnostic tools are without compare. When operating empirically, allopathic medicine can be superlative. To deny its many vital contribu­ tions is equally counterproductive. Medicine now has the extraordinary opportunity to merge the best of all traditions in service to the well-be­ ing of the patient. At the same time, yesterday's science fiction is rapidly becoming today's science fact. Breakthroughs in the understanding of nutrition are blur­ ring the boundaries between food and medicine, opening an entire new terrain of \"nutraceuticals\" for health and healing. Mounting scientific data on herbal medicines show documented efficacy confirming ancient folk traditions. Perhaps insights into the nature of quantum physics and complexity theory may one day provide a matrix for explaining the po­ tency of the infinitesimal doses of homeopathic remedies. Research is proving placebos to be an unimaginably powerful healing force, dissolv­ ing distinctions between mind and body. Biological revelations about the natural world illustrate that health is more akin to an intricate ecology of interdependent relationships than to the rigid mechanics of a machine."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Humility is the constant companion of empiricism, and outcomes are ultimately what matter in medicine. Departing the clinic for the last time, I shared a taxi back to the bor­ der with an older couple. They were polite but reserved. Respecting their privacy, I sat silently until the taxi stopped short at the last turnaround before the U.S. border. The man asked the driver for directions to walk to a nearby shopping area on the Mexican side. As we got out of the cab, he turned to me and smiled broadly. He had just gotten a clean bill of health at the clinic. Mter five years on the tonic, he was cancer-free and heading for his first margarita in a very long time.\" I wished him well and set off on foot to merge with the flow of humanity funneling through U.S. customs to cross that philosophical border."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Epilogue D oes the Hoxsey tonic really work? That is the big question, after all. Realistically, only scientific research can finally provide a definitive an­ swer, but I have come to some personal conclusions. When Judge William Atwell did finally rule in federal court on the efficacy of the Hoxsey therapy, he estimated its effectiveness as \"compa­ rable to surgery, radium, and X-ray,\" but without the destructive effects of those measures. In the end, that is my conclusion, too.1 But the confounding variable is that the vast majority of patients com­ ing to Hoxsey are terminal and have undergone the immune-damaging effects of radiation or chemotherapy, which sabotage the very rationale of the tonic. Harry Hoxsey claimed, as Mildred does, to cure 80 percent of people who have not had these prior treatments. Who knows? However, Judge Atwell had earlier commented that he also believed Hoxsey healed his patients \"like Jesus Christ,\" a therapeutic wild card that deepens the enigma. As Norman Cousins, the late author of Anatomy of an Illness, noted, we know a little about how disease works but almost nothing about how healing happens. Medicine has been almost solely focused on disease mechanisms rather than the healing response in all its complexity. The curative powers of love, hope, and faith-of mind and spirit­ remain mysterious, elusive, and potent. Perhaps Harry Hoxsey had it right when he strode into a glum waiting room in his Dallas clinic to cheer his patients. \"I believe love is here to stay-what do you think about it? There's too much love in this world for it to ever sink!\" It's also spirit that con­ jures cures, though of course the herbs and the medicines help. In the end the debate returns to a familiar conflict of medical opinion. The allopaths have long believed the cause of disease to be entirely know­ able, explainable by a theory and traceable to a single mechanism. To the contrary, the empirics have suggested that one can know symptoms and therapeutic effects but seldom the \"cause\" of disease. Considering the vast intricacies and relational interdependencies of biology-not to men­ tion the mysteries of the human spirit-some questions in medicine may forever persist as starry enigmas. The real issue is the outcome. Getting well is finally the point. 353"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"3 !> 4 l:riLVI..:IUI: There are just too many people using Hoxsey who got well when they weren't supposed to for it to be accidental or rampant good luck.

There is no debate that the Hoxsey external escharotics work, only questions about their proper place in medical practice. In 1999 the long-awaited preliminary government review of Hoxsey patient records was completed by Mary Ann Richardson and her team. Intended as a feasibility study, the limited number of cases and inability to track down a significant proportion of the patients prevented any de­ finitive judgment or comparison with conventional treatment outcomes. Of 149 cancer patients, 17 were alive, 68 dead, and 64 lost to follow-up. In particular, the report notes the seven-year survival of a melanoma pa­ tient, an extreme rarity, who was treated solely with the Hoxsey tonic and escharotics. The report concludes, referring to Hoxsey, \"A best-case series or more systematic prospective monitoring of patients is justified not only be­ cause of the public health issue to justifY the large number of patients who seek treatment at this clinic, but also because of the several notewo1'­ thy cases of survival. \"1 In other words, a \"noteworthy\" number of terminal patients got well when they weren't supposed to. The call for a formal scientific investiga­ tion now bears the imprimatur of the federal government. Why was Hoxsey not investigated in the first place seventy-five years ago? The overarching truth is that the Hoxsey treatment has been politi­ cally railroaded instead of medically tested. The civil war has distorted cancer from a medical question into a political issue. The many coura­ geous practitioners and doctors thrust involuntarily into the front lines of the cancer wars would surely prefer to settle the question in a clinic or laboratory, not a courtroom. Meanwhile, cancer patients remain trapped in the crossfire, fighting for their lives and for their very right to survive using harmless treatments in a victimless crime. In medicine the goal is supposed to be the well-being of the patient. As Mildred Nelson told our camera eye, \"Surely to goodness, we're go­ ing to have enough heart and compassion for people, that the day has to come that everybody's going to be concerned about everybody else, and in some manner help to take care of 'em. What were we put here for except to help each other?\" Perhaps there is another kind of heroic medicine, a heroism from the heart of healing, a devotion to inspired service. There is a deep healing"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"l:pilogu e 355 unfolding today within medicine. It's something about simple caring, about respect for another person's unique path, about the healing forces of nature and the spirit. It's also something about taking the greed out of medicine.

Nurse Mildred Nelson and her patients hang in the balance while a potentially valuable cancer treatment is poised on the border of extinction."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Afterword I n January 1999, after the substantial completion of this book, Mildred Nelson suffered a stroke in her bed in Tijuana and died shortly after.

At times he appear s to have used the yellow powder internal ly. Whether any of these references are to the herbal tonic is uncl ear. A 4.17.26 letter from Dr. R.L. Morris to the AMA about a bladder cancer case referred to \"the only treatment she received was some medicine in­ ternally .\" Ano ther letter from Hilda Geor ge of Espano la, New Mexico about her mother's breast cancer treatment by Hoxsey says, \"They treat mostly external cases,\" but goes on to say, \"We take some kind of internal medic ine.\" Numerous other references indicat e other wise. A 9.1 5.24 letter from G.W . Nott to the AMA said, \"They stated they had not tried it on internal cancer .\" Letters from the Hoxi de Instit ute itself variously suggest, \"We have not as yet been properly equipped to cope with the situation of internal cancers, although we have admin­ istered our prepar ation in large doses and relie ved severa l...diag nosed as cancer of the stom ach (Dr. Wa shburn, 12.20.2 5); \"Although most of our work has been exter nal cancers, we have admi nistered the same treatm ent internally and re­ lieved cases ... \" (Dr. Wash burn, 12.20.2 5); \"We do not claim to be able to cure internal cancer , though we may reach that point later on.\" (H.T. Morp hy, Hoxide lnst. 4. 17 .2 5, Ta ylorvi lle Daily Courier.) Hoxsey himself said other wise: \"We have treated every type and style of cancer\" (letter to Mrs. Peris, 12.14.2 5). \"The internal medicat ion is just as important as the externa l especially in the metastacized cases. \" (Hoxsey deposition , Hoxsey vs. Fishbein No. 3203); by the time Hoxsey worked with Norman Baker , he definit ely used an int ernal tonic, as reported in newspapers. A letter from Dr. Arthur ]. Cramp at the Bureau of Investigation to Dr. A. Compton Broder s re Frank And erson 's lung cancer fur­ ther corroborated that Hoxsey used only \"an internal medicine compounded by Mr. Hoxsey.\" (12 .2. 33 ). Dr. Joseph Durkee, an osteopath who worked with Hoxsey from 1946 to 1952, reported in interviews with the FDA that he belie ved Hoxsey did not start with an internal formu la, but got it from a naturopath around 1936, as reported by Inspe ctor W. L. Prillmayer in \"Hoxsey Medicines\" (FDA memo­ randum, 8.6.56 ). The same memo, however , acknowledged that \"while [Dr. Durkee] may not be considered a friend of Hoxsey, he is a loyal adherent of the Hoxsey Cancer Tr eatme nt.\" Durkee had left the clinic in 1952, fo llowed by a hostile lawsuit he lost to gain control of all patient recor ds. Moreover, the gener ­ ally prejudicial stance of the FDA and its prosecutori al threats may have dis­ torted or misr epresented Dr. Durk ee's stance. 10 T. L.

The kidn eys excrete much of the soluble wast e from the blood . However, it is necess ary for many compounds to be pro­ cessed by the liver before they can be excret ed. If the liver does not adequately metabolize physiologic or foreign substances, these compounds accumu late and produce toxic symptoms. The liver excretes some of these metabolites along with bile into the intestines where they are hopefully eliminated through the colon along with the waste from undig ested food. \"Maintaining optimal blood purification especially requires efficient eliminat ion from the bowe ls. In cases of consti patio n, the reabsorption of waste compounds from the colon contaminates the blood. To xins produced by intestinal bacteria from the breakdown of undig ested prot ein can also be absorbe d. An increased burden of waste excretion then fa lls on the skin, lungs, and kidneys as toxins accumu late in the blood .\" 1 1 Brinker: \"They are taken to mean an increase in digestive secretions (barberr y, prickly ash), increased bile secretion (barberry), laxative effect (cascara, buck­ thorn), or immunomodulat ing activity (licorice, barbe rry, poke, prickly ash). Other influ ences include competi tive estrogen inhib ition (red clover, licorice), thyro id stimulat ion (pot assium iodide ), antimic robial activity (burdock, barbe rry), and anti-inf lammat ory effects (licorice). These combined effects could help improve cellular nutrition and metabolism and enhance eliminat ion of waste, relie ve in­ flamma tory conditions, and impr ove resistance against infections, as was claimed for the Tr ifolium Compound alterative formu las.

Dr. Gerson belie ved, as subsequent resear ch has shown, that iodine helps increase cell metabolism by stimulating the thyroid gland's production of hor­ mones, in turn retarding and inhibiting tumor growth. 6 9 David West, M.D., who headed the Hoxsey Resear ch Foundation, cont ended that potassium iodide \"inhibit s glycolosis\" (the anaer obic metabolism of sugars), which he char acterized as causing the specific biochemical lesion of the malig­ nant cell. He agreed with Dr. Max Gerson that malig nant tissues are impo ver­ ished of potassium and iodine, and corrected it with potassium iodide.
