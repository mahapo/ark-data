Theold saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Well, Square Foot Gardenisn’t broken, but the all new model is so superior, so much simpler, and soimproved that you can now forget all about the original book and the originalSquare Foot Gardening method!What’s so new about the All New Square Foot Gardening book? The original can beconsidered the Model T of Square Foot Gardening. This new one . . . like thelatest Cadillac! They are both cars and they both move down the road . . .but—oh boy—what a difference!In this expanded and revised book on Square Foot Gardening, you too can learn,as millions of others already have, how to become a successful gardener thesimple and painless way. This easy-to-understand method will revolutionize theway you think about gardening; and the new ideas found in this revised editionwill awe and inspire you as I share insights on how the Square Foot Gardeningmethod can, and is, changing the world.FOR EXPERTS ONLYA reporter once asked me if I thought I had invented “gardening for dummies,”referring, of course, to the popular Square Foot Gardening method I developed in1976. “No,” I answered.Actually, when I invented the Square Foot Gardening (SFG) method, I thought itwould be for expert gardeners. My method was very precise and detailed, yet verysimple and easy to understand, and it provided all the conditions necessary forsuccessfully growing a broad variety of plants in a very different way. It alsoeliminated all of the wasteful, inefficient practices of traditional single-rowgardening. I thought the experts would shout “Eureka!” and immediately bless allof the new ideas and advantages of this new home gardening method.BEGINNERS UNDERSTOODAs it turned out, the experts never understood this unique method. Apparently itwas too simple and easy. But the beginning gardener, and those discouraged byprevious failed attempts, understood it completely. They immediately saw thesimplicity of SFG. The beginner’s instant response was “I can do this!” whilethe experts continued to question every aspect of this revolutionary gardeningmethod. They just couldn’t admit that home gardening could be that easy.TWO HOURS OR TWO WEEKSIn my lectures, I like to reassure audiences that if they are new at gardening,or perhaps afraid or overwhelmed by the idea of starting a garden, they will beable to learn this simple method of gardening in just an hour or two. However,if they are already “expert” gardeners, it will probably take them about twoweeks! After the laughter dies down, I remind my audience that beginners readilyaccept the minimal amount of technical information needed to become successfulgardeners because they want to know how to successfully garden.The “experts,” on the other hand, are so entrenched with the idea of single-rowgardening as used in farming, with all of its wasteful methods, that they justcan’t see it any other way. You might say, “They are stuck in a rut.” As aresult, I’ve learned to leave the experts alone and concentrate on the beginner,or the tried-but-failed, gardener, and even the afraid-to-start person.SFG appeals to other large groups of would-be gardeners. Years ago, I read somevery interesting statistics (and I’m sure the percentages are similar today)about these gardeners.75 MILLION VS. 10 MILLIONEvery year there are about 15 million people who:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] would like to begin gardening.Image [../images/square-r.jpg] tried the traditional single-row gardeningmethod, but failed.Image [../images/square-r.jpg] don’t want to begin gardening because they haveheard of all the hard work, time, and cost associated with gardening.Image [../images/square-r.jpg] are doing single-row gardening but are tired ofthe hard work, time, and cost associated with this impractical method.Image [../images/square-r.jpg] are unable to continue caring for their bigsingle-row gardens.Combined, that’s an estimated 75 million people ready for a gardening revolutioncompared to about 10 million single-row gardeners who are content with theirmethod and don’t want to change.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AND ONE MILLION BOOKS LATERThe first book I wrote on SFG in 1981 lasted twenty-five years and sold over onemillion copies, becoming the best selling gardening book in America. Here is thestory behind how I came to invent a better way to garden, and the ultimatesuccess of SFG.IT STARTED IN 1975It all started in 1975 after my retirement from my consulting engineeringbusiness in New Jersey. In celebration, I moved my family to a waterfront homeon the North Shore of Long Island. After a year of rebuilding the house andanother year of landscaping and improving the grounds, I decided to take upgardening as a hobby. My first step was to attend a lecture on composting givenby a local environmental group. It was a warm spring day in April—a great timeto be out in the garden. A small group milled around at the advertised meetingpoint, but no instructor ever showed up. So, rather than disband, I suggested tothe group that we each share our knowledge with each other and tell what littlewe knew about composting. We had a wonderful time and actually learned a littlebit from each other. As we prepared to leave, someone asked me, “Can we do thisagain next week?” And I said, “Sure, why not?” Thus began my new career ofteaching gardening while I was still a novice myself.COMMUNITY GARDENThe next step was organizing a community garden for this same environmentalgroup. I found some land and convinced the town to cut down all the weeds andfence it in. A local farmer delivered two truckloads of well-rotted manure, and,after the ground was all fertilized and plowed up, we laid out plots and aislesand opened for business. All of the spaces were quickly taken by people in thecommunity, and everyone started with great enthusiasm. Since most of theparticipants didn’t have a garden at home and were novices, they wereenthusiastic about obtaining instruction and insights on gardening.So I initiated a Saturday morning gardening workshop and presented informationon a different subject each week while everyone sat around on bales of haylistening. I was teaching basic single-row gardening because that’s all anyoneknew back then. I was busy studying and learning gardening myself, trying tokeep ahead of everyone’s questions! The local county agricultural agent helpedout and everything went well until about midsummer. It was about then that ouronce-enthusiastic gardeners stopped coming out to the garden. However, the weedskept coming—and growing! Pretty soon the place was overgrown and looked a mess.FIRST RED FLAGI was discouraged and thought I had better do some research to figure out why wehad failed, so I visited many backyard gardens. What I found was a big space wayout in the farthest corner of the yard, about as close to the neighbor’sproperty line as possible. In most cases, these individual gardens were alsofilled with overgrown weeds. The first red flag went up in my mind, indicatingthat there was something wrong with traditional single-row gardening. I began tothink about all the conventional gardening practices we’d been taught and beganto question the efficiency of each.THREE-FOOT AISLESI questioned why fertilizer is spread over the entire garden area, but theplants are only placed in long, skinny rows with 3-foot wide aisles on bothsides. I wondered why you were supposed to till up all the soil in an entiregarden area when those 3-foot wide aisles consume over 80 percent of a gardenarea, although plants in rows require less than 20 percent of the garden space.Then I wondered why you would walk all over the rest of the garden area again,packing down all that newly tilled soil? And, why is an entire garden areawatered when plants are only located in a 6-inch wide row in the center of a6-foot wide strip?TOO MANY, TOO MUCHAs I analyzed these traditional gardening methods, I realized that there is onlyone outcome you can expect when you fertilize and water a 3-foot wide aisle withnothing planted in it—weeds!The following is a conversation I had with a friend of mine who was anagricultural agent.“Why a 3-foot wide aisle on both sides of the planted row?” I asked.Image [../images/f0012-01.jpg]Mel Bartholomew“So you have room to get into the garden to hoe the weeds,” he replied.“But I don’t want to hoe the weeds,” I protested. “That’s too much work.”“Well,” he said, “let’s face it. Gardening is a lot of hard work.”This triggered another red flag in my mind. Gardening shouldn’t be a lot of hardwork. Gardening should be fun! There’s something wrong here.This led to further questions. Why do the planting instructions on packages ofseeds direct the gardener to pour out an entire packet along a row only to haveyou later go back and tear out 95 percent of the seeds you planted once theysprout? Why use up an entire $1.89 packet of seeds for every row you plant?Isn’t that rather wasteful? Why would they instruct us to plant that way? Who’sin charge here, anyway?THIRTY-FOOT ROWSThe next question I asked was why plant an entire row of everything? Justbecause my garden is 30 feet long, for example, do I really want or need a wholerow of cabbages? That would be thirty cabbages spaced 12 inches apart. Thisbrings me to another commonsense revelation that no one seems to have thoughtabout. Why would I want thirty cabbages to ripen all at the same time? Ifeverything is planted at one time, won’t it also be ready to harvest all atonce? It sounds like farming to me, but that’s too much to enjoy at the sametime for a homeowner. How many people go to the grocery store and buy thirtyheads of cabbage once a year? Do you? So why grow it that way? There must be abetter way to stagger the harvest, and the obvious solution is to stagger thetime of planting whenever possible and to plant less.BECAUSE THAT’S THE WAYI soon realized that I had a lot of questions with very few answers, so Itraveled all over the country seeking out the best experts: agricultural collegeprofessors, county agricultural agents, garden writers, radio and TV gardeningpersonalities, gardening publishers, book writers, garden clubs—all those whowere supposedly knowledgeable people in the field of gardening. I sought answersto all the gardening questions I had and, no matter where I traveled throughoutthe country from Maine to California, I kept receiving the same answer. Can youimagine what that answer was? It soon became apparent that the only reasontraditional single-row gardening methods continued to exist was, “Because that’sthe way we’ve always done it!” Right then and there I said, “I’m going to inventa better way to garden.”FARMINGPart of the problem, I realized, was that single-row gardening was nothing but ahand-me-down technique from large-field crop farming. Single rows make sensewhen you depend upon a mule or a tractor to plow up the soil and tend the cropsbecause those big hooves or wheels take up a lot of room. But why had no oneever realized that in a home garden, there is no longer a need for all thatwasted space. There only needs to be room for two feet—yours! Yet, every singledirection for home gardening still instructs, “Space rows 3 feet apart.” Perhapsthat’s really the gardening method for dummies!EFFICIENCYThe next step I took was to list all of the ineffective, inefficient, andunnecessary steps that have been consistently taught for traditional single-rowgardening and then find a better and more efficient way to accomplish the sametask. I should mention here that besides being a civil engineer, I was also anefficiency expert. Before I sold my engineering company, my job was to travel toconstruction sites or manufacturing facilities to analyze current processes inorder to identify and correct inefficiencies in facility operations. In otherwords, to find a better way. Thus, the challenge of inventing a new way togarden was right up my alley. The sequence of questions I asked and simplesolutions I developed was actually very easy and straightforward, but itinvolved a little out-of-the-box thinking. Follow me along now.ONE THOUSAND SEEDSI have fun when teaching a class or seminar by asking, “How many seeds do youthink are in a packet of leaf lettuce?” Some guess fifty, one hundred, twohundred, and some even venture a guess as high as five hundred seeds. I thenastound them by saying that I once opened a packet and counted them, and therewere well over one thousand seeds! Why plant hundreds of seeds in one long row,and then turn around when they sprout and thin them out to one plant for every 6inches? It doesn’t make sense, does it? It’s a terrible waste of seeds and timeand work—all useless, unnecessary work. My first solution was to lay down ayardstick and plant one seed every 6 inches. Then, I had nothing further to doand no wasted seeds. The next thought was, if you’re growing, for example,lettuce, and the seed packet says to thin plants to 6 inches apart in the row,how far away does the next row really need to be? The answer, of course, is 6inches—not 3 feet!Image [../images/f0015-01.jpg]Depending on the mature size of each plant, space a couple of seeds ortransplants one, four, nine, or sixteen per square foot.SINGLE ROW, DOUBLE ROW, TRIPLE ROWEager to test my reasoning, I planted two rows, 6 inches apart, to see how wellthe plants would do. It worked! The plants grew just as well in two rows as theydid in a single row, as long as each plant had 6 inches all around. Next I trieda triple row—three rows where I placed all the plants 6 inches apart in alldirections. Again, it worked! How wide could I make this, I asked? The answeris, as wide as you can reach in to maintain your garden; in other words, as longas your arms. But I still had a harvest too large to utilize.SHORTEN THE ROWSSo what was the obvious solution? Shorten the rows! And they kept gettingshorter and shorter, until they were only 12 inches long and 12 inches wide—asquare foot planting area. How many plants could you grow in that square foot ifeach plant was 6 inches apart? The simple answer: four plants per square foot.PLANT SPACINGSo, in summary, if plants should be thinned to 12 inches apart, plant one persquare foot. If plants should be thinned to 6 inches apart, plant four persquare foot. If plants should be thinned to 4 inches apart then you can grownine within the space of that one square foot. If plants are thinned to 3 inchesapart, you can grow sixteen in that same square foot. Doesn’t it all make senseand seem easy enough?NEVER WALK ON SOILI then wondered just how far someone could reach in to maintain a garden withoutcompacting the soil by walking all over it. So, I got a little old lady and abig husky man and measured how far they could easily reach. I found that bothcould comfortably reach in 2 feet without losing balance. In order to reach in 2feet and walk all the way around your garden, you end up having a 4 × 4-footarea. Now, the only soil that needs to be dug up, improved, watered, andfertilized is a 4 × 4-foot garden area and not all the aisles. That reduced theactual growing area in the garden by 80 percent. And, an added benefit is thegrowing soil in the 4 × 4-foot area is never packed down, so you don’t have tohoe or dig up the ground to keep loosening the planting soil.SOIL IMPROVEMENTThe next step was how to improve the soil. After listening to agriculturalagents and reading books on soil improvement and conditioning, the only optionseemed to require a great deal of work, time, and money. My research indicatedthat average soil conditions around the country were not well-suited for growinghealthy vegetables and beautiful flowers. Thus, in most areas soils had to begreatly improved to obtain the best gardening results.HORSE MANUREMost soils only contain about 3 or 4 percent organic material. Thus, thetraditional first step for improving soil in preparation for gardening was todig or till up the soil in the entire garden as deep as you could and then addsoil enhancers such as compost or well-rotted manure followed later bycommercial fertilizers. This initial step rang a bell with me because, as ateenager, I was the one who had to turn over my mother’s garden, digging thewhole thing up every year. My father had to bring home bushel baskets full ofhorse manure in his brand new Chrysler. After we dumped it into the garden area,I had to do all of the spreading, mixing, and turning. As laborers in Mom’sgarden every spring, my dad and I were not happy campers, although she wasthrilled with the results.THE SEVEN-YEAR ITCHI once conducted a survey, asking gardeners how long it took them to improvetheir soil until they got it just the way they wanted it. The average answer wasabout seven years—seven years of hard work to properly condition the soil forgardening! And do you know what statistics say the average homeowner does afterseven years? They move! And guess who buys that home? Someone who doesn’t evengarden!You can probably imagine the conversation between the new homeowners. “Henry,let’s pave over that garden area; it would make a great place to park thetrailer.” Seven years worth of effort lost. There’s something definitely wrongwith this scenario.START RIGHT IN A SINGLE DAYI started thinking, “Why not have great soil during the first year of yourgarden, and every year thereafter, no matter where you live?” Of course, withtraditional big garden areas, having the best soil conditions right away may betoo costly and entail too much time and effort. Remember that after I did themath, I found that by switching from a traditional single-row garden to a 4 ×4-foot layout—which will produce the same harvest—80 percent of the garden areacould be completely eliminated. This means that you can grow 100 percent of theharvest in only 20 percent of the space. That 80 percent of a single-row gardenis wasted space—space that doesn’t need to be fertilized, watered, or improved,but it does have to be weeded. Think of it. With the SFG method, seven yearsworth of work can suddenly be condensed into as little as a single day withoutall the effort!THE 4×4-FOOT GARDENMy first book showed how you could reduce the work by laying out a 4 × 4-footarea, then digging out 6 inches of existing soil and mixing in 2 inches of peatmoss, 2 inches of vermiculite, and 2 inches of compost. These ingredients areavailable at any nursery. Many gardeners even make their own compost at homefrom kitchen scraps and other plant material. Mixing the ingredients togetherwith the soil that you removed, you now have 12 inches of 50 percent improvedsoil. My thinking was that 12 inches of improved existing soil would be all thatnew plants would need to thrive with the plant roots staying within these 12inches of improved soil. But the experts I consulted said that most vegetableplant roots need to keep growing downward, searching for water and nutrientsmany, many feet below the surface of the soil. “But,” I thought, “if plants areprovided a good growing soil composed of more than 15 percent organic matter,and if vermiculite and peat moss are mixed in, helping to retain water in thesoil, plant roots would no longer need to continue growing downward in search ofadditional moisture and nutrients.” Besides that, I wondered if they were rightabout the roots needing to grow deeper than 12 inches, how come most rototillersdig down less than 6 inches? Well, it turned out they were wrong. Our gardensthrived with less than 12 inches of improved soil and that was just thebeginning! Wait until you read Chapter 2 [ch02.html#ch02], which describes thelatest advances in this “out of the box” type of thinking.STAGGER THE HARVESTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]I also realized that if each square foot could be planted with a different cropcontaining either one, four, nine, or sixteen plants, all properly spaced, itwouldn’t be necessary to plant a whole row of just one crop. So, why not staggeryour vegetable plantings, so that your harvest is also staggered? Makes sense,doesn’t it? Yet we’ve been taught all our lives to plant everything all at oncein long rows—another hand-me-down technique from large-field crop farming. Ifyou’re farming for commercial purposes, you want everything to ripen at once soit can be harvested together and taken to market. But with home gardening, youwant to stagger your produce so you can use it throughout the season for dailyconsumption.Of course, I’m not talking about canning, freezing, and other home-storagemeasures, although SFG is a practical gardening method for these purposes also.However, I’ve found that people are not storing homegrown produce to the extentthey did in the past. Remember, I grew up in the days of the “victory garden,” aresult of World War II when Americans were encouraged by the government and bysociety to have a big garden that used the old single-row planting methods. Mostpeople who grew up during those years hated gardening because of all the weedingand hard work it entailed. That carried over into a whole generation of peoplewho stayed away from gardening just because of the negative memories associatedwith maintaining a large traditional garden. And, I might add, also from all thework of canning and freezing. So why does the government still teach the sameold system more than 60 years later?STOP PLANTING SO MUCHI meet many mature couples where the husband proudly states, “I have a bigsingle-row garden, and I grow a lot of produce.” And the woman responds, “Oh,but I wish he’d stop. He grows all this produce that we really don’t needanymore. Then I have to can and freeze it. I’m tired and don’t want to do itanymore. We don’t need it but he just keeps growing it!” With SFG, you don’thave to grow so much at a time that it becomes overwhelming.Image [../images/f0019-01.jpg]Believe me, there are so many advantages to the SFG method, and the benefits andefficiencies only continue to increase.LOCATIONI began to realize another great advantage of SFG—by reducing the garden size by80 percent, it increases the number of places where a garden will fit. A gardenno longer has to be way out back, snugly put up against your neighbor’s propertyline. And since you don’t have to fertilize, water, and weed the aisles, it cannow be located near the house.UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL“Closer is better” is one SFG motto. When a garden is closer to the front orback door of your home, you pass by the garden more often. This means it iseasier to take care of and can be more readily enjoyed, all of which results ina better garden and a happier gardener. The whole package fits together nicely.There are so many advantages to Square Foot Gardening, and the benefits andefficiencies of the concept only continue to increase.THE SQUARE FOOT GARDENING STORYImage [../images/dotline.jpg]COMMUNITY GARDENWell, we tried all these new ideas in the community garden the next year, and,guess what? They worked! Everyone understood and grasped the Square FootGardening concepts quickly and easily, and since most of the participants werebeginning gardeners who were well acquainted with the disastrous experience fromthe previous year—including the overgrown weeds and mounds of zucchini and rowsof cabbage that ripened all at once—they were very willing to try anotheroption. That next year, 1976, we were able to enjoy a very attractive andwell-run community garden using the newly developed Square Foot method. TheBicentennial year of 1976 was a huge celebration across the country and we alsocelebrated my youngest son’s July Fourth birthday. I decided to do three things:one for my country, one for my family, and one for myself. The officialpresentation of Square Foot Gardening was made at a hometown event that includeda school project that I had organized. All the schools grew sunflowers, whichwere planted along Main Street as a beautification project. We had an all-daycelebration of displays, talks, booths, and demonstrations on the new SquareFoot Gardening method I had developed. I announced this was my gift to thecountry—a better way to garden.“You have forever changed gardening for me.”—Kanas from CaliforniaSHARING IDEAS, 1978 TO 1980Because of the overwhelming success of the project and the unique SFG method,many people encouraged me to write a book sharing my ideas. First, the localnewspaper asked me to write a garden column. Then I began writing and producingpamphlets. Soon, magazine representatives started coming out to photograph myhome garden and to write stories about my new ideas and the SFG method. Themedia attention grew and grew, so I thought, “Why not write a book?” I draftedan outline and sent it to two publishers, which both accepted the “how to” bookon successful gardening using the new SFG method.GARDEN CONSULTING, 1981 TO 1984At the same time, I also began doing gardening consulting work for severalcompanies. You can imagine how “retired” I was now. One was a fence company,and, using their products, I began to develop vertical gardening methods,originally for tomatoes but later for all vine crops. Another company wanted tostart a gardening tool catalog. So my job was to search the world for unique andunusual tools, test and evaluate them, make recommendations, and then arrangethe writing of sample descriptions for the catalog. During this time, I wonderedwhy we needed so much stuff just to garden. And, as you’ll learn, I discoveredthat you don’t.PBS ONE MINUTE, 1981 TO 1986My publisher’s predictions for my book were very modest, so they didn’t promotemy book the way I had hoped or even send me out for talks and appearances.Fortunately, some of the companies I was consulting for did send me on tours andallowed me to show the book and talk about Square Foot Gardening if I alsoexplained and demonstrated their products. This proved to be a very valuable andrewarding period, and it wasn’t long before a local PBS television station askedif they could send their camera crew out to my garden to shoot “A Minute inMel’s Garden” segment for the evening news. I was delighted to have theopportunity to share the SFG method. The response to that short segment wasexplosive. The television station received so much mail and so many telephonecalls that they wanted to tape a show for broadcast every week night. So, once aweek they came to my garden and taped five different segments. That again provedso popular that later they asked if I would be interested in a thirty-minutenational show. You bet I was!THIRTY-MINUTE PBS TV SERIES, 1982 TO 1986To make a long story short, my show aired the following year on PBS and waspicked up by enough stations along the East Coast to pay for itself. Thefollowing year I started my own production company and distributed thethirty-minute Square Foot Gardening show throughout the entire PBS system.Within three years it was picked up by every PBS station in the country andreceived the highest rating of any garden show. This involved a lot of travel,but it was all very exciting. My oldest son, Steve, became the show director,and we traveled around the country to different viewers’ gardens that wereparticularly worthy of sharing with our audience. We were also invited to DisneyWorld to shoot during the winter, an opportunity we couldn’t pass up. All ofthis excitement and activity made it a very rewarding and exciting period of mylife.MORE TELEVISION OPPORTUNITIESIn addition to all the above activity and travel, many other opportunitiesoccurred with TV networks like CNN out of Atlanta, Georgia, CBN in VirginiaBeach, Virginia, and several appearances on ABC, Good Morning Boston, GoodMorning Philly, and many other TV spots all around the country. All of thatbrought in a ton of mail (whoever had heard of e-mail back then?) and activitieswith companies interested in developing SFG products including some bigcompanies such as Rubbermaid. This was exciting and eventful, yet at timesstressful and exhausting. Through all of it, my wife Ginny courageously tookcare of everything at home and even put up with—yet never quite got used to—thefilm crews coming once a week to film the PBS TV show. It was bad enough to havethe constant activity outside in the garden, but they even invaded her kitchento do the cooking segment. Since such a big part of gardening is in the harvestand food preparation, I convinced PBS to let us have the first cooking segmenton a garden show. Now, of course, they all do that.TV BOOK TAGI originally offered the program to PBS free of charge if they would give me aone-minute book tag at the end of each show. At that time, PBS wascommercial-free and had no corporate sponsors. But they were finally convincedthat it would be worthwhile, allowing me to be the first person to have a booktag on a PBS show. As a result, a tremendous number of orders for the SFG bookwere received. We had to set up a toll-free number and a fulfillment company toprocess these orders. After six years, the operation became fairly routine andthe challenge of creating something new was over. At the same time, some PBSstations started talking like they should share in the profits of the booksales, yet they still wanted the show free. Rather than compromise the initialagreement, I decided to take the show off the air and retire for the secondtime. This time, my retirement was “for sure.”DISCOVERY NETWORK 1989 TO 1991A few years later, an agent came to me and said that he could get the TV showback on the air. I didn’t want anything to do with it; I was happily retired.But when he offered to do all the work and take care of all the details, Ithought, “Well, what harm could there be?” (We never learn, do we?) I finallyagreed, and he sold the show to the Discovery Network where it ran for two yearsand then on The Learning Channel for another year. I again took the show off theair. I decided that that was it—I really was retiring for good! (Yeah, sure!)CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS, 1996Five years later, when I was traveling in northern California, someone invitedme to come see a school garden. “It’s a Square Foot Garden,” they explained. Iwent and thought it was so impressive. The children were really enjoying thegardening experience, and the teachers loved it so much that I began to thinkthat perhaps I really shouldn’t be retired—I should be out teaching SFG toschool children. So, again, I came out of retirement (you know the saying “foolsrush in”) and established a nonprofit foundation to design a program forteachers explaining how to teach Square Foot Gardening to students. Thefoundation also built and distributed numerous gardens throughout the country.We called the program “A Square Yard in the School Yard” since the children’sgardens are sized at 3 × 3 feet.Image [../images/f0023-01.jpg]One of the truly great features of SFG is how easy it is for children (of allages!) to participate.UTAH SCHOOLS, 1998This phase of my life also involved a lot of travel. As I developed new staffmembers, we went from school to school donating gardens all the way from Maineto Florida and on to the California coast. When offering Square Foot Gardeningto schools in Utah, we tried something new. Rather than going from teacher toteacher and school to school, we went straight to the state board of education.They liked our idea so much that they said, “We’ll take a garden for everysingle grammar school in the state of Utah.” We gulped and said, “Well, let’ssee what we can do.”THANKSGIVING POINT, 1999 TO 2001Over the next two years, we were able to do just that. Next, the school boardasked if I would write a lesson plan for Utah teachers and students. I did, andit has now been modified for home schooling as well. We were then invited to putup a public display Square Foot Garden at Thanksgiving Point near Salt LakeCity. Thousands visited the garden and, since Salt Lake City is home to theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the LDS church or Mormons), SFGgained the attention of many LDS church leaders. They invited the foundation toteach SFG at the LDS Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah. We showedmissionaries how to instruct people living in Third World countries to becomemore self-sufficient by growing their own food using the Square Meter Gardeningmethod, which we had converted from the Square Foot Gardening method.SQUARE METER GARDENING: SFG HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS GO GLOBAL, 2001 TO 2002Opportunities for the SFG foundation just kept on growing as we became involvedwith additional humanitarian organizations that sent aid overseas, many of whichbegan including the Square Meter Gardening system in their programs. SMG wasdesigned to appeal to families in Third World countries and improve nutrition byadding fresh vegetables to their diets. It is something that can be readilydone, as the soil that is used in this program is pure compost since peat mossand vermiculite is either unavailable or too expensive to obtain overseas. Anadded advantage is that making compost cleans up the environment and gets allthe family members involved.SFG INTERNATIONAL TRAINING CENTER IN HOMESTEAD, FLORIDASince gardening in Utah is at a standstill all winter, the logical direction togo that time of year is south. Through our work with several internationalorganizations headquartered in Washington, D.C., the opportunity came to spendthe winter in southern Florida where we set up an SFG International TrainingCenter in Homestead. This proved very educational for us because the weather,plants, and techniques were much more like Central and South America. Weprovided a three-day training seminar for the people heading to those countriesas representatives of various humanitarian organizations. This enabled SquareMeter Gardening to be taken to quite a variety of people and places.OVERSEASWhen working with people overseas, the first step is to teach them composting.Since most Third-World countries are located in tropical regions of the world,it’s very easy to find materials that can be used to generate compost. One ofthe biggest successes in Square Meter Gardening is a project developed in India.It illustrates how easy it is to offer meaningful foreign aid to countrieswithout spending millions of dollars. It is also a successful way of encouragingindependence rather than dependence on governmental bureaucracies. This successstory began after a priest named Father Abraham received the Square FootGardening book. He read it and said, “We can do this!” As a result, he nowoperates a sizeable, well-organized 6-acre training center wherehundreds—perhaps thousands—of people have come to learn the Square MeterGardening method. The people are learning to successfully grow crops they cannot only use at home but can take to market where they earn twenty times morethan they did previously growing crops the traditional single-row way.SINGLE ROWS THROUGHOUT THE WORLDBelieve it or not, many people around the world still garden and grow crops insingle rows. When I was in the mountains of Nepal, I observed the farmersgrowing corn one spindly stalk spaced 1 meter (approximately 3 feet) apart fromthe next spindly stalk, with the next row 1 meter away. Through the interpreterI asked why they space and plant their crops this way. The answer, as you canprobably guess, was “That’s the way we’ve always done it. My father taught me,and that’s the way his father taught him.”Just think of all the good that will be accomplished when Square Foot/MeterGardening is adopted all over the world. It will allow families to grow fivetimes as much for their own use, thereby improving their health through betternutrition; family life will improve with the new abundance. It will drawfamilies closer together as they become involved in a viable and productiveproject, and they can sell the excess at market. The woman of the family is ourprimary target for this project, as she is most concerned with the children’snutrition.“Your method has given me the confidence to try veggies again after a few feebleattempts.”—Anne from FloridaCERTIFIED SFG TEACHERSWe hold workshops to train teachers and people who want to help others learnthis simple, easy, inexpensive method that anyone, anywhere in the world can do.Just think—what if every woman in the world started just one Square Foot/MeterGarden? Those nine crops could improve the nutrition of her children; many couldeven expand by planting more gardens for larger harvests and even to grow cashcrops. One of our trainees who took our course for certification then went on amission to teach schoolchildren music at orphanages in an African country. Atthe same time, she started many SFG projects; her stories of success wereheartwarming and inspiring.GARDEN OF EDENAfter enjoying three very productive years with our SFG Display Gardens atThanksgiving Point, Utah, we had to make a decision because developers weregoing to build a new building where our gardens were located. Rather than movethe gardens to another location, I decided it was time to get away for asabbatical to do some planning and writing and discovered the beautiful, smallmountain community of Eden, Utah. I intended to only stay and write for a fewmonths. Knowing I would need some clerical help, I placed an ad in the localnewspaper and received an overwhelming response from people wanting to help withSFG. Those initial few months stretched into years, and Eden became anappropriately named home base for spreading SFG throughout the world. Throughthe development of the Square Foot Gardening website and e-mail contacts, theworld has literally become my next-door neighbor.THE STORY GOES ON AND ONRecently, a representative from Guadalajara, Mexico, e-mailed asking for one ofour representatives to visit and advise him in the development of a large urbanSFG project that would teach and enable women to help their families. A reallybig and impressive project has been started in Sri Lanka. Others have recentlywritten from Ukraine, Mongolia, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Africa requestingtraining in the SFG method because they see and know what a great difference itcan make in their respective countries.I receive reports from successful SFG projects throughout the world. Such areport came from one of our certified teachers, a professor from Tennessee,along with photos of her international project in Ecuador. Letters come frompeople in Switzerland, France, Germany, Spain, Argentina, and China volunteeringto help translate our website and book into different languages.The viewer comments sent to our website at www.squarefootgardening.com[http://www.squarefootgardening.com] are phenomenal and the stories are not onlyheartwarming, but some are very funny. One lady said the only good thing she gotin her divorce was my SFG book! Another told of the family bond that was forgedas he sat with his father (now deceased) watching my PBS TV show in the early’80s. He still has his father’s original book. An entire SFG generation haspassed by since I started. Boy, am I getting that old? And now in the electronicage, we have the website and e-mail to replace the TV show and snail mail. Backthen, we offered a free garden tips flyer and a packet of seeds (my favorite,marigolds) if viewers sent in a SASE. Do you younger gardeners know what thatstands for? Ask your parents. We received ten thousand letters and sold onethousand books every week. What a hectic, exciting experience! But now that’sall history, and it’s time for an all new SFG book for a new generation ofgardeners.WHY AN ALL NEW SQUARE FOOT GARDENING BOOK NOW?Image [../images/dotline.jpg]The answer is simple—I have made so many new improvements to the original basicSFG method. Most of these improvements are so major they make the first SFG bookobsolete. Just look at the next page and see why All New Square Foot Gardeningcan help you with your garden!"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/ch02.jpg]TEN MAJOR NEW IMPROVEMENTS TO THEORIGINAL SQUARE FOOT GARDEN METHODImage [../images/dotline.jpg]1. New Location—Close to the House2. New Direction—Up, Not Down3. New Soil—Mel’s Mix4. New Depth—Only 6 Inches Deep5. No Fertilizer—You Don’t Need It6. New Boxes—Above the Ground7. New Aisles—Comfortable Width8. New Grids—Prominent and Permanent9. New Idea—Don’t Waste Seeds10. New Opportunities—Tabletop GardensAll New Square Foot Gardening offers ten new major improvements to the originalSFG method. Now, with these improvements, anyone can be a successful gardener.Yes, it’s true; this improved gardening method makes gardening even easier thanbefore. You’re going to love every one of these improvements.You will now be able to reduce the size of your SFG so much that you can locateit close to your house for better care and more enjoyment. You’ll never have todig up your existing soil anymore as you now build your new garden on top of it.No more hard work or heavy-duty tools needed. All you’ll need is 6 inches of aperfect soil mix from three common ingredients available everywhere. This mixnever needs changing and no fertilizer is ever needed using this natural,organic method.You’ll use bottomless boxes made from common lumber, have aisles that are wideenough to comfortably move about in, and each box will have a permanent grid forthat unique SFG look and use. You’ll use a minimum of seeds, so you won’t haveto buy new packets every year. Best of all, some of your boxes can have bottomsso you can move them or place them at tabletop or railing heights for easiercare and unique locations.Image [../images/1-red.jpg] NEW LOCATION—CLOSE TO THE HOUSEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]SINGLE-ROW GARDENS ARE TOO BIGOne of the biggest problems of single-row and bed gardens is their size. They’rebig! They take up so much room that they are usually located way out back. Thatusually meant it was out of sight, resulting in out of mind. It became less andless tended as the year went on. But, guess what still grew? Weeds! And thesepesky plants can quickly inundate and choke out your crops. Without yourattention they’ll take over the garden.NO MOREAll that has been changed for the better. SFG takes only 20 percent of the spaceof a single-row garden. That means it can be located much closer to the housewhere it will get more attention and care, resulting in a better-looking gardenand a more usable harvest.SPLIT IT UP FOR BEST LOCATIONIn addition, your garden doesn’t have to be all in one place. You no longer haveto rototill or water one big garden area all at once. You can split up your SFGso that a box or two are located next to the kitchen door, while more boxes canbe located elsewhere in the yard. Small, individual garden boxes allow you muchmore flexibility in determining location. Now your garden can be located nearwhere you walk and sit, or where you can view it from the house. It can even belocated in a patio or pool setting, where you relax. Your SFG becomes acompanion rather than a burden.Image [../images/f0028-01.jpg]The key to success of the All New Square Foot Gardening method is to avoid thepoor qualities of local soil by building up rather than digging down.Image [../images/2-red.jpg] NEW DIRECTION—UP, NOT DOWN!Image [../images/dotline.jpg]BUILD UP, DON’T DIG DOWNThe second improvement involves locating your garden on top of your existingsoil rather than digging down. Most of our readers complain about the terriblesoil in their areas. In fact, as I lecture around the country and the world, thequestion I hear most is, “What can we do about our local soil? It is so hard towork and garden in.” The original Square Foot Gardening book explained how todig down 6 inches and improve your existing soil by adding equal amounts ofreally good ingredients. Even though you had to do that only the first year andit produced a fairly good soil, people complained that it was still a lot ofwork involving heavy tools and a great deal of effort. Everyone wants a simple,easy way to garden. So, back to the drawing board.This got me to thinking. Could I find a better way? So, I asked myself, why dowe really need to improve our existing soil if it’s so bad? Couldn’t we juststart with a perfect soil mix aboveground and eliminate the need to ever dig upor improve our existing backyard soil? You probably could if your garden wasn’tso big . . . but hey, SFG isn’t big. In fact, it’s one-fifth the size ofconventional gardens. So, if we could find a perfect soil mix, there would be nomore digging and no more tilling. Doesn’t that make a lot of sense? It becamepossible with All New Square Foot Gardening to have a very condensed no-workgardening method and never have to be concerned again about what kind of soilyou have in your yard. Wow!NO SWEATJust think of the implications if you forget about trying to improve yourexisting soil. It no longer matters what kind of soil you have! Use the time yousave to start a compost pile instead. If you start with a perfect soil mix, itwill save a lot of time and money. You don’t have to have your soil analyzedanymore, and you don’t have to have a pH test made . . . you don’t even have toknow what pH is! You don’t have to buy any heavy tools or go to the expense ofhaving someone rototill your garden every single year. You don’t have to buyspecial ingredients to loosen your clay soil or solidify your sandy soil. Andmost importantly, you no longer have to do any hard work. You’ll have to findanother way to get some exercise—so go mow the lawn. This major advance in homegardening changes all of the rules of gardening and eliminates all of the hardwork and undesirable parts of single-row gardens. Hey, gardening can be fun now!So, if you are not going to use your existing soil but instead use a perfectsoil mix, what is it and how and where do you get it?Image [../images/3-red.jpg] NEW SOIL—MEL’S MIXImage [../images/dotline.jpg]WHAT’S IN IT?There are three characteristics of a perfect growing mix. First of all, it’slightweight, so it is easy to work with and easy for plants to grow in. Next, itis nutrient-rich and has all the minerals and trace elements that plants needwithout adding fertilizers. Finally, it holds moisture, yet drains well.After many experiments, I found that three of my favorite ingredients made theperfect mix when combined in equal portions:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] 1/3 Peat Moss— Available at any garden center orsupermarket.Image [../images/square-r.jpg] 1/3 Vermiculite— Buy the coarse grade in large4-cubic-foot bags at any garden center or home improvement store. Phone ahead tobe sure it’s available in that size.Image [../images/square-r.jpg] 1/3 Blended Compost— If you don’t have your owncompost operation, then buy bags of compost at the garden center to get started.Then, start your own compost pile as soon as possible. I’ll explain some simplesteps for foolproof composting later in the book. However, one word of cautionhere: You must have a blended compost, so don’t buy all the same kind. Pick outone bag of this and one bag of that. But, more about that in Chapter 5[ch05.html#ch05].WHAT DO THESE INGREDIENTS DO?All three of these ingredients are natural—not manufactured. They all drainwell, so there are no puddles to waterlog the plant roots; but they also holdlarge amounts of moisture so the plants will grow well. This mix is a pleasureto work with, has a light fluffy texture, and smells good.The first two ingredients have no nutrients, but the last—compost—is loaded withall the nutrients and minerals that you could imagine. Compost is the mostimportant ingredient of the three, and making your own is good for both theenvironment and the garden. This is about as organic as you can get.If you don’t think this perfect soil mix will work in the garden, ask yourself,“What do professional greenhouse growers use for growing crops on their benches?Do they go out and dig up the fields for soil?” Of course not. Professionalgrowers mix up a perfect potting soil from several other ingredients and neveruse local outside soil.When you buy a windowbox at the store, what do you fill it with—your yard soil?Of course not. You buy a bag of perfect potting soil. So why can’t we do thesame for our vegetable garden? Well, there are two reasons:One, no one ever thought of it—and two, it would be prohibitively expensive forthe typical single-row garden that everyone has been using all of these years.So, how can we do it now? Because SFG reduces the garden size down to only 20percent (that’s one-fifth as large), so it is now possible to consider using aperfect soil from the very start. An additional reason is found in the nextmajor improvement to Square Foot Gardening.Image [../images/4-red.jpg] NEW DEPTH—ONLY 6 INCHES DEEPImage [../images/dotline.jpg]“GO DEEP,” THEY SAID. “DON’T BOTHER,” I SAID.For years, experts said your garden soil had to be improved at least 12 inchesdeep; some even said 18 inches. But my experiments were proving otherwise,especially when I used good homemade compost as one-third of the mix. I askedmyself, “If six inches of perfect soil is good enough for windowboxes andcommercial greenhouse benches, why not in backyard gardens?” And why dilute itby adding the mix to poor existing soil? Why not use this perfect soil mix inyour garden and forget all about the soil underneath? Well, the experts stillpooh-poohed the idea. But guess what? It works! Of course, everyone realizesthat you couldn’t do that in a huge, old-fashioned, single-row garden or even inraised bed gardening, but it can easily be done in a small-space Square FootGarden!“We owe much of our love of gardening to the simplicity of SFG.”—Manja from OregonCan you really grow vegetables and flowers in only 6 inches of soil regardlessof how good it is? I’ve been doing it for the last ten years in my display andhome garden, and it really works. Of course in my lectures when I mention the 6inches, I can see the audience squirming in their seats, heads shaking and handsrising with the usual question, “How can you grow long carrots or potatoes injust 6 inches of soil?” It’s a good question, so we developed a special featureof SFG where you build a 1-foot × 1-foot box one foot tall for long root crops.Why only 6 inches deep? Why not be safer and go 12 inches deep? The main reasonis there is no need to do so. In addition, it is much cheaper, easier, and lesswork. Just think—it is one-half of the cost and one-half of the work, so whydouble the depth? But if you’re still skeptical go ahead and use your time andmoney to go 12 inches deep, but it’s really not necessary.The next question is, “How come all of the experts have been so wrong for solong?” It is not that they were wrong, it is just everyone in the gardenindustry had trouble thinking outside the box or even questioning all thetraditional methods. Stuck in a rut they were and in a single-row rut at that!Here’s another startling revelation I am going to make. It is going to shock anddismay the gardening world, but you are going to love it.Image [../images/5-red.jpg] NO FERTILIZER—YOU DON’T NEED ITImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Square Foot Gardening needs no fertilizer ever! How can that be? After all, thegardening industry is built on using fertilizer. The original SFG book explainedall about fertilizer—organic and chemical types—how to measure and rate it; allabout NPK and what that means; and the list goes on and on. That was necessarybecause at that time we were just improving our existing soils, and they stillneeded fertilizer. All the experts agreed. But my own experiments and thoughtsabout an all new out-of-the-box idea of not improving your existing soil butrather of starting with a perfect soil mix was working so well that I began toconsider another new idea—that you don’t need to add fertilizer. The compost wasproviding all of the nutrients and trace elements the plants needed. Besides,compost was all-natural and couldn’t burn or harm the plants. The proof of thepudding was to just look at my garden. It was one of the best gardens I haveever had and has remained so ever since.This was when I was able to simplify my original book’s formula for the perfectsoil mix to only three ingredients: 1/3 each of peat moss, vermiculite, andblended compost, and completely eliminate the use and expense of fertilizer. Somuch simpler than the original one-page formula and what a savings!Well, again, all the experts pooh-poohed the idea and still do, but guess what?It works! I haven’t used any kind of fertilizer in my home, display, ordemonstration gardens for more than ten years. If you go to our website atwww.squarefootgardening.com [http://www.squarefootgardening.com], you’ll see howbountiful and beautiful the gardens look. And this is not just gardening thefirst year but year after year after year. Just think —no more tilling, no moredigging, and no more fertilizer! The only thing we ever add to our soil is alittle more compost. Is this great or what?Now all we need is some way to hold or contain our aboveground 6 inches ofperfect soil mix. So, how about a box?Image [../images/6-red.jpg] NEW BOXES—ABOVE THE GROUNDImage [../images/dotline.jpg]I think having your garden contained in a box adds uniformity and structure, notonly to your garden but to your life. Once limits are placed on almost anything,you will find it much easier to take care of and therefore you will be morecomfortable with it and enjoy it more.The basic 4 × 4-foot bottomless boxes are easy to build out of common lumber,bricks, blocks, or even stone. These small boxes, filled with the perfect soilmix, will grow five times as much as the same space in a single-row garden. So,you don’t need many of the boxes. There are no weeds to hoe. No existing soil totill. Why, once your boxes are built and your perfect soil is added, there isvirtually no work at all.Image [../images/f0033-01.jpg]Once you build the basic 4×4 SFG box with rotated corners, add six inches ofMel’s Mix, and add the square foot grid. Now, you’re ready to plant.If you place the box on top of the existing ground, you eliminate all of theusual gardening concerns and work of improving your existing soil. It alsoeliminates the great deal of gardening knowledge that you would need if you weregoing to be concerned with using your existing soil. You’ll see as we go alongthat there are so many advantages of not using your existing soil. You’ll wonderwhy no one ever thought of it before. The 4 × 4-foot boxes have been chosenbecause it’s a size you can walk around and easily reach into to tend yourplants; this eliminates the need for stepping on the growing soil and packing itdown, which then eliminates the need to dig or loosen it. See how everything inSFG is interrelated and works so well together?For bigger gardens, you can always put some of the boxes end to end to create a4 × 8-foot or a 4 × 12-foot garden box that you will still be able to walkaround, yet reach in. If your box is located next to a wall, fence, or building,keep the boxes only two feet wide so you can reach all the way to the back. Theycan be any length. Boxes can be made from any type of wood. The best is freewood that is found at a construction site. Just ask the foreman of the projectif you can have the scrap 2 × 6-inch boards. If you are going to buy yourlumber, boxes can be made from pine or fir for the least cost, or cedar orredwood for longer lasting use. If you decide to treat or paint the wood, becareful not to paint inside the boxes where the Mel’s Mix comes into contactwith the wood; you don’t want anything harmful to leach into the soil. I do notrecommend using pretreated wood for the same reason.Image [../images/7-red.jpg] NEW AISLES—COMFORTABLE WIDTHImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The width of your aisles is another improvement I have made for the All NewSquare Foot Gardening method. This is more important for comfort, safety, andlooks, than for efficiency. If you notice the garden on the cover of theoriginal Square Foot Gardening book, there were no boxes and the aisles were 1 ×12-inch boards separating the 4 × 4-foot areas. I designed it that way to be themost space-efficient but, as someone once said, “This is one time when Mel wastoo efficient!” But the wood was free, so hey, can you blame me?STRAIGHT AND NARROWThe 12-inch wide board was difficult to maneuver on, and you had to keep apretty good balance to stay upright. I found that the average gardener needs tohave more room to move about on than those 12 inches. In addition, you couldn’tget close to each 4 × 4-foot planting area if you wanted to use a wheelbarrow,garden cart, or harvest basket. Can you just picture two people working in thatgarden with 12-inch wide paths, and one says to the other, “Excuse me, I need toget through.” Can you imagine the answer to that?THE IDEAL WIDTHSo what is the ideal aisle width? Two feet is still a little tight, so Irecommend a minimum of three feet between your boxes. It turned out that foraccessibility, kneeling, working, and harvesting, the ideal distance was 3 oreven 4 feet between boxes. In fact, if your garden has several boxes, you canvary the aisles. Play around with some ideas on paper—then, once your boxes arebuilt (and before you fill them with soil, I should add), you can move themabout until you get them just right. Think of it as arranging furniture in youryard.DRESS IT UPThe aisle space between your boxes can be left in grass or covered with any typeof ground cover. In our TV show, we tried all sorts of things to create somevery interesting looking aisles. At other times, we just removed any weeds orgrass, then laid down weed cloth and covered it with materials that werecomfortable for walking on such as crushed stone, compost, or ground bark.Image [../images/f0035-01.jpg]Image [../images/8-red.jpg] NEW GRIDS—PROMINENT AND PERMANENTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]When I wrote the first book on Square Foot Gardening more than twenty-five yearsago, I advocated laying out a 12 × 12-inch grid for the garden. Then, in mytravels around the country, I heard a lot of people say, “Oh, I do Square FootGardening,” or “I have a Square Foot Garden.” But when I went to see them, thesize was right but they had no grid!In our introductory film, we show the people in our class how a 4×4-foot gardenlooks without a grid and ask them, “How many plants could you plant there? Howmany different crops?” They draw a blank because it looks like a small area thatisn’t going to contain very much. As soon as we lay down the grid, they suddenlylight up and say, “Aha! I see! Sixteen spaces, so it’ll take sixteen differentcrops! Later, as soon as one square is harvested, I can add a trowel full ofcompost and replant that square foot with a different crop without disturbinganything else around it.” Bingo! They see the light.Image [../images/f0036-01.jpg]See how the grid defines a Square Foot Garden? Without a grid, it’s hard tovisualize the harvest.There are many, many interrelated reasons for the “different crop in everySquare Foot” rule, and you will see and understand these as we go along. Theydeal with nutrients used, limiting over-ambitious planting, staggered harvests,weed and pest control, beauty of the garden, companion planting, simplificationof crop rotation, cutting planting time in half, and many more factors thatresult in a very unusual and innovative gardening system. When you have no grid,your garden has no character. If you’re having visitors over, they may not evennotice your garden if it’s laid out in plain beds. But if it’s a Square FootGarden with very prominent and visible grids, they will say, “Hey, what’s thatin your yard? It looks great!”GRID MATERIALSIn the past, whenever I used string or twine as a grid, it eventually got dirty,rotted, and finally broke. In addition, you had to drive in nails to tie thestring to, and it just never looked good. I talked with many others who had thesame bad experience so I experimented with all kinds of different materials formaking grids. If I could condense thirty years of experience into my currentadvice, it would be—don’t use string or any other floppy material. A firm,rigid, prominent, and visual grid permanently laid on every one of your boxeswill make all the difference in the world as others see it but mostly in how youuse and enjoy your garden.With a very visible grid, your garden takes on a unique character. It will notonly look spectacular, but you’ll be able to immediately visualize your plantingsquares. Without a grid, your garden is not a Square Foot Garden.Image [../images/9-red.jpg] NEW IDEA—DON’T WASTE SEEDSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]NEW SEED PLANTING IDEAWhen I first started gardening, I found the traditional method of pouring out anentire packet of seeds along a single row was so wasteful that I couldn’tbelieve that’s the way we’ve always done it. Didn’t the pioneers have to carrytheir own seeds all the way across the country? They couldn’t order a new batchover the Internet from a seed company every year, could they? Didn’t they teacheveryone to be frugal and not wasteful? Why would anyone tell us to waste awhole packet of seeds along a long, lonely, single row, especially knowing thatwe would have to go back and thin out 95 percent of the sprouted plants in orderto leave only one plant every few inches. Did no one ever think, “Let’s justplant a few seeds every 3, 4, or 6 inches?” I guess it took someone outside ofthe garden industry to think of it.Image [../images/f0037-01.jpg]When your seeds sprout from the pinch of seeds you planted in your squares, snipout all but one of them.In the first SFG book, I advocated single seed planting at the proper spacingfor that particular plant, but many people found it tedious and even difficult,especially with small, unusually shaped seeds. Besides, as someone once teasedme and said, “If a packet of leaf lettuce contains one thousand seeds and I onlyplant four in each square foot, how old will I be before it is time to buyanother packet?” She’ll have to leave her seeds in her will!So back to the drawing board I went. How about just a few seeds in eachhole—just a pinch of seeds? After testing this idea with many people andchecking their dexterity and ability to pick up just a pinch (two or threeseeds), this seemed to be the answer.A SNIP, NOT A TUGImage [../images/f0038-01.jpg]The best feature of the All New Square Foot Gardening method is that it makesgardening accessible to everyone.But I was against thinning—that’s when you pull out all the seedlings except theone plant you want to grow to maturity. Thinning is a lot of work and also seemsto disturb the roots of the remaining plant, and that’s not good. But then Ithought of an absolutely perfect solution. If you plant just a few seeds—apinch—in each hole and two or three seedlings come up, you just take a pair ofscissors and snip off all but the strongest one. That eliminates any disturbanceof the plant you want to keep, and you’re not tempted to replant the others. Theonly thing you need to do is just muster the courage to make that initial snipand it’s all over.So now we’ve been able to improve the single-seed planting and, at the sametime, end up with one strong plant in each location, which is just what wewanted. At the same time we’re not wasting a lot of seeds. After planting thatsquare foot, put the packet in safe storage, and if stored properly that packetwill be good next year, and the year after, and the year after. Many seeds lastup to five years if stored properly. (So, how come no one ever told us thatbefore?)Image [../images/10-red.jpg] NEW OPPORTUNITIES—TABLETOP GARDENSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]MAKE THEM PORTABLENow that we no longer need to improve our existing soil—and SFG takes up only 20percent of the space for 100 percent of the harvest—and we need only 6 inches oflightweight soil mix, we can build a 4 × 4-foot box, and add a plywood bottomdrilled with drainage holes. This means you can carry it to any location youwant, even moving it to suit weather, climate, an event, a situation, or even aperson’s needs, abilities, or disabilities. If the size or weight seems too muchfor you to handle, think about using a 3 × 3-foot, a 2 × 2-foot, or even a 2 ×4-foot box for ease in moving.JAMES, BRING OUT THE GOOD BOXESSmaller sized SFG boxes can become wonderful patio boxes, and it’s even possibleto plant several so there is always one or two with flowers in full bloom orsalad crops ready for harvest. The rest can be kept somewhere less visible. Witha system of rotation, there will always be a few garden boxes ready to bring outto show off. There’s nothing like the visual impact of a beautifully planted boxfilled with vegetables, flowers, and/or herbs. If you’re giving a talk or doinga presentation on gardening, the “seeing is believing” technique will cinch yourtalk. And just think, you won’t have to answer the usual question about SFG,like “How on earth can you grow a garden in only 6 inches of soil?” Or, “How canyou grow without fertilizer?” Now, you just point and smile!REASONS TO MOVE YOUR PORTABLE SFG BOXWEATHER—To protect it from:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] FrostImage [../images/square-r.jpg] ThundershowersImage [../images/square-r.jpg] HurricanesImage [../images/square-r.jpg] HailImage [../images/square-r.jpg] SnowImage [../images/square-r.jpg] WindImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Heavy rainImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Intense sunCLIMATE—Move your SFG box for:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] More shade for a spring crop as the weather getshotterImage [../images/square-r.jpg] More sun in early springImage [../images/square-r.jpg] More shade in summertime in desert areasEVENTS—Move it to:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] Enhance or decorate for a poolside party orbarbequeImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Behind the garage for a start-up nurserySITUATIONS—Place the box:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] On a tabletop for a sit-down gardenerImage [../images/square-r.jpg] In the garage if you’re expecting extreme weatherImage [../images/square-r.jpg] On the deck to clear the yard for a football gamePERSONS—You can:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] Take it to Grandma’s for a birthday giftImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Take it to school for show-and-tellImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Take it to class for teaching SFGImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Take it to school for the science fairBEST OF ALLSo there you have it—the ten new major improvements to the Square Foot Gardeningmethod. Each one makes the entire system more productive, the work much easier,and the cost of gardening lower. At the same time, the beginner finds gardeningmuch easier to understand.I think Square Foot Gardening’s best feature is that it now makes gardeningavailable to just about anyone you can think of, regardless of their age,circumstance, location, ability, or disability—anyone, anywhere, can now gardenusing the All New Square Foot Gardening method."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/ch03.jpg]This chapter is going to talk about three basic components of Square FootGardening.Image [../images/square-r.jpg] SizeImage [../images/square-r.jpg] LocationImage [../images/square-r.jpg] DesignSIZEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Your garden will be laid out in square or rectangular boxes separated by walkingaisles. Build your boxes from materials like wood, bricks, or blocks. If youdon’t like the idea of common wood, which will eventually rot or be eaten bytermites, use a more expensive wood like cedar or redwood. You can even use someof the manmade composite “wood” or recycled plastic or vinyl. The wood I likebest is free wood. You can usually get it from any construction site, but alwaysask the foreman first.Image [../images/f0041-01.jpg]If you decide to use lumber, you’ll be happy to know the advantage of 4 × 4gardens is that all lumber comes in 8-foot lengths. Most home improvementcenters will cut it in half for you at little or no cost. Your boxes can be madefrom just about any material except treated wood because the chemicals used totreat the wood are not something you want leaching into your garden.HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?If you’re figuring a SFG for an adult, remember that:1. One 4 × 4 Square Foot Garden box (equal to 16 square feet) will supply enoughproduce to make a salad for one person every day of the growing season.2. One more 4 × 4 box will supply the daily supper vegetables for that person.3. Just one more 4 × 4 box will supply that person with extra of everything forpreserving, special crops, showing off, or giving away.So, each adult needs one, two, or three large boxes of 4 × 4, depending on howmuch they want. In square feet, that is 16, 32, or 48 square feet.Image [../images/f0042-01.jpg]If you’re figuring a SFG for a child, remember that:1. One 3 × 3 Square Foot Garden box (equal to 9 square feet) will supply enoughproduce to make a salad for one child every day of the growing season.2. One more 3 × 3 box will supply supper vegetables for that child every day.3. Just one more 3 × 3 box will supply the child with extra of everything forshow-and-tell or science projects at school, special crops, showing off, orgiving away. So, each child needs one, two, or three small boxes of 3 × 3,depending on how much they will eat. In square feet, that’s 9, 18, or 27 squarefeet.Suggestion: Since the kids will grow into teenagers, you may just want to makeeveryone’s box a 4 × 4. On the other hand, different sizes make the garden lookinteresting and more personable. The 3 × 3 can later on be stacked on top of a 4× 4 to start a pyramid garden—but more about designing your garden later.YOUR FAMILY—YOUR GARDENImage [../images/dotline.jpg]According to surveys of homeowners, the average conventional single-row gardenmeasures 20 feet wide by 35 feet long, which equals 700 square feet. To grow thesame amount, a Square Foot Garden will need only 20 percent or one-fifth of thatgrowing space to equal 140 square feet. That’s quite a difference isn’t it?YOUR FAMILY—YOUR GARDENImage [../images/f0043-01.jpg]DOWN TO SIZEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Whenever I’m giving a lecture I like to illustrate the difference between aconventional garden and a Square Foot Garden. I’ll walk down the middle ofwhatever room we’re in and, standing in the center, stretch out my armssideways, as I say, “If this whole room were our garden, when you switch toSquare Foot Gardening, you’ll no longer need everything on this side.” That cutsthe room in half. Then I turn to the side that remains, cut it in half with myarms again, and say, “Everything on that side we don’t need.” That cuts thathalf in half again. And then I add, “That’s still too much room. We can stillcut down this remaining corner even more so we end up with only 20 percent ofthe total room. We can grow as much in this size of a Square Foot Garden as wepreviously could in this entire room.”Image [../images/f0043-02.jpg]Try it in the room you’re in right now and see if you aren’t impressed. Yousuddenly begin to think of the reduced amount of work, equipment, supplies, andfencing. Then you begin to see many of the advantages of being able to locatethe garden where you wish and all the possibilities in your yard. Visualizingthe great difference of space needed for a Square Foot Garden is really thefirst step in learning and appreciating the entire system. Then you can begin totake advantage of all the other attributes you will discover with SFG.ALL THAT IN ONE BOXHow much salad could you pick every day from this little garden? More than youcan imagine. So as an illustration, I’ve listed below examples of what you canharvest from just one 4 × 4 box in one spring season:Image [../images/f0044-01.jpg]START SMALLImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Once you decide on the final size and layout of your garden, keep in mind youdon’t have to build the entire garden right at the start. Try a three-phase planinstead.If you build and plant just one-third of your ultimate garden boxes and grow forone season—for example, the spring season—you can then see how much you’llharvest and see if you’ve correctly judged the amount you really need. Then youcan go into phase two, or the summer crop, and build more boxes according toyour layout or master plan. At the end of the summer crop, move on to phasethree, building more boxes if you still need them, to prepare for planting afall crop.Yes, it’s okay to lay out the whole area and to design it for the ultimate,depending on how big your family is and how much you think you want to harvest.Just don’t do everything the first season. I’ve seen so many people start outtoo ambitiously, and they become overwhelmed because they underestimate how muchthey can actually grow in such a small area. Their gardens are actually largerthan they need so there is more to take care of—and all while they’re learning anew system. Take it easy and start small.If you have a single-row garden and don’t really want to give it up yet, Isuggest taking one small corner of your old-fashioned garden and planting it injust one or two 4 × 4 boxes, mix the correct soil (don’t just shovel yourexisting soil into the boxes no matter how good you think it is), put down thegrid, and try planting this way. Next year, I’ll bet you’ll probably be ready toconvert your entire garden into a SFG.OVERALL SIZE OF THE BOXESOnce you decide on the overall size and number of boxes, the next step is todetermine the dimension of the aisles. We’ll cover this in more detail later,but for now you can figure on a 3-foot aisle between all 4-foot boxes. You couldalso decide now if you want to join several boxes together end to end to createa rectangular box of 4 × 8, or 4 × 12. This will save a lot of yard space butyou may not like the look or you may find walking around a long boxinconvenient. I would never make a box longer than 16 feet or you’ll end uptrying to cross it in the middle and then—whoops!—there you are, stepping inyour garden. I hope no one saw you! If you are going to be putting some boxesagainst a fence or wall and can’t walk all around to reach in, those boxesshould be only 2 feet wide. Everyone wants to make them 3 feet wide (I willnever know why) but then they always come back and complain it was too widebecause they couldn’t reach in that far.“Gardening has always seemed too overwhelming. Now with your method, I can’twait to start.”—Alejiendra from VenezuelaDON’T FORGET THE AISLESThe whole idea of Square Foot Gardening is to walk around your garden boxes andreach in to tend your plants. This way, the soil never gets packed down and youeliminate digging it up to loosen it again. In fact, the only tool you reallyneed once you fill your boxes with Mel’s Mix is a small hand trowel. (It doesn’thave to be the strong, expensive kind from Sweden. The one dollar variety worksjust fine and can last a lifetime.)So how wide should your aisles be? It depends a lot on how much room you haveand what kind of a look you want for your garden. If you’re going to have manyboxes—remember, we suggest you begin using only a small number because you canalways add more later—you may want to have, for example, a center aisle that is4 feet wide so you can easily get in with a garden cart or wheelbarrow, or soseveral people can walk down the aisle at once. (Hey, how about a garden partyor a wedding?)Image [../images/f0046-01.jpg]DRAW IT UPOnce you get a rough idea of how much space you’ll need, make a quick sketchmore or less to scale. You don’t need graph paper (unless you’re a designer orwant to use it); just draw the 3-foot aisles slightly smaller than the 4-footboxes. Now you’re ready to tour your property looking for nice open areas nearthe house. Later in this chapter we’ll discuss design in more detail.LOCATIONImage [../images/dotline.jpg]There are five major things to look for when touring your property for a SFGlocation. Use these as a test for the area you’re considering for your All NewSquare Foot Garden. (Remember, convenience is king so make sure you follow Rule1.)1. Place it close to the house for convenience.2. Pick an area that gets six to eight hours of sunshine daily.3. Stay clear of trees and shrubs where roots and shade may interfere.4. The area should not puddle after a heavy rain.5. The existing soil is not really important, since you won’t be using it.1. CLOSE TO THE HOUSEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]With the All New Square Foot Gardening Method, you have so many more places toput your garden than ever before.Keep in mind foot traffic and sites where you will often notice and enjoy yourgarden. If your SFG is near traffic paths, you’ll walk past the garden moreoften, hence take better care of it (remember—no need to change into gardeningclothes, or run and get some tools). This means it will always look nice and theend result will be that you’ll enjoy it more as will every other member of thefamily. (Chapter 10 [ch10.html#ch10] covers different locations like hillsidesor heavily wooded areas.)I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOWWhen you think about observing your garden, consider where you can frequentlysee it—especially from inside the house. What room are you in the most? Can yousee the garden from there? The reason is not only for your pleasure but forprotection. If it is close, you will see problems (like deer, wilting plants, aneighbor’s dog or cat) when they begin rather than hours later after all thedamage is done.Remember the Square Foot Garden way is to treat your plants just like you treatyour children or grandchildren, and you know you would be glancing out thewindow at them. I believe that every plant out there is constantly seeking yourattention by saying, “Look at me, look at my new blossom, look how big I’mgetting.” Isn’t that just like children?Placement of your Square Foot Garden opens up so many doors to the way you carefor, enjoy, appreciate, and harvest it. Plus you’ll show it off more often andget the whole family involved. It’s even possible to split up your garden andplace some of your boxes in different locations for perhaps a different visualeffect or a different purpose.Image [../images/f0048-01.jpg]2. SUNLIGHTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The next thing to consider in selecting a location is sunlight. Growing plantsneed sunlight. How much they need depends on the type of plant. In general,large-flowering or fruiting plants need a lot—at least eight hours a day. Thesetypes of plants are referred to as a “summer crop” or “warm-weather plants” andinclude most of the favorite things that people grow, such as tomatoes, peppers,squash, beans, and sunflowers.In determining the amount of sunlight an area receives, keep in mind that itchanges throughout the year with the seasons. In early spring and again in latefall the sun is lower in the sky than in the summertime. And of course, thereare not as many hours of light in the day in the spring and fall as there are inthe summer.IF YOU ONLY HAVE SHADEIf you have shady conditions and no other place to locate your garden, you canstill have a thriving garden but you’ll have a limited selection of crops togrow. So, obviously, you’d stay away from the tomatoes, peppers, and squash andplant the root and leaf crops like radishes, spinach, and lettuce. Of course,there are many flowers and herbs that love shade, so check with your localnursery if you are in this situation.TOO MUCH SUNSometimes you might have a location that gets full sun all day long, from sunupto sundown. That would actually be too much for some of the cool weather andleafy crops, as well as many flowers. Of course, with a big, huge garden there’snot much you can do. But with a Square Foot Garden, it’s very easy to provideshade by building a simple support and covering the 4 × 4 box with some shadecloth. That’s all covered in Chapter 4 [ch04.html#ch04].“I want to convert my entire garden to your method.”—Guy from Utah3. AVOID TREES AND SHRUBSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]When choosing your SFG location, stay clear of trees and shrubs for two reasons.The first is shade as we just discussed. Second, if they sense a well-wateredperfect soil nearby, these roots will come straight as an arrow into your soil.If that’s the only location you have, then there is a way to counteract thatsituation. Put a plywood bottom on your boxes and raise them up off the ground.You can raise them up by just putting a brick under each corner and one in thecenter. Or you can use a cement block, or even two blocks and build little piersand have it as a garden you sit down beside to harvest. Then, of course, thetree’s roots won’t even know that the garden is there. This is a nice way tohave a shade garden right under a tree along with a bench or a few lawn chairs.Keep in mind that shrubs are just as bad as trees as far as providing shade androot interference. Most shrubs are more shallow-rooted than trees. Keep in mind,too, that as trees and shrubs grow, their shade will increasingly cover a largerarea.4. NO PUDDLES, PLEASEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Roots will drown in accumulated and stagnant water, so you don’t want to locateyour SFG in an area that holds water after a rain. The materials in Mel’s Mix,though they drain well and hold a lot of moisture, will soak up all the water ina standing puddle and your plant roots will be harmed. Areas that puddle alsopromise mud in the aisles, which makes gardening less fun.If you have no other place and can’t drain the area, then of course you couldfill in the low area with sand to raise your box slightly and/or you could againput a bottom on it and raise it up with stones, bricks, cinder blocks, orsomething similar.5. EXISTING SOIL—WHO CARES?Image [../images/dotline.jpg]When you’re choosing a location, it doesn’t really matter about the condition ofyour existing soil. Many of the other gardening books tell you how to go aroundthe yard and dig test holes and see what kind of soil you have. Sometimes you’reeven supposed to make a percolation test, in which you have to dig a hole, fillit with water, see how long it takes to drain, blah, blah, blah . . .. Or, howabout all the unnecessary advice on how to take a soil test and what the resultsmean? Forget about all that now. You don’t have to know about it because we’renot going to use your existing soil. We’re going to build bottomless boxes abovethe ground. You can even put your boxes on the pavement or a patio and it won’tmake any difference.Image [../images/f0050-01.jpg]THE ENVELOPE, PLEASEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The best location is where you can see your garden more often from moredirections. Things like sunlight and avoiding trees and shrubs are merelyprecautions to help make your garden more successful. So walk around your yardand think about the best place to locate and enjoy your garden.DESIGNImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Now that you’ve determined how many boxes you’ll have and strolled around youryard to find the best spot(s), it’s time to think about design. You can lay outyour boxes so they turn corners, even intersect each other, but keep in mindtraffic and walking around. Don’t make dead ends or narrow places. Keep 3- or4-foot aisles, and leave bigger areas for chairs, benches, and entranceways.Here is a fun idea: explain to the entire family the basic size and layout thenlet each member draw up ideas and plans. Maybe everyone could have an area todesign, build, and plant. Wouldn’t that be a great family project? Then, take apicture and send it to me so we can share all kinds of designs with others.LINE THEM UPYou can probably guess that, being a former army officer, I am going to want allthe boxes lined up neatly and precisely, even perhaps having them in a row (oh,what an unfortunate word)—excuse me—in a line. I might want the entire area tobe a square or at the very least a rectangle . . but that’s just me. How aboutyou—do you want a U-shape or an L-shape? Do whatever appeals to you.GARDENS AREN’T JUST FOR YARDS ANYMOREHere’s another idea—no matter the season, you can build a SFG box with a plywoodbottom and place it on your patio or picnic tabletop near your back door. Youmay want to use smaller SFG boxes on the patio or deck such as 2 × 2 or 2 × 4.BE CREATIVEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]You don’t have to be a landscape architect to measure and draw up what youimagine. The design is just as important as the size. You’re going to bespending a lot of your time in your SFG—not working or weeding, but justenjoying and relaxing. Be sure to make room for some chairs, a bench, a waterfountain, or a bird bath. One of the advantages of a Square Foot Garden is thatyou have options in how you put it together so that it’s perfect for you.Seeing a picture is so helpful. If you want to see what others have done intheir yard with Square Foot Gardening, go to www.squarefootgardening.com[http://www.squarefootgardening.com] and click on “Neighborhood Gardens.”Everyone likes to see what others have done, so take the garden tour and seewhich one you like the best. And then let your imagination help you create theSquare Foot Garden that is perfect for you."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/ch04.jpg]If you like to build things, you are going to love this chapter. A Square FootGarden can be a lot like working with Erector® sets, Lincoln Logs®, or Legos®.Since SFG grows so much in so little space and is made with readily availablematerials, the basic box projects outlined in this chapter won’t take all yourtime, space, or money.WHY BOXES?Image [../images/dotline.jpg]Just as a reminder, there are several reasons we build boxes for our Square FootGardens.1. Looks neat and tidy.2. Organizes and simplifies your gardening chores.3. Holds a special soil mix aboveground.4. It’s easy to add protective features.If your garden is boxed in, it has already-established limits for you. And ifyou make sure to add a grid, it establishes not only a pattern but a formula forsuccess.Boxes also hold your perfect soil mix so that it doesn’t spill out or wash awayin a heavy rainstorm. When garden beds have no borders between plant-growingsoil and walkways, there’s a greater chance that someone will step into thegrowing soil—a big no-no for this SFG method.Let’s start with the basic 4 × 4 SFG box. Examples of box materials that can beused include:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] Natural woodImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Manmade woodImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Recycled plasticImage [../images/square-r.jpg] VinylImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Or any other manmade material available in lumbersizesRECOMMENDED MATERIAL SIZEImage [../images/square-r.jpg] 1 × 6-inch lumber for the most economical, lowtraffic garden; orImage [../images/square-r.jpg] 2 × 6-inch lumber for sturdier boxes or heavytraffic garden areas.“SFG is more than a hobby, it’s a movement.”—Ross from South CarolinaImage [../images/ch04a.jpg]MATERIALSImage [../images/f0054-01.jpg]Make sure you’ve got all you need: four 4-foot 2 × 6-inch boards, 6 four-footwood lath boards, weed cloth, Mel’s Mix, wood screws, a power drill, and yourseeds.PREPARATIONImage [../images/f0054-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0054-03.jpg]Stack your four boards and pre-drill 3 holes in one end of each boardASSEMBLYImage [../images/f0055-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0055-03.jpg]Screw 3 large, coarse-thread deck screws through the pre-drilled holes,attaching the boards end-to-end, until you have a complete frame.Image [../images/f0055-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0055-04.jpg]Once assembled, move the box to your chosen location, remove grass or weeds, andcover that spot with weed cloth.COMPLETIONImage [../images/f0055-05.jpg]Image [../images/f0055-06.jpg]Fill the box with Mel’s Mix until it covers the bottom and then water. (Do thisthree times until your box is full.) Then, add your wood lath grid and plant!Image [../images/f0056-01.jpg]Stack your lumber like steps. Once you drill the top piece, slide the board backto expose the next one.All types of lumber come in 8-foot lengths and multiples of 2 feet thereafter.Since most SFGs will be 4 × 4 feet, ask the lumber company to cut your8-foot-long wood in half when you buy it. They usually do this for free. Thenit’s easier to take home, quicker to assemble, and eliminates any need forsawing. All types of wood can be used: pine, fir, cedar, or even redwood (whichis more expensive but longer-lasting), but don’t use treated lumber.Image [../images/coin.jpg] PENNY PINCHERMy idea of the best kind of wood is free wood. Go to any construction site, tellthe foreman you are building a Square Foot Garden, and ask if they have anyscrap lumber. Chances are they will be throwing out just what you need. They mayeven cut it for you if you ask nicely. Then your box is free.ROTATE CORNERSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]When constructing your SFG box, cut all four pieces of your wood sides to thesame length, and then rotate the corners to ensure you end up with a square box.If you want a different look than the rotated corners, measure the thickness ofthe lumber and subtract that from two of the sides and add it to the other twosides so you still end up with a square box. It is not critical that your gardenbox be exactly 48 inches either inside or outside, but it should be square soeach square foot planting area is the same size. Attach your box withcoarse-thread deck screws that are twice as long as the thickness of the lumber.Use three screws per corner. Pre-drill your holes in the first piece of the twopieces you’re connecting; the threads will embed themselves into the second.Image [../images/f0057-01.jpg]This is an example of corner construction; the side of one board is attached tothe end of another, with three deck screws.CONSTRUCTION DETAILSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Work on a hard surface—like a driveway, pavement, or sidewalk—and keep yourframe flat so it won’t end up crooked or twisted. When your frame is all screwedtogether, carry it to the garden area, lay it down, and see how it looks. If youwant to preserve the wood, you could use linseed oil. It’s also possible topaint or stain the bottom, outside, and top. Leave the inside unpainted sothere’s no possible contamination to the growing mix.Image [../images/f0057-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0058-01.jpg]For proper drainage, drill holes in the plywood bottom of your tabletopgarden—one per square foot and one extra in each corner.OTHER BOX MATERIALSSFG boxes can also be constructed with brick, cement blocks, prefabricatedstone, or large rocks. Stone for your SFG box can be manmade preformed sizes ornatural slate, round, riverbed, or any other type of decorative stone that iseasy to place and forms an interesting border.PLYWOOD BOTTOMIf you decide to create a bottom for your SFG, use plywood sheeting and drill1/4-inch drainage holes, one per square foot plus an extra hole in each corner.You attach this bottom by putting it on top of the assembled box sides, screwingit down, then flipping it over so the box sides are sitting on top of theplywood bottom.Plywood thickness depends on the size of the box. A 2 × 2 or 2 × 3 box—anythingspanning less than 3 feet—needs 1/2-inch plywood. Your 4 × 4-foot boxes need5/8- or even 3/4-inch plywood bottoms. Use the ¾-inch plywood if you are goingto move it often. If the box is going to rest on sawhorses or cement blocks andspan a large, unsupported distance, it requires thicker plywood. I use regularplywood although some like to spend extra for the longer lasting, but much moreexpensive, marine or waterproof plywood.SPECIAL STRUCTURESImage [../images/dotline.jpg]For out-of-season gardening, you can create spring, summer, fall, and/or winterboxes. These are just 4 × 4 foot standard garden boxes or smaller 2 × 4 sizethat can be modified for special uses; we’ll explain that in Chapter 9[ch09.html#ch09]. Depending on the time of year, boxes can be equipped withdouble decks, extensions, covers, or special modifications to allow a longergrowing season. Usually these modifications are weather-related items likecovers to shade tender seedlings in the summer or a frost protector either inspring or fall. You will determine the best modifications, depending on yourparticular weather and environmental conditions.RAILING BOXESImage [../images/dotline.jpg]If you have flat railings, it is very easy to set a box right on top of it. Forstability, it should be bolted to the wood railing. If you can’t bolt your boxesdown and you’re higher than the first floor, I would place the boxes on thefloor. Consider the strength and size of your railing and the surroundingenvironment, and make sure your railing boxes aren’t too big.Image [../images/f0059-01.jpg]You can build a Square Foot Garden box that bolts to your deck railing.Railing boxes make a very decorative and excellent garden, particularly if youadd trailing types of plants that add some color and character. There arevarious holders sold at home improvement stores that snap onto your railings toaccommodate standard-sized boxes. Hang the box over the outside edge, and itwon’t take up any of your valuable deck space, and, should it drip when you’rewatering, the water will bypass the deck below. However, if your box is on theinside of the railing, it would be much safer.PYRAMID BOXESImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Be creative and make your SFG uniquely yours. Why not get fancy and stack one ontop of another to create pyramids? Why would you do that? Because they’respectacular, and they will be the highlight and focal point of your entiregarden. Construction is very simple with just a few braces for stability.STEP UP, YOUNG LADYThe next fancy garden layout would be to make a standard 4-foot wide by anylength box but every 2 or 4 feet step up by one level. There are manyarrangements you could design, and they would be limited only by yourimagination. Build them the same way as the corner pyramid with an inside bracefor every 4-foot section.Image [../images/f0060-01.jpg]One-foot-square boxes are the perfect size for the steps leading to your frontdoor.MAKE BOXES EXTRA DEEPMaking boxes that are extra deep mean they are extra dramatic. I know I’ve toldyou that 6 inches of Mel’s Mix is enough for all plants, but your garden becomesmore dramatic when the container is extra tall. If you decide to build your boxtaller, just use 8-, 10-, or 12-inch lumber instead of the normal 6 inches. Theonly drawback is cost. But no matter—you’re after a dramatic, spectacular looknow. Since the plants don’t need more than 6 inches of Mel’s Mix, don’t spendyour money on filling the entire depth with Mel’s Mix. Use sand (cheap andavailable at any home improvement center) on the bottom layer. “I’ll just use myexisting yard soil,” someone says “and save even more money.” Don’t! Most soilsdon’t drain well and have weed seeds. Remember weeds? We don’t have them anymorein SFG, so if you’re going to multiple layers for your garden boxes, fill anyspace below 6 inches with just ordinary sand.A SPECIAL BOX FOR CARROTS, LEEKS, AND POTATOESThere is one last item that you might want to construct—your high-rise boxes forcarrots, leeks, and potatoes. These root crops need deep soil so instead ofdigging down as in most gardening methods, we take the easy way and build up.Build a 1 × 1-foot box either 6, 9, or 12 inches tall out of plywood or any thintype of lumber. See Chapter 6 [ch06.html#ch06] for details on planting andgrowing.GRIDS AND MATERIALSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Grids are a must. Every box should have its own permanent and prominent grid.I’m so adamant about having a grid on every box I tell people that if your SFGdoesn’t have a grid, it is not a Square Foot Garden. But with a grid, it’s anattractive, unusual, and unique garden. It tells the story of SFG in one glance.In addition it has many unseen benefits, so stick with me on this one and builda grid for all of your boxes.Image [../images/coin.jpg] PENNY PINCHERINEXPENSIVE GRIDSI used to search home improvement centers for wood or plastic molding, or stripsof any type of material that was straight. But they were expensive. Then I foundtwo materials that are just perfect and cheap.BLINDSThe first Penny Pincher tip is slat-type or Venetian blinds. They come in manywidths and lengths, and if you visit a local thrift shop you can usually find aused set at a great price. Find one that’s at least 4 feet wide. Cut off thestrings and lay out the strips. Trim the ends with a pair of scissors so theyfit your box, drill holes at the half and quarter points, and attach themtogether with some sort of screw, nail, or snap-fastener. The one problem I’vefound with blinds is their weight. When you first start your garden in thespring, it’s usually windy. Sometimes the blinds blow around a little justbecause the garden is empty and they have no protection from the wind. Onesolution is to attach them to the soil with a long galvanized nail at every12-inch intersection. This helps hold them down so they don’t blow away.WOOD LATHThe second inexpensive material is wood lath, which is sold in home improvementcenters. Believe it or not, they already come 4 feet long with square ends.Sometimes they’re a little crooked, filled with knots, or break easily, so sortthrough them. But they’re very, very inexpensive—less than a quarter each. Onceyou lay them out and drill holes at the 12-inch intersections, they’re very easyto connect together with a nut and bolt or some other type of fastener. Becausethe wood lath is rigid, it can span from one side of the box to the other sidein case your Mel’s Mix is not level with the top of the box. Otherwise, it canjust lie on top of the soil. If your grid spans across the box sides, keep thegrid from moving about by drilling a hole in the ends of the two center slatsand screwing them to your wooden box. Some people like to take the wood lathgrid up for the winter so it doesn’t get wet and rot as easily. Unscrew the fourscrews, fold the grid, and hang it on the garage wall. Put the screws in aplastic bag and hang it up with the grid to keep the screws safe and dry overthe winter.Image [../images/f0062-01.jpg]Drill a hole through both pieces of wood at each grid intersection.Image [../images/f0063-01.jpg]Next, insert some kind of hardware to loosely hold the grid together.Image [../images/f0063-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0063-03.jpg]Drill a hole through the end of the center grids and add 4 deck screws.Image [../images/f0064-01.jpg]Once the grid is attached, your square foot garden is ready for planting.Image [../images/f0064-02.jpg]FUN IDEASYou may be able to find other scrap wood strips around. Carpenters often havestrips left over. You just have to keep your eyes open. “Quick, Henry, stop thecar. I saw something back there.” Or, if you have a table saw, it’s easy enoughto cut strips of wood yourself. The wood or blind grids can be painted, whichkids love to do, creating fancy combinations of colors. For the best visualeffect, I think plain white is best. (Kids will say, “Blah!”) You can also writeon them. (Kids will say, “Cool!”) Some people like to record what they’veplanted. It’s fun to have visitors sign your grid, especially children andgrandchildren. Let them pick out which square they like best, and tell them itcan be theirs. When they call, you can tell them how their plants are doing. Ibet they’ll call more often.PROTECTING YOUR SFGTo protect one or more squares next to each other from weather or pests, thefirst step is to make a wire U-frame cage to fit over those squares. You maywant to make several U-frames of different sizes that can be used for 1, 2, or 4square feet and another for an entire 4 × 4 block of 16 square feet. Basically,you want to make a wire cage that will fit over the top of each of these areas.Later you can attach a covering made from any number of materials to protectthose squares from a variety of hazards. I’ve found that the easiest cage ismade from plastic-coated wire fencing. This can be cut with wire pliers andeasily bent over a straight edge to almost any shape. You can make a four-sidedwire box from two U-frames or just a two-sided one. There is quite a variety offencing wire to choose from so check out what is available. It comes in rolls ofdifferent widths and lengths as well as different openings and wire thicknesses.You may want to call ahead to several places to find the best choice.Image [../images/f0065-01.jpg]To build a protective cage for your 4 × 4 garden, you’ll need: four one inch bytwo inch boards, 4 feet long; chicken wire; plastic ties; cutting shears; and apower drill.Image [../images/f0066-01.jpg]Arrange your boards as shown in this photo and drill two holes in one end ofeach board.Image [../images/f0066-02.jpg]Attach the boards with two coarse-thread deck screws using your power drill.Image [../images/f0067-01.jpg]Roll out one long piece of chicken wire and place your frame close to thecenter. Bracing the frame with your foot, bend the chicken wire up. Then, dothis again for the other side. Remember to wear gloves!CHICKEN WIREAnother common material I like to use is chicken wire. It comes in smaller1-inch openings or larger 2-inch openings. The 1-inch size is much stronger butwill cost a little more. The 1-inch size also takes a little longer to bend intoshape but will keep out more critters than the 2-inch size. Chicken wire can becut with pliers or cutting shears. It’s sharp, so be sure to wear gloves. Youcan buy a whole roll of it, 3 or 4 feet wide. In many hardware stores you canbuy whatever length you want from their roll, and they will cut it for you!FULL CAGEA chicken wire cage over the entire 4 × 4 makes it fairly easy to protect yourgarden against unwanted rabbits, birds that dig up and eat newly planted seeds,cats that like to dig in the soil, too much sunon newly planted and delicate seedlings, or strong wind gusts during the windyseason. Build your wire cage to fit the plants’ mature sizes. (Once plants startgrowing through the wire, it is very difficult to take the cage off.) Grab thecage wire with your fingers and lift the whole thing off, tend to the plants,and then put it back down. A full cage needs a wooden-frame bottom for support,but it then fits nicely on your wooden garden box frame. See how everything inSFG fits together so nicely, just like Legos.CONSTRUCTIONTo make a wooden bottom for a wire cage, attach four pieces of 1 × 2 inch pinelumber 4 feet long in a box shape with two deck screws at each corner. Then cutand shape your chicken wire or fencing wire to the 4 × 4 box to create anyheight you want. Staple the wire to the wood frame using 3/8-inch staples, andthen wire or tie the vertical corners together or wherever the wire forms acorner. If you are using chicken wire or any wire that has sharp edges, you maywant to cover the sharp points—including where the wire is stapled to thewood—with something like duct tape (choose a nice color) to prevent gettingscratched while you’re moving your cover. Another way is to attach the wire tothe inside of the 1×2 frame. It’s a little more work to staple the wire to theinside, but there won’t be any sharp points to scratch you. If you have a coupleof these cages made up ahead of time—one or two that are 6 inches tall, anothercouple 12 inches tall, and a few at 18 inches tall—they will be available at theright time they’re needed for your garden. Don’t forget you can use them as aframework for spring protection from cold, cats, or crows. They can be summerprotection from sun, wind, and rain, and fall protection from deer, frosts, andsnow. They can be stacked on the ground in a pile or hung on the garage or fencewall.Image [../images/f0068-01.jpg]Brace the frame with your foot and bend the chicken wire up.Image [../images/f0069-01.jpg]Once the wire is bent on all sides, remove the wood frame and connect the fourcorners at three locations using the plastic ties.Image [../images/f0069-02.jpg]Set your wire frame over the wood frame and connect the wire with the plasticties. Use the ties at random points on top of the frame, too.Image [../images/f0070-01.jpg]The frame is lightweight and is easy to lift off your 4 × 4. Remove it to water,plant, prune, or harvest.Image [../images/f0070-02.jpg]When placing your protective cage, make sure the frames line up. This will keepall kinds of critters from taking your harvest.COVERSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Materials used for covering the wire cages can be anything from clear plastic toprotect plants from wind or cold weather and snow, sleet, or rain—to some sortof cloth like cheesecloth or floating cover to protect plants from insectsgetting in to lay their eggs.Image [../images/f0071-01.jpg]Bend two 10-foot PVC pipes of 1/2-inch diameter from corner to corner.CLOTHESPINSA cover can be easily held in place with clothespins. The cover can be open onsome sides to allow air to circulate or it can be completely enclosed. Oneconsideration, of course, is whether too much heat will build up inside thecage, and that depends on the season and the amount of sunlight your gardenreceives in your area. When there is too much sunlight for newly plantedtransplants, just put a shade cloth over the top of your cage. If you haveseveral newly planted squares among other well-established plant squares, youcan attach shade patches over just those plants that need a little shade.PROTECTIVE DOME SUPPORTSA dome support is so easy to make. Just bend a 10-foot length of 1/2-inch PVCpipe from corner to corner of your box, and then another from the oppositecorners; then tie or bolt it at the intersection at the top to make a dome thatcan support any type of cover. Think of it as the structural framework for agreenhouse—in the early spring it can be covered with clear plastic, in the latespring with cheesecloth to keep out egg-laying insects, and in the summer withshade cloth to provide a little shade for tender young plants. You can provideprotection the same way for the fall crop.Image [../images/f0072-01.jpg]Your two pipes should make a dome as shown here.Image [../images/f0073-01.jpg]Attach a plastic tie at the intersection to ensure that it doesn’t fall over.Image [../images/f0073-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0074-01.jpg]Use a thick plastic cover to protect your plants from frost. Place some heavyobjects such as bricks on the edges to secure it.COVERED WAGONAnother neat looking PVC frame is one in the shape of a covered wagon. Thistakes a little longer to make and requires just a bit more material, but itgives a lot more room and is much easier to use when you have a cover over theframe. It requires the same two 10-foot long PVC pipes, but they’re arched overeach end of your box. Then, you need an extra 4-foot-long piece of pipe thatbecomes the strut holding the two arches from collapsing. Tying the intersectionwill not work in this design, so you have to drill holes in the center of thearches and in each end of the strut, so that a bolt will connect the centralstrut to the top center of each arch. Use a bolt and nut that won’t tear theplastic or net covering. Now you can see the shape is much more conducive tolifting one side to work inside, and it makes it easier to throw a blanket overthe entire 4 × 4 on a cold night.For those that don’t want such a high frame, you just cut the 10-foot PCV pipesdown to 6 or 8 feet and you’ll have a much lower wagon top. For those of youthinking, “I’ll just buy one 10-footer and cut it in half,” that won’t work. Thearch over a 4-foot span has to be more than 5 feet long.Image [../images/f0075-01.jpg]Locate the center of your two ten foot pipes.Image [../images/f0075-02.jpg]Drill one hole in the center of two 10-foot PVC pipes.Image [../images/f0076-01.jpg]Place each pipe in a corner and bend as shown.Image [../images/f0076-02.jpg]Drill holes in the ends of a 4-foot PVC pipe. It will be the supporting strut.Insert a plastic cable tie through the holes or a nut and a bolt to keep it inplace.PLANT SUPPORTSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]What do you do with heavy fruiting plants such as peppers, eggplants, and giantmarigolds? The easiest way to support the branches of these plants without doinga lot of staking and tying is to make a permanent cage that the plants can growthrough. The cage’s height depends on the height of the mature plants. Thiscould be for 1 square foot, 2, 4, or for the whole 16 square feet in a 4 × 4garden; it all depends on what is planted in each square. The cage can beself-supporting with sides that stick into the soil just like the wire U-framepreviously mentioned, or, if you are making a support for the entire 4 × 4, itis very easy to put a stake of some sort in each corner—either wood or metal—andthen suspend the wire horizontally between these four corners.Even better, if you are supporting the entire 4 × 4-foot area, put in the fourcorner stakes and then horizontally tie on some nylon tomato trellis netting.This netting is available at most garden stores and is particularly good becauseit is soft and cushiony and won’t cut the plants when they rub against it in thewind. It also has large openings you can reach in to and the plants can growthrough. It won’t bother any of the shorter plants either. It is very easymaterial to work with and well-suited for gardening. Corner posts must be verystrong and firmly held so the horizontal wire or netting won’t sag. Posts can beconstructed of wood and driven into the ground or attached with deck screws tothe inside or outside corner of the wood frame. You can also use PVC pipe oreven metal pipe or fence posts. The many options available show how flexibleSquare Foot Gardening can be.HOLD ME UPTall lanky plants such as dahlias, gladiolas, and sunflowers may also need extrasupport as they mature and grow in height. Sunflower seeds will need temporaryprotection when first planted to prevent birds or rabbits from digging up theseeds and to prevent other birds from eating the young sprouts. Temporarilycovering your garden with chicken wire 6 inches over the box will provide thisprotection until the plants get that tall. Then, after the plants reach a heightof about 3 feet, it is time to put in four corner posts—strong steel fence postsand nylon netting horizontally at several different levels. Start the first at 3feet and the last should be as high as the fence posts. This will support plantsthrough to maturity and keep them from falling over in heavy wind andrainstorms.CORN PROTECTIONEveryone loves corn—especially chipmunks, squirrels, and raccoons! To keep themout and your harvest in, try this foolproof secret. Put one steel fence post ineach corner of your 4 × 4 foot garden. Use tall metal 5- or 6-foot fence posts,and then, when corn reaches 4 feet, run chicken wire with 1-inch openings aroundthe outside forming four walls. Next, add one more piece across the top at aheight of about 4 feet. This will keep the critters out of the corn and preventthe crows from eating the seeds and seedlings when first planted. Then, as thecorn grows, it will grow right through the top of the wire, which will supportthe tall corn stalks when the wind blows—at the same time, keeping the raccoonsand chipmunks out before the corn can be harvested. You can easily tie thehorizontal top wire with temporary bows so that you can undo a few and stillreach in. Since it is chicken wire, make sure you wear a long-sleeved shirt whenyou reach in so you don’t get scratched. You’ll be able to water easily eitherby hand or using a long-handled wand and shut-off valve on the end of your hose.“SFG is great for the family. Each person has his or her own plot.”—Gary from MichiganVERTICAL FRAMES FOR VINE CROPSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]When I first invented the Square Foot Gardening method, I knew one of the realchallenges was going to be some of the big sprawling vine crops like tomatoes.Without a doubt, tomatoes are America’s most-loved garden vegetable. However,they can take up a lot of room and can become unsightly by season’s end if theyare allowed to grow without proper care. Also, if left to sprawl over theground, tomatoes can attract additional pests, and many get damaged or ruinedfrom foot traffic. The whole idea of growing tomatoes this way seemed verynon-productive.I was determined to find a better way to grow tomatoes and what I devised turnedout to be not only good for tomatoes, but for all other vine crops too. Everyplant that has a vine that sprawls all over the ground—even pumpkins andwatermelons—can be grown vertically as long as you have a strong enough support;the result is a spectacular sight with very little wasted ground space.AIR RIGHTSBeing an engineer, I thought of buildings in a city. Buildings aren’tconstructed as one-story structures that sprawl outward over the landscape;space is too valuable to do this. Instead, designers and contractors use what iscalled air rights, building straight up into the air, floor after floor afterfloor. Why can’t plants be grown the same way? Well, I discovered they can! Allyou need is a strong framework and something to hold the vine onto theframework. Did you know that vines grow better vertically than horizontally?Growing plants vertically prevents ground rot and discourages pest infestation.I know slugs aren’t happy about my way of vertical gardening; I hear they getdizzy up high, but that’s their problem!NATURE SUPPORTSThrough the years I experimented with all different types of materials andframes. Finally, I settled upon one that was so simple, easy, and inexpensive touse that it was almost ridiculous. Then I began growing all different types ofplants vertically. I originally thought I would need to design some special wayto hold up and accommodate heavier fruits such as winter squash and pumpkins,but as it turned out, these plant vines seemed to understand the situation; thestem supporting the heavy fruit grows thicker and heavier as the fruit becomeslarger. If you have a framework and support that will hold the plant, the plantwill hold the fruit; it is as simple as that! Mother Nature always seems to knowbest.Image [../images/f0079-01.jpg]BEST MATERIALI use the strongest material I can find, which is steel. Fortunately, steelcomes in tubular pipe used for electrical conduit. It is very strong and turnsout to be very inexpensive. Couplings are also available so you can connect twopieces together. I designed an attractive frame that fits right onto the 4 × 4box, and it can be attached to the wooden box with clamps that can be bought atany store. Or, steel reinforcing rods driven into the existing ground outsideyour box provide a very steady and strong base; then the electrical conduitslips snugly over the bars. It’s very simple and inexpensive to assemble. Anyonecan do it—even you! To prevent vertically grown plants from shading other partsof the garden, I recommend that tall, vertical frames be constructed on thenorth side of the garden. To fit it into a 4 × 4 box, I designed a frame thatmeasured 4 feet wide and almost 6 feet tall.TIE IT TIGHTVertically growing plants need to be tied to their supports. Nylon netting won’trot in the sun and weather, and I use it exclusively now for both verticalframes and horizontal plant supports. It is very strong—almost unbreakable—andguaranteed for twenty years. It is a wonderful material available at gardenstores and in catalogs. The nylon netting is also durable enough to grow theheavier vine crops on vertical frames, including watermelons, pumpkins,cantaloupes, winter and summer squashes, and tomatoes. You will see in Chapter 8[ch08.html#ch08] how easy it is to train plants to grow vertically. To hold theplants to the frame, I have found that nylon netting with 7-inch square openingsmade especially for tomato growing works well because you can reach your handthrough. Make sure it is this type so it won’t cut the stem of the plant when itblows against it in the wind. This comes in 4-foot widths and can easily be tiedto the metal frame. It’s sometimes hard to find, so call around.WINTER STORAGEBecause the netting is loose, it can flop around unless you tie it very tightlyto the frame; this is the first step. At the end of the season the frames can beleft up or they can be slipped off the steel rebar and hung on a garage wall.Although the conduit is galvanized and endures many years of service, iteventually will rust—especially at the bottom where it comes in contact with theground. If you do hang up your metal frames in the winter, for safety reasonsmake sure you cover or clearly mark the steel rebar that is left sticking out ofthe ground. You can flag it with brightly covered tape, paint it, or find capsthat can be screwed on to prevent someone from tripping.COMPOSTERSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]A composting operation can be as simple as a pile of leaves, weeds, and kitchenscraps. Mother Nature does it all the time. Go to any forest or field and you’llsee she gets the job done without any structures. But people are different. Welike to conserve space, keep things in their place; and we usually want to builda container or enclosure for our compost materials, which speeds up theoperation by creating bulk, which then allows the pile to heat up and decomposefaster.What can we buy or build? There are many compost containers on the market mostlymade from plastic. All work well, are attractive, and reasonably priced. Thereare composters that tumble or turn, speeding up the process, but they cost moreand worst of all —you still have to turn them. It’s fun at first but it gets oldvery fast.MAKE YOUR OWNWe need a structure that will hold a pile of material in either a round orsquare shape. Wire fencing works well for round and even square structures ifyou use four fence posts. Make wire cylinders at least 3 to 4 feet in diameter.The exact length of fencing you’ll need isn’t critical. Instead I am just goingto tell everyone to buy 10 or 15 feet of fencing and shape it in a cylinder byattaching the ends together by bending the cut wire ends.Image [../images/f0081-01.jpg]If you don’t have a compost pile yet, start one now. It’s essential to theSquare Foot Gardening method.So, if you want a 3-foot diameter composter, buy 10 feet of fencing. If you wanta 4-foot diameter, buy 15 feet of fencing and have enough for a door. And, ifyou don’t like round composters, buy four 6-foot long steel fence posts, drivethem in each corner of your composter location, bend the wire around those, andyou’ll have a square composter, much more suited to SFG. Find the best locationfor your composter and fill as explained in Chapter 5 [ch05.html#ch05]. Whenfull or ready to turn, just lift up the wire cylinder, place it next to thepile, and use a garden fork to fill the cylinder in its new location—you’ve justturned the pile!WITH A GATEAnother idea is to have an enclosure that’s easier to get into to mix and wateror even turn. Make an entrance opening with or without a gate. Start by drivingtwo steel fence posts in the ground at your selected location; make them about 3or 4 feet apart. Then attach your wire fencing to these posts. Two options areavailable for you—with and without a gate. If you want a gate it will cost youan extra 3 or 4 feet of fencing. No big deal, and it will look nicer and beneater when the enclosure starts filling up. You still tie or wire the fencingto both fence posts; one becomes the hinge, the other the door latch.Make the latch S-hook from wire, or you can buy this type of hook at the store.You can have one compost bin or two together or even three depending on howlarge your operation is.WEEKLY BINSJust like the wire enclosures, you can have one, two, or up to six bins alltogether for Monday through Saturday. (Don’t forget we rest on Sunday!) When andwhy would you need more than one? When you get serious about composting, you maybe able to get enough material to fill up one every week. Then, for mixing (asexplained in Chapter 5 [ch05.html#ch05]), you just move material from a full bininto an empty one right next to it. The nice thing about a series is you onlyneed three pallets for each additional bin.I could include directions for other materials to use like bricks or cementblocks, landscape timbers, or logs, but no one is going to build a composter outof those materials. They would be too expensive and inefficient. They may lookgood in books but not in our system because they are just not practical.Of course, no one says you have to have an enclosure, but if you’re a SquareFoot Gardener and you have nice square boxes for all of your garden, why wouldyou want just a pile for your composter?Image [../images/coin.jpg] PENNY PINCHERSQUARE IS GOODHere’s a no-cost easy way to make your composter out of wood—that means free.Women tell me they love this because it requires no tools, wire cutting,equipment, or familiarity with construction. Find four wood pallets of similarsize and appearance. You can find discarded pallets everywhere. The place tofind them is behind the stores and shops where the dumpsters are. Ask first,just to make sure they are being thrown out. If you can fine four of about thesame size and look, your finished composter will look like it’s custom made justfor you. A brick or stone under each corner helps keep the wood off the groundto keep it from rotting; corners are tied with rope, cord, or chain. It doesn’thave to be nailed or screwed together, and it doesn’t have to be real tight. Youmay want to have the pallet boards face outside to look nice, and you can makethem all run either horizontally or vertically—whatever looks best.AISLESImage [../images/dotline.jpg]“Put your best foot forward” is the saying, but what are you going to put it on?Grass, brick, boards, gravel, or just plain dirt? Most people put their SquareFoot boxes in their yard and leave the grass for their aisles. This helps keep anatural look. And don’t worry, the grass won’t get a lot of hard use becausethere’s not that much to do in a Square Foot Garden. If you want to leavenatural soil in your aisles use an action hoe once a week to rid your aisle ofpesky weeds.BRICK PATHSIn my PBS TV garden, we had a small 15 × 15 area with several boxes and plaindirt aisles. I spent five minutes every week running an action hoe over the soilto cut off any new weeds, and it looked pretty nice. But then in one of theclasses I was giving, some of the ladies wanted to know how to lay brick so Ithought this would be fun to teach as well as improving the garden. So withoutmoving the boxes, we laid down many layers of newspaper. Next we added a 1-inchlayer of sand and then started laying bricks right on that sand base. No mortaror cement is needed—just fill in the tight joints with loose sand. When we gotto the existing 4 × 4 garden boxes, we just went right around them. It went welland in one afternoon it was all done. What an improvement—wow! We added somepatio furniture, and this area became a favorite spot to sit and enjoy the yardand gardens. We also began to notice more of a different kind of visitor to thegarden—the birds and bees and butterflies and so many more insects. And all forthe price of a few bricks (well, a small truckload actually) and a little sand.Image [../images/f0083-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0084-01.jpg]Go to the nursery department of your local home improvement center and browsethrough it to find the ground cover material you prefer.Image [../images/f0084-02.jpg]ONE LAST IDEAHow would you like to carpet your garden . . . wall to wall? Well, you can. Buynew or used indoor/outdoor patio carpeting. It even comes in a grass style but,don’t worry, you won’t have to mow it!Image [../images/coin.jpg] PENNY PINCHERKill Weeds for FreeSome gardeners use indoor or outdoor carpeting either face up, or if you don’tlike the color or texture, face down. This is a good way to smother and killgrass or weeds in the aisles without any digging. However, once it rains, indoorcarpet gets soggy and smelly, so out it goes.Where do you get old carpet? Go to your local carpet store; they have tons of itout by the dumpster. Don’t ask them to deliver it though. If it’s new stuff youare going to buy, they may deliver that free once you buy it. They’ll even cutit for you to the width of your aisles.LET’S REVIEWWhen building a SFG, start with the basic building block—a 4 × 4 bottomless woodbox. Then, depending on the situation, add special features to solve anygardening problem or to protect your garden from any hazard. Some of the simpleadditions you can add to your SFG boxes:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] A wire bottom to keep out moles, voles, andgophersImage [../images/square-r.jpg] A weed cloth bottom to keep out weeds or grassImage [../images/square-r.jpg] A chicken wire top to keep out cats, dogs, andrabbitsImage [../images/square-r.jpg] A PVC top frame then:Image [../images/square-g.jpg] Clear plastic to create a miniature greenhouseImage [../images/square-g.jpg] Bird or deer nettingImage [../images/square-g.jpg] A blanket to protect plants from frostsImage [../images/square-g.jpg] Floating covers to protect from insectsImage [../images/square-r.jpg] The possibilities are endless for everyone, fromapartment dwellers to the elderly, and even people with special needs.After all this talk about building all these different things for protectingyour garden, I don’t want you to become worried, thinking that you have to spenda lot of time creating complex structures for your SFG. It’s not so! We’ve justlearned how easy it is to adjust a SFG to improve its flexibility and toaccommodate unique gardening situations. This is readily done since a SFG is sosmall and manageable. For the most part, your plants will just sit there quietlygrowing, looking better and better every day. So relax and enjoy!FAMILYImage [../images/dotline.jpg]But remember, protecting your garden is a lot like protecting your children—ifit’s cold, add a blanket (a sweater); if sleet and hail are predicted, add clearplastic (a raincoat); and if it’s windy, add an extra shield against the wind (awindbreaker). Since you wouldn’t let your kids play out in the cold winterwithout a snowsuit for protection, do the same for your plants. Keeping this inmind, you’ll be able to come up with easy and practical solutions for protectingyour garden from the worst of conditions. That makes it very rewarding becausethen you can enjoy your garden much longer every year.Image [../images/f0086-01.jpg]This simple PVC frame can protect your plants from many things including harmfulweather and unwanted nibblers.

Get it? It is the reason all the other improvements arepossible. So, please, pay attention, study, and learn everything in this chapterso you can make your Mel’s Mix the best you can. This will allow you toautomatically have all the other benefits and improvements that come sonaturally to (the all new) SFG.DON’T SKIMP ON THISNow, with All New Square Foot Gardening you’ll never have to do all the hardwork, expense, and time-consuming, back-breaking labor of improving your gardensoil every spring like we used to do. Your Mel’s Mix is ready to go whenever youare. It never has to be replaced and you don’t have to do a thing except plantyour seeds.Mel’s Mix may be the most costly part of SFG, yet at the same time it is themost cost effective. How can it be both? The answer: if you try to skimp on thisitem, you’ll be disappointed in all the rest. But, if you do it right, all theother advantages of SFG will fall into place and you will be the richestgardener on the block. Sorry to be so adamant, but this is really what makes SFGso different and successful. We have never had a failure of SFG except whensomeone decided to skimp on the ingredients to save a few bucks.Let’s review what this perfect soil will do for your garden, then the why andhow so you fully understand the nature of the mix.We’ll go through each of the three ingredients indicated—compost, peat moss, andvermiculite—and what each one is, why you need it, and where to obtain it all.Then I’ll discuss how to mix, moisten, and place it in your boxes. If you do itright, you’ll have the most enjoyable gardening experience of your life. Thatwonderful feeling will be repeated every time you plant and replant every singlesquare foot. Your hand will just slip through the loose, easily worked,earthy-smelling soil, and you will sigh with happiness and smile every time. Itis truly an emotional experience that very few gardeners have ever encountered.But enough talk and teasing—let’s get started!Image [../images/f0088-01.jpg]NO MOREThis is a partial list of just some of the knowledge you had to learn aboutbackyard soils in the past. But not now! Forget about every one of them. Why?Because Square Foot Gardening is now so simple you don’t have to learn all theintricate details of soil structure, texture, and drainage. You don’t even haveto know what pH means, how to pronounce it, or which letter is a capital andwhich is lower case (or why people are always getting that mixed up). Why, youmay ask? Because I’ve designed our perfect soil mix with the correct pH level(acid or alkaline) for just about all plants.For those of you who crave more information, a good, blended, balancedcompost—one of the ingredients in Mel’s Mix and what you will add to your boxesafter each harvest—made from at least five different ingredients will not onlyhave a pH close to neutral, but it also balances the acidity in peat moss. Inaddition, since we don’t use your existing soil (remember we only need 6 inchesof pure Mel’s Mix), you won’t be concerned with what type of soil it is or whatthe pH is. You won’t have to buy a pH soil test kit or take samples to yourcounty extension agent. You won’t have to learn that eastern U.S.A. soils areslightly acidic while western soils are more alkaline, and you won’t have tolearn what to add, how much, and when. You won’t have to buy a spreader or anyof that stuff.NO FERTILIZER, NO MESSMel’s Mix has all the nutrients, minerals, and trace elements that plants need.So forget all about fertilizer. Isn’t that amazing? Not only do you not have tobuy it, you don’t even have to learn about it. SFG is an all-organic,all-natural method.Come spring you’ll find there is no work to do; there is no going to the store,reading labels, lugging big bags or bales of soil additives home, no spreadingthem out, working in lime, getting a rototiller running and working—then tryingto turn over that wet, mucky soil, getting it all over your shoes and tools—oh,what a mess that was. But that is all a thing of the past. Why, you don’t evenhave to do the soilball test in the palm of your hand only to find out you haveto wait another week because your soil is too wet or still frozen. (What’s thesoilball test, you ask? I’m not going to tell you because you don’t need to knowit any longer.)Your Mel’s Mix is always ready to plant no matter what the weather. It’s alwaysloose, friable (which the experts define as that which is easily worked—good andcrumbly), and ready for the right time of year to plant. It drains and becomesunfrozen so much quicker than regular garden soil.Image [../images/f0089-01.jpg]WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?Image [../images/dotline.jpg]Planting a garden will no longer depend on when the soil is ready but only onthe right date to plant seeds and transplants. This is just one moresimplification of gardening the Square Foot way. How does that all sound? Simpleand easy—no work, no muss, no fuss. I have had people ask me, “Why weren’t youborn one hundred years ago so I could have started with Square Foot Gardeninginstead of having to do all the work of single-row gardening all my life?” Goodquestion!NO DIGGINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Using Mel’s Mix completely eliminates all the hard work of digging and movingexisting soil. A 4 × 4 × 12-inch-deep area contains 16 cubic feet of soil thatweighs well over 400 pounds. That’s a lot of soil to dig up and move around. Allgardening in the past has been based upon improving your existing soil. Myoriginal book had rather complicated instructions for your soil, but we’vechanged all that. Don’t even be concerned about it. You don’t have to knowanything about soils. Just start with a perfect growing soil—Mel’s Mix of 1/3compost, 1/3 peat moss, and 1/3 vermiculite measured by volume.LIKE A SPONGEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Through many experiments, I came up with the very best ingredients for thatperfect growing soil. Of course, I made sure they were all inexpensive, readilyavailable, and able to hold just the right amount of moisture for plants whilenot becoming too soggy for roots, which might drown your plants. I created aformula that holds moisture yet drains well.At first this seemed like an impossible task, but then I thought about sponges.When you take a dry sponge and slowly add water to it, it just keeps soaking upwater until it’s finally saturated. At that point, any extra water just drainsout the bottom. Well, it turns out that two of our ingredients—peat moss andvermiculite—do exactly that same thing. It takes a while to wet them and keepthem moist so you have to keep adding water, but finally, when they becomesaturated, any excess water just drains right out the bottom. Peat moss andvermiculite are sold at garden nurseries, home improvement centers, and evensome grocery stores.Image [../images/f0090-01.jpg]Three ingredients make up Mel’s Mix: Peat moss, vermiculite, and blendedcompost. Combined properly, Mel’s Mix retains moisture, drains perfectly, andhas all the nutrients and trace minerals a plant could ever want.Image [../images/f0091-01.jpg]An assortment of composts is shown here. You’ll need at least 5 different typesof compost for Mel’s Mix. Pay no attention to weight; go by the volume, even ifyou have to estimate it.Image [../images/f0091-02.jpg]Buying peat moss in 3.9 cubic foot bales is the most cost-efficient. The smallerbags of loose peat moss are more expensive.Image [../images/f0091-03.jpg]The same goes for vermiculite; ask for the large 4.0 cubic foot size. Don’tsettle for the small bags measured by quarts.Image [../images/f0091-04.jpg]Make a neat cut in the top of your bags. This way, when you’ve finished makingyour own Mel’s Mix, you can reuse the bags to store any leftover mix.Important Note: If volume is not marked on the bags, compare them to similarlysized bags where volume is marked to estimate.MATH 101Image [../images/dotline.jpg]The biggest problem turns out to be arithmetic, not the materials. All threeingredients in Mel’s Mix are sold in different-sized bags or bales, and this maymake it harder to figure out how much of each you need. But, don’t worry, I’mgoing to give you some examples so you won’t even have to think about the math.Image [../images/1-red.jpg] COMPOSTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Let’s take a minute to describe compost. It is one-third of the Mel’s Mix, andit is also what you add to your All New Square Foot Garden after you harvesteach square foot. So what is it, how do you make it, and why bother?Compost is absolutely the best material in which to grow your plants. Goodcompost has all the nutrients needed for plant growth. It’s loose and friableand easily worked. It holds lots of moisture yet drains well. It’s easy to makeyet hard to find. The best kind is homemade compost that you make in your ownbackyard. The worst kind is the single ingredient byproduct some company hasproduced and bagged.“My square foot garden has been the most productive, lowest maintenance gardenI’ve ever had.”—Pat from UtahGOOD AND BADSo, let’s simplify garden composting and garden compost.First off, it’s a very confusing subject because the word “compost” is both anoun and a verb. As a noun, compost is described as a rich, crumbly, soil-likematerial used in gardening. As a verb, it is the process of breaking down plantmaterial that is no longer growing through a decomposition process.To complicate the understanding of the garden-related, breaking-down process(compost as a verb), there are actually two types of processes—aerobic, withair; and anaerobic, without air. Both are a natural, Mother Earth process. Butthe first, or aerobic, has no odor, heats up, and does its job with littlemicrobes wearing white hats (the good guys). The second, or anaerobic process,smells, is messy, and is very objectionable. The more common name for this isrotting. I don’t have to tell you that all these microbe bugs wear black hats(the bad guys). It’s true all those bad-guy, black-hat items will eventuallydecompose, but you don’t want to be around while they do.WHAT TO USEAny plant material is perfect for adding to your compost pile as long as it’snot hosting a plant disease or pest. When the ingredients are all piled togetherand if they have enough bulk, they will decompose organically by the aerobicprocess all by themselves. But it takes time; Mother Nature can’t be hurried.Some people say, “I can’t wait for a year or two. How can I speed this process?”The answer—mix, mash, moisten, and move.Image [../images/f0093-01.jpg]NEEDS MASSUsing the right ingredients and mixing, mashing, moistening, and moving themwill help speed the composting. But there is one more ideal condition, and thatis mass. The more bulk you have in your pile (up to a certain point), the fasterit will compost or decompose. If your pile is taller than 4 feet, you’ll have ahard time adding new ingredients. If the area is larger than 4 × 4, the air willhave trouble getting into the center where all the action is and the white-hat,good-guy microbes will turn into the black-hat, bad-guy microbes and the pilewill start to decompose anaerobically (without air) and start to smell. If youdon’t have enough bulk—smaller than 3 × 3, your pile will just sit there and donothing except cry out, “I’m going to wait for Mother Nature.”We keep calling it a pile, and you may wonder if it will be ugly and messy. Butthe pile can be contained very nicely with a homemade or store-bought containercalled a composter. (Oh no! Another name!) So now, I’m going to be composting mycompost in my composter. You’ve got it! See, that wasn’t so bad.STILL CONFUSED?Way back when I wrote my first book on SFG, I had no idea people would be soconfused about composting until I realized that only 10 percent of gardenersactually compost, another 10 percent don’t ever want to compost, and the middle80 percent say they would like to but are confused and scared by the process. Ofcourse, much of that confusion is from not knowing how to compost aerobically.Let’s summarize.Image [../images/f0094-01.jpg]COMPOST INGREDIENTSWhat you need to remember about the ingredients is that animal byproducts arenot good for your compost. Eggshells are okay; just crush and sprinkle around.Manure is okay from plant-eating animals, but no manure from meat-eatinganimals.TURN THE HANDLES OR CHOP, CHOP, CHOPImage [../images/dotline.jpg]If you are in a real hurry, there are expensive, but effective, rotating drumcomposters you can buy. You just turn a handle, flip a container, or push abarrel around, and the contents are mixed and moved. Great idea, and they workif you do it regularly.I’ve also heard of, but never tried, the closed,black-plastic-bag-of-ingredients-left-in-the-garage-over-the-winter method. Becareful when you open the bag because, as you can guess, that method uses theblack-hat, no air, anaerobic process that smells.Some gardeners have tried using plastic or molded garbage cans or even largertrash containers. You have to drill or poke holes in them so the air can get in,but if the lid is tight-fitting, you could roll it around every day.On my PBS TV program, I showed how to make a rolling composter out of an old,cleaned oil drum. You could push it with your foot to roll it around. It wasgreat.I’ve found from my own experimenting that, no matter what method you use, thesooner you mix and move and the more you mash (cut or chop), the sooner andfaster you’ll start the composting action going. Just add compost ingredients bymixing it in with the top of the existing pile. Each time you add a lot or justa little, stir it into the top of the pile and mix it in well. But, don’t justadd it in layers.PRACTICAL COMPOSTING TIPSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]MOW THOSE LEAVESSave some of your leaves from fall to add to the compost pile next year ratherthan all at once. After you rake them up, run the lawnmower over them to chopthem up and then stuff into plastic bags (make sure they are dry) or, if you area “neatnik,” store them in gray garbage bins stored along the wall of yourcompost operation.DRY THAT GRASSOthers like to save their grass clippings the same way, but you have to be verycareful. If piled up, fresh green grass will quickly turn into a black-hat,anaerobic operation that’s a stinking, slimy, gooey mess. Grass clippings haveto be dried before adding them to the pile or stored for later addition. It doesseem like an oxymoron to dry the grass clippings only to moisten them in thecompost pile, but now I’m sure you can see why we do it that way.DETAILED LIST OF INGREDIENTSImage [../images/f0096-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0096-01a.jpg]Image [../images/f0096-01b.jpg]I compare it to my mother’s meatloaf. She would dry bread and then crumble it tomake bread crumbs. She would then add milk to moisten everything. If she hadjust added moist, fresh bread, it would have gotten clumpy and gooey. Thecompost is similar. If material is put in wet, it packs down in clumpspreventing air from entering the pile, and then it rots and smells.So spread your grass clippings out on a tarp or the driveway, turn them a fewtimes with a rake or flip your tarp before storing them or adding them to yourcompost pile. How long? Until the grass is brownish and dry to the touch. Itdepends on the sun, humidity, and rain, as well as the climate of your location.MIX AND TURNThis is a good time to remind you that the center of the pile is where most ofthe action is. It will be the hottest (up to 150° F or 65° C), the moistest, andwith the most white-hats running around decomposing the ingredients. Knowing allthat when you turn the contents of one compost bin into another, you will beputting the top of A into the bottom of B—assuming you have two bins or pilesside-by-side—then you make sure you put the outside material of A into theinside of B. Get it? It’s just like the theory that opposites attract. Mix in(at the same time) opposite colors, wetness, size—everything opposite for thefastest operation. In other words, brown with green, wet with dry, coarse withfine. That’s all easy to remember—just think of opposites attracting and you’llhave a great operation.IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY COMPOSTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Don’t buy all of one kind of compost if you decide to not make it yourself.Don’t let the clerk sell you the “best and most popular,” especially if it’sloose and not bagged. Here’s why. All commercial compost is a byproduct from oneindustry. It might be the wood, cattle, mushroom, cannery, cotton, or soybeanindustry that has a waste product and they have to get rid of it. They said,“What if we take our waste product (sawdust, manure, vines, pulp, or husks) andcompost it, people will pay us and take it away.” Everyone laughed but, bygolly, it happened just that way. Now every industry with a waste product isfinding ways to get rid of it at a profit all the while protecting theenvironment. What a good deal. The only setback for gardeners is most bags ofcompost come from a single product and have only one ingredient.What’s the solution? Buy a variety of composts and mix them together. Now, youare more likely to get a better mixture.Image [../images/coin.jpg] PENNY PINCHERYour home operation should include every different thing you can think of. Go tothe grocery store and ask for the produce manager. Many stores throw out tons ofspoiled vegetables and fruits they can’t sell. These are from all over theworld, so just think of the different soils and climates all that has grown inand what different vitamins, minerals, and trace elements they contain. Ifthey’re not diseased, chop them up and mix them in the compost pile.GO BIG TIMEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]If you are really into this, you can brainstorm to think of places that throwout organic or plant material. Like a bird shop and all those bird droppingsthat go on the bottom of the cage. And, how about the annual fire departmentcommunity breakfast—fresh fruit, banana and orange peels maybe, but also howabout eggshells? Just ask ahead—take boxes or bags and ask them to separate thetrash. Or, how about the annual 4th of July watermelon picnic in town? There areall kinds of places where you can collect ingredients for your compost pile.And, you know, the nice thing is that you’ll find the same situation the worldover.When I’m visiting foreign countries, my hosts say, “We are poor here, and wehave nothing to compost.” I take them on a tour and find all of these placeshave things that could be composted. It’s always things people are throwing out.I’ve done that in India, Haiti, Argentina, Nepal, Thailand, Ghana, and even inLondon, Paris, Amsterdam, and New York City, so don’t be afraid to go, look, andask—it’s out there.Image [../images/coin.jpg] PENNY PINCHERCOFFEE GROUNDS AND FREE BUCKETSAnyplace people gather, there will be waste thrown out. Check out farmer’smarkets, local fairs or street carnivals, flea markets, even places likeStarbucks (guess what they would have for you there?). In addition to compostmaterial, many of these restaurant-type places have big buckets used forpickles, mayonnaise, or oil that make great water buckets—all free for theasking.Image [../images/2-red.jpg] PEAT MOSSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The second ingredient in Mel’s Mix is peat moss. It’s a natural materialoccurring on the earth that has been made after millions of years fromdecomposing plant material. You can usually determine how old peat moss is bymeasuring how deeply it’s buried. It is commonly used in agriculture to improveexisting soils because it makes them lighter, more friable, and water retentive.There are plenty of debates about the use of peat moss because it’s anonrenewable resource. Because there is a limit to this valuable material I’dlike to guide you in using it responsibly while maximizing its benefits.ONLY A LITTLEThe new SFG method uses only 20 percent of the space of traditional single-rowgardens. Therefore, you automatically use only 20 percent—one-fifth—as much peatmoss, an 80 percent reduction. In addition, with Square Foot Gardening, you addpeat moss once and only once when you first create your Mel’s Mix. Thereafter,you’ll never need to add peat moss to the garden. (What you will add is compost,which is renewable.)In the United States, most peat moss comes from the northern states and Canadawhere it is still readily available. Because it’s such a valuable resource, SFGsays let’s not waste it. Instead let’s get rid of all single-row gardens thatrequire five times as much nonrenewable materials to improve the soil year afteryear. Let’s be conservative and sensible and use what we have, a beneficial,natural material, but make it longer lasting.Image [../images/3-red.jpg] VERMICULITEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Vermiculite, the third and final ingredient in Mel’s Mix, is also a naturalmaterial and is obtainable all over the world. It’s mica rock mined out of theground. Once the rock is collected, it is then ground up into small particlesand heated until it explodes just like popcorn, forming small pieces from aslarge as the tip of your little finger down to almost a powder. However, thismaterial is filled with nooks and crannies, just like an English muffin. Thesenooks and crannies hold a tremendous amount of water and yet can breathe, makingthe soil extremely friable and loose. The moisture is always there for the rootsto absorb. Remember that roots don’t grow through soil; they grow around soilparticles. That’s why plants do better in a loose, friable soil because theroots have an easy time growing.CERTIFIEDVermiculite is graded into several sizes—fine, medium, and coarse—and is alsotested and qualified for different types of uses. The coarse agricultural gradeholds the most moisture while at the same time giving the most friability to thesoil mix. You may find that some stores do not carry vermiculite. If you askthem why, you might hear a story that started many years ago when one mine inMontana was shut down because part of the mine was found to contain asbestos.Now, shutting down a mine because it contains asbestos makes sense.However, some newspaper stories associated the problem with all of the productscoming from the mine. Although the mine was shut down and the industry hasproduced a great deal of evidence that the contamination was not in thevermiculite, the story surfaces every few years as if it was new, therebygetting everyone upset all over again. It was a serious situation, but as aresult, the good news is that all the vermiculite mines around the world andproducts sold are now meticulously inspected by everyone; the bags we buy noweven come with a “Certified Asbestos Free” sticker.Locating it can be difficult. Let your fingers do the walking and call around.Call all the major nurseries, garden supply centers, and major home improvementstores and try to get the garden manager on the phone and ask them if they carrythe large 4-cubic-foot bags of coarse vermiculite because you’re building aSquare Foot Garden. If that fails, look under “greenhouse supplies or suppliers”in the yellow pages for wholesale distributors. Some people have found it atfarm feed stores or even on the Internet.There is one caution when you mix it, and it is the same caution with peat moss.Both materials are dusty when dry right out of the bag so wear gloves and apainting mask. Mix only outdoors on a calm day.PERLITE INSTEAD OF VERMICULITE?Perlite is another natural material mined out of the earth and used inagriculture for the same purpose as vermiculite—to break up and loosen poorsoils and to retain moisture. I personally don’t like or use perlite, and here’swhy. It is hard as a rock, rather coarse and gritty, and I don’t like the feelof it in the soil mix. It doesn’t hold moisture like vermiculite. In addition,it floats to the top of the soil mix as you water your garden and because it’swhite, it looks rather unsightly and unnatural. And it makes me sneeze! Manypeople do use perlite instead of vermiculite and, in fact, most of thecommercial mixes are made with perlite because it’s cheaper. It’s a matter ofpreference and availability, but I know which one I’m buying.BUYING WHAT YOU NEEDImage [../images/dotline.jpg]If you found the math about area difficult in previous chapters, don’t evenbother with volume. Get the kids to do the math for you.Why concern yourself with volume? Because you need to know the quantity of thethree ingredients for Mel’s Mix necessary to fill your boxes, and the packagesfor the different ingredients come in different sizes. But the good news is theyusually use cubic feet as their measurement. If not, disregard weight andestimate by volume.So, let’s review how to figure volume. Volume is merely: area × depth=cubicfeet. In other words, square feet (the area) times the depth equals cubic feet.Our 4 × 4-foot box is 16 square feet in area (that’s 4 feet times 4 feet). If itwere 1 foot deep, the volume would be: 16 (the area) times 1 (the depth) equals16 cubic feet. But it’s not 1 foot deep, it’s only 6 inches deep so we need onlyone-half or just 8 cubic feet for our 4 × 4 box. The math looks like this: 4times 4 divided by one-half foot equals 8. Or to show it mathematically, (4 ×4)/2 = 8. (Now don’t laugh, kids, some of the parents will be thankful for thiskind of help).PEAT MOSS (COMPRESSED BALE)Full bale: 3.9 cubic feet compressed = 8 cubic feet looseHalf bale: 2.2 cubic feet compressed = 4 cubic feet loose(These measurements aren’t exact, but we’re not mixing a cake here.)VERMICULITE (COARSE)Don’t buy the small 4-quart sized or similar bag—insist on the 4-cubic-feet bigbag. Call ahead to locate.Image [../images/f0100-02.jpg]MEL’S MIX VOLUMEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Now here’s the tricky part. Since all the products for Mel’s Mix come indifferent volumes, you’ll have to purchase them already knowing how much you’llneed to mix correctly and fill your boxes completely. Let’s use a hypotheticalexample. If we had 4 × 4 boxes, they would each have a volume of 8 cubic feet,as we determined already. So, if we had six boxes to fill, we would need 6 × 8 =48 cubic feet of mix. (Six boxes times 8 cubic feet for each box equals 48 cubicfeet of mix.) One-third of the total for each ingredient = 48/3 = 16 cubic feetof each. (A total of 48 cubic feet divided by three different ingredients equals16 cubic feet of each ingredient.)SHOPPING LISTImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Peat Moss: 16/8 = two full balesImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Vermiculite: 16/4 = four big bagsImage [../images/square-r.jpg] Compost: Whatever it takes to get 16 cubic feetof five different kinds. Forget weight, measure by volume.MORE SHOPPING LISTS FOR DIFFERENT SIZED BATCHESIf you had three 4 × 4 boxes (24 cubic feet total), you would need:Image [../images/square-r.jpg] two 4-cubic-foot bags of coarse vermiculite toequal 8 cubic feet.Image [../images/square-r.jpg] one 3.9-cubic-foot bale of peat moss (expands to8 cubic feet).Image [../images/square-r.jpg] and 8 cubic feet from at least five differentcomposts bags. If the bags are sold by weight only, estimate volume by comparingto similar sized bags that note volume.If you had one 4 × 4 box and one 2 × 4 or one 3 × 3 box (12 cubic feet), and youwanted to mix up half of a batch to start with, you would add together just one4-cubic-foot bag of vermiculite, half of a 3.9-cubic-foot bale of peat moss (orif you can find the 2.2-cubic-foot bales that expand to equal about 4 cubic feetloose), and two of the 2-cubic-foot bags of compost. If the compost comes inother sized bags, you may have to do a little arithmetic. That’s enough Mel’sMix to fill one 4 × 4 box that needs 8 cubic feet plus one 2 × 4 box that needsfour cubic feet, or one 3 × 3 box that needs 4 1/2 cubic feet.“Your book, website and method are just fantastic.”—Annie from New JerseyHOW TO MIXImage [../images/dotline.jpg]This is where making your Mel’s Mix and filling your boxes starts to get fun.Mix it all at once if possible (storing any excess in recycled bags). But ifit’s too big a batch to handle, split it into smaller batches.Here’s a suggestion: Use a pair of scissors to cut open your bags carefullyalong the top so you can reuse them. At the same time explain to the kids theenvironmental three R’s—reduce, reuse, and recycle. Our Square Foot Gardeningsystem is a great example of:1. reduce, by 80 percent,2. reuse, save the bags, and3. recycle plants in your compost.Get a large tarp, at least 16 × 16-feet, and open it near your garden where youhave all your boxes built and located. Make sure you have them in their finalresting place—check with the boss one more time and ask, “Are you sure this iswhere you want all the boxes, dear?”All of the three ingredients are dusty when dry, so do this when there is nowind. Don’t do it in the garage, or you’ll get dust all over your nice new caror workshop. Wear a painter’s mask and have a hose ready with a very fine spray.Don’t forget to have a few mixing tools ready like a snow shovel, a hoe, or asteel rake.Count out the bags and boxes, do the math one more time and start opening thebags and pouring the contents out on the tarp without walking on theingredients. Roughly mix the three ingredients as best you can as you pour it.Image [../images/f0102-01.jpg]Empty the 5 bags of different kinds of compost in the center of a large tarp.Then drag two corners of the tarp to the opposite two corners. You’ll see thematerial roll over, mixing itself. When you’ve pulled the tarp so that themixture is almost to the edge, move 90 degrees and pull those two corners over.You just work your way around the tarp and repeat pulling corners together untilyour Mel’s Mix is uniformly mixed. It’s finished when you don’t see any singlematerial or one color.Image [../images/f0103-01.jpg]You should have a fairly large pile of blended compost.Image [../images/f0103-02.jpg]To mix, take two corners of the tarp and drag the tarp over itself until thepile rolls to the edge of the tarp. It helps to have two people do this.Image [../images/f0104-01.jpg]Once the compost is well mixed, add your vermiculite.Image [../images/f0104-02.jpg]Next, add the peat moss.Image [../images/f0104-03.jpg]These ingredients can be dusty, so water them lightly before mixing. You mayalso want to wear a protective mask.Use the hose with a fine mist or spray to wet down any dust, but don’t spray somuch you make puddles or wet the ingredients so the mixture becomes too heavy tomove easily. Don’t let the kids play in the mixture, or they will crush thelarge particles of vermiculite. (By the way, I’d save a small plastic bag ofvermiculite for seed starting. We’ll get to seed starting in the next chapter.)The next step is to fill the boxes, wetting down the mixed-in layers only as youfill it. Once the box is full and the top leveled off, don’t pack it down. Itwill settle just right by itself.If you have any leftover Mel’s Mix, put it back in the empty bags you set asidefor reuse. That extra Mel’s Mix will come in handy to fill four-packs and usefor transplants as well as extra to top off the boxes when the soil levelsettles. Turn the bags inside out if you want a plain look, label with a marker,and put them aside. Since you don’t really water the mix until it’s in the box,your stored mix will be fairly dry and lightweight to carry.To fill other boxes, work with someone else to drag the tarp close to the newboxes. Don’t try to carry shovelfuls of mix to the box as it will spill and bewasted. This is precious stuff. (Remember what Grandma always said, “Waste not,want not.”)That’s also why we don’t water the Mel’s Mix in the tarp, but as you are addingit to the box—that way the remaining material in the tarp doesn’t get so heavythat it is hard to drag. As soon as you add your grid to each box, you are readyto plant.You have now completed the most important and rewarding step in SFG. If youfollowed the formula correctly, and didn’t add any of your existing soil, itwill stay loose and friable as long as you live and you will be so excited andhappy. You may have to keep one square just for show; visitors to your gardenwill watch as you say, “Just look at this soil as you run your hands throughit.” Many of you will then add, “Here, you try it. Just feel this soil.” (Butdon’t become a pest.)Image [../images/f0105-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0106-01.jpg]The finished Mel’s Mix should look similar to this photo.AN AFTERTHOUGHTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]I want to make doubly sure you got the message of this chapter, so I’d like tosummarize the critical facts about compost. You need blended compost made fromat least five different ingredients. Mix several different types of composttogether if you buy your compost. Most commercial composts have only one or twoingredients because they are merely leftover waste materials or byproducts froman industrial or commercial operation. By themselves, they do not make a goodingredient in Mel’s Mix.However, the good news is, if you can find at least five of these individualcomposted materials you can mix them together to make a well-rounded blendedcompost ingredient for your Mel’s Mix.And if you did your job and got a blended compost made from at least five majoringredients, you will be blessed with the most wonderful garden you could everimagine. And no more work ever."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0107-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0107-01.jpg]With your grid in place, it’s easy to have a stunning garden by planting adifferent crop in every square.Now we’re getting to the interesting and fun part of Square Foot Gardening.You’ve learned all of the basics. You’ve picked the size, shape, and location ofyour garden. You’ve built the frames, put in the Mel’s Mix, and added the grids.Now it’s time to plant. This chapter is going to instruct you on your plantchoices, how to put your seeds in the garden with the proper spacing (it’s aseasy as Zip-Zap, Bing-Bing-Bing—you’ll see), and growing your own transplantsfor the quickest, most dependable growth.VISUALIZE THE HARVESTIn SFG, begin by visualizing what you want to harvest. This simple step preventsyou from planting too much. Picture a large plant like a head of cabbage. Thatsingle cabbage will take up a whole square foot so you can only plant one persquare foot. It’s the same with broccoli and cauliflower. Let’s go to theopposite end of the spectrum and think of the small plants like radishes.Sixteen can fit into a single square foot. It’s the same for onions andcarrots—sixteen per square foot. (Yet that’s a 3-inch spacing between plants,which is exactly the same spacing the seed packet recommends as it says “thin to3 inches apart.”)SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRA LARGEThink of these plants as if they were shirt sizes. Shirts come in all foursizes: small, medium, large, and extra large, and so do our plants. It’s thatsimple.The extra large, of course, are those that take up the entire square foot—plantslike cabbages, peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, and geraniums. Next are the largeplants—those that can be planted four to a square foot, which equals 6 inchesapart. Large plants include leaf lettuce, dwarf marigolds, Swiss chard, andparsley.Several crops could be 1 per square foot if you let it grow to its full size orit can be planted 4 per square feet if you harvest the outer leaves throughoutthe season. This category includes parsley, basil, and even the larger heads ofleaf lettuce and Swiss chard. Using the SFG method, you snip and constantlyharvest the outer leaves of edible greens, so they don’t take up as much spaceas in a conventional garden.Medium plants come next. They fit nine to every square foot, which equals 4inches apart. Medium plants include bush beans, beets, and large turnips.Image [../images/f0108-01.jpg]For extra large plants, locate seeds or plants right in the middle of yoursquare.PLANT SPACINGImage [../images/f0109-01.jpg]To help keep up with this, you may want to copy this chart so you always have ithandy. Some people even have it laminated so they can take it outdoors withoutworrying about the weather destroying it.Another way to get the proper spacing and number per square foot is to be alittle more scientific and do a little arithmetic as shown below.You can see that one, four, nine, or sixteen plants should be spaced anequivalent number of inches apart. This is the same distance the seed packetwill say “thin to.” Of course we don’t have to “thin to” because we don’t planta whole packet of seeds anymore. So if you’re planting seeds, or even putting intransplants that you purchased or grew from seed, just find the seed packet orplanting directions to see what the distance is for thinning. This distance thendetermines whether you’re going to plant one, four, nine, or sixteen plants.Image [../images/f0110-01.jpg]KID’S CORNERZIP, ZAP, BING, BING, BINGFor nine per square foot, take two fingers, spread them apart, and draw twolines horizontally (zip, zap), which divides the square into thirds, and thentwo vertically, so that you’ve got nine sections. Folks from Texas like to usethe “hook-em-horn” sign using the trigger finger and little pinky finger.Image [../images/f0110-02.jpg]For those with smaller hands (kids love doing this), use your thumb and thetrigger finger, or take one finger and draw two lines separately going each way.Poke nine holes (bing, bing, bing) in the middle of your drawn squares andyou’re ready to plant your seeds.It’s even more fun marking the sixteen plantings per square foot. Remember,there is no measuring. Divide the square in half each way (eyeball it) bydrawing lines in the soil with your finger, the same zip zap (one vertical lineand one horizontal line, each dividing the square in half) as described for fourper square foot. Then, take two fingers, your trigger and middle fingers, andpunch holes in the soil. They should be spaced about the same distance your eyesare spaced apart. Without poking yourself in the eye, hold your fingers up toyour face so the fingers are spaced just about right, and then, mark your soil.In each of the four squares, go bing, bing, with your fingers, marking two holeseach time so there are four holes in each small square.Image [../images/f0110-03.jpg]Image [../images/f0111-01.jpg]For crops that can fit four to a square foot, divide the square into foursections and poke a hole in the middle of each section.Image [../images/f0111-02.jpg]Plant seeds—just a pinch of two or three seeds depending on size—into the holesyou poked into the squares.Just because we’re talking about measuring in inches doesn’t mean you have toget out your ruler or yardstick, and you don’t have to do any complicatedmeasuring or figuring either. This is when the grid becomes handy. When yoursquare foot is bordered by a grid, it’s much easier to think one, four, nine, orsixteen plants in each square foot.All you do is draw lines in the soil with your fingers! For one plant per squarefoot just poke a hole in the middle of the square with your finger. For four persquare foot, draw a vertical and horizontal line dividing the square in halfeach way. The plants go right in the center of these four smaller squares.HOW MUCH TO PLANTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]I recommend, especially at the beginning, that you plant only what you want toeat. Occasionally try something new, of course, but especially at first onlygrow those vegetables and herbs that you normally eat.Remember, plant each adjoining square foot with a different crop. Why? Here areseveral reasons:1. It prevents you from overplanting any one particular item.2. It allows you to stagger your harvest by planting one square foot this weekand another of the same crop in two weeks or so.3. It promotes conservation, companion planting, crop rotation, and allowsbetter plant hygiene and reduced pest problems.4. It automatically helps to improve your growing soil three times a year invery easy, small steps. Remember the saying, “Square by square, you’ll soon bethere.”5. Besides all of the above, it looks pretty.Just like a patchwork quilt, the different colors, leaf textures, plantdensities, shapes, and heights, plus the visible grid will give you a verydistinctive, photo-opportunity garden. You’ll just love and admire it everytimeyou see it.Some people ask, “Why can’t we plant all sixteen squares with leaf lettuce orspinach or Swiss chard or whatever we want to plant?” Oh, that’s going rightback to the single-row mentality. Square Foot Gardening begins with visualizingthe harvest. It’s very difficult to put in four tiny plants of Swiss chard andthink that’s going to be enough for the whole family, but one square of red andone square of green chard usually is more than most families eat. Proof of thepudding . . . how many bunches of Swiss chard did you buy last week or even lastmonth? The stores have it, it’s fresh, and it looks good, so why didn’t you buyany more than you did? Well, it’s the same answer as to why you shouldn’t planttoo much of one thing.It’s worth repeating here that the biggest problem for single-row gardeners hasalways been “I planted too much. I can’t take care of it. It’s too much work andI’m sorry now.” All that has changed with SFG and you now have boundaries (thegrid) and the opportunity to ask yourself, “For every single square foot Iplant, is that enough? Do I really want more? Would it be better to plantanother square foot of the same thing in a week or two or three?”TIME OF YEARImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Keep in mind that you can build a Square Foot Garden anytime of the year—spring,summer, fall, and even winter. For most of the country, you could start plantingin any season other than winter. What time of the year is it right now for youand where are you in the sequence of a yearly gardening cycle? Think of it likethe movie theater before the main feature. You’re all settled in with yourpopcorn, ready to devote your full attention to the movie. In the gardeningyear, this is usually the equivalent of springtime. What if you came in themiddle of the picture? For gardening that would be summertime. You can stillplant a warm-weather crop even if you missed the spring crop. If it’s now fall,you can still start your SFG with a great cool-weather crop and get somevaluable experience before next spring. Start whenever you get the urge toplant.For convenience, we’ll start with the beginning of the garden year for most ofthe country, springtime. (Some parts of the country, like Texas and Florida, cangrow all year long. You lucky people.)Image [../images/f0113-01.jpg]SEASONAL PLANTSYou can get at least three crops a year in every square foot of your SFG. Everychoice is going to be fun, exciting, and tasty. Of course, your selectiondepends on the time of year, and what you and your family need and want. Thereare two types of crops when you consider weather. The first are calledcool-weather crops that do best in the spring and fall, but won’t survive in thehot summer. The second group is the warm-or hot-weather crops that, you guessedit, don’t do well in the cool weather of spring and fall, but thrive in the hotweather of summer.HARDINESS AND PROTECTION WITH SFGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]SFG’s size makes it very easy to protect your new plantings from an extra earlyor late frost. There’s a lot more information about frosts and freezes inChapter 9 [ch09.html#ch09], especially if you are interested in extending theseason, as well as ways to protect your plants so you can get more from yourgarden.Plants aren’t all the same, of course. They are just like people. Some can standthe heat, cold, or humidity better than others. We classify these as hardy, andthose that can’t handle it as non-hardy. Each of the four seasons has three timeperiods—the early season, midseason, and late season. If you’re thinking about aspring crop, for example, there may be some vegetables that can only grow in themid-part of the spring while others can tolerate a little more cold in thebeginning of the season, but can’t stand any heat at all near the late part ofthe season. It takes a little while to get used to which is which, and how bestthey fit in with your planting schedule.Though the weather is never exactly the same every year, it helps to know aplant’s hardiness. Don’t worry—you’ll learn it in time. This is not an exactscience so relax if you’re a beginner and just enjoy the ride. Don’t expect tofind a perfect list because how well plants thrive differs in different parts ofthe country and of course, different years, sometimes for no explainable reason.If you lose a few squares of something one year it’s no big deal. It doesn’tmean you’re not going to be a great gardener.FROST DATESAlthough people like to celebrate the first day of spring (March 20th) accordingto the calendar, plants don’t give a hoot about our calendar—they respond toweather. In the spring we need to know the date of the last frost in our area.That will help us determine when to plant. Each different crop—whethercool-season or warm-season—will need to be planted so many weeks before or afterthat last day of frost.For plants, the fall growing season begins not with the first calendar day offall (September 23rd), but with the first frost and continues until the firstfreeze of the fall. The average dates of your first and last frost depend onwhere you live in the country and the regional and local variations of weather.All we can do is go by the past and hope it will be similar this year. To help,the government collects dates for your area and calculates the average date fromthe past 100 years. Of course, the average is only a guide.How do you find your local frost dates? The Internet is the best resource fordetailed information. You can also call your local county extension agent ormost area nurseries. To find your local extension agent, look in the Governmentblue pages for your county in your telephone book, then look for the heading“Extension of [your state] University.”Image [../images/f0114-01.jpg]FROST DATE WEBSITESYou can access your frost dates on any number of websites, by entering “frostdates” in the search engine. The best one I’ve found iswww.victoryseeds.com/hardzone [http://www.victoryseeds.com/hardzone]. ThisInternet site has the frost dates and hardiness zone maps for the entire UnitedStates as well as Canada, and links for hardiness zones for Australia, Europe,the Ukraine (in English), and China (also in English). The hardiness zone mapfor the United States is interactive, you just point to where you live andclick, and you get the information. This site also links to your localuniversity extension service. Let the experts advise you on the varieties thatwill do best in your local area.SEQUENCE OF GROWTHImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Did you know that plants grow and bloom everywhere in the same sequence? Inother words, throughout the country, daffodils bloom in the springtime, then alittle later tulips bloom, then it’s time for the lilacs to bloom. (Did I leaveout dandelions?) Start noticing the sequence in your location. It would includetrees, shrubs, flowers, even weeds.I read a book once about following spring north. It’s theoretically possiblethat if you drive fast enough (and eat and sleep quickly), you could see nothingbut tulips in bloom all the way from Georgia to Maine.If you know what kinds of plants are summer crops (the most popular andwell-known vegetables), it’s easy to remember that everything else is a springor fall crop. Summer crops include beans, peppers, eggplants, tomatoes, andsquash. If you plant these when it’s too early or cool, they’ll either die ortheir growth will most likely be stunted for that year.“You have got me so excited about gardening again; I love teaching SFG. It is somuch more successful than other methods. I don’t know why all gardeners andfarmers aren’t using it.”—Mike from UtahCHARTSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]I’ve designed charts for All New Square Foot Gardening so you’ll know when toplant and in what order. These charts will guide you along, providingseed-to-sprouting times at certain soil temperatures. I’ve also includedcalendar charts that show, based upon area frost dates (assuming you have afrost), how soon before or after a frost you can plant a given crop. You’ll findthat some plants are very frost-hardy and can be planted much earlier than thosethat are just on the borderline. Turn to page 252 to see the charts.PLAN ON A FALL CROPImage [../images/dotline.jpg]As soon as the summer crop is finished, you’re ready to plant cool-weather cropsfor the upcoming fall. These crops are frost-hardy, meaning that both young andmature plants withstand frost. The seeds you plant at the end of summer willsprout quickly since the soil is warmer. Transplants can begin outdoors and growmuch faster than the same thing planted in the spring. Look at the charts;compare sprouting times for the same seeds in both spring and summertemperatures.The fall crop gains an extra advantage from late summer weather. The problemwith cool-weather plants in the spring is not cool weather but warm weather atharvest time. A plant’s purpose in life is to reproduce seed, and the risingtemperatures of an approaching summer make this happen sooner. As it does so,the plant’s whole character changes. Many people don’t realize that plants likelettuce put up a flower stalk, which then goes to seed. If you wait too long toharvest lettuce, the stalk will shoot up, and the same thing happens to othercrops like cabbage. The head splits open, a stalk shoots up, develops flowers,and then turns to seed. It’s nature’s way of allowing the plant to reproduce,but the plant changes taste when this happens. All the energy goes toward theseed and the plant itself, as far as taste is concerned, becomes rather tough,coarse, and bitter.In cooler weather, this process is delayed. The plant feels no urgency tocomplete the growing cycle. So in the fall, the plant slows its maturationprocess, allowing it to maintain flavor for a longer length of time astemperatures continue to grow cooler and cooler. If it’s frost-hardy, it doesn’tmatter if it is the middle of fall and you start getting frost. Some plants canendure some freezing and still provide a crop for harvesting. Fall is a greattime to plant if you put in the right crops.SOIL TEMPERATUREImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Soil temperatures vastly influence sprouting times. For example, if you plantcarrot seeds in the summertime when the temperature of the soil is between 60and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the seeds will sprout in less than a week. But if youplant the same seeds in early spring when the ground temperature is perhaps 40degrees, they will take a month and a half to sprout. Just another 10 degreeswarmer and they will sprout in a little over two weeks. The chart shows thatwhen the soil is cold and freezing, no seeds will sprout. When it warms up to 40only half of them will sprout; but as soon as it gets to 50 degrees, suddenlyalmost all of them will sprout and will continue right through the warmertemperatures of summer and fall.What happens to seeds when they don’t sprout because the ground is cold? Theycould rot, or fungus could attack them. They could break their dormancy and thengo dry. They could be attacked by insects, or dug up by animals or birds. So,the quicker you can get them to sprout the better off they will be.SPRING, SUMMER, AND FALL CROPSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Some crops, like the cabbage family, take so long to grow that there isn’tenough time to plant seeds directly in the garden and wait for the harvest. Soyou have to buy from nurseries or raise your own transplants indoors ahead oftime.The same situation applies to the warm-weather summer crops like tomatoes,peppers, and eggplants. They take so long to produce that you must plant yourgarden with transplants. The charts show this all in detail, indicating when tostart seeds and when to transplant.The fall crop is better for raising your own transplants because you will beable to start the seeds in the summertime, raise the transplants outdoors inyour garden, and then move them into their permanent spot in the early fall forlate fall harvest.STARTING SEEDS AND GROWING SEEDLINGSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]There are plenty of advantages to growing your own transplants and storing theremaining seeds in their packet until next year. First, seeds cost pennies,while transplants cost dollars. There are many more varieties offered in seedcatalogs than as transplants at the nurseries. The only setback is time becausegrowing your own transplants depends on the time and work you can spare. Ifyou’re a brand new gardener, however, you may want to wait until next year tostart your own transplants. Like everything else in life, we tend to gooverboard and do too much and then it becomes a chore. Don’t let it happen toyou!STORAGE OF SEEDSIf your seeds are stored properly, they will last for many years. Contrary towhat the gardening industry would like you to believe, it is not necessary tobuy fresh seeds every year or to pour out that whole packet of seeds all atonce. SFG teaches you to plant just a pinch of seeds.Image [../images/f0117-01.jpg]Although it’s a great idea to start your own transplants from seed, this is anexample of what not to do. It’s not necessary to sow so much when you practicethe SFG method.Then store the rest. By planting just a pinch of seeds instead of a wholepacket, you can save a lot of money by saving the excess seeds for next year’scrop, and the next year’s, and so on. Some seeds will last up to five years.Seed companies guarantee that a certain percentage will sprout; this number isalways very high, usually up into the nineties. Of course the seed industrywants you to buy a fresh packet of seeds every year so they can stay inbusiness. There’s nothing wrong with that! But there’s also nothing wrong withsaving money with a more efficient system.Image [../images/f0110-01.jpg]KID’S CORNERA SEED’S SIZE AND SHAPEThe interesting thing about seeds is their shapes and sizes. Why are seedsdifferent sizes and different shapes? That’s a fascinating inquiry into natureyou could make with your kids. Quite often their shape depends on how they wereformed or nestled together in the seedpod. Does the size and shape have anythingto do with their ability to sprout? Yes and no. In general, the smaller the seedthe more delicate it is as a young plant and the greater the care it needs tosuccessfully germinate and grow. The size quite often depends only on the plantspecies itself.HOW TO STORE SEEDSWhat is the ideal storage condition for seeds? It is just the opposite of themoisture and warmth that make them sprout. You’ll want to store them in a cool,dry place—the driest, coldest place in your home. Some people freeze theirseeds. But I find they get moisture even if they are in a zip-lock bag becauseit never seems to be totally airtight. I prefer refrigerating them in awide-mouth jar with a screw lid. Label your containers and store them in therefrigerator on a back shelf. In each jar place a desiccant packet from a filmcontainer, or medicine vial, or add a little powdered milk wrapped in a tissueto soak up any excess moisture in the jar.GERMINATION RATEWhat happens to seeds that are in storage? As they grow older, their germinationrate (the percentage that sprouts under ideal conditions) gradually diminishes.But the solution is very simple. Plant a pinch of seeds—just two tothree—instead of only one to ensure that at least one will sprout. If your seedsare many years old, test the germination rate yourself or just plant three orfive or however many seeds depending on how well they sprouted the year before.If you marked the sprouting rate on the packet, you can reasonably estimate howmany to plant the next year.WHAT DID I DO WRONG?Image [../images/dotline.jpg]Knowing that roots sprout first will help your seeds successfully grow. Here’swhy. Traditionally, gardeners hoed open a row, planted, covered, watered, andthen walked away from their garden hoping for the best. If nothing grew,single-row gardeners thought the worst: “Maybe they were bad seeds. Or worse,maybe I’m a terrible gardener!” What all of these gardeners did not realize wasthat the seed might have already sprouted, perhaps after a week or two, and theroot was heading down before the top could come up and break the surface. If thegardener gave up and quit watering, it is possible that their seed did die. Why?Because if the soil dries below the seed—in the root zone only 1 or 2 inchesbelow the surface—the root will wither and die from lack of moisture. But if thegardener had kept the soil moist, then the seeds would have had a good chance toput the root down to support the plant and its new shoot.KEEPING RECORDSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Many gardeners keep planting data—when, what, and where they plant, how long ittakes to sprout, and how well their plants grow. It may sound like a lot ofbookkeeping, yet some people enjoy recording their garden data and even set upcomputerized spreadsheets to make computations from this information. I don’tbother to keep all these details myself, but if you enjoy it, this may help youlearn faster and measure the progress more effectively.Image [../images/f0110-01.jpg]KID’S CORNERWHICH SPROUTS FIRSTWhich part of a seed sprouts first? Is it the top stem with its leaves? A funchildren’s book would have the tops popping out of the ground—looking around andif it likes what it sees and wants to stay, calling down to the root and saying,“Anchor me in.” But that’s a fairy tale.For all seeds, the root sprouts first and goes down. How does it know to godown? Gravity! After the root gets started and secured with little feeder rootsso it can start taking up moisture and nutrients, it calls up to the top andyells “all clear below” then the top sprouts and goes straight up againstgravity. It is not because of darkness or light or any other reason—strictlygravity, and the all-clear signal, of course.MOVING PLANTSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]A SFG garden is small, and I’ve been able to change things around once they wereall planted. It doesn’t take much to move and replant something from one squareto another if you think it would look better somewhere else. It’s kind of likearranging a room of furniture and pictures on a wall. You can make all kinds oflayouts and drawings even to scale, but I guarantee you once everything is inplace, you’ll change your mind.DROP A PINCHImage [../images/dotline.jpg]We have learned about seed size and shape and storage and sprouting conditions.The next thing is to practice planting. You can do this indoors in the winterbefore you start your garden. Take different kinds of seeds from the tiniest tothe largest and practice picking up and dropping a pinch of seeds onto a pieceof white paper to count your results. This is really a lot of fun, almost afamily game.There is a very practical reason for doing this. When I tell people to justplant a pinch of seeds—two or three—I think I have given them all theinstructions they need. But I always find so much variation in how many seedsthey end up planting. It’s in your finger dexterity, and you may need a littlepractice. If you are having trouble, you may even want to use a spoon forpicking up that pinch of seeds. A white plastic spoon usually works great,especially if you’re using darker colored seeds. If you scoop up too many, youcan just shake a few back into the palm of your hand.Image [../images/f0120-01.jpg]HOW DEEP?Image [../images/dotline.jpg]How deep should you plant a seed? This depends a lot on the size of the seed andthe soil you plant it in. Generally speaking, a seed’s depth is two to fourtimes the thickness of the seed. It’s important to place your seeds below amoist surface to prevent it from drying out. Too close to the surface and it candry out from the hot sun. Once a seed receives moisture and begins sprouting(known as “breaking dormancy”), it will die if it dries out so don’t forget towater regularly.Image [../images/f0121-01.jpg]Plant seeds 2 to 4 times the depth of their size. When they’ve sprouted,transplant them into four packs. When they’re large enough and the right timecomes, move them into their own square foot.TOO DEEP ISN’T A PROBLEMYou don’t have to worry too much about placing your seed too deep, in partbecause your Mel’s Mix is loose and friable. If the seed is planted too deep forthe kind of seed it is, as soon as it begins to receive moisture, nature willtell it, “Get going, buddy, put some roots down and start growing.” That sproutcan push right up through Mel’s Mix because there are a lot of nooks andcrannies and the soil is very easy to move. This is one of the hidden advantagesof starting with perfect soil. It almost guarantees that all of your seeds willgrow into plants.TIME TO SPROUTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]How long does it take to sprout seeds? The chart in the Appendix shows how manydays it takes various types of seeds to sprout at various temperatures. Inaddition, what percentage can you expect to sprout? This chart can be valuableto you and should be used whenever you plant seeds. If you know ahead of timeit’s going to take 10 days for the seeds to sprout at the average outdoortemperatures, then you won’t be a nervous Nelly every day wondering when, butyou will know to keep that soil moist for those number of days. You can alsojudge from the percentage that will sprout at that temperature, how many extrabeyond two or three seeds to plant to ensure one good healthy plant.PRESOAKINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Before planting your seeds, give them a jump-start by presoaking them. Whilesome can be soaked overnight, some fall apart after only an hour; it depends onthe seed. Big seeds should be soaked for only about a half hour to an hour. Beanand pea seeds, which might look shriveled up, swell up and break in half if yousoak them too long. Beware, water makes some seeds slippery. A plastic spoon canhelp you handle them.INDOOR SEED SPROUTINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The easiest way to sprout seeds indoors is to place them on a moist paper towel.Then put the paper towel and seeds in a very shallow tray or dish; keep it moist(a plastic bag would be handy to maintain moisture) and in a warm place in thehouse. Check daily; when you see roots, it’s time to plant. Rather than handlingthe seed at this point, carefully cut the paper towel into little squares, andlift each one out with a knife. Now you’re ready to take it outside, plant it inyour SFG filled with Mel’s Mix, cover it, and give it a drink of water. You’vejust given your plant a head start—in about half the time. Instead of fourteendays, you may see a sprout coming up in just six.STARTING TRANSPLANTS INDOORSNow it’s time to decide whether you want to grow your own transplants indoorsrather than direct seeding out-of-doors. To raise your own seedlings, you need alittle bit of paraphernalia: Mel’s Mix, a few cups and saucers, four-packs, andtrays. Start your seeds in a little cup of vermiculite and transplant them intofour-packs filled with Mel’s Mix after they begin growing.SEED LEAFWhen you’re sprouting seeds in a cup of vermiculite, I suggest you transplantthem into the four-pack as soon as the tops have sprouted and you see the firsttwo leaves called the seed leaves. Most garden experts say to wait until youhave two “true” leaves, but I have found that if you wait until the set of trueleaves develops, the roots have already grown so long and tangled that it’salmost too late to transplant. The seed leaf comes first, and it’s usually afairly flat, large leaf that doesn’t look like the plant’s regular leaves. Thefirst set of “true” leaves comes out next as the stem grows higher.LIFT BY ITS EARSWhen the seeds have seed leaves and you’re ready to transplant to the four-pack,carefully lift the plant by holding on to one of the seed leaves between twofingers. Then with your pencil, dig in the vermiculite, loosen it up, and liftthe whole plant out—root and all—from the bottom while your other hand isholding the top of the plant by one of the seed leaves. Don’t touch the plantstem, just the leaf. If the roots are very long, trim off the bottom third witha pair of scissors. Don’t worry . . . you won’t kill the plant. For every rootyou cut off, two new roots will sprout as it branches out, creating a muchstronger plant.Image [../images/f0123-01.jpg]To start seeds for growing your own seedlings, poke some holes into the bottomof a container. (This is a leftover plastic container shown in the photo.) Fillthe container with vermiculite and pour water around the rim of the plate.Image [../images/f0123-02.jpg]Add enough water until you notice a very slight color change to the vermiculite(it becomes darker). Pour a few seeds into the palm of your hand.Image [../images/f0123-03.jpg]Pinch a few seeds with your thumb and forefinger.Image [../images/f0124-01.jpg]Sprinkle the seeds across the surface of the vermiculite.Image [../images/f0124-02.jpg]Cover the seeds with a thin layer of vermiculite (unless they need light togerminate; check the seed package).After the seeds sprout, take your pencil and make a hole in one cell of yourfour-pack, or outdoors in your garden soil. Then lower the plant root down intothe hole. Make sure the hole’s big enough to hold the whole root. Take the pointof the pencil and push the Mel’s Mix around the plant. Plant it a little lowerthan when it sprouted. Give it some water, either from above for outdoors orfrom below for indoors in four-packs, and then give it shade immediately. Sunwill kill that young seedling. In fact, if you’re outdoors, always work in yourown shadow, then make sure the plant has shade for at least a couple of days.(Refer to Chapter 4 [ch04.html#ch04] for information about how to build shadecages.) Then you can let it have brighter light and then finally full sunlight.TRIM THE ROOTSWhen you place transplants into the garden, take a look at the roots to see ifthey are rootbound, in other words, if they’ve grown in a circle. My solutionfor a rootbound plant is to take that same pair of scissors and just cut off thebottom roots. Yes, the whole thing—the mass of roots and the soil. Then all theends of the roots, wherever they are, will branch and send out little feederroots. Lower the whole plant into the hole at the proper spacing in your outdoorgarden.Image [../images/f0125-01.jpg]You can trim excess roots by snipping them off with your garden shears.Image [../images/f0125-02.jpg]Push the mix around seedlings to form a slight saucer shape in the mix. Becauseof the saucer shape, water is directed straight down to the roots.WATER WELLOne caution: the plant and root should be very wet before you transplant intoyour SFG. Take your four-pack and let it float in a bucket of warm water untilit sinks and there are no more bubbles coming up. That’s when you know theplants are totally saturated with water. Then take it out, pop each plant out ofits container, cut the root bottoms off, and plant it. Your garden soil shouldbe moist, so you’re not putting a wet plant into dry ground. Dry ground willsuck the moisture right out of the roots.SAUCER-SHAPED DEPRESSIONNext, push the soil back around the plant to form a slight saucer shape in thesoil. Make sure you plant at the level of the soil, factoring in the slightdepression of the saucer. Because of the saucer shape, water goes straight downto the roots. We don’t want to water the rest of the square foot if we don’thave to. How’s that for conserving water?“I was surprised at how much I could get from such a small area.”—Michael from GeorgiaOUTDOOR SEED SPROUTINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The procedure for outdoor seed sprouting, transplanting into 4-packs, watering,and then planting into the garden is all the same, just in much nicer weather.Late afternoon on a cloudy day is the best time.HARDENING OFFHardening off is the process of getting the plant adjusted to a newenvironment—like going from indoors to outdoors. It’s important that your plantsare acclimated gradually so they can get used to their new location anddifferent weather conditions. This requires some effort because you don’t wantthem out at night when it’s cold or freezing and you also don’t want them out inthe burning hot sun in the daytime.REGULATE SUNLIGHT AND HEATTo help harden off plants, regulate the sun exposure. If it’s hot out, placeyour plants out in the sunlight in the morning, but at noontime provide someshade. Let them receive direct sunlight in the early morning, shade at midday,and perhaps, when the sun starts down, a little more direct light in theafternoon. Now that’s really pampering your garden plants. And don’t forget thelittle drinks of water every now and then. Actually all that sun, then shade,then sun can easily be done with a shingle stuck in the ground at the rightplace and the right angle.CAN’T DRY OUTTo keep your newly planted seeds from cooking in the hot sun, cover the squarewith a piece of cardboard cut to fit in the grid. Estimate the soil temperatureand sprout time (see the charts in the Appendix), then write the sprout date andthe date you planted it on the cardboard with a magic marker. Weight down thecardboard to keep it from flying away in the wind. Of course, you’ll need tolift the cardboard before you sprinkle water on the soil surface to keep thesoil moist, and then remove it a day or two before the sprout date.SPACINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]How many plants will fit into a square foot? The numbers are so simple and easyto remember: 1, 4, 9, or 16. If you like math, and who doesn’t, you willrecognize right away that these numbers happen to be the squares of 1, 2, 3, and4. And, in addition to the fact that we’re gardening in square foot plots,that’s how Square Foot Gardening got its name . . . because it’s as simple asone, two, three, four. The number of plants you grow in a square foot depends ona plant’s size when it’s fully grown. (Go to the chart in the Appendix to seemature plant sizes.)You can also figure it out very easily from the “thin to,” directions on a seedpacket. (Now, every time you read “thin to,” you will think of me and say toyourself, “Why do the seed packets tell me to plant so many seeds only to goback and thin to just one plant?”)Image [../images/f0127-01.jpg]A TYPICAL GARDENImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Let’s plant one 4 × 4 and see how much we will grow in those 16 square feet.We’ll start with tall plants on the north side of the box so they don’t shadeshorter plants. Then put some colorful flowers in each corner. Let’s assume itis still springtime, but that we’re past the last frost, so we could put fourpansies in each corner using our favorite colors.Carrots require little care until they’re harvested. So let’s plant two squaresof different carrots in the center squares, one square of sixteen onions and alow-maintenance square of sixteen radishes in the center. Then we’ll put onesquare of nine beets in an outside square because we’ll harvest their leavesduring the season and then finally pull the beet bottoms later. We can plant twoor three varieties of leaf lettuce on the outside, depending on your tastes. Inanother square we could put sixteen chives, and four parsley plants in another,which would provide us a continual harvest. For more color we might want to puta square of red salvia along the back. And perhaps in one corner some dwarfdahlias, one per square foot. Or perhaps some nasturtiums spaced at one persquare foot. One of the first things we would have planted in the spring is oneor two squares of spinach, nine per square foot. Then depending on your family’staste we could have one or more squares from the cabbage family. That could bered or green cabbage, broccoli, or cauliflower. Keep in mind this is not theonly 4×4 in the whole garden. So we don’t have to put all the cabbage into oneSFG. It’s better to space them out throughout the garden—makes it harder for thecabbage moth to find them all.PLANS AND DRAWINGSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Remember I mentioned that some people feel a desire to think ahead and draw up alist of everything to be planted in their garden. Then there are even somepeople who want to assign those plants to spaces ahead of time. So it meansdrawing a chart, more or less to scale, of your garden and assigning thoseparticular crops to each square foot. Despite being an engineer, who lovescharts and diagrams, I don’t usually do that. I just like to plant as I see fit.It’s very easy to stand in the garden and as the square becomes vacant you justlook around and decide it’s time to plant another square of radishes. Or maybeyou’d like to have some more beans, but this time you’ll put in the yellowvariety instead of green. It’s also very easy to spot and plant where you’d likesome color. I find it very easy to just bring home a four-pack of flowers Iliked at the nursery and decide by looking at the garden where they would lookbest. But it’s your Square Foot Garden, and you should do whatever makes youhappy.REPLANTINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Keep in mind that, as soon as you harvest, it won’t be a big deal to replantbecause you’re going to do it one square foot at a time. Once your newly plantedgarden starts maturing in the spring—for example, that square foot of radisheswill be ready to harvest in four weeks—you’ll be ready to replant just that onesquare. The season has changed and it’s warmer, and most of your summer cropscan now be planted. So your choices have increased and also most of the summercrop is fairly long-lived and will be in that spot through the whole summerseason. As you replant you keep the same criteria in mind—taller plants on thenorth side to keep them from shading other plants, working your way to cascadingflowers on the front corners to look pretty. Place plants that don’t need muchattention and only occasional harvesting like peppers on the inside, and shorterplants and those that need constant care or harvest to the outside just to makethem easier to tend.WEEDINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]This could be the shortest paragraph in the entire book. To start with, yourMel’s Mix has no weed seeds in it, and any weeds that do sprout are easilyobserved because they’re not in the proper space and they look different fromthe plants that are there. Because the soil is so soft and friable weeds comeout easily—root and all. You have to weed about once a month. End of paragraph;end of story.Image [../images/f0129-01.jpg]This is a good example of a rootbound container plant. You’ll want to trim thematted roots before planting. (Don’t worry, it’s better for the plants anyway.)HARVESTINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Keep in mind that we harvest many of the crops continuously, if possible. Forexample, a leaf lettuce is not allowed to wait until it forms a large, maturehead, but with a pair of scissors and a salad bowl you can continuously trim theleaves from such things as lettuce, chives, beets, Swiss chard, spinach,parsley, and even onion tops. As long as you don’t take too much at one time,the plant will easily survive and thrive. Filling your salad bowl each dayshould not diminish the garden in any way. In fact, right after you harvestyou’ll find it hard to notice where you got everything and if anything ismissing.YOU’VE LEARNED THE BASICSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]You’ve now learned all the basics of Square Foot Gardening. You’ve learned howit got its name—from the squares of one, two, three, four. You have also learnedhow many and what kind of plants fit into a square foot by memorizing,calculating, or by looking it up on the chart. You’ve learned how to zip zap inthe soil to get the proper and exact spacing then start planting your seeds andtransplants. Are we having any fun yet? Next chapter we’re going to discuss howto maintain and harvest your SFG.Okay, now it’s time to go out to your garden and do something outrageous thatwill amaze or dumbfound any neighbor who might be watching you. Do you know howto do a rain dance?"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0131-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0131-02.jpg]This is going to be a fairly short chapter because SFG requires so littlemaintenance once your garden is prepared and planted. You’ll experience acontinuous cycle of nurturing, harvesting, and replanting each year with no soilpreparation and no weeding to do ever again. How does that sound?All of the nurturing you’ll need to do consists of providing necessarystructural support for plants, ridding the garden of any tiny, occasional weedsor pests, and watering. You’ll enjoy observing your garden’s growth untilharvest; every square is different because it was planted with a different cropat a different time. That’s what makes SFG so interesting.CAREImage [../images/dotline.jpg]When asked to name the greatest advantage of the All New Square Foot Gardening,most say it’s tending their garden from aisles and never stepping on their soil.Like many others, I always wondered why we were taught to loosen soil withrototillers, shovels, forks, and hoes, only to walk all over it again packing itdown.So why are the experts still teaching us to do this? I say, just stop walking onyour growing soil—it’s that simple.KEEP IT LOOSEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Let’s think of some of the advantages of not packing your soil down. The plantroots need air and moisture, just like people. If you pack the soil down, itbecomes more and more compressed (called compaction) and it becomes harder andharder for air to circulate through the soil making it more difficult for rootsto grow. They may not die, but they certainly won’t grow well. So why notprovide them with nice, loose, friable soil like Mel’s Mix? This way, water canpercolate down and air can circulate.Image [../images/f0132-01.jpg]These are the only tools you need for your All New Square Foot Garden. A trowel,a pencil, and scissors—that’s it.THREE TOOLSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Another big advantage of SFG is that the number and cost of tools is reduced toalmost nothing—you will only need three tools. Just think, you no longer need arototiller! Eliminate that cost and you now have an extra $1,000 in your pocket.And you don’t have to hire someone at $50 every year to plow for you. You don’teven need a shovel or rake or any of those special digging tools that have beeninvented to dig up the tough soil. Gardening “experts” will tell you to go outand buy the best tools you can find because they will last longer, but they alsocost more. With SFG, you no longer need any of those big, expensive, heavy-dutytools that take so much energy to maneuver—they’re suddenly obsolete.A TROWEL, A PENCIL, AND SCISSORSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The first tool of the three tools you need is a trowel. I’ve found that theone-dollar variety is really the best buy. They’re attractive, strong, and neatlooking. They have all the features of a six dollar trowel. So instead of justone, now you can afford six—one for every SFG box! Why not buy an assortment ofcolors? You can have one in every box just sitting there waiting so that youdon’t have to go looking for a tool when you walk by and see a square that isready for replanting. Of course, if you see an occasional weed, your big, strongweeding tools are your own thumb and forefinger!Image [../images/coin.jpg] PENNY PINCHERI like to buy children’s pointed scissors in August when you can findback-to-school sales. Usually I can purchase them for about fifty cents—anaffordable price that allows for several pair around the garden.The trowel is for transplanting, for mixing in an added trowel full of compostwhen you replant each square foot, and for loosening up and turning over theMel’s Mix in an individual square foot or even an entire 4×4. In the spring youwon’t believe how perfect the soil will be if you follow the Mel’s Mix formulaand start with a perfect soil.The other two tools you’ll need are a pencil (yes, that’s a tool) for pokingholes and lifting out young seedlings for transplanting, and a pair of scissorsfor harvesting beet, lettuce, or Swiss chard leaves for supper, cutting off deadblossoms, and snipping off extra seedlings if more than one seed sprouts in ahole. Because SFG tools are so simple and inexpensive, I love to splurge andkeep one of each at every 4×4. That way, I never have to look for a tool.It would be fun to list all the tools that you no longer need if you have a SFG.In fact, you could probably just go into your garage or toolshed and see themall right there—poor, lonely tools. Maybe you have some old-fashioned single-rowfriends who just can’t give up all that hard work and could use some extraheavy-duty tools. You could rent them out and maybe make a few bucks.Image [../images/coin.jpg] PENNY PINCHERYou can even make your own kneeling pad out of scrap carpeting. If you have someleftover indoor/ outdoor carpeting, it won’t matter if it gets wet; it driesquickly and folds up nicely to make a great kneeling pad. It wouldn’t hurt tohave a few of these pads scattered throughout your SFG. They are available asscrap or samples at any place carpeting is sold.OPTIONAL ACCCESSORYImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Although you only need three tools, you might want to invest in a kneeling pad.Unless your boxes are placed on tabletops, your most frequent position whilegardening will be kneeling. For less than four dollars, you can buy a kneelingpad that is comfortable and durable. There’s no need to buy the fancy ones thatstrap to your knees. They’re terribly uncomfortable and will end up hanging inyour tool shed along with the other lonely tools.WEEDSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]SFG has few or no weeds. But how? Weeds plague every garden, right? First, thereare no weed seeds in peat moss or vermiculite. Next, any seeds that were in theingredients you added to the compost pile will get cooked and killed in that 150degrees Fahrenheit temperature as the pile heats up. If you prepare the bedproperly and line the bottom of the box with landscape fabric, no weeds willsprout from the bottom. Since we are not using our ground soil, which is filledwith weeds, the only possible weed seeds in our SFG might have blown in, and assoon as they sprout, you will see them because they are out of place. Your twofingers will do the rest, pulling out the weed, roots and all. Compare that towhat you’ve experienced with your existing soil. Anytime the existing soilanywhere in the country is left alone, it sprouts weeds. Which system would youlike to have in your backyard?Image [../images/f0134-01.jpg]First, remove any weeds or grass from inside your box, then lay down landscapefabric as a weed barrier. This will be your “best friend” against future weeds.I SEE YOUHow can you tell if a new sprout is a weed? First, it’s not in the proper spaceamong your little transplants. Remember one, four, nine, and sixteen.If it is out of place (and I’ll bet you were careful to make sure your spaceswere correct in that square foot), you’ll pull it out of that soft Mel’s Mixwithout a problem.PESTS AND PLANT PROBLEMSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The only way to intelligently answer the questions we get about pests and plantproblems requires knowing the weather, growing conditions, history, and presentgardening condition in an area. If the question came from my county, I’d give agreat answer. But when it comes from across the country or anywhere in theworld, it’s difficult to give an accurate answer.COUNTY EXTENSION AGENTSThere is a good solution. Some of our tax dollars go to train and maintain astaff of horticultural experts in every county in the country—the countyextension service agents. In addition, the county extension agents train anothergroup of neighborhood volunteers called “Master Gardeners,” who then go out inthe community helping others by answering their questions. It is a greatservice, and we often refer questions to the agents and their staff. If yourquestion is about pests or problems or even the best varieties to grow in yourarea, you couldn’t find a more informative source. To find your local extensionagent, look in your phone book in the Government blue pages, find your county,and then look for the heading “Extension of (your state) University,” don’t lookunder “Agriculture.”“I’ve lived my life doing the backbreaking work of single row gardening—this isso much better!”—Gina from KentuckyThe only problem I have with the county agents is that most of them are trainedin our agricultural colleges, which still teach single-row farming andhand-me-down gardening. So, they are not the best source for answers to SFGquestions. You’ll have to come to us for those questions.To summarize pests and problems, try not to worry about them. Enjoy your garden.If one square gets devastated, pull it up and replant it with something else. Ifyou didn’t use the protective structures of Chapter 4 [ch04.html#ch04], try themout next season to help eliminate your problems.WHICH PLANT VARIETIES?Image [../images/dotline.jpg]Quite often people will ask questions like, “Which are the best varieties ofpotatoes or carrots to grow in my corner of the state?” These questions can onlybe answered by your local expert—the county extension agent. They are alwaysup-to-date on all the new varieties and what grows best in their area. Keep inmind if you have a question about any of the vine crops, you will want to trainthem to a trellis, while most single-row gardens allow them to sprawl.Image [../images/f0136-01.jpg]Notice how easily vine crops such as pole beans climb the trellis netting all bythemselves. Other vine crops, such as tomatoes, need a little help from you eachweek.SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL PLANTSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Some plants, such as root crops and low-growing salad crops, need no support, sothere is nothing to do for them. The taller crops might need a little help,however, depending on whether they are a leaf or head crop like Swiss chard orcabbage. If a heavy wind and rain or hailstorm knocks them over, simplystraighten them up and push a little extra soil around the stem.TOO TOP HEAVYThe plants that usually need a little support are the summer crops like peppers,okra, eggplant, corn, and bush tomatoes. Those can easily be supported by usinga U-shaped wire support cage or horizontal fencing or netting suspended acrossthe entire 4×4 garden, held tight by four corner posts. (See Chapter 4[ch04.html#ch04] for construction details.) The same support technique will alsowork for tall flowers like gladiolus, giant marigolds, and tall dahlias. One ofthe reasons we provide plant support is the soil mix is so loose and friablethat the tall plants need a little help.WATERINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Plants need water just like people do. Everyone asks, “How do you water and howmuch?” My ideal way to water is ladling out a cup of sun-warmed water from abucket that can be left in the sun next to your garden. Gently lift the bottomleaves of the plant and, with your other hand, ladle a cup of that water intothe depression around the plant. With a saucer-shaped depression in the soil,the water will soak right down to the roots instead of rolling away from theplant into other parts of the garden.We do get a few people who say, “Oh that would take too long.” But they’vefailed to think about the fact that, first, their garden is only a fraction ofthe size that it used to be. That means 80 percent of the watering you used todo is no longer needed and was actually wasted. Next, you’re not watering thetops of the plants or the leaves, so you’re not promoting fungal diseases andother problems. You’re keeping the water where it will do the most good—aroundthe base of the plant where it can travel down to the root system.The soil consistency of your Mel’s Mix is already 100 percent of materials thathold moisture. When you water, it goes right into the soil around the rootsystem and stays there. The root system is going to be able to drink up thewater when and in the amount needed. Is this a major advance in waterconservation or what? Hello, conservationist, are you listening?Image [../images/f0138-01.jpg]When your plants need a drink, just dip a cup of water from your 5-gallon bucketof sun-warmed water, and pour it in the saucer-shaped depression.And why sun-warmed water? One answer is that it’s for the same reason peopledon’t like to take a cold shower. The more scientific reason is plants canabsorb nutrients in the soil much faster and grow better if the soil and watertemperature are warmer. In spring and late fall, sun-warmed water helps warm thesoil. Remember the chart in the Appendix showing sprouting times in varioustemperatures. The warmer the weather, the faster they’ll grow and the quickeryou’ll harvest. That’s why people have greenhouses. If you build a structure toform a miniature greenhouse around your SFG, the radiant heat from the sun willwarm the soil from the surface down. But simply pouring warm (not hot) waterinto the soil means the warmth tends to go a little deeper—and even quicker—thanthe sun baking the surface of the soil.DON’T DROWN MEInvariably gardeners water plants too much, perhaps out of kindness or fear thatthey will fail. So they think, “Oh, I’ll give it a little extra. It won’t hurt.”Usually it did hurt with local soil that didn’t drain well, but it won’t if youhave a Square Foot Garden where the soil drains excess water. Most people don’trealize that plant roots need air as well as moisture. Lucky for you, Mel’s Mixallows air into it because it’s loose and friable. (Chapter 5 [ch05.html#ch05]tells you how to make Mel’s Mix.)With Mel’s Mix you cannot overwater. Remember the sponge? Each little piece canhold moisture so a plant root can grow around that piece and take out themoisture when needed. When that little sponge gets saturated, the rest of thewater drains right out through the bottom. That’s how Mel’s Mix works, andthat’s why you never have to worry about giving your plants too much water.But because your soil mix drains readily when saturated, it also has a tendencyto dry out quicker than most garden soils. Regular soils stay saturated, sosingle-row gardeners may be used to turning on the sprinkler or flooding thegarden twice a week and that’s it. Your All New Square Foot Garden is different.You have to water a little more often and pay more attention to watering.The secret, of course, is looking at the plants. After a while you’ll be able towalk past your 4×4 garden box and immediately spot any square foot that needswater. Perhaps the plants will be slightly wilted. Maybe they’ll be just alittle droopy or their color will be a little off. You merely water those squarefeet right then and there because your bucket of warm water is always right nextto your garden. And because you’re dipping a cup in the bucket you’re not goingto get yourself all wet and dirty.Think of your plants in your garden the same as you do your children. If they’vebeen out in the hot sun and playing hard and one of them looks a little droopyand wilted, you know right away to inspect the child a little closer to makesure he or she is properly hydrated.Image [../images/f0139-01.jpg]NURTURE YOUR PLANTSI suggest watering by hand because it allows you the time to nurture yourplants. You’re able to stop and notice how your plants are growing. You canappreciate their beauty and color, notice their blossoms and fruit. It tells youwhen the plant is going to be ready for harvest. It’s a satisfying feeling towork in your garden with each plant. You’re not standing off in the distancewith a hose, which is very impersonal. You’re not opening a big valve andletting the sprinkler system take over or the irrigation water come in. (Andguess what? Irrigation water is filled with weed seeds. Have you folks who livein states that irrigate ever wondered why you have to weed your single-rowgarden so often?) Even a drip irrigation system is impersonal—though, I mustadmit, efficient.TOO MUCHExisting watering systems give all different types and sizes of plants the sameamount of water at the same time. This is not only very impersonal; it’s alsovery inefficient. If our farmers did that we’d have water shortages all aroundthe country. Hey, wait a minute, we do have water shortages all around thecountry!HOW MUCHIn conclusion, only water as much as each plant needs. And the best way to tellis from experience—the same way you know your child needs a drink. Yes, it doestake a little bit of experience to raise a family, but gaining this experiencebrings a lot of pleasure.ALTERNATE WATERING METHODSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]A HOSEFor those who want to use a more traditional method, there is always the hose.Yes, it’s a nuisance to get out or put away, and in row gardening it alwaysseemed to be knocking plants down as it has to be dragged around the garden.Another advantage to SFG boxes is the hose won’t do that anymore as the boxcorners keep the hose from crushing the plants.If you do use a hose, make sure you have one of those shut-off valves right atthe end of the hose so you have complete control of the force and amount of thewater. There are many short and long extension hand wands that come with a spraynozzle. This also allows you to water directly under your plants, and the nozzleon the end of the wand can be poked down and worked around the lower leaves ofthe plant so that most of the plant remains dry.Leave an extra length of hose coiled in the sun to help warm the water up alittle, maybe just to take the chill off tap water, but you have to be carefulat the start if it’s hot out and a hose full of water has been laying in the sunfor some time. You don’t want the water to be too hot. Do what you do whengiving the baby a bottle—test the water on your wrist.DRIP, DRIP, DRIPA very efficient way to water your SFG is with a drip irrigation system. I knowit was designed for row gardeners, but it can be adapted for SFG just as easily.The only problem I have is it sort of takes away the nurturing and closeattention paid to your plants. If you just turn a valve or worse yet, amechanical timer turns the water on and off, you never get close to your plantsand they will miss you.But I must admit the watering gets done very efficiently and effectively. Tryrunning small soaker tubes spaced every 6 inches the length of your box forcomplete coverage of every square foot.LAWN SPRINKLER SYSTEMSSome people tell me they have located their SFG on the lawn, and they have anunderground sprinkler system that goes on and off automatically. What shouldthey do, they ask? What can you do—rip up the lawn or turn off the system? No,you just live with it. I tell them to make do with what they have and just keepa bucket or two around for special plants as needed.HARVESTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Harvesting your crop is the culmination of the gardening experience. The harvestshould be a joyful and exciting time because, after all, this is why you’regrowing all these plants in the first place.TOO MUCHThe problem with traditional gardening is that there is too much to harvest allat once. If you plant an entire row of something all at once, it’s all going tobe ready to harvest all at once, and it becomes an overwhelming task. Not sogreat for the home gardener who just wants dinner tonight, not a month’s worthof lettuce in one day. So, after the first few pickings, the rest becomes alldrudgery.CONTROL THAT PLANTINGEverything is different with a SFG. Now, every time you begin to plant somethingin your SFG, look the item up in your SFG book to find how many to plant persquare foot. Prepare the soil, smooth it out, do the zip, zap, bing, bing, bing,bing to mark the spacing. Now, select the varieties you want from your seeds,pour some into the palm of one hand, and plant a pinch in each hole. As yousmooth the soil over the seeds, water with a fine spray. Then ask yourself, “DoI want any more than sixteen radishes all at once? They’ll be ready in fourweeks and they’ll all come to harvest within one week.” Usually the answer is“No. I really don’t want any more than this. I’ll wait a week or two to plantanother square foot of radishes somewhere else.” Right then and there you cansee one of the huge advantages of your grid establishing boundaries and SFGgiving you automatic control—simple and easy.Remember that the SFG theory is to visualize the harvest. Ask yourself, “Howmuch do I need for one or two weeks?” Then only plant that much. It takes abouta minute.A LITTLE OF THIS, A LITTLE OF THATYou don’t have to wait for the plant to mature to its maximum size. Go out atharvest time (which might be a half an hour before lunch or dinner) with yourpair of scissors and a small basket or salad bowl, and cut off a few outerleaves, perhaps one from each plant. To harvest a varied salad, just take fourlettuce leaves, parsley leaves from another, and perhaps beet greens fromanother. Each square may contain a different variety and color of lettuce. Youmight pull one radish and one carrot, even though they’ve only grown to halfsize, wash them off in your bucket of sun-warmed water, put the tops in thecompost bin, and then continue around your Square Foot Garden taking just alittle bit here and a little bit there of this and that. Soon your harvestbasket is full and you look at your garden and cannot even see that anything ismissing.“I had always been a little afraid of composting, but Mel makes everything sological and easy to understand.”—Karen from UtahSNIP, SNIPContinually harvest any type of leafy vegetable—like leaf lettuce or Swisschard—by snipping a little here and a little there throughout the season. Thiscan’t go on forever because the plant, especially cool weather plants, willeventually go to seed. When it sends up a seed stalk, the plant has completedits growing season and its use for harvesting. Take one last harvest, removewhat’s left over, and prepare that square foot for replanting—unless you wantthe kids to see how a lettuce or radish plant produces seed.HARVEST AND REPLANTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]With Square Foot Gardening, you’re only dealing with one square foot at a time.To paraphrase the words of Dr. Robert Schuller, “Inch by inch, anything’s acinch.” With SFG, our saying is going to be “square by square, you’ll soon bethere.” As soon as you finish harvesting one square foot, it’s time to preparethe soil and plant a new crop. Just take out any debris like dead leaves, stems,or roots—you can place these in your compost bin—then add a trowel full ofcompost (hopefully it’s homemade) to the square, turn the soil over with thetrowel, smooth it over, and you’re ready to replant. You can do all of that in60 seconds!REPLANTINGNow it’s getting more interesting and fun because you will be able to choosewhat you want to replant in every single square foot all through the gardenseason. Remember, you can get at least three crops a year in every square foot.So, multiply your number of square feet by three and there are a lot of choicesto make! Every choice is going to be fun, exciting, and interesting. Of course,what you select depends a lot on what time of the year it is and what you canuse and enjoy.A LITTLE NOWImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Whether you’re planting, harvesting, maintaining, or watering you don’t needhours and hours to enjoy your garden. Because you can do a little bit here and alittle bit there, you can do it anytime of the day—even on your way out thedoor! If you see a few tiny weeds growing, pluck them out; give a drink of waterto any plants that appear a little droopy or wilted (remember your bucket ofsun-warmed water is right there and so is your trowel if you need to loosen thesoil). It’s like straightening a crooked picture as you walk down the hall,jotting a note to someone who will be coming home soon, or putting somethingaway in the refrigerator. These are things you can do right then and there. Andthey’re fun things to do. No heavy work. No getting all dirty and sweaty.A WONDERImage [../images/dotline.jpg]If your garden is close to the back door or kitchen door, you’ll probably use itmuch more. You’ll enjoy the fresh greens and salad more often, eat healthier,and feel better. SFG could be part of a weight-loss program, if you ask me! Ontop of all that, you’ll have fun doing it! Don’t forget to share the fun withyour spouse, children, or grandchildren—the wonder of growth and harvest ispriceless. Harvest a few small plants with a child, and that child will rememberthe experience forever.NEXT CROPImage [../images/dotline.jpg]When the summer is finished, you’re ready to plant a fall crop, which will be acool-weather crop. Go through the whole quick process of picking out any debris,adding a trowel full of compost, mixing it in, smoothing it over, and decidingwhat’s next. There goes another minute out of your busy life. How about spinach?Check the spacing, get the seeds out, soak them for a little while, pop them inthe ground, smooth them over, water, and you’re all finished. Another minutegone, but you are creating life. You’ve now planted three crops in one squarefoot in only one year. You started with a root crop, replaced it with a fruitcrop, and finally, in the fall, added a leaf crop. In addition, you practicedsoil improvement three times in one year—square by square.ROTATION NOT CRITICALImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The nice thing about SFG is you are also practicing crop rotation without evenknowing it. Crop rotation is very important in traditional row gardening whendealing with existing soils that have very few nutrients in them—nutrients thatcan quickly be depleted by planting and replanting the same crop year after yearin the same soil. When you begin gardening with a healthy, rich soil like Mel’sMix, crop rotation is really not critical. Mel’s Mix gives you a garden soilthat is 33 percent compost, which has all the nutrients and trace elements thatplants need. But crop rotation is still a good idea for insect and pest controlin addition to soil nutrients. If you grow the same thing continuously in thesame place, eventually pests or diseases may take over since they have lived andplayed in that spot for so long. But if you replant every square three times ayear, SFG is going to be no picnic for them. They will have to move every twomonths. I’ll bet they will go somewhere else to set up residency. How about yourrow gardener next door that laughed at you when you started building your boxes?ADD COLORImage [../images/dotline.jpg]One more thing. Now that you’ve become an accomplished gardener one square at atime, you’ve improved the look and landscape of your garden and perhaps evenyour yard and patio. When you decide you need a little color over here or there,you may put in a summer crop of flowers—perhaps pink petunias—you become adesigner. Just think—you’re enjoying a painting in progress when you garden theAll New Square Foot Gardening way!Image [../images/f0144-01.jpg]What are some of your favorite flowers or herbs? Plant them among your veggiesfor added color and interest."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0145-01.jpg]By now, you might feel that the 80 percent reduction in size, the no fertilizerneeded, the growing in only 6 inches of Mel’s Mix, or even the no digging ofyour existing soil ever again are all that you could ask from your All NewSquare Foot Garden.In addition, you might say that most people would think that all of the above isamazing and earth-shattering (well, okay, how about just impressive), but thistopic, “Vertical Gardening,” is downright spectacular.HOW IT HAPPENEDImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Here’s a quick flashback to 1976 when this retired engineer took up gardening. Ideveloped SFG but as I looked at tomato plants growing in pots on decks and insingle-row gardens, I knew my work wasn’t complete. Tomatoes are not onlyAmerica’s favorite vegetable to grow, but they also take up the most room andcause quite an unsightly mess by the end of the season if they are allowed tosprawl all over the ground. There are also the complaints of slugs getting inand ruining all of the tomatoes as well as gardeners stepping all over the vinesand crushing them when trying to harvest the fruit. The whole idea of growingtomatoes this way seems very non-productive. At the time, the only cagesavailable were too short and too weak to solve the problem.I said, “This is no way to treat a tomato. We can’t let it lie down and sprawlall over the ground. It should be allowed to stand up straight and tall so thatit can be proud of itself and a benefit and credit to the community.”Six months later my vertical frame was designed, tested, and put into operation.It was an All-American model made from rigid German steel conduit and Japanesetwine. It was so strong that it held up through rain, sleet, snow, and heavySeptember storms when the tomato plant filled the entire frame and was loadedwith red, ripe tomatoes.After growing tomatoes this unique and attractive way for several years, I beganthinking about the other vine crops that spread all over the garden. Could theybe grown the same way? First I tried pole beans (a no-brainer), then cucumbersand peas. Then even winter and summer squash. They all worked and grew well, andthey looked just great growing on a vertical frame. And I was so pleased withthe results of growing vine crops this new way that I said, “This is a goodthing,” and included the method in my first book on SFG.“I couldn’t believe the amount of vegetables it raised.”—Dan from TexasImage [../images/f0146-01.jpg]But since then—Wow! You should see the vertical gardens now. The pumpkins, allkinds of melons (including the new smaller watermelons), and all of the reallybig squashes grow 7 feet in the air.VERTICAL GARDENINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]A few years ago at our display gardens in Utah, we were growing 35-poundpumpkins 7 feet in the air. We made the vertical frames 8 feet above the groundfor no other reason than we wanted to show off and demonstrate how tall they canbe! Now this was a spectacular sight, and many people have wanted to know howthey could accomplish this same feat in their own backyard.We usually refer to vertical gardening as “Advanced SFG.” But, really, as soonas you master the basics of Square Foot Gardening, you can enjoy growing cropsvertically. And you will be the envy of the neighborhood when you do.Image [../images/f0147-01.jpg]Growing vertically not only saves space but it also adds another dimension ofbeauty to your garden.PICTURE THISCan you just picture a wall of green in your garden filled with vine crops liketomatoes, cucumbers, pole beans, even melons and squash? All the colorful fruitjust hanging there waiting to be picked! No sprawling plants all over the groundwith their fruit lying on the soil getting all dirty and eaten by slugs. Thesewalls of green can even be located so they hide any unsightly areas of the yardor garage. They can even give you some privacy to keep neighbors from peeringover the fence to look at your SFG. It’s not only a spectacular sight, but thoseplants will be up in the air getting better sunshine and air movement. They’llproduce a more useable harvest for you with nothing wasted. To top all that off,each plant will only take 1 or 2 square feet of garden space and grow perfectlywell in your 6 inches of Mel’s Mix. Another big advantage is you can do all thisstanding up—no bending, kneeling, or squatting down to tend your plants.Image [../images/f0148-01.jpg]To construct a vertical frame, you need: two 5-foot electrical conduit pipes(1/2-inch diameter); one 4-foot conduit pipe (1/2-inch diameter); two 18-inchlong rebar supports of 1/2-inch diameter; screwdriver; hammer; two elbowconnectors; and trellis netting.CONSTRUCTING SUPPORTSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]I experimented through the years with all different types of materials andframes, and I finally settled upon one that was so simple, easy, and inexpensiveto use that it was almost ridiculous.I found that electrical conduit is the cheapest, strongest, and best material touse for the vertical supports. I do not like PVC pipe or wood because iteventually will bend and break and destroy your whole vertical garden. When youfirst build and plant a vertical frame out of just about anything, it lookssturdy and strong. But, near the end of the growing season, when your plantshave grown to the top and filled up all the open spaces, that frame acts like asail on a boat. Just when your tomatoes are getting ripe and ready to pick,along comes a late summer storm with lots of wind and rain, and the next thingyou know the whole thing is flat on the ground.Using electrical conduit and a steel ground rod (rebar) will prevent this fromhappening. And the two posts and top are simple and inexpensive to buy andinstall.The conduit itself costs a few dollars for a 10-foot length, so you can seewe’re not talking about big bucks here, and you should be able to talk the clerkat the store into cutting it in half. For the corners you can buy elbows,pre-bent rounded corners or bend your own if you have a conduit bender (abouttwenty bucks at the same store). It’s kind of fun to bend the conduit, and onceyou get the knack of it, it comes out nice and smooth with good curves (see thephoto on page 8 [contents.html#page_8]). The bent pipes are connected with asimple metal coupling (see the photo on page 158 [ch08.html#page_158]) that hastwo set screws that tighten each pipe together, and they both usually cost lessthan a dollar.PLACEMENT OF VERTICAL SUPPORTS IN THE SFG GARDENWhen you’re deciding where to place your vertical frames, keep in mind that youdon’t want the vines to shade the rest of the garden. So, the frames work bestwhen placed on the north side of each box. If you want more vertical crops thanone frame per box, you can make double or triple boxes and turn them east andwest so the frames can go all along the north side. You could also devote aspecial-sized box just for vertical crops. Make a 2×12-foot or any length boxwith a vertical frame continuously on the north side. This could stand against awall or fence. You could even plant the front squares with pretty flowers or anylow-growing crop like peppers or eggplant that will look great and will hide thebottom stems of the vertical vines.Image [../images/f0150-01.jpg]Once you’ve attached the elbow connectors to your 4-foot conduit pipe, lay itagainst the north-facing board of your SFG. Next, hammer the rebar where theelbows are located. You’ll want to drive the rebar in about half its height.INSTALLING THE VERTICAL FRAMEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Your vertical frame should be installed outside the box, so it sits on theground. Aside from driving the concrete reinforcing bars (rebar) into theground, and slipping the conduit over them, you could also attach the verticalframe to your box with pipe clamps on the side. This would give them even morestability.SECURING VERTICAL SUPPORTS IN THE GROUNDTo secure the vertical frame, pound two 1/2-inch diameter pieces of concretereinforcing bars (rebar) into the ground. These bars can be purchased alreadycut at any building supply store and should be anywhere between 18 to 24 incheslong depending on your soil. The looser (sandier) your soil is, then the longerthe bar should be. Drive the rebar halfway into the ground, keeping it nice andstraight; I suggest you wear gloves for this. The two electrical conduit legsslip right over those 1/2-inch rebars and are securely in place. We never poundon the conduit itself because the ends will bend and then they won’t fit intothe coupling or over the rebar.Image [../images/f0151-01.jpg]Slide the 5-foot conduit pipes over the rebar for a standard strength verticalframe. Or, as described below, use a short steel fence post instead of the rebarfor an extra-strong frame.EXTRA-STRONG FRAME FOR HEAVY CROPSTo make the vertical frame extra strong for watermelons, squash, and pumpkins,drive a steel fence post into the ground first instead of the rebar. A fencepost can be just the shortest 3-foot tall size. Once the fence post is in theground, then the conduit is attached to it with three pipe clamps. The wholeframe then becomes so strong that it will hold up any weight no matter how highyou go.Image [../images/f0152-01.jpg]Attach the top conduit to the legs and tighten the screws in the elbows.VERTICAL SUPPORTS ON A PATIO, BALCONY, ROOFTOP, OR WAIST-HIGH GARDENImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Vertical supports can also be added to patio, balcony, or waist-high gardens.They are constructed in the same manner. However, we suggest that they be notaller than 4 feet. Instead of using rebar in the ground to secure them, theyare fastened to the garden box using special clamps screwed into the sides ofthe box. Buy those when and where you buy your conduit and lumber. In thissituation, there’s not a great strength with the vertical frame, so it would benecessary to put the struts from the top down to the south side of the box, anddepending on how high, and your location, the wind, and the plant growth, youmight have to provide additional support. The illustration on the next pageshows guy wires.NYLON NETTING ON THE SUPPORTSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Now that the vertical frame has been constructed, it is time to add somethingfor the plants to grow on. I used to use either special wide-opening fencing orgood strong synthetic twine or cord, but then along came this beautiful, soft,indestructible nylon netting with large openings you can reach through. Thisnylon garden netting is now the only material I use for vertical gardening. It’swhite, keeps its color, can’t be broken, will last forever, and is easy to workwith. The netting is tied tightly and securely to the top and sides of thevertical frame, and the plants can then be gently woven in and out of thenetting as they grow. The netting comes in 4- and 5-foot widths and variouslengths and is available at most garden centers and catalogs. When we teach ourclasses, it is always fun to ask two of the strongest men to come up front andtry and break the netting; they just can’t do it!Image [../images/f0153-01.jpg]If you live in a city and have no plot of ground to call your own, call yoursuperintendent and ask for permission to build a rooftop garden.Image [../images/f0154-01.jpg]To attach the trellis netting to your frame, first hook the netting on the twocorners. Next, cut the netting at each connection. This will give you one longstrand. (Be careful to cut on the same side of the connecting strand each time.)Image [../images/f0154-02.jpg]Loop the long strand over the top of the frame and firmly tie a simple knot. Tryto keep the length uniform so your netting isn’t crooked.Image [../images/f0155-01.jpg]Make the same cuts down the sides of the frame and firmly tie knots around thesupporting pipes (above).Image [../images/f0155-02.jpg]Tie the netting tight and your vertical frame will look neat and trim for manyyears.Image [../images/f0156-01.jpg]With tight netting and a strong frame, you’ll be able to grow all sorts ofvining crops.ARBORS AND WALKWAYSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]If an upside-down, U-shaped metal vertical frame works so well for one box, justthink of all the various shapes, sizes, and arrangements you can make with morevertical frames. You can put two together in a straight line, turn a corner, oreven zigzag. You can put four together to form an arbor. You can put netting ontwo sides so it’s a walk-through, on three sides so it’s a sitting area, or onfour sides with one little opening for the kids to play in. That would be asecret place, and you could put netting across the top or run two sets ofvertical frames down a pathway, creating a wall. You could even create a wholemaze with dead ends, turns, and twists. All of the types of plants that wouldgrow on it produce huge leaves, and make a very interesting visual pattern foryour yard.And don’t forget vining flowers. If you want something that blooms every yearwith little care required, instead of an annual vine, you might want to plantsomething more permanent like a perennial flower such as clematis, honeysuckle,climbing roses, trumpet vine, or thumbelina. Another good summer vining crop isNew Zealand spinach. If you had long walkways with the vertical frames down eachside, you could build 2-foot-by-any-length boxes and have them on the outsidegiving you plenty of walking room. You could also put them so that 1 foot isinside the path, and 1 foot is outside. I would plant the vine crops on theoutside so they would climb up the netting, and plant flowers along the insidethat will do well in the eventual shade of the pathway—perhaps something likeimpatiens or coleus.PLANTS THAT GROW VERTICALLYImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Seed packets and catalogs often do not indicate whether a variety is a vining orbush type. The seed companies are constantly changing and adding new varieties,and in order to find out the best ones that vine, I would suggest that you call(if they have a toll-free number) or e-mail the various seed companies to findout. Tell them you are doing Square Foot Gardening and want to grow cropsvertically and that you want to know which of their varieties are vines whichneed trellising and support.Image [../images/f0157-01.jpg]PLANTING SEEDS OR TRANSPLANTSRemember, tomatoes are the only vine crop you cannot start as a seed directly inthe garden. They take so long to grow into a sizeable plant that in most caseswe have to grow or buy transplants to put into the garden as soon as the lastfrost of spring is over. The rest of the vine crops can be started from seeddirectly in the garden. The seed planting chart in the Appendix shows when toplant them at the best time, and Chapter 9 [ch09.html#ch09] shows you how tostart the season earlier or extend it later.EASY CLIMBImage [../images/dotline.jpg]One of the particularly desirable points of vertical gardening is that there’svery little maintenance to do for the plants. Aside from watering, it’s a matterof once a week tucking the tops of the plant in through an opening in thenetting, and back through another one, so they keep climbing up the netting.Some of the vertical crops, like pole beans and cucumbers, will do all theclimbing themselves, but tomatoes have to be helped through the openings andpointed to the top. The netting is so strong that it will easily hold up theplant and, in fact, after further studies I found out the netting will also holdup all the fruit, including small watermelons and pumpkins. Some of the wintersquashes got so heavy I was afraid late summer storms would blow over the wholecontraption. It depends on how strong the ground rods are and how tough the soilis. But if your frame is located outside the box and the ground rod is poundedinto your existing soil, it would require bending the rebar, or the electricalconduit, before the frame would come down.TOMATOESImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The most popular home garden vegetable is tomatoes, and when you’re verticalgardening the SFG way, there are a few things you can do to increase youryields.Image [../images/f0158-01.jpg]Nature has already taught some vines to climb. You basically just need to plantthe seeds and watch them go!TOMATOES AND THE SINGLE STEM METHODThe theory behind pruning to one single stem is that all the energy goesstraight up the main stalk, and you will have more tomatoes per square foot thanif you allow it to put energy into branching out. That means you have to cut offthe branches, and the best time to do it is when they’re tiny. Unfortunately,most gardeners don’t. They look so small and cute, and as they grow bigger andbigger, they begin to take on the appearance of a productive plant and itbecomes hard to cut them back.To help convince you to prune off those suckers, remember that the nice thingabout them is once you prune them, you can root them, and they can becomeanother plant for a late crop.No matter how large the sucker or side branch, you can stand it in a glass ofwater and transplant that into the ground as soon as the roots sprout. Or, youcan stick those suckers in a cup of vermiculite, and keep that in a saucer ofwater, and they will also sprout roots. They are great, free plants for a lateharvest for canning, juice, or preserving.“More manageable, enjoyable, and bountiful than I’d ever imagined.”—Manja from OregonGet in the habit of inspecting and pruning your tomato plants once a week to asingle stem, and weave the top in and out of the netting. At the same time,check the overall appearance of the plant to make sure you have no tomato wormsvisiting.LAY TOMATOES DOWNSince a tomato plant can sprout new roots along its main stem, I have found thatthe best way to plant the main crop of tomatoes is to lay them down horizontallyin a shallow trench. They will develop an enormous number of roots, all alongthat hairy stem, which will sustain a larger, more productive plant. Pick yourbest-looking plants, and pinch or cut off the lower leaves (at least two orthree) so you have a tall skinny plant ready to plant in a lay-me-down position.To do this, you first locate the square foot it’s going to be in, take your handor a trowel, and dig out a long shallow trench, perhaps 3 or 4 inches deep inthe middle of the square and as long as your tomato plant is. Make the trenchlong enough so you can lay down the plant with the root ball at one end. Dig alittle deeper for the root ball and then lay the stem on the bottom of thetrench. At the other end where the top is (remember you cut off most of thelower leaves), very, very carefully bend the top so it starts pointing up. Youcan take the Mel’s Mix, and push it underneath that bent top to act as a pillow(see, this is really a bed), and if you’re very gentle, you’ll end up with thetop sticking out of the soil at a slight angle. It does not have to pointstraight up; it just has to be aboveground. Fill in the rest of the trench andwater well.In just a few days that top will straighten itself up, and at the same time allthe new roots will start sprouting out from the main stem. If you noticed theroot system when you put the plant in the ground, depending on what size pot itwas growing in, it probably had a very small rootball, perhaps only 1 or 2inches wide, and 1 or 2 inches long. But now for the average transplant you’regoing to develop a 6- to 8-inch rootball along the entire length. This procedurewill not take any strength from the plant, and it will not delay any of thefirst tomatoes you’re going to harvest from that plant. In fact, because of itsextra root strength and size, it will be a more vigorous grower than before.Image [../images/f0160-01.jpg]Some books may advise you to dig a deep hole, and plant the tomato straight downdeep so just the top leaves show, thus burying the entire stem with the ideathat the roots will still sprout along the stem. This is okay, but that puts theplant quite deep in the ground and usually it’s still springtime and the groundis still fairly cool. So I’ve found the lay-me-down method will make the plantgrow much faster, because the soil at that level is warmer, by perhaps as muchas 10 degrees. After the plant is heading skyward, you treat it the exact sameway as any other tomato transplant. This method of lay-me-down planting alsowill give you more fruit because the first fruiting branch to form along themain stem will be closer to the ground, allowing you more distance to the top ofyour vertical frame to have fruit.Image [../images/f0161-01.jpg]Vines need a little direction from time to time. Gently weave a vine in and outof the trellis netting to help it keep a steady course.TOMATO WORMIf you see some of your tomato leaves are chewed up, you may have the dreadedtomato worm. Look for little black specks (the droppings from the worms), andcheck the surrounding leaves to find them. The worms are camouflaged but stillbrightly colored, large, and beautiful. Usually there are just one or two at themost. (Caution: do not pick it up. Tomato worms emit a very foul smell that willget on your hands and clothes.)Play it safe. Get your scissor and cut off the leaf. Put it in a paper bag, sealand throw it in the garbage. Tomato worms don’t usually harm the tomatoesthemselves, but they take strength from the plant as they eat many of theleaves. If your children are interested in a science project, you might havethem come and look at the tomato horn worm and get their ears as close as theycan. They can actually hear them crunching the leaves. (Be careful, the wormscould jump on your head—no, I’m only kidding!)OVER THE TOPWhat do you do when the tomato plant gets to the top of your tower, and there isstill a lot of growing season left? You have two choice, depending on how manytomatoes you’ve picked so far and how many green ones are coming. You can eithercut the top right off, stop its growth, and allow a good part of the energy togo into the existing tomatoes. Or, you can let the top continue to grow, and letit hang over the side. It will keep growing until the end of the season, whichfor a tomato plant is the first frost. If you want to protect this plant fromthe first frost (and everyone does), the vertical frame is designed so all youhave to do is gently lay a tarp or blanket over it. Next morning take it off,fold it up, and you’re ready until the next threat of frost. This way you cankeep your tomato plants growing and producing for several more weeks.Image [../images/f0162-01.jpg]This vertical garden has bean and tomato plants. They are planted with sage andsquash. Think of the harvest!PRUNING CUCUMBERS, MELONS, AND MOREImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The other vine crops can have their side branches continue to grow until thewhole plant takes up too much space. In general you want the plant to spread outto be approximately 1 to 2 feet wide on the vertical frame netting. If you plantone plant per square foot, it can fill that 12-inch wide square, going right upthe netting. If the spacing for that particular vegetable (for example,cucumbers that are spaced 2 per square foot), you would trim the side branchesback so that each one is from 6 to 9 inches wide outside of its space. Squash isa little different because the leaves are so large that it’s hard to judge wherethe stem is and how much room the entire plant is taking. That’s why we givesquash a lot more room (2 square feet per plant) in the vertical garden.Although most squash plants will grow on one central stalk, some do branch.Those with branches take longer to have fruit, so if you cut them off all theenergy will go to the main branch and the flowers and fruit on that main branch.When it grows to the top, let it hang down until it gets near the bottom, put itthrough the netting, turn it up, and start all over again.All the vining plants are very vigorous, energetic, and sturdy, so there’s notmuch you can do to deter their growth. But whenever you’re bending a stem topoke it through the netting or over the top, hold it with two hands and becareful so it doesn’t break.SAFETY PRECAUTIONSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]If your crops are growing thickly and have covered the 4-foot-wide frames, youmight want to play it safe and put guy wires on the vertical frame when you getnear the end of the season. This requires tying something like fishing line orstrong cord from the top bar down to the south side of the box. For the northside, you could always prop the top up with a 1 × 2-foot board cut out with anotch to fit into the top bar. That would hold the frame up from bothdirections.Image [../images/f0163-01.jpg]COLD-SEASON HANDLING OF A VERTICAL FRAMEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]After the growing season is over, the frame can be removed intact and hung outof the way in the garage to wait for the next growing season. Some people leavetheir vertical frame up all winter, and during the holiday season, weavebrightly colored ribbon or even lights in and out of the netting to decorate forthe holidays!CONCLUSIONImage [../images/dotline.jpg]We have seen how beneficial and easy vertical gardening can be. Not only can yougrow vining crops in less space, but harvesting becomes much easier and cropsdon’t get soft and mushy from resting on the ground.

This means that most gardeners grow vegetables during anaverage of six months out of a possible twelve. When these six months areextended by an additional two months, the growing season is extended by 33percent. A three-month extension provides a 50 percent increase—a worthwhilegoal that can be achieved easily and inexpensively. Gardeners gain a great senseof accomplishment from these increased yields, and modern homesteaders and foodpreservers find it an absolute blessing.Square Foot Gardeners don’t have the negative experiences associated with doingall that hard work when they garden, so they look forward to more gardening andwant to lengthen the growing season. For them, gardening isn’t a test ofendurance. It’s a pleasant experience. They don’t want to know how soon they canquit, but how long they can continue experiencing the joy of gardening!Don’t think you must extend the season to be an accomplished gardener. Sometimesit’s just as good to sit back, relax, and just “go dormant” for a while. Insteadof gardening you could be satisfied and save time and work.It’s your decision. But if you think it’s time to trick nature into feeding youyear-round, then read on! The rest of the chapter will explain what to do eachseason to extend your harvest from cool-weather and warm-weather plants.EXTEND THE HARVEST BY GROWING OUT OF SEASONThe obvious way to extend the garden year is to start earlier than usual andkeep the plants growing later. Cool-weather crops can be grown in two extraplantings for a longer season. The first planting is made in the early springand will mature in the cool weather of late spring. The second crop ofcool-weather plants can be planted in late summer to mature in the late fall.Since early spring and late fall can bring some rather severe weather, growingout of season is simply keeping the cold temperatures away from your plants. Todo this, it’s important to provide these crops with the extra protection theyneed from the elements. By covering and protecting your crops, you are basicallycreating an artificial environment. After all, that is what a greenhouse does—itkeeps the cold air out but lets the sunlight in. What more could a plant want?Image [../images/f0166-01.jpg]If you want to jump-start your garden, try starting your own seeds. But with theSFG, you won’t need all this expensive equipment and you won’t have so manyplants to take care of.In addition, all of the summer or hot-weather crops can be started two to threeweeks earlier than normal and they, too, can be extended up to a month beyondtheir normal season in the fall. Then, an extra planting of lettuce, spinach,and radishes can be grown during the hot summer months that are normallyconsidered out of season for these two crops. Sound like a lot of work? WithSquare Foot Gardening, it’s easier than you think. It all depends on youproviding protection from the sudden and harsh temperatures and weather.BOX WITH CAGESince a Square Foot Garden takes up so little space, it is relatively easy toprotect your crops.While special techniques that provide extra protection may vary with the seasonand the variety of vegetable, they are quickly learned and easily practiced.Chapter 4 [ch04.html#ch04] explains how to build a special box and the variouskinds of protective cages. These structures make it possible to moderate theclimate in that box so you can stretch your growing season at both ends.EARLY SPRINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]A great time to extend the growing season is early spring before anyone else isout gardening. Begin by warming up the soil in your SFG boxes. Spread clear orblack plastic over the top of the soil, and weigh it down with a brick in eachcorner. After a couple of sunny days, take the cover off, lift the grid out, andmix up the soil with a trowel so the warmer surface soil is moved down below andthe colder, deeper soils are raised to the top. Then replace the plastic covers.This is no big deal since your Mel’s Mix is loose and friable at all times ofthe year. Besides, the soil is only 6 inches deep. How much work could that be?Image [../images/f0110-01.jpg]KID’S CORNERSCIENCE PROJECTIf you want to be really scientific, get a thermometer to measure the soiltemperature at the surface, but be sure to cover the thermometer so the sundoesn’t shine directly on it. Also take the temperature of the soil at a depthof 2 inches. Then measure and record the same information in a 4 × 4 that hasbeen covered with black or clear plastic. Use the charts in this book to findhow long it takes seeds to sprout at certain temperatures. Plot all thatinformation, and then use the charts to compare the quicker seed sprouting time.Not only is this a fun project for the kids, it will enable you to get anearlier, more successful start on your garden.JUMP START YOUR SEEDSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]If you want to get a quicker start and earlier growth, try sprouting your seedsindoors, and then transplanting them into individual containers when they arevery young. Before the plants get too large, harden them off before plantingthem outdoors in your spring box.SPRINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]For your first spring planting, set up a spring box with a storm window cover orthe PVC type structure over any garden square where you’ll be planting an earlycrop so the sun will start warming the soil. Do this about four weeks beforeit’s time to plant your seeds. For a double-quick soil warm-up, cover the soilwith clear or black plastic, and then remove it before planting. Or you can useplastic covered cages over individual squares around the garden instead of theentire 4 × 4-foot area. When the weather is warm enough, transplant the plantsyou’ve grown into the open garden squares. They can also be left to grow wherethey were planted by removing the protective cage from the squares.Image [../images/f0168-01.jpg]CLIMATE CONTROLWhen you’re using a spring box on your early crops, remember that fresh air hasto get in and you have to vent out the hot air that builds up on sunny days evenin cold or freezing weather.Heat builds up quickly in the boxes on sunny days. As the weather warms up,slide or lift the cover open a little farther each week until you can remove itentirely. (Don’t try to prop up a glass storm window with sticks; believe me,the wind will blow it down whenever you’re not around.) A light frost won’t hurtmost cool-weather crops, but too much heat will cook them. It takes a littleexperience to learn how to control the heat and moisture inside your frame. Keepin mind these precautions when trying to grow out of season.EXTENDING COOL-WEATHER CROPS INTO SUMMERIn addition to lettuce and radishes, you might also try growing spinach or evencabbage out of season into the early summer. Spring crops can be grown fromseeds or from transplants started indoors a few weeks ahead of time. Whenchoosing varieties of cool-weather crops to grow into summer, look for wordslike “long standing,” “slow to bolt,” and “heat resistant” in the seed catalogsor packet descriptions.Image [../images/f0169-01.jpg]SUMMERImage [../images/dotline.jpg]As the spring season progresses, it’s time to give some summer vegetables—suchas beans, squash, and cucumbers—a head start. For earlier harvests, try startingthe seeds for these warm-weather crops right in their permanent location under aprotective cage two weeks before the usual planting time. They will be muchhardier and stronger than seedlings grown on the windowsill. When all danger offrost is past, remove the covers.There is an entire industry with all kinds of protective devices and products tohelp the gardener be successful in early gardening. They vary from water-filledwalls around the plant to special ground covers designed to heat up the soilquicker. Try some of these products and see what happens. I always like to placean unprotected plant right next to the protected one for comparison.SHADE AND WATERIf you’re the type of person who doesn’t like hot, sticky weather, and youliterally wilt in the sun, then the obvious solution is to move into the shadewith a large pitcher of your favorite cold drink. Well, lettuce and radishes areno different. If you can provide shade for these spring crops (especially duringthe noon sun), along with some extra water, you will be able to harvestthroughout most of the summer. Look for special hot-weather varieties of yourfavorite plants in your seed catalog.Cover the square with a shade cage, and give the plants plenty of water—as ageneral rule, water twice as often as you usually would. Remember, one of thebest aids for growing a good crop is Mel’s Mix—our soil mix that combines equalparts peat moss, coarse vermiculite, and blended compost. It holds lots ofmoisture so the plant roots can take up all that’s needed, yet drains well sothe roots can’t become waterlogged.SHADE SCREENSThe shade cage will admit enough light for proper growth while keeping thetemperature down considerably. A layer of thick mulch will also help moderatesoil temperatures. You can also make use of natural shade or sun screens bylocating a planting of spring crops behind (to the north of) your verticalgrowing frames.Keep in mind that you’re growing out of season, which means it is not theplant’s natural inclination to grow then. You are urging these plants on, so begenerous with your help and attention and don’t expect too much. Just enjoy thechallenge and experience!Image [../images/f0170-01.jpg]SUMMER PLANTS INTO FALLGardeners sometimes wonder whether the extra effort involved in protectingsummer crops from the first fall frost is worth the effort. I think it certainlyis, if you want an extra two or three weeks worth of harvest from all thosewarm-weather crops. Quite often the first frost is followed by a long period ofclear, warm weather before the next frost. If you can protect your garden fromthat first frost, you can enjoy green plants and fresh vegetables during one ofthe most pleasant periods of the year—mid-autumn. Since most of these crops havea six to eight week harvest season, the extra two to three weeks gained amountto quite a bit—more than a 25 percent extension of the season.ALL TOGETHER NOWTo protect your crops from frost, you can start with a PVC arch or covered wagonframe, and then cover it with a large sheet of plastic, floating cover, or lightblanket. Fasten down the corners so it won’t blow off during the night. Or, thelow-growing crops can be readily protected with a loose covering of hay that iseasily removed the next morning.To protect vine crops from frost, just throw a blanket or tarp over the verticalframe so it’s hanging down on all sides. This is one of the prime advantages ofgrowing squash, tomatoes, cucumbers, pole beans, pumpkins, and similar summercrops on a vertical frame.Image [../images/f0171-01.jpg]FALLImage [../images/dotline.jpg]When fall arrives, you and your garden have three options: to store food for thewinter, extend the harvest, or stop your garden. Whichever you choose depends onyour time and desire.EXTENDING THE HARVEST BY STORING ITLet’s look at the easiest and least-known way to extend the harvest—storing it.There’s the old-fashioned but economical canning, preserving, and freezing forthe future, and it has a place. But I think the most economical andenvironmentally correct way to extend the season is to store the harvest. Thereis almost no work and money involved, and the flavor and nutritional value ofeach vegetable is greater than if it was frozen or canned.HANDLE YOUR HARVEST GENTLYImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The only secret of successful storage is actually very simple—learn eachvegetable’s best storage conditions and provide it. There are really only two:cool and dry, or cold and moist. The list of vegetables that need cool and dryconditions is easy to remember because there are only a few—pumpkins, wintersquash, and onions. The temperature should be around 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit(10 to 15.5 degrees Celsius), and the humidity needs to be fairly low—at about50 percent.Try to find a cool corner of your garage or basement where the temperature staysabove 35 but below 60 degrees F (above 1.6 but below 15.5 degrees C). If youthink your storage area might freeze or get too warm at times, you can build twowalls to enclose a corner to provide an even-temperature fruit closet. Add someinsulation, and remember to allow plenty of air circulation. Don’t stack produceup in a big pile, but spread your vegetables out evenly on a shelf (not on thefloor).Image [../images/f0172-01.jpg]Handle produce as gently and infrequently as possible. When you’re outharvesting, treat each vegetable as if it were an egg. Any bruise or cut will bethe first spot to spoil. Lay each harvested vegetable separately in a box ofsawdust or crumpled newspaper; don’t pile them all together. Do not wash orscrub the produce. Leave the bottom of the root on root crops, and at least aninch of the top growth. For crops such as vine crops, leave as much of the stemon as possible. Only store produce that is in really good condition.Vegetables in the group that need cold and moist conditions are all rootcrops—beets, carrots, turnips, white potatoes, and winter radishes plus all ofthe cabbage family. This group also includes fruit—especially apples. The idealstorage temperature for them is as cold as you can get without actuallyfreezing—35 to 45 degrees F (1.6 to 7.2 degrees C).Actually, the simplest way to store root crops is not to dig them up at all.Roll a bale of hay over the planted area; this will break their tops and stopthe plant’s growing cycle while keeping the ground from freezing. When you’reready to harvest, simply roll the bale over, dig up a few vegetables, and thenreplace the bale. Regular radishes won’t hold up too long in freezing weatherwhile the winter radish will last almost indefinitely. Carrots and leeks also doquite well through the entire winter. If you’re feeling adventurous, you canexperiment with leaving different root crops in the ground to see which lastthrough the fall and winter so you’ll know what to expect the following year.COZY COVERCabbage and other leaf and head crops can also be stored in the garden, but theywon’t do well under a solid bale of hay. Instead, it is better to use a loose,fluffy covering of straw or leaves. To keep the wind from blowing this loosecovering around, try placing a 2-foot-high fence of chicken wire around yourgarden areas and anchoring the wiring at each corner with stakes.Image [../images/f0173-01.jpg]DIG IT INImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Another storage method for root crops is to bury a container in the ground andpack your vegetables in layers of moist sawdust, peat moss, or sand. You cansink a plastic or metal garbage can straight into the ground while keeping thetop a few inches above the surface so no water gets in. Make sure the cover fitstightly; then pile at least 12 inches of hay or leaves over the top. Keepeverything dry by covering it with a weighted-down plastic sheet or tarp. Watchout for leaks in the container that can allow groundwater to seep in. If youcan, select an area on high ground to locate the storage container. The groundwill not freeze under or around this container, and your vegetables will bemaintained in a very even and moist condition.TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCESImage [../images/dotline.jpg]On a cold night you can walk around your property and actually feel thedifferences in temperature. The cold air virtually rolls down the slope andsettles in low-lying areas; in fact, this is called cold air drainage.Surprisingly, this will happen even where there is not a great difference inelevation. Once you get the knack of watching out for frost and covering yourplants when it threatens, you will see the advantages of locating a garden onthe top or south side of a slope rather than at the bottom of a low area. Youwill also see the advantage of grouping your crops according to their weatherrequirements. This makes it easier to protect them from either frost or freezingin both the spring and fall. One of the greatest advantages of SFG is how easyit is to protect your garden since it is condensed into small, uniform areas.It’s much simpler and more cost effective to grow cool-weather crops for anextended season using a sun-heated box that protects plants from just the severeweather fluctuations.FROSTFrost forms when the outdoor temperature drops below the freezing point,resulting in the deposit of ice crystals. Plant material will freeze when thereis an accumulation of cold air, 32 degrees Fahrenheit or below (0 degreesCelsius), at ground level. Frost can, and does, occur in low areas while thehills and slopes right next to them might be frost-free. This is because hot airrises and cold air sinks. If a body of water is nearby, it can greatly reducethe occurrence of frost as water holds heat very well.In general, frost usually occurs in the very early morning hours, particularlyafter a still, calm night when the weather is dry. The chances of frost are alsoincreased following the passage of a cold front, indicated by an intermittentand changing weather pattern of broken clouds and occasional precipitation; thisis in contrast to the steady or continuous rain and the heavy, low-hangingclouds that accompany a warm front.When frost is predicted, be ready. Your best bet is to catch the evening weatherforecast, particularly the local one. Another (perhaps better) source is theInternet. One of the best websites is www.weather.com [http://www.weather.com].Click on “Home and Garden,” then “Lawn and Garden” and enter your zip code.You’ll get all the information you need to be ready for that first frost.LIGHT VERSUS HARD FROSTA light frost blackens the outer leaves of most summer flowers and vegetables.It is indicated by a white covering on the lawn in very early morning. Summervegetables can still be harvested if eaten right away.A hard frost will blacken and kill all summer flowers and vegetables. Plantsthat were bushy and colorful the day before are now just droopy skeletons withblackened leaves hanging like rags from the stems. This can be verydisheartening for gardeners who come out in the morning to find that the gardenhas been devastated. A hard frost is indicated by a crunchy feel to the groundand a thin film of ice on the birdbath. This is the time when most gardenersdeclare an end to the season. But if you have planted some colorfulfall-blooming plants (mums, asters, and some hardy daisies) along with the fallvegetables, and you clean up the garden right away, your garden will still lookattractive and inviting after a hard frost. Your spirits will be lifted and youcan go on to enjoy an autumn garden.WINTERGardeners who are particularly ambitious and want to continue growing somethingall winter will need additional tools for providing special protection to a veryselect variety of plants. If you can keep the ground from freezing solid andprovide sunlight in just a small area, in many parts of the country you cancontinue growing special varieties of lettuce and spinach, hardy leaf crops suchas kale, and a number of oriental vegetables all winter long. It’s also possibleto plant some members of the onion family in the fall in order to get a largeror early crop next spring and summer. Call your county extension service forlocal advice and conditions.Image [../images/f0175-01.jpg]As you continue gardening, you’ll learn which vegetables are hardier in yourparticular area. Wind and rain have a lot to do with plant survival and how muchprotection you need to provide.SPECIAL COLD VARIETIESSalad from your garden during the coldest months of winter? You bet. A fall box(that’s just a SFG box that’s used during the fall) can provide fresh salad eachweek during the winter without a greenhouse. Here’s how: select fast-growingvegetables for your winter garden. Try any of the hardy salad greens and rootcrops, but look for special cold-tolerant varieties. Every seed company offersdifferent varieties so look through catalogs and select those that arerecommended for cold and winter growing. Look for names that have words in themlike “Arctic,” “Frost King,” or “Snow Man” (I just made that last one up).PICK A SPOTImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Now, pick the sunniest, most sheltered spot you can find for your winter garden.It doesn’t have to be in the main garden; next to the house or garage is better,especially if you have white painted brick or stucco walls, since they willreflect quite a bit of heat into your miniature garden. Remember that the sun isvery low in the sky during the winter, and the place that may have been in fullsun during the summer could now very well be a very shady place in the winter.Don’t place the box under the roof or gutter line, or you’ll risk the chancethat rain, sleet, or snow will fall on it. You’ll be in good shape if the areais sheltered from strong winter winds and if it gets a maximum amount of wintersunlight. It doesn’t have to be a permanent spot either. First, lay down a sheetof plastic or sturdy weed cloth and in the spring you can pick everything up andreturn the area back to its former use.“Best book on gardening I’ve ever read, wish I’d found it years ago.—Mindy from New JerseySNUGGLE UPInstall your winter box, fill it with Mel’s Mix, and start your planting. Sincethe plants will grow very slowly compared to spring and summer and since you’llbe harvesting every leaf almost as it is ready, you can plant your producecloser than the usual spacing, even as close as one-half the recommendeddistance.INSULATEProvide some insulation around the winter box, by banking the outside with soilor placing bales of hay all around. Provide a tight-fitting cover or make adouble-layer cover with plastic to keep the soil and air from losing heat atnight. Throw a blanket or tarp on the box for those extra cold nights.PUTTING YOUR GARDEN TO BEDImage [../images/dotline.jpg]When it is time to put the SFG to bed, we do this the same way we put ourchildren to bed. You wouldn’t think of sending them to their room and paying noattention to them would you? Instead, we encourage them to prepare forbedtime—to brush their teeth, get one last drink, fix the bed just the way theywant it, and then spend some time reading a bedtime story. Then it’s finallylights out.Well, treat your garden the same way. Don’t leave it a mess with dead plants anddebris lying about. Tidy it up and make it look good. Now is an excellent timeto mix a little extra compost in each box and smooth and level it out so it willbe all ready for the spring planting. That’s never happened before withsingle-row gardening. Now it’s not only possible, but also very practical.The little extra work you do in the fall will keep your garden attractive andneat-looking all winter and make your springtime garden easier to begin. You’llsimply go out, rake off the mulch cover (remember your rototilling neighbor?),and start planting either at the regular time or early.GRIDS IN WINTERYou can remove, clean, fold, and hang up the grids now or leave them on theboxes all winter, which will remind you of how much fun you have now withgardening. What I’m suggesting for the end of the season is really no differentthan what I recommend you do all season long. Keep your garden neat, tidy, andattractive. If you keep it in tip-top condition (and that’s not too difficultwith a no-work garden), you will enjoy it so much more.TAKE NOTESImage [../images/dotline.jpg]The only thing you might want to do is record in a notebook or journal some ofthe highlights of this past year—notes for improvements, special varieties ofplants, and tips for next year.DECORATE FOR THE HOLIDAYSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]You’ll enjoy SFG much more if you keep your garden neat and attractive at alltimes. Since you no longer have to hoe the weeds or dig and cultivate the soil,you’ll have time and energy for the pleasant things like trimming off yellow ordead lower leaves, dead blossoms, removing plants, or dead and pest-damagedleaves or entire plants.But what about winter? Not much work to do after putting the garden to bed, butyou might think about decorating the garden so it still looks nice all winterlong or at least for the holidays.THANKSGIVINGMake a nice arrangement in one or more boxes of a fall scene, like a stack ofcorn with pumpkins. Some of the boxes could just have a bale or two of hay orstraw. Maybe even a scarecrow in a box. Those boxes could be covered with cloth(like white garden floating covers) or old colored sheets tacked or stapleddown.CHRISTMAS OR WINTERHere are some ideas that will make your SFG festive during the bleak wintermonths.1. Make Christmas boxes out of your garden boxes by using old colored or stripedsheets, a tarp or table cloth, or floating garden covers.2. Think ahead when you go to yard sales or the thrift shop. Many covers couldserve double duty as frost covers in the fall, then decorative covers in thewinter.3. Use wide, colorful ribbon, rope, or contrasting colored strips of sheets totie bows on the boxes. Tuck in greens and pine cones, even lights if you can getan extension cord to the garden. (Remember now, your garden no longer needs tobe way out back; it can be right near your back door where you’ll see it moreoften.)4. Decorate your vertical frames with decorative lights, pine branches, pinecones, and bird feeders.After Christmas, stick a discarded Christmas tree in the center of each box, andmake them into bird feeders, with or without lights. Tie a string from each boxcorner to the treetop for support.START SMALLImage [../images/dotline.jpg]This chapter teaches us how to extend all the seasons and how doing that cangive us an extra 50 percent of gardening time. How exciting! If you read throughall this and felt a little discouraged or glazed-over, don’t worry. If you havenever grown out-of-season, add just a few features here and there as you gainmore confidence. It can be a really fun challenge to any gardener—regardless ofexperience. As with all new gardening projects, my recommendation is to startsmall in order to gain experience, confidence, and pleasure—then expand. Andjust in case you need more convincing, remember that All New Square FootGardening eliminates so many gardening tasks so you have the time and energy toextend the seasons.Image [../images/t0178-01.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0179-01.jpg]NO YARDImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Sometimes a property may have limited space for a garden. If you’re in ano-property situation, think creatively and closer to your front or back door.For instance, patios, decks, and balconies always have room for a small garden.A corner of a patio or balcony could contain several 2 × 2-foot boxes. Thesecould be stacked up creatively at different heights to form a very attractivecorner garden that would use less space than a 4 × 4-foot area. The boxes couldbe placed on low tables of different heights or on something like milk crates orcinder blocks in order to give each one a different height. If you install avertical frame with netting along both walls or just tack the netting to thewalls, it could fan out so it gets larger as it gets higher to expand the gardenarea even larger. Another option, of course, is at the base of and even on topof a balcony or deck railing. You could install 6- to 12-inch wide boxes on thefloor or bolted to the top of or hanging from the railing on both sides. Thiswould create almost a wall of gardens ending up in quite a few available squarefeet.WOODED YARDImage [../images/dotline.jpg]If you have a heavily wooded yard, then you don’t have too many choices. Onesolution is to locate several boxes around the house wherever they might receiveenough sunlight. Your boxes could be on the ground or even on legs next to thehouse. If you had a southern exposure with enough sunlight, you could put adouble-decker long box against the house. Other than that, the only choice wouldbe to make a clearing in the woods, but that would have to be a fairlysubstantial area to get your SFG boxes out of the shade. If these suggestionsdon’t work—it’s shade gardening for you.HILLSIDESImage [../images/dotline.jpg]What if the only space you have for a garden is on a hillside or fairly steepslope?Image [../images/f0180-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0180-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0180-03.jpg]Some easy-to-grow annuals include marigold, sunflower, and zinnia.If it’s facing south, it may be worthwhile to develop it for your All New SquareFoot Garden. The limiting factors are how steep the slope is and how big yourgarden is going to be. You’re in luck with a SFG because you can build boxesthat will fit into the lay of the land.Basically, in order to have a level garden so your soil and water don’t run off,you’re going to cut a path into the hillside wide enough to make a garden area.If you want a 4-foot-wide bed, you will have to reach in from both sides andthat can be too much of a stretch from the uphill side. However, with a 3-footwide box, which will be higher than the downhill aisle, you will be able toreach in the full 3 feet from the downhill side because you are standing uprather than kneeling down next to the box.To get a 3-foot wide level spot, you just cut into the hill and move the soildownhill to form the 3-foot wide areas.Think ahead about water availability, time, and the cost to dig and then level apathway wide enough to hold both you and your garden. The steeper the slope, theharder it becomes.“It’s such a positive thing you’re doing, helping people around the world togrow their own food.”—Regan from the USADECKSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]When creating deck gardens in an apartment or condominium, be sure to considerthe people below you and how you’re going to water. Your garden may not be aproblem when it rains, but when it is sunny and bright and your garden waterdrips down on the neighbors while they are at their barbeque below, they may notlook favorably upon you or your garden.There are several things you can do about this situation. First of all, sinceMel’s Mix holds water so well, it’s highly unlikely you will overwater, whichwill prevent a lot of dripping or excess water leakage. Just in case, though,you can always choose not to drill drain holes at consistent intervals over theentire bottom of your SFG, but only a couple in one corner. Then, slightly slopethe box towards this one corner and put a decorative vase or other containerunderneath to catch any drips that may leak out.RAILINGSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Another popular location for a garden is on a railing—particularly on a woodenrailing. Railing boxes make a very decorative and excellent garden, particularlyif you include trailing plants that add some color and character. If you haverailings that are flat, it is very easy to set a box right on top of it. Forstability, it should be bolted down. If you can’t bolt your boxes to the railingand you’re higher than the first floor, I would place the boxes on the floor.Consider the strength and size of your railing and the surrounding environmentto make sure your railing boxes aren’t too big. There are various holders soldat home improvement stores that snap onto your railings and can accommodatestandard-sized boxes. These boxes can hang over the outside or inside of yourrailing, depending on your preference. One advantage of having the box hang overthe outside edge is the box won’t take up any of your valuable deck space. Inaddition, should it drip when you’re watering, the water will bypass the deckbelow. There is one safety concern and that is anything falling. If your box ison the inside of the railing, it doesn’t have far to fall and won’t hurt anyone.GRANDPARENTSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]One of the greatest bonds that I have found between grandparents andgrandchildren is formed during a gardening project, even if the visit is short.Give your grandchild a garden or just a square, let him write his name on thegrid, encourage her to plant her garden, and you may find your grandchildrenwill keep in touch more often just to find out how the garden is growing. This,of course, can work just the opposite way when the grandparent visits thechild’s home and they plant a garden there. And, of course, there will be greatanticipation for the next visit and what has happened in the garden. Selectingplants for children is quite simple; plants should be easy to grow, fast growingfor quick results, and something that will produce an exciting result.GARDENING FOR SENIORSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Some people find it difficult to do hard, manual labor like digging up theexisting soil, as well as getting down on the ground and then getting back upagain. With SFG, the simple answer is to just raise the garden up to thegardener’s height. It can be a sit-down garden, which is particularly adaptablefor a person in a wheelchair or someone that wants to sit and garden. A littlehigher would be a stand-up garden if that makes it easier to tend; since thereis very little maintenance—just nurturing—you are not standing for long periodsof time. And the gardens, once they have a plywood bottom installed, can bemoved to any location for the convenience and pleasure of the gardener.You can now put various sizes of boxes on patios, near the pool, the back door,or any pleasant area around the house that is easy for a senior to attend totheir garden. Of course, there is no longer the need to walk way out backcarrying a bunch of heavy-duty tools. Now, it is just a matter of going to yourgarden and tending it with the minimal amount of effort, work, and tools. Thereis no weeding, and because we are starting with a perfect soil mix, there isnever any heavy digging. There is no need to even have shovels or forks or anylarge tools, just one trowel.Image [../images/f0183-01.jpg]Wheelchair, sitdown, or standup gardening is now a real possibility. The bestsupport for a tabletop garden is a strong table with four legs, givingall-around access. The less desirable method is the use of sawhorses, which maybe sturdy, but limit the access. The least desirable method is a table with justa center support, which could be unstable.Sometimes seniors enjoy out-of-season gardening because they have the time totend their gardens during the tricky, out-of-season weather. This also gets themmoving about out of doors more often, which is another asset.SPECIAL NEEDS GARDENINGImage [../images/dotline.jpg]SFGs have gone a lot of places over the years. They’ve been placed on wheels; weknow of a veteran’s hospital where a SFG was built on a gurney and wheeled fromthe roof down the service elevator so it could be taken to bedridden patients.The SFG Foundation has taught the blind; I designed a SFG for the Helen KellerInstitute on Long Island where blind students learned gardening. We have alsotaught at the school for the deaf in Salt Lake City, Utah. Other worthwhileplaces we have installed SFGs are in prisons and troubled youth facilities.Building a small portable garden (in sizes from 2 ×2 up to 4 ×4 with a plywoodbottom added) allows people to participate who otherwise might not have beenable to garden.Image [../images/f0184-01.jpg]GARDENING IN SCHOOLSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]One thing I’ve learned from teaching SFG over the last thirty years is that kidslove to garden. They are so excited about growing plants. From the beginning, itwas obvious that SFG is perfect for teaching arithmetic and all kinds of mathand, that in fact, anything in the scientific field is easily taught usinggardening as the vehicle. But then I began to see that a teacher could readilyrelate all subjects to gardening.One of the best examples of this is a teacher in California named Sandy. Sheteaches every subject in the classroom through the class’s Square Foot Gardens.One year, the final project was to have each student write me a letter tellingme about their garden. They each described what they liked best and then drew apicture illustrating it. They were learning penmanship, spelling, pronunciation,letter writing, and the ability to describe observations and feelings. Duringthe year, Sandy covered many aspects of science and art, as well as economics,history, language, communication, and the environmental issues. The classproduced a play and video about SFG and invited parents and the rest of theschool to come learn with them. This, of course, gave Sandy the opportunity toteach play writing, acting, stage presence, costume design and making,advertising, publicity, promotion, and so much more. A side benefit is that, inaddition to school subjects, the children learned the important values ofsharing, nurturing, and responsibility.We have worked with all age groups from preschool through high school usinggardening as a teaching tool. Suddenly learning begins to have some type ofmeaning in their lives, and they can begin to see the value of the subjects theyhave been learning in the past.A SQUARE YARD IN THE SCHOOL YARDThe only change in SFG for children is that we make the box a little smallerbecause they can’t reach in as far. Instead they garden in a 3 ×3-foot box,which equals a square yard. As I mentioned before, this is how we got the namefor our school program, “A Square Yard in the School Yard.” We have thedescription and photos of many school programs on our website on the SchoolGardening page.A plan needs to be made on what to do with the gardens during the summervacation period. There are lots of solutions—all you need to do is brainstormwith the students, and the brainstorming itself becomes another learningexperience!COMMUNITY GARDENSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]With SFG, it is possible to have pocket gardens anywhere in the community, evenright in a city. It doesn’t take an entire empty lot now, and it doesn’t have tobe a huge project to convert space into a community garden. It is now possibleto take just a corner of that lot or any other small space—perhaps even in anexisting city park—and have a very small community Square Foot Garden. Eachperson can have from one 4 ×4-foot box up to an area of perhaps 12×12, whichwould enable them to have four or more boxes. One of the best things about usingSFG in a community garden is that since there are no weeds, the garden doesn’tbecome an overrun eyesore by the middle of the summer. This means it is mucheasier to operate and get public and official approval. If you want to start acommunity garden, I would emphasize the need again to start small, gainexperience, become successful, and then expand during the second season or year.Community gardens do require a set of guidelines for what participants can andcannot grow so they don’t interfere with their neighbor’s garden; the guidelinesshould also cover the hours of operation, use of water, and maintenance of thegardens so they look neat and attractive. The use of pesticides and fertilizerwas always a big concern with community gardens, but that issue can be totallyeliminated with SFG.“Your method is awesome. My 3-year-old and I have a blast with two 4 × 6 boxes.”—Rich from North CarolinaIn the layout of the garden, it would be nice to have several tables wherepeople in wheelchairs could wheel right up to their assigned garden plot. Also,several benches and some shade are always a good feature.GROUP PROJECTSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]A SFG could be a demonstration project for many different groups, includingchildren’s gardens, scouts, 4-H’ers, Master Gardeners, botanical gardens, andgarden clubs. A group could create a salad garden with all the fixings—lettuce,tomatoes, root crops, and edible flowers. Each square would have a nice signstating what is there and how it is used in a salad. Another idea would be anherb display with signs and an invitation to touch the plants.The nice part about the idea of using a SFG is it requires so little maintenanceyet produces such a spectacular showcase. It is an easy way of attracting newmembers or of putting on a demonstration at a function. Another nice thing aboutit is, at the end of a fair or show, four people can pick up the garden, put itinto a van, and take it home. In that situation, you can even include ashortened vertical frame so that it would still fit in the vehicle and yet wouldadd a third dimension to your display.HUMANITARIAN PROJECTSImage [../images/dotline.jpg]For some, gardening is an enjoyable hobby, but for many it can mean thedifference between life and death. One step up from starving—the worst conditionin the world—is poverty and continual hunger—and that’s where SFG comes in. Wecan help solve the hunger situation. We have a billion people who need help, andthe solution is to teach them how to help themselves. They need to be shown howand then helped to start just one Square Meter Garden of their own; the restwill follow. We teach them to use straight compost in their gardens because ofthe lack of peat moss and vermiculite in many of these areas of the world; theycan create compost for free, while improving their environment. We believe that,instead of our governments and humanitarian organizations sending food, theyshould start educational programs that teach people how to compost and how tocreate a SFG garden. It would cost less, produce more, allow people to becomeself-sufficient, take very little effort, and yet deliver worthwhile results.That is why the SFG Foundation is so intent on taking Square Foot Gardeningworldwide with its international counterpart Square Meter Gardening. We feel itcan truly make a difference in the everyday lives of so many millions of people.ON MY SOAPBOXWell, here I am, on my soapbox trying to solve worldwide problems when you justwant to learn how to have a better garden in your yard. But what this book isall about is how SFG can reach and help so many more people.That’s the significant and imperative message I want to bring to the world. Willyou help me? You can—by encouraging others to start a SFG. Get involved in yourcommunity or stretch your involvement to the entire world. Anyone, anywhere inthe world can now have a small square meter garden right at their back door. Thenutritional value of the children’s diet will improve dramatically andstep-by-step, and as they expand their garden, that family will be closer toself-sufficiency and independence from government and private aid programs. Youknow the saying, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man tofish and you feed him for a lifetime.” The world hunger problem can never besolved until we help people help themselves, step-by-step, square-by-square.Then, maybe the saying will be, “Show a family how to Square Meter Garden, andthey will feed themselves forever.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0188-01.jpg]Basil and Beyond [appendix.html#app1]At A Glance Vegetables [appendix.html#app2]At A Glance Herbs & Flowers [appendix.html#app3]Plant Profiles [appendix.html#app4]Mel’s Final Summary [appendix.html#app5]Planting Charts [appendix.html#app6]Glossary [glossary.html#glossary]Planting Grids [grid.html#grid]Mel’s Mailbox [mail.html#mailbox]Index [index.html#index]Meet Mel Bartholomew [bm01.html#bm01]Image [../images/f0189-01.jpg]Although we associate basil with Italian cooking, it is an important ingredientin Asian cuisine too. ‘Siam Queen’ is a spicy Thai basil with an intense flavorand fragrance. ‘Holy Basil’ is a sacred herb in India where it is used inreligious ceremonies and planted around Hindu temples. Introduced to Europe inthe sixteenth century as a culinary and medicinal herb, it made its way toEngland and America in the mid-seventeenth century.Basil is used as the perfect complement to summer tomatoes. For a summertimetreat, combine tomatoes, basil, garlic, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar in afood processor, spread on crusty bread, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.Six plants of ‘Sweet Genovese’ will yield enough leaves to make pesto all yearwithout overdosing on it. A mixture of basil, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and oliveoil, pesto is a treat with a distinctive Italian flavor. Try making pesto breadinstead of garlic bread, or use pesto as an imaginative sandwich spread.2 cups basil leaves2 cloves garlic1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese2 tbsp. Romano cheese1/4 cup pine nuts or walnutsdash of salt1/2 cup olive oilwaterCombine basil, garlic, cheeses, nuts, and salt in a food processor or blender.With the machine running, slowly add olive oil. Thin with a few drops of wateruntil it reaches the consistency of oatmeal—not too thick but not runny. Letstand 5 minutes before serving. Toss with cooked pasta; gemelli and penne holdthe pesto nicely.For a creamier taste and consistency, add 3 tablespoons of whole milk ricottacheese. For a color and taste sensation, add 1/3 cup of sun-dried tomatoes.To freeze basil for pesto, wash and dry 2 cups of leaves (a salad spinner workswell), and chop them in a small food processor with 1/4 cup olive oil. Scrapethe mixture onto plastic wrap, fold it up, and put the resulting patty in thefreezer. To use, defrost the patty, and put it in the food processor with allthe other ingredients. Just remember that there is already 1/4 cup of olive oilin the patty, so be sure to only use an additional 1/4 cup to make up the 1/2cup called for in the recipe. Stock up during the peak growing season, and usethem all year long in the recipe above. Freezing basil in this way does nonoticeable harm to the color or flavor, so you can have the taste of an Italiansummer all year round.When planting basil close to tomatoes and peppers, it is thought they will allgrow stronger and more flavorful, and the basil will prevent some of the insectsand diseases associated with tomatoes. A layer of basil leaves over a bowl oftomatoes will repel fruit flies.‘Spicy Globe’ dwarf basil is a beautiful plant. It grows in adorable littleballs perfect for a front-of-the-border accent, with the added attraction ofhaving small leaves that are the perfect size for adding to herbed butters orvinegars. Although cinnamon and licorice basil have a delicious scent, they arean acquired taste for some people. The flavor of lemon basil, on the other hand,is an irresistible mixture of sweet and citrus that complements the lighterfoods of summer. Try it in place of parsley when cooking rice or chicken. Ormake a light, sweet pesto with lemon basil, olive oil, lemon juice, and Parmesancheese to top summer tomatoes, bread, or pasta. ‘Sweet Dani,’ an All-AmericaSelections winner in 1998, is as pretty as it is tasty.Regardless of what you call it or what your heritage may be, if you are going togrow one herb this summer, basil is the one to choose. And if you really mustgrow only one variety of basil, make it ‘Sweet Genovese.’GROWING AND CARING FOR BASILImage [../images/dotline.jpg]Start basil from seed outdoors after the last spring frost (basil needs warmnights), or indoors about 4 to 6 weeks before. Or choose plants at your localgarden center, but keep them sheltered until that last frost. Once hot weathersets in, basil plants will grow quickly, but they won’t amount to much if theyget chilled early in the season. Basil plants will turn black and die at theslightest hint of frost.Sow seeds or set transplants in your SFG or a window box in full sun and keepwell watered throughout the growing season. Pinch off flower buds to save theplant’s energy for leaf growth. Also pinch out growing tips to keep the plantsbushy.To harvest basil, cut whole stems just above a pair of lower leaves. The plantwill grow new stems from that point. Only the leaves are used in fresh or frozenrecipes; the stems go to the mulch pile.To dry basil, hang entire stems upside down out of direct sunlight. Remove thedried leaves from the stems and store in an airtight container. Crush driedleaves into your favorite sauces for a subtle basil flavor.Now let’s talk about some other plants.AT A GLANCEVEGETABLESName Asparagus Family Lily Height 4-6 feet Spacing per square foot 1 or 4Growing season spring, summer Weeks from seed to harvest 3 years Years you canstore seed 3 Name Bean, Bush Family Pulse Height 12-18 inches Spacing per square foot 9Growing season summer Weeks from seed to harvest 8 Years you can store seed 3-4 Name Bean, Pole Family Pulse Height 4-7 feet Spacing per square foot 8 Growingseason summer Weeks from seed to harvest 10 Years you can store seed 3-4 Name Beet Family Goosefoot Height 12 inches Spacing per square foot large - 9small - 16 Growing season spring, summer, fall Weeks from seed to harvest 8Years you can store seed 4-5 Name Broccoli Family Mustard Height 18-24 inches Spacing per square foot 1Growing season spring, fall Weeks from seed to harvest 16 Years you can storeseed 5-6 Name Cabbage Family Mustard Height 12-18 inches Spacing per square foot 1Growing season spring, fall Weeks from seed to harvest 16 Years you can storeseed 5-6 Name Carrot Family Carrot Height 12 inches Spacing per square foot 16 Growingseason spring, summer, fall, winter* Weeks from seed to harvest 10 Years you canstore seed 3-4 Name Cauliflower Family Mustard Height 18-24 inches Spacing per square foot 1Growing season spring, fall Weeks from seed to harvest 14 Years you can storeseed 5-6 Name Chard, Swiss Family Goosefoot Height 12-18 inches Spacing per square foot 4Growing season spring, summer, fall, winter* Weeks from seed to harvest 8 Yearsyou can store seed 4-5 Name Corn Family Grass Height 5-6 feet Spacing per square foot 4 Growing seasonsummer Weeks from seed to harvest 9-13 Years you can store seed 1-2 Name Cucumber Family Gourd Height vine Spacing per square foot 2 Growing seasonsummer Weeks from seed to harvest 9 Years you can store seed 5-65 Name Eggplant Family Nightshade Height 24-30 inches Spacing per square foot 1Growing season summer Weeks from seed to harvest 19 Years you can store seed 5-6 Name Lettuce Family Composite Height 6-12 inches Spacing per square foot 4Growing season spring, summer*, fall, winter* Weeks from seed to harvest 7 Yearsyou can store seed 5-6 Name Melon Family Gourd Height vine Spacing per square foot 1 per 2 sq. ft.Growing season summer Weeks from seed to harvest 12 Years you can store seed 5-6 Name Okra Family Lily Height 18-24 inches Spacing per square foot 1 Growingseason summer Weeks from seed to harvest 12 Years you can store seed 2 Name Onion Family Lily Height 12 inches Spacing per square foot 16 Growingseason spring, summer Weeks from seed to harvest 20 Years you can store seed 1-2 Name Parsley Family Carrot Height 6-12 inches Spacing per square foot 4 Growingseason spring, summer, fall, winter* Weeks from seed to harvest 14 Years you canstore seed 2-3 Name Pea, Sugar Snap Family Pulse Height vine Spacing per square foot 8 Growingseason spring, fall Weeks from seed to harvest 10 Years you can store seed 3-4 Name Pepper Family Nightshade Height 12-24 inches Spacing per square foot 1Growing season summer Weeks from seed to harvest 19 Years you can store seed 4-5 Name Potato Family Nightshade Height 12-24 inches Spacing per square foot 4Growing season spring, summer, fall Weeks from seed to harvest 12 Years you canstore seed Plant last year’s potatoes Name Radish Family Mustard Height 6-12 inches Spacing per square foot 16 Growingseason spring, summer*, fall Weeks from seed to harvest 4 Years you can storeseed 5-6 Name Spinach Family Goosefoot Height 6-12 inches Spacing per square foot 9Growing season spring, fall, winter* Weeks from seed to harvest 7 Years you canstore seed 5-6 Name Strawberry Family Rose Height 6-12 inches Spacing per square foot 4 Growingseason spring, fall Weeks from seed to harvest perennial Years you can storeseed Use plants Name Summer Squash Family Gourd Height bush, vine Spacing per square foot 1 per9 sq. ft., 1 per 2 sq. ft.

Because it is aperennial and takes a couple of years before the first harvest, producing onlyone crop a year, we suggest you plant an entire 4' × 4' box only in asparagus.The plants get very bushy throughout the summer and need quite a bit of room tospread out so leave good aisle space around it. When you invest in an asparagusplant, consider the location very carefully, as it can last for up to 20 years.STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: 10 to 12 weeks before last spring frost. Soak seeds overnight andplant at least 1/2 inch deep.Transplanting: 2 to 4 weeks before last spring frost.Seeds Outdoors: 2 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost, plant seeds that havebeen soaked in water overnight in a hole between 1/2 and 1 inch deep.Traditionally, you buy and plant 2-year-old roots, one per square foot. But I’vefound that if you can afford to buy enough of the roots, four per square footwill produce a much bigger crop earlier.The conventional way of planting asparagus is to put about 3 inches of yourMel’s Mix down, mark your spacing (either the one or four per square foot), makelittle mounds at the plant location, and then drape the roots (purchased at thenursery or through mail order) over each one of those little mounds. Then pourin the rest of the Mel’s Mix (about 3 more inches, to total 6 inches deep),which covers the roots an inch or two.If you have lots of time but little money, raise your own transplants from seed.It takes an extra year or two, but costs peanuts.GROWINGWatering: Weekly, more in the summer.Maintenance: Cut the foliage to the ground in fall as it turns yellow and beforethe berries ripen. Asparagus self-sows readily, often with less than perfectresults.HARVESTINGHow: Cut the largest asparagus shoots at the surface of the soil with a sharpserrated knife, making a slanting cut.When: Harvest asparagus in late spring, when the shoots are 4 to 6 inches tall,for about 6 weeks. Spears taller than 6 inches can be tough. Harvest from matureplants only: don’t harvest from first-year plants, and only sparingly, say oneor two shoots per plant, the second year. Three-year-old plants are consideredmature.PREPARING AND USINGAsparagus is best used as fresh as possible, but it can be stored for a coupleof days in the refrigerator, standing on end on a wet pad or in a jar of coldwater. Asparagus can be eaten raw, steamed, boiled, grilled, roasted, or cookedin casseroles and salads. Tall narrow asparagus kettles are designed to cook thespears upright, immersing the stems while the tender heads steam. Cook asparagusbriefly as it can become mushy if overcooked.PROBLEMSSlugs, asparagus beetle, rust, Fusarium root rot.HINTS AND TIPSAfter the spring harvest, the remaining shoots grow into a large, lacy plant inthe garden, and the fronds are lovely to use as filler in flower bouquets.Male plants are the most desirable as they are the most productive and do notset seed.BEANImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0195-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: PulseHeight:Bush: 12 to 18 inchesPole: 4 to 7 feetSpacing:Bush: 9 per squarePole: 8 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: noSummer: yesFall: noWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower:Bush: 8 weeksPole: 10 weeksSeeds Storage: 3 to 4 yearsWeeks to Maturity:Bush: 8 weeksPole: 9 weeksIndoor Seed Starting: noEarliest Outdoor Planting:immediately after the lastspring frostAdditional Plantings: every 2 weeksDESCRIPTIONProlific and easy to grow, beans—whether of the bush or pole variety—are aterrific crop for any garden. A lot of gardeners think that pole beans havebetter flavor, while the bush types taste more like “green beans.” Bush beansgrow lower to the ground; each plant yields one large crop all at once, with asmaller crop a few weeks later. Pole beans, which are grown on a vertical frame,take longer to grow, but provide a steady continuous yield all season long. Asingle planting of pole types is adequate, while additional plantings of thebush types are needed to have a constant harvest.STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: No.Transplanting: Does not transplant well.Seeds Outdoors: Presoak seeds thirty minutes for faster sprouting. Water soiland cover square with a chicken-wire cage to keep out birds. Seeds sprout in 5to 10 days; remove cage after two weeks. For a continuous harvest of bush beans,plant a new square of a different color or variety every 2 weeks all summerlong.GROWINGWatering: Beans must have regular waterings. Do not allow the soil to dry out,but keep the leaves dry.Maintenance: Weed weekly if you see any weeds sprouting.HARVESTINGHow: Break or cut each stem holding the bean pod (there’s no harm done if thebean breaks and part of the pod stays on the vine). Do not pull on the plantwhen harvesting.When: Pick beans when they are still small and tender. Do not allow them to getso large that pods bulge with seeds; the plant will stop producing and the bestflavor is past.PREPARING AND USINGWash and refrigerate if not using immediately. Beans do not store well, so tryto use them the same day they are picked. In the old days, beans were calledstring beans and the string had to be pulled off before cooking. Newervarieties—called snap beans—only form strings if you let them get too tough andlarge. Beans contain lots of vitamins A, B, and C, as well as calcium and iron.There are probably as many ways to prepare and serve beans as there arevarieties in the seed catalogs. Beans are good eaten raw when they aresmall—remember, the smaller the bean, the more tender it will be. Raw beans canbe served whole with a dip or cut into pieces for addition to a salad.Cook any size bean. They can be steamed, boiled, or stir-fried, then servedindividually with a little seasoning, grated cheese, or parsley. Beans areexcellent additions to soups, stews, or mixed vegetable dishes. Leftovers areeasily marinated for addition to a salad or use as a relish; I’ve even heard ofpeople adding marinated beans to a sandwich, along with lettuce, tomato, andcheese! How does that sound?PROBLEMSAphids, Japanese and Mexican bean beetles, birds, rabbits, woodchucks, and deer;blight, rust and mildew. Sounds like a lot but they are still worthwhile.HINTS AND TIPSIf your square of bush beans gets floppy and starts spreading over adjacentsquares, just run a string around them as a group to keep them in their square.It won’t harm the harvest.BEETImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0197-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: GoosefootHeight: 12 inchesSpacing: 9 or 16 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: yesSummer: yesFall: yesWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 8 weeksSeeds Storage: 4 to 5 yearsWeeks to Maturity: 8 weeksEarliest Outdoor Planting: 3 weeks before last spring frostAdditional Plantings: every 3 weeksDESCRIPTIONBeets are a wonderful vegetable to grow because they’re easy and both the rootsand the greens (tops) are suitable for eating. They are mostly pest- anddisease-free and resistant to both fall and spring frosts. The root gets veryhard when grown in the hot summer season.STARTINGLocation: Partial shade or full sun.Seeds Indoors: No.Transplanting: Does not transplant well.Seeds Outdoors: Each seed in the packet is actually a cluster of two to fiveindividual seeds, so several sprouts will come up from each seed planted. Plantone presoaked seed in each space 1/2 inch deep three weeks before the lastspring frost. To have a continuous harvest, plant a new square every three weeksexcept in the hottest part of the summer. After the sprouts are about 1 inchtall, cut off all except the strongest plant from each seed cluster.GROWINGWatering: Plants need constant and even moisture.Maintenance: Keep damaged leaves picked off, mulch in hot weather, and weedweekly.HARVESTINGHow: Pull up the entire plant with the largest top. If you’re not sure of bulbsize, dig around the root with your fingers to uncover the top to check thesize. To harvest greens, individual leaves can be cut at any time, but don’ttake more than one or two from each plant.When: Roots are the most tender when half size, so start pulling when the rootsare approximately the size of a Ping-Pong ball and continue until they are fullsize. Leaves are usable at any size.PREPARING AND USINGUse greens whole or chopped in fresh salads, or cook them like spinach. Rootsare rich in iron and vitamin B. Serve hot—boiled or steamed. Marinate leftoversfor a salad or relish. Try sautéing shredded raw beets quickly and serve hot, ortry them cooked and chilled (shredded, sliced, or diced) in salads or mixed withcottage cheese. Small whole beets can also be cooked and served with an orangesauce, salad dressing, or a spoonful of sour cream.PROBLEMSCutworms, slugs and snails, leaf miners, rabbits, woodchucks, and deer.Relatively disease-free.HINTS AND TIPSTry a square each of several varieties for different tastes, texture, andcolors.BROCCOLIImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0198-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: MustardHeight: 18 to 24 inchesSpacing: 1 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: yesSummer: noFall: yesWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 16 weeksSeeds Storage: 5 to 6 yearsWeeks to Maturity: 9 weeksIndoor Seed Starting: 12 weeks before last spring frostEarliest Outdoor Planting: 5 weeks before last spring frostDESCRIPTIONBroccoli requires cool weather but is great in a Square Foot Garden. It is veryfrost hardy and grows well in the spring and fall; it doesn’t do well in thesummer heat.STARTINGLocation: Needs full sun.Seeds Indoors: Plant 5 to 10 seeds in a cup of vermiculite, or place one seed1/4 inch deep in potting soil in each individual compartment of a seedling tray,approximately 12 weeks before your last spring frost. Seed will sprout indoorsin 5 to 10 days at 70°F. Keep seed warm (70°F) until sprouted; move to fullsunlight as soon as the first shoots appear.Transplanting: Plant outside approximately five weeks before the last springfrost.Seeds Outdoors: Not satisfactory, as the season is too short before hot weatherarrives.GROWINGWatering: Like all members of the cabbage family, you’re growing leaves andflowers, which need consistent moisture. Never let broccoli dry out or wilt.Maintenance: Weed weekly; mulch in warmer weather.HARVESTINGHow: Cut off the main central head at its base with a sharp, serrated knife orclippers, leaving as many leaves on the plant as possible. Within a few weeks,new side-shoots (miniature heads) will form and grow from the original plant toprovide you with a second harvest.When: Harvest as soon as a head appears full and tight. The head is actually aflower head, which you want to harvest before the flower buds open. If you haveseveral plants, don’t wait too long to cut the first one after the heads startforming, even if it looks a little small. It’s still edible when it’s small.PREPARING AND USINGBroccoli contains vitamins A, B, and C, as well as calcium, phosphorus, andiron. Wash under running water and soak in cold salted water for two hours ifthere’s any chance that a green cabbage worm is present in the head. Refrigerateif you’re not using immediately. Broccoli can be served fresh and raw withmayonnaise, or any dip, or can be chopped fresh into a salad. To cook it, youcan steam, boil, or stir-fry. Try it plain with just a little dressing, sourcream, or topped with a cheese sauce. Cooked leftovers can be marinated foraddition to salads or relishes. It’s an excellent addition to any stir-frieddish; mix it with interesting combinations of meats and vegetables.PROBLEMSCutworms, root maggots, green worms, and cabbage worms; club root.HINTS AND TIPSAfter you cut the main stalk, don’t remove the plant, as new smaller heads willform for a second harvest. Some claim the smaller side-shoots are even moreflavorful than the central head.CABBAGEImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0200-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: MustardHeight: 12 to 18 inchesSpacing: 1 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: yesSummer: noFall: yesWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 16 weeksSeeds Storage: 5 to 6 yearsWeeks to Maturity: 9 weeksIndoor Seed Starting: 12 weeks before last spring frostEarliest Outdoor Planting: 5 weeks before last spring frostDESCRIPTIONCabbage is a very easy vegetable to grow: it’s frost hardy and takes very littlework. Cabbage comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and leaf textures,and can be grown as an early- to late-season crop; the early-season variety issmaller and faster growing, while the late- or long-season variety is usuallybigger. All varieties grow best in cool spring or fall weather.STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: Plant one seed 1/4 inch deep in potting soil in individualcompartments of a seedling tray 12 weeks before your last spring frost. Seedssprout in 5 to 8 days at 70°F. For a second crop in the fall, repeat the processanytime in the middle of June (or back up 16 weeks from your first fall frostdate). In most places you can usually start seeds of a new crop as soon asyou’ve harvested your spring crop. Keep warm (70°F) until sprouted; move to fullsunlight as soon as first shoots appear.Transplanting: Don’t let transplants get too large before planting them outside.Late transplants do not form good heads, and sometimes flower the first year ifallowed to get too large.Seeds Outdoors: The season is too short to plant seeds directly in the gardenfor the spring crop, and starting the fall crop from seed outdoors would tie uptoo much valuable garden space that could be used more productively. Start allseeds in individual containers for transplanting into the garden.GROWINGWatering: Cabbage needs lots of water to head up properly, but after the head isformed and while it is growing to full size, cut back on watering or the headwill grow too fast and split.Maintenance: Weed weekly; cut away any extra-large bottom leaves if they areyellow. If large lower leaves are spreading to other squares, cut away anyportions that are “over the line.” This will not hurt the plant.HARVESTINGHow: Cut off the entire head with a sharp, serrated knife or clippers.When: Anytime the head starts to develop and feels firm. If you have severalplants, don’t wait until all the heads are large. They may split in hot weatherand go to seed, and you’ll be left with nothing.PREPARING AND USINGCabbage is delicious cooked or raw and contains a lot of vitamin C.PROBLEMSSlugs and snails, aphids, and cabbage worms (their worst enemy).HINTS AND TIPSCover cabbages with a bonnet of insect netting or floating cover to keep out thecabbage moth.

The seeds are so smallthat planting them can be very tedious; practice dropping a pinch (2 or 3 seeds)on some white paper until you get the hang of it. Carrots can be either long andthin or short and stubby; pick the shape and size that best suits your garden.There is nothing more exciting for kids (including kids my age) than pulling upa carrot they planted months ago! It’s sort of like fishing—you don’t know howbig it is until you see it, but you hope it’s a whopper.STARTINGLocation: Full sun, but can stand partial shade.Seeds Indoors: No.Transplanting: Does not transplant well.Seeds Outdoors: Sprouts in two to three weeks outdoors. Seeds are very small;try pelleted seeds if necessary. Plant two or three seeds in each of the 16spaces in a square. Water soil and cover the square with a plastic-covered cage.Keep the ground moist at all times, even if it means daily spraying in sunnyweather.GROWINGWatering: Carrots must have constant moisture until they’re almost mature togrow quickly and continuously. Then reduce watering so the carrots don’t crackfrom overly rapid growth.Maintenance: Weed weekly; otherwise carrots are relatively work-free.HARVESTINGHow: Pull up those with the largest tops. If you’re not sure which are biggest,dig around the plant with your fingers to test the size.When: Pick them early, when they’re only half size and at their sweetest andmost tender.PREPARING AND USINGScrub with a vegetable brush, but don’t peel them. Most of the vitamins are inthe skin or close to the surface. Rich in vitamin A and thiamine (vitamin B1),carrots also contain calcium. Carrots are delicious fresh and raw—shredded,sliced thinly, or cut into sticks for snacking. They can be cooked by steamingor boiling. They can be served in a variety of dishes, or added to soups andstews, but seem best when served with a dressing, a dab of sour cream, orsprinkled with parsley and grated cheese. Carrots are so versatile you can evenmake a wonderfully moist cake with them.PROBLEMSCarrot rust fly, rabbits, woodchucks, deer, and voles.

Fall is the best season for plantingbecause the plant will mature in the cool weather. White cauliflower is the mostpopular variety but the purple one is considered to be more flavorful and doesbetter in the heat. The white variety needs 14 to 15 weeks to mature while thepurple variety can take up to 19 weeks.STARTINGLocation: Full sun, but will tolerate partial shade.Seeds Indoors: Will sprout in 5 to 10 days at 70°F. Plant 5 to 10 seeds in a cupof vermiculite, or plant one seed 1/4 inch deep in potting soil in individualcompartments of a seedling flat ten weeks before the last spring frost. For asecond crop in the fall, repeat the process anytime from June 15 to July 1. Keepwarm (70°F) until sprouted; move to full sunlight as soon as first shootsappear.Transplanting: Set out in the garden four weeks before the last spring frost.Place a cutworm collar around the stem, water, and provide a shade cage. Beextra careful when planting; cauliflower suffers more from transplanting thanany other cabbage family member.Seeds Outdoors: Not satisfactory; season is too short before hot weatherarrives.GROWINGWatering: Never let plants dry out.Maintenance: Weed weekly; mulch in hot weather.HARVESTINGHow: Cut off the entire head at its base with a sharp knife or clippers.When: Harvest as soon as the head enlarges, is firm, and has a nice white color,before the buds separate or open. Do not delay harvest, as the head will growfast and pass the ideal harvest point in just a few days.PREPARING AND USINGServe florets fresh and raw with any salad dressing or dip. Chopped caulifloweris excellent in tossed salads. Cook by steaming, boiling, or stir-frying. Servehot with cheese sauce, salad dressing, or just sprinkled with grated cheese. Itmakes a marvelous addition to any soup or stew; cauliflower soup is superb andquite unusual. Marinate any leftovers for addition to salads or relishes.PROBLEMSCutworms, root maggots, occasionally cabbage worms, and cabbage loopers; clubroot.HINTS AND TIPSFor white varieties that are not self-blanching, bend or break large leaves overthe top when heads start to form.

In most climates it can even be carried over the winter. Chard isavailable in white- or red-stemmed varieties and is also available in manyrainbow colors. It can have either smooth or crinkled leaves, whichever youlike; try both! It is also virtually pest- and disease-free.STARTINGLocation: Does best in full sun, but can grow in partial shade.Seeds Indoors: Plant 10 seeds in a cup of vermiculite, or place one seed 1/2inch deep in potting soil in individual compartments of a seedling tray 7 weeksbefore your last spring frost. Seeds will sprout in 5 to 10 days at 70°F. Keepwarm (70°F) until sprouted; move to full sunlight as soon as first shootsappear.Transplanting: Plant into the garden three weeks before the last spring frost.Water and cover with a plastic-covered cage.Seeds Outdoors: Plant presoaked seeds 1/2 inch deep in each square three weeksbefore your last spring frost. Seeds sprout outdoors in two to three weeks.Water and cover with a plastic-covered cage.GROWINGWatering: Weekly, or twice weekly in hot weather. Like all leaf crops, Swisschard needs lots of water for luxurious leaf growth.Maintenance: Weed weekly; cut off any yellow or overgrown outer leaves.HARVESTINGHow: Carefully cut off each outer stem at the plant base with a sharp knife whenthe leaves are 6 to 9 inches tall. The smaller inner leaves will continue togrow.When: Start harvesting when the outer leaves are about 6 to 9 inches tall(approximately eight weeks after planting seeds), and continue harvesting outerleaves (stalk and all) every week or so. Don’t let outer leaves get too largebefore harvesting.PREPARING AND USINGBoth leaves and stems are edible; leaves are very rich in vitamins A and C,calcium, and iron. The stalks can be cooked and served like asparagus; theleaves are used fresh or cooked, and are similar to, but milder in taste than,spinach.After harvest, rinse and pat dry like lettuce or spinach; refrigerate if notusing immediately. Cut out the central stalk and use the leaves as fresh greensfor salads, or boil or steam as you would spinach. Add freshly chopped greens toany appropriate soup for a garden-fresh taste. Chop the central stem or stalkinto convenient-size pieces and boil or steam like asparagus or celery. Servewith your favorite salad dressing, covered with bread crumbs, or grated cheese.Marinate leftover stalks overnight for a salad or appetizers.PROBLEMSSlugs and snails, cutworms, and leaf miners; occasionally rabbits, woodchucks,and deer. Free of most diseases.HINTS AND TIPSHarvest the outer leaves continuously. Plant a square each of all the colors andget out your camera for great ground-level shots.Swiss chard will survive several frosts even if it’s unprotected, allowing afall harvest. If mulched with loose hay it can be harvested into the winter inmost climates. With a complete mulch cover, it will also winter over andresprout the second year for a very early spring harvest. Gradually remove themulch in early spring and be rewarded by the first fresh greens from yourgarden. Plants will only produce a crop in early spring the second year; laterthey will go to seed, so start new plants every year.CORNImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0205-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: GrassHeight: 5 to 6 feetSpacing: 4 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: noSummer: yesFall: noWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 9 to 13 weeksSeeds Storage: 1 to 2 yearsWeeks to Maturity: 9 weeksIndoor Seed Starting: noEarliest Outdoor Planting: immediately after last spring frostAdditional Plantings: every 2 weeksDESCRIPTIONCorn is a long-time favorite of most gardeners. The taste of store-bought corncan’t compete with homegrown corn, so many plant a whole 4' × 4' SFG of justcorn. Most of the varieties for home use are planted 4 per square foot; only onecrop can be grown per season because it needs a long time to mature and lots ofhot weather.There many colors and varieties of corn. The later season types taste betterthan the earlier season varieties; the “extra sweet” variety is unusually goodand keeps its sweetness even after picking. The most common color of corn isyellow, but the best tasting are the bicolor and white varieties. As newvarieties of corn are developed, check with the seed companies for the latestrecommendations on how far apart to plant various types of corn so they don’tcross-pollinate.STARTINGLocation: Full sun; locate corn where it won’t shade other crops because it getsso tall.Seeds Indoors: No.Transplanting: Does not transplant well.Seeds Outdoors: Sprouts in 5 to 10 days outdoors. Plant your presoaked seeds 1to 2 inches deep, depending on the weather, at the proper spacing. Water thesoil and cover with a chicken-wire cage to keep out birds. To get a continuousharvest, plant a new crop every two weeks with several varieties of differentmaturation dates.GROWINGWatering: Weekly, more in the hot weather.Maintenance: Weed weekly; remove the chicken-wire cage when the corn is 6 inchestall. Place a raccoon-proof fence around your squares when the ears are startingto form.HARVESTINGHow: Use two hands to harvest—one to hold the stalk and the other to pull downand break off the ear—otherwise you may break the stalk. If there are no otherears left on that stalk it’s best to cut it down to the ground. Don’t pull itout or you may disturb the roots of the surrounding stalks.When: Check the ears daily when the silk first browns and the ears feel full andslightly bumpy. The final test of each ear before harvesting is to peel away asmall strip of the husk to expose the kernels. They should be plump and full. Tosee if the ear is ready, puncture a kernel with your thumbnail. If milky juicesquirts out, it’s ready; if the juice is clear, the corn is not quite ready topick.PREPARING AND USINGCorn loses its sweet taste very quickly after being picked, so try to cook andeat it as soon as possible. If you can’t use it immediately, husk andrefrigerate it. Up to 50 percent of the flavor is lost in the first 12 hours ofstorage, more if it’s not refrigerated. If you harvest more than you eat, cutthe kernels off the cob and freeze them, add to a relish dish, or serve warmwith butter and parsley. Of course, corn is excellent added to any kind of soupor stew.PROBLEMSCorn has more problems than any other garden crop, including corn borer, earworm, birds, raccoons, and squirrels. There are relatively few diseases thatbother the home gardener.HINTS AND TIPSChapter 4 [ch04.html#ch04] has some great tips on how to keep the critters outof your corn patch.Since your Mel’s Mix stays so loose and friable, protect corn from blowing overin late summer storms with the simple addition of steel fence posts and a littletomato nylon netting. Drive a post in each corner of your 4' × 4' garden andthen stretch a 4' × 4' piece of netting between the 4 posts, about 3 feet offthe ground. The plants will easily grow right up through the netting, which willsupport them without any extra work on your part.CUCUMBERImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0207-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: GourdHeight: vineSpacing: 2 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: noSummer: yesFall: noWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 9 weeksSeeds Storage: 5 to 6 yearsWeeks to Maturity: 7 weeksEarliest Outdoor Planting: 1 week after last spring frostDESCRIPTIONThe cucumber is a garden favorite, and is very easy to grow in warm weather.Although both vine and bush varieties are available, bush cucumbers take a lotof room and don’t produce like the vine types. Use the vertical method to growyour vine cucumbers.There are many varieties ranging in size, shape, and use, including ones forpickling or serving raw. The pickling varieties are picked much earlier whenthey are smaller—just the right size for the pickle jar—but they can also beeaten. The slicing types are grown larger and are more commonly used for saladsor sandwiches.STARTINGLocation: Full sun, although the vine types will tolerate some shade.Seeds Indoors: Sprouts in 4 to 8 days at 70°F; will sprout even faster at 80°F.Plant one seed in individual paper cups filled with Mel’s Mix. Punch holes inthe bottom for drainage. Keep warm (at least 70°F) until sprouted; move to fullsunlight as soon as the first shoots appear.Transplanting: Plant the cup and all in the ground at the proper plant spacing.If the cup is waxed cardboard or a heavy paper, tear away the bottom carefully;avoid disturbing the roots. Water and cover with a shade cage.Seeds Outdoors: Sprouts in five to ten days; place presoaked seeds at properspacing, water, and keep soil moist until seeds sprout.GROWINGWatering: Weekly; twice weekly in hot weather. Never let the soil dry out. Avoidwetting the leaves, as this spreads any fungus disease that may be present.Cucumbers have the highest water content of any vegetable, so plenty of moistureis required for proper growth.Maintenance: Weed weekly; keep vines on the trellis; watch out for beetles;mulch in hot weather.HARVESTINGHow: Cut (don’t pull) the stem connecting the fruit to the vine.When: Harvest continually! Never allow any cucumbers to become yellow or overlylarge, or the plant will stop producing. Keep picking even if you have to tosssome on the compost pile because you can’t use them. Don’t try the old practiceof eating the large cukes and leaving the smaller ones on the vine, because inonly one or two days the little ones will be big. Instead, compost the verylarge cucumbers and eat the smaller ones.PREPARING AND USINGWash and scrub with a vegetable brush. Serve long, slender burpless varietieswith the skins left on. Peel the fatter varieties before slicing, cubing, orcutting into long sticks. Serve fresh, sliced on sandwiches with onions andmayonnaise, or marinate for relish. Many gardeners like cucumbers simply soakedin vinegar overnight and served with lots of pepper. They also go well in anysalad or arranged around a spoonful of cottage cheese.PROBLEMSCucumber beetles; mildew, wilt, and mosaic.HINTS AND TIPSDon’t let the fruit get too large; pick early and often.

However, some of the newer varieties are yellow, brown, orwhite and are smaller and rounder. Eggplant yields a very large harvest and areused in many different styles of cooking. They are easily grown, but take a longtime to mature—so you need to start plants indoors in early spring or buytransplants locally.STARTINGLocation: Full sun and lots of heat; pick your sunniest spot for eggplant.Seeds Indoors: Sprouts in 12 days at 70°F, but only requires 6 days at 85°F;won’t sprout below 65°F. Sprinkle 5 to 10 seeds 1/4 inch deep in a cup filledwith vermiculite 7 weeks before your last spring frost. Keep warm (at least70°F) until sprouted; move to full sunlight as soon as first shoots appear; thenpot up in seedling trays as soon as plants are large enough (usually one tothree weeks). Keep a careful watch over the plants, especially aftertransplanting them into seedling trays, because any pause or stoppage of thegrowth will affect the ultimate bearing capacity of the plant.Transplanting: Plant into the garden two weeks after the last spring frost;disturb the roots as little as possible. Water and cover with a shade cage.Since eggplant is so vulnerable to cold weather, cover the wire cage with aclear plastic cover as well as a sun shade to provide a greenhouse atmosphere ifit is at all chilly. In a few days the sun shade can be removed.Seeds Outdoors: Not satisfactory, as the season is too short before hot weatherarrives.GROWINGWatering: Eggplant needs constant moisture, especially when fruits are formingand enlarging.Maintenance: Weed weekly; add a thick mulch when hot weather sets in. Provide awide mesh, open-wire cage support when the eggplant is half grown; the plantswill grow right through it, and will be supported without staking.HARVESTINGHow: Always cut the fruit from the bush with clippers; watch out for sharpspines on the stems and fruits.When: Edible almost anytime after the fruit turns dark and glossy (when it’sabout 6 inches), don’t let them get too large. If they turn a dull color theyare overripe and the seeds will be large and hard.PREPARING AND USINGPeel and slice or dice, then stew, fry, stir-fry, or bake; add to casseroles, orbread and fry by itself. Eggplant mixes especially well with tomatoes andonions. If you’re not going to use the eggplant right away, don’t refrigerateit; instead, store it on the kitchen counter and enjoy its good looks! Handlecarefully or fruit will bruise.PROBLEMSCutworms and flea beetles; verticillium wilt.HINTS AND TIPSMany cooks use eggplant as a substitute for meat in various dishes.

While it does grow best in the coolseasons and withstands cold weather, it tolerates some heat and can be grownnearly year-round.There are several types of lettuce: the solid head usually found in grocerystores; the loose head, or Bibb, a faster growing, and smaller variety of headlettuce; Romaine or cos, which is a loose head with a rougher texture than theleaf types. The Romaine leaf is comprised of many tight, upright leaves and isprobably the best pick for home gardeners—but there are also so many great typesof leaf and Bibb lettuces that every gardener should try to grow at least fourvarieties at all times! They do best as a spring or fall crop, but with care andprotection, they can be grown in summer and even in winter in many parts of thecountry. Look for the types that are suitable for summer or winter seasons.STARTINGLocation: Full sun to partial shade; shade is welcomed in the hot summer. Aswith all leafy vegetables, the stronger the light, the higher the vitamin Ccontent will be.Seeds Indoors: Sprouts in 2 to 3 days at 70°F. Start 5 to 10 seeds of severaldifferent varieties in cups filled with vermiculite 7 weeks before your lastspring frost date. Keep warm (70°F) until sprouted; move to full sunlight assoon as first shoots appear; then pot up in seedling trays as soon as plants arelarge enough (usually one to three weeks).Transplanting: Move plants into the garden anytime until they are half grown.Plant a new square or two of lettuce every other week until early summer. Thehot weather, long days, warm nights, and dry soil of summer cause lettuce tobolt to seed. Plant special varieties sold as heat- or bolt-resistant. Aftersummer is over you can start planting the same varieties you did in the spring.Seeds Outdoors: Sprouts in 5 to 10 days. Seeds sprout quickly outdoors and growfairly rapidly; however, this method is time-saving but space-consuming. Ifspace is your concern, start all seeds indoors or off to the side of the gardenand move plants into the garden when they’re half grown. Transplants seem tobolt to seed more easily than direct-seeded plants, so plant the summer cropdirectly in the garden. Plant one or two seeds in each hole; water daily untilthey sprout.GROWINGWatering: Try not to wet the leaves; you may spread fungal diseases. Don’t waterat night; morning is the best followed by noon or late afternoon.Maintenance: Weed weekly; don’t let any weeds grow. Lettuce has such a shallowroot system it can’t compete with weeds. Provide shade covers for plants insummer.HARVESTINGHow: You can cut individual outer leaves or the entire plant. If you’re going tocut outer leaves you can start when the plant is half grown. This makes asurprisingly large harvest when combined with a few leaves of beet, spinach, andSwiss chard. If you take just one leaf from each plant, you can still harvest alot and hardly notice what has been harvested.When: Harvest leaf varieties at seven weeks, and Bibb varieties at nine weeks,or harvest outer leaves from either one when the plant is half grown. You canalso cut the entire plant at any time; it doesn’t have to grow to full size tobe edible. If you wait until all your plants reach full size you will have toharvest almost all of them at once or they will go to seed.PREPARING AND USINGRinse lettuce under cool water, spin or pat dry, and store in the refrigeratorin a plastic bag until you’re ready to use it. Lettuce will stay fresh and crispfor several days, although it’s even better to harvest almost daily for maximumnutritional value. Lettuce contains vitamins A and B, calcium, and iron(especially the dark green outer leaves).PROBLEMSRabbits, deer, woodchucks, slugs, cutworms, sow bugs, and wire worms. There arenot many diseases to be concerned about unless the lettuce is quite wet atground level.HINTS AND TIPSGrow as many different colors and textures as possible to have unusual salads.Pick outer leaves daily to fill your salad bowl . . . in fact, take your saladbowl right out to the garden!MELON (CANTALOUPE, MUSKMELON, WATERMELON)Image [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0212-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: GourdHeight: vineSpacing: 1 per 2 squaresGrowing SeasonSpring: noSummer: yesFall: noWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 12 weeksSeeds Storage: 5 to 6 yearsIndoor Seed Starting: 2 weeks before transplantingEarliest Outdoor Planting: 2 weeks after last spring frostAdditional Plantings: noDESCRIPTIONMelons need about 3 months of hot weather to grow, but are a fun and excitingcrop—even though the yield isn’t large, when the harvest finally comes, it allseems very worthwhile. They should be grown on vertical frames, as they willmature sooner and save space. Of course, one of the biggest rewards is seeingmelons hanging 4 to 5 feet off the ground on your vertical frame—that’s notsomething you’re used to seeing in your old single-row gardens!STARTINGLocation: Full sun; grow on a vertical frame.Seeds Indoors: Sprouts in 5 to 10 days at 70°F; the hotter the better, even upto 90°F for sprouting. Plant single seeds in individual paper cups. Plants donot transplant well, so don’t start them until two weeks before plantingoutside.Transplanting: Plant outdoors two weeks after the last frost date. Sink theentire cup in the ground after tearing off the bottom.Seeds Outdoors: Won’t sprout in soil below 65°F; takes 5 days in 70°F soil.Plant a presoaked seed in each square foot, one week after last frost. Coverwith a plastic-covered cage. Remove weakest one later.GROWINGWatering: Mulch heavily in hot weather. Reduce water when melons are almost ripeto develop their sweetness. Keep the leaves dry to avoid fungal diseases andmildew.Maintenance: Weed weekly; support the half-grown melons in slings; pinch out allnew, small melons near the end of the growing season so that all the plant’sstrength goes into ripening the larger melons that are already set.HARVESTINGHow: Twist the melon with one hand while holding the stem with the other. If itresists parting, the melon is not ripe.When: Harvest whenever it has a strong melon scent, and the netting pattern onthe rind (if it’s a cantaloupe) becomes very prominent. The stem will slip offeasily when the melon is rotated. If each melon is held in a sling it won’t rollaround and accidentally twist itself off when it’s ripe.PREPARING AND USINGSome people like melons warm, some, chilled. Cut muskmelons or cantaloupes inhalf, scoop out the seeds, and cut into wedges, or serve an entire half filledwith ice cream, blueberries, or custard. The flesh of all melons can also bescooped out using a melon-baller or cut into cubes and mixed with or added to afresh fruit salad. They’re excellent for breakfast or served as a dinnerdessert.PROBLEMSCutworms; mildew and wilt disease.HINTS AND TIPSBe the first on your block to grow melons! There are so many varieties to choosefrom—start with the smaller, more common varieties. Melons get very heavy, somake sure your vertical frame is strong and well-supported.Watermelon: All data and advice above is about the same for this giant of asummer crop. One big caution: make darn sure your vertical frame is strong! Itwould also be prudent to start by growing the smaller varieties; they producewell, are very sweet, and would be a good trial for your experiment, as theygrow well vertically.Pumpkin: The same scenario will apply to growing pumpkins on your verticalframe.

Oncethe flowers have bloomed, the pods grow very quickly, so check the plant dailyfor young pods as these have the best flavor and texture. Okra loves hotweather, and may not get a long enough period of heat to grow well in areas witha short growing season, but try it anyway as it does grow very quickly duringthe hottest days of summer. You might also look for smaller, short-seasonvarieties.STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: 6 to 8 weeks before the last spring frost. Soak seeds overnightand plant at a depth of 1 inch.Transplanting: Set seedlings out after the soil has warmed, 7 to 10 days afterthe last frost.Seeds Outdoors: Soak seeds overnight, then plant 1 inch deep, 2 weeks after thelast frost, and at least 3 months before the first fall frost.GROWINGWatering: Keep soil fairly moist; mulch in very hot weather.Maintenance: Remove old, hard pods from the plant unless you are saving them forseed or dried arrangements.HARVESTINGHow: Cut pods from plants with a pruner or knife. Breaking or pulling the podscan damage the plant.When: Harvest pods daily when they are young, no more than 4 inches long. Olderpods can be too tough to eat.PREPARING AND USINGOkra can be stored in the refrigerator in a paper bag or wrapped in a papertowel in a perforated plastic bag for 2 to 3 days; it may be frozen for up to 12months after blanching whole for 2 minutes. Cooked okra can be stored in therefrigerator for 3 to 4 days. Okra can be served raw, marinated in salads, orcooked on its own, and goes well with tomatoes, onions, corn, peppers, andeggplant.

Trim off the brown, dead tops to keep the garden lookinggood.Onions can be planted from sets, plants, or seeds; the bulb reaches harvestsometime in the middle of the summer. The size of the bulb is determined by thelength of the growing season before the summer solstice (June 21). If you have ashort growing season, don’t bother with seeds—get the plants or sets (which looklike miniature onions). If you live in a milder climate you could try the seedmethod.There are many types of onions, from large, fat ones, to small, golf-ball-sizedvarieties. Some need to be used soon after harvest, while others are fine arefor storing. Check the seed catalog descriptions and pick your favorites.STARTINGLocation: Onions like a sunny spot, but will tolerate some shade.Seeds Indoors: Sprouts in 5 days at 70°F. Sprinkle about 20 seeds of eachvariety desired into cups filled with vermiculite 8 to 12 weeks before your lastspring frost. Keep warm (70°F) until sprouted; move to full sunlight as soon asfirst shoots appear; then pot up in seedling trays as soon as plants are largeenough (usually one to three weeks).Transplanting: Four weeks before the last spring frost, shake most of thevermiculite from your young plants and gather them together in small bunches.With scissors, cut off both the tops and the roots so the plant is balanced withabout 2 inches of each. Drill a hole at each space in your square with a pencil,and slip in a plant, firm the soil, and water.Seeds Outdoors: If the season is not long enough for seeds, use sets. Push thetiny onion sets into the ground, pointed side up at the proper spacing, withtheir tops just showing above the soil. Water, and that’s all there is to it.GROWINGWatering: Withhold water when the tops start to fall over.Maintenance: Weed weekly; when bulbs start expanding use your finger to removesome of the soil around each bulb and partially uncover it. This makes it easierfor the bulb to expand. It will not hurt if you can actually see the top ofevery bulb; in fact, it’s kind of exciting to see them getting bigger and biggerevery week!HARVESTINGHow: Pull the onions out of the ground and place on chicken wire or a windowscreen laid out in the sun for several days. The tops, roots, and outer skin ofeach onion will then dry thoroughly. Brush them off and clean off any looseskins, dried tops, or roots by rubbing them between your palms, then store forlater use. Any onions with green or thick tops should not be stored but usedimmediately.When: About the middle of the summer you’ll see your onion tops turning brownand falling over. When the majority have fallen, bend over the remaining oneswith your hand. In a short while, the tops will dry up while the bulbs attaintheir maximum size.PREPARING AND USINGYou’ll find homegrown onions much milder and sweeter than store-bought ones.This makes them more useful, especially for those folks who must be careful ofeating too many onions. For a real treat, try an onion sandwich—thin slices ofonion with mayonnaise and lots of pepper on your favorite bread. Or add fresh,crisp cucumber slices to the sandwich for a delightful combination. Hang driedonions in a mesh bag, or braid tops together and hang in a cool, dry area forstorage all winter.PROBLEMSOnion fly maggot.

Pests don’t seem to bother it, and it’s disease-resistant too. All in all,parsley is a very easy addition to your SFG. There are many varieties, butbasically two kinds: flat-leaved and curly. It’s said the flat-leaf varietiestaste better, but the curly-leaf types are better looking, and more commonlygrown.STARTINGLocation: Full sun to partial shade.Seeds Indoors: Sprouts in 10 to 15 days at 70°F. Seeds are very slow togerminate, and should be soaked in lukewarm water for 24 hours before planting.Sprinkle ten presoaked seeds in a cup filled with vermiculite 12 weeks beforelast spring frost. Keep warm (70°F) until sprouted; move to full sunlight assoon as first shoots appear; then pot up in seedling trays as soon as plants arelarge enough (usually one to three weeks).Transplanting: Move outdoors five weeks before the last spring frost or anytimeplants are large enough; plant them at the same depth they grew in the pot.Seeds Outdoors: Better to start indoors because seeds are slow and difficult togerminate.GROWINGWatering: Never let parsley dry out completely because it becomes tough andbitter and may bolt to seed in the first year.Maintenance: Weed weekly. Mulch heavily for continual harvest in winter, and forearly-spring growing the following year.HARVESTINGHow: Cut outer leaves as needed; for a large harvest, cut off the entire plantslightly above tiny middle shoots. Either way, the plant will continue to growwith no harm.When: Harvest as soon as the plant gets 3 to 4 inches tall and anytimethereafter.PREPARING AND USINGParsley is good in soups, casseroles, stews, and with fish or any kind of meat;it’s excellent over boiled vegetables, particularly potatoes. Parsley is loadedwith vitamins A and C. Cut up leaves with scissors and sprinkle on food for thatdecorative gourmet chef look!PROBLEMSRelatively free from pests and diseases.HINTS AND TIPSPot up a plant or two in the fall for a kitchen windowsill garden, or even planahead and pot up several for holiday, birthday, or Christmas gifts.PEA, SUGAR SNAPImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0218-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: PulseHeight: vineSpacing: 8 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: yesSummer: noFall: yesWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 10 weeksSeeds Storage: 3 to 4 yearsWeeks to Maturity: 10 weeksIndoor Seed Starting: noEarliest Outdoor Planting: 5 weeks before last spring frostDESCRIPTIONWho doesn’t like the taste of fresh peas? Yet until the introduction of sugarsnap peas, it was hard to grow enough for much more than a few meals—peas usedto take time, space, and effort to harvest, not to mention the shelling. Evenwhen you’re all finished, it doesn’t seem to add up to much!The sugar snap peas, or edible pod varieties, have changed all of that. They areextremely high yielding, and you can eat the entire pod. They have about fivetimes the harvest of conventional peas. Sugar snap peas are juicy, sweet, andcrisp, and are absolutely wonderful. They can be eaten raw or cooked. They are amust in my garden, and I recommend them as the only pea worth growing. Very fewof the pea pods even make it to the kitchen now, because they are such a treatto eat right in the garden—you might need to make a family rule: pick and eatall you want but leave enough for dinner! Once the kids are told they can eatright from the garden, they’ll become much more interested in eating vegetables!STARTINGLocation: Full sun in spring; shaded toward summer if possible.Seeds Indoors: No.Transplanting: Does not transplant well.Seeds Outdoors: Sprouts in 10 to 15 days outdoors. Mix presoaked seeds withlegume inoculant powder for an added boost, then plant 1 inch deep about 5 weeksbefore the last spring frost. Water and cover with a plastic-covered tunnel.GROWINGWatering: Never let the peas dry out.Maintenance: Weed weekly; keep water off the vines. Keep the vines trained upthe vertical frame; mulch as weather gets warm.HARVESTINGHow: Carefully (with two hands) pick or cut pods off their stems.When: The beauty of these peas is that you can eat them at any stage of growth.They’re just as tasty (raw or cooked) whether their pods are fully mature andbulging with peas, or still thin and barely starting to show the peas inside.Munch on a few every time you’re in the garden—what a treat!PREPARING AND USINGJust wash and they are ready to eat or cook. Try to use them as fresh aspossible; store what you can’t use right away in refrigerator. Sugar snaps arerich in vitamins A, B1 and C, and contain phosphorus and iron. As the pods getnearly full size, some develop a string along each edge, but it’s easy toremove: just snap off the stem end and pull down, and both strings will easilypeel off. The pod is still very crisp and tasty even when full size.If the pods start to lose their nice pea-green color and turn brown on the vine,they are overripe. Pick them immediately and add them to the compost pile,because if you don’t harvest them they will cause the vine to stop producing newpeas.The versatility of these tasty peas stretches the imagination. Try them raw insalads, with a dip, plain, or mixed with other fresh vegetables in vinegar orsour cream dressing . . . or cook them by boiling, steaming, or stir-frying.PROBLEMSNo pests to speak of (except those people in the family that eat too many), butsometimes prone to powdery mildew, especially during warm weather when theleaves get wet.HINTS AND TIPSLet the kids grow them and you’ll have a vegetarian in the making.PEPPERImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0220-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: NightshadeHeight: 12 to 24 inchesSpacing: 1 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: noSummer: yesFall: noWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 19 weeksSeeds Storage: 4 to 5 yearsWeeks to Maturity: 10 weeksIndoor Seed Starting: 7 weeks before last spring frostEarliest Outdoor Planting: 2 weeks after last spring frostDESCRIPTIONMost gardeners love to grow peppers: they’re easy to grow, pest- anddisease-free, and produce a lot for the space allotted. You can buy transplantslocally, or start seeds yourself. They look great in the garden, and some peoplegrow several types for their decorative aspect. If all you’ve grown are thegreen bell peppers, give the sweet yellow banana varieties a try. Peppers comein several different shapes, from the bell shape to the skinny, curved, hotchili peppers. They range in color from green, red, orange and yellow. Selectthe type you want for cooking and go for it!STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: Sprouts in 10 to 15 days at 70°F. Sprinkle 5 to 10 seeds in a cupof vermiculite approximately 7 weeks before the last spring frost, cover with1/4 inch more vermiculite. Keep warm (70°F) until sprouted; move to fullsunlight as soon as first shoots appear; then pot up in seedling trays as soonas plants are large enough (usually one to three weeks).Transplanting: Peppers need warm soil so don’t transplant until two weeks afterthe last spring frost.Seeds Outdoors: The season is too short to start outdoors.GROWINGWatering: Don’t wet the leaves; this causes fungal and wilt infections.Maintenance: Weed weekly; mulch in hot weather; cover half-grown plants with anopen-mesh wire cage to support plants without staking. Stems and branches ofpepper plants are brittle and break easily, so work carefully among them whenharvesting.HARVESTINGHow: Carefully cut the fruit from the bush (don’t pull or you’ll accidentallybreak other branches). Leave about 1 inch of stem on each pepper for a longerstorage life.When: Harvest at almost any stage of development! Basically, if you want greenpeppers pick them as soon as they are big enough for your use. You can leavethem on the vine and they will turn red or yellow after they become full grown.Peppers can still be eaten when red or yellow; in fact, many people prefer them,as their taste is sweeter and not as spicy when they lose their green color. Ofcourse, the hot chili peppers should turn color before you use them.PREPARING AND USINGUse peppers raw or cooked. Peppers are excellent as a salad or casserolegarnish. Cut them into strips, cubes, or thin slices as you would a tomato.Their shape is very attractive as a garnish. Peppers stuffed with a meat, rice,or vegetable mixture and then baked makes a great summer supper. Peppers arehigh in vitamins A and C.PROBLEMSCutworms and flea beetles.

But growing yourown potatoes is the best way to sample the large variety of potato shapes, sizesand colors. Harvest them early for small, tasty nuggets; or dig them later forlarge tubers to store over the winter. And the potato plant itself is bushy andpretty, doing double duty as an ornamental and an edible. The white flowers arethe indicator that the small, new potatoes are ready to harvest out of theground and onto the table.STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: No.Planting: Don’t plant seeds; cut up potatoes in small pieces and let the eyessprout, then plant those.Outdoors: Plant in the spring when the soil has reached 45°F. Use only certifieddisease-free seed potatoes. Sprout potatoes a week before planting time byplacing them in a tray where they will receive light (not sun) and temperaturesof about 65°F. A day or two before planting, cut potatoes into “seed pieces”about 1 1/2” square with at least one “sprouted eye” per section. Remove about 5inches of your soil in that square foot, place four seed pieces at the properspacing with eyes up, and just barely cover them. When sprouts appear, addenough Mel’s Mix to again cover the green leafy sprouts. Keep doing this untilthe hole is filled back to the top. For an extra harvest, use the high-risemethod described in Chapter 4 [ch04.html#ch04]. Cover the plants every week orso with more Mel’s Mix, until the plants begin to flower. Make certain any newpotatoes that are forming are well covered, as uncovered spuds will turn green.GROWINGWatering: Increase watering during flowering.Maintenance: Protect from frost.HARVESTINGHow: Gently loosen the soil around early potatoes and remove the largest tubers,leaving the smaller ones to continue growing. For later potatoes, gently digoutside the plant and remove the potatoes as you find them. Take care not tostab or cut the potatoes as you dig. If the weather is dry, leave the potatoeson top of the soil for 2 to 3 days to dry. If the weather is wet, bring thepotatoes into a garage or basement to dry. This will toughen the skin forstorage. Store potatoes in a cool (40°F.), dark location for 3 to 6 months. Donot store potatoes near apples, which give off a chemical that will damage thepotatoes.When: Small early potatoes can be harvested as needed in early summer after theplants finish flowering. Later potatoes can be left in the soil until 2 to 3weeks after the foliage has died back in fall, and can be lifted all at once forstoring.PREPARING AND USINGPotatoes can be boiled, fried, steamed, grilled, or baked. All potatoes shouldbe cooked or placed in water immediately after peeling to prevent discoloration.To peel or not to peel is generally a result of the preparation method orpersonal preference. The exception is thin-skinned new potatoes, which shouldnot be peeled.Choose the type of potato to use in a recipe based on its qualities. Newpotatoes are moist and waxy and are best for steaming, boiling, and in salads.Oblong mature white potatoes are rather dry and starchy. They are the mostpopular potato to use for French-fries and they are great for baking andmashing. Round red potatoes have a rather waxy texture, making them ideal forboiling and mashing. Round white potatoes are thin-skinned and hold their shapein salads as well as boiling and roasting. Yellow-fleshed potatoes are good forsteaming, roasting, and mashing.Potatoes do not freeze, dry, or can well.PROBLEMSFlea beetles, leaf hoppers, and slugs; blight, scab, and root knot nematode.Tubers exposed to sunlight while growing will turn green and are mildly toxic.HINTS AND TIPSLet the plant continue to grow for a late harvest of bigger potatoes.

Who canpass up a vegetable that matures in only three weeks? Plus, they are zesty andtasty in any dish.Radishes come in a multitude of shapes from small and round to long carrotshapes. They vary in color from red, pink, white, and even some black varieties.Radishes planted in the spring are normally red or white colored, and willmature in 3 to 4 weeks. Fall radishes take 6 to 8 weeks and store very well;they’re referred to as winter radishes.It’s easy to plant too many radishes. They don’t like being crowded, so the SFGmethod is very suitable for this vegetable. Decide how many you can use eachweek and then plant no more than double that number every other week for acontinuous, but controlled, harvest.STARTINGLocation: Full sun to partial shade.Seeds Indoors: No.Transplanting: Does not transplant well.Seeds Outdoors: Sprouts in five to ten days outdoors depending on temperature.Plant 1/2 inch deep in spring, 1 inch deep in summer. If you really likeradishes a lot, plant some every week of the growing year, even through the hotweather. The plants will still do fairly well then if you give them some shade,lots of water, and a thick mulch. Winter or long-keeping varieties need twomonths to mature, so start them at least that long before the first fall frost.GROWINGWatering: Don’t let radishes stop growing or dry out; lack of water causeshot-tasting and pithy radishes.Maintenance: Weed weekly; keep covered with screen-covered cage if root maggotsare a problem; mulch in hot weather.HARVESTINGHow: Pull up the entire plant and trim off the top. Refrigerate edible portionsif they’re not used immediately.When: Harvest as soon as they are marble size up to Ping-Pong ball size; thesmaller you pull them, the sweeter they taste. The long fall varieties can beleft in the ground until frost, then either mulched to keep the ground fromfreezing, or pulled and stored in damp peat moss or sand after the tops areremoved.PREPARING AND USINGSlice, dice, or cut into fancy shapes for eating out of hand or to add tosalads, and for garnishes.

It usually doeswell if it stays cool in the spring. A rapid grower, it can be grown in a fairlysmall space and looks great in the garden. It will quickly bolt to seed in thesummer heat, but grows very well in the early spring and then again in the fall.Spinach is very cold hardy and in many areas of the country it will winter over;in warmer climates, it can be grown all winter.There are two types of spinach—the smooth-leaved kind and a crinkly-leaved typecalled Savoy, which is more popular and more attractive. Neither will endureheat and should be grown in cool weather. Some varieties are more resistant tofrost and are particularly adaptable for growing in the fall, and possibly intothe winter season. Check your seed catalog for appropriate varieties.STARTINGLocation: Any location is suitable, full sun to partial shade.Seeds Indoors: No.Transplanting: Does not transplant well.Seeds Outdoors: Sprouts outdoors in one to two weeks. Plant seeds 1/2 inch deep,water, and cover with a plastic-covered cage. Plants can withstand anytemperature between 25°F and 75°F, so judge your spring and fall plantingaccordingly.GROWINGWatering: Being a leaf crop, spinach needs constant moist soil.Maintenance: Weed weekly; mulch in warm weather. Don’t work in the spinachsquare if the leaves are very wet—they are brittle and break easily.HARVESTINGHow: Cut outer leaves as needed; small inner leaves will continue to growrapidly.When: Harvest as soon as the plants look like they won’t miss an outer leaf ortwo. Keep picking and the plant will keep growing right up until hot weather. Ifit’s a spring crop and you think the plants are going to bolt soon, cut off theentire plant for a little extra harvest.PREPARING AND USINGWash carefully; soil tends to cling to the undersides, especially on the oneswith crinkled leaves. Spin or pat dry and store in refrigerator just likelettuce. Better yet, eat spinach right away. Serve fresh in salads, cookslightly for a wilted spinach salad, or cook by steaming lightly. Spinach goesgreat with any meal, especially when garnished with a chopped, hard-boiled egg.It’s high in vitamins A, B1, and C, and is a valuable source of iron.PROBLEMSLeaf miners and aphids.

Sincestrawberries are so popular, most families like to plant an entire 4' × 4' instrawberries—it’s easy to protect and harvest. You might also like to build apyramid box and plant it in all strawberries.Growing your own strawberries is fun and rewarding. Strawberry plants bear fruitfor at least 3 or 4 years, then yields will decrease and eventually the plantwill die. Each plant sends out runners that produce a new plant, which can beused as the next generation of strawberries in the garden. However, I recommendyou not let them root, as they take so much energy from the parent plant. I’llexplain a better way for your SFG.There are three main types of strawberries: June-bearing, which sets fruit inJune; ever-bearing, which will set fruit twice during the growing season; andday-neutral, which is not affected by the length of the day as the others are.And don’t overlook the Alpine strawberry, which will reward you with tiny butincredibly tasty fruit over a long period!STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: No.Transplanting: Early spring, as soon as the soil is not frozen. Be sure soil isnot wet.Outdoors: Most gardeners buy strawberry plants in packets of a dozen or so. Soakfirst, then trim off the roots slightly, and plant 4 per square foot. Leave asaucer-shaped depression around each plant for effective watering. Keep the soilmoist; increase water when strawberries are fruiting.GROWINGWatering: Weekly; more during dry periods.Maintenance: Cut off all the runners as soon as you see them each week; that wayall the energy will stay in the parent plant for an increased harvest each year.After 3 or 4 years when the harvest starts to diminish, it is best to pull outthose plants and replant, perhaps in a different square with brand-new certifieddisease-free plants from the nursery. It’s true that those runners will producebaby plants and it seems a waste not to use them; some people like to let themgrow. However, the problem comes from too many runners producing too many babyplants (because the gardener forgets to cut them off); they take all the energyfrom the parent, reducing the harvest.HARVESTINGHow: Pick the fruit leaving a short piece of stem attached; use scissors for aclean cut.When: Harvest as fruit ripens, for 2 to 3 weeks.PREPARING AND USINGUse strawberries as soon as possible after picking; pop a few right in yourmouth. They can be used in fruit salads, on cakes, and in pies.

It iseasy and fast to grow, but needs hot weather to do well. There are many colorsand shapes—round, straight, crookneck and flat—each with its particular taste.Most of the varieties sold are the bush types, (especially zucchini), so you’llhave to assign a larger space (a 3' × 3' area) to just one plant. However, thoseplants can produce a vast amount of fruit, so most gardeners think it’sworthwhile, at least for one or two plants.An alternate solution is to grow the vining types on vertical frames, which isquite a space saver. (Zucchini can be trained to grow vertically, but it stilltakes a lot of room because of those huge leaves and prickly stems.) Check theseed packet or catalog to make sure you are getting a vine type; if the seedpacket or catalog doesn’t say so, call the seed company’s toll-free number andask.STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: Doesn’t transplant well because of the long taproot. It’s best tostart seeds outdoors. If you do want to start indoors, plant one seed in a papercup of Mel’s Mix 1 inch deep. Plant 2 weeks before your last frost date.Transplanting: Plant outdoors on your last spring frost date.Seeds Outdoors: Sprouts in 5 to 10 days outdoors. For bush types, plant 2presoaked seeds in the center of a nine-square space. For vine types, also plant2 presoaked seeds in the middle of a 2-square-foot space under your verticalframe. Make sure you hollow out a dish shape around the planted seeds to holdplenty of water. Place a plastic-covered cage over the seeds to warm the soil.After sprouting, cut off the weakest plant if both seeds sprout.GROWINGWatering: Keep the leaves dry to prevent powdery mildew.Maintenance: Weed weekly; keep vines trained up vertical frames or within boundsof the square.HARVESTINGHow: Carefully cut through the fruit stem but do not cut the main vine or leafstems. Handle the squash gently as their skins are very soft and easily damagedby fingernails or if dropped.When: Harvest as soon as the blossoms wilt, and until the fruits are 6 to 9inches long. Don’t let them grow any longer. Sometimes you have to harvest atleast three times a week; they grow that fast. Squash loses flavor as the seedsinside mature.PREPARING AND USINGRinse lightly and serve sliced or cut into sticks, with a dip, or just as anappetizer anytime. Cook lightly by steaming or stir-frying, in any number ofdishes or combinations. Serve squash by itself or with other vegetables,seasoned with a little dressing, grated cheese, or chopped parsley.

That’s whywe grow it vertically! The fruit can be picked in the late fall and storedwithout difficulty to be used during the winter; it retains its delectableflavor long after being harvested.There are many varieties to select from, but butternut and acorn are the mostpopular. All winter squashes have thick skins that harden in the fall, and aregenerally picked after the vines have been killed by frost. You don’t get yourcompensation until season’s end, but since there is almost no fresh producethen, the winter squash is very welcomed. The fruit has a mild flavor and isfine grained.STARTINGLocation: Full sun, but tolerates a little shade.Seeds Indoors: No.Transplanting: Does not transplant well because of the long taproot.Seeds Outdoors: Since the seeds sprout quickly, you might as well start themoutdoors. Plant two presoaked seeds in the center of 2 square feet. Make sureyou’ve left a 2-inch depression around the seeds to hold lots of water duringthe season. Cover with a plastic covered cage to warm the soil and encouragefast seed sprouting. Cut off the weakest plant if both seeds sprout.GROWINGWatering: Keep soil moist.Maintenance: Weed weekly; keep vines trained up the vertical frame.HARVESTINGHow: Cut the squash from the vine, leaving as long a stem as possible, at least2 inches. Then set the fruit out in the sun to cure for a few days, protectingit at night when frost is in the forecast.When: Harvest after the first light frost, which will kill the leaves and vines,and after the main vine wilts, but before a very hard frost.PREPARING AND USINGPeel, cut in half, scoop out seeds, and prepare for boiling or baking. Excellentserved mashed or in chunks with butter and parsley. Winter squash can even beadded to some soups and stews.

There is a huge selection available, somespecifically suited for eating, juicing, cooking, or canning. They’re availablein early, midseason, or late types in different colors ranging from red, orange,pink, and yellow. Size also varies from the small cherry tomato to the extralarge 4-pound types that win awards at the county fair.When choosing varieties, it’s very important to consider whether they are pest-and disease-resistant This is very important, so make a note: resistantvarieties are labeled VFN. V indicates the plant is resistant to Verticilliumwilt; F indicates it will resist Fusarium wilt; and N is for nematodes, whichare tiny, tiny worms that infect the roots. There are some very goodnon-resistant traditional varieties, but if you are hit with any of theseproblems and lose your plants virtually overnight just when they’re starting toproduce, you’ll understand the value of the varieties that are disease- andpest-resistant.The resistant varieties taste great and also mature in early, midseason, or lateseason. Usually the early season fruits are best suited to the colder climatesin the north. If you live in a longer-season climate, you can grow a fewdifferent varieties that will produce all season long.Tomatoes have two different growth habits: determinate and indeterminate (inother words, bush or vine). Bush varieties that grow no more than 3 feet tallare the determinate kinds. Indeterminate types, the vine types, are also themost common and usually mature in mid- to late season. They grow the biggesttomatoes, take the longest to mature, and last until frost kills them. You canamaze your family and friends by remembering the name of the two different typesthis way: “It is indeterminate how tall the vine types will grow.”STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: Sprouts in one week at 70°F. Sprinkle 5 or so seeds of eachvariety you want to grow in individual cups filled with vermiculite six weeksbefore your last spring frost. Just barely cover with vermiculite and water;move to full sunlight as soon as first shoots appear. Then pot up in seedlingtrays or individual pots as soon as plants are large enough (usually 1 to 3weeks). Keep a careful watch over the plants, especially after transplantingthem into seedling trays, because any check or stoppage of the growth willaffect the ultimate bearing capacity of the plant. Transplanting: Harden offtransplants for one to two weeks, and plant outside on or after your frost-freedate. Plant one vine-type plant per square foot. Bush types are planted in thecenter of a nine square foot area. They take up so much room that I now growonly vine-type varieties. Water and cover with a plastic-covered wire cage forprotection from the cold and wind. Leave the cage on until the plants are atleast 18 inches tall and pushing at the top. Seeds Outdoors: The season is tooshort to start outdoors.GROWINGWatering: Keep water off the plant leaves.Maintenance: Prune off side branches (suckers) weekly for vine types and guideplant tops up through netting. Prune off lower dead or yellow leaves. Keepadding mulch as the season gets hotter.HARVESTINGHow: Gently twist and pull ripe tomatoes so the stem breaks (if it’s ripe itshould easily break away), or even better, cut the stem so as not to disturb therest of the remaining fruit. When: If you’re not going to wait until they’re redand ripe, why grow them yourself? Some gardeners like to pick them just slightlybefore that point (say a day or two) if they want extra-firm tomatoes forsandwiches or a particular dish. If you leave them on the vine too long theywill turn soft and mushy, so inspect daily; it’s one of the pleasures you’vebeen waiting for all year.PREPARING AND USINGThis is a subject fit for an entire book, and in fact many have been written.What can one say in a few paragraphs? Tomatoes can be used in a multitude ofways. You can enjoy plate after plate of sliced tomatoes seasoned with lots ofpepper and sometimes a little mayonnaise; try pouring your favorite saladdressing over that same dish of sliced tomatoes. Soak a plate full in vinegarovernight for the next day’s treat. Add thick slices of fresh tomatoes to anycasserole and enjoy a flavor not experienced the rest of the year. If you have alot of tomatoes, use them fresh in cooking instead of canned tomatoes.PROBLEMSCutworm, whitefly, and the big, bad, but beautiful tomato horn worm; variouswilt diseases.HINTS AND TIPSDon’t let anyone, anytime ever smoke in your garden.

You can see this best by looking at the cut endof a mint stem. Mint plants come in many flavors, such as spearmint, peppermint,apple, lemon, and chocolate, and all mints give off a lovely scent when theleaves are crushed. But beware—mint is invasive. It sends out tough runners thatgrow roots and leaves every few inches, and will crop up anywhere it can. Tokeep mint plants in bounds, cut a 6-inch diameter circle around the plants inlate spring and again in early fall, and pull out any runners outside thecircle. Try not to leave any small pieces in the ground—they too will sprout. Ina Square Foot Garden, sink a 12-inch square or round plastic pail or clay pot inthat square; don’t use a conventional pot with holes on the side or around thebottom. If using a pail, drill some small drainage holes in the bottom. If usinga clay pot, cover the bottom hole with a piece of broken crockery or bottle cap.Pull the entire pot up in the fall and take it inside as a houseplant. Don’t letthis discourage you from growing many different kinds of mints, however, becausethe benefits truly outweigh the extra work.STARTINGLocation: Sun to partial shade.Seeds Indoors: No, does not come true from seed.Transplanting: Plant divisions anytime from spring through fall.Seeds Outdoors: No.GROWINGWatering: Weekly.Maintenance: Cut back to promote bushiness.HARVESTINGHow: Cut mint stems back to a pair of leaves. This is where new branches willform. Use the leaves as a flavoring and sprigs as a garnish.When: Harvest mint anytime after the plant has reached 6 inches tall; do notharvest the leaves of creeping (groundcover) mints.PREPARING AND USINGUse fresh mint leaves in sauces, mint jelly, salads, or to flavor herb teas.Float a sprig of mint in your favorite summer drink, bruising the bottom leavesa little to impart that refreshing flavor. Tuck a sprig of mint into a fruit cupfor color and scent.PROBLEMSMint is basically disease- and pest-free.

Oregano is a native of the Mediterranean area and enjoys lots ofsunshine. It is a pretty plant with round leaves tightly covering the stems.Variegated Oregano is particularly lovely with the leaves edged in white orgold, but the variegated plants are not quite as hardy as the green ones and areused mostly as ornamental plants. Give Oregano frequent trimmings to keep itneat and so you can dry the leaves. It is one of few herbs whose flavor isstronger dried than fresh. When the leaves have dried, crumble them lightly andstore in an airtight container.STARTINGLocation: Full sun.Seeds Indoors: 4 to 6 weeks before last spring frost.Transplanting: Plant divisions anytime after the temperatures reach 45°F.Seeds Outdoors: Spring, after last frost; seeds need light to germinate.GROWINGWatering: Weekly.Maintenance: Water sparingly; too much water will cause root rot. Harvest ortrim mature plants often to keep them in bounds. Divide every 2 to 3 years.HARVESTINGHow: Cut stems back to a pair of leaves. This is where new branches will form.When: Oregano can be harvested anytime during the summer months, but the flavoris best after the buds have formed but just before the flowers open.PREPARING AND USINGOregano loses its distinctive flavor during cooking, so always add it in thelast few minutes. Use Oregano in salads, casseroles, soups, sauces, poultrydishes, and of course, pizza. Dried Oregano has a stronger flavor than fresh andgoes especially well with tomato or rice dishes.PROBLEMSOregano is usually pest- and disease-free.

This getscomplicated. They are grouped into nine sizes based on the diameter of theflower, and 18 classifications of form, from the daisy-like decorative form, topompom, cactus, and the fully double stellar form. Flowers come in every colorexcept blue and green, and multicolors abound. Even the leaves come in colors,from light green to deepest green to burgundy. Plus, they are said to guardneighboring plants against nematodes. There is indeed a dahlia for everyone.Border or dwarf dahlias grow 12 to 24 inches high and rarely need staking.Garden dahlias are in the 2 to 4 foot range, while giant forms have been knownto grow to 10 feet—but not in a Square Foot Garden! Start your own plants fromseed (no guarantee what color you’ll get), or buy roots (called tubers) forspecial, especially showy types. In the fall, dig up the newly formed tubers andstore in a frost-free area until the next spring.Warning: dahlias can be habit-forming. If you get hooked (I did), join yourlocal Dahlia Society and you’ll fit right in!STARTINGLocation: Full sun to partial shade for best results.Seeds Indoors: Start seeds 6 to 8 weeks before last spring frost. Seedlingsemerge in 5 to 21 days.Transplanting: After last frost date.Seeds Outdoors: No, time is too short for seeds, but you can plant tubersanytime after the last frost.GROWINGWatering: Water dahlia tubers when first setting them out, then wait until yousee shoots before watering again unless the soil is unusually dry. This willprevent the tubers from rotting. Once the root system is established and shootsbegin to show, give dahlia plants daily water, especially during the hottestsummer months.Maintenance: When the plant reaches about 3 inches tall, pinch off the growingtip to encourage bushy growth. Mulch dahlias to keep the soil moist. Supporttall varieties. Deadhead to encourage reblooming.Since dahlias are easily grown from seed, you may not want to bother digging upthe tiny tubers of seed-grown plants. Simply start them from seed again nextyear. If you do want to dig up the tubers, after the first frost has killed thefoliage, carefully dig dahlia tubers and let them dry for a few hours. Cut offthe stems, leaving a 2-inch stump, remove excess soil, and store in a box filledwith peat moss or vermiculite, in a cool, frost-free location. Check the dahliaseach month over the winter and discard any rotten tubers. Spray any tubers thatstart to shrivel with warm water.Hint. Be careful of the word “miniature” when purchasing dahlias—it usuallyrefers to the flower size, not the plant size.HARVESTINGHow: Dahlias have hollow stems, and a sticky white substance will ooze from thecut. This is a nutrient that the cut flower needs to stay alive. To preserve theflower, sear the cut end with a match or candle. After searing, prick a hole inthe stem just under the head of the flower. Remove any leaves that will fallbelow the waterline. Dahlias will last 5 to 7 days in a vase.When: Cut dahlias when the flowers are fully open.PROBLEMSEarwigs and slugs; powdery mildew.DUSTY MILLERImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0240-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: DaisyHeight: 12 to 18 inchesSpacing: 4 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: lateSummer: yesFall: yesWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 15 weeks; half-hardy annualSeeds Storage: n/aWeeks to Maturity: 10 weeksIndoor Seed Starting: 10 to 15 weeks before last frostEarliest Outdoor Planting: 2 to 3 weeks before last frostAdditional Plantings: after last frost with other annuals, or not neededLast Planting: not neededDESCRIPTIONOne of my favorites for the Square Foot Garden! The charming dusty miller hasbeen grown by generations of gardeners, and for good reason. The soft, silveryfoliage is a beautiful addition to just about any garden type, from formal tocasual, and the color blends or contrasts with many other leaves and flowers.Its carefree nature, unique color, and interesting texture make it a gardener’sfavorite. There are a few different kinds of dusty miller, mostly distinguishedby the depth of the “cuts” in the foliage—some are scalloped, some are lacy.Dusty miller plants have unattractive mustard-yellow flowers that grow on plantsthat have overwintered. There are other annuals, and even perennials, that areeasily confused with dusty miller. If the plant in question has white daisylikeflowers, it is probably Silver Lace. If it has purple flowers, then it is mostlikely a perennial Centaurea. Regardless of which plant you actually have, enjoyit as a lovely garden accent.STARTINGLocation: Full sun to partial shade.Seeds Indoors: 10 to 15 weeks before last frost; seeds need light to germinate.Transplanting: Dusty miller is unique in that it can be set out into the garden2 to 3 weeks before last frost. Waiting until other annuals are ready to beplanted after the last frost is fine, too.Seed Outdoors: Only in truly frost-free areas as it is a slow grower.GROWINGWatering: Water regularly when young, weekly once established. Even though dustymiller is drought tolerant, it will do best if watered regularly.Maintenance: Dusty miller is fairly hardy and will overwinter in many areas,especially if cut back and mulched in the late fall. Prune second-year plantsback severely to maintain the plant’s shape and remove any flowering stems asthey appear.HARVESTINGCut branches at any time for flower displays.PROBLEMSRot can be a problem in wet soil.

The mostcommon flower colors are orange, yellow, and red/orange bicolor, but they can befound in burgundy, red, and even a creamy white. Flowers can be single, double,or crested, and between 1 and 6 inches in diameter. Marigold leaves aredistinctive—slim and lacy—and give off a pungent scent when cut or crushed.The smaller marigold plants are sometimes called French marigolds, but allmarigolds are native to subtropical America and have been grown in Mexico forthousands of years. The dwarf plants range in size from 6 to 8 inches tall.Don’t be fooled by the name—dwarf refers to the plant size, not necessarily theflower size.The larger marigold plants are known as African marigolds, but like theirsmaller cousins, they are also indigenous to the Americas. Giant marigolds cangrow to over 3 feet tall and are a little too big for a Square Foot Garden.Marigolds are said to discourage nematodes when planted near tomatoes, potatoes,asparagus, strawberries, or roses, especially if they are grown for severalseasons in ground where nematodes are suspected. Marigolds also repel theMexican bean beetle when planted around bean plants. Japanese beetles areattracted to the odorless varieties of marigolds, where they can be trapped anddrowned in soapy water placed near the marigolds.I want to tell you a little story about what is grown around the globe. Wheneverwe do a humanitarian project overseas, people ask me, “How do you know whatcrops they can grow in that country?” I answer, “We specifically tell the peoplewe do not try to compete with the farmer or try to grow the basic things theynormally eat as part of their Square Meter Garden. We tell them, “We are goingto grow new things so your children can have more nutrients and better healththan they now have.” And still we are asked, “But, how do you know those thingswill grow there?”The answer was illustrated when I went to India to attend the grand openingceremonies of Father Abraham’s new Square Foot Garden Training Center. They gaveus garlands of their locally grown special flower—and guess what it was?Marigolds! Even more astounding, broccoli turned out to be their most popularand bestselling vegetable. That made me realize that everything we grow in ourUSA Square Foot Gardens can usually be grown just about anywhere in the world.STARTINGLocation: Grow in a sunny location.Seeds Indoors: Marigold seeds will germinate in about 7 to 14 days, ideal for achild’s first foray into the wonders of growing plants from seeds.Transplanting: After last frost date.Seeds Outdoors: Okay, but usually not practical as the season is too short.GROWINGWatering: Weekly when young, twice weekly when larger. Don’t let marigolds dryout—the plants will wilt and die quickly, and the stress will attract insectsand diseases.Maintenance: Pinch the growing tips back when the plant reaches about 3 inchestall to encourage bushiness. Pinch or cut off spent blooms to prolong flowering.HARVESTINGHow: When thinking of flowers to cut for the vase, marigolds don’t immediatelyspring to mind. However, they make a cute bouquet that can last for 7 to 14days, as long as the stems are not bent. Marigold stems are short, so try to cutwhere the flower stem meets a main stem. Remove the leaves that will be underwater. To reduce the aroma, add a spoonful of sugar to the water.When: Cut marigolds when the flowers are one-half to three-quarters open. Fullyopen marigolds will die quickly in the vase.PROBLEMSSlugs and mites; Botrytis blight and wilt.PANSYImage [../images/dotline.jpg]AT A GLANCEImage [../images/f0243-01.jpg]Botanical InformationFamily: ViolaHeight: 6 to 9 inchesSpacing: 4 per squareGrowing SeasonSpring: yesSummer: if coolFall: yesWinter: noSeed to Harvest/Flower: 20 weeks: short-lived perennialSeeds Storage: n/aWeeks to Maturity: 14 weeksIndoor Seed Starting: 14 to 16 weeks before last frostEarliest Outdoor Planting: early spring or early fallAdditional Plantings: not neededLast Planting: not neededDESCRIPTIONThe best word to describe pansy flowers is “adorable.” The little “faces” lookup at you with hope for a lovely spring after a cold winter, and as a lasthoorah of color in the fall. Even the flowers without the actual black blotcheslook like happy faces. Pansies come in so many colors and color combinationsthat it’s difficult to keep up with the changes and even more difficult tochoose which ones to plant. They are easy to grow, as long as you remember thatthey like cool, moist conditions. When the weather gets hot and dry, plan toeither discard or move your pansies.STARTINGLocation: In hotter areas, look for heat-resistant types and plant in moderateshade. Pansies can be planted in full sun where summers are cool.Seeds Indoors: Growing pansies from seed indoors can be a challenge. Sow indoors14 to 16 weeks before the last frost date. Barely cover the seed, thenrefrigerate for 2 weeks. Once exposed to room temperatures, seeds should sproutin 10 days.Transplanting: Set pansies out in early spring as soon as the ground can beworked, and again in early fall to bring the gardening season to a colorfulclose. In warmer climates, set them out in fall for early spring bloom. SeedsOutdoors: Not practical.GROWINGWatering: Weekly; water more often if the plants wilt and in the heat of thesummer.Maintenance: Keep pansies cool and moist.

Also known as scarlet sage, salvia isactually a member of the mint family, bearing the trademark square stem. Theselovely plants are workhorses in the hot, sunny garden, and are quite droughttolerant once they’re established. Cut the plant back by one-third at plantingtime, to a pair of leaves where you see new sprouts emerging to encouragebushiness, and keep it deadheaded throughout the growing season for a longdisplay of color, texture, and height.STARTINGLocation: Full sun to partial shade.Seeds Indoors: Sow seed indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost.

The ALL NEW Square Foot Gardening System with the latestupdates and improvements I’ve made to the original system I invented thirtyyears ago.In closing, I’d like to highlight the most important features of SFG for you soyou truly understand why it’s so different from the old-fashioned, outdatedsingle-row gardening system we’ve all been taught at one time or another. SquareFoot Gardening is sort of like a picture puzzle of an attractive garden readyfor harvest—and there’s only sixteen large pieces to fit together to produce thefinished picture (that is, the harvest). To produce the same harvest-picture,the single-row garden has 489 tiny pieces to fit together!The features of SFG will help you understand how one thing relates to anotherand how all the simplifications of SFG fit together to help each other produce amuch better garden for you—without a lot of work and knowledge. Here are themost important and far reaching of those features.LOCATIONSince Square Foot Gardening takes only 20 percent of the space to produce 100percent of the harvest, it can be located almost anywhere—and the best locationis close to the house. That’s where you’ll pass it more often, notice andappreciate it more and as a result, you’ll take better care of it. This willproduce a better and more productive garden.SIZEThe same thing applies to protecting your garden from just about anythingharmful, weather and pests being the most destructive; the smaller size makeseverything easier to maintain and control. Size also applies to who can garden;this manageable size means everyone—even those with limited time or energy—canenjoy the benefits of the garden.SOIL REQUIREMENTSWe’ve eliminated all the things you used to have to learn about soil and thespecial requirements for each individual vegetable—because now you’re usingnothing but Mel’s Mix. If you make yours according to the formula and if you usea good blended compost made from at least five ingredients, you’ll have aperfect soil for every single crop in your garden. We won’t have to tell you toscreen for stones, or add extra humus, or that this crop needs a higher pH or awell-drained soil . . . or any of those things that most books have to tell you.You’re starting out with a perfect soil for every single crop. So we don’t haveto give you different or special directions about soil for every single plant.LOCATION FOR SUNLIGHTAll the vegetables need lots of sun: six to eight hours per day. If any of yourgarden area gets more sun than other areas, that’s the place to put your warmweather or summer crops. The spring and fall cool weather crops can get by withless sun, and in fact will do better in the summer if they do not have as muchsun as the other summer crops. Of course, if your entire garden gets the sameamount of sunlight, plant cool weather crops in the partial shade of a tallerplant—or provide them with one of the simple sun shades described in Chapter 4[ch04.html#ch04].FERTILIZERWe don’t use fertilizer anymore. We don’t need it. Mel’s Mix—with its richcompost—has all the natural nutrients, trace elements, and minerals that any ofthe plants could possibly want. You won’t need to learn that this plant needsextra nitrogen or that plant needs extra potassium—because Mel’s Mix haseverything each plant needs, and it is readily available for them. Those thatneed it, take it. Those that don’t need it, don’t take it. It’s that simple;it’s that easy. You won’t have to learn anything about fertilizer or the variousformulas or what NPK means . . . you won’t have to go to the store to buyfertilizer at all. Think of the time and money you’ll save! The best part—it’sall natural and organic. Is that easy gardening or what?But besides all that, you’re going to have a perfect garden because you’restarting with a perfect soil. I’m sure you are tired of hearing about it, butthe value and importance of the proper soil mix cannot be overemphasized. Afteryou become successful with your garden and begin helping others start their newSFG, please be as emphatic as I am about the proper soil mix. It virguallyguarantees success.WATERINGThe same goes for watering. The general directions for watering in the SquareFoot Garden are to make sure the soil stays moist, and give the plants as muchwater as they need. Although that sounds nebulous at first, you will soon becomeacclimated to those directions, and you’ll know which plants require more. (Ofcourse, it all depends on size, season, weather, and the growth pattern of thatparticular plant.) Anyone can see that a large bushy plant needs much more thana young seedling just starting. No matter what method of watering you use,another important feature of Mel’s Mix is that you or your sprinkler systemcan’t overwater, because this mix drains out all the excess water.PESTS AND DISEASESWe also won’t go into any detail of possible pests and diseases of eachindividual plant. I’ve had gardeners tell me that when they read a long list ofpotential threats, they often decide they don’t want to grow that crop—andthat’s a shame, because in all likelihood, they’ll never see that pest ordisease.I think you have seen by now that SFG is not about all the problems and diseasesof plant growth, it is about healthy productive plants growing in a gardenstarting with healthy natural soil. As we explained in an earlier chapter, ifyou have a problem or some pests (if you can first identify or describe it),call your local county extension agent and describe it. They can not only tellyou what it is, but how to get rid of it. In addition, they know your expectedfrost dates and the best varieties to grow in your local area.Our feeling, of course, is that with your natural rich soil, you won’t have mostproblems; the plants will grow healthy and they’ll be much more resistant to anydisease or pest.WHEN TO PLANTCharts in this Appendix will give you all of the information you need to knowabout when to plant both seeds or seedlings, indoors or out. They also indicatewhen to replant an additional crop in order to have a continuous harvest throughthe gardening year.HOW MUCH TO PLANTUse extreme caution here. Remember, this is not single-row gardening where youusually plant one row of everything. Start out by asking yourself, “How much doI really want to harvest (not plant) in the time period that this crop will beready?”For example, a planting of broccoli will all be ready to harvest over a periodof just a couple of weeks in late spring (after that it will go to seed). So ifyou only want to have two heads a week, then plant no more than four or fiveplants for that two-week harvest period. Don’t forget broccoli is a cool weathercrop, so you get to plant it again in the fall, which has a longer harvestperiod since it’s getting colder rather than warmer.)For crops that give you a continuous harvest like Swiss chard, parsley,tomatoes, or pole beans, grow only enough plants to give you as much as you wantto harvest each week. You don’t have to feed the neighborhood—although sometimesyou have to offer a few tomatoes in order to get rid of your zucchini.SPECIFIC QUESTIONSIf you’re the kind of person who needs to know everything you can find out aboutthe plant and its planting, growing, and harvesting patterns in your area, thenit would be wise to call the county agricultural extension agent. Ask them fortheir leaflet on whatever crop you’re interested in—they have more than enoughprinted information on just about every single crop.The only thing you have to be careful about is they’re still teaching single-rowgardening, unfortunately. All the literature that the government spends all thatmoney on printing still shows the hand-me-down row system from farming, so youhave to be wise enough after reading this book to interpret those differencesand convert them into the Square Foot method. It won’t change anything; it’lljust make it much easier. For example, you won’t have to thin seedlings orimprove soil by adding this or that special kind of fertilizer or hoe weeds ordo all the other things we used to have to learn or do. So just strike that outfrom any literature you get from your county agent.HARVESTING METHODBe gentle when you harvest if you’re picking something with a stem, like apepper, tomato, squash or even peas and beans. Cut the stem with your gardenscissors while you hold the fruit with the other hand. Remember, with SFG ourplants are growing in a very loose and friable soil, so it’s important to becareful and not tug or yank on the plant.Since you won’t be overburdened with too much harvest in your SFG, you can takeyour time and enjoy the actual harvest. It’s a happy conclusion to growingplants and should be quite different from the old days of row gardening. Backthen, you had to move fast to pick a whole thirty-foot row of bush beans,twisting and yanking the beans off. Then you had to get the hoe out again tofinish the morning’s work of weeding! Harvesting the SFG way is kind of like thedifference between loading sand bags in the truck versus putting the children intheir car seat.For leaf crops where you’re picking individual leaves or stems—like lettuce,spinach, Swiss chard, or parsley—do the same thing. Cut the leaf or stem withyour scissors, then place it in your salad bowl or harvest basket. A lot offolks like to dip their harvest in the water bucket to wash it off—you could usea colander as your harvest basket. Then you can wash off your harvest right inthe garden and any water and soil will fall right back into the garden. Whichone of the three Rs is that?HARVESTING AND EATINGThere are so many different ideas and recipes that I just want to encourage youto spend more time harvesting and using the produce. You have the time becauseyour garden is no longer a lot of work. Eat more things raw and fresh right outof the garden. You’ll find yourself growing slimmer by the day as you fill up onall these goodies from the garden. When you do cook, I would encourage you touse less fat, leave the meat out, and sauté and broil more often. Try not tocook in water and, of course, if you get the entire family to start out byeating half of the harvest raw and directly from the garden, you’ll find thatnot only your family life will improve, but the kids will eat morevegetables—more often than you could ever imagine. Try a family picnic suppersome day—held right in the garden. See who can make the most unusual salad!We just had a letter from a schoolteacher quoting a student who said, “I’venever eaten a radish before, now I grow them and love them.” More important,that student takes an interest in his garden, and derives a sense ofaccomplishment and pride from his efforts. It works for families too—the wholeidea of SFG is to make gardening a family-oriented, healthy, happy hobby.A WORD ABOUT PLANT FAMILIESI’ve mentioned all through this book how I feel that all of your plants are justlike your children and should be treated as such. So it’s fun and worthwhile tovisit some of the plant families and get to know them a little better. Somemembers of different families will surprise you—like lettuce. Wouldn’t you thinkthat would be in the leafy vegetable family? But no, it’s in the sunflowerfamily . . . And what about celery? It’s in the carrot family!There’s a lot you can learn from this. You can see that in the Nightshadefamily, all the members belong to the hot weather or summer crop; so they allneed the same requirements and conditions of growing. (Check the “At a Glance”feature for more important facts to know about some of the vegetables, flowers,and herbs you might be growing in your SFG.) If you become familiar with theplant families you won’t have to learn and digest as much information aboutindividual crops because, for example, all plants in the same family have thesame pests, diseases, and problems related to growing (not that we expect toencounter any of that in our natural and rich Mel’s Mix soil). Each familymember usually has the same frost resistance and is in the same cool or warmweather category. In addition, they all require pretty much the same type ofcare. So if you learn the families and the care of each family, you’ll have amore satisfying garden experience.CHART OF PLANT FAMILIES AND MEMBERSCarrotCarrotCeleryParsleyParsnipGoosefootBeetSpinachSwiss ChardGourdCucumberGourdCantaloupePumpkinSquashWatermelonGrassCornLilyAsparagusMallowOkraMustardBok ChoyBroccoliBrussel SproutsCabbageChinese CabbageCauliflowerCollardsCressKaleHorseradishKohlrabiMustard GreensRadishRutabagaTurnipNightshadeEggplantPepperPotatoTomatoOnionChiveGarlicLeekOnionShallotPeaBeansPeasSunflowerEndiveChicoryGlobe ArtichokeJerusalem ArtichokeLettuceSunflowerCONCLUSIONThese are just a few of my favorites of the multitude of flowers, vegetables,and herbs you can grow in your Square Foot Garden. Can you visualize howattractive a quilt-like garden can be when you plant something different inevery square foot? Can you see how little you really have to know about plantsand gardening to be successful? Start small and expand as you gain experienceand success. Then spread the word and help others start their own SFG.So good luck with your garden—and please let me know how you’re doing.

A civil engineer by profession and frustrated gardener byweekend, Bartholomew was convinced unmanageable single-row gardening was a wasteof energy and output. After his research yielded responses such as “but that’sthe way we’ve always done it,” Bartholomew condensed the unmanageable single-rowspace to 4 × 4 feet, amended the soil, and bingo . . . he developed a gardeningsystem that yields 100% of the harvest in 20% of the space.Bartholomew’s Square Foot Method quickly gained popularity and strength,ultimately converting more than one million gardeners worldwide. “Square FootGardening,” the highest-rated PBS gardening show to date, launched in 1981 andran weekly for five years, followed later by a weekly Square Foot Show on theDiscovery Network. In 1986 the creation of the Square Foot Gardening Foundationand the “A Square Yard in the School Yard Program” brought the technique to anestimated 3,000 schools nationwide.As fan mail and testimonials from thousands of gardeners across the countryarrived, Bartholomew realized that his Square Foot Method was relevant on aglobal scale. Converted into Square Meter Gardening, Bartholomew seized anopportunity to bring the dietary benefits of his revolutionary system tomillions of malnourished Third World citizens. His global humanitarian effort,orchestrated through the Square Meter International Training Centers in Lehigh,Utah and Homestead, Florida, trained international humanitarian organizationsand leaders in the Square Meter Method. Since its launch, Bartholomew’s globaloutreach initiative has spread from Africa to Asia to South America and isrecognized as a resounding success by nonprofit human interest groups.And there are no signs of slowing down. Bartholomew’s global outreach continuesthroughout the world while closer to home, attention has shifted to increasingthe Square Foot presence in the California school system. Bartholomew isdetermined to continue and strengthen the well established Square Foot programsand institutions across the nation and the globe.Bartholomew operates his nonprofit Square Foot Gardening foundation in Eden,Utah."},{"pageContent":"Copyright © 1981, 2011 Mel Bartholomew; Revised and Additional Content Copyright© 2005, Mel BartholomewAll Rights Reserved.
