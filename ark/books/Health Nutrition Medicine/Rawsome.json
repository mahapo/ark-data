Thanks to my publisher, Norman Goldfind, who thought Rawsome! would be a great project, for all his support of my work. Thanks as well to editor Nancy Ringer and copyeditor Kate Herman. Gratitude to Carol and Gary Rosenberg for all their help. Juliano, I'm so glad we met. Thank you for feeding your wonderful food to Rainbeau, and for enhancing her health. You are truly a beautiful, generous spirit and your message will resonate worldwide. David Wolfe, you rock, you inspire, you are a man on fire. Jeremy Safron, as soon as I met you, I wanted to know, \"What's this man about?\" Thank you, Victoria and Igor Boutenko, for the great workshops, clear message, and loving light. Anyone who thinks raw people are frail should try a massage from Igor. Tom Pfeiffer, thank you so much for taking this journey with me. Had I gone raw all by myself, it would have been a lonely path. Having you to make beautiful food for, your generous help in the kitchen and my classes, and your endearments and praise about all of it make my life truly blessed. 1 love you more than ever and find you amazingly beautiful, after twenty-five years.

While livng in Miami, I first tried going on a raw diet in the mid- 1970s, having been inspired by Viktoris Kulvinskas's Survival into the Twenty-Virst Century, one of the earliest books to advo- cate raw foods. But back then, the only organic produce widely available was carrots and apples, and most natural foods stores didn't carry produce at all. After moving to Colorado, when I would talk about being raw, peo- ple would look at me with blank expressions. Most had never heard of it, and they didn't think it was a good idea. \"It's too cold in Colorado,\" they protested. \"You can't live on uncooked food during the winter. You need hot, cooked food to warm you up.\" So, after a few months, I let go of the idea. Over the following years, I studied macrobiotics, herbal medicine, Ori- ental medicine, vitamin therapy, flower essences, and homeopathy. Eventual- ly, I began to teach classes on natural medicine at institutions such as Naropa University, Boulder College of Massage, and Esalen. I became the herbalist for one of the nation's largest natural foods stores, and for thirteen years I promoted multitudes of remedies, potions, pills, and tinctures. I began a pri- vate practice and wrote scores of magazine articles and several books. During all this time, my family—my husband, Tom, and my two daughters, Rainbeau and Sunflower—followed what I thought was a healthy vegetarian lifestyle. We ate organic food whenever possible, though almost all of it, with the exception of the occasional salad, was cooked. As the years went by, my lovely children became complicated teenagers. I sin rendered to serving whole-wheat bagels, pasta dishes, veggie burgers, home-cooked vegetarian chili, and other things I was glad they would eat. \"At least it's organic!\" I would say to myself."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"RaWsome When Sunflower and Rainbeau admitted to me that they were some- times eating meat at their friends' houses, I wasn't pleased, but I appreciat- ed their honesty and decided that it would be better if I prepared an organically raised, free-range chicken once a week than for my daughters to eat lord-knows-what lord-knows-where. Although I had then been vege- tarian for twenty-three years, I actually felt energized consuming some ani- mal protein. My children grew up and moved out. Middle-aged and pudgy, I found myself making organic cakes and chocolate-chip cookies (with organic sugar), meat, and quick-cooking rice once a week. We had some wild greens with many meals and felt healthy about that. The truth was, however, that I still struggled with skin breakouts and was getting heavier despite skip- ping dinners and drinking \"natural\" diet shakes. Meanwhile, Tom fre- quently had digestive problems that caused him sleepless nights. In 1996, Rainbeau, an aspiring actress, was cast in her first movie. She flew to Memphis for the filming and found herself having a great time with Woody Harrelson and his brother Brett, both of whom were into raw foods, yoga, and environmental issues. Rainbeau dropped out of college and soon moved to Hollywood, like many young hopefuls, to pursue dreams of fame and fortune. On one occasion when I was visiting Rainbeau, we ran into Juliano, an energetic young chef, in a natural foods store in Santa Monica. He gave her a flyer for a raw potluck. Soon after, she called us in Colorado to say, \"I've gone raw! Juliano is my new housemate. He has written a book called Raw and says, 'Get your mom down here. She'll get raw.'\" \"Not very likely,\" I thought. \"I know too much.\" I had studied way too long and knew all about \"cold, damp spleen,\" \"excess yin,\" and how eat- ing tropical fruits can make you \"ungrounded and spaced out.\" My biggest concern was that Rainbeau was going to become anorexic, like some of the models and actresses one reads about. Tom and I had planned a trip to Los Angeles to attend the Natural Products Expo, the major convention for the natural foods industry. We hoped to talk some sense into Rainbeau. On our first night in L.A., Juliano was hosting one of his huge raw dinners, and we were invited. Tom was apprehensive about how his stomach would handle such fare, and I was worried that the meal would be insubstantial; I told Tom we could always go out for Mexican food afterward if we were still hungry. We were served a raw, vegetarian \"meatloaf\" with cauliflower mashed potatoes. We drank Preface \\i coconut water. It was all amazingly delicious and satisfying. Tom's stomach was blissfully peaceful, and we had to admit that Rainbeau looked health- ier and more beautiful than ever. When we left the dinner, my worries were eased, and I felt grateful for Juliano. The next day, Rainbeau and I left for Anaheim to attend the conven- tion, while Tom had business to attend to in L.A. Rather than walking rhrough the convention and tasting every free sample of tofu hot dog, organic chocolate bar, and frozen vegan pizza, 1 noticed that very little of the \"health food\" was raw, and that one-third of the show was devoted to vitamins and herbal remedies. Did one relate to the other? \"Natural\" foods might be good, but obviously they had not brought us perfect health! Mac- aroni and cheese in a box, though whole wheat and organic, was still processed food. When Tom and I returned to Boulder, I decided that I would be raw for a year to support Rainbeau. Surprisingly, Tom loved the food and would sit down to meals saying, \"You're saving me.\" His digestion improved so much. As for me, after about a month, I felt better than I had in twenty years. After about three months, I experienced a bit of a detox reaction: my skin broke out worse than it had in years, but then it got better than ever. We both felt more energetic. We needed less sleep. We felt infused with positive, vibrant energy. We sponsored David Wolfe, author of The Sunfood Diet Success Sys- tem, to teach a one-day workshop in our courtyard. We were amazed at how quickly the workshop was filled, with barely any effort on our part. It was also delightful that making lunch for the sixty-five attendees was so easy, when I remembered the stress and toil of cooking a dinner party menu for ten! As time passed, my teaching of herbal medicine changed. 1 wanted to talk about raw foods. The raw foods diet seemed to have so much in com- mon with natural medicines. I found that many of my herbal allies, such as dandelion greens and violet blossoms, made great additions to raw salads and fresh green juices. I came to realize that diet—next to spirit—was the most potent healer of all. I've been completely raw since 2001. When I went to the Natural Prod- ucts Expo this year, people who knew me saw a real difference. \"What have you been doing?\" they asked. \"You look younger! More slender! Your skin is great!\" In the three and a half years of being raw, my bone density has tested at excellent levels, and both my husband and I have tested for hav-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"RaWsome! ing excellent levels of antioxidants. Tom has had his eyeglass prescription reduced three times. His eye doctor is amazed, saying this usually doesn't happen to men in their fifties! Being raw continues to bring health, happiness, and a multitude of blessings and synchronicities into my life. I am forever grateful for the rev- elation of raw. I wonder what took me so long. After so many years of searching for remedies for illnesses, I found a beautiful way to prevent them. It amazes me how something so simple, something that saves time, money, and natural resources, could have such a positive effect in my life. What's more amazing is that everyone isn't doing it! Now a trip to the grocery store yields four bags of groceries, rather than one or two, for $50. We feel great. We're sticking with the program. And with this book, I invite you to revel with us in the beautiful, simple power of raw foods. ou may already have heard about the raw foods diet. You may have picked up this book to find out more, because you can't quite believe that the diet is really as good as they say. Or, you may never have heard about the diet, and you've picked up this book because you can't quite believe that anyone would be foolish enough to propose such a thing. Well, fad diets come and go, but the raw foods diet is not a fad—it's been around for thousands of years—and it's not going anywhere—espe- cially after you, my friends, have tried it and begun to feel the incredible energizing effect it has on your body and spirit. For the uninitiated, under- taking and sticking with the raw foods diet might seem like a daunting task; but having been raw since 2001, I am convinced that it's one of the best things I've ever done. Every week I discover new reasons to love being raw. Here are a few of the advantages to consider. The dishes prepared with raw foods recipes are absolutely delicious. The vibrant flavor is inherent to the foods themselves; they require fewer additives such as salt, spices, oils, and sweeteners. Every major health organization in this country (including the Ameri- can Cancer Society and the American Heart Institute) recommends that we eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily. On the raw foods diet, five servings is generally just a baseline—you may find yourself eating much more. Raw foods have more nutrients and fibers than cooked foods do. Enzymes in raw foods are active, not having been deactivated through the application of heat, and they support the overall health of the body. No bottled supplement or prepackaged food can compare with the life force of fresh, raw food. I"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"1 RauJsome! Raw foods are digested easily and quickly, in 24-36 hours as opposed to 48-100 hours for cooked food. Your body's vitality won't be sapped from breaking down hard-to-digest foods. A raw foods diet strengthens the immune system, thereby preventing ill- ness and helping you overcome nagging ailments. The raw path has been used to improve the health of those with arthritis, asthma, high blood pres- sure, cancer, diabetes, digestive disturbances, menstrual problems, allergies, obesity, psoriasis, skin conditions, heart disease, diverticulitis, weakened immunity, depression, and hormonal imbalances. On a raw diet, degenera- tive diseases often disappear. The aging process can slow. Bad breath and body odor can go away. Eyes will become brighter and the voice more clear. Skin and muscle tone will improve. Memory and concentration can become sharper. You'll feel better, have more energy, and need less sleep. (It is also more difficult to camouflage spoilage in raw foods than in cooked foods, so you are much less likely to get food poisoning.) In addition, by following a raw foods diet, you can easily normalize your weight without restricting food intake. Those extra pounds you've been trying to lose will melt away, without your having to go hungry, and your body will maintain its optimal weight for as long as you stay raw. Imagine never having to clean the oven! Dirty dishes can simply go in the dishwasher after a simple rinse—no more baked-on grease that requires soaking and scrubbing. Grease won't collect on the walls, stovetop, or ceil- ing, either, and you'll find that gentle, biodegradable cleansers really work. You'll spend less time in the kitchen and less money in the grocery store. In fact, when you're on a raw foods diet, you'll spend from 25 to 80 percent less money on food. Less land is required to produce fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and other plant-source foods than is required to produce animal products. And by focusing your spending on organic produce, you can encourage good stewardship of the earth. Think of all the energy that would be saved if more people ate raw food: less fuel, packaging, and pollution! Instead of being trash, most of what is now thrown away could be composted and given back to the earth to create new life. Eating raw food is a manifestation of care for, and consciousness of, the next generation. The raw movement is the future. And if you can expe- rience a higher state of consciousness, have better health, eat more deli- cious food, and save time, money, and the planet's resources, why not say yes to raw? raw foods diet is exactly that: raw foods. No cooking, no grilling, no steaming, no application of heat of any kind. Why? Because eat- ing food that is closest to its natural state engenders a tremendous exchange of energy between food and body. The result, over time, is a feel- ing of buoyant, radiant health. What is the difference between raw and vegetarian or vegan? A vege- tarian is one who abstains from eating meat from any animal, including birds and fish. A vegan is one who abstains from eating any animal prod- uct, including meat, eggs, and milk. A raw foods diet is predominantly raw vegan. (Some raw practitioners include raw dairy products. Others even include raw meat, although this book does not encourage that practice.) Raw foods are still \"living,\" in a manner of speaking. They may be dehy- drated, frozen, or fermented, but at no time have they been heated to a tem- perature over 110°F. Their enzymes and nutrients are intact. If you set these foods in their whole form into soil and watered them, many would sprout. THE DETRIMENTS OF MEAT Most raw foodists do not eat meat, for both physiological and environ- mental reasons. The primary reasons are that meat is hard to digest and that it diminishes the vitality of the body. In nature, true carnivores don't really chew meat much, as their digestive tracts have such high concentrations of hydrochloric acid that meat swal- lowed whole can be digested. Human digestive systems, however, have much lower levels of hydrochloric acid, which means that meat is harder for us to digest and must be chewed well before being swallowed. The liver and kidneys must work overtime in digesting meat, which can adversely affect their health."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"I RauJsome! Also, the flesh that we consume contains uric acid, and the body must draw upon its alkaline reserves to neutralize this acid. (If not neutralized, uric acid contributes to the development of health problems such as gout and arthritis.) When one eats a meat-heavy diet, the bloodstream and other tissues and organs become more acidic. The body attempts to buffer the acidity by pulling calcium from its bones. This leaching of calcium, in com- bination with the high levels of phosphorus found in meats, contributes to a loss of bone density. Most flesh foods also contain high levels of fats, which carry toxins and elevate cholesterol levels. Livestock consume 50 percent of our nation's water supply and 80 per- cent of our grain. Twenty pounds of fodder (forage and grain) is required to produce 1 pound of meat. That same 1 pound of meat also requires 2,500 gallons of water, compared to only 25 gallons required to produce 1 pound of wheat. Meanwhile, half a million animals are killed for meat every hour in the United States. At one time, humans needed meat to survive. We did not stay in one place long enough to grow enough food to support ourselves. We did not have the means to preserve fresh foods so that they would last through the winter. We did not enjoy the luxury of global transportation, by which fresh foods are made available all year long. But we have so many more healthful and environmentally conscious options today. Are we to stay bound to the hard realities of the past? Or will we let the evolution of our culture and technology guide our food choices toward a more healthful way of eating? If you do eat meat, consider purchasing it from farmers and ranchers who raise free-range animals on organic feeds. And you can easily stay open to the health and pleasure of raw foods, incorporating them whenev- er possible into your meals. THE DETRIMENTS OF COOKING What do you think would happen if you fed a gorilla coffee, grilled meat, boiled vegetables, and doughnuts? If you subjected your hand or your gar- den to torching, boiling, or baking, would it be improved in any way? Intu- itively, we understand that fresh foods are necessary for our nutrition, and that the application of heat destroys the vitality of just about every living component. In our day-to-day life, however, we have been trained to think of our meals as being mostly cooked foods. How has that come to be? The predominance of cooked food harkens back to our nomadic days, What Is RavO—And What Is Not> when meat was the most important element of our diet. Cooking meal destroyed bacteria, and smoking or curing meat allowed it to be kept for long periods of time. We needed fire for warmth and protection; we grew accustomed to warm foods and hot drinks. These habits have been carried forward through generations to today. Food industries have little interest in researching and marketing raw foods. Profit margins are lower for foods in their natural state than for foods that are processed and packaged. Did you ever notice that most food advertisements are for junk food? It is rare to see an ad for Vermont apples or California oranges, though we are inundated daily with a media barrage of sugary cereals, fatty burgers, deep-fried chips, and aspartame-filled sodas. We are also subjected to scores of ads for drugs to remedy our ail- ments. It's funny—many of the ailments that we need these drugs for are caused by the very foods we are encouraged to eat. The reason that cooked food smells so appealing is that its flavors and nutrients are being evaporated by the heat and are passing from the food into the air. But once the food is cooked, it then requires lots of salt, sweet- ener, spices, and fat to make it taste better. Steamed vegetables (ostensibly among the healthiest of cooked foods) are usually heated to about 212°F Unfortunately, many vitamins lose potency at a mere 130°F. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are destroyed in cooking. High temperatures decrease levels of vitamin C and most of the B-complex vitamins in food. The loss of vitamin B| from cooking can be from 25 to 45 percent, and B 2 loss can be from 40 to 48 percent. Similarly, cooked food loses enzymes, which begin to be destroyed at 116°E Cooking also causes the minerals in food to leach out into the water in which it is cooked, and causes mineral salts to become degenerated, deanimated, and inorganic. Cooking disrupts the structure of indoles, which are anticancer compounds found in many fresh produce items. In addition, cooking produces free radicals in foods (and especially in oils). Free radicals are unpaired, charged molecules that cause cellular destruction and are thought to be the primary environmental cause of aging. The higher the cooking temperature, the more free radicals created. Proteins start breaking down under the application of heat. According to studies in Germany at the Max Planck Institute for Nutritional Research, well-cooked proteins have only 50 percent bioavailability. Proteins start becoming denatured at 161°F. Denatured proteins are not usable by the body and have been linked to disorders including heart disease, cancer, and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"6 Rautsome! arthritis. Cooking coagulates the proteins in food and causes them to become deaminated. The amino acids lysine and glutamine are both destroyed by cooking; and when the amino acid methionine is heated, it begins to inhibit the production of hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying mole- cule in red blood cells). When greens that are high in oxalic acid (beet greens, collard greens, rhubarb stalks, Swiss chard, lamb's-quarter, purslane, sorrel, and spinach) are cooked, the oxalic acid combines with calcium, iron, and magnesium; over the long term, ingesting cooked oxalic acid impedes the absorption of calcium and iron by the body. When oxalic acid is consumed in raw rather than cooked foods, however, this effect is minimalized. Cooking damages fats, changing them into trans-fatty acids that impede cellular respiration and that can be a factor in heart disease and cancer. When heated, the fats in oils adversely affect the skin, leading to clogged pores, acne, and eczema. Excessive use of cooked oils also causes cravings for stimulants like alcohol and caffeine and can lead one to feel unclean, depressed, and heavy. Cooking softens food fibers, which can hamper intestinal motility. Cooked fibers become demagnetized and leave a slimy coating on the intes- tines. In fact, you are more likely to have gas, heartburn, and bloating after a cooked meal than after a raw one. Cooked carbohydrates become caramelized and dextrinized, and are known to increase body weight. A diet of cooked foods requires the body to devote more energy toward digestion and elimination. When you eat cooked foods, you are more like- ly to feel fatigued, groggy, and hungry the next morning. The eliminative system (the pores, lungs, kidneys, and bowels; see \"The Channels of Elim- ination\" on page 15) becomes congested and overworked, leading to states of disease. Because cooking depletes the nutrients in foods, it is more diffi- cult to feel satisfied by eating them; therefore, overeating and obesity become the norm. Eating cooked food causes an immediate increase in white blood cell production and causes a pathogenic leukocytosis. In addition, after a typi- cal cooked-foods meal, red blood cells tend to clump together. When the clumps reach the capillaries (where blood from the arteries delivers oxygen to the body's cells and enters the veins), circulation in these tiny vessels becomes clogged. On June 28, 2002, The Washington Post reported on a Swedish study finding that acrylamide, a chemical known to cause cancer in animals and What Is Rati—And What Is Noti 7 listed by the World Health Organization as a probable carcinogen in humans, is produced in foods when certain combinations of fats and car- bohydrates (such as the mixture in French fries and potato chips) are heat- ed to temperatures greater than 248°F. \"We found the substance at levels [in these foods] that, if it was just one product, we would ask that it be immediately taken off the market,\" stated Leif Busk, head of the Research and Development Department of the Swedish National Food Administra- tion. Raw and boiled foods, on the other hand, were found not to contain acrylamide. The free radicals, toxins, and loss of nutrients that result from cooking contribute to aging, bloating, depression, weight gain, cellulite, hair loss, wrinkles, anxiety, and puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Do you want to feel baked, fried, cooked, and toasted? Or would you rather feel fresh, alive, radiant, and vital?"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"A catalyst is a substance that enables a chemical reaction to take place, usually at a faster rate or under different circumstances (such as at a lower temperature) than is otherwise possible. In 1878, the German physician, philosopher, and physiology professor Willy Kuhne coined the word \"enzyme\" to specify a biocatalyst (a living catalyst) originating out- side a living cell. We now know, however, that enzymes exist in all living things and in each of our cells. In fact, enzymes are the \"living sparks\" needed for every chemical action and reaction in the body. Over 3,000 enzymes have so far been identified, and researchers believe that many thousands more are yet to be discovered. Minerals, vitamins, and hormones cannot work except in the presence of enzymes; enzymes help synthesize, join, and duplicate entire chains of amino acids. Breathing, sleeping, eating, digestion, nutrient absorption, thinking, moving, working, growing, blood coagulation, immunity, think- ing, dreaming, sexual activity, excitement, reproduction, and sensory per- ception are all dependent on enzymes. Enzyme therapy has been used to treat arthritis, autism, autoimmune disorders, bruises, contusions, cystic fibrosis, fat intolerance, inflammation, multiple sclerosis, pain, pancreatic insufficiency, shingles, sports injuries, varicose veins, and viral infections. Enzymes are cancer's enemy as well: they break away the protective fibrin around cancer cells, make the cells less sticky (thereby preventing metasta- sis, which is the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body), and alert the immune system to their presence. Although enzymes are themselves composed of tiny proteins, which, in turn, are made of amino acids, they cannot be synthetically reproduced. (Most of the pharmaceutical enzymes available are derived from pig 9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"II) RauJsome! pancreas.) Enzymes can be divided into two basic categories: exogenous (introduced from outside the body) and endogenous (produced in the body). For years, nutritionists were taught that exogenous enzymes in food had no more nutritional or digestive value than their amino acid content because stomach acid would break down the enzymes before they could be absorbed. However, a recent study conducted by W. A. Hemmings of the University College of North Wales indicates that a significant amount of dietary protein (that is, exogenous enzymes) is actually absorbed into the body intact (that is, not broken down into its amino acid components). When food is consumed, acid secretion is very low for the first thirty min- utes or so. As food sits in the upper section of the stomach, the exogenous enzymes aid in their own digestion, which enables the body to do less work later. After thirty to forty-five minutes, the bottom portion of the stomach opens, and the body secretes its own endogenous enzymes and acids. Even at that point, exogenous enzymes are not inactivated until the acid level becomes prohibitive, which can take up to an hour. Decreased enzyme activity has been found to contribute to chronic con- ditions such as allergies, skin disease, diabetes, and cancer. It also results in weight gain, lethargy, inflammation, digestive impairment, and loss of skin elasticity and muscle tone—which are all symptoms of aging. In 1946, James Summer, M.D., winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry, claimed that the \"middle-aged feeling\" was due to diminished enzymes. The author of Enzyme Nutrition, Edward Howell, M.D., seemed to offer proof of this theory: Dr. Howell said that by age fifty, people usually have only 30 per- cent of their endogenous enzymes left. A decrease in the quantity and quality of our endogenous enzymes is a natural result of aging. The typical Western lifestyle and diet also deplete the body of enzymes, thus rushing us headlong toward premature aging. Alco- hol, drugs, tobacco, carcinogenic exposure, radiation, excessive sunlight, chlorine, fluoride, many medications, and stimulants draw enzymes from our limited endogenous supply—but cooked food is the primary culprit in this depletion. Enzymes are fragile: light, heat, and pressure can deactivate them. In fact, many are completely destroyed at temperatures exceeding 118°F, which means that the exogenous enzymes in foods are destroyed by cooking. Because cooked food lacks active enzymes of its own, the body must produce more endogenous enzymes in order to digest it. When raw food is consumed, on the other hand, its enzymes assist in the preliminary digestive process. Raw foods not only introduce exogenous Why Go RaW> u Enzyme Activity We've learned about the two main categories of enzymes, exogenous and endogenous. Endogenous enzymes are further classified into digestive and meta- bolic subgroups. The functions of these groups can be generalized as follows: Exogenous Enzymes In its raw state, each food contains the enzymes needed for its own digestion. These food enzymes are exogenous. They include protease (which breaks pro- tein chains into smaller amino acid chains and finally into individual amino acids), amylase (which breaks carbohydrates into simple sugars), lipase (which breaks fats into free fatty acids and glycerol), lactase (which breaks down milk sugars), and cellulase (which breaks the bonds in fibrous foods). Endogenous Enzymes—Digestive and Metabolic Digestive enzymes are endogenous, being produced mainly in the pancreas and to some degree in the stomach and small intestines. They include trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin. Their function is to break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into nutrients that are more readily available to the body. These endogenous enzymes affect the tissues and organs of the body, facilitating functions such as movement and speech. Metabolic enzymes use the nutrients absorbed from food for important bodily processes including tis- sue repair and regeneration. enzymes to the body but also provide the nutrients that allow, or trigger, endogenous enzymes to function. Therefore, a large portion of a raw meal is partially digested before it reaches the lower stomach, and fewer endoge- nous enzymes and acids are needed for its further digestion and absorption. Conserving enzymes contributes to staying youthful—and the raw foods diet is one means of enzyme conservation. WEIGHT MANAGEMENT The good news for many of us is that raw foods enable us to eat delicious food and still achieve and maintain our optimal weight. By comparison, the typical Western diet and lifestyle seem to encourage overeating and tend to lead to obesity; in the United States, this has become a national health problem. Overeating has many psychological causes, including stress,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12 RaWsome! emotional insecurity, and depression, but it also can have a physical com- ponent: that is, the body's incessant craving for nutritional satisfaction that it never receives from processed foods. Cooking destroys so many nutrients that you have to eat more food in order to get the nutrients you need. If your food is raw, you can eat eight to ten times less than you would if you were eating cooked food, and still satisfy your body's needs. But that doesn't mean you have to go hungry on a raw foods diet—on the contrary. Raw foods contain so much water, fiber, and general bulk that they fill you up faster than cooked foods do. They also energize you, making it easier to get involved in activities that get you up off the couch and strengthen your muscles and your mind. In general, a raw foods diet tends to bring body weight to equilibrium, or to its optimal state. When my husband and I started eating raw, he gained weight, and 1 lost weight—while we were both eating basically the same food and the same portion sizes! You can expect to get healthier and more toned with raw foods. It's important to remember, of course, that optimal weight means different things for different people: we each have a unique, natural shape and size. Losing Weight When you're trying to lose weight, a diet of raw foods can certainly help. In general, you'll be consuming fewer fats and starches, which are the main cul- prits in weight gain, and you'll have more energy, so it will be easier to exer- cise. Exercise can improve posture, circulation, elimination, and oxygen intake, and is essential in any weight-loss program. Exercising also helps the body produce more endorphins, which can improve your mental outlook. If weight loss is a goal, eat less of the sweet foods (such as bananas and dates) and more of the cleansing foods (such as apples and carrots). Choose lower-starch vegetables to avoid loading your body with carbohydrates. In addition, any fats you eat should be in raw form. A study at Tufts Medical School found that overweight people were deficient in endogenous lipase, a fat-digesting enzyme, so fat was being stored in the body rather than being broken down. Cooking and refining destroys the lipase in foods (for example, lipase is present in nuts, but not in oils made from nuts). In raw foods, however, the lipase is intact and helps with the metabolism of fats, even high-fat foods such as avocados or sprouted nuts and seeds. Foods that aid weight loss are those with concentrated nutrients, enzymes, and cleansing ability. These concentrated foods include berries, Why Go Raw) 13 citrus fruits, leafy green vegetables, melon, pineapple, unpasteurized sauer- kraut, sea vegetables, and tomatoes. Using more warming, spicy condi- ments such as cayenne, cinnamon, garlic, and ginger will improve circulation and help the body metabolize fats. Room-temperature water with some fresh lemon juice squeezed into it is naturally diuretic, and the slightly sour taste will improve liver function and thus aid in fat metabolism as well. Raw celery is also helpful in any weight-loss program because it improves thyroid function, which can energize a sluggish metabolism. If you experience food cravings between meals, try drinking a green juice or chewing on wheatgrass: either of these will have a stabilizing, alka- linizing effect. Taking a few deep, slow breaths may also help. Most crav- ings will pass within a few minutes. A craving for sweets may be an indication that the body needs more protein, so you might consider incor- porating more protein sources into your diet (spirulina is especially helpful; see page 94). A craving for salty foods may indicate that you need more minerals, which you can get by including mineral-rich sea vegetables like kelp, dulse, or hiziki in your diet. You may find it helpful to keep a food journal that records what you eat and drink for a week to gain insight into what your diet really looks like. If you do eat something that's not part of your plan, rather than feel- ing guilty about it, observe and write about the emotional factors that were driving you. Were you tired, bored, or anxious? How did you feel after eating it? Choosing to lose weight can be an opportunity to pay more attention to yourself and bring better health to all aspects of your person. Clean out the basement, garage, and cupboards: getting rid of unnecessary stuff aids the process of letting go. Set goals for yourself and use the raw foods diet as an opportunity to live a healthier lifestyle that can add years, beauty, and joy to your life. Gaining Weight Some people who begin a totally raw diet become thin enough to concern their families and friends. Although this may happen initially, you should then gain back some weight over the course of a few months. Try drinking a smoothie or two between meals, and incorporate foods that encourage weight gain such as avocados, bananas, dried fruits, pumpkin seeds, sun- flower seeds, and nut butters into the smoothies. Eventually, your weight should find its balance."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"II RaWsome! ACHIEVING TRUE HEALTH In the typical Western lifestyle, we get in the way of our own health by con- gesting our cells and ourselves with processed and hard-to-digest food. Live food infuses one's being with fresh, vibrant energy, helping us feel invigor- ated and revitalizing our capability to resist disease. When we become ill, we must first recognize our illness as a sign that the body is trying to heal itself. Disease is the body's method of cleansing, repairing, and restoring itself. Most often, disease results from the buildup of imbalance or daily \"wrongs\" against nature. When enough wrongs have occurred, disease manifests itself. And although it may appear to strike suddenly, it is important to remember that disease—or the conditions that allow it to take hold in the body—is, rather, an indicator of long-standing or chronic imbalance. Causes of imbalance are many, including depletion of vital energy (as from lack of sleep), exposure to toxic substances (like air pollution), and physiological irritation (such as stress). But perhaps the most widespread and damaging cause of imbalance is our diet. \"We dig our graves with our forks,\" says our friend and raw chef Juliano. We eat food that is hard to digest, full of synthetic additives, infused with traces of herbicides or pesti- cides, allergenic, and nutritionally deficient, and so overprocessed that it sends our systems into wild spirals of hyperactivity. Simply using remedies to treat the symptoms of disease does nothing to eradicate it. True \"medicine\" removes the cause of the disease. Rather than inventing new drugs, building more hospitals, training more caregivers, and selling more pharmaceutical products, we should focus on building health in our bodies. Good health is not simply freedom from disease but is also phys- ical, mental, and emotional vitality. All four of these facets of good health are supported and strengthened by the raw foods diet. When the initial derox reaction (see below) has run its course, you will find that you begin to feel revitalized, invigorated, and fully awake. The raw foods diet cleanses and fortifies the organs, strengthens the immune system, supports emotional stability and mental alertness, and energizes the body. Maintaining your health, physical and mental energy, and positive outlook has never been easier. And to imagine we can do all this just with food! The Detox Reaction When you begin a raw foods diet, you may experience a detoxification reaction. This reaction is itself an indicator of the health-endowing powers Why Go RavU> 15 of raw foods. You'll see for yourself that accumulated toxins in your body are eliminated and physiological imbalances are corrected. You might look worse before you look better; you might feel worse before you feel better. Sometimes we must first get sick in order to get well. The detox reaction usually kicks in a few months into the raw diet. For me, the reaction began when I was three months into my new lifestyle. Signs of detox can include fatigue, coated tongue, cold or flulike symptoms, mus- cle soreness, phlegm, low libido, sore throat, headache, bad breath, body odor, cough, sinus congestion, depression, nausea, darkened urine, sweat- ing, fever, skin breakouts, stomachache, diarrhea, and irritability. Rest and sleep facilitate the detox process. Mild exercise such as walking or low- impact aerobics is also helpful, but you should avoid anything strenuous. Drink plenty of water. Focus on supporting the channels of elimination (see below). Spend time in fresh air and sunshine when possible. Soaking in hot mineral springs, going to a sauna, or practicing dry-brush skin massage can assist in the cleansing process. Enemas and colonics can help toxins leave the body through the bowels rather than the skin. When you embrace a lighter diet, old, repressed emotions (perhaps buried with mounds of cheesecake) can rise to the surface. Cry. Journal. Scream. Pound on pillows. Take a warm bath. Assist the cleansing process rather than suppressing it. Get your \"ya-yas\" out! This can also be a good time to get some housecleaning and uncluttering done. Let go of \"stuck ener- gy\" in your physical environment to create more peace in your inner realm. Research Studies To date, science has not shown much interest in the benefits of raw foods. Studies are expensive in general and, with no corporate sponsor seeking evi- The Channels of Elimination The body has many methods of letting go of what is no longer needed and what needs to be cleansed.

A few small studies on raw foods have been done, how- ever, with a range of test subjects, and the results have all been positive, as detailed below. (More studies have been conducted on enzymes. For further information on enzyme research, check out works such as Enzymes: The Fountain of Life by D.A. Lopez, R.M. Williams, and K. Miehlke; Enzyme and Enzyme Therapy by Anthony J. Cichoke; and Enzyme Nutrition: The Food Enzyme Concept by Edward Howell.) Pottenger Beginning in 1932, physician Francis M. Pottenger of Monrovia, California, conducted a study that lasted over a decade and included over 900 cats. Two groups of cats were fed identical diets of meat, milk, and vegetables, but the food for one group was cooked and the food for the other group was given raw. The cars of the raw food group had good health, as did their offspring. The cats of the cooked food group, however, all had health breakdowns including hair loss, brittle bones, heartburn, arthritis, pyor- rhea, underactive thyroid, liver disorders (cirrhosis, atrophy, and other problems), brain thickening, oozing mucous membranes, skin lesions, aller- gies, respiratory infections, intestinal parasites, vision problems, and spinal cord degeneration. The females of the group fed cooked food were aggressive and irritable, while the males were docile and showed little interest in the females. This group of cats did not survive beyond the third generation. Among the first generation, the miscarriage rate was about 25 percent, and among the sec- ond generation it was about 70 percent. By the third generation, the cats were sterile and many had congenital deformities. Kittens in the cooked food group weighed an average of 19 grams less than kittens whose moth- ers ate raw foods. McCarrison In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Robert McCarrison, a British officer sta- tioned in India, performed a study with white rats. One thousand rats were fed a partially raw diet consisting of cabbage, carrots, sprouts, bread, milk, and meat. Another 2,000 rats were fed a diet of canned food, boiled veg- etables, and milk. The rats of the first group thrived. The rats of the second group began to develop ailments such as tuberculosis, ulcers, hair loss, den- tal decay, skin diseases, tonsillitis, and arthritis. Why Go Raw) 17 Ling and Colleagues A study published in 1992 in the Journal of Nutrition detailed the work of researchers at the University of Kuopio in Finland who studied the effects of a raw, vegan diet on fecal activity. Eighteen participants were divided randomly into a test group and a control group. The test group ate a raw, vegan diet for one month and a conventional diet for a second month, while the control group ate a conventional diet for both months. The researchers measured levels of fecal enzymes and the toxins phenol and p- cresol in the participants' blood serum. The test group showed declines in the measured substances while on the raw, vegan diet, but then their fecal enzyme levels returned to normal with- in two weeks of resuming the conventional diet, and their phenol and p- cresol concentrations returned to normal within one month. The control group, on the conventional diet throughout, exhibited no changes in these levels. These results suggest that following a raw, vegan diet causes a decrease in bacterial enzymes and certain toxins that have been shown to contribute to colon cancer risk. Kaartinen and Colleagues Another study at the University of Kuopio, published in 2000 in the Scan- dinavian Journal of Rheutnatology, detailed the work of researchers who investigated the effects of nutrition on thirty-three female patients (average age fifty-one) suffering from fibromyalgia. For three months, eighteen of the women ate a completely raw diet and the rest ate a vegan diet. At the end of the study, the adherents to the raw foods diet reported less pain, bet- ter sleep, and less morning stiffness, whereas the patients on the vegan diet complained of more pain. Donaldson and Colleagues A study published in 2001 in Nutrition and Food Science presented the results of a survey of followers of a mostly raw, all-vegetarian diet. Self- reported, seven-day dietary records of 141 participants were collected and analyzed for nutrient intake, and the participants also reported on changes in their health and quality of life after adopting the diet. Improvements in health and quality of life were significant: on a scale of 1-100, the group's average rating for general health rose from 61 to 90; for vitality, from 49 to 78; and for mental health, from 71 to 87."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"i;: RauJsome! FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS For people contemplating a raw foods diet, whether as a possible lifestyle change or when faced with someone who has already made the change, sev- eral questions are inevitable. Those questions are addressed here. The answers will, I hope, satisfy your concerns and offer enough information that you can provide an intelligent, heartfelt answer to the curious and the skeptical. Be glad when people ask questions! They give you an opportuni- ty to convey your enthusiasm and spread the word of raw health. Where Do You Get Protein? We've been trained to recognize meats, eggs, and dairy products as good sources of protein. However, protein can also be found in many plant- source foods—and some of these foods contain more protein than any food of animal origin. Proteins are made of amino acids, and twenty-two amino acids are known to be necessary for our physiological health. Eight of these amino acids are termed \"essential,\" because they cannot be produced in the human body and must instead be consumed through the diet. Protein is necessary for tissue growth and repair as well as the formation of blood cells, antibodies, enzymes, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Protein provides the body with energy and plays a role in the body's balancing of water and electrolytes. While it is imperative to have protein in the diet, it is also important not to overdo it. Excess protein can overload the lymphatic system's ability to cleanse itself. A diet that is excessively rich in protein can contribute to heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, gout, kidney, osteoporosis, and liver and prostate disorders. Studies at the Max Planck Institute for National Research have found that too much protein in the diet—even if only a small excess—can decrease the body's ability to transport oxygen, and lack of oxygen is thought to be a contributing factor in the development of cancer. The amino acids in protein start becoming destroyed at 118°F and are almost completely destroyed by 160°F. In terms of food, this means that cooking causes food proteins to coagulate and become denatured, making them less digestible and more likely to produce inflammation. In fact, cook- ing food to a temperature just under 200°F causes leukocytosis, a condition wherein leukocytes (white blood cells that attack foreign substances) are called in to help with digestion. After the consumption of a meal including cooked protein, white blood cell levels increase by as much as 600 percent. This immune system response indicates that the body, in striving to main- Why Go Raw) tain homeostasis, is recognizing components of cooked food as invaders that must be neutralized. Because cooked proteins are at least partially denatured, food that is cooked provides the body with much less protein than the same food in its raw state. As cooked food is predominant in our culture, protein-intake rec- ommendations (currently hovering around 70 grams a day) tend to be based on cooked rather than raw food. But researchers at the Max Planck Institute have found that when protein is consumed in its raw state, a per- son needs only half as much as when protein is consumed after being cooked. In other words, instead of eating 70 grams of cooked protein a day, you can eat 35 grams of raw protein and still meet your nutritional needs. Proteins that contain all eight essential amino acids are called complete proteins. These are found in foods including: • Alfalfa leaf • Mung beans • Buckwheat • Nuts (all except hazelnuts/filberts • Clover blossoms • Pumpkin seeds • Fruits (most of them) • Quinoa • Garbanzo beans • Sesame seeds • Leafy green vegetables • Soy foods Lentils • Sunflower greens • Millet Other good protein sources include: • Apricots • Carrots • Avocados • Cauliflower Bananas • Cherries • Beans • Coconut • Berries • Corn Blue-green algae • Cucumbers • Broccoli • Dates • Brussels sprouts • Durians • Cabbages • Eggplant"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"20 Raw some! • Grapes • Spirulina • Hemp seeds • Sprouts (includin • Melons grains) • Okra • String beans • Oranges • Summer squash • Papayas • Sun-cured olives • Parsley • Sweet potatoes • Peaches • Tomatoes • Pears • Turnip greens » Peas • Watercress • Peppers • Zucchini g sprouted Generally speaking, vegetables have a higher percentage of protein per caloric content than nuts, and nuts have a higher percentage of protein per caloric content than fruits, but there are exceptions to these generalizations, of course. Aren't Raw Foods Hard to Digest? Many people are plagued with digestive complaints and have had trouble in the past eating raw foods. Some have been told they lack digestive abili- ty and must eat only cooked foods. Au contraire! Enzymes are what you need to heal digestion problems, and you're certainly not going to find them in cooked food. Raw foods work as intestinal brooms, and eating them causes a cleans- ing reaction; although this may cause gas and/or intestinal discomfort in some people, it is usually only a short-term initial problem. If you find that certain raw foods are difficult to digest, avoid them at first, but don't hesi- tate to try them in small amounts later, after you've been raw for a couple of months. As your digestion becomes stronger from the intake of enzymes, your food repertoire can increase. If you have poor digestion or are very ill, help your digestive system by breaking down your food as much as possible before it reaches your stom- ach. Chew well. Juice or puree vegetables to make soups. Soak dried fruits, and puree them if needed. Make fruit smoothies. Sprout your grains and Why Go Raw? 21 Here are a few examples of the amount of protein in foods according to their total caloric content: Almonds Broccoli Buckwheat Cabbage Honeydew melon Kale 12 percent 45 percent 15 percent 22 percent 16 percent 45 percent Pumpkin Spinach Walnuts Watercress Zucchini 15 percent 49 percent 13 percent 84 percent 28 percent nuts. Read the section on food combining. You can also season your food with any of the many herbs and spices that facilitate digestion, including: • Anise • Basil • Cardamom • Cinnamon • Cumin • Fennel • Ginger • Rosemary • Spearmint • Thyme • Turmeric Won't You Be Hungry? Many people think that a raw foods diet will leave them feeling constantly hungry. Perhaps that's because they equate it with eating only small amounts of raw fruits and vegetables in their plainest form. In truth, as you'll learn through the following chapter, a raw diet is far from the classic stereotype of \"rabbit food.\" It offers a tremendous variety of ingredients, flavors, and preparation methods. Because raw foods are packed with nutrients and fiber, they are satisfying to both the palate and the stomach. They fill you up without giving you that heavy, oily, lethargic, \"stuffed\" feeling that comes from eating an excess of cooked fats and carbohydrates. And generally speaking, you can eat as much raw food as you like without worrying about weight gain. In fact, as you'll find out, the raw foods diet actually supports the maintenance of your optimal body weight. Won't You Be Cold in Winter? For many years, I resisted the raw foods path in the belief that eating raw food would cause a \"cold, damp spleen\" (as it's described in Oriental med-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"22 Raw some! icine) and make me unable to tolerate the cold Colorado winters. Practi- tioners of Oriental medicine cook almost all of their food in the belief that cooking predigests it, and because of the fear of food-borne parasites. Cooking food to make it more digestible sounds good in theory, but we might want to recognize that cooked food has not brought ultimate health to those who eat it. Now that I eat raw, I am amazed that it took me so long to overcome this prejudice. Coldness and dampness in the spleen are usu- ally associated with impaired digestion—but I (like most raw foodists I know) am happy to say that, over time, the raw foods diet has made my digestive system work better than ever before. People who do not practice Oriental medicine may nevertheless steer away from raw foods in the winter simply because it feels much nicer to have a hot bowl of soup warming up their insides. It's true that newcomers to a raw foods diet may feel cold more easily; one reason for this is that raw foods are less dense in calories, and calories produce heat as food is metab- olized by the body. After some time, however, eating raw foods will cause your arteries and other blood vessels to become less congested, circulation will improve, and you will feel more comfortable in either cold or warm weather. Rather than eating warm foods when the weather is cold, eat warming foods. \"Warm\" foods are heated and, as we've learned, have therefore lost some of their nutrients. \"Warming\" foods are those raw foods that offer concentrated nourishment, improve circulation and thereby increase body warmth, and otherwise help you tolerate the cold. Try filling your diet with warming, concentrated, dark orange vegeta- bles such as pumpkins, sweet potatoes, winter squash, and carrots. Eat more warming roots such as burdock, onions, rutabagas, and turnips, and warming greens such as arugula, mustard greens, and watercress. Consum- ing more nuts, nut butters, and dried fruit will help you develop better resistance to the cold. Getting adequate fats by consuming olive oil, avoca- dos, durians, nuts, and seeds helps treat the dryness of skin and scalp that is so prevalent when heat is used in homes during the winter. Use more of the warming culinary herbs to spice up your food and improve circulation. Good choices include: • Black sesame seeds  • Cinnamon • Cardamom  • Curry (a combination of • Cayenne   several warming spices) • Garlic   • Jalapeno • Ginger   • Pepper, black or white • Horseradish If you don't want to eat cold food, you can warm your raw meals up to 114°F without destroying any of the enzymes. You can also leave food out at room temperature, serve it on pre warmed plates, or place it in a glass jar with a secure lid and submerge the jar in some hot water to warm it up. Many raw foodists living in cold climates drink hot herbal teas in cold weather—just heat the water without boiling it. People may ask, \"Aren't you cold eating only raw food in the winter?\" When they do, ask them right back, \"Aren't you hot eating cooked food in the summer?\" How Do I Get Started? Many people think that being raw will be difficult. It's not. It really does save time, money, and your health, and it's so very worth it. As it can be a shock to the body to stop eating familiar fare abruptly, a gradual transition works best for some people. Begin by including a raw dish with each meal. Then, make one meal each day completely raw. Start having raw dishes for main entrees and relegate cooked foods to side dish- es. Gradually increase the amount of raw food and decrease the amount of cooked food in your diet. Eliminate first those heavier, unhealthful foods you know you shouldn't be eating. Have baked or steamed rather than fried foods. Let go of prepackaged, instant, frozen, and other ready-to-eat, refined foods. Replace dairy, eggs, and meat with avocados, nuts, and seeds. Eventually, remove all the cooked, canned, and sugar- and flour-rich foods from your cupboards. Shop at natural foods stores or markets that sell organic produce, and avoid regular grocery stores. As much as possible, eat foods that are in season (see \"Eating Seasonally\" on page 136). Some people take as long as a year to become totally raw. The hardest withdrawal period is at about two months. Salt cravings may indicate a need for more minerals: instead of potato chips, eat seaweeds. If you have cravings for sweet foods, eat celery to diminish them. If you strongly crave fats, eat avocados and nuts, and balance them with lots of greens, celery, and cucumbers. The one food you think you just can't give up—whether potato chips, coffee, chocolate, or any other—is very likely your greatest"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2! Rautsome! health impediment. To discourage cravings, drink green drinks, which are alkalinizing and calming to the emotions (where many cravings originate). For motivation, take a \"before\" photo of yourself, and then take anoth- er photo after six months of being raw. Start a journal and write about your health history, keeping track of how your health improves or worsens (see The Detox Reaction on page 14) as you go raw. Make a list of five foods you would be better off without. Write down five limiting beliefs and replace them with affirmations: for example, \"1 am fat\" can be replaced with \"Every day, I am making healthier choices.\" If you slip off the raw path, learn from the experience. Rather than feel- ing guilty, observe how you feel and get back on track as soon as possible. For best results, stick with the program and don't deviate. It can be so helpful to have a raw buddy to share this process with you. Make a delicious raw meal for your friends; lend them books on the sub- ject; and plan raw politicks or raw theme dinners (Mexican, Indian, and the like; see \"Theme Dinners\" on page 258). To find other raw-interested folks in your area, offer to teach a class, or put up a sign in the local health foods store to connect with others for discussion, support, or meal sharing. It may take up to three or four months on a raw foods diet before you are able to judge how it is working for you. Do your best to be at least 80 percent raw—and for ultimate health and healing, do it 100 percent! f m he foods that you eat maintain the health of your body, not only nutri- • tionally but also therapeutically. Foods themselves do not technically —1— heal the body, as only the body can heal itself. Eating the right foods, however, can help provide the right conditions for the body to heal itself. In this light, food can be seen as medicine. So in the case of illness or imbal- ance, instead of turning to pharmaceuticals, why not first try amending your diet? This chapter will help you understand the nutritional and heal- ing properties of the fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and other foods that are commonly available to the Western consumer. FRUITS AND VEGETABLES Fruits and vegetables will form the vast majority of your raw foods diet. As much as possible, eat produce that is organic. Because no chemical pes- ticides or herbicides are used in its agriculture, organic produce supports not only your own health but also that of the soil and the planet. Although organic produce is still difficult to find in many areas, and tends to be more expensive than other produce, buying organic foods whenev- er you can puts pressure on the economic system to produce more of it. In effect, you'll be voting with your dollars for the continued development of organic agriculture.

The old expression \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\" has it right: apples are a superb, overall tonic for the body and especially for yin (see \"Yin, Yang, and Chi\" on page 27). This fruit has antibacterial, anti- inflammatory, antiviral, astringent, diuretic, tonic, and some estrogenic activity. Apples stabilize blood sugar levels, which is helpful in both hypo- glycemia and diabetes. They promote good digestion, prevent intestinal fermentation, and reduce colon inflammation, thereby improving both RaW Foods Encyclopedia 27 diarrhea and constipation. They are of benefit in cases of arthritis pain, edema, gout, morning sickness, asthma, catarrh, hardening of the arteries, skin diseases, liver and gallbladder sluggishness, and rheumatism. Eating apples stimulates saliva flow, cleans the teeth, and stimulates gum tissue. It helps lubricate the lungs and cleanse the lymphatic system. Apples can also aid in weight loss, neutralize the effects of smoking, curb cravings for alco- hol, and remove radiation from the body. Apples taste best when they are in season and firm to the touch, as those yielding to the pressure of a fingertip will be mealy. Store them at 35°F. Apples can be enjoyed in pies, tarts, sauces, cakes, and salads, juiced alone or with other fruits or vegetables, or dried—but for maximum health benefits, eat them in their fresh, raw state! They are best eaten unpeeled, because their pectin is concentrated near the skin, and the peel also contains other dietary fiber. If you can't find organic apples, however, you should peel your apples before eating them, because commercial apples are often coated with wax and have pesticide residues on the skin. Yin, Yanq, and Chi According to ancient Asian philosophy, yin and yang are the vital polarities that permeate the universe from the tiniest mote to the grandest star system. They are not warring opposites but different sides of a continuum, merging into one another. Neither can exist without the other, and the balance of the two affects the life force of every object and organism, including the human body. In traditional Oriental medicine, ailments are often described in terms of a yin-yang imbalance. Yin embodies coldness and dampness, whereas yang embodies heat and dryness. A yang deficiency, for example, could result in a damp, cold condition such as lower back pain, lethargy, or edema. A yin defi- ciency, on the other hand, could result in a dry, warm condition such as insom- nia, nervous exhaustion, or dizziness. Treatment is therefore focused on restoring yin-yang balance to the affected system or organ, and the root of that treatment is often the diet. Chi (also spelled Qi) means life force or vital energy. It is a colorless, taste- less, odorless, formless substance that exists in the universe. We extract chi from food, which combines with the chi from the air we breathe, which con- tributes to health and vitality."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"28 RaWsomel Apricot (Prunus dwiewda/)— Rosaceae (Rose) Family Apricots are sweet and sour, and neutral in energy. Apricots are rich in beta- carotene, vitamin C, copper, iron, magnesium, potassium, silicon, and cobalt. They are a natural laxative because of their high fiber and pectin content. They also contain a trace amount of lycopene, which is being researched as a cancer preventative. Apricots are alkaline, nutritive, and antioxidant. They are an excellent fruit for midsummer, as they moisten the lungs and provide the body with yin fluids. They have been used to treat acne, anemia, asthma, bronchitis, catarrh, constipation, hypertension, toxemia, and tuberculosis. Apricot pulp can be used as a facial to soften the skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Apricots are most delicious when orange in color, without any green; otherwise, they are immature and will be sour. Enjoy them fresh as a snack or added to smoothies and fruit juices. Dried apricots can be soaked overnight and enjoyed in the morning as a breakfast of \"stewed\" fruit. Note: Excess ingestion of apricots may cause diarrhea; therefore, dur­ ing pregnancy, they should be eaten only in moderation. Also, most com­ mercially dried apricots are treated with sulfur dioxide, a preservative that can cause allergic reactions in some people and should be avoided by all (see the Resources section for suppliers of untreated dried fruit). Arugula (Eruca ves/cđWđ )-Brassicaceae (Mustard) Family Arugula, also known as rocket, roquette, Italian cress, and roka, is pungent and highly alkaline, with a warm energy. Arugula contains beta-carotene, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and sulfur. It also contains dithiolthiones (antiox­ idant and anticancer compounds) and is recommended as an anticancer food by the American Cancer Society. Arugula stimulates the liver and lungs and exhibits antibiotic and antiviral properties. Eat arugula's young, green leaves, as the older leaves tend to be bitter and intensely flavored. Because of its strong flavor, arugula is best when mixed in a salad with other greens. Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis)- Eiliaceae (Lily) Family Asparagus is alkaline, slightly warm, bitter, and pungent. Fresh, young asparagus shoots are rich in beta-carotene, vitamins B, C, and E, iodine, potassium, and zinc. They also contain the alkaloid asparagine, which is an effective diuretic and helps dissolve uric and oxalic acids as well, making Rart Foods Encyclopedia 29 asparagus a useful adjunct in the treatment of arthritis (the buildup of these acids contributes to arthritic symptoms). Asparagus cools fever, increases production of mother's milk, boosts vitality, inhibits tumor growth, reduces the size and occurrence of kidney stones, and clears dark circles from under the eyes. Asparagus has long been used as an aphrodisiac, perhaps in part because of its phallic shape, but also because it increases circulatory activity in the genito-urinary system. So if you're wondering what to serve that special someone . . . Look for bright, green asparagus spears with compact tops. Flat or thick stalks are likely to be woody and stringy. Asparagus is best eaten in spring, its natural ripening time. It is delightful added raw to salads, pureed in soups, or mixed with other vegetables. Avocado (Persea americana, P. gratissima)— Lauraceae (Laurel) Family Avocado is sweet and is considered to have a cooling energy. Avocados are rich in vitamin E, B-complex vitamins, beta-carotene, potassium (two to three times that of bananas), fluorine, copper, and lecithin. A single avoca­ do has about 300 calories, in part because it is about 20 percent monoun- saturated fat. This is the type of fat that helps maintain levels of good cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL) in the body. People who have difficulty digesting fats will usually find avocado easy to assimilate. Avocado nourishes the blood, lubricates the lungs and large intestines, balances liver function, and, in cases of cystitis, soothes the bladder. A tra­ ditional remedy for erectile dysfunction, constipation, nervousness, and insomnia, it is also recommended for convalescence, ulcers, and colitis. Mashed avocado applied to the face or scalp is nourishing and condition­ ing, and is especially beneficial for dry skin and hair. Look for avocado fruits that yield slightly when pressed. If an avocado is very firm and not yet ripe, you can place it in a paper bag in a warm loca­ tion to speed the ripening process. Once ripe, avocados should be refriger­ ated to keep them from becoming rancid (avoid rancid or overripe fruits). Avocado is excellent as a garnish, in fruit or vegetable salad, as a sandwich filler, and, of course, in guacamole. Many suprising uses for avocado will be found in the Raw Recipes chapter. Banana (Musa acuminata, M. sapientum )—Muscaeae (Banana) Family Bananas are considered cold and have a tendency to move energy inward in the body. They are sweet, being rich in carbohydrates (mostly the sugars"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"30 Raw some! glucose and fructose), as well as in folic acid, vitamins B f , and C, potassium, and pectin. They also contain an enzyme that aids in the production of sex hormones. As bananas are high in calories but low in fat, they are an excel- lent food for pregnant mothers, babies, and children. Bananas provide long-term energy and improve stamina. They moisten the yin fluids of the body, including the lungs and large intestines, and have some antiseptic activity. They support the friendly intestinal flora (helpful bacteria within our bowels) and stimulate the proliferation of cells that provide a protective coating between the stomach and harsh digestive acids. Bananas also stimulate the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that can improve sleep and elevate mood. Bananas have been used to treat alcoholism, arteriosclerosis, celiac dis- ease, colitis, constipation, depression, diarrhea, dyspepsia, exhaustion, hemorrhoids, hypertension, weak muscles, and ulcers. They have also been used to help treat insulin shock in diabetics. Ripe bananas are very easy to digest—even easier when mashed—and are recommended for those suffer- ing from weak digestion, vomiting, or emaciation. Bananas are ripe when they are solid yellow without any green, and are overripe once they develop large brown spots. Unripe bananas contain enzyme inhibitors and are therefore constipating and difficult to digest, whereas ripe bananas do not have the inhibitors and are considered laxa- tive. Avoid commercial bananas, which are picked unripe and then treated with ethylene gas to hasten ripening during shipment; instead, purchase organic bananas and place them in a paper bag to encourage natural ripen- ing. To preserve bananas at the peak of ripeness, store them in the refriger- ator, which will turn the skin brown but not adversely affect the flavor, or keep them in a dark, plastic bag sealed with a twist tie. Use bananas in puddings, pies, fruit salads, and smoothies. Bananas blended with water make nourishing banana milk. Snack on them fresh, or try a sandwich of banana and raw almond butter. Freeze peeled bananas and run them through a juicer to make dairy-free \"ice cream.\" Dried banana chips make a tasty, sweet treat. Note: People who are exceedingly cold, frail, or lethargic should only con- sume bananas in moderation, as eating them may exacerbate those conditions. Beet (Beta vulgaris)— Chenopodiaceae (Goosefoot) Family Beets are sweet. They abound with nutrients including beta-carotene, B- complex vitamins, vitamin C, iron, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and RaW Foods Encyclopedia :;i manganese. Betaine, the red pigment that gives beets their color, helps increase oxygen intake. Being round roots, beets are considered to have a downward energy, affecting the lower organs and especially benefiting the colon, kidneys, bladder, spleen, and liver. Said to be both blood cleansing and blood building, beets help build red corpuscles and have long been used therapeutically to treat anemia. They have also been used to treat constipation, infectious hepatitis, irregular menses, acne, lumbago, and low blood sugar. Try beets grated raw into a salad. They are also lovely when seasoned with a bit of honey and lemon. Other seasonings that bring out the best in beets include dill, basil, parsley, and tarragon. Carrot-beet juice is a bona fide energizing elixir. The root is not the only edible part of the beet plant: beet greens are delicious when finely chopped and added to salads. Note: Beet greens are even richer in iron than spinach is, but they do contain high levels of oxalic acid, which makes them suitable for occasion- al use only. Also, be aware that eating lots of beets may add a red color to your urine or stools, and remember that you have been eating beets before you rush off to the emergency ward! Bell Pepper (Capsicum annum)— Solanaceae (Nightshade) Family Bell peppers are sweet, pungent, alkaline, and warm. Rich in beta- carotene, vitamin C, silicon, and bioflavonoids, they contain some vita- min B 6 , E, and folic acid as well. Peppers also contain lycopene, a carotenoid believed to help reduce the risk of prostate, cervical, bladder, and pancreatic cancers. Bell peppers have antioxidant and circulatory-stimulant properties, and are considered useful in warding off angina, atherosclerosis, cataracts, con- stipation, colds, high blood pressure, macular degeneration, obesity, and respiratory ailments (asthma, bronchitis, catarrh, sinus congestion). Their high silicon content makes them an excellent \"beauty food\" for skin, hair, teeth, and nails. Look for firm, unwrinkled, brightly colored peppers that are heavy for their size. Red bell peppers are more ripe, sweet, and nutritious than green ones. The refinement of their shape does not matter, as being crooked will not adversely affect their quality or taste. Store peppers in a cool place. Flat them stuffed, as a garnish, or in salads, sauces, crudites, and soups. Note: People who suffer from arthritis may benefit from avoiding pep- pers and other members of the nightshade family (eggplant, potatoes, and"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"32 RaWsome! tomatoes), as these foods contain solanine, an alkaloid that can inhibit cal- cium absorption if overconsumed. Blackberry (Rubus species )-Rosaceae (Rose) Family Blackberries are sweet, sour, and cooling. They contain vitamin C, niacin, pectin, sugars, anthocyanins, and flavonoids (especially kaempferol and quercitin). Blackberries have alterative, astringent, blood-tonic, diuretic, hemosta- tic, nutritive, refrigerant, uterine-tonic, and y/>;-tonic properties. They have been used in the treatment of anemia, cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, fever, hemorrhoids, and infertility. They help dispel heat, reduce inflammation, cool fever, and dry excess dampness in the body. Blackberries are a tasty treat all by themselves. Of course, they also can be enjoyed in raw pies, tarts, jams, and soups, and can even be used as food coloring. Blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus, V. corymbosum, V. ashei, V. angustifolium)— Ericaceae (Heath) Family Blueberries are sour, astringent, and moist, with a cold energy. They contain beta-carotene, vitamin C, iron, and potassium, and are rich in silicon, which is believed to help regenerate the pancreas. They also contain pectin, which binds with cholesterol, lowering its levels and helping prevent the buildup of plaque in the blood. It is believed that anthocyanadin, a flavonoid and antioxidant found in blueberries, makes the walls of blood vessels stronger by interacting with their collagen, helping deter capillary fragility and the development of varicose veins. Myrtillin, another com- pound in blueberries, lowers blood sugar levels, and for that reason this fruit is considered beneficial in preventing and treating diabetes. Blueberries are considered alterative, anti-emetic, antifungal, anti- inflammatory, antioxidant, antiseptic, antiviral, astringent, and diuretic. A yin tonic, they cool and cleanse the kidneys and liver. A urinary antiseptic, they help prevent bacteria from adhering to the bladder wall and are used to prevent and treat urinary tract infections. These berries have long been used in treatments for anemia, arthritis, dry skin, dysentery, E. coli infec- tion, hemorrhoids, dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps), fevers, gout, intes- tinal flu, joint inflammation, mouth sores, obesity, ulcers, and worms. They reduce platelet aggregation, thereby helping to prevent clumps or clots from RaW Foods Encyclopedia 33 forming in the blood. Large amounts of blueberries are laxative, though small amounts can be used to treat diarrhea. Because blueberries improve circulation to the brain and extremities, and particularly increase circulation to the eyes, they are recommended against a wide range of eye diseases and have been used in treatments for eye weakness, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degener- ation, myopia, and night blindness. They are especially helpful for people whose work can lead to strained eyesight, such as computer workers, driv- ers, pilots, and air traffic controllers. Look for firm, plump, organic blueberries. They are wonderful eaten plain or added to pies, tarts, jams, cobblers, muffins, breads, ice creams, and yogurt. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea italica)— Brassicaceae (Mustard) Family Broccoli is pungent and slightly bitter, and is considered cooling. It is rich in fiber, beta-carotene, vitamins B2, C, and K, pantothenic and folic acid, boron, calcium, chromium, iron, potassium, selenium, and sulfur. It con- tains many antioxidants including dithiolthiones, quercitin, lutein, zeaxan- thin, and glutathione, as well as monoterpene carotenoids that have antioxidant properties and protect against breast, cervical, colon, esophageal, lung, and stomach cancers. Broccoli also contains indoles and sulforaphanes, which are believed to activate enzymes that, in turn, deacti- vate estrogens that can contribute to tumor growth. Broccoli has immune-stimulating, antiviral, diuretic, and anti-ulcer activity. It aids in the digestion of fats, moves blockage and stuck energy from the liver, and helps regulate insulin and blood sugar levels. Broccoli also helps prevent constipation, high blood pressure, nearsightedness, neu- ritis, obesity, and toxemia. This vegetable is most nutritious when consumed raw, because cooking destroys many of its valuable anticancer compounds. Look for dark-col- ored broccoli featuring compact clusters of buds. Use it in salads and soups, or as a erudite for dips. Broccoli sprouts (an excellent anticancer food and a rich source of calcium and folic acid) are also delicious. Note: As eating raw broccoli can inhibit iodine absorption, people with low thyroid function should ensure adequate iodine intake. Brussels Sprout (Brassica oleracea gemmifera)— Brassicaceae (Mustard) Family Brussels sprouts are pungent, sweet, slightly bitter, and warming. These"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"RaWsome! Cabbage is sweet and pungent in flavor, neutral to warming in energy, and alkaline. It is a good source of fiber, protein, histamine, beta-carotene, folic acid, vitamins Bj, B 6 , C, K, and U, bioflavonoids, calcium, fluorine, iodine, iron, potassium, and sulfur. Cabbage also contains indoles, which help pre- vent breast cancer by inhibiting estrogens from stimulating tumor growth; monoterpenes, which are antioxidants that give protection against heart disease and cancer; and various other compounds shown to have anticancer properties. This vegetable has alterative, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and diuret- ic properties. Esteemed as a circulatory stimulant, vermifuge, and muscle builder, it also strengthens the eyes, gums, teeth, bones, hair, liver, and nails. Cabbage is believed to lower the risk of heart disease, strokes, cataracts, and cancer of the colon, esophagus, lungs, skin, and stomach. It has been used to treat a wide range of conditions: asthma, high cholesterol, colds, colic, constipation, cough, depression, diabetes, eye infections, fibrocystic breast disease, gout, headaches, hearing loss, insomnia, irritability, kidney and bladder disorders, lumbago, lung congestion, radiation exposure, skin ailments, tuberculosis, ulcers, and yeast infections. RaW Foods Encyclopedia 35 vegetables are alkalinizing and antioxidant, and their high sulfur content makes them warming. They are a good source of beta-carotene, vitamins B 6 and C, folic acid, flavonoids, calcium, iron, and phosphorus. Brussels sprouts contain indoles, which are believed to prevent breast cancer by blocking the activity of estrogens that contribute to tumor growth, and sulforaphanes, which block carcinogens from damaging healthy cells. Brussels sprouts are also considered a preventative to colon cancer, and their high fiber content promotes bowel health. They stimulate the liver and have an affinity for the pancreas. They have been used to remedy acidosis, arteriosclerosis, catarrh, constipation, bleeding gums, and high cholesterol. Select firm, compact, bright green Brussels sprouts. Puffy sprouts tend to taste bland, and smaller ones (less than lV 2 inches in diameter) tend to taste better. Their flavor improves after they have been through a frost, so they are most popular as a fall and winter vegetable. Young, tender Brus- sels sprouts can be enjoyed raw, sliced into salads, or used as crudites. Note: For some people, especially for those prone to constipation, Brus- sels sprouts may induce gas and bloating; remember, however, that this reaction is caused by the vegetable's cleansing activity. Chopped cabbage leaves are used as a topical treatment on painful joints, bug bites or stings, burns, eczema, rashes, varicose veins, and wounds, including gangrene. In fact, they are a soothing poultice for just about any skin irritation. Try them on hemorrhoids! Many varieties of cabbage exist: Savoy (crinkly), bok choy, Napa (or Chinese), red, and white (sometimes called green). Look for firm, crisp heads with no evidence of decay or worm infestation. It is an inexpen- sive vegetable and stores well over the winter, especially if kept in a cool location. Cabbage can be stuffed, used in slaws, salads, and soups, or juiced. Fer- menting it, with or without the addition of salt, makes sauerkraut (rinse before serving to lower the sodium content). Unpasteurized sauerkraut con- tains microorganisms that promote healthy intestinal flora. Note: Cabbage contains goitergens, which can interfere with normal thyroid function when iodine levels are low. Regular consumption of sea vegetables will prevent iodine deficiencies. Some people complain that cab- bage causes gas, but this is probably the result of cabbage's action in loos- ening old bowel pockets, such as those that occur in diverticulitis. This action vanishes after being on a raw diet for several months. Cantaloupe is sweet and cooling. Cantaloupe is delightfully low in calories, and it is ideal for breaking a fast, being one of the easiest foods to digest. Ninety-four percent of a cantaloupe is highly mineralized water. In addition to those minerals, this fruit is rich in fiber, pectin, beta-carotene, vitamins B 6 and C, flavonoids, potassium, carbohydrates, and protein. The part of the melon close to the rind is rich in silicon. Cantaloupe also contains adenosine, a compound used in modern medicine as a blood-thinning agent. Cantaloupes are alkalinizing, anticoagulant, antioxidant, cleansing, diuretic, hydrating, laxative, rejuvenative, and yin tonic. They cool heat in the body and can benefit lung ailments. These melons have been used ther- apeutically to treat arthritis, poor blood quality and quantity, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, kidney and bladder disorders, obesity, rheuma- tism, and skin diseases. In China, cantaloupe is used to treat hepatitis. Look for cantaloupe that is symmetrical in shape and heavy for its size, with an even color and a warm, floral aroma. They are best when a hollow remains at the end where the stem was attached; melons that have a wet or soft stem end, or make a watery sound when shaken, are overripe. Search"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"RaWsomel out organic cantaloupe whenever possible, as the nonorganic ones general­ ly have high levels of pesticide residue. Cantaloupe is best eaten on its own or combined with other melons in a fruit salad. Peeled, seeded, and frozen melon run through a juicer makes an instant sorbet, and you can freeze melon juice in Popsicle holders for kids of all ages. Note: People who have diarrhea or feel chilled are better off saving melon for another time. Carob (Ceratonia s/V/V/wdJ -Fabaceae (Pea) Family Carob is sweet and alkaline, with a warm energy. It contains natural sug­ ars, pectin, calcium, and B-complex vitamins. It is best known as a substi­ tute for chocolate, but unlike chocolate, carob does not contain caffeine. As a therapeutic agent, carob calms nervousness and is mildly laxative. For a good snack, chew on a whole carob pod. Use powdered carob to give a chocolatey taste and appearance to smoothies and desserts. Look for real­ ly raw carob. Carrot (Daucus carota Sđf/Vđj -Apiaceae (Carrot) Family Carrots are sweet, alkaline, and warming. They contain beta-carotene, vitamins B 6 and C, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, pectin, and fiber, and their leaves are rich in flavonoids and potassium. Carrots have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, astringent, diuretic, galactagogic, laxative, and liver-tonic properties. They strengthen the stomach, spleen, liver, and lungs—if we all ate one carrot a day, lung cancer rates in our population could be cut in half. This root vegetable has been used as a urinary antiseptic to treat cystitis as well as bladder and kid­ ney stones. Carrots have also been used in treating acne, asthma, cancer, catarrh, colitis, constipation, cough, diarrhea, dry skin, eczema, gallstones, gastritis, gout, high cholesterol, indigestion, irritable bowel, jaundice, obe­ sity, parasites, pyorrhea, sore throat, tonsillitis, toxemia, ulcers, and vision problems such as dry eyes, Bitot's spots, and night blindness. Choose whole, unwilted, colorful carrots. Most commercially grown carrots are subject to a wide variety of chemical sprays and need to be peeled before being eaten, but organic carrots can be eaten with the peel still on, which is beneficial for our skin. Carrots are delicious in salads, soups, cakes, pies, and crudites. Young, fresh carrot tops can be used in sal­ ads too. Carrot juice is an excellent remedy to cleanse the liver but should be diluted with water, as it is very sweet. Rati Foods Encyclopedia 37 Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea botrytis)— Brassicaceae (Mustard) Family Cauliflower is pungent and sweet with a cooling energy. This vegetable is high in fiber and low in calories. Its white color denotes that it lacks the chlorophyll and carotenes of many of its more nutritious relatives. Cauli­ flower is rich, however, in vitamins B 6 and C, bioflavonoids, folic acid, biotin, boron, calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur. It also contains anticancer compounds, including indoles and sulforaphane. Cauliflower is antioxidant and alterative. It helps move blockages in the body, such as stuck chi, lumps, fibroids, and constipation, and dispel heat in the lungs. Because its anticancer compounds enhance enzyme activ­ ity that neutralizes carcinogens so they are unable to attack and transform cells, cauliflower is believed to reduce the risk of colon and stomach cancer in particular. It also aids in the body's metabolism of excess estrogen, help­ ing curb breast cancer and fibrocystic breast disease. Cauliflower has been used to treat acne, asthma, bladder and kidney disorders, constipation, high blood pressure, gout, and obesity. Consumed raw, it helps remedy bleeding gums. According to folklore, cauliflower is said to be beneficial for mental function because it resembles the brain. Look for firm, compact heads without brown spots. If the leaves (which are edible) are still attached, they should be fresh and green. Refrigerate cauliflower with the stem upward to prevent moisture from collecting on its top and hastening deterioration. Cauliflower can be chopped into salads, used as crudites, or made into soups or pates. It is best eaten raw, as cook­ ing deactivates its indole activity. Note: Eating large quantities of cauliflower may cause indigestion or flatulence in some people, especially if new to a raw diet. Celery (Apium graveo/ews)— Apiaceae (Carrot) Family Celery is cool in energy and its flavor is both sweet and bitter. It is about 95 percent water by volume but is rich in beta-carotene, folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, potassium, silica, sodium, chlorophyll, and fiber. The seeds and stalks contain a calming compound called phthalide, which can soothe a sensation of heat in the stomach when ingested. Celery also con­ tains coumarins, compounds believed beneficial in cancer prevention. One of the most alkaline of foods, celery helps neutralize acids in the body. It is considered blood purifying, diuretic, and tonic. It is used to cool and detoxify the liver and has a special affinity for the stomach and kidneys"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"RaWsome! as well. Celery helps dry overly damp conditions including yeast over- growth and excess phlegm. It is a traditional remedy for acne, arthritis, asthma, canker sores, constipation, diabetes, edema, eye inflammation, gallstones, gout, headache, hypertension, insomnia, cracking joints, nerv- ousness, obesity, pyorrhea, rheumatism, burning or bloody urination, ure- thritis, and wounds. After exercising, drinking celery juice helps replace lost electrolytes. The commercial celery crop is subject to intensive chemical \"support\": the plants are often grown in nitrate fertilizers and sometimes the leaves are blanched. For this reason, eat organic celery. Look for varieties that are darker green (more nutritious) and select stalks that are not cracked, dam- aged, or wilted. Celery can be enjoyed in salads and soups and as an alter- native to chips for dips. Spread raw almond butter into celery stalks for an afternoon treat. Celery makes an excellent vegetable juice, especially com- bined with carrot and apple. Note: During pregnancy, eat celery only in moderation, as it can pro- mote the onset of menses. Chayote (Sechium edule)— Curcurbitaceae (Gourd) Family Chayote (pronounced \"chy-O-tay\") is the pear-shaped fruit of a West Indi- an vine in the gourd family. Chayote is cooling and its flavor is similar to a blend of apple and cucumber. The smooth-skinned female fruit is lumpy with small ridges and is considered more delectable than the male fruit, which is covered with wartlike spines. Chayote was a staple food of the Aztecs and is high in vitamin C. In Central America, a tea made from the leaves is used to treat hypertension and arteriosclerosis. Look for chayote with unblemished skin and an ivory to dark green color. Avoid wet, bruised, or soft fruits. Store the fruit in a dry, cool place; in the refrigerator, it keeps for several days. Chayote can be substituted for summer squash in most recipes. It can also be enjoyed whole, sliced, grat- ed into salads, pureed, or added to soups. If the fruit is large, it should be peeled and seeded, but if the fruit is young and tender, the peel can be eaten. Young root tubers of chayote can be eaten as well. Cherimoya (Annona cherimola)— Annonaceae (Custard Apple) Family Inside the spiky, yellow-green skin of a cherimoya is a lush, white meat with a cooling energy and a delicious flavor similar to a combination of banana, blueberry, and pineapple. Related to soursop, it is rich in vitamin RaW Foods Encyclopedia C, calcium, and iron. Cherimoyas have been used to remedy acidosis, bad breath, constipation, and kidney and bladder inflammation. Cherimoya fruits are harvested while they are still firm and will ripen at room temperature on a sunny window. When ripe, they yield to the gen- tle pressure of a fingertip, much like an avocado. Avoid brown, bruised, or squishy fruits. Ripe cherimoyas will keep in the refrigerator for up to five days. Enjoy them plain or in fruit salads, sherbets, and smoothies. The seeds can be spit out. Cherry (Prunus avium, P. cerasus )—Rosaceae (Rose) Family Cherries are alkaline and sweet and considered to be warm—in the Orient, they are known as the \"fruit of fire.\" Cherries are rich in beta-carotene, vitamins B| and C, calcium, copper, iron, manganese, phosphorus, potassi- um, silicon, flavonoids, and pectin. They also contain ellagic acid, an anti- cancer compound. Cherries are a circulatory stimulant that dispel stagnation in the blood- stream and impart a rosy glow to the complexion. They make an excellent de- toxifying food, helping the body eliminate uric acid and cleanse the kidneys. They also function as a laxative, a stomach and spleen tonic, a stimulant, and a cavity preventative. Cherries are a traditional remedy for anemia, arthritis, asthma, catarrh, constipation, cramps, fatigue, gallstones and kidney stones, gout, high blood pressure, hypochondria, lumbago, measles, numbness, obesity, rheumatism, stunted growth, paralysis, and frequent urination. Cherries are one of the most chemically contaminated fruits, so it is always best to buy organic whenever possible. Select fully colored, plump, glossy-skinned cherries with fresh, green stems. The darker the cherry, the more minerals it contains. Avoid any that are soft, leaking, brown, or moldy. Cherries can be enjoyed plain or in fruit salads, pies, jams, puddings, smoothies, and juices. They can also be dried for year-round consumption. Note: Because cherries increase circulation and warmth in the body, avoid eating them in cases of extreme heat, such as fever. Chive (Allium schoenoprasum )—ti\\\\acea.e (Lily) Family Chives are pungent with a warm energy. They are rich in beta-carotene, B- complex vitamins, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and sulfur. Chives promote the circulation of energy and blood and help dry excess dampness in the body. Considered to be an antiseptic and a digestive aid, they have a special affinity for the liver, kidneys, and stomach. They help"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Ill RauJsome! clean the circulatory system, lower blood pressure, and inhibit the growth of viruses, fungi, and unfriendly yeasts. Chives are used to treat stom- achache and arthritis due to internal coldness, to strengthen the kidneys, and to increase sex drive. Chives complement the flavor of many other vegetables including car- rots, onions, and potatoes, and are often added as a garnish. The hollow stalks can be used fresh or dried. The edible, purple flowers have a peppery taste and make an attractive garnish as well. Col lard See Kale and Collard (page 47). Cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus, V. macrocarpon)- Ericaceae (Heath) Family Cranberries are acidic and sour, with cool energy. They contain vitamin C, bioflavonoids, ellagic acid (an anticancer compound), and fiber. Their high flavonoid content is believed to be beneficial in the formation of visual purple, a pigment in the eyes that is essential to night vision. Cranberries have antiscorbutic (scurvy-preventing), bronchodilating, antifungal, antiviral, and vasodilating properties. They have been used to treat asthma, burning urination, cancer, cystitis, diabetes, fever, hemor- rhoids, kidney stones, poor appetite, skin disorders, and urinary tract infec- tions. A urinary antiseptic, cranberries inhibit the adhesion of bacteria (including E. coli) to the urinary tract, perhaps through the action of a polymer contained in the fruit. Look for plump, bright red, shiny, hard cranberries, and avoid those that are soft, leaky, or shriveled. Good cranberries actually tend to bounce. They keep for up to a couple of months in the refrigerator. Cranberries are tart but can be sweetened with honey or dates and used in jams, relishes, sauces, breads, cakes, and stuffing, as well as being juiced. Dried cranber- ries can also replace raisins in any recipe. Note: Cranberries contain tannic and oxalic acids, which, if overingest- ed, can contribute to the formation of kidney stones and inhibit the body's absorption of iron and calcium. For this reason, cranberries should be con- sumed only in moderation. Rarf Foods Encyclopedia 11 help relieve summer heat, helping one feel \"cool as a cucumber.\" Although not regarded as highly nutritive (being 96 percent water), cucumbers con- tain erepsin, an enzyme that helps digest proteins and kill tapeworm. In addition, they contain phosphorus, potassium, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and folic acid, and the peel is rich in silicon and chlorophyll. Cucumbers are both diuretic and laxative. They help moisten the lungs and are considered therapeutic for people suffering from acne, conjunctivitis, depression, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, pyorrhea, skin and stomach inflammation, sore throat, sunburn, and tapeworm. By reducing uric acid lev- els, cucumbers aid in dissolving kidney stones. In addition, the peel's high sil- icon content is believed to encourage healthy growth of skin, nails, and hair. Cucumber can also help heal from the outside. Mashed cucumber applied topically cools burns, wasp stings, and tired, swollen feet. As a facial, it clears up acne and encourages wrinkle-free skin. Cucumber slices placed on puffy, tired eyes reduce redness and inflammation. Look for young, small to medium-sized cucumbers with deep green skins. Overly large cucumbers are overgrown and bitter. Avoid cucumbers with yellowish skin or puffy, withered ends. Commercial cucumbers are often waxed and should be peeled before being eaten, but the peels from organically cultivated cucumbers can be consumed. Enjoy cucumbers sliced, juiced, or chopped and added to yogurt dish- es, salads, dressings, and relish. Try stuffing cucumbers by scooping out the seeds and pulp and filling with a mixture of sun-cured olives, chopped cel- ery, and red bell pepper tossed with a bit of dressing. Note: People who are excessively cold or weak or who have a health condition (such as diarrhea) involving excess dampness should avoid eating large amounts of cucumber. Date (Phoenix dactylifera )-Pa\\rr\\aceae (Palm) Family Dates are sweet, moistening, and easy to digest, with a warm energy. They are high in carbohydrates, glutamic acid, tyramine, niacin, boron, copper, iron, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. Dates have strengthening, spleen-tonic, blood-tonic, energy-tonic, yflttg-tonic, and laxative properties. They have been used to treat anemia, bronchitis, catarrh, colitis, dry cough, low blood pressure, erectile dysfunc- tion, hysteria, nervousness, palpitations, weak stomach, sore throat, and stomach ulcers. Dates are also recommended as a galactagogue for encour- aging milk production in nursing mothers. Cucumber is slightly bitter, alkaline, and cool in energy. Eating it can truly"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"RaWsomel Although good dates are somewhat moist, they are naturally low in water and do not usually require drying after being harvested; however, they are sometimes fumigated with chemicals, pasteurized, frozen, or pre- served with glucose to discourage mold, so investigate their source. Keep them in the refrigerator, as they can ferment at room temperature. Dates are delightfully delicious on their own, as a sweetener in raw desserts such as ice cream, puddings, cakes, cookies, and pies, or used to make chutneys and jams. They are also a great transition food for people who are trying to give up sugar and junk food. (I like to stuff a date with raw almond butter: with this trick, 1 was able to give up chocolate easily!) Note: People prone to migraines, obesity, diabetes, and hypoglycemia should limit their intake of dates. Be sure to brush your teeth or rinse your mouth after eating dates, as their stickiness clings to the teeth. Durian (Durio zibethinus )-Bombaceae (Durian) Family Durians are the large, tasty fruit of one of the world's largest fruit trees, and a preferred food of wild elephants, orangutans, and tigers. Durians are high in oleic fats, vitamin E, and sulfur, and contain more protein than any other fruits. Despite their prickly rind and what many deem to be a foul, sul- furous smell, they are considered an aphrodisiac, as well as a longevity food, a vermifuge (worm-dispelling agent), and a strong blood cleanser. Select durians with a brown or yellowish color, rather than green. (Although yellowish fruits tend to be overripe, this is an exception.) Avoid fruits with soft spots or holes, which can indicate mold or worms. A duri- an's ripeness can be determined by a sweet, pungent aroma, flattened spines, and a hollow sound when the fruit is tapped on the bottom with a heavy knife. If it is not quite ripe, it will continue to ripen if left out at room temperature. Durians can be frozen for long-term storage and thawed for eight to twenty-four hours before consumption. To eat a durian, simply split it open and scoop out the cream-colored meat. The seeds should be picked out and discarded. Rati Foods Encyclopedia 13 eggplant's cancer-protective qualities, as a Japanese study showed it to be somewhat mutagenic.) Eggplant has antiseptic, diuretic, and hemostatic properties. It helps dispel toxic heat from the body and improves blood circulation. It is used to relieve colitis, constipation, bleeding hemorrhoids, pain, hypertension, stomach ulcers, swelling, and tumors. A study at the University of Texas showed that eating eggplant impedes the rise in blood cholesterol levels that normally follows the consumption of fatty foods. The purple variety of eggplant is most common, though it also comes in red, white, and yellow. Look for firm eggplant that is heavy for its size. Eggplant's meatlike flavor is excellent in many vegetarian dishes. Try mar- inating raw eggplant in a bit of tamari, lemon juice, and olive oil, and puree it into a dip. It can even be sliced thinly into noodles. To get rid of any bit- terness and excess moisture in eggplant, many people slice it, cover it with a sprinkling of salt, place a weighted plate on top, wait thirty minutes, and then rinse it. This process is optional, however, because good eggplants are not bitter. Note: Eggplant contains solanine, which in large amounts inhibits cal- cium absorption. Some individuals with arthritis find that abstaining from eggplant and other foods in the nightshade family (peppers, potatoes, and tomatoes) reduces their symptoms. During pregnancy, eat eggplant only in small amounts. Endive and Escarole (Cichorium species )-Asteraceae (Daisy) Family Escarole and endive are close relatives of chicory. All of these greens are fairly bitter, cool in energy, and moist. Endive has narrow, curled, finely divided leaves, whereas escarole, in general, has broader, flatter leaves. Both are rich in beta-carotene, vitamin C, calcium, iron, magnesium, phospho- rus, and potassium. The bitter flavor of endive and escarole stimulates the secretion of diges- tive juices including bile. These greens help rid the body of infection, increase the appetite, and have diuretic, laxative, and tonic properties. They are ther- apeutic for the heart, gallbladder, and liver, and are considered nourishing to the eyes and exciting to the central nervous system. Endive and escarole have been used in traditional medicine to remedy acidosis, arthritis, asthma, Can- dida overgrowth, constipation, diabetes, edema, gas, gout, hypertension, hypoglycemia, jaundice, liver enlargement, obesity, rheumatism, and inflam- matory skin conditions such as acne, boils, and eczema. Eggplant is cooling with a sweet flavor. It contains potassium, biofla- vonoids, and antioxidant compounds called monoterpenes that are believed to offer protection against cancer and heart disease. Eggplant also contains glycoalkaloids, substances that are used topically to treat skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma. (However, there is conflicting evidence on"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"11 RaWsome! Endive and escarole are traditionally eaten in the spring as blood puri- fiers. Look for green unwilted leaves. Both the inner and outer leaves are edible, though the mellower inner leaves are used more often. They are best when mixed in salads with milder greens. Fig (Ficus carica)— Moraceae (Mulberry) Family Figs are sweet and alkaline, with a warming energy. They are rich in vita- min Bg, folic acid, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phos- phorus, and potassium. They have a high content of mucin, a soothing laxative. Figs also contain the compound benzaldehyde, which has been shown in Japanese studies to shrink tumors, as well as a sulfur compound called ficin, which helps reduce joint and tissue inflammation and is used to treat injuries. This fruit is antibacterial, antiparasitic, and restorative. Considered a neutralizer of toxins, figs are suggested for consumption during times of cleansing. They have a special affinity for the stomach, spleen, and pan- creas, help moisten the lungs and large intestines, and improve liver func- tion, which can result in improved eyesight. Figs are used to treat anemia, arthritis, asthma, low blood pressure, cancer, catarrh, colitis, cough, dysen- tery, emaciation, exhaustion, gout, hemorrhoids, pleurisy, rheumatism, sore throat, tuberculosis, and ulcers. They are also used to deter cravings for sugar, alcohol, and drugs. Look for figs that are free of mold. Enjoy fresh or dried figs as a snack or for dessert. Try them stuffed with raw almond butter. Use them like dates to sweeten cookies, pies, and puddings. Soak dried figs overnight in water for a breakfast compote. As they are very sweet, figs should be eaten only sparingly by people desiring to lose weight; however, they are an excel- lent food for body builders and people wanting to gain weight. Note: Excess consumption of figs may cause diarrhea. Of all the dried fruits, dried figs are considered the healthiest, but be sure to avoid those treated with the preservative potassium sorbate. Remember to brush your teeth after eating dried figs, because their stickiness clings to the teeth and can contribute to tooth decay. Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi, C. decumana )-Ruta.ceae (Citrus) Family Grapefruit is classified as alkaline, cold, sweet, and sour. Grapefruit con- tains vitamin C, folic acid, calcium, iron, and potassium, as well as many anticancer compounds including flavonoids (found especially in the white RaW Foods Encyclopedia 45 inner rind and peel), terpenes, limonoids, and coumarins. Its phenolic com- pounds help the body produce substances that help detoxify carcinogens such as nitrosamines, and its pectin content helps in lowering blood cho- lesterol levels and dissolving arterial plaque. Grapefruit also contains naringin, an anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic flavonoid that helps elimi- nate old red blood cells from the body. Pink grapefruit contains lycopene, which is an antioxidant carotene. Grapefruit has antimutagenic, antiseptic, antiviral, detoxifying, diuret- ic, and liver-cleansing properties. It helps promote the circulation of energy and clears heat and toxins from the body. It also helps remove inorganic calcium deposits and prevent heart attacks, stroke, and cancers, especially cancers of the pancreas and stomach. Grapefruit is used in treatments for numerous conditions including alcohol intoxication, atherosclerosis, bad breath, belching, broken capillaries, catarrh, constipation, cough, fever, gallstones, indigestion, jaundice, lupus, pneumonia, rheumatism, skin inflammation, and obesity. Look for grapefruits that are firm but springy to the touch and heavy for their size. Thin-skinned fruits tend to be juicier. Grapefruits are best stored in a cool room rather than the refrigerator, and placing them in a closed bag encourages ripening. Enjoy grapefruit on its own or in fruit sal- ads. It can also be juiced, although it's best to eat the whole fruit, because many of the important compounds, such as pectin, are in the pulp. Grapes (Vitis vinifera)— Vitaceae (Grape) Family Grapes are sweet, sour, and cooling. They contain beta-carotene, B-com- plex vitamins, vitamin C, boron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and pectin. In addition to malic, citric, and oxalic acids, grapes also contain ellagic acid, a compound that scavenges carcinogenic factors and moves them out of the body. Grape skins contain resveratrol, which prevents platelet aggregation and elevates levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the bloodstream. Red- and purple-skinned varieties are more strengthening, more blood building, and richer in iron than white or green varieties, and also contain the antioxidant quercitin. Grapes containing seeds are rich in procyanolic oligomers and leukocyanidins, which are both types of antioxidant flavonoids that are used to treat varicose veins and other vein disorders as well as atherosclerosis. The outer layers of grape seeds contain tartaric acid, which helps cleanse catarrh from the body."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"10 Raw some! Grapes are easy to digest and arc considered therapeutic for the lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen. They have antibacterial, antiviral, and diuretic properties. Being highly alkaline, they help the body eliminate uric acid. They are a blood and chi tonic and nourish the yin fluids of the body. Grapes have been used therapeutically to strengthen the sinews and bones and to treat cancer, constipation, cough, digestive disorders, edema, gout, hepatitis, jaundice, and rheumatism, and strengthen immunity. They also help improve mental focus. Purchase fresh grapes with a powdery blush that look firm, rather than soggy, where the fruits attach to the stem. A bunch with lots of small, green berries is likely to have been picked unripe and will be sour. Grapes are among the most pesticide-laden of all fruits in a grocery store, so go for organic ones or avoid them altogether. Pick off any bad grapes after pur- chase and store the bunch in the refrigerator, where it should keep for a couple of weeks. Grapes are excellent by themselves or in fruit salads, jel- lies, or juices. Note: Raisins, of course, are dried grapes with many of the same prop- erties as fresh grapes; they have an even higher concentration of sugar, however, so people with diabetes or hypoglycemia should ingest them with caution. Like other dried fruits, raisins can stick to the teeth and promote dental decay, so rinse your mouth or brush your teeth after eating them. Because grapes (and raisins) contain salicylates, people with aspirin sensi- tivity may react adversely to them. Jalapeno See Cayenne and Jalapeno Pepper (page 106). Jicama (Pachyrhizus erosus, P. tuberosus)- Fab ace ae (Pea) Family The root vegetable jicama (pronounced \"HEE-ka-ma\") has a flavor similar to that of water chestnut, and many restaurants use it as a less-expensive substitute. Jicama is rich in beta-carotene, B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and potassium. Select jicama that is firm and heavy for its size. Overly large or shriv- eled jicama is likely to be woody and tough. Jicama can be stored whole and unwrapped in the refrigerator for several weeks, but storing it in plas- tic accelerates mold growth. Once jicama is cut, it is best to use it within a day or two. Peel it, slice it like potato chips, and serve it with dips. In Latin America, it is common to serve sliced jicama with a squeeze of lemon or RaW Foods Encyclopedia 17 Kale and collard greens are very similar, but kale often has curly leaves, and while collards thrive in a warmer climate, kale grows best in a cooler one. Both are considered warming, with a sweet, slightly bitter-pungent flavor similar to that of cabbage. Kale and collards are rich in iron, potassium, sul- fur, beta-carotene, vitamin C, folic acid, chlorophyll, and calcium—in fact, 1 cup of kale or collard greens has more calcium than 1 cup of milk. They also contain indoles that protect against colon, breast, and lung cancer. Kale and collards have antibiotic and antiviral properties. They benefit the stomach, dispel lung congestion, rejuvenate the liver, and have been used to treat arthritis, constipation, dental problems, gout, obesity, pyor- rhea, skin disorders, and ulcers. Select tender, dark green, or even bluish-green leaves, avoiding those that are yellowed. Kale and collard greens can be finely chopped and added to salads, steamed, stir-fried, made into soup, or included in vegetable juices. Note: People with an overly acidic condition may find that kale and col- lards are intcstinally cleansing and may therefore cause flatulence when ini- tially \"going raw.\" This can be prevented by adding a bit of ginger, cumin, or caraway to the greens. Kiwi (Actinida chinensis)— Actinidiaceae (Kiwi) Family Kiwis are cool, sweet, and sour. They are rich in fiber, vitamin C (having twice that of oranges), and potassium. Like papaya and pineapple, kiwi contains enzymes that aid the digestion of proteins and speed the healing of sores, wounds, and inflammation. Because of these enzymes, kiwi cannot be used in gelatin or agar dishes, as they will inhibit the jelling effect. Kiwi improves blood circulation and has been used to remove excess sodium from the body, as well as to treat high blood pressure, heartburn, and indigestion. In Oriental medicine, this fruit is recommended to treat breast and stomach cancer, and as a tonic for developing children and post- partum women. The commercial kiwi crop tends to be heavily sprayed, so look for an organic source. Kiwis should be firm but not too hard, yielding just slight- ly to the pressure of a fingertip. They will ripen at room temperature and lime and a dash of salt. Jicama can be juiced, grated into a salad, or grated to the size of rice grains and used as a rice replacement."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"•1« RaWsome! Lemons are sour and alkaline, and are considered cooling. Compared to oranges, they are more acidic and less sweet. Lemons are high in vitamin C and potassium. They also contain limonene, which is used to dissolve gall- stones and is being studied for its anticancer properties. Limonene is most prevalent in the white, inner portion of the rind. Lemons have antiparasitic, antiseptic, astringent, phlegm-resolving, refrigerant, and antiseptic properties: lemon juice poured experimentally into shellfish destroyed 92 percent of the bacteria in the shellfish within 15 minutes. Lemon improves the assimilation of minerals by the body. It also stimulates bile production, which helps cleanse the liver and lower choles- terol. Lemons are used medicinally to treat asthma, bronchitis, colds, fever, gallstones, headache, indigestion, obesity, and neuritis. Lemon juice can be applied topically to calm itchy insect bites, pimples, corns, warts, boils, and poison ivy. A cotton ball saturated with lemon juice and applied inside the nostril can be used to stop a nosebleed. After sham- pooing, the juice of a lemon added to the final rinse water refreshes the scalp and promotes shiny hair. The juice of half a lemon in a cup of warm water can be used as a gargle for sore throats. Although it might sting, lemon juice can also be used as an antiseptic agent on cuts. Look for thin-skinned, bright yellow lemons. Lemons tinged with green are likely to be more acidic, and thick-skinned lemons will have less juice. RaW Foods Encyclopedia Add lemon juice to fruits and vegetables to preserve their color. Substitute lemon juice for vinegar in salad dressings. The juice of half a lemon in a glass of warm water is a great way to start the day, as opposed to coffee. Grated lemon rind gives food a zesty flavor, but if you're going to use the rind, make sure it's organic, because nonorganic lemons are often coated in wax. Note: Lemons should not be sucked on, as their acid content can dam- age dental enamel. They help thin the blood and so should be used cau- tiously by people who are overly thin, weak, or irritable. Also, lemons contain psoralens, compounds that can make one photosensitive. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa)— Asteraceae (Daisy) Family Lettuce is alkaline, bitter, sweet, and cool. It can be 92 to 95 percent water, but also contains chlorophyll, lactucin (a calming alkaloid), beta-carotene, folic acid, vitamins Bj, B^, C, E, and K, and the minerals calcium, iron, potassium, and silicon. Although about 75 percent of the lettuce consumed in the United States is the iceberg variety, this is the least nutritious of all let- tuces. Darker varieties like bibb, Boston, and romaine are more nutritious. Lettuce has anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antispasmodic, diuretic, expectorant, galactagogic, and sedative properties. It helps dry excess dampness in the body, including yeast overgrowth and phlegm, and is considered beneficial in helping prevent stomach and endometrial can- cers, cataracts, heart disease, and stroke. Lettuce has a slowing effect upon digestion and has been used to treat acid indigestion, anemia, arthritis, catarrh, colitis, constipation, cough, gastritis, gout, insomnia, irritable bowel, obesity, sexual addiction, stress, and ulcers. In 1753, the Scottish naval surgeon James Lind demonstrated in a controlled experiment that citrus fruits cured scurvy, which at the time was a common, life-threatening ailment for seafarers, who went months without any fresh pro- duce. Still, it took 45 years and the death of 200,000 more British sailors before Lind's finding was taken seriously. In 1795, the British Admiralty ordered members of the Royal Navy to take daily rations of lemon or lime juice (with a ration of rum) to prevent scurvy: hence the nickname \"limeys\" now applied to British sailors. can then be kept in the refrigerator for up to nine months. Most people peel kiwi before eating them. Enjoy kiwi plain, in fruit salads, in desserts, as a garnish, in marinades, or juiced (along with the seeds and peel). Kumquat (Fortunella margarita )-Ruta.ceae (Citrus) Family Kumquats are pungent, sweet, and sour, with a warm energy. They are high in vitamin C, most of which is in the peel, as well as vitamin E. Kumquats promote chi circulation and are mucolytic (help break up phlegm). They have been used to treat fevers, gallstones, indigestion, hernial pain, stom- achache, hepatitis, high blood pressure, prolapse of the uterus and anus, asthma, catarrh, cough, pneumonia, respiratory congestion, and whooping cough. Look for firm, plump, golden fruits that are heavy for their size. Kumquats can be eaten whole (peel and seeds included), made into jams, used as a garnish, added to desserts, dried, or preserved in honey."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"50 RaWsomel Look for fresh, crisp greens without signs of decay. Buy organic lettuces whenever possible, as nonorganic lettuces are generally laden with pesti- cides. Lettuce keeps best in its own sealed container. Storing it with apples, pears, and tomatoes, all of which naturally emit ethylene gas, will cause let- tuce to turn brown more quickly. In the raw diet, lettuce can be used in sal- ads, sandwiches, and hors d'oeuvres, and to make \"wraps\" stuffed with tasty fillings. Lime (Citrus hystrix, C. aurantifolius, C. latifolia )—Rutaceae (Citrus) Family Limes are sour, cooling in energy, and rich in vitamin C, bioflavonoids, and potassium. Considered antioxidant, antiseptic, and astringent, limes improve ener- gy circulation and stimulate bile production. They are also used in treat- ments for arthritis, colds, constipation, edema, fever, flu, gallstones, high blood pressure, liver dysfunction, obesity, phlegm, and uterine and anal prolapse. And if you're in the tropics and happen to have a run-in with fire coral, squeeze lime juice over the affected area to cool the burn. Select firm limes that are heavy for their size. They should be solid green, but yellow mottling is also acceptable, as limes left on the tree to ripen fully can turn yellow and be even more flavorful. Limes have a short- er shelf life than lemons do; refrigerated limes keep longer and do not devel- op mold, but give less juice. If you're going to use the rind, make sure the fruit is organic, because nonorganic limes are often coated in wax. Limes can be substituted for lemons in most recipes. Use lime juice to make limeade, salad dressings, margaritas, sorbets, and pies. A squeeze of lime juice also helps prevent the discoloration of cut fruits such as apples and avocados. Note: Like lemons, limes (especially the peels) contain psoralens, which can make one photosensitive. Litchee (Litchi chinensis)— Sapindaceae (Lychee) Family Litchee (also spelled lychee or lichi) is a sweet fruit just a bit smaller than a walnut, with a flavor reminiscent of grapes and an aroma like a rose. Fresh litchee fruits have a cool energy, but when dried, they are called litchee nuts and have a warm energy. Litchee contains vitamins Bj and B2, niacin, and vitamin C. Litchee is considered a blood and yin tonic that improves the circula- Rau/ Foods Encyclopedia 51 tion of energy. The fruits are used to relieve asthma, cough, diarrhea, hernial pain, tumors, and glandular enlargements. The nuts are used in Oriental med- icine to enhance intelligence and make one's complexion more beautiful. Look for plump, uncracked litchee fruits. Enjoy them alone as a snack or in fruit salads and sherbets. In the Orient, litchees are often eaten at the end of a meal or served in syrup. The inner seed is not edible. Lycium Berry (Lycium chinense )—So\\anaceae (Nightshade) Family Lycium berries, also known as wolfberries or goji berries (the more popu- lar term in the raw food community), are sweet and considered neutral. They are highly nutritive, containing beta-carotene, vitamins Bj, B2, and C, and linoleic acid. These berries are said to \"brighten the spirit,\" and pro- longed use promotes cheerfulness. Lycium berries have many virtues, including being an aphrodisiac, a rejuvenative, and a tonic for the blood, energy, liver, and yin (fluids) of the body. They help remove toxins from the blood by strengthening the kidneys and liver, and protect the liver against damage from toxin exposure. They are also a supreme eye food, helping with night blindness and blurred or poor vision. Lycium berries have been used to treat anemia, asthma, bronchial inflammation, diabetes mellitus, erectile dysfunction, pneumonia, tuberculosis, vertigo, and weak knees and back. Look for bright red lycium berries that have not been treated with sul- fur. Eat them plain like raisins, added to trail mix, or mixed into a smooth- ie (soaked first to facilitate blending). Mango (Mangifera indica)— Anacardiaceae (Cashew) Family Mango is sweet and sour, with a cooling energy. It is rich in amino acids, beta-carotene, niacin, vitamins C and E, flavonoids, calcium, iron, magne- sium, and potassium. Mango also contains pectin, which is useful in low- ering blood cholesterol levels. This fruit is considered a yin tonic, providing moistening fluids for the body and quenching thirst. It has alterative (blood purifying), antiseptic, diuretic, and laxative properties. Mangoes have been used to treat anemia, bleeding gums, clogged pores, constipation, cough, cysts, fever, hyperten- sion, indigestion, nausea, nephritis (kidney inflammation), nausea, respira- tory ailments, seasickness, and weak digestion. They calm the emotions, benefit the brain, strengthen the heart, and provide energy. Some mango species do not turn red, yellow, or orange, which means"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"yl Rau/some! Olives have been cultivated for more than 4,000 years. The fruits of the olive tree are sweet, pungent, hot, and moist in nature, in addition to con­ taining linoleic, linolenic, and oleic acids and lecithin, olives are an excel­ lent, vegan source of protein. Rati Foods Encyclopedia 53 Olives have antioxidant, antiseptic, demulcent, emollient, laxative, nutritive, and tonic properties. They have been used in treatments for gall­ stones and gout and as preventatives for heart disease and ulcers. Before they can be eaten, olives must be cured in salt, oil, or vinegar. Green olives are harvested and cured unripe, and therefore are more acidic in flavor. Black olives arc collected and cured when ripe. Look for olives that have been sun-cured rather than pasteurized, canned, or otherwise heated. Onion (Allium cepa)— Liliaceae (Lily) Family Onions are pungent with a hot energy. They are a good source of beta- carotene, vitamins B and C, potassium, selenium, and sulfur. Because of their anticancer phyrochemicals, including cepaene, disulfides, trisulfides, and quercitin, they are considered a supreme food in preventing stomach and skin cancer and tumor growth. Onions also contain small amounts of prostaglandins Al and E, which help in lowering high blood pressure. These bulbs are antibiotic, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, diuretic, expectorant, laxative, sedative, and tonic. Onions help prevent blood platelet aggregation, have a cleansing effect upon the lymphs, warm the kidney's yang, stimulate the liver, dispel phlegm and respiratory congestion, and help prevent heart attack and stroke. They are used to treat anxiety, flu, atherosclerosis, asthma, blood clots, bronchitis, catarrh, colds, cough, diabetes, hay fever, hypoglycemia, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hoarseness, insomnia, obesity, parasitic invasion, pneumo­ nia, rheumatism, sinus congestion, tuberculosis, and urinary infections. Onions can be strong or mild, with white being the mildest. Red and yel­ low onions have more antioxidants than other varieties. Look for firm onions with dry skins that are free of soft spots, and store them in a cool, dry place. Scallions, along with chives and leeks, are milder relatives of onion. Many people become teary when cutting into onions, as a result of the volatile, sulfurous oil found in the bulb. Peeling and chopping onions under cold, running water prevents the vapors from rising to the eyes. Enjoy onions in salads, dressings, vegetable dishes, and soups. Banish onion breath by eating some parsley sprigs. Note: Onions cause flatulence or bowel irritation in some people. Orange (Citrus sinensis, C. aurantium )—RutćLceae (Citrus) Family Oranges are alkaline, cooling, sweet, sour, moistening, and cleansing. In addition to vitamin C, oranges contain beta-carotene, vitamin B 1? folic acid, that with some varieties you are likely to buy them green and must look for other signs of ripeness. A ripe mango yields to the pressure of a fingertip and has a sweet fragrance. Putting a mango in a paper bag in a warm place helps the ripening process. Avoid shriveled fruits with large, dark areas on their skin, as these are overripe. Eat mango by itself—enjoy a mango in the bathtub so you don't have to worry about the mess! Share one with your beloved. Add mango to fruit salads or use it in pies, ice creams and sorbets, smoothies, juices, and salsas. Note: Some people are allergic to mangoes, especially to the juice under the peel. It's not surprising—after all, this fruit is in the plant family Anac- ardiaceae, along with poison ivy. Okra is commonly used in Creole cooking. It has a sweet bland flavor and cooling energy. Okra is a rich source of beta-carotene, B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. Its rich elec­ trolyte content helps preserve the body's balance of fluids, which is neces­ sary for nerve impulse transmission. Okra also contains pectin, which helps lower blood cholesterol levels. Being very alkaline, okra helps neutralize acids and provides a tempo­ rary, protective coating for the digestive tract. As a bulk laxative, it helps lubricate the large intestine. Okra is a supreme vegetable for people who feel weak, exhausted, or depressed. It has been used to treat lung inflam­ mation, irritable bowel, sore throat, and ulcers, and to keep joints limber. Topically, an okra poultice can be applied to heal burns or to soothe poison ivy or psoriasis, and okra juice can be used as a gargle for sore throats. Select okra that are small (less than 4 inches long), firm, and resilient for maximum tenderness. Wheel-like slices of okra can be added to salads or used in soups as a thickener. Try it in dips or added to vegetable juices. Okra combines well with tomatoes, which minimize its gelatinous consis­ tency. Dried okra pods can be ground into high-protein flour, and okra seeds can be pressed for their edible oil."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":".11 RaWsomel calcium, potassium, glutathione, and pectin. Orange essential oil contains limonene, which has been found to shrink tumors. When eating oranges, be sure to consume some of the inner membrane, where the flavonoids, includ- ing rutin and hesperidin, are located. Oranges are a circulatory stimulant and a cardiac and immune tonic with alterative, antioxidant, antifungal, antiseptic, antiviral, and carmina- tive properties. Their high vitamin C content helps counteract carcinogens called nitrosamines, and the fruit has been used to help prevent bladder, breast, cervical, esophageal, lung, pancreatic, rectal, and stomach cancer. Oranges are also used to treat arthritis, rheumatism, asthma, bronchitis, catarrh, colds, fever, flu, pneumonia, tuberculosis, arteriosclerosis, throm- bosis, broken capillaries, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and consti- pation. Some alcoholics find that drinking fresh-squeezed orange juice reduces cravings for alcohol. Look for firm oranges that are heavy for their size, and avoid those that are puffy or spongy or have soft spots. Store them in a cool place (but they do not need to be kept refrigerated). If an orange develops mold, remove it from the others so they don't quickly follow suit. Oranges are best eaten fresh, juiced, tossed with mixed greens, or made into fruit sal- ads, pies, sherbets, sauces, or other desserts. Orange peel, also known as orange zest, is a digestive aid and a popular garnish; nonorganic oranges are often waxed, however, so if you're going to use the peel, be sure to get organic fruit. Note: Some people find that eating oranges causes them to break out in a rash. In many cases, the rash is the result of an increased discharge of tox- ins that is stimulated by the oranges, and will clear up when the cleansing is complete. Avoid excess consumption of oranges in cases of stomach ulcers or stomach or intestinal inflammation. Papaya (Carica papaya )-Carkaceae (Pawpaw) Family Papaya is sweet and bitter, with a neutral to cooling energy. Papaya is high in beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. It also contains the protease (protein-digesting enzyme) papain, which is an anticancer agent, and carpaine, an anti-tumorigenic compound. This fruit is a digestive aid and tonifies the stomach. It has anti-inflam- matory, antiparasitic, anti-tumorigenic, emmenagogic, and emollient prop- erties; although it helps dry excess dampness in the body, it moistens the lungs. Papaya has traditionally been used to treat allergies, arteriosclerosis, RaW Foods Encyclopedia 55 cancer, catarrh, colds, cough, diarrhea, diverticulitis, dysentery, flatulence, gastritis, menstrual irregularities, rheumatism, stomachache, and ulcers. It can also help reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack. When consumed regularly, papaya improves the health of the skin, hair, nails, and eyes. The unripe fruit can be mashed and used in facial masks to nourish the skin and lighten freckles, or applied as a poultice for tumors. The enzyme papain is found in highest concentrations in the milky juice of the unripe papaya—little of it occurs in the ripe fruit. Papain is used to treat allergies, asthma, indigestion, chronic diarrhea, digestive disorders, gluten intolerance, hay fever, sports injuries, and weak lungs, and is dabbed topically on warts. Papain powder is applied to bee stings to reduce pain and inflammation, and is also used as a tooth and gum cleanser. Select smooth, unblemished papayas that are heavy for their size, and avoid those that are entirely green, shriveled, or marked with dark spots. A ripe papaya will yield slightly when pressed, and at least half of its skin will be a deep yellow, orange, or red. If you buy one that is slightly underripe, leave it out at room temperature to ripen. Enjoy papaya plain or in fruit sal- ads, pies, puddings, ice creams and sorbets, salsas, and smoothies. Note: The latex exuded by an unripe papaya may cause contact der- matitis in some people. Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa)— Apiaceae (Carrot) Family The sweet, warming parsnip looks like a pale version of its relative, the carrot (both are members of the Apiaceae, the carrot family). Parsnip contains beta-carotene, folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, potassium, silicon, pectin, and fiber. It is also rich in carbohydrates, making parsnip a good substitute when you have a craving for processed sugars and starches. This root vegetable has analgesic, diaphoretic, diuretic, and laxative properties. Parsnip is considered therapeutic for the liver, spleen, pancreas, and stomach, and has been used to rid the body of kidney, bladder, and gall- stones. It has also been used in treatments for colds, colitis, cough, gout, headache, hemorrhoids, ulcers, and shortness of breath. Because parsnip builds strength and corrects states of deficiency, it is considered strength- ening for people with hypoglycemia or tuberculosis, and for people recov- ering from serious illness or surgery. Look for smooth, firm, well-shaped roots of small to medium size. Nonorganic parsnips are often treated with wax as a preservative and should be peeled before being eaten. Parsnips are at their sweetest once they"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"56 Raw some! have been exposed to cold temperatures (such as those preceding a frost) for a couple of weeks. Mash them as an alternative to mashed potatoes, grate a small amount onto salads, or use them in vegetable juice combinations. Note: Avoid consuming parsnip leaves, which are considered toxic. Pea (Pisum Sđt/Vwm )-Fabaceae (Pea) Family Peas are sweet, alkaline, and moistening, and are considered neutral in temperature. They contain protein, fiber, chlorophyll, carbohydrates, beta- carotene, B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, iron, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc. Due to their content of an anti-fertility substance called m-mylohydroquinone, peas have been investigated as a potential contraceptive agent for both men and women. Peas also contain protease inhibitors and isoflavones, which inhibit the activation of carcinogens. Peas are anti-inflammatory, galactagogic, and laxative. They are tonify- ing to the liver, spleen, pancreas, and stomach, and may also help stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. Peas have been used to remedy anemia, boils, high cholesterol, constipation, cough, diabetes, edema, hiccoughs, hypoglycemia, and spasms, and to relieve ulcer pain. Look for crisp, fresh peas with shiny pods that squeak when rubbed together. If they are young and tender, peas can even be eaten in the pod. (Snow peas are a variety with pods that remain tender and edible through maturation.) They can be enjoyed as a snack, added to salads, pates, casseroles, juices, or soups. Fresh peas are easier to digest than dried peas. Note: If peas are consumed in excess, they can be thyroid inhibiting. They also contain compounds called purines, which can aggravate gout in people prone to the disorder. Peach (Prunus persica, P. vulgaris)- Rosaceae (Rose) Family Peaches are sweet and sour, with a cool energy. They are rich in beta- carotene, vitamin C, calcium, boron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and flavonoids. This fruit has antioxidant, digestive, diuretic, expectorant, and laxative properties. Peaches have been used to treat acidosis, anemia, asthma, athero­ sclerosis, constipation, cough, gastritis, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, indigestion, kidney stones, nephritis (kidney inflammation), obesity, and ulcers, and to rid the body of intestinal worms. They help improve skin tone, lubricate the intestines, strengthen the lungs, promote circulation, and reduce excess perspiration. Mashed peach can be applied as a facial for radiant skin. Raul Foods Encyclopedia 7)7 Look for unblemished fruits. Unripe peaches will ripen faster if placed in a paper bag and sealed for a day or two. When ripe, they will yield to the pressure of your fingers, and should be stored unwashed in the refrigerator. Enjoy them alone or in fruit salads, cold soups, ice creams, jams, pies, and cobblers. Pear (Pyrus communis)— Rosaceae (Rose) Family Pears are sweet, alkaline, mildly sour, and cool. They are a good source of beta-carotene, folic acid, vitamin C, boron, calcium, iodine, iron, phos­ phorus, and potassium, and they contain even more pectin than apples do. Most of a pear's nutrients are concentrated in the skin. A yin tonic, this fruit lubricates dryness, tonifies the intestines, and dis­ solves uric acid, helping reduce swollen joints. Pears have been used to treat acidosis, alcoholism, diabetes, high cholesterol, dizziness, gallstones, hypertension, phlegm conditions, nephritis, colitis, constipation, divertic­ ulitis, gastritis, indigestion, irritable bowel, obesity, and difficulty in urina­ tion, as well as blurred vision, lost voice, and tinnitus. Pears are usually harvested and sold unripe, but will ripen at home if left at room temperature or placed in a paper bag. Look for fruit that is firm and unblemished. Pears are ripe when they yield to the pressure of your fin­ gers, and should then be stored in the refrigerator. Enjoy them plain, juiced, or in fruit salads, pies, puddings, sorbets, and smoothies—they add a nat­ ural sweetness to any dish. Note: Pears are very sweet, so remember to brush your teeth or rinse your mouth after eating them to deter dental problems. Practitioners of Oriental medicine recommend consuming this fruit only in moderation dur­ ing pregnancy, as it is cooling and can increase the risk of miscarriage. Dried pears, unless from a health foods store, should be avoided, because they are likely to contain sulfites. Persimmon (Diospyros virginiana, D. kaki)— Ebenaceae (Ebony) Family Persimmons are sweet, astringent, and cooling. Their astringent flavor comes in part from the tannins they contain, which break down as the fruit ripens until practically none are left. Persimmons are a good source of beta- carotene, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. Persimmons help tonify the yin (moistening fluids) of the body and have a special affinity for the large intestine and the heart. They lubricate the lungs, strengthen the spleen and pancreas, improve energy, and contain"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"58 RaWsome! Pineapple is sweet, sour, cooling, and moist. It is rich in beta-carotene, B- complex vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium, manganese, potassium, carbo- hydrates, and fiber. Pineapple also contains the protein-digesting enzyme bromelain, a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that is believed to block inflammatory prostaglandins and inhibit blood platelet aggregation. Pineapple has antibacterial, antiviral, demulcent, diuretic, and mild phytoestrogenic properties. It cools the blood, helps the skin retain youth- fulness, promotes bone density, and speeds healing after an injury. It has been used to treat angina, arthritis, blood clots, bronchitis, catarrh, consti- pation, diphtheria, dyspepsia, edema, goiter, hypertension, indigestion, excessive menses, multiple sclerosis, obesity, sinusitis, sore throat, sun- stroke, and tumors, and to expel intestinal worms. Pineapple is very help- ful in cases of fever with sweating and much body heat. Topically, it can be used to to relieve swellings and speed tissue healing, and a small amount can be used instead of soap to wash the face. When selecting a pineapple, look for a fragrant aroma, light yellow or white meat, and heaviness for its size. Another sign of ripeness is when the topmost center leaf pulls out easily. This fruit is delicious simply peeled and sliced. It can also be used in salads, marinades, juices, breads, cakes, cook- ies, pies, and gelatin-free puddings. Cut a pineapple into a \"basket\" to hold other fruits. In order to be effective therapeutically, pineapple must be eaten raw, as many of its helpful constituents are destroyed by heat. Note: Underripe pineapple is too acidic for the teeth and stomach. Pineapple is not suggested for people with over-acidic digestion, eczema, or health conditions involving excessive dampness. Rau? Foods Encyclopedia :><) Pomegranate is sweet, sour, and cooling. It is a rich source of vitamin C and potassium. The seeds also contain phytoestrogenic compounds, and eating half a pomegrate daily is said to improve fertility. This fruit has alterative and antiseptic properties and is considered a yin tonic that builds the kidneys, liver, blood, and bladder. Studies in Israel have shown pomegranate to have anti-aging properties and to prevent cancer and hardening of the arteries. Pomegranate is used therapeutically to treat arthri- tis, bladder infection, diarrhea, intestinal worms (especially tapeworm), weak gums, liver congestion, and mouth sores. It helps encourage creativity. Look for pink- to red-colored fruits that are heavy for their size. Pome- granates keep very well, sometimes until spring from their autumn harvest, even if not refrigerated. Try rolling the whole fruit on a hard surface to crush the succulent seeds, then making a hole in one end to suck out their rich juice. You can also slice open the fruit and scoop out the seeds, which are great in fruit salad or a pomegranate sorbet. Best of all is to eat a pome- granate with your lover. Pumpkin (Curcurbita pepo)— Curcurbitaceae (Gourd) Family Pumpkins are sweet, slightly bitter, and neutral to cooling in nature. They are high in beta-carotene, and also contain vitamins B and C, potassium, enzymes that help break down damaged cells and foreign microbes. This fruit has been used to treat bronchitis, catarrh, cough, diarrhea, dysentery, goiter, hangover, hemorrhoids, hiccoughs, hypertension, mouth sores, pleurisy, stomachache, and ulcers. Persimmons are best when harvested after a frost. Look for plump fruits with an intact green cap. Allow persimmons to ripen at room tem- perature; ripening can be hastened by placing them in a paper bag along with some ripening bananas. Light-colored persimmons taste sweet only when mushy, but darker persimmons can be eaten before becoming overly soft. Enjoy persimmons by themselves, added to salads, or used in jams, chutneys, puddings, and pies. Plum (Prunus domestica)—Rosaceae (Rose) Family Plums are sour, sweet, and mildly cooling. They can be eaten fresh or dried; when dried, they are called prunes. Plums and prunes are rich in vitamins B] and C, calcium, iron, phosphorus, and potassium. Plums have antibacterial, antiviral, diuretic, and laxative properties. They provide energy, stimulate the liver, and are considered a tonic for the brain, nerves, and blood. They have been used to treat liver disease, bron- chitis, constipation, diabetes, flatulence, hemorrhoids, obesity, skin erup- tions, and tumors. Eating two plums daily improves digestion and helps curb bleeding gums. Look for plums that are slightly soft. Add plums or soaked prunes to fruit salad, puddings, pies, jams and sauces, or eat them by themselves as a tangy snack. Note: Plums contain some oxalic acid, which can inhibit the body's absorption of iron and calcium. People with ulcers or acute gastroenteritis should limit their intake of plums and prunes."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"60 RavJsome! sodium, and carbohydrates. Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc and are espe- cially strengthening to the adrenal glands and prostate gland. Pumpkins are considered antioxidant, diuretic, laxative, and immune tonic. They are believed to lower the risk of cancer, especially of the lungs, skin, and bladder. Being rich in beta-carotene, they improve respiratory health, including asthma and coughs. Pumpkins have been used to remedy acidosis, colitis, gastritis, indigestion, cataracts, edema, flu, and heart dis- ease. Their alkalinity enables them to dry excess dampness in the body, thus benefiting people with conditions such as edema, eczema, and dysentery. Pumpkins also support the spleen, stomach, and pancreas, thus benefiting people with hypoglycemia and diabetes. Many cultures use pumpkin seeds as a vermifuge to help eliminate tapeworm and roundworm. The heart-shaped leaves of the pumpkin vine can be used as a tea for diarrhea or as a plaster for chills and fevers. The beautiful, delicate flowers can be administered as a tea for jaundice, measles, and smallpox. Native Americans applied mashed pumpkin topically to soothe abscesses, boils, bruises, burns, carbuncles, headaches, and sprains. Filipinos used the sap of the pumpkin stem as an application for earaches. Look for pumpkins with bright orange skin that are firm to the touch and heavy for their size. Smaller, \"pie\" pumpkins are good for eating, whereas the larger varieties are better for jack o'lanterns. Open yourself to the delectable possibilities of pumpkin soup, muffins, pies, cookies, and puddings. You can also try grating pumpkin meat into salads. Radish (Raphanus Stativus )-Brassicaceae (Mustard) Family Radishes are pungent and sweet. They are neutral in temperature with the potential to be warm: they taste hot initially and then leave a feeling of coolness. Radishes are high in vitamin B b C, E, iron, potassium, and sili- con. Their high sulfur content makes them a useful part of a cancer pre- vention program. They also contain raphanin, which helps balance the thyroid gland, and the enzyme diatase, which aids in the digestion of starches (this may be why it is common in Europe to eat radishes with bread and cereals). Radishes are considered diuretic, expectorant, and stimulant. Thought to be a beautifying food, radishes are especially beneficial for the hair, nails, skin, teeth, and gums. Radishes cleanse the liver, prevent constipation, dispel phlegm, clear congested sinuses, remedy laryngitis and sore throat, and pre- vent viral infections such as flu. They are also used against gall and kidney Rati foods Encyclopedia stones. In Japanese folk medicine, a drink made of carrots and daikon radish- es is used to reduce and eliminate deposits of hardened fats in the body. Radish juice can be applied topically as an underarm deodorant or to heal bruises, insect bites, frostbite, and minor burns. Look for firm radishes of moderate size, as those that are overly large tend to be pithy. Removing the leaves (which can be added to salad) will help radishes keep longer. Add sliced or shredded radishes to salads, eat them with dips as an alternative to chips, and add them in small amounts to vegetable juices. Note: Minimize consumption of radishes in cases of excess digestive heat or inflammation, such as gastritis or ulcer. Raspberry (Rubus species )-Rosaceae (Rose) Family These delectable, warming, sweet-and-sour berries are known for their high content of vitamin C and potassium. Raspberries also contain pectin, which is useful in the \"setting up\" of jams and jellies. Flavonoids give the fruit its rich color. In Chinese medicine, raspberries are regarded as a tonic for the kidneys and liver. They are cleansing and have been shown to have antiviral proper- ties. Because they help build the blood, they are a good food for people with anemia. Raspberries are very alkaline and help improve phlegmy conditions such as catarrh. They have been used as a traditional remedy for diarrhea, frequent urination, erectile dysfunction, high blood pressure, parasites, excess menstrual bleeding, and rheumatism. The leaves of the plant are also edible and rich in minerals, and have a flavor similar to that of black tea. They are available in early summer to autumn. Avoid mushy or moldy fruits. Raspberries are lovely when eaten plain or in fruit salads, and as a garnish for green salads and desserts. Mashed and mixed with honey, they make a delicious syrup for pancakes (raw or otherwise). Rhubarb (Rheum rhabaarbarum, R. rhaponticum )—Po\\ygona.ceae (Buckwheat) Family Rhubarb is sour and cooling. It is rich in vitamin C, calcium, and potassium. Rhubarb increases the production of saliva and gastric juices, including bile, and is considered detoxifying to the liver. Being somewhat laxative, it improves peristalsis. Rhubarb is recommended for bronchitis, constipation, neuritis, obesity, and tumors. In folk medicine, brushing teeth with fresh rhubarb juice is thought to protect dental enamel from decay."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"62 RavJsomel Mushrooms are fungi: primitive plantlike organisms that derive energy not from photosynthesis but from decomposed vegetation. The name \"shiitake\" is derived from that of the shii tree (Pasania species) upon which these mush- rooms grow. Shiitake mushrooms are sweet and neutral. They are rich in niacin, vitamins B 2 , B 12 , C, and D, glutamic acid, germanium, potassium, selenium, and zinc, as well as the polysaccharide lentinan, which boosts macrophage (white blood cell) activity. They are also believed to be a source of interferon, a protein that interferes with the viral takeover of cells. Shiitakes are considered to have antitumor, antiviral, aphrodisiac, immune-tonic, and rejuvenative properties. They encourage stem cells in the bone marrow to create more B and T cells (important in boosting the body's immunity).

Their flavor can be likened to musky pineapple and their aroma to that of black cur- rants. Soursop contains almost all of the known vitamins and minerals as well as protein and carbohydrates. It is an excellent source of calcium, iron, and phosphorus. Soursop is considered aphrodisiac and diuretic. It has been used to treat hemorrhoids, obesity, heart and kidney ailments, urethritis, and, in some parts of the world, leprosy and liver ailments. Soursop fruit is harvested when its thin, leathery skin has turned a yel- lowish green but the fruit itself is still firm to the touch. It can then be ripened at home at room temperature, and yields to the gentle pressure of a finger when ripe. Soursop is delicious plain or added to fruit salads, sher- bets, preserves, and juices. Note: Soursop seeds are toxic and should not be consumed. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea)— Chenopodiaceae (Goosefoot) Family Spinach is sweet, cool, and moistening. It is rich in beta-carotene, vitamins Bg, C, and K, folic acid, calcium, iron, potassium, sulfur, and chlorophyll, and contains more protein than most vegetables. Its high lutein content makes spinach an excellent, medicinal food in cases of vision weakness and night blindness and as protection against macular degeneration. Spinach has antioxidant, digestive, diuretic, laxative, lymph-cleansing, nutritive, and tonic properties. It is considered a cancer preventative with a Rutabagas are sweet and warming They are a good source of beta-carotene and also contain some vitamin C, B-complex vitamins, calcium, potassium, fiber, and carbohydrates. Like other members of the mustard family, ruta- bagas are rich in antioxidant dithiolthiones, sulfur, and indoles, which have anticancer activity. Rutabaga stimulates the liver and is recommended in treatments for constipation, digestive disorders, and intestinal worms. Look for firm vegetables that are heavy for their size, as lightweight ones are likely to be withered inside. Rutabagas grow well in cold climates and last long into the winter if stored in a cool place (not necessarily the refrigerator). They can be pureed to make soup, mashed as a substitute for potatoes, grated raw into salads, or sliced for crudites. Nonorganic rutaba- gas are likely to be waxed, so be sure to peel them before use. Rhubarb stalks are best eaten fresh and in season. You can simply peel the stalks, dip them in a bit of salt, and enjoy them raw. Rhubarb is also wonderful in jams, pies, puddings, sauces, and homemade wines. It is very tart, so the addition of apples, honey, and raisins make a sweeter treat. Note: Rhubarb leaves are toxic and should never be consumed. Do not confuse garden rhubarb with Chinese rhubarb, which is used as a potent purgative. Consume rhubarb in moderation. Due to its high content of oxalic acid, which can inhibit the absorption of calcium and iron, rhubarb is best avoided altogether by people suffering from arthritis, gout, kidney stones, and rheumatism. cough, fatigue, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. They also help the body get rid of excess salt. Shiitake mushrooms are available fresh or dried; dried mushrooms should be soaked for two hours before use. Shiitakes are great marinated, dehydrated, or used in soups.

They are very alkaline and are rich in beta-carotene, B-complex vita- mins, calcium, and potassium. Green string beans contain more nutrients than yellow ones. String beans are considered a spleen, kidney, and yin tonic. They nour- ish the pancreas and increase the fluids of the body. String beans also help in eliminating uric acid and are thus useful in relieving the inflammation of arthritis and gout. They have traditionally been used in treatments for acne, diabetes, diarrhea, leucorrhoea, night sweats, thirst, and frequent urination. Good-quality string beans have a bright color and snap easily when bro- ken. Look for beans with immature seeds. Large, swollen seeds foretell a tough string bean, but a bean with enough fuzz on its skin that it clings to your shirt is most likely to be tender. Use string beans in salad, soups, and vegetable juices, for dipping, and to add crispness to other vegetable dishes. Summer Squash (Cucurbita species)— Curcurbitaceae (Gourd) Family A sweet, cooling food, summer squash is ideal for the hot season. Summer squash varieties include the popular zucchini (Cucurbita pepo), yellow Star fruit, also known as carambola, is named for its shape: when sliced horizontally, each piece looks like a golden star. These fruits are cooling and range in taste from sweet to sour. Star fruit is a good source of beta- carotene, vitamin C, and potassium. They help dispel excess heat from the body and are a yin tonic, detox- ifier, and diuretic. They are used to treat arthritis pain, cough, diarrhea, fever, hangover, hemorrhoids, hiccough, indigestion, kidney and bladder stones, mouth sores, and toothache. Look for even-colored, firm fruits without brown spots. Allow star fruit to ripen at room temperature; when a fruity aroma and golden yellow color are evident, the ripe fruit can be refrigerated for up to a week. Eat them by themselves, add them to salads, desserts, sherbets, jams, puddings, and chutneys, or juice them. Float slices of star fruit in punch bowls and use them as a garnish. special affinity for the lungs and large intestines. It soothes intestinal inflammation, detoxifies the digestive tract, and promotes peristalsis. Tra- ditionally, spinach is used to restore energy and treat acne, alcoholism, ane- mia, constipation, hemorrhoids, neuritis, obesity, and scurvy. Look for unwilted, dark green leaves. Spinach grows best in sandy soil, so give it several rinsings before serving to avoid getting grit in your food. Spinach makes an excellent addition to salads, soups, dips, and fillings for wraps and sandwiches. Note: Spinach contains oxalic acid, which can bind to iron and calcium and inhibit their absorption by the body. Cooking or canning converts the oxalic acid into an inorganic form that is deposited in the kidneys and can thus lead to a calcium deficiency, so eating spinach raw is considered most healthful. and rheumatism. Because it moistens the lungs, it has been helpful for dry cough, sore throat, and tuberculosis. Cut strawberries can be rubbed over the teeth to whiten them and remove dental plaque without damaging enamel. Strawberries are among the most hybridized and pesticide- and herbi- cide-contaminated produce items on the market. It is worth your time and your money to search out organic varieties. Berries that are overly large often lack flavor, and berries with whitish tips were collected too soon before proper ripening. Store strawberries in an open container in the refrigerator, removing any spoiled ones first. Leave the green caps on while rinsing, to prevent water from entering the berry and diluting the flavor. Strawberries are a heavenly snack and can also be added to jams, pies, tarts, yogurts, and smoothies, to name but a few possibilities. They are sweet enough to satisfy a dessert craving and make wonderful culinary decora- tions. The leaves of the strawberry plant are also edible; like raspberry leaves, they are rich in minerals and have a flavor similar to that of black tea.

Although they are less dense in nutrients than the harder, deeper-colored winter squash vari- eties, summer squash are a good source of beta-carotene, folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, and potassium. Summer squash is alkaline, alterative, anti-inflammatory, antispas- modic, and diuretic. It is a wonderful, medicinal food in treatments for coli- tis, constipation, hypertension, indigestion, kidney and bladder disorders, obesity, and ulcers. Summer squash is ideally harvested when it is immature, or less than 6-9 inches long. If left on the vine, it will grow as big as a baseball bat and be about as tasty. Look for young, tender squash that is heavy for its size and blemish free. Refrigerate, but do not store squash in plastic bags, as this will encourage spoilage. Scoop out the insides of summer squash and stuff with celery, chopped spinach, and nuts. Use slices for dipping or as crudites. Try summer squash chopped or grated into salads, made into pickles, or pureed into soups and sauces. Use a spiral slicer (see Chapter 4) to shred it into noodlelike threads for a low-carbohydrate \"pasta\" dish. Just about any type of summer squash can be substituted for another in recipes. The flowers of all summer squash are also edible and can be stuffed with gua- camole or other fillings. Sweet Potato (Ipomoea batatas)— Convolvulaceae (Bindweed) Family Sweet potatoes are alkalinizing, warming, and, of course, sweet. They are rich in beta-carotene, vitamins Bj, Bg, C, and E, niacin, calcium, iron, potas- sium, and carbohydrates. Sweet potatoes also contain protease inhibitors, which have been shown to inhibit the formation of cancer cells, as well as a substance called phytochelatin, which binds with heavy metals such as mer- cury, lead, cadmium, and copper and carries them out of the body. In a Japanese study of twenty-eight fruits and vegetables, sweet potato was best able to bind with cholesterol and thereby lower cholesterol levels in the body. It increases milk production in nursing mothers and is an excel- lent food for people who undergo heavy muscular activity, as it enhances strength. And because sweet potato is naturally very sweet and nutritional- ly dense, eating it can help curb the desire for refined sugar. Sweet potatoes are considered an energy, lung, stomach, spleen, and kidney yin tonic. They are easy to digest and are used for treating ulcers and inflamed colon conditions. Because of their high beta-carotene content, they can help prevent cataracts and promote healthy night vision; beta- Rarf Foods Encyclopedia (.7 carotene is also helpful in preventing heart disease, strokes, and cancer, especially cancers of the bladder, lung, breast, cervix, and ovary. Sweet potatoes have long been used in treatments for anemia, constipation, diar- rhea, dysentery, poor circulation, hemorrhoids, high blood pressure, masti- tis, and premature ejaculation. Look for firm, smooth-skinned sweet potatoes. The skin is generally thin and can be eaten; nonorganic sweet potatoes, however, are often waxed and should be peeled. The brighter and darker the color of the meat, the higher the beta-carotene content. Store sweet potatoes in a cool, dark, dry environment, where they will keep for weeks. Remove any that devel- op bruises, as a bruise can cause the entire potato to taste unpleasant. Raw sweet potatoes can be sliced into chips, grated into salads, pureed, or mashed into pies, puddings, and soups. The Raw Facts Sweet potatoes are sometimes mislabeled as yams. True yams are native to West Africa and are rarely grown or available in the United States. The orange tubers sold in North America as \"yams\" are usually sweet potatoes. Swiss Chard (Beta vulgaris cicla)— Chenopodiaceae (Goosefoot) Family Swiss chard is salty, cooling, and alkaline in nature. This wonderful green is a good source of calcium, beta-carotene, vitamin C, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and iron. It is considered a digestive aid and is beneficial for people suffering from a cold. Look for brightly colored firm leaves. Note: Swiss chard contains oxalic acid, which can inhibit the absorp- tion of calcium and iron, and so should be consumed only in moderation, especially if cooked. Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum)— Solanaceae (Nightshade) Family Tomatoes are cool in energy and sweet and sour in flavor. Although they are acidic, they have an alkalinizing effect on the blood. Tomatoes contain beta-carotene, B-complex vitamins, vitamins C and E, phosphorus, potas- sium, sulfur, quercitin, histamine, and lycopene. Lycopene, a potent antiox- idant, protects against stroke, heart disease, and cataracts, and is being studied as a preventative for cancers of the lungs, prostate, pancreas, stom- ach, and cervix."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"(•JI Raw some! Tomatoes have antiseptic, antiscorbutic (scurvy-preventing), and laxa- tive properties. They aid digestion in cases of inadequate stomach acid secretions. They are considered beneficial to the liver and help the body eliminate uric acid. Tomatoes have been used in treatments for headache, tuberculosis, high cholesterol, hypertension, and constipation. Avoid tomatoes that are bruised or mushy. Ripe ones should have a smooth, firm skin but yield slightly to the pressure of a finger. Vine-ripened tomatoes are best, because nonorganic, commercial tomatoes are some- times picked green and then ripened with ethylene gas. Grocery stores will usually advertise vine-ripened tomatoes as such. They can be kept unre- frigerated for several days. Serve sliced tomatoes at room temperature, or add them to salads, soup, sauces, or vegetable juices. Note: Some people find that tomatoes cause irritable bowel, heartburn, migraines, and/or skin irritation. Like other members of the nightshade family (eggplant, peppers, and potatoes), tomatoes contain the alkaloid solanine, and also oxalic acid, which can inhibit absorption of iron and cal- cium. People with arthritis should therefore eat tomatoes only in modera- tion, especially if they are cooked. Turnip (Brassica rapa, B. campestris)— Brassicaceae (Mustard) Family Turnips, a white version of rutabagas, can grow in poor soil and were thus historically associated with poverty, so potatoes quickly became more pop- ular than the lowly turnip upon their introduction to Europe. Turnips, however, yield both roots and greens that are edible, whereas potato greens are toxic. Also, turnips have one-third the calorie content of potatoes. Turnips are sweet, bitter, and pungent, and considered warming and alkalinizing. They are believed to reduce the risk of cancer due to their indole content, and because they speed the metabolism of estrogen. Turnips are high in vitamin C, calcium, potassium, sulfur, and carbohydrates. Turnip greens are even more nutritious than the root, being rich in beta-carotene, vitamin B 2 , vitamin B 12 (when soil is well composted), and folic acid. Turnips are a digestive aid, a lung tonic, and an energizer for the stom- ach and intestines. They help dry excess dampness in the body, clear up phlegm, neutralize toxins, move stagnation, and build the blood. Turnips have been used to treat asthma, bronchitis, high cholesterol, constipation, diabetes, hoarseness, insomnia, jaundice, nervousness, skin diseases, sinus disorders, and tuberculosis. When eaten raw, they clean the teeth and gums. Turnip greens are considered excellent for anemia, asthma, bladder dis- RaW Foods Encyclopedia 69 Watercress is pungent, bitter, sweet, and alkaline, with a warm energy. Cooking decreases this green's pungency but also decreases its nutritional value. It is rich in beta-carotene, chlorophyll, folic acid, vitamins C and E, bioflavonoids, calcium, iodine, iron, manganese, potassium, sulfur, zinc, and, sulfur. As a medicinal food, watercress is considered an alterative, antioxidant, antipyretic, antiseptic, aphrodisiac, diuretic, expectorant, hypoglycemic, laxative, metabolic-stimulant, and nutritive agent. It stimulates bile pro- duction, detoxifies the liver, and builds chi. Watercress has been used in treatments for anemia, asthma, bronchitis, cancer, canker sores, dermatitis, diabetes, eczema, edema, eye disorders, flatulence, goiter, gout, hair loss, headaches due to nerves, infection, jaundice, yellow phlegm, obesity, scurvy, urinary stones, poor teeth, and tuberculosis. Choose crisp, unwilted bright green leaves and store them in the refrig- orders, bronchitis, coughs, high blood pressure, gout, liver ailments, and tuberculosis. In folk medicine, a few turnip leaves are applied to the back of the neck to stop a nosebleed. Even turnip flowers and seeds are edible. In Oriental medicine, the flowers are considered a liver tonic and an aid to visual acuity. The seeds are diuretic and used to dispel excess, damp heat from the body, improve vision, and remedy jaundice and dysentery. Turnips must be in their prime to be flavorful. Old ones are bitter and pithy. The best roots are small to medium-sized, smooth, and firm. The root and stem will ideally be intact, and if the greens are still attached, they should not be wilted. Nonorganic turnips are often waxed. In general, turnips should be peeled before consumption. Store turnips in a paper bag in the refrigerator, where they will keep for several weeks. Turnip roots can be grated into salads or pureed in soups. Turnip greens can be substituted for kale or collard greens in most recipes. Raw turnip greens are consid- ered bitter, but this is remedied by marinating them in lemon juice, olive oil, and salt. Note: People with low thyroid function should be sure they are getting enough iodine (from kelp and dulse, for example), as eating turnips on a regular basis can inhibit thyroid activity. People who often experience con- stipation may find that turnips induce flatulence (especially when first \"going raw\"), because they help detoxify the bowels."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"70 RavJsome! exator. The leaves can be mixed with milder greens, used in salads, sand- wiches, dips, soups, and as a garnish, and added to vegetable juices. Water- cress combines well with a bit of citrus flavor. Note: Watercress can harbor parasites such as liver flukes if collected from contaminated water, so thoroughly washing and soaking watercress in a natural cleansing solution is advisable. Watermelon (Citrullus lannatus, C. vulgaris)— Curcurbitaceae (Gourd) Family Watermelon is cold, sweet, and alkalinizing. It has only half as much sugar as an apple does, yet tastes sweeter, because it is mostly (92 percent) water. Watermelon is a good source of beta-carotene, vitamin C, potassium, and silicon. It also contains the pigment lycopene, which is being investigated as a cancer preventative, and glutathione, which guards against cataract for- mation. The inner, pale green rind of watermelon contains chlorophyll and can be eaten along with the pink meat. The fruit's black seeds contain cur- curbocitrin, which dilates the capillaries, and are a traditional remedy for strengthening the kidneys. Watermelon has antibacterial, antioxidant, anticoagulant, diuretic, and laxative properties. It lubricates the intestines, has an affinity for the bladder, kidney, stomach, and heart, and is considered a rejuvenating tonic for the blood. Watermelon can help lift the spirits from depression and has been used in treatments for halitosis, hangover, mouth sores, sore throat, and urethral pain. It is a digestive aid and makes an ideal food during a cleanse. When on the vine, the melon develops a white spot where it touches the ground; when this white spot turns yellow or cream colored, it indicates ripeness. A ripe melon will also be heavy for its size, have a sweet fra- grance, have skin that can be scraped off easily with a fingernail, and make a dull, hollow sound when thumped. Avoid melons with a green or white belly. Watermelon is best enjoyed on its own, but you can add it to other melons in a fruit salad, juice it, or freeze the puree for a cool watermelon sorbet. For a truly invigorating watermelon tonic that will help build the blood and strengthen the glands, try juicing the seeds, rind, and pink meat all together. Winter Squash (Curcurbita maxima)— Curcurbitaceae (Gourd) Family Winter squash are warm, alkaline, and sweet. The varieties of winter RauJ Foods Encyclopedia 71 squash include acorn, banana, buttercup, delicata, Hubbard, spaghetti, and turban. They are very nourishing, being rich in beta-carotene, vitamin C, folic acid, magnesium, potassium, sodium, carbohydrates, and fiber. In gen- eral, darker winter squash are more nutritious than paler ones. The flowers and large seeds of all winter squash varieties are also edible. The seeds are high in protein, beta-carotene, and B-complex vitamins. Winter squash have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, energy-tonic, and immune-tonic properties. They clear toxins from the body and nourish the stomach and spleen. Their high antioxidant content helps prevent stroke, heart disease, and cancers of the bladder, lung, skin, and stomach. Winter squash have been used to improve vision, reduce cataracts, treat bladder infections, lower cholesterol, improve dry skin, and promote weight gain. Their seeds are used to protect the prostate gland and eliminate worms from the body. Winter squash are generally harvested in the fall and have hard shells. Look for firm, smooth squash that are heavy for their size. Those with the stem still attached will keep longer. They generally do not need to be stored in the refrigerator—a cool, dry location will suffice. They must be peeled before they can be eaten, which is easiest if they are first cut into segments. Use the meat of winter squash like you would use pumpkin: cubed or pureed, or in soups, puddings, and pies. •••GRAINS A grain is the fusion of seed and fruit that is the reproductive mechanism of cereal grasses and a few other types of plants. Although grains are a major element of the typical Western diet, they have only limited use in the raw foods diet. What's more, grains such as rice, oats, wheat, and barley have a tough, outer husk that needs to be removed before they can be eaten, mak- ing them labor-intensive to produce. Grains are heavy in starches, which are difficult to digest, taking from thirty-six to seventy-two hours. Overeating grains can cause you to feel groggy and \"hungover\" the next day. The sharp fiber in grains, often referred to as nonsoluble fiber, can irritate the intestinal mucosa, con- tributing to irritable bowel, spastic colon, diverticulosis, Crohn's disease, and a host of other maladies. Grains also tend to be low in calcium, and contain acid-forming compounds of chlorine, iodine, sodium, and sulfur, which can contribute to cancer, obesity, urinary (kidney and bladder) stones, and hemorrhoids."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"72 Raw some! Grains also contain antinutrients such as phytates, which must be cooked, sprouted, soaked, or fermented in order to be neutralized or inac- tivated. Although cooking grains inactivates much of their phytate content, cooked starches are difficult to digest. Sprouting, however, inactivates phy- tates in grains while converting their starch to an easier-to-digest fructose and their proteins to amino acids. In addition, gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, oats, and barley, is a common allergen. Fortunately, people who are allergic to a particular grain are rarely allergic to that grain in its sprout- ed form. With these above concerns in mind, I recommend that a raw diet include only a minimal amount of grains if at all, and that they always be sprouted. I also encourage you to seek varieties that are as close to their \"heirloom\" or \"native\" state as possible, with minimal hybridizing. Grains tend to be sweet and acid forming (except millet, which is alkalinizing). The following grains can be useful and beneficial in the raw foods diet. Amaranth (Amaranthus species )-Amaranthaceae (Cockscomb) Family Amaranth was an important food crop for the Aztecs and Incas. It contains higher levels of calcium, phosphorus, and amino acids, including lysine, than most other grains, and is gluten free. The tiny grains are considered astringent, diuretic, and hemostatic. Amaranth is generally used in small amounts, mixed with other grains. Barley (Hordeum vulgare )-Poaceae (Grass) Family Barley, which originated in western Asia, is believed to be one of the first grains to be cultivated. It thrives in areas where most other grains refuse to flourish, such as arid or saline soils and even in the arctic climate. It is lower in gluten than wheat is, and is therefore less likely to be allergenic. Barley is esteemed for its high content of protein, carbohydrates, B-complex vita- mins, calcium, germanium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur. It also contains hordenine, a substance that helps relieve the bronchial spasms associated with asthma. Barley is considered one of the easiest grains to digest. It can help soothe ulcers and colon or bladder irritations, prevent gallstones, and lubri- cate dry lungs. It stimulates the liver and lymphatic system, aiding the body in discharging toxins. Barley is good for people who live in cold climates, are frail, or have low self-esteem, because it imparts warmth and vitality to the body. RaW Foods Encyclopedia 73 Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum)— Polygon ace ae (Buckwheat) Family Although buckwheat is used as a grain, it is technically a fruit or an achene (seed). It originated in Siberia and Manchuria and, being a warming food, is favored by peoples living in cold, damp climates. Buckwheat has up to twice the amount of calcium found in other grains. It is rich in vitamins B and E and the amino acid lysine. It also con- tains rutin, which strengthens the capillaries and is an excellent tonic for the cardiovascular system. Rutin helps people with varicosities and peo- ple who bruise easily. Buckwheat has a tradition of use by people wishing to strengthen their kidneys, relieve constipation, and reduce high blood pressure. To be edible, hulled buckwheat should be soaked overnight (or for at least four hours) and then rinsed. If you buy unhulled buckwheat, sprout it in a shallow tray of dirt, and within a few days you can harvest the delight- ful \"buckwheat lettuce.\" Corn (Zea mays)— Poaceae (Grass) Family Corn was cultivated in the Americas long before European settlers arrived. It was originally hybridized from a native wild grass, and is North Ameri- ca's only native grain. Today, corn is highly hybridized, and it is the only grain that can't reproduce without human help, as it needs to be shucked and then planted. Corn is sweet and neutral. It is rich in beta-carotene, vita- mins B, C, and E, folic acid, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc. It is an excellent source of fiber and essential fatty acids. Corn is appropriately eaten in summer, as it is more cooling than other grains. It has antiviral, diuretic, and mildly stimulating properties. It helps remedy conditions involving phlegm and dampness in the body. Corn is a tonic food that is easy to digest, relieves constipation, and benefits the stomach, heart, and large intestines. It increases estrogen levels and stabi- lizes blood sugar levels. It helps build the bones, blood, and muscles and is also considered a sexual tonic. Corn tastes best if left in the husk until right before use. Look for fresh, green husks and plump, milky kernels in nongenetically modified (non- GM) varieties. Yellow corn is more nutritious than white corn. Kamut (Triticum durum)— Poaceae (Grass) Family Kamut, believed to have originated in Egypt, is an ancient, nonhybridized ancestor of wheat. The genus name triticum is Latin for \"grain\" and the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"71 RavJsome! species name durum means \"hard.\" It can be used in much the same way as wheat, whether sprouted, grown as grass, or fermented into Rejuvelac (see page 152). The International Food Allergy Association deems kamut to be an acceptable alternative for most people who are sensitive to wheat. Try growing kamut grass for juicing, or sprouting the grain to make raw breads. Millet (Panicum miliaceum )—Poaceae (Grass) Family Millet is an important staple in its native northern Africa and Asia. Its com- mon name is derived from the Latin mille, meaning \"thousand,\" in refer- ence to the multitudes of tiny seeds produced on a stalk. Millet is high in protein, iron, and silicon. It is easily digested and is very alkaline, unlike most other grains, which are more acid producing. Millet is considered beneficial for the stomach and spleen. It helps balance blood sugar levels and helps overcome Candida infection. Oat (Avena sativa )-Poaceae (Grass) Family Oats are sweet, warm, and moist. They are rich in protein, B-complex vita- mins, and calcium. Oats are considered antidepressant, antispasmodic, brain tonic, nutri- tive, and rejuvenative. They benefit people who are weak and have diffi- culty gaining weight. Oats have been used to treat attention deficit disorder, broken bones, depression, drug addiction, exhaustion, multiple sclerosis, nervous breakdown, osteoporosis, paralysis, and posttraumatic stress, among other maladies. Note: Eating too many oats gives the skin a pasty complexion. Be sure to buy oats from a supplier of raw foods (see the Resources section), because most commercially available oats have been cooked. As a rule, if your oats won't sprout, don't eat them! RavJ Foods Encyclopedia 7.\") Rice (Oryza sativa)— Poaceae (Grass) Family Rice grows in water and requires lots of oxygen. Because rice sucks air in through its pores, the Chinese associate it with the lungs. Rice contains less protein than most other grains, though it is rich in lysine. It is reputed to calm the nerves and lift the spirits. Most rice varieties available in grocery stores are heavily hybridized. Freshly harvested brown rice, which can be sprouted, is available from raw foods suppliers. Rye (Secale cereale)— Poaceae (Grass) Family Rye was developed from a wild grass of northeastern European origin. It has a nutritional portfolio similar to that of wheat and can be used in sim- ilar ways, but rye has less gluten. It contains B-complex vitamins, vitamin E, iron, and lysine. Rye is traditionally consumed to strengthen fingernails, hair, bones, teeth, and muscles, and to promote endurance and stamina. Spelt (Triticum aestivum)— Poaceae (Grass) Family Spelt is believed to be the oldest cultivated variety of wheat. It is not hybridized and is easy to digest. Spelt can be used in place of wheat and, although it con- tains some gluten, is usually tolerated by those with gluten sensitivities. Teff ( Eragrostis tef)— Poaceae (Grass) Family Native to the region of the Nile, teff was a wild grass that eventually became cultivated. It is rich in iron, calcium, copper, and zinc. Teff also con- tains intrinsic (naturally occurring) yeast, which aids in the digestion of this grain. Teff has a low potential for being allergenic. Wheat (Triticum species)— Poaceae (Grass) Family Like barley, wheat was among the first grains to be cultivated. Throughout the world, wheat has now replaced many traditional grains such as barley, teff, and millet; for some Americans, wheat composes up to one-third of the diet. It is the most acidic of grains, and, of course, one of the most common sources of the allergen gluten. Whole wheat is high in B-complex vitamins, vitamin E, iron, magnesium, and zinc. Wheat tends to build fat and cause weight gain. It also stimulates the liver; however, the ingestion of wheat causes a cleansing reaction that results in skin breakout, lethargy, and excess phlegm. This is one reason why overconsumption of wheat can become such a health detriment. Quinoa, a close relative of spinach and beets, is native to the Andes and was a staple food of the Incans. It contains high levels of protein, the amino acid lysine, and calcium. Easy to digest, quinoa is is considered an energy food. It is also a galactagogue, increasing the milk production of nursing mothers. I like to use sprouted quinoa in place of my former, cooked staples, like bulgur wheat."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"RaWsomel Wild Rice (Zizania aquatica )—Poacea.e (grass) Family Wild rice is technically not a grain but the seed of an aquatic grass. Wild rice is almost always parched after harvesting and so is not usually available as a bona fide raw food. •••NUTS AND SEEDS Nuts and seeds contain the genetic potential for starting a new life, and are endowed with sufficient nutrition to sustain their offspring. This, in turn, makes nuts and seeds a powerhouse of nutrition for us, providing beneficial fats, vitamins, minerals, proteins, and carbohydrates. Nuts have a higher fat content than seeds do, whereas seeds tend to be higher in iron. Both contain beta-carotene, B-complex vitamins, vitamins D and E, and calcium, and are excellent sources of vegetarian protein; in fact, by volume, nuts and seeds provide more protein than meat or milk. They contain phytosterols, or plant hormones, that have a structure similar to that of human hormones and support the endocrine system and all its func- tions, including reproductive health. Raw nuts and seeds also contain lipase, an enzyme that helps the body digest fats. Nuts and seeds can help regulate blood sugar levels, and also help clean and strengthen teeth and gums. They relieve constipation, have a \"ground- ing\" effect, calm nervousness, and strengthen weakness. Nuts and seeds are excellent for bodybuilders, for those who work with their muscles, and for increasing sexual desire in both men and women. The Raw Facts \"Nut\" is a term used loosely for any dry, hard-shelled fruit. Technically, however, all nuts are actually seeds. Many people avoid nuts and seeds because of their high fat content. However, when consumed in moderation, nuts and seeds (and the lipase they contain) can actually help control fat and cholesterol levels in the body. They are themselves cholesterol free and can help lower levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein, the undesirable type of cholesterol). For example, eating 3 ounces of almonds daily, along with a low-fat diet, can lower levels of LDL within three weeks. Most nuts and seeds are warm and damp in energy, so eating too much of them can build up warmth and dampness in the body, contributing to Rati Foods Encyclopedia 77 pimples, digestive disorders, and gas. People with health conditions involv- ing excess dampness (as evidenced by acne, Candida infection, tumors, cysts, obesity, or phlegm) should therefore minimize their consumption of nuts and seeds, with the exception of pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower seeds, which are warm and dry. With the exception of almonds, nuts are acidifying. They should be eaten only in small amounts, preferably with alkalinizing, leafy green veg- etables. They can be a bit hard to digest, so people with sensitive digestion will find that nuts are best eaten alone or combined with green or non- starchy vegetables. New raw foodists tend to over-eat nuts and seeds, but they are a heavy, fatty food, so some raw foodists eat them only occasion- ally. If you do make them a regular part of your diet, eat no more than 6 ounces of nuts and seeds a day, and every couple of months, take a week or so off from eating them. Nuts and seeds are best when bought in the shell and cracked as need- ed. The shells prevent free radical damage from light and air, and nuts and seeds in the shell will keep for about a year. The next best option is to buy them shelled and whole; if stored in glass jars in the refrigerator, they will keep for several months. Slivered, cracked, blanched, or broken nut pieces are likely to be rancid (rancidity is caused by the oxidation of oils). Nuts that are rubbery, moldy, rancid, or acrid should be composted. Rancid nut or seed products irritate the lining of the stomach and intestines, cannot be assimilated, weaken the immune system, can damage the health of the liver and gallbladder, and have had their vitamins A, D, and E destroyed. Almonds are less prone to rancidity. Brazil nuts, macadamias, pecans, sun- flower seeds, and walnuts tend to turn rancid more quickly than other nuts and seeds. Oils pressed from nuts and seeds are not typically included in a raw foods diet. Once pressed, these oils are subjected to chemical solvents or heat in order to preserve them, and as a result they are often denatured or contain traces of the solvents. Exceptions in this category are cold-pressed coconut oil and, in some cases, flaxseed oil and hemp seed oil, which are not treated with heat or solvents. (Olive oil, which is also beneficial in a raw foods diet, is technically not a seed oil but a fruit oil; see page 103.) These oils should always be stored in the refrigerator, where they'll keep for sev- eral months. Most nut butters (including tahini) are subjected to high enough temperatures to destroy the enzymes (even those labeled \"raw\"). A brand we use is from Rejuvenative Foods (see the Resources section). Look"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"78 Raw some! for nut butters made by manufacturers who avoid subjecting the nuts to heat in the grinding process. By endowing nuts and seeds with enzyme inhibitors, nature curbs their ability to sprout until conditions are favorable, thereby preventing them from germinating at the wrong time (such as during the winter, or in the grocery store's bulk bins). Soaking nuts and seeds activates protease, a compound that neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors and thus initiates the sprouting process. Even if you don't allow the nuts and seeds to carry the germination process all the way through to sprouting, soaking activates the life force that they contain and improves their digestibility. Nuts and seeds can be soaked in or out of the refrigerator, but in hot cli- mates it's a good idea to refrigerate those that require long soaking times. Use twice as much water as the volume of nuts or seeds you are soaking. It's best to soak nuts and seeds for eight to twelve hours. If you soak them for longer than twelve hours, rinse them after the first twelve hours and replace the soaking water with fresh water. If you are in a hurry, even soaking them for twenty minutes can improve their digestibility. After soaking nuts or seeds, rinse and drain them. If you're not going to use them immediate- ly, store them in the refrigerator. When blended, soaked nuts or seeds have a creamy texture; blended, unsoaked nuts are oilier and grainier. The following nuts and seeds can be healthful components of a raw foods diet. Use them for garnishing recipes, as snacks, in trail mixes, or to give crunch to cookies. One nut can be substituted for any other in most recipes. Almond (Prunus amygdalsu, P. dulcis) Almonds are members of the Rosaceae (rose family) along with peaches, apples, and other relatives. Sweet and neutral in temperature, almonds con- tain about 18 percent protein and are a good source of vitamin E, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. They also contain amygdalin, oth- erwise known as laetrile (vitamin B]7), which is a proposed anticancer nutrient. Because almond skins contain lots of tannins (acidic pigments), some people advise not eating the skins. Almonds have anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, demulcent, emollient, and tonic properties. They are known as a brain and bone food. They help alkalinize the blood and relieve chi stagnation (energy blockages) in the liver. Almonds are used to lubricate the lungs, relieve asthma and coughing, dispel phlegm, strengthen the nervous system, improve energy, and increase RaW Foods Encyclopedia strength and sexual vitality. In Ayurvedic medicine, they are used to strengthen ojas, the essence that exemplifies intellect and spiritual receptiv- ity. Yogananda, an Indian yogi and author of Autobiography of a Yogi, said almonds foster \"self control and calmness of the mind and nerves.\" Brazil Nut (Bertholletia excelia) Brazil nuts are members of the Lecythidaceae (Brazil nut family). They are harvested in the wilds of the Amazon River Valley, where they fall from their trees in pear-shaped fruits that weigh from 2 to 4 pounds. (Watch your head if you're walking through the jungle!) Brazil nuts are sweet and warm- ing and highly acidic. They are a good source of the amino acids cysteine and methionine, making them beneficial in a vegetarian diet. They are a good source of selenium as well, and rich enough in calcium to be benefi- cial for teeth and bones. They are also 67 percent fat—finding once that we had no birthday candles for a cake, we stuck fresh raw Brazil nuts in the cake and lit them, and they burned like candles! In order to remove their shells, unshelled Brazil nuts are boiled for five minutes. This might render them not raw, but most people feel that the thick, hard shell protects the nut inside from becoming too hot. Cashew (Anacardium occidentale) Cashews are members of the Anacardiaceae (cashew family) and related to mangoes, pistachios, and poison ivy. Their name is derived from the Brazil- ian Tupi-Indian word acaju, meaning \"nut.\" The cashew nut grows attached to the bottom of a cashew apple, which is eaten fresh and made into jams. Because the fruit spoils quickly, it is rarely seen outside of its native regions. Sweet and warming, cashew nuts are composed of about 20 percent protein. Between the inner and outer shell of the cashew nut is a toxic oil called cardol, which can irritate the skin. To release the cardol, the uncracked cashews are roasted at 350°F, and then the cracked nuts are roasted again to remove the inner shell. Very few cashews, even those labeled \"raw,\" are pack- aged for sale without having undergone this roasting process. Try purchasing truly raw cashews from raw foods suppliers (see the Resources section). Chia Seed (Salvia columbariae, S. hispanica) Chia is a member of the Lamiaceae (mint family). Salvia, the genus name, is derived from the Latin salvere, meaning \"to save.\" The common name"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"80 RaWsome! comes from the Mayan cbiabaan, meaning \"strengthening.\" Sweet, bitter, and neutral, chia seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. They are considered an energy tonic that moistens yin (fluids). Chia seeds have long been used by the native peoples of the American Southwest for endurance, and in Latin America, the seeds are used to treat constipation. Coconut (Cocus nucifera) Coconut, the largest known seed, is the fruit of the coconut palm, in the Pal- maceae (palm family). Its name comes from the Spanish/Portuguese word coco, meaning \"monkey face.\" In Sanskrit, the coconut palm is called kalpa vriksha: \"the tree that supplies all that is needed to live.\" An ancient South Pacific saying is, \"He who plants a coconut tree plants vessels and clothing, food and drink, a habitation for himself, and a heritage for his children.\" Sweet and warming, coconuts are 70 percent fat, most of which is sat- urated (see Coconut Oil, page 104). They are also high in iodine, which is important for normal thyroid function, and are a good source of protein, beta-carotene, B-complex vitamins, and minerals. Coconut is considered an energy tonic, and is excellent fare for vegetarians. Coconut milk (made by pureeing the meat and blending it with the water) compares favorably with mother's milk, as they both contain lauric acid, protein, fat, and minerals. Although infants are always better off with mother's milk, coconut milk can be used as a replacement for mother's milk for older children. Coconut milk can also be used to relieve sore throat and to treat stomach ulcers. A coconut under six months of age has a gelatinous meat that is soft enough to be eaten with a spoon. Considered a delicacy, this \"spoon coconut\" is also used to feed babies and nourish the sick. Spoon coconut restores damaged body tissues, boosts male sexual fluids, and can be used to rid the body of tapeworm. Young, green coconuts can contain up to a pint of rejuvenating coconut water, a supreme source of electrolytes and an excellent rehydration bever- age. Coconut water cools the body, benefits the elderly and infirm, and helps treat kidney stones and intestinal worms. It can also be fed to infants suffering intestinal distress. This liquid is surprisingly similar in composi- tion to human blood plasma, and was used in intravenous solutions by Japanese doctors during World War II. Coconut water can be applied top- ically to treat rashes, such as those caused by chicken pox and measles, and it has even been used as eyedrops to treat cataracts. Rati Foods Encyclopedia ill When shopping for coconuts, look for those that are light in color, indicating their freshness and immaturity. We have recently found out that many of the white coconuts available in this country are dipped in a bleach solution. It is unlikely that any chemicals would seep into the inner portions of the nut. Brown-shelled coconuts are more mature and contain tougher meat. A coconut should have a full, liquid sound when shaken. Avoid any with moldy spots or with moisture that has seeped under the plastic cover- ing. In addition to a \"mouth,\" a coconut has two \"eyes,\" which are soft enough to puncture with a screwdriver so you can pour out the coconut water. Then, tap around the head of the shell with a hammer until it cracks and the coconut meat can be pried out. It's best to eat fresh rather than dried coconut, because the dried, shred- ded coconut available in grocery stores is often sweetened, pasteurized, or preserved with propylene glycol. We like to remove fresh, young coconut meat from the shell carefully with a spoon and then slice it thinly into \"noodles\"; they are excellent in Asian dishes and can also be chopped fine for adding to raw puddings and ice creams. Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum, L lewisii) Flax is a member of the Linaceae (flax family). The genus name is derived from the Greek linon, meaning \"cord,\" and the species name usitatissi- mum means \"most useful.\" Flaxseed, sometimes known as linseed, is sweet, warm, and moist. Rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, protein, and vitamins A and B, it contains more vitamin E by volume than any other known seed. Flaxseed is 60 percent linolenic acid, which helps maintain cell wall integrity and inhibits the production of tumor-producing acids. It is also high in phytoestrogenic lignans (plant hormones that can mimic some of the actions of human hormones like estrogen), which can help relieve some of the concerns of menopause, including hot flashes. Flaxseed's healing properties are tremendous. It is considered anal- gesic, anti-inflammatory, antitussive, decongestant, demulcent, emollient, expectorant, and mucilaginous. It helps clean the arteries, soothes irrita- tion in the intestinal tract, and benefits the cardiovascular system. Flaxseed is often recommended as a daily supplement to support bowel and skin health. It is a potent laxative: just eat 1-2 tablespoons of the seeds, which can be easily chewed as is, or grind or soak them before- hand—and be sure to consume plenty of fluids to aid their laxative action."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"82 RavJsome! Flaxseed has been used to treat arthritis, asthma, breast cysts, bronchitis, constipation, cystitis, eczema, hemorrhoids, and sore throat. Topically, flaxseeds can be used as a poultice for boils, burns, inflammations, pleurisy, psoriasis, and shingles. Nutritionally speaking, golden flaxseeds are considered the best. Note: Flaxseed contains a small amount of prussic acid, which in very large amounts can be toxic; however, you'd have to eat enormous quanti- ties of the seeds to be at risk from prussic acid toxicity. Do avoid eating immature, unripe flaxseeds, which may be toxic. Also, flaxseed oil turns rancid rapidly, faster than other seed and vegetable oils, especially when exposed to light, heat, or oxygen. The Raw Facts In the eighth century, the French king Charlemagne passed a law requiring his people to consume flaxseed so that they would be healthier subjects. Centuries later, Mahatma Gandhi said, \"Whenever flaxseeds become a regular food among the people, there will be better health.\" Hazelnut/Filbert (Corylus avellana, C. maxima) Hazelnuts are members of the Corylaceae (hazel family). The genus name corylus is derived from the Greek korys, meaning \"helmet,\" in reference to the nut's helmet-shaped husk. The wild nut is known as a hazelnut, where- as the cultivated nut is called a filbert. Both are rich in calcium and miner- als, are acid forming, and strengthen teeth and gums. Hazelnuts are sweet and warming. Hemp Seed (Cannabis sativa) The seeds of this member of the Cannabaceae (hemp family) contain more protein than any other plant food except for soy, yet hemp seed is easier to digest than soy and is less likely to cause allergic reactions. Hempseeds are sweet and warming. Like flaxseed, hemp seed is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, but it has a longer shelf life. Unlike many seeds, hemp seeds are free of trypsin inhibitors (enzymes) and do not need to be soaked before use. Hemp—both the seed and the plant—has many wonderful uses and is eco- nomically and environmentally a great agricultural product. For more infor- mation, consult one of the many books that have been written about hemp. Ran? Foods Encyclopedia Macadamia Nut (Macadamia tertrphylla, M. integrifolia) Macadamia nuts, also known as Queensland nuts, are members of the Proteaceae (protea family). The nuts are sweet and warming. Macadamia nuts are high in fat (70 percent) and low in protein (8 percent), but they also contain carbohydrates, calcium, iron, phosphorus, selenium, and zinc. They are said to rejuvenate the liver, discourage alcohol cravings, improve anemia, and aid in convalescence. Macadamias are also a phlegm-forming food. The Raw Facts Peanuts are not actually nuts but legumes. They are often contaminated, especially when raw, with a mold called aflatoxin that is considered a carcinogen. They are hard to digest, so excess consumption of peanuts can promote lethargy. Additionally, they can aggravate skin breakouts. Peanuts are often produced through crop rotation with cotton, which means they are grown in cotton's pesticide-laden fields. For all of these reasons, peanuts are not considered an optimal raw food. Pecan (Carya illinoensis) Pecans, in the Juglandaceae (walnut family), are a close relative of walnuts. Pecans are sweet and warming. Pecans are about 71 percent fat. They are also a rich source of protein, minerals, and B-complex vitamins, especially B 6 (pyridoxine). Pecans are considered especially nourishing for the nervous system and helpful in repairing damaged cells in cases of heart disease. The nuts are generally steamed to remove the shells, but the steaming is brief enough that most raw foods enthusiasts do not consider it detrimental. Pine Nut (Pinus species) Pine nuts, also called pinons or pignoli, come from those pine trees (mem- bers of the Pinaceae, or pine family) that have large, palatable seeds. Sweet and warming, pine nuts are 14 percent protein and known for lubricating the lungs and large intestines. They are delicious in pesto. Pistachio (Pistacia vera) Pistachio nuts are members of the Anacardiaceae (cashew family). They are neutral in energy, sweet, bitter, and slightly sour. Pistachios are similar in"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"84 RaWsomel nutritional value to almonds, but higher in iron and vitamin B|. They are also 55 percent fat and 20 percent protein. The green color of the nut is due to its chlorophyll content. Pistachios lubricate the intestines and tonify the kidneys and liver. Poppy Seed (Papaver rhoeas) The poppy is a member of the Papaveraceae (poppy family). The seeds are incredibly tiny; you'd need more than ten million of them to make 1 pound. Poppy seeds are sour and have a cool energy. Poppy seeds contain protein, calcium, and zinc. These seeds are considered analgesic, anodyne, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, expectorant, and mildly narcotic and sedative. They have been used to treat anx- iety, asthma, bronchitis, coughs, insomnia, pneumonia, pleurisy, and tonsillitis. Poppy seeds are good sprinkled on vegetable dishes or blended into poppy seed butter in a food processor. They also make good bird food. They do not need to be soaked before using in raw recipes. Pumpkin Seed (Curcurbita maxima, C. pepo) Pumpkins are members of the Curcurbitaceae (gourd family). Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitos, are 29 percent protein and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, B-complex vitamins, and calcium. They are also rich in zinc and have anti-inflammatory properties, which makes them useful in the treat- ment and prevention of prostate gland enlargement. The seeds are sweet, slightly bitter, and have a neutral energy. Pumpkin seeds help reduce the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, which can contribute to bladder and kidney stones, and help relieve nausea and erectile dysfunction. They can be beneficial in expelling worms (tape- worm, pin worm, and roundworm). Sesame Seed (Sesamum indicum) Sesame is a member of the Pedaliaceae (sesame family). Sesame seeds are sweet and neutral in temperature. They are about 50 percent oil and 25 to 35 percent protein. They also contain vitamin E, calcium, iron, and sesamin, a lignin that is a powerful antioxidant and can inhibit cholesterol production. Sesame seeds are available either hulled or unhulled. With the loss of their hull, seasame seeds also lose much of their fiber, calcium, potas- sium, vitamin B b and iron. The seeds are considered demulcent, emollient, laxative, and a general Rati Foods Encyclopedia tonic. They tonify the yin, relieve chronic wasting diseases, and strengthen the kidneys, liver, bones, hair, nails, and teeth. Black sesame seeds are espe- cially good kidney tonics and are considered strengthening to the reproduc- tive system. They are also used in Oriental medicine to prevent hair from graying. If you're buying them, make sure they're authentic black sesame seeds, and not regular sesame seeds that have simply been dyed black. Grinding the seeds right before use makes them more digestible. Hulled sesame seeds are used to make tahini; unhulled seeds make sesame butter. Toasted sesame seed oil is indeed cooked, but if you're not a stickler for the rules, a tablespoon of it added to a large bowl of otherwise-raw food will make you reminisce about your favorite Asian dishes from the old days. Note: Unhulled sesame seeds are high in oxalic acid, which can inhibit the body's absorption of iron and calcium, and should be consumed only in moderation. Hulled sesame seeds may be chemically treated, so it's best to soak them overnight and rinse them in the morning to remove any chemi- cal residue. Sunflower Seed (Helianthus annuus) Sunflowers are members of the Asteraceae (daisy family). Sunflower seeds, like pumpkin seeds, are rich in zinc, which many regard as a remedy to pro- tect the prostate. They are also rich in B-complex vitamins and linoleic acid. As a medicinal food, sunflower seeds are antioxidant, diuretic, expec- torant, and nutritive. Their high B-complex vitamin content makes them excellent for strengthening a debilitated nervous system and for building kidney strength. Their high linoleic acid content makes them useful in low- ering cholesterol and preventing heart disease. Sunflower seeds are consid- ered a tonic for the eyes because they decrease light sensitivity and prevent eye degeneration. They lubricate the intestines, benefit dry constipation, build energy, and increase sexual vigor in both men and women. When you're trying to quit smoking, try eating sunflower seeds in the shell instead of lighting up; it is satisfying oral-manual work to crack open the shell and peel it off before enjoying the tender seed. Walnut {juglans nigra, J. regia) Walnuts are members of the Juglandaceae (walnut family). The genus name juglans is derived from the Latin Jovis glans, or \"nut of Jupiter,\" a reflec- tion of the belief that gods dined on walnuts. The Chinese refer to walnuts as \"longevity fruit\" because a walnut tree lives for several hundred years."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"RavJsome! Walnuts are sweet, bitter, and warming. They are about 60 percent fat and 20 percent protein; they also contain vitamin E, calcium, potassium, and zinc. They strengthen the lungs and kidneys and lubricate the large intestines. Because of the walnut's resemblance to the brain, in many cultures these nuts are considered a good brain tonic and used for treating head injuries. WILD THINGS Thirty-some years ago I lived on a farm in Reynolds, Missouri. Every Thursday, I would go help Mrs. Glore, a neighboring hill woman old enough to have outlived three husbands, and I'd work in her very large and wonderful garden in exchange for firewood. Mrs. Glore was an important teacher in my life. She taught me that most of the weeds we pulled were use- ful and edible plants. Rather than composting them, we would incorporate them into the evening's dinner and thus double or triple the yield of her gar- den. Mrs. Glore would declare \"Why, you'ze can eat this. It's lamb's-quarter. It's wild spinach and its good fer ya! Even better than the store-bought kind!\" Thus began my lessons in learning to love the weeds . . . lessons I would use in my own garden. Wild plants are hardy, surviving without fertilizer or weekly waterings from the garden hose. Some, like dandelions, persist despite our best attempts to get rid of them. Their ability to overcome all sorts of adversity imparts to us a source of strength and vitality. Nourished by rain, sunlight, moonlight, and wind, they can furnish more nutrition than their cultivated progeny. Learn to enjoy the freshness of a salad that was collected five min- utes before being eaten! Use wild edibles in place of spinach, kale or collard greens in most recipes. Add wild greens to vegetable juices. Learn to love the weeds that heal and feed our needs! Gathering Guidelines • Make sure you are collecting the proper species, because many plants have poisonous lookalikes. Bring along a good guide, or at least a good guidebook. • Be sure you are collecting the correct plant part. For example, blue elder- berries are wonderful, but the leaves of the plant are toxic. Red elder is also toxic. • Do not harvest any known endangered species. Rati foods Encyclopedia l!7 • Ask permission before gathering on private land. • If possible, water plants the day before collecting. • When harvesting from a group of plants, identify the grandfather/grand- mother plant and leave it there to ensure the continuation of the strongest of the species. • Never take more than 10 percent of a wild population of plants. Leave some for the wild animals. • Vary the places from which you collect. • Avoid collecting plants within 50 feet of a busy road, in areas that are polluted, or in areas that have been treated with pesticides or herbicides. • Gather leaves and flowers in the morning, after the dew has evaporated and before the sun is too hot. • Gather leaves not when the plant is already in full flowering but in the early stages of flowering, when its energy will still be in its leaves. • It is kinder to take a whole leaf rather than to tear off part of a leaf. • Replant seeds as often as possible. • Collect plants in a way to ensure the continued survival of the species. For example, if all you need are the leaves and flowers, take only the tops. Cutting a plant back can actually help promote new growth. Leave the roots to continue their growing cycle. By gathering selectively, you can thin plants that are growing too close together, and give the other plants more room. • Compost the plant parts you do not eat, or use them as mulch or in herbal preparations. • Sing while collecting! Be joyful and thankful! Amaranth (Amaranthus species) Parts used: Leaf and seed Amaranth, also known as pigweed or redroot, is so persistent that the Greeks considered it a symbol of immortality. Amaranth is bitter, sweet, and cooling in nature. The greens are high in calcium and magnesium. Amaranth leaves are considered astringent and diuretic. Amaranth leaf tea has been utilized to treat diarrhea, dysentery, and excessive menstrual bleeding."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"88 RaWsomel Amaranth leaves can be collected before flowering and eaten raw like spinach. The seeds can be collected in late summer or autumn, spread out on a paper bag, and allowed to dry for several days. Using your fingers or a colander, separate the seeds from the chaff. The seeds can then be ground or used as flour and added to dehyhydrated breads. Note: Amaranth does contain some oxalates, which can inhibit calcium and iron absorption, so be sure your diet contains calcium if incorporating more than small amounts of amaranth. Burdock (Arctium lappa) Part used: Root Burdock is bitter, sweet, and cooling. It contains vitamin C, calcium, mag- nesium, and iron. Burdock was used during the Industrial Revolution to help people cope with the health detriments of pollution. Unfortunately, the pollution hasn't gone away, but the good news is that burdock is still grow- ing in our midst. Burdock root assists many of the body's organs of elimi- nation including the colon, liver, kidneys, lymph nodes, and skin. It can be grated or sliced and added to salads. Chickweed (Stellaria media) Parts used: Leaf, flower, and stem More than thirty bird species, including chickens, are known to eat this plant. It grows outward, instead of upward, and its very presence indicates a fertile soil: it helps the soil retain its nitrogen content. Chickweed is deli- cate and delicious, and is known for its high vitamin C content. Traditionally, chickweed has been used to strengthen frail people. It has soothing and anti-inflammatory properties and can be prepared as a tea for bladder irritation, bronchial irritation, and ulcers. Chickweed is an excel- lent salve ingredient, helping to soothe everything from diaper rash to pso- riasis. The leaves, flowers, and stems can be included in salads or made into soups. It keeps well in the refrigerator for up to a couple of weeks. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) Parts used: Leaf, flower, and root Most people regard this plant as a nuisance, but dandelion has many uses. Dandelion leaves are edible in the springtime, before the plant flowers, and are high in iron and beta-carotene. The leaves also have a diuretic effect, and although most chemical diuretics deplete the body of potassium, Rati Foods Encyclopedia 89 dandelion greens, by contrast, are rich in this mineral. Dandelion blossoms can be separated from the calyx and sprinkled on salads. They contain lutein, a nutrient that is beneficial for the eyes. Dandelion roots are also edi- ble. We like to dig them up, scrub them, add a bit of olive oil and tamari, and then dehydrate them a bit—delicious! Dandelion-root tea has long been used to improve skin conditions such as acne and eczema, and also to improve liver function. Knotweed (Polygonum erectum, P. aviculare) Parts used: Aboveground plant and seed The genus name for knotweed is derived from the Greek polys, meaning \"many,\" and gony, meaning \"knees,\" in reference to the plant's numerous, jointed stems. Perhaps this appearance led to its use as a tea remedy for swollen, arthritic joints and knees. Knotweed, also known as doormat grass, is considered an important kidney herb, as it is a valuable diuretic and can be used to eliminate kidney stones. Its high silica content makes it a good remedy for strengthening the lungs' connective tissue. When knotweed stems are young and tender, between 6-8 inches in height, they can be collected, finely chopped, and added to salads. The seeds can also be used as a grain. Lamb's-quarter (Chenopodium album) Parts used: Leaf and seed The goosefoot-shaped leaves of this abundant plant have long been used as a nourishing food during times of war and famine. Rich in iron, lamb's- quarter is considered a remedy for anemia. Lamb's-quarter, like spinach, contains oxalic acid, which can inhibit absorption of iron and calcium, but lamb's-quarter is also rich in calcium and magnesium. The leaves taste like spinach but are much easier to grow and even more nutritious. The seeds can also be used as a grain. Malva (Malva neglecta) Parts used: Leaf, flower, and seed Malva leaves are soothing and anti-inflammatory. They are very rich in beta-carotene and have been included in teas and syrups for helping coughs and irritated lung conditions. As a tea, malva leaves are a traditional med- icine for sore throats and ulcers. They also make a simple poultice for treat- ing skin rashes, burns, and insect bites."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"RaWsomel Malva leaves can be eaten by themselves or added to soups, where their high content of mucilage helps thicken the pot's contents. The seeds can be eaten raw or even pickled. Because the seeds have a high moisture content, they can be used to moisten the mouth when water is scarce. Malva's deli- cate, pink and white flowers are a lovely and edible addition to grace the dinner plate. Mustard (Alliaria petiolata, A. officinalis, Brassica juncea, B. sinapiodes, Cardaria draba, Descurania species, Lepidium perfoliatum, Sinapsis alba, Sisymbrium officinale) Parts used: Leaf, seed, seedpod, and flower Mustard is an annual that grows 1-8 feet in height, depending on the species. Mustard flowers can be white, pink, yellow, or purple in color, but all have four petals in the shape of a cross with four sepals, six stamens, and one pistil. Mustard is pungent and hot, and its seeds and leaves are both used as food and medicine. Mustard is considered antiseptic, expectorant, rubifacient, and stimu- lant. It stimulates appetite and secretion of gastric juices. Mustard has been used medicinally to treat chilblains, cough, and respiratory congestion. Mustard leaves can be chopped and mixed in a salad with milder greens. The flowers and young seedpods are edible in salads and as a gar- nish. The seeds are used in pungent sauces. Note: There are no poisonous mustards. However, eat mustards only in moderation, as they do contain some irritating oils that can cause intestin- al irritation. Nettle (Urtica dioica) Part used: Young plant Nettles are probably best known for their sting. The tiny hairs of the plant contain formic acid, the same substance that causes pain from ant bites. The hairs also contain choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholine, choline, and sero- tonin, all of which can improve brain function. There are actually health benefits to the stings, such as in relieving arthritis pain. Most people will want to wear gloves and use scissors when collecting nettles. However, peo- ple in the know have learned that getting stung by nettles is very therapeu- tic because the sting increases circulation to the area, relieving pain and inflammation. I have several friends who come over to \"whack\" their wrists in the nettle patch to relieve the soreness from playing guitar all night long. RaW Foods Encyclopedia 91 Nettles are highly alkaline and very rich in iron, and are more effective than spinach in building the blood. Their abundant supply of beta-carotene and vitamin C strengthens the mucous membranes. In fact, nettles are so rich in nutrients that they help curb overeating. They are also considered anti-allergenic. Taking nettles in capsule, tea, or tincture form before the hay fever season even begins can minimize its annual discomfort. Young nettle shoots can be finely chopped and marinated in a bit of olive oil, Celtic salt, and lemon juice. Nettles can also be pureed in a food processor to make a pesto (pureeing them deactivates the sting). Note: Only young nettle plants should be consumed: once the plant starts to flower, it becomes irritating to the kidneys when ingested. Purslane (Portulaca oleracea) Part used: Leaf Although its creeping, succulent leaves are tenacious invaders, purslane is truly a valuable plant. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and is therefore help- ful in protecting the heart and lowering blood pressure and cholesterol lev- els. It is a cooling, summer vegetable with a high content of beta-carotene and vitamin C. Not only does purslane make a fine salad herb, but it is wonderful in raw soups like gazpacho. Red Clover (Trifolium pratense) Parts used: Leaf and flower Red clover is a highly nutritive, blood-purifying herb. The flavor is salty and sweet. Red clover has a cooling quality. The young flowers and leaves are edible—try them in small amounts in salads. It contains protein, vita- min C, chromium, and iron. Violet (Viola odorata) Parts used: Leaf and flower As we look deep into shady areas, heart-shaped leaves and brilliant purple flowers announce the everpresent violet. You might catch its beautiful aroma before you glimpse it. The flowers are at their prime in the spring. The leaves and flowers, both high in vitamin C, are an esteemed remedy for coughs, fevers, and lung complaints such as bronchitis. The smell and fla- vor of violets helps comfort those who are grief stricken. Violet leaves are wonderful in salads."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"92 RavJsomel SEAWEEDS Seaweeds, also known as sea vegetables, grow in the mineral-rich brine of the ocean and transform its fifty-six known minerals, including calcium, iodine, iron, potassium, and magnesium, into nutrients that we can assim- ilate. In fact, seaweeds contain ten to twenty times more minerals than land-grown plants do. Their abundant mineral content makes seaweeds an important element of the raw foods diet. Seaweeds offer many benefits to human health. They increase metabo- lism, purify the blood, help break down fat, improve joint flexibility, and help heal mucous membranes. They are naturally alkalinizing, antibacteri- al, antifungal, and antiviral. They also strengthen the kidneys and beautify the skin and hair. Energetically, seaweeds are cool and wet. They can help old \"emotion- al programming\" to resurface, allowing negative memories to come to light and have the opportunity to be resolved. In addition, seaweeds contain alginic acid, a compound that binds in the body with heavy metals, environmental toxins, and other chemicals, and then carries them from the body through the stools. The Raw Facts In the warmth of tropical waters, sea vegetables are smaller, whereas in cold waters, they are larger and grow more abundantly. Seaweeds are available commercially in dried form, often in small sheets. Crush and sprinkle them over salads, eat them plain as snacks, add them to soups as flavorings, or use them as wrappers to hold other raw delights. If you need to soften dried seaweed, soak it in room-temperature water for twenty minutes, then rinse and drain it. Use a bit of oil in preparing seaweeds to enhance your body's absorption of their minerals and vitamins A and D. Agar (Gelidleila ace rosa) Agar grows in deep water and has a trunklike stem with thorny, tubular leaves. This seaweed is rich in calcium and phosphorus. It has a cooling effect on the digestive tract and contributes to the health of blood vessels and arteries. Agar can be used to replace gelatin in vegan recipes. (Usually, 3 tablespoons of agar are soaked in 3 cups of water for a few minutes. The Rarf Foods Encyclopedia 93 water and agar are then brought to a boil for 1 minute, cooled slightly, and finally mixed with raw fruits, vegetables, or juices to thicken.) Arame (Eisenia bicyclis) Arame has a sweet, mild flavor and a relaxing nature. It is rich in beta- carotene and potassium, and supports the spleen, stomach, and pancreas. Dulse (Rhodymenia palmetto) Dulse is soft, flat, and delicate, resembling gloves or mittens. It is rich in iron, beta-carotene, and vitamin E, and it benefits the heart and spleen. Of all the sea vegetables, dulse is the easiest to digest. Hiziki (Hizikia fu si forme) Hiziki is rich in calcium, iron, and vitamins Bj, B2, and C. It strengthens the intestines and enhances the assimilation of nutrients. Hiziki is often heated in its processing, so if you can't be sure that you're getting completely raw hiziki, you might consider using a different variety of seaweed. Kelp (Fucus versiculosis) Kelp is the most common type of seaweed. It contains mucopolysaccha- rides, protein, vitamin B2, vitamin C, and minerals. Kelp is antibacterial, antibiotic, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, diuretic, emollient, nutritive, and expectorant. It has a softening and draining effect on the body and can be used to help treat lymph node enlargement and tumors. When ingested, kelp combines with residues of drugs, chemicals, and radioactive stron- tium-90 and carries them from the body. It also stimulates a sluggish metab- olism and can be helpful as part of a weight-loss program. Kelp is often used in powdered form as a seasoning, as it imparts a salty flavor. Kombu (Laminaria species) With its long, flat fronds, kombu can grow up to 1,500 feet long. This sea- weed is high in calcium, iron, potassium, sodium, and glutamic acid (a fla- vor-enhancing compound). Kombu is especially strengthening to the kidneys and reproductive system. Nori (Porphyra tenera) Nori is low-growing and fragile and makes its home in shallow water. It is"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"94 RauJsome! high in protein, beta-carotene, and minerals. Nori stimulates circulation and gives short bursts of energy, relieving fatigue and loneliness. Buy only black nori sheets, as the green ones have been roasted. Sea Palm (Postelsia palmaeformis) Sea palm resembles a palm tree, grows on rocky shores, and is almost con- stantly pounded by the surf, enduring more hardship than most plants. It contributes greatly to stamina and supports glandular function. Wakame (lindane* pinnatifida) Wakame has serrated leaves and a strong spine. It is rich in protein, trace minerals, beta-carotene, and B-complex vitamins. Wakame helps support the liver and nervous system as well as mental flexibility. GREEN SUPERFOODS A \"superfood\" contains high concentrations of nutrients. The following three superfoods are packed with nutrients, including chlorophyll, and have energizing, detoxifying, rebuilding, and immune-strengthening properties. To feel more vibrant than ever before, make a habit of including at least one of these raw, green superfoods in your daily diet. Blue-Green Algae (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) This species of algae is found in freshwater lakes, where it reproduces at a very fast rate (almost daily in the summer). Upper Klamath Lake in south- ern Oregon is the only place in the world where large quantities are avail- able in the wild. Blue-green algae are said to be 65 percent assimilable protein, and the softness of the cell walls makes them easy to digest. The algae are also rich in neuropeptides, which can boost the activity of the brain's neurotransmitters. This superfood is a tremendous energizer and is available in both powder and tablet forms. Spirulina (Spirulina platensis) Spirulina, named for its spiral shape, is a multicelled algae that grows in warm, alkaline or salty waters. It is rich in gamma linoleic acid (GLA) and is 65 percent protein; in fact, 1 acre of spirulina yields 20 times more pro- tein than an acre of soybeans. These algae are easy to digest due to their soft-walled cell structure. Popular with dieters, this superfood is loaded RauJ Foods Encyclopedia The Benefits of Chlorophyll All of the green superfoods contain bountiful supplies of chlorophyll, the green pigment that most plants require for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll could be con- sidered the blood of the plant—in fact, there is but one atomic bond's differ- ence between chlorophyll and hemoglobin. Chlorophyll stimulates red blood cell production, strengthens the immune system, and minimizes the effects of pollution. It is an anti-inflammatory agent and relieves pain. Although it doesn't kill germs directly, chlorophyll fights internal and external infection by creating an environment that interferes with their growth; in helping the body to break down undesirable bacteria, it acts as a natural deodorizer and promotes better bowel function and digestion. Chlorophyll can help curb chronic skin conditions, sinusitis, pyorrhea, gastric ulcers, anemia, arteriosclerosis, and depression. It mitigates stress and calms the mind. In 1943, The American Journal of Surgery reported that chlorophyll sped wound healing by 24.9 percent. It works in this way by reducing inflammation, reducing the synthesis of fibrin (a blood protein associated with platelet aggre- gation, or clotting), inhibiting bacteria, and promoting tissue repair by stimulat- ing healthy granuloma tissue and fibroblasts (cell types that form a matrix to rebuild the damaged area). Chemical, heat, and radiation burns respond quick- ly to topical chlorophyll treatments. Before immune-suppressing drugs were available, chlorophyll was applied to skin grafts to encourage their acceptance by the body; there have even been cases of chlorophyll treatments saving limbs that were being considered for amputation. Chlorophyll has also been shown to help neutralize and deactivate carcino- gens. In 1986, the journal Mutation Research published research by Ong and colleagues on chlorophyll's potent antimutagenic effects against environmental and dietary substances. Tests showed that chlorophyllin (a water-soluble form of chlorophyll) neutralizes the cancer-causing activity of tobacco, fried beef, coal dust, and other compounds. In contrast to the many pharmaceuticals that require increasingly larger doses to continue being effective, repeated use of chlorophyll does not cause the body to build up a tolerance to it. Chlorophyll also exhibits no toxicity whether ingested, injected, or applied topically, making it one of the most dis- tinctive substances known to science."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"% Raw som el with nutrients, including vitamin B12 and the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, which suppress appetite and help one to feel satisfied. Spir- ulina is available in powder form, which can be sprinkled into salads, soups, or guacamole. Wheatgrass (Triticum species) Wheatgrass is the term for sprouted wheat berries that have been grown into a grass. The hard berries are usually sprouted outdoors or in trays of soil indoors and the wheatgrass appears, as the name implies, like small shoots of grass (see \"The Raw Facts\" on page 123 and Sprouting Guide on page 126). You can grow your own wheatgrass or buy it fresh at natural foods stores. It is usually consumed as juice but is also available in dried powder and tablet form. Wheatgrass is an incredible superfood; though it is 95 percent water, the remaining 5 percent carries a host of nutrients, including 90 out of a possible 102 minerals. Wheatgrass is a rich source of beta-carotene, B-com- plex vitamins (including B 12 ), vitamins C, E, K, and U, calcium, cobalt, iron, magnesium, germanium, phosphorus, sodium, sulfur, zinc, seventeen amino acids (including the eight essential ones), and at least eighty enzymes. It also contains superoxide dismutase (SOD), which is a potent antioxidant that inhibits the activity of free radicals, and abscisic acid, which is a plant hormone believed to regulate growth and metabolism and to defeat cancer cells. According to some studies, dehydrated wheatgrass has a protein com- position of 47.4 percent (three times higher than that of beef). Wheatgrass is antibacterial, antiviral, and alkalinizing. It detoxifies, purifies, and builds the blood. It helps eliminate phlegm from the intestines, nourishes the brain and nervous system, and prevents degenerative disease. People who drink wheatgrass juice feel energized and clearheaded from their daily shots of \"grass.\" Many health benefits are ascribed to wheat- grass and its juice, including: • Relieving indigestion • Improving body odor • Relieving arthritis and rheumatism • Reducing alcoholic tendencies • Helping reduce obesity RaW Foods Encyclopedia        9?        • Cleansing the liver • Helping alleviate depression • Improving blood sugar levels • Reducing high blood pressure • Eliminating heavy metals (cadmium, copper, aluminum, lead, mercury) from the body • Reducing inflammation of mucous membranes • Reducing destructive effects of X-rays and other radiation • Improving digestion • Correcting anemia by increasing red blood cell count • Stimulating growth of connective tissue • Improving skin health • Helping prevent hair graying • Improving vision • Slowing the harmful effects of carbon monoxide and other air pollutants Applied topically to the affected area, wheatgrass juice or a poultice of the grass is said to: • Accelerate healing of wounds and burns • Eradicate moles and blemishes • Reduce varicose veins • Relieve scalp conditions such as dandruff • Freshen breath • Relieve toothache and sore throat • Prevent tooth decay • Treat canker sores and bleeding gums • Restore gum tissue and control pyorrhea (infection and loosening of tooth sockets) • Remedy athlete's foot • Remedy yeast infection or vaginitis"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"98 RauJsome! When first added to one's diet, wheatgrass or its juice can cause nausea or stomachache, especially if too much is consumed. Start with 1 teaspoon of juice daily and gradually increase the amount to 2 ounces three times daily. Sip it slowly, mixing it well with your saliva. Do not eat for at least an hour after drinking more than 3 ounces of wheatgrass juice. Juicing wheatgrass requires a special juicer, which can be obtained from any of the suppliers listed in the Resources section. Wheatgrass can be juiced in combination with other foods such as carrots, celery, parsley, spinach, kale, or dandelion greens. For those times when you can't juice your wheatgrass, its nutrients can be extracted very effectively by chewing it and then spitting out the pulp: 2 ounces of chewed wheatgrass is equal to 1 ounce of fresh juice. If the wheatgrass is very young, it can be eaten as is or mixed in with salads. Note: People who are allergic to wheat are usually sensitive to gluten, a substance that is found in the grain but not in the grass. If you have a wheat allergy, start your wheatgrass regimen slowly, and discontinue it if you have an allergic reaction. •••EDIBLE FLOWERS Flowers, the sex organs of plants, add grace and beauty to any dish.

They are antioxidant, moisturize the skin, contribute to joint and muscle flexibility, and facilitate digestion by lubricating the body's digestive tract. In the body, they form a protective layer around the nervous system and insulate the nerves from shock. The linolenic acid and lineoleic acid found in raw fats can help the body metab- olize stored deposits of cooked fats. People deficient in fats tend to be irritable and unable to cope with stressful situations. A diet totally devoid of fats can cause previously accu- mulated fats to harden in the body, and can intensify cravings for fat. Too much fat, on the other hand, can cause acne, body odor, constipation, and a hot and hungover feeling. The best fats are those found in whole, raw foods such as avocados, durians, nuts, sun-cured olives, soaked seeds, and young coconut. Oils, having been extracted from their source, are not exactly a whole food, but olive oil and coconut oil are two acceptable sources of raw fat. Hemp seed oil and flaxseed oil are also used to some degree, as both are rich in omega- 3 fatty acids and benefit the skin, hair, and emotional balance. Flaxseed oil goes rancid quickly, whereas hemp seed oil is more stable. Oils deteriorate quickly and are likely to become rancid in the presence of heat or light. All oils should be stored in dark, glass bottles and kept in the refrigerator, where they will solidify from the cold. Take them out of the refrigerator ten minutes before you need to use them, and they'll return to their liquid state readily. Olive Oil Olive trees can live for centuries, even as long as 2,000 years (though their average is 300-600 years). Although slow growing initially, the trees sprout new branches if cut, have deep taproots, and thrive in sunshine. Olives are rich in protein and polyphenols, which are water-soluble antioxidants with antifungal and antibacterial properties. Olives and olive oil soothe the stomach and help congested lymphatic system and lungs. Olive oil is digestible and nourishing; it penetrates, softens, and strengthens. The first pressing of olive oil uses gentle pressure, with heat rising no higher than room temperature. The oil of the first pressing is marketed as \"extra-virgin\" olive oil. The next pressing's oil is marketed as \"virgin.\" Sub- sequent pressings of olive pulp and seeds use solvents and high heat and are marketed as \"pure\" olive oil. The best olive oil is stone-pressed, extra-virgin."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"104 RaWsome! Coconut Oil Coconut oil, also known as coconut butter, is solid at room temperature but becomes a clear liquid at temperatures higher than 78°F. It is a primarily a saturated fat, but it is very digestible: so much so that it is often added to infant formulas, or fed to infants and children who cannot digest other fats. In the body, it is quickly metabolized for energy production. Raw coconut oil does not elevate cholesterol levels or promote blood platelet aggrega- tion. To avoid harmful trans fats, use only cold-pressed or expeller-pressed coconut oil. Know your source. Some companies label their oils \"cold pressed\" even though the oil temperature may reach 200°F. Coconut oil contains both short- and medium-chain fatty acids. In lab- oratory tests, the medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) have been shown effective against flu, measles, sinusitis, food poisoning, urinary tract infec- tions, cavities, gonorrhea, toxic shock, fungal infections, hepatitis C, and Candida. Coconut oil is antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiproto- zoal. It helps stimulate thyroid function, normalize blood sugar levels, decrease seizures, and relieve chronic fatigue. Coconut oil can be used in raw dishes such as Asian fare, cakes, can- dies, and salad dressings. A wonderful skin-care product with a long shelf life, it smells great and imparts beauty and radiance when rubbed on the skin. Coconut oil is used in massage, skin care, and first-aid creams to heal Concerns about Oils Most vegetable oils are extracted from their source with chemical solvents. The oils are then boiled to remove the solvents—but even after boiling, traces of the solvents remain. Even oils labeled \"cold pressed\" or \"expellar pressed\" are usu- ally heated above 115°F; here, \"cold\" is a relative term, meaning that the pressing occurs at a temperature lower than normal but still hot enough to give you a good burn. Once the oil is extracted, preservatives are often added to extend the product's shelf life. Heating fats, such as oils, produces carcinogenic free radicals. Heated fats impair the blood's ability to transport oxygen by clogging capillaries with fat globules, and can congest vascular walls, contributing to arteriosclerosis and other cardiovascular disorders. Heated fats can also cause acne, impaired liver function, and unpleasant body odor. Rati foods Encyclopedia 105 and prevent scarring. People suffering from psoriasis may benefit from top- ical applications of coconut oil. It can also be used as a sexual lubricant, though not with condoms or other latex forms of birth control. i SEASONINGS Fresh, raw, organic food is delicious in itself. Seasonings simply comple- ment that deliciousness, harmonizing with or providing a counterpoint to the food's flavor. Using herbs and spices with familiar flavors as condiments can help you make the transition to raw foods. Many seasonings offer many wonderful therapeutic benefits as well. Some have potent antimicro- bial properties that aid in food preservation and prevent E. coif and salmo- nella contamination; and most culinary herbs and spices are rich in natural, volatile oils that improve circulation to our digestive systems and thus improve our ability to assimilate nutrients. When seasoning your food with herbs, use fresh herbs whenever possi- ble. If you have more fresh herbs than you'll need and they're still on the stalk, set them in a glass of water in the refrigerator. If you are using dried herbs, buy or harvest them whole and then grind or chop them only as needed. Store dried herbs in glass jars away from light and heat. The following herbs, spices, and other seasonings are all wonderful accompaniments to a raw foods diet. Fresh Herbs Versus Dried Herbs Most of the recipes in this book call for fresh herbs. Fresh herbs always contain more chi, or life force. However, organic herbs that are dried at low temperatures and are not irradiated are available yearround. Also, herbs that come from faraway places, such as cinnamon, will be available only in dried form. Dried herbs tend to have a stronger flavor and absorb moisture from the other ingredients. If you must substitute dried herb for fresh herb in a recipe, use half as much dried herb as the recipe specifies.

All-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"106 RavJsome! spice earns its name because it can take the place of cinnamon, cloves, or nutmeg in just about any recipe. Anise (Pimpinella anisum) Part used: Seed Aniseed is a sweet, warming spice that is recommended to improve diges- tion and relieve colic, hiccough, and bloated bellies. It has long been used as a tea or in syrups for people with coughs and asthma to help expectorate phlegm. Chewing aniseeds after a meal will sweeten the breath. Basil (Ocitnum basilicum) Part used: Entire herb Basil is pungent, warm, and dry. It helps improve digestion and circulation. Using basil in food especially benefits the lungs, spleen, stomach, and large intestines. It is used to treat colds, coughs, headache, and nausea. Caraway (Carum carvi) Part used: Seed Caraway is pungent and warm with antiseptic, expectorant, and galacta- gogic properties. It improves circulation and helps with many gastroin- testinal problems such as nausea, Crohn's disease, colic, cramps, flatulence, and hiccoughs; in particular, it improves the digestion of starches. Chew a few caraway seeds when traveling at high elevations to help relieve short- ness of breath. Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) Part used: Seed Cardamom is pungent, slightly bitter, sweet, warming, and dry. It was favorite ingredient in ancient love potions, and to this day is considered an aphrodisiac. Cardamom helps relieve a wide range of digestive disorders including bloating, celiac disease, colic, flatulence, indigestion, nausea, and stomachache. When added to grains, it enhances their digestibility. Chew a few cardamom seeds removed from the pod after a meal to sweeten the breath. Cayenne and Jalapeno Pepper (Capsicum annuum) Part used: Fruit Cayenne and jalapeno peppers are hot, pungent, and drying. They are rich Rati Foods Encyclopedia 107 in beta-carotene and vitamin C. Hot peppers like cayenne and jalapeno are consumed in large amounts in tropical climates because they induce per- spiration, which helps a person to cool off. They have been used to improve circulation and in treatments for arthritis, chills, colds, coughs, dysentery, flu, and migraines. When ingested, cayenne and jalapeno also cause the brain to secrete more endorphins, which can block pain. Diluted and applied topically, powdered hot pepper inhibits the transmission of sub- stance P, which would otherwise transport pain messages to the brain. The Raw Facts Hot peppers vary greatly in their amount of heat. Use them judiciously when preparing a recipe and taste-test as you go, so you don't end up creating something inedibly hot! Celery (Apium graveolens) Part used: Seed When consumed with food, celery seed aids in the digestion of protein. The seeds are valued medicinally for their anti-inflammatory, antifungal, aphro- disiac, antirheumatic, antispasmodic, carminitive, deobstruent, diuretic, emmenagogic, galactagogic, hypotensive, nervine, sedative, sudorific, tonic, and urinary antiseptic properties. Celery seed reduces inflammation, dispels heat and toxins (including uric acid), cleanses the liver and kidneys, and softens deposits in the body. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum species) Part used: Bark Cinnamon is warming, pungent, and sweet. It is a supreme digestive tonic and helps invigorate the abdominal area, relieving gas, nausea, and diar- rhea. Cinnamon is regarded as an aphrodisiac and antifungal agent, and it also calms the nerves. When taken as a tea, cinnamon can help people whose rheumatism worsens from exposure to cold weather. Clove (Eugenia aromatica) Part used: Bud Cloves are pungent and warm. They contain eugenol, a powerful anesthet- ic, and are often used in dentistry to numb the gums or tooth. Cloves are"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"108 RaWsomei used medicinally to treat indigestion, halitosis, parasites, nausea, and sexu- al debility. Clove essential oil exhibits activity against streptococcus staphylococcus, and pneumonia bacteria. Sucking on a whole clove helps keep the breath fresh. Coriander/Cilantro (Coriandrum sativum) Part used: Seed The seeds of Coriandrum sativum are known as coriander, and the plant that grows from the seeds is known as cilantro. Coriander is pungent and neutral in temperature. Coriander is used to improve digestion and break up mucus, and has antibacterial properties. Cilantro is considered a blood- purifying agent. Both are regarded as digestive aids that help treat bloating, colic, cramps, flatulence, and indigestion. Cumin (Cuminum cyminum) Part used: Seed Cumin is slightly bitter, pungent, warm, and rich in flavonoids. An anti- spasmodic, it relieves coughs, diarrhea, indigestion, and headache, and is a galactagogue (increases milk production) in nursing mothers. Cumin is also used topically as a liniment for speeding the healing of bruises and sprains. Dill (Anethum graveolens) Part used: Seed Dill seeds are pungent and warm. The name \"dill\" comes from the Old Norse word dilla, meaning \"to lull,\" because these seeds were tradition- ally made into a tea that lulled colicky babies to sleep. Early American set- tlers referred to dill as \"meetin' seed\" because, during long sermons, it was given to small children to keep them calm and used by adults to quiet rumbling stomachs. Dill seeds aid digestion, freshen the breath, and relieve hiccoughs. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) Part used: Seed and leaf Fennel is pungent, sweet, and warm. It aids digestion and is a galacta- gogue. Its expectorant properties make it helpful in calming a cough. Fen- nel leaves are a traditional eye, brain, and memory tonic and help disperse liver congestion. Rati Foods Encyclopedia 109 Garlic (Allium sativum) Part used: Bulb Garlic is pungent, hot, and drying, and has a wide range of therapeutic ben- efits. It lowers blood pressure, and it prevents platelet aggregation (keeps blood from clumping together) so that circulation can flow better. Garlic exhibits broad-spectrum activity against disease-causing organisms includ- ing bacteria and viruses. It has some antiparasitic activity as well, and can make you a less-hospitable host to mosquitoes, ticks, and even giardia. Garlic improves lung capacity and is used for treating respiratory infec- tions. To chase away garlic breath, eat parsley or a small piece of organic- lemon peel. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) Part used: Root Ginger is hot and pungent. It benefits digestion and improves circulation. Ginger helps increase the concentration of amylase in the saliva, thus improving carbohydrate digestion. It also increases intestinal muscle tone and aids digestion, particularly that of fatty foods. Ginger is beneficial in treatments for colds, menstrual cramps, and arthritis. In a double-blind study conducted at Brigham Young University, ginger outperformed Dra- maminein preventing motion sickness. By the way, ginger does not have to be peeled before use. Honey Honey is sweet and has a neutral energy. It calms ulcers and lowers high blood pressure. Applied topically, it can soothe burns. Most commercial honeys have been pasteurized, causing them to lose their medicinal proper- ties. Raw honey is available at natural foods stores and from raw foods suppliers. Darker honey tends to have a greater mineral content than lighter honey has. If you can't find raw honey, you can substitute six small, pitted dates for each tablespoon of honey called for in a recipe. Horseradish (Armoracia lapathifolia) Part used: Root Horseradish is high in vitamin C and aids in the digestion of fatty foods. It has both antiseptic and decongestant properties, making it helpful for open- ing congested respiratory passages."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"u    RavJsome!    Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis) Part used: Aboveground herb Lemon balm improves digestion, strengthens the nervous system, and is mildly antiviral. The great Arab physician Avicenna wrote, \"Lemon balm causeth the mind and heart to be merrie.\" The sourness of its lemony fla- vor helps stimulate the liver. Miso Miso is a puree of fermented soybeans, salt, and sometimes grain. It contains protein and enzymes. Miso helps neutralize environmental pol- lutants in the body. In the Orient, it is considered a longevity tonic. Look for unpasteurized miso. Lighter-colored miso has less enzymatic activity and tends to be less salty than darker miso. Lighter-colored misos are more cooling, while darker-colored misos are more warming. Mustard (Brassica nigra, B.juncea, Si napis alba) Part used: Seed Mustard seeds are pungent and hot, and rich in protein and sulfur. They have analgesic, antiseptic, and expectorant properties. Mustard seeds have been used to treat coughs and respiratory congestion. Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) Part used: Kernel Nutmeg is pungent, warm, and dry. Medicinally, it is an antiemetic, anti- RavJ Foods Encyclopedia Ml inflammatory, antispasmodic, aphrodisiac, astringent, carminitive, circula- tory stimulant, and stomachic. Nutmeg is used in treatments for bronchial irritations, colic, Crohn's disease, delirium tremens, diarrhea (especially diarrhea occuring first thing in the morning), digestive tract infections, insomnia, dysentary, eczema, flatulence, gastroenteritis, halitosis, indiges- tion, muscle spasm, nausea, rheumatism, and vomiting. Nutritional Yeast This type of yeast is generally grown on sugar beets or molasses and is available in the form of flakes. Nutritional yeast contains synthetic B-com- plex vitamins, as well as minerals (including phosphorus), and it imparts a cheesy flavor to raw dishes. Nutritional yeast is not a purely raw food itself, as it is heated to around 250°F during its processing, but some raw foods enthusiasts use it in small amounts; others choose to avoid it. Oregano (Origanum vulgare) and Marjoram (O. majorana) Part used: Leaf Oregano and marjoram are pungent and warm. Both are valued as antiox- idants, antiseptics, and cholagogues. Use these closely related herbs to treat lung problems such as bronchitis, cough, pleurisy, and tonsillitis. They can also help relieve headache, indigestion, measles, mumps, and nausea. Fresh oregano or marjoram leaves can be chewed at the site of a toothache. Paprika (Capsicum tetragonum) Part used: Fruit Paprika, a mild relative of cayenne, is sweet and warm. It is high in beta- carotene, flavonoids, and vitamin C. Paprika has antibacterial properties and has been used to treat high blood pressure, scurvy, seasickness, and varicose veins. It improves the health of the circulatory system by promot- ing blood vessel elasticity. As a digestive aid, paprika improves the secretion of saliva and stomach acids as well as increasing peristaltic movements. Parsley (Petroselinum crispum) Part used: Herb Parsley is neutral and sweet, and is rich in beta-carotene, vitamin C, and iron. It is also high in chlorophyll, which builds the blood. Parsley is a time-tested remedy for arthritis, edema, gout, halitosis, kidney inflammation, and kidney stones. The herb can also be used topically as a poultice to treat bruises. Buying Bee Products For years, I avoided buying any bee products because of concern for the exploitation of the decreasing bee population, which was being traumatized by mites, urbanization, and pesticides. A beekeeper of a small local business reminded me that he and other beekeepers were doing all they could to sus- tain and protect the bees, and that in order for their efforts to be successful, they needed to be supported. So if you do buy honey, make sure it is from an environmentally conscious company that cares for the bees and does not allow them to be harmed. We depend upon viable bee populations to contin- ue to pollinate so many of our vitally important plant foods."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"112 RavJsome! Pepper (Piper nigrum) Part used: Fruit Pepper (black and white) is pungent and hot. It has antibacterial properties and helps dispel phlegm in the body. Pepper has been used to relieve arthri- tis, colic, diarrhea, flatulence, indigestion, and poor circulation. Black pep- per comes from the unripe but fully grown berry, while white pepper comes from the peeled mature fruits. Peppermint (Mentha piperita) Part used: Leaf Peppermint has a fresh, pungent, cooling flavor. Its antiviral properties make it beneficial in preventing illness. Peppermint has the added benefit of being a natural breath freshener. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) Part used: Leaf Rosemary is warm, pungent, bitter, and drying. It is a natural antioxidant. Rosemary has been used to freshen the breath, aid digestion, ease anxiety, improve mental alertness, relieve headaches and coughs, and improve eyesight. Rosewater Rosewater is distilled from the petals of rose flowers (Rosa species). It is not truly a raw product and is rarely available in organic form. However, one tea- spoon of rosewater added to a smoothie or dessert imparts a beautiful flavor. One drop of rosewater can be added to drinking water to improve digestion. Saffron (Crocus sativus) Part used: Stigma Saffron is neutral and sweet. It is the most expensive spice in the world, as the stigmas (female organs) of about 100,000 saffron flowers are required to make a pound of saffron spice. Saffron relieves digestive and urinary problems. It is diaphoretic and helps the skin eliminate toxins from measles and chicken pox. Sage (Salvia officinalis) Part used: Leaf Sage is pungent, warm, and drying. It is considered an anaphrodisiac (curb- ing sexual desire) and an antigalactagogue (inhibiting production of breast milk). It also reduces hot flashes and sweating and has antiseptic properties. RaW Foods Encyclopedia 113 Consider sage a remedy for colds, diarrhea, and flatulence. A poultice of fresh sage leaves can be used to soothe insect bites and wounds. Salt The best type of salt for the raw diet is Celtic salt, which is harvested from a 9,000-acre ocean region of Brittany, France, and is not kiln dried. It con- tains over eighty trace minerals and has lower sodium content than other refined salts. Look for the coarsely ground variety, as finely ground Celtic salt is heated to 200°F during its processing. Celtic salt has a grayish color and appears damp compared to other commercially available salts. Scallion (Allium fistulosum) Scallions, also known as green onions, are pungent, bitter, and warm in energy, with a milder flavor than garlic or onion. Scallions are rich in sul- fur and have antibacterial and antifungal properties. They are used in Ori- ental medicine to treat colds, flu, diarrhea, edema, and high blood pressure. Spearmint (Mentha spicata) Part used: Aboveground plant Spearmint is pungent, cool, and drying. It has antibacterial and antiviral properties. Spearmint is an excellent digestive aid; it has been used to treat colic, fatigue, fever, flatulence, and nausea. Being a mild, less medicinally tasting mint, spearmint is often a better choice than peppermint for culinary recipes. Tamari Tamari is a type of fermented soy sauce made from soy, wheat, salt, and water. Raw foodists prefer the Nama Shoyu® brand, which is unpasteurized and contains active enzymes. Tamari is high in sodium (though lower than traditional soy sauces), so it should be used sparingly. Tamarind (Tamarindus indicus) Part used: Fruit pulp Tamarind, the fruit pod of a tree native to India, is rich in beta-carotene, niacin, vitamin C, calcium, and phosphorus. In North America, the pulp that surrounds the pod is often sold in dry form; if it is tough, it may need to be soaked before use. This pulp is used as a sour condiment in Caribbean and Indian dishes. Tamarind pulp or paste is valued as a digestive aid, lax- ative, and refrigerant."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"114 RawJsomel Tarragon (Artemesia dracunulus) Part used: Aboveground plant Tarragon is warm and moist. It improves digestion and has been used as an oral anesthetic to numb the mouth from toothache pain. Tarragon has carminative and galactagogic properties and is a traditional remedy for arthritis, flatulence, gout, halitosis, nausea, rheumatism, and worms. Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) Part used: Aboveground plant Thyme is pungent, mildly bitter, warm, and drying. It is a powerful anti- septic with activity against bacteria, fungi, molds, and parasites. Thyme is excellent for treating respiratory infections, colds, and coughs. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) Part used: Rhizome Turmeric is pungent, bitter, and warm. It contains the antioxidant curcum- in, known for its anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. It is an excellent herb for arthritis, asthma, Candida infection, eczema, jaundice, and high cholesterol. Turmeric is an effective post-trauma remedy used both internally and topically to reduce inflammation in bruises, swellings, and wounds. It stimulates wound healing, works as an anticoagulant, and has antifungal properties. Turmeric helps beautify the skin, eliminating acne, boils, and other impurities by purifying the blood and imparting a healthy skin color and texture. Vanilla (Vanilla plani folia) Part used: Bean Vanilla is sweet and warm, and best known as an aphrodisiac and digestive stimulant. It is also the second-most expensive spice in the world. The bees that once pollinated the orchids that produce vanilla beans are extinct as a result of pesticide use, and only a few species of hummingbirds and butter- flies participate in the pollination process, so the plants generally must be hand-pollinated within a few hours of opening. Be sure to use pure vanilla extract (not vanillin, which is artificial). Vanilla extract is available in vegetable glycerin or alcohol and is not truly raw. One-half inch of vanilla bean can be substituted for one teaspoon of vanilla extract, or the vanilla can be ommitted entirely, if desired. RaW Foods Encyclopedia 115 Vinegar Vinegar is a product of fermentation, and there are many different types. Fruit and grain vinegars, such as apple cider and balsamic, tend to be less acidic and milder in flavor than distilled white vinegar. Vinegars have a cool, drying effect on the body. Excess use can wrinkle the skin and weak- en muscle tone. Interestingly, vinegars have a soothing and cleansing effect for people with a hot temperament. I tend to use lemon juice in place of vinegar, but if vinegar appeals to you, make sure it is raw and unpasteurized (mostly available as apple cider vinegar). Spice Blends You can buy premade, raw spice blends in bulk from natural foods stores (spice blends found in regular grocery stores tend to be irradiated or chemi- cally treated), but making your own is fun and can be an opportunity for culinary creativity. For the best flavor, buy whole herbs (for example, the seed rather than the powder), which retain the aromatic and flavorful essen- tial oils, and grind them yourself with a mortar and pestle or in a grinder."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":",R aw food preparation is much easier with the following helpful kitchen tools. Although the initial cost of purchasing them all may seem steep, I highly recommend investing in setting up a fully equipped raw kitchen with these tools. You won't need much else, and then your first forays into a raw foods diet won't be met with the frustration of not being able to try a wide range of recipes. You can eventually get rid of your stove, pots, toaster, microwave, waffle iron, deep-fat fryer, and so forth. (Now that we don't use our oven, it makes a great place to store our juicer. We even grow trays of sunflower greens and buckwheat lettuce on the stovetop.) Talk to friends who own some of these tools and ask for their opinions and suggestions about the best types and brand names. Blender. A sturdy blender works wonders for making smoothies, salad dressings, and purees. I prefer the Vita-Mix brand, which is multipurpose and super-powered. A regular two-speed (or more) blender also works fine for most recipes. Citrus juicer. You'll be juicing lots of lemons and limes for salad dressings, and an electric model speeds up the process. A hand juicer will also do the job. Colanders. Try to get one with \"feet,\" as that enables excess water to drain away freely. Food dehydrator. A dehydrator is the raw foodist's replacement for a stove. I highly recommend the Excalibur. Whatever the brand, you'll want a dehy- drator with a temperature-control mechanism; most have one, but some don't. Without temperature control, temperatures might start at a level high enough to kill the precious enzymes. Be sure to get the solid, nonstick,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"118    Raw some! The Raw Kitchen Strainers. Having strainers of various sizes will make food preparation and clean-up easier. Trays. Cafeteria-style trays or baking sheets of stainless steel or plastic can be used to grow wheatgrass and other sprouts (see Sprouting Guide on page 124). Vegetable brush. With a sturdy vegetable brush, you can scrub roots clean without having to peel away their nutritious skins. Water filter. If your water supply is anything but fresh, clean, unchlorinat- ed, pure water, you'll want a water filter. Many raw foodists recommend the EcoWater® filter, as it's easy to use, effective, and economical. Wheatgrass juicer. Fresh wheatgrass juice is an astonishing nutrifier, but a normal blender or juicer will not juice wheatgrass: you have to use one designed specifically for the purpose. Electric and hand-powered models are available. However, vegetable juicers such as Green Star, Green Power, Omega, and Samson can be used to make wheatgrass juice. SPROUTING Sprouts are truly a living food. Unlike fruits and vegetables, which stop grow- ing when plucked from their mother plant, sprouts continue growing up until the moment they are digested, and impart a subtle life force to the body. Germination, or the process of sprouting, releases the nutrients in a seed and makes them more available for absorption. It can also increase a seed's nutritional content by as much as 400 percent. Sprouting activates the seed's plant hormones (phytosterols) and increases its metabolic activi- ty: the seed's starches are broken down into simpler sugars, proteins are predigested into easy-to-assimilate, free amino acids, and fats are convert- ed into easily digestible and soluble fatty acids. Sprouts are considered excellent anti-aging foods due to their rich supply of enzymes. They also contain good amounts of vitamin C, B-complex vitamins (including B| 7 , also known as laetrile, which has been used in cancer treatment), and vita- min E, as well as chlorophyll. Sprouts are especially beneficial in terms of their ability to provide enzymes to the body. Seeds—including beans and grains—are an important element of the human diet, but they contain enzyme inhibitors (factors that keep enzymes dormant until the right growing conditions—not those found in the bean bin at your local grocery—are present). Phytic acid, an enzyme reusable Teflex sheets or dehyclrator sheets, as they are referred to in some recipes, that are available for many dehydrators. These sheets fit over the mesh trays in dehydrators to prevent wet, drippy food from sliding through the mesh, and they are also needed to make flax crackers, cakes, cookies, pizza crusts, and other such fare—don't think you can substitute with wax paper, as it doesn't work. Food processor. A food processor quickly grates, chops, and purees, mak- ing it so easy to have a big salad daily. It performs many of the same func- tions as a blender but can handle bigger, tougher foods. Ice cream maker. This is not a necessity, but your friends and family will love you for it. Glass jars. Glass mason jars are great for storing dry goods such as nuts, grains, and dried food, and they also can contain drippier foods such as soups and salad dressings. They make cupboards neater than having bags everywhere. To prevent bug infestations, put a bay leaf in each jar. Juicer. There arc many varieties of juicers: centrifugal force juicers (a disk shreds the produce and the pulp is spun to the sides of the basket); masti- cators (the produce is grated and then pressed); single-gear juicers (a single auger crushes the produce against the sides of a strainer basket); and twin- gear juicers (the produce is shredded and the juice pressed from it by two gears). I prefer the twin-gear juicers, as they are the easiest to use, make excellent juice, and do not require you to extricate the mashed produce from the basket midway through juicing. Knives. You'll need good kitchen knives, including a 10-inch paring knife. Ceramic knives are great, as they do not oxidize the edges of chopped food, but they are somewhat fragile and are not ideal for hard vegetables such as rutabagas. Nutcracker. I recommend the Krakanut^ brand. Spiral sheer. You'll need the Saladacco Spiralizer®, the Spirooli®, or any other type of spiral slicer that allows you to make turn vegetables into angelhair-sized threads of \"pasta.\" Sprouting bags (also known as nut milk bags). Besides their uses in sprout- ing, these bags are great for straining nut milks and vegetable juices. They can also be used to strain excess liquid when making nut cheeses, for example. Sprouting jars. Be sure to get sprouting jars with wide mesh lids."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"120    RaWsome!    The Raw Facts Beans are best used in small quantities and not as a major part of a raw foods lifestyle. Even when sprouted, beans still contain lots of starches that are not completely transformed into simple sugars and can be difficult to digest. Personally, I find sprouted beans (with the exception of lentils and mung beans) hard to digest, and so I avoid them. Jar Sprouting For sprouting, it's best to use organic seeds, or at least seeds that have not been treated with chemicals. \"Weed seeds that can be sprouted using the jar method include amaranth, burdock, clover, dandelion, lamb's-quarter, mus- tard, plantain, sorrel, yellow dock, wild garlic, and onion. You can sprout seeds in containers made of glass or ceramic, but not of metal, plastic, or wood. (Although plastic jars should be avoided, plastic lids are acceptable.) Glass is ideal, because it enables you to watch the amazing growth of new life. Removing the inner lid from a canning jar and replacing it with a piece of stainless-steel or plastic window-mesh can make an inexpensive sprouter. Health food stores carry different types of sprouters or sprouting lids that fit over canning jars. Make sure the con- tainer has a mouth that is wide enough to allow easy removal of the sprouts from the jar. Pour the seeds into the sprout jar (discard any broken or chipped seeds, as they will not sprout). Small seeds should just cover the bottom of the sprouting jar. Bigger seeds should not fill the jar more than one-eighth full. Then, cover the seeds with two to three times their volume in room-tem- The Raw Kitchen 121 perature or cold water, and give the jar a little shake to get rid of air pock- ets between the seeds. In general, soak small seeds for four to six hours and larger seeds for eight to twelve hours. (See Sprouting Guide on page 124 for more specific soaking times.) When you are soaking larger seeds, change the water twice during the soaking process. If seeds are left to soak for longer than twelve hours, they can ferment. After the seeds have soaked, apply the sprouting lid and turn the jar upside down to drain out the water and let oxygen circulate into the jar. Place the jar upside down in a location where the temperature stays around 70°F. Most people sprout seeds in their kitchen or other moder- ately well-lit place, but sprouts will tolerate darkness for at least the first couple of days. After your sprouts have grown for a few days, increase their bounty of chlorophyll by placing them in indirect sunlight for at least six hours before harvesting. While the seeds are sprouting, rinse them two or three times a day, just enough to get rid of any foam, and after each rinsing, drain them and return the jar to the sprouting location. Be sure to keep the jar upside down, preferably at an angle so that oxy- gen can get into it. Excess moisture and inadequate ventilation are a sure way to grow mold as well as sprouts; however, do not allow the sprouts to dry out or they will die. As a general guideline, when the \"tail\" of the sprout is one and a half times as long as the original seed, the sprout is ready for consumption. To harvest sprouts, soak them in a bowl of cool water, allowing the hulls to float to the top; scoop out and discard the hulls, and then drain and rinse the sprouts. If you rinse and drain the sprouts every three days after har- vesting and store them in the refrigerator, they will keep for about a week. Paper-Towel Sprouting Small seeds like those of flax, chia, watercress, mustard, radish, and teff can be sprouted on paper towels (unbleached and undyed). First, soak the seeds as described for the jar method, above. Place two moistened paper towels in a glass pan. Sprinkle the soaked seeds evenly over the towels and cover with two more moistened paper towels. When the sprouts are about V 2 to \\\\ inches long, remove the paper towels on top and set the pan in sunlight for three to four hours to allow the sprouts to develop chlorophyll. They can be rinsed afterward and consumed immediately or placed in a covered container, stored in the refrigerator, and rinsed before use. inhibitor, inhibits the absorption of calcium, iron, and zinc. Ingesting enzyme inhibitors can lead to health problems, such as digestive difficulties, enlarged pancreas, or general poor health. Cooking destroys enzyme inhib- itors, but it also destroys the enzymes. Sprouting gets rid of the enzyme inhibitors and preserves the healthful enzymes. The most nutritious, easiest-to-grow sprouts are: • Buckwheat • Fenugreek • Radish • Clover  • Mustard  • Sunflower"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"122 RaWsome! Tips for Troubled Sprouts If your seeds don't sprout when you're using the jar or paper-towel method, the cause of the problem is likely to be one of the following: • You soaked the seeds for too long or too short a period of time. • The seeds were of poor quality, with a resulting low rate of germination. • The seeds were old and they rotted rather than sprouted. • The sprouts were crushed through rough handling. • You left the seeds in a spot that became too hot and cooked them. • The growing sprouts did not have adequate drainage and developed mold. • You did not rinse the sprouts frequently enough and they dried out. Tray Sprouting for Grains and Grasses This method works best for barley, buckwheat, kamut, rye, spelt, sun- flower, and wheat (when sprouting wheat, use the hard, red berries, not soft wheat). One pound of seeds will produce about 4 pounds of grass. Store the grain in a cool, dark location and in a sealed container to keep out bugs and rodents. It is best to procure seed in the fall, when it is freshly matured. First, soak the seeds in at least twice their volume in water for twelve hours or overnight. Next, prepare a tray filled with about 5 / 8 inch of grow- ing medium. Black humus from the woods, including leaf mold and the black earth underneath, works well, and a bit of kelp can be added to the growing medium to enrich it with minerals. You can also use organic pot- ting soil or a combination of equal parts of Canadian sphagnum or peat moss and organic, untreated soil. Whatever you choose, the soil should be light and airy. Finally, spread the seeds out on the tray of dirt, without piling them on top of one another. The soil needs to be kept moist, so put the tray in the basement or cover it with plastic for the first few days to conserve moisture. In very dry climates, you may need to wet a paper bag and place it over the the Raw Kitchen seeds. When the sprouts are about 2 inches high, remove any coverings and place the tray near a sunny window. Three hours of sunlight daily is ade- quate, although more light will speed the growing process. (If the grasses are pale, they are not receiving adequate sunlight.) Water the tray only once daily. When the sprouts are 8 inches high (in about one week to twelve days), it's time to harvest them. Using scissors or a serrated knife, cut the sprouts as close to the soil surface as possible (many of the sprouts' nutri- ents are concentrated close to the soil). After the harvest, keep watering the tray to obtain a second harvest; the sprouts of the second harvest, however, will not be as nutritious as those of the first. When the second growth has been harvested, compost the contents of the tray, which will be filled with grass roots. Sometimes mold forms on the seed of a sprouting grass. At first it looks like white cotton, but it becomes grayer as it matures (do not confuse mold with the young, ciliar hairs on the rootlets). Mold is most likely to form during hot, humid weather. It can also result from excess watering or from inadequate spacing between plantings. Mold does not make the grass unus- able—simply wash it off the sprouts after harvest. If flies are attracted to the mold, just vacuum them up as best you can. If mold turns out to be a chronic problem for you, you can prevent it by soaking the seed for twen- ty-four hours in the refrigerator, draining and rinsing it well, and allowing it to sprout for twelve hours before placing it in the soil. The RaW Facts Strictly speaking, \"wheatgrass\" (one word) refers to trays of wheat that are sprouted indoors, whereas \"wheat grass\" (two words) refers to wheat sprouts grown outdoors. (For the purposes of this book, however, I have simply used the term \"wheatgrass\" to denote any sprouted wheat that has grown long enough to become a grass.) In mild climates, wheat can be sprouted outdoors in locations that are sunny but protected against direct sun from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M., when the sun's rays are most intense."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"124 RaWsomel SPROUTING GUIDE The following chart is a guide to sprouting.

JUICING Raw fruits and vegetables contain an abundance of natural juices that can help dissolve impurities in the body. Fresh-pressed juice is better than com- mercial, pasteurized juice, because pasteurization involves heating to a high temperature, which destroys a juice's enzymes and breaks down many of its nutrients. Because it is extracted from fruits and vegetables, juice contains many of their nutrients but not the fiber. It is easy for the body to assimilate and does not burden the digestive system. Juices can oxidize quickly and should be consumed within a few minutes of extraction. They should be sipped slowly, however, for optimal digestion. Gulping down juice bypasses the The RavJ Kitchen 127 first agents of the digestive process: the digestive enyzmes in saliva. When you take the time to savor the taste of juice in your mouth, these enzymes have a chance to begin the digestive process. The easiest way to make fresh juice from fruits and vegetables is to process them in a juicer. If you don't have a juicer, you can puree the pro- duce with some water in a blender, and then strain the mixture through a sprouting bag. Avoid peeling fruits and vegetables with edible skins, such as apples and carrots, because in many cases the peels have unique nutritive components; also, some of the organisms that produce vitamin B12 are often found on the skins. Do peel those fruits and vegetables with tough or inedible skins, such as bananas, beets, avocados, and waxed produce. Good Juices The following fruits, vegetables, and greens make excellent juices. Try mix- ing up different combinations for truly delicious savory and sweet drinks. * drinking more than a full wineglass, undiluted, can cause dizziness and nausea ** best juiced with a citrus juicer * use only in small amounts mixed with other juices % use only in small amounts mixed with other juices +t don't use more than 2 ounces undiluted ** dilute with other juices • Apples  • Mustard greens • Asparagus  • Onions* • Beets*   • Parsleys • Cabbages  • Parsnips • Carrots   • Radishes** • Citrus fruits** • Red bell peppers • Cucumbers  • Romaine lettuce • Endive  • Spinach • Fennel   • String beans • Garlic*  • Sweet potatoes • Horseradish  • Turnips • Leeks   • Watercress"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Raw Kitchen"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"130 RaWsomel Although it docs cause some loss of nutrients, dehydrating is preferable to cooking or any other method of food storage. These foods require only one- sixth the storage space of fresh foods and so are great for travel and camp- ing. Dried foods stored in glass containers in a dark area can last for several years (though it's best to consume them within six months). Remember, however, that fresh food is superior. To prepare fruits and vegetables for dehydration, slice them thinly into pieces no more than % inch thick. Small fruits such as grapes or berries can simply be cut in half. If you would normally peel the fruit or vegetable or remove its seeds, do so before dehydrating it. When drying fruit that tends to discolor, soak it first in pineapple juice or diluted lemon juice to protect the color, if desired. Dried fruit can be soaked in water for a few hours to be reconstituted. The Raw Facts When purchasing dried fruit, be sure it has not been treated with preservatives, such sulfur dioxide and potassium sorbate. Preservative- treated fruits retain much of their bright color, whereas untreated fruits are browner or darker. Air Drying You can dry foods outdoors during warm, sunny weather or indoors in a warm, dry location. Just set the food on trays or racks that allow for air circulation underneath. Place cheesecloth or nylon mesh over the food to keep bugs away. Depending on the food and its thickness, dehydration could be completed in one to four days. Turn the items regularly so that they dry equally on all sides. If you're drying outdoors, bring the trays in during rainfall and at dusk, before dew settles. Return the trays to the sun the next day. Using a Food Dehydrator As mentioned earlier, your food dehydrator should have a temperature-con- trol mechanism. Why? Because enzymes are destroyed at around 118°F, and most dehydrators without temperature-control mechanisms operate at temperatures higher than that. I recommend keeping a dehydrator set to under 100°F. The RaW Kitchen 131 Food dehydrators are equipped with mesh trays or racks for holding the foods to be dried. The dehydrator circulates warm air around the foods, gradually evaporating the water content. For this reason, it's important not to overload the trays, as this might impede air flow and proper drying. If you're dehydrating a puree or some type of gooey food, you'll need to place it on solid trays that can then be slid right on top of the mesh trays or racks. Solid dehydrator trays, usually made of Teflex, are sometimes sold with dehydrators but may also be purchased separately. Because these solid trays won't allow air flow through them, you'll need to flip the items on them midway through the drying process to ensure that they dehydrate properly. In many cases, once the item is dry on one side and you're ready to flip it, you won't need the solid tray anymore, and you can place the item direct- ly on the dehydrator rack. Keep food that is nearest completion on the bottom dehydrator trays; moisture tends to rise and can be transferred to higher trays. You can also turn trays a quarter turn each time you check your food's progress to help ensure even drying. Dehydrator-Dried Fruits and Vegetables Air drying depends so much on temperature and humidity that it is impos- sible to give exact drying times for the process. Dehydrators offer a bit of standardization, although they too are affected by climate. The times given on page 132 are approximations. You'll know the foods are fully dried when they feel that way. FERMENTING Fermentation is one of the most ancient methods of food preservation. It requires no electrical equipment or high-tech materials. Fermenting can be done in a glass, ceramic, or hard plastic container with a press or heavy lid. I bought a simple pickle press from Gold Mine (see the Resources section) and I love using it to make sauerkraut from cabbage and wild greens. The process of fermentation involves breaking down foods by using liv- ing microorganisms, such as enzymes. Fermented foods are rich in friendly bacteria, including Lactobacillus breuis and L. planarum. These bacteria convert starches and sugars into lactic acid and acetic acid. Fermented foods tend to be somewhat acidic and thus are beneficial for people who are overly alkaline."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"132 RaWsome! Fermented foods also aid in the colonization of other beneficial bacte- ria that inhibit the overgrowth of unfriendly microorganisms, such as Can- dida (yeast). They are easy to digest and bring a rich supply of enzymes into the body. They are a superb food for the elderly. Miso, tamari, sauerkraut, apple cider vinegar, kirn chee, yogurt, Reju- velac, kombucha, and kefir are all fermented products. Chapter 5 includes recipes lor sauerkraut (page 159) and Rcjuvclac (page 151), which arc both fermented foods.

Enzymes cease working at very cold temperatures, but are not destroyed; they're ready to go back to work when temperatures normalize. I don't eat frozen foods except for occasional homemade nut or banana icecream or a dessert that is firmed in the freezer. When food is frozen, its cell walls tend to burst due to the expansion that takes place when liquids freeze solid. Foods with lower water content are less adversely affected but nevertheless do experience some cellular breakdown. Frozen foods also lose much of their vitamin C content when they are thawed. If you are going to eat frozen raw foods, I recommend eating only those you prepare yourself. Commercially frozen foods are often blanched (dipped in boiling water) to preserve their color beforehand, but blanching destroys up to 66 percent of the enzymes. When preparing produce for freezing, do not blanch it. Also, package foods to be frozen in typical serv- ing sizes and in the form in which you would eat it (that is, cut corn ker- nels from the cob, peel bananas, and so on). Consume frozen foods within six months."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"efore you get started on a recipe, here are a few basic points to keep in mind: • All ingredients should be raw, of course (raw carob powder, raw tahini, raw almond butter, unpasteurized miso, and so on). A few recipes in this chapter call for items that are not raw. These can be used for flavor, if desired, or omitted. • Use organic produce whenever possible. • Wash all produce. • Peel what needs to be peeled (for example, bananas, avocados, jicama, papayas, and any waxed produce); otherwise, leave the peel on (for example, carrots, apples, and unwaxed cucumbers). • Remove large, hard seeds, such as those of dates and prunes, and also some smaller ones, such as those of citrus fruits and papayas. • Remove woody stems, such as those of figs and apples. • Use pure water in any recipe that calls for water (or for soaking). • When a recipe calls for soaking nuts or seeds, you'll typically soak them in twice as much water as their dry volume. Large nuts are generally soaked from eight to twelve hours. Small nuts and seeds are gener- ally soaked from four to six hours. Rinse nuts and seeds in a colander after soaking, and drain them well and quickly before using them. Dis- card the nut soak water in the garden or use it to water plants. It is not for consumption.

This practice equates to saving money (food costs less when it's plentiful), supporting your own health (foods are most nutritious when and where they ripen), supporting local farmers, and reducing waste (locally grown foods do not have to be shipped great distances or overly packaged). Although it may be difficult to eat seasonally all the time, and although \"local\" may at times mean no more than \"North American conti- nent,\" making an effort to guide your diet at least partially by the seasons will vastly benefit you and your community.

You are the best judge of when something in your dehydrator is ready. • When dehydrating, keep the dehydrator's temperature set to just under 100°F. • Many raw soups can also be used as salad dressings and as sauces for entrees or side dishes. • Be joyous in your food preparation.

Peo- ple who are most concerned with the healthfulness of their diets may not live up to this statistic, tending instead to eat meals prepared by their own hand at home, but life does bring occasions when eating out is necessary, whether at a restaurant, at a dinner party, or on the road. Before you start worrying about the hassle this could be, be assured—eating raw away from home can be a simple proposition. The following tips should help. Restaurants Raw restaurants are a growing trend (see the list in the Resources section), and if there's one in your area, you're in luck—you can arrange to have most of your restaurant outings there. However, whether for the sake of companions who are not raw or because there isn't a raw restaurant in the area, at some point you'll find yourself venturing through the doors of a \"cooking\" restaurant. Your best raw bet in a non-raw restaurant is a salad. If the restaurant doesn't have a salad bar, examine the salads on the menu, being sure to read the lists of ingredients carefully and asking the waitstaff to omit anything cooked when you order. For salad dressing, ask for olive oil and lemon juice, or you can easily bring your own raw dressing from home. I often 251"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"252 Ratisome! order a salad as an appetizer and another type of salad as an entree. Adding your own chopped avocado or nuts to a restaurant salad makes it feel more like a meal. For breakfast, ask for a fresh fruit platter. Tell the waitperson you want more fruit instead of the usual cottage cheese. You might consider bringing along some dates to add to it. No fruit platter? Perhaps they have a ripe melon. Do your best, but be prepared to compromise, and be gracious with the waitstaff, who will have to go out of their way to answer your questions and procure your special requests. Dinner Parties When you are invited to a dinner party that will not be raw, inform your host of your food program as soon as you receive the invitation, but tell him or her not to fret or go to any trouble to accommodate you; offer to bring to the party a raw dish that you can eat as a main course and that oth- ers can try, if they wish, as a side dish. When you're talking to your host or to your friends, avoid preaching the benefits of the raw diet. Once you've told them that you're on a raw diet, they may ask about it, but if they do not, don't force the details on them. When you are the host of your own dinner party, you can introduce your guests to the delights of a raw diet without any lecturing at all, sim- ply by offering a wide range of delicious raw foods. Good party fare includes: • Raw vegetable chips (fresh, or dehydrated with a touch of olive oil and Celtic salt) of carrots, jicama, Jerusalem artichokes, sweet potatoes, and zucchini • Flax crackers • Raw dips for the chips and crackers • Canapes • Guacamole • Pates spread on cucumbers, celery sticks, or sprouted breads or crackers • Watermelon boat • Shish kabobs on toothpicks • Slices of cucumber or zucchini with nut butters Batina Rati tiith Family and Friends    m    • Cherry tomatoes • Guacamole • Nuts and seeds • Marinated vegetables • Fruit slices • Nori rolls • Pizzas • Dates stuffed with almond butter • Fruit fondue (bite-sized portions of apples, bananas, pears, and mangoes with various sweet dipping sauces) • Vegetable fondue (bite-sized portions of carrots, bell peppers, cucum- bers, and zucchini with various sweet or savory dipping sauces) See Chapter 5 for more recipes and ideas. Presentation of food is highly important, and perhaps even more so with raw foods. It's always best to prepare dishes as close as possible to the time of consumption so that the fresh foods won't wilt or discolor. Serve foods on beds of colorful greens, grated carrots, or sliced cabbage. Use gar- nishes that complement the dishes in flavor and color, such as: • Cucumber slices  • Watercress • Radish roses  • Chopped nuts • Cherry tomatoes  • Olives • Cauliflower buds  • Chopped red pepper • Carrot curls  • Berries • Sprouts   • Slices of citrus fruits • Avocado balls (scooped out * Pomegranate seeds with a melon bailer)  • Star fruit slices • Buckwheat lettuce  • Fresh herbs (basil, chives, cilantro, • Sunflower greens     dill > fennel, oregano, mint, parsley, or rosemary) • Lemon slices • Edible flowers"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"254 Ratisome! Geometric designs offer another option for creative food presentation. You can place a lacey, paper doily or a large maple leaf on the food, sprin- kle on paprika, cinnamon, or another powdered seasoning, and then care- fully remove the doily or leaf, leaving behind an interesting design. Nuts, dried fruit, or edible flowers can be used to make a mandala design on your presentation. Cookie cutters are useful for making interestingly shaped sprouted crackers, and pretty rings or molds add an extra flair to raw cakes and pates. Finally, serve your food on beautiful plates, bowls, and platters to make it a feast for the eyes as well. Traveling Being raw will lower the cost of traveling, because raw foods are generally less expensive than cooked foods. In fact, you can even plan your vacation around your raw diet: travel to a fruit-filled, tropical paradise during mango or durian season; visit the wilds of Maine during blueberry season; and enjoy the hospitality of the South during peach or orange season. When traveling by car, bring an ice chest to carry your raw salad dress- ings; during hot weather, keep your fruits and vegetables in the chest, too. A cutting board, knife, sprout bag, bowls, and utensils are also useful. Prepare dried fruits and vegetables before a trip. Take flax crackers, raw granola, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, and sun-cured olives. Keep a small container of unpasteurized miso with you; it can be stirred into a bit of purified water to make a soup broth. Travel with superfoods such as powders or tablets of barley grass, wheatgrass, spirulina, or blue-green algae for the nutrients and energy they provide, especially if you can't count on being able to find fresh vegetables. Make it part of the fun of your journey to find health foods stores and restaurants that serve salads. Stop at roadside markets. Take the opportu- nity to eat simply. Have an adventure! INTRODUCING RAW TO YOUR FAMILY You might be ready for the raw life, but perhaps not everyone in your fam- ily is. When you begin, ask your family members for—and thank them f or —their support. Let them know that you are not expecting them to join you in your new diet, but that you look forward to having more raw foods available at meals, so that you can all still eat together. If being raw is a new thing in the household, slowly increase the amount of raw food on the table. Serve salad before anything cooked. Find out what kinds of foods other family members enjoy, and make raw versions of them. Eating Rati tiith Family and Friends 255 Most importantly, let go of the need to change others. You will impress people more with your health and vitality than you ever will with preach- ing. Be a living example of your beliefs. Living Raw with Children Children can enjoy a raw foods diet from the moment of birth. Breast milk is, after all, the supreme raw food. It is fresh, nutritious, safe, free of con- tamination, and always the right temperature, and it comes in lovely con- tainers! Breast milk is ideal for a baby's first six months to one year of age. The World Health Organization is currently encouraging women to nurse for at least two years, and many mothers nurse for even longer. Diluted carrot juice can be introduced to babies between four and six months of age. After six months, diluted, noncitrus fruit juices can be given on occasion. For nursing babies, limit their juice intake to 3-4 ounces daily, so they focus on breast milk. Coconut water is excellent for young children and can be given after six months. Green vegetable drinks can be intro- duced between six to nine months of age; if they taste strongly, they can be sweetened with apple or carrot juice or diluted 50 percent with water. Nut and seed milks can be introduced around eight months, and smoothies can be given to babies from nine months and up. Citrus fruits and juices can be given when the child is at least one year of age. Solid foods can be started around six months, when the baby is able to hold his or her head up independently or has doubled his or her birth weight. A blender or grinder can be used to mash raw foods into suitable baby fare. It is wisest to introduce only one new food a week; try mixing a bit of the new food with a food that is already familiar to the child. Bananas are an ideal first solid food. Other raw foods that make excellent, blended baby foods include: • Apples • Mangoes • Spinach • Apricots • Melon • String beans • Avocados • Papayas • Sweet potatoes • Berries • Peaches • Winter squash • Cherimoyas • Pears • Yellow squash • Cherries • Peas • Zucchini • Coconut meat (fresh and young) • Plums"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"25ft If any of these foods need to be sweetened, blend in some soaked raisins or dates. When the child reaches toddlerhood, he or she will appreciate solid fin- ger-food. Peel those foods that can be peeled and introduce solid foods only under supervision, as babies choke easily, whether their food is raw or not. Good finger-foods include: • Apples  • Mangoes • Pears • Bananas  • Melon  • Plums • Berries  • Peaches  • Summer squash Spirulina can be given in small amounts, about V 4 teaspoon daily, to a child over seven months old. Spirulina is a good source of protein and chlorophyll. The Raw Facts Do not give honey to babies less than two years of age, as there is a slight danger of botulism; children over the age of two will not be susceptible to it. Use soaked dates, apricots, or figs for sweetening, if needed. Better yet, offer unsweetened foods that are naturally delicious. Once a child has adequate teeth to chew well and begins to show an interest in what adults are eating, he or she is ready to explore the full palate of adult food. At this point, one way to encourage your child to eat more vegetables is to serve a tasty dip along with them. Tahini, which is made from ground sesame seeds, is rich in protein and calcium, tastes pleas- ant, and makes a good vegetable dip. Ground sunflower and pumpkin seeds are rich in the mineral zinc and are excellent for kids who are slow to grow. Sea vegetables are a great source of minerals for developing bones; use kelp or dulse in dressings and as seasonings. Often it is the texture of a vegetable that children dislike, not the flavor of the vegetable, so try a variety of forms and textures to see what your kids like best. If your child is a picky eater, ask him or her for suggestions. Rather than announcing that broccoli is on the dinner menu, try asking the child if he or she would rather have broccoli or zucchini, and honor his or her pref- erence. If your children are quick to assert that they hate broccoli, remind them that they might have disliked it when they were four (for example), 257 but now that they are six, and much bigger, they might find that they like it. Children appreciate the opportunity to show their maturity. Take your child shopping with you and ask him or her to select one produce item for every color of the rainbow that he or she would like to eat. Decoration, presentation, and humor are particularly effective tools in living raw with children. Delight your kids by making food in shapes such as their initials, hearts, animals, or flowers. Use raisins, nuts, or sliced fruit to design a happy face or mandala on a salad, a bowl of sprouted cereal, or an open-faced, sprouted-almond butter sandwich. Create theme menus: a jungle meal, for example, or a meal featuring foods from a particular coun- try. Invite young ones into the kitchen to help; participating, even in simple tasks like stirring, pouring, or decorating, can give a child a sense of hav- ing contributed to the family's meal. Almost all children like sweets and to deny them will only cause argu- ments, so be sure to provide homemade, raw sweets. Make fresh-frozen treats from mashed watermelon, orange juice, or apple juice. Freeze some Raw Carob Milk (see page 145) for \"fudgey-sicles.\" Use fruit and dried fruit in place of candy. Rather than forbidding kids to eat certain foods, explain to them why these are foods your family chooses to avoid. But don't expect your children to be totally raw their entire lives. They'll have friends, school lunches, and restaurants to tempt them with non-raw food, and they'll want to try it. It's not worth a big argument if your kids decide to eat unraw; in fact, you're likely to turn them off the raw foods diet if you are maniacal about it. Just make sure your kids have healthy, raw food available at all times, so that Raw for Your Pets Dogs and cats are often among the members of a family. They are not natu- rally vegetarian, of course, but in nature all animals do eat their food raw. Your household pets can, too. At the very least, they can benefit from some raw foods being introduced into their diet. Cats often like avocados, sprouts, toma- toes, cucumbers, nutritional yeast, spirulina, and garlic powder.

THEME DINNERS Dinners with a theme are especially fun for parties, holidays, and special celebrations. You don't need to make all the dishes suggested for a theme, of course, but try at least a few for a varied, scrumptious meal. You can also throw a potluck dinner, and have each attendee make one of the dishes from the theme group. (Check the index for page numbers.)

A discussion on the phi- losophy of food combining closes the chapter. Isn't it wonderful to be able to heal your body while enjoying nature's bounty? ACIDITY AND ALKALINITY Acidity and alkalinity can be measured by the pH scale, a numerical range from 0 to 14: 7 is neutral, lower numbers indicate increasing acidity, and higher numbers indicate increasing alkalinity. In layman's terms, pH is a measure of hydrogen-ion concentration or activity. Acidity is a state of excess hydrogen, and alkalinity is a state of insufficient hydrogen. \"Excess\" and \"insufficient\" are, of course, relative terms; pure water has a pH of 7, whereas the human body is, overall, slightly alkaline. Acid is associated with yin qualities and alkali with yang qualities. An acidic condition, thus, could also be described as a yin excess, and an alka- line condition could be described as a yang excess. Taking this concept one step further, those foods that are acid-forming in the body stimulate yin, while those foods that are alkaline-forming stimulate yang. Electrolytes can affect the body's pFI balance. Electrolytes are minerals (including calcium, lithium, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium) that, when in solution, conduct electricity. Alkaline elements attract a negative charge, and acid elements attract a positive charge. 261 Middle Eastern Mediterranean Salad or Tabouli Salad Hummus Falafel Balls with Tahini Sauce Vegetable Kabobs Coconut Pudding Lemon Delight Oriental Asian Salad or Mermaid Salad Coconut Soup Asian Broccoli Spring Green Rolls with Mustard Sauce and Sweet and Sour Sauce"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"262 Rartsome! Acidosis When excess hydrogen atoms are present in the body, this is a state called acidosis, in which the excess hydrogen can combine with oxygen to create water. This process depletes the body of oxygen; as a result, lactic acid builds up, the system become even more acidic, and cellular function is diminished. Acidosis can cause the mind to work more slowly, as well as causing inflammation, puffiness, and tissue tightness. An overly acidic con- dition is a breeding ground for cancer, diabetes, parasites, and immune deficiencies. Acidosis is also a major factor contributing to drug addiction. Signs of acidosis include: • Craving coffee, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and other drugs • Stress headaches • Anger and short temper • Muscle stiffness and spasms • Sinus congestion Chlorine, iodine, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur are the most common acid-forming elements. Acidic compounds of these elements tend to be present in the roots and seeds of plants and the muscles of animals. Alkalosis When less hydrogen is present in the blood and tissues, this is a state of increased alkalinity, or alkalosis. Alkaline elements and compounds are prevalent in the body and are required in bodily fluids, including blood. In fact, healthy cells are slightly alkaline. Most people will find that their health and well-being benefit from becoming more alkaline through diet; being overly alkaline, however, is unhealthy. Symptoms of alkalosis include: • Anxiety   • Chronic coldness • Overexcitability  • Muscle spasms • Spaciness  • Slow recovery from injury • Laziness  • Muscle tension and pain Using Food for Healing The Raw Facts Although many fruits are known to have an acidic flavor, they may, in fact, promote alkalinity in the body. For example, many think of lemons and oranges as being acidic; however, they have an alkalinizing effect in the body.

Color therapy, or the con- scious implementation of color to encourage well-being and healing, has been used in schools, hospitals, workplaces, and other institutions for decades. Science has shown that blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate are decreased by exposure to cool colors, such as green, blue, and black, and increased by warm colors, such as red, orange, and yellow. We often select our clothing to invoke certain moods: light, bright col- ors to complement the hues of spring, or deep, dark colors for somber occasions. We decorate our homes with paints, pillows, tapestries, and lights of different colors in an effort to evoke certain atmospheres. Our choices of color in terms of our diet have a similar power. Colors in plant foods not only indicate the presence of certain nutritional compounds but, when ingested, yield a vibrational energy that can be used to nourish both our physical and emotional selves. For optimum health, eat foods in a wide range of colors. Your meals should be a riotous rainbow of color, rather than a bland palette of whites or browns. Celebrate life by celebrating color!

Red stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. It can be used to treat anemia, colds, low blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, weakness, and depression. It helps one feel present and grounded. Use red when feel- ing run down, to improve athletic performance, and when quick energy bursts are required. A study done on athletes at the University of Texas indicated that viewing red light increased strength by 13.5 percent and pro- duced 5.8 percent more electrical muscle activity. When red is present in food, it often denotes ripeness or sweetness, as well as the presence of lycopenes, quercetin, and vitamin C. Because red is so energizing, it should be avoided in decorating eating areas, as it makes diners feel hurried. In packaging, however, red is attention getting and high- ly visible, so you'll find it often on supermarket shelves.

It symbolizes enthusiasm, outgoingness, optimism, confidence, joyfulness, and courage. Orange can lift spirits, foster humor, and loosen repression. Orange is associated with the sexual center, skin, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and bronchial tubes. Use orange to help relieve asthma, bronchitis, constipa- tion, diarrhea, gas, hemorrhoids, and hypoglycemia. In plant foods, orange is often an indicator of high carotene content. Being a social color, orange is useful for decorative highlights in places where people gather, such as family rooms. Fast-food restaurants use orange to attract lots of people without encouraging them to linger.

It is also associated with wisdom, knowledge, logic, and the mind. Yellow is used to benefit the adrenal glands, gallbladder, liver, muscles, nervous system, pancreas, and stomach. Illnesses that can be treated with yellow are allergies, arthritis, asthma, constipation, coughs, depression, diabetes, eczema, gallstones, gas, hiatal hernia, hypothyroidism, indiges- tion, lymphatic congestion, motion sickness, and obesity. Yellow is a nerve stimulant; it can be helpful with depression, fear, and tension, and can soothe mental exhaustion. Yellow in food often indicates the presence of lutein, magnesium, and vitamin C and limonene. Because it is a sharpening color that enhances alertness, concentration, communication, and focus, you will often find yellow on food packaging.

(The Ayurvedic tradition, however, includes a sixth flavor, astringent; see the description of sour, below.) When we eat, our taste buds transmit signals about the type and potency of the flavors they are experiencing; when our brain receives those signals, it rec- ognizes the flavors. According to Oriental medicine, the experience of each flavor stimu- lates various physiological functions. Salty, sour, and bitter are considered yin or cooling, with a downward-moving energy. Yin flavors tend to arise and subside quickly. Sweet and pungent are considered yang or warming, with an upward-moving energy. Yang flavors are slower to be sensed and remain longer in the mouth. These are vast generalizations, of course, and exceptions exist. Most foods contain a combination of flavors. Cinnamon, for example, is both pungent and sweet, whereas apples are both sweet and sour. Having a diet balanced in all five flavors helps keep the body in balance; omitting one fla- vor from the diet is like removing a color from the rainbow, leaving you with a less beautiful, less harmonized experience. Unfortunately, the typical Western diet tends to overemphasize the sweet and salty flavors while abandoning the bitter, pungent, and sour flavors. It's also important to eat a diet that varies in potency of flavor. Some foods, like watercress, have strong flavors, and some, like lettuce, are mild. Eating a diet of only mild, bland foods can make the personality thus. Choosing only strongly flavored foods may support an overly intense per- sonality. As is so often the case, moderation and variety are the keys to health and well-being. Savor the many flavors of life! The Raw Facts To improve your sense of taste, chew food thoroughly to allow more mole- cules to interact with your smell and taste receptors. The back of the tongue is most receptive to bitterness; the sides react most sensitively to salty and sour flavors; and the tip of the tongue reacts most to sweetness."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"272 Rati some! Sour The sour flavor is cooling, drying, and astringent. It is usually due to the presence of acids such as ascorbic, citric, and malic acid. Sourness stimulates the liver, gallbladder, appetite, and salivary function, and can aid in fat metabolism. It can restrict secretions such as seminal fluid, sweat, urine, blood, and diarrhea. It helps tonify tissue and may benefit con- ditions such as varicosities and hemorrhoids. Excessive sourness, however, can weaken the muscles, impair digestion, and make one's flesh tough. Some examples of sour foods are lemons, lemongrass, orange peel, raspberries, rhubarb, rose hips, sorrel, tomatoes, Rejuvelac, seed-milk yogurt, and apple cider vinegar. The astringent flavor is a powerful version of sour. It is very drying and cooling. Examples of astringent foods include pomegranates, cranberries, beans, lentils, broccoli, cabbages, cauliflower, celery, spinach, and cinnamon. Bitter The bitter flavor is considered cooling, drying, strengthening, draining, and anti-inflammatory. This flavor usually indicates the presence of some type of alkaloid. Bitterness stimulates the small intestines, pancreas, and digestive secre- tions. It helps strengthen the heart, lower cholesterol and fevers, deter par- asites, improve the metabolism of fats, and strengthen people with food allergies. Bitterness helps eliminate heat and phlegm, especially from the lungs, and is often indicated in cases of inflammation and health conditions involving excess dampness. It is also beneficial for people who are lethargic as well as hot and aggressive. Too much bitterness, however, can be drying and contractive, causing skin withering and hair loss. People who are cold, dry, or suffering from ulcers should limit the bitter flavor in their diet. Examples of bitter foods include celery, endive, escarole, hops, kale, parsley, spinach, and yarrow. Sweet The sweet flavor is an indicator of sugars in a food. Sweetness nourishes the yin, or fluids, of the body; they, in turn, help build up the person who is dry, has a weak immune system, or is frail. The sweet flavor is regarded as a general tonic that is especially nour- Using Food (or Heating 273 ishing to the stomach and spleen. It mitigates acute symptoms, increases tolerance for stress and pain, and both energizes and calms. Excessive sweetness, however, can lead to lethargy and congestion, slow down diges- tion, and cause aching in the bones and joints. Examples of sweet foods include bananas, dates, figs, prunes, mangoes, peaches, pears, raisins, apple juice, orange juice, honey, stevia (an herb that is used as a natural sweetener), winter squash, and sweet potatoes. Pungent (Spicy) The pungent or spicy flavor is warming and dispersing. Most pungent foods contain some sort of essential oil that moves internal energy to the surface, and they are said to be cooling to the interior of the body while warming to the exterior. Many pungent foods have antimicrobial activity. The pungent flavor affects the lungs and large intestines in particular. It induces perspiration, stimulates the nerves, and promotes circulation. It also stimulates hydrochloric acid production and thus aids digestion. Pun- gent foods are especially beneficial for those with cold constitutions. Too much pungency can decrease flexibility, impair digestion, and lead to erec- tile dysfunction and exhaustion. Limit pungent flavors in the diet in cases of general debilitation, dizziness, burning sensations (such as sweating, heat in the mouth, or even hot flashes), and neuralgia. Examples of pungent foods include basil, cayenne, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, horseradish (especially wasabi), mustard greens or seeds, onions, oregano, peppermint, radishes, and rosemary. Salty The salty taste is cold, softening, draining, and diuretic. It indicates the presence of mineral salts. Salt especially affects the nerves, kidneys, and bladder. It aids fluid metabolism and helps strengthen the nerves. If used in moderation, salt can have a cleansing effect in the body; for example, it can help soften hardened masses, such as tumors. The overuse of salt, however, can con- tribute to fluid retention, erectile dysfunction, gray hair, loose teeth, eczema, and high blood pressure. Craving salt excessively may indicate adrenal exhaustion. Celery, dill, and sea vegetables like kelp and dulse are good examples of salty foods."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"274 RauJsome! THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES The Doctrine of Signatures is a philosophy that appears in almost every world culture. Its foundation is the concept that every living thing is marked with a \"signature\" (however subtle it may be) that tells its use, function, or role in the world. The signature is a function of the organism's features and environment. This philosophy holds, for example, that by observing a plant closely and taking note of the color of its flower, the shape of its leaf, and how and where it grows, we can determine its place in the universal plan. According to the Doctrine of Signatures, plants that thrive in a partic- ular environment are meant to be used—in the diet or as healing medi- cines—by the denizens of that environment. Plants that grow right outside your back door, for example, may be saying, \"Use me. Use me a lot.\" Plants that are rare in a particular environment might be asking to be used with caution and respect. Plants available only in the spring or fall might be appropriate for just that time of year. Would you believe that kidney beans, which are shaped like a human kidney, are good for the kidneys? That beets, with their blood-red color, help build the blood? That cauliflower, with its cerebrum-shaped head, nourish- es the brain? Although this reasoning may sound superstitious, it often turns out to be true. We must simply discover the connection between plant and effect. Some might say that the attribution of signature comes after the fact, as a result of the discovery of a plant's use: \"Ah, yes, we have seen that cau- liflower nourishes the brain. And oh my—cauliflower looks like a brain, too! Obviously, it was trying to tell us what we have just discovered.\" But such skepticism begs the question of which came first: the discovery of cauli- flower's brain-nourishing powers, or of its particular form and shape? If you have trouble believing in the philosophy and its implications, you can at least consider it a system of memory cues. Once you've learned that beets build the blood, for example, you can commit that fact to memory by linking their blood-red color with their blood-building properties. And whether or not one is to give any credit to the Doctrine of Signatures, con- sider the terminology associated with cooking: fried, burned, baked, toast- ed, grilled, roasted, scrambled, scorched, seared, irradiated, parched, scalded, smoked, sizzled, and so on. These are all terms associated with pain, fire, and destruction. Wouldn't you rather avail yourself of the life energy of raw foods: fresh, crisp, alive, vital, natural, active, and colorful? Using Food for Heating 275 FASTING If the medical professionals courageously popularized the fast among their patients, there would be infinitely less suffering than there is now. That many would be saved who now die through the drug and feeding treatment is a certainty. —Gandhi (1945) The ancient practice of fasting is the safest, quickest, and least expensive method of healing. It accelerates both physical and spiritual purification and rejuvenation. Although your immune system will function at optimal strength while you're on a raw foods diet, if you should happen to become ill, fasting offers a quick way to recover. Fasting provides the following benefits: • Conserves energy • Causes colds and flus to vanish rapidly • Gives overburdened organs a chance to rest • Improves the intestines' ability to digest and assimilate • Facilitates the breakdown, absorption, and elimination of abnormal growths and obstructions in the body • Frees energy for creativity and mental focus • Helps a body accomplish, in just a few days, healing that might other- wise take weeks or never happen • Allows the organs of elimination to discharge accumulated material and inorganic chemicals • Can help one quickly let go of addictions • Allows for a restful time for the body to heal itself • Can help the body eliminate deep illness • Fine-tunes mental faculties • Creates a state of heightened awareness"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"276 Rati so me! Some people have a tradition of fasting at the seasonal equinoxes. Many like to begin a fast at the new moon, long associated with new begin- nings. A fast can be begun at any time, although there are certain logistical details to consider. Rest and relaxation are important during a fast, so it's important to schedule your fast for when you can take time away from the hustle of your ordinary life. If you have never fasted before, you may want to begin by simply skip- ping a meal. Then, try fasting one day a week or for thirty-six hours. Once you have grown accustomed to these shorter fasts and are ready for a three- day fast, start fasting on the last day of your work week, and then take the weekend to complete the fast. Hunger usually disappears by the third day. When your mouth tastes fresh and sweet and perspiration becomes fra- grant, you'll know that your body has cleansed itself. Note: Unless you are experienced with fasting, you should not under- take a fast of longer than three days without proper guidance from an experienced healthcare practitioner. While you are fasting, drink plenty of pure water. Sip, rather than gulp, to avoid swallowing air and causing gastrointestinal distress. If you become hungry, do five to ten minutes' worth of vigorous exercise, such as jumping jacks. In general, mild exercise, such as walking or working in the garden, is appropriate, but you should avoid exertion. When you bathe, the water temperature should be lukewarm; cold showers or baths can lower blood pressure and cause dizziness, and hot baths and showers can be weakening. Before bathing, encourage the elimination of toxins by dry-brushing your skin with a natural-fiber brush: start at the limbs and work inward from the feet and hands, making five to ten circular strokes in each area. When Not to Fast Fasting is not recommended in cases of hernia, paralysis, advanced cancer (especially of the liver), diabetes, hypoglycemia, tuberculosis, lead poisoning, advanced osteoporosis, inflammation, or wasting disease. Do not fast if you are emotionally distressed, overly cold or hot, more than 10 pounds underweight, pregnant, or nursing. Fasting is also not encouraged during very cold seasons because it diminishes body heat. Using Food (or Heating 277 While you are fasting from food, fast also from junk television, junk lit- erature, and using foul language. Clean your space, closets, and cupboards. By making these outer changes, you will be reminded of your inner cleans- ing. Allow fasting to be a tool for evolution, so that you return to your ordinary life a better person. Juices and Cleansing Beverages Although the water-only fast is considered the true and best method of fasting, you can also drink water flavored with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Fresh-pressed diluted juices, though not part of a true fast, can nour- ish, cleanse, and provide raw materials for healing. Consider diluted carrot, beet, celery, cucumber, watermelon, and wheatgrass juices. Coconut water is excellent for a fast, truly healing, and absolutely delicious. If you are fast- ing on juices, make sure they are freshly made and not pasteurized (as pas- teurized juices lack enzymes). The Master Cleanser Try drinking this beverage during a fast to facilitate cleansing of your body systems. (My gratitude goes to Stanley Burroughs, author of The Master Cleanser, and creator of this recipe.) 1 gallon water \\ cup lemon juice % teaspoon cayenne powder Maple syrup (not a raw product), raw honey, or soaked dates Combine all ingredients, using the maple syrup, honey, or soaked dates to sweeten.

Juice of 12 oranges Juice of 6 lemons Juice of 6 grapefruit Spring water Combine the citrus juices in a glass gallon jar. Fill the jar to the top with spring water. Drink a glass of this cleanser every hour or as desired. Breaking the Fast Break your fast with something easy to digest: a diluted juice or a light, refreshing organic fruit such as cantaloupe or pear. Continue eating only fruit for several meals. Then have a salad for a meal, and gradually progress back to eating a regular raw foods diet. FOOD COMBINING The philosophy of food combining, in which certain foods are said to com- plement or oppose each other in the digestive process, is based primarily on cooked food. When you are following a raw foods diet, which is bountiful in the enzymatic activity that aids digestion, proper food combining is not as critical. It does become critical, however, for people with poor assimila- tion, digestion problems, or low energy. If you are eating a completely raw diet and are still experiencing any of these health concerns, the food-com- bining guidelines below may be helpful. Mixing foods that require different digestive times and enzymes can cause food digestion to be difficult or slow. Starch digestion, for example, begins in the mouth and requires alkaline digestive secretion; but protein Using Food (or Heating 279 digestion begins in the stomach, where acid secretions such as hydrochlo- ric acid and pepsin are found. When mixed, the alkaline and acidic secre- tions neutralize each other, resulting in poor digestion of both starch and protein. Avoid drinking beverages simultaneously with meals to avoid diluting your digestive juices. Ideally, drink one half-hour before a meal or one and a half hours after. Fruits and vegetables are generally best not mixed. The exceptions to this rule are avocado (a fruit), which combines well with vegetables, and celery and iettuce, which combine well with fruit. Avoid combining acidic fruits such as grapefruit with sweet fruits such as raisins, because acidic and sweet fruits require different digestive times and secretions. People who find that fruit gives them gas can blame it on improper combining or the fact that the fruit is cleansing bacterial overgrowth from the digestive tract. It is best not to eat fruit for at least one to two hours after a meal. Fruit is digested quickly and can ferment if it's held up in the digestive process by other, more complex foods that are difficult to digest. When eating several fruits, save the sweetest fruits for last, as their higher concentration of sug- ars will facilitate the digestion of the less-sweet fruits. For optimal digestion, eat light foods before heavy foods, because the lighter foods (being more watery) will be digested more quickly. Eat fats and proteins at separate meals. Save raw desserts such as cakes, cookies, and puddings to be eaten at least an hour after a meal and only a couple of times a week. Some raw foodists eat only one food at a time, which is probably ideal for digestion. However, I love the fact that simply eating raw, even when I don't follow all the food-combining rules, has brought me and my family better health and excellent digestion."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"In Chapters 1 through 7, we examined the characteristics of a wide range of fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, and other components of a raw foods diet. Here you'll find explanations of the terminology that came up in those chapters, with discussions of the actions and benefits of particular nutri- tional compounds. The description of each compound is followed by a list of foods in which it can be found. If you wish to focus on a particular nutri- ent, be sure to eat adequate amounts of the foods that are listed with it. Of course, you must also be sure to eat a wide range of foods in order to meet your body's overall nutritional requirements. Choosing a varied diet of raw foods will enable you to build an optimal nutritional foundation without having to rely heavily on supplements. Carotenoids Carotenoids prevent vision problems, improve skin health, help repair the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts, enhance immunity, and help protect against pollution. There are many different kinds of carotenoids, from alpha to zeta. Monoterpene carotenoids, for example, in addition to having the above characteristics, are antioxidant and protect against cancer and heart disease.

Vitamin B 12 (Cyanocobalamin) Vitamin Bj2a or cobalamin, is probably considered the most controversial of vitamins. It is needed for digestion, nutrient assimilation, and protein synthesis. Vitamin B12 helps prevent anemia, aids folic acid in regulating the production of red blood cells, improves iron utilization, and promotes nor- mal growth and fertility. It also prevents nerve damage by helping to man- ufacture the protective fatty insulation that surrounds the nerves. A deficiency in vitamin B [2 can cause fatigue, nerve degeneration, clumsiness, depression, memory loss, and, in severe cases, death. Vitamin B j 2 is produced by bacteria, so the B12 we're able to consume through our diet is derived from the bacteria on the plants and animals we eat. We also have B^-producing bacteria living throughout our bodies, especially between the teeth and gums, on the tonsils and tongue, and in the nasal area and small intestines. To properly absorb Bj2, we must have a healthy pancreas and strong gastric secretions. Once absorbed, the vitamin is not stored in the blood but in the liver and other organs. There is conflicting information about the vitamin B12 content of dif- ferent foods (especially fermented foods) and how much our bodies require, and more research is needed. Generally speaking, however, eating small amounts of unwashed, organic fruits and vegetables provides all the B 12 we need. The most likely dietary sources of B 12 are listed below. Some raw fooders choose to supplement B [2 with a pill.
