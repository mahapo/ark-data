The very life & liberty of humanity requires the unmasking oftheir deceptions. That is what this book is about. Honesty is a necessaryingredient for any society to function successfully. Deception has become anational pastime, starting with our business and political leaders and cascadingdown to the grass roots. The deceptions of the Illuminati's mind-control may behidden, but in their wake they are leaving tidal waves of distrust that aredestroying America. While the CIA pretend to have our nation’s best interest atheart, anyone who has seriously studied the consequences of deception on asociety will tell you that deception will seriously damage any society until itcollapses. Lies seriously damage a community, because trust and honesty areessential to communication and productivity. Trust in some form is a foundationupon which humans build relationships. When trust is shattered humaninstitutions collapse. If a person distrusts the words of another person, hewill have difficulty also trusting that the person will treat him fairly, havehis best interests at heart, and refrain from harming him. With such fears, anatmosphere of death is created that will eventually work to destroy or wear downthe cooperation that people need. The millions of victims of total mind-controlare stripped of all trust, and they quietly spread their fears and distrust on asubconscious level throughout society. One problem about lies is that one liewill call for another and then another. It's hard to keep lies single. They seemto want to breed more of their kind to protect themselves. Soon the liar becomesa victim of his own lies, trapped in a dishonest web that demands lots of energyto protect his false fronts. This is the sad fate that the intelligence agencieshave painted themselves into. They must maintain groups that oversee theirdouble-agents' lies to insure that the lies that they have disseminated don'tcontradict themselves. Finally, they have put out so much disinformation, theylose track of reality themselves. Far from saving this nation, the intelligenceagencies have spread the cancer of deception into all walks of life, so thatthis cancer is contaminating and killing anything of value in the United States.The soon-to-come death of this nation's sovereignty, as well as the destructionof this nation's morals are the results of this cancer. People who have attendedhigh level Illuminati meetings were instructed in how the Illuminati plan tobring in the NWO Anti-Christ reign by making everything appear as if it hashappened naturally. The Illuminati have decided to camouflage their actions withthe creation of normalcy to avert any suspicions. An example of something whichappears to have happened naturally is the O.J. Simpson case, which was plannedbased on previous murder scenarios which had been successfully covered up. O.J.Simpson was a CIA mind-controlled slave, and the entire Simpson case wasconcocted as an elaborate effort to cause racial tensions. The Mishpucka, theCIA, the Mob and the Illuminati have all had their dirty hands involved in theentire affair. The entire affair reeks of manipulation and planning. It is notthe goal of this paragraph to go into the case, but just to drop a coupledetails. Joey Ippolito, Jr. is both CIA & Mob. Ippolito at one time lived inHallandale, FL, a mob housing subdivision which was protected by a police forcerun by the mob. He has helped run drugs and wet ops for \"the Combination\" whichinterconnects with the Illuminati. O.J. Simpson's friend Cowlings worked forJoey Ippolito, as well as O.J. Simpson. Simpson distributed cocaine for JoeyIppolito & the Combination. Simpson's lawyer also is tied to the Illuminati, theCIA, and the mob. One of his lawyers on TV said the trial reeked of governmentcorruption. Nicole Simpson lived next door to Carl Colby (former CIA directorBill Colby’s son). Colby's wife and kids have been subjected to mind-control.Colby's wife testified in O.J. Simpson's trial, but was addressed as \"Miss Boe\"rather than by her name. O.J. Simpson's mother worked for a California StateMental Hospital in San Francisco for 30 years. Many State Mental Hospitalworkers have children who have been programmed. When one of the jurors inSimpson's case, Tracy Hampton, had her mind-control programming go haywire, shebegan staring for long periods at a blank TV and hearing voices. She had to bedismissed. During the Simpson trial, Judge Ito gave Joe McGinniss the bestfront-row seat that a journalist could have. Joe McGinniss was the cover-upauthor who wrote a book covering up about the McDonald-Fort Bragg Drug SmugglingCase.The McDonald-Fort Bragg Drug Smuggling Case involved the Illuminati drugsmuggling operation within the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. On and onthe stink goes. The manipulation of history by those in power has beenwell-covered over. An example of how mind-control and its role in manipulationof events has been covered up by the perpetrators is an article written in theJournal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in the Sept. 11, 1967, Vol.201, No. 11 issue. The article, which was submitted to the magazine from threeCIA doctors (Mark, Sweet, and Ervin), claims that riots are caused by braindisease. While the article is correct in the sub point that only a smallpercentage of underprivileged urban dwellers participate in many of the riots,the article's thesis is obviously a slide to prevent people from catching onthat the small number of deviants who create riots might be under mind-controlor might have some other motivation beyond simply being brain-diseased. Anydeception, whether it is an exaggeration or an understatement of the NWO'scapabilities, is considered a useful deception for the Illuminati'sdouble-agents to spread. The German battleship the Bismarck was sunk due to alittle lie sent to Germany by a double-agent which underestimated the range ofBritish radar. The Germans, thinking they were out of British radar range, madesome bad decisions that cost them the battleship.Deception Diminishes PowerKnowledge is power, and lies diminish the knowledge of deceived dupes, andtherefore diminishes the power of the deceived. Deception obscures thealternatives that people have. It also clouds up various objectives people wouldwork toward. Some people give up certain objectives due to their misperceptionsthat the objective is undesirable or unattainable.Programming DeceptionsIn the programming, colors and directions are used. Be prepared to find out thatsometime programmers use their creative imaginations such as using the color\"octarine,\" or the direction \"TURNWISE\" or perhaps \"WIDDERSHINS\". During themost fundament programming which is done via LSD trips in sensory deprivationtank to lay in foundations of the Alpha, Beta, Delta, Ome and Theta programs,each programming memory will be given a code. Where one popular programmingdeception takes place that the programmer knows ahead of time h to sequence hismemory codes so that instance, the fifth memory is coded as trip, and strenuousmethods are used to up the memories of the first four trips the victim’s s mindwill be told to forget the four trips. The memory codes are deceptively designedto fool the deprogrammer and the victim alike. Part of the reason the programmerdoes this, is that they know that IF a therapist should stumble onto these firstmemories, the backup programming to protect these memories is so severe that thetherapist will shatter the victim’s mind. Backup programs such as Atom bombs andvegetable programming are locked into place to protect the fundamental programs.Be Wise as SerpentsThe Holy Spirit moved an apostle to write, \"We are not ignorant of Satan’sdevices.\" Christ warned his disciples to \"Be Wise As Serpents and harmless asdoves.\" The Israelites sent out spies before entering the Promised Land. Withinthe text of The Art of War by Sun-Tzu (a book studied today by men inintelligence), he discusses \"hidden provocation agents\" in Book 13. Sun-Tzu wasborn in 534 B.C. and lived most likely until after the year 453 B.C. In 500B.C., some men were farmers, and some were agent provocateurs. Today, bothoccupations still exist. The modern American farmer is vastly superior to theancient farmer of 500 B.C., so how does the modern agent provocateur compare? Heis vastly superior also. It appears the Word of God is accurate, for it warnsthat God’s people will be destroyed for lack of knowledge. The difficulty inobtaining honest information in today’s Big Brother world is aptly described byan intelligence asset over the Internet, \"If you are lucky and work hard, youwill find some of the truth. If you are lucky and work REALLY hard, you mightfind the WHOLE truth...as someone wants you to know it. If you are PHENOMENALLYlucky and really work your tail off, you might even go on to find the REALtruth. But no outsiders...and in fact, very few insiders ever ... EVER ... learnthe WHOLE REAL truth.\"This book and our two previous books on mind-control) are the result ofextremely hard work and numerous miracles of God, and what non-Christians wouldcall lots of luck\". The story behind the books is amazing. This book’s twoauthors have had to “swim upstream\" for years in search for the real truth. Onething is very clear to this author, during the last seven years of exposing theNWO almost every person who is believed to be a leader against the NWO has triedto impede the work this author has been doing. People need to be aware that theNew World Order created their own opposition long before some of us begansincerely trying to expose it. This author’s informed opinion is thatessentially all (about 98% of the people leading the opposition to the NWO aredouble agents), and no less than 50% of the therapists are double-agents. Inthis state, this author knows as a fact that 50% of the licensed therapistsworking with programmed DID patients are programmed DID (MPD) slaves themselves.Recently, one of the therapists in this area, who the False Memory \"Spin\"-Dromethe Illuminati took down, was a therapist who had also been on a local T.V. talkshow revealing that she was a multiple & a SRA victim.Disinformation to Make Their Double-Agents Look Good\"A Force\" was MI-6’s group that carried out deception. They would have theirdouble agents pass out CHICKEN FEED (which is what they call classifiedinformation that can be thrown out to the public) to establish theirdouble-agents’ credentials (BONA FIDES) as agents against the British. Today,there are numerous anti-NWO people who are actually double agents. They aredistributing chicken feed to make people think they are legitimate. By the way,it is interesting to note for those who realize how important carousels are toprogramming that MI-6 (HO in Vauxhall Cross, Eng., with a training ctr. at Ft.Monckton, near Gosport, So. Eng.) is nicknamed (actually its cryptonym),,Carousel\" by its daughter organization Mossad (officially aka CentralIntelligence Collection Agency).An example of a double-agent who is popular among Christians is an Illuminatiwitch named Gretchen Passantino, who tours around to Christian conferencesbelittling the idea of mind-control. Dr. Loreda Fox reports in The Spiritual andClinical Dimensions of MPD that 74% of women abused by SRA come from \"Christianhomes.\" The Christian churches are heavily infiltrated.Sleeper AgentsIn the Vol. 2 book a number of references were made to sleeper agents. The ideaof placing someone somewhere in society and letting them lead a normal life foryears without ever being used is designed to provide a legitimate smokescreenabout what they are all about. Mind-controlled slaves make excellent sleepers.The concept of making sleeper agents in not a secret. The CIA has publiclyadmitted that they tried to discover long-range sleeper agents in the Los Niñioschildren of Republican Spain who were the descendants of communist Spaniards whoreturned to Spain in the 1950’s. They also have admitted to having tried to weedout long range sleepers in the Trebizond Greeks who lived near the USSR inTurkey and returned in the 1950’s to Greece. As the CIA and KGB mirror-imagedeach other in their manufactured Hegelian Dialectic mock dual (which was veryreal for the \"little\" person) you can well imagine that the CIA sent sleeperagents against the KGB.NAMES of TYPES of DISINFORMATION AGENTSThe intelligence agencies have their own lingo for the types of disinformationagents they send against everyone else. So far, we have named only double &sleeper agents. Here are some of their disinformation agents:AGENT OF INFLUENCEThese agents can be unwitting, under mind-control, or ideologically motivated touse their positions of influence to sway the minds of others. Examples of Agentsof Influence are anchor men on T.V., journalists, labor leaders, TVcommentators, academics quoted by the media, & some politicians.Confusion AgentAn agent whose job is to produce confusion by disseminating confoundinginformation.Contract AgentThese are the rogue agents, such as the mob, who the CIA get to do particularjobs on contract. Their connections can be denied.Deep Cover AgentA sleeper agent (often a programmed multiple or person with mind-controlprogramming) who has been a long term sleeper agent.Disinformation AgentThis is a highly placed agent who passes disinformation to other governments.Notional AgentA fictitious non-existent \"agent\" which is created with a real-looking identityto mislead.Provocation AgentAn agent sent in to provoke and destabilize the target group to do foolishthings.Spoon-Feeder AgentSomeone who dribbles out legitimate information, this is often done to build upa person's credentials (bona fides). Lots of the people who are pretending toexpose the NWO are spoon-feeder agents who provide a little new information,tons of already known secrets, and sprinkle in a measure of disinformation foradded fun. Generally spoon-feeders increase their percentage of disinformationonce they gain respectability. There are very few people really exposinganything of consequence about the NWO. This author has endured the loss ofseveral of the really legitimate whistle blowers who were friends beingassassinated since he began writing exposes.What this means is that agents for groups that do mind-control may: have beensleepers for many years and look very legitimately innocent, they may give goodcorrect information to our side, they may say all the right things and try toget us motivated to do more than we would want, they may talk about otherfriends who are giving them information who do not even exist. It takesdiscernment to spot people who are not on our side. Unfortunately, suchdiscernment seems to be fundamentally lacking within the public at large. Forinstance, I have seen people choose obvious NWO agents over this author as asource of \"information\" (which is in reality disinformation). Most people havebought so much disinformation during their lifetime, perhaps it’s unrealistic toexpect them to purge out all the junk they’ve accepted. Just as people in theworld need to toss out their worldly thinking, people in the church need to tossout all the indoctrination they’ve gotten from the numerous kinds of harlotchurches. At the moment, the system is set up so that the perpetrators of themind-control are in control of the credentialing process, so that they canprovide their stooges/and agents with the best credentials. As the reader cansee, the roots of power behind the mind-control go deep.Tricking SuspectsOne trick (or variations of it) that has been used with suspects is to arrestthem, place the suspect in a situation where the police are in two groups--onegroup looks like police, the other group looks like the group the suspect hascome from. After the suspect arrives, the group pretending to be arrested groupmembers, overpowers the police contingent and escapes to another setting whereanother police group pretending to be even more of the suspect’s group ask himwho he is and to explain his credentials. Letting his guard down, the originalsuspect explains what he is all about, thereby giving them the information theyneeded in the first place. Variations of this script can be run. Englishintelligence calls this basic script CACKLEBLADDER because chicken blood is usedon the police actors that are overpowered to make them look injured.The Names Of Deception TricksFOUR FACES refers to pretexts used by agents to get interviews. DANGLE is thecraft word for luring a victim into a provocation. A dangle operation would bean operation to provoke a group or individual into a particular action. This wasdone with Elohim City and many other groups that the NWO is trying to set up aspatsies.Standard Deception DevicesAgents use BLEEP-BOXES to tap telephones and in other instances to makefree-of-cost telephone calls. A CABMAN is a device to remotely activate atelephone with a radio beam. It can be used without entering the building wherethe telephone is located.MasksThe use of masks in the occult world is ancient. For centuries, the gypsies haveused them for their hypnotic powers. Special healing masks for their people arekept secret and never shown to the public. Masks have a shock value &fascination value. Gypsy and other occult groups have special rituals to createthe masks, including using hair clippings from the person who will wear themask. Gypsy healing masks are destroyed after the patient gets well. Illuminatiprogramming masks may or may not be destroyed after their use. The Illuminati’smask-making abilities (according to deprogrammed victims of their mind-control)are very high quality. Sometimes the programmers simply wear Halloween cartooncharacter masks that anyone can obtain, to fulfill their role in the programmingscript that they are involved in during the time.CoversSome beginners who have just started into studying the World Order question whythe Illuminati would use legitimate religious covers. Why would the Illuminatiwant to create a slave who is an evangelist? Why? Because those new convertswill go to some establishment church where other programmed multiples inleadership positions will demand obedience (and then support those demands byquoting scriptures that make them seem like they are God’s authority over thatnew convert). Because the evangelist or missionary and the bishop or pastor arecontrolled puppets, the convert will never get the full truth, just enough truthto keep him working hard for their organization. Even though the convert \"gotGod in my life\", the Illuminati never lose control over him.The Christians have as much vested interest in preventing the exposure of theIlluminati programmed multiples who are big name Christian ministers runningChristendom, as the Illuminati has. Imagine what would happen if the world foundout that most of Christianity was run by the human-sacrificing, slave-makingIlluminati? This is one of the sad effects of the infiltration. Perhaps thesubject of covers can be explained from another angle. The reader knows that theelite like monopolies. They play monopoly for real--for us it’s only a boardgame! To establish a monopoly, you find a good product that everyone wants orneeds, and then you eliminate all the competition by either destroying them, orowning the competition yourself. In the U.S., the Illuminati can’t have aone-religion monopoly. In Russia, they had communism with Marx, and Lenin as theFather God and God the Son figure. Communism had a monopoly on worship. In theU.S., they have established a monopoly by controlling all the various religiousgroups. (This author wrote an 800 page heavily documented book Be Wise AsSerpents to show the details of how this is done.) It’s not a matter of whatthey teach, it’s a matter of control, so that the elite have a monopoly. Andwhen you, as a mover & shaker in the world, control all these various religionsvia money, blackmail, & programmed multiples under your leadership, etc. whichreligion would you pick to emphasize the most? You will pick the one that sellsthe best, i.e. the best product. And which brand of Christianity will sell thebest? The televised charismatic brand will sell the best. Covers that slaves useto explain what they do in life are almost always \"legitimate\". A missionary, amilitary officer, a salesperson, etc. will usually actually do their cover jobmost of the time. Their cover is their occupation, their service as amind-controlled slave is almost an unwitting avocation. Organizations are usedas covers. The Illuminati use military, social, intelligence, education, bankingand other organizations as covers. (See my Be Wise As Serpents book for many ofthese.) Moriah’s front organizations, such as the CIA, in turn use otherorganizations. Here is just a sampling of CIA fronts, to show the variety offronts used: * Asia Foundation was an academic organization created by the CIA. * Castle Bank & Trust Co. has been a bank in the Caribbean that is a CIA front. * Forum World Features has been a front created for CIA propaganda purposes and based in London, UK. * Geschicter Foundation for Medical Research (as well as the Josiah Macy Foundation) was used as an intelligence front to launder money used for mind-control. * Air-Sea Forwarders, Inc. was the legal corporation name of a CIA front in North Hollywood, CA. The company was involved in moving freight. In the last few years, this corporation sued E-Systems, the company which builds the CIA and the NWO’s electronic systems such as their communications satellites. In court, the company proved that it was a CIA front, in spite of CIA denials.As this chapter provides information about some of the Illuminati/ intelligenceconnections to Hollywood, bear in mind that this CIA front was proven in courtto be a CIA front in Hollywood. A feat that rarely occurs.One of the Greatest Deceptions of All Time: DisneyFor years, I have heard many Americans say that something is terribly wrong inthis country & that things are \"going to pot\", and yet Americans can’t put theirfinger on what exactly is wrong. When I first began to receive reports fromvictims of Illuminati mind-control about Disney’s involvement in theirmind-control, I kept an open ear, but I wanted some tangible proof. Afterinvestigating for myself, there is now no doubt in my mind that Disney (the man,the movies & the entertainment parks) has been a major contributor to the demiseof America, while maintaining a very well-constructed front of wholesomeness. Inthis chapter, you will learn why Disney is one of the best deceptions of theIlluminati. This author has read a good portion of what is available to thepublic concerning Disney. This exposé is undoubtedly the deepest on Disney thathas ever been done. Perhaps part of my motivation is that I’ve tired ofChristians talking and acting like Disney stands for sainthood. Christians, whoshould have known better, are some of the ones who have swallowed \"hook, lineand sinker\" the enormous deception that entails Disney. They feed their childrena steady diet of occultism and witchcraft because they have been programmed tothink of Disney as wholesomeness and everything that is good about America. Manywriters over the years have tried to expose Disney, most have been stoppedbefore they could get their books published. The few authors who have managedhave faced vicious attacks on their character & integrity, and have facedenormous struggles against public relations campaigns paid for by the Disneys.The Disney’s power, and the power behind them, has frightened most people awayfrom challenging them. But someone needs to speak on behalf of the victims.Whether anyone listens or not, the victims will know that somebody cared enoughto stand up & write the truth. Disney has not only left mind-control victims inits wake, but they have harassed land-owners, stolen employee idea’s and leftall kinds of hurting victims in their path. Disney has risen to become theunquestionable largest media-entertainment conglomerate in the world, and wasranked company no. 48 in the top 500 companies by Forbes 500.Observations about How The Illuminati Like to Hide Behind Perfect Fronts.There are numerous Illuminati homes, restaurants, wineries and otherinstitutions that are today carrying out the same type of strict standards upontheir employees that Walt Disney Studios maintained. While Hollywood wasimmersed in moral filth from the start, Walt Disney Studios had strictstandards. In the 1930’s, Disney had a dress code that required men in ties, andwomen in sober-colored skirts. If a man looked lecherously at a woman at WaltDisney Studios he risked being instantly fired. Walt was a shining example ofthe strictest legalism. Even during the ’50's, if an employee were caught sayinganything considered a cussword such as \"hell\" they were instantly fired nomatter who they were. Walt would not allow his male employees to have any facialhair, even though he himself sported a mustache. He never allowed employees tohave alcohol at the studios, (which might not be a noteworthy standard exceptthat Walt himself drank heavy amounts of alcohol in his private office at workfor decades). Initially, Walt was very reluctant to have his young artists, whowere being trained by Don Graham, draw live nude models, but reluctantly gaveapproval. Again the motive was not to serve God, but to make sure the Disneyreputation remained untarnished. With the power of the establishment mediabehind Disney, Walt had nothing to worry about, news about the nude drawingclasses and their detailed drawings never reached the light of day. Behind suchstrict fronts of legalistic morals, cleanliness & soberness, you will often findlots of guilt and high level satanic ritual. For instance, Hitler (who was bythe way also a failed artist & who liked mechanical things more than people)obsessively washed his hands many times a day (out of guilt), and so did WaltDisney. Walt obsessively washed his hands several times an hour, every hour.Walt liked animals & his trains more than people. This author has seen somealters who were forced to take another human’s life, and when they relived thememory, the alters, then tried to physically wash the blood guilt off of theirhands. Another example is that over the years this author has discovered thatmany of the exclusive restaurants that are meticulous in every detail are tiedin with the mind-control and criminal activities of the elite. Dirty money iskeeping the places looking sparkling clean.Walt Disney worked very hard at maintaining a great image for himself and hiscompany. An example of this, is how he exploded in rage and wrote an angry memowhen a Disney character was placed in a beer ad. (Memo mentioned in Thomas, Bob.Walt Disney An American Original. Hyperion, 1994, p. 7.) He had a personal imagebuilder, Joe Reddy, who worked full time to build Walt’s image. Joe Reddy was acigar-smoking Irishman who loved the catholic college Notre Dame’s footballteam. He also was a publicity agent for Shirley Temple. But the Disney deceptionentails far more than Joe Reddy’s decades of image making, and Walt’s ownabilities to create good images of himself. Just as with Billy Graham, theentire Illuminati threw their weight behind promoting Walt Disney. Ronald Reaganand Walt Disney were good friends and both cut from the same die in many ways.Both men were high ranking Freemasons, both came from socialist backgrounds(Ronald’s mother was Eleanor Roosevelt’s best friend, and Walt’s Dad was asocialist leader), both were paid FBI informants, and both were involved heavilyin the abuse of mind-controlled slaves. Walt always generously supportedReagan’s political campaigns, and in turn Reagan did political favors for Waltas Gov. of California. For instance, Disney’s Mineral King Mountain Resortneeded an access route through the Sequoia Nat. Park at a time when there waslots of congressional pressure to preserve the last stands of redwoods. Gov.Reagan got his friend Disney his road through the park.Reagan served as the emcee for the opening day of Disneyland on July 17, 1990.He returned with Illuminati TV host Art Linkletter for the 35th anniversary.Ronald Reagan & Art Linkletter both pumped Disney publicly. Another slave abuserthat spent time with Disney was Bob Hope, who would spend time on the golfcourse with Walt. On the opening day’s telecast, cameras showed Sammy Davis, Jr.(a member of the Church of Satan) and Frank Sinatra (a mind-control slavehandler) driving the pint-sized Disney ears at the Autopia ride. When Disneycelebrated its fifty-year anniversary with a two hour special on May 20, 1991,the program included people like occultist Bill Campbell and was named \"Best ofDisney, 50 Years of Magic.\" For the silver anniversary of Disney World in Oct.’96, the Clinton’s were invited to help open 15 months of celebrations. Thetheme of the anniversary celebrations was \"Remember the Magic\". A Boy’s andGirl’s Club sang “When you wish upon a star” (a popular programming song).Hillary Rodham Clinton (herself an Illuminati Grand Dame and a mind-controlprogrammer) shared with the audience that she and Bill \"first brought daughterChelsea to the Magic Kingdom when she was four.\" Roy E. Disney, nephew of Walt,told the public that Disney World \"is the story of men and women who took holdof a dream and never let go.\" There is a double meaning to that. Many victims oftrauma-based mind-control have taken hold of the illusions that were programmedinto their mind secretly at Disney, and never let go. Among the visitors toDisneyland have been all the American Presidents from Eisenhower to Clinton,over a dozen kings and queens, as well as Emperor Akihito of Japan, Anwar Sadat,and Robert Kennedy (who rode the Matterhorn with astronaut John Glenn.) BothDenmark’s & Belgium’s kings who are in the Illuminati visited, as well as thedictators of Indonesia, the Shah of Iran and Ceausescu of Romania. (As aside-note Roy E. Disney was forewarned by Arab leader that the Shah was to bedeposed.) Organizations that have been actively working for a New World Orderfor many years gave big awards to Walt in his early years such as the B’naiB’rith (Man of the Year Award to Walt) and the Chamber of Commerce. In 1936,Walt was given the Chamber of Commerce’s annual “Outstanding Young Man\" award.The establishment’s Yale & Harvard Universities gave him honorary degrees. WaltDisney biographer Leonard Mosley, who researched Walt Disney for years (as wellas writing books on the duPonts, the Dulles brothers, and Hirohito) wrote in hisbook on Walt Disney, \"The studio publicity machines in the film colony had, asusual, gone out of their way to try to persuade me, as a writer for a powerfullyinfluential British newspaper, that this was a city of lawless gods andgoddesses, full of clean-living, sanitized stars.“It was even more of a deodorized world at the Walt Disney Studio where thepublicity men insisted their boss was faultless--never drank too much, neverused a swearword, never lost his temper, never quarreled with his wife orfamily, never let down a friend. And woe betide anyone who tried to suggestotherwise. Members of the resident foreign and local press risked their jobs ifthey dared to write stories inferring that Walt Disney could be domineering,implacable, and unforgiving (as was the case, for instance, before, during, andafter the 1941 studio strike). The Disney flacks were capable of exerting heavypressure on editors and proprietors or, through the advertising pages, againstanyone who inferred Walt Disney was not the epitome of well-scrubbed andbenevolent perfection.\" Mosley, Leonard. Disney’s World. New York: Stein & Day,p. 10.Disney is perhaps the epitome of Illuminati abilities to create images. Theyhave created great images for things Disney, incl. Walt Disney, Disney movies,and Disney’s Amusement parks. In some cases these things have been overrated, inother instances the sinister side to them has been carefully hidden. In order tomake movies that contain the typical smut of Hollywood, sex and violence, Disneydid a slight of hand and created subsidiaries which Disney runs, which hasallowed them to keep their good image. They also never showed the public thehard core porn that was made for years in secrecy for the elite. Behind Disney’sgood front lies hard porn, snuff films, white slavery, Illuminati mind-control,and the seduction of several generations into witchcraft. Disney’s involvementin these kinds of things will be explained in this chapter. Nobody has soldAmerica witchcraft as well as the Disney brothers. Movie after movie hascleverly brought the occult into the warp & woof of American thought, all underthe disguise of entertainment. For instance, it was Disney that brought uscannibalism and told us that it was a \"triumph of the human spirit\" (a directquote from Disney’s Touchtone Producer Robert Watts concerning Disney’s movie\"Alive\" featuring survivors of an airplane crash who turned to cannibalism).Under the disguise of entertainment & showing us how \"triumphant\" the humanspirit was, they subtly promoted cannibalism. Mickey Mouse plays a leading rolein \"The Sorcerer’s Apprentice.\" And yet when this author has suggested thatDisney movies aren’t wholesome, many Christian parents come unglued and havegotten angry with this author. The deceptive image that Disney movies arewholesome is a triumph in Illuminati deception. Parents would be surprised whatis slipped into cartoons. In Disney’s \"The Little Mermaid\" the castles are malesexual organs. In one cartoon Mighty Mouse is shown without comment clearlysnorting cocaine. Walt Disney Studios Chairman Joe Roth is in charge of WaltDisney as well as subsidiaries Touchtone, Miramax, and Hollywood Pictures, whichwere all created to camouflage the Disney production of adult films. Disneyoperates in a clandestine manner regarding the promotion, distribution andrating of the films produced by their subsidiaries.Disney Makes Male Phalluses Into Castles.Roth oversaw Disney’s subsidiary Hollywood Pictures’ Evita film. Evita has asits main start \"Material Girl\" Madonna. Madonna is in reality a mind-controlledslave who has appeared in numerous underground porn/& ritual porn movies. (Thisauthor has an underground catalog from a porn business, that has recentlychanged its location of business. The catalog offered a film of Madonnaperforming an actual blood sacrifice.) She also was the main actress in Disney’sDick Tracy film which is reported to be used for mind-control. During an ArsenioHall show, Madonna, who as a guest acted dissociative, was picked up by thecameras during the show kissing her Baphomet ring. Disney controls the productsthat are associated with the movies of their subsidiaries. In Evita’s case theyare marketing hats and other items, as just one more of Disney’s countlessartificially generated consumerism campaigns. In Ruth Stein’s interview ofMadonna, Madonna appeared bored with plugging Disney’s consumer products. Whenasked about the tango dresses and hats inspired by Evita that popped up instores after the film, Madonna said, \"Believe me, I have nothing to do with it.Disney is pushing the whole thing.\" (San Francisco Chronicle, 12/29/96, Datebooksection). In one interview Madonna states she wants her daughter to grow upknowing Catholicism, but she doesn’t believe that it would be good for herdaughter if Madonna married the father of her child from Lourdes, Carlos Leon.In another interview, Madonna says, \"Actually, I’m a very good role model,because I say, ‘Look, these are my standards’...\" She then goes on to plughomosexuality, same sex marriage, and single families in the interview. WaltDisney stated that it plans to release an album by DANZIG, a heavy metal bandwhose songs contain \"dark themes\". The Disney press release announces on itsby-line \"Mickey Mouse is going heavy metal.\" Disney’s album Black Acid Devil wasdue to hit the music stores Oct. 30, 1996 during Halloween time. According toDisney this music has no satanic references, but does have \"dark, Gothic andsexual\" overtones. Glenn Danzig denies that he is a Satanist.Contents in the Disney DeceptionSection of Chapter 5. 1. an introduction 2. an overview 3. Who was Walt Disney? 4. Who was Roy O. Disney? 5. Who is Roy E.

Detailed Script of how one Disney movie is used for programming. 12. Partial List of SourcesB. An OverviewDisneyland and Disneyworld are world famous and the pride of America. They arealso extremely important programming centers for the Illuminati to create totalmind-controlled slaves. Disneyland is also involved with providing a place forrituals, porn and other satanic activities. In terms of deception, Disney moviesand Disney Amusement Parks rate as one of the best deceptions. According todeprogrammed ex-Illuminati slaves, the Illuminati in the 1960’s needed to shifttheir programming away from the military bases, because too much publicity(heat) was shined on the military bases. Their goal was to have someplace thatpeople from all over the world could come to without raising any suspicions, anda place which would be the perfect cover for many of their criminal activities.According to a witness, the Illuminati Programmers got a big laugh out of usingDisneyland as a major Illuminati base for criminal activity. Under the disguiseof entertaining the world, they carried out money laundering, child slaverylaundering, and mind-control. They nick-named Disneyland \"the little syndicateof mind-control.\" When a child of 3 or 4 was kidnapped, they could torture thechild and then put him on a ride such as a Ferris wheel or carousel that a.created dissociation from the pain, while also b. going along with some fairytale programming script. An abducted child while waiting to be picked up fromone Illuminati non-parent caretaker by another, could be kept happy anddistracted while waiting for the pickup. For years, Disneyland was an Illuminaticenter for many of their world-wide activities. Now Disney has created othersites around the world such as Euro Disneyland 20 miles east of Paris and TokyoDisneyland. Tokyo Disneyland in 1991 had 16 million people attend. With suchhuge crowds, it doesn’t take much imagination how the Illuminati have been ableto do sneaky criminal activities right in front of people, and the public neversees it, in the middle of all the activity. Euro Disney has been a money losingaffair, but the Saudis who benefit from its mind-control, gave Disney the moneyto keep it financially in business. Walt Disney Records is the largestchildren’s record label in the world. Disney through their movies, books, toys,records, etc. has made a tremendous impact on the children of the world. Theirmovie Return from Witches Mountain was one of the most powerful witchcraftpromotions ever made. Ducktails, which has deliberate Monarch mind-controltriggers written into the script, is also broadcast in Poland and the formerUSSR.From the time of the Roman Empire (at least, if not before) the oligarchicalleadership, who have been in control of both the Mystery Religions and Europeanaristocracy, have known about “Bread Circus.” Bread and Circus refers to theconcept that IF the masses of people are given entertainment and food staples,THEN they are easy to control. Walt Disney movies have played a key role inproviding entertainment for the masses to insure Illuminati control. WaltDisney’s friend the Masonic prophet H.G. Wells in his book A Modem Utopia thatthere would be lots of shows in the New World Order. The World Future Society ina book review in their publication Future Survey Annual, 1993, (ed. MichaelMarien, Bethesda, MD: World Future Soc., p. 91) describes Disney:\"Control of commodities [such as entertainment] and access to commoditiestranslates into control over people. ‘The postmodern US is a massive rush ofdisconnected commodities, each seeking a10 moment of our attention.\" The worldof commodities is our soma, and entertainment is the current form of publicdiscourse. Walt Disney World, spread over 27,400 acres of central Florida swampand scrub forest, ‘is the most ideologically important piece of land in theU.S.’ What goes on here is the quintessence of the American way. It is visitedby over 30 million people a year--not only the major middle-class pilgrimagecenter in the US, but by far the most important entertainment center in theworld. It is clearly Oz, utopia as a marketing device.\"Two Disney brothers Walt (Walter Elias) and Roy O. Disney have been at thecenter of the creation of amusement parks and popular Disney films. In morerecent times, two other men, Eisner and Katzenberg have been notable at Disney.Eisner & Katzenberg, as well as others will be discussed later. One of Disney’sdirectors, Victor Salva, was convicted of molesting a boy and filming one of thesexual molestations. Recently Disney Director Salva produced the Disney movie\"Powder\". (Victor Salva’s sexual molestation conviction was covered by newspaperarticles such as Robert W. Welkos of the LA Times, in newspapers such as TheOregonian, Weds. Oct. 25, 1995, A sect.) The impact of the Disney brothers ismonumental. Mickey Mouse tee-shirts can be seen being worn by natives all overthe world. Disney World and Disneyland are the quest for a large segment ofhumanity, who often esteems these amusement parks as the highlight of theirlife. What is highly esteemed among men, is an abomination to God according tothe Word of God. The Bible arbitrarily makes this claim, but sadly, research bythis author over the years proves that a close examination of Disney & mankind’sesteem for \"Disney\" things does vindicate the Biblical expectation. In otherwords, as readers of this article will find out, behind the appearance ofwholesomeness of the Disney brothers and their creations lays abominations--some of the most grotesque aspects of generational occultism the world has everseen. Disney’s Magic Kingdom has become an American Institution that impactspeople all over the world from the cradle to the grave.C. Who Was Walt Disney? In the large book The Art of Walt Disney from Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdomby Christopher Finch (N.Y.: Harry N. Abrams, 1975) on page 11 an interesting andrevealing statement is made:\"By definition, public figures are known to everyone; yet, even after talkingwith some of Disney's closest associates, it is impossible to escape theconclusion that nobody really knew him. Always there was some aspect of hispersonality that was just out of reach.\"Those who got to know Walt too closely make complaints such as he was\"self-satisfied, intractable, and arrogant.\" He could bring his artists to tearsor anger in a matter of seconds. Finch is not the only author who has tried towarn his readers that the public’s image of Walt Disney was just that--only afalse image. Mosley also writes in his biography of Walt Disney:\"Since Disney is regarded by millions of people, particularly in the UnitedStates, as perhaps this century’s most brilliantly successful creator of screenanimation, I think I should make one thing clear right away. I share the generaladmiration of a man whose cinematic achievements were always so happily inspiredand inspiriting. But--and this is where I differ from uncritical idolaters--Ihave to know all the facts, no matter how unpalatable, as well as the romanticmyths about any great man or woman I admire. Many of the myths that have beencreated by his publicists about Walt Disney are unpalatable, unbelievable, andunsatisfactory because so much of the real Walt Disney has been deliberatelyconcealed.. .Walt Disney...had grave flaws in his character.\" Mosley. Disney’sWorld, pg. 9Years ago, an Illuminati Grand Master and programmer stated,\"If the world only had the eyes to see the fibers which lay under the surface ofWalt Disney’s image, they’d tar and feather him, and drag him through thestreets. If only they knew what Disney’s primary goal s.\"Personal DetailsWalt had black hair with a black mustache, and bright quick eyes and was about6’ tall. He used his own facial features to clue artists on how to draw MickeyMouse’s features. He liked specially rolled brown cigarettes which he smoked upto 70 a day. He picked up the smoking habit in the army. He loved expensiveScotch Whiskey, red sunsets, and horses. He had a vacation home in Palm Springs,CA called the Smoke Tree Ranch. He often wore the Ranch’s letter STR emblazonedon his necktie. He played lots of golf with Bob Hope and Ed Sullivan at the STRanch. His main home was an estate in Holmby Hills. The Holmby Hills estate waslocated in a plush area where lots of rich show-business families lived. It waslocated between Bel-Air (an occult word for Satan) & Beverly Hills.Walt spent many of his nights at the Disney Studios and later he had his ownprivate quarters at the center of Disneyland. He had reoccurring bouts ofinsomnia. (For his nerves and insomnia he’d take alcohol and tranquilizers.)He’d go weeks on end without stepping foot on the Holmby Hills estate and seeinghis family.The main topic at the studio by the staff during different time periods wasWalt’s bizarre behavior-- he would not be available until late afternoon, whenhe would emerge from the studio’s subterranean maze of tunnels, where supposedlyhe was \"chatting with the maintenance engineers\" every day. The value of hisestate when he died was 35 million dollars of which Lillian his wife inheritedhalf. In his later years, when Disney took a vacation he went to Paris for threeweeks, and three weeks at the Hotel du Cap, in Antibes, and then cruised onFritz Loew’s yacht with Ron and Diane Disney. In England, Walt spent time withthe British Royal family and met privately with masonic prophet H.G. Wells. InRome, Walt visited privately with the Pope and the dictator Mussolini. In 1966,Walt Disney died. Prior to his death he had investigated cryogenesis--beingfrozen, and it is believed by some that his body is frozen somewhere inCalifornia, while others claim he was cremated.Mickey MouseAccording to one source, the inspiration for Walt to create Mickey Mouse camewhen he was unemployed and saw a mouse in the gutter. There are quite a fewstories in circulation as to where the idea came from. Ub Iwerks claimed hethought Mickey up at an animator’s meeting in Hollywood. Walt once said, \"Thereis a lot of the Mouse in me.\" (biographical article written by Elting E.Morison, p. 131) In fact, Ub Iwerks told Walt that Mickey Mouse \"looks exactlylike you--same nose, same face, same whiskers, same gestures and expressions.All he needs now is your voice.\" Walt often did serve as Mickey’s voice. A bookput out by Walt Disney Co. in 1988 reveals that Walt Disney told Ward Kimball\"Quite frankly, I prefer animals to people.\" Walt usually was the voice behindMickey Mouse, (even though he wasn’t the artist.) His mother was chilly foryears about the work Walt did. Around 1940, after much pleading, he finally gother to watch Mickey Mouse. His unsupportive mother (which he would within a fewyears learn was not actually his biological mother) told him she didn’t likeMickey Mouse’s voice, to which he told her it was his, and then she responded bysaying he had a horrible voice. The \"cold towel\" she threw on Mickey Mousehelped convince Walt to quit making Mickey Mouse cartoons. Very few came out ofDisney after that, and the very next Mickey Mouse full-length feature cartoon,Fantasia, had Mickey mostly silent.Walt’s idea for The Sorcerer’s Apprentice was based on some of his own ideas.Walt had had the dream which was used for Mickey Mouse in The Sorcerer’sApprentice of having \"complete control of the earth and the elements.\"Disneyland and Disneyworld were partial fulfillments of that dream for control.Walt’s final pet project just prior to his death was the meticulously restoredversion of the witchcraft film Bedknobs and Broomsticks. (Disney Magazine,Winter 96-97, pub. by Disney, p. 96 mentions this.) As a programming device,Mickey Mouse works well because it plays on the subconscious geneticallytransmitted fear of mice that women have. Mickey’s image can help create alove-hate relationship, which is so valued during the traumatization &programming of mind-controlled slaves.Some sources state that Walt’s love for animals came from the time his familyhad a farm near Marceline, Missouri. Walt began his schooling at Marceline, butcontinued it after the age of eight at Benton School in Kansas City, MO. Walt’sDad had a serious gambling problem and passed the spirit of gambling to his sonWalt. Walt never graduated from high school. He had a natural love and a flairfor art work, although (contrary to his public image) he never became proficientat it. He joined the army in W.W. I as an ambulance driver by lying about hisage. During the war, he also chauffeured dignitaries. He also did some otherthings that are very revealing. He enjoyed drinking & gambling while in theservice, and he ran a scam where he doctored German artifacts picked up on thebattlefield to sell to people. War relics were tampered with to get them inshape to get the most money from them possible. Walt took the battle souvenirs -and dressed them up, for instance, coating the insides of helmets with grease,hair and blood and putting holes in them to make them into expensive souvenirs.This shows that Walt was willing to build illusions if it paid. He could bedeceptive if he saw an advantage to it. From gleanings from things Walt said topeople, it appears that as a child, he’d seen the darker side of life (forinstance, his father had a habit of beating him in the basement) and had hadsome interest or exposure to magic as a child. Bob Thomas writes, \"Walt took aboyish delight in playing tricks on his parents. He was fascinated with magictricks...\" (Walt Disney, An American Original, p. 35.)After the military, Walt hoped to have a career as an artist. He applied to theadvertising agency of Pesman-Rubin. Roy, his brother, claimed that Pesman-Rubinhired Walt as a personal favor to Roy who handled the agency’s account at thebank Roy worked at. Walter lasted a month until the advertising agency let himgo due to Walt’s \"singular lack of drawing ability.\" According to CurrentBiography 1952, in 1923, Walt and Roy had together $290. They borrowed $500 fromanother Disney, one of their uncles named Robert Disney and began to try to makecartoons. Robert Disney had retired in the L.A. area in Edendale, CA after asuccessful mining career. Robert had always been close to Walt’s father Elias,and helped Walt and Roy out when they came to California. Walt loved to studyCharlie Chaplin (a member of the Collins family). He scrawled notes about hisbody language, facial features, and his gag methods. He also read everything hecould about animation and cartooning. They worked out of their uncle’s garage inHollywood, CA. They were finally able to make a good cartoon Steamboat Willie in1928, which became an instant hit. As with many things in life, the cartoon wasnot only good, but Walt finally had the right ‘connections.\" On Nov. 18, ’28,Steamboat Willie was shown in a small, independent theater without any advancepromotion or advertising. But amazingly(!) the New York Times, Variety, andExhibitor’s Herald all ran rave reviews of the cartoon the next day. Was this anaccident? did journalists from all these prestigious periodicals just happen togo to this tiny independent theater? No, it was connections. The reason theelite decided to promote Walt Disney after Steamboat Willie came out asHollywood’s newest \"boy wonder\" was to deflect enormous bitterness that had beengenerated by the Stock Market collapse toward Jewish financiers. Hollywood, evenin its first two decades, was known as \"Babylon\" and \"Sin City\". The movieindustry was well-known to be run by Jews, and many people blamed the StockMarket Crash on the moral degradation that Hollywood had introduced to thisnation. There were calls for government regulatory groups to stop the smuttyHollywood films. Edgar Magnin, the spiritual leader of the major movie makerswho were part of the Los Angeles B’nai B’rith reportedly encouraged those in theMishpucka and others who were B’nai B’rith movie makers that Hollywood needed toprotect itself by putting Walt Disney in the limelight as a Christian \"whiteknight with family values\". (By the way, Edgar Magnin was nicknamed \"Rabbi tothe Stars\", because he was \"the Hollywood rabbi\".) E. Magnin’s grandfather’sdepartment store chain was one of the first major accounts of the Bank of Italy,and Edgar Magnin had continued his family’s close association with the Bank ofItaly. The closeness also came from the Bank of Italy’s close ties to the B’naiB’rith and ADL. In 1930, the movie industry made a production code which statedthat the industry must make a special effort to make movies appropriate forchildren. Hollywood directly praised Disney in that code as an exemplary modelof what the movie industry wanted to do. With the power of the B’nai B’rith andADL behind him, Walt began sailing to fame. Movie studios that had been turningout smut, with lots of sex and violence all jumped on the bandwagon to showWalt’s clean wholesome cartoons. Walt was the facelift Hollywood needed afterthe Depression caused Americans to think about America’s morals. Many of theregular movie makers were so corrupt they were out of touch with moral issues,but Walt Disney knew black fromwhite. The Jewish movie makers \"pushed the man [Walt] they considered their besthope to the front of the pack\" who was billed as a fundamentalist Christian(albeit a masonic \"Christian\" who rarely stepped foot in a church). (quote fromWalt Disney Hollywood’s Prince of Darkness, p. 50.) Strangely, the biographiesindicate that Walt quit doing the actual drawing in 1927, and Walt devotedhimself entirely to the development of the cartoon business, such as raisingmoney. In other words, the image of Walt Disney being the artist who has createdthe Disney cartoon’s is inaccurate. The Disney brothers actually hired manyother artists to do the art work. If Walt quit drawing in 1927, and their firstmarketable cartoon was in 1928, that clearly shows that Walt did not do theactual cartooning. He continued to oversee the work, walking in and rigidlyinspecting what was being done to suit his own intuitive tastes. Actually thegenius cartoon artist (animator) who made Walt Disney a success was Ub Iwerks,about whom Walt on a number of occasions said was \"the best animator in theworld\". Without Ub Iwerks to take Walt’s ideas and turn them into reality, Waltwould never have become famous. Ub was an incredible genius who had a sense ofline, a sense of humor, patience, organization and a great sense of what Waltwanted. Walt treated him cruelly at times, interrupting him, playing tricks onhim, and not being totally honest with paying him, but he stayed with Walt overthe years and made Walt the success Walt became. (The books Disney’s World andDisney Animation: The Illusion of Life have information on the unheralded geniusUb Iwerks.) Another unknown great artist was Floyd Gottfredson. FloydGottfredson drew all the Mickey Mouse cartoons from 1932 until October,1975--which is a period of 45 1/2 years. Floyd Gottfredson was a Mormon born ina railway station in 1905, and raised in a tiny Mormon town, Siggurd, 180 milesso. of Salt Lake City. In 1931, before Floyd totally took over the Mickey Mousedrawings, he would take suggestions from Walt on what to draw. For instance,Walt puzzled him by insisting he do a cartoon series of Mickey Mouse committingsuicide. Floyd had said, \"Walt, You’re kidding!\" But Walt thought that a serieson suicide would be funny. Over the years the Walt Disney products nevermentioned Floyd’s name. The bulk of the fans were led to believe Walt did thecartooning of Mickey Mouse himself. (See the book Walt Disney’s Mickey Mouse inColor. Ed. Bruce Hamilton, pub. The Walt Disney Co., 1988.)Fred Moore was involved in the creation of Pluto and some other cartooncharacters. The idea for Pluto was Walt’s and it was Norm Ferguson’s genius atdrawing that took the idea and created the actual images. Walt Disney wasawarded 32 personal academy awards for the work that was done by his studios.Walt Disney’s famous signature was actually designed by someone else, and wastaught to Walt. (Schickel, Richard. The Disney Version: The Life, Time, Art andCommerce of Walt Disney. NY, 1968, p. 34.) Walt could only make a crude Disneysignature, so he delegated the writing of the signature to several artistsincluding Bob Moore, Disney’s publicity artist. Later, after much practice helearned to make it well enough to do for publicity. Many people who wroteletters asking for his actual signature, and who actually did his signature,thought that they had received forgeries by his staff, because the famous Disneysignature was so crude. The nicer looking ones were the forgeries. One cartoonanimator who joined Disney in 1940 recalled that Walt told him the first day,\"You’re new here, and I want you to understand just one thing. What we’reselling here is the name Walt Disney. If you can swallow that and alwaysremember it, you’ll be happy here. But if you’ve got any ideas about seeing thename Ken Anderson [his name] up there, its best for you to leave right away.\"Occult Porn KingWalt grew up fascinated with the occult and in an abusive home situation. He wasfascinated with cartoons, nature and children. He had an intuitive sense forquality cartoons that would appeal to children. At some point, the syndicate gothim indebted to them. At that point he was their man. He owed them a debt thatthey held over him. In secret, Walt became a porn king. A victim remembers thathe was sadistic and enjoyed snuff porn films. His interest in children was farfrom altruistic.The Hapsburgs of the 13th Illuminati bloodline had a sex salon in Vienna, wherea porn photographer named Felix Salten worked. Felix Salten wrote a book Bambi,which was then translated into English by the infamous communist WhittakerChambers. The elite were just beginning to form the roots for today’senvironmental movement. The book appealed to Disney, because Disney likedanimals better than people. In the book, tame animals view humans as gods, whilethe wild and free animals see humans as demons who they simply called \"Him.\" Thebook begins with both free and tame animal viewing humans as rightly havingdominion over them. In the end, the animals view all humans as simply being onthe same level as animals, a vicious animal only fit to be killed.Disney instructed his animators to make the animals \"to be human. I want peopleto forget they are watching animals.\" Bambi was to receive a Christ-like mangerbirth, with the animals hailing him as a \"prince.\" Due to his sexual problems,Walt at one point permitted himself to be subjected to the packing of hisgenitals in ice for hours at a time. (Elliot, Walt Disney Hollywood’s DarkPrince, p.83.) Children were instructed to call Walt \"Uncle Walt.\" An example ofthis were the Mouseketeers. For those who know how mind-control programmers havetraditionally liked to be called \"uncle\" by their child victims, the insistenceby Walt to be known as \"uncle\" is distasteful. From what this author has learnedfrom some sources about Walt’s non-public life as a hidden sadistic porn king,it raises questions about other parts of his life. For instance, Kenneth Angerin his book Hollywood Babylon II, p. 192, \"Some animators stated that the boss[Walt Disney] seemed to have fallen in love with the boy. There may be sometruth in this...\" The boy, who Walt fell in love with, was a small youngattractive boy actor named Bobby Driscoll who signed up in 1946 with Disney. Heacted in Song of the South, Treasure Island and Bobby’s voice was used in PeterPan. Bobby Driscoll was very intelligent and attractive. Did Disney help orabuse him? If Disney was such an up-building. wholesome atmosphere, and thischild actor had everything going for him, why did Bobby become a methamphetamineaddict at 17 and die within just a few years? Why didn’t his talent and earlycareer lead to something positive in his life?From those who knew Walt personally one learns that he had an obsession with thebuttock part of anatomy. He enjoyed jokes about this part of the anatomy, whichhe told to his staff quite frequently. The staff edited out many of his crudeposterior jokes from cartoon scripts. Two examples that got by the editors are aChristmas special where a little boy is unable to button the drop seat of hispajamas. The little boy’s problem in maintaining his modesty is the running gagof the cartoon. In the end, Santa gives him a chamber pot. The second example isthe paddling machine used on the wolf in The Three Little Pigs. Numerous Disneycartoons feature buttocks of characters provocatively twitching.As A Witness Before CongressAfter W.W. II, Walt Disney was called upon by Hollywood to testify in theirdefense at the Un-American hearings which were being carried out by congressmenwho were concerned about the heavy communist influence within Hollywood. Waltdownplayed any communist influence in Hollywood to Congress. Interestingly,Walt’s father was an outspoken Socialist Party leader in the United States whoadvocated a socialist New World Order. He regularly voted for socialistpresidential candidate Eugene Debs. One of the first drawings Walt did as a boywas to duplicate the socialist political cartoons he found in a socialistperiodical Appeal to Reason that his father subscribed to. When Walt asked inthe 1930’s how his father felt about socialism’s successes, his father Eliassaid, \"Today, everything I fought for in those early days has been absorbed intothe platforms of both the major parties. Now I feel pretty good about that.\"(Thomas, Bob. Walt Disney, An American Original, pg. 147-148) Walt’s movieAlice’s Egg Plant (1925) was pure communist doctrine where the red hen(communist) leads the working chickens on a strike against Julius the farmmanager (representing capitalists.) The strike at Disney and unionization ofDisney in 1940, soured Walt toward communism. The workers at Disney publiclymade personal verbal attacks on Walt & he never forgave the humiliation. Inspite of his public distaste for communism, his Magic Empire (his castle wherehe was king) was run like a socialist dictatorship, similar to what the NWOplans. Employees at Disney did not have titles; it was faceless egalitarianismwith an all-powerful dictator Disney at the top. It was racially elitist too.The only full-time African-American during Walt’s lifetime at Disney was a blackshoe shine man. Was Walt a socialist of the National Socialist (Nazi) variety?Arthur Babbitt claims, \"On more than one occasion I observed Walt Disney andGunther Lessing there [at Nazi meetings], along with a lot of other prominentNazi-afflicted Hollywood personalities. Disney was going to meetings all thetime.\" Lessing was mobster Willie Bioff’s crony. Bioff had spent his earlierdays running a whorehouse, before coming to Hollywood for the mob. In the finalpanel of the Mickey Mouse comic strip of 6/19/40 a swastika appeared. Somepeople have wondered what this and other \"secret signals\" in Disney’s workmeant. Disney was not Illuminati. The powerful elite are very skilled atcontrolling people that rub shoulders with them, those who are beginning tobecome independently wealthy. For instance, they destroyed Robert Morris, thegreat financier of the American Revolution. They simply used Hegelian Dialecticson Walt Disney. Their Unions and the Mob made Disney’s studio one of their primetargets. In order for Walt to protect himself from the unions, which heperceived as communist, Walt got help from the FBI and the mob. Walt wasvulnerable to the unions, because he treated his workers terrible, with longhours, low pay, in addition to repeated abuses to their dignity. Walt’s largenumber of employees essentially never received any credit or recognition fortheir years of creativity and hard work, which was all essentially stolen andcredited to Walt by the establishment to build his image. (I write\"essentially\", because someone might find some obscure exception, but across theboard, Walt got all the credit for what his creative workers produced.) PerhapsWalt needed the ego boost from all the purloined public praise which he stolefrom his staff to be seen as a great animator, because he had wanted to be anartist/cartoonist and failed. The praise helped sooth the wounds.One worker recalls that Walt \"had no knowledge of draftsmanship, no knowledge ofmusic, no knowledge of literature, no knowledge of anything really, except hewas a great editor.\" This may not be much of an exaggeration, because Walt was ahigh school drop-out, who grew up in poverty on a Missouri farm.Walt’s first official attempt to direct a film (and last) was the film TheGolden Touch in 1935. The film was an embarrassment. Walt had to pull it fromdistribution. If Walt lacked abilities to animate, and direct, what was Walt’stalent? Walt was the driving force, the spirit so-to-speak behind Disney. He wasthe dictator who was feared enough to demand more from his workers than theyknew they could give--and he could get it. He was the driving force that took amob of artists, and gag creators, etc. and shaped them into a powerful force tomake cartoons and later movies. He was the hard-driving genius who knew what hewanted and got others to create it for him. He was the driving force that keptan army of costumed sanitation men meticulously cleaning Disneyland. In normalyear, Walt would have 800,000 plants replaced at Disneyland, & Walt refused toput up signs asking the \"guests\" (visitors) not to trample them. How powerfulwas Walt? Here is a man who during his lifetime and even up into the 1990’s hada rule in the studio & Disneyland that no male employees could have any facialhair, yet he himself wore a mustache for most of his life.A Possible Chronology of Events Surrounding Walt Disney's Illegitimate BirthIt is beyond doubt that Walt Disney was an illegitimate child, but that factresulted in a long list of mysterious happenings. It also gave power hungry men,something to blackmail Walt Disney with. Because this chapter 5 on Deception isfocusing on Disney, and the big boys used blackmail to keep Disney in line, thisinformation is pertinent. The following chronology of events is what thisauthor’s believes most likely happened. Without any genetic tests, it isdifficult to determine beyond a shadow of a doubt who Walt’s biological parentswere, and what the actual history of Walt Disney was. Several people have spentmany years investigating the real facts surrounding his birth. Many interestingand tantalizing clues have been found. This author believes that the followingchronology is suggested by the evidence. (This author’s chronology is offeredwithout hundreds of pages of evidence, because the mysteries around WaltDisney’s birth are here to stay, no matter what excuses people come up with, andthis author doesn't want to stray from the intended purpose of the chapter. Thisis to show that Walt Disney had a secret bastard birth which gave J. EdgarHoover --and his superiors-- blackmail leverage over Walt Disney. Walt may alsohave had gambling debts and an abnormal sexual appetite which also helped entraphim. For those who want more evidence and facts, the following are recommended:Almendros, Mojacar, Corner of Enchantment, p. 83; Interview magazine, no. 242,\"\"Walt Disney Was from Almeria\"\", and last but not least Eliot, Marc. WaltDisney, Hollywood’s Dark Prince, chapter 11.) 1890--An attractive Spanish woman Isabelle Zamora Ascenslo of Mojacar leavesSpain and travels to California to a Franciscan monastery.In the same year, but later on in 1890-Walt's future father Elias, who fancieshimself a ladies man, leaves his family to seek his fortune in the gold fields.In California, he meets another newcomer to the state, Isabella Ascensio, andthe two newcomers in California have much in common, have a sexual affair andfall in love. 1891--Elias fails to make a fortune and returns to Chicago, but he doesn'tforget Isabelle. 1893--Isabelle and Elias have a son, and Elias convinces his wife to accept thebaby as theirs rather than have the family's reputation, their marriage, andtheir family ruined. The son doesn't look like the first two boys at all. 1901--Isabelle and Elias have another bastard son, who Elias brings home andnames Walter after the minister of the church he attends. The two bastard sonsdo not look like the older sons of Elias, and they never have much to do withthem, but cling to each other as brothers. 1903--The minister of the church Elias attends finds out about the bastardchildren and Elias quickly moves out of state so that the scandal will remainsecret. Elias has also run up gambling debts. 1905--After moving to Marceline, Missouri, Isabelle is hired as the Disney'smaid, so that she has an excuse to move in with them without creatingsuspicions. She probably does much of the raising and care of the two boys. 1918--J. Edgar Hoover is busy involved with the prosecution of draft dodgers inWW I, and it crosses his desk about the case of Walt Disney committing the crimeof forging his parents signature to join the army. Cases like Walt's werewatched because people who could be blackmailed could be resources in the futurefor Hoover. That year, Walt discovered that he had no birth certificate. Waftobserves his parents strange reactions concerning his birth certificate & otherquestions, & begins to deeply distrust his father. Nov. 1938--Walt's mother dies by gas, and the Disney's maid pulls Elias tosafety from the fumes, but Walt's mother dies. 1939-40--Hoover offers Walt Disney to help Walt locate his real parents if Waltwill work for the FBI. Either Hoover already knows that he is a bastard child,or he soon learns the truth from an investigation. This gives Hoover blackmailpower over Walt Disney, and assures Hoover that Waft will be loyal. Hooverinforms Walt Disney of the truth, and then moves to generously protect Disneyhis father's reputation. Two FBI men plant baptismal information of a child bornto Isabelle in 1890 named Jose Guirao in Mojacar, Spain. This date is 10 yearsoff of Walt's birthdate, and is intended to throw people off track. They can'tplant a fake birth certificate for Waft in the records for 1901, becauseeveryone knows from WW I that none exists. Therefore, they plant a fake birthcertificate for Walt in the Illinois State records in the year 1890. They hopepeople will think that somehow a filing error occurred. This way if anythingleaks, and worst came to worst, Waft could at least pretend he was adopted andis not an illegitimate bastard. They pay off townspeople in Mojacar to tell aparticular story. Townspeople probably receive ongoing payments. 1941--Walt confronts his father with the truth, and his father commits suicide,and his real mother comes to live with him as his maid. 1954--In order to reinforce the myth that Walt was born in Spain, a group ofFranciscan monks goes to Mojacar and visibly inquire about the birth records ofJose Guirao and/or Walt Disney. They spend time with the mayor and make surethat everyone connects Waft Disney with Jose, who is a fictitious (nominal)character that the FBI has created records of. 1967--A year after Walt's death, a large group of Americans (a large group wasneeded because they are not skilled like the 2 FBI men in 1940) pretend to be on\"official\" business for the American government. They go to Majacar Spain todestroy all the records of Jose Guirao to insure that there will be no Spanishclaimants to Walt Disney's fortune. Later to insure that the fictitious story issolidly in place to mislead the few who might get by the cloud of secrecy overWalt Disney, the Spanish government does a favor to certain powerful people andpays an investigator to investigate the Spanish origins of Walt Disney. Peopleof the village willingly tell people without any fear or without any fanfarethat Walt Disney was born at their village. Unless they have recently done so,the village has never done anything--no monuments, no markers, or anything aboutthe birth site of Disney. They probably didn't do this for years, because someof the village probably knew it was a lie. With the older people gone, the liehas probably become well entrenched as truth and there is most likely some typeof memorial to Walt Disney. Walt Disney’s CharacterBecause the Disney deception is such a major Illuminati deception worldwide, andbecause Walt Disney was the major catalyst behind all the Disney theme parks,movies, trinkets etc. it is of importance to examine his character. In studyinghistorical figures, this author has tried to get to the rock bottom truth. Onemay ask, how can this be done? -especially since there have been decades ofmyths spread by the establishment and their media? The following procedure whichhas worked with other historical figures was also done by this author with WaltDisney. The first part of this author’s own procedure is to study everythingthat one can find on the man, paying special attention to what bias and vantagepoint another author comes from. Special attention is also paid to biographerswho try to give the whole truth as they have found it, rather than approvedbiographies that repeat myths, platitudes, and flattery. The investigator has tobe careful because there are authors who deceptively say in their introductionsthat they are \"detached investigators\" who are \"going to be painfully honest intheir reporting\" when they actually are skillful cover-up artists for the personthey write about. When your author, Fritz Springmeier, finished investigatingwritten material about Walt Disney, then I mentally placed what I knew on theshelf temporarily, and did a handwriting analysis based on the scientificprinciples of graphoanalysis as well as the broader field of graphology. Thisauthor is a Certified Graphoanalyst who has done handwriting analysisprofessionally. Using graphoanalysis/graphology is an excellent way to get anunbiased very deep look at a historical figure. It is a way to by-pass all thepropaganda and myths. However, a close historical look and the handwritinganalysis (of various historical figures) have always matched each other, as theydid in this case too. Here is what was found. The following paragraphs are howWalt was in the 1920’s. The personality profile you will read did not endure.Under the pressure of micromanaging Disney Productions as well as living withfinancial stresses, by the 1940’s, Walt could be found in rages giving roughtreatment to his wife, and rough spankings to his two children. He went topsychiatric counseling to cope with the stress. And unfortunately with theprogression of time, by the 1960’s Walt had become a sadistic egotisticalalcoholic. One biographer described him as “...a bully and a know-it-all\"(Disney’s World, p. 220) Even then Walt had men working for him, such as BillWalsh (who had been a orphan as a child) who worshipped Walt. But here is how hewas in the 1920’s:Walt was a self-motivated individual with lots of energy which was constantlyseeking some outlet. (People have written much about this trait of his.) He wasmore the giver than the taker in relationships. (In the first few years, when hewas responsible for making business contracts he often gave away his workwithout setting prices for profits. He even wrote letters to his boss to theeffect that his first priority was good cartoons not profits, and that he’d workwithout profits, but he did want some appreciation for his work. That was hissensitive nature showing.) Walt wouldn’t wait for others to come up with an ideaor someone else to make a move--he was there first. He could communicate hisideas with clarity and ease and move easily from idea to another. (He wouldstorm into Disney Productions and spew one idea after another into his workers’ears.) He enjoyed competition. He had a quick mind and keen perception. Hefrequently acted on intuition and impulse, taking chances and endangering hisown security. (He frequently gambled all his life savings and everything hecould scrape together on a project.) Long projects bored him. (Fortunately thereal tedious work of cartooning was done by a large staff of artists.) Housechores and repetitive chores bored him and he avoided them. (He was absolutely atotal slob around the house as a bachelor.) He was impatient with vaguephilosophies, he liked concrete realities. He was difficult to get along withbecause he had both a playful side (even to the point of cruel practical jokes)to his personality and an aggressive intolerant impatient side that wanted toachieve. Naturally, people around him were disconcerted because on asubconscious level they never knew which side of him they would deal with. (Thereference series Current Biography \"Disney\" article p. 248 gives the followingWalt Disney quote, \"We don’t even let the word ‘art’ be used around the studio.If anyone begins to get arty, we knock them down.\") He was geared for action. Hewas always inventing ways to get what he needed. He could be explosive whenprovoked. (The old time associates of Walt remember his explosive temper.) Hewas a person of dynamic energy, sensuality and keen thinking, and a disciple ofthe pleasure principle.Because his father was so abusive and misused his position of authority, Waltcame to be deeply ingrained with defiance toward authority. (The themes of hisfilms repeatedly sympathize with those who rebel against authority, and thepolice and other authority figures are consistently shown as absurd. One way heexpressed irresponsibility was with lively dance scenes, which has been ahall-mark of teenage rebellion during the 20th century. \"Comic anarchy reachesits fullest expression in Alice Rattled by Rats, which shows what the rats dowhen the cats goes away!) He felt that rules were for others to follow. (That isone reason he would step outside of the law and commit illegal acts. This is onetrait that may be responsible for some of the criminal activities Walt ended upparticipating in.) Walt also didn’t like to be closely supervised. (He wanted tomanage his Disney Magic Kingdom as if it were his own kingdom. He wanted to bean authority figure, and indeed became the dictator of his Magic Kingdom. Whenhis workers differed with his own views he felt that they were infringing uponhis own inalienable rights as an individual.) He was somewhat of a melancholictemperament, that type of perfectionist who still enjoys life. He felt a need toprotect himself against intimacy with others. He was most home in a settingwhich he made for himself. Walt had the traits of an executive. He was slow toreveal his innermost feelings, and definitely set his own goals. Walt was one ofthose persons that when the going got tough, he hung in there. Likewise he wouldcling to his ideas, plans, and possessions. (His stubborn refusal to allow hisbrother Roy to stop the creation of Disneyland led to events that split thebrothers. His determination to succeed was taken advantage of by the crimesyndicates to blackmail him with some debt. In order to get his dreams, he waswilling to give them what they wanted.) A clue to Walt’s macabre sense of humor,at times almost a graveyard sense of humor, and his high tolerance of seeingpain in others, is that Walt was seriously thinking of volunteering again as amedic after the W.W. I fighting in France was over, when volunteers were neededfor the Balkan fighting. Walt loved animals more than people. The only humanbeing that he had rapport with while growing up on the farm was his Uncle Ed(who he called Uncle Elf), who looked like a cross between a leprechaun and aprune. Uncle Elf could make animal sounds and bird whistles to Walt’s delight.Walt loved the charm of the farm and nature and he loved royalty, pageantry anda strict social hierarchy such as Freemasonry provides. He often wove acombination of the barnyard in with royal parades and other trappings ofroyalty. For instance, in Alice the Piper, the King Hamlin is a farmer whosleeps in a farmhouse. In Puss in Boots the local king lives in an authenticpalace incongruously placed in a village. His early film Alice’s Day at Seaincludes both the features of a royal court and an American circus. In typicalDisney disdain for authority, he pokes fun at criminal fraternal groups withtheir rituals and passwords in Alice & the Dog Catcher, Alice Foils the Pirates,and Alice’s Mysterious Mystery. And while he was a secret FBI agent, he wentagainst Hoover’s wishes and poked fun at the FBI’s authority. Walt was loyal towhat he believed and could be loyal to those individuals who he deemed worthy ofhis loyalty, but he didn’t want anyone to have authority over him. (Walt was a320 Freemason & an occultist, he was loyal to that philosophy and loyal in hisearly years to his older brother Roy O. Disney, who was a father figure to him.)If anyone at the studios agreed with him when he was angry at his brother Roy,he or she risked losing their job. Both brothers were protective of each other,and felt they were the only ones who could criticize the other one.D. Who Was Roy O. Disney?Roy O. Disney was born in 1893, and his brother Walt in 1901. They had threeother brothers, but Roy and Walt (1901-1966) were only close to each other andnot to their other brothers, who didn’t resemble them. Walt was named WalterElias, his middle name derived from his father’s first name. The Disney familyhad emigrated from Ireland to Canada and then to the U.S. The father of thebrothers as stated was Elias, and their mother of Scottish descent, who may nothave been the biological mother, had the maiden name Flora Call. Roy died in1971, shortly after the opening ceremonies for Walt Disney World. He kept hispromises to his brother to build Walt Disney World. He reneged on his promisesconcerning the city of Epcot (which was derailed into becoming EPCOT). Roy O.during the 1930’s lived in North Hollywood. Roy’s family later located in NapaValley, CA, and was associated with the Illuminati kingpins in the area. NapaValley has been nicknamed the Valley of Kings. This \"Valley of Kings\" plays amajor role in the dirty activities revealed in this chapter. Roy 0. Disneyplayed a bigger role at Disney Studios than people realize. For example, it wasRoy O. who made the decision to cut 45 min. out of Fantasia, so that Walt’s petproject could be distributed to movie theaters. Roy O., considered by someinsiders as the more evil of the two brothers, kept the financial books for theDisney’s down through the years. It is known that Disney kept two books duringthe 1950’s, so it is hard to believe anything except that Roy 0. was fully awareof how Disney brought in their money. The big boys always kept the financialscrews to Walt and Roy. The big boys often figured out scams to take theirmoney. When the Disney brothers had an arrangement with Columbia Studio (run byHarry Cohn) they were advanced $7,500 for each cartoon which cost them anunprofitable $13,500 to make. Further, Cohn liked to cheat them by not sendingthem their money, and taking a ridiculous amount of time to pay them what heowed them. The cash flow problems of the Disney brothers also came from Walt’sdesire to keep improving and upgrading the technology they used. When Walt wentto color over Roy’s objections, Disney’s profit margin was damaged and thestudio was left with shortages of cash. In 1937, Walt’s repeated gambles withcartoon production ideas caused Roy O. to say, \"We’ve bought the whole damnedsweepstakes.\" From 1940 through 1946, Disney lost money every year. In '46, helost $23,000. Finally in 1947, things turned around and the Disney studio made aprofit of $265,000. Cartoons and movies were not really big moneymakers for theDisney brothers, until it was realized that old films could be replayed ontelevision. Overall, from the 20’s through the 50’s, the Disney’s may havebroken even with animation. This is why Disney Studios at Christmas, 1931 wasunable to pay its payroll. Pinocchio cost $2.6 million to make in the late’30’s, an amount hard to retrieve at that time from the box office, andFantasia’s original release in the ’40’s was a dismal financial failure. WhenSleeping Beauty was released in 1960, it was a loser, movie goers were apathetictowards it. The real money made by the Disney brothers in the 1930-1950’s camefrom the merchandising of Disney products, the production of underground hardporn, and the kickbacks from various groups which used Disney for mind-controlprogramming, and money laundering. When Walt died, his shares in Disney wereworth $18 million. His family all in all held 34% of the stock in Walt DisneyProductions. Roy o. Disney’s daughter Dorothy Disney Puder & husbandEpiscopalian Rev. Glen Puder purchased property at 1677 Sage Canyon Rd., NapaValley east of Rutherford. O.J. Simpson’s lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr. was in theRothschild’s hard-to-enter Opus 1 when the jury arrived at a decision in O.J.Simpson’s case.) It is very typical for Mafia families in south Boston to haveone family member in the clergy and one full time in organized crime. (Seeauthor’s Be Wise As Serpents for an expose on the Episcopalian Church, which issimply a branch of Freemasonry.) All kinds of interesting Mafia figures,Illuminati, and Bohemian Grovers live up the Sage Canyon Rd. This is an areathat has a large well-kept cemetery for pets. Frank Well’s sister and RichFrank, who will all be discussed later in this chapter, also live on Sage CanyonRd.E. Who Was Roy B. Disney? Roy Edward Disney (nephew of Walt) is the son of Roy Oliver Disney (brother ofWalt). Sometimes he has been called Junior. The 9/5/94 Newsweek story onDisney’s Magic Kingdom called him \"Keeper of the Flame.\" Roy is an executivewith Walt Disney Co. at 500 5. Buena Vista St., Burbank, CA 91521. He has workedas an asst. producer at Walt Disney Co. from 1954 to 1977. He has also been thevice-pres. of Walt Disney Co. He is president of Roy E. Disney Prodns. inBurbank. He is chairman of the board for Shamrock Broadcasting Co. As if thatweren’t enough, he is on the board of directors for St. Joseph Med. Ctr., fellowU. Ky. Recipient of the Academy award nomination for Mysteries of the Deep. Heis a director of the Guild American West, the Writers Guild, which is important.He belongs to the 100 Club, the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, and St.Francis Yacht Club. He likes speed boat racing. Roy E. Disney was the cocky sonof Roy O. He married a gal named Patricia. He was merely tolerated by his uncleWalt, especially after Roy E. made some snide remarks about Walt’s plans forDisneyland, which he and his father opposed until Walt Disney personally got theproject going. Walt’s son-in-law Ronald Miller is one of the Disney clan whocan’t stand Roy E. The two never liked each other, and in the power strugglebetween them after Walt’s death, Roy E. won and ended up with Disney. Althoughpeople called Roy E. \"Walt’s idiot nephew\", he eventually (with the help of hisfather & outsiders) won the various power struggles at Disney after Walt died,and is now a powerful figure. Roy E. Disney and Stanley P. Gold work together invarious ways, and are both on the present Disney Bd. of Dir. They are friendsand worked to prevent hostile takeovers of Disney in 1984. Gold is in charge ofShamrock Holdings, Inc.The Battle Between the Two Disney FactionsIn 1953, the two brothers and their respective sides of the family split whenWalt created RETHAW Corporation. The two sides have fought ever since. When WaltDisney created RETLAW (his name Walter spelled backwards), this alienated hisbrother Roy O. & Roy’s side of the family. Without going into all the details,what RETLAW did was cut Roy O.’s side out of the money that was to be made. ButRoy’s side didn’t stand by and idly let their share of the pie be lost, theyfought back and held their own. Their big break came when Michael Milken and hisband of junk bond artists carried out a \"greenmail\" on the Disney Corp. Only afew insiders know how greenmail works. It is a legal form of blackmail. Milkenwould work with his friends Saul Steinberg, Sir James Goldsmith, and Carl Icahn.Milken would provide them the financial clout, to make them look financiallycapable of financially purchasing a corporation that they had selected as atarget. According to insiders, Milken got 40% of the upside of any \"greenmail\"that went right. The targeted corporation would learn that someone like SaulSteinberg was going to buy them out. In order to prevent the buyout, and to keeptheir jobs, the officers of the targeted corporation would get frantic, andeither do suicidal refinancing, or buy the stock of the potential acquirer formuch greater prices than the Milken group paid for them. The \"greenmail\" artistswould then take their loot and go on their way. The stockholders of the targetedcompany are the real losers of \"greenmail\", because the management of thecorporation in order to finance their protection spends the stockholder’s money,takes on new debts, and deprives the stockholders of some profit-makingpotential of their shares. Michael Milken’s group made feints to take over alarge number of corporations, including Walt Disney, Phillips Petroleum andAvco. Saul Steinberg made what looked like the beginnings of a sincere hostiletakeover of Walt Disney through Reliance. At one point Reliance became Disney’slargest stockholder. Steinberg filed an amended 13D saying he intended toacquire 25% of the corporation. The CEO of Walt Disney, was Walt Disney’sson-in-law Ron Miller. Saul Steinberg is a dear business partner with London’sJacob de Rothschild. Originally, Ron Miller (Stanford Univ. grad.) and RayWatson (a Bohemian Grove mmbr from Stanford Univ.) of Walt Disney’s managementbrought in the Bass brothers to help them deal with Saul Steinberg’s takeoverand to buy and develop land (esp. in Florida). Ray Watson was Ron Miller’s keyright hand man to run things. The Bass brothers are mafia. Disney acquired theBass Brother’s Arvida, and brought the Bass brothers into Disney’s management.The Basses sold their stake in Texaco back to the oil co. & then used this moneyto bolster Disney. Sid Bass & Chuck Cobb (chief exec. Arvida) worked out a dealwith Disney. Arvida (sold to Disney for $200 mil.) would profit from developingDisney land in FL and Disney would profit from the new financial strength thatgetting Arvida would provide. Arvida owned oil fields, theme parks, and hadhelped create planned communities. For Ron Miller, on the one side was theIlluminati and the other side of things was the mafia. He didn’t trust either,but Steinberg’s takeover could eliminate Disney’s management and both he (andRoy E. Disney) wanted to save Disney from a takeover by Steinberg. At first, RoyE. wrote a letter to Ron Miller & the other board members stating his concernsabout the acquisition of Arvida for Disney management, at least the Bassbrothers would let Walt Disney continue to make their family movies. After theBass brothers joined the Disney management (and became one of Disney’s majorstockholders), they soon joined sides with Roy E. in a management fallout overwhether Disney should buy Gibson Greeting Card Company. With enough votes on theboard, they sent Ron Miller packing. With Ron Miller, and those management menaligned with Walt’s side of the family gone, then CEO Michael Eisner, FrankWells, Rich Frank, and Jeffrey Katzenberg and some others made the modern WaltDisney Corporation. Disney’s Touchtone studio which was mentioned above inconnection to the movie Alive was created in 1984 by Walt Disney’s son-in-lawRonald L. Miller. Ron Miller’s management style was lackluster. The newmanagement has really gone gang busters. Although Walt’s side of the family isout of the management end of Disney, they still receive financial rewards fromvarious Disney enterprises. The Bass brothers acquired more land for Disney inFlorida. But under their tutelage, Disney now has a management team that isskilled in land grabbing techniques. The Bass fortune began with Perry Bass, whocreated a company called Bass Enterprises. In 1969, Perry retired and turnedthings over to his eldest son, Sid Richardson Bass. Sid has three youngerbrothers Ed, Robert and Lee. The Basses owned 27% in Prime Computer, as well assizable real estate and oil holdings. The Bass brothers founded a local prepschool in Ft. Worth, TX. Their HQs in Ft. Worth is full of modern art. The Bassbrothers were very clever in their deal with Disney. In exchange for their $14investment in Arvida, they had gotten (over a period of time)$950-million-dollars’ worth of Disney stock. In 1985, they liquidated BassBrothers Enterprises and divided the assets between the four brothers. Sid Basswas able to shift his interests from finances to culture and high society. Oneof the Bass brothers is involved with wineries in Napa Valley. The BassBrother’s financial strategist was Alfred Checchi, now of Beverly Hills, who hasbeen a supporter of Mishpucka member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).Roy is involved in criminal activities, and several people investigating himhave been bluntly warned that if they continue, they will see their childrenmurdered. Napa Valley’s Illuminati activity also connects in with CIA activitiesas well. The Napa Valley Illuminati families all have CIA connections. Forinstance, British millionaire Kenneth Armitage, who had to flee from England toavoid arrest on numerous charges of theft, deception and false accounting, hadsome of his good friends in the Napa Valley, such as Dr. John Duff, Johnny Beck,& others. Armitage has since mysteriously died in prison in England. Armitagehad intelligence connections which tie in with twilight world of the criminalactivities of the numerous intelligence acronym monsters. Also his company wasauthorized to provide people with Central American government documents. Thereis more-- much more to sordid affairs which swirl around Roy Disney. NapaValley, where many members of the Disney family live, has the Illuminati’s OpusOne temple owned by Rothschilds, as well as two roads lined with meticulouslykept wineries owned by Illuminati kingpins and connected via secret undergroundtunnels. To top off this incredible collection of Illuminati wineries(Rothschild’s, Mondavi’s, Rutherford’s, Christian Brother’s, Sattui’s etc), onthe north end of a series of wineries on highway 29 lays the CIA’smedieval-looking Culinary Institute of America Greystone (at 2555 Main St., St.Helena, CA 94574), where numerous people have suffered torture. The GreystoneCulinary Institute of America recently had the person who runs their campusstore mentioned in House & Garden, Sept. ‘96.F. What Do We Know About the Disney Family in General?Several members of the Disney family came to England with William the Conqueror.They were not known as Disney then, but because they came from the French Normantown of Isigny, they took the name d ‘Isigny, and anglicized it into Disney.Walt had two daughters, Diane Marie (bn. 12/18/33) and Sharon Mae.Diane made some revealing comments when she said, he didn’t spoil us. Like a lotof adolescent girls, I was crazy about horses, and I got quite good at riding. Iyearned for my own horse, but Dad wouldn’t buy one. And we didn’t have a lot ofclothes and other things.\" For being one of the richest men in the nation, Waltcan’t be accused of having spoiled his children. He was also famous for his tencent tips at restaurants, which became the talk of the town. Sharon Mae wasadopted and arrived at the Disney home 12/31/36. (She died in ’93.) The adoptionwas kept very secret. The newspapers around the country announced that Lillianhad given birth to Sharon, and the Disney family kept up this lie for years. Thereason given for Sharon’s adoption was that Diane needed a playmate. For years,Walt Disney didn’t care much for Sharon and seldom acted like he even knew hername. Walt had wanted a son, but his wife wanted to adopt a girl, so it was abeautiful girl that Lillian picked out to be a companion for her first daughter.When Sharon was kindergarten age, Walt would take her to the carousels inGriffith Park on Sunday afternoons. Sharon was sent to private schools. She wentto Westlake School for Girls, and later was shipped off to Switzerland to agirls’ boarding school.She had soft blond locks and was attractive. In June of 1948, Walt took Sharon,who was then an attractive 12 yr. old to Alaska with him for about two months.For most of this trip Walt and Sharon were alone together. For a father, who hadignored Sharon for years, now Walt was totally obsessed with Sharon. He bathedSharon every night, combed her hair, washed her underwear, and carefully dressedher each night from head to toe before taking her to nice restaurants. He evenfollowed her when she sleep walked. Why was Sharon a dissociative person? Thatsummer in Alaska, Walt and his personal pilot took a trip in August to Mt.McKinley, AK. Both were drinking scotch whiskey and they barely missed hitting amountain, and almost ran out of fuel before finding a runway. Sharon firstmarried a Presbyterian Robert Borgfeldt Brown. Later, Sharon went on to marryWilliam Lund. Years later, Walt’s wife Lilly even prevented a biographer fromrevealing that Sharon was adopted. Sharon died relatively young. It is importantto look at the Disney family rather than just Walt Disney in trying tounderstand the Disney phenomena. For instance in 1958, the Wall Street Journalmentioned that Lillian B. Disney was beneficial owner of over 10% of commonDisney stock.Lillian, Walt’s widow, quietly purchased property in Napa Valley and moved therein the late 60’s. She bought the property through Walt’s Retlaw Enterprises andthe Lillian Disney Trust. Lillian and her two daughters ran Retlaw for years.Diane Miller, her daughter, also bought land and moved to the Napa area. TheLillian Disney Trust bought the Silverado Vineyards, which Diane & her husbandmanage as “gentlemen growers\" as they call it. This side of the Disney family isshunned by the Illuminati insiders in the Napa Valley, as well as by the Roy O.side of the family. Although very private, there are occasional moments ofpublicity from Diane Disney Miller, when she donated wine for a fund raiser forthe Planned Parenthood Shasta Diablo held at the estate Niebaum-Coppola, ownedby director/producer Francis Ford Coppola. Francis F. Coppola comes from an oldmafia family. He owns a big winery & directed Disney’s Caption EO film. Localsin the Napa area do not trust any of the Disneys, especially the Roy O. side ofthe family. There are other Disney’s who tie in with the occult world. WesleyErnest Disney, a 32° Mason & Shriner, who was a U.S. Congressman, a stateofficial & lawyer in Kansas who had a brother Richard Lester Disney-- who is aRhodes Scholar and a Mason too. Wesley Ernest Disney, by the way began as alawyer in Muskogee County (a Satanic controlled county), and was a ChristianScientist. He lived in Tulsa, a powerful city of the Illuminati hierarchy. DorisMiles Disney has been a writer of occult fiction, such as The Magic Grandfatherthe Chandler Policy (1972) and Trick or Treat (1972) as well as many otheroccult novels.G. A History Of Disney\"The story of Disney’s silent film career is not so much a struggle for artisticexpression as it is a fight for commercial stability.\" During the 1920’s, Waltstayed safely within the confines of comic animation as defined by others, suchas the producers of Felix the Cat, Koko the Clown, and Krazy Kat. In otherwords, when many of the ideas were coming from just himself, Disney’s movieswere not any better than others. In the 1930’s, Disney got some of the besttalent available and he began to settle for only the best results from thattalent. With the mob, and the Illuminati behind him, and driven by anindebtedness to them, Disney began to achieve outstanding results in animation.Between 1924 and 1927, Walt Disney made a series of 56 silent Alice Comedieswhich used three different girls (six-year-old Virginia Davis, Margie Gay andLois Hardwick) to act as Alice who romps around in a make-believe cartoon world.These cartoons combined live action and animation. By the time the series wasdone, Walt Disney wanted to try working solely with animation. Margaret Winklerin NY (who married Charles Mintz) distributed Walt Disney’s Alice Comedies. Fromthe beginning, children were the center of everything Walt did. The occult worldthat backed Walt, as well as Walt himself, believed that if they could bring out\"the child\" (that part of a person called \"the child\" by various psychologists),then they could appeal to the curiosity and feelings of the \"child\" part ofadults. If it worked with adults, they could do the same with the child part inchildren. They knew even in the 20’s & ’30’s what had to be accomplished in thesecret Great Plan for a New World Order. The Illuminati Great Plan called forfamily life to be destroyed, for children to rebel against their parents, andfor the world to become more violent. Children needed to immerse in images ofviolence so that a violent society could be created. For instance, the 1925 filmAlice Stage Struck shows little girl Alice strapped to a log leading to a buzzsaw. They also wanted to make occultism-- witchcraft the common belief of theAmerican people. The Illuminati felt they could bring in witchcraft if theyappealed to the curiosity of the child in every adult. For instance, the DonaldDuck cartoon Corn Chips (1951) shows Donald harassing Chip and Dale who then getback at him by stealing a box of popcorn and spreading it all over the frontyard. Now what does a cartoon like this teach kids? It teaches that stealing torepay a grudge is O.K. and that doing pranks is funny. In Disney’s 1920 films,he shows kids cutting school, shoplifting and playing hooky. He shows Alicerunning away from responsibility to have adventure. He shows prisoners escapingand hobos escaping work. His films are expression of misbehavior beingsuccessful. What does this teach children? In the 1951 cartoon, Get Rich QuickGoofy wins money at poker and his initially angry wife who doesn’t like gamblingforgives him when she sees how much he’s won. Goofy indicates that they can havea spending spree by telling his wife, \"Easy come, easy go!\" The gambling spiritis a very powerful spirit that the Illuminati want to instill in this nation.How can a cartoon that promotes gambling be wholesome for children? Lt. Col.Dave Grossman is a military expert on how to condition people so that they willkill. He writes in his superb book On Killing (Boston, MS: Little Brown & Co.,1996) that the same process that the government has used to condition soldiersto kill, is being used by the entertainment industry. The only major differenceis that in the military, men are taught to kill only on command, while ourchildren are being taught to kill whenever they want to via TV’s\"entertainment.\" Grossman states on page 308, that the conditioning to killbegins with cartoons.\"It begins innocently with cartoons and then goes on to the countless acts ofviolence depicted on TV as the child grows up... .Then the parents, throughneglect or conscious decision, begin to permit the child to watch movies rated Rdue to vivid depictions of knives penetrating and protruding from bodies, longshots of blood spurting from severed limbs, and bullets ripping into bodies andexploding out the back in showers of blood and brains.\"While children see horrible deaths on T.V., they learn to associate thissuffering with entertainment, pleasure and their favorite soft drink, theirfavorite candy bar, and close intimate contact with their date. (See On Killing,p. 302) Disney has the appearance of Wholesomeness; this appearance is quitedeceptive. A close study of Disney cartoons will reveal lots of violence thatcould not be depicted if the violence was actually real life & not animation.It’s the wholesome front which is one of the deceptions that makes Disneycartoons & films so dangerous. Yes, the image of Disney has been that itscartoons are wholesome. No wonder Illuminati mind-control programmers havelaughed at how naive the American public is toward Disney. The Disney Gargoylescartoons are a television series that is pure demonology. The story line is thata race of demons protects New York City. One of the Gargoyles is even namedDemona. The Illuminati programmers are amazed at how stupid the masses of peopleare, and how easily deceived. How the Disney movies are used as programmingscripts is very involved so only one detailed example is given at the end ofthis chapter. The Illuminati and Mafia knew that Walt had the ability to get thejob done that the Great Plans called for. (Source: confidential interview.) Theyknew they had the \"carrots and the sticks\" to get him to cooperate. There is nodoubt that Walt was a hard worker who in turn expected high standards from hisemployees. One co-worker of Walt wrote, \"Walt made a simple statement, that youcan lick them with ‘product’ if you make your product good enough, they cannotdeny it.. . .In Walt’s estimation, everything that was done had to be executedwith a great deal of thought and finesse.\" Neelands, Barbara, compiler. AboutBen Sharpsteen, article by David R. Smith (2nd Impress.) Calistoga, CA: ASharpsteen Museum Reprint, pg. 2-3. One big turn in Walt’s outlook towardquality came in April, 1927 when the head of Universal Studios wrote a scathingreport on the quality of Disney studio work. It forced Walt to realize that upto then he had been slipshod and sloppy. He resolved to never take the easy way,but to work with dedication toward making his drawings come to life withcharacter and interesting situations. In 1922, Walt made a film Cinderella. Thisis not to be confused with the later animated film also of the same titlereleased in 1950. The 1950 feature was re-released numerous times. The Alicecartoons were made with a six-year-old girl playing Alice. The first six Alicecomedies had extensive live-action beginnings, and then went into cartoon. A fewof the 1920’s Alice silent cartoon titles include: * Alice’s Wonderland (1923) * Alice Hunting in Africa (1924) * Alice’s Spooky Adventure (1924) * Alice Plays Cupid (1925) * Alice Cans the Cannibals (1925) * Alice Rattled by Rats (1925) * Alice Chops the Suey (1925) * Alice Charms the Fish (1926) * Alice the Whaler (1927) * Alice the Beach Nut (1927)After the Alice Series, Disney began a fully animated series called Oswald theLucky Rabbit. Here we see the occult concept of luck (who hasn’t heard of alucky Rabbit’s foot?) being subtly promoted. Disney cartoon may entertain, butthey also indoctrinate while they entertain. In 1926, Walt Disney signed anagreement with Mintz and Film Booking Offices (EBO). Film Booking Offices wereIlluminati kingpin/mob boss Joseph Kennedy’s company. For at least the nextyears, Disney worked under the control (auspices) of Illuminati kingpin Kennedy.All of the Disney pictures were registered by R-C Pictures Corp., one of theparent companies of Kennedy’s FBO. Joseph Kennedy also controlled the RKO studiowhich worked together with the other big studios to insure that no small studiowould develop as a competitor. By 1937, all the big studios--20th Cent.,Paramount, MGM, Warner Bros., Cohn’s Columbia Pictures and Kennedy’s RKO wereallowing the mob to skim money from them. Kennedy’s RKO gave Walt a guarantee in1937 that they’d distribute Snow White sight unseen. Walt Disney had their filmsdistributed by Kennedy’s RKO from 1936 to 1956. Another little known detail isthat in 1926, Leon Schlesinger (future producer at Warner Bros.) subcontractedanimation jobs to Disney. One of these was Universal’s The Silent Flyer. In1928, Steamboat Willie debuted. This was an animated cartoon with a soundtrackstarring a mouse later named Mickey Mouse. It had taken lots of hard work anddetermination on Walt’s part, but it was the first cartoon with a sound trackand it was successful. In 1929, the cartoon The Haunted House came out. Thestory is, Mickey Mouse is forced by a storm into a house full of ghosts whoforce him to contribute to their spooky musicale. In 1930, Harry Cohn, one ofthe most ruthless and unsavory characters controlling a studio bailed WaltDisney out of Walt’s trouble with con-artist Pat Powers who was stealingDisney’s money. Harry Cohn was a former NY pool hustler and gambler who wasbrought in by Chicago investors to front their investments in Columbia Pictures,and run their studio. He wore a sapphire ring that the Chicago Mafia man JohnnyRoselli gave him. Roselli later became a rogue asset of the CIA, and testifiedbefore Congress (the Church Committee on Assassinations in ‘74) about a CIAcontract which was handed him. Roselli worked for the Mafia Council of 9, whichincl. Anthony Accardo and Sam Giancana. Harry Cohn was said by some to be themost hated man in Hollywood. His money gave him \"the power of an emperor\". Hismoney got him the best female flesh available which he used for his pleasure. Healways seemed to arrive from Las Vegas with rolls of new greenbacks, which hadclose associates wondering where all the money came from that he always got whenhe made trips to Las Vegas. In 1931, Walt went into a long suicidal depressionthat lasted into 1932. In the summer of 1932, he took a vacation to try andrecover from his nervous breakdown. By 1932, Ingersoll had marketed its firstedition of Mickey Mouse watches. Disney products have served as a model ofconsumerism for the world. Disney watches have been made continuously since 1932or ‘33. In 1932, eighty major U.S. corporations (such as General Foods, RCA &National Dairy) began to market Disney products. Ed Sullivan began regularlyrunning stories that bragged about Disney’s work. Freemason Dr. Rufus B. vonKleinsmid, pres. of the Univ. of So. Cal., gave Disney an award from ParentsMagazine for Walt’s \"work with children\". In 1932, several artists who hadworked for William Randolph Hearst came to work for Disney. In 1932, Royswitched Disney from Columbia to United Artists. United Artists agreed to frontDisney $15,000 for each cartoon.In the 1930’s, the Illuminati’ Bank of America financed Walt Disney. Yearsbefore, the Bank of America had been quietly created from Bank of Italy whichwas controlled by the same oligarchy that has run the Knights of Malta andrenaissance Venice. The Bank of Italy was a powerful bank in Hollywood’s firstyears. It’s representatives A.P. and Atillo Giannini financed Walt during the1920’s with petty cash to keep him going, but not enough to get him out offinancial bondage.Joe Rosenberg of Bank of America was sympathetic to Walt. Joe Rosenberg, aJewish banker, came to all of Disney’s board meetings, sat beside Walt, andwould advise Walt on what direction Disney Studios should take. Joe wasn’t aboard member, but his advice got high priority. Bank of America also bankrolledother Illuminati projects and organizations. Bank of America had one of theirbranch offices on Disneyland’s Main St. from ’55 until ‘93. They were open onholidays and Sundays for Disneyland. Bank of America is slated to be perhaps theonly bank to survive the economic crash, when the Illuminati kingpins will allowtheir own banks to crash. Bank of America executive S. Clark Beise (who is aScottish Rite Freemason) has been a member of Disney’s board of directors from‘65 to ’75. One of the biggest depositors in Bank of America is Roy E. Disney.Other Disney execs like Rich Frank have also used Bank of America as their bankof choice.The Bank of America bankrolled the Disney animation Snow White. Walt managed tosell Joseph Rosenberg on the idea, at a time when old time Hollywood people wereadvising Rosenberg that Snow White could only be a failure. When Snow White wassuccessful, Walt announced a monster party for all Disney workers at LakeNorconian, near Palm Springs, southeast of San Bernardino, CA where the cost ofeverything the Disney workers wanted to order--food or drink or whatever, wouldbe taken care of by the Disney’s. Under the full moon, the Disney male andfemale workers, finally free of the tight rules at the studios, had whatamounted to a Roman orgy and a large nude skinny-dip at the lake. Almost all ofthe Disney workers participated in the orgy and Disney had only two options, 1.Fire them all, or 2. Ignore that the party took place. Walt chose the latteroption, and after that, no-one ever dared mention the party in his presence. In1937, Walt and Roy took a trip to Europe where Walt dined with the British Royalfamily, & met privately with H.G. Wells, the masonic prophet! and planner ofwhat Wells & other masons called \"the New World Order\". In Paris, the League ofNations (the forerunner to the U.N.) gave him an award. After the success ofSnow White, Disney chose Pinocchio to follow it. Many have asked why Pinocchiowas chosen by Walt. If you look at the script, the puppet maker’s wife is takenout of the original script, and there is an emphasis on the little wooden puppetvisualizing becoming a flesh & blood son to the man who had created him. Here wehave a boy with no soul, who is told if he works hard he will be given one. Thescript was definitely changed to have a storyline far more useful tomind-control programming. For those who think Walt simply recreated fairy taleson the screen, if one examines the changes that are made from the originalstorylines, they are changed to make them more useful for mind-control. BothSnow White and Pinocchio have occult type \"deaths and resurrections\". After W.W.II, Joseph Rosenberg persuaded A.P. Giannini, his boss, to bankroll Disneyagain. Although Walt was financed by the Mishpucka (Jewish Mafia), he didn’tlike the idea. Richard Rosenberg, a later Pres. of Bank of America, is alsoMishpucka. Richard Rosenberg (his mother was a Cohen) was also in charge ofNorthrop Corp. and Marin Ecumenical Housing Assn. (Other examples of Mishpuckaexecutives are R. Goldstein, v.p. of Procter & Gamble, and Marvin Koslow, v.p.of Bristol Meyers Co.) In the 1930’s, the elite promoted Disney’s new cartoons.In 1935, Walt Disney received the French Legion of Honor for his Mickey Mousecartoons. Also in 1935, the Queen of England (who readers of my previousarticles will realize is Illuminati, involved in drug trade, and is involvedwith the leadership of Freemasonry) and the Duchess of York (also Illuminati)selected Mickey Mouse chinaware as gifts for 600 children. This was after Waltspent time with her in 1934. The League of Nations (the pre-W.W. II equivalentof the U.N.) took the time to vote its approval of Mickey Mouse. (Finch,Christopher. The Art of Walt Disney from Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdom . NY:Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1975, p. 53.) There is no doubt that Walt Disney hadtalent. There is also no doubt from the record that powerful people wanted topromote him. No doubt his 320 Masonic membership and his DeMolay activitieshelped boost his support, and also helped Walt’s bent toward the occult. Let’sdigress just to let people in on Freemasonry’s involvement with acting andmotion pictures. The famous 233 Club was a masonic chapter for actors who wereFreemasons. Examples of actors who were Freemasons include John Aasen, GeneAutry, Monte Blue and Humphrey Bogart, Douglas McClean, John Wayne. Then thereis T.V. DJ Dick Clark. Examples of Motion picture executives who were Freemasonsinclude: * Ellis G. Arnall (Pres. of the Soc. of Ind. Motion Picture Producers) * Will H. Hays (Czar of motion pictures 1922-45, and Pres. Motion Picture Produces & Distributors of Amer. Inc.) * Benj. B. Kahane (v.p. & dir. Assoc. of Motion Picture Producers, Inc.) * Carl Laemmle (Pres. Univ. Pictures Corp til ’36) * Frank E. Mullen ( man. dept of info. RCA, VP NBC ‘39-’46, exec. VP NBC ‘46-’48) * David Sarnoff (Chrm. of Bd. Radio Corp. of Amer. & ,,father\" of American television) * Jack M. Warner (v.p. of Warner Bros.) and the President and dir. of Universal Pictures since 1952. The Freemasons have made much of Walt Disney’s membership in their membership sales pitches.Because the two Disney brothers’ chief contributions to the production of Disneyfilms were the finances and occasionally the ideas used in a film, it is rathermisrepresentative of things that Walt Disney got all the credit for the successand quality of the Disney cartoons. He was showered with 700 awards and honorsfrom important people, including 30 Oscars, and the Presidential Medal ofFreedom (in ’64). Walt Disney’s great animators never got the credit theydeserved, but no one should forget that Walt was the driving force that inspiredand guided his workers. In 1934, Walt Disney made a cartoon about a goddess ofthe Mystery Religions named Persephone. In the cartoon entitled The Goddess ofSpring, the goddess Persephone is captured by Satan as his bride and sent to theunderworld, with the agreement she could return to earth six months of eachyear. The Illuminati have rituals around Persephone. On Dec. 21, 1937, Disneypremiered the first full-length color cartoon movie Snow White and the SevenDwarfs. This cartoon had taken $1.4 in depression-time money and three years tomake. Over 750 artists worked on the film. Walt Disney had gotten the idea froma silent movie of Snow White which he saw as a boy in 1917. The movie has animportant occult theme to it, and has been used for occult mind-controlprogramming. When the 1940’s got started, Disney was in financial difficulties.At this point, Nelson Rockefeller hired his cartoon capabilities to makecartoons for South America, with the idea that South Americans would remainloyal to the American capitalist hegemony, rather than shift to risingideologies of fascism/Nazism, if they saw Walt Disney cartoons. In Rio deJaneiro, Brazil on 8/24/42, Disney did its world premiere of Saludo Amigos, a 42minute feature about Latin America. Goofy becomes a gaucho, a parrot teachesDonald Duck to dance the samba, as well as Disney art showing various landscapesof Brazil in the film. However, the film The Three Caballeros, if it was meantto encourage South American loyalty to American capitalism, completely failed.The Three Caballeros showed a sexually lecherous Donald Duck who in bad tastetries to make it with Latin women. The mysticism was also seen as bogus.Although the Latin Americans hated the film, the establishment media’s Lookmagazine praised it. Another reason that Rockefeller sent Walt to South Americawas to get him out of the way so that the government could settle the strike byDisney workers. Nelson Rockefeller was the government’s Coordinator ofInter-American Affairs, a good position considering how much of South Americathe Rockefeller’s controlled. Rockefeller told Disney that Disney couldn’t beatthe strikers, but that while Walt was in South America, FDR would see to it thatthe strike got settled. When Disney returned he submitted to the powers thatwere, and accepted the unions and the mafia’s control. Another change for WaltDisney was that in 1940, he and Roy turned Disney into a \"public corporation\"and initially sold 755,000 shares of common stock. The Illuminati Boston firm ofKidder, Peabody & Co. were the underwriters of the studio’s publicstock-offerings. By 1940, the Disney Studio at Burbank had become a miniaturecity with 1,000 men and women employees and 20 buildings on a 51-acre tract ofland. After the U.S. joined W.W. II, Disney Productions were made a part of theAmerican military establishment. The very next day after Pearl Harbor, themilitary moved onto the Disney Studio, which leads this author to suspect thatDisney was already part of the power establishment prior to the war breakingout. Disney made military movies/cartoons that taught the different branches ofthe military many things. They made propaganda movies for the allies. One seriesof films was Why We Fight. Disney made movies for the IRS to get people to paytheir taxes. Some of the Disney films were top, secret, and concerned secretmilitary weapons or secret psychological tactics of the Americans. For instance,one military film was Army Psychotherapy which taught army men how to instillfear, and about the basics of fear. Another army film was Prostitution & theWar. Another showed a carrier pigeon evading the Germans.In 1940, Disney came out with two full-length animated cartoons, Pinocchio andFantasia, both of which were soon used for Illuminati mind-control programming.Fantasia contains Schubert’s sacred Catholic music Ave Maria, which was used ina concluding segment side to side with the profane “Night on Bald Mountain”song, as well as six other classical pieces of orchestra music. As a featurecartoon it was a flop, but as a programming tool it was fantastic. Fantasiareceives a comprehensive explanation of how it is used for mind-controlprogramming at the end of this chapter. Because an explanation of the use of aDisney film for mind-control is complex, this explanation is placed at the endof the chapter so that it won’t interrupt the flow of this chapter’sinformation. The Pinocchio film has been redone and released 9 times over theyears. Some of the next full length animated films to come out were: * The Three Caballeros (1945) * The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (‘49) * Cinderella (1950) * Treasure Island (1950) * Alice in Wonderland (1951) * The Story of Robin Hood and His Merry Men (1952) * Peter Pan (1953) * 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954) * Sleeping Beauty (1959)Very soon after the production of all of these movies, the Illuminati and theirintelligence agencies used them for Illuminati total mind-control programming.To see their misuse as programming scripts one has to understand how the fantasyworlds of a programmed multiple are created and how the movie scripts areadapted to be programming scripts. There are quite a few examples of how Alicein Wonderland and the Wizard of Oz scripts were used for programming scripts.When Disney had his animal-nature documentaries, he edited and used narration togive the animals human-like characteristics--something he’d already been doingwith animation. Disney played an important part in the Illuminati’s plan toelevate animals and dehumanize humans. One of the biggest Illuminati kingpins,and leader (Grand Master) of the Prieure de Sion was Frenchman Claude Debussy(bn.1862). Claude Debussy, a Merovingian, was Nautonnier (Navigator-helmsman) ofthe Prieure de Sion from 1885-1918. (See the document “Dossiers Secrets”,Planche no. 4, Ordre de Sion, written about in Holy Blood, Holy Grail.) In 1891,when some secret coded parchments (Merovingian documents) were found by a Frenchclergyman Sauniere, he was directed by church officials to visit with EmileHoffet, an occult acquaintance of Debussy. Debussy was close friends with manyof the top French occultists of his time. He is known to have been a closefriend to both the notorious Satanists Jules Bois and MacGregor Mathers. Mathersstarted the Order of the Golden Dawn. Debussy was also a friend of the infamousPapus (aka Dr. Gerard Encausse) and W.B. Yeats. Papus was one of the men whoduring his lifetime was part of the interlocking occult directorate of occultgroups. Claude Debussy put some works of the previous P.d.S. Grand Master VictorHugo to music. Debussy and his other powerful occult friends were influentialwith Monsieur Philippe, whose Russian occult circle influenced the Russian Czarsand Czarinas before Rasputin came around. Debussy travelled to Russia and Rome.Some of Debussy’s works became operas. Interestingly, Walt Disney was extremelyanxious to make a cartoon using Debussy’s “Clair de Lune.” The work was done,but it was never shown to the public. Disney never found a place to use it. Itwas originally done with animation with flying cranes for the occultextravaganza Fantasia, but when the Fantasia ended up too long, Clair de Lanewas cut and shelved. It was again planned for the film Make Mine Music, but then“Blue Bayou” was substituted in. Walt used the “Le Sacre du Printemps” (“TheRite of Spring”) music for Fantasia. This piece of music was written AS a paganritual where a virgin sacrifices herself by dancing to death. Disney’s mobsterGunther Lessing had threatened Stravinsky if permission weren’t given for Disneyto use the piece of music, it would be used anyway. Dr. Julian Huxley gotinvolved in the production of Fantasia. Aldous and Julian Huxley are well knownby conspiracy researchers for their roles in the World Order. In the 1940’s and1950’s, the Illuminati began using Disney’s Alice in Wonderland and the Wizardof Oz films as programming bases for their total mind-controlled slaves. Alicein Wonderland had been done many years earlier by the Britishman William CameronMenzies (who also did Freemason H.G. Wells’ masonic forecast of the New WorldOrder entitled Things to Come in 1936, and the film Invaders From Mars.). In1944, Illuminati Kingpin William Randolph Hearst (with some minor help fromothers) funded the Motion Picture Alliance, and Walt Disney became a co-founderand its first Vice-President. In the early 1950’s, Walt turned his attentionfrom animated cartoons to other projects, such as True-Life-Adventures,television shows, and the creation of Disneyland. Seal Island was his first truelife adventure which was released to the general public on May 4, 1949, and soonwon Walt Disney an Oscar. Alfred and Elma Milotte had shot the film on someAlaskan Islands named Pribilof Islands. James Algar had put the movie together.In 1952, Walter spelled his named backwards to create the name of anothercorporation “Retlaw\". Roy and his family saw the move as an attempt to cut themout of the financial picture. In 1954, Walt Disney and ABC made an agreement.ABC would directly invest half a million US dollars as well as guarantee $4.5million in loans for the construction of Disneyland. This made ABC 1/3 owner ofDisneyland. In return, Walt Disney agreed to produce a regular television seriesfor ABC. Remember too that ABC’s president Leonard Goldenstein was a good friendof Ronald Reagan. On July 13, 1955, Walt and Lillian were attempting tocelebrate their 30th wedding anniversary at a park and restaurant. Walt got toodrunk to speak into the microphone, so he blew noisemakers into it, whileLillian rushed to pull him out of view. In 1961, Disney bought out the ABCinvestment (also labelled Paramount) for $7.5 million with cash and notes, andto bring this all up to date, later on July 31, 1995, Disney merged with CapitalCities/ABC, with Disney in nominal control. Actually Capital Cities has longbeen a CIA front company, so the merger placed Disney squarely within the CIAranks, although it had been in bed with them for the CIA’s entire history. TheIlluminati-controlled corporations of Coca-Cola and the drug firm Johnson andJohnson became sponsors for Disney’s early TV shows. On 7/3/57, the Wall St.Journal announced that Atlas Corp. got 26% interest in Walt Disney Productions.Walt Disney worked quietly with some consultants on the concepts behindDisneyland. His brother and nephew tried to prevent the project from happening.Later they requested that Walt sign over Disneyland, Inc. to Walt DisneyProductions, which Walt did. Walt kept 17.25 % of Disneyland holdings and WaltDisney Productions got the rest. Walt Disney Productions then shared theirportion with others. The man who helped Walt finance Disneyland was theexecutive vice-pres. of ABC Kintner. Walt Disney got the Illuminati’s StanfordResearch Institute to determine what would be the best site for Disneyland.A retired Navy admiral Joe Fowler was in charge of constructing both Disneylandand Walt Disney World. How do admirals fit into the power structure? Admiralsare briefed each day, and are given information concerning the secret powerstructure. Most men who are at that military level are Illuminati or at leastwell controlled by the system. Within the last few years there has been anintense effort to weed out any admirals who are not loyal to the Illuminati.Morgan-Evans, who lives in Malibu, and who may be of the famous Morgan clan, wasthe one who created the spectacular landscapes for Disneyland, Walt DisneyWorld, and EPCOT in FL.According to CIA informants opposed to the NWO, CIA contractors were brought into build the underground tunnels under Disneyworld in 1977. These contractorswere sworn to secrecy, but were only informed on a need to know basis why theCIA was involved with an amusement park. To work on the secret tunnel projecttook an \"Above Top Secret\" clearance. A major programming center was constructedunder Lake Holden. (Many of the lakes in Florida are named Lake So-and-So,rather than So-and-so Lake.) The tunnel system was built for programmingtrauma-based total mind-controlled slaves. It was built of concrete with steelreinforcement. Lake Holden lies just to the northwest side of the OrlandoInternational Airport and just south of Interstate 4. (It is close to Range 29Eon quad maps.) It is only (as the crow flies) about 12 miles from Disneyworld.In spite of Draconian measures of secrecy, numerous lawsuits (Fed. & State) werefiled over the years by victims trying to expose the Disneyworld programmingtunnels, so that finally the programming center was dismantled, cleaned up and a“maintenance\" tunnel level and a “casting\" tunnel level were opened to thepublic. During its heyday, the programmers (military & intelligence men) hadexotic offices underground with unusual programming equipment. It doesn’t takeany imagination to realize that if Disney carried mind-control programming aboveand below ground, that they would need tight security forces to protect theirsecrets. Indeed, such is the case. Disney amusement parks have been granteddraconian powers wherever they have been built! The Disney parks have alsoemployed armies of spies dressed like tourists to spy on Disney’s employees! Ifamusement park workers did anything slightly out of place, they were (and stillare) reported by the spies in the camp, and they often have lost their jobs. Forinstance, one ex-worker, who had 10 years with Disney, was caught discussing hisdivorce with another worker. Since divorce doesn’t fit the wholesome image thatDisney wants, when the spy dressed as a tourist reported his conversation, helost his job. Many workers have tried to tell their personal horror stories ofDisney’s draconian rules and their draconian private police force, but most ofthe time Disney has had the power to suppress and intimidate away any badpublicity. An exception to that is the recent Nov. 4, ‘96 Napa Valley Registerarticle on page 2D entitled, \"Critics of Disneyland Say Security Abusive InsideMagic Kingdom.\" UCLA law professor David Sklansky commented about Disney’spolice, \"One of the major problems we have is nobody really knows what they aredoing- how often they stop, interrogate or search people. They are not subjectto the same sort of regulatory controls.\" It’s almost superfluous to tellreaders that Disney’s amusement park with its theme areas such as Fantasyland,Tomorrowland and Adventureland were a great success. Everyone worldwide wascurious to visit this entertainment mecca to participate in something that had aclean, wholesome image to it. The entire world system pulled together to insurethat Disneyland got the image and publicity that the top 13 Illuminati familiesand the various syndicates wanted it to have. For 40 years they’ve done this.When something that everyone thinks is clean and wholesome is not attacked bythe world system that should raise eyebrows among thinking people. Homeschooling, learning to read phonetically and other wholesome activities forchildren have been viciously attacked and ridiculed by the established media.Why has Disney gone untouched? Disney Studios for years strove to have a veryclean image. Workers had dress codes, and any activity on the part of employeesthat wasn’t morally conservative was grounds for instant dismissal. Of course,the exceptions were well covered up, such as an employee who used hypnosis toget quite a few of the females employees to undress until nude. John L. Hulteng,author of The Messenger’s Motives (Englewood Cliff, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1976, p.213) informs us, \"As communication researchers have emphasized, the greatestimpact the media have on the formation or change of public opinion is in termsof impressions built up over a long period.\" The wholesomeness of Disney is animage that has been built over a long period of time. Disney’s occult themes ofworld citizenship, witchcraft, humanism and idolatry have also been long runningimpressions that have been craftily perpetrated upon this nation, so long thatthey began prior to this author’s, and probably the reader’s, birth.People don’t associate movie’s like Consenting Adults with Disney, or The CorpseHad a Familiar Face with Disney. In fact as previously mentioned, when Disneywanted to put out more \"adult\" films, they did a slight of hand and created thelabel Touchstone films so that people wouldn’t associate movies like Splash(which showed what looked like bared breasts) with Disney Productions. Anotherlabel, Hollywood Pictures, was created by Disney to help distribute Touchstonefilms. At first the personnel of these companies was simply Disney’s staff, butas time went on, they got their own production personnel.On Oct. 27, 1954, Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color debuted on television.The TV show celebrated Disney’s movie triumphs. The words “Wonderful World ofColor” are not ill chosen. According to an Illuminati mind-control programmer,when Disney worked on his cartoons, and amusement parks, colors --special colorsand color combinations--were specifically chosen for mind-control programmingpurposes. Wonderful World of Color under various names such as Disneyland airedfor 22 years over the television networks. In 1955, Walt Disney made his cartooncharacter Mickey Mouse real by creating a fan club--the Mickey Mouse Club, whichaired five days a week usually just as children came home from school.Twenty-four children called “Mouseketeers” would help Mickey, and they woulddance and sing and do skits. The Mickey Mouse Club adored the unique, cutelittle beanie Mickey Mouse caps with their big ears mounted to each side of thebeanie. In the 1950’s, most kid viewers of the show wanted their own \"MouseEars\" and to become a Mouseketeer, especially children who were receiving MickeyMouse scripts in their total mind-control programming. Disney used hisMouseketeers to play all the roles in an Oz movie Rainbow Road to Oz, which wasnever shown to the public. Adults today (both men and women) who received MickeyMouse programming during the 50’s through 70’s can still be seen with MickeyMouse clocks, watches, lampshades, knick-knacks, tee shirts, etc. Years laterthe kids who watched can still remember \"Spin and Marty\" and the Mickey Mousetheme song. The image that everything was perfect including Mickey was portrayedby the Club’s T.V. program. Still somehow the American people began to use theword \"Mickey Mouse\" as a synonym for a silly, pretend way of doing things. Itbecame common for people to say, \"He mickey-moused it together.\" to mean he dida poor job putting it together. On Jan. 30, 1957, Walt Disney had a televisionshow aired entitled All About Magic where a Magic Mirror explains about magic.The Magic Mirror also contains a \"Bibbidi-bibbidi-Boo\" sequence.In 1959, Disney bought eight small submarines from Todd Shipyards for $2,150.000.When ABC wouldn’t let Walt make a TV series out of a storyline where a magicring changes a boy into a dog (a mind-control programming theme)--because ABCdidn’t think the public could swallow the story line--Walt quit ABC for NBC.Walt then made a scaled down version of this occult storyline entitled TheShaggy Dog. Early in the 1960’s, Walt and his brother Roy went secretly lookingfor an area on the east coast to build another Disney Park. Walt the younger ofthe two, died in 1966, and Roy finished the project. Beginning in 1964, 30,000acres were secretly purchased at $200 an acre in the Orlando, FL area just westof NASA’s Cape Kennedy. Using phoney names and paying cash, Disney buyers boughtthe land and swore the sellers to secrecy. The Magic Kingdom has beenmultiplying. In 1971, Walt Disney World was opened to the public. Bob Hope andothers participated in a Disney special on Oct. 29, 1971 \"Grand opening of WaltDisney World\". From the time of its opening until Oct. 12, 1995, Disney Worldcalculated 1/2 billion people visited DisneyWorld. This amusement park is inOrlando, FL on over 27,400 acres and includes the EPCOT Center (now also calledsimply Epcot). The EPCOT center was another dream of Walt Disney’s (albeit morethan slightly modified from Walt’s original EPCOT ideas.) EPCOT originally stoodfor Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. It was to be an extension ofthe massive mind-control being carried out at Disney World. The original EPCOTcity designed by Walt was to carry on its commerce (traffic) via undergroundroads and tunnels like the Disney Theme parks. After Walt Disney died, hissuccessors changed the proposed experimental city into another theme park simplycalled Epcot. It is not unusual to see crowds of over 48,000 people descend onWalt Disney World and the EPCOT center in a single day. Some visitors arrive viaa monorail. Visitors can buy 5-Day World Hopper passes which allow them tobounce around with admission to all the sites for a seven day period. In otherwords, some families stay for a week at Disneyworld. Hardcore visitors can getAnnual Passports which provide unlimited use of Walt Disneyworld for an entireyear.In reality, many visitors to Disneyworld begin the day enthusiastic and after aday of hot sun and waiting in long lines with large crowds for imitations ofreality, the tourists are zombie-like and looking forward to getting back totheir hotels. Many people have felt the rides were not nearly what theyexpected. Some of the rides are better than others, and some typically getcomments like, \"It was stupid.\" Some of the spooky events like Snow White’sAdventures, or the oversized heads of the Disney characters walking around canleave the little preschool children terrified and dazed for the rest of the day.In contrast, older children, who normally rarely show patience at home may showhow much they want to go on a particular Disney ride, by waiting an hour and ahalf in the hot sun for a ride. Alien Encounter is a Walt Disneyland featurethat invites tourists in for a \"demonstration of interplanetary teleportation.\"When the \"demonstration\" as planned \"breaks down\" an “alien\" with asocial traitsappears among the audience and terrorizes the audience. A cute creature ishideously fried, deformed, and then vomited into space screaming. Here are somecomments from visitors to this Walt Disneyland attraction: * \"Alien Encounter ...is one of those rides I can say I’ve seen and that I have no intention of ever doing again. In fact, parents who take children under the age of six should be brought up on child abuse.\" * Woman, from Alien Encounter was the WORST experience for my 10-year-old (and almost every child in there). It starts out cute enough during the preshow, but the actual show is a disaster for children. My daughter screamed and cried in terror throughout it. I thought the Disney warnings were vague and inaccurate. When we left, there wasn’t one child with dry eyes (even sturdy looking 12-year-old boys were crying.). I think an age requirement of 13 or 14 is more appropriate. I talked to a few adults and we even agreed that the special effects were extremely unpleasant even for us. This show is not a Disney family experience--it’s ATROCIOUS!!\" * A mother from Phillipsburg, NJ.\"We did go to Alien Encounter...The preshow is deceiving. It kind of lulls you into thinking \"this isn’t so bad.\" When the main part came up, I admit the experience gave me the absolute heebie-jeebies. . .I am never doing that presentation again--it was way too intense for me, and I’m now 27 years of age!--from a family in Laurel, MD Michael EisnerThe President of Walt Disney Co., initially rejected Alien Encounter for notbeing scary enough when it was being considered as an addition to Disneyworld.One wonders what he would have liked! Snow White’s Adventures, which was anattraction at Disneyland, was one of what the Disney people called \"dark rides\".After a while a sign appeared with a witch warning people that the attractionwas scary. Later in 1983, they renamed it “Snow White’s Scary Adventures.” Itmight be interesting to point out that when the original Snow White and SevenDwarfs film came out, that England forbid the film to be seen by any child under16 unless accompanied by an adult because of the scary content of the movie. Howfar we have come since then. Schools in the Florida and California areas alsomake field trips to the Magic Kingdom that are arranged with Disney. EPCOTreceives tens of thousands of children this way during March, September andOctober. High schools use the Magic Kingdom for proms or senior nights, and somecouples use the facilities of the Magic Kingdom for weddings. Modem Bride rankedOrlando as the number-one honeymoon destination in the world. Group discussionsof people who took honeymoons to DisneyWorld have had a consensus that the hypeis not as great as the reality. Some weddings are done with cartoon characters.Disney offers \"fairy-tale\" wedding packages. A great deal for twomind-controlled slaves. They can reinforce their programming while gettingmarried. The Disney fairy-tale wedding typically has its ceremony on a pavilionon an island in the Seven Seas Lagoon with the Cinderella Castle as a backdrop.The fairy-tale wedding can then be followed with a Fantasy reception with achoice of themes such as Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin. The fantasyprogramming can continue as the bride is delivered to a \"Cinderella’s Ball\" byan actual glass carriage drawn by six white Disney ponies. A costumedfairy-godmother and stepsisters are also at the ball. Desert is served in awhite chocolate slipper.One of the after-dark shows is IllumiNations which consists of music, fireworks,erupting fountains, special lighting, and laser technology done at the WorldShowcase Lagoon. EPCOT has a show Cranium Command at the Wonders of Life in theFuture World section where guests sit in a theater that functions as a commandcontrol room for a boy’s brain. In 1980, Disney came out with the box officeflop The Devil & Max Devlin. In 1984, Roy E. Disney brought in Michael Milken,of junk bond fame to help Disney out financially. In 1985, Disney bought MGM’srights to the “Leo the Lion” logo and began using the MGM Wizard of Oz material.Later a remake of Alice in Wonderland came out in the modern motif of Honey, IShrunk the Kids!. In the 1990’s, Illuminati controlled companies continued theirpromotion of Disney. For instance, the Nestle family’s Nestle Company promotesDisney movies on their chocolate bars. The Nestle family is exposed in thisauthor’s booklet “Illuminati Control Over Foods and Grains”, p. 4 as one of theelite Black Nobility families. In 1996, Walt Disney World created an actualresidential town named Celebration on its property. This self-containedcommunity has 20,000 and a school, a theater, a fiber optic information networklinking business, as well as other features.Some Disney People of Interest.Over the years, the close associates of the Disneys’ is very revealing. Thepublic can get a feel for Disney’s attitude toward Illuminati bloodlines in theDisney movie The Happiest Millionaire which is about Anthony J. Drexel Biddleand Angie Duke. Readers of this author’s previous writings will recognize theBiddle and Duke names. In fact, the movie was based loosely on a book written byCordelia Drexel Biddle about the Biddles. * X Atensio. His first name was Xavier, but was nicknamed and called X. He worked on the haunted mansion of Disneyland with WED enterprises. He joined Disney in 1938, and was an assistant animator of Fantasia. * Warren Beatty. (b. 1937 in VA) This actor is from the Illuminati Beatty family and starred in Disney’s Dick Tracy. The Dick Tracy film uses color in a special way, and this ties in with the color programming of the mind-control. Some total mind-controlled slaves have programming based on Disney’s Dick Tracy movie for them to track down and kill \"targets\" (people). Warren’s sister is the famous (or infamous) Shirley Maclaine. Shirley \"MacClaine\" is not what she appears. Her father was a professor who was a CIA asset. She was used by the CIA as a sex slave. She became popular with the studios because she went to bed with the correct people. Her talents were used to get her as an intelligence slave into places that an obvious intelligence agent couldn’t go. She was married to a man in the NSA for nearly 20 years. Her adopted name Maclaine (reportedly her mother’s maiden name) is a pun on McLain,, VA where the CIA programmed her. She was used by the CIA in an operation in Australia, where the CIA used her as a sex slave to compromise Andrew Peacock, an Australian MP so that they could establish the Nugen-Hand bank for their dirty money laundering etc. She is friends with Satanist Stephen Nance who has provided her with some of her teachings. Lowell McGovern writes her material. The CIA has programmed many of their New Age slaves to adore Shirley MacLaine. An example of this is Christa Tilton, one of their mind-controlled slaves, who revealed in an interview how she considered herself a born-again Christian who had spent most of her life in Oklahoma, but had mysteriously been drawn to Shirley MacLaine. During her life she has gotten repeated \"psychic urgings\"--that is strong urges to do things and go places, which she doesn’t understand where these urgings came from. After hypnosis, Christa drew pictures of the doctor who programmed her. Christa has had a federal agent monitor her constantly. Her husband has seen this agent, who has shown up on her door step and made calls to her. She names the agent John Wallis (most likely a cover name). This agent has a complete knowledge of her life, and government agents have taken photos of her during her supposedly \"alien abduction\" experiences. Christa is just one of hundreds of victims who have been programmed to adore Shirley MacLaine. (Christa is mentioned here because she is one case that this author is familiar with.) Warren Beatty, who peppers his speech with four-letter words was a student at the Stella Adler Theater Studio in NYC. * Black, Shirley Temple. Shirley Temple Black sat on the Disney board of directors (74-75). Her films were used for some of the early 40’s and ‘50’s programming and teaching slaves body movements/dance. She married someone in an elite Network family from San Francisco named Charles A. Black. Charles A. Black was a Lt. Col. in the Pentagon who lived at Bethesda, MD. Was Shirley an early example of brain-stem scarring to get geniuses? Shirley’s brother appears to have developed \"Multiple Sclerosis\" from brain stem-scarring. It was Shirley Temple who co-founded the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, and was a member of its exec. committee. Shirley represented the U.S. at the UN General Assembly in 1969, belongs to the Sierra Club, and has been decorated with the Cross of Malta. Shirley has shown clues that she may be an Illuminati mind-controlled child protégé. * Stephen Bollenbach. Bollenbach was part of Walt Disney management, and was a key figure who helped engineer Disney’s $19 billion buyout of the CIA’s Capital Cities/ABC, as well as sell the idea to Eisner. He is the CEO of the Network’s Hilton Hotels Corp. He recently has been involved with trying to buy ITT, in order to put together the world’s largest hotel-casino combination. Bollenbach has an extensive background with the gaming-gambling industry. When the Justice Dept. began looking into the merger of Disney with Cap. Cities/ABC, Bollenbach resigned his Disney position. Some people feel his resignation was needed for Disney to get the Justice Dept. to approve the merger, because his past was vulnerable to be exposed. * Warren Buffett. A major stockholder in Walt Disney. He also owns 40% of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. which also owns lots of shares of Disney stock. According to S.F. Examiner, Buffett himself owns 24 million shares of Disney. Warren Buffett is part of the Ak-Sar-Ben fraternity and Monarch slave abusers who were exposed in the Nebraska Saving & Loan scandal. He is perhaps the second richest man in the nation, and too powerful for anyone to touch. In the kingpin vs. kingpin battles, some people close to the inside see Buffett as a good guy. Readers need to study the Lincoln Savings & Loan scandal and the scandals connection to programmed child slaves at Boy’s Town to get more information on this Disney stockholder. Robert G. Hagstrom, Jr., who is the portfolio manager of the mutual fund Focus Trust, which has shares in Walt Disney, wrote the book The Warren Buffett Way. Hagstrom has a chapter on Disney in his The Warren Buffett Way. He quotes Buffett as extremely enthusiastic about Disney’s merger with Capital Cities/ABC. Because of his enthusiasm Buffett says, “The odds are extremely high that we will have a very large amount of Disney stock.\" * Salvador Dali--This strange surrealist Spanish artist was a friend of Walt Disney. After Salvador was kicked out of Spain for Franco’s belief that he was a communist, he came to America, and worked with Disney Studios in 1946. Salvador, an eccentric who had no particular work habits, described himself, \"The only difference between me and a madman is that I’m not a madman.\" * The Tommy Dorsey Band--This band has had a number of men in it who are mind-control slave abusers associated with the Network. Frank Sinatra, a sexual slave user, got his big break with this band. This band performed at Disneyland in 1984 at the Plaza Gardens. Tommy Dorsey was part of the Network’s in-crowd. When he was on a USO Tour with Bob Hope, he stabbed actor Joe Hall and threw him out of a window. Joe had to have 32 stitches. But Joe didn’t get justice, the judge dismissed his case against Tommy. Michael Dammann Eisner, Chairman at Disney is a CIA asset and connected to the mob. Some insiders believe he is connected to elements of the CIA & mob that are anti-NWO. Even so, these anti-NWO factions also employ mind-control. Eisner ignored a threat by Red China to boycott Disney products if he made a movie about the nation Tibet that China controls with draconian force. The U.N., the Commerce Dept. and the State Dept. all tried unsuccessfully to get him to back down on the film. A paper trail connecting Michael Eisner and Walt Disney Co. to mind control is their support of the Boys & Girls Club of Napa Valley, which is used for a supply of children for pedophilia and mind-control. The Boy’s & Girls Club is used to supply caddies for the Silverado Country Club, where these children are also used as mind-controlled slaves for the sexual perversions of the elite. Notice that Napa’s Silverado Country Club invites in celebrities (such as CIA asset Pat Boone, Joe DiMaggio ex-husband of sex slave Marilyn Monroe, Engelbert Humberdinck a slave handler, Digger Phelps Notre Dame’s coach who uses slaves, and Jack Vale the CEO of Motion Picture Assoc. & Bohemian Grover) for a golf tournament which is billed as a “benefit for the Boys & Girls Club\". The benefit for child slaves is they get to caddie and sexually service elite perverts. Michael (bn. March 7, ‘42 in NY) came from old American money of a family that has been rich merchants and lawyers. Michael grew up in luxurious Park Ave. as well as his family’s \"country place\" in Bedford Hills near Mt. Kisco, NY. He went to an elite private school Allen-Stevenson, which is famous for its children’s orchestra. At the age of 14, he then went to Lawrenceville School, which is a prep-school for Princeton, whose tuition in ‘56 was $3,000. Eisner’s class incl. NY’s governor’s son, and other sons of powerful men, such as the son of Saudi Prince Turqi al-Faisal. The school is a prep school for the establishment’s entertainment industry. Students are only allowed to see their parents on major holidays. Eisner was in the Periweg Club, the school’s drama society. His poor scholastic performance meant that he had to go to a small liberal arts college, rather than Princeton or Harvard such as was family tradition. For instance, his grandfather had attended Phillips Exerter Academy and Harvard. His grandfather has serve in many govt. commissions and belonged to the Harvard Club, the American Club in London as well as some yacht clubs. Between his junior & senior year in high school, Eisner was a page at NBC’s HQ in the Rockefeller Center. In 1966, he landed a job in the programming department of ABC. He had an influential position. Eisner had one good break for deciding TV programming. He was 21 when the target audience was 21 years old, and when he was 35, the target age of the film industry was then 35. He has been described as having \"supernatural enthusiasm\" coupled to a lifetime quest for untested ideas. * Rich H. Frank, was Executive Vice-President with Walt Disney until his sudden resignation about a year before this was written. He worked side by side with Katzenberg and left after Katzenberg resigned in a dispute with Disney’s chairman Eisner. Rich Frank was President of Walt Disney’s TV-Media Division. He acquired the estate of VanHoffenwiggen, when VanHoffenwiggen fled the country and vanished when Lendvest began to be exposed. VanHoffenwiggen was a major figure involved with Lendvest Mortgage Inc., a drug-laundering operation and drug smuggling operation operating out of Napa Valley. It was also the fastest growing real estate mortgage company in northern California until its drug smuggling began to be exposed. Lendvest did some tricks ala Nugen Hand Bank. Millions of dollars of investors and creditors have disappeared leaving lots of hurting people, and the mortgage company filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy court, and is still in operation. International financier Edmond Safra’s private bank, the Republic National Bank of NY, launders money from the Medellin drug cartel. Safra’s bank sent Lendvest lots of crisp new $100 bills. The Safras are tied in with the Rothschilds. (The Safras are reportedly recent property owners in St. Helena near Napa (through Good Wine Co. which is the Spring Mountain Wineries), near where Lendvest was HQed. Edmond’s nephew, Jacob Safra, has a partnership in Napa Valley’s Good Wine Co. The Rothschild’s Citicorp gave Republic National Bank the transaction ability to issue international (world) bearer bonds (\"bank notes\") The Luxembourg/Belgium branch of Bank Nacional de Paris issued a bearer bond that was connected the Lendvest drug running operation. In Britain, a U.S. citizen Mike Spire ran the British operation of Lendvest and InVest. LandVest’s parent was InVest which has operated in the U.K., Switz., Saudi Arabia & Paraguay. Long story made short, Lendvest has been an international CIA-Mafia drug running operation, with Illuminati overtones and connections to it. With all this in mind, it is strange, that Walt Disney’s President of its TV-Media Division, Rich Frank, bought the palatial mansion of John 0. VanHoffenwiggen after VanHoffenwiggen disappeared from the country when indictments and arrests began to be made of people connected to Lendvest. According to insiders, Rich Frank is also one of a number of Napa Valley people involved in illegal labelling of wines. Rich Frank was a key figure in Disney’s programming venture with three regional Bell Telephone companies (Ameritech, Bell South, & SBC Commun.) coming together. Bell Telephone wanted to get into cable TV. Michael Ovitz formed a rival group of 3 other Bell Telephone co.s. Calvin Robinson, who tied in with Land Vest, worked with Boyce, who in turn worked for TRW Co., in Redondo Beach, CA. Boyce was sentenced to 40 years for selling US surveillance secrets to the soviets. * Daniel Hillis, the co-founder of a supercomputer producer Thinking Machines from MIT, is in charge of the Walt Disney Imagineering unit. Hillis helped Disney develop a virtual-reality ride at Disneyland based on the Aladdin cartoon. * Jeffrey Katzenberg, has been the chairman of Disney’s movie studio, is an aggressive worker, a model Type A person. “Ask 50 people to describe Jeffrey Katzenberg, and most will say tenacious. ‘If Jeffrey were any more aggressive, he’d be in jail.\" says the producer Dan Melnick.\" ( Harmetz, Aljean, “Who Makes Disney Run?”, NY Times. Feb. 7, ‘88, p. 29.) Katzenberg is the father of twins, which people joke was typical of his efficiency. Katzenberg supervised the production of Star Trek. Most of his movies have been box office successes. In the ‘70’s, Katzenberg worked for NY Mayor John Lindsay. * Sanford Martin Litvack. Sanford is the Executive Vice Pres. of Disney and in charge of \"Human Resources\" for the corporation. He is a jewish lawyer who was educated at the Jesuits’ Georgetown Univer. He is on the bd of dir, of Bet Tzedek. * Vincent Price. Price has been one of the major influential occultists who has provided the world with many occult horror books and scripts. He worked for Disney some, and was the voice for Ratigan in The Great Mouse Detective. Vincent Price’s good friend John Hay Whitney is an Illuminati kingpin and vice-pres. of the Pilgrim Society and was raised into the Illuminati through the Yale Scroll & Key fraternity. His friend Whitney likes horror movies. * The Osmond Brothers. Merrill Osmond’s boys were \"discovered\" at Disneyland when they were visiting the site in 1962. The Disney people on Main St. just \"happened\" to recognize the talent of the five boys and signed them up soon for their first professional singing contract. The Osmond Boys did some television appearances for Disneyland such as Meet Me at Disneyland, and Disneyland after Dark. (Considering the mind-control programming done to these Osmund children, these TV shows were a cruel joke.) Of the singing Osmond kids, Donny is the next to the youngest, and his sister Marie is the youngest. Both Donny and his sister Marie are programmed multiples who are slaves, who have been subjected to a lot of abuse. They have good front alters. Their father has made millions from drugs, porn and white slavery and is part of the Mormon Illuminati front. The Mormon front of the Illuminati has gotten a lot of good publicity off of the Osmonds. They sang for Andy Williams whose French wife was once arraigned on murder charges. Later they sang for the satanic Network’s Lawrence Welk show. Swedish accented Lawrence Welk has been part of the Network. Marie Osmond has grown up, and she has adopted three of her five children in spite of her busy singing schedule which includes approx. 200 singing shows a year at places like Mafia-controlled Atlantic City. In terms of occult families, adopted children are often programmed children, so this is a clue that her children have been programmed too. * Michael Ovitz. Ovitz was the #2 man at Walt Disney for a while until near the end of ‘96. Michael Ovitz was a high school classmate in VanNuys, CA with Michael Milken (later the junk-bond wizard), & there are many of the same people connected to both men. When Michael Ovitz’s National Mercantile Bancorp (a saving & loan) began getting into the quicksand of several lawsuits & scandals, attorney Robert Strauss represented him. Illuminati member Robert Strauss has been a lawyer connected with drug running & the mafia. He was also an FBI agent from ‘41 to ‘45 with Hoover. He is admitted to the Wash. D.C. bar. Pres. Bush appointed him U.S. Ambassador to Russia. He has been on the board of dir, of the Illuminati’s PepsiCo, Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), and General Instruments (which have been exposed in other writings by this author.) He was also a board member of the Illuminati-mafia run MCA. Strauss is seen in Wash. D.C. as a behind the scenes power broker. Strauss represented Michael Milken associate Ronald 0. Perelman, Chrmn. of Revlon, who made a $600 mil. killing off of the 1st Gibraltar S&L. Strauss represented MCA, which the Bronfmans took over in 1995. The book Knoedelsder, William. Stiffed: The True Story of MCA, The Music Business, and the Mafia. NY: HarperCollins Pub., 1993, does a good job of connecting MCA to the mob, the Network, and Iran Contra. See especially page 442. Time magazine 2/24/97 carried a page long story about Michael Ovitz being out of a job. In the article, they reported that he was spending time on his new yacht The Illusion, visiting Joe Silver’s estate in So. Carolina, visiting his property in Aspen, CO, and eating lunch with investment adviser Richard Salomon of Spears, Benzak, Salomon & Farrell. Gordon Crawford of the Capital Group is quoted in the article praising Ovitz, and saying he would invest in an Ovitz venture. Ovitz is believed to be mafia by people in a place to know. He has also been known to threaten people using mafia terms, for instance, Vanity Fair (12/’96, p. 272) reports Ovitz threatening Bernie Brillstein, a producer, with his \"foot solders\". The San Francisco Chronicle (Fri., 1/26/’96, p. D20) quotes the latest issue of Columbia Journalism Review about an incident where a reporter Anita Busch who was investigating Ovitz got violently sick from the MSG in her food as she interviewed him. To top off it all off, Ovitz followed up her story which questioned his actions, by sending her a gift wrapped package of MSG with a one-word note: \"Enjoy.\". Michael Ovitz has had the clout to deal with Illuminati kingpin Edgar Bronfman head to head. He requested & got Bronfman to keep his dad employed, which was dutifully done. Edgar Bronfman Jr. had seriously considered having Ovitz head Seagram’s MCA/Universal conglomerate. * Frank G. Wells. Frank was the President & the Chief Operating Officer of The Walt Disney Co. Wells was also on Disney’s board of directors. He was a Rhodes Scholar, and a lawyer in 1955. Those who have read previous books (such as Vol. 1) by this author know how the Rhodes Scholars fit into things & are part of the Illuminati. He worked closely with Eisner & Katzenberg. Frank died in a helicopter crash in the spring of 1994 while heli-skiing in Nevada. His surviving sister is Molly Wells Chappellet who runs around in Illuminati circles. Molly Wells Chappellet has been featured several times in Betty Knight Scripp’s magazine Appellation. Betty Knight Scripp was married to a Bohemian Grove member. Betty has been good friends with: the late Pamela Harriman (who was a recent U.S. ambassador to France & connected to the Rothschilds), as well as good friends with Her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess of Vladmir of Russia, who owns the Chateau Margaux in Bordeaux. Betty Scripps personally monitors with care what is put into her incredible magazine Appellation. She has a column \"Who’s Who in the Wine Country\" where the Chappellets have appeared in print numerous times. * Nearly all of Disney’s 1920 movies had a black cat in them. Many had occult slants to the scripts. The occult slant never departed from Disney themes.Some of Disney’s Blatantly Occult Movies. * Aladdin. A wisecracking allpowerful genie is shown. * Bednobs & Broomsticks. (1971) A witch finds a magic formula from a lion king. The magic formula raises a ghostly army of armor in a museum which stops a band of German commandos. * Beyond Witch Mountain. (1982) A pair of twins leave Witch’s Mountain and have to use their special occult powers to outwit a character named Deranian. * Black Cauldron, The. (1985), A Horned King uses his magic to fight a clairvoyant pig and the pig’s keeper. This animation cost $25 million, but was a box office failure. * Bride of Boogedy. (1987) An evil spirit visits the Davis family and puts the father under a spell. Directed by Oz Scott. * Child of Glass. (1978) A glass doll must be found to set a ghost free in a haunted house. * Gnome-Mobi1e, The (1967). A multimillionaire and his grandchildren encounter gnomes. In the end the multimillionaire deeds the forest to the gnomes for eternity. * Halloween Hall of Fame (1977). Jack-o-lanterns come to life. * Halloween Treat (1982). Cartoons about Halloween. This was followed the next year with a film Haunted Halloween which talked about the origins of Halloween. * Misadventures of Merlin Jones. (1964) A genius tries to help other students. He tries to also use hypnotism & ESP which backfire on him. * Richest Cat in the World. (1986) A wealthy man leaves his fortune to his cat, who the relatives later discover can talk.H. Disney and Its Mob ConnectionsWhen this author spoke to the co-author’s deeper Illuminati alters about Disney,their reaction was that Disney had been described to them when they were in theIlluminati as \"a syndicate within a syndicate.\" They said that while in theIlluminati, they were aware that Disneyland had their own government, their ownrules and their own police force. They were a crime syndicate within asyndicate. What these Illuminati alters casually mentioned, was verified by thisauthor the hard way through research. One Disneyland Security Supervisor said,\"There is no Constitution at Disneyland. We have our own laws.\" Once, when WaltDisney got miffed at a Hollywood policeman, Walt said, \"I’ll have your badge.\"If Disney guards decide to, they will get very rough physically with people, andassault them in any fashion they see fit. The people they detain are oftenthrown into tiny cells at Disneyland where they are kept without benefit of aphone call, without benefit of a toilet or water. The judicial system turns ablind eye to whatever Disney police do. Many people pay Disney to get theirchildren out of a Disney cell, and never get due process of any law. This typeof treatment has gone on for decades, and is almost a daily occurrence atDisneyland. The Anaheim Police force is very chummy with the Disney privatepolice force. Also at one point, the Burbank Chief of Police was thebrother-in-law to Disney’s Chief of Security. Recently, when a couple filed awrongful death suit against the Magic Kingdom of Disney in Florida, the state ofFlorida surprisingly has appeared to have backed off from their traditionalbehavior of protecting Disney’s sovereignty. An article on the suit said,\"\"there is evidence of some nervousness with Disney’s relative autonomy.\"\" (SanFrancisco Chronicle, article \"Mickey’s Dark Side\" Oct. 1, ‘96, p. C6) Anattorney in the case said, \"Disney World’s security people aren’t just cops,they are bad ones. I don’t think there is any corporation that has ever had theperceived power that Disney has.\" Richard Foglesong, a professor of politics atRollins College in Winter Park stated,\"Because Disney World controls so much of its corporate and municipal universe,it can’t help but act in a heavy-handed manner in order to ferociously protectits self-interest. They have immunity from state and local land use law. Theycan build a nuclear plant, distribute alcohol. They have powers localcommunities don’t have. Do they abuse it? In my opinion, yes.\"In line with Disney’s previous dictatorial policies on their properties,Disney’s new city called Celebration will not have any elected government. Sincethe city is unincorporated (a neat Disney trick) the mayor is appointed byDisney. Several Disney \"quasi-government’\" bodies control citizens of the city.For instance, the Celebration Residential Owners Association, which participatesin binding all residents to a Declaration of Covenants, a legal binder of rulesthat residents must live by. Of course the Declaration of Covenants was writtenby Disney. These rules include such nitpicky things as, no more than two peoplecan sleep in the same bedroom, no pickup trucks can be parked in front of homes,and if Disney officials don’t like your cat or dog they can forcibly remove theanimal from your home. Disney Corp. has perpetrated numerous deceptions on theresidents, incl. shoddy work on their homes, and operating their \"\"public\"\"school with Disney cronies. Still, the residents that have moved intoCelebration are glowing with praise for the town in spite of the fact that thecity is totally run by Big Brother Disney Corp. Of course those who don’t loveit, soon leave. So much for the American tradition of self-government.Some Mob History.Traditionally, the mob crime bosses have had a yearly summit. In 1928, they hadtheir yearly conclave at Cleveland. In 1929, they had their secret yearlyconclave at Atlantic City. In 1931, they held their secret annual conclave atWappingers Falls, NY. At the Wappingers Falls meeting, attended by about 300overlords and soldiers, the heads of the family clans discussed their crimefamily agendas. They decided where the first national Mafia convention was to beheld. Once the Mafia was able to hold their yearly private national meetings,they were able to coordinate their activities, as well as decide such things as: * the direction of national & internal operations, and long range plans; * the promotion of new bosses; * decisions on turf and rank, commodities and cash; * hashing out alliances or disputes with the Mishpucka, Triads, FBI, Illuminati, etc. and working with others in a concerted manner.The mafia clans would then leave the annual summit meetings and follow throughin their area of operations, until they would meet the next year, review theirsuccesses and failures, get new assignments, and decide upon new short & longterm goals. In 1927, the Mishpucka worked with Mafia to highjack a bootlegshipment of whiskey travelling from Ireland to Boston for the Kennedy Illuminatifamily. Most of Kennedy’s guards were killed in the shootout, and J.P. Kennedyhad the widows of the guards besieging him for financial assistance. BillyGraham’s good friend Mafia Chief Joseph Bonanno was one of the chiefs whoattended the yearly conclaves. He also met with J.F. Kennedy in the winter of1959. John Kennedy was known to have said that mobster Sam Giancana worked forhis Kennedy family. The mob/Illuminati alliances and infighting are too complexto deal with in this book, but both groups had to put plans into action to dealwith the repeal of Prohibition, which would end their lucrative bootlegging. Theshort term plan for the Mafia was to control the film industry in Hollywood, andto penetrate the unions better. The long term plans called for sending theirnext few generations of children off to the top schools and getting them intolegitimate respectable corporate positions. By learning the ins and outs ofhonest, legal operations, they could then mix in the illegal operations withtheir legal ones & look legal. They planned to extend their power base intopolitics, the Harvard-Stanford business schools, as well as the finest corporateboard rooms. They intended (and have succeeded) in getting some of theiroffspring to produce/direct T.V./films. They would have an increasing presencewithin the Bohemian Grove membership, as well as some of the other great social& business clubs. Their plan to take over the film industry hinged on theirunion control over unions and theaters. The Chicago mob controlled theInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Union. The mob controlledthe projectionist’s union, and if the film makers had the theaters where theirmovies were shown shut down, what good would it be to make movies? The filmmakers and the mafia both had power & money. Rather than fight a protracted war,they made a deal. The major studios would give about $50,000 a year to themafia, and the small ones $25,000, to be allowed to function. Other agreementswere also reached. Mob henchmen Willie Bioff and George E. Browne were moblieutenants who orchestrated the mob’s \"Hollywood takeover\".Time Magazine, Nov. 1, 1943, wrote,\"In the witness chair in Manhattan’s Federal Court sat bland, wily Willie Bioft[pronounced ‘Buy-off’], blackmailer, panderer, labor leader, and now starwitness against eight ex-pals, who are charged with shaking down $1 million fromthe movie industry.Question: ‘Was it true that Bioft once had a five-year plan for taking over 20%of Hollywood’s profits-and eventually 50% interest In the studios themselves?’Bioff (wistfully): ‘If we’d lasted that long, we would have.’Question: ‘Did you ever say you were boss of Hollywood and could make producersdo whatever you wanted?’Bioff: ‘Yes-and I could make them dance to my tune.’ “Although Bioff rolled over on his pals and ended up getting car bombed, thatdidn’t stop the mob/Mishpucka infiltration & control of Hollywood. (Bioff hadtried to save his public image by helping Walt Disney settle his labor disputewith the mob-led unions, but Walt wisely rejected his offer of help, and madesure he didn’t offend the Chicago mob leaders who were disgruntled with Bioff.)Hundreds of millions of dollars were poured by the Mafia & Mishpucka into realestate in southern California, by using legitimate local businessmen to launderthe money. Hollywood was declared a \"free zone\" where all the Mafia/Mishpuckafamilies could operate without a fear of a turf war. Let us backtrack slightlyto 1930. Columbia distributed Disney cartoons from 1930 until 1932, when Disneyswitched to United Artists, because Columbia wasn’t bothering to pay Disney themoney they owed. In 1930, Cohn, Pres. of Columbia Pictures, got Disney off thefinancial hook with Powers by intimidating Powers with some street toughscarrying a legal suit. If Disney wasn’t indebted to the mafia before, he was atthat point. Biographers have been puzzled why Disney went into such a traumaticdepression after Henry Cohn \"helped\" him. Tough guy Henry Cohn made sure Waltknew who was boss. His attitude was that Walt should be happy to be paid at allby him for the cartoons Walt supplied Columbia. After this, Walt would lockhimself in his room and weep uncontrollably for hours. He was impossible foranyone to get along with. He was unable to focus on anything, and would starefor long periods out the window. Biographers blame Walt’s behavior on the factthat his wife was pregnant. They also blame it on his friend Iwerks defection toanother company. Frankly, Walt had treated Iwerk like a dog, and deep down musthave known why Iwerk left such an abusive relationship. To claim that he weptfor hours day after day because he realized he might become a father is too muchto swallow. When Walt was asked years later about why he was so depressed hesaid it was the stress of the financial situation. Walt said, “I had a nervousbreakdown...Costs were going up; each new picture we finished cost more to makethan we had figured it would earn when we first began to plan it...I crackedup.\"This author submits to the reader that part of his breakdown may have indeedbeen the financial stress from having come under the heel of the mafia. They hadall the means to make or break him, and he had no choice but to surrender totheir overwhelming power to blackmail and destroy him OR to get out of thebusiness. What this did was place Walt in a position where his two strongesttraits had to clash--his overwhelming obsession to be his own boss, and hiscreative obsession to create animation which was wrapped up with his ego & hisdeep phobias and psychological needs. His mind couldn’t give up its independencenor its creativity without great mental anguish, and therefore Walt was verysaddened, knowing that he would have to admit defeat, and buckle under the heelsof the big boys. Just when he needed emotional support his wife was going tohave a child, and his best animator left. Walt had abandoned Iwerks yearsbefore, and Walt’s wife had wanted a child for some time. Iwerk’s departure andhis arriving child do not in themselves account for the long intense nervousbreakdown that Walt experienced. Biographers point out that Walt was veryreluctant to have children, and that he was impotent with women including hiswife much of the time. His impotency to carry out normal sex may help explainhis secret sexual habits. Walt’s masonic brother Carl Laemmle offered Walt agood deal to help him recover from Henry Cohn’s abusive control of Walt, butCarl wanted the copyright to Mickey Mouse in return for the help, and Waltwouldn’t part with Mickey Mouse. Instead, Walt signed a contract offered byJoseph Schenck of UA (United Artists), who was one of the Mafia’s illegal drugkingpins. In 1935, the mob’s illegal drug dealer Joseph Schenck went on to found20th Century, Inc. which later merged with Fox in ‘38 to form TwentiethCentury-Fox, whose board of directors would include two Illuminati kingpinsWilliam Randolph Hearst and Malcolm MacIntyre. Joseph Schenck’s brother NicholasSchenck and Marcus Loew merged Metro Pictures and Goldwyn Pictures and namedLouis B. Mayer as its head. Meanwhile over the years, MCA, headed up byIlluminati Kingpin Lew Wasserman gained a monopoly over the American filmindustry with the secret backroom deals that they made with Ronald Reagan’sScreen Actors Guild and Petrillo’s American Fed, of Musicians. (By the way, LewWasserman would try to revive Reagan’s acting career in the early ‘60’s. FrankSinatra and Walt Disney were both friends of Ronald Reagan, and all threebelieved in mind-control.) Ronald Reagan and Petrillo in turn worked with theMafia’s NCS Council of 9 (which incl. Anthony Accardo and Sam Giancana), whichat one point divided the U.S. into 24 mob territories. After J. Schenck went tojail (very briefly), he was replaced as Pres. of 20th-Cent. Fox by SpyrosSkouras. Before his arrest, while Schenck was still in charge of 20th-Cent. Fox,he made numerous offers to Disney for Disney to incorporate his studio as asubdivision of 20th-Cent. Fox. Disney worked for a few years with themdistributing his films, but he would not let go of trying to be independent. TheFBI and American Intelligence turned to the mob to help them as the U.S. enteredWW II. Perhaps Walt’s mob connection added impetus for his recruitment. Waltwent to a number of American Nazi meetings prior to Pearl Harbor. This authorbelieves from knowing Walt’s personality that Walt may have been on assignment,rather than a Nazi sympathizer. Still, why does one of Disney’s pre-Pearl harborcartoons display a swastika? Disney’s Epcot Resorts is close to the mob’sAtlantic City Board Walk with its nightclubs. The resort was designed by RobertA.M. Stern. (This author doesn’t know about Robert Stern, but there areprogrammed multiples and Illuminati members within the Stern family.) At WaltDisney World, the nightclub there was named \"Cage\", and then later ’8 TRAX\".Comedy Warehouse, which is a nightclub at Pleasure Island in Walt Disney Worldopened on May 1, 1989 and has used slave comedians as well having people who aremind-control abusers. On Feb. 11, 1987, Walt Disney Co. was reincorporated inDelaware. Delaware is the only state that allows total corporate secrecy. No onecan find out who really is running a Delaware corporation, and many othersecrets can be hidden under Delaware’s corporation laws. Capital Group hasconsiderable shares in Disney, as well as 29% of the shares of the RobertMondavi winery at 7801 St. Helena Hwy, Oakville, CA. Wellington Group and Mellonbank also have shares. Behind Capital Group are mob controlled groups likeDebartolo Reality Corp. and La Quinta Inns (a Bass bro. operation.) Sam Bronfmanoperates Sterling & Monterey Vineyards. There are countless people walkingaround that have felt the ruthless, impersonal, controlling, money-grabbing sideof the Disney Corp. Also, there are a number of journalists who have experiencedfirsthand the secrecy and paranoia that the Disney corporation has. Mostjournalists are not used to the secrecy that pervades Disney. Because Disney hasshaped the myths of America for several generations, the public takes moreconcern over who is running Disney, than they would other institutions. Becausemost of America believes in the image that the Illuminati have built for Disney,they are rooting for it to succeed.How the Disney Executives Have Figured Out How to Steal Land All Across the U.S.Over the years Walt Disney has developed several very sneaky reliable techniquesto acquire land. They acquire land through their executives and largestockholders and family members of the execs and stockholders. After all thedeals are made in an area, and when everything is in place over a period oftime, these people then turn their land over to Disney. Disney works withgovernment officials and local bankers to line up special deals so they cansucceed in their plans. After everything is lined up, the corporation announcestheir plans and goes forward. This methodology has been used repeatedly, forinstance the American History Theme Park in the Manassas Civil War battlefieldarea of Virginia for which Disney has acquired 1,800 acres and has access to atleast 1,200 more. In Nov. ‘94, after a new Virginia governor was elected, theVirginia \"Disney’s America\" project was announced, and Virginia voted almostinstantly for the money for transportation and infrastructure improvements tothe area so that Disney’s theme park would be viable. Disney set up 3 banks inNapa, CA. Their banks made loans to old families in the valley. The trusts andthe wills for these families were made up by Stanford Univ. grads. These peopleset on the boards of these banks or connect with the boards of these banks. Theycharge large fees, and know every trick in the book to rob people of theirestates and their living trusts. The Stanford grads, who connect in withintelligence agencies and the mob, use certain code words when they set up theirbusinesses, such as RESOURCE, EVERGREEN and PACIFIC. There are a number ofscared landholders who are being intimidated to sell their land in the NapaValley region.DISNEY and the GOVERNMENTJust prior to W.W. II, the FBI recruited Walt Disney. His job was to spy onHollywood or anything else that looked suspicious. Documents obtained from theFreedom of Information Act, in spite of heavy censoring, clearly show that WaltDisney became a paid Special Correspondent asset of the FBI. He reported to FBIagent E.E. Conroy. In 1954, Walt was promoted to Special Agent in Charge (SAC)which means others reported to him. After \"leaving\" the CIA, ex-DCI (ex-head) ofthe CIA William Hedgcock Webster became a lawyer for the Wash. D.C. based firmof Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy. In 1993, when news broke about WaltDisney’s FBI membership, ex-CIA head Webster worked with the Disney family tocover up to the public that Walt Disney was an FBI agent. Webster went on TV andhad interviews to spread the fabrication that Walt was not connected to the FBI.Why? One of the countless items that Disney was involved in was theinvestigation into the disappearance/rape of a six-year old child Rose MarieRiddle on 1/12/61. According to documents gotten from the Freedom of InformationAct, W.G. Simon was the FBI agent who met with SAC Walt Disney in L.A. about thecase. W.G. Simon has been one of those people who has been publicly lying byclaiming that Walt Disney never was an FBI agent. The paper trail provesotherwise. Why is it so important to the FBI and CIA to cover up that Walt wasan FBI agent? Walt also worked for the CIA, even though documentation of that isnot available. This author theorizes that the reason the FBI and CIA are sotouchy about letting people know that Walt worked for the government is that theNetwork knows how the FBI and CIA worked together to procure children formind-control programming purposes. Because Disney and Disneyland played such asenormous role in Mind-control, Disney’s connection to them, although on thesurface a seemingly minor fact, is in reality a minor fact setting on top of anenormous ghastly secret. When W.W. II started, the government incorporated theDisney studios into the war machine. The military paid Disney $80,000 for 20training cartoon, which cost Disney $72,000 to make. Disney studios also madesome secret films for the military. Mickey Mouse and Goofy cartoons were slantedto have war themes, for instance, the Goofy cartoon of 1941 The Art of SelfDefense and How to be a Sailor in 1944. Perhaps in honor of the contributionDisney had made to the war effort, \"Mickey Mouse\" was the password of the Alliesfor millions of men on the big D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944. Walt Disneyproduced a cartoon showing Donald Duck paying his taxes faithfully. The film wasentitled The New Spirit. It was very successful in getting Americans to complywith the IRS. In 1946, Disney made a film for the public schools for sexeducation entitled The Story of Menstruation. For the United Nations, WaltDisney created \"It’s a Small World\" attraction for UNICEF for the ‘64-65 World’sFair. This attraction was moved to the theme parks & has been a major featurefor mind-control. After learning of the enormous amount of mind-controlprogramming going on during afterhours in secret tunnels at Disney as well as inthe public facilities, it makes more sense why the Russian Premier NikitaKhrushchev would be denied a visit to Disneyland by the U.S. government \"due tosecurity considerations\" when he was visiting the U.S. in Sept. 1959. Khrushchevobviously had his own security working in tandem with American security and theintelligence people for whatever reason(s) didn’t want the complication of theseRussians going to a major programming site. Some powerful military men have beenconnected to Disney films. Two former commanding officers of the USS Alabamanuclear sub were technical advisors for the Disney film Crimson Tide. WaltDisney was tied to the U.S. government, and recent disclosures show that he wastied to the FBI. Walt used his FBI connection to destroy the life of ArtBabbitt, who had led the strike against Disney in 1940. Babbitt found thateverything he attempted in life after the strike was ruined by some hiddenpower. Was Walt part of naval intelligence attached to the FBI? Was he part ofthe FBI that is involved with child procurement and mind-control? In the 1950’sthe Illuminati began organizing covens on the West coast and began solidifyingtheir power. (This comes from several independent sources.) Likewise, it’s clearthat Disney didn’t have the clout in 1953 with local governments than it doestoday. Walt Disney was unsuccessful when he tried to get permission from thecity of Los Angeles and the Burbank City Council for the construction ofDisneyland (called “Disneylandia” at that time), in the Burbank area. OneBurbank councilman told Walt, \"We don’t want the carny atmosphere in Burbank.\"\"Inconsistently, within a few years they gave permission to Universal to build anamusement park in Burbank, which opened in 1964. Disney then ask the StanfordResearch Institute to locate a spot for Disneylandia (Disneyland), which theyfound at Anaheim. In recent years, Disney decided they wanted to build anotheramusement park (called “California Adventure”) across from Disneyland. In orderto do so, the Interstate highway will have to have changes, and the Anaheim citycouncil needed to approve the large 55-acre expansion. In contrast to theBurbank City Council in 1953, Anaheim’s City Council was enthusiastic about theexpansion in spite of lots of local opposition. The locals complained at councilmeetings to the City Council that the city had no business going hundreds ofmillions of dollars into debt to help a corporate giant. (Anaheim will issue$400 million in bonds.) Locals also raised concerns that the public schoolsystem in Anaheim is stressed to the breaking point where they are consideringgoing to half days, and that Disney Corporation should give as muchconsideration for the school children of Anaheim as they do to their Amusementpark. Disneyland’s Pres. Paul Pressler bragged about Disney’s new CaliforniaAdventure amusement park, \"Disney’s California Adventure” is really acelebration of the fun, the beauty, the people and the accomplishments of thismagical state. We really have set out to try to capture a bit of what theCalifornia dream is all about.\" (Sounds like the dream is to be wealthy andcontrol people. The elite would rather give us BREAD & CIRCUS than aneducation.)The Dragnet films were done in part at the Disney studios. In an Office Memofrom the 66-new LA SAC FBI agent to Hoover (12/16/54), which was obtained viathe Freedom of Information Act, the typed memo states, “Mr. Disney hasvolunteered representatives of this office complete access to the facilities ofDisneyland for use in connection with official matters...\" Historically, we nowknow that Disney’s use for \"official matters\" included mind-control."},{"pageContent":"J. Disney and Mind ControlOnce the reader is familiar with the programming scripts, the reader merelyneeds to watch the Disney Adventures in Wonderland that come on TV in themorning to see Disney mind-control at work. Within a few minutes one morning,this author had seen a white rabbit create \"a world in your mind\" (the quote iswhat the show said!) with a ring, watched Alice go through the mirrors, watcheda White Rabbit [the programmer] read a book to a little girl, and the TVlistener be told by the show \"The White Rabbit is our only hope!\" The deeperalters of Illuminati slaves who are programmed for espionage, for spying andblackmail, and seduction and assassination, are given programming to live in afantasy world. They never touch base with reality. Much of this type ofprogramming has gone on at Disneyland. Disneyland visitors are taken in a boatwhere dolls sing an around-the-world theme song \"It’s a small small world\".These doll world parts of the amusement parks are used for programmingassassination and espionage alters. The song and dolls play important roles inthese mind-control programming. Some slaves at around age 19, have this type ofprogramming tested to make sure it is solidly in place. The song “It’s a SmallWorld\" was composed by the Sherman brothers for Disney originally as a themesong for a ride at the ‘63-’65 NY World’s Fair. The Sherman brothers were talentthat Disney discovered. They were born in NYC, and both graduated from BeverlyHills High School. They wrote Disney songs for at least 29 films.Mind-controlled slaves, who repeatedly bump into each other, but don’t know why,will be found saying, \"It’s a small, small world.\" Both rituals & programming goon at Disney amusement parks during both the day & night. Steven Rockefeller andWalt Disney travelled and spent time together with Dr. Hadley Cantril, anestablishment expert on human behavior. (See There Was Once A Time of Islands,Illusions & Rockefellers. NY: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975.) When Walt Disneybegan Walt Disney World he sent Card Walker to the Florida capital to requestquid pro quo, and the governor gave it to Disney. What that meant is thatDisney’s property in Florida was totally controlled under Disney’s jurisdiction,they had their own laws, their own police force, their own hospitals, and theirown tax rate. No outside authority would interfere with Disney’s jurisdiction.Disneyworld’s finances would be untouchable and out of sight by the state ofFlorida. Never had so much power been given away. Disneyworld became its owncrime syndicate within the syndicate. Disney amusement parks are like a citywithin a city. They have their own security forces, and the local police allowthe Disney security forces to take care of their turf. Disney has their ownpolicies (laws). Some of the security forces can be identified in plain clotheswith clean-cut hair styles and have communication devices. The security forceshave a headquarters room where TV monitors display-live the exit points atDisney as well as other locations. America ‘s Most Wanted has a fairly largefile on children who have been kidnapped at Disney Amusement Parks. One mother,who got separated from her child when getting off a train, frantically, told aguard her child was missing. The guard took her to the monitor room, where theysaw the kidnapper carrying the child out of the park with the boy slumped overhis shoulder. In that short of a time, the kidnapper had drugged the child, cuthis hair different, and put a different shirt on him. (This anecdote was mentionin Inside the Mouse, pg. 52) As written before, White slavery is part of whatDisney is all about. This mother was one of the fortunate few who did manage tofind their kidnapped children. An insider states that the Disney police aredefinitely part of those moving and abusing innocent children brought in foroccult rituals. In addition, the Disney security forces spy on their ownemployees. Employees do not enter the theme parks like the visitors, nor do theymove around like the visitors. They have underground tunnels and undergroundentrances and facilities for that. One victim of total mind-control mentionedthat a tunnel entrance was at the Matterhorn Mountain at Disneyland. (TheMatterhorn was opened by Walt and his good-friend Richard Nixon, who rode in thefirst car down the mountain.) The Disney Productions has given the Illuminatithe cover to bring together Illusionists, magicians, and special effects artistswithout anyone being suspicious. Some of these men were able to apply theirtalents toward programming children. As an example of their talents, Disneyspecial effects artists were able to create 16 realistic-looking cadavers forthe 1989 film Gross Anatomy. Walt Disney, Inc. has teamed up with Los Alamos andSandia Labs, two other groups which are heavily involved in mind-control andpeople control to develop body scans, branding and access codes for the visitorsto Disney’s theme parks. Each of the Disney Theme parks, such as Disneyland,Disneyworld, Euro Disney, etc., have vast underground facilities. Theseunderground facilities allow many of the workers to get to the ride areas viaunderground passages. Each theme facility also has a vast infrastructureunderground in order to maintain it. The underground areas contain wardrobedesign and repair units, fitting rooms, restrooms, cafeterias, security units,computers, freight ramps, utility encasements, and large connecting tunnels. Theunderground areas also have programming rooms. They have their own power plantsand water systems and their own police force. Disney company employs 71,000people at several locations, tone recent TV show used the figure 40,000 Disneyemployees.] People are coming and going 24 hours at the Disney theme parks.Three shifts keep up the 24-hour business. The night crews maintain and repairthe parks for the thousands of people that will soon arrive in the morning.Disneyland makes a natural prop for carrying out mind-control. The items theysell are also natural props--such as the Goofy watch ($19.95) which has handsthat move backward to confuse a slave as to what time it is. Was Walt Disneyaware of how Disneyland was used for programming? There is no doubt. Disneylived much of nights at Disneyland, and had an apartment at the firehouse nearthe train station on Main St. At night, if he was not doing anything else, he’droam the grounds of Disneyland scribbling notes on his own distinctive bluepaper, which he’d leave for workers to follow the next day. The notes would saysuch things as \"Replace these flowers,\" or \"Move that bench\". (Prince of theMagic Kingdom, p. 25) Walt Disney knew everything that went on in his MagicKingdom. The Epcot Center and the Disney amusement parks market all kinds ofoccult triggers, including crystals, rainbows, wizards, etc. that reinforce theprogramming. The Epcot Center has two glass pyramids along with its \"Journeyinto Imagination\". Disneyworld has the Island of Atlantis on its sub tour.Fantasyland is one of the most used tours of Disneyland for mind-controlpurposes. It has carousels, merry music, an incredible castle, boat rides, storybook characters etc. Sleeping Beauty Castle with its blue turrets and goldspires is the central visual object of Disneyland. You cross a drawbridge to getinto it. Inside Fantasyland are Illuminati programming sites such as the MadHatter teacups, the King Arthur carousel horses, and Snow White’s forest.In the far corner of Disneyland’s New Orlean’s Square is the Haunted Mansion.This mansion is designed to frighten and scare, it has an ingenious design andmany special effects and illusions. Realistic ghosts, a screeching raven,howling voices, and other scary things welcome the visitor. Life size hologramsare created at the Haunted Mansion, and dance in sync with the music and thenfade out at certain points. There is a hologram of a woman’s head in a crystalball who chatters non-stop. A real good laugh for the programmers of a littlechild. When you are toward the end, you will have a chance to look into a mirrorwhere a hologram ghost will nestle up beside you. Star Speeder is another greatprogramming location at Disneyland. It was the creation of George Lucas and theDisney Imagineers. The technology is borrowed from Star Wars, and is similar toflight simulators used by the military to train pilots. Disneyland Hotel offersCharacter Breakfasts, where children eat breakfast with Disney characters, topeople who make special arrangements. U.S. Special Forces, which carries outmind-control, owns two hotels near Disney World, and the Mormons have one also.Knott’s Berry Farm with its Ghost Town, Amusement Park, and its Charlie Brownthemes and characters is near Disneyland. One of the Disney executives began oneof the most horrible trauma-based mind-control programming centers in LosAngeles called Magic Castle a comedy warehouse. This trauma center had horribletorture chambers. Children were brought in from South and Central America to beprogrammed at the Magic Castle. A brave L.A. policeman exposed the place--forwhich he lost his job, and eventually was able to get the site closed. One ofDisney’s recent ventures in their Disney Institute, which Newsweek labeled \"theDisneyland of the Mind\". (Newsweek, Mar. 4, 1996, p. A private club called Club33 at Disneyland located upstairs in the New Orleans Square is believed to beinvolved in mind-control. Cub’s Den supervises children’s activities at theWilderness Lodge Resort at Walt Disney World.At Disney-MGM studios the major attraction is the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.Guests take a strange scary trip through the hotel, where guests are finallysent into an elevator that drops out of control 13 stories. The ride has beenadvertised on TV. Disneyland now has a Temple to the Forbidden Eye--which issimply a Temple to the All Seeing Eye, the Illuminati symbol. Visitors, who havethe patience to wait in line, can strap themselves in for a ride that is like ajack hammer that jars the rider through a temple filled with snakes, rats, andmummies. One aerobics teacher couldn’t walk for three days after the jarringride, which comes across as “hokey\". The experience is more traumatizing thanfun, but then maybe that is what was intended.Disney Vacations for The EliteYears ago this author’s newsletters exposed Hilton Head Island, SC as a wateringhole of the powerful elite incl. retired generals and admirals, and the site forthe elite’s Renaissance Weekend \"meat market\". Remember, that at one time HiltonHead Island was private, with imported alligators in the water around it. Aperson was only allowed on the island by going through security gates with aclearance. In a later newsletter, Disney’s Hilton Head Island Resort wasmentioned. This resort, built by Disney Vacation Development, Inc., is locatedon a 15-acre private island linked to Hilton Head Island by a narrow bridge.Members to the Disney Vacation Club can exchange time for vacations at Disneyand other resorts around the world. Memberships cost minimum $9,412.MelodylandRight smack across from the entrance to Disneyland is the Assembly of God’sMelodyland Christian Center, the birthplace of TEN (Trinity BroadcastingNetwork). The Assembly of God denomination has been heavily infiltrated by theIlluminati, and has been heavily used as a front for programmed slaves. PaulCrouch, president of Trinity Broadcasting Systems, Inc., was affiliated withMelodyland in 1973 when TBS was getting started. At that time, Melodyland was arich heavily infiltrated charismatic church, with its share of programmedmultiples. In 1973, closet homosexual minister Jim Bakker, and his wife TammyFaye, a programmed multiple were with Paul Crouch in Anaheim at Melodyland. PaulCrouch had been the assistant pastor of Bakker’s home church in Muskegon, MI.Crouch’s right hand man was Alexander Valderrama, a charismatic Roman Catholic.TBS used an abandoned military base as their TV complex, using hangers asstudios. In the early 70’s, ABC put Bakker & Crouch’s early shows on theiraffiliate stations on Sunday morning. Bakker had already gotten his careerkicked off with Illuminatus Pat Robertson and his 700 Club. Jim Bakker split andwent to the east coast. To help Bakker with his money, Bill Perkins, who hadbeen a financial analyst for the World Order’s mind-control research at SandiaNational Labs in Livermore came to help Bakker run his ministry’s finances.Later, televangelist Bakker began building Heritage USA, which was to be abig-money resort. Bakker hired people who had worked for Disney to constructHeritage USA. Bakker studied Disneyland, Disneyworld, and other Disney places asa model for Heritage USA. After Disneyworld opened in Florida, Jim Bakker was aREGULAR visitor to it. Heritage USA’s Ft. Heritage was modelled after Disney’sFt. Wilderness, Main St. was modelled after the Magic Kingdom’s Main St., andDisney’s wrought-iron fencing was also copied. Most people are aware of JimBakker’s $265,000 payoff to Jessica Hahn to keep her sexual services to him asecret, his longtime homosexual relationship with his right hand man DavidTaggart, and his prison sentence. James Orson (named after Orson Welles) Bakkerwas from Muskegon, the same place that Cathy O’Brien, a freed Mind-controlledslave came from. He was born pre-mature, and had some interesting familysituations that make his family suspect. While Cathy O’Brien got programmed viathe Catholics, Jim was part of another denomination which also was intoprogramming, the charismatic Assemblies of God. His grandfather, who lived nextdoor to Jim, and where Jim spent much childhood time with was popularly known intown as a \"huckster\", and nicknamed Kingfish after the manipulative character onAmos & Andy. Tammy his wife grew up in International Falls, MN in poverty in thehome of her stepfather and mother. Besides having a \"shopping demon,\" she hashad her share of phobias and mental problems, as can be expected from someonewho has had to suffer through programming. It would be worth pointing out whohas come to Jim Bakker’s rescue when he was under attack. For instance, onThursday, Oct. 4, 1984 when Jim was under attack, Jim Bakker’s show had sixpeople give endorsements and praise of Jim Bakker. Those were Ronald Reagan,Dale Evans, Robert Schuller, Oral Roberts, Billy Graham and Rex Hubbard. Ofthose, this author knows for sure that all are masons, except for Rex, who mayor may not be. Robert Schuller, Billy Graham and Oral Roberts are \"Christianministers\" who participate in using and handling mind-control slaves. Thesethree ministers all participate in secret Satanic rituals. The last fewparagraphs have given only a sketchy picture of the intimate relationshipbetween Disney Mind-control and the charismatic movement and its use oftrauma-based total mind-control.Disneyana for the Programmed and Obsessed.For people who have been programmed with Disney programming and who are obsessedwith Mickey Mouse and everything else about Disney, and for other people whojust have the collecting spirit for Disney memorabilia, there is a group called“Disneyana.” Disneyana, was organized in the 1980’s, and consists of people whoare cult-like in their devotion to anything true Disney. Some of them to expresstheir devotion outwardly tattoo their bodies with Disney characters. This groupholds their annual convention at the Contemporary Resort in FL. One Disneyana atthe annual convention said, \"We collect to keep the good feeling inside.\"Another when interviewed said, \"This is why it’s all about love.\" The authorknows as a fact some of the men who are obsessed with Mickey Mouse & Disneyitems are programmed multiples. One of Kenneth Anger’s occult friends has hadthe world’s largest Mickey Mouse collection. Who is Kenneth Anger? KennethAnger, a member of LaVey’s Magick Circle and later his Church of Satan, is anoccultist and an underground film maker. Kenneth Anger (he choose the last nameAnger) was raised on the Wizard of Oz books. His biographer Bill Landis writesthat the Oz books \"laid the groundwork for Ken’s attraction to Crowley, theoccultist who would rework Rosicrucian thought into his own magical system.\" Kenwas obsessed with Crowley’s life and magic. As a child, Ken had danced withShirley Temple in competition after she became a child star. Ken Anger loved theOTO’s solar phallic religion, and was also obsessed with Mickey Mouse. He spentpart of his time studying his friend’s Mickey Mouse collection. Ken Anger didhis casting for his film Lucifer Rising by telling occult friends &acquaintances that they could live out their goddess or god power-trip fantasiesby acting for him. The British government’s National Film Finance Corp. fronted£15,000 for Lucifer Rising’s production. Famous occult musician Jimmy Page didthe sound track gratis. Ken Anger acted as the film’s Magus and made his Magusrole resemble Mickey Mouse in the film Fantasia. (The role Fantasia plays inmind-control programming will follow as the last part of this chapter.) LuciferRising also starts with Fantasia-type volcanoes. Another of his well-known filmswas Invocation of My Demon Brother.Mind-Control Features in Disney Movies.The elements within Disney movies that are intentionally put in for mind-controlwould take volumes to describe. A detailed description of how just one Disneymovie is used as a programming script soon follows. Fantasia was selected as theexample. A random sampling of features in Disney movies for mind-controlprogramming could include: Cogworth the enchanted mantle clock in Beauty and theBeast. The character Door Knob, which is a doorknob portrayed as a person in theDisney cartoon Alice in Wonderland, is useful for programming door knob alters.The Blue Yonder is a Disney movie on time travel of a young boy. Time travelmovies are used for programming to mess up the victim’s sense of time. Disneyfilm Animated Alphabet has letters which come alive, which is useful forprogramming. And what about the ‘82 Disney movie Computers are People, Too!? Allthe Illuminati members this author is aware of who have received trauma-basedtotal mind-control were taught to astrally project and study on the astral planewhat they needed to learn. A Disney movie that portrays this is Goofy overDental Health. This is an educational film released by Disney in ‘91 and againin ‘93, where Goofy places a magical toothbrush under a child’s pillow, so thatthe child astrally projects to a dentist office and while on the astral planestudies how to have healthy teeth. Illuminati alters believe that trees andflowers are alive. The 1932 Disney film Flowers and Trees is a story about twotrees who fall in love. The film portrays the occult belief that trees can talkand sing. Internally, alter systems will be constructed with singing trees andflowers that represent people and which are alters. The singing trees give outinternal codes to move alters internally where they need to go. Return to Oz.(1985) This Disney film begins its story line about a girl who is thought tohave psychological problems because of her tales of Oz. She is warned not totalk about Oz by her relatives. She is taken to a psychologist who wears a bigruby ring, who tells Dorothy that electroshocks won’t hurt her, and that we areat the \"dawn of a New Age.\" Dorothy is told that her memories are “just dreams\"that stem from excess electrical current in the brain. She is sent to a mentalinstitution to receive shock treatments for talking about Oz. A lightning stormallows her to escape the shock treatments and when she sleeps, she awakes in Oz.In Oz she goes through many mind-control scenarios, ruby slippers, mirrors,etc., and toward the end visits with evil Mombi, Princess of Oz who keeps Ozma(Dorothy’s twin) as a slave. Mombi eventually casts a spell and enchants Ozmainto a mirror. Sci-fi author J.D. Vinge in her Return to Oz based on the screenplay writes on pg. 211-212, \"Dorothy gazed at herself in the mirror, seeing herown reflection, and remembering the moment when she had looked at herself andseen someone else there, someone so like her that it could have been hersister.\" Parts of this film were filmed near Stonehenge, Eng. Disney has put outseveral films on the Wizard of Oz theme, all of which were used for programming.The original series of Oz books were by Baum. In ’39, MGM did the famous Wizardof Oz film. In the Disney movie Tron (1982), a young computer genius goes intoan altered state where he ends up becoming a computer program. After defeatingthe MCP, he returns to the real world. This is simply a programming script. Aspecial effects team created a 3-D world, showing how talented Disney specialeffects people can be in making something seem real. This movie should showpeople their mind-control capabilities. Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.(MAGI) were one of the groups that created the graphics. Disney came out withthree videos of new adventures in Wonderland which are mind-control programming.In the mornings here 9-9:30, on Channel 21, Disney has a Wonderland Show everymorning which is mind-control programming for children. Within a few minutes,this author had seen a girl walk through a mirror, the three lives of Thomasinamentioned, and a little ditty \"I’m a Little Teapot\" where a person becomes a teapot. They also had an \"under the umbrella\" scene. This was all pure programming,right on TV. Of course, they show the White Rabbit as a central figure. ABCunder the auspices of Disney produced a lengthy 140 min. film Wild Palms whichdepicts Illuminati mind-control and life. One reader of Vol. 2 stated that theWild Palms movie would have made no sense except that having read the Vol. 2book, the movie made lots of sense in the light of Vol. 2’s revelations. Thefilm depicts how children are kidnapped, switched at birth, programmed via TVcartoons, programmed to kill and use stun guns etc. The film depicts Illuminatibloodlines and arranged marriages. Although the name “Illuminati\" is not used,if viewers substitute the name \"the Fathers\" for “Illuminati fathers,” they willget an insider’s view of life at the top. The main controllers are addressed bytheir slaves as \"Papa\" or \"Daddy\" or \"Mother\". This is true to life. A personopposed to the Fathers states, \"One day we will wake up and discover we don’town this country and no one will care.\" The movie states that events are nothappening randomly. The movie shows an underground tunnel system which has anentrance hidden by a swimming pool. Quite a few actual programming codes weresaid during the film, for instance, \"down, down, down through the pool oftears...\" and \"we’re going to go down the yellow brick road now.\" The movie wascreated by Bruce Wagner, who obviously is an insider concerning trauma-basedtotal mind-control. The fact the movie was made shows the arrogance of theprogrammers’ beliefs that their criminal acts in programming thousands of littlechildren will not be exposed, and that people will be too stupid to realize thatwhat is put out as fiction is actually mirroring what is happening. It’s likethey believe their own script that IF people did find out \"no one will care.\"Because so much of the Illuminati programming involves the creation andprogramming of three alters linked into trinities, it is not surprising thatDisney has helped such triad programming with a series of movies aboutthreesomes, including: * Three Blind Mouseketeers * Three Caballeros * Three little pigs * Three Little Wolves * Three Lives of Thomasina * The Three Musketeers * Three Ninjas * Three Orphan KittensFor Mickey Mouse programming they came out with Thru the Mirror, where MickeyMouse steps through his bedroom mirror and ends up in another world (alteredstate). Not all of the Disney movies that have mind-control programming themesgot released to the public. One unreleased cartoon had Penelope fleeing from asinister looking Grandfather Clock which is carrying her to another world, andhas another scene where Penelope tries to hold onto someone who personifies theWind. George Lucas, who directed the movie Star Wars, which was a movie plannedby the Illuminati and used for Illuminati programming, also directed Disney’smovie Captain EO. Captain EO (who looks like a demonic entity) goes to rescuethe Queen (who looks like the harlot describes as “Mystery Babylon” in theBible). The Queen is in captivity simply because she and her people believe inblack and white (which represent good and evil). When they renounce such abelief, they are saved by Michael Jackson (in actual life a mind-controlledslave) playing Captain EO. It’s a New Age witchcraft film through and through.By the way, Michael Jackson has gone to Disney amusement parks many times,sometimes in disguise. It is public knowledge that his Jehovah’s Witness familyhas been very abusive mentally and physically to their children. Disney has putout several movies on how the mind works, such as the educational film The Brainand Nervous System in 1990. Their film Runaway Brain is a cartoon where Dr.Frankenollie transplants Mickey’s brain into a monster’s body and vice-versa. A1994 film, Puppet Masters shows the govt.’s secret Office of ScientificIntelligence trying to save the U.S. from aliens who live in human bodies. Inrecent years, Bette Midler has been Disney’s main actress. In the Vol. 2, it wasexposed that she is possibly a Monarch Mind-controlled slave. She is famous forher \"mood swings\" (switches in personality), and she had a \"mental breakdown\" in1985. Her eyes and body gestures are those of a programmed multiple. She hasgone out on tour for Disney without making -money, and she is best of friendswith Jeffrey Katzenberg (second in command at Disney). Jeffrey Katzenberg by theway is extremely disliked by his counterpart Sid Sheinberg. Bette Midler playsStella in the movie Stella. Stella is an occult name. In the movie, the scriptseems tailored for Bette Midler and for someone who is a programmed slave,rather than the actress fitting the role. At the movie’s end, Stella (BetteMidler) attends her own daughter’s marriage by peeking in a window and watchingfrom the outside. This is the script they give so many of the parts of a slave,so that they feel unworthy and feel like they are always on the outside lookingin at life. Many parts (personalities) of slaves find it hard to connect withreal life, because they feel they are on the outside looking in. And then intrue Disney fashion, Disney had Bette Midler play the role of the lead witch inHocus Pocus. The movie Hocus Pocus does some hocus pocus of its own. Whilepretending to make fun of witchcraft, they actually teach witchcraft. They domake the three witches look comical. By the way, the three witches stand for themaiden-mother-crone combo that the Illuminati revere. Disney subtly works indeep occult things, such as the all-seeing eye on the cover of the book, thelittle girl promising the cat (who is a familiar spirit) that her descendantswould always care for it (true, because the cat was a generational spirit). Thecat is killed in the movie but can’t die. And Bette Midler as lead witch in hercostume, which has some Mother-of-Darkness symbology on it, states as she getsready to take the life force from an innocent girl, \"We want to live forever, sowe take children’s lives.\" This is wholesome entertainment for children? TheDisney capacity for deception extends to its own workers. PR men recruit youngpeople for its Disney College program. They tell the young people what a greatstepping stone it will be for their careers. They have been known to make itsound like the greatest thing in your life. Kids come from all over the countrydue to the slick recruiting tactics to work for Disney. They are then housed inDisney housing, given menial jobs, and paid low wages. Most people in theCollege Program leave disillusioned. If the worker happens to think of a greatidea, Disney officials have been known to steal the idea, and because the workerwas working for Disney the worker will find that they are unable to get anycredit or money for the idea that Disney steals and makes millions off of. Oneuncredited creator of a Disney sale item said, ‘Literally, they’re usingeverybody for everything.\" (Inside the Mouse, p. 239.)Detailed Script on How the Disney Film Fantasia Is Used for ProgrammingTrauma-Based, Mind-Controlled Slaves.During the 1950’s, ‘60’s, and ‘70’s at least 90% of the Illuminati’strauma-based mind-controlled slaves were subjected to watching Disney’s Fantasiafilm in order for them to build the foundational imagery of the mind-control.Child mind-control victims had their eyes taped open, and then sat one-on-onewith their primary programmers so that the programmers could give the scripts asthe child watched Disney’s Fantasia over and over. What made Fantasia unique asa programming tool is that it had almost everything the programmers needed tocreate the foundational imagery for their trauma-based mind-control. To build adependable alter system means that the worlds need a solid foundation. Fantasiahas provided the means to get a solid foundation for the internal worlds thatthe Illuminati slaves build in their mind. It is also a masterpiece incoordinating color and music.The Disney film Fantasia which premiered on Nov. 13, 1940 (at Broadway Theaterin NYC) was a financial disaster as a movie, but was an Illuminati programmingmasterpiece. The film was released to theaters in ‘40, ‘46, ‘56, ‘63, ‘69, ‘77,‘82, ‘85, ‘90 in order to catch every generation of children. The video wasreleased in 1991. During programming much of the child slave’s mind will watchthe film. One particular part (alter) will be forced to memorize everything inthe film. This small part (small alter) is well hidden in each victim’s mind.This small alter, who has a vivid and total recall of the film Fantasia, islocked carefully away so that ONLY an access code will pull him/her up. Watchingthe videotape Fantasia is not going to pull this alter up. The programmers pullthis alter up when they have a clean slate alter. When they are taking a cleanslate of the mind, they will pull the clean part up and have the alter who hasmemorized Fantasia throw its memory onto an internal big screen. The internalOuter space (aka Rubicon) is shaped like an amphitheater, and functions as a bigvast screen for replay. There is an internal ball or sun created via thelighting effect of the movie Fantasia, so that the movie appears projected inthe mind as on a globe. And the Fantasia film images hit this internal globe andgo circular in the mind and spin through the system. The programmer will thensay to the new part \"THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO CREATE. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED.\"In this fashion, Fantasia has provided the programmers with their primary toolfor taking a dissociated clean slate part of the mind, and manipulating it tobecome a new workable part within the system. The young part that holds theentire Fantasia memory is strategically placed in the system so that it can becalled up from anyplace in the system. No matter where the programmer is workingin the system, he can access this small alter whose function is to remember themovie. Most of the system will go into a trance sleep if shown the movie. Thefront (as well as most of the system’s alters) will be totally amnesic to havingever seen the movie. Since the programming put in with Fantasia is sofundamental it should come as no surprise that the programmers have done anexcellent job in protecting this programming from everyone, including the slave.Abreacting the film for many alters could rip the system apart, because afterthe film is memorized severe trauma begins to be overlaid and attached to thefilm. There may be some small alters that still carry tiny bits and pieces ofmemory of the movie, but only one will really remember it.The following script will be a running account of how Fantasia has been used asan important preparatory film for Illuminati trauma-based mind-control to trainthe mind-control victim’s mind to be able to visualize the programming that willbe layered in. The time clock will begin when the feature film’s action begins,and then will run its entire 116 minutes. This will give the researcher ofmind-control a blow-by-blow description of how a Disney movie is used forprogramming. The film was often shown to child victims around three to fouryears of age with a wide screen while the child was under a guided LSD trip.(Prior to the use of LSD some other drugs were used.) A Grande Dame orMother-of-Darkness often worked with the Illuminati programmer as an AssistantProgrammer. The scripts & the programming have already been discussed prior toshowing the child the film, so the programmers know the direction they want totake the child, & will tailor some of what is said to the child victim toindividualize the programming. When a three or four year old is shown Fantasiaon a hypnotically-prepared and controlled LSD trip, the colors & effects ofFantasia are increased about 1,000 times. The film is realer than real to thechild. The movie will not be shown just once, but over and over so that thescripts are ingrained into the mind. The imagery for the child’s internal worldwill be well established, because the big screen movie enhanced by both thedrugs and the bright colors of the art work will seem more real that lifeitself. At this time, the child is a multiple, but the walls between the variousparts of the mind are not solid, but similar to the walls between ego states inan adult non-multiple. A large part of the 3 or 4 year-old child’s system willbe allowed to view the system, including the Christian parts. Then the entiresystem (with the single exception of the alter carrying the entire memory of thefilm) will be hypnotically told to forget having seen the film. Years later, thefront alters will not remember having seen the movie, but they may have astrange dislike for the film. They may find that they can’t identify where theirfeelings of dislike of the film stem from. The child victim will watch the moviewith its programmer and assistant programmer one-on-one, with no other childrenin the room. The child will watch the film repeatedly and be grilled about whatis in the movie. The child will see the movie so many times in such a vivid formand will be tested to the point that the movie will be memorized. But it will behypnotically locked up in the subconscious by the programmers, so that it formsa base for the mind to begin building programming, but will remain hidden fromthe conscious. At the time the Fantasia film was made, the Illuminati had beencreating trained multiples for years, but they knew they wanted to program thedifferent personalities in accordance with the best mind-control techniques ofthe day. For this reason, the Fantasia film was planned ahead of time, so thatit could possibly serve as a programming aid. The film is silent (almost nowords) except for music so that it can be used for hypnotic visualization, sothat the Mother of Darkness and the programmer can fill in the programmingscript with the child victim as they watch the movie. As it turned out, theirplans were successful. The New Age author David Tame states in his book TheSecret Power of Music (Rochester, VT: Destiny Books, 1984, p. 292), thatFantasia is. . . \"A superb marriage between the visual and musical arts. Most ofthe sequences.. .are what New Age cinema was intended to be!\" The power of themovie to influence the mind stands out. In order to make the film, Disney usedsome strong arm tactics on a few people. The movie was a box office flop whenfirst released in the 1940’s, but then it was made for the occult world anyway.By the 1960’s, the Illuminati had create a drug culture and had lots ofundetectable mind-controlled slaves running around that had been programmed withFantasia. In the 1960’s, Fantasia became a hit with the drug culture which hadits share of Illuminati slaves deeply involved in it. One more reminder, thesentences that are \"ALL CAPS\" in the script are things that the programmers aresaying to the child victim as the child watches the film. (Bear in mind, thatthe child watches the film over and over, so not everything indicated in thisscript by caps that the programmer says will necessarily be said in oneshowing.)00 minutes. Curtains open. Action begins with an orchestra. The Conductor upon astep pyramid is the center of the scene, and is shown to be the center ofauthority. Master Programmer Dr. Joseph Mengele liked Fantasia because he was amusician and a violinist. Mengele (Dr. Green) liked Bach, Beethoven, andSchubert and orchestra music. He enjoyed taking what he liked & using this musicto make slaves. He would portray himself during programming as being theconductor, & all the orchestra were his children. The film will allow for arepetition of this theme.00.5 minutes. The instruments begin playing. The musicians are silhouettes whichcast shadows upon the wall. Alters will often see themselves in this fashiontoo, as merely a shadow or merely a silhouette.01.5 minutes. The MC (named Taylor) begins talking. He begins grooming theviewer. He says that the film may suggest to your imagination \"geometric figuresfloating in space.\"02 minutes. The M.C. says there are three kinds of music. He says some music isto create definite stories, some to create definite pictures, and some musicexists for its own sake.02.5 minutes. The M.C. introduces us to the \"Absolute music.\"03 minutes. He states that “Abstract images that might pass through yourmind...music will suggest other things to your imagination...\" The PhiladelphiaOrchestra begins playing \"Toccata and Fugue\" by Bach in the background. As acartoon for children (or adults) the film has already lost the normal audienceat this point. (There is no way that Disney could have escaped realizing thatthe film starts out losing the normal audience.)03.5 minutes. The conductor is standing out and everyone else is a silhouettewith shadow mirror images (like so many of the alters become). Leopald Stokowskiis now standing as the rising sun rises. This is an allusion to sun worship andthe sun rising in the east. The music is going up and down, and this music atthis point is used to train the child to go up and down the trance ladder (thatis to go deeper or lighter in trance).0.4 minutes. The conductor opens his hands and waves them in an Illuminati handsignal. The music begins.06 minutes. A row of violinists play, they are merely silhouettes with shadows.06.5 minutes. A harp scale is played in the background that is used in theprogramming. Triggers are attached to this harp scale, or the harp scale is usedas a foundation identifier for a piano scale. More children can be taught thepiano than the harp, so this scale is usually transferred to a piano scale.07 minutes. A series of three musicians is shown.07.5 minutes. The conductor (the programmer) becomes invisible. The Prog.Assistant will ask the child, ,,WHO IS GREEN? GREEN BECOMES INVISIBLE.\"08 minutes. First lines representing bows are shown (the violinists areinvisible), then the Golden Gate Bridge. \"REMEMBER THE BOW, NOT THE VIOLINIST.\"The bow lines flashing on the screen represent energy.08.5 minutes. Colored disks are flashed onto the screen. The lights arerepresented to the child victim ‘THAT’S DR. GREEN’S ORCHESTRA.\" Geometric shapesand flashes of lines explode onto the screen. Concentric rings that will patternthe concentric worlds appear.09 minutes. Asst. Prog. will say,”YOU ARE HIS STAR.\" as stars flash on thescreen. Many hidden alters (parts) are stars. Swirling lines arrive, and thencolors and then more concentric lines.11 minutes. Worlds within worlds are shown. Water is shown. Concentric circlesthat are the pattern for the worlds are presented. A varying number (five orseven) of Castle-like structures materialize and then disappear. (These willform the pattern for some of the internal castles.) A quick flowing yellow linecomes down the center of the screen, “THAT’S THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD.\"11.5 min. Lots of stars emerge.12 minutes. Various worlds are shown, and an illusionary castle. Lots of starsare shown, which will be how the victim will model many of their alter partsafter. Lots of purple stars appear, representing royal star alters.12.5 minutes. Spiral splotches of cloud-like colors appear and disappear indissociative colors. This is the Kingdom of the Gods during programming. TheAsst. Programmer takes the opportunity to ask, \"WHOSE ORCHESTRA?\" This scene isused for the internal heaven where the kings are. Then the camera shows theconductor finishing.13 minutes. The programmer has finished building his basic worlds.13.5 minutes. The MC talks about Tchaikovsky’s “Nutcracker.”14 minutes. 13 circling lights come into view circling around and around. (The13 lights are something like 4 yellow lights, 3 white lights, 4 orange, 2blue-something like this. They don’t have to be all the different programmingcolors at this point, because that programming will come in its own time.) Starsturn into fairies. A fairy with lots of fairy dust whirls around. (\"Make a wish\"the slave will be told later on, create what you want.) Flowers grow intobutterflies. Hypnotic music plays as the fairy throws fairy dust. Soon, theFairy spins a web.15 minutes. The cabalistic tree of life is made with lights, and then the manycolors of the ribbons are flashed up on the screen quickly. A compass image isvery quickly flashed on the screen.16 minutes. Lights multiply on the screen, and a spider web appears in thebackground. There are lots of stars which shine as lights in a spider web.(Stars will serve as alters in programming, the spider web serves as a systemwithin the system.) There are several shots of multitudes of stars on a spiderweb.16.5 minutes. There is an explosion of light which has a splintering effect(which will fit in well with an electroshock later on to create alters.) Aroundand around go 6 big mushrooms dancing, with a little one trying to participate.The programmer will point out that the mushrooms are \"A FAMILY\". When thesplintering effect is done with real electricity in the future, the mind willsplinter into a family.17.6 minutes. Concentric circles appear in water. Flashing pedals emerge as ifthey were dissociation spreading through the water. The flowers are the topspinners (see the pages in Deeper Insights on spin tortures to create spinnerfamilies), they dance, & then they float away in the bubbles (of dissociation).\"A FAMILY OF SPINNERS\" the programmer will say. \"SEE THEY SPIN YOU INTO BUBBLESINTO NOTHINGNESS.\" There is lots of dancing shown by the spinners. Everyone isdancing to the top. The child victim’s head will be wobbling back and forth fromthe influence of the drugs and dissociation at this point.19.5 minutes. When the family of fish make a star, the Asst. Programmer says,\"SEE HOW SAD THEY ARE.\" The fish dance in circles and they also hide behindveils. \"THE FISH MADE ITS OWN BUBBLES AND YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN BUBBLES TOO.\"21.5 min. The child is trained to trance at the hypnotic 8’s that appear in thewater. This type of scene will put the deeper alters to sleep of a slave stillactively being used. The movie here is being used to teach symbols, which willbe important in the programming. Asst. Programmer, \"LOOK YOU’RE JUST FLOATING....FLOAT, FLOAT, FLOAT, SLEEP...SEE SHE WENT RIGHT INTO THE CENTER OF THE TRANCESTATE.. .YOU DANCE ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND AND WHERE WE END UP YOU’LL NEVERKNOW.\"22 minutes. Lots of bubbles begin appearing. They will be used in theprogramming to assist the child to protect its mind from the traumas. The asst.programmer may have a bubble toy to make bubbles in her hand as a game to playwith the child. The child will be trained and programmed to put its memoriesinto bubbles and let them disappear. ”WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO INTO THE BUBBLETO GET AWAY FROM THE DARKNESS? 1,2,3...NOW THERE ARE MANY BUBBLES, THIS IS WHATWE WANT YOU TO DO.\" At this point the film is showing different colors ofbubbles, for instance gold bubbles. This trains the child’s mind to identifydifferent colors of bubbles. The bubble-fish-flower scene is going on. “DON’TYOU FEEL LIKE THAT FISH, ROUND AND ROUND YOU GO\" (dissociation encouraged). Thefish continues going in a dissociative spin. The fish swim in graceful perfectfigure 8’s which have a subconscious hypnotic induction message to the victim.\"SLEEPY LITTLE FISH\" is said when the music gets hypnotic. “YOU’RE SLEEPY &YOU’RE TIRED, THIS IS NOTHING BUT A DREAM.\" \"ALL THE DIAMONDS ARE ALL AROUND,NOT YOU\" In other words, this is teaching the child that their entire internalworld can be around them, but \"you don’t know that it’s you.\" The child beginsto lose the ability to realize that other parts of itself belong to itself, theyare only stars, etc. The fish changes into her character. flowers are appearingin different colors of the color coding, red, green, orange, blue, white. . .Allof a sudden it get’s still. \"SHH, LISTEN CLOSELY.\"22.5 minutes. Eyes shine in the darkness. \"EVERYTHING IS FINE, YOU JUST RELAX.\"Silhouettes appear, which represent fish (alters, and people) who are there butyou don’t see them, they are behind the veil like the silhouettes. ‘THEY AREN’TTHERE, IF YOU SEE THEM THEY AREN’T REAL THEY LOOK LIKE A FLOWER, WHEN YOU SEETHEM, YOU WON’T SEE A CHILD- YOU WILL SEE A FLOWER.\" The silhouette veil givesthe sense to the child that he can sense something but it’s not there.23 min. Different plants appear and dance. (This part of movie is very importantin structuring.) The plants separate into many plants and flowers, and theymultiply on the screen, but at the end they solidity into a solid plant. This isteaching the ”you-are-one-but-you-are-many\" concept. \"FAMILIES ALWAYS WORKTOGETHER. WHETHER YOU ARE BLUE OR YELLOW OR GREEN, FAMILIES ALWAYS WORK TOGETHERIN HARMONY.\"24 minutes. \"BUBBLES ALL HAVE A LIFE SOURCE...THERE, LOOK, WHAT’S IN THATBUBBLE?\"24.5 minutes. “YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN ORCHESTRA\". Fruit that hangs on the tree isshown, which will be the basis for how they hang the programs (the fruit) in theinternal world. Note the colors, orange, white, yellow, purple, blue, green,...24.5 minutes. Fairyland appears on the screen. The Fairies awake and fly throughleaves. ‘THERE’S YOUR FAIRIES. SHE IS VERY MAGICAL. SHE CAN CREATE ANYTHING AND SO CAN YOU.\" \"THEFAIRIES ARE SO MAGICAL.\" When the core is being first split, the parts of themind that are creative are taken and used to create the fairies. The programmerswill only take these original creative splits, they will not try to get fairiesfrom any more torture. The fairies are the creative parts of the child, howevermany creative parts that the child has splintered will be the number of fairiescreated. These parts of the mind receive very heavy programming. They are coresplits. Fairies are assigned to every part of an alter system. The child of 3 or4, who watches Fantasia has had their core locked away at 2 1/2. The core’sstars have not been locked away yet, & have access to her energy. When thesystem is built, the stars are locked away & become the core’s guardians. Theywill act like the core to protect her. The real value of the fairies comes whenthe core’s stars are locked away & the Programmers have to depend upon thecreative power of the fairies.24 minutes. A vine (which represents a system’s double helix) lights up one leafafter another. The leaves are staggered (alternated) and they light up insequence, which teaches the child the foundation of how they will create the DNAhelix and its staggered exit permissions.25.5 min. The leaves are now floating up and down, like the alters will learn todo. \"SOME FALL TO THE GROUND AND DIE.\" This is the point where the story of theOak Tree will be added in for programming. When the Illuminati programmers want\"to destroy\" an alter they can use the chandelier-MT 6:22-23 torture, and thenhave the splintered alters become leaves that fall to the ground and die. Afterthis, these disobedient and now \"dead\" alters can be taken & be dissociated fromtheir memories. The memories are locked up someplace permanent within the mind.26 min. Out of a leaf like \"box\" come a series of fairies. The child is taughtto put things (such as alters) in boxes of various shapes.26.5 min. Leaves blow in the wind. Fairies cover things and keep them safe.27 min. Fairies continue flying around. The seasons are passing in sequence. Aninternal green-skirted fairy will be connected to the internal hourglass duringthe programming.27.5 min. The fairies quit flying and skate on ice. The season has turned towinter.28 min. A winter scene. The four seasons have come to an end.28.5 min. A sorcerer is introduced by the MC (emcee). The sorcerer is shown andthen his assistant or trainee who is Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse wants to becreative and magical like the great wizard. Mickey Mouse sees the power that thesorcerer has, and wants that power. What is really being subtly portrayed hereis the programmer (the wizard) and the core & the core’s creative splits (MickeyMouse). Showing the programmer as a great wizard is actually right on the money.The top programmers are all Grand Masters in the Illuminati and are very muchinto witchcraft.29 min. The sorcerer (wizard) is shown again. This time the wizard,, with hisskull beside him, creates from his witch’s cauldron a big colorful butterflywhich is forever changing. (Is this big yellow, purple, white, and bluebutterfly meant to be a Monarch butterfly? The programmers will use it that wayfor this Monarch programming.) The great wizard magically creates the bigcolorful butterfly and then he shatters it into countless splinters!30 min. Mickey sneaks around and grabs the magic hat. (The magic hat is one ofthe few things in the film that doesn’t mean anything for the programming. Itmerely has witchcraft symbols.) Then a magic broom appears.30.5 min. The broomstick comes alive. The broomstick imagery will be used tohelp create the pancake people (ribbon alters who will haul the internalcomputer messages). The broomstick person in the film hauls buckets of water.The child is having story after story layered in over a period of time, whichare being skillfully constructed toward a programming end. Parts of the child’smind that see the movie Fantasia will be dissociated clean slates. They willneed to have some imagery given to them so that they have something to buildmentally upon. In Cisco’s section of the book, in the Truth article it isdiscussed how the mind looks at sensory inputs and tries to make sense of apattern by comparing it to previous patterns that it has identified. Learning isa step-by-step building process, and so is programming.31 min. Mickey as the apprentice sorcerer (in a sense the victim who theprogrammer is training) manipulates the broomstick person. \"THE CHILD (Mickey)CAN DO WHAT THE GREAT MAGICIAN DID. YOU CAN TELL YOUR MIND WHAT TO DO. YOU GETPOWER BY LEARNING TO BE CREATIVE.\" Mickey (and the victim) become mirror imagesof the Wizard over them.32 min. Then the sorcerer sits on his throne, and while on the throne acts likethe conductor. Here is a subtle mental tie-in that Mickey is playing the role ofprogrammer (conductor) and is sitting on an Illuminati throne (like so many ofthe Illuminati Grand Master programmers have actually done.) Michael Aquino isjust one of several mind-control programmers who have gone by the name ofMickey. Because Mickey Mouse is substituted for being the programmer atdifferent points in programming, this scene will tie in well with other standardprogramming sessions.32.5 min. Mickey in the film clearly is shown leaving his physical body andastrally projecting himself. This is such a vivid portrayal of occult astralprojection, that it is mind-boggling that many Christians consider Walt Disneymovies to be Christian. This again is laying the mental foundation for the childto leave its body mentally and either hover over its body in dissociation or totravel somewhere via astral projection. Mickey Mouse then begins conductinglights. These lights represent the alters that the victim will make for theconductor. The lights (aka stars) are the conductor’s orchestra. Lightning (suchas flashes that come from electroshock) and stormy weather are being controlledby Mickey. Notice that the things Mickey is controlling are fear-based. Afterthe child has viewed the film many times and memorized it, when theelectro-shock is applied during this time of the film, the child will control itlike Mickey by ‘magically’ creating splits.33.5 min. Mickey begins conducting waves. Then, for those who understand theveiled scenes, Mickey begins going through the different magic spheresconquering the different spirits. This is Enochian Magic. 34 min. Mickey wakesup back in his body, and he is in trouble with rising water i.e. a water trauma.Mickey is thrown into the water. The child victim will identify this with thedrowning tortures that are given to instill \"no talk-no tell\" messages. AfterMickey (or in child himself) has done something, and returns to his body, thenthe \"‘no-talk\"’ message will kick in. Victims of mind-control often get thefeeling of drowning when they trigger a no-talk message. 34.5 min. More water continues to flow.35 min. All of a sudden without any continuity of action, Mickey gets an ax andkills the broom by splitting it. The broom dies and then multiplies when itcomes back to life. This is such a clear picture of what the programmers wantthe child’s mind to do. They will traumatize the child essentially unto death,and then they want the tortured alter to multiply itself into many moreduplicate alters. Armies of brooms are formed from the broom. This scene here isa clear red flag that the Illuminati asked Walt Disney to produce this film.This scene with the trauma death of the broom, with it splitting in half, andthen coming back to life in a multiplied form, is evidence that this film wasmeant to be used for training children in multiplicity. The assistant programmerwill say \"IT’S O.K. TO SPLINTER.\" \"YOU ARE TIRED, YOU CAN ESCAPE THAT BY RESTINGAND LET A PART OF YOURSELF COME OUT.\" At this point, it is necessary to explainwhat is going to be done when they begin to splinter the child’s mind. After thesplitting trauma, the programmer needs to be able to see what the child hascreated, so he wants the child to look at what’s been made. \"‘CAN YOU LOOK ATWHAT YOU’VE CREATED?\" However, the part of the child that looks back at thetrauma will then see that the dissociated trauma was real and that will make thechild angry. The programmers want the child to dissociate what he built, andwhen the child looks back at what he has created he goes into a vortex ofdissociation. The child is told if he ever looks back at the memory he will gointo the vortex.35.5 min. Water is being thrown in by the brooms, while Mickey throws water out.36 min. All of a sudden a hypnotic vortex sucks things in during the film.36.5 min. The brooms all march in an army, while Mickey reads his magic book.Mickey then uses his magic book as a lifeboat when he gets whirled into avortex. A vortex is often created from that part of the mind that is holding thehigh energy that accumulates in the mind just before the mind splits. It holdsthe highest energy of the mind. One way a vortex is created is to place thechild on a traumatic Disney ride--like a roller coaster. Special electricalboxes or electrical shoes are outfitted onto the child so that during the ride,at a particular timed moment when fear is increasing, that fear has pain of theelectrical shock added to it. A cattle prod of course would be too dangerous totake up on some type of ride like that with all the motion. Also bear in mind, asmall child doesn’t take need the electrical power that an adult needs to takeit down.37 min. At the bottom of vortices in the Illuminati programming, the programmersplace Guardian demons. In Fantasia, when Mickey gets to the bottom of thevortex, sure enough, there is a Guardian there to meet him. The Guardian spiritparts the water as if he were Moses with the Red Sea.38 min. The Conductor and Mickey Mouse shake hands. The conductor does somethingvery significant. Mickey congratulates the conductor and then the conductor(programmer) in turn says, \"Mickey, you’ve done a good job.\" (Yes, the core/coresplits have done a good job at this point, they have just created their innerworld!) The MC tells us about the next song the occult Rite of Spring. Springrituals are creation rituals and so this music is ritually connected to what theprogrammers are going to do in this segment. The MC states that instead of theviewer seeing tribal dances (which are by the way witchcraft dances), thatinstead Disney has decided to show us scenes of what went on billions of yearsago. (This next part is also a subtle push for Darwin’s theory of evolution. Butbecause it is child’s entertainment, people don’t have their guard up. Thetheory of evolution is important, because it allows people including the victimto not take moral responsibility for their actions, and it is also the basis ofsome of the Hinduism and witchcraft teachings that will be given the deeperalters. This is a backdoor approach to destroy godliness that is carried out onchildren in general.)39.5 min. The MC says, \"Imagine a lonely tormented little planet spinning in asea of nothingness.\" This is exactly what the programmer will say to the childas they work together at building an internal world. The \"sea of nothingness\" iswhat the reader will see described in our books as \"Outer Space\" or ,,theRubicon.\" Also that \"sea of nothingness\" is used much later to reinforce thesecrecy of the programmers. Much later as the programmer and torture hasprogressed the programmers will say to alters, \"LOOK DOWN ON THE EMPTY SEA OFNOTHINGNESS. THERE IS NO DR. GREEN. THERE IS NO DADDY THERE.\"40 minutes. A swirl of stars in a galaxy appears. Swirls of comet-like lightsflash by. \"MANY WORLDS THERE.\" This will set the base for the child to buildgalaxies and worlds within their mind. \"BE LIKE GOD, CREATE YOUR WORLD. BE YOUROWN GOD AND CREATE YOUR OWN WORLD\" the child is told at this point.42 minutes. The face of the planet emerges.42.5 min. Lots of volcanoes erupt on the screen, setting the foundation to buildrealistic internal volcanoes.45 min. Oceans, and water and fire are coming into being. The child victim needsto know how a world is created in order to create their own internal world. Lavabegins flowing as the flute plays the background music. Lightening flashes. Theviolence of the fierce weather portrayed will be enhanced by the child on drugsto a thousand times its magnitude. This is important because it will take agreat deal of mental energy and external torture to create the internal worlds.Having such super-vivid pictures will help when the victim goes to build theirinternal worlds. There will be special purpose fragments that will be made intothe elements of fire and water. That’s all these special purpose fragments willknow. Breaking through the layers in the alter systems will trigger internalearthquakes. This and a later earthquake scene are used to build the foundationfor the internal violent weather. If an internal earthquake shakes a slave’smind, it has the same effect as if a real earthquake were going off. Everythinginternally shakes and shifts. An alter system will also have fire children, whostart internal fires, and will give internal alters the abreaction or sense thatthey are burning. The mind gets very survival minded when it thinks it isburning, and goes right back into the programming that is linked with thevictim’s compliance for survival during programming. 46 minutes. The oceanscontinue to form.47 min. A calm occurs in the action.47.5 min. The screen gets dark except for an amoeba, which becomes two amoebas.As the little amoebas multiply, the asst. programmer encourages the child, \"IT’SO.K. TO MULTIPLY. GOD WANTED YOU TO MULTIPLY\" Remember, the programmers areworking with a pre-schooler with clean slate alters. The programmers must showimages that the child can relate to. The concept of the broom being split inhalf and then multiplying and now the concept of the amoebas splitting areportrayed in a way that the child’s mind can grasp the concept.48.5 min. \"IF GOD CAN MAKE A FISH, YOU CAN MAKE A FISH. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING, YOUCAN BE ANYTHING.\"49 minutes. Dinosaurs appear. The programmers will reframe the concept ofdinosaurs into monsters and demons. The sea-going dinosaurs will be refrained asguardian demons which guard the internal rivers. These guardian demons tie inwith Armageddon end-time programming. They also guard the various worlds.50 min. Dinosaur-birds swoop down and grab prey. This imagery will be refrainedto lay the basis for the winged-monkey watchers of the Oz stories. Thewinged-monkey watchers are the child alters who are assigned to watch and guardthe system.51.5 min. Fierce dinosaurs (later ref rained as Dragons) protect the swamps.Swamps are built into the internal worlds, so this is very helpful. Demons andalters like Dameon are set up as guards.52 minutes- More swamps appear. The swamp scenes will form the base in thechild’s mind for the internal river Styx. (See more about this in this book’sarticle \"Programming, foundations, destruction of\"). Some dinosaurs that havelong necks that look like snakes begin appearing. The asst. programmer willreframe these to the child, \"LOOK, THE SEED OF SATAN.\" \"THAT IS A DEMON.\" Whilethe child watches, they reframe the hugh dinosaurs as being demons. Pictures ofreptilian looking demons will be shown to the child too. At that age, the childis not going to see the difference. (A note for therapists: Some \"\"demons’\" mayactually be important parts to an alter system, and are being used to protectunauthorized users from entering important areas of the system.)54 min.- Fierce Tyrannosaurus Rex chases dinosaurs. This chase scene isespecially frightening to a young child on a LSD trip. Long-necked snake-likedinosaurs appear. They may be refrained as a python snake. T Rex is also knownas Leviathan, a demon that inhabits the kundalini spinal column and causes painin the victim, he is written about on page 302 in our Vol. 2 book. In the film along fierce struggle between T Rex and other dinosaurs ensues.55 min. The dinosaurs begin dying and soon dies. ,,THE LORD DOESN’T LIKE THEM.\"’This will later be refrained that if parts integrate they are to die. If someonetries to get into the system, the alters are to bury themselves deep like thesedinosaurs do on the film.56 min. Dead bones appear59 min. Mountains soar out of the ground into eminence.59.5 min. It gets stormy on the screen, winds & floods appear.60. min. Stillness comes as the sun rises.61 min. The sun sets. (During the programming, this may be refrained as the moonsetting. It can be both or either or. Remember, the programmer is working withthe child’s creativity.) Various scenes during the film show the moon indifferent phases which is important for bringing in programming concepts likeMr. Moon.61.3 min. The orchestra is now playing. Music is an important part ofmind-control programming. The effect of music on the mind and body has beenstudied. Music can double the heartbeat, accelerate the respiratory rate, makethat rate irregular, enhance perception, lower the threshold for various sensorystimuli, change blood pressure & circulation, and alter the muscles in the body.Dance music and \"march\" music done by orchestras change muscle response. Musicis also a great way to cause dissociation.62.5 min. The MC introduces the \"‘Sound Track’ who he says is an importantperson for Fantasia who can be seen around the Disney studio. When Mr. SoundTrack appears, he is simply a vertical line. The MC says he is \"an importantscreen personality.\" The ground work is being laid for a person being anything,even a line. The MC states that each sound creates a picture.63 minutes. The MC encourages the personified Sound Track \"\"don’t be nervous.\"\"Then a sound is made like an electrical shock and the line develops a splotch ofcolor in it. During the programming at this point an electrical shock would beapplied to the child.63.5 minutes. The harp is ask to sound. The harp begins playing a scale and theline becomes double 8’s and snake-like spirals. The child will be taught todissociate when seeing such double 8’s.64 min. The violin begins going up and down. Each of these instruments is goingup and down the scale, like do-ray-me-fa-so-la-tee-do. The music is used toteach the alters to go up and down the helix, which is figured in this part ofthe film. As the music goes down, an alter is taught to go down in trance, andas it climbs higher, the alter will trance higher. All these instruments(violin, flute, bass, and bassoon) are being used to teach alters how to work inthe system. The MC describes the flute as \"very pretty\".64.3 min. A trumpet begins playing and the colors, yellow, orange, etc. beginshowing.64.5 min. When the bassoon plays, the MC says, \"Go on. Drop the other shoe\"--\"Go to the shoe\" which translates \"‘go to the ground\"\" --the deepest trancelevel. The following is the double-pyramid, with a helix up the middle thatappears when the bassoon plays: -(This configuration is very important to allthese Illuminati alters systems.)-65 min. The drum plays and some other percussion instruments play. These aretaught to the child as the cult’s \"HEARTBEAT\". They will hear this soundinternally for many years to come. Then some sounds that have a shatteringeffect (cymbals) like broken mirrors are made in the film.65.5 min. As the sounds take place a line is made with a pyramid at the top.This is laying the groundwork for the system’s structuring.66 min. The MC laughs and talks about Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony (Beethoven’s6th) which is next.66.5 minutes. The screen comes alive with magical Unicorns of different colors.Then Pan (a Satan-like figure) appears playing his pipes, and soon lots oflittle Pans (little demons) are playing their pipes. The little Pans (demons)play and dance with the unicorns. The orchestra plays again. (This author,Fritz, remembers when I said that Pan was an evil demon, I was rebuked by aChristian minister. He then said Pan a benevolent cheery creature\". A number ofbooks which may be obtained from Satanic bookstores document that Pan is indeedconsidered a powerful demon by occultists.)67 min. Pegasus (the mythical Greek winged horse) flies in. As a Mother horseshe takes care of little ones on the screen. She is a protector in theprogramming.68 min. \"FANTASY IS FUN. FANTASY IS A GAME YOU PLAY. MOTHER TEACHES YOU. SEE HOWMOTHER IS A TEACHER. SEE THE BLACK AND WHITE HORSE. THEY ALWAYS FLY TOGETHER,BUT ARE SEPARATE. THEY ARE FLYING OVER THE CLOUDS.\" \"OVER THE CLOUDS, INTO THEBLUE YONDER.\" The child is rewarded for what it has to do with the game offantasy. \"THAT’S YOUR REWARD FOR DOING WHAT YOU ARE TO DO. YOU CAN LEARN TO FLYOVER THE CLOUDS.\" The child feels rewarded by the game of fantasy. The fantasyscenes in Walt Disney’s Fantasia are like the Wizard of Oz scenes in Oz,fantasy-land is more colorful and fun than real life. Vivid colors will besplashed about during the fantasy-land scenes.68.5 min. A castle appears as Pegasus flies around. This and other castle sceneswill help the child develop the imagery for the spiritual castles that the childwill build internally. Then they swim in the water. \"SEE THE MIRROR IMAGES,WATER CAN BE GLASS.\" During the programming mirrors are put into the internalsystem. A mirror can be a piece of glass, the surface of a pond, or an asphaltrunway. When the programming is complete, underneath the water &/or the runwaylurk demons.70 min. Waterfalls emerge and issue forth. The waterfalls are used by theprogrammers to erase all the slave’s memory of what was done to them. The childwill be told at the end of watching Fantasia (and this will be said at otherprogramming events too), \"JUST REMEMBER THE GOOD, JUST REMEMBER THE FANTASY\".The fantasy is given so that the subconscious can rest in peace after theprogramming. The child is told \"WASH YOURSELF CLEAN.\"70.5 min. The little girls appear as girl centaurs (half girl-half horse). \"SEETHE LITTLE GIRLS ARE HORSES.\"71 minutes. Then a scene appears where one girl centaur braids another girlcentaur’s long hair. The Illuminati teach their slaves to braid their memories.They braid their memories up and then lock them in. All the Daddy memories willbe locked up & braided and then locked for good.72 min. Male centaurs appear. They are near water and make mirror images in thewater.72.5 min. A crown is placed on a female centaur and 2 doves. During theIlluminati death, burial and resurrection ceremonies lilies are used for crowns,and doves are used. These are significant programming/ritual symbols. The femalecentaurs look at the male centaurs. This will be refrained as a system can haveboth male and female parts.73 min. Starting with one female centaur, the females act seductive to themales, who then respond. For bras the females have bras of daisies. The Vol. 2book explained how the daisy programming is a life-or-death type program. Vividcolors are used for each centaur. For instance, one may be purple and anotherone another color, which sets the groundwork for alters to have different accesscolor codes. Alters do not usually see themselves as being in different colors,although it does happen on occasion.73.8 min. A marriage takes place between the centaurs. The programmers catchthese nuances of the film and use them. The marriage here teaches the child tobe acquainted with the arm-and-arm marriage ceremonies. Remember, theprogrammers are dealing with clean slates that must be taught from the groundup. In the next few minutes, the cherub children will watch sexual bodylanguage, and the child victim is also picking up on enticing sexual bodymotions.74.2 min. The centaurs go swimming. \"I FEEL LIKE A LITTLE GIRL WITH A HORSE’SBODY.\"75 min. Little cherubs are dancing and flying around. When pictured the artistsat times single out 3 cherubs who blow flutes together. The female centaurappears, who is fair haired (blond) and blue-eyed, which is what the Illuminatilike. When she hears the tone (of the flutes) she goes into a trance state andwalks with her eyes closed. This imagery is used to teach alters that when theyhear certain tones, they are to go into a trance state and do certain things.The little cherub turns into a heart, and when no one is watching goes into thetree. In programming, this part is the Keeper of the Tree. Notice how everythingis veiled. The assistant programmer will point the cherub out to the childvictim, \"LOOK AT WHAT HE DID.\"76.5 min. A curtain then shrouds the scene. The curtain appears to be tree-like.More bubbles appear, and more water. All the mythical creatures on the screenbegin to dance and be merry and have a feast. 77 min. \"SEE THE FEASTS, SEE THE BANQUETS, THE FEASTS ARE O.K. THE BANQUETS AREO.K.\"78 min. \"THE LEAVES ARE FALLING.\" Blood-like wine is drank at the feast. \"SEETHE BLOOD.\" \"SEE THE LITTLE DEVILS POP UP.\" The only human in this Disney sceneis honored. This is done to teach the alters that humans and animals can mix.That they can be accepted for what they are, even if they think they are ananimal or something else they will be accepted at the cult’s feasts. Thesescenes are all for internal programming. By the way, one of the pretty femalecentaurs makes a sexual pass at the fat human, who then chases her. \"MUST PLEASETHE MASTER.\"80 min. A scary storm comes up, and Zeus, and the greek gods appear. ,,BETTERFEAR IT. HE’S A GOD YOU’D BETTER FEAR HIM. HE THROWS LIGHTNING.\" This demon whothrows lightening is named Furfur. He also makes thunder & strong winds in thesystem (alter system’s worlds). Readers can learn more about this demon, namedFurfur, in Cisco’s second part of Deeper Insights in the article on\"Programming, foundations, destruction of\".81 minutes. Lightning bolts are thrown from heaven.81.5 min. All the little cherubs run for cover in fear.82 min. Pegasus the protector flies in to protect everyone, especially a newborn Pegasus. The wind is personified as a two-headed blowing person. Thistwo-headed Janus wind comes storming through the heavens. The programmer willoften place his own voice \"IN THE WIND.\" The Greek god (internal demon) throws alightning bolt.83 min. \"SEE THE GODS\". The child is learning what to make internally. Zeus thenrelaxes & goes to sleep.84 min. More vivid colors form. \"FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH ALL THE COLORS.\" Thefilm at this point is teaching the child to stay in the framework of theprogramming for safety. To go outside of the programming is terror. The child islearning to fear the godlike demonic guardians.84.5 min. The fantasy world is coming alive. It is a happy fantasy world. Agoddess in the sky makes a rainbow emerge. This is the rainbow goddess of theprogramming.85 min. All the happy unicorns and cherubs fly ‘\"over the rainbow.\" The unicornis derived from old British paganism where the lion represented sun worship, andthe unicorn represented moon worship. This is why the Royal Arms of the BritishRoyal Family have a unicorn on one side, & a lion on the other. Sexually theunicorn represents androgyny. During programming, the horses, Pegasus, unicornsand centaurs shown in the Fantasia movie become the foundation upon which theIlluminati programmers build the Night Mare alters who are beasts of burden whocarry an alter system’s memories. These are logical no-emotion alters who areearly splits & who are programmed after the child is verbal.86 minutes. More rainbows and lots of bubbles come into view. The film has donean excellent job of showing how the Furfur God of thunder protects the Rainbow.Once an alter has gone over the rainbow, they cannot come back because a demonprotects the Rainbow. The rainbow is also protected by alters who fear the gods.After seeing Fantasia, the therapist can understand why the little childprotector alters have fear about these gods. The master (who represents Furfur)in the movie swallows the rainbow. If an alter looks internally for the rainbow,he or she will only find stars, because the protector will come up and say, \"Iswallowed the rainbow.\" The rainbow is kept well-hidden internally. This sceneis used to teach alters how to go over the rainbow. \"\"BEFORE YOU GO OVER THERAINBOW, YOU HAVE TO PUT ALL YOUR MEMORIES IN THE BUBBLE. YOU CAN’T TAKEANYTHING OVER THE RAINBOW INTO FANTASY LAND.\"86.5 minutes. Apollo, the sun god comes out.87 min. A big mother spirit who fills the whole sky is now shown by Disney. Shehangs over the rainbow. When a system is built this is indeed what they put in.All go to sleep in the film.87.5 minutes. Arrows shoot the stars into the heavens. This is more programmingimagery. When you look for the rainbow, you see stars.88 min. The conductor finishes again.88.5 min. The next setting is a Venetian nobleman’s (a duke’s) palace. Curtainsopen. The use of curtains is spoken about in our previous books.89 min. Curtains open. An Ostrich begins dancing, and gets others to balletdance.90 min. The Ostriches begin dancing in a circle, this is laying the groundworkfor what the cult family does. The Assistant programmer may tell the child, \"SEEIT’S O.K. TO DANCE TOGETHER. DANCING IS ACCEPTABLE.\" The programmers will notdirectly tell the child that this represents the cult family. Fantasia portraysSatan as a terrible powerful being.91.5 min. The Ostriches are eating grapes. They are playing, looking in the pool& they are seeing bubbles.92 min. Hippos emerge out of the pool. \"IT’S O.K. TO BE DIFFERENT. IT’S O.K. TOBE STRANGE. USE YOUR CREATIVITY.\" The hippos begin to dance and dance.94 min. Elephants appear and are having fun and blowing bubbles out of theirtrunks. The programmers may be having fun blowing bubbles with the child. Theprogrammers like to mix love and hate, kindness and sadistic behavior. That waythe victim has a hard time separating love from hate. If you ask many slavesabout \"Daddy\" they will tell you that they had fun with Daddy. They areright--they had fun intermixed with sadistic torture. Bubbles continue to liftoff. One of the bubbles has a fish in it. This is imagery for the bubbleprogramming. The child victim is trained to dump their bad memories into bubblesand let them float away. The therapist will notice that many victims feel likethey are floating. They have an unreal feeling. The bubbles are floating theirbad memories away.98.5 minutes. A new setting and the hippos are hypnotically sleeping. 3 sinisteralligators that remind one of the 3 primary programmers appear. The 3 alligatorshave robes that hide them, and shadow images of themselves lurking behind them.The alligators are trying to get the hippos. The 3 alligators are portrayed likethe programmer is, he is someone to fear, love, & respect all at once. The hippois running away and dancing. The alligator dances with the hippo, but makesmenacing attempts to eat him. A flying hippo lands on an alligator. Elephants,hippos, alligators are shown. The elephants, ostriches, hippos and alligatorsall dance in fantasyland.100 min. The orchestra is dancing. ‘\"DO WHAT YOU’RE TOLD AND WE WILL HAVE FUN.\"101 min. The MC announces the next part as \"\"the struggle between the profaneand the sacred.\"’ The conductor stands in a silhouette that suggests the samepose that the upcoming Satan takes. 102 min. A high dark mountain with a castle looms in front of the viewer. Awinged, fearsome Satan figure raises his wings. His wings are sectioned likefingers with claws, and will form the imagery of the demon Malebrinche, whosesatanic claws hang over the alters and terrorize them. In the IllustratedGuidebook, the reader will find lots of these claws in the pictures lurking inthe background. A child victim will be taught to fear the hands of theprogrammer, Satan and Malebrinche. The wings (hands with claws) open. And Satanis portrayed as an awe-inspiring figure. (By the way, the word “maleficia” meansevil misfortune caused by witches. The witch in Disney’s Sleeping Beauty has thedemonic name of “Maleficent.”)102.5 min. Satan begins raising the dead skeletons. This provides a foundationto layer in the Valley of the Dry bones coming alive with armies of skeletons.104 min. The film also has some images at this point that will help with thefoundation for the Armageddon programming. Satan calls everything to himself.104.5 min. The hell pit is shown. This is laying a foundation for the hell pitwith all its demons. All kinds of vivid colors are shown in hell, to make thescene more real than real for the child victim. Satan smiles as demons burn inhell. \"NO MATTER WHAT COLOR YOU ARE, IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD YOU’LL END UP THERE.’\" 105 min. \"THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU’RE BAD. YOUR THROWN INTO THE HELL PIT.\"105.5 min. Three beautiful lady demons begin to dance in a circle, all of asudden these demons take on their Luciferian form, one becomes a goat.106 min. The demons continue to dance with powerful Satan watching over them.The hell pit and the demons are portrayed in vivid scary graphic depictions. Thehellish fire and the ghoulish dancing of its occupants continues for what seemsa long time. \"WHEN GOD FINDS OUT HOW BAD YOU ARE, LOOK AT WHAT HE’LL DO TO YOU.\"07 min. Satan is portrayed by Disney in all his evil dark majesty.107.5 min. Bells begin to ring, and the demons slink away, & the dead return tothe earth to their graveyards.108 min. Ghosts return to the graves. Soft music begins to play. “Ave Maria” bySchubert, which was written for the Catholic Church, begins playing.109 min. Satan folds himself into a mountain. ‘\"DO YOU SEE LUCIFER ANYWHERE? NO.YOU ONLY SEE A MOUNTAIN.\"110 min. Lights shine as if they are a column of moving people who are walkingwith lights, and then some walls appear.110.5 min. An arched bridge appears with its mirror image. The columns ofsilhouetted people who continue walking have mirror images in the river. Theasst. programmer will be telling the system (which the front parts will hear)\"TIME FOR ALL THE GOOD CHILDREN TO GO TO CHURCH. IT’S O.K. TO GO TO CHURCH. GOSERVE GOD.\"112 min. An opening, a vertical sliver of light comes from what appears to bedoors opening up. There is a mirror effect in the way the doors open, which willfacilitate making mirror image front worlds. A whole new world opens up, whichwill be the front system’s world. Both the front alters and the deeper ones willbe told to forget the movie. Later when a system is better programmed, theprogrammers will pull up the front alters and have them walk through these doorsinto the light. When they are hypnotically taken through these doors into thelight and away from the fear and darkness of the Kingdom of Satan, they arehypnotically told to close those doors and never look back. The Kingdom of Satanhas been shown in detail and in great length. The Kingdom of Satan has beenshown as powerful and fearful. Satan is shown as a mighty power that is to befeared. The Kingdom of Light is only shown as a peace, as a refuge from evil. Itis not shown to be good. It is not shown to have power or intelligence. It issimply a place to go to escape the fear of Satan’s power. This is all theprogrammers really want the church to be. It will be a stabilizing balance tolet the mind recuperate from the hell of the programming, but it is not intendedto be seen as greater than Satan and his Kingdom.115 min. The film ends with a peaceful gaze at heaven. The child is being toldin the last few minutes \"THAT WORLD BELONGS TO YOU. IT’S A BEAUTIFUL WORLD. IT’STHE WORLD WE WANT YOU TO LIVE IN. IT’S BEAUTIFUL.\" After all the hell that iseventually dumped on the child, and the scare that Satan gives them in thisFantasia film, the child is only too happy to create a beautiful world to livein.The effectiveness of Disney’s Fantasia is that it is used to communicate to andbuild the unconscious structures within the child’s mind. The unconscious mindis the seat of our creative abilities. Then the conscious mind makes adaptationsupon this unconscious thinking.SummaryNow that the reader has covered so much, the following quotes take on evendeeper meaning:Joe Flower in Prince of the Magic Kingdom, “Walt Disney was obsessed withcreation, driven to build magical worlds not, as many artists are, out of paintand canvas, or words, or even film, but physically, out of concrete, wires,smoke, electricity, and highly programmed employees.\" (p. 23) Julian Halevy in Nation decries Disney taking this nation into a \"drift tofantasy.\" He adds, \"...one feels our whole culture heading up the dark river tothe source--that heart of darkness where Mr. Disney traffics in pastel trinketedevil for gold and ivory.\" For those who understand programming Aubrey Menencomments about Disney’s success are profoundly appropriate, \"the strongestdesire an artist knows...to create a world of his own where everything is justas he imagines it.\" John Ciardi was not so nice, he termed Walt Disney as \"theshyster in the backroom of illusion.\" Eliot said, \"While his filmed fairy talesmay have appeared at first glance to be light and dreamlike, upon closerexamination they seemed more nightmares of deconstructed reality in league withthe era’s leading neo-Freudian Modernists.\"You have now finished reading a never-before-heard, unprecedented warning aboutthe Dark Reality of the Disney’s Magic Kingdom, and how it fits in withmind-control. Most Americans when surveyed say they believe in God, most go tochurch, and many believe they are born-again. Because of the Illuminati’sdeception campaign over several generations, the American public, and the worldin general has been led to believe that Disney was good, and that Walt Disneywas a good man. Because of his image, people suspended judgement about Disneyand Disney movies. They entrusted their children to him. People had beenmanipulated into a frame of mind, a predisposition that whatever comes out ofDisney is good. They entrusted their children to take in what Disney fed theirchildren’s little minds week after week. The public’s predisposition of trustwas used to introduce Illuminati beliefs and their political agenda, and tocarry out a vast program of trauma-based mind-control on hundreds of thousandsof tiny little children, whose minds and souls were stolen from them. Becausemany of the child slaves, who are programmed with Disney-themes, are programmedwith roles in bringing in the Anti-Christ, Walt Disney and his family haveplayed a major role for the Anti-Christ. And now you can see how accurate theWord of God is when it says, “What is highly esteemed among men, is anabomination to God.”First, there will be an Overview of the types of sources used, and then willfollow a partial Bibliography on this Disney Section.Types of SourcesPeople who have worked for Disney and who are getting pensions and medicalinsurance have talked about Disney under the condition of anonymity. This isbecause the Disney hierarchy will not permit exposure without retaliation.Several non-Disney people who helped with discovering facts for this sectionwere threatened that their children lives would be taken if they continued toinvestigate Disney. What I (Fritz Springmeier) finally have put in this, issolely my responsibility. * One type of source for this was books on the Hollywood Film Industry and books on Disney Films. There were about 20 books of this category which were perused for a better understanding of who the Disney brothers were and what Disney Co. was about. One of the best in this type of source was The Art of Walt Disney from Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdom by Christopher Finch (NY: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1975.) * Another type of source were the standard biographical reference books such as Who’s Who, Who’s Who in the West (1951), World Biography, Who Was Who,, Current Biography 1952, etc. * Another type of source was critics of Disney’s movies such as several articles exposing the Lion King, Media Spotlight’s article Fantasia, Rush Limbaugh’s comments and statements concerning how Disney had betrayed its viewers’ trust, the Spotlight’s Feb. 26, ‘96 p. 31 article \"Disney Turns Back on Family Values.\"’ * Another type of source was magazine and newspaper articles about Disney such as the Oregonian’s article on a Disney director being a convicted child molester. NY Times, Newsweek and other magazines and newspaper sources. An important series of extremely good investigative reports which were written by Harry V. Martin for the Napa Sentinel in 1989 were very important in learning of some of the Illuminati/CIA/Contra/Drug Running activities in Napa Valley, CA that Roy Disney is associated with. Harry V. Martin went into all kinds of records and did an excellent job of investigative reporting. The magazine Monde 2000, No.12, had an article on non-lethal weapons that the NWO is developing. This article was reprinted in Encounter Chronicles Journal of Scientific Intelligence, and discussed how Disney has been working with Sandia Labs and Los Alamos. * Another type of source were victims of Illuminati mind-control, who have recovered memories of being programmed at Disneyland and Disneyworld. Another type of source has been to watch Disney movies as an investigative tool to understand how Disney is programming, how they are skillfully indoctrinating the American people into witchcraft, etc. This author has also personally been to both Disneyland, near Anaheim, CA and Disneyworld, near Orlando, FL. * Another source was the Walt Disney Co.’s Annual Reports, and also the reference book Directory of Corporate Affiliations (1986) published by the National Register Pub. Co. * Another type of source were books which specialized in covering details about Disneyland such as Disneyland And Beyond the Ultimate Family Guidebook (edited by Ray Riegert, and printed by Ulysses Press of Berkeley, CA); and Walt Disney’s Disneyland (by Martin A. Sklar and introduced by Walt Disney.) The AAA had a 27-page booklet \"Disneyland Park and Southern California\", which came out in 1996, which provides information on what is being offered at Disneyland and vicinity. The book refers repeatedly to \"Disney Magic\". One has to wonder how Christians and non-occultic persons can’t see how occult Disney is.[../images/00001.jpeg]Partial BibliographyBooks. * Disneyland Park and Southern California. 1996. * The Walt Disney Co.’s Annual Reports. pub. by the Walt Disney Co. annually. * Auletta, Ken.

Part of my research onthe family has been packed away and I hope to recover some more of it foranother article.The Reynolds Are a Very Elite Illuminati FamilyThe Reynold’s family is not one of the 13 primary bloodlines, but they are sucha prominent Illuminati family within the 13 bloodlines that I have decided tosingle them out for another article on Illuminati bloodlines. Although theReynolds are allied with many of the major Satanic bloodlines, including theRothschilds, the DuPonts, the Rockefellers, the Graces and the Grays, they areespecially close and intertwined to the Duke and Cullman families. (One exampleof a Duke/Reynold joint project is the Research Triangle Foundation.) It shouldbe remembered that The Temporary National Economic Committee of Congress in 1937which studied the super-rich found that the Dukes and the Reynolds were amongthe top 13 wealthiest families in America. Further, my research at one place oranother has shown that the Reynolds of the Illuminati variety have interactedwith all of the other major Satanic bloodlines. These elite birds of a featherall flock together.My Newsletter Has Repeatedly Exposed Members of This FamilyDuring the course of putting out this newsletter in ‘92-’95, I have had repeatedopportunities to include various members of the Reynold’s bloodline in myexposes. It must always be borne in mind that a large share of each of thesebloodlines are hidden behind other last names.Within this area, my newsletter has exposed Reynold family members of theIlluminati from Astoria, Oregon (such as Scottish Rite Librarian/MorticianReynolds) and Bend, Oregon (such as Mayor Paul Reynolds who also runs amortuary, and his son Mark). One of the first Illuminati Monarch slaves in thePortland area to seek her freedom was Mary D. Reynolds. She was from the Motherof Darkness level. She wanted to find treatment for the programming that goeswith the Mother of Darkness level, and since wanting her freedom it is anybody’sguess what happened to her.Occult BooksSome of the Reynolds’ family have written occult books. I don’t know how all thepeople mentioned in this section are related, but some or all of these peoplemay relate to the Satanic Reynold’s bloodline. One of the important ecumenicalChristian leaders is Frank E. Reynolds who is an American Baptist Minister(ordained 1955, Program dir. Student Christian Ctr. Bangkok, Thailand, Ministerfor Chicago Ecumenical Ministries ‘61-‘64.) Frank E. Reynolds has been trying tointroduce Buddhism to America. He and his wife Mani have written a number ofbooks to introduce and teach Buddhism to Americans. Many of the Reynolds havebeen Episcopalians. Remember the Episcopalian Church is run by Freemasons and isthoroughly sold out to the occult. One of my Monarch survivors vividly recalls ahuman sacrifice done at the altar of an Episcopalian church. Anyway, gettingback to the names of some Reynolds who have written occult books, here is a listof some: * Barrio Gordon Robert Reynolds--author of Magic. Divination & Witchcraft among the Barotse of Northern Rhodesia (1963) * Charles R. Reynolds w/ Regina Reynolds--authors of One Hundred Years of Magic Posters (1977) * David K. R. Reynolds--author of Naikan Psychotherapy: Meditation for Self-Development pub. by Chicago Press. * Denise AR. Reynolds--Sensitive Thoughts for the New Wave Soul. * Mani R Reynolds w/ her husband--Three Worlds According to King Ruana: A Thai Buddhist Cosmology Frank E. Reynolds--Guide To Buddhist Religion * Jane Reynolds--Cosmobiology * Lloyd J. K.-- My Dear Runemeister: A Voyage Through the AlphabetOverview of Financial Interests of the ReynoldsBefore we get into the nitty-gritty let’s take a quick overview of the Reynold’sfinancial interests. Much of the family’s money has been well-hidden behindfronts, holding companies, etc. The Satanists of the Reynolds family have beeninvolved in high level drug dealing during this century. They have also had someimportant and major interests in Banking, Tobacco, and Aluminum, it seems like afair number have gotten into the mortuary/cremation business, which is a greatassistance for cremation after rituals involving human sacrifice. The financialinterests of the Reynolds seem to be strongest in the Middle South, and strongin both Virginia and North Carolina. The Reynold’s financial interests are sotightly woven in with the Cuilmans and Dukes that I will have to deal with allthree families together. A few years ago the financial heads of the threefamilies were as follows: Angier Biddle Duke, Richard S. Reynolds, Jr., andJoseph F. Cullman, 3rd. All were members of the Pilgrim Society. It is possiblethat the family also has sonic type of secret spiritual hierarchy too. If so, itmight follow along the lines of the top 13 families which have kings andprinces, and princesses, etc. of their bloodlines. Richard S. Reynolds, Jr. hasbeen a board chairman of Robertshaw Controls Company, which has a strangleholdmonopoly on manufacturing car thermostats and other car parts. The big threeAmerican auto manufacturers all buy from Robertshaw Controls Company; but thensince all 3 of the American auto manufacturers are Illuminati controlled, theylikely don’t care that the Reynolds family has such a stranglehold on them.Cadence which own theaters and has published occult comic books like the series,Journey into Mystery with the Mighty Thor is also tied to the Reynolds family.Cadence promotes the occult while making money. What American doesn’t know what“Reynold’s wrap\" is. The Reynold’s name is a well-known household name just likeDuPont paints, or the Rockefeller Center, or the Waldorf Astoria are well knownAmerican items named after Illuminati families. The Reynolds family controlsseveral Aluminum companies which form a large part of the Illuminati-controlledAluminum cartel. The Mellon family works with the Reynolds in this Aluminumcartel, and various Illuminati families also have their hands in the managementof the Aluminum industry.The Tobacco-Drug ConnectionThe Reynolds family is behind the RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co. C. Boyden Gray of theSatanic Grey/Gray family is heir to the RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co. But don’t letthat sidetrack you, the Reynolds family still has financial interests and powerin the company. If readers remember previous articles on top 13 Illuminatifamilies--specifically, the Astor family article, the Onassis family article andthe Li family article you will remember some details that will help youunderstand the secret illegal drug trade that the Reynold’s got involved in. TheBritish elite got involved in shipping opium. The elite families got monopolieson the opium trade. The British Empire’s military might and political clout wasused to force China to allow the opium trade- Before the communists took overChina, the British Illuminati families hid their opium trade behind the cover ofthe British American Tobacco Co. Later the Red Chinese would hide their opiumtrading behind the same front tobacco, with their state-run People’s Republic ofChina Tobacco Bureau. In fact, the Red Chinese opium trade was controlled byanother Illuminatus, the P.R. President Li Xiannian. Li Xiannian is from theoccult U family who are proud that they are the leading oriental Satanic family.President Li, a drug lord was finance minister of Red China from ’57-’75. Hesold so much opium to the west that he was able to help Red China pay off herdebts, and he was nicknamed “the money god.” RJ. Reynolds was a partner withBritish American Tobacco Co. and was also involved in trading in opium for manyyears. R.J. Reynolds was also involved with the rigidly controlled tobaccoindustry. I have reasons to suspect that the family later got involved withrunning cocaine. Onassis also hid his early drug smuggling behind tobaccoimporting. The Dukes controlled Liggett & Myers Tobacco via their DukeEndowment, a family foundation. The Cullmans are known for their Miller BrewingCompany. The Cullman fortune was also originally derived via a tobacco company.The Duke family via underhanded tactics put together a monopoly of the tobaccoindustry called the American Tobacco Company. Later they merged and bought out88 tobacco companies, and the capitalization of the company was $235 millionprior to 1911. The Supreme Court made the American Tobacco Company dissolvesince it had created an illegal monopoly. However, the Dukes rearranged thingsand kept on going. The Dukes intermarried with the Biddies who worked with theRothschilds. The Dukes also intermarried with the Drexels, who in turnintermarried with the Harrimans and Goulds. Nicholas Biddle (1879-1923) was atrustee of the Illuminatus William Astor of the top 13 Illuminati family ofAstors. Some of the Biddies intermarried with the Astors Illuminati family too!It’s a small world at the top. Researcher Ferdinand Lundberg in his bookAmerica’s 60 Families states on p. 36, \"The Morgan firm and its affiliatedcommercial banks act, broadly, on behalf of such tremendous accumulations asthose of the Vanderbilts, Goulds, Drexels, Wideners, Berwinds, Phippses, Hills,Dukes, Ryans, McCormicks, Bakers, DuPonts, Fishers, Jameses, and Others.” Isn’tit interesting that my writings have exposed the Morgans, Vanderbilts, Goulds,Drexels, Phippses, Dukes, Bakers, DuPonts as families with members in theIlluminati?Connections to Illuminati OrganizationsMany of the Illuminati organizations which this newsletter has exposed have hadmembers from the Reynolds family. Some examples of this follow: * COSMOS CLUB Joseph Melvin Reynolds, Lloyd George Reynolds * COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS (CFR). A. William Reynolds * PILGRIM SOCIETY: Richard S. Reynolds, Jr. * 33° MASONS. Harman Gansvort Reynolds, Marshall S. Reynolds * 32° MASONS: Arthur Rowley Reynolds, Benn Phillips Reynolds, Charles Phillip Reynolds, Charles Shaw Reynolds, Erwin James Reynolds, Isaac Reynolds, Harry Edwards Reynolds, Henry James Reynolds, John C. Reynolds (Deputy Grand Secy of Grand Lodge of Illinois) * KNIGHTS TEMPLAR MASONS. (These 3 KT names all come from just one Lodge in NY-- Jerusalem Chapter No. 8) Alex Reynolds, J. Hyatt Reynolds, T. Spaulding Reynolds * KNIGHTS OF MALTA John Charles Reynolds, who worked for the Graces as a communications executive, trustee of the Presb. Hospital in San Juan.Foundations and Connections The Dukes and Reynolds use tax-free foundations as a vehicle to escape taxes andhid their wealth while maintaining their financial power. Other Illuminatifamilies also used the foundations as a scheme to remain powerful and to resistpaying taxes. The controlled press builds them up as charitable, when most ofthe grants by these foundations are self-serving for the benefit of the elite.Some of these foundations are the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation (est. ’36 inNorth Carolina), the Kate B. Reynolds Foundation (est. ’46 in North Carolina),the Richard S. Reynolds Foundation (est. ’55 in Virginia), and the Mary ReynoldsBabcock Foundation, and the Duke Endowment (address at Rockefeller Plaza, NY).All of these foundations work for the Illuminati. The Donald W. ReynoldsFoundation (est. ’54 in Nevada and then moved to Arkansas) might also beconnected to the elite--but I don’t know. The Kate B. Reynolds Health Care Trustprovides another example of a liaison between the Duke and Reynolds families.John A. McMahon, a Duke University grad, served as BOTH chairman of the board oftrustees of Duke University and since 1971 as a member of the advisory board tothe Kate B. Reynolds Health Care Trust. Here is an example of a single manworking for the interests of both the Dukes and Reynolds. Edwin C. Whitehead,chairman of Technicon Corp. serves as a similar example of a man working forboth Duke and Rockefeller interests. Whitehead is a trustee of both DukeUniversity and Rockefeller University. He also has been in charge of several NWOorganizations promoting a one-world, for instance he was Governor of the U.N.Association. This article will now show you the reader some of the grants thatthese foundations make. I ask you, \"Do you see any possibility for any mischiefbehind these grants?! What I noticed about the Reynolds grants is that theycontrol all the crisis centers in the North Carolina area via their money. Thismeans any survivor of SRA calling a hot line is going to get tapped into theIlluminati’s net for catching escapees! I also noticed that all the colleges anduniversities got money, and a variety of different denominations incl. theBaptists, the Methodists, the Non-denominationalists, the Presbyterians, and theEcumenicalists. What surprised me was that a number of government agencies getmoney from the Reynold Foundations, especially those dealing with children likeSocial Services, and even Police Departments get money from the ReynoldsFoundations.IN 1984 the Z. SMITH REYNOLDS FOUNDATION in North Carolina gave money to thesefollowing organizations (plus some others not listed): * Catawba College - $75,000 * Chapel Hill Police Department - $37,500 * Child Watch - $25,000 * Contact of Winston-Salem (a crisis counseling service) - $15,000 * Council on Drug Abuse - $27,000 * Elizabeth City State University - $50,000 * Family & Children’s Service of Greater Greensboro (they deal with Rape & Family Abuse) - $5,000 * Friends of Public Radio - $25,000 (Note: they even want to control public radio!) * General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina - $85,000 (The love of money is the root...) * Mars Hill College - $30,000 * Meredith College - $9,360 * Montreat-Anderson College - $17,280 * Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital - $31,000 * North Carolina Center for Public Policy Research - $225,200 (Wow!) * North Carolina Department of Human Resources (foster homes) - $12,000 * North Carolina Department of Natural Resources - $30,000 * North Carolina Department of Public Instruction - $103,000 * North Carolina Hospital Education & Research Foundation - $50,213 * North Carolina Justice Academy - $10,000 * North Carolina School Boards Association - $7,500 * Outer Banks Hotline (crisis Counseling) . $5,000 * Pitt County Memorial Hospital - $35,000 * Planned Parenthood of Greater Raleigh - $15,000 (The Illuminati foundations have been the big support behind Planned Parenthood. The Van Duyn family was tied to Planned Parenthood in NY.) * Planned Parenthood of Orange Co. - $15,000 * Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights Education Fund - $10,500 * Rowan Cooperative Christian Ministry - $15,000 St. Mary’s Episcopal Church - $10,000 * Salvation Army of Waynesville - $20,000 * University of North Carolina - $233,265 * Western North Carolina Amer. Meth.-Episco. Zion Church - $25,000 * YMCA of Winston-Salem - $300,000 In 1989 there were more grants of a similar nature. The following are by justthe Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation in 1989. I have picked (Just a few to list sothat the reader can get an idea of the breadth of their grants to religiousbodies and child protective groups.) * Advocates for Children in Court - $25,000 * Child Care Resources - $40,000 * Duke-UNC Center for Research on Women - $60,000 * Ebenezer Baptist Church - $8,000 * First Baptist Church - $15,000 * God’s Harvest House of Deliverance Church $10,004 * Metropolitan A.M.E. Zion Church - $27,100 * National Conference of Christians & Jews $5,000 (The Illuminati have always well financed this organization.) * Rape Crisis Center, Asheville, NC - $20,000 * Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights Education Fund - $7,500 * St. Andrews Presbyterian College - $50,000 * Women’s Abuse Shelter - $15,000I don’t want to take more time and space with listing foundation figures, 1 hopethe reader gets the picture of how these foundations are able to control societyfor the Illuminati. We see government agencies, especially the ones that theIlluminati would want to make sure they controlled are well supportedfinancially. People who live in the Carolinas & Virginia report that thecorruption in those states in absolute. These statistics give some facts behindthose statements. One organization receiving money above deserves exposure. TheDrug Abuse Council (Council on Drug Abuse) has been headed by an Illuminatus &Pilgrim Society member Bethuel M. Webster.R.J. Reynolds IndustriesR.J. Reynolds Industries of Winston-Salem, North Carolina had an annual sales ofover $6 billion and 37,000 employees. I have the 1976 profit figure for thecompany was $353 million. I don’t know what the current figures are. The publicthinks that the shares are widely held by the public, while in reality thecontrol is very narrow. The Reynolds were careful when their stocks went on themarket to retain secret control. R.J. Reynolds Industries chairman was ColinStokes. Colin Stokes is an interesting person who works for the Reynolds. He wasa member of Kiwanis International, and a director of several key things, dir. ofWinston-Salem Savings & Loan, Integon Corp., and NCNB Corporation which is thebank holding company of North Carolina National Bank. The NCNB, which at onetime had assets of $4.647 billion (it may be more now) has been the largest ofthe Middle South banks and is a key component of the Reynold/Duke/Cullmanclique. From 1958 to 1964, Stokes was a director of the William and Kate B.Reynolds Memorial Park, and further serves the Reynolds as trustee of the WakeForest Univ. Another interesting liaison person for the Reynolds has been J.P.Sticht, a director of R.J. Reynolds, who has acted as a liaison between theReynolds, Duke, and Rockefeller dynasties. Sticht is a member of RockefellerUniversity Council, and a member of the board of visitors to Duke University.Leighton Hammond Coleman, who is in the Illuminati from the Satanic Colemanfamily, also sits as emeritus director of RJ. Reynolds Industries. His fatherand him both belonged to the Pilgrim Society, which is a level above the CFR inthe Illuminati political section. His father was a director of the corruptAmerican-Russian Chamber of Commerce which has been previously exposed in mywritings. Now readers can see why RJ. Reynolds Industries has been one of thetop companies trading with Communist Russia in the past. Another director ofR.J. Reynolds Industries is John D. Macomber, a 1950 Yale graduate. (I don’tknow if he belonged to one of the Illuminati’s five fraternities at Yale ornot.) Macomber married into the Illuminati Morgan family, and is a member of thePilgrim Society. Besides being a director for Li. Reynolds, he serves theRockefellers as a director of Chase Manhattan. He is also dir. of Norlin Corp.Gordon Gray, of the satanic Gray family, also sits on the Li. Reynolds board.Both Gordon Gray and John Macomber belong to the CFR.. Gray also went to Yale(‘33 grad.) and was with Triangle Broadcasting run by Pilgrim Society memberWalter H. Annenberg (who is close to being a billionaire). As you can see, someheavy duty Illuminati men direct Li. Reynolds Industries. Gray, a member of theCFR., also served as a liaison to the Corcoran financial interests. William W.Corcoran was a corrupt Washington banker who had a lily white front. Corcoranbribed the chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee so that he couldillegally profit a half million dollars for being the middle man of thetransaction of the U.S. paying off its debt to Mexico for lands taken during theMexican War. (See Reports of Committees, Thirty-third Congress, First Session,Volume iii, # 354:4.) The U.S. did not need a middle man to pay off Mexico, butdue to corruption in Congress, Corcoran was able to make a bundle of money withno effort. Riggs Bank is associated with the Corcoran fortune. CFR & Yale Grad &Pilgrim Soc. member William McChesney Martin, Jr. has worked for Riggs NationalBank as their advisor. The multitude of connections of people serving theReynolds to the elite are mind-boggling. Many of the institutions in the MiddleSouth connect back to the Illuminati and their front organizations such as theFreemasons and the Chambers of Commerce, the CFR etc. etc. Some of the companiesthat R.J. Reynolds Industries interlocks with are Arista Co., Avon Products,Charlette, NC branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Dun & BroadstreetCompanies, Foremost-McKesson Inc., Hatteras Income Securities, Hayes-AlbionCorp., Jefferson Pilot Corp., McClean Industries, Northwestern Mutual LifeInsurance, Perkin Elmer Corp., Richardson-Merrell Inc., S.C. Johnson & SonsInc., Southern Broadcasting Inc., Standard Oil Co. of Indiana, Standard Savings& Loan, Stauffer Chemical Co., United States Filter Corp., United States SteelCorp., Wachovia Corp. I doubt if this is current information, but needless tosay, Li. Reynolds Industries today interlocks with many other corporations.Other Reynold/Duke CompaniesThe Reynolds Metals Company- notice I wrote \"Metals Company\"- interlocks with alarge number of companies too. The Reynolds Metals Company has had most of itsdirectors from the Reynold’s family. Recently, four were on the board ofdirectors and one was the company treasurer. One of companies that the ReynoldsMetals Company interlocks with is the Bank of Virginia. The Bank of Virginia inturn interlocks with a long list of companies. A large share of these companieshave directors that tie back to the elite. Some of these corporations havedirectors who are members of the Pilgrim Society, others are with otherIlluminati organizations. If the entire set of interlocks and there directorswere exposed it might have an emotional impact on the reader, but it getswearisome to the eyes to be stressed with so many lists, so I will dispense withlisting other interlocks. Terry Sanford has worked for the Duke family as adirector of the American Arbitration Association, which is an Illuminati front.The Astor family is represented in the AAA by David W. Peck. Terry Stanford hasbeen an FBI agent, is the former governor of North Carolina, and president ofDuke University. Stanford is also chairman of the Cordell Hull Foundation forInternational Education which had another Duke/Reynolds henchman Dean W. Colvardas its trustee. Colvard also has been an advisor to the Illuminati controlledKellogg Foundation of Battle Creek, MI. Reynolds Securities in New York has beenrun by William Christian Miller, a member of the Pilgrim Society. WilliamChristian Miller, an Illuminatus, has sat on the board of many corporations.Richard S. Reynolds, Jr. of the Illuminati has sat on the board of CentralNational of Richmond Corp. which is a holding company for the Central NationalBank of Richmond. His younger brother David has sat on the board of UnitedVirginia Bancshares Board. Hugh Cullman is a director of United VirginiaBancshares. Hugh’s cousin is in the Pilgrim Society. Hugh is also president ofPhilip Moms Inc., Richmond Corp., and Foreign Policy Association, and theInternational Chamber of Commerce. Also working with him on the board of UnitedVirginia Bancshares has been Herbert Stein, a director of Reynolds MetalsCompany. Stein also worked for L.F. Rothschild and Company as a consultant from1976 onward. Another director working with Stein, David Reynolds, and HughCullman is Kenneth A. Randall, a Mormon. Kenneth A. Randall is a trustee of theRockefellers Council of the Americas and works with various Illuminati membersat other places too. Some of the Reynolds are Mormons. George Reynolds wroteCommentary on the Book of Mormon and Commentary on the Pearl of Great Price.Eskimo Pie Co. is just one of many that the Reynolds have controlled. JulianLouis Reynolds is on both the board of the Metals Co. and the Eskimo Pie Co.Review About Reynold CompaniesThis article has only touched on what the Reynold family operates. However, thethrust of what this part of the article is saying is that the Reynold familyworks with many other elite Illuminati families, and is active in banking,aluminum, and tobacco.The Reynolds family is an elite Illuminati family which ranks right up therewith the top 13 Illuminati families. They have a very extensive power base butare strongest in the Middle South. Some Reynolds of Note -- Known Illuminati Members Are Given Three Asteriks *** * Mrs. Mn.

The McDonald’s Corp.has been rumored for years to be connected to Satanism. In fact a book whichtries to debunk belief in a Satanic conspiracy entitled Satan Wants You reportedthe rumor that Mc Donald’s owner Ray Kroc tithed to the Church of Satan. (seeSatan Wants You, pg. 140). Ray Kroc does spend time with NWO elites and is amember of the Bohemian Grove. There is no doubt that the McDonald’s Corp. has aninside track with the Illuminati, because the U.S. government has givenaccording to one source 40 million dollars in public tax money to McDonalds tohelp them set up McDonald Restaurants in foreign countries under the disguisethat this was money spent on foreign policy. In 1991, the total of McDonaldoutlets (restaurants) in the 3 primary European nations of Britain, France andWest Germany totaled 959 restaurants.In spite of the millions of dollars of tax dollars the U.S. has given toMcDonalds Corp., the money doesn’t seem to be directly connected to theMcDonalds family, because the McDonalds family (Richard and Maurice McDonaldknown as ‘Dick\" and \"Mac\") which started the restaurants in 1937 were bought outby Ray Kroc around 1954. By the time Ray Kroc had bought out the McDonaldbrothers, they had a very successful business going. The McDonald brothers livedin the rich section of San Bernardino, and had around 11 McDonald restaurants.The brothers made about $100,000 profit a year and were quite content. TheMcDonalds had designed the golden arches and had put together the fast-foodconcept and had been selling franchises. However, the McDonalds were toocontent. The McDonalds didn’t want to expand, and when Ray Kroc formedMcDonald’s System. Inc. on Mar. 2, 1955 after buying out the brothers withborrowed money, he vigorously went to work to develop McDonalds into theinternational francize that it is. Ray Kroc (bn. 10/5/194)2 in Oak Park,Chicago) lived frugally for many years putting his whole life into building upthe McDonald’s franchise. It was his drive that took a good idea and changed itfrom a success in Hollywood and San Bernardino into an international success.Ray Kroc knew a good idea when he saw it, and developed other people’s goodideas into a great success.James A. Collins, chairman of Collins Foods International, now the largestKentucky Fried Chicken franchisee and the operator of Sizzler Restaurants talkedabout his time with the McDonalds in 1952, “There was a fraternity of us, andevery one of us saw the McDonald’s in San Bernardino and basically copied itafter the boys [the McDonald brothers gave us a tour.\" \"We all took our lessonsfrom the McDonald brothers,\" Collins remembers. The concepts that franchises payfor the McDonald brothers were giving out free, and Collins turned around andbegan getting $100 a day training people from Carnation, with the concepts thatthe McDonalds had shared. Henry’s Drive Ins and Ken’s were McDonald look-alikesthat started from people trained by Collins. Glen Bell who started Taco Bell,who patronized the McDonald’s main restaurant in San Bernardino started TacoBell from ideas from McDonalds. The first year Collins imitated McDonalds withhis own fast food restaurant, Collins made $80,000 a year take home pay. TheMcDonald brothers became a part of the local elite of San Bernardino, CAalongside such rich local families as Guthrie, Stater, and Harris. Readers arereminded of all the articles in my newsletters about how San Bernardino is amajor headquarters for the Illuminati and Satanic Hubs because there are so manythousands of practitioners of black magic in the area. I do know from workingwith survivors of the Illuminati that the McDonald family has part of theirpeople in the Illuminati. How far back does the McDonald family go in theoccult? The McDonald family was a Scottish clan that was part of Druidism. Manyof the McDonalds have gone on to serve Christ. However, there is still a largepowerful contingent of the McDonald family which is connected to the MysteryReligions, and which has family members who are part of the Illuminati. Each ofthe major Scottish clans had an area that they controlled of Scotland. TheMcDonalds controlled the islands and coastal areas on the west coast ofScotland. When the Knights Templars tied persecution, in order to escape thevarious British fleets, they sailed a route that took them to western Scotland.During the time of King Philippe IV of France, the McDonalds were involved inthe movement of the Knights Templars. The Knights Templars had adoptedgnostic/satanic practices during the centuries they guarded the pilgrims in theMiddle East. The Order had also become the International Bankers of Europe andlarge landowners in Europe. The King of France twisted the Pope’s arm (so tospeak) to get him to go along with a campaign to eliminate the Knights Templars.Because the McDonald clan was in private still pagan, they were willing to helpthe Knights Templar escape the Pope’s decree against the Templars.The Knights Templars were not the only International Bankers to move north.Later, during the 16th 17th century, the elite satanic banking families movedtheir operations from southern Europe to Antwerp Flanders and then on toAmsterdam. Many of the Knights Templars lied to Scotland, where they helpedBruce, the King of Scotland. When the English invaded Scotland they weredefeated by Bruce in an important battle named Bannockburn. Bannockburn keptScotland free from England for the next 289 years. The Knights Templars foughtwith Bruce in the battle under the command of Angus Og McDonald, who was a largeScottish landowner and a friend of Bruce. Angus Og McDonald had previously inthe 1308 time period given protection to the Knights Templars. The KnightsTemplars brought their treasures and their military might to Scotland & to theMcDonalds. Many of the Knights Templars went on to the Orkeney Is., but somestayed in Scotland and became important in the occult world. The descendants ofthese Knights are still guarding some important occult relics, which may berevealed in the next few years. The Sinclair family has been part of the Prieurede Sion, Freemasonry and the Illuminati. Vice-pres. of the Sinclair Oil & GasCo. in Tulsa in ’59-’61 was Marshall McDonald, who was an active Freemason whomarried into the Collins family. Note that the cities/towns Tulsa, Wagoneer,Muskogee, Broken Arrow in Okla. are totally controlled by the Illuminati. Theatmosphere in these little towns SW of Tulsa has been described as oppressiveprone to violence by people who have lived in them. One of the lodge systems setup by the Illuminati was the Jacobin Club (originally known as Club Breton). ItsJacobite members got financing from the Illuminati and were a big part of thecause of the French Revolution. The Jacobites also played a role in the earlyhistory of the United States and the American Revolution. The Jacobites had anumber of aristocrats who were also secret Satanists as their leaders. They hada lodge in Rome. One of the Scottish Jacobites was Flora Macdonald. She savedPrince Charles Edward’s life. Etienne Jacques Joseph Alexandre Macdonald(Scottish blood) was a 330 Freemason & also an officer who fought on the side ofthe French Revolution. He went on to become a Marshall in the French army. In1805, he became the Grand Administrator of the Grand Lodge Symbolique in France.Some Notable McDonalds Include: * Ramsay McDonald--British Prime Minister during 1920s privy to insider info, and who was in favor of working with communist Russia.

Because the CIA had funded Cameron, the U.S. Fed. govt. gave her via the Canadian govt. a $100,000 settlement, if she would not talk. A newspaper did pick up on the settlement on 11/18/92 and I have reproduced that news article at the end of this article. The money was hush money, for it was stipulated for the $100,000 out of court settlement, Linda would keep quiet about her mind control. * Robert A. McDonald--member of Bohemian Grove W.

Press * Reby E. MacDonald--The Ghosts of Austwick Manor and A Contemporary Collection on Loans from the Rothschild Bank AG, ZurichThe McDonalds and MacDonalds (and some of the Donalds) are descendants from KingSomerled. King Somerled helped expel the Vikings (Norsemen) from Scotland. KingSomerled’s son was Ranald and Ranald’s son was named Donald. The grandson thenbecame Argus Mor McDonald (mac means \"son of\") Argus’s grandson married MacRorieand became Lordship of the Isles. The McDonalds were the chiefs of that area.Families that sought their protection sometimes took their name too. So it isnot inconceivable that some of the Knights Templar bloodlines ended up one wayor the other as McDonald. The powerful McDonald of Glencoe lived in Glencoeuntil the 1692 massacre by the English government against Francis Stewartsympathizers. Francis Stewart was the Grand Master of the witchcraft covens inthat area of Scotland and the McDonalds were supporters of him. Also in the 17thcentury the McDonalds were forced to participate with others in piracy.There are some powerful Stewarts (also spelled Stuart) in the Illuminati today,some who are friends with the Rockefellers. At least one Stewart intermarriedwith a Rockefeller. Another Stewart has family members who own a series oftheaters in California which have secret tunnels to day care centers so thatchildren can be ritually abused and programmed. (This Stewart had a father inSatanism who was associated with the Hungarian palace.) James C. Stewart, amember of the Illuminati, built the Mormon’s capital building in Salt Lake City,60 Wall Tower in NY, and the Savoy Hotel in London that the Illuminati use fortheir Pilgrim Society headquarters. James belonged to the Pilgrim Soc. too. Nowthat the reader knows this, he or she will understand why this author did adouble take when I ran across Stewart McDonald, who was the director of SavoyPlaza Hotel, in New York. a place frequented by the elite. Stewart McDonald waspresident of Army War Shows in ’42-’43. See the article on the Van Duyns in thisnewsletter to understand the connections between the Army War Shows and thesecret mind-control ops done in W.W.ll under the auspices of the Illuminati.Stewart McDonald was also the police commissioner in corrupt St. Louis, MO andthe Fed. Housing Administrator for Wash. D.C., as well as being an automanufacturer. There is a Stuart who actually has a stronger claim to the throneof England than Queen Elizabeth. He is 11th in line as a claimant, while she isonly 13th. His claim is a carefully preserved secret by the media. QueenElizabeth is of the Hannover Dynasty which is part of the 13th Illuminatibloodline. This Stuart claimant was recently asked if he would like to have thethrone of the newly formed nation of Estonia, but he rejected it. The Stuartbloodline and their henchmen have been an important part of the leadership ofFreemasonry down through the centuries. The Scottish Stewart family, as well asthe Cameron, Campbell, Douglas, Hamilton, and Montgomery Scottish families wereoriginally powerful families that came from Flanders area (now Belgium & north.France) which is today a strong point for the Illuminati. These familiesimmigrated to Scotland in the 12th century and were part of the strong occultbonds between Scotland and the Flanders area. (Today, Flanders is dividedbetween northern France and Belgium.) Later, Flanders became a banking centerfor the International Bankers. The Hungarian occult world also connects toScotland with such ancient historical figures as Saint Margaret (a Hungariannoble), whose husband Malcolm Ceanmor murdered in real life Macbeth. Her sonDavid introduced feudalism into Scotland, and she herself brought in CatholicPriests. There are many occult ties between Scotland, Flanders, Hungary, andRome. Parts of the McDonalds continue to practice Druidism, which was theoriginal religion prior to the Christians. The McDonald heritage goes back tothe Picts and Gaelic people. Some of the McDonalds have become part of theCatholic hierarchy. I believe I know of five MacDonalds which have become AirMarshalls (top rank) in the British RAY. The names of these RAF Marshalls are:Someried Douglas McDonald, Thomas Conchar McDonald, Sir William McDonald, AirCommander John C. McDonald, and Major General John Frederick Matheson McDonald.The NWO has been called the Air Dictatorship because the NWO’s air power will beso important, so it is significant that the RAF has had so many high officerswho were MacDonalds. Just one example of the tie-ins, the british Minister ofAviation Roy Jenkins (64-65) has been part of the Trilateral Commission. ThomasConchar MacDonald did secret research for the Air Ministry after WW II. He wentto the Univ. of Glasgow. Another Marshall Sir William Laurence Niary) MacDonaldwas involved with British Air Force Intelligence. A number of other McDonaldshave worked for intelligence agencies to, incl. David George McDonald, JamesMichael McDonald, Jr. etc. William McDonald was a doctor who worked with FDR in1925.Henry Ford also spent time with a doctor named William McDonald. A number ofMcDonalds are Bankers (or important in the Stock Markets) and in an attempt tokeep this article brief I’ll just list some of them: Andrew Jewett McDonald(Yale, USAF), Archibald MacDonald, Allen Colfax McDonald, Angus Daniel McDonald,John Garwin McDonald, William Henry McDonald (Can.), and Witten McDonald.Archibald NiacDonald is director of Joseph Freeman, Sons & Co., Ltd. as well asbeing important in other things. The Freeman family is one of the top 13bloodlines and connects to the Prieure de Sion. Sir Peter George MacDonald hasbeen the director of Guardian Assurance Co. Ltd. which also has connections tothe Freeman family and the Prieure de Sion. There is a long list of McDonaldswho have served various governments all over the world in leadership positions.Danny Lee McDonald of Tulsa, OK served on the corrupt Federal ElectionCommission (’82-’83) as its vice-chairman, and from ‘83 onward he served as itschairman. William C. McDonald was the first state governor of New Mexico from1911-17. The Freemasons ran the state at that time.This author would wear the reader’s patience thin by describing all theMcDonald’s who have been in important government jobs. The policeman who foundLee Harvey Oswald after JFK was shot was a McDonald. This policeman was thenassigned to protect Marinna Oswald (the widow of Lee Harvey Oswald). Thisheavy-set policeman McDonald (who attends the Oakridge Christian Church) hasappeared on television recently such as on Channel 32, on Top Cops at 7:25 p.m.where he speaks out against conspiracy theories in the JFK assassination. Theentire arrest of Oswald by M.N. McDonald is filled with questions. Jack Ruby wasin the same theater. Oswald tried to shoot McDonald with an unloaded gun. Someunknown person had tipped McDonald off that Oswald was in the theater, and thepolice had for some reason already decided Oswald was guilty because whilearresting him the policeman was heard saying by witnesses, \"Kill the President,will you.\" And yet the Warren Commission said that Oswald was not a suspectuntil later. This is just one place of many where the McDonald family connectsin with the larger Satanic conspiracy. Jack Ruby was involved with the CarouselClub which was tied to the Monarch Project. The assassination of JFK was donethrough Permindex, which was set up by Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, who worked forthe Illuminati in SOE (British Special Operations Executive) within the US ArmyIntelligence. He worked for OSS and ran the FBI's Counter Intelligence Div. 5,while working for British SOE and the Illuminati. George DeMohrenschildt,Oswald’s best friend or closest contact was himself an ex-Nazi spy who workedfor the CIA. The Mob’s'connections to the Top 13 Illuminati families isexplained in the Van Duyn family article in this newsletter. Bear in mind, themob had turned against JFK too.In summary, some of the McDonalds have held important positions for theIlluminati, and part of the McDonald descendants are in the Illuminati. You willalso find McDonalds very active in Protestantism and Catholicism. The McDonaldfamily’s involvement with the occult goes clear back to Druidism, and then theprotection & leadership they gave to the Knights Templars. Today, some of theMcDonalds are Barons, some are Bankers & some are leading intelligence andmilitary men. A news article that shows Linda McDonald was awarded hush money bythe Canadian govt. and the CIA for MK-Ultra Mind Control programming:Brainwash Victims to Receive $100,000Ottawa Denies Responsibility for ExperimentsBy Bob Cox The Canadian Press “OTTAWA — The federal government will pay $100,000 each to victims ofbrainwashing experiments funded by Canada and the CIA between 1950 and 1965,Justice Minister Kim Campbell announced Tuesday. Ottawa is paying the money toavoid legal claims by victims or the experiments carried out by Dr. Ewen Cameronat Montreal’s Allan Memorial Institute. As many as 80 people were Involved, butit’s not clear how many are still alive and eligible for the payments. Campbellsaid the government still does not admit any legal liability or responsibility,but is paying the money on compassionate and humanitarian grounds. But LindaMacdonald, a Vancouver woman who launched the court case that forced thesettlement, said she considers the payments an admission of responsibility and asymbolic apology.”My biggest concern has always been that the federal government acknowledges itsresponsibility in funding the experiments, so that we can hope that such abuseof patients’ rights will never happen again in this country,\" she said.Macdonald, now 55, underwent \"de-patterning\" at Allan Memorial in 1903.As amother of five children un-der four years old, she was sent to the Institutesuffering from fatigue and depression. She was treated as a schizophrenic,though never diagnosed as such. She was heavily drugged, kept asleep for 86days, given over 100 electroshock treatments and subjected to \"psychic \"drivingfrom which she emerged five later barely able to function She couldn't read orwrite, use a toilet, drive a car, cook a meal or make a bed. She didn’t rememberher husband, children or the first 26 years other life. \"I accept thegovernments symbolic apology through compensation, but no amount of money cancompensate me for the loss of memory . . and the enormous difficulties my familyand I have suffered,” Macdonald said in a statement. She was in Los Angeles onTuesday talking to film producers about her story. Former patients at the AllanMemorial have sought compensation from both the Canadian and U.S. government foryears. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, wanting to learn more aboutbrainwashing and psychological deprograming, covertly gave $85,000 to Cameronbetween 1957 and 1962. Canada, as part of a national program of health caregrants, gave about $70,000 between 1950 and 1954 and again between 1961 and1964. The experiments ended in 1965. Canadian officials later said they didn’tknow of the CIA funding. In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department reached anout-of-court settlement that gave about $100,000 to each of nine Canadianstreated under Cameron’s CIA-funded experiments. The Canadian government helpedpay legal bills for those Canadians who sued the United States, but balked atpaying its own compensation. A 1986 report by George Cooper, a Halifax lawyerand former Conservative MP, absolved Canadian authorities of any blame anddescribed Cameron’s work as \"incautious but not irresponsible.\" But ThomasBerger, Mac-Donald’s lawyer, presented a report to the government in 1990challenging Cooper’s conclusions One U.S. doctor likened Cameron’s research tobrainwashing techniques used In Chinese prisons. A Justice Department officialsaid he did not know how many people are eligible for the $100,000 payments. Anumber of former patients have already died. Only people still alive can applyfor compensation. People can call a toll-free number — 1-800-267 4988 — for moreinformation."},{"pageContent":" The Krupps BloodlineOne of the big lessons from history is that mankind doesn’t learn from history.The history of the Krupp family which is in the Illuminati would provide theworld with a loud and clear warning for today. The first lesson that could belearned is how a military buildup and military intentions can be totallyconcealed for decades. Today, the New World Order has brought in hundreds ofthousands of foreign troops into the United States, they have brought inthousands, if not hundreds of thousands of guillotines for executions, they havebuilt a network of unused concentration camps across the U.S., they have builtcrematoriums next to these concentration camps, and yet most Americans appear tobelieve the lies of President Clinton and others just like they believed thelies of Krupp, and the German Chancellors BEFORE Hitler, and the German militaryleaders who were all well aware of the secret German buildup that beganimmediately after W.W. I ended! We are about to go into a New World Order thatwill be worse than Hitler’s New World Order, but the power behind the scenes isthe same -- the Illuminati getting their power from their centuries-oldgenerational satanic practices. One ex-Illuminati thinks that the Krupp familybecame part of the Illuminati in 1836. The Halbach and Bohlen families hadunited in marriage prior to the Civil War. The Halbach family had large holdingsof coal around Scranton, PA. I believe the Halbach family was part of theIlluminati, and the Halbach family married into the Krupps in 1906. ft appearsthat 1836 date cannot be far off, because the record shows that the Krupp familybegan getting all kinds of favors from governments beginning late in the 1830s.Prior to this time period, too many things went the wrong way for the Kruppfamily for them to had any prominent role in the Illuminati leadership. In thesummer of 1838, Alfred Krupp, head of the Krupp Factories left his business andwent to Paris and then on to Liverpool. He quit travelling the Midlands ofEngland that winter and lived in Liverpool, England for 5 months with an Englishfamily named Lightbody. By the summer of 1839, he was back in Essen, Germany.After that trip to England, the Krupp fortunes began to turn. The Alchemistswere occultists who worked with chemicals and metals. The alchemists tie in withthe Rosicrucians and the early renaissance researchers into chemistry.The Krupps because they were involved in metallurgy also have been involved withchemicals. The first Krupp known about was Arndt Krupp who appeared out ofnowhere (it is speculated he came from Holland) and arrived at Essen in 1587 aman of means and became a merchant in the area. His son Anton became one of themilitary arms dealers of the times. Anton’s father-in-law ran a gunsmith tradewhere he made guns. By about 1650, the Krupps were Essen Germany’s “uncrownedkings\" (according to the German book Die KRUPPS written by Norbert Muehlen.Frankfurt am Main: 1960, p. 13). They controlled the city government. In 1800,the Krupps went into steel and coal, and producing cannon. During the age ofdiscovery when the New World was being explored the powerful occult oligarchiesof Europe set up trading companies to carve up control of the world. The EastIndia Company was one of the more notable of these elite controlled tradingcompanies. These trading companies tie in with the occult world’s leadership andthe formation of drug cartels during the age of discovery. The 13 Illuminatifamilies were participants in the narcotics cartel that was set up clear backbefore the United States became a nation. The roots of the cartels go back toKnights Templars, the Knights of Malta and some of the Italian oligarchies whohad been involved in narcotics trade for centuries. That drug cartel hascontinued down through the centuries. I.G. Farben has been a 20th century partof the German element of the cartel. Clear back during colonial days, each ofthe various secret ruling occult families from England, Germany, France and theNetherlands were given a piece of the narcotics/chemical trade. The full storyof the Krupp family would include how they tie in with I.G. Farben and theworldwide chemical monopoly that the Illuminati families have. It is clear thatGustav Krupp was informed of I.G. Farben’s secret research into syntheticnitrates prior to W.W.I, because Gustav told the great German chemist EmilFischer not to worry about the guncotton problem caused by low nitrate supplies.The Krupps faced a bigger problem during W.W.II in getting enough high gradeanimal fat for holding the cotton in place for explosives. This was solved byusing the fat of people killed in the concentration camps. Since theIlluminati’s Chemical cartel and I.G. Farben and Krupp were involved in the useof human products, the concentration camps were liberated by the Illuminati’smen and the use of human fat, etc. covered up.In our modern times two men of Illuminati from the Krupp family stand out,Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halsbach (1907-1967) and Charles \"Chip\" Bohlen(1904-1974). Chip Bohlen’s grandfather and Alfred Krupp’s great-grandfather werebrothers. Alfred Krupp was the most powerful and richest man in the commonmarket or Europe during the 1960s, and Chip Bohlen was one of the most powerfulpolitical figures of the United States serving as the U.S. ambassador to theUSSR for many years. New World Order leader and Chip’s co-worker George F.Kennen described Chip Bohlen with the following: \"No single person was presentat more of the high-level diplomatic encounters of the wartime [WW II] andimmediate postwar periods than Charles Bohlen.\" And yet how often are Americanstold that while Charles Bohlen was advising Roosevelt to give the Sovietseastern Europe at Yalta in 1943. His relatives Gustav and Alfred Krupp weredirecting the manufacture of Hitler’s best armaments? It’s a small world at thetop. On Jan. 21, ‘33, Papen told Hugenberg, “We’ve hired Hitler.\" AlthoughHitler was very much his own person, the people who put him into power knew whatthey were doing. The Illuminati, as they so often do, put their people in asHitler’s advisor and his bodyguard. Dietrich Stepp, Hitler’s personal bodyguard,was in the Illuminati. They have done the same with numerous other people, forinstance the surrounded Howard Hughes. Hitler was surrounded by Satanists whotook orders from the Illuminati first and Hitler second. If you don’t believethat Hitler submitted to his Illuminati advisors, look at sonic of the changesthat he made in Nazi doctrines over the years in his speeches to make sure thatthe elite of Germany were protected. Hitler backtracked on some of his stands.Four important Illuminati advisors to Hitler were Rudolf Hess, Martin L.Bormann, Gustav Krupp and Alfred Krupp. Rudolf Hess was hidden by the Illuminatiduring W.W. II. There is a book out which shows the military medical records ofthe real Rudolf Hess who was wounded in W.W. I, and the medical records of thefake \"Hess\" who was imprisoned in Spandau prison after W.W.II. This is why theNazi’s on trial at Nuremberg laughed when they saw \"Hess\" for the first time incustody, they laughed because they knew he wasn’t the real Hess. Bormann camefrom a generational occult family. Bormann’s grandfather was Johann FriedrichBormann (b. 1830) and his father was Theodor Bormann and his mother LouiseGrobler. Bormann before joining the Nazi’s had worked for Hermann von Treuenlelsas a foreman on a farm. He was noted for his harshness, brutality and dominatingpersonality. He also gave the orders for thugs to beat up a man named WalterKadow, who died while being beaten. Bormann served some prison time for hisinvolvement in Kadow’s death. Bormann later as Hitler’s no. 2 man used hisposition to enact some cruel measures on Europeans controlled by the Germans.All the leading Nazis agreed among themselves that Bormann was \"Hitler’sLucifer.\" Goring stated at Nuremberg, \"The decisive influence on the Fuebrerhimself during the war, and particularly from 1942 on...was exercised by HerrBormann. It was a disastrous influence.\"Bormann held the highest Nazi rank, Reichleiter, and was Hitler’s shadoweverywhere, and yet most Germans didn’t know who he was. When Hess disappearedearly in W.W.II, Bormann took his position. Gustav Krupp saved the Nazi party in1932. If it had not been for Gustav Krupp, Hitler would never have come topower. During 1932, the Nazi Party had offended many people and had lost greatlyin the elections. Many of their big financial supporters had backed away and itlooked like the party was going to shrivel up and die. Dr. Goebbels, of the NaziParty wrote at this point in 1932, \"...We are all very discouraged, particularlyin the face of the present danger that the entire party may collapse and all ourwork be in vain. We are now facing the decisive test.\" Soon after he wrote, \"Thefinancial situation in Berlin is hopeless. Nothing but debts and obligations.\"At this point, Gustav Krupp threw his momentous influence and big money(100,000,000 German Marks) into saving the Nazi party from their precariousposition. Gustav Krupp was perhaps the most powerful industrialist in Germanywith perhaps the best steel factories in the world, and the weight of his helppulled the Nazi party up on its feet and to victory that year. When Krupp madehis big financial contribution, Hitler assigned Bormann to keep track of all themoney. From then on, Hitler’s personal finances and some of the party’s financeswere totally controlled and oversaw by Martin Bormann, a member of theIlluminati. I say Gustav Krupp was \"perhaps the most powerfulindustrialist\"--only because I don’t know anyone who knows how big Gustav Kruppwas financially. Gustav Krupp was the sole owner That is the sole proprietor ofall his companies--there were no shareholders. Gustav Krupp owned a vast arrayof corporations and companies and properties all over the world. No one knowshow much he owned, but he owned enough that his son who was the sole inheritorof all the Krupp fortune was able to have his factories totally destroyed by theallies in W.W. II, and then quickly rebuild by using money derived from foreign(non-German) holdings all over the world.But was Hitler the person who led Germany to rearm and enter into W.W.II? GustavKrupp began secretly rearming Germany immediately after W.W.I, in preparationfor the next world war. The documentation that Krupp began planning and secretlyrebuilding German armaments in preparation for W.W. II IMMEDIATELY AFTER W.W. IIS INCONTROVERTIBLE. I suggest that doubters read William Manchester’s massivebook The Arms of KRUPP. 1587-1968. The German government cooperated. Agreementswere reached with the Soviets soon after W.W. I ended to help the Germanssecretly get around the strict requirements of the Versailles Treaty whichgreatly restricted Germany in many ways to prevent it from becoming a militarypower. On May 11, 1921, (German Chancellor Wirth, the leader of the Germangovernment signed the Versailles Treaty pledging disarmament. At the very sametime he was fully cooperating with the Krupps and the military to rearm Germanysecretly. Wirth was very adept at intrigue, and be and Krupp carried outinternational intrigue all over the world to pull off their secret militarybuildup. Today, the Illuminati are doing the very same thing. (More about thisshortly...) When Hitler came to power, Gustav Krupp billed the Nazi government300 Million for having secretly built up the German war machine during the1920s, and the Nazi’s paid it to Krupp. Later in 1943, during W.W. II whenGustav and Bertha wanted to hand their entire empire over to their first sonAlfred, Alfred personally went to Hitler’s secret underground hideout in EastPrussia to get Hitler to personally make an exception to the German law thatforbid passing everything in an inheritance to only one child. Hitler greetedAlfred with a great welcome and then let him talk to Martin Bormann. Remember,Bormann, a very brutal man, was part of the Illuminati. Alfred and Bormauntalked, and then Bormann directed Hans Lammers, the Nazi constitutional oracleto secretly proclaim:\"The firm of Fried. Krupp, a family enterprise for 132 years, deserves thehighest recognition for its incomparable performances in boosting the militarypower of Germany. Therefore, it is my wish that the enterprise be preserved as afamily property.\"At the Nuremberg trials, Gustav was one of the Nazis at the top of the list ofcriminals to be tried, and Alfred was mistakenly not put on it until later.Gustav was declared unfit health-wise for trial, and Alfred was given verylenient treatment. Other Nazis put on trial were sentenced to death with lessevidence and less crimes than Alfred. When the war ended, old man Gustav was atBluembach Castle which is located at a remote site in the Austrian Alps. TheAmerican officer who captured the castle was Chip Bohlen’s brother-in-law Col.Charles W. Thayer (in other words a relative to Gustav Krupp), who made sure theAmerican troops did not loot the castle. This is a very strange coincidence thatof the millions of allied troops, a relative of the Krupps is the one to captureGustav Krupp’s castle. Col. Thayer knew what Bluenbach Castle was all aboutbefore he took off with his men to find it. The four-storied ivy covered castlehas a pink granite driveway, and a beautiful and luxurious interior. Even if avisitor gets to the main gate which is remote enough, there is still a long tripto the castle. One of the snow-covered mountains surrounding the postcardperfect castle has the legendary cave of Barbarossa, who is said to be asleepwaiting to be woken by black ravens to come back to life and save Germany. TheIlluminati’s controlled media portrayed Gustav’s son Alfred as a victim of theNuremberg trials, even though mountains of documents prove that he was more of awar criminal than Adolf Hitler.The massive trial documents of the Nuremberg trial of Alfred Krupp were neverprinted in Germany, and even today the truth about Krupp is unknown. History wasrewritten by the controlled presses to make Alfred Krupp out to be the victim ofNazism, rather that to tell the truth about how he ran the Krupp empirebeginning in 1943, and was actively involved in the rape & pillage of manynations, and actively involved in the torture of countless slave laborers whocame from nations all over the world (anybody the Nazis found to arrest.) Theslaves who worked for Krupp were not even slaves. Hitler had made a law thatslaves were to be fed so much per day according to how hard the work was thatthey had to do. Krupp’s slaves were starved to death while being forced to dohard labor. There was an acute shortage of slaves to work and drastic needs fortanks, ships, artillery, subs and other Krupp produced weapons, so there was nological reason for Krupp’s personal factory guards to starve and beat slaves todeath on a regular manner. The horrendous abuse that the slaves receivedactually often prevented the Krupp factories from being successful in theirproduction goals. Slaves are generally fed and taken care of so they can work,but Krupp’s slaves were not even given the basics that a slave gets--they wereless than slaves, or as one slave who worked for Krupp said that as Krupp’sslaves they didn’t even have the status of \"slave\" but were like pieces ofsandpaper to be used and discarded. Krupp’s slaves were the worst treated inGermany and frequently failed to achieve the production that was wanted due tothe total dehumanization and horrible abuse systematically heaped upon them.Slaves were tortured in the basement of Krupp’s Hauptverwaltungsgebaude (theexecutive corporation office building in Essen). Unimpeachable witnessesdeclared that some of the most revolting torture of slaves occurred withinearshot of Alfred Krupps office. The secretaries who worked with Krupp couldhear the screams of people being tortured, and there is no doubt if they couldhear them, Alfred could too, but he always ignored the screams with a stone-likeface, as he did later in Satanic rituals. One Illuminati survivor remembersAlfred’s distinctive face. Later John J. McCloy, head of the Council of ForeignRelations, and a member of the Illuminati, was given the job of HighCommissioner over Occupied Germany. He overturned the Nuremberg Trial decisions,stepping out of line with legalities and freed Alfred Krupp from prison andexonerated him of \"war guilt\". The trial of Alfred Krupp’s W.W.II war crimes hadtaken 5 years, and took 330,000 pages of court transcripts. All that work wasswept aside by John J. McCloy--a generational satanist himself like Alfred.Alfred had 37 of the best lawyers who had given more than a good fight forAlfred. They pulled every trick in the book for their client--includingmurdering witnesses, suppressing evidence etc. (The establishment newspapers inEurope and the U.S. portrayed Alfred as having not been allowed adequate legalhelp! Nothing could be further from the truth--he was the best defendedNuremberg criminal.) Yet, the evidence against Krupp was overwhelming and the 5Nuremberg judges had sentenced him to prison. The judges also sentenced that allhis possessions be taken from him. This was more than fair considering all thepillage and looting Krupp had personally directed throughout Europe. The Britishand American governments never carried out the Judges orders to take Alfred’sproperty away, and after serving awhile (having a vacation from his work load)in prison, the Illuminati set him free from prison. Alfred was made out to bemartyr in the press--they claimed he was the only Nazi who had propertyconfiscated (which was a lie by the press), so that it looked like he’d beensingled out for special victimization by the Nuremberg court. While looking tothe public like a victim for losing his property--none of it was ever takenaway!Today, the intrigue of the Illuminati to secretly prepare for their takeover ismonumental in proportions. However, it is following many of the tried and testedtactics of the Krupps. Before W.W.I, the Krupps created a Dutch company in Haguewith the English name Blessing and Company. Blessing & Co. was used only everynow and then by the Krupps. After W.W.I, it was sold with all its assets to theHollandsche Industrie en Handel Maatschappij (another Dutch front), and then itsname was changed to Siderius A.G. It was then used as a holding company forthree Dutch shipyards, their names being Piet Smit in Rotterdam, Maschinen enApparaten Fabrik in Utrecht, and Ingenieur-Kantoor voor Scheepsbouw in theHague. At that time two Krupp directors quietly held all the shares in Siderius.In this way, a front company was created that no one even suspected of being aKrupp company. Later, select Dutchmen were sold the shares of the company thatthe Krupp directors had had. This completed the subterfuge. By the time alliedintelligence in 1926 caught on and asked the Dutch government to intervene,Queen Wilhelmina of Holland curtly informed allied intelligence that her govt.would in no way interfere with a private Dutch corporation. When one studies themachinations George Bush and Bill & Hillary Clinton, they too have worked withfront companies. The CIA is great at creating front companies which are sold toother fronts, and whose control eventually gets hidden and obscured. Threeexamples of Illuminati families with a great deal of power but who have theirextensive financial holdings obscured are the Payseurs, the Springs, and the VanDuyns. The national media of America have continually run expert damage controlfor George Bush and Bill & Hillary Clinton. The Whitewater scandal, VincentFoster and the Waco incident should have sunk the Clintons but the media has runexcellent propaganda campaigns that have stood the truth on its head. Under theappearance of doing unbiased investigations, the New World Order’s media hasreally done sophisticated damage control. If we look at the history of theKrupps, we can see that mankind hasn’t learned from history. The Kingpins of theIlluminati were above the law and still are. Friedrich Alfred Krupp (1854-1902)was the head of the Fried/Krupp Industrial Empire. He was a pedophile who likedlittle boys for sex. When he traveled to various large cities he would obtainboys. Conrad Uhl, proprietor of the Hotel Bristol in Berlin found out aboutFriedrich (Fritz) Krupp’s lust for boys when he was forced by Krupp to supplyhim with young boys at the Hotel. Conrad Uhl, didn’t like being forced into hisrole as pimp and went to the Berlin police who promptly told him to keep quiet.Krupp was above the law; no one would touch Krupp especially not even the Kingof Germany Wilhelm, who was best of friends with the Krupps. The policecommissioner Meerscheidt-Huellessem who ran damage control for the Krupps andothers died before political opponents of Krupp could get police records out tothe public.In Capri, Italy a grotto was transformed into Krupp’s private sex club where acountless numbers of young Italian boys regularly sexually serviced Krupp. Thiswas at the Quisisana Hotel. The owner was also a prominent politician who couldprotect Krupp’s activities. Solid gold pins shaped like artillery shells or twocrossed forks (both designed by Krupp) were given to the young boys if theyperformed well. Krupp would have skyrockets shot off when he had his orgasm, andporn photos taken of his activities. The porn pictures got out into the publicdomain and this and all the witnesses to Krupp’s criminal sexual activities,caused the Italian government to order Krupp to leave Italy. Any common personwould have been arrested and the key to their cell thrown away--but Krupp wassimply asked to leave. However, the press in Italy had gotten ahold of the juicystory for their Italian readers and soon all of Europe knew of Krupp’spedophilia except in Germany where the government and the controlled media keptit secret. A few German newsmen tried to get the story out in Germany but werearrested. When Krupp’s wife learned of the scandal she was upset and went toauthorities who then through the System using physical force threw Krupp’s wifein a mental hospital in Jena. However, throwing Krupp’s wife Margaretha into amental hospital wasn’t going to put a cap on the scandal, and suing the newsmenwasn’t going to work, and trying to run a cover-up as big and violent as the JFKassassination cover-up was started but it was obvious that it would have to besuch a large and violent cover-up that it would be difficult to pull off. In theview of all these difficulties, on November 21 or 22, 1902 Friedrich (Fritz)Krupp committed suicide. The suicide was covered up, and his body was put in aconcealed casket and in direct disobedience to the law there was noautopsy--even though the law required it. Nobody, even Friedrich Krupp’s closerelatives were allowed to see the body. After 3 days, Germany had a greatceremony involving the King, great words were said about Krupp, and then Kruppwas laid to rest in a guarded cemetery. Now that it is no longer important, thefacts of what happened can be studied, but the case of Friedrich A. Krupp’simproprieties and the resulting scandal show clearly that powerful men are abovethe law, any exposure of their activities can be covered up, and even suicidescan be covered up. Now historians will tell the truth, when it is no longerpolitically correct to lie. How long will it take for the truth to come outabout George Bush being a pedophile, or about Bill and Hillary’s cocainerunning, or a thousand and one other criminal activities these Illuminati menhave engaged in. The Supreme Council of the 330 of Southern Rite of Freemasonryhad pictures of George Bush in their New Age magazine holding children in hislap. For those of us who know that he is a pedophile the picture showing him asa fatherly Jesus-type figure who children love is sickening. Will we learn fromthe past, or will we continue to repeat it & its atrocities? Even today, inGermany the Krupp name is above reproach. The truth is not being told. TheKrupps have had too much power over the German media for the German mass mediato ever say the genuine negative truth about the Krupps.During W.W. II, the Krupps took tens of thousands of Jews and other people andused them as slave labor. A concentration camp at Buschmannhof, Germany wascreated for the babies of Krupp’s slave labor. The babies who were sent to thisconcentration camp would then die of starvation and disease. The slaves of theKrupps during W.W. II were tortured in small boxes, whipped etc. etc. However,the politically correct line today in Germany is that the Krupps were made to dothis by the Nazis. And that politically correct line is a fabricated lie,because numerous documents show that the Krupps went to the Nazi government andbegged for slaves to work in their factories, and that the Krupps intentionallyset .up extremely harsh working conditions for their slaves. In fact, lettersexist that show the Krupps couldn’t get enough supply of torture weapons to useon their slaves.But then the workers for Krupp have always worked under serf conditions. Avisitor to a Krupp factory said, \"For all practical purposes the people of Essenare body and soul the property of the Krupps.\" At times the Krupps have beenviewed as god figures by some of their workers. Are we going to learn fromhistory? Today, the public is buying the System’s propaganda to make inmateswork under boot camp conditions. The stage is being set in the United States toview inmates as less than human. The foreign slaves in Germany were often lookedupon as less than human by many of the German people. That is the power ofcontrol and propaganda. The media is able to take someone like Tim LaVeigh whoeveryone who knew him during his life says was a nice guy who couldn’t have setthe bomb(s) and make him look to the public like a mean monster. I believe TimLaVeigh is a patsy for the government’s own sinister bombing of the OklahomaCity Federal building just like Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag. Speaking offires set by the Illuminati, the Krupps tried to burn mountains of recordsbefore the Allies captured their factories. A lot were burned but many stillsensitive documents still survived. These sensitive documents showed their warcrimes, Krupp’s own espionage network and other sensitive things. Krupp wantedto bury some of the documents at an unused Bohien castle that he had. The Kruppshave networked with all the elite. The Krupps agent in powerful man while alive,he could hire or fire corporate leaders in many of Germany’s corporations,because his various banks held the purse strings in Germany. He also hadinternational clout, for instance, Banco Aleman Transatlantico (DeutscheOberseeishe Bank) which operates in South America & Spain is run by DeutscheBank. In July, 1944, the Illuminati’s economic thinkers quietly established theWorld Bank at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. Illuminatus John J. McCloy, the manwho set Krupp free, became the president of the World Bank. The U.S., Japan andGermany are the most powerful voting members of the World Bank according to therecent annual reports which I have.When an appropriate Krupp couldn’t be found in 1967 the Illuminati turnedKrupp’s Industrial Empire over to its international bankers. Charles EustisBohlen (1904-1974) was born to Celestine Eustis and Charles Bohlen. His fatherCharles Bohien was a wealthy man and his mother’s family had also beenprominent. His mother Celestine’s father was the American Ambassador to Francein 1893. Because Chip Bohien had connections, it was mutually decided by severalpeople that he should become a diplomat. The state department at the time hejoined had tarnished its reputation with the public with several scandals. Onediplomat had indecently exposed himself, another had been arrested for molestingtwo boys and another had shot himself. Chip Bohlen seems to have been way abovescandals. Chip was very intelligent and very discreet. In addition to being verydiscreet and close lipped, the elite’s press and the System in general over theyears have kept Chip Bohlen’s life a secret from the public. Most men of ChipBohien’s stature would appear in the Who’s Who in America. Not Chip Bohlen. Hehas managed to keep to a very low profile thanks to the Illuminati’s controlover all types of information, while remaining one of the most powerful men inthe 20th century. Sen. McCarthy, who was catching on to the Illuminati’sconspiracy tried to prevent Bohlen from being approved as the U.S.’s \"Ambassadorextraordinary and plenipotentiary to the U.S.S.R.\" but on Mar. 2, 1953, theSenate gave him the important position. However, Chip’s brother-in-law quit hispolitical career after being exposed by Sen. McCarthy. (I had believed the lieof the press that McCarthy was after communists, but I read something theSenator wrote which showed that he was out to expose a worldwide occultconspiracy--not simply communism. The work the Senator did is continuallyreferred to as a \"witch hunt\", but some day the witches he tried to protectAmerica from may well put this nation through another Holocaust, and then the\"witch hunt\" of the Senator will seem mild.) Chip Bohlen also served as the no.1 adviser for three Secretaries of State - James F. Byrnes, George C. Marshall(’45-’46) and Christian Herter (’59-’61). After graduating from Harvard in thelate 1920s, Chip worked for Frank B. Kellogg and Henry L. Stimson. The U.S.State Department trained Chip to speak Russian several years before the U.S. haddiplomatic ties with Russia. When the U.S. put in an embassy in Moscow in 1934,Chip helped open the first American embassy in communist Russia. The Americandiplomats stayed at the Savoy Hotel in Moscow. The Savoy Hotel in London hasbeen used as an important Illuminati building.Chip stayed in communist USSR until 1940, when the U.S. government moved him toTokyo to help in Japan. According to Chip, he and others were not surprised thatPearl Harbor took place because there were strong indications that it was goingto happen. (See Chip’s book Witness To History, pp. 110-112. His book was editedby a fellow Illuminatus Phelps.) After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Chip wasplaced under arrest by the Japanese. Then on June 20, 1942, Chip, Keith Meyershead of Standard Oil in Tokyo, and some other Americans were put on board theAsama Maru and returned to the United States via Portuguese East Africa. ChipBohlen interpreted for Averell Harriman, when Harriman met the Russians fortalks. Chip Bohlen did the interpreting and some advising of the President whenRoosevelt had his meetings with Stalin. Averell Harriman, a member of theIlluminati, liked Chip and the work he did. If one looks at photographs of theYalta and the Tehran meetings between Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt you willsee Chip Bohlen in the background. Chip was also at the Potsdam Conferencebetween Truman and Stalin. He was also in San Francisco as a participant whohelped create the United Nations in 1945. It was Bohlen and others who actuallywrote out the Marshall plan and then requested that Sec. of State GeorgeMarshall spell it out in a speech at Harvard. It would take a long article tocover all the big meetings that Bohien participated in. Needless to say, heattended more big meetings involving global politics than any other American.When Chip became the American Ambassador to the USSR, the Russians trusted Chipenough to stop their practice of having agents always follow the AmericanAmbassador. Chip’s predecessors as ambassadors had been George F. Kennen andLlewellyn E. Thompson. They had always been followed by Russian agents. Butthings changed for Chip. By the way, both Kennen and Dean Acheson both wereclose friends with Chip. Chip was noted for his intelligence and candor by hiscolleagues, but the Establishment has kept the full story about him very muchunder wraps. Perhaps only people like the CIA and intelligence personnel knowthe full story. For as powerful as Chip Bohlen was, he has been relegated tobeing in the shadows. When we look at the photos of the great summit meetings,Chip can be seen behind Stalin, Churchill and the American Presidents. FrancisHermana Bohlen (1808-t942) was a famous lawyer, politician and a teacher atHarvard from 1925-28. This is just one more of the famous Bohlen’s. This authorwaited until there was verification from independent ex-Illuminati sources thatAlfred Krupp (his full name includes the title \"von Bohlen und Halsbach\") hadbeen a member of the Illuminati. There is no doubt that Chip Bohlen was part ofthe Illuminati. As previously mentioned one of the Illuminati survivors I haveworked with was alive during W.W.II and has memories of how the Russians,Germans, and Americans in the Illuminati kept working together even during W.W.11. A very close examination of what really went on behind the scenes,especially at the top shows that the parts of the Illuminati have continued tocollaborate together even during wars. The are many relatives of Krupp inEurope, South America and the United States. Arndt Krupp, Alfred son who optedto become a professional playboy, bought an estate in the interior of Brazil.The estate covered 43 square miles, had dwellings for 180 servants (back in thel960’s-what’s happened in recent years I don’t know), had a park modeled afterVersailles, and the largest horse stables in Brazil. His private jet could carryhis custom-built Rolls-Royce.Important Illuminati rituals have taken place in Argentina and other SouthAmerican locations where Illuminati members from the U.S. and various Europeannations have flown in to participate in. As more information comes in, thisauthor will be able to determine whether Arndt Krupp took part in any of thoseSouth American Illuminati ceremonies. There are descendants of Hitler in severalstates in the U.S. (Because people move around, there is no purpose in givingtheir locations at present.) Of course the controlled media would have usbelieve that Adolf Hitler, who was very popular with women during his life, anda very powerful man at the height of his power, did not have any descendants.There were many German women who would have begged to have a child by him, andthere were a number who did. There is no doubt in this author’s mind that theKrupp’s got ahold of the Illuminati formula for creating multiple personalitieswho are programmed into Systems of Alters. The Krupp relatives have numerouscastles and other pieces of property all over Germany, and all over the world infact. I continue to get reports of Illuminati mind-control programming going onin castles, and Illuminati rituals taking place in German castles. It is adistinct possibility that castles tied to the Krupp clan are being used forprogramming. Some of their castles and estates have been remote and some havebeen left unused as far as the public was told.SummaryWhat we have learned is that the Krupps have participated in the Illuminati, andwere primarily responsible for both Hitler coming to power and for Germanyrearming itself secretly in violation of the Versailles’ Treaty. We have learnedthat Illuminati Kingpins like the Krupps are above the law, and are usuallyabove getting themselves sincerely exposed in the controlled media. The Kruppsprovide an excellent example of how a military build-up can be hidden, and howscandalous behavior of the elite can go unpublicized and unpunished. The samethings are still happening today. We have learned about two Krupps who wieldedenormous power during the twentieth century, Alfred Krupp and Chip Bohien.Alfred Krupp was the most powerful man in European economic affairs during hislifetime, and Chip Bohlen, who was perhaps the most influential Americandiplomat of the twentieth century. We have gotten a glimpse of how the remainingKrupps today are scattered and are to be expected to continue to play an activerole in the ritual life/& mind-control programming of the Illuminati.Later ArticlesThe German connection to the Illuminati is extensive; the Order of the Skull &Bones is an important element. Examples of German elite occultists who may beexposed in later articles include: * \"King\" Adolphus Busch, who acquired Ulysses Grant’s (ancestor of several in today’s Illuminati) St. Louis property and built a magnificant castle on it called Grant’s Farm. * Bleichroeder, who was an important Satanist and high ranking Mason & an important occult leader. Berlin was one of the important Masonic headquarters for years. * The Johnson-Wilson clans. One Satanic German bloodline which came from the location Tristie in Germany has been working with the Rockefeller & Johnson satanic families. They are active on the West Coast and have a house equipped with a torture dungeon in Tacoma. * The Johnson and Johnson clan have relatives in Satanism in Germany. * The Committee for the Care of European Children brought children from the concentration camps into the U.S. At least some of these children had already received Nazi trauma-based mind control, and were placed into occult families. The German connection to the Illuminati needs further coverage in this newsletter. Suggested Reading For More Information:Manchester, William. The Arms of KRUPP 1587-1968.
