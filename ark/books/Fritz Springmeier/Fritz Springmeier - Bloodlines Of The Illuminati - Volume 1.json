The iLLamanati Research Group has emerged tohelp genuine researchers in their efforts to unravel some of the greatermysteries of past and present workings of human societies.Additionally, the iLLamanati Research Group presents “critical editions” ofclassic works on related subjects. The presence of a critical edition is meantto mean that we provide additional resources not present in the original workthat provide additional aids to the genuine researcher. For example, in thiswork, we note sources that could not be verified or otherwise documented, aswell as the controversy behind certain sources. The other value of a criticaledition is that not all statements are taken for granted or as literal fact. Wealso intend to produce sourcebooks on various topics including the WhiteBrotherhood, Sun Discs, and Nazi UFOs which present multiple points of view onthese phenomena.For example, concerning “Illuminati” groups, we recognize that there aremultiple, intersecting points of view. One, that original group known as the“Illuminati” were setup to bring illumination, similar to the Masons. Second,that Illuminati groups are dedicated to some sort of Satanic worship. Third,that this worship involves some sort of ritual sacrifice. Fourth, that variousilluminati groups may have evolved from their original intention. Fifth, thatIlluminati groups do not exist at all or provide any meaningful influence insociety. At least according to ordinary logic, not all of these can be true atthe same time.With respect to the current work, Springmeier, also known as the “ConspiracyKing,” presents a seminal attempt to document various Illuminati bloodlines. Wehave not attempted to meticulously evaluate each one of his sources, but haveprovided helpful footnotes and aids not present in the original text. As for ourtextual source, it was validated as public domain and placed on the CIA websitewith the following note:“In an effort to further enhance public understanding of al-Qa'ida, the CentralIntelligence Agency (CIA) on 1 November 2017 released additional materialsrecovered in the 2 May 2011 raid on Usama Bin Ladin's compound in Abbottabad,Pakistan.“With the release of these materials, the information remaining in thecollection that has not been released publicly includes materials that areprotected by copyright; sensitive such that their release would directly damageefforts to keep the nation secure; pornography; malware; blank, corrupted, andduplicate files.

This is a book for lovers of the Truth. This is a book for those who arealready familiar with my past writings. An Illuminati Grand Master once saidthat the world is a stage and we are all actors. Of course this was not anoriginal thought, but it certainly is a way of describing the Illuminati view ofhow the world works.The people of the world are an audience to which the Illuminati entertain withpropaganda. Just one of the thousands of recent examples of this type of actingdone for the public was President Bill Clinton’s 1995 State of the Unionaddress. The speech was designed to push all of the warm fuzzy buttons of hislistening audience that he could. All the green lights for acceptance weresystematically pushed by the President’s speech with the help of a controlledcongressional audience. The truth on the other hand doesn’t always tickle theear and warm the ego of its listeners. The light of truth in this book will betoo bright for some people who will want to return to the safe comfort of theirdarkness.I am not a conspiracy theorist. I deal with real facts, not theory. Some of thepeople I write about, I have met. Some of the people I expose are alive and verydangerous. The darkness has never liked the light. Yet, many of the secrets ofthe Illuminati are locked up tightly simply because secrecy is a way of life. Itis such a way of life, that they resent the Carroll Quigleys and the James H.Billingtons who want to tell real historical facts rather than doctored upstories and myths. I have been an intense student of history since I could read,and I am deeply committed to the facts of history rather than the cover storiesthe public is fed to manipulate them.I do not fear the Illuminati taking over this country and doing away with theConstitution, because they took over this country long ago, and the Constitutionhas not technically been in effect due to Presidential emergency decrees sinceW.W. II. Being a follower of Christ does not mean we should fear. Perfect lovefor Almighty God casts out our fear for the situation He has placed us in. Don’tthink for a moment you are going to vote the Illuminati out of office. Theycontrol the major and minor political parties. They control the process ofgovernment, they control the process of information flow, they control theprocess of creating money and finally they control Christendom. (However, Godcontrols the hearts of His people.)I have provided information on how to respond in some of my other writings. Thisbook will not tell you how to deal with the Illuminati families. This volume issimply the first of two volumes which is published to give an overview of whatthe Illuminati are. In short the Illuminati are generational, Satanic bloodlineswhich have gained the most power. A generational Satanist described theIlluminati as \"Satan’s elite.\"This book is not written to cause fear. It is not written to provide names for awitch hunt. It is not written to provide another theory. This book is not abouta theory. It is about the secret occult oligarchies which rule the world. Whenbrought together, the facts of this book will begin to speak for themselveswithout me. I don’t ask that you take my word. Investigate for yourself. GodHimself has told us that the whole world lies in the power of the wicked one.Some people after they have read my material have gone out into their owngeographic area and seen for themselves that a small group of people controltheir nation and the world from behind the scenes. They have seen for themselvesthe power that secret societies exercise from behind the scenes.This book will not be error free. There will be typos, and misspelled names, anderrors of various kinds. The author is not God Almighty. I do not have everyhair on these people’s heads counted. This book has not been put out with theluxury of ghost writers, editors, a paid staff of researchers and a largebudget.[4] [part0000_split_019.html#_ftn4] I look at many trivial projects whichthe elite are able to pour millions of dollars into, and I look at the researchI do when at times I’ve not had a dime to photocopy some document I want. Thereis so much for me to communicate about the Illuminati, who they are, what theirrituals are like, and how they control the world that it has taken several yearsof writing to begin to give people a fully cohesive picture.Finally, after a number of requests that I assemble my writings exposing the top13 Illuminati bloodlines, I have taken the time to put it all together in a bookwith a comprehensive index. History is important. In order to know where we aregoing, we need to know where we have been. To control the past is to control thepresent. The Illuminati’s control over the entire learning process from cradleto grave gives them great ability to shape our frames of references. Jesus spokeabout historical things. Paul reminded people of historical things. Josephuswrote a history of the nation of Israel.Long ago in the dark unwritten pages of human history, powerful kings discoveredhow they could control other men by torture, magical practices, wars, politics,religion and interest taking. These elite families designed strategies andtactics to perpetuate their occult practices. Layers upon layers of secrecy havehidden these families from the profane masses, but many an author has touchedupon their existence. I began my research when I began to get first hand reportsfrom very informed people that an elite group did rule the world. My researchinto Satan’s hierarchy went fast because of my skills as a researcher andbecause I knew from the beginning from my informants about the reality of what Iwas investigating. My investigation into the Illuminati, led me to read and prayabout thousands of books. The quantity of books, newspapers, magazines andmanuscripts and papers which were read to get me to where I am today numbers inthe many thousands. I do not know how many nights I stayed up studying andfinally collapsed into sleep with blurred red eyes.I do know that I was driven enough in my study that I often would not stop untilmy eyes and mind could go no further. Men and women with sharp intellects likeEdith Star Miller (author of Occult Theocracy) and Alexander Hislop (author ofThe Two Babylons) have tried to research the occult world and the connectionsbetween the different groups. I first read Hislop’s book in 1981. His book showsthat there is a continuity between the ancient occultism of the MysteryReligions and modern day religion. Edith Star Miller’s Occult Theocracy was veryhelpful for me to rapidly see some of the many hidden historical and operationalconnections between occult groups today. Finally, the book Holy Blood, HolyGrail and its first sequel The Messianic Legacy gave me a deep insightful lookinto the 13th bloodline. But my understanding has been lifted by countless otherinvestigators, who are worthy of praise because they dared to challenge thepower structure to get to the real facts.In mockery and imitation of God’s 12 tribes, Satan blessed 12 bloodlines. One ofthese bloodlines was the Ishmaeli bloodline from which a special elite linedeveloped alchemy, assassination techniques, and other occult practices. Onebloodline was Egyptian/Celtic/Druidic from which Druidism was developed. Onebloodline was in the orient and developed oriental magic. One lineage was fromCanaan and the Canaanites. It had the name Astarte, then Astorga, then Ashdor,and then Astor. The tribe of Dan was used as a Judas Iscariot type seed. Theroyalty of the tribe of Dan have descended down through history as a powerful,Satanic bloodline. The 13th or final blood line was copied after God’s royallineage of Jesus. This was the Satanic House of David with their blood whichthey believe is not only from the House of David but also from the lineage ofJesus, who they claim had a wife and children. The 13th Satanic bloodline wasinstilled with the direct seed of Satan so that they would not only carryChrist’s blood--but also the blood of his \"brother\" Lucifer.One of the bloodlines goes back to Babylon and is descended from Nimrod. Downthrough the years the occult world has remained hidden from the history books.(Publishing and education have been controlled privileges.) They have ruledbehind the scenes. The Mystery Religions each had their secret councils whichruled them, and these councils themselves came under the guidance of a secretsupreme Grand Council or Governing Body. The Mystery Religions in turn ruled themasses and the political leaders. When I first began investigating theIlluminati a clear picture developed that the history books were doctored, andthat great power was concentrated in the hands of oligarchies around the world.But who were these powerful people? I have been repeatedly asked, \"If there is aconspiracy who are the conspirators?\" That is what this book is about. Thehistory books are full of information about the elites and the masses.Interestingly, upon very close scrutiny and examination the investigator findsthat the elite have perpetuated their power for centuries, and have worked handin glove with other elites to control the masses.When seen in better light, wars between kings no longer appear as wars betweenelite factions, but contrived wars to control the masses by their greedy elitemasters. But who are these people? The answer may not be the answer some mightexpect, because power comes in many shapes and sizes. Power doesn’t have to havehigh visibility to be active. In fact, due to the evil dark nature of these evilbloodlines they have traditionally tried to remain secret. I am indebted topeople who have stepped out of the generational, Satanic bloodlines of theIlluminati and who have given their lives to Christ for many of the tips whichgot my investigations on the right track. This book tells what many witnesses ofgenerational Satanism would like to tell, but are too intimidated to tell.Witnesses like Tom Collins, and John Todd, and David Hill have tried to testifywhat they themselves saw--they each were destroyed. But the truth will not diewith Tom Collins or David Hill. The truth did not go out of fashion just becauseJohn Todd was framed and dishonored by the Illuminati’s henchmen. Several peoplefrom different places have confirmed that there are 13 Illuminati bloodlines.Further, several ex-Illuminati people have confirmed my list of 13 families.It is possible that my list is off on a name or two, but if it might be off, itcannot be off much, if any. I believe the facts speak for themselves. As youstudy these bloodlines you will also see how powerful they are. David Hill, whowas investigating the Illuminati, lost his life because he had been close to theinside as a high ranking Freemason who worked for the Mafia.I received David Hill’s research manuscript two years after I had begunreporting on the 13 families. David Hill had done what I had originally done. Hehad asked questions and began to dig into who pulled the strings in thiscountry. Both David and I discovered the names of some of the more obviouspowerful families. For instance, in David’s notes he writes, \"Yes, it is a fact:the Mellons, Carnegies, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Dukes, Astors, Dorrances,Reynoldses, Stilimans, Bakers, Pynes, Cuilmans, Watsons, Tukes, Kleinworts,DuPonts, Warburgs, Phippses, Graces, Guggenheims, Milners, Drexels, Winthrops,Vanderbilts, Whitneys, Harknesses and other super rich Illuminated familiesgenerally get along quite well with Communists, who supposedly want to take awaythe wealth of these men and give it to the people.However, this is only double talk designed to bolster the superstructure ofdelusion that Communists are the enemies of all Capitalists. But Communists,like the super-rich families, are not the enemies of MONOPOLY CAPITALISM: theyare the foes of FREE ENTERPRISE.\" (Untitled manuscript of David Hill, p. 215.)My research had already entered another dimension beyond David Hill’s, becausepeople trying to escape being part of the Illuminati had given me the 13 familynames. But each round of validation I have received is a pleasant encouragementthat others have seen the same things. It was a pleasant surprise to see thatthis researcher had singled out some of the same families as I had. Some of theallied families if not all of them probably have intermarried somewhere with oneof these bloodlines.Because this book is a collection of things which I have written over the yearsallow me to review what was written. In 1991, I first self-published my Be WiseAs Serpents manuscript which exposed the top 13 families. In 1992, I began mynewsletter to continue exposing the Illuminati, and came out with somemonographs exposing the Monarch Mind Control program and the IlluminatiPlans/methods to create earthquakes. From the mid-Dec. ‘92 newsletter up to themost recent ones in1995, I have ran feature articles exposing the different top13 families. This book is a collection of things, I, Fritz Springmeier, wrotebetween 1991 and 1995 about the top 13 families.Why Am I Covering the Top 13 Illuminati Bloodlines? I have often been asked who are the Illuminati? Who are the people at the top ofthe conspiracy? Who are the generational satanic families? The Illuminaticonsists of 13 magical and powerful bloodlines. There are also some otherpowerful bloodlines that are worth naming but if they are in the Illuminati theyhave blood ties to one of the 13 powerful lineages. About half of the Illuminatipeople I know have had their parentage hidden from them. Many of those who stillknow who their real parents are, still do not know what bloodline they belong tountil the Illuminati chooses to reveal it to them. Most of the Illuminati haveMPD. When high level Satanists do not have MPD they very often emotionally breakunder the stress of the horrible blood rituals that are required. Recently, anon-MPD Satanist in Chicago emotionally broke and gave his life to Christ. (Ihave videos available of an interview of this man exposing Satanism.) One of theimportant lineages has remained secret until 3 investigators named Lincoln,Leigh, and Bageant were spoon-fed leads and secrets. They put this into a bookcalled Holy Blood, Holy Grail. I recommend the book and the two books which areits sequels, because they show how just one part of the 13 lineages has keptitself secret and has taken immense power of all forms to themselves. InSouthern Belgium there is a castle. (If anyone is traveling there and wants tofind the castle, I will show them on the map, and describe it.) This is theMothers of Darkness castle. In that castle, is a cathedral and in thatcathedral’s basement a little baby is sacrificed daily and Is coming to power.The pages are written almost round the clock. (This castle is also described inmy Be Wise As Serpents book.) The history in that handwritten book would revealthe real facts behind the propaganda that the world’s major news media give thegullible public. The history as that book reveals it would tell people about howAbraham Lincoln was a descendent of the Rothschilds. Abraham Lincoln was thesecret head of the Rosicrucians, a member of their 3 headed top council. (I haveseen the paper trail proof to these things about Lincoln to my satisfaction thatthese things about Lincoln are true.) Adolf Hitler was also a secret member ofthe Rothschild lineage. Hitler carried out blood sacrifices to open his mind upto high level demonic spiritual control. Rockefeller sold Hitler oil during W.W.II via Spain to keep W.W. II going longer. The history in that book mentionspeople that the “history books” given the public don’t-- like Michael AugustusMartinelli Von Braun Rheinhold, the most powerful Satanist in the world a fewyears ago. Michael Augustus Martinelli Von Braun Rheinhold had 66 SatanicBrides. And that Satanic book in the Mothers of Darkness castle also mentionsthe Rockefeller bloodline. Only insiders are supposed to know the real historyof what has taken place in human history. The real decisions and the real moversand shakers have been hidden from the public’s eyes. What the public is given isa stage show where illuminati puppets parade around and make big speechesaccording to their script. Each of the 13 families has their own set of Mothersof Darkness. Each of the 13 families has their own secret Satanic LeadershipKings, Queens, Princesses and Princes of Darkness. For instance, the Rockefellerfamily has people who are selected as Kings and Princes within their ownbloodline in secret rituals. The Kings and Princes, Queens and Princesses arestrictly bloodline. They secretly rule over an area of the world for their ownbloodline. This is independent of the Illuminati’s hierarchy which wasdiagrammed in the Jan 1993 newsletter. (my Newsletter from a ChristianMinistry.) In the January, 1993 issue the Covens, Sisters of Light, Mothers ofDarkness, and the Grande Mothers were diagrammed. The Illuminati pulls itsvarious bloodlines together under several councils. The Grande Druid Council oryour Council of 13 is your principle council for the Brotherhood of Death. Abovethe Council of 13 is a higher Council of 9, and an inner group of 3 is believedto head that Council of Nine. How do we know about these things? The power ofGod has reached into the very heart of Satan’s empire and pulled out some of themost powerful Satanists and drawn them to Christ. There are several Sataniststhat were at the top which have managed to find Christ. In addition, some of thenext echelon of the hierarchy, such as some of the Mothers of Darkness is alsofinding Christ. If someone wants to understand how and why decisions are made inworld affairs and by whom-- then you need to study the Illuminati. The realanswers do not rest with the proceedings of the Congress of the United States orwith the publicly known leaders of the Communist countries. An example of what Iam talking, there is a book entitled Who Financed Hitler by James Pool andSuzanne Pool. I am always glad to see that some people are willing to lookbehind the scenes. Believe me, there were people that Hitler listened to. Theywere the people he went to ritual with, and who put him into power.Other Writing Besides feature articles about the top 13 families, I have also written articlesabout the Illuminati in general. When I went to assemble what I had written onthe 13 families, I realized that much of what I’d said was in the content ofarticles about the Illuminati in general. I made the decision to use theapproximately 250 pages I’d written specifically about the 13 families as Book#1[5] [part0000_split_019.html#_ftn5], and what I had written in general aboutthe families, which was also 200 plus pages as Book #2. Volume two[6][part0000_split_019.html#_ftn6] will explain how the Illuminati control theworld, and what some of their beliefs are, and about their secret andsemi-secret organizations.The two books will provide perhaps the most in-depth, complete picture of the 13top Illuminati families that has been done to date. In fact, I know of no otherbook which is devoted to exposing the top 13 Illuminati families. In Volume two,you will read about Illuminati life, Illuminati control, and Illuminatiorganizations including the ACL, the Bohemian Grove, the Cosmos Club, the CFR,the Club of Rome, the Council of 9, the Council of 13 which is the Grand DruidCouncil, the Jason Society, the Jason Group, the Ordo Saturis, the OTO groups,MI-6, MJ-12, the Mothers of Darkness, the Pilgrim Society, the Prieure de Sion,the Process Church, the Sanhedrin, the Temple of Power, and other groups. Thesetwo books will give the details behind what was written, \"The whole world liethin wickedness\" and that the god of this world is in its full reality Satan. Grace and peace be with you,Fritz Springmeier, Feb. 10, 1995"},{"pageContent":" Illuminati FamiliesFamilies in the world who are allied with the Illuminati.Who and what kind of family are allied with the top 13 Illuminati bloodlines?The Illuminati seeks to capture the occult power of powerful occult bloodlinesaround the world. They have intermarried with American Indians to gain thespiritual power resident within the leading spiritual American Indians. VariousIndian reservations are used for Illuminati rituals. They have been doing thistype of thing for thousands of yearsPowerful families around the world participate on different levels with theIlluminati. Some participate on a business level- such as the various crime(Mafia type) families around the world. Mafia families might not subscribe tothe occult philosophy but they do recognize power and business. Some powerfulfamilies around the world participate simply on the level that they have beensucked into the world’s system and are dependent upon going along with the flowof the world’s system. An example of this would be the King of Nepal. The Kingof Nepal rules aver a poor Hindu kingdom. The British Empire has done a greatjob in trying to make Nepal dependent upon them. Nepal was given Britishprotection, their leading families were given British educations, and theirleading tribe of warriors, the Gurkhas have been serving as British mercenaries.Should the King of Nepal break loose from his advisers and take an anti-NWOtrack, his throne could be taken away via revolution, or invasion. The NWO hasthe capacity to arrange for the Indian Congress Party to invade or some otherdestabilizing factor. The British MI-6 and the American CIA have also stationedassets (agents) in the country. However, the trump card in sucking nations likeNepal in is to create conflict like the Cold War and then apply Hegeliandialectics. Many nations around the world have been forced to cozy up with theBritish and Americans, because of the cold war. Secretly manufactured andsecretly controlled international conflicts are a great way to take away theindependence of some of the smaller nations. The King of Nepal has for manyyears feared invasions from either India or China.However, Switzerland has been afforded the luxury of not having to take sides inthe Illuminati’s secretly created wars, because the bloodlines have had suchtotal control over Switzerland for so many centuries. There is no need forSwitzerland to participate in Hegelian dialectics.If families are powerful but not in the Illuminati’s clique, they can bedestroyed such as Howard Hugh was. An example of this is how the Rothschildsprogressively destroyed the Romanovs (the Russian Imperial Family). But theRomanovs were also an occult bloodline, and so the Illuminati secretly tookchildren of the Imperial family to serve as breeders for the Illuminati so thatthe Illuminati could channel in the Romanov’s occult blood into theirbloodlines.The families that control Switzerland go back to Venice. Some of the Phnariotfamilies of the Byzantine have had enduring powerful lineages. The Venetian andGenoese banker/international commerce families have produced some enduringpowerful lineages. Families from these groups have tended toward Satanism(Gnosticism) or cults that are not Christian. In this category, we can mentionDarius Socinus of Venice. Note also that the Warburgs, who work so closely withthe Rothschilds, are descendants of Abraham del Banco, an old banker in Venice.The Warburgs in turn are related to the Rosenbergs of Kiev, Russia. Some of yourold, aristocratic, Russian, occult bloodlines were the first to financially helpHitler’s fledgling Nazi Party.The powerful bloodlines diversify into different last names, but some of themstill have enough visibility that they can be halfway tracked by their modernnames. For instance, the Cabot Family of Boston are descendants of SebastianCabot who was born in Venice. Sebastian Cabot (who father was John Cabot) was inturn descended from Giovanni Caboto of Genoa. Giovannia Caboto was a member of apowerful family in Genoa. In modern times, the Cabot family has been active inpolitics and intelligence agencies for the NWO. For instance, Thomas D. Cabotset up Radio Swan on Swan Island for the CIA. Paul Cabot was a director of J.P.Morgan & Co., beside director of other corporations that interlock with theIlluminati’s power.Your ruling families in Western Europe tie back to William of Orange. There is apowerful Arabic connection to the Illuminati. Men like Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah arevery knowledgeable about Arab magic and occult practices. Sirdar Ikball Ali Shahhas written at least 70 books on magic and occultism. These families keep trackof their genealogies, and certain members of these occult families know thehistories of these families.I believe that a history of the top thirteen Illuminati families is the key tounderstanding history. Many of the families which appear to be “allied\" with thetop families are actually related at some point back in time. Further, many ofthe allied families are top level flunkies for the families with the real power.Some people have tried to put the Rothschilds in this category, but suchthinking is nonsense. Not only do I have too many eyewitnesses who have comefrom the inside of the Illuminati who say the Rothschilds are one of the top,but one can also point to how much control and wealth the Rothschilds exercise.The process of history has been to increase their control and wealth. Theoverall picture can’t be denied. The Rothschilds are not flunkies for some othermore powerful family.I believe that an investigator will do himself a favor in tracking down the tiesa family has with the top bloodlines and how that family interacts with the topfamilies. This is the principle behind why history books discuss royalty somuch. All that I encourage is that people investigate Satan’s royalty in orderto understand how Satan’s realm- the power behind the scenes operates.In the Be Wise As Serpents book, I gave a good example of how Satan’s realmworks behind the scenes. The Illuminati control the Watchtower Society. Thenominal head of the WT Society for many years was their President Fred Franz.Yet, Fred Franz had grown very old, was blind and stayed in his bed. NatheerSalih was supposedly Fred Franz’s bodyguard and helper, but all communicationsto WT President Fred Franz had to go through 6’2\" Natheer Salih, who wouldsupposedly ask Franz and then would come back with an answer. Apparently Salihmay be from an Iraqi Jewish bloodline. He wears big rings and has expensivetastes. Salih was the channel through whom the Illuminati could pass theirdecisions for the WT onto the Governing Body and Bethel staff."},{"pageContent":" The Astor BloodlineThe original founder of the Astor fortune was John Jacob Astor (1763-1884). JohnJacob Astor was born in Walldorf, Duchy of Baden (Germany) from a Jewishbloodline. The Jewish origins have been hidden, and quite a number of variousideas of the Astor’s heritage have been put into circulation by the Astors. JohnJacob Astor was a butcher in Walldorf. In 1784, he came to America after astopover in London, England. Although the story is that he came to Americapenniless--and that may be true--he soon joined the Masonic Lodge, and within2-3 years had become the Master of the Holland Lodge No. 8 in N.Y. City. (ThisHolland Lodge is a prominent lodge in that many of its members have goodconnections to the Illuminati elite. An example of just one Lodge #8 member isArchibald Russell, 1811 - 1871, whose father was President of a real hotbed ofIlluminati action for many years: The Royal Society of Edinburgh).By 1788, Astor was a master of masonic lodge#8. This is rather interestingconsidering Astor could not speak English when he arrived in America, andsupposedly was very poor. John Jacob Astor was always very famous for beingcoldhearted, anti-social, “a man who didn’t have charm, wit or grace.” (Thisquote comes even from a relative of the DuPont family who wrote a sympatheticBiography entitled The Astor Family.) If this man lacked social graces and wasso cold, and was so poor during his first years in the U.S., why did he rise tosuch prominence in Freemasonry? Certainly not because of his social graces. Forinstance, one time later in life at a meal given for elites, when his hands gotdirty at the table he reached over and used the shirt of the man beside him towipe his hands. The original financial break came by carrying out a series ofshady and crooked real estate deals in the N.Y. city area.The next break came when two men who are now known to have been in theIlluminati gave John Jacob Astor a special government privilege. The two menwere Pres. Jefferson and Secretary Gallatin--both Illuminati members. The UnitedStates government had placed an embargo on all U.S. ships from sailing withgoods in 1807. But Astor got special permission from these two men for his shipto sail with its cargo. His ship sailed and made close to a $200,000 profit inthat day’s money. Astor strangely profited greatly from the War of 1812, whichcrippled almost all the other American shippers. Astor also worked together withGeorge Clinton, another member of the Illuminati, on land deals. Even at thatperiod in history, British intelligence worked for the Committee of 300 and forthe Thirteen Top Families, it is interesting then, that John Coleman who hadaccess as an intelligence agent to secret documents, discovered that theoriginal John Jacob Astor was also a British secret agent. The Thirteen Familieshave very intimate roles with the American and British intelligence cults.Prior to 1817, John Jacob Astor entered into the fur trade and remained thebiggest player in the fur trade until he got out of it in 1834. Over the years,he had managed to build up a monopoly. How he managed to push everyone else outis a good question.Bear in mind, white people had been trapping furs in the New World for severalcenturies, and the Indians for who knows how long. Then this guy Astor comesalong and in a few years totally owns the whole industry! Again this could onlyhave happened, because the occult power of this Astor family gave them theright. Obviously, others in the Committee of 300 had to step aside, if hisposition in the hierarchy had not given Astor the right, believe me the otherfamilies that originally controlled the fur trade would have gotten rid ofAstor. One result of his fur company was that Astoria, OR was created. Today,perhaps in honor of the family that originally took interest in it, Astoria is areal hot-bed for the secret Satanic covens in Oregon. John Jacob Astor did havea few helpful connections. Three of his relatives were captains on clipperships. He had connections in London to the Backhouse family. He married a Todd,a family frequently associated with Satanism. His wife, a Todd, was alsoconnected to the influential Brevoort family. And finally for some reason, JohnJacob Astor was also on good relations with the politicians of the day, perhapsbecause most of them were Freemasons too.For a few years John Jacob Astor had participated in the opium trade, but in1818-he publicly quit running opium to China. John Coleman in his good book TheConspirator’s Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300, p. 131 notes, “JohnJacob Astor made a huge fortune out of the China opium trade .... It was theCommittee of 300 who chose who would be allowed to participate in the fabulouslylucrative China opium trade, through its monopolistic BEIC, and thebeneficiaries of their largess remained forever wedded to the Committee of 300.”Interestingly another Top 13 family, the Russells, was also one of the luckyones to get a slice of the China opium trade. It is clear repeatedly fromhistory that Astor was privy to inside information in the government, andmaintained his own courier system. John Jacob Astor bought up large amounts ofland in NY which land greatly increased in value. The Financial Panic of 1837allowed him to foreclose on a large number of mortgages. John Jacob Astor’swealth continued to skyrocket. As one biography said, “When it came to aquestion of principle versus profit, Astor was a practical man.” Put simply, hehad no scruples. Astor had a reputation for being a ruthless landlord. He alsohad the reputation of not paying his legitimate debts. Astor became a banker,and sat on the board of 5 directors of the new national bank that Hamiltoncreated for the U.S. government called the Bank of the United States. Astorowned a large block of the stock of the Bank of the United States. Astor alsowas fairly active during his life as a Freemason, holding several more keypositions in the secret lodge life. John Jacob was the richest man in the UnitedStates. Note this reference. Meyers, Gustavus. History of the Great AmericanFortunes. London: Stationers Hall, 1909, p. 147 said, “Statistics issued in 1844of manufacturers in the United States showed a total gross amount of$307,196,844 invested. Astor’s wealth, then, was one-fifteenth of the wholeamount invested throughout the territory of the United States...” Is having1/15th of all of what American money is invested not rich? John Jacob Astor’sdescendants had a penchant for secrecy, and set up things to rule from behindthe scenes. In contrast, to some of the other top families, the Astors preferrednot to sit on boards of corporations they controlled. In 1890, a real estateexpert calculated the Astors owned 1/20 of New York City real estate. Aftermaking their fortune while residing in the New York area, the Astors by andlarge have all gone to England. They still wield great financial power in theUnited States through proxies. Forum Magazine, Nov. 1889, commented thatauthorities estimated the Astors were worth $300,000, but that that figure hadto be an underestimate. Today, my estimate of the Astors is that they are worthabout 40 billion dollars. One of the many foundations that the Astors createdwas the Vincent Astor Foundation, which is controlled from England by the Astorsand has in the range of $100 million tax exempt dollars. The Vincent AstorFoundation has typically given to Catholic and Episcopalian needs, among otherthings. They also give money to agencies opposed to private ownership of guns.They give money to NY’s public library. Imagine how much influence that givesthem, when the library is receiving regular help for general support? A 1971Foundation Directory stated that the V. Astor foundation had its presentemphasis on preventing juvenile delinquency. Why don’t I trust the Astor’s inhelping out with law enforcement? The William Waldorf Foundation states that itspurpose is ‘Promotion of mutual understanding and the diffusion of knowledge andculture among the United States and the dominions, colonies, and countries ofthe British Commonwealth.’ This sounds very similar to the public statement ofpurpose that the secretive Pilgrim Soc. has given out to those who needsomething about them. Assets for this foundation are a mere $64,000. VincentAstor (now deceased) was a member of 41 private clubs, To give an idea of howmuch power just one of the many Astor men wield some of the businesses Vincentwas involved include: * Director- American Express Company Director Atlantic Fruit and Sugar Co. * Director Chase Manhattan Bank (of the Rockefellers) * Director City and Suburban Homes Co. * Director Classical Cinematograph Corporation * Director Cuban-Dominican Sugar Co. Director Great Northern Railroad, Director Ill. Central Railroad * Director, Inter. Mercantile Marine Co. Director National Park Bank of NY * Director NY County Trust Co. * Director Weekly Publications Inc. * Director Western Union Telegraph trustee NY * Zoological Society Advisor to Bankers Trust of NY, Member American Museum of Natural History, member Natural Institute of Social Sciences (notice these last two like so many elite controlled organizations are heavily involved in the spread of the evolution theory.)Just like the Rothschilds, DuPonts, and Rockefellers, the Astors always set oneof their Astor males as the head of the entire family. This headship is passeddown as a birthright within the different branches of the family, just as anyKing passes on his throne. On the corner of 33rd St. and 5th Ave. (the sitelater began the site of the Empire State Building) the original Waldorf-AstoriaHotel was built by William Waldorf, et. al. The hotel opened in Mar. 1893. It isdescribed as ‘the ultimate in snob appeal.’ Later two Astor cousins built theAstoria (another even taller elite Hotel) in New York which opened in 1897. Ofcourse, like many of the other elite families, the Astors have their Maineproperty to get away and relax. In 1894, John Jacob wrote a novel A Journey inOther Worlds where he describes a society which operates on the idea ofconserving energy. Strange how the elite likes to promote conservation among us“cattle.” In the late 1800’s, the Illuminati began to reconfigure its outwardface. The higher levels started creating innocent sounding cover organizationsto hide their meetings behind. In 1901, the Astors contributed toward thecreation of the Pilgrim Society, which was the cover organization for American &British 6° Princes of the Illuminati. I believe at least five Astors are nowmembers of the Pilgrim Society. The Pilgrims had recently included David Astor,John Jacob Astor 8th, and William Waldorf Astor 3rd. And during the 1970s, BaronAstor of Hever was the President of the London branch of the Pilgrims. Thisimplies that Astor of Hever was at least the next level up in the chain ofcommand.The Astors also have been very prominent in the Group’ which is Britian’sequivalent to the Skull & BonesSoc. In Britain, the Astor, along with about 20other families dominate the Group, just as certain families like the Whitneys inthe U.S. help dominate the Order of Skull & Bones. Again, as was earlier pointedout, the key to understanding Satanism is the bloodlines. In 1910, the muscleand bone branches of the Illuminati reconfigured themselves with the creation ofthe Round Table groups in 1910. The Astors were the part of the financialbackers behind the Round Table groups along with Abe Bailey. Rhodes and Milnerwere key players is setting up The Society of the Elect, a super secret topcircle of Illuminati. Rhodes Trust in part helped by the Astor, helps financethe Rhodes Scholarship system. Rhodes a high ranking Freemason wanted theMasonic clap-trap as part of these various new groups, but Milner and Brett didaway with the Masonic rituals and costumes, etc.In 1919, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA) was created. Andthe Astors were the major financial backers of the RIIA which functions as the4° cover of the Illuminati. For those who are new to this, the RIIA is theBritish equivalent to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) which takes a majorrole in the policy making process in the U.S. Waldorf Astoria was appointed tothe RIIA. Just above the CFR/RIIA are round table groups which were initiallynamed by Cecil Rhodes as the “Association of Helpers”. Cecil Rhodes set up theRhodes Scholarships to recruit and bring top men from several nations to Oxfordto be initiated into the Illuminati and to learn about how to bring in aOne-World-Government, So the initial selection into the Rhodes program--istdegree of the Illum.- is equivalent to the initiation into the Skull & Bones. Inthe picture you see how the Cliveden Astors were intimately connected to theRhodes Scholars. Rhodes Scholars frequently went to the Cliveden Estate. Bylooking at the genealogy chart you can see how the family in London broke upinto two powerful segments. One part centered around the Cleveden Estate.Another group became Barons-the Astors of Hever - or the Hever Astors for short.William Waldorf Astor owned the Pall Pall Mall Gazette, the Observer, and thePall Mall Magazine. The London Times was largely controlled by the Astors, andsince 1922 they have owned this major source of British news. The DuPonts andthe Rockefellers also have some major businesses where they too own blatantlarge holdings. However, most of the wealth of the 13 Top families is hidden sothat the ties to who owns it are difficult to track. Hoyt Ammidon has been aproxy for Vincent Astor and the other Astors. (See membership list of Illuminatiin this newsletter). The Astor family also used Owen Lattimore as their proxyfor opium trade, who in turn used Laura Spelman who was funded by the Institutefor Pacific Relations (IPR). The lPR was the group that supervised theIlluminati’s decision to allow Red China to share in the Opium trade. The puppetstrings behind big world events may not be seen by the public, but if we tracethe origins of several big events we see the Astors helping pull strings. TheIPR helped lay the groundwork for the Pearl Harbor attack. The Astors also werebehind the appeasement policy in Europe which allowed Hitler to become a threat.The Astors were also involved in the temperance movement against alcoholic drinkwhich was begun by the Women’s Christian Temperance Union. The temperancemovement was an elite created movement just like today we have big issues likeApartheid which are made up by them to keep us busy. Joseph Kennedy and Onassis,two other top 13 Illuminati families got rich off of the temperance movement bybootlegging. So many people have exposed the temperance movement (See OccultTheocracy for just one expose of Freemasonry’s involvement) that it is notpertinent to cover it here. Today’s equivalent of the temperance movement is the drug war. Col. Jack Astor,one of the world’s most powerful men, was among those who went down with theTitanic. To his honor, he didn’t have to sacrifice his life, but did. If he hadbeen a scoundrel he could have chased a woman and her children from somelifeboat. Many sermons have been preached on the significance of the Titanic,and I personally am beginning to feel that God laid it on the hearts of so manyof his ministers to understand that the Titanic was a judgment upon the pride ofthe world. More specifically it was a warning to the New World Order’s elite.Another Illuminati invention was Communism. This has been so thoroughlydocumented I don’t know why I have to state it here, except that there are stillpeople who haven’t taken the time to study it out. James II. Billington’s bookFire In the Minds of Men - a very scholarly work, and Occult Theocracy are somegood starting points to study this. The Fabian Society was also connected to theIlluminati. For instance, Illuminati prince Prof. George Edward Gordon Catlin,Pilgrim Soc. member was a member of the Fabian Society’s executive committee.The Fabian logo is a Wolf in Sheep’s clothing!! Fabians like H.G. Wells who wrote so eloquently on the New World Order with suchbooks as The New World Order, A Modern Utopia, The Open Conspiracy: Blue PrintsFor A World Revolution was a wolf in sheep clothing. H.G. Well’s made the NewWorld Order something that sounded advantageous to everyone, a Utopia of sorts.That is not what it will be. During the 1930’s, the Fabian Socialists createdthe Political and Economic Planning group (PEP). Mason Viscount Waldorf Astoriawas a leader of PEP. A confidential program that the PEP created and implementedthrough the British government was later described in a book Principles ofEconomic Planning in 1935. The book doesn’t explain why its cover has anostentatious Masonic square and compass displayed on its cover. George BernhardShaw, who was a communist and Fabian Socialist was the best friend of Lady NancyAstor, who became the first woman Member or Parliament. These two spend vastamounts of time together, much more than Nancy did with her husband Waldorf whoshe didn’t care to be around. Waldorf was the Mason that was mentioned earlierwho helped lead PEP. After Nancy Astor was elected (or selected by the elite) tobe the first lady MP, one of the Russell ladys soon afterwards also became anMP.Communism pretends it is the enemy of the rich capitalists, but both the richelite and the communist leaders are committed to wipe out Christianity, to wipeout free trade with monopolies, and to set up an IlluminatiOne-World-Government. Do you see they have similar goals? A picture is includedof Waldorf and Nancy Astor’s visit to Russia during the 1930s. The Astors werenot treated like enemies but like royalty. Can we see how the elite controlledpress has deceived us? Do not trust our Illuminati-controlled elite to protectus from communism, they control communism. Besides socialism, Nancy Astor was abig supporter of Christian Science. Christian Science was a front for witchcraftfrom its very beginning. For more information on what Christian Science is aboutI suggest people study Be Wise As Serpents, chapter 2.6 ‘The Healing Light”.Nancy Astor wrote The Natural History of the Vampire and a book on the earlyMason/Communist Bakunin. She used Grenfell family papers. The Grenfell familywere close friends to the Cliveden Astors. David Astor, (The Honorable) attendedBilderberger meetings in 1957 and 1966. Alpha Lodge is the lodge in England thatis traditionally for royalty. There are other elite lodges too, where those ofthe elite can protect themselves from rubbing shoulders with those of lesssocial stature. These are the type of masonic lodges that the Astors Join.In summary, an examination of the Astor family reveals their close connectionswith the full spectrum of Illuminati activities ranging from Freemasonry, theIlluminati itself, the Pilgrim Society, the Round Tables, Communism, FabianSocialism, CFR, RIIA. the Bilderbergers, as well as the various politically(that is Illuminati) tainted banks such as Chase Manhattan. Ava Alice MurielAstor was an occultist. She was born in 1902, was pretty but also a very seriouswoman. She was a very strong willed person that was able to dominate a person inher presence unless they were also strong willed. She was into Egyptian magicand believed she was the reincarnation of an Egyptian princess and a disciple ofIkhnaton. Alice Astor may have been one of the first people to enter King Tut’stomb, where she got herself a necklace. Aldous Huxley wrote Brave New World as apicture of things that were to come --most people think as a expose, but it wasreally more as a plan or blueprint Aldous Huxley and Alice did a great deal ofoccult things together. Their financial power is unchecked. Myers and othershave noted the Astors are above the law. The Top 13 families don’t obey thelaw-- they are the law. The Astors may have Illuminati Kings and Princes intheir ranks, they may have dozens of billions of assets, yet it will all benothing when they face their Creator at judgment.Follow-up on the AstorsOne of the items that I felt I should have given the readers back in the 1/1/93issue was the Masonic background of John Jacob Astor (1763-1848). For the recordhere is his masonic involvement: * Master of the Holland Lodge No.8, of N.Y.C.-1788 * Grand Treasurer of the Grand Lodge of New York-1796-1801 * Junior Grand Warden on two occasions-1796 & 1801 * Secretary of the Comamandery (then called Encampments).For a busy man, he kept himself busy In his Masonic work.The Astor Family Revisited with Information on Their Chanler BranchThere Are 13 Top Bloodlines Thirteen families or bloodlines are at the top, and five of these families arethe inside core of these thirteen. Prior to Be Wise As Serpents, the existenceof thirteen top families was not known by very many people. The existence of the13 families had come out in Berry Smith’s book Final Notice in the 1980s, butthe names were still unknown. Berry Smith of Australia wrote in his book FinalNotice p. 9, “There are 13 families or groups heading up the World Governmentplan. These families are portrayed as the 13 layers of blocks found on thestrange seal on the reverse side of the U.S. $1 bill.” In a little read article,one SRA victim recently wrote that Satanism was controlled by a few families.Recently, one of the Du Ponts was on a television show because the DuPonts weretrying to kidnap him because they didn’t like his support for the book Dope,Inc. I was able to get a copy of the book, and was overjoyed to find such anexcellent book. My sources have been telling me that the top Illuminati familieswere behind the drug trade. Yes, Satan’s top followers are also the kingpins indestroying humanity for profit through drug trafficking.The following families (besides others) or individuals from these families arementioned in Dope, Inc. as involved in some aspect of the drug trade: theAstors, Bundys, DuPonts, Freemans, Kennedy’s, Li’s, Rockefellers, Rothschilds,and Russells. It is no coincidence that nine of the Top 13 families would gettheir names in a book which revealed the big names behind the world’s illegalnarcotics trade. It should be mentioned that some other prominent Illuminatifamilies also play key roles in the drug trade such as the Bronfmans, Cabots,Shaws, Bacons, Perkins, Morgan, Forbes, Cisneros and Oppenheimers. Where have weseen such names before? There are names in Dope, Inc. that people would do wellto know the danger of such as Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, Robert Vesco, FrancoisGenoud of Switzerland, Ivan Slavkov of Bulgaria, the Duke of Kent - Master ofthe Grand Mother Lodge of the Scottish Rite, and Jardine Matheson to mention afew. All our favorite secret fraternal groups appear in Dope, Inc. too. Forinstance, the Triads, P2 Masonry, regular Freemasonry, the CIA, the Order of St.John, and the Jesuits. The Universal Christian Gnostic Church’s which practicesblack magic has a whole chapter showing its connection to the drug trade.Britain’s assassination bureau Permindex which has been mentioned previously inthis newsletter also gets a chapter in the book. In the Be Wise As Serpentsbook, I examine in detail only the Rothschilds and the Russells. I did notpresent much to back up my statements about the 13 families. Further, One of theunthinkable items that most people do not want to consider is that their leaderswho they have idolized may be utterly corrupt. There was nothing to do but sitdown and give the nitty-gritty details if the threat from the Illuminati was tobe properly understood. The facts would speak for themselves. The ideal solutionfor both writer and reader was for me to write up my research and for you toread it as a series of articles. There is only so much a person can assimilateat once, and these articles give lots of details. In January of this year Ibegan a series of articles on the top 13 families - families which the topexperts said nobody knew about. I did this with the hope of stimulating othersto notice these families, and to alert a wider sector of the Body of Christ. Theyoung colleague David J. Smith, who wrote part of the Jan. 1 article on theIlluminati, was led to carry out further research in addition to what the Jan. 1article had. Most of this article’s information on the Astors then is a resultof David’s research.Difficulty in Determining the Facts. Most of the material put out on the Astors shows the unmistakable mark ofdistortion by writers and historians giving information in line with what theAstors wanted the public to get. Books on the Astors contain both believable andunbelievable material, fact and fiction, some of the real facts may remainobscured forever, but that has not stopped us from getting the most accuratepicture we could reconstruct. The Astors do not make the task of investigatingthem easy. They have been very secret and very deceptive since they arrived inthis nation. John Jacob Astor, the first prominent Astor was a notorious liar,“he was known on occasion to invent romantic tales for the edification of peoplewho annoyed him with questions ...... Men who knew him best were, therefore,neither ready to discredit completely all legends about his exploits nor torepeat them as gospel. The truth, they suspected, lay somewhere between the twoextremes.” (Terrell, John Upton. Furs by Astor., p. 102.) John Jacob’s soninsured that his father’s lies would go unchallenged by incinerating all of hispersonal records, business records and other papers.Origin of The Family & its Name The Astors have come up with various origins for themselves and those for oragainst the family have added more ideas. One strong possibility is that theAstors are descendants of the Astorga family found in Southern Italy before the1600s. The most likely meaning of the name is that both Astorga and Astor arevariations meaning “Astarte” who is the mother of the occult. Her name is alsoSemiramis. In Babylon the trinity was Nimrod (the sun), Semiramis (the moon),and Tammuz (the morning star). In Egypt, these gods were called Osiris, Isis,and Horus. The pictures and statues Isis and Horns were renamed by the RomanCatholic Church as the Virgin Mary and the Christ-child.The Family in Europe The family may have moved from Savoy to Walldorf, Germany. Although it is not acertainty, the best explanation from the available clues indicates thatWalldorf’s coven had some important personages in the witchcraft/satanic systemand that Johann Astor’s family had power. At that time in Europe, the Astorfamily had no chance to turn their occult power into success. The power andclass structure In Europe was rigid and gridlocked. The boundaries betweenpeasant and aristocracy were solidly in place. So the family looked to the NewWorld to transmute their position in the Satanic hierarchy into financial wealthand power. Johann Astor in Walldorf was only a butcher. His best son John Jacob(1763-1848) was selected to establish the House of Astor in America. John Jacob Astor Goes to America At age 16, John Jacob Astor quit helping the family butcher business, went toEngland and then later to America. Looking at the details of things, and piecingthe truth together it appears that his Satanic authority was already in place,because he was able to travel to England, and as a German-speaking peasantconverse face to face with the Backhouse family in England. Of course thebiographers make it sound like John Jacob Astor left Germany for himself, ratherthan his family. Michael Astor gives a glimpse of John Jacob’s mission, “Heconcentrated almost entirely on building a fortune, on escaping the poverty ofhis childhood and establishing a secure financial position for his family inAmerica.” (Astor, Michael. Tribal Feeling p. 11)Overview The process of 400 years looks like this. Various Satanic families moved intothe Southwest German area in the late Medieval time period. Witchcraftassociated with Diana was practiced In Southwest Germany, and this began toalarm various elements of the Roman Catholic Church. The Astor family providesleadership in the covens in the Heidelberg area. Witchcraft spread virtually allover Southwest Germany. An examination of the old records from about 1500 to1650 show that witchcraft was being practiced throughout the area. (I have thenames of over 120 towns were it was practiced in SW Germany, the list derivedfrom old German records.) The Astors did not have the position, wealth, andpower that accorded their position in the late 1700s of occult leadership. InGermany, England and France there was no way to climb the social ladder.However, the New World presented opportunities. The Astors sent two sons toprepare the way for John Jacob, one to England, one to America, and then sentJohn Jacob their most promising brightest son to the New World.While in America the Astor family helped the Satanic elite headquartered inEngland to maintain its control over America. Having come from Germany, and alsodue to Satanism being secret, John Jacob Astor’s help given to pro-British-elitemoves were more difficult to suspect. After establishing themselves asaristocrats in America, the tribe of Astors moved to England, where because oftheir high social position in America, no one questioned the Queen bestowingtitles of nobility on them. All along the process, people with Illuminaticonnections opened doors for the Astors. At this point, it needs to be pointedout that there were ties between the following groups: English royalty, EnglishSatanism, English Freemasonry, and German witchcraft, and the Italian Blacknobility. (Taking the liberty I have as author of this article, I am going todigress to give some examples of these connections. Although on the surface thisdoesn’t directly pertain to the Astors, it does.) When one paints in the biggerpanorama of what was happening in the occult world, and then one sees a blazingstar streak across that panorama, then the real history of that blazing star isgiven by tracking its voyage through that panorama. However, the history bookshave intentionally hidden the significance of so many of the players and groupsthat lay along the track of that blazing streak.Specific GroupsOrder of the Knights of the Helmet--This was an illuminated secret society withSir Francis Bacon at its head. In order to hide its Masonic rituals, Sir FrancisBacon wrote a play entitled “The Order of the Helmet.” This was performed in 3Jan. 1594, and again for twelve days in December 1594. In Dec. 1594, Britisharistocrats who had been demonically illuminated, met and put on a “play.”Calling their initiation ceremony a play was a great cover. Sir Francis Baconwas made king and “prince of purple.” Various men were invested with the Collarof Knighthood of the Helmet, and took vows, and a “Series of Charges by six HighCouncilors” was given in a manner that is very similar to what the satanicS.R.I.A. does now. The reader may ask what does this have to do with the Astors?This is simply a few brief look at the background of what was happening in theoccult in Europe. The Queen of England sent Sir Francis Bacon as a young man inhis twenties to the continent of Europe. Sir Francis Bacon toured France inplaces such as Louvre, St. Cloud, Blois, Paris, and Poictiers, He also travelledto Germany, Italy and Spain. He visited the various royal courts, such as thecourt of Marguerite de Valois. Marguerite was married to King Henry of Navarre.Her mother was the evil Catherine de Medicis. Sir Francis Bacon also met withmany secret societies. At Marguerite’s court he spent time with “The Pleiade”fraternity, which was a group of 7 intellectuals.According to the best biographer of Sir Francis Bacon, who was Alf red Dodd(Alfred spent his entire life studying Sir Francis Bacon), Sir Francis Bacon wasinitiated into a large number of secret occult societies when he was on thecontinent of Europe. He learned Kabbalistic magic, Egyptian mysticism, Arabianmysticism, and the customs of the German Steinmetzin. (Dodd, Alfred. FrancisBacon’s Life-Story. London: Rider & Co., 1988, p.10.4.) This information hasbeen provided to give some feel for how the occult in Europe was in contact withits various parts, and that its tentacles included many of the royal families.Hell Fire Club -- This was a secret Satanic cult which was associated with earlyFreemasonry. When the connections became known between the Satanists of the HellFire Club and the elite of Freemasonry, Freemasonry and the elite made someradical moves. First, Freemasonry publicly proclaimed that it had nothing to dowith the Hell Fire Club. when the Hell Fire Club was publicly disbanded by thegovernment (acting on orders from people that tied-in with the club). Later,quietly the club was reconstituted. Phillip, 1 at Duke of Wharton (1698-1731)who was the second person of nobility to be Grand Master of England’s Freemasons(G.M. of the Grand Lodge 6/1722-11/25/1723) was president of the Hell Fire Club.He was an M.P, in the House of Lords. In 1726, he left England and was abasically brought into ill-repute by the Masons, who distanced themselves fromhim. George Lee, Earl of Lichfield was also another prominent Mason who was amember of the Hell Fire Club. Benjamin Franklin, who was the head of theAmerican Freemasons in various capacities, and also the head of the Rosicruciansand a number of other secret occult groups was also a member of the Hell FireClub. Benjamin Franklin’s Satanism was not mentioned in my Be Wise As Serpentsbook, but he was an important Satanist who was part of the Order of theQuest--that is the group which has been entrusted with the plans for bringing inthe New World Order of Satan. Remember that John Jacob Aster was very involvedwith Freemasonry, as were a number of his intimate friends such as N.Y. GovernorDeWitt Clinton and General John A. Armstrong. In regards to the Hell Fire Club,the Earl of Sandwich, Benjamin Franklin and Sir Francis Dashwood were leaders inthe Hell Fire Club and were also Post-Master Generals of the British PostalService, All were Freemasons too. Their positions as Post-Master Generalsallowed them total access to the mail, and allowed them to spy on thecommunications of the 18th century. The man who became Post-Master General afterDashwood, who moved on to be a M.P, in the Br. Parliament, was the Mason JohnWilkes. John Wilkes took over in 1766 (in 1774 was Lord Mayor of London). Wilkesthen brought one of the original Hell Fire Club members, a friend of his WillisHill to help with the Postal Service. The next Post-Master general was thetotally corrupt man the Earl of Sandwich, who served until 1771. BenjaminFranklin spent the summers of 1772, 1773, and 1774 at Dashwood’s estate in WestWycombe. The caves under Dashwood’s estate at West Wycombe were used for Satanicsexual rituals, which were participated in by Benjamin Franklin.Ordo Saturnus--This is an old secret satanic German order. In the last fewnewsletters, I have been educating people on the meaning of Saturn. It meansSatan. This previous information helps us understand John Jacob Astor IV when hewrites in his book A Journey in Other Worlds, “The souls of the righteousdeparted were found on Saturn, where, to a background of weird music, pulsatinghearts, luminous brains and centers of spiritual activity quiver with motion.”(A side comment: John Jacob Astor IV had a reputation for his insatiable sexuallust to paw women.) One of the people we have to investigate in relation to theOrdo Saturnus is Valentine Jeune, who was John Jacob Astor’s mentor in Walldorf,Germany. Jeune may well have belonged to an organization such as Ordo Saturnus.John Jacob Astor Leaves Germany for England & America John Jacob Astor arrived in England and may well have been introduced In Englandto British Intelligence by his brother George. At any rate, he got involved inBritish intelligence which has always been closely linked to Freemasonry and theelite. He spent time socially with the Backhouse family which an aristocraticfamily. How do you suppose such a supposedly destitute young man could beaccepted so easily into the Backhouse social scene? This is not explained bymodern biographers. After four years, his brother George then sent him to America to representGeorge’s music company. His brother Henry met him when he arrived in 1784 at age20 and introduced him to the occult world in New York City. Thomas Backhouse &Co. was a leading house in the lucrative fur trade. John Jacob Astor set out tobring the fur trade under his own control. There is a tact that must be faced.the elite’s Committee of 300, a secret legislative group of the Illuminati,decided that John Jacob Astor could expand into the fur trade and into the opiumnarcotics trade. Dope, Inc. shows that the Astor family was the first Americanfamily to get into the Opium trade, and that their opium trade had was a specialprivilege that most other American businesses did not even try to compete with.Why? Dope, Inc. doesn’t say this but I know that it is because the Committee of300 decides such things, not free enterprise. American furs yielded 1000% profitin those days. The privilege of fur trading was a pot of gold so to speak thatthe Committee of 300 gave Astor, and it could only have happened because theAstor family in Walldorf was already part of a principal Satanic bloodline. (TheIlluminati members of the Astor family today use their influence to help thoseof the Illuminati in their dope trade.) William Backhouse the Americanrepresentative of the London Backhouse family and John Jacob’s brother Henrywere two of John Jacob initial contacts in the New World. Soon John Jacob hadmet all types of people involved in New York’s occult world. John Jacob marriedSarah Todd. John Jacob’s step-mother Christina Barbara is described as “theperfect, cruel fairy tale stepmother.” John Jacob ‘raised the principle ofself-interest to the level of a philosophy and ..... claimed for himself anatural superiority over his less able and less powerful fellow men, a sort ofGod-given right to exploit the world and its inhabitants for his personal gain,This was not mere cynicism, but a genuine belief that in some way [he was] amongthe chosen people for whose convenience and advancement life was ordered .....Such people ... make history, but they also pervert it in human terms becausetheir world and the codes that govern it have nothing to do with morality.’(Sinclair, David. Dynasty The Astors and Their Times. p. 59) ‘Astor tookFreemasonry seriously... [Gov. DeWitt] Clinton rose unusually fast in thedegrees, but the German Immigrant [John Jacob] who talked at times as if he hadmarbles in his mouth was not far behind him. Astor eventually caught up toClinton...’ (Terrell. Furs by Astor, p. 84). DeWitt Clinton’s uncle, GeorgeClinton, who served as Jefferson’s Vice-President was also a member of theirHolland Lodge No. 8. Archibald Russell of the Russell family, as well as twomembers of the elite Livingstone family were members of this lodge too at thetime. The Livingstone family was participating in the Committee of 300 at thattime. One of my Masonic reference books states that business at the HollandLodge No, 8 was conducted in German. If so, why were all these other meninvolved with it who apparently had English as their mother tongue? In the1/1/93 issue, Astor’s dirty real estate deals and his activity as a drugking-pin were discussed. However, Astor’s connivance to create a nation on thewest coast wasn’t. Thomas Jefferson, who I have now come to realize was a partof the Illuminati, was in on the plot. Jefferson said that he “hoped for theestablishment of an independent nation on the Pacific Coast, bound to the UnitedStates by ties of blood, language, and friendship.” The Northwest was to becomea sovereign nation under Astor’s rule. The plan failed miserably due to avariety of reasons. Another item that was missed in the earlier article was howJohn Jacob Astor profited by using his own courier system and powerful friendsto profit from the War of 1812. Astor knew the War of 1812 was coming and he sethimself up to profit from it in several ways. (His Masonic brother and friendJohn A. Armstrong 1758-1843 helped the British war effort as the AmericanSecretary of War. A descendent of John’s later married into the Astors.) Astorhimself helped the British when he could profit by it. The two illuminatiJefferson and Gallatin gave Astor special sailing privileges which netted himmuch profit. When war was declared against Great Britain, Astor sent agents tothe British forts in Canada to inform them. This gave the British advanceknowledge of the war, before the Americans troops knew. This allowed the Britishto seize northern American forts and to insure that the British had control ofthe region’s fur trade. This was essential for Astor to get control of the furmarket, because then when the British furs were embargoed he had lesscompetition. He obtained special permission from the President to import allfurs owned by him and held in Canada before the war. He used this permissionillegally to trap new furs. When the war ended, Astor was able to heat everyoneelse to Europe with his furs and make a killing. Astor cleared his name ofshame, by sending Washington, D.C. information about a mutiny at a British fortwhich allowed the U.S. army to take advantage of the enemy’s weak condition tocapture the area. John Jacob Astor traded in guns, and his firearms were used inat least one-Latin American Revolution. Bear in mind Latin-American revolutionshave all been planned in Masonic Lodges. When employees of John Jacob Astorwould trap for or trade furs with the Astor fur houses, they would he paid withletters of credit. Then Astor agents would he sent out to ambush and kill them,so that the Astor Fur Company could save money. The deaths were blamed onIndians. Zachery Taylor stated, “Take the American Fur Company in the aggregate,and they are the greatest scoundrels the world ever knew.” (O’Connor, Harvey.The Astors p.44) William Backhouse Astor This was the son of John Jacob Astor. He was infamous for his hank treatment ofthousands of people who rented from him in New York. There were repealed riotsby tenants who were opposed by the harsh filthy living conditions in thebuildings Astor owned, but their complaints were consistently ignored by Astorand their riots suppressed by the police. Only half of the children of histenants lived to age 20. The Astors were deeply involved with the Tammanyorganization. William B. supported the corrupt administration of the infamousNew York mayor, Fernando Wood. The government at that time was a pack of corruptmen. When Wood was exposed, Astors involvement was overlooked. This is anotherexample of Astor power.John Jacob III He was the son of William Backhouse Astor. He was just as haughty, just ascruel, and just as corrupt as his father and grandfather had been. He created“sweat shops” for the poor masses living in his New York tenements. He alsosupported corrupt politicians such as the criminal “Boss” Tweed who ran NYC. TheTweed Ring stole millions of dollars from the city of New York. Before theyfinally got caught and sent to prison Mayor Tweed and gang cost the city $200million. Again John Jacob Astor III’s power allowed his involvement to bebasically overlooked by the press, while Tweed went to prison for life.The Chanler Branch Most of the Astors took off for England, but one branch of the Astors that isclearly involved in Satanism and the occult is the Chanler family. The Chanlerfamily have Astor blood via “Madie” Astor Ward. The Chanler’s parents died at anearly age, and the Rokeby Estate in NY was given by the Astors so that a cousinMary Marshall could raise the Chanler children. The Chanler family is one branchthat clearly shows all the earmarks of the Satanic hierarchy. The behavior ofRobert Chanler, Elizabeth Chanler and Armstrong Chanler have all the classicearmarks of having MPD, and having suffered SRA. The Rokeby mansion that theChanler family lived in was a haunted house of the first rate. Fairies, ghosts,signs and portents, and all type of occult activity takes place at this mansion,when top ex-Illuminati members who have managed to escape Satanism describetheir home life, they mention that occult phenomena was a natural part of homelife. This certainly is what life has been like at the Chanler Rokeby mansion.The Chanlers are not well known publicly but have been part of the social sceneof the elite. Theodore Roosevelt and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (of the eliteCabot family) were good friends of the Chanlers. The Chanlers created the townRoanoke Rapids, North Carolina. (At some point I hope to do an expose on theresort area in that general area that is a “meat market” for the Illuminati.Families like the Bill Clinton’s go down there every year for vacation to minglewith other middle management families that the Illuminati use as lackeys.Illuminati “scouts” watch and choose who they want to use for political office,etc.) A Who’s Who of the Astor orphans--the Chanler family who are of interestto our study of the Illuminati will now be given.John Armstrong Chanler-married mystic novelist and morphine addict Amelie Rives.“Once wandering in the twilight she asked wistfully, “Do you think If I drank awhole cupful of warm, bubbly blood, I would see a real fairy” ... Then there hadbeen the period during which she suffered anguish over the thought that Satanwas banished from Paradise forever; she prayed with tears that ultimately hemight be pardoned and readmitted to celestial bliss.” (Thomas, Lately. The AstorOrphans: A Pride of Lions p. 76.) John carried on spiritual experiments in whathe termed “esoteric Buddhism”. Due to his obsession with this practice and abusiness fight with his brothers they put him in an insane asylum. He finallydid get released. One has to wonder what the whole story was behind theincarceration. His esoteric Buddhism or “x-faculty” was a trance state where aspirit spoke or did automatic writing through him. His eye color would changewhen this spirit worked through him.Margaret Livingston Chanler retained the rights to Rokeby. She married into theAldrich family, which is another Illuminati family. The Aidriches now ownRokeby.William Chanler was a friend of Tom Foley who was the Tammany district leader ofthe Irish-Italian district east of city hall. Another friend was JackFollansbee. Jack Follansbee’s cousin was William Randolf Hearst, an Illuminatusof the 6° who got Billy Graham’s ministry going by financing the first severalyears. The Hearst family is in the Illuminati. One of the Rothschild descendantsDon Hearst Bauer, has changed his name to Don Hearst.Winthrop Chanler’s wife, Amelie Rive, her father William Cabell Rives studiedlaw under Thomas Jefferson.The Roosevelt Connection The Roosevelt family has been connected to the Delano family which Is a BlackVenetian Noble family that goes back for many centuries. The lives of thesefamilies also intertwine with the Astors. Examples of the interweaving are: * Franklin Hughes Delano--heir to a massive whale oil fortune. He married Lavia Astor, daughter of the original William Buckhouse Astor. * James Roosevelt Roosevelt-married Helen Astor, daughter of William Backhouse, Jr. * James Roosevelt--a Freemason, he married the sister of Vincent Astor’s wife.SummaryIn our revisit to the Astors, we have examined in more detail the early life ofJohn Jacob Astor and his connections to Satanism. We have touched on his son andgrandson who led the Astor family after John Jacob died. We have seen more oftheir meanness and connections to corruption. We examined bow Satanism and theoccult had a hold on England even back when John Jacob Astor came to the NewWorld. Three important occult organizations of the 17th & 18th century wereintroduced. We have looked at the Chanler family, a branch of the Astor familywhich is part of Satanism. We also looked at how the Roosevelts and Delanofamilies have been associated with the Astors."},{"pageContent":" The Bundy Bloodline(My knowledge and research is limited. So much more work can be done to uncoverthe evil works of darkness that collaborate to destroy the Christian faith.Hopefully articles like this will serve as spotlights on the Jekyll-and-Hydesthat ravage our land. And that seeing their opponents better, Christians willavoid the many secret spiritual undertows that drown so many.) In the 1980s oneof the most famous criminals was a serial killer named Ted (Theodore) R. Bundy.It is not publicly known why he killed so many innocent victims. Ted Bundy toldhis girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall that \"the force\" caused him to kill. Bundy’sconfession to her was given after his final arrest in Florida. Elizabeth wrotedown his confession as he gave it to her over the phone. Ted said, \"I don’t havea split personality. I don’t have blackouts. I remember everything I’ve done.Like Lake Sammamish. We went out to Farrell’s for ice cream after eatinghamburgers. It wasn’t like I had forgotten or couldn’t remember, but it was justover...gone...the force wasn’t pushing me anymore. I don’t understand it. Theforce would just consume me.\" (Kendall, Elizabeth. The Phantom Prince My Lifewith Ted Bundy. Seattle: Madrona Publishers, 1981, p.176) \"The force\" is thevery term that high level Satanists use to describe the power that they believein, which they believe can be used for either good or evil. The movie Star Warssurprisingly used the Illuminati’s term \"the force\", which up until that timehad been reserved for esoteric use by Satanism and the occult. This is part ofthe plan to take the occult and its goals and instill it into the public’sthinking and goals, so that the conspiracy becomes an \"open conspiracy\" with thegeneral public promoting the drive toward witchcraft as the world religion andits One-World-Government.Who was Ted, and why did he do what he did? There are a great number of unknownsabout Ted. And although it appears to the public that the newspapers covered hiscrimes thoroughly, often appearances can be very deceiving. If Ted Bundy wasrelated to the Bundy Family of the hierarchy, we could expect several thingsalmost without doubt, One is that his Satanic activities and any occultconnotations to the murders would be kept very secret by the police, thenewspapers, and his family, that information about the case and Ted Bundy wouldbe closely contained. Interestingly, when I recently went to research Ted Bundy,every copy (all four of them) of the book Ted Bundy: Conversations with a Killerby Stephen G. Michaud had been stolen from the Portland Central Library. One ofthe other books on him was also missing, and the other was overdue. Theuniversity library which is on a different library network was just as bad. Idid my research across the border in Washington State. Another category of booksthat is consistently stolen I have been told by the library staff are books onFreemasonry. Consequently, the Portland Central Library has a policy thatinterlibrary loan books on Freemasonry cannot be taken out of the library, eventhough the lending library doesn’t mind if they are checked out. Another exampleof how books relating to Satanism or the Satanic conspiracy become rare is whenI checked the Thurston Co. WA library’s computerized system for Anton LeVey’sSatanic Bible. Of the system’s 18 copies, 14 were lost (I assume stolen), onewas listed \"trace\", and three were being held by the libraries (that is, theywere not out on the shelves).Before proceeding any further, let me categorically state that I haven’t foundanything that ties Ted Bundy in with the top Satanic family of the Bundys, norhave I found anything that disproves it either. I don’t know either way. Stillthere are some interesting items about Theodore Bundy. (Perhaps someone elsewill be motivated do the genealogy work, and save me the work.) Ted was a lawstudent. One of the schools he studied law at was University of Puget Sound, WA.A major reason he did so poorly in law school was the immense stress that tookplace in his life in connection to the time and effort he put into murderingbeautiful women. Yet, his poor academic performances were no barrier to hispolitical success. Ted does have a number of items that seem suspicious. First,Ted drove all the way from Washington State to Miami, FL to take part in NelsonRockefeller’s 1968 campaign. He was a big Rockefeller fan. Ted was appointedAssistant Chairman of the Washington State Republican Central Committee, Tedtravelled in elite social circles, and was preparing for a campaign for Ted torun for State Governor. For instance in 1973, he was part of the RepublicanState Committee. He may have been on this committee in other years too.(Ironically, Ted Bundy had served briefly on the Seattle Crime Commission on aStudy of White Collar Crime.) For whatever reasons-whether it be eliteconnections or his winning personality, it is certain that he had a bigpolitical career in front of him as a young person if he had not blown things.Second, almost all the serial killers have had connections to Satanism and inevery case the media and the police have suppressed or greatly downplayed theirconnections to Freemasonry and Satanism. For instance, Charles Manson(Freemason, O.T.O. & Satanism), Sam of Sam Berkowitz (O.T.O. & Satanism), Jackthe Ripper (Freemason), and Henry Lee Lucas (Satanism). Could it be that TedBundy had a Satanic side to him? I haven’t seen anything that shows that hewasn’t a Satanist. He did join the Mormon Church during the middle of timeperiod of years when he was murdering innocent women, but his motive for joiningcertainly had nothing to do with sincerely serving God.I have learned that Ted had an interest in Astrology. Perhaps the closest personto Ted Bundy, his longtime girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall, wrote in her book ThePhantom Prince My Life with Ted Bundy that she didn’t know why he brutallykilled so many women. She was aware that he liked bondage-type sexualarrangements. But the inner workings of Ted’s mind were a mystery to her. AndTed was capable of some of the biggest lying and yet coming across totallyhonest. (This type of lying goes on every day by the Illuminati members who as ahabit make boldface lies to the public.) Ted Bundy was adopted by his fatherJohnnie Bundy, who was a dentist in the northwest area of Washington State. Whatis this main branch of Bundy’s that we are speculating that Ted’s father mightor might not be tied to? The original Bundy family came to the New World before1635 to Boston, MS. A few years later they moved to Taunton, MS. A large branchof these Bundys went to Connecticut, and later a few went on to New York.Another group of colonial American Bundys were in North Carolina. The particularmembers of the Bundy family that are prominent in the New World Order today, arethe ones who would have inherited the position of authority over the family ifSatanic tradition had been followed. The Bundy family was an old American familythat was part of the Eastern establishment, but with only a few exceptions likeCongressman Solomon Bundy in the early 19th century, the family has only comeinto the public’s eye during the twentieth century. This family also surfaces innot so prominent places too. Two of the key early Watchtower Society leaderswere Bundys. These were Walter H. Bundy, who went with Charles Taze Russell toGreat Britain on his May 29-31, 1909 trip, and Edwin Bundy who worked at theBethel Headquarter at the turn of the century and travelled around the U.S. forthe Watchtower Society from 1906 to 1910. The following is my own Who’s Who ofthe Bundy Illuminati family. After this list introducing our cast of characters,this article will get back to discussing the Bundys.Who’s Who of the Bundys * Eric Bundy- Placed in charge of the prisoner Howard Hughes by the llluminati family of Onassis.

Dist., trustee Ohio University, editor of some journalsWhat Is so Powerful About the Bundys?Most Americans would not recognize the Bundy family as a powerful elite family.However, during recent history two Bundy brothers held the key positions thatcontrolled most of the information that was fed to U.S. Presidents during theKennedy and Johnson administrations. When Johnson took over after J.F. Kennedywas assassinated McGeorge Bundy was in the key position as Nat. Sec. Advisor todetermine what the President did and didn’t hear. His brother was in a key StateDept. position. Both Bundy brothers were also fraternal brothers of theIlluminati Order of the Skull and Bones. Interestingly, Jonas Mills Bundy(1835-1891) was a key advisor to President Grant, President Garfield, andPresident Chester A. Arthur. McGeorge Bundy and his brother William P. Bundyhave held important CFR and important Bilderberger positions. This in itselfmakes it clear that the position and power of these two men is extensive.McGeorge Bundy sat on MJ-12, which is the council of wise men that rules theUnited States. (See Be Wise As Serpents chptr. 2.13 for an explanation aboutwhat MJ-12 is and documentation). United States has been the most powerfulnation overall on the earth, so without a doubt McGeorge has had both greatpublic-known and great secret power. The three most prominent Bundys to writeabout are Harvey Hollister Bundy, Sr., William P. Bundy, and McGeorge Bundy. Wewill now take a look at these three along with Eric Bundy, who was given a keyposition in a sinister plot to steal all wealth and power of Howard Hughes. andHarry W. Bundy, who was a chief adept of one branch of the Illuminati.Harvey Hollister Bundy Sr.His grandfather was a lawyer and a Congressman, and his father was a lawyer.Harvey also became a lawyer. But he didn’t stop there. Harvey was initiated inthe Skull & Bones in 1909. After his law degree he did some world travelling.Then in 1914, he began working for Justice Wendell Holmes. Later in 1929, AlgerHiss (CFR) also began working for Justice Holmes. Hiss was a communist spy andlater a key player during F.D. Roosevelt’s reign. Harvey’s son William P.narrowly missed having his career ruined because William had financially helpedAlger Hiss. Harvey had five children. Three of these had ties to the Skull andBones Order also.Harvey became the Ass. Secretary of State 1n July, 1931 until Mar. 1933 underHenry Lewis Stimson. Secretary of State H.L. Stimson was also a Skull & Bonesmember (init. 1888) Harvey’s son McGeorge would co-author a book with Stimsonentitled On Active Service in Peace and War in 1940. Harvey was special legalassistant to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Harvey became the SpecialAssistant to the Secretary of War during W.W. II. He travelled with the Sec. ofWar overseas numerous times. It is often said 1f you want to know where the realpower lies look at a man’s advisors. Here we see Harvey giving advice to the US.Secretary of and Skull & Bones (Be Wise As Serpents, pp. 49-50) where we give.various reasons why Covington & Burling are highly suspected of left-wingactivity.) William began his War during the United States’ largest militarychallenge in history. Harvey was one of the most key figures 1n the supervisionof the Manhattan Project developing the Atom bomb. He was the key Pentagon man.He did liaison work between the War Dept. and Office of Scientific Research andDevelopment. In 1952, Harvey took over the Carnegie Endowment for Peace fromJohn Foster Dulles. The Carnegie Endowment for Peace has been a major vehiclefor the Illuminati to finance tax free various projects. In 1971 for instance,the Carnegie Endowment for Peace spent over $2 million, and had assets of $41million. The stated object of the foundation is \"to promote internationalpeace.\" This is the type of peace that President George Bush told the UnitedNations that the world needed. Skull & Bones member George Bush informed theU.N. that a One-World-Government peace was needed by the world. Harvey got thejob at Carnegie because Alger Hiss had been convicted of perjury. John FosterDulles was on record recommending Alger Hiss to replace himself. (See Eleanor,Allen, and John Foster Dulles and Their Family Network by Leonard Mosley, p.311.) The various men who run the various Carnegie Foundations work with theRockefellers.William P. BundyWilliam P. Bundy started out his career 1n 1947 working for Covington & Burlingwhich is a firm that represents many of the Illuminati in Washington, D.C.Covington & Burling appears to have been a conduit for the Illuminati to createa left-wing political movement in the US. (Read Antony Sutton’s book America’sSecret Establishment An Introduction to the Order of Skull) having a careerworking for the CIA at this time (1947), and in 1951 he quit Covington & Burlingto begin openly working for the CIA as an analyst, and then as assistant to thedeputy director of the CIA. His job as assistant required him to get AtomicEnergy Clearance. In 1953, Joe McCarthy had caught onto the New World Order.Although the history books and papers report that he was \"commie\" hunting, Ifone reads Joe McCarthy’s own words it is clear be was gunning for the New WorldOrder. Senator Joe McCarthy subpoenaed William Bundy to testify. The Senatorknew he could expose a great deal if William P. Bundy was questioned, even if hemight try to lie. The calling card to get the subpoena was the fact that Williamhad donated at least $500 to help communist spy Hiss defend himself. Hiss’sbrother Donald worked for Covington & Burling when William was there, and Algerhad worked at the firm William’s Dad had worked at. McCarthy sent down manysubpoenas but Allen Dulles, who was part of the Illuminati and the CIA directorignored the subpoenas, and eventually was able to get William P. out of thecountry so that he would not have to face McCarthy’s questions. The State Dept.was going to arrest William P. at the dock as he was trying to escape on theQueen Mary, but Alien Dulles was able to get the State Dept. to call off thearrest, and William P. Bundy sailed. McCarthy wrote Allen Dulles, \"I note yourrefusal to give us any answers to our questions. Your insistence is veryrevealing.It would seem that the last man in the world who would try to protect and hidethe facts about one of his top officer’s [Bundy] association with, andcontributions to, a convicted traitor would be the head of the CIA. I think itnecessary for me to call your attention to the tremendous damage you thereby doto this organization. That the matter cannot and will not rest here is, ofcourse, obvious.’ (A Biography of Eleanor. Allen. and John Foster Dulles andtheir family network by Leonard Mosley, p.322) Lou Russell who was an importantfigure in the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) was part of theIlluminati power structure. This is something one wouldn’t expect. It appearslike some of the men McCarthy thought were on his side weren’t. While theHiss/Bundy affair led to McCarthy (a genuine patriot) being killed anddiscredited, someone else who was a socialist and lackey of the CFR was givenwide publicity as an anti-communist hero from what happened to Hiss. Funny howthe credit is distributed by the establishment media. This socialist was RichardNixon (CFR). He was given false credit for convicting Hiss (CFR) to build afalse public image as an anti-communist crusader. Nixon did not do the footworketc., to get Hiss convicted contrary to the false image the establishmentnewspapers and history books give. Later, protected by his \"anti-communist\"mask, Nixon would recognize Red China, among many other pro-communist NWO acts.By trying to subject a member of one of the top 13 Illuminati families toCongressional questioning, McCarthy had signed his death warrant. It was notlong before the Illuminati killed McCarthy. And they have dragged this greatpatriot’s name through the mud. Skull and Bones George Bush was still taking potshots at Joe McCarthy during the 1992 Presidential campaign. William P. Bundycommented on the help Allen Dulles gave him throughout the Hiss affair with thefollowing words, \"I guess there was an element of tribal loyalty in the wayAllen handled this, that he knew me, he knew my brother, a sort of fellowfeeling-a feeling for the comradeship of the CIA but also a tribal feelingtoward a set of people who were in law firms, entered government when the needwas felt, could be invited back to the house.\" Yes, that set of people is calledthe Illuminati. In 1960, William P. Bundy while still with the CIA was placed asthe Staff Director of the mew Presidential Commission on National Goals. Ifnational goals are seriously being set, then that implies that something ishappening above and beyond the American people voting at the voting booths,congressmen voting at the Capital, and the market place simply functioning.Indeed there is a guiding hand behind events which is taking us down apreplanned route to achieve Illuminati goals. Bundy’s Commission on NationalGoals set down goals that are Hegelian philosophy. The goals state that theindividual has a duty to advance the will of the state, and that the state \"isto stimulate changes of attitude ... The American citizen in the years aheadought to devote a larger portion of his time and energy directly to solution ofthe nation’s problems...many ways are open for citizens to participate in theattainment of national goals.\" (America’s Secret Establishment. p.50)Eric BundyThe Illuminati uses what is called Hegelian philosophy. A thesis is set up. Anantithesis (the opposite of the thesis) is then set up, and then out of theconflict of the two comes the synthesis. Hegelian philosophy is really a fancyterm for what the Illuminati were doing before the term was invented. To bringthis all down to street terms, the Illuminati’s Mafia (yes the Illuminaticreated and runs the Mafia) would send businessmen a letter demanding money andsigned with the imprint of a black hand. (This was the thesis). If the demandwasn’t met then the business would be burned or the businessman hurt. Then theMafia would introduce themselves as potential protectors for the businessmanfrom the Black Hand extortioners (themselves). (This is the antithesis). Andwhen the businessman begins paying the Mafia for protection that is thesynthesis. The Illuminati are doing this tactic all over the world, and itcertainly has almost everyone fooled. Mafia strongman Sam Giancana (birth nameMomo Salvatore Guingano) had a girlfriend Judith Exner that J.F. Kennedy (amember of one of the top 13 Illuminati families) spent regular time withsexually. Giancana also had a friend named Robert Mayheu who worked underStavros Niarchos of the Onassis family. Stavros Niarchos is a Bilderberger and anephew of Aristotle Onassis. The Onassis family, - of the top 13 illuminatifamilies, runs the Mafia. Robert Mayheu worked for Giancana and the CIA. Why wasa CIA agent willing to help Giancana?-well as I indicated in other places theCIA is run by the top Illuminati families, and so is the Mafia. This CIA agent,or Mafia man, or Illuminati henchman whatever you want to call Robert Mayheushows up in the details of the Kennedy Assassination and the kidnapping ofbillionaire Howard Hughes. Robert Mayheu and other men like him had infiltratedHoward Hughes’ organization prior to the kidnapping. In Mar. 1957, a wing orbranch of the Illuminati under Onassis (commonly known as the mob or mafia)kidnapped the upstart billionaire and genius Howard Hughes. Now do you see whathappens to competition to the Illuminati Top 13 families? Either you join them,or you are destroyed. Satan must keep his organization intact. From the bestinside information I have obtained concerning this area of Illuminati activity,apparently two -who were look-alike. to Howard Hughes were used. The reason twowere used will be explained. First, because the \"Howard Hughes’ (actually LWayne Rector) who on rare occasions showed himself was a fake the Illuminatiwanted to keep him out of the public eye as much as possible, so it made senseto have another double. The natural story was that because Howard Hughes was soreclusive, he had hired Hollywood actor Brooks Randall to be his double to keepnewsmen, and other snoops from following him. When Howard Hughes (L. WayneRector) would go out, then the decoy (Brooks Randall) would be employed to keepphotographers, process servers and private detectors away from the Illuminati’sreal \"Howard Hughes\" (L. Wayne Rector). It was Robert Mayheu that hired BrooksRandall. And working with Mayheu and somewhat over Robert Mayheu was Eric Bundywas given oversight of the day to day operations involving the control of theirprisoner Howard Hughes, who most likely died in 1971, and whose public death was1975. For those wanting an official \"paper trail\" see Senate Report No. 94-465entitled \"Alleged Assassination Plots involving Foreign Leaders\", 11/20/75, p.74 where Mayheu’s role is talked about in the death of Onassis. One of Mayheu’stop men was Lou Russell, who- besides working for Mayheu, the CIA, the Onassisfamily-was the person who bandied the security and investigative needs of theRepublican National Committee (RNC), and Russell was with the company thatprovided security for the Watergate complex when it was burglarized. The Russellfamily is a top 13 family. The Russell family will of course have its own turnto have an article about them in this newsletter. It is Lou Russell who helpedNixon get Hiss convicted. Were McCarthy and Hiss used? It appears so. John Smithnow puts out the theory contained in his book Alger Hiss: The True Story whichclaims Alger Hiss was framed. So we have come full circle. The communist agentthat almost ruined William P. Bundy’s career, because Bundy was Alger Hiss’s andDonald Hiss’s friend, is now exonerated by a book written by an establishmentresearcher.McGeorge BundyAntony C. Sutton does an excellent job in his book on the Skull & Bones Order indescribing how McGeorge Bundy received preferential treatment all through hislife. Consistently, McGeorge Bundy got jobs for which there were thousands ofbetter candidates. McGeorge Bundy went to Yale where he was initiated into theSkull & Bones in 1940. McGeorge then went to Harvard. After this, McGeorgejoined the army as a private. Very few privates ever achieve the rate ofpromotion that McGeorge received. Within a year after joining as a private,McGeorge was promoted to captain. Not only was he made a captain he was placedon staff to plan the logistics and other details of the invasion of Sicily andthe Normandy Invasion. That is honestly fantastic. How can a greenhorn withoutexperience have the experience to know how much supplies, etc. are needed for acertain operation? Bear in mind that these calculations are for battles in whichthe wrong combination of supplies could mean death or defeat for a unit. AsSutton points out on pg. 51, \"Can a 23-year-old, with no military experience,undertake planning for amphibious operations? The answer is obviously no, evenif his father (The Order) is in the Pentagon as an aide to the Secretary of War(The Order).\" After the war McGeorge continues his phenomenal climb from job tobigger job, often with no credentials. 1945. He becomes assistant to theSecretary of War and co-authors a book with Stimson.Then McGeorge without any experience or credentials in economics becomes aconsultant to the Economic Cooperation Administration. Then he becomes foreignpolicy analyst for Presidential candidate Thomas Dewey. Christians may recognizefrom the instruction that the Bible gives that pride warps our abilities toaccurately see. How much pride has been installed in men like McGeorge that theyfeel comfortable to hop from one unqualified position to another and to makeweighty decisions.1949- Bundy was invited to Harvard University to teach as an assistant professorand in four years is made the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences atHarvard! How does anyone become Dean of a prestigious University departmentafter four years of teaching. Not only has McGeorge been treated as if he is aninstant military genius, an economic whiz, now he is bead of the arts andsciences.Bundy becomes the National Security Advisor. From 1961 to 1966 he is the SpecialAssistant for National Security Affairs to the President. This gives him greatcontrol over what the Presidents are told. For instance on pages 177-178, Suttonquotes a conversation between McGeorge Bundy, Dean Achison (Scroll & Key-anotherIlluminati initiation point), and President Kennedy recorded in a memorandum.President Kennedy is lead to believe that the United States has deserted itsally of Portugal to aid nationalists in Angola, when in fact the US. wassupporting Marxist guerrillas (that is communist guerrillas). In 1966, McGeorgewas appointed President of the Ford Foundation, another Illuminati foundationthat is promoting their agenda. McGeorge brought in Harold Howe II to be Vice.President, a position that Howe was unqualified for, except that Howe was aSkull & Bones brother and was a team player that would help promote the NewWorld Order agenda with its Hegelian philosophy and socialism. Both of the Fordson the Foundation board resigned in disgust at the way these Skull & Bones wereusing the Ford Foundation.Harry W. BundyHarry W. Bundy was a Mason, a Satanist and the chief adept (9°) of the Coloradopart of the SRICF. To clarify to the reader what this all means allow me toinform you about the structures Satan has built. Pure Satanism in order tofunction easier has set up some branches which are secret, but if the publichears about these branches, they have a veneer of respectability. Dr. WynnWestcott, a famous Satanist and the Supreme Magus of S.R.I.A. wrote the rarebook History of The Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. IX. It was privatelyprinted by these Masonic Rosicrucians on Dec. 30, 1900, and later received theBr. Museum Press Mark of 0475 h54. Within this rare book the leader of theS.R.I.A. spells out the purpose of the organization to the Brotherhood, \"The aimof the Society...searching out the secrets of Nature; to facilitate the study ofthe system of philosophy founded upon the Cabala and the doctrines of HermesTrismegistus ...\" Hermes Trismegistus (as many of you know) means \"the tricegreatest Hermes\" who was the Egyptian scribe god who is claimed to be the authorof all magical writing. Hermes is credited for the grossly evilSatanic-witchcraft rituals that the ancient Egyptians and modern Satanismcontinue to practice. For an excellent exposé of the connections between theEgyptian Book of the Dead, Masonic Rituals and modern Satanism, I suggest DavidCarrico’s book The Masonic Egyptian Satanic Connection. (obtainable fromFollowers of Jesus Christ, 5220 Ashley Dr., Evansville, IN 47711). As I was justwriting, a number of branches of the Illuminati were created with the samepattern as the Bavarian Illuminati, and these branches sometimes refer tothemselves as Illuminati-and rightly so since they are integral part ofSatanism. One branch has been set up within .Freemasonry called Societas Rosicruciana. They call themselves Rosicruciana andChristians. How they attach the name of Christ to Satanism, is beyond myimagination. Perhaps the \"Christ consciousness they seek justifies in theirminds calling themselves \"exclusively Christian.\" Whatever they want to coilthemselves they practice magic and Satanism.A number of daughter organizations have sprung up from the S.R.I.A. such as theGolden Dawn, the Stella Matutina and the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). TheS.R.I.A. also worked closely with German Illuminism and the TheosophicalSociety. In England the Societas Rosicruciana (S.R.) is named S.R. in Anglia, inScotland it is S.R. in Scotia, in Greece it is S.R. in Graecia, in Canada it isS.R. in Canada, and in the US. it is S.R. in Civitatibus Foederatis. Themembership is very exclusive. And my understanding that there are about a dozenUS. lodges called \"colleges\" with about 40 members each, which lends me to guessthey have an exclusive membership of about 500 in the United States. Membershipin Societas Rosicruciana has included such notable Satanists such as A.L Waite,Eliphas Levi, and Kenneth Mackenzie. It has included that Luciferian Albert Piketoo. Within a nation the arena are divided up into provinces, each of which hasa \"college\"-their fancy word for a satanic lodge. On Apr. 20, 1948 Harry W.Bundy became the chief adept of the Colorado college. Two letters by the SupremeMagus of all the S.R. groups Win. Wynn Wescott are photocopied so that thereader can read for himself from the SRIA’s Supreme Magus (lending magician)that they are connected to the Illuminati. See for yourself!! An interestingpoint in light of what I have printed in other newsletters, the Mass. college in1393 printed a book by its Supreme Magus Gould (9°) which declares that theGrand Central San of the Universe is Alcyone in the Pliades. Shades of AliceDailey, and C.T. Russell!! One of the most knowledgeable people to try to exposethe New World Order and the Satanic hierarchy behind it said, \"It remains forthe student to follow every line of enquiry to the point of concentration wherenil threads are gathered and systematically manipulated for the eventualdestruction of Christian civilization. It may lend to the B’nai B’rith, theUniversal Israelite Alliance, India or Tibet, but in any case a thorough andcomplete study of Rosicrucianism embracing a minute one of Rosicruciana inAnglia and its various branches will be a great step taken in the direction ofuncovering much of the political and moral chaos of present day history ofmankind.\" p.510) Interesting, that this expert would say this. The threads goback to 13 Top Families, and wouldn’t you know, several of their people arelenders of the S.R.I.A. including Harry W. Bundy. The Bundy family has been avery powerful family in American history which has managed to keep itself out ofthe limelight. Often the members d the Bundy’s have had power by virtue of beingadvisors to those in powerful positions. P.S.Congressman Reece, a real hero, tried to go farther and expose the connectionsbetween Hiss, the Carnegie Endowment Found., the Morgan Bank, and the rest ofthe tax-exempt foundations. The Illuminati moved mightily against Reece. Simplified Bibliography * Almanac of Famous People Census Records * National Cyclopaedia of American Biography * Sutton, Antony.

Masonic Rosicrucian Societies"},{"pageContent":" The Collins BloodlineThe next family in our series of articles on the top 13 Illuminati families isthe Collins family. The first two have been the Astor family and the Bundyfamily. The first two articles were fairly straightforward. Both the Astor andBundy families have been written about by others, and I had more information onboth families than I needed for my articles. In fact I left out worthwhiledetails in both articles in order to keep the articles to a comfortable length.In this Collins article, there will be some padding.\" In terms of research onthe Collins family from a scale from 0 to 100, I’m about at 1. There are somehard connections that will be presented and some soft connections. Joan Collinsis what I’d call a soft connection. She has associated with a long list of keyIlluminati men and at least a few known Satanists, but this is only the barestof dues that she might have anything to do with the Illuminati herself. Let megive some of the hard connections first.The following is a description of a highly secret high level Satanic meeting. Itcomes via an ex-insider who is now a Christian. If any other ex-hierarchy personis reading this, perhaps this will trigger some memories for you. Thisexperience dates to 1955. This is a meeting that is held twice yearly, and towhich the Rothschilds and all the mother families attend. The meeting is insidein a big room, and the Grande Mother on the throne was a Collins. The Collinsfamily has been kept out of the limelight because they have more occult powerthan the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers. To make money this Collins family doessomething financially, such as deal with the exchange of money. I’ve noticedthat numerous Collins have been Insurance Executives, and although I haven’texposed the connections between Insurance Companies and the NWO, there is a bookout which shows how they most insurance companies are connected and under theguidance of the NWO elite. The Grande Mother Collins dressed in black has anebony and gold moon shaped throne that she can automatically rotate by pushing apedal with her foot. Behind her sits the Grand Council with 13 members --thismight be or might not be the Grand Druid Council that you will read aboutfurther on. The difference between this council in 1955 is that it was allmales, while the council in 1978 has several women on it.. The Grande Mother, aCollins woman was thought to be in her middle 50’s at the time of this meeting,she had a deep dictatorial voice, was small in stature, and was very powerful.She was decked out on her throne with a great deal of jewelry. One of the firstthings done was to lay before her feet small gold bricks (shaped like smallbricks and made of pure gold). Two boys, who were taken to be her sons, one ofwhom was Tom Collins, (Tom was later gunned down by the Illuminati) were nearher throne. As only the most honored and powerful dared be in the vicinity ofher throne, this showed that these two Collins boys were powerful. The boyspassed out papers, which had time tables written on them of things that were tohappen. A great discussion was carried on about what had happened in the worldto bring in Satan’s One-World-Government during the last six months and what wasprepared to happen in the near future. Things that had not gone according toplan were discussed. The Ark of the Covenant was discussed, where it was hiddenin Africa, and a ritual mocking the Ark of the Covenant was held.Seven children in white were brought in from generational Satanic families andpresented before Grande Mother Collins. They laid prostrate in worship of her.She would move her scepter with a snake up and down striking the floor to showapproval of a child candidate. Then 7 other children were sacrificed for the 7approved children, one for each child, whose name would then be written with aquill using the sacrificed child’s blood. The children were given oaths. TheGrande Mother rotated her throne and faced the Council of 13 and declared(speaking in English) \"This is tomorrow’s generation, a chosen few.\" The Johnthe Baptist of the Anti-Christ put in an appearance, but the anti-Christ at thattime was not born or only a tiny baby. Was this BenjamIn Creme? The ex-insiderdidn’t learn the name of this John the Baptist forerunner of the Anti-Christ.However, the descriptions of this occult John the Baptist do match BenjamInCreme. Benjamin Creme was born in 1924, and was deeply into the occult andwitchcraft even when he was a boy. (See the official newsletter of Tara CenterEmergence, Jan 1982 Issue.) He claims that in 1959, he telepathically received amessage from his Master, a member of the [demonic] hierarchy. Creme calls thesemaster spirits simply the hierarchy, Christians know it is the demonichierarchy. Because all these things are planned out well in advance, it wouldhave been very appropriate if Creme had been at a high level planning meeting in1955. For more understanding on Creme’s Christ the reader is directed to readthe article on the Sufis in thIs newsletter. (Referring back to the gold brickslaid before the Grande Mother’s throne, there are several reasons that real goldis important to the Illuminati. Perhaps in some other article this newsletterwill go into it all. There have been massive secret gold shipments out of theUnited States and Russia. Guess who is getting it.) In my 1/1/93 newsletter thenames of many top Illuminati are given. One that could have been included isRobert Moore Collins (1867-? ) who was a member of the Pilgrims (60 of themodern equivalent of the Bavarian Illuminati.) Robert M. Collins was a reporterfor several important newspapers and worked as an editor in the Washington andNew York offices of the Associated Press. He did chiefly political work for theAssociated Press. He was the chief newsman for Reuters (Illuminati controlledpress) and the Associated Press for many stories coming out of the Orient.Although he was born in Wash., D.C., his address as an adult became Bournemouth,England. He never married. As those who investigate the Illuminati find out, theIlluminati control the press. Here was a man who helped do it for them Lastnewsletter issue (1/15/93) went into some detail about how important the SatanicSocietas Rosicruciana is in relation to the Satanic groups such as the O.T.O.,Golden Dawn, and Stella Matutina. The Societas Rosicruciana is definitely a highlevel exclusive Illuminati organization. One of the New York S.R. officers wasJames F. Collins (8°) who died Apr. 2, 1896. He was with the original set ofS.R. officers of the first High Council of the S.R. in America which hadoversight over all the S.R. colleges (lodges) in America. His position wasPresenter. (I don’t know what that officer does.) When the Canadians set up aSocietas Rosicruciana in Canada, the High Council which had oversight over allCanada included a Collins on its council, Daniel Collins, 8°. Daniel Collins hadseveral positions on the council. The highest degree is the 9°. If you’ve readthe Jan 1, 1993 newsletter or Be Wise As Serpents you have come across theGrande Druid Council, This is a high level Illuminati council. In Be Wise AsSerpents in the second section in a chapter entitled Heresy Interlocks withPower on the 8th page, I gave the names of people who were on that secret GrandeDruid Council in the Spring of 1978. Each of those people is a powerful witchand has a great deal of power in the world. Yvonne Collins was on the GrandeDruid Council. She was a traditionalist. To be a traditionalist means that sheholds the view that only those people who are born to families with satanicpower and witches in their family background can be true witches. Obviously, theCollins family has a long history of witchcraft if she holds this view.Remember, that the leading Satanists feel they have special blood, the top onesfeel they are gods. Even Grande Masters may teach their selected children theyare the god which created the children. (This last statement makes more sensewhen one learns the methods, state of mind, and beliefs of the Satanichierarchy.) Yvonne Collins would reject the idea that just anyone can become awitch of any significance by training and practice. The occult demonic powerwould not be strong enough for a convert to witchcraft. Yvonne’s occult name isLegena which means Lucifer’s bride. Legena (Yvonne Collins) who lived laVirginia, got upset with Jerry Falwell, he didn’t follow orders well enough. Shegot the Security and Exchange Commission to investigate his church, which causedthe church economic hardships. Even mainline Christian ministers are expected tofollow directives of the Grande Druid Council which is said to operate under theorders of the Rothschilds. Everyone who was high up in the Illuminati and areNOW Christians remember Tom Collins. Collins was in the Illuminati, but for somereason the Lord changed his heart and he began to talk to churches about what isreally going on. He had an itinerary of churches to speak to, of which a Baptistchurch was one. He warned what was going on. He was gunned down in a Grocerystore parking lot, and has been used as an example by the Illuminati to anyoneelse who dares utter a word. \"Remember Tom Collins,\" they warn people in thecovens.This reminds me of another incident, which happened to a brother in Olympia, WA,the capital of WA. Two weeks after Reagan was elected, a beautiful Mercedespulled up to where this Christian brother was working. The guy who got out wasobviously rich-his suit had to be in the neighborhood of $800 and his wife hadfox furs around her neck. They said their son was going to work for the stateand they wanted to look for a home for him. The woman was being Independent andsaid, \"I don’t want to go see the houses. I want to talk to this nice man.\" Thehouses were done by Donahue Construction. The men went on to look at the houses,and the woman remained behind and talked. This Christian is an easy talker withpeople. He struck up a conversion naturally. He said, \"I think it’s great RonaldReagan got elected, he’s going to be a good president.\" The woman replied, \"Wewanted George Bush to get it.\" \"Whose we?” the Christian asked to this rich ladywho kept tossing her furs back and forth. \"The Illuminati,\" she said, \"We’re theenlightened ones, and George Bush was trained by us.\" Unfortunately, the men hadjust returned at this point and were entering the room. The man with theexpensive suit was livid. \"Shut your ..... mouth!\" he yelled. She huffed back,“Well, if you insist.\" He then turned to the Christian, who he didn’t know, andpolitely told him that they had failed to find anything that suited them. \"Thankyou very much everything is secure.\" and handed him the keys. Then he draggedthe woman to the Mercedes giving her hell all the way for talking, and when theygot in proceeded to physically slap her around. This was an extremely rareincident. Many of the Satanic hierarchy live their entire lives without utteringa word to anyone anything about the hidden Satanic side of their lives. As arule they find very respectable cover lives in society--the more respectable thebetter- to cover their hidden lives. The Satanic rituals are always memorized.You will not walk into these people’s houses and find incriminating books orobjects. Remember Ted Bundy in last issue’s article. Ted was exactly the modelof how many top Illuminati are. They are capable of the most horrendous things,but to everyone who knows them, they are the most likable, intelligent normalpeople. People who knew Ted Bundy had no idea what he was doing in secret. TheSatanic hierarchy and their Satanism is clearly the most secret religion in theworld. They are a priesthood that rules the world through political leaders thatthey place in power. And because of their power, they have the ability tosuppress a great deal of the publicity that could arise from their numerousactivities. To describe the security methods employed to keep high levelSatanism secret could take an entire book. Let’s just put it this way, if youwere a billionaire, which several of the leading Olympians (King Illuminati)are, what kind of security could you afford? And what kind of clout would youhave with national governments and police forces to get even governments toprovide security for you? Remember these people own the press, and the media.They will kill, or discredit anyone who exposes them. Don’t be surprised if bothof these happen to me, the author. Just know this--they can kill the body theycannot kill the soul. Our Christian God reigns. They also control the CIA andFBI. (See Be Wise As Serpents for more details on this.) Many leading FBI agentshave not only been Masons, but many have been Satanists. The FBI sends outreports which paraphrased go like this, \"Far more crime has been committed byzealots in the name of God than has ever been committed in the name of Satan.The actual involvement of the occult in a criminal case usually turns out to besecondary, insignificant, or nonexistent. The law enforcement perspective onoccult crime requires avoiding the paranoia that has crept into this issue.Unless hard evidence is obtained and corroborated, police officers should avoidbeing frightened into believing that Satanists are performing criminalceremonies requiring investigation. An unjustified crusade against such activitycould result in wasted resources, unwanted damage to reputations, and disruptionof civil liberties.\" (This type of thing is hilarious to hear from the FBI, forthose who know how they have trampled on every civil liberty by investigatingtens of thousands of organizations simply because they opposed the establishmentand ruined the reputations of many people- Martin Luther King for instance.People who have read my book may have picked up that J. Edgar Hoover was a 32°Mason, homosexual, and worked intimately with the Illuminati.) For those whohaven’t come out of Satanism, one way to explain to people how Satanic secrecyfunctions is to compare these Satanic families with the Mafia families.Individuals in these families learn what they need to know, no more. The topbosses have cover jobs, and give their orders orally. (Actually the comparisonbetween Mafia or Costa Nostra families and Moriah or Illuminati families isquite fitting because they tie in organizationally and were created by the sameoccult stream of secret societies that Satan has been running.) Don’t expect tofind what you are reading here about the Collins family- that they are one ofthe very top illuminati families even more powerful than the Rothschilds-anywhere else. People are getting the inside story for the first time. I amgrateful for various ex-insiders giving me accounts of secret meetings. Exceptfor the testimony of eye-witnesses, there is little evidence of what happens athierarchy meetings. There are numerous clues, but they are rejected by mostpeople who refuse to accept that the Satanic hierarchy exists. Before the 1960s,and the space programs man had not seen the far side of the moon. But thatdidn’t mean it wasn’t there. The hierarchy are professionals at Satanism and arereally pros at obtaining satanic power through ritual, deeds and worldly power.Their activities are very secret. In contrast there is great deal of physicalevidence from the coven levels (the lowest level) that periodicallysurfaces-robes, candies made of fat, anthems, altars, dead animals, ritualsites, etc. The higher levels believe that the force must be balanced-one’s gooddeeds mast match one’s evil deeds. Consequently some of the greatestphilanthropists are leading Satanists. The lower levels are not concerned withdeveloping power such as what Satan has, they simply enjoy being evil, and inthat respect are rather crude in their exercise of evil.The Collins family hasn’t received much attention. Who do you think of when youthink of the Collins? Joan Collins? She was a beautiful, Jewish Hollywoodactress from England. Joan’s grandmother lived at Brighton, England. (Joanmentions her father being a Jew on pg. 13 of her autobiography Joan Collins PastImperfect.) Her father Joe Collins and his friend Lord Lew Grade had an actingcompany. Joe Collin’s father Will Collins and his wife a can-can dancerHenrietta Collins were also into acting. In the 1970s she was in several horrormovies and picked up the title \"Queen of the Horror Films\" (p. 271). In 1977 and1978 Joan was nude in two sexy films (not her first) which were expected to dobetter at the box office than they did, neither of the titles of these filmsbear repeating.One was based on a sexy book Joan’s sister wrote that was a best-seller inEngland. Joan was the first \"old\" woman to be in the buff in Playboy (the Dec'83 Playboy). The issue is a collector’s item. In her 40s, she was still posingin the buff. Which according to her autobiography she feels comfortable doing.(I wonder if being exceptionally beautiful and a sex idol for millions makes iteasier to pose nude.) For those who watch Dynasty, you’ll likely remember her.For those who watched Hansel and Gretel, Joan was the witch. She was the womanin film The Devil Within Her. In Dec., 1982 Joan was asked to be the mistress ofceremonies at Prince Albert Hall before the Queen and His Royal Highness PrincePhillips. Besides knowing that she is into astrology, after looking at herautobiography I don’t pick up a hint of any religiousness. Besides her amazingbeauty, her lack of morals made her a perfect fit for Hollywood. Among her manyfriends, she had Sammy Davis, Jr. (p. 332) and Jayne Mansfield as friends oracquaintances, both of whom are publicly known to he Satanists. She rubbedshoulders with Henry Kissinger (p.3454 of Autobio.) Joan Collins vacationed inthe winter at St. Moritz, which is an exclusive ski resort of the internationalset where Joan rubbed shoulders with Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis. (These -are Kings within the Illuminati.) Joan Collins spent time with Edgar Bronfman.The Bronfman family are the Jewish Illuminati family that runs Canada. (p.281-282) Joan Collins may not be part of the Illuminati Collins family, but ifshe isn’t she has at least associated with some of the top Illuminati. Joan wasmarried several times but obviously preferred her maiden name. Another famousCollins is Michael Collins who was one of the three astronauts on the Apollo II.Apollo 11 was the first officially announced visit by man to the moon. For thosewho have read Be Wise As Serpents you are aware that the first flag on the moonwas the Scottish Rite’s flag.There are a number of very strange things about the flight, and about what NASAhas been doing. Bun Aldrin is a Freemason. Neil Armstrong has gone intoseclusion, shunning any publicity. As Michael Collins puts it, Nell has \"droppedout and doesn’t sell the NASA program.\" (Carrying the Fire, by Michael Collins,p. 461--The title to his book is based on Greek mythology. The god Apollocarried fire, which is what Michael felt described Apollo 11.) What ourgovernment has been doing with NASA, flying saucers and a manned lunar base, isbeyond writing about in this article, But the question did naturally come to mymind, could Michael Collins be related to the Illuminati Collins family? MichaelCollins writes about himself, \"Fortunately, I have been a poor student all mylife, and my parents, concealing their disappointment, seldom pushed me.’(Carrying the Fire, p. 462) It certainly seems like such a student would needsome pull to get into West Point, USMA. Michael Collins also sits on the boardof directors of the Illuminati’s Rand Corporation which works with TavistockInstitute. He is not even a nominal Christian as far as I can tell, he statesdryly that \"no\" he \"did not find God\" when he went to the moon. It looked likethe clues were leading in the direction that he might be part of the elite, whenI can across one sentence that changed my mind. Michael Collins wrote, \"I feel just as thankful today that I live in the UnitedStates of America as I did before flying in space, and I have no desire for thiscountry to merge into a United States of the World.’ (p.470 of his book. By theway Michael Collins wrote his own book in contrast with so many of the,,Christian\" authors like Pat Robertson’s New World Order, and some of BillyGraham’s books which are written by others with the big name tacked on to sellit.) If anyone could promote internationalism (One-World-Govt.) without anysuspicion it would be Michael Collins, for few men share his experience ofseeing the tiny earth in the vastness of the hostile universe. And yet hedoesn’t, he simply advocates that humans learn to cooperate to solve ourproblems- which we certainly need to do. Michael Collins has some reallyinteresting and in a sense inspiring things to say about what seeing the earthfrom way out in space meant to his life. What he writes bears repeating. I don’thave the space for it all but will share one idea that is novel, \"Seeing theearth from a distance has changed my perception of the solar system as well.Ever since Copernicus’ theory (that the earth was a satellite of the sun,instead of vice versa) gained wide acceptance, men have considered it anirrefutable truth; yet I submit that we still cling emotionally to thepre-Copernican, or Ptolemaic, notion that the earth is the center of everything.The sun comes up at dawn and goes down at dusk, right? Or as the radiocommercial describes sunset: \"When the sun just goes away from the sky...\"Baloney! The sun doesn’t rise or fall: it doesn’t move, it just sits there, andwe rotate in front of it, while dusk means we have turned another 180 degreesand are being carried into the shadow zone. The sun never \"goes away from thesky.\" It’s still there sharing the same sky with us; it’s simply that there is achunk of opaque earth between us and the sun which prevents our seeing it.Everyone knows that, but I really see it now.\" (pp. 472-73) (I like MichaelCollins. What I just quoted is neat. After reading lots of occult garbage, Ireally appreciate someone who isn’t into emphasizing the sun. If Michael were anoccultist he would not have made this statement. In fact, I think it would behealthy for Christians to quit looking at the stars, and realize how wonderfulGod’s green earth is. Praise His holy name! The earth is a very unique wonderfulmarvelous place. And all these people who use their imaginations and belittlethe Earth because they think some other planet in another galaxy is better,should do some space travel. The earth is a miracle, and anyone who doesn’t seeGod through His creation is not thinking straight.) Back to the question, isMichael’s Collins family part of the Illuminati Collins family? I have no idea,butMichael himself is not an internationalist. The Collins family is an old NewEngland family. Early members of it were Francis, Edward and John. (See thegenealogical chart.) Part of the Satanic branch may live in England too. Likemost top Illuminati families, the Collins have spread al over - so that even theWest Coast has some members of this satanic bloodline. Part of the family isboth related to aristocracy and to witchcraft. For instance, I have a completelist of all people accused of witchcraft in New England in the 17th centurywhich includes some Collins, The 17th century was the first century that Britishsettlers, mostly Puritans, some of whom are also known as Pilgrims andCongregationalists settled in New England. In 1640 in Aquiday, Mass. a Collinswas accused of witchcraft. In 1653, Jane Collins was accused of witchcraft inLynn, Mass. And a Collins family lived in the Salem, Mass. area of Marbleheadduring the 1650s when the witch trials occurred.They were neighbors to the family accused of witchcraft. Interestingly some ofthe last names of other people accused of witchcraft in early colonialMassachusetts include Young, Bailey, Carrington, Godfrey, Hall, Brown andClinton. You will find all of these last names on people today who are connectedto the Satanic hierarchy (Illuminati) and Satanism. However, the worst exampleof dealing with \"witchcraft\", the Salem Witch trials, was instigated by theCollins family to destroy Christians. Christians have been held accountable forsomething the Collins family did to Christians in Salem, Mass. My opinion isthat the Collins family practiced witchcraft before coming to New England in the17th century. One ex-Illuminati member who was from the Collins bloodline statedthat the Collins family brought witchcraft from England to America. For thefirst part of the 1700s, one of the British Collins was prominent for his bookspromoting Deism against Christianity. As an example of some of theiraristocratic ties, Arthur Collin’s 9 volume reference work Collin’s Peerage ofEngland published in 1812 was a definitive work on aristocratic peerage.Obviously, Arthur Collins had a great deal of clout to be able to research sucha massive work on people of significance in England. The Collins family gave usJohn Collins, third Governor of Rhode Island. John Collins was born to the richpowerful part of the Collins family at Newport, R.I. John Coliins (1717-1795)played an important part in the creation of our Federal government, and a rolein one of the most remarkable court cases Trevett vs. Weeden which set theprecedence in court which allowed courts to declare legislative enactmentsunconstitutional. He advocated the issuance of paper currency and a strongcentral government, which made him unpopular in the rural areas of Rhode Island.He married Mary Avery. Another John Collins (1775-1822) born to a well-to-doCollins family was tenth governor of Delaware (1819-1822).Quite a number of Collins have been well-to-do. The wealthiest Collins that Ihave discovered so far is Matthew Garrett Collins (1874-1925). Matthew GarrettCollins was an oil producer. His father was Oliver Cromwell Collins! named afterOliver Cromwell. Oliver Cromwell was the early Mason who was paid off by theAmsterdam Jews to allow the Jews back into England. Matthew Garrett Collins wasa Mason. M.G. Collins manufactured silk and in ten years took the operation in1886 from nothing to a $2 million business. He was president of InterstateGasoline Co. He worked with several other big oil men, such as Gov. CharlesHaskell of Oklahoma. He was Trustee for Drew Seminary. He participated in theMethodist church. Matthew Garrett Collins oil operations and friendship with thegovernor of Oklahoma are very significant. Inside information indicates sometype of connection between the Collins family and Oklahoma, and Tulsa is a majorheadquarters for Satanism in that area. There are a number of buildings that theSatanists own in the Tulsa area that are used for their operations. BesidesMatthew Garrett Collins there have been a number of other wealthy Collinses,such as Theodore Clyde Collins, Jr. (Insur. co. exec., banker, pres. of etc.etc.), Arthur Fletcher Collins (real estate corp. exec., head of some financialinstitutions and an financial analyst), Henry James Collins 3rd (Insur. Co.exec., treasurer of several financial organizations), J. Barclay Collins 2nd(oil co. exec., lawyer, bd. dir. of trustee of a hospital), Leroy Collins, Jr.(banker, dir. or president of some organizations), John Roger Collins (aerospaceco. exec., banker, economist, trustee or bd. of dir. & v.p. of a number oforganizations), John Paul Collins (banker, dir. of Rothschild’s CiticorpResearch Corp., plus trustee of a hospital, besides holding other leadingpositions in a number of other organizations.) And finally Michael James Collins(not the astronaut) who has been an investment co. exec, plus to name a fewitems-- pres. Fidelity Union Life Ins., pres. Allianz Investment Corp., pres.Collins Capital, Dallas, Trustee KERA-TV, bd. dir. & v.p, of the Carr P. CollinsFoundation. None of these men gave information concerning any churchaffiliation. With the other Collinses usually if they do have a churchaffiliation it is Episcopalian. The Collins family also built the world’sfastest nicest ocean going ships during the 1850s, for which they spared noexpense. The Collins lost a number of ships to natural sea disasters, and afterthe financial panic of 1857, the Collins got out of shipping, and directed theirattention to coal and iron. They had a home on Madison Ave., NY. One of theCollins who is clearly descended from the old New England family is the bankerAtwood Collins (1851-1926) who graduated from Yale in 1873. One line of Collinsthat were descended from the old New England family were the father and son whogave their names to several locations in Western US. Fort Collins, CO is namedafter Cal. William Oliver Collins, a descendent of Edward Collins who arrived inBoston from England in 1630. And Casper, Wyoming is named after Col. William O.Collin’s son Casper Collins. Casper Collins died fighting Indians, and so thisfamily line died out. Col. William Oliver Collins’ family was well-to-doEpiscopalians. W.O. Collins had originally gone to law school, then became aSenator, and then was made a Colonel by the Secretary of War at the outbreak ofthe Civil War. Because the U.S. troops in the far west were widely dispersed,the rank of Colonel was a very high rank to hold in the western territoriesduring the Civil War. Now this article will list a few Collins who I suspect mayhave been connected to the Illuminati in their time. These are only suspects,but interesting people at that.Clifton W. Collins--Clifton studied Saint Simon who was the Mason/Illuminatusthat started Communism in the early 19th century. Clifton wrote a book about himentitled Saint Simon.Copp Collins--Copp Collins was involved in so many political things for therepublican Presidential elections, and involved with consulting Federal agenciesand so many other government positions it is difficult to give a list of whatall he has been involved with. He also was involved with Bahrain Petroleum Co.,Ltd during the 1950s.DeWitt Clinton Collins--DeWitt Clinton Collins was born on Sept. 5, 1866 and wasnamed after DeWitt Clinton, who was assoc. with the Illuminati very early in thehistory of the United States. His father, Clinton DeWitt was also named afterDeWitt Clinton. D.C. Collins did his post-graduate work in Vienna, and practicedin Chicago.Hugh Collins--Author Marxism and the Law published by Oxford University Press.James Foster Collins--Worked for U.S. intelligence, for the United Nations,graduated from Yale, had such jobs as Research assistant U.S. Senate AtomicEnergy Commission, political affairs officer United Nations Secretariat(1946-1949), By the way a large percentage of the officers in the Secretariatarea of the United Nations for the first 10 years were Jews. Collins also workedfor the state department and the treasury department, perhaps maintaining hisintelligence work on the side.Jim Collins--Jim writes books on the occult, UFOs, mysticism, Uri Geller, etc.John Anderson Collins-- He was intimately involved with the illuminati plotsinvolving Unitarians/Rosicrucians/& Masons which created militant abolitionistswho intended to wage war against the south. He worked with William LloydGarrison. For a full expose on this the reader should study my chapter on theUnitarian church in Be Wise As Serpents. John Anderson Collins was a socialist(forerunner of what is known as communism). He attempted several communistsocial experiments beginning in the 1840s. The importance of how this allconnects to the occult and the Illuminati can be appreciated by reading Fire inThe Minds of Men by James Billington.John Churton Collins--In 1886 he wrote a book on Voltaire, and in 1908 he wroteyet another book on Voltaire. As a lecturer who travelled to the U.S. andGermany, the press always gave him great press coverage. He was involved withthe occult. He was found dead in peculiar circumstances in a ditch.Launa Collins and Virginia Collins co-authored a book Levels of Mind in 1984.Mauney D. Collins--Mauney Collins was State Superintendent of Schools inGeorgia. He went to Bob Jones College sometime after 1938. He was a Freemason, aGrand Master of the Georgia Grand Lodge of Odd Fellows, assoc. editor of the Ga.Odd Fellows News, and if my source is correct editor of Atlanta’s Masonicmagazine. He was in Eastern Star, and a number of other affiliated Masonicgroups. He lived at the Capital Building at the state capital in Georgia. He wasa pastor (ordained in 1909) of Friendship Baptist Church for his lifetime.Paul Valorous Collins--writer, studied art in Paris, interviewed Italianstrongman Benito Mussolini in 1927 for Outlook Magazine. Presbyterian and aFreemason.Robert DeVille Collins - foreign service officer, intelligence, 1st Secretary toNATO (73-76), director political officer of personnel of the US. State Dept.(80-82), worked in the U.S. embassy in Rome in various capacities, RomanCatholic, and given an award by the Pope.Ross A. Collins-- One of the ex-Illuminati members remembers the name RossCollins. Ross A. Collins was a high ranking Mason, a lawyer, an attorney general(a common position for Satanists), and a Congressman. He was born atCollinsville, Miss. in Congress at Washington, D.C. he was chairman of themilitary appropriation committee, a position which the Illuminati control. RossCollins was famous for advocating mechanized weaponry. He wanted technology tobe applied to weaponry. He is credited with bringing the Flying Fortress intobeing. By the way there have been many Collins who were Masons, for instance,the masonic reference book History of Scottish Rite Masonry in Chicago, alsotitled Oriental Consistory 1856-1907 by George Warvelle, 33°, lists twelveCollins as being members of Chicago’s Oriental Consistory (pp. 99-100).Varnum Lansing Collins-Princeton Univ. Professor and Episcopalian.Wilkie Collins-author of occult fictionWilliam Collins-his British Collins Pub. firm has printed some books on BritishIntelligence (MI-5, MI-6).I could continue giving more names on the suspect list, but the reader’spatience has likely been tested enough. Articles like this aren’t as much fun towrite, when I have to pad out some hard evidence with clues. I included some ofthe suspects so that the readers can see that people with the last name ofCollins do show up with some frequency when one investigates the occult andpower. Some readers might feel that any last name could be run through historyand some people involved in the occult found. I challenge people to test that. Iwill give them some names, and let them search. There are some names such asGould for instance that reoccur way out of proportion in Masonic literature thanthe name should randomly occur. Russell is another name that reoccurs everywhere1 turned in studying the New World Order. It became evident that the Russellfamily was not a common family, but wielded immense power. On the opposite sideof things, some families have been essentially totally unconnected with theoccult in anyway.Prior to the Civil War, the American branch of the Collins family split offunder the surname of Todd. Numerous occult figures including important names insecret Satanism or various Witchcraft groups have had the last name of Todd.Presidents Madison and Lincoln were married to Todds. Lincoln’s wife Mary Toddwas into the occult. Whether Abraham Lincoln is in heaven or not I do not know,those decisions are God Almighty. But from examining the evidence as carefullyand honestly as possible-Abraham Lincoln was a Rosicrucian and in fact he was amember of the Order of the Lily’s Council of Three along with Paschal BeverlyRandolph and General Ethan Allen Hitchcock. Properly speaking, those Todds whoare descended from the Collins family should have been covered in this, becausethey are considered by the Illuminati as part of the Collins bloodline. The Toddfamily hasn’t been covered now, but may possibly be written about more fully ata later date. In summary, the Collins family is one of the top Illuminatifamilies that has managed to remain low key. It is believed that the Collinsfamily has been kept secret because they wield more power than the Rothschilds,Rockefellers, or the Onassises. The only way that I came to realize theirimportance is through a number of people giving inside information, and the onlyreason that the inside information was plausible was the great amount ofresearch I had done in this area. And yet what has been done is a drop from whatcan be accomplished. My research shows the family has been connected towitchcraft since they arrived in New England in the 1630s, and may well havepracticed it centuries prior to that. At least part of the British Collinsfamily are Jewish.Revisiting The Collins Family--One Of The Top 13 Illuminati FamiliesThe Collins family is one of the most powerful families in the world, and yethas been able to hide their power and wealth. The Van Duyn family has alsohidden themselves very well. But the Collins family is full of tantalizingclues, such as one Collins branch that I found in looking at genealogical familygroup sheets. This was a book that Gerald E. Collins’ drew up showing theCollins family and their relationship to the Bauer family who according to hisbook changed their name to Bower. That is exactly what the Rothschild relativesnamed Bauer did. The name Collins originated in the British Isles, in Ireland itbegan as O’Collins, and in Scotland as Kollyns. Today, a prominent figure inWicca is the Wiccan reformer Kollyns, whose name was originally Collins. Twosignificant Collinses were Sara Aynn Collins and her older brother. Her olderbrother was a member of the Satanists who called themselves the Hell Fire Club.He belonged to the Boston Hell Fire Club. The Hell Fire Club has been discussedin previous newsletters. It has been pointed out in the past articles howBenjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were members of this purely Satanic groupwho practiced satanic sexual occult rituals. Sara Aynn Collins (bn. c. 1730) wasdeeply attracted to the occult. Her family was a generational Witchcraft/Satanicfamily, but many of them wanted to abandon the occult. Besides not wanting toleave the old family traditions of witchcraft, Sara did not want to marry theman her father tried to sell her to. Neither the arranged marriage nor forsakingwitchcraft was for Sara. She went to Scotland to get to the heart of learningthe occult and became a leader in the oldest form of Wicca, the Elven Path.(Other traditional types of Wicca in the U.S. come from Ireland, Wales, andGreece.) After the American Revolution she left Scotland skilled in occultpower, and came back to the United States, where she formed the first Covendomof Wicca. She and her brother were powerful Wiccans, and their descendants arethe main group of Collinses that practice Wicca and Satanism. A wild womanstabbed Sara Aynn Collins to death in a Boston store. What you have justreceived is the important link in tracing the Satanic Collins bloodline. SaraAynn Collins (and there were several Sarah Ann Collins in her day-it seems thename appealed to the Collins family) is in turn a descendent of Francis Collinsof the 17th century. Francis was the head of the family when it came over fromEngland. The Todd family seems to have Satanic undertones to it, even in thedays just after the Revolutionary War. For instance, John Jacob Astor marriedSarah Todd who had a fair amount of money attached to her. The Todd surname isnot an extremely common name-until one begins researching the conspiracy, andthen it pops up with frequency. It is known that during the time of the CivilWar the Collins bloodline went into the surnames of Todd and Putman. It needs tobe brought out here that the Putman family also has spelled their name Putnam!One genealogy book which ties the Putman/Putnam family to the Collins family isPutnam, Thomas Russell (1897). Putnam genealogy; recording the descendants ofThomas Putnam. The Be Wise As Serpents book exposed the early Clinton family ofDeWitt Clinton as an illuminati family. Interestingly, there was a Collins boyborn in 1824 who was named after that Satanist. His name was DeWitt ClintonCollins (1824-1909). Another interesting tidbit was that the Phelps family ofVirginia is related to the Collins. The Phelps family arrived in Mass. in 1630and became a prominent family in the Skull & Bones. And don’t forget men likeSkull & Bones William Collins Whitney (unit. into S&B 1863) of the Collinsfamily. This member of the Collins lineage had two sons, who both became membersof the Illuminati’s Order of the Skull & Bones. William Collins Whitney(1841-1904) and his two sons are the core of the Whitney influence in the Orderof the Skull & Bones. This Collins blood of the Whitney’s then went into theHarriman family. Anyone who has been reading this newsletter this year knows howimportant the Harrimans are! Pam Harriman is the person behind Bill Clinton.Further, the Collins blood of the Whitney’s went into the Payne family and theVanderbilts by intermarriage! The Payne family has been a big part of theRockefellers and Standard Oil. (It is a small world at the top.) William CollinsWhitney had a lack luster career as an inspector of schools. But then beginningin the 1870s, he amassed a fortune from who knows where very quickly. WilliamCollins Whitney was the power behind Pres Cleveland, who was his puppet. He alsodirected a group of powerful important capitalists called the Whitney Group.W.C. Whitney married Flora Payne. Their son Harry Payne Whitney married GertrudeVanderbilt in 1896. Their son (and remember he still has Collins blood)Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney married Marie Norton who later married W. AverellHarriman (unit. into S&B in 1913), the man who helped finance Hitler to power.The Harrimans also helped bring the Bush family from oblivion back in the early1920s. When Prescott Bush (George Bush’s father) lost all his money in the 1929stock market crash, the Harrimans again came to financially helped Prescott Bushback on his feet. During the 1920s, the W. Averell Harriman, Prescott Bush,Fritz Thyssen and Friedrich Flick created several entitles to help financeHitler and to produce the weapons Hitler would need to fight W.W. II.. One ofthese companies was the German Steel Trust (in German called VereinigteStahlwerke. This company produced 35% of Nazi Germany’s explosives, 50.8% ofGermany’s pig iron, 38.5% of Nazi Germany’s galvanized steel, 36% of Germany’sheavy plate, 22.1 % of Germany’s wire, and many other things essential forHitler, if it had not been Harriman’ and Bush’s money helping Thyssen who wasHitler’s major backer, Hitler would never had been able to have launched W.W.II. Thyssen even wrote a book in the 1930. I paid Hitler (now rare) tellingabout how he financed Hitler and the Nazis beginning in Oct. 1923. As I havesaid numerous times Hitler was of the Rothschild bloodline.An understanding of the top 13 families opens up a whole new understanding ofhistory. In fact, the full extent of the power of the top 13 families is fargreater than what I am able to communicate. This is because of their skill atsecrecy. Allow me to explain. It was no accident that Hitler’s Rothschild bloodwas hidden. A common practice among the top 13 families is to have an importantchild secretly or quietly without fanfare, and adopt the child out to anotherfamily. The child then takes on another last name, which hides the genealogy, inthe occult ceremonies, the biological parents will step forward. For instance,for Mothers of Darkness the biological father must impregnate the young daughterwho is being initiated into the Mothers of Darkness. The first baby by the girlmust come from her biological father and must be sacrificed by her to Satan.Many of the Illuminati children are adopted out, (in fact our President Clintonwas). To try and trace the genealogy of the Illuminati is most difficult. What Iam trying to lead up to saying is that due to a number of reasons-many peoplewith last names which are different than the top 12 surnames (as well as theseveral names I’ve given for the 13th bloodline) I have given are ALSO part ofthe top 13 bloodlines. Last names are not the criteria--the magical occult powerin their blood is. It is more than just having the correct blood--but the magicpower in that blood is critical. Once a branch loses its occult power its bloodis nothing. This is why even though my wife is a descendent from the Holy Bloodline, the 13th family, her branch of the family has had nothing to do with theoccult for centuries, and could never be part of Illuminati. In summary, thisarticle has given some critical names in the early genealogy of the Satanicbranch of the Collins family. This article has discussed how important events inour world are being molded by those 13 families secretly, for example theCollins family. Finally, it was discussed how the Illuminati have a number ofways that they hide their genealogies, and one of these is the common practiceof adopting out a child, so that it gets a different last name. Satanist Bonewitz calls the leading Illuminati families \"Fam-Trads.\" He spellsout that Fam-Trads mean the very powerful families that have been the actualones to pass witchcraft down from one generation to the next. Bonewitz’s articleclaims that the only coherent lineage of witchcraft was what these powerfulfamilies have given us. They were able to pass down witchcraft uninterruptedbecause they were so powerful. He writes, \"There is plenty of evidence ofancient Pagan traditions surviving under thin Christian veneers in isolatedparts of Christendom, but there is almost nothing logical to suggest that thepeople leading these traditions were in touch with each other...\" How did theleading powerful families continue to practice their witchcraft? Bonewitz’sanswer is interesting, He states,· Revisiting the Collins Family Isaac Bonewitz who sits on the Illuminati’s Grand Druid Council wrote in\"Witchcraft\" (which was a series of articles in the Green Egg in 1976) some veryinteresting statements about the top Illuminati families.Most members of Fam-Trads made efforts to conceal their \"superstitious\" beliefsand Pagan magical systems. Instead they became involved in Freemasonry andRosicrucianism in the 18th century, Spiritualism and Theosophy in the 19th; forall these movements were considered more respectable than witchcraft, and stillallowed the Fam-Trads to practice occult arts ... So as the years went by,members of the Fam-Trads absorbed more and more from non-pagan magical sourcesand handed their new information down to each generation, often carelesslyletting the descendants think that a Rosicrucian spell or alchemical meditationwas a legitimate part of their Pagan heritage. So even today we have Fam-Tradwitches who are far closer to being Theosophists or Spiritualists than to beingClassical or Neoclassical witches. (Bonewitz, Isaac. \"Witchcraft\", The GreenEgg, June 21, 1976, Pt. III pp. 5-6.)In 1770, Lord Petre, Grand Master in the Masonic Lodges in the British coloniesappointed John Collins to be the Provincial Grand Master of Quebec. (Co-authoredby a board of Masonic editors, History of the Ancient and Honorable Fraternityof Free and Accepted Masons & Concordant Orders. Boston & NY: The FraternityPub. Co., 1891, p. 225.) I mention John Collins as an example of a powerful 18thcentury Freemason, who was part of what appears to be the Collins Illuminatifamily. In previous articles, we have documented how the early 18th centuryAstors and DuPonts were active Freemasons. The history of these top familiesdoes agree with Bonewitz that in order to continue to practice their witchcraftthey used the cover of Freemasonry. Later, in the 19th century some of theleading families can be seen to have moved into Spiritualism, such as theBritish royal family, and Mary Baker Eddy of the Baker family. Interestingly,H.P. Blavatsky who was involved with spiritism started the Theosophical Societyand also a periodical named Lucifer in 1887. The woman who co-edited Luciferwith her was the medium (now called a channeler) Mabel Collins. Mabel Collinslater had a disagreement with H.P.B. and left. (Oppenheim, Janet. The OtherWorld. Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge Univ. Press, p.182.) And it is possible that afew of the Rockefellers joined Lucis Trust which is an extension of Theosophy awell as members of the Hall family such as Manly P. Hall whose wife was a Bauer(very likely part of the Rothschild bloodline.) This pattern that Bonewitz haspointed out to us, is worthy of continued investigation, it is likely that otherleading families have also followed the pattern he describes. The 13 topIlluminati families are more correctly described as 13 bloodlines. The Collinsfamily had a branch that shot off from it during the early 1800s which was theTodd family. The Todd family branch remained an important part of theIlluminati. We will now discuss this branch in more detail as I said I might inthe Feb. 1, ‘93 newsletter “The Todd Branch of The Collins Family.”Hot Toddy & Her Father John ToddThelma Todd was known as “Hot Toddy.” She was an extremely sexy movie actress,but she also had another side to her. She was intimately involved with the mob,and men like Lucky Luciano. Hot Toddy was intimate with Lucky Luciano, who mademoney from gambling, drugs, and prostitution. In 1935, she was murdered. Themurderer left her corpse with $20,000 in jewelry on it. In 1989, the book HotToddy by Andy Edmonds solves the murder, which the police did not want to solveand tried to cover up. Thelma was originally from 592 Andover St, Lawrence,Mass. Her father was John Shaw Todd and her mother Alice. Her father had been acorrupted police lieutenant before going into politics. John’s cronies wouldcome over to their house to the parlor. By 1915, John Todd became \"one of themost important men in the East. He was appointed Massachusetts director ofpublic health and welfare, a job that gave him carte blanche to write checks andapprove construction and medical contracts, offer political positions onhigh-paying state committees (most as repayment for favors), and pass fundingalong to handpicked organizations and charities. Many believed he lined hispockets on more than one appointment or contract.\" (Edmonds, Andy. Hot Toddy.NY: William Morrow & Co., p. 56.) In 1925, he became a \"political advisor\" tolegislators. In 1926, he used his influence to get good reviews in newspapers ofthe film his daughter was in. Hot Toddy had a reputation for going braless, forflirting with men etc. She as a teenager had a secret desire to be a madam at abrothel. (p.60) She was sponsored by the Elks Lodge in a beauty contest in 1925and was selected Miss Massachusetts. Hollywood even in the early 1920s was fullof murders, the weirdest sexual habits imaginable, and most of the actors weredrug addicts (cocaine, heroin, and booze). That was years before these habitshit the mainstream of American life. Many actors were homosexual. Many if notmost (the lists I have seen would indicate most) actors were Jewish. CharlesLuciano was nicknamed Charile Lucifer, \"the devil.\" He was the most feared andhated of the underworld bosses. Luciano liked Toddy both because he wasattracted to her and she had a restaurant he wanted to use for one of his basesof operations on the third floor for gambling. Luciano was one of the threemajor distributors for the Bronfman’s narcotics. The Bronfmans are outwardlyJewish and covertly Satanists. Remember they were mentioned in the previousCollins article being friends of actor Joan Collins. Rothstein and Meyer Lanskywere the other two Bronfman distributors. (Dope, Inc., p. 431) Luciano suppliedHot Toddy with her drugs. At the time of her murder, her movie boss had plannedto raise her salary to $3,500 a week. Luciano worked for the U.S. governmentduring W.W. II, and in 1946 was deported to Sicily. During W.W.II Luciano workfor US. Intelligence--SOE and OSS. (Where else in this newsletter have Imentioned the corruption in the Intelligence Agencies?) After being \"deported\"to Sicily, Luciano continued to work for US. Intelligence and Permindex (Dope.Inc., p. 483)-which is the elite’s assassination bureau which later moved thecenter of its headquarters to Paradise Island in the Grand Bahamas. (Dope, Inc.,p.493) (It seems to me that Luciano had connections to Onassis.) I noticed thatthere was a man named Collins who was involved with the Illuminati’s movementsto take over the Australian economy. He was an executive of H.W. Smith, one ofthose companies that interlock with the CIA, mob, and Illuminati. As you mayrealize, I offer these types of clues because I can’t presume on the future andhope that others will assist in putting together the pieces of how widespreadthe satanic Collins family is.Johnny Todd Johnny Todd is reported to have converted to Christ on Labor Day, 1972 accordingto one person I talked to. It seemed like the talk I heard Johnny Todd giveindicated 1973 as his conversion date. He was of the Collins family Todds and atsome point after coming to Christ, told people he had been a member of the GrandDruid Council of the Illuminati. Before proceeding to tell about his life letsinterrupt to discuss about whether Johnny Todd is for real or not. Johnny Toddhas been discredited as a fraud within much of the Christian community. If I hadheard all the negative things said about Johnny Todd first, I might not bewriting anything about him, because some of the people against him don’t haveanything good to say. However, I heard tapes of Johnny Todd speak before I heardthe negative things about him. What has taken me years to understand, he wentitem by item and discussed. I have tried to understand what Johnny Todd did toget discredited, and the central issue seems that a tape he made after he wasconverted had his voice saying a satanic ritual. I must warn the readers that Ihaven’t gotten to the bottom of who Johnny Todd is, but I was able to ascertainseveral things. * Even the people who feel Johnny Todd was a fraud admit he had to have been in Satanism-they simply claim he wasn’t as high as he thought. * Every negative thing that has been said toward Johnny Todd that has any substance that I have been able to hear can be explained away very easily if a person understand MPD.If Johnny Todd was who he claimed he was, then it is an absolute given that hehad MPD, because that is part of the \"training\", part of the preparationnecessary to become part of the Illuminati hierarchy. In other words, thenegative things which appear to be insurmountable obstacles to his credibilitymay actually if people knew what being involved with the Illuminati is like, andinstead be items showing his authenticity. Further, it appears that after hisconversion to Christ, he received so much lack of understanding and persecutionfrom Christians that he back slide for a period of time, but was brought back toChrist by the repeated message \"Jesus loves you.\" The clincher was listening tothe man. After having done years of research and hearing someone tell me much ofwhat I learned the slow and hard way, was very exciting. The man speaks likesomeone who knows Satanism and the Satanic hierarchy, and knows it firsthand. Ihave listened to many Christians speak on Satanism, and on a scale of 0 to 100most of them are about step 1 Todd in my opinion, from the talks I have heardrates around an 80. If he is such a fraud, why is what he is saying suchsuperior information than all the other people? People claim he simply borrowedfrom other people, but that doesn’t hold water. I know of no one else who hasopenly talked about the Collins family. I could be wrong--he may not belegitimate--but I feel so strongly from what I have experienced that I honestlybelieve that the man is just what he says he is. And in that case, he is one ofthe highest Satanic hierarchy people to defect to Christianity who have beenwilling to talk. Johnny Todd is not talking now-the establishment got him putinto prison in South Carolina.Ex-Illuminatus Explains How the Illuminati Framed Him and Put Him in Prison.This article is comes from a tape which was made by someone who is part of theCollins Bloodline, one of the top 13 Illuminati bloodlines. I transcribed thistape onto paper, because I feel it deals with an important person and someimportant issues. Christians need to realize that what happened to this man wholeft and tried to expose the illuminati, is what is in store for many otherChristians, that is prison. The Be Wise As Serpents book had an entire chapteron the Concentration camps that are already built for Christians. There arefriends of mine who feel very convinced this ex-illuminatus is the real thing,and that he was really part of the Illuminati. Then, there are some who feed heis not for real. There has been an intense program of discrediting this manwhich was orchestrated by the illuminati and their plants within the Christianpeople. I have listened to both sides of the issue, and then listened to the manhimself, and I am convinced he is for real. I believe he was really part of theilluminati. That was this author’s conclusion, although I’m not so firm that Iwouldn’t bend if new evidence confirmed differently. I have listened to hours ofaccusations that were leveled against this ex-Illuminatus even before he wasframed, and most if not all amount to nothing. When I have asked people whattheir objections were to this man, they have said they are convinced he is was aSatanist, but that they doubt his illuminati credentials. But the man is part ofone of the most powerful bloodlines in the world, the Collins family. Whether hegot high in Illuminati can be debated, but if he were in Satanism, which manyacknowledge, he would have--almost certainly-- been taken into an Illuminaticoven.Message From a Hierarchy SurvivorFeb. 26, 1991 “I am John Todd, and this tape is being made in a prison cell in South Carolina,it is very late at night. All the inmates are locked down in their cells, butyou will still hear noise off and on. And if the guard comes by, I have to stopand be very quiet. The reason for this tape is that I have been framed and putin prison by orders of U.S. Senator from South Carolina Strom Thurmond. I’ll gointo all the reasons for that, and what happened to me. And only recently, infact just about a week and a half ago did I find out how it was reallyaccomplished. As I started to say, the reason for this tape is to get the wordout about where I’m at. I’ve been in custody almost four years now. I’ve been ina prison cell for three years, and that time is a very closely guarded secret bythe government, by the Illuminati and definitely by the conspirators. The wordof what has happened to me has not gotten out of the state of South Carolina.Here you have religious magazines that are run by the Illuminati, speakers whoare members within their organization, or collaborators who have been bought bythem over the years. Many of them who would consider themselves to be personalenemies of mine because of exposes which came out about them by me in the ‘70s-early ‘80s. Yet, not one of them has said a word, although they al know about itfor fear that the true believers that are out there will find out what hashappened to me. When I was arrested, one of the few things that was taken frommy apartment was my files containing my mailing list. These were taken by thepolice although they had nothing to do with the case I was supposedly beingcharged with. And two years later when we went through a law suit to geteverything back, this was one of the few items that did not come back. They justvanished, just disappeared. The reason for it was the reason for taking the twopersonal address books that I had. One I carried in my billfold for such anemergency and one was in my library shelf were taken by SLED also. This washopefully to keep me from contact with anybody who could help me obtain legalservices or whatever. I want to go into the case very carefully, verydiligently. One of the things that seems to be very frightening to Christians isthat such a thing could actually take place. Many who knew I was innocent couldnot believe that I had been found guilty. Not so much that -because-, it justwasn’t there, it didn’t take place, so therefore even the manufactured evidencewasn’t even there. They just couldn’t believe that a child of God in thiscountry could go to prison. (I had stopped and came to the door. I can’t letthis tape be known that it is being made or it would never get out of here.) Iwant to say this now before I go on, whoever receives a copy of this tape I’masking you to make a copy or copies and get the word out. Make phone calls. Letpeople know what has happened to me. Let them know that they can be of serviceto get me out of here. This is what is most feared about putting me in here,that the word will get out. Let me tell you what all has happened here. We needto go back to 1987 in Columbia, South Carolina where I was living. I had beenhurt. I had been doing labor, construction work, carpenter work for severalyears. I had stopped speaking publicly after my divorce to the woman who hadstood beside me for years and years and years, headquarters. ‘Give me apolygraph.’ Immediately in the form of a scream, I can assure you, not astatement, the SLED agent, a Lt. Carleton Meddle, who is now a captain, who wasmade captain three days after I was convicted, over promoted- promoted overpeople in front of him, screamed out loud, ‘No, we’re not going to give you apolygraph.’ That was their stance all the way through.“I took a polygraph after my conviction. I paid for the polygraph. I - thepolygraph. But it’s not admissible in court. Now they took me—I’m going to gothrough this all so you can see. Immediately, I knew this whole thing was aframe. I wasn’t sure what they were up to1 but let it go. The solicitor said hewanted to have my apartment searched for evidence of the rape, And that he couldget a search warrant, but they would prefer that I allow them to search. ‘Well,’I said, ‘I have an attorney who is representing me in the lawsuit. He is also acriminal attorney if you allow me to call him, you allow me to ask his adviceand he says \"yes\", I will allow you to do it.’ They really didn’t have a choicein this matter. I was asking for my attorney and they were supposed to. Theytook me in the hospital downstairs to the security room. I didn’t know this atthe time, but out of the 17 arresting officers that were SLED there five werelieutenants in the room with me out of the 26 Lieutenants la the state. That’sunheard of. Plus the head solicitor. It gets better. They take me into a room.The solicitor calls my attorney. I still didn’t realize who he was or anything.He called my attorney. I spoke with my attorney. He told my attorney that if heallowed me to sign this thing. and then again he told that they didn’t have asearch warrant, which was a lie. The search warrant was limited as to what theycould have took from my apartment. They weren’t interested in anything in therape, as you will find out. They were interested in other materials, which theycould not have took under the search warrant. So they told him they will take mestraight to Jal, they will go to my apartment, and search it. I signed it. Theytook me to my apartment. They had lied to my attorney.“They proceeded to box up three 30 gallon plastic trash bags and four boxes withmaterial. Nothing, except 3 knifes- that they claimed they were trying to findthe knife which was used in the rape. I showed them where all my knifes were andsome business stationary with the publishing company. Other than that knifenothing that went out of there was used during the trial. Nothing was usedexcept what I just said. Everything else was business material, printingconcerning my past ministry, or the ministry I was involved I which was thenewsletter. The whole time I was there I was not questioned about sexual assaultas they put it, I was only asked questions about the Christian underground. Iwant to stop and explain that. There is, though some of you might find itshocking,, there is an underground n the United States, a Christian underground.It was formed over the trials in Nebraska, where Christians, pastors, ministersof the church were sent to prison. Where we started seeing non-passed laws aboutchild abuse being put into effect by the federal and state governments withoutever being passed as law. Children were being taken from their parents without achance for the parent to he allowed to speak in the trial. All it took was somechild psychologist, ‘I suspect child abuse, blah blah blah.’ We started seeinghow 90% of the people being tried were fundamentalist Christians, so anunderground was formed. It contained Christian survivalists but it containedeveryday people also. And all they wanted was where these safe houses were,where these places of refuge were, what the underground conductors who theywere. That’s all they were asking me. And yet nothing was in South Carolina, soit was out of their jurisdiction. So I knew they were asking for the federalgovernment. I was taken from there to SLED and for the first time I wasquestioned concerning the so-called rape. I realized, you would have to bearrested to understand the shock you go through, I was just numb. But as my headstarted clearing and I realized that they held in their hands evidence that theyhad took from the apartment which would clear me, I told them. I also told themabout my whereabouts that night. I told them people they could go question. Andhere’s their statement, ‘It is not our job to go question witnesses that willprove your innocence.’ While I was at SLED headquarters the solicitor who hadleft us after we had left the apartment went and held a press conference. Thiswas his story: I was arrested for one rape, I was suspected in three maybe, asmany as eighty. That’s right. Family members on their way home from work at fivethirty in the evening were hearing this on the radio. Never before was anybodythat wasn’t a murderer ever given this much publicity and never before in thehistory of SLED had a person who was charged only with criminal sexual assaultever been investigated or charged by SLED. Before I was even booked in the jail,I realized that these folks did not believe I was guilty. They were onlyinterested in something else. I wasn’t sure quite yet what. The next morning Iwas brought before a state magistrate for a ball hearing and to be arraigned. Iwas denied bail on the following. Now listen to this. The solicitor tells themagistrate the following, I’m not a resident of South Carolina. BUt he had justsearched my apartment. I had several businesses in South Carolina and had livedhere for years. Further, they said I had no residence in South Carolina. And yetthey had just searched it. Three, they said I had a passport and they wereworried I’d flee the country. The passport had been taken from my apartment andhad expired on that very day on my birthday of 1967 and they knew it. The nextstatement was that I had no visible means of support. And yet they knew that Idid. And the last one was that I had no family members in South Carolina, andyet, I had children right here. As I tried to tell the magistrate this was allincorrect he wouldn’t hear it. I had not yet realized that I was on the frontcover of the state newspaper. Now the state newspaper is the newspaper inColumbia. It had a co-owned newspaper called The Record which does not existnow. They have combined them. The newspapers print whatever the authorities wantthem to print in this state. The interesting thing in this was that it startedto go into my military record. Now the Illuminati and collaborators in theChristian church have bled to discredit me for years. Mainly they have said thatI have lied about my participation in the military, what I was involved in, thatI was in Vietnam, or any of this. During the next several days, the state becamevery upset at the U. S. military because the US. Military said I was involved ina military group in Vietnam called Phoenix and that all members who were inPhoenix their military records were sealed and in Langley, VA. with the CIA.That is what I have said for years and years and years. And after all this,thousands and thousands of dollars paid to the collaborators within theChristian Church to Illuminati collaborators and plants have put out about me.This newspaper, which was trying to harm me, destroyed it in a matter of days. Ibecame known as the survivalist rapist or the green beret rapist and it all cameout about me being ex-special forces green beret. All this stuff denied byChristianity Today, and Logos and all these others for over a year was justblown away in a matter of moments. Over the next two weeks, it went from I wassuspected of 80 rapes to 100 rapes. Every day the solicitor was holding a newsconference. Every day I was smeared in the news. In fact when they realized thateither what they could frame me of, was falling apart on them they proceeded totake my picture and put it on the television. ‘We know he has done all thiswould anybody who has been followed by this man please come forward.’ Theybroadcast my picture all over the state. And I imagine-I was told- hundreds ofcrank calls but nothing ever came out because nothing had ever happened. And theproblem was, and we’re only guessing here, is the solicitor had been tricked bySLED. The solicitor really believed this. And he thought it was a high publicitycase and it blew up on him and he was embarrassed. But he was being asked, weuncovered this. This is how it went before my arrest. And I think you will besurprised by the lies [?or irony?] in all this. SLED took statements from MerylBlackburn 2:30 a.m. Sunday morning 17th -I’m sorry - May 18th Mondaymorning--(I’m sorry.) It was actually Monday morning May 18th at 2:30 in themorning. They arrested me at 3:30 in the afternoon. After taking statements, aclose friend of Strom Thurmond who was sexually involved with the woman, who wasall these women’s bosses, came down to SLED headquarters went with them tosolicitor James Anders office, and told Anders he wanted me sent to prison; hedidn’t care how. He then went to the state magistrate and got a warrant signed.This politician, who lived hundreds of miles away, came down here for thatprecise purpose and was involved. His name was Larry Martin. Now the reason thatStrom Thurmond hated me, in case you’re familiar or not familiar with this, isthat when I was living in California working with Chick publications andpreaching very heavily in ‘87 and doing mostly exposes on everybody it had comeout about Strom Thurmond being the highest ranking Mason in the world, and thathe was also a member of the voting Board of Regents for the Bob JonesUniversity. Now the first thing that Bob Jones University did was to deny thatThurmond was a Mason. But Thurmond wouldn’t go along with it. He knew he was toowell known as being a Mason. So he came out and tried to defend Masonic beliefsthat Christians can be that. It blew up on him. And he became so outraged thateven though Bob Jones University was always calling me a liar, constantlycalling me a liar, constantly trying to hurt me; they had to ask him to stepdown. lie was not removed. He was only placed to the non-voting board ofregents, and., believe me, he still had all of his power. At that Lime, I wastold he [Thurmond] is going to get you for this. I made a major mistake. Ididn’t pray about this. I met, and I let people supposedly Christian people talkme into moving to South Carolina. These were the first people to desert me whenall this happened.“Now the interesting thing about this was all through this the only thing theyhad was this woman’s statement. And it came out that woman had first went to thesheriff’s department and the sheriff would not believe her because it had been--she was talking about so far back that she admitted on the stand that she neverhad told anybody, that she had never sought medical help. There were some thingsthat I don’t want to testify- I don’t want to say on this tape because it mightoffend people but things she described that night would have required her toreceive emergency treatment in order to stay alive if it had really taken place,and yet she said she was not hurt, not damaged, was not bruised. She was notcut. She was not harmed in any way.“The situation was this, I was held for nine months in custody awaiting trial.The speedy trial law here was totally disregarded by the judge. The reason I washeld so long is this woman moved out of state didn’t want to come back to thestate. It was not- I believe this- it was not really a conspiracy in thebeginning. This was a woman who wanted revenge for being fired. When it got outof hand she didn’t know who she was dealing with. When it had gotten out of handand become so publicized and she saw all these people running around tryingdesperately to do me in, she ran away. See what happened was that when she wentto SLED, they typed my name into the computer that they have there. They havewhat they call a black list, a hit list that the politicians in South Carolinaput people on. When my name popped up it became a field day and it just becametoo much for her, and she left, and they had to force her to come back. Nowwhether she was honest with them or whether they really knew what had happenedor what I do know. But they completely changed her appearance for the trial.They dyed her hair, they put her in different clothes, and they restyled and cuther hair so that this was how much she changed. I had only seen her a coupletimes, but when she came into the trial I kept asking my attorney when MerylBlackburn was going to he there. I did not recognize her. That’s how much shehad changed. And so people who would have seen her that night which were alibiwitnesses of mine would not have been able to perfectly identify her was theplan. And the reason for this is that there were witnesses who could havedestroyed her testimony. But most important is lab tests that I happen to knowthe Lord was behind. I checked into the hospital within six or seven hours fromwhen she claims this had taken place. It was supposed to have taken placeMother’s Day weekend of '87 and like in the wee hours of Saturday morning. AndSaturday afternoon around lunchtime I was checking in to the hospital. The teston admittance was this test for alcohol and drugs. Now this woman didn’t knowthat. SLED and the prosecution didn’t know that. And this woman claimed in heraffidavit that I had forced her to drink and to take drugs and that I wasdrinking and taking drugs along with her. The urine analysis totally proved herto be lying; there were no drugs or alcohol in my system. And yet, and let mesay that (O.K.), finally it was brought to trial Jan. 21 which was a Thursday of1988. The jury was selected. A week before I was to go to trial I had all thefunds that I had left I settled my law suit out of court, which was to be$120,000. I settled it out for $10,000 and gave it to my attorney who wassupposed to spend it all on a private investigator. This private investigatorwas an ex-SLED agent. Supposedly, he tracked down all the witnesses I had toldhim there was enough evidence for, all this time I sat there and I knew I wasgoing to be found innocent. I knew I was innocent. I knew the evidence was thereto prove it. And the lawyer came and told me they had the lab tests. That theywent before the judge and argued against the solicitor and got lab testsadmitted into evidence and it was going to be there. He had drawn as he put it32 witness’s subpoenas and had served most of them, and was going to have thewitnesses there and it was going to be an open show. And so all day of the 21stI watched the trial not worried, and yet not understanding what my attorney wasdoing. My attorney was making me out to he the bad-you see my attorney wanted meto take the stand and say I had affair with this woman and she was just upset.And I wouldn’t do it. I didn’t know at the time that he was in on it. And ifthey lost, they really weren’t going to lose this case. If they lost, theywanted at least to destroy my reputation. And I couldn’t understand where thewitnesses were. And I didn’t know until this month that they were there, theywere just segregated outside of the courtroom. And so all day of the 21st Ilistened to the testimony. It was so ridiculous the jurors were laughing at thetestimony, that’s how ridiculous. I insisted when some nurses were up for juryduty I had insisted they get on the stand because they would have been able tobelieve the medical evidence. I mean the medical evidence which cleared me; wewon right then and there.“I couldn’t understand my lawyer put a woman on the jury who admitted, it’s inthe transcript, that her and her husband had seen the stories and read thestories and had already formed a conclusion. Obviously, if you had read thestories the conclusion would have been that I was guilty. Right? And as far asthe public knew, I was still being suspected of all these, you know hundredsomething rapes, and nobody knew these didn’t exist and nobody knew they didn’tgo anywhere. So as this jury took, I couldn’t understand it. He said, ‘Oh, don’tworry, it will be alright, I know what I am doing.’ The next day we come back,[I] still expecting to present a case, the 22nd of January, (1] still expectingto present a case. They called up a few minor witnesses. The only new witnessthey put on the case, they were trying to prove that the publishing companydidn’t exist, that it was phony, that it was a scam to draw women into it that Icould rape and all this type of stuff. This is what the prosecution was tryingto prove. There was just too much thousands of dollars, ‘Yeah, blah, blah, I’llcome and testify and blah, blah.’ Then he turns around and tells my courtappointed attorney for the Post-conviction that he thinks James Corry, that’sthe attorney’s name, did marvelous work for me sad did the best he could underthe circumstances. Yes, I’m innocent but no attorney could have done better forme. Making himself a witness who wasn’t usable, but he didn’t show up for thetrial though he promised. This pastor had files [files?-word unclear] in hishand to set me free and refused to use it. I’ll let you draw your ownconclusions as to why. I did not know the full extent of what my attorney haddone to me. I was sent to prison. Until Feb. 15, a week or so ago [?]. At thepost-conviction in Columbia South Carolina the only two witnesses present weremyself sad the attorney for the state. My attorney was testifying for the state.He got on the stand sad lied about several things that needed to be true, that Ineed personally knew to be true. Now he had told me up until then that thereason be didn’t use the lab was that it didn’t show a screen for alcohol andfor all these years I had believed him. On the stand however, knowing that itmight come out, he revealed that it did show a screen for alcohol. And becouldn’t give a good reason why he didn’t use it. That is also the time I foundout that all the witnesses subpoenaed were sitting outside the courtroom thewhole time for two days sad he never called them. Then the court-appointedattorney asked him, .Would this witness had contradicted Meryl Blackburn? ‘Wouldthis one?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Would this one?’ ‘Yes.’ On and on for the whole time for twodays, and be never [?]. And the court appointed attorney kept asking him, ‘Wouldthis have contradicted Meryl Blackburn? With this one?’ ‘Yes’ ‘And with thisone?’ ‘Yes.’ and on and on. And yet be kept saying it wasn’t important topresent that. It wasn’t important that there wasn’t any witnesses. According tolaw, the lawyer can refuse to call witnesses.“However, the Constitution says I have a right to have witnesses there. UnderSouth Carolina law, an attorney can override the defendant and not call thewitnesses. And that’s what they did to me. So in essence my ConstitutionalRights were [blank pause], so I was sent to prison without being able to produceany witnesses.“Now we left the Post-conviction hearing on Feb 15 knowing that it was lost,knowing that it was rigged from the very beginning. About the most major pointwhy my attorney threw the case. The Judge cut me off. We could have documentedit and proved it. Testify. In essence, he took our defense away by notpermitting me to testify at all about it. Again no fair trial. He said, ‘I willlet you know in 30 days.’ But we knew, we knew at the time, it was pretty muchopen and shut. But then I pretty much knew that in no state court would anycourt appointed attorney was I ever going to get anywhere. This attorney shouldhave subpoenaed Rev. Randle sad put him on the stand sad be refused to do so.Again, not calling witnesses. There was another brother named Joe in Charlottewho was a major witness in the case. He would alone have got me a new trial butstating that I had called him from the jail after the first day of the trial andtold him I needed him to be a witness at the next day, for him to take off workto corn on down to Columbia and testify. He then called my attorney and myattorney told him not to come. This man now won’t even talk to Christians aboutit. When they talk to him on the phone, he’s just terrified, he’s scared todeath and under no circumstances will be come to Columbia, South Carolina. Thereis a conspiracy going on here. That could be overruled by an attorney. There area couple of attorneys in this state who are known that they can’t be gotten to.And they have all told me that my case is open and shut. I should never havewent to prison. I could have been set free by a couple court orders. But I havenever been able to get these attorneys. And the reason for me not being able towrite anybody, or have contact with anybody was so that funds could never bereached, could never be raised so that I could hire an attorney that could setme free. In May, I’ll have been in custody for 4 years. In January, this year Iwas already in prison for 3 years, for something that I didn’t do, and forsomething that could have proved I was innocent, if I’d just been allowed toproduce witnesses. In essence I have to hire an attorney who will subpoena thewitnesses who will make no deal to sell me out and will let me have a fairtrial. There is something else that you need to know. Three days after I wasplaced in jail without bail my attorney came to me. He said the Federalprosecutor, the assistant attorney general, whatever you want to call him theattorney solicitor, wanted to make a deal. Now remember I was facing a statecharge not a federal charge. But this was the Feds. Now all I had to do was tellhim where all the Christians were hiding, identify all these people in theunderground, and I could go free. And I said no. It’s a matter of record that afederal proffer, this is an immunity grant for testimony, was offered me--it’son record-- and it was turned down. After I was convicted in ‘88 I was sent toprison in Columbia--there are several. Kirkland was the name of mine. I wascalled up front and I was told to sit down and wait, that the secret service wascoming to talk to me. The woman supervising officer who was on duty found itstrange that this secret service agent who was supposed to be locally fromColumbia did not know where the prison was. And she just said, ‘Boy they arehiring dumb people today we had to give him instruction how to get here.’ Whenhe arrived he let it slip out that he was actually a member of PresidentReagan’s body guard staff from Wash. D.C. He said that he had to leave in acouple of days to Moscow. This was right before the Reagan-Moscow trip. And thathe had to get ready to set up for the President. What was he doing here? And allhe wanted was the same information. Of course it was the information. Why wasthe secret service involved? He was a member of Reagan’s staff. Now after that,I was left alone, everything was left alone for a long time. And then in '90 inthe winter of ‘90, the FBI came. I had been moved to a…ah- I had been in threeprisons. They keep moving me around and they are fixing to move me again is whatthey tell me. The FBI came this was late at night I was brought from my cellafter everyone else was locked down, and I was taken up front. There were twoagents of the FBI. They said they were there to question me again, was I willingto talk? Was I willing to make a deal? I said, ‘No.’ They said all this could bebehind me, I said ‘No.’ They left. They’ve came back three other times. Finallythey quit coming. I guess they are getting the message. But I kind of expectthem to show up now that I’ve lost the post-conviction. As soon as I getnotified in writing that I’ve lost this post-conviction, I expect for them toshow up again trying to know if I will make a deal; the answer is ‘No.’ Isn’t itamazing that I’m supposed to be this terrible rapist on a state charge that theFeds somehow have authority over this state charge and they are willing to letme just go, wipe it off the books for turning Christians who are wanted fornothing, a lot of times nothing but misdemeanor warrants, or child custodywarrants where the state wants to take the kids, or for violations of courtorders. A lot of these people are on the run, from Christian schools where thestate has sworn out warrants for these Christians because they were teaching thechildren, and the state decided that this was not right and so on. Little stuff,and yet they are willing to let me go for all these people plus the Christianswho are hiding them out. I think you’d better wake up brothers and sisters,because I was sent to prison without the right to a fair trial and I want tellyou what. It could be done real easy. It could be done real easy. They controlthe media. They could say anything about you they want to say. They control thegovernments. They control the police forces. Wake up!“I want to go into something else that is going on right now in the news. Forover twelve years I have said that the goal of the United States government wasto activate what is called Operation Garden Plot and its sub-plot OperationCablesplice. Which was martial law, total military control over all policeforces, governments, and so on. I’ve said that in order to do that they wantedthe populace out there to scream at the president that he wasn’t doing his jobof protecting them from acts of terrorism. And that they were willing to give uptheir constitutional rights. Now we have seen time and time again in order tostop the drug wars to stop the drug dealers, and all the bloodshed that they arewilling to give up Constitutional rights. People are willing to do it. People,when terrorism strikes, are willing to do it. Now for years, the Illuminati havetried to have the Arab countries be so outraged that they would start terrorismin the United States on a great massive rate. And our country is moresusceptible than any other country for the simple reason that we are notprepared for it. We don’t believe it could happen to us. And they thought theywere going to be able to do it in Lebanon. They didn’t pull it off. They thoughtby hitting Gaddafi he would act, he wasn’t able to strike back. He was unable todo it. And now we are involved in a war whose sole purpose is to have those actsof terrorism launched upon us in this country. [The media has hyped every act ofterrorism they could dredge up in recent years.-F.] And I will leave you withthat. Now people soon you will all be in the same danger I’m in. I’m asking foryour help. I assure you in the name of our lord Jesus Christ I am innocent ofthis charge. I state so before the Lord and you in his name. I’m innocent ofthis. Is it any surprise that John Todd who did them so much damage will beframed and sent to prison? Remember that I warned everybody about it that itwould happen 2 years before it happened. I was warned. What is so agitating inthis is that Christians who should have stood by me, who knew I was innocent,didn’t do it. They became so afraid that they would be gone after, that theyjust left me here. I need your help. I need copies of this tape made. I need itpassed around. I need the word to get around. I need anybody who can help to getthe word around, and to help financially. Not until I can hire thesenon-collaborating attorneys will I get proved and get free. I could be free atthis time. I could have been free three years ago. I never should have been sentto prison all I would have had to do was to have help and never had it. And Idefinitely desperately need this, I’m not very good, I wasn’t very good atasking for finances when I was in the ministry. I couldn’t even take my ownofferings in the church. I need your help. I have a dear brother and sister...[name given is no longer working with him--at present 1, Fritz Springmeier am]is their name who have stood with me all through this. They don’t have anything.They are just an everyday couple, a married couple. The man works he works hard.He works long hours. He is not a minister. But they can’t get to him. And he iswilling to have this [financial help come to him. See, I can’t receive money[cash & checks] I can only receive a few dollars and they have to be in a U.S.postal money order. And if they catch me receiving a lot of mail in here again,they will come down hard on me, and it just makes it impossible. This dearbrother and sister in the Lord will take money, put it in the account andwhenever there is enough money, move to get my release. I am asking you to help.I am asking you whether it is five dollars or a hundred dollars, or a thousanddollars. Please, we need desperately. We need to raise the finances. We need toget me free. I never understood before as much as I understood now Paul’swritings for when he was in prison to the churches for simple things, a coat, afew belongings, some finances- people who sent to him. And others who totallyneglected him yet called themselves his brother and sister in Christ. It was soclear. I am asking for your help. I’m sending this tape to a couple ofministers, who after all these years I finally got their addresses again. Andthe Lord has just blessed me recently, and I will send this tape out. Now I’mhoping others will make copies and send it out. I’m hoping the word will getout. There is no use for me giving you my address for they keep moving me aroundfrom prison to prison so much I may not even be here before this week is out. Solet me give you how to send funds and how to contact me if you really feel youwant to reach me. You can write me, and they will send me your letter and I’llpray about it. And if I need to take the risk and write you, I’ll do it. Forthose who wish to help you can send cash, money orders, whatever, since I’m notallowed to sign anything in prison they need to be mailed out to this party.[nowFritz Springmeier] And if you would make it out to the party whose name I goingto give you in a minute... [At present checks can be made out to FritzSpringmeier to help Johnnie Todd. Put a notation on the check for what it isfor.] You will be surprised for a small contribution of a gift of $5 howgrateful I’ll be. Right now the earliest I can get out [without winning incourt] is the year 2005. That’s a long time people for something you didn’t do.We just don’t have that long. I’ve got family and loved ones, and brothers andsisters in Christ that I desperately need to be out there for I’m asking foryour help. If the Illuminati, Strom Thurmond and them put so much effort to thisto me, there is a reason. And I’m asking for your help. I’m asking ministers whohear this who have newsletters to just simply send out what is going on here, tomake copies of this tape and to make it available. People I don’t have much timeleft in here. Right now there is a conspiracy going on and one of the reasons Ihurry to make this tape there is a man in prison who years ago who hadthreatened to kill me. Amazingly, I’m just John Todd., I don’t know why theywould want to do that. Because at that time they were not sure what kind of ascandal it would because they separated us they sent us to different prisons.And they put what is called a flag on my record, saying that we couldn’t ever bein the same prison together. Nine months ago, when I was fighting to gain myfreedom, lawsuits, and doing some different stuff myself, because I didn’t havean attorney. They got upset at me, they wanted to punish me by sending me toanother prison. O.K. They couldn’t do it because this man was at that prison.And they let me know they couldn’t do it, that our records were flagged. Nowthis man was doing a life sentence without parole for murder. Since being inprison he has stabbed four people. Three of them in the last couple years sinceI’ve known him. He has sworn to kill me. And now he is here. A few weeks ago, hestabbed an inmate and a second inmate at another institution, and instead ofcharging him with it, and putting him into solitary, like they had done before,they dropped the charges, and sent him to this prison. When I heard that he washere, he was being held up in the lock up in solitary waiting for bed space inmy unit. He will be just a couple of cells from me.“I went to the authorities here and I complained. Surprisingly guess whatbrothers and sisters? The flags on our records had disappeared. And there was norecord of them ever being there. In fact, they went so far as to say there is norecord in our records of us being in the same prison together. And yet we’d beenin two prisons together and in the same building a few cells apart. And itsright there. That much is in the records. O.K. Complaints were filed and so onand so forth. And I looked right at the Captain here, Capt. Byrd over securityand told him, ‘You did this. You got the man who will kill me. There is no bigsecret about this. This doesn’t happen by accident.’ Now at that time what wassupposed to be done was that they should have shipped me. When I complained theyshould have shipped me. They claimed they couldn’t send him anywhere else, thathe’s been to all these prisons and done all these things, that this was the lastplace they could have him. Well, they should have sent me away. Now they areclaiming that none of the other prisons want to take me. Isn’t it amazing thatthey can’t ship me when this man is scheduled to move into my unit into myprison dorm here Fri. This is Monday. They’re doing this to try to kill me. Whatwill happen? I’m in the Lord’s hands... [Johnnie Todd repeats his request forhelp]...They are afraid that eventually I’ll get my freedom....God bless you.” [end of tape and message] This tape was made and quietly gotten out.

The correct variations in spelling theDu Pont name are as follows: “Dupont,” “DuPont,” “du Pont,” “duPont,” “Du Pont,”and “du Pont de Nemours.” In English the second syllable is accented. In French,neither syllable is accented. The name has tended to be spelled “du Pont” forthe family and “Du Pont” for business. I decided for this article to standardizethe spelling in line with this tendency. A Dynasty of Satanic RoyaltySitting down to write about the du Ponts reminded me of two other families.Recently, John Coleman, a researcher on the elite, commented to me that when hehad researched the Queen of Denmark he had discovered that the royal Danishfamily was slipping away secretly from everyone and they were going to Satanicrituals. It is also noteworthy that 5 modern kings of Denmark have been theleaders of Freemasonry in Denmark, and the Danish royal family, princes etc.have been active Masons. John Dale wrote a book The Prince and The Paranormalwhich goes into the secret occult activities of the British royal family,especially Prince Charles, but also many other royal family members too. Besidesthe secret occult activities of the British Monarch, they have been openlyleaders of Freemasonry (see the appendix of Be Wise As Serpents for a detailedchart on this.) The du Ponts are similar to these families in that they too area dynasty, they too have a very public image, and they too have a totally hiddenlife. In fact, the du Ponts have better control over the press’s coverage ofthem than the British Royal Family.One of the clues that the family is a top Satanic family are the frequency ofmarriages between relatives of the du Pont descendants. Few people are aware ofthe immense importance bloodlines play in the upper levels of Satanism. Blood isbelieved to carry the occult power. Unless a person has the correct blood he orshe will not rise to the highest levels of Satanism. The du Ponts haveintermarried with the Balls and the Gardners. These other families are known tobe involved with the Illuminati and Satanism. For instance George W. Ball is onthe important permanent steering committee of the Bilderbergers and has attendedthe Bilderberger meetings that I know of starting with the original firstmeeting in 1954, plus in 1955, 1957, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1974, 1975.George W. Ball is also a member of CFR and the Trilateral Commission. ElizaCazenove (Gardner was a sister to a du Pont. I) Dorsey Cazenove (Gardner was adistant cousin. Will Gardner and Bessie Gardner duPont were cousins of theduPonts. John W. (Gardner is a 60 Illuminatus and in charge of the RockefellerBros. Fund. I have found the (Gardners in the thick of Satanism and witchcraft.The Complete Facts Are Difficult to Discover At the library, I checked out a book Du Pont by William Dutton. The book hadbeen a gift to the library from the Du Pont Company. I also checked out a bookAlfred I. Du Pont by Joseph Frazier Wall. That book’s author J. Wall wasfinanced to write the book by the trustees of the Jessie Ball du Pont Fund.Although scholarly in appearance, it is what they don’t say that can be socrucial to really understand the history of the du Pont family. When a family isworth billions they can afford to tidy up their family histories, and keeppeople from spilling the beans about secrets. On May 16, 1893 the press reportedthe death of Alfred Victor du Pont with great laudatory comments. Alfred (knownas Fred) had been in business in Louisville, KY and was widely known in the areaas a philanthropist. Louisville’s main paper the Louisville Commercial gave thepublic a totally fictitious story about how Alfred Victor du Pont died, alongwith many pages of the highest praise.If it hadn’t been for the honesty of the Enquirer (a Cincinnati paper--not to beconfused with today’s national tabloid by the same name Enquirer) the publicwould not have learned what really had happened. The false story’ said that Freddied of apoplexy while visiting his brother Bidermann. The duPont family stillmaintains this fiction is true, although all the facts of the case are blatantlyknown, and were public knowledge to quite a number of people whose lives wereinvolved with what actually happened. Both Fred du Pont and his nephew Colemandu Pont were regular customers at the most expensive house of prostitution inthe area, Maggie Payne’s bordello. Although rich, Fred was not willing to helpsupport a distraught prostitute raise the child she was sure he had sired. Soshe shot Fred in the heart. Coleman du Pont, who was familiar with Maggie’s,soon went down to Maggie’s, retrieved the body with a hearse and took the bodyto Biderman’s house. There the coroner was willing to lie on the deathcertificate that the death was caused by ‘effusive apoplexy.” It is most likelyColeman made that lie worth his effort. Henry Watterson, editor of theCourier-Journal, although he later admitted he knew the real story of themurder, went ahead and printed the false story on behalf of the du Ponts.This article starts out with this anecdote to make a point--the 13 top familiesdo control the press--and are very sensitive to any negative publicity of anykind. Not only are their Satanic activities deeply hidden, but even just thenormal everyday sinfulness or human soap box drama of their lives is deeplyhidden. By the way, Coleman duPont, an extremely hedonistic man, is one of theduPonts I strongly suspect was into Satanism. Further secrecy has been obtainedby working through trusted proxies. Today, a key proxy is the Jew Irving SaulShapiro. The du Pont family is represented in a number of groups by Irving SaulShapiro, who is on the Council of Foreign Relations. Irving S. Shapiro is a keyperson who has been the go-between to coordinate the activities of theRockefellers, the du Ponts, and the Watson families (Watson family members whoare 6° Illuminati are mentioned in the 1/1/93 newsletter. Shapiro was a memberof Carter’s Advisory Council on Japan-US. Economic Relations, is a trustee ofthe University of Delaware, director of the Jewish Federation of Delaware,director of IBM (which is a Watson-Rockefeller business), director of Citicorp(Rothschilds and Rockefellers-- headed in the past by 6° Illuminatus, CFRmember, Bilderberger Walter Wristen), and the U.S./U.S.S.R. Trade and EconomicCouncil (which Rockefeller plays a big part of). Shapiro is or was director ofContinental American Insurance Co., International Business Machines (under IBM).Irving Saul Shapiro was chairman of the du Pont Company.Beginning at the BeginningThe biographies of the du Pont family usually begin with the marriage of Samueldu Pont to Anne Alexandrine Montechanin in 1737 in Paris, France. Although Annewas a Huguenot, she was a medium with the spirit world. Anne came from anancient noble family that lived in Burgundy, France. It is quite possible thatit was Anne’s bloodline that gave the Du Ponts their occult power. Anne’sbloodline may possibly tie in to the House of David. At any rate, Samuel andAnne’s son was the first du Pont to rise to greatness, and the first du Pontthat can be connected directly to the Illuminati. Samuel and Anne’s son wasPierre Samuel du Pont. Later Pierre Samuel added de Nemours to his name toprevent confusion between him and other French legislatures named Dupont. PierreSamuel du Pont was a genius. Pierre’s mother taught him to be a medium withspirits, but early on Pierre had to deny it publicly. His father Samuel couldnot understand the boy’s genius, such as his ability at age 12 to translateGreek and Latin at sight. When Pierre’s mother died when he was 16, be no longerhad a parent in the family who could understand him, and after getting one ofhis frequent beatings from his father, he ran away, and was spared nearstarvation by his Uncle Pierre de Monchantin. Initially, Pierre was awatchmaker, But within a short time he attracted the attention of several topIlluminati for his ability to write good tracts, and articles that advocatedvarious economic and political views that they wanted promoted. Pierre Joinedthe Freemasons, and at some point was illuminated, as most of the French lodgesbecame. Although Pierre went through severe financial difficulties after theFrench Revolution, be regularly made payments to Masonic organizations inFrance. Besides being friends with all the famous Masons of the time, one Masonbrother of his worthy of note is the French astronomer Lalande, who helped hidehim during the revolution. Someone very powerful protected Pierre Samuel duringthe French Revolution, this is hinted at by historian Pierre Jolly, althoughJolly never gives his protector’s name. I believe he was protected becauseDuPont was part of the Inner Satanic hierarchy. He was also protected by thedaughter of Swiss financier Jacques Necker. This daughter was Madame Germalne deStaël. The Madame was a close friend of Pierre Samuel and she operated a famoussalon/cathouse. Madame de Staël was nothing less than an intimate friend of St.Simon. She shared his occult revolutionary ideas. Henri de St. Simon was astudent and friend of Jacques Rigomer-Bazin who was associated with the Innercircle of several occult-based revolutionary groups during Pierre du Pont’s timein France. St. Simon was the author of The New Christianity which foreshadowedthe creation of international communism. He also wrote in the early 1800s TheGlobe and The Reorganization of the European Community laying out ideas andplans for European unity. In the early 1800’s, the Saint-Simonians suggested inthe early 1800’s that the date 2000 be the target date for the New Order. Inorder to rearrange the world into the New Order, a number of items and stagesneeded to occur. Two canals-one through the Suez and one through Panama wereneeded they said to create \"Interdependence\" between the nations. They alsosuggested a high dam on the Nile. They suggested the technologicaltransformation of the earth, and the biological creation of a new, androgynoushumanoid. (Androgynous beings are being produced in underground facilities-theyare the small greys used to fly the saucers!) Progress would be brought about bya series of revolutions. (Study from Fire in The Minds of Men by James H.Billington to understand how the occult fraternities have created all therevolutions since the French revolution.) St. Simon, an Illuminatus, wanted tohave a child with Madame de Stall which would become the anti-Christ. It didn’thappen, but anyway, it is significant that the person who personally intervenedduring the French Revolution and saved Pierre Samuel DuPont’s life was Madame deStaël. Necker along with Lafayette would later loan DuPont large sums of moneyfor him try out his schemes in business and in forming a communist society. It’sinteresting that the Physiocrats journal was Les Ephémérides du Citoyen Thetitle has astrological occult undertones. On Jan. 1, 1769 Pierre Samuel DuPonttook over the journal’s management. He became a key leader in France advocatinga new order. Pierre Samuel DuPont believed in Plato’s idea of government whichincluded a philosopher-king. Pierre Samuel was deist. He spoke of \"God\" but hemeant nature’s deistic God, not a personal God. He believed nature was a higherGod than his mechanical deist \"God\". Notice, the Jefferson in the Declaration ofIndependence also wrote “nature’s God.\" This is because the deists likeJefferson and Du Pont believed Nature was the highest God. The ambiguity ofmeaning has permitted people to think Jefferson was referring the Christian Godin the Declaration of Independence. It is a common occurrence that Christiansassume that others who use words that they use, think like the Christians. Eventoday, many New Agers have an easy task to snow Christians. For instance theyjust say, \"I believe in Christ.\" The Masonic reference book 10,000 FamousFreemasons put out by the Missouri Lodge of Research provides this about PierreSamuel DuPont: \"When 23 he published two pamphlets on finances, which attractedthe attention of the celebrated Quesnay. He then expounded the doctrines ofQuesnay’s school, \"the physiocrats.\" Went to Poland in 1774 at the request ofKing Stanislaus-Augustus [a Freemason] to organize a general system of nationaleducation. When Turgot became comptroller-general of French finances, DuPont wasnamed inspector-general of commerce....He was recalled by Vergennes to assist innegotiating with England the treaty to accord independence to the U.S. in 1789he was a member of the States. General, but his reactionary views led to hisimprisonment in 1792 .... In 1799 he emigrated to the U.S. with his family, andat Jefferson’s request, started on a plan for national education in thiscountry. He returned to France in 1802 and was instrumental in promoting thetreaty of 1803, by which Louisiana was sold to the U.S.\" Pierre Samuel was a keyfigure in attempts to create a national education system in both Poland and thenew U.S. A national education system was a Masonic/illuminati goal to controleducation and take it out of the hands of sincere Christians. Jefferson, who wasa Grand Orient Mason of the famous Nine Sisters Lodge, and apparently a keyIlluminatus, was a close friend of Pierre Samuel and was instrumental at severalkey points in Pierre Samuel’s life when he needed help. Jefferson arranged forthe first gunpowder order (which was a government order) when the Du Ponts wentinto the gunpowder business. Benjamin Franklin, a key leader of several secretoccult fraternal groups was also a close friend of Pierre Samuel. When BenjaminFranklin arrived Dec. 1776 in France, one of the first people who sought out tovisit with was Pierre Samuel DuPont. During the next year after that, DuPont wasa frequent visitor to Franklin’s residence in the village of Passy. In 1783,DuPont expected to sit with Franklin at the treaty table in Paris, but JohnAdams got the Americans to sign a treaty with Britain without France’sinvolvement.Alexander Hamilton, whose role in the conspiracy is now known, was DuPont’slawyer in the U.S.The Next Generation During the second year of Pierre Samuel’s marriage to Made Le Dèe, Victor Madewas born with the Marquis de Mirabeau as his godfather. Victor Marie Du Pont(1767-1827) was an aide-de-camp to Illuminatus Lafayette from 1789-1792. WhetherVictor was a Mason in France before the family came to the United States in1800, I do not know. Victor Marie DuPont soon got involved in Freemasonry in theUnited States after arriving. The following are some of the highlights to hissecret Masonic career according to Masonic records. * 1808-signed a masonic petition to create a lodge at Angelica, NY * 1813--joined Washington Lodge No. 1 of Delaware * 1814-joined Knights Templars of Wilmington, Del. * 1819-Grand Marshall of the Grand Lodge of Delaware (also 1822, 1823, 1825, 1827) * 1825--Grand Treasurer of the Grand Lodge of DelawarePierre Samuel had two more sons- Paul François (died at age 1 month), andEleuthère lrénée. Eleuthère lrénée followed his father’s steps in gettingIlluminated. Eleuthère lrénée was a prominent outspoken Jacobin.THE JACOBINSThe Duc d’Orleans, Grand Master of the Grand Orient of France, that is head ofall the French masons, along with two other key Masons Talleyrand and Mirabeaustarted the Jacobins. According to the book The War of the Antichrist with theChurch (a book made from the lectures of George Dillon) (Dublin, Ireland: M.H.Gill & Son, 1885) where Dillon lectures on the French Revolution he states thatboth Talleyrand and Mirabeau were key Illuminati. The name of the original lodgeof the Jacobins was changed to Club Breton and then Jacobin Club. The Jacobinswere basically an Illuminized type of Freemasonry. The President of the JacobinClub was the Freemason Georges Jacques Danton, who was a member of the famousand powerful Nine Sisters Lodge (nine sisters or nine muses is what the Pleiadesis called.) Lafayette was a Jacobin, as well as the key players in the FrenchRevolution. A very secret body of 300 key Freemasons ruled France secretlyduring this period according to the Autobiography of Wolfe Tone (pub. by R.Barry O’Brien, 1893). Robespierre, was both a Freemason and an illuminatus. Infact, he was both a disciple of Weishaupt and Rousseau. Prussian BaronAnacharsis Clootz was also a Freemason and illuminatus. He also was a discipleof Weishaupt and understood better what Weishaupt was trying to accomplish. Ifone studies what these men taught you will discover it is what was later knownas Socialism and communism. The original idea for all the French Revolutionstarted with the Satanic hierarchy. In Nov. 1793, the true colors of thisSatanic inspired business can be seen in the campaign against religion, whereanyone who was a priest in France was killed, and the Illuminati posted one ofits mottos in public \"Death is an eternal sleep.\" Eyewitnesses testify thatSatan has a very detailed plan which he entrusts to his very select few at thetop. Much of what seems coincidence and unrelated is actually according to avery clever (diabolical) plan. Eleuthère lrénée Du Pont was a major printer forthe Jacobins. He was a convinced Deist and worshipped nature too.A Powderman Becomes Director of the National BankLater in the United States, after successfully setting up the best gunpowderfactory in the world, Eleuthère Irenée DuPont was selected along with his friendNicholas Biddle to be a director of Hamilton’s creation the United States Bank.Remember that Astor was also selected as a director of this \"National\" Bank.The Mason Stephen Girard (1750-1831), initiated into Masonry in 1788 inCharleston, S.C., helped establish the second Bank of United States in 1816 andserved as its director. Girard had amassed a $9 million fortune by the time ofhis death. He was born in France, and become a sea captain. Where his money camefrom is somewhat of a mystery. He gave large sums of his money to masoniccharity.Early Years in AmericaOn Jan. 3, 1800, the DuPont tribe arrived in the United States with grandioseplans. Part of the plans were to create a new society. While Victor Marie andhis father pursued grandiose schemes that failed miserably, Eleuthère lrénéeDuPont started a gunpowder business in Delaware. Irénée’s success can beattributed to several factors: * The French government gave him top secret machinery and plans to produce the best gunpowder possible in that day. It was state-of-the-art technology, and they supplied manpower to help get started. * The DuPonts had friends in various places that helped them in numerous ways, getting financing, business, land, etc. * Eleuthère lrénée DuPont was intelligent, worked very hard and worked with patience. If he hadn’t had so many commendable qualities, then the Du Pont family may have sunk back in history, and another family taken their place.A Royal Dynasty The DuPont’s are a dynasty of Kings. They have been called Kings- and rightly soeven if people have been unaware that they are a dynasty of Illuminati Kings. Ido not know which particular men have served during the Satanic rituals. Thefamily has always had a head of the family. It may be that the most powerfulDuPont may also secretly serve as the highest Satanist. I don’t know who hasbeen representing the family at the highest levels of secret Satanism (I suspector surmise it has not been the public head of the family in modern times), but Ican list the public head of the family as it passed down through time: Persons below --years as head of family-- generation coming to America * Pierre Samuel Dupont- 1739-1817- first * Eleuthère lrénée DuPont- 1817-1834--second * Alfred Victor DuPont- 18341850-third * Henry DuPont- 1850-1889--third * Henry A. DuPont- 1889- -fourth These men had great authority over the tribe of duPonts.The du Ponts had family council where even the women had voting rights. TheDuPonts, like the Rothschilds helped set up their children’s marriages, and manyof the early ones were to cousins. For instance, much to the delight of theduPonts, Sophie Madeleine du Pont married her cousin Samuel Francis DuPont in1833. (2 of Sophie’s drawing occur later in this article.) The family ownedeverything in common, and distributed according to needs and according to thecontribution that each could give to the family business. The James Bidderman,the son of Evelina DuPont Bidderman, went to France and his decedents would givethe DuPonts a lineage in France. One of the families that Intermarried and wereclose friends with the DuPonts was the Cazenoves family. Both families wereclose friends with Thomas Jefferson and Albert Gallatin, I have concluded thatboth Thomas Jefferson and Albert Gallatin were Illuminati. Further, I discoveredin a forty volume set on American Statesmen in vol. 13, p.386 that AlbertGallatin claimed to be descended from the ancient Roman Consul Callatinus.Incredible as it may seem, the black nobility have kept track of theirbloodlines. The same people ruling the world today are in many ways thedescendants of the rulers in past ages. Antoine Charles Cazenove, born inGeneva, Sw. was a business partner with Albert Gallatin. During the War of 1812,the DuPont gunpowder factory since it was the primary American powder companywas the known target for the British to destroy. However, the British neverattacked it. The Du Ponts had organized a local militia called the BrandywineRangers. Interestingly, their militia flag was a beehive on white silk.Lafayette visited the DuPonts in Delaware the summer of 1825.Another important Mason who would visit the DuPonts was Henry Clay who was theAmerican Secretary of State and head of the Whig Party. Henry Clay was GrandMaster of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky and Grand Orator for the G.L. 1806-09. Hewas one of the Freemasons involved in a high level meeting that used the U.S.Senate Chambers on Mar. 9, 1822 for their meeting. If the duPonts were alreadyone of the primary top families, it may well be Clay was coming to them forguidance on how to steer the nation. The duPonts played a role too in thebuilding of the American capital, which was laid out and constructed withnumerous occult patterns.The Next Generation--Pierre Samuel’s GrandchildrenEleuthère lrénée du Pont had a daughter Sophie Madeleine du Pont (1810-1888).Sophie was also her mother’s name. Sophie Madeleine du Pont (her nameSophie/Sophia is popular with Moriah) wrote diaries, journal voluminouscorrespondence. Sophie also drew hundreds are drawings and sketches, many ofthem caricatures of people. Of her sketches, this article reproduces two of themwhich bear importance to this newsletter. The first is a drawing by Sophie duPont of one of the duPonts dressed up like Satan with long paper horns and atail. Interestingly, according to a 12/12/1829 letter by Sophie to one of herrelatives Sophie comments that the costume of Satan was mistaken \"for Old Nick.\"(See the article on Saturn in this newsletter for evidence of the connectionbetween Satan and Santa.) The next drawing is a drawing that went with a letterfrom Sophie to Clementina Smith, 21 July 1837 which is a self-portrait of whatSophie calls \"Blackies\" (Black servants) who \"toted\" (carried) her to her bathin a special chair. This drawing is included to show how wealthy the DuPontswere within a short time after coming to Delaware, U.S.A. Alfred Victor DuPont,who took over as head of both the family and the factories making gunpowder, wasmarried to Meta. Meta was into Swedenborgianism, which was a type of mysticalreligious Freemasonry that was based on the Swedish mason Swedenborg’steachings. Alfred Victor apparently didn’t feel anything negative toward this.His wife Meta organized a Swedenborg church in town. Around the Civil War times,the DuPonts became less identified with Deism and more Identified with theEpiscopal church. Joanna Smith DuPont was Instrumental in this change. One ofthe families that the DuPonts would marry with was the Cazenoves, who wereEpiscopalians, and some members were I suspect involved with the Illuminati.Christ Church was built off the DuPont communal property for Episcopal services.By the Civil War, the state of Delaware was lock-stock-and-barrel under thecontrol of the DuPonts and their friends the Bayards, the Saulsburys, and theGreys, in this 20th century, the DuPonts have gotten firmer control. Because thestate of Delaware is controlled by the DuPonts, et. al., it is worthwhile toexamine some of the people the DuPonts and their elite friends have placed intooffice. This is an unfinished skimpy list, I have done only a little research inthis direction.Governors of Delaware(chronological order) * John Collins (Gov. 1819-1822) -- Collin’s family * Caleb P. Bennett (Gov. 1832-1836) -- Freemason * Thomas Stockton (Gov. 1844-??) -- high ranking Freemason * Charles C. Stockley (Gov. 1883-87) -- Freemason * BenjaminT .Biggs( Gov.1 887-1891)-- Freemason * Pierre Samuel duPont,I V( 1977- ) -- also U.S.Representative, and other gov. positionsU.S. Senators of Delaware(alphabetical order of surnames) * T.Coleman duPont ( Sen.1 921-192?) * Henry A. DuPont ( Sen.1 895-1896) ( 1906-1916) In 1896, the U.S. Senate rejected his election and therefore Henry duPont’s credentials due to proof of voter fraud. Delaware legislature (republican) replaced Henry (a republican) with a democrat. But in 1899 when the Senate seat became available and another one in 1901 too they could not come to any agreement on a selection of a Senator because Henry A. DuPont and John Edwards O’Sullivan Addicks the two republican leaders were fighting so much.

Within only a short timeafter getting started in 1802 they had the best quality gunpowder in the worldfor the general market. Every war the United States has fought starting in 1802with the war against Tripoli (today Libya) and the Barbary Pirates until theincursion Into Somalia this last year the American military has depended uponDuPont gunpowder. Henry du Pont (1812-1889) took over command of the gunpowdermanufacturing when he was thirty-eight. He was very authoritarian and was knownas Boss Henry. His narrow-minded, backward and authoritarian thinking ran theDuPont Company into the ground in spite of their control of the gunpowdermarket. When he died, Alfred I. DuPont, Pierre Samuel du Pont II (1870-1954),and Thomas Coleman du Pont (1863-1930) took over various DuPont manufacturingaffairs. This triumvirate revived the aging Du Pont factories. They bought outthe rest of the gunpowder manufacturers, giving them an absolute monopoly in themunitions industry. They modernized the DuPont factories and put the DuPontbusinesses back into top shape.On August 22, 1857 the du Ponts lost their first family member to an explosion,Alexis duPont. The duPonts had always been in the forefront on safety at theirgunpowder factories, but that did not prevent them from having to sufferrepeated explosions over the years. An explosion at a gunpowder factory iseasily set off and very deadly. The tutor that was hired in 1852 to tutor theDuPont children, R. Page Williamson, described in his letters to Virginia thatthe duPont children were very spoiled and difficult to work with. In 1872, HenryduPont brought together Laflin & Rand and Hazard Powder Co. in order to form aGun Powder Trade Association. What the Association did was to eliminatecompetition between the three largest manufacturers of gunpowder, and create amonopoly for this cartel. Eventually DuPont bought out the other two plusnumerous other small gunpowder companies. I suggest that everyone who believesthat the DuPonts and the rest of the elite are capitalists should take anotherlook at history. These men do not believe in capitalism, they believe inmonopolies--which boils down to the same thing that occurs under communism. Whenthese people described their setting up a monopoly they call it \"bringing orderand stability to a fragmented and chaotic industry.\" In 1889, Alfred I. du Pontattempted to bribe French officers in charge of the production of smokelessgunpowder to give the secrets to him. But no amount of bribe would work, as theFrenchmen knew they would lose their lives if they gave the secrets to him. TheBritish were not any more helpful. Ufe was not all peaches and cream. Fred wasmurdered.William du Pont (1855-1928) was trapped in a marriage with a duPont cousin, Maydu Pont that he didn’t want to be married to. Louis Cazenove du Pout a handsome,intelligent young - committed suicide with a bullet in the library at theWilmington Club. Alfred was shot in the face by accident on a hunting trip. TheduPont family had their share of heartaches, broken marriages, insanity, etc.When Mary Belin married into the family she brought some Jewish blood. As amajor part of the budding military industrial complex the DuPonts during the19th century had to work with the army and navy. The army and navy convincedthem to Implement a contract with the Coopal Co. in Belgium for smokelesspowder, which when the formula was received was found to be inferior to what theAmerican were already producing. However, this whole episode ended with theDuPonts going with their own formula and setting up a new plant at Carney’sPoint, New Jersey. This hits the highlights of the family history in their first100 years in this nation. To celebrate their first hundred years, every livingdescendent of the first Pierre Samuel was invited to a great banquet. A buildingwas built to house them. They numbered over 100. At each person’s table settingwas a special gift of a gold coin, prepared especially to commemorate thiscentennial. On Jan. 1, 1900, the DuPont tribe celebrated. The DuPonts areshrouded in so much secrecy, that their secrecy is not even known. When EugeneDuPont, the chief executive of the family gunpowder/high explosive business diednear the turn of the century, none of the other DuPonts hardly even a vague ideaof how much the company was worth or what assets it had. (At that time theDuPonts had powder plants in PA, DEL, Iowa, and TN. The DuPonts are much thesame today, except that their assets are perhaps ten times better hidden, notonly from outsiders but from themselves. The DuPonts have in general made theirmoney the hard way-by working and producing, in contrast to the other topfamilies. The DuPonts are to be commended on this, even If at times they havebeen very tight on what they have given their workers. The DuPonts have alsoshown an amazing ability to keep their dynasty alive. There seems to be anincreasing invisibility to their family.Hitting Pay DirtOne of the people who had been Involved for a short time with the Illuminati,and is now a Christian told me that they could remember the name The Society ofthe Cincinnati and that they knew nothing about the organization, but that ithad something to do with the Illuminati. But what is this organization?Without anything but the name I began my investigation. At first look it seemedlike some old ladles genealogy group who are descendants of revolutionarysoldiers. However, as I carried out what promised to be a long term researchproject on the Society it began to appear that something big was behind thisorganization. One reference stated, \"The Society of the Cincinnati # 1783 # itis likely that no Englishman feels a greater sense of pride in being a Knight ofthe Garter, or Scotsman, a Knight of the Thistle, than an American feels inbeing a member of The Society of the Cincinnati.\" WOW. DOUBLE WOW! Here is anorganization that essentially no one I know has even heard about, and yet anAmerican would feel a great sense of pride in belonging to it. Interesting! Notonly that, but I knew what the Order of the Garter is!! The Order of the Garteris the secret inner group which is an elite group within the Order of St. Johnof Jerusalem which is the British part of the Knights of Malta. The Knights ofthe Garter are the leaders of the Committee of [unknown].They are diabolical men. Lord Peter Carrington, who is a member of the satanicOrder of Osiris and other demonic groups is a member of the Order of the Garter.Lord Palmerston is an example from history of another similar example of aKnight of the Garter who was totally corrupt, pretended to be a Christian, andpracticed Satanism. I found out that the Massachusetts legislature had had someof its senators and representatives concerned for the welfare and safety of theUnited States, because, according to testimony on record, the Society ofCincinnati was \"the beginning of a hereditary aristocracy in the U.S. dedicatedto subverting the Republic.\" The Massachusetts Legislature declared the Societyof the Cincinnati \"dangerous.\" And yet speaking for the public for all thelegislators’ trouble, the truth is nobody has even heard of the Society of theCincinnati, let alone known or guessed it was dangerous.When the United States was created it operated under the Articles ofConfederation. It was a confederation of Independent states-each of the statesprinted their - money, passed their own laws, etc. The federal government wassimply a League of Nations-type body. The Society of the Cincinnati was partlyresponsible for getting that changed. The Society of Cincinnati favored a verystrong central government, a national bank, etc. The Freemason Baron von Steubenis credited with starting the organization. The Mason Pierre L’Enfant whodesigned the City of Washington with its hidden occult symbols also designed thelogo for the Society of the Cincinnati. Every president of the United States hasworn the Diamond Eagle Jewell of the Society of the Cincinnati. Wow. And Ihadn’t even heard about it until I got this tip from this ex-illuminatus.Benjamin Franklin was an honorary member. The Marquis de Lafayette was a member.George Washington and James Monroe were Original Members. At least 15 Presidentshave been honorary members. Pres. Franklin Pierce and Zachery Taylor (his fatherwas an Original Member) were hereditary members. Many of the high ranking Masonswho were also officers in the Revolution were Original Members. Three prominentFreemasons who were big in the Society of the Cincinnati were Henry BeekmanLivingston (1750-1831), James Mann (1759-1832), and Hardy Murfee (1752-1809).Hardy served as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina beginning in1789. I noticed that many very busy elite People were spending a lot of moneyand time on this Society, whatever its purpose was. The Society had a museum,and a headquarters building in Washington, D.C. on Massachusetts Ave, N.W., andstate chapters. But why? The stated purpose of the organization didn’t seem toexplain the interest people put into the organization. Why spend time belongingto an organization whose only purpose is to commemorate the fact that all Itsmembers are descendants of Revolutionary War officers? The purpose of theorganization is \"To render permanent the cordial affection subsisting among theofficers.\" O.K. I can understand a group of officers who are all veterans of awar getting together. But their descendants? We are talking about a war whosefighting basically ended in 1781. That’s over 200 years ago. Would my busydescendants care to visit with some other Vietnam vets’ great-great-greatgrandchildren 200 years from now? Yet, my 1983 World Almanac (which lists infine print about 1,300 associations) gives the membership of the Society of theCincinnati at 2,800. Other sources indicated that the organization had anaffiliate organization in France. But how? How could an organization which wasopen to only descendants of select Revolutionary Officers be so identical inpurpose to something in France for Frenchmen? I could understand why, but onlyif the stated purposes were not the whole story. As you can see I was verysuspicious of the Society of the Cincinnati, it appears I had stumbled ontosomething big. But I hadn’t been able to tie the Society in with theIlluminati-until I stepped up my research on the duPonts. The tie-in between theIlluminati and the Society of the Cincinnati came when I began investigatingwhat I thought might turn out to be an obscure Person. His name was LeightonColeman (1837-19??) and he was married to Francis (Fanny) Elizabeth, daughter ofAlexis Irenée du Pont (1816-57). Alexis died in an accident. Occult bloodlinepower can pass through women or men, so it was worth it to investigate LeightonColeman. Leighton Coleman turned out to be the Bishop of the State of Delawarefor the Episcopal Church. He was a prime mover in the temperance movement (whichI had already discovered was Illuminati controlled). Further Leighton was grandchaplain of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons in Pennsylvania, Grand Prelate of theKnights Templar, and chaplain of the Delaware Society of the Cincinnati. Anotherof the top 13 Illuminati families is the Kennedy family. There is a connectionto the Society of the Cincinnati with this family too. Jacqueline BouvierKennedy Onassis (ex-wife to both J.F.K. and Aristotie Onassis) had a grandfathernamed Major Bouvier, who invented a family genealogy which was mostly fictionwhich was self-published in 1925 as Our Forebears, but tbe fantasy Bouviergenealogy allowed him and his sons Bud and Black Jack to get into The Society ofthe Cincinnati. (see A Woman Named Jackie , by C. David Heymann, p. 18) Allthree Bouviers were very proud of their memberships and would proudly displaytheir boutonnieres on their labels showing membership.The Three Cousins that Saved the DuPont Company in 1902The successful three Du Ponts, Alfred, Coleman, and Pierre that together tookover the gunpowder factories ended up in some serious infighting after a fewyears. Alfred divorced his wife to marry his cousin, and the Coleman and many ofthe others did not approve of the marriage. Alfred and the others got into someserious family infighting. In 1913, Alfred at one point letting his rage get thebetter of him got the Delaware legislature to pass a special law changing hisfirst wife’s sons name to spite his first wife. The special law passed the Housein four hours secretly at Alfred’s request but failed by two votes in the Senateafter the other Du Ponts found out what Alfred was trying. Alfred built hiscousin-wife Alicia the most expensive house on the east coast. In 1910 dollars,the lowest estimate is $2 million, but the actual cost may easily have beenseveral times that. The name of the mansion was named Nemours. The main groundsof the Nemours estate are 400 acres enclosed by an 9-ft. wall. Broken glass wasembedded in the concrete on top of the wall. Beyond the 400 are 2,000 acres thatmake up the estate. From 1906 until 1920, the du Pont family broke up into twofactions that waged a civil war in various arenas. Alfred I. DuPont led apolitical campaign that fought the corruption of Coleman DuPont’s forces. Up tothat time politics and voting and vote counting were totally corrupt. By April,1918 Alfred had defeated Coleman for control of Delaware’s politics. In 1911,Alfred bought the principle daily paper in the area the Wilmington Morning News.In 1916, after successfully blocking his uncle, Henry A. duPont, from beingreelected, Alfred duPont bought control of 9 Delaware newspapers. In 1932, on atrip to Egypt Alfred found a dog be named Mummy that was his familiar spirit. Inthe biography about Alfred which I read it said, \"Alfred had scored over hissister Marguerite. Let her collect Virginia ghosts if she wanted them. Only hehad a reincarnated Egyptian mascot who could produce wonders as great as thoseof Aladdin’s genie.\" (Alfred Du Pont by Joseph F. Wail, p. 593) Alfred L du Ponthimself wrote this in a letter to the Rev. Baker P. Lee (23 May ‘32) about hisfamiliar spirit, \"I have one or two more jobs for Mummy and then I will give hera vacation before I put her to work again.\" (He wrote at least one other letterwhere he talks about the magical powers of his dog. which was his familiarspirit. Mrs. Cazenove Lee, Jr. got a letter mentioning Mummy’s powers too.)Alfred died in 1935. Ed Bali and Jessie Ball du Pont (his widow) took overcontrol of his estate. Ed Bail increased the Alfred I. duPont’s fortune andbecame the most powerful man in Florida. Ed Bali’s wealth passed the Billiondollar mark in the 50s or 60s. In the late 1960s, political enemies were able toattack the wealth of Ed Ball with new legislation and some investigation of themisuse of his money hidden in the foundations. In 1981, Ed Bail died. in 1985,Ed Ball’s widow claimed that Ed’s sister Jessie had actually murdered Alfred I.duPont in 1935. She claimed that while Ed was alive she had been too afraid totell the truth about Alfred’s murder. Forbes magazine carried the story in Oct.,1965. T. Coleman duPont, went in business with President Taft’s brother CharlesP. (member of the Skull & Bones) in 1910 to build McAlpin Hotel in New YorkCity. (Taft’s other brother Horace was a member of the Order of Skull and Bones.In fact, the Taft family which dates back to Braintree Mass. in 1679, helpedstart the Skull & Bones Order and at least eight Tafts have been in the Order.)This was the first of a series of luxury hotels. Coleman bought New YorkEquitable Life Assurance Society, which was America’s largest insurance company.N.Y. Equitable Life Assurance Company undoubtedly brought Coleman in touch withother Illuminati elite. He belonged to the Rittenhouse in Philadelphia. He wasthe director of a number of things including the Union National Bank, inWilmington and the pres. of Central Coal & Iron Co. along with a few other coaland Iron companies. T. Coleman has been mentioned already in connection to theDu Pont Gunpowder Business, which he ran for a number of years as head honcho.During W.W. 1, the Du Ponts made a mint. The company had $9 million surplus inits treasury. The result was that Du Pont absorbed General Motors. The DuPontsalso went into the chemical business. The American government had seized theGerman Dye Trust, and the DuPonts were given their patents. The Du Ponts beganto build a great chemical empire on the synthetic, such as shatterproof glass,paints, rayon, nylon, dyes, photographic film, rubber, chemicals, drugs, etc.Only the Dow Chemical Company is any competition with the DuPont chemicaloperation. Alfred Victor duPont (Alfred I.’s son) served only as a private inthe marines during W.W. I and was on board several ships. And yet for somereason when W.W. 11 broke out, he was made a consultant to the Joint Chiefs ofStaff from 1943 to 1945. He was an Episcopalian.Emile Francis duPont (1898- ) graduated from Yale, like a number of duPontshave. He was important lay person within the Episcopal Church. Pierre SamuelduPont belonged to the American Philosophical Society. He also wears the rosetteof an Officier de Ia Légion d’ Honneur. (How or why he got this I haven’t foundout.) He was on Delaware’s State Board of Education, 1919 - 21 . He was thePresident of General Motors from 1920-23 when he turned it over to Alfred P.Sloan, Jr. Pierre Samuel started what is called \"the buddy system\" where DuPontand GM’s management worked together. DuPont saved GM from extinction after W.W.Iand has watched over GM since. Robert L duPont, Jr. is a research psychiatrist.He has done research at Harvard. He was the delegate for the US. at UnitedNations Commission on Narcotic drugs (1973-78). He is especially knowledgeableabout what drugs will do to a person, which le an area of his research. AndFrancis Marguerite du Pont (born 1944 in Duluth, Minn.) is deep into researchinto genetics. Those of us, who know what these people want to do, cringe whenwe see that some of the top genetic researchers are connected with Satanicfamilies. Every American almost every day uses a Du Pont product. When I beganlearning what the DuPont industries produce it is utterly astonishing. Anythingthat involves chemicals is under their production. Herbivores and fertilizersfor farming, cosmetics and nylons for women, chemicals for all types ofindustrial production, textiles of all kinds, cleaning fluids such as when youclothes are dry cleaned. The list can go on and on. Most of us are using DuPontproducts almost continuously all through the day! General Motors, the explosivesand gunpowder monopoly, the chemical monopoly (which its tens of thousands ofproducts) gives the duPonts enormous financial leverage. The DuPonts obviouslyare in close cooperation with the elite involved with oil-because so many oftheir products are derivatives of petroleum products. In 1940, it was estimatedthe duPont family was worth $5 billion. Today, their total worth must be manybillions of dollars, not to mention the enormous power they wield. The verysurvival of the United States military is dependent upon the military productsof the DuPonts.The Dupont Company Used as a Tool to Bring Us into The New OrderAlthough the DuPont companies -the principle DuPont company is E.L. DuPont DeNemours & Co (whose 1991 revenues were $38.7 billion)- are run by manyexecutives who are not duPonts, the duPont family does quietly pull the stringsin the background. Many of the executives are men whose philosophy of lifematches the duPonts. It is very clear that the DuPont companies are being usedin a big way to move us toward the New World Order. The first item on this,concerns how the Du Pont workers are being indoctrinated. I received a video ofthe Pecos River Training near Santa Fe, N.M. that DuPont workers in the east aresent to. I also looked at a magazine article about this training(indoctrination) in the article \"Go Take A Flying Leap (for the company)\"(Successful Meetings June 1992, pp.59-62). A Christian brother who works for theDuPonts in Tennessee has been secretly undermining the efforts of the DuPontcompany leaders to turn the workers into New Agers. With the help of Christiansin the plant, this Christian brother finds out what is planned, and then doeshis homework so that he can proof to the workers how New Age ideas are beingbrought in to subvert their thinking. The company changed from calling all itspeople \"employees\" to calling them initiates. The people at the plant were toall be sent to the Pecos River Training by DuPont, but due to the exposure oftheir New Age subversion, people are not allowing themselves to be led by thenose. This brother sent me a video of the Pecos River Training. and there arescenes in it where \"strangers\" are kissing each other-well, not exactlystrangers because the training is designed to break down individuality and tocreate a group think with intimacy. Initiates are taught “don’t slay the ego,ego is your servant.\" Another magazine article in (June 1992, p15-16) tellsabout the five type of thinking that the DuPont Company is trying to instill intheir people. They are: 1. lateral thinking; 2. metaphoric thinking; 3. positive thinking (this is also called visualization-or in the occult witchcraft); 4. association trigger; 5. rapturing and interpreting dreams.An employee environmental-awards program was installed where employees can winmoney by submitting their environmental suggestions. (Personal Journal Aug. ,92,pp 60-71.) Many of the readers of this newsletter are already aware of how theenvironmental issue is contrived and controlled by the elite. One of the itemsour new-agy Dept. of Education secretary Alexander tried to get going was foreducation to shift from the schools to the factories. This is a process that theIlluminati want to implement to further take us into a total slave state.Interestingly, DuPont has been getting into the act by spearheading Delaware’sBRT task force, in which students will attend seminars at Du Pont facilities.The DuPont Company is employing A.I.-that is artificial intelligence. The neuralnetworks are to the point they can learn from their mistakes. DuPont is takingus into Brave New World. They were the first ones to initiate with Fax NOW arapid customer service called fax-on-demand. Du Pont is now in the process ofbecoming totally global. They already have plants in a number of South Americancountries, Mexico, Canada, U.S., Korea, Japan; and several European nations.They have been trying to figure out how to enter the Commonwealth of IndependentStates (CIS--what used to be USSR). Apparently, they lost some money already inthat regards. The ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries- which is allied with theWarburg family) in England and DuPont swapped plants. Imperial ChemicalIndustries has had their headquarters in Wilmington, Del for some time beforethis swap. DuPont got ICI nylon plant, and ICI got DuPont acrylic plant in thestates. Why? So both companies could become more international. Or, in the wordsof someone else, to \"focus resources on businesses where each can developstronger global positions.\" (See Economist, 10/3/,92, p.76) The swap will giveDuPont 43% of the European market for nylon fibers used to manufacture carpets.Dupont has built a $20-million research center in Bad Homburg, Ger. DuPont hasbeen spending according to a recent article $1.27 billion on research. Some ofDu Pont’s research la in \"risky\" areas, which means that it is difficult to seehow the research can financially benefit the company. This has been admitted bythe company. The Aviation Week and Space Technology, 10/26/92 issue, p. 64,66 talks about thesophisticated composite materials that DuPont is producing for state of the artspace and aviation vehicles. (I imagine some of these composite materials arefinding their way to the secret UFO bases, and DuPont may well be producing someof the parts for these secret anti-gravity machines. The article states thatBoeing Defense and Space Group, Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., GeneralDynamics and DuPont and Hercules, Inc. are working together on aeronauticsprojects. Boeing and Lockheed are definitely involved with the production offlying saucers, so this may be a good due that DuPont is too. The article statesthat DuPont has been a leading supplier for advanced US military programs. Anexample of the sophisticated materials that the DuPonts are producing is XTC;the first recyclable, class-A finish thermoplastic sheet molding compound forhorizontal exterior body panels. It is a flexible, porous; interwoven sheet ofpolyethylene terephthalate-impregnated long-glass fiber. General Motors(DuPonts) selected the material for use on their air-intake manifold on certain1993 V-6 engines (Modern Plastics. \"Automotive Show Features Lots of ToughenedMaterials\", by Stuart A. Wood, April 1992 issue, pp 66-69.)The CEO of E.l. du Pont de Nemours & Co. is Edgar Woolard who took over in 1989.Edgar is innovative which will be beneficial in the '90s with all the upheavalscoming. One item that the Illuminati have planned is to put things into ourmajor city water supplies Interestingly, DuPont has research facilities and aChamber’s Work facility in Deepwater, New Jersey which both deal with watertreatment. The du Pont family today i represented at the sixth Illuminati level-the Pilgrim Society. I am convinced their power also run higher, but want morinformation/research to bring it out to the open. One book said that the duPonts were one of the top three influential families in the United States today.Whether one is aware of the secret Satanic power of the duPonts or not, it isinescapable to conclude that this family is exceedingly powerful in the UnitedStates beyond comprehension. Every facet of our lives is influenced by productswhose production is still ultimately under the control of the duPont family ofcontrol. For those people who subscribe to the theory that the world is dividedbetween only the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, look at the duPonts, who aretruly independent of the other top families dispels that theory. To quote KarlSchriftgiesser in his book Families \"...the Du Ponts of Delaware constitute adefinite dynasty perhaps the most complete dynast ever established in thisrepublic and one which seems destined to continue its kingship for generations Icome...Today there are seven hundred members of this family...Every time apackage of cigarettes is opened, the simple tearing of the tab is a gesture oftribute to the Du Ponts, and every time a great gun booms, with whatever cost tolife or property; it echoes merrily in the feudal stronghold of this mightyclan...We must end with the direct statement that the Du Ponts today ruleDelaware with an Iron hand, that their interests affect the daily lives of eachone of us in some way, and that the Family moves on.\"It is, today, the great American dynasty. Close, unassailed, it keeps toitself, hides its scandals, boasts not of its good works, but continues, withinAmerican democracy, to exert its own indomitable way.\"Review of SourcesMany key books used in preparing this article can be identified by thereferences in the text. About 120 magazine articles were reviewed, and many keyarticles used are identified in the text. Several confidential interviews werealso involved in developing the article, as well as the manuscript by anex-Mason and insider who the elite murdered.Check This Out!Several years ago, I developed a friendship with a man from Silverton. From thatfriendship I got the vibes that something was strange about Silverton, OR.Later, through my contacts, I found out that Anton LaVey’s church had set uptheir Oregon headquarters in Silverton. I suspect this was because Silverton hadsome occult activity already there. About 25 to 30 miles southeast of Silverton,Or is Mill City and Gates? The area between this is wooded and has beautifulfalls and a large park.Now the threads of this story return to Portland. A man who saw my book TheWatchtower & The Masons told me 2 years ago that be knew John Lawrence. He saidI and John would like to meet, and that he would arrange it. One of the weeklypapers here is the Willamette Weekly and they seem to be free of some of thestifling control of the New World Order in contrast to our daily paper TheOregonian. A research writer for the Willamette Weekly using John Lawrence’sresearch on the Skull & Bones Order wrote a long article in the WillametteWeekly about the Skull & Bones Order. John Lawrence and I would be a naturalshoe-in as Mends since we both investigate secret satanic groups. But the manwho knew John Lawrence always told me after promising to get us together thatJohn had disappeared. Not only that but this man’s original openness turned tonot wanting to have much to do with me, touching some type of very sensitivesecret. Here is what I have been able to find out. Several satanic groups are inthe Gates, OR area. John Lawrence was extremely interested in what the 322 ofthe Skull and Bones Society meant. He was convinced that number linked the Skull& Bones Society with other groups. John Lawrence and 2 other researchers likehimself moved to Mill City to investigate the secret satanic groups in the area.From someone from the inside it turns out that the CIA shot two of thoseresearchers while they were in the Mill City area investigating. The CIA wentlooking for John Lawrence. And John Lawrence is now in hiding. People in theMill City area were afraid to answer my questions. However, I was able to gleana little information with a great deal of effort. Some occult group bought aranch near Gates, OR. The head of the group is Jim Cole. They bought a ranch,which is not in Jim Cole’s name. The last police raid against any occultactivity was over five years ago, and it appears that the Satanists are in thekey positions in the Mill City and Gates. They may even have a person on thepolice force. The last obvious item to comment on is that for some reason, theCIA is very mixed up and sensitive about this occult activity. John Lawrence wasOne reaction to my duPont article was that someone whose mother-in-law works forthe duPonts in Pennsylvania asked a few questions and found out that hermother-in-law is an actual witch (I don’t mean as in an old hag--I mean is inwitchcraft.) This witch is close friends of the duPonts and has been protectedfrom being fired by the duPonts. What is most significant in this whole thing tome is that my article got other people cognizant of what happening so that theycould teach themselves. Once people begin to really catch on to things, theywill begin to detect things all around that are happening in regards to the NWO.Most Americans don’t have any frame of reference to hang any facts about theconspiracy. They bemoan the idea of a Satanic conspiracy, they claim there is noproof all the while it is all around them! For instance, did anyone catch whatBill Clinton did when he faced the people and waved at the inauguration? See thelast article in this newsletter for an answer. A friend called my attention toInside Edition’s television story on Lewis Dupont Smith, the heir to the $10million fortune of the Du Pont Chemical Co. Lewis Dupont Smith is exposing hisfamily. Of course on national television, which is controlled by the Illuminatithey are not going to do much exposing-but they did let a few hints get through.Lewis Dupont Smith did get a sentence left in what was shown on T.V. where hepoints the finger it \"powerful families\" as the culprits behind the drug trade.The reason be was allowed to voice this, was that Lewis was the person behindthe book Dope, Inc. and it was this involvement that got him in hot trouble withhis family. Lyndon LaRouche, who was truly exposing the Satanic conspiracy,wrote a good book Dope, Inc. The book exposes the Queen of England is aparticipant in the drug trade. Yes, the British Royal Family does tie in theelite, the occult, and the drug trade. They are not as nice is their picturessuggest. Lewis Dupont Smith, having a good feel for what is going on, recognizedthat Dope, Inc. is the (paraphrased) \"The only book showing the involvement ofpowerful families.\" Lewis provided the $212,000 for the book to be printed.(Good for him!) Let’s just make it plain, the Satanic hierarchy is behind thedrug problem. Lewis’ family was very upset that he was helping the enemy, andthey got a judge to rule that Lewis was incompetent to handle his financialaffairs, and the court declared that Lewis can have on $15,000 per/? of hisfortune. The duPonts also tried to stop his wedding. A federal informant savedLewis from getting captured and taken 60 miles into the Atlantic on his father’syacht to be tortured and programmed. His family had hired a motorcycle gang withblack hoods and some CIA-Green Beret types to kidnap Lewis. Lewis managed to getwind of the scheme and save himself. He tried to get his family on conspiracy tokidnap, but the duPont family bear in mind as one of the top 13 Illuminatifamilies owns justice in this country. He failed to get his family on theconspiracy charge.One detail that I didn’t mention in the original story on the duPonts was theone of the more recent Governors of Delaware C. Douglas Buck was married toAlice H. duPont. I also left out a great deal of the inside story on thepoliticking that has gone on in Delaware this century. It is so detailed with somany names that I didn’t want to confuse people with it. Anyway, the bottom lineis that behind the scenes, all of the Governors since the 1920s have beenapproved by the duPonts. I debated whether to include the du Ponts genealogy. Ihad it, so I decided to give it, on the chance someone might use it. Thegenealogy shows several things, a. that the duPonts like the Astors repeatedlyused the same names over and over, b, that the duPonts like the Rothschilds hada lot of first cousin marriages (marriages between a du Pont and a du Pont aregiven asterisks-however some of the marriages between people with different lastnames are also between first cousins and other relation. If it looks like I’vegone to a great deal of trouble for nothing-I can understand what you’re saying.We certainly don’t need to know every du Pont. But just like in a laboratory onedeals with many exact small details in numerous experiments to discover aprinciple-that is what I am doing here. I am trying to break ground so thatpeople will understand more about how the elite think, etc. I had hoped that Imight also be able to track which branches are with the Illuminati and which mayhave bailed out."},{"pageContent":" The Freeman BloodlineThe amazing thing about this family is that it is not a family that people wouldhave thought of as being one of the top thirteen; however, for me as aresearcher of the elite and the Satanic hierarchy, the name pops up withsurprising frequency. For instance, Stephen M. Freeman runs the Legal AffairsDept. of the Civil Rights Division of the Anti-Defamation League (which is adaughter of the B’nai B’rith). The ADL is a dangerous organization controlled bythe hierarchy. The illuminati drug money to fund this organization. AnotherFreeman is Walter Freeman who introduced the lobotomy into the U.S. with JamesW. Watts in 1936. The frontal lobotomy was a brutal method of mind control thathas been permitted to be done to us, under the disguise that it is of benefit tohumanity. Then there was Simon Freeman an important intelligence officer. Andthe list goes on of people that are in key places with the Freeman name. But themost important position of all which removes all doubt that the family is at thetop is that the late Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion was Gaylord Freeman. Independent Discoverers of the Prieure De Sion What is the “Prieure de Sion?” Are we sure it exists? How does this relate tothe hierarchy? The Prieure de Sion (Priory of Zion) was unknown to the generalpublic until 1982 when a book co-authored by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, andHenry Lincoln came out. The book was entitled Holy Blood, Holy Grail and itoffered historical proof that an organization called the Prieure de Sion waspowerful and had existed since the time of the early crusades (1099 A.D.). In1991, I came out a little more information on the Prieure de Sion. Theorganization is so little known to even my readership that we need to stop andreally examine the Prieure de Sion.In trying to figure out the mysteries surrounding this organization, Lincoln,Leigh and Baigent’s research led them to conclude that the holy bloodline thatthe Prieure de Sion guarded was the bloodline of Jesus. This immediately madeall their research anathema (condemned and disliked) by the most of Christendom.I watched to see if Christians would refute the unbiblical parts of theirresearch, but besides a couple of short articles (Christian Century, 9/1-8/82, -\"Raiders of the Lost Grail\" and Christianity Today, 9/3/82 - \"Holy Blood, HolyGrail - holy mackerel\") in Christian periodicals (in addition to this was asmall book in England- The Holy Grail Revealed) which simplistically claimedthat the book was of no value because obviously it was erroneous, no one evenpretended to try to refute the book (as far as I know except for that Englishbook which did pretend but didn’t refute anything.) The authors went on to writetwo more popular historical exposes concerning the Prieure de Sion andFreemasonry (The Messianic Legacy and The Temple and The Lodge). Actually to befair to the Christians, if I hadn’t already known from my research that much ofthe European information in Holy Blood. Holy Grail was correct, the wildreligious speculation about Jesus in Part 3 may have caused me to doubt the booktoo. The first Christian author to pick up on the Prieure de Sion was J.R.Church who wrote Guardians of the Grail which built on Holy Blood. Holy Grail’sresearch in a constructive way and put more pieces of the puzzle together. Atlast a book was out that challenged some of the false ideas of Holy Blood, HolyGrail without blindly throwing their excellent research. While the public atlarge had never heard of the Prieure de Sion until Holy Blood. Holy Grail cameout, the organization was written about in high level military intelligencebriefings years before the book. Some of the men in high level intelligence havebecome concerned with the direction this nation is going. It is through such menthat independent confirmation had leaked out even before the book. Theinformation did get to some researchers. I came out with my Be Wise As Serpentsbook in 1991, which among other things covered the Prieure de Sion, after I hadconcluded that the evidence verified its existence.I approached the issue from my own angle of research. In researching theIlluminati it became clear that 1. bloodlines were very important; 2. the people in high level Satanism believe they are descendants of the House of David; 3. the Illuminati’s activities tied in in many ways to the Prieure de Sion.One startling tie in was that the Freeman family was, according to an informant,one of the top 13 Illuminati families. The ex-Illuminati people I receivedinformation from were not familiar with Holy Blood, Holy Grail nor Guardians ofthe Grail. Even if they had, which they definitely hadn’t, neither book mentionsthe Freeman family. It wasn’t until the researchers of Holy Blood, Holy Grailwrote their sequel The Messianic Legacy that was published in 1987 that the nameFreeman came out as the leader of the Prieure de Sion. In short the way theresearch of mine and others simultaneously from different angles came upindependently with similar conclusions using totally different sources confirmsbeyond a doubt that the Prieure de Sion exists, and that the Freeman family isindeed a very powerful family. I have never spelled out in detail nil the proofsabout the Prieure de Sion and the Freeman family, and even now I am not goingto. To me the basics are facts, and I don’t want to get bogged down trying toprove the obvious, when there is so much more to learn. There are stubbornpeople whose minds will not come along no matter how much proof andencouragement. They will just have to stay where they are.Describing the Prieure De SionThe original start of the Prieure de Sion appears to have been the idea of anumber of powerful bloodlines, and included various descendants of theMerovingians, including the House of Lorraine, the House of Guise, the Medicis,Sforzas, the Estes, the Gonzagas, and the St. Clairs (Sinclairs). The Medicisare tied to the Black Nobility also. From the beginning the Prieure de Sion hasbeen committed to Hermetic Magic (a type of black magic that originated with theancient Egyptians and is portrayed in the Egyptian Book of the Dead.) René d’Anjou, a descendent of the Merovingians, persuaded Cosimo de Medici to establishin c. 1444 a non-church library at San Marco where Plato, Pythagorean works, andbooks on Hermetic Magic were translated. Up until this time, the Catholic Churchhad control of all the libraries. It was from Cosimo dé Medici’s library thatthe spark of Greek and Egyptian teachings set off what developed into theRenaissance, which was revival of humanism and the occult. It appears thatduring the Middle Ages, witchcraft and the mystery religions had seriouslydissolved to the point that these modes of thought had to be relearned from theancientwritings. Interestingly, the Middle Ages when witchcraft and paganism weredissolving have been branded the “Dark Ages” by the establishment, andinaccurately painted as a time when learning went out.. A magazine put outduring W.W. II by Prieure de Sion members was Vaincre. The organization thattook credit for the magazine was Alpha Galates. It carried articles on Atlantis,theosophy, Celtic wisdom, and other esoteric things. The magazine also declareditself in favor of a United Europe. Robert Schuman who was associated with themagazine Vaincre, later become a leading architect of the EEC. An internalmagazine for Prieure de Sion members is CIRCUIT (the acronym for Chivalry ofCatholic Rules and Institutions of the Independent and Traditionalist Union. A1956 issue of CIRCUIT promotes the use of a 13-sign zodiac rather than thetraditional 12. The1959 series of CIRCUIT refer the reader to Vaincre. The CIRCUIT magazine whichclaims to write its articles with ‘hidden meaning,” says this cryptically aboutthe Prieure de Sion, \"We are not strategists nd we stand above all religiousdenominations, political perspectives and financial matters. We give to thosewho come to us moral aid and the indispensable manna of the spirit.\" Anotherarticle says, \"...except through new methods and new men, for politics are dead.The curious fact remains that men do not wish to recognize this. There existsonly one question: economic organization.\" Dr. Otto von Hapsburg, a descendentof the Merovingians, and a Knights of Malta, headed Pan-Europa, an organizationthat has been working toward a U.S. of Europe. Their logo was a Celtic cross ina circle. The first point in time that the Prieure de Sion can be pinpointed iswhen Jerusalem was captured by the Crusaders and an abbey of monks that Peterthe Hermit had belonged to was established in a building called the Abbey ofNotre Dame de Mont de Sion just outside of Jerusalem. This abbey had an orderthat was called the Ordre de Sion. Over the centuries the Ordre de Sion hasdeveloped into what we have today as the Prieure de Sion (Priory of Zion inEnglish). Bear in mind that the Ordre of Sion was visible for several centuriesbut has been totally secret after the 13th century. It became semi-visibleduring the 1960s and 70s and became secret again in 1984. The group of monksthat made up the original order were led by Ursus of the Merovingians. They weregiven a place at Orval in France until they apparently decided to move to theHoly Land. This order appears to have had the power behind the scenes to havebeen in the position to select who would sit on the throne at Jerusalem, and theinitially selected their man Godfroi de Bouillon. The Ordre de Sion (Prieure deSion) set up a military order called the Knights Templar. Louis VII of Francebecame indebted to the Knights Templar, and in repayment of the help he hadreceived he established some of the Ordre de Sion at the priory of St. Samson,along with establishing 26 men (2 groups of 13) at a small priory at the Mountof Sion, Orleans, France. In 1188, the Ordre de Sion let the Knights Templarsapparently go their own way, which eventually was to trouble. The story of theKnights Templars is exceedingly interesting because it relates to the SatanicInternational Bankers of today. The Knights Templars became the first Europeanwide International Bankers.How their story fits into everything would take to long to tell at this point.At that time period when the Knights Templars took off on their own, the Ordrede Sion became the Prieure de Sion, and also used the names Ormus andRose-Croix, The Prieure de Sion is intimately connected to the creation andguidance of the Rosicrucians and Freemasons. In the Be Wise As Serpents book,chapter 12 it talks about how the Prieure de Sion set up the Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry.In 1613, the House of Lorraine (part of the Prieure de Sion) joined with theHouse of Stuart. After that the Prieure de Sion began to display more interestin Scotland. Scotland was one of the few countries where the Knights Templarshad thrived when the order was suppressed by the order of the Pope. Scotlandalso had several occult traditions operating. It was a hotbed of occultactivity. Scotland and the Scottish people have played a very big role in theNew World Order conspiracy for centuries. Meanwhile, when the Prieure de Sionwent underground they established their archives in some secret rooms beneaththe chapel of St. Catherine, at the castle at Gisors, northern France in the ruede Vienne. The archives were, according to reports, contained in 30 coffers.Secret tunnels connect the chapel with the local cemetery. The Merovingiandescendants and the Prieure de Sion have guarded the sacred blood line thatSatan has built up. Their members are secretly scattered in key positionsthroughout society. Many of the descendants are unaware of their heritage. Forinstance, within the Sinclair family only certain branches have kept up theirgenerational occult heritage, and are aware of what is going on. Family treessubdivide over the centuries until the Merovingian family tree has become aforest. The Houses of Hapsburg-Lorraine (whose titles are dukes of Lorraine andKings of Jerusalem), Plantard, Luxembourg, Montpezat, Montesquiou, among manyothers including the Freeman family, and hundreds of others. Be Wise As Serpentsrevealed for the first time (as far as I know) how all the heads (presidents) ofthe LDS and RLDS have been descendants of the Merovingian dynasty, and they andthe Masons have both used the Merovingian symbol, the bee.The House Of DavidIn my research of high level Satanists, it became clear the bloodline that waskey in their minds was the House of David--not Jesus Christ’s lineage. Idiscovered that the House of David had set up a Kingdom in southern France. Idiscovered this while rummaging through history books on the Middle Ages. I cameupon a book A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France 768-900. This book was the keyfor me to realize that the Merovingian dynasty which wove its bloodline into theroyal bloods of Europe was Jewish in origin. When I read Holy Blood Holy Grail,it became apparent that the authors theory of Jesus’ bloodline had clouded theirrealization that the key was that the Prieure de Sion was of the House of Davidand was in this sense Jewish (although most of the Prieure de Sion are mostlikely not attending synagogues). Indeed the Grand Master of the Prieure de SionPierre Plantard de Saint-Clair told them so much. To quote the pertinentparagraph from The Messianic Legacy, p. 296, \"At our meeting in April, 1982, M.Plantard adopted an ambivalent attitude towards our book [Holy Blood, HolyGrail]. On the whole, be endorsed it and offered to correct, for the Frenchedition, certain vague or unclear references. At the same time, he would neitherconfirm nor deny our thesis that the Merovingian bloodline was descended fromJesus. There was no evidence either way, he said noncommittedly. It was “all toofar in the past,” all “too long ago.” There were no reliable genealogies.Besides, Jesus had brothers. Nevertheless, he acknowledged the Merovingians tohave been of Judaic descent, deriving from the royal line of David.\" Thesignificance of this is tremendous. It means that those people who have beensaying that it is a Jewish conspiracy have been correct--even if some of thesepeople saying these things may not be greatest characters. This also opens thedoor as to why the top leaders of the Illuminati have been willing to work withthe Askenazi Jews. In Be Wise As Serpents, I show from Masonic sources thatthere is indeed a big connection at the top with the Jewish leadership and theHouse of David and Freemasonry. The goals of Freemasonry are intertwined withthe goals of the Prieure de Sion. There is a big danger in labelling theconspiracy \"Jewish\". When people label \"Jewish\" as \"bad\" it confuses more thanclarifies. The Jewish people are not the enemy. Next, although many of theSatanic hierarchy claim to be from the House of David, they do not publiclyproclaim themselves as Jews, in fact they may publicly take a negative posturetoward the Jews, such as Lady Astor and some of the duPonts have been.It is perhaps fine that Zionism be labelled evil. Zionism includes bothChristians and Jews. To be a Zionist is to identify oneself with a movement thatthe elite has set up and controlled for their purposes. Many in the Zionistmovement are like common people everywhere, they want do to what is right, theyhave simply not gotten the bigger picture, and are being used. When two groupshave some similarities but each want to keep their own identity they can bemortal rivals. One group that has been very easy for Satan to provoke againstChristians is the Jews. Perhaps no group of people has hated Christians withmore intensity. One of the first groups that Satan worked at controlling werethe Jews. But to call the conspiracy Jewish is misleading. The father of it allis Satan. It is Satanic, and it will use anyone it can. And God will use anyonetoo. How many of us have escaped helping one cause or another of theestablishment or in being in some organization that the establishment was using?Let each of us examine ourselves and get our own lives in order. There is a songabout violin that was going to auctioned off cheap until a master violinistpicked it up and played a good tune on it. Don’t auction people off cheaply, thetouch of the Master’s hand can turn anyone into a beautiful thing. Don’t rejectanyone who will let the Master’s hand tune his life. This is a war against evil,not race. Not everyone of the most evil bloodlines is on the enemies’ side. Manyare trying to serve the Lord. Likewise, just because the Freeman family is oneof the top 13 Satanic families doesn’t mean that all or even most Freemans arepart of the hierarchy.Gaylord Freeman as Grand MasterFrom 1918 to 1963, Jean Cocteau was Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion.Following the unification of the various powers into a secret NWO government in1954, the Prieure de Sion had a major policy dispute. in 1963 with Cocteau’sdeath, Gaylord Freeman, helped by Antonio Merzagora and Pierre Plantard deSaint-Clair, governed the Prieure de Sion. In 1981, Pierre Plantard took over asGrand Master. In 1952, long before becoming Grand Master, Plantard deSaint-Clair transferred 100 million francs worth of gold ingots to Switzerlandto the Union des Banques Suisses. When this was publicly revealed, he said thatit was a legitimate move made for the French government. In 1955, several menassociated with the Prieure de Sion obtained some old parchments two of whichgave the Merovingian genealogies, and they used the British Notary of RoyalAppointment Patrick Francis Jourdan Freeman (that’s one name) in relation to arequest to the French government to take the old documents to London, Englandwhere they were kept at 39 Great Russell St. Later P.F.J. Freeman was used againthe next year to request that the documents be allowed to stay in England to beheld in a safe deposit box at Lloyd’s Bank of Europe in London. One of the meninvolved went by the name Captain Ronald Stansmore Nutting of London (born inDublin, IR) who is reported by reliable sources to have been in BritishIntelligence MI5, and had sat on the board of directors of at least 14companies, including Arthur Guinness and Guardian Assurance. He was chairman ofthe board of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company. He was also governor ofthe Bank of Ireland. One of Guardian Assurance’s departmental chairmen was alsoan MIS operative besides Capt. Nutting. Another P.d.S. member who was withNutting was Viscount Frederick Leathers, who was British Minister of WarTransport during W.W. II. Viscount Leathers had a business associate andlongtime friend Sir WilliamStephenson, who was the wartime chief for MI6’s American branch office calledBSC (British Security Coordination) in New York. Another friend of Leathers wasConnop Guthrie also headed BSC for MI-6 in New York. Guthrie was a shippingexecutive. Due to internal trouble in the Prieure de Sion that resulted from arule that members had to place a birth certificate and signature with thePriory, an English faction created forgeries of birth certificates andsignatures and in secret protest sent these as originals to France. PJ. Freemanthen got involved in this act of defiance. Another division occurred between theFrench members and the British-American members. The French wanted more of arole and some type of restoration of the monarchy in a United Europe. TheAmerican.-British members who far outnumbered the few French wanted to skip themonarchy idea. The Vatican and the Prieure de Sion (P.d.S. - my personalabbreviation) work together. Apparently, the Vatican is given some type of minorkickback for their cooperation. John Drick, A. Robert Abboud, and GaylordFreeman were three members of the Prieure de Sion that were associated with theFirst National Bank of Chicago. John Drick had started as an assistant cashierin 1944 and became a vice-president three years later. In 1969 Drick became boththe president and one of the directors of the bank. He also was on the board ofa number of other companies including, Stephan Chemical, MCA incorporated, OakIndustries, and Central Illinois Public Service. The Guardian Royal ExchangeAssurance (the Guardian Assurance) in London where P.J. Freeman worked hadshared a building with the First National Bank of Chicago which had GaylordFreeman as chairman of the board of directors. In other words, the twobusinesses and the two Freemans all connected its seems to the Prieure de Sion,and then by other inferences all connected back to the hierarchy. GaylordFreeman’s signature appeared on a Prieure de Sion document of Dec. 16, 1983.Gaylord Freeman never publicly admitted that he even knew anything about theP.d.S.Grand Master Gaylord Freeman and Roger Freeman Instructed the U.S. GovernmentOn the next page is a photocopy of the article that the New York Times ran whenGaylord (Gale) Freeman died. It has often been said if you want to know whoreally runs things, look at a man’s advisors. Now check this out, GaylordFreeman never ran for any major political office--and the voting process issupposedly to get men who know what they are doing into once, and yet if youread the N.Y. Times biography you will read \"Mr. Freeman...was frequently calledon by Washington for advice and assistance.’ Yes, Presidents and Congressmancalled Gaylord Freeman for advice (instructions might be a better term), and yetmost of us haven’t even heard of the man! Again for those who think that onlythe Rockefellers and Rothschilds are powerful families, let me ask, why weren’tthey calling Rockefeller? Not only did the Presidents turn to Gaylord Freemanfor advice (orders), they also turned to another member of the family, Roger A.Freeman. Roger A. Freeman was a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute. (Isuspect Roger was Jewish but the newspaper doesn’t say any religion.) The NewYork Times biographical news article that came out when Roger died is also puton the next page. Note that in the headline they emphasize that Roger Freemanplayed the role as advisor to 2 presidents. And yet I doubt that hardly anyAmerican has heard of him. One prominent Freeman, James D. Freeman has played aleadership role in Unity School. James Freeman has written at least siximportant books for Unity which they have published. Two of his works are UnitySchool and The Story of Unity. Had the article on spiritual warfare coveredritual sites in Kansas-Missouri I would have mentioned about the Unity School.Near (adjoining) the Unity School, in between Kansas City, Ks. and Kansas City,Mo. is a strip of wooded land. Little Ricky Rd. goes through this area, and theforest along Little Ricky Rd. has been used for Satanic rituals by a coven thatwas made up of adults not teenagers-Interestingly, a man who was part of theUnity School hierarchy, and came to Christ told me that the school secretlyconducted Luciferian initiations and that Robert Schuler, 33° Mason, and leadingProtestant clergyman knew all about Luciferian initiations being conductedthere, yet Schuler went ahead and taught his principles of church growth toUnity School. They call the school Unity School of Christianity but a moreaccurate name would be Unity School of Witchcraft. Many witches have in factbeen associated with the Unity Church and are closely working with it tosecretly destroy Christianity. I know from inside information that the hierarchyis sending orders to the school, so it would not surprise me if James D. Freemanwas actually part of the Freeman family that is one of the top 13 Illuminatifamilies. Some of the family are clearly Jewish, such as Ernest Robert Freeman,who lives in Maryland and is an important Jewish leader. He has been the dlr. ofthe Jewish Community Council in his area, and President of the Sachs/FreemanAssoc. The Sachs family also ties into the conspiracy so that is interesting.And Grace Freeman, who is Jewish, wrote Inside the Synagogue. Some of theFreemans are leaders in Christendom too. Lee Jackson Freeman is an AmericanBaptist minister. He went to Union Theological Seminary, which is a totallyungodly place--they turn out socialists for graduates, etc. Lee Jackson Freemanwas a member of the executive board of the national ministries of the AmericanBaptist Church. He also served in the Ecumenical Ministries in his Scranton, PAarea. R. Lexie Freeman is a Nashville, Tenn. Methodist pastor (Waverly Place)who is a Freemason.Origins of The FamilyThere are obviously different unrelated family lines that have the last nameFreeman. In the preliminary genealogical work that I have done I have foundFreemans coming from England, France, Germany and Austria. Howard L. Freeman isa Christian author, who has written about how the economic system of our nationis ungodly. I wrote him a letter of inquiry about the Freeman family. He wroteme and told me that his family came from the English town of Barnstaple, andthat the Freemans in that area treated him as a royal guest when he visited thearea. He was shown around England over a 50 mile radius by the Freemans inEngland. His opinion was that his last name did not originate in Barnstaple,England. The history books record an M.P. (Member of Parliament) back in thetimes when our revolution was being plotted who was named Sambrooke Freeman (c.1721-82). He was from Fawley Court, near Henley, in Berkshire. He went toOxford. I do not know if the Freemans in Moriah (the Illuminati) are fromEngland originally, but from the little clues I have that would be my firstguess--if not England, then likely France. Mary Freeman of Marlborough,Wiltshire, England claimed back in 1988 that on 7/13/88, almost at midnight,that she, Mary Freeman, was leaving the ancient Druid stone circle at Aveburywhen she saw a UFO over Silbury Hill. Most people are interested In her UFOreport—I’m curious why this Freeman lady was out late at night at some ancientDruid site.ILLUMINATI & SATANISMDue to time restraints, I haven’t progressed as far in my research as I wouldlike. However, I have been able to identify one Freeman in the Illuminati. Hewas Minnesota’s Gov. Orville Freeman who appointed Walter Mondale to theposition of Attorney General when Walter was just 32 years old. Walter Mondalelater enjoyed the status of being the only U.S. Senator on the TrilateralCommission. Walter Mondale went on to serve the Illuminati as U.S.Vice-president and Orville Freeman was appointed as a cabinet member forKennedy’s and then Johnson’s administration. Another Freeman is listed on secretmembership lists as joining the Order of Skull & Bones in 1869. See his picturewhich is reproduced. Don Freeman wrote books on witches, including Space Witch,and Tilly Witch. Another Freeman was instrumental in the O.T.O. being set up.For those who know about the O.T.O. (I’ve mentioned it in the past) it ishermetic magic and Satanism. Right here in Oregon, we have been watching someFreemans, because it appears that there are some Satanic coven members here inOregon who are Freemans.Freeman Family Writes BooksIt is interesting to look at some of the titles that various Freemans haveauthored. Here is a sampling-- see if some of these don’t sound like the authorscould be potential candidates for being in a coven. * Martin Freeman--Forecasting Astrology (plus several other astrology books) * Richard B. Freeman--The Overeducated American * Michael Freeman--Cohabitation Without Marriage * Lucy Freeman--Listening to the Inner Self * Kathleen Freeman--books on the Greeks’ philosophy * A.V. Freeman--International Responsibility of States for Denial of Justice * Harold Freeman--Toward Socialism In America * Jo Freeman- books promoting ‘2omen’s Liberation\" such as Politics of Women’s Liberation and Women: a Feminist Perspective * David F. Freeman wrote a Handbook on Private Foundations. That’s interesting because if anyone is skilled in creating foundations, especially private ones, it’s the Illuminati.The Freeman family includes many lawyers, doctors, and psychiatrists. Some ofthe Freeman scientists are studying areas that are interesting. A.J. Freemanwrote on his area of expertise Magnetoelectric Interaction Phenomena inCrystals. Sounds like a subject people interacting with the UFOs might study.Ties to Other Important FamiliesPart of what I can do for the reader is to begin to give him or her a feel forhow the Freeman family connects into the rest of things. This next section’sinformation will include information that only tangentially relates to theFreemans, but is important to place them in the context of what is happeningback stage out of the sight of the world’s eyes. The Freemans in the Satanichierarchy in the U.S. work with the Illuminati families of the Collins andWheeler families. Readers are already familiar with the Collins family, but notthe Wheelers. Now let me explain who the Wheelers are, because I am trying toput some pieces of the puzzle in place for you. Gen. Earl Wheeler and hisbrother Leo Wheeler, a Grande Master of the Illuminati (see the top diagram pg.14 1/1/93 newsletter), are secret Satanists and also 33° Freemasons. LeoWheeler, by virtue of his Grande Master status in the satanic hierarchy has beenable to visit the Dulce, N.M. underground facility. The route he used was to flyin, and then the last stretch is done in a black limousine. Various people inthe Dulce area have occasionally spotted these VIP black limousines. The Wheelerfamily has a long history of involvement with Satanism, and its genealogicalhistory goes back to the House of David. An amazing clue (or an amazingcoincidence) appears when we look at the genealogy of the Mormon leaders. (TheBe Wise As Serpents book makes the connections of the Mormon leadership but itdoesn’t appear that many have read or understood the significance. Maybe thishere will help.) The top Mormon leadership (LDS & RLDS) all are related anddescendants of the Merovingians, but for sake of discussion let us take BrighamYoung. Brigham Young’s first name was Brigham. It was given to him because ofthe importance of the Brigham family. His grandmother was Sibil Brigham. Sibylswere prophetesses of the ancient world, and the name is a semi-common occultname. Brigham Young and his family practiced magic. They were also intimatelyaware of their genealogy, which goes back to the Merovingian Dynasty! Onewonders if it is coincidence that the Merovingians’ primary symbol--the bee isalso the symbol for the Mormon church and Utah. Look at a Deseret Industries(Mormon thrift stores) building in your area and you will see the bee on theirside. But not only does Brigham Young have Merovingian blood from at least twolines of blood (and possibly as many as 6 lines of blood back), but he also isrelated to the Collins family of Massachusetts that we wrote about in the 2/1/93newsletter. Further, Brigham Young is also a blood relative of the Wheelers.This is the clue which is amazing. A. chart of all this is given on the nextpage. If Young’s Wheeler relatives are related to the Satanic IlluminatiWheelers, then we have an example of how 3 strains of top Satanic blood haveinterwoven and resulted in the birth of the Freemason, Witch, and President ofthe LDS Brigham Young. Perhaps the tie-in doesn’t exist, but it certainly isworthy of our examination.Digressing About the Mormon ConnectionThere may be some disinformation put out on this by the other side after thiscomes out--so don’t be taken in by their establishment. As I have mentionedbefore, a descendent of Joseph Smith, Jr. who was Satanic Ritually Abuse victim,has quietly told certain people that her family is indeed a Satanic bloodline.Further, I have mentioned other confidential pieces of information about how theleaders of the Salt Lake City Mormon church (LDS) are working with the variousparts of the Illuminati’s empire, incl. the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Although thepublic split occurred between Mormonism and Masonry before the Mormons went toUtah, that was only for public consumption. The leadership has coordinatedactivities. The Mormon religion is really a high rite of Freemasonry, and thisexplains why when the Mormons went to Utah, the Mormons held Masonic schools.(Hosea Stout mentions these Mormon Masonic schools in On The Mormon Frontier;The Diary of Hosea Stout, ed. by Juanita Brooks, 2 vols., Salt Lake City: Univ.of Utah Press, 1964, 2: 415, 423.) After going to Utah, Brigham Young contactedthe chiefs of Freemasonry in England and proposed that Mormonism be granted apublic charter to become its own Masonic Rite. The hierarchy told him no. Afterthat Brigham Young began to publicly distance Mormonism from Masonry, and theMasons strangely broke many of their own rules to distance themselves publiclyfrom Mormonism.LDS apostle Reed Smoot was given permission to run for office by the LDS church.Pres. Harding appointed him to the World War Foreign Debt Commission, and healso served the elite as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. The WarFinance Corp. just happened due to Smoots arranging it to give the LDS church a$10 million loan. Marriner S. Eccles, of an old elite family, and a Mormon (andan Illuminatus) became Sec. of the Treasury in 1934, and was chairman of theFederal Reserve Board from ‘34-51. Ezra Taft Bensen, later the LDS President,was appointed Sec. of Agriculture. David B. Haight, a prominent Mormon was madethe head of all the Mayors in the San Francisco area--the full title is\"governor of the San Francisco Bay Area Council of Mayors.\" Mormon Charles C.Cox was put in charge of the Securities and Exchange as commissioner; I could goon listing some other Mormons who have been placed in key establishmentpositions. Why? Why are the Illuminati and their establishment not afraid ofthese Mormons who have leadership positions in the LDS church? This is a wholearea I would love to explain but as this article is digressing from theFreemans, I need to return to subject being considered. The Lords of Anjou (partof the P.d.S.) were Plantagents and so was one of Brigham Young’s ancestors. ifwe go back through the Goddard and Gifford family ancestors. I am trying to getmy readers to look behind the curtain of organizations that we publicly, and tosee what is going on back stage. And then I am trying to show how the peopleback stage are related and know it.SUMMARYWe find the Freeman family popping up as t be Grand Master of the Prieure deSion, as a co-founder of the O.T.O., as a member of the Skull & Bones, as apowerful ADL member, as members of Satanic covens, and as authors. of occultbooks, as well as other suspicious things. It also should be mentioned that twoof the Freemans have been very important advisors to the U.S. Presidents andmany other high political leaders. The Freeman family has all the earmarks ofbeing one of the top 13 Illuminati families as my confidential sources reveal.More on The FreemansIn 1991. Pulitzer prize winner James B. Stewart, the front page editor of theWall Street Journal, came out with his book Den of Thieves. The book is thedetailed story of how major insiders on Wall Street were systematic crooks. Thefour biggest names of the insider-trading ring were Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky,Martin Siegel, and Dennis Levine. Robert Freeman worked with the ring, and endedup pleading guilty after the evidence cornered him. I am always suspicious ofexposes of the establishment done by the establishment’s system. Often, the bigcrooks get away and the middle management take the blame. Take for instance,Iran-Contra. But Stewart’s book Den of Thieves may be helpful in ourunderstanding the Freeman family better. The Freeman family is one of the top 13Illuminati families. At this time, there is nothing to tie Robert Freeman toSatanism, and that is not the purpose here. In an investigation, all thepossible clues are collected. I am bringing my readership into thisinvestigation of the top 13 families, and here is a possible suspect to makenote of. Robert Freeman worked for the Jewish investment firm of Goldman, Sachs.Goldman, Sach’s headquarters. in on Broad St. In NY, NY. Just a short distancefrom Goldman, Sach’s trading floor in their headquarters building on theglass-enclosed 29th floor was Robert Freeman’s office. Robert Freeman was agraduate of Dartmouth. He liked to vacation in Colorado skiing with his family.He worked with Siegel and Boesky especially in his illegal insider deals. Theseinsiders made millions off investors and would have made billions if they hadn’tbeen arrested. Freeman and Siegel made some complicated deals such as the Unocaland the Storer affairs. Boesky went to Russia after prison and offered hisfinancial talents but was politely rebuffed. One of the men involved with thering was Milken. Milken’s influence had been a major factor behind the stockmarket recovery after Black Monday, 1987. That was Monday, Oct. 19, and thestock market plunged over 500 pts. that day. Milken convinced investors toinvest in the stock market, and the Federal Reserve flooded the market with cashtoo to prevent a disaster. Milken was (& maybe still is) a close friend of MasonJessie Jackson. Milken is heralded by many prominent Jews even after his arrestas a great Jew. That’s not my opinion; a newspaper article will back that up.The Drexel firm associated with Milken was advised by the Federal Reserve, theSEC, the Treasury, and the Stock Exchange to declare bankruptcy with Chapter 11,which they did. Goldman and Sachs, both Jews, went to bat for Freeman, and hiredprivate detectives to help his case. Kaye, Scholar in NY represented Freemanlegally. Eventually Robert Freeman pleaded guilty and was given a four-monthsentence which he served and was released on Aug. 30, 1990. The significant partis that Robert Freeman was someone who was one of the major players in the NewYork Stock Exchange. Robert Freeman is not to be confused with Ernest RobertFreeman who also is connected to the Sachs family, and was mentioned In theoriginal article on the Freeman family (Mar. 15, 1993)"},{"pageContent":" The Kennedy BloodlineTo be a researcher and to be informed that the Kennedy family is a top 13Illuminati family is akin to being told a needle is in a haystack. Someone hasestimated that there are 200,000 Kennedys in the United States. And on a list ofthe most populous surnames of Ireland in 1890, Kennedy ranked 17th. And a recentbook listed it as 16th most common today. Fortunately, there is information thatallows me to identify at least part of the Satanic Kennedys from all the rest ofthe Kennedys. You will learn some of this later in the article.Kennedy Ties to Other Elite FamiliesAgain the ties between various Illuminati families is very involved, and a longunraveling process, similar to untying a set of bad knots confronts theresearcher. The Kennedy family abounds with marriages to names such asAnketells, Baileys, Booths, Buckleys, Collins, Hatfields, Humphreys, Freemans,James, Phelps, Reagans, Russells, and Smiths. The Kennedys that we will lookclosest at are related to the Fitzpatricks, a powerful Irish family whose coatof arms has 3 fleur-de-lis with a dragon and a lion. (The Fitzpatricks may tieback to France, and they may possibly part of the Sang Royal (Sangraal--SangRaal is the term used in the older manuscripts which can mean both Royalbloodline or Holy Grail.) Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis who married John F.Kennedy was tied to the Auchinclosses via her sister’s marriage into theAuchincloss family. The Auchinclosses are Scottish bloodline of the Illuminati.\"One can fairly hear the woof and tweet of history whistle through the names ofthe ramified Auchincloss tribe: Bunt, Grosvenor, Rockefeller, Saltonstall,Tiffany, Vanderbilt and Winthrop among others.\" For instance, Hugh D.Auchincloss, Sr. married Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver B. Jennings,who co-founded Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller. As for the numerousKennedy intermarriages with notable names, for instance, Bernet Shafer Kennedy(1798-1878) married Phebe Freeman in 1820. But then the question arises--wereeither of these people secretly part of the occult? Andrew Kennedy marriedMargaret (Penny) Hatfield (1824-1989). The Andrew Kennedy family is allied withthe Hatfield, Bailey, Collins, and Mullins families. Again a person isconfronted with a great deal of clues, but precious little time and resources totry following up the numerous leads.Origins of the Family & the Relationship of the KennedysThere are several versions of how the Kennedys got started, but when one goes inand examines things, what turns out is that the origins of the Kennedys isIreland are very clear. They are descendants of Brian Born (also known as BrianCaeneddi) and his nephew who spelled it ‘Cinneide.’ The name thereafter wasO’Kennedy. They originally were a Dalcassion sept, and were in the area nearKillahoe, and Killokennedy parish is a reminder of that ancient fact. TheO’Briens and MacNamaras forced them into new territories where they became theLords of Ormond--what is now north Tipperary. Most Kennedys in Ireland today arestill found in that area. The Kennedys remained powerful into the 16th century.The Kennedy family divided up into 3 branches: 1. Don (brown) 2. Fionn (fair) 3. Rua (red)The Scottish KennedysAround 1600 a Scottish branch of the Kennedys appeared. There are severalstories as to how they got their name Kennedy, and it is possible that they werenot from Ireland. However, interestingly, genealogists have ascertained thatwhether the various branches of the aristocratic Kennedys in Scotland andIreland may have different origins (because the origins of the Scottish branchis unclear)--it can be shown that they all subsequently intermarried and becamerelated if they were not related to begin with. Gayle Marie Kennedy points thisout on page 3 of her book My Kennedy Ancestors..., ‘It is believed that all theforegoing Kennedy families are related either by virtue of being descendants ofcommon ancestors, or by intermarriage.\" I looked up in Burke’s General Armory toget a listing of the aristocratic Kennedys and here is what I got: * Kennedys of Ardmillan, County Ayr, Scotland * Kennedys of Auchtyfardell, County Lanark, 1752 * Kennedys of Blairquhan, County Ayr, Scotland * Kennedys of Clowburn. County Ayr, Scotland * Kennedys of Cultura, County Down, Northern Ireland * Kennedys of Dublin Fun Ent, 1595, Ulster, Ireland * Kennedys of Girvanmains, County Ayr, Scotland * Kennedys of Hill Foot, Ireland * Kennedys of Kirkmiehael, County Ayr, Scotland * Kennedys of Kirmucks, Aberdeen, Scotland * Kennedys of Londonberry, Northern Ireland * Kennedys of Tombrechan, County Tipperary, Ireland * Kennedys of Underwood, County Ayr, 1850, Scotland * Kennedys of Visit Dublin, 1607, Ireland * Johnstown-Kennedy of County Dublin, Ireland * Kennedys of Bargany and Ardstencher, County Ayr, Scotland * Kennedys of Kirkhill from the Bargany group, 1678, Scotland It is clear that there have been quite a number of powerful aristocraticKennedys. One of the more powerful recent Scottish aristocrat Kennedys was theMarquess of Ailsa (1872-1943). Because he is often called the Marquess of Ailsayou might not know him by his name Archibald Kennedy, who was the 15th Earl ofCassillis. This branch of the Kennedys married into Scottish royalty. Forinstance, Sir James Kennedy married Mary, a daughter of King Robert III, andtheir son was Sir Gilbert Kennedy was made Lord Kennedy before 1458. ArchibaldKennedy was an extremely powerful Freemason and held numerous key positions inthe Grand Lodge of Scotland. He was 1st Grand Principle from 1913 to his deathin 1943. At his death his titles passed to his brother Charles. ArchibaldKennedy was initiated in Holyrood House Lodge No. 44, Edinburgh, Nov. 17, 1896.(10,000 Famous Freemasons, Vol. l,--put out by the Missouri Lodge of Research,p. 8)How Are the Various Prominent Kennedys Related?So the question always arises as I examine the elite of the Illuminati and theNew World Order--how is this Kennedy related to this other Kennedy. Forinstance, how is David M. Kennedy (who is a Bilderberger) and William JesseKennedy III (who is a key man for the Duke Illuminati family--he is pres. ofMutual life Insur. Co, a Duke financial asset, dir. of RCA, trustee of the FordTheater where the elite killed Lincoln, and associated with the Pilgrim Soc.through the Conference Board of NYC)?? Although I can’t explain the exact ties,I can safely say that if one goes back several hundred years the Kennedyaristocrats all tie together.Beginning at The BeginningOne of my first clues that the Kennedys had something to do with the Illuminatiwas the conspiracy book The Widow’s Son-- The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles(Vol. 2) by Robert Anton Wilson. Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea, authors of\"Illuminatus!\" are not Christians. On the contrary, they are regularparticipants in the central Ohio Starwood Festival for witches and pagans.Robert Anton Wilson has publicly on a number of occasions explained that he is agnostic and a great fan of Aleister Crowley. I picked up Wilson’s book TheWidow’s Son in a Satanic/New Age bookstore. In both volume 2 (the teaser chapterat the end) and in volume 3 of The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles one istaught the significance of Brian Caeneddi, the first Kennedy, and how BrianCaeneddi’s blood got into some very important royal bloodlines. It isinteresting that an informed man like Wilson, who spends time doing rituals withGnostics and Witches, would declare that the Kennedy family is an importantbloodline in connection with the Illuminati. How many people knew that TipO’Neil, speaker of the House of Representatives, was a descendent of the Kennedyclan? Wilson writes for New Agers and witches, not for Christians. One gets thefeel that his experience with the occult has somehow given him a very good ideaof what is going on in terms of the Masons, the Illuminati, etc. He writes hisbooks in such a way that they are historical novels with a great deal of facts,and yet one is always left wondering by the style of writing whether the authorwants to be taken serious or not, is what he writes make-believe or historypadded with some fiction? I personally believe it is just the way the occultworks, they expose the facts for their own people, but in a way that will not betaken seriously by others. Wilson acts like a buffoon one minute and a seriousconspiracy researcher the next, and he will act both ways all in one article oreven on a single page of his books. When a person checks up on Wilson’s facts,they usually hold true. On my part the information about Brian Caennedi wasastounding. I had to go as soon as possible to verify it from other sources, andit turns out Wilson was accurate about their genealogy,10 and their importancein the Illuminati activities historically, etc.The Illuminati & Matthew KennedyOne of the chief lodges for the branch Illuminati prior to 1784 was located in ahuge chateau at Ermenonville near Paris, France. The land belonged to theMarquis of Gerardin, who protected Rosseau and later gave Rosseau a tomb on hisestate. St. Germain presided over this Illuminated lodge. This Illuminated lodgecarried out blood rituals with an altar made from human bones. Interestingly,one of St. Germain’s good friends who came over from Ireland to Paris wasMatthew Kennedy (1652-1735). Matthew Kennedy was connected with St. Germain’scourt, and wrote A Chronological. Genealogical and Historical Dissertation ofthe Royal Family of the Stuarts. In 1613, the Stuart family had married into theSang raal, and began to play a role in the genealogies of the Prieure de Sion.Frederick of the Palatinate after he married Elizabeth Stuart established anoccult ‘Rosicrucian’ state. It was Frederick who helped start the bloody 30 yrs.war between the Protestants and Catholics. The Stuarts spread the Scottish Riteof Freemasonry throughout Europe. For a while the Prieure de Sion seems to havebacked the Stuarts, but at some point quit. St. Germain is revered as a Christfigure by the “I AM Movement” and the Church Universal Triumphant, and other newage groups. A picture that looks similar to Christ, but which is actually apicture of St. Germain hangs in many of the houses of people involved with the IAM Movement or its spin-offs. It is significant that an Irish Kennedy who wasinterested and liked the Stuart dynasty would be part of St. Germain’s court anda popular writer for them.John Fitzgerald KennedyIf John F. Kennedy had not been assassinated and so much about his life examinedand written about, a window allowing us to see the Kennedy Illuminati family maynever have opened so wide. First, the assassination attracted attention. Inrecent years, the Illuminati have given permission to publishing houses to printexposes of J.F.K.’s sexual life, etc.11 It is believed that this permission wasgiven in an effort to deflect criticism of his assassination by allowing hisreputation to be tarnished.12 (I hope my readers are beginning to realize thatthings are totally corrupt at the top, and that JFK was no different than somany others that have been and are today at the top of the political mess inthis nation.) John F. Kennedy had a very active sex life, even after he marriedJackie, and even after he was President in the White House. For those who don’tthink secrets can be kept by the elite, one only has to look at how John F.Kennedy was able to have sex with many women while President and to havefrequent nude swim parties at the White House pool and the general public notknow anything about it.13 John F. Kennedy’s lust for women was well known by theelite. Illuminatus McGeorge Bundy warned his friend JFK (while JFK was aSenator) that John’s openness with women might get him into trouble with thepublic. John F. Kennedy was so open about his sexual habit, that at one party atthe Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. John F. Kennedy openly had sex with onepartner in front of the party, while his friend Senator Estes Kefauver did thesame. Then they swapped partners and began again in plain view. John F. Kennedyhad many \"one-night-stands\" as the world calls them. These were merely womenhustled up by his aides or the secret service or his friends like Frank Sinatra.But Kennedy also had long term relationships with some of the women he wassexually active with. It is those relationships which reveal so much about thehidden Satanic side of the Kennedys. John F. Kennedy had three long termgirlfriends, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Mansfield, and Zsa Zsa Gabor which were ALSOgirlfriends of Anton LaVey, who has headed the Church of Satan. Jayne Mansfieldwas a high priestess of the Church of Satan. Marilyn Monroe was a participant inLaVey’s satanic rituals before LaVey founded his Church of Satan. Both JFK andhis brother Robert Kennedy had affairs going with Marilyn Monroe, and bothvisited her just prior to her mysterious death. Zsa Zsa has been interested foryears in the occult. (JFK also had relationships with other women connected withthe Illuminati also.) Before we examine the significance of these threerelationships of JFK’s, and before we get into his liaisons with other women whowere Illuminati connected, let’s cover the relationship between Anton LaVey andthe Illuminati. California was very fertile soil for Satanism due to a host offactors. Two lesser known factors are that there were Haitian communities whichpracticed voodoo in California at the early part of this century. AlsoCalifornia became a haven for witches and Satanists fleeing from France, So.America, Cuba, and other places where their Satanic practices were nottolerated. California had a reputation for acceptance of their evil rituals.When one adds to these such things as Hollywood it is easy to see how SanBernardino valley has become such a strong Satanic center. Anton LaVey’smaternal grandmother was from Transylvania. It was from that side of the familythe Anton got some encouragement toward the occult. Anton La Vey loved horrormovies. He studied Alister Crowley, and the O.T.O. which had lodges inCalifornia which is where he lived, and in 1947 he joined the Clyde BeattyCircus. The Beatty family connects in with the Illuminati families also by theway. LaVey worked for several circuses and learned how to be a showman. Heworked the occult sideshows of the circus, and found that people wanted tobelieve occult frauds. Anton LaVey found Marilyn Monroe, a Jewish girl, workingas a striptease in the strip clubs. LaVey helped her performance, and throughhis connections got her started on her big career. LaVey used his talent ofshowmanship to create a type of Satanism that could be marketed to the public.LaVey always manages to walk a tight-rope between openly supporting hard-coreSatanic practices such as human sacrifice and being just simply theatrics. Inother words, he blatantly supports enough evil to attract evil people, but hepublicly never allows himself to be connected in any way with child molestation,human sacrifice, etc. Anton LaVey was into Satanism before the 1960’s, but itwas not until 1966 that he founded the Church of Satan. Some hard core Satanistsfeel he is \"all show,\" other hard core Satanists form covens and try to serveAnton LaVey, because they view him as a role model. The Illuminati set up theirheadquarters in Southern California this century. San Bernardino county is theirheadquarters. Of course as I have written before that the Illuminati is toosecret to carry out anything themselves. They need co-workers. The Illuminati isstrictly hereditary. The Illuminati secretly control the Satanic cults at whatis sometimes described as Stage 4 and Stage 5 of Satanism. The lower levels arefor recruits, the grunts, the privates so to speak in Satan’s army. In the SanBernardino area, one type of high priest of Stage 2 or 3 is the MasterCounselor. Other positions include the Keeper of the Books, and the Keeper ofthe Seal. In the late ’60s, Mike Warnke, who was a high priest, a MasterCounselor, raised the number of Satanists in the first 3 stages to 1,500 membersin the San Bernardino area (San Bernardino-Riverside-Colton). Bear in mind thatthese 1,500 active Satanists are not Illuminati members--they are much lowerthan the lower Illuminati ranks such as the Sisters of Light. The Sisters ofLight and Five-Star generals and an Asmodeus who are the middle management typesof the World Order who direct the upper levels of priests of the covens ofSatanism that are open to the public. Anton LaVey participates in conferencesfor the occult where Satanism (the first 3 stages) and secret Illuminatioverseers are present. In other words, LaVey is not out of touch with hard coreSatanism, he just manages to keep his public profile clean. It is meant thatway. Anton LaVey is a publicity agent to give Satanism a good image.Marilyn MonroeAnton LaVey knew how to be a showman. He took Marilyn Monroe, helped her withher acting and with his connections helped her get a chance to act. John F.Kennedy had a long term relationship with Marilyn Monroe. When J.F.K. waselected at the convention to be the Presidential candidate the Kennedys threw aparty at the convention. The party was described this way, \"every delegate (atthe convention was provided by the Kennedy group with anything they wanted fortheir entertainment including liquor and women sent to their room.\" JFK spentthe time at the convention and the next day afterwards \"making love’ to MarilynMonroe. After his acceptance speech the whole group went over to his closefriend Peter Lawfords for a skinny-dipping party. Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatraand Sammy Davis, Jr. were close friends to each other and to John F. Kennedy.Sammy Davis, Jr. became a member of the Church of Satan after LaVey started it.From the middle of 1955 to the end of 1959 JFK had a suite on the 8th floor ofWashington’s Mayflower Hotel set aside for his extramarital affairs. (FBI File)Jayne MansfieldDuring the 1960’s Jayne Mansfield and John F. Kennedy had their relationship.They met at places like Beverly Hills, Malibu, Palm Springs. JFK had several menwho \"bearded\" for him. That is they would act like the women JFK was to get,were their own date. One of these was Dave Powers, who even went so far as towrite in a book Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye that whenever Jackie left Washington.JFK (Jack) and him would eat together and then the President would say hisprayers and go to bed alone. One of the things Dave Powers did was to helpprocure a steady stream of new women for Jack.Some of the other on-going sexual relationship that JFK maintained were: * Lady Jean Campbell-daughter of the Duke of Argyll * Flo Pritchett Smith-wife of the American Ambassador to Cuba * Kay-Kay Hannon Auchincloss - (In this case although they had a long term close relationship no-ones knows what they did together.) * Judith Campbell Exner- Judith was Sinatra’s girlfriend who he passed on as a favor. Judith worked for the Mafia, in particular she worked for Sam Giancana and John Roselli, who for some reason also both worked for the CIA.Exner ran letters between the Mafia and John F. Kennedy while he was President.(according to People Magazine, \"The Dark Side of Camelot\", Feb. 29, 1988.) It isalso known that JFK was in direct contact with Meyer Lansky and Joe Fishetti,two other Mafia chiefs, and that he benefit from money they passed on to him.This is no surprise because Jack’s father had worked with the Mafia Jack’sentire life. There are a number of respectable books by ex-Satanists orex-Organized Crime members where they are clear about how those groups love toblackmail people. John F. Kennedy certainly could have been easily blackmailedby these groups if they had wanted to. I haven’t seen any indication thatblackmail was even tried, so the only other conclusion, which fits a lot ofevidence, is that John F. Kennedy worked with the Satanists and the Mafia. Infact, the Mafia rigged several important counties in the election, like inChicago, which tipped the scales in John winning the Presidency. That’s anentirely different thing that this article won’t get sidetracked on.A Poem by JackieSomething that Jackie wrote on their honeymoon about Jack seems to mesignificant. When Jack and Jackie we newlyweds after their wedding Sept. 1953,the President of Mexico Don Miguel Alemán, let Jackie and Jack use his villa.During their use of the Mexican President’s villa, Jackie wrote a poem aboutJohn her new husband. \"He would find loveHe would never find peaceFor he must go seekingThe Golden Fleece.\" (A Woman Named Jackie, p. 134.) One of the writing projects that I have wanted to see done, and I have delegatedit to a good friend, is to give my readers an article on MJ-12, a.k.a. the “WiseMen”, or the “Study Group.” This group of men actually runs the United States. Iknow a good deal about the Study Group, in fact if my sources are correct itisn’t a formal group anymore. There are not formal meetings, but rather meetingshappen at random with people \"accidently bumping into each other.\" MJ-12 drawsmembers from the Jason Society and the Jason Group. Both the Jason Society andthe Jason Group are named after “Jason and the Golden Fleece.” There are reasonsto believe that Jackie knew some of the way the power structure operated. Jackiewas good friends with many of the top Illuminati men in this nation. In fact,she ended up marrying Onassis, who was a King in Moriah (the Illuminati). CouldJackie have meant in this poem that Jack was wanting to climb the ladder clearup to The Golden Fleece, i.e. the Jason Society and MJ-12?Joseph KennedyJoseph Kennedy was John F. Kennedy’s father. Through various means Iindependently learned that Joseph Kennedy was part of the Illuminati. He was amember of the Pilgrim Society (a 60 of the branch Illuminati). He also workedclosely with the Mafia, and other Kingpins in the Illuminati. Perhaps in anotherarticle we can cover more about Joseph Kennedy. This article is about longenough. I thought I might wrap it up with a story about Joseph Kennedy. Thestory demonstrates that much of what politicians tell the public is simply fortheir own benefit, and often only lies. Jack Kennedy got the reputation afterBritain and the Germany began fighting in W.W. II, as being against the UnitedStates entering the war. Jack Kennedy held the prestigious job of being the U.S.ambassador to Great Britain at the time. The fact that Jack Kennedy was givensuch an extremely vital position shows that the Kennedy family is importantwithin the Illuminati. At that point in time, like no other time, it wasimportant who the U.S. had as ambassador. After the war began, and bothcountries had martial law, and extensive military communications, the ambassadorwas really not quite so critical in his role. One of the men who worked at theembassy for the Americans was an American Tyler Gatewood Kent, a career officerin the U.S. Consular service. Tyler Kent believed in a world conspiracy beforehe began working in the code room. While he worked there he was astonished thatRoosevelt was secretly involving the United States in W.W. II and lying to theAmerican public. Further, Roosevelt was pulling strings to get us involved whilelying to the public. Kent secretly took 1,500 pgs. of secret documents, which hewas going to show to the public to expose the conspiracy. Kent never made it. Hewas arrested. In order for the British to hold him, Jack Kennedy had to revokehis diplomatic immunity on May 20, 1940. Ambassador Joe Kennedy did that so hecould receive a harsh sentence, because if he had been brought back to America,the public might have gotten outraged at what the politicians had done.According to Standard Operating Procedure and protocol, Kent should have stoodtrial in the U.S. The papers he had taken were American embassy papers notBritish. Although the court records show that no evidence was introduced thatKent was a spy, Joseph Kennedy later would concoct a long story for the publicthat Kent was a Nazi spy. Kennedy went on speaking engagements around the U.S.after he was relieved of his Ambassador post, and Kennedy made it sound like hewas whole heartedly against the war. If Kennedy had really been against the war,if he had simply denied the British the chance to keep Kent, Kent could havespilled the beans about what Roosevelt was doing and the outraged would havedestroyed Roosevelt’s chances to fool the American people. Instead, Rooseveltwas able to proceed and develop the elements for the Pearl Harbor attack. WhileKennedy pretended to be against the war, he was serving as an intimateaccomplice in maneuvers designed to fool the American people. This is a goodexample of how even today the public is looking to certain public officials tosave them. They think that these politicians will try everything possible tohelp them fight the system, so when they fail to beat the system, the peoplethink they have been beaten fairly. Revisiting the Top 13 Illuminati Kennedy FamiliesThe intention originally was to have the article on the top Illuminati Kennedyfamily in two parts. Perhaps sometime a second part can come out. So far I haveonly exposed a small part of the Illuminati Kennedy.. As might be expected ofany \"good\" Illuminati family, the Kennedy. are connected to drugs, to theMonarch program, to \"death\" euthanasia programs, to the British monarchy, and tothe various organized crimes group., mafias etc. For this issue, I merely wantto cover a few aspects of the Kennedy family which I didn’t take the time tocover in the May 15, ’93 issue. One aspect is the connection of the IlluminatiKennedys to the drug trade, and another is their connection to \"death\" care andthe Knights of Malta. (Readers are invited to read more about the Knights ofMalta in one of the last articles in this newsletter.)After W.W. I, Joseph Kennedy worked for Galen Stone, who was a partner in theprominent firm of Hayden Stone & Co. Hayden, Stone & Co. had ties to theRothschilds. In order to gain respectability Joe married into the Fitzgeraldfamily. (This is a common Illuminati tactic. It seems many of the Illuminatimen, look for a wife who will gain them respectability. Often wives like thisare not even brought into the Illuminati activities, so that they can be thebest cover possible.) Kennedy’s mob connection has been written about, butperhaps two are worth pointing out again. Joseph Linsey who was a kingpin oforganized crime in New England and a partner in crime with Meyer Lan sky was acrime business partner with Joseph Kennedy. Joseph Linsey in fact was listed asthe top contributor to Ted Kennedy’s Senate race one year. André Meyer, head ofthe Meyer family, was manager of the Kennedy estates. One other business partnerof Kennedy was the Bronfmans, who are powerful Illuminati figures in Canada.Kennedy was in business with Newark’s Reinfield Syndicate of which theBronfman’s owned 50%. Winston Churchill, whose connections to the elite, arebrought out in other newsletters, personally gave the grant to Joe Kennedy whichgave him the Brit. alcoholic distiller’s franchise for the American market.After Joe Kennedy became the Amer. Ambassador to Britain, we can catch a glimpseof how powerful the Illuminati are. The British Royal Family at the request ofJoseph Kennedy put on their full royal regalia for the Kennedy family. WhenKennedy arrived in Britain as American ambassador, he contacted the Astors andthe Sassoons. Sir John Wheeler-Bennett founder and head of RIIA’s researchdivision is credited by those in the know as having written Kennedy’s masterthesis, which was later made into a book Why England Slept. Perhaps one of theitems that best shows the hidden power behind Kennedy is his daughter’s marriageto William Cavendish and Joseph Kennedy’s comments about it. Kathleen marriedthe Duke of Devonshire. The Duke of Devonshire was very prestigious positionwithin the British nobility. Dukes are second only to the monarchy. JosephKennedy was often heard saying. \"If Kathleen and her husband were living, I’d bethe father of the Duchess of Devonshire (first Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen) andthe father-in-law of the head of all the Masons in the world.\" (Koskoff, DavidE. Joseph P. Kennedy: A Life and Times. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall,Inc., p. 378.) Joseph Kennedy was in the British branch of the Knights of Maltawhich is called the Order of St. John. Interestingly, Jackie Bouvier KennedyOnassis’ sister Lee married Prince Stanislaus Radziwill. The Radziwill familyestablished the Order of St. John of Jerusalem (that’s the Knights of Malta) inPoland in 1610. They also helped establish the Order in the U.S. (See thearticle on the Knights of Malta this issue.) Another tie in between the Kennedysand the Knights of Malta concerns the Hospice movement. The Kennedy Institutefor the Study of Human Reproduction and Bioethics (located at the Jesuit’sGeorgetown Univ.) is helping fund the Knights of Malta’s hospice movement inAmerica. In Oct. 1978, the first annual meeting of the National HospiceOrganization took place. Sen. Edward Kennedy was one of the two keynotespeakers. What is the hospice movement which is being conducted by theHospitallers (one of the names the Knights of Malta go by)? It is a movement toallow old people \"The Right to Die.’ The Knights of Malta have an ancienthistory of running drugs and in administering mind altering drugs in theirhospitals instead of giving medicine. This ancient activity was carried forthinto modern times when their St. Christopher’s hospital in London began givingpatients Brompton Mixture until they died. Brompton Mixture consists of heroin,cocaine, alcohol, tranquilizers, and chloroform water. This mixture is given inthe Knights of Malta hospitals to patients every three hours until they die.Euthanasia or \"mercy killing\" may seem like a merciful idea, until a personfinds out how the people at the top of the Euthanasia movement view things. Theyview things similar to the Satanist Adolf Hitler. This view is that it ismerciful to get rid of unwanted people. Although the \"death\" hospice movementseems benevolent at first, it is the conclusion of where the program will end upthat is the kicker. Hospice, Inc. which is linked to the elite is also providedfunding by the Kaiser Foundation. Besides ties to running drugs, the KennedyClan has had their problems with drugs. Ted Kennedy’s daughter Kara was on drugsand ended up in a halfway house. Bobby Kennedy’s kids were busted for drugs.Joan Kennedy was having problems with alcoholism. David Kennedy and Robert F.Kennedy, Jr. both have been addicted to hard drugs in spite of repeatedtreatments in detoxification centers. David later \"OD’d” (overdosed) on cocaineand died in 1984. Pat’s Kennedy Lawford’s husband was dependent on drugs andalcohol. It is not well known that the Illuminati have long used drugs. Elitepeople such as the Rothschilds, Winston Churchill in London and the Royal Familywere using all cocaine, heroin and opium (not to mention occult ceremonies too).Queen Victoria, thought by many to be such a straight laced lady and her guestsregularly used large quantities of cocaine and heroin. The royal summerresidence was Balmoral and this was the site of frequent drug use, and one hasto wonder what else.Short SummaryThis revisit to the Kennedy’s shows some of their ties to other elements of theIlluminati’s vast scheme of things. Until people begin to recognize that theKennedy’s wielded an occult power via their bloodline, they will not begin toappreciate why the Queen of England and her family would honor a request from anIrish commoner to have her family dress up in full regalia for the pleasure ofthis commoner’s family.The friendship Winston Churchill had with Billy Graham, with Joe Kennedy, andhis very close relationship with Onassis has recently been discussed. Churchillwas an active Freemason. He also was a Druid; this is the picture of Churchilljoining the Albion Lodge of the Anc, Order of Druids at Blenheim, 15 Aug. 1908.Followup on The Kennedy FamilyThere has been new attention focussed on the Kennedys. JFK’s widow died and thenhis mother Rose has also died recently. Last year, I read a book which was verywell researched. It is entitled A Question of Character: The Life of John F.Kennedy by Thomas C. Reeves. The book does away with all the propaganda, mediahype and lies, and tells the truth about the Kennedys. The book is welldocumented. The author spent a great deal of energy trying to find out the truthabout JFK. What emerges is not public image that is so well known. JFK had onlyabout a 119 I.Q., did very poorly in school, and could barely spell. JFK’sfather had the wealth and connections to buy his son anything. Although Kennedyhad a back problem which made him almost crippled, his father got him into theNavy during W.W. II. When he was let in, the examining doctors looked the otherway at his back problem (which plagued him his entire life). Kennedy got acommission as a Naval officer without having to go through the normal channelsof training and being commissioned. As a naval officer he did a poor job, andthe great PT-109 story was far different than what the public has been lead tobelieve. The fact that Kennedy let his boat be run over by a Jap destroyer wasbecause he and his crew weren’t paying attention (sleeping, hungover etc.)Kennedy realized he might be court martialed for his negligence, but his fatherhad the money to turn disaster into a story that made Kennedy into a hero.Some of the things you will learn from the book follow. In the chapter “TheFounding Family” we learn about PJ. Kennedy who was JFK’s grandfather. Hedropped out of grammar school, but by the age of 25 he somehow had ownership ofa saloon and a liquor business. Later, he sold his liquor interests and wentinto banking. He also went into politics and via corruption was a successfulpolitician. He won elections by hiring men to vote repeatedly for him. JoeKennedy remembered 2 Ward heelers proudly telling Joe Kennedy’s father who wason the election commission, \"Pat, we voted 128 times today.\" Joe, PJ’s son,married Rose Fitzgerald. The Fitzgeralds were a mighty Italian clan that hadhelped William the Conqueror become ruler of England. Honey Fitz was her fatherand he had a reputation for graft and vote fraud, as well as a not so secretnotorious affair with a girl named \"Toodles.\" Rose got her education in theCatholic Sacred Heart Convent which she completed a month before her 20thbirthday. Her father was removed from the House of Representatives after votingfraud was uncovered. Joe was acquainted with Roosevelt when FDR was only an Ass.Secretary of the Navy. Joe became an insider with the stock market, and knew howto manipulate stock prices to fleece the small fish that tried to play the stockmarket. Various gangsters reported that during prohibition they had smuggledillegal liquor into the U.S. with Joe Kennedy. Joe worked with David Sarnoff andhis Radio Corp. of America. Joe had an extremely varied sexual life; he hadaffairs with countless women and his son JFK followed in his footsteps. Joebought a 15 room, nine bath home in Hyannis Port, Mass. on Nantucket Sound. Thisbecame a favorite summer home of the Kennedy clan. He also bought a six-bedroomSpanish style house on the fashionable North Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach, FLwhich became the clan’s winter home. Rose is described as ‘self-centered,stingy, prudish, and often spiteful.’ Her servants called her \"Madame\". Ratherthan being the model mother that is pictured to the American public by theKennedys, she was often gone. JFK told his mother off at age 5, \"Gee, you’re agreat mother to go away and leave your children alone.\" As an adult, JFKconfided to a friend. \"My mother was either at some Paris fashion house or elseon her knees in some church. She was never there when we really needed her....Mymother never really held me and hugged me. Never! Never!”Further, his father’s lack of respect for his mother led JFK to say, \"My motheris a nothing.\" (p.40) Imagine growing up without a mother to hug and kiss you!JFK’s father ‘tolerated little nonsense and no disobedience.\" (p.33) The lifeJFK lived at home was not a life of compassion, but one of rigid obedience. Thechildren were stripped of many things ordinary children would have. They didn’teven have their own rooms. (p. 41) Most children have a room of their ownsometime in which to place their belongings and nick-knacks. The few times JFKas a boy invited friends over, they were frightened to death at how his fatherwould fly into a rage and give the Kennedy boys a tongue-lashing. The childrenwere not allowed to express pain. For instance, when one of the Kennedy’s werehurt and came to his mother for sympathy she ordered, ‘On your feet, now youknow how to behave. Go out there and behave as you know you should.’ It ishighly likely this strictness was related to some type of mind-control whicheven then was practiced by Satanic families. Joe had his daughter given aprefrontal lobotomy and then banished to a nursing convent. From then on hisdaughter Rosemary did not exist. One wonders what the full story was aboutRosemary. Was she sexually abused as is done to so many of the elite’s daughtersof Satanic families? Felix Frankfurter who played such a prominent role withCharles T. Russell was a good friend of Joe’s.JFK managed to hide from the public during his life the fact that he woreglasses, and also to some degree his intense back pain which hurt him intensely.On page 40 we learn that JFK was unable to ever have a self-revealingconversation. JFK had a total lack of ability to relate, everything was verysurface in his relations with people. He was very skilled at picking up women,and getting them to bed. And he had many good friends. However, he didn’t havethe ability to love or relate to others. This is another clue that he may havehad some type of SRA abuse. On page 40, Reeves writes, ‘At the root of it weremonths of loneliness and their parents’ often selfish, insensitive behavior.\"But I wonder if it didn’t go deeper. From what I know from informers it goesdeeper and involves SRA. JFK wasn’t even told of his brother Teddy’s birth,until he came home from boarding school and discovered he had another brother.JFK was very unsuccessful at most everything he did. His father had so muchinfluence and power that he could get his son out of almost any difficulty. Afriend of JFK’s recalled, \"With Jack, nobody really admired what he did orrespected what he did but they liked his personality. When he flashed his smile,he could charm a bird off a tree.\" At the age of 17, Jack went to Harlem to abrothel. Later, he nicknamed his sexual organ “Jay-Jay.\" Meanwhile his fatherwas the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and an informaladviser to Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt. I might add here, that if you lookclosely you will find the Illuminati Kings are the advisers to the Presidents. Ihave mentioned some of these already, like in the article on the BundyIlluminati family. Another example may be found in the book The Old Boys- TheAmerican Elite & The Origins of the CIA by Burton Hersh. On page 41 of The OldBoys we learn that President Eisenhower’s Special Assistant for Cold WarStrategy was Nelson Rockefeller. The most dangerous situation this country hasever been in was the threat of the Russian military, and who was the primaryadvisor to our President Eisenhower during his term as a U.S. President duringthe Cold War? Illuminati King Nelson Rockefeller. JFK went for one year to theLondon School of Economics according to the story given the public. Actually hewent there for one month, didn’t do any academic work and came back home. But itis significant that his father tried to send him to a school in which so many ofthe elite have gone to. JFK had help in writing and putting out a book entitledWhy England Slept Henry Luce, who headed Time-Life and who was a good friend ofJoe Kennedy gave the book good publicity in Time magazine, and his father boughtbetween 30,000 to 40,000 of the books and stored them in the attic and basementof his Hyannis Port home in order to make Jack’s (JFK) book a best seller. WhenJFK went to California in 1940, one of the places he stayed at was with WilliamRandolph Hearst, who is another Illuminati figure, at his coastal castle. Hearstwould give help to Kennedy later on too. When Kennedy ran in politics, Heart’sBoston American wouldn’t even accept Kennedy’s opponent’s paid politicaladvertisements. Joe Kennedy worked for the FBI after W.W.II. (p. 59) JFK’sfavorite sister Kathleen, married William Harrington, who father was the tenthduke of Devonshire, a pillar of the Church of England (called the Episcopalianchurch in the US.) and a high ranking Freemason. After marrying him, she had anaffair with aristocrat Peter Milton, Lord Fitzwilllam. After Joe, Jr. died,JFK’s father started grooming JFK to become President. After Jack was elected tothe House of Representatives, his three best congressional friends were RichardRussell, Spessard Holland, and Robert A. Taft. Notice that two of these are fromwell-known illuminati families, the Tafts and the Russells. By the way, theoccult Tafts and occult Russell families have intermarried. Because there is somuch disinformation out about the people who run this country, it must sometimesseem rather bizarre that people like me come along and say there is a satanicconspiracy of great magnitude. If Americans were as a whole critical thinkersand would challenge the propaganda that the controlled media gives them, thenthe false fronts and false public images of their leaders might not get writtenup so easily as history. There are not many critical thinkers in this nation.There are a great many intelligent people, but not a great many criticalthinkers. A conspiracy of great magnitude has had this nation in its grips sincethe nation was founded, and the controlled press has managed to prevent thegeneral population from finding this conspiracy out. The Kennedy Family hasplayed a role in that conspiracy. JFK gave his life to that conspiracy. Theassassination of JFK is one of the best ways to introduce Americans to theconspiracy. Ralph Epperson who gives talks/slideshows about the NWO to groupslikes to use the Kennedy Assassination as a method to get people to realize thatthere is a NWO conspiracy. Interestingly, Ralph Epperson, had as a companion fora while without knowing it, an active Monarch slave who helped him givepresentations. It is difficult for those exposing the NWO to get away from beinginfiltrated.[7] [part0000_split_019.html#_ftn7] The Monarch mind-controlledslaves are very difficult to detect, especially since most people don’t evenknow that they exist."},{"pageContent":" The Li BloodlineIn writing about the Li family and Chinese secret societies, I am like the manwho wakes up in the middle of the night while everyone else sleeps and thengropes around in the darkness trying to feel his way. I can share with you whatI’ve learned, but undoubtedly there is a great deal more that can be learned.When the year started I knew only a little about the Li family, and that onlyfrom what I had heard. I didn’t even know how to spell their name right. I wasspelling it Lee (Actually the Li family name is spelled Lee in some areas suchas Hokkien, Teochew, Singapore and by some Chinese Americans.) Because I knew solittle about the family, it was one of my primary areas of focus when doingUnderstanding How Chinese Names Are JoinedA Chinese is name is made up of a family name (surname), which is written first,and then comes the personal name. In the Chinese way of things my name would beSpringmeier Fritz. Family names are usually of one character each, althoughthere are exceptions like Ouyong and Situ. There are over 6,000 Chinese surnamesfor about I billion Chinese. The more frequent Chinese surnames in Englishspeaking countries such as the U.S., U.K., & Aust. are Chan, Lin, Li, Wong,Huang, Mei, Yang, Chin, and Fong. In mainland China the 5 top families are Chen,Li, Zhang, He, and Huang.Family Names Are More Meaningful for Chinese (in China) than for AmericansThe Chinese surname Li is a very popular name in China, perhaps not aswidespread as Smith in this country, but certainly used as much as the nameBrown is in America. Chinese who have the same surname have much more loyalty tosomeone else who has the same surname. For instance, two Chinese with the Liname would consider themselves relatives even if they were total strangers. Evenif two people knew no blood ties, if they had the same surname it has generallybeen considered incestuous to marry each other in China. In the U.S. if twoBrowns without any apparent blood ties met each other, they would not feel as ifthey were close relatives which two Chinese with the same surname would.The Li surname has a long history which goes back to a specific person namedEmperor Zhuanzu who was the first Li and lived before 2000 B.C. This isaccording to the Xing Zuan, the Chinese dictionary of surnames.The Li family has a long history in China with many stories. During the TangDynasty about 15 different surnames were given the honor of having the Lisurname. Li Yuan was the founder of the Tang Dynasty which lasted from 618 to906 A.D. His son who ruled after him was Li Shimin. In their dynasty, printingand paper money were introduced to China. (It’s interesting that theLisareconnected the introduction of paper money.)Are the Different Important Lis Related?In recent history threeLisstand out as giants: * The billionaire and de facto ruler of Hong Kong Li Ka-shing. * Li Peng the ruler of Red China. * Lee Kuan Yew President (& dictator) of SingaporeI don’t know which of theLisare closely related and which are not. I do knowthatLiscontrol Red China, Hong Kong, and Singapore and have important positionsin Taiwan. If the variousLiswhich control these various nations are related,then we are certainly looking at one of the most powerful families in the world.In terms of power, they would be just as powerful as the Rockefellers. They alsoconnect to secret occult societies, but the secret societies which theLisaremajor players in are the Chinese secret societies. Those will be coveredelsewhere in this newsletter.Which Ones Are Part of The Illuminati?I have learned from a source that Li Ka-shing and the powerful Hong KongLisaredefinitely part of the Satanic Illuminati Li’s. In terms of whether theLiswhorun Red China are part of the Illuminati, I know nothing that directly connectsthem. However, there are clues that make one wonder. For instance, why do theRockefellers and Rothschilds have such a cozy relationship with these RedChinese Li’s. Why does the Premier (or Prime Minister) of the People’s Republicof China Li Peng visit with the Rockefellers and other capitalists when he comesto New York City, if he is such a hardline communist? Haven’t the communistsnamed the capitalists their major enemy? And then when we watch men who are Inthe Illuminati such as Skull & Bones George Bush treat the ChineseLiswith suchcloseness, even when it was Li Peng that crushed innocent people at TiananmenSquare, it makes us wonder still. In fact, with other pieces of the puzzle thatI have in place, I do know that Red China is already cooperating with and partof the New World Order. The only way that China could already be secretly partof the New World Order is for its leaders who are the Li family to be in favorof the New World Order. This strongly suggests that the Li family In China isalso part of the Illuminati. From what I know, the range of possibilities rangefrom them being only sympathizers with the NWO elite to them being outrightmembers of the Illuminati. I lean toward the latter view.Then there is Singapore. Singapore is lock stock and barrel in the New WorldOrder. They went to a cashless Society before anyone else. One of the Li familywho spells his name Lee, Lee Kuan Yew, a Cambridge-educated lawyer, was dictatorof Singapore for decades. He has ties to the British elite. As an example of hisdictatorship, Lee didn’t like long hair on men, and so men coming into Singaporewith long hair would have their passports taken away and either got a haircut orwent to jail. In 1959, when Britain gave Singapore its Independence the Lifamily (In this case also spelled Lee) controlled the People’s Action Partywhich ruled the country. In 1976, the People’s Action Party monopolized politicsso much that they won all 69 seats for Parliament. Lee Kuan Yew was placed intothe all-powerful position of President in 1965, where he remained I believeuntil 1991. Singapore’s leaders made Singapore very anti-communist during thecold war, and when Nixon began his trips to woo China., Singapore began makinggoodwill political mission to China. In 1975, Lee’s henchman Foreign Minister S.Rajaratnam went to China and met with Chou En-lai. Chou En-lai was the mentorand friend of U Peng.U Peng’s Early Life.Actually, to be more specific after Li Peng’s father, who was a leadingcommunist, was shot by the nationalists In 1931, Chou Enlal more or less adoptedLi Peng and raised him. Chou Enlal got U Peng into Moscow’s school system,where, when the Russians finally realized his brilliance wanted to keep Li Pengand train him for their own purposes, and U had to escape to back to China. Forwhatever reasons, Li Peng was an advocate of the Soviet style of economics.Before being placed into his prominent position that he holds today, Li Pengmanaged China’s economy for many years.Lee Met MaoIn 1976, Lee Kuan Yew himself met with Mao Tse-tung (then the leader of RedChina). Mao Tse-tung himself is closely tied to the Li family. Li Ta-chao wasthe head of the communist party in Northern China during the fighting with theNationalists. Mao’s bodyguard was a Li family member Li Yinqiao. Mao’s mentorwas Li Ta-chao, who had ties to the Red Spears Secret Society. Other early highranking communists such as Chu Teh, Ho Lung, and Liu Chib-tan had memberships inthe Red Spears Secret Society and Li Ch’l-han an early communist leader was amember of the Green Gang Secret Society. We will cover more about the Li familyand Its relationship to Chinese Secret Societies later, as well as explainingsome about the various powerful secret fraternities. It may well have been LiTa-chao’s guidance that led to Mao Tse-tung writing the first systematic attemptby a Chinese Marxist to characterize the class basis of secret societies, andemphasizing their importance for revolution. Mao cooperated with the Ko-Ino Hui,a secret society, that helped his revolution, but strangely the officialcollection of Mao’s works neglects to include Mao’s appeal to them for help.(This neglect is noted on pg. 4 of Popular Movements & Secret Societies inChina. 1840-1950) Mao Tse-tung is also a product of the Harlot Christian church.Mao as a boy had wanted to learn of Christ and attend a Missionary school, butwhen he went to it, they threw him rudely out because he was Chinese. Mao neverforgot the bad treatment he received at the hands of Christians. That explainsin part his hatred of Christianity.A Closer Look at the Li Illuminati Family in Hong KongThe Rothschild and the Rockefeller families have a very high respect for theChinese and Japanese people in relation to some of the other peoples in theworld. That is one reason why China and Japan are being given the chance to beimportant players in the New World Order.The powerful Li family in Hong Kong is part of the Illuminati. This familymaintains a good public relations. They are philanthropists. Billionaire LiKa-shing donated money to create a University in Shantou in South China. Thecost of the University and its teaching hospital were reported at 85 millionU.S. dollars in Fortune Magazine 7/13/92, p. 107. The following chart shows Li Kashing’s financial empire, which extendsworldwide: 60 Broad Street * New York CityLisshare (with Olympia & York) * Estimated value of building $100 millionStar TV, Hong Kong * countries in Asia and MidEast) * Star’s capitalization: $300 millionHusky Oil, Calgary * value: $1.3 billionCanadian Imperial * Bank of Commerce Toronto Bank’s market value $4.3 billionPacific Place, Vancouver * $2 billionSuntec City Singapore * $1 billion property development with partners According to Fortune Magazine, 7/13/92, p. 106, Li Ka-shing is worth 4 billionU.S. dollars. Another article notes that he made HK$13.4 billion from realestate sales in 1991 alone.Li Ka-shing has lived in the same house on a hill in Hong Kong for 30 years. LiKa-shing had little to no formal schooling. He is self-taught. His sons havebeen well educated at Stanford. Victor became an engineer, and his other sonRichard majored in computer science and is running Star TV in Hong Kong.Other Wealthy Friends of LiKashing gets together with him regularly to play poker games. U Ka-shing ischairman or chief executive of his four big companies in Hong Kong. He hiresboth Chinese and western executives for day-to-day management. Simon Murray, aDalton who served in the French Foreign Legion, is one ofListrusted managers.Murray had worked for Jardine Matheson, a business owned by one of the Committeeof 300. U has built global alliances with British companies, and has part ofPearson, a British holding company which in turn as interest in Lazard bankingArms In N.Y., London, and Parts. As one can see Li Ka-shing is doing businesswith the big boys of International Banking. Li also has Joint ventures with MTV,AT&T, Motorola, and Time-Warner.LisStar TV broadcast 5 channels to viewers allthe way from Israel to Indonesia. The programming comes from the BBC news, andMTV, and some minor partners. Li is giving Madonna and the rest of Hollywood tothe Asians. Li also invested in Vancouver, B.C. He bought the Expo 86 site whichIs 1/6th of downtown Vancouver. 27% of Vancouver’s 560000 citizens are ofChinese descent. Vancouver is a Triad stronghold. This will discuss elsewhere LiKa-shing has been allowed by the elite to buy into Canada’s Husky Oil. He couldnot have done this without the elite’s tolerance. The Oil and Gas Journal, Nov.18, ‘91, p. 36 states that U now has 86 % of Husky Oil.The Rest of the Li Hong Kong ClanThe huge Bank of East Asia (BEA) is run by U Kwok-po. BEA has gone intopartnerships with such Illuminati-connected companies as G. Warburg. Li Kwok.po(also known as David Li) also serves in the Hong Kong legislature as thecouncilor who represents the banking community. He is also a vice-chairman ofthe committee drawing up the future Chinese administrative region that Hong Kongwill soon become. He was chosen for this position by the Red Chinese because ‘Hewas chosen by the Chinese mainly because or his family background. The extendedLi family, with most of its members holding British passports, is one of theterritory’s rich and influential old families.’ (Far Eastern Economic Review,June 1989, p. 47) Li has been urging the Hong Kong people to trust the CommunistChinese government. David Li did not comment on the Tiananmen Square Massacrewhen asked. David Li holds a full British passport and can go anywhere be wants.Most people in Hong Kong have only a Hong Kong passport that gives them Britishcitizenship but doesn’t entitle them to travel.DavidLisuncle is Simon Li, who was a justice of appeal in Hong Kong, and alsoselected for the BLDC. His other uncle Ronald Li was the former chairman of theHong Kong Stock Exchange and a member of the Basic law Consultative Committee.Ronald Li and his son got caught using their Stock Exchange positions in corruptmoney making offenses, and were to be brought to trial. I don’t know how itturned out.Another uncle, Li Fook-kow, was elected in Sept. ‘88 to represent the Hong Kongfinancial community in the government.When the scandal broke concerning the elite’s BCCI, the Hong Kong branch—Bank ofCredit and Commerce Hong Kong (BCCHK) was shielded from investigation. BCCHK’schief executive Tariq Jamil who could have been called upon to answer questionsskipped the country. Hong Kong authorities made no attempt to stop him. David Ugot involved and suggested that the Exchange Fund be used to help his BEAacquire BCCHK.. Another key figure in the BCCHK,, was Louis Saubolle, who waspreviously Bank of America’s chief contact with Red China. Louis Saubolle hastravelled to mainland China regularly since the 1940s. He is rumored to havedone dubious practices while chairman of BCCHK, but he left the country fordestinations unknown. * A Li heads up American Express International in the area. * Li. Pel Wu was one of the five best paid chief executives in banking in 1990. * Some of the Li family in Hong Kong have taken on the trappings of Christianity behind which are their other nefarious activities. One Li, Florence Tim Oi Li, has become a lady Catholic priest. (National Catholic Reporter, Oct. 19, ‘90, p. 12. * Richard Li has become a media mogul for Asia. * And Victor Li ran the East-West Center in Hawaii.Red China“The real decision-making in China’s political system takes place within thePolitburo, and particularly among the seven members of its standing committee,in consultation with retired Party elders.” (The China Business Review, Jan-Feb.1993, p. 22) This inner circle of seven men Includes two members of the Lifamily: Li Peng, who is the head of this inner circle, and Li Ruihuan, who Ishead of the Communist Party’s Propaganda. Li Ruihuan has been a member of thisinner circle since 1989. The other men on the inner circle are Jiang Zemin, QiaoShi, Hu Jintao, Liu Huaqing, and Zhu Rongji.As premier or Prime Minister of China Li Peng has met with a great many of theworld’s leaders, and many of the Illuminati’s men.Here Is a Sampling of Li Peng’s Meetings: * April 28, ’90—Soviet leaders * around July, ’91—U.S.-China Business Council Officials which includes Illuminati members. * Aug. 15, 91—Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu * Sept. 3, ’91--Great Britain’s Prime Minister John Major * Nov. 16, ’91-Sec. of State James A.Baker * Dec. 12-14, ’91--Prime Minister of India P.V. Narasiaha Rao * Feb. 1, ’92—Pres. George Bush * Feb. 3, ’92—top U.S. capitalists (Illuminati members) * Feb. 10, ’92—Yeltsin in RussiaDo the World’s Leaders Confer with Each Other?Li Peng is not the only important Li family member to be the President orPremier of China: * Li Xlannian was involved in the power struggle after Mao’s death and was President of China. For a number of years Li. Xiannian was considered one of the four top leaders of Red China. For many years Li Xiannian did lots of travelling to places like Africa where he held high level meetings with other leaders. * Li Desheng was a member of the Politburo, Central Committee of the Communist Party, and served in key military posts. * Li Qiang was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and was appointed Minister of Foreign Trade in 1978.Contact/Cooperation Between the Illuminati and the Li’sGeneral Li Mi fled to the Golden Triangle and was provided via CIA agentssupplies. It was Li Mi who started up the poppy fields to produce drugs thatwould be marketed by the other top Illuminati families. It was not chance thatLi began opium production. The whole affair was a carefully calculated event bythe Illuminati who have made millions running drugs for centuries. In the 1960,another Li took over after Li Mi died. His name was Li Wen-huan.The elite made room for theListo open the Li Commercial Bank for business onLong Island, N.Y. After Bush was ambassador to China, Carter selected 6°(Pilgrim Soc. member) Thomas S. Gates to represent the U.S. to China. DavidRockefeller gave his O.K. to the selection of Gates, and Gates was transferreddirectly from working on the board of J.P. Morgan & Co. to Peking.The Illuminati’s banks have been lining up over the years making loans to RedChina.One of the articles that I read to understand where Clinton was going with RedChina was in the Jan-Feb ’93 issue of The China Business which had on its covera picture of Clinton and Li Peng with the question \"A NEW ERA?\" As many of theelite’s articles are it was long on rhetoric, propaganda. etc. I think thebottom line was that Clinton is going to follow the advice of his China advisorsand that Clinton does not want to rock the boat in our relations with CommunistChina. The idea that is being planted by the question on the cover is about thesize of things, the elite are moving us closer to their \"new era.\"The Li Family and Chinese Secret SocietiesIn my investigation of the Triads I discovered that the Li family is one of theprincipal families which has controlled it. The Triads is a Chinese SecretSociety which is something of a cross between the Masons and the Mafia—something in the line of P2 Freemasonry—except much bigger. The Triads are notwell known in this country but they are many more times powerful than the Mafia.It is known that the Mafia was invited to work with the Triads in 1970, and atthe time the Mafia didn’t like the Triads arrogance. However, in my opinion theTriads were not being arrogant considering how powerful they were at the time. Isuggest the reader read the article on the Triads for more understanding onthis. For the sake of completeness, I will list some of theLispast and presentthat have been important Triad leaders. (See below). I am not trying to wearyyou with all these strange names, but in breaking new ground on understandingthis powerful Illuminati family, if specific details are not given out, we risklosing some of the picture.The Lis control Hong Kong and the Triads run Hong Kong. Is there a connectionbetween the Li family and the Triads. Yes there is a big one, but it is verysecret.Triad Leaders of The Family * Li Chi-tang —overseas leader * Li Hslen-chih * Li Hsiu-ch’eng --Hunan * Li Hung --Honan * Li K’ai-ch’en --Triad, Shanghai * Li Lap Ting --Kwangsi province * Li Ping-ch’ing --Triad, Shanghai * Li Shih-chin * Li Wen-mao Fatshan * Li Yuan-fa --HunanLi Chol Fat -Hong Kong * Li Jarfar Mah --Britain * LI--north of PekingThe Li Family and GeneticsThe Li family has also provided some of the greatest scientists in the field ofgenetic research. Genetic research has been an avid interest of the SatanicHierarchy.SummaryThe facts I have of what is going on with the Li family are just enough toprovide us with the basic picture. The Li family In Hong Kong is part of theSatanic Hierarchy and works hand in glove with British and American elite. Theyalso help run the Triads. Whether or not theLisin Hong Kong are related to theRed ChineseLiswho run China I do not know, but it is clear that someLisrun RedChina and also Singapore. Both these countries work hand in hand with theSatanic hierarchy so it makes one suspicious as to whether their leaders arepart of the hierarchy too. If these Lis do consider themselves bloodrelatives—which they might—we know that according to Chinese custom they woulddo this to a great extent anyway, then that makes the Li family an incrediblypowerful family of worldwide importance.

One of the names the Triadshave had is the Heaven and Earth Society. Other principal names include the HungLeague, and the Three United Association.The Freemasons have been very Interested in the Triads and several Masons havedone in depth studies and written books about the Triads including G. Schlegel(The Hung League. 1866), J.S.M. Ward (The Hung Society - see another quote ofhis on pg. 2), and W.G. Sterling (1925)The Hung Society.The history of China is a history of authoritarian dynasties and the secretsocieties that opposed them. Throughout Chinese history, there has basicallybeen only one recourse to opposition to the establishment that was throughsecret societies. Secret societies have been a way for the powerless, tostruggle against whatever they perceived as the cause of their misery. There hasnever been any lack of recruits for Chinese secret societies, and there hasnever been any lack of causes to use to rally the poor masses against formotivating people into joining secret societies. There seems to be no end to thesupply of men willing to lead secret societies also. In fact, I know of over 250Chinese secret societies, some of which are no longer in existence. Obviously,we are not going to cover that many secret societies in this article.What criteria do I have for selecting what I will write about in this article.First, I desire to show the compatibility of Chinese secret societies to westernsecret societies. This compatibility is the reason that the Triads can work withthe Mafia, the CIA, and the Illuminati. These points of compatibility explainhow Freemasonry can work with some of the Chinese secret societies. Forinstance, I have a copy of The New Age magazine, Sept. 1964, p. 38, which is putout by The Supreme Council 33º which states: Chinese Wootsu [sic] Society Compared to Freemasonry “Brother Morris B. de Pass, 33°, Master of Kadosh of the Peking Scottish RiteBodies, in his annual report, includes the following interesting story in regardto Wootsu Society. ‘During the past year I had the pleasure of meeting an ‘OldChina Hand,’ himself a Scottish Rite Mason, who, learning of my Chinabackground, asked me If I had any knowledge of an old Chinese organizationsimilar to Masonry. I felt certain he had in mind the ‘Wootsu Society’ (Woomeaning 5, and Tsu meaning ‘Ancestor’) or, in English, ‘the Society of the FiveAncestors.’ …some foreigners living in China were of the opinion that TheSociety of the Five Ancestors was the Eastern Branch of that movement whichdeveloped in Western countries into Freemasonry .... The tenets of the WootsuSociety do have much in common with those of Freemasonry. They pay homage toBuddha, whom they accept as the incarnation of a Supreme Deity they believe inimmortality they teach ‘Faithfulness unto Death’; and they practice secrecy. TheSociety differs from Masonry in that there is no counterpart of the Volume ofthe Sacred Law as being an indispensable part of its Furniture; ... and it isopen to both men and women.” Perhaps no one better epitomizes the connections and overlap between East andWest occult secret societies than the life of Sun Yat-sen. Sun Yat-sen led Chinato overthrow the monarchy and create a republic. Sun Yat-sen was a leader inseveral Triad groups, such as the Hong Kong based Chung Wo Tong Society and theKwok On Wui Society in Honolulu and Chicago. Soon after arriving in Hawaii heformed the Tai Luk Shan, a new Triad group. Sun Yat-sen played the key role insetting up 268 other branches of the Triads too. In Japan he set up the T’ungMeng Hui. In Singapore and Malaysia he set up Triad lodges too. He was a highranking Freemason, and he attended an Anglican school in Hong Kong. Sun-Yat-Senand the millionaire Chang Ching-chang who was an international art dealer workedtogether. Sun Yat-sen travelled in the U.S. and Europe gaining support for hisrevolution. Several other great non-communist Chinese leaders have also hadmembership in both the Triads and Freemasonry.Triad RitualsTriad rituals were an elaborate affair but have continued to be streamlined overthe years. The ritual initiation drew from 3 religious sources: Taoism (magic),Buddhism, and what might be called Confucianism. Taoism emphasized theimportance of blood ancestry, of magic, and alchemy. The traditional initiationlasts about eight hours, and includes ritual dance, secret hand-shakes, a bloodsacrifice, and pricking the finger of the new initiates.The Triads have an extremely long history and a lot of heritage. In order to tryto capsulize what they are one has to look at what they are doing at aparticular moment. At times they are secret fraternity like the Masons, at othertimes they have more of the appearance of a revolutionary army, and at othertimes they look like the Mafia. They are all these things. And so they are amuch more complex group to understand than some of the other secret societiesthat might fit into some nice label. Sometimes their services as hit men arehired out to others. Their heritage and history make them almost a sub-culture,and a sub-culture that is difficult for law enforcement agencies to penetrate.Their blood oaths and traditions bind them together.OriginsThe White Lotus Society centuries ago amalgamated itself to the Hung Societywhich in turn changed into the Triad Society also known as the Three UnitedSociety. Some people continued calling it the Hung Society. The Hung Society hadmany local names, and like Freemasonry hid behind trade guilds.Infiltrated the BoxersThe Triads infiltrated the Boxers and even associated with them, but the Boxerslost against the foreign powers.SET UP BRANCHES IN THE UNITED STATESDuring the California gold rush days many Chinese began coming to America. Triadlodges sprang up in the Chinese laundrymen of San Francisco. By 1854, the TriadSociety called ‘Five Companies’ had 35,000 members in California. In the U.S.the Triad lodges became known as Tongs-which means a ‘hail’ or ‘meeting place.’Wherever the Chinese lived they quietly set up Triad lodges so that soon therewere lodges In Laramie, Cheyenne, Kansas City, Seattle, Vancouver, California,New York, Boston, and the Klondike. These overseas Triads came under thejurisdiction of the Hung Mun Society in Canton. This Triad group was in turnunder Chi Kung Tong group. Groups got started in Australia and Malaya.Triads & Hong KongWhen the British began ruling Hong Kong, the Hong Kong area already had areputation for being a haven for pirates, and the Triads established lodges andbegan secretly to rule. In 1845, the British made membership in the Triadsillegal, and in later years deported them back to communist China for thoseTriad members found. However, the Triads controlled things and the British neverwere able to enforce that law except for some scattered arrests. For Instance inthe 1970s, 35% of the police in Hong Kong were affiliated with the Triads.In fact, the British man, Ernest Taffy’ Hunt, the Police Superintendent of theThad Bureau of the Colony of Hong Kong was paid bribes for 18 years ranging fromabout $HK700,000 to $HK 12 per year starting in 1955.The Hong Kong papers every so often report police raids against the Triads, butone has to wonder how much is inter-rivalry between Triad groups and much isjust for show, and how much is really something hurting the Triads.Under Triad control factories in Hong Kong have been turning out items for sexshops worldwide. The living conditions of areas under Triad control in Hong Kongwere literal hells on earth. The Triads packed people in, the sanitation wasnegligible, the filth overwhelming, and the corruption of the human spiritcomplete. There is no question what kind of life the Triads want to bringpeople, total degeneration into total moral corruption and filth. Like theMasons (but to a much lesser degree) there have been a few Triad mutual aidsocieties for their own members, but in general these have been rare.The Triads have exacted extortion money from almost everyone in Hong Kong. Thehistory of their extortions and threats etc. is many books long. In short, thewhole trading economy of Hong Kong was under their power. And the Li family asnow working with them. See the Li article in this issue.Various scandals over the decades have repeatedly shown that the Triads havetotally infiltrated the Hong Kong government and police force. Where ever ethnicChinese were hired the Triads infiltrated. And then even many of the non-Chinesewere bought off. People in Hong Kong who have watched the Triads do illegal actsright in public have frequently been frustrated by the lack of police response.The Triads & ChinaBefore the Communists took over, the Triads ran China. For instance, in 1917, itwas discovered that the Triads along with the Vice-President of the Republic ofChina were stealing public funds to purchase opium to deal in the drug trade.The leaders of Free China have been Triad leaders. Many of them have also beenFreemasons.After the Communists took over, the Triads had to go way underground. Thecommunists never stopped the Triads, but they did make them much more secret.You may remember when the Tiananmen Square Massacre occurred, the newspapersquietly reported that the Triads had smuggled the leaders of the democraticmovement out of Red China. As was just said, the Communists have never brokenthe power of the Triads. In fact, not only has the brutal Red Chinese governmentbeen ineffective against the Triads, most of the police everywhere have been.The Triads are the most powerful criminal fraternal group in the world, exceptfor the Illuminati and the families that make up the Illuminati’s Committee of300. The Mafia Is small peanuts compared to the Triads. The Triads are almostuntouchable by any law enforcement group. For instance, in Great Britain theBritish do not have hardly any ethnic Chinese on their police force to even tryinfiltrating the Triads.The Triads have operated in the United States for over 100 years, and are majordrug handlers working in cooperation with the Illuminati Kings, and mostAmericans do not even know they exist. And although America has ethnic Chinese,Americans of Chinese descent do not speak the Chinese dialects that undercoveragents would have to know to break into the Triad operations.Different Triad GroupsThere are numerous Triad groups. By 1931, there were eight main Triad groups andthey had divided Hong Kong up into geographic areas and ethnic groups that eachwas responsible to control. The eight main ones at that time were the Wo, therung, the Tung, the Chuen, the Shing, the Fuk Yee Hing, the Yee On, and theLuen. Each had its own headquarters, its own sub-societies, and its own publiccovers. The Fuk Yee Hing’s cover was that it was registered as a benevolentsociety for workers. It had 12 branch offices and a membership of 10,000. YeeOn’s cover was as the Yee On Commercial and Industrial Guild. The Wo operated asDeath Gratuity associations. Any way each found some cover to hide behind. Mostof the Martial Arts dubs were fronts or affiliations with the Triads, andcontinue to be, not only in Hong Kong, but to some degree in other countriestoo.As an example of how divided the Triad groups are--one of the large ones, the WoSociety was itself split into three major factions: Wo Shing Tong, Wo Yung Yee,and Wo Hop To, which for years struggled for domination of the Wo Society. Bythe late 1950s, there were 41 affiliated organizations to the Wo Society Triad.Today the Wo Shing Wo is the most powerful of the Wo group Triads.One of the Triad groups that works with the Illuminati is the Sun Yee On aka YeeOn Commercial and Industrial Guild. Sun Vee On was the prime controller of theKowloon Walled City which produced sex toys for the international market.Besides the Wo Shing Wo and the Sun Yee On, the third great Triad societies ofmodern times Is the 14K Society. Probably Chiang Kai-shek and his mentorBig-Eared Tu were responsible for setting up a league to oversee all the variousTriad groups called Five Continents Overseas Chinese Hung League. This was setup in 1945, when the Chinese operated in Asia, North America, South America,Europe and Africa.As a side note on Tu, one of his friends was Charlie Soong (an office-bearer forthe Triads) who had attended Vanderbilt University at the expense of millionaireJulian S. Can. Chalie Soong’s daughter Al-lag had connections to Sun Yat-sen,and also became helpful to the Triads when she married Kung Hsiang-hsi a bankerand businessman. The Kung banking empire along with the Soong’s veneer ofChristianity which came from their Methodist Church membership helped thisbranch of Triads in their international dealings.Today in Hong Kong there may be as many as 60 different Triad Societiesoperating. The largest numerically is the Sun Yee On with 33,000 members. These60 Societies can be classed into three different styles. The first is thetraditional structure. The second type is those who are totally unstructured.The third type is the most dangerous; they are small, closely knit cells orcentral committees who plan out criminal activity with acute business-likeefficiency.Large Bases of Triad OperationsVancouver, B.C., San Francisco, New York, London, Manchester, and Amsterdam (notto mention Macao and Hong Kong) are some of the big bases of Triad Operation.Money is made by extortion, gambling, prostitution, drugs, or any other way tomake a profit. The Triads have worked with the CIA in creating the drug network.The creation of the Golden Triangle as a source for drugs was a joint CIA-Triadoperation. The Chinese communists couldn’t pass up the opportunity to debauchAmerica. The Red Chinese government has secretly worked with the Triads insupplying heroin and opium knowing that these drugs were going to U.S. militarybases. U.S. garrisons In Germany were supplied high grade drugs that camethrough the Triads, either grown under Triad supervision or in places like RedChina. One of the kingpins in this drug trade was Lumpy Ho, whose businessfronts were known as the Dutch Connection.The corrupt police-officers that were Triad members that fled anti-corruptiondrives in Hong Kong would flee to Vancouver, B.C. where they have spent theirefforts building that area up as a large Triad base of operations. Actually,they have branched out into Victoria and Seattle, WA.The Triads are known to have been operating in London since the 1890s, and mayhave been operating even before that. It wasn’t until the 1960 drug culture thatthe Triads began to catch more attention due to their large involvement in thedrug trade. In 1971, the Triads introduced Pure No. 4 herein into England toreplace the ‘Brown Sugar’ that the Rolling Stones sang about.In 1973, the British authorities moved against the Americans and British agentson the Drug Squad and forced some resignations. It is not exactly clear what thedetails of the whole mess were, but the process was that for 2 years there wasessentially no coherent drug squad in London.Every locality In England where ethnic Chinese are located, the Triads have sometype of operation. This means all of the British cities. In Scotland and Irelandthe different Triad groups have been fighting each other for control of theterritory. No wonder the Illuminati like the Triads. The U family with theirconnections controlling the Triads have the perfect vehicle to operate the drugtrade. If anyone dislikes the drug trade, their hate will be directed to anethnic group, rather than realizing who the real kings are. Most of the couriersfor the Triads today are Europeans. And the Trade are using British banks nowmore than the Hong Kong banks.The British Parliament had a committee in 1985 to look at the Triads. Theyreported that the Triads posed no threat to the U.KThe Mafia had tried to maintain its position in the drugactivity, but the Mafiawasn’t in a position to buy directly from the prime sources. The Chiu ChauTriads had operated in Saigon and Vietnam during the Vietnam War bringing indrugs for the American soldiers. The Corsican syndicates (organized crime) hadconnections in Vietnam. They introduced the Mafia to the Triads. The Corsicanshad been known as the French connection in the drug trade. They had worked withsupplies coining from Turkey, through Lebanon, and then to Marseilles, France.Now the Triads ship Asian drugs to the U.S. via South America, and the Triadscontrol the drug trade in New York City almost totally now. Dear in mind thatthe Triad leaders did this only after working out agreements with the topIlluminati families. If the top Illuminati families were not cooperating, theTriads would be out of business.One of the strong-arm units of a New York Triad group called Hip Sing Tong isthe Flying Dragons.The On Lee Ong, another N.Y. triad group’ has the Ghost Shadows as theirstrong-arm unit.If one takes a city like Toronto, Canada there the population of Chinese andVietnamese is 175,000 at least. This is a large pool of people from which tobuild Triad lodges. There are 10 Triad Societies operating in Canada.In Australia, the Triad society Yee Hing Society with its charitable Mun Ji Donghas been listed as a \"masonic charity\" for 80 years. The Mun Ji Dong has decidedto operate legally.Public CeremoniesThe Triads would publicly celebrate the Goddess of Mercy and the God of theEarth each year at a major festival where a bamboo bomb would be set off. At the1982 Tin Hau Festival. Two groups of the 14K Triad and 500 members of the WoShing Wo society openly wore Triad T-shirts at the festival. This was publiclybreaking the law that prohibits the Triads from publicly advertising, but theTriads got away with it with impunity.EnforcementThe Triads’ tradition weapons are the meat cleaver and a razor-sharp butcher’sknife which they use to slash people.The Triads Interface with Many Other GroupsBesides working with the CIA, the Mafia, who work for the Illuminati, andworking with the Illuminati families themselves, the Triads work with streetgangs, youth gangs, and any other organized crime group. They also have workedwith all types of secret fraternal groups including the Freemasons. Historicallyspeaking they have cooperated numerous times with other Chinese secretsocieties. The Triads also work with the Japanese organized crime group Yakuza,and the Filipino organized crime groups. The Yakuza also move drugs into theU.S. mainly via Hawaii. This is taking place with Yakuza/Triad cooperation. TheTaiwan Triad Societies work closest with the Yakuza, especially the Four Seasand United Bamboo Societies.The Triads in BankingThe Triads have their own accountants, and so Triad financial operations aregreat for money laundering. Stolen credit cards and imitation merchandise thatlook like the real stuff are also money makers for the Triad. The Triads alsohave their own lawyers, who are members of their societies. Besides making falseGucci handbags, the Triads are adept at forging passports. One of the items thatthe drug trade takes is gold, because the drug producers want to be paid ingold. This trafficking in gold must be watched by the Illuminati, because goldhas always been an important commodity for the Satanic Hierarchy. Its value tothem goes beyond the monetary significance.In SummaryThe Triads are an occult fraternity which has developed into a majorinternational organized crime society. It has many agreements with variousfamilies of the Illuminati, and works with them. The Li family is taking a bigrole somewhere with the Triads, but exactly what that role is I have not spelledout yet.The Li Family is represented in Salem, OR and other West Coast cities by theWong Family, who are part of their bloodline."},{"pageContent":" The Onassis BloodlineCast f Main CharactersAristotle Socrates Onassis -- named after two Greek philosophers, went frombeing totally broke at age 21 to being a millionaire at age 23. His father’sfirst name was Socrates. Aristotle was an Illuminati king, a shipping tycoon, anintelligent ruthless hard-driving man, a man of the world who spoke a number oflanguages such as French, Spanish, English, Italian, and Turkish. He marriedJFK’s widow. His ever-present sunglasses made him look like Al Capone to anumber of people.Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis-Her father was a member of the Society of theCincinnati, the American equivalent to the Order of the Garter. Her father\"Black Jack\" was corrupt, what is known as a womanizer. He worked at making aliving from the stock market. Jackie’s \"step-father\" was the Auchincloss family,an elite family. Her step-father’s second wife before Jackie’s mother wasSenator Thomas Gore’s daughter. Her step-father was in Naval Intelligence.Jackie went to the schools that the children of the elite go to. On theanniversary of JFK’s assassination, Orville & Jane Freeman were the only ones toremember the date to say or do something about it. Jackie went that day toCentral Park and had a good cry.Stavros Niarchos-Aristotle’s brother-in-law and Ari’s business competition.Stavros’ parents came from Sparta, Greece. His relatives were rich. Stavros wentinto shipping and after W.W. II broke out, left Greece to avoid having to fightfor Greece. He was a close friend of Colgate, Roosevelt and Bernard Baruch, whohe would invite to his house on Long Island. He rented his Long island housefrom Harry Hopkins who was the man who told Pres. F.D. Roosevelt what to do.Even though he was a millionaire, he had a difficult time avoiding have toserve. Eventually, he managed to get himself situated as a naval officer inintelligence for Greece in Alexandria, Egypt. Information sent into the ‘69-70Who’s Who reference book about his war time exploits are fictitious. Niarchosand Aristotle were friends from 1934 onward, but also at times enemies trying tooutdo each other. Both frequently went to St. Moritz, Swit., a ski resort.Stavros also frequents an old Medici family Palace/estate near Turin where theDuke of Edinburgh and Baron Elie de Rothschild like to go and shoot birds. Theestate has many and it isn’t unusual for them to kill a thousand a day. Stavrosis an important leader of the Bilderbergers and a billionaire. He married HenryFord II’s daughter who was 38 years younger than he was, and divorced hershortly afterwards. He worked closely with David Rockefeller.Is the Onassis Bloodline Still Powerful?Aristotle Onassis died in 1975. His son and heir to his throne died in 1973. Myinside information about the Onassis family being one of the top 13 goes back tothe 1960s and 70’s. Is the family still powerful? One big clue that they stillwield power within the Illuminati is that Stavros Niarchos, Aristotle’sbrother-in-law, is a powerful Bilderberger. The executive committee of theBilderbergers are the equivalent to 9° of the branch Illuminati. Is the Onassisfamily still one of the top 13 Satanic bloodlines? I do not know. The answerlies in doing genealogical work to find out what the core satanic bloodline isthat curses through the Onassis family. One whistle-blower on the Illuminati wasDennis Brunnelle, a Grand Master of an OTO lodge, who became disillusioned withthe OTO’s Illuminati program. Some of his information touches on the Onassisfamily. My understanding of the Onassis family is limited in terms of theirSatanic activities with the Illuminati, but I will attempt to give my readers abetter understanding. My inside knowledge of the occult side-that is the secretsatanic ritual activities of the family is sparse, because my informants havevery limited knowledge of the Onassis participation. However, there arecertainly plenty of tracks in the sand which indicate who the business friendsof this family have been, and they have been very clearly those within theIlluminati or with connections to it.TurkeyThe area that is now known as Turkey played a major role in the MysteryReligions. The use of drugs to create \"religious\" experiences was developed to afine art by various occult fraternal mystery religion groups in the Turkey area.The Assassins from where we get the word hashish controlled parts of Turkey andLebanon in Medieval times. They used drugs to gain the allegiance of theirrecruits. Some of the most powerful figures for the Illuminati have been Turks.The Grand Orient has had some powerful figures in Turkey. For instance, at theMasonic Congress of the entire Grand Orients’ (that’s European Freemasonry-although several American presidents have been members of European Freemasonry)Grand Lodges, Bou Achmed came from Turkey. The Grand Lodge of Asia wasrepresented by Sebeyck-Kadir from Asia. Bou Achmed took a big role in the GrandOrient’s decisions. As a aside, let me explain one example of the power of theGrand Orient in America. The Grand Orient was originally strong in Louisiana butspread itself to many other US. locations. Garfield, a very powerful man in theGrand Orient, managed to become US. President because the political process gotdeadlocked at the convention and the Masons suggested him as a compromisecandidate. Although Garfield was an extremely powerful Mason, had been perhapsthe youngest general in the US. Army during the Civil War, the Illuminatiordered him shot after he had served about a year in office as President.Garfield was reported by an eye-witness to Satanic rituals to have participatedin the cannibalistic rites of Satanism done to gain the spiritual power of theeaten person. The Grand Orient Freemasonry has been linked to other orders ofFreemasonry that are also called Rosicrucians. Pope John XXIII joined aRosicrucian group that had links to European Freemasonry when he was in Turkey.While the secret Grand Orient Freemasonry was very strong in Turkey in spite ofits small numbers, the regular American Freemasonry granted a dispensation for aMasonic Lodge to operate in Smyrna, Turkey in May, 1863 but the charters werewithdrawn on Aug. 27, 1880. However, it is interesting that of all the Turkishcities, Smyrna was definitely the best place for Freemasonry to gain recruits.Men like Achmed Pasha and many of the other Pasha family have been leaderswithin Freemasonry and the Illuminati. Achmed Pasha was a Satanist and had alarge harem. Mehmet Talaat Pasha (1872-1921) was a Freemason and part of theTurkish revolution of 1908. He was the leader of the Young Turks, which was ajoint project of the Sufis and the Frankist Satanists. (The type of Satanism ledby the Frank family has had connections to Turkey for hundreds of years.) MehmetTalaat Pasha was the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Turkey. He was held thepolitical position in Turkey of grand vizier of Turkey (1917-18). AnotherTurkish Pasha was part of the Turkish royalty running Egypt when Egypt was partof the Ottoman Empire. His name was Khedive Ismail Pasha and he was Grand Masterof the Grand Lodge of Egypt. It was this Turk, Khedive Ismail Pasha, who gavethe famous Obelisk to the United States. This Obelisk was called Cleopatra’sNeedle and was originally erected in the city of the sun, Heliopolis, about 1500B.C. The Obelisk is a representation of a human penis, because sun worship,worship of regeneration (sex) and worship of the sun god Satan were all tiedtogether. Masons helped with the moving of the obelisk and its dedication whenit arrived in New York City. Large obelisks have been erected by Masons in NewYork, Washington D.C., Paris, the Vatican, and London. (If my memory serves mecorrect Berlin received one too at one time.)Every morning when the United States President wakes up he can look out thewindow and see the Masonic obelisk and be reminded of who controls America. 11the President has any training in the Mystery religion of ancient Egypt, he willalso know what body part is symbolically erected in the Washington Memorial. (Ifthe United States were ever to return to serving God, that monument would be agood one to destroy. God asked the Israelites not just simply to avoidworshipping such abominations, He asked His people to destroy them, for theirvery creation was abomination. This touches on the issues raised in anotherarticle in this newsletter.)The Illuminati of Europe via the Br. East India Co. wrested control from theGreat Moguls of the Opium trade during the 18th and 19th century. Peopleconnected the Br. East India Co. were responsible for the creation of the FabianSociety. The Illuminati, already headquartered in London in the 19th century,allowed John Jacob Astor (see Jan. 1, ‘93 newsletter about the Astor family)beginning around 1815 to operate an opium smuggling operation. Besides Astor’sships picking up quicksilver and lend at Gibraltar, and iron/steel from northernEurope, his ships picked up opium at Smyrna, Turkey. The opium was then sold inChina. The Onassis family was one of the top three merchant families in Smyrna.And Socrates Onassis until 1922 quietly ran a banking operation (or moneylaundering?) from their home which had a large amount of money left by powerfulTurks. Could Socrates’ father been part of a secret Illuminati opium connection,which had begun back about 1815 with the Astor family in Smyrna, Turkey? We knowfor certain that he had powerful British, Italian, and Turkish friends before hewas arrested in 1922, and that these friends saved his life from a deathsentence. About 1925-26, his son Aristotle Onassis, who was from Smyrna, Turkeybegan secretly importing opium into Argentina from Turkey, under the cover anddisguise of importing tobacco. The Grand Orient of Italy by the Jewish FreemasonEmannuele Carass established two secret lodges at Salonika, Turkey around theearly 20th century. The dialect of the Jews in that area is often mistakenlycalled ‘crude Spanish.\" Actually the language is Latino a Judeo-Spanish dialectspoken in Constantinople and Smyrna. A western Ladino is spoken in Salonika[8][part0000_split_019.html#_ftn8]), Bosnia, and Serbia. Masonic Jews speaking thisLatino language were part of the Masonic plot that started World War I. Numeroushigh level Masons were informed of the coming assassination of the Archdukewhich a thinking person could realize what and contradiction. Actually, I wouldstate it slightly different. His life is shrouded in smokescreens. However,there are records, documents, witnesses, etc. and it is possible to reconstructmany details about his life. I will attempt to reconstruct some of the detailsof that life as they pertain to his secret life as an Illuminati leader. TheIlluminati is divided into the drug/porn section, the political/businessmanagement section, and the cult ritual section, global communications section,and mind-control section. The leadership within the various areas overlap. Thedrug/porn/political areas work together as a unit. The mind-control area seemsto be somewhat technical and somewhat separate. Further, several groups havebeen identified as assigned the job of keeping the long range plans. The threegroups that have been entrusted with long range plans are the Order of theGarter, Order of the Quest, & Keepers of the Dawn. The plans to bring in the NewWorld Order are very detailed, and their management and safekeeping have notbeen haphazard. Aristotle worked within the drug/porn/political/businessmanagement area Aristotle’s power was so pervasive that some researchers of hisactivities concluded that he was absolutely the most powerful man on earth. Thisis because they were not aware of the shared power of the Illuminati \"kings\".Aristotle did have world-wide power, but that appearance of power was therebecause he was part of Moriah (the Satanic hierarchy which controls the world.)Aristotle Onassis’ family has had their misfortunes too. All of the top familiesare in competition, and although they work together they also fight together.Even within Aristotle’s own family, a stiff long time rivalry with hisbrother-in-law made life difficult for everyone associated with Aristotle. Andyet for all their competition, Aristotle invited Stavros Niarchos to spend timeon his yacht, which Jacqueline his wife detested immensely.Aristotle Leaves Greece and Goes to ArgentinaAristotle’s father had planned to send him to Oxford, but the Turkish genocideof the Greek Turks changed his plans. Aristotle instead set out from Greece toArgentina. Supposedly, Aristotle landed in Argentina stateless and broke. Fromwhat I can make out it appears to be true, although it is possible he had somecontacts to help the move to a foreign country. It is said that he finally founda job as a dishwasher in a bar on the corner of Corrientes & Talcahuano inBuenos Arles. Near the end of 1924, he was able to obtain a job later on withthe British United River Plate Telephone Co. (Argentina was at times called thefifth British Dominion because the British Rothschilds and other Britishinvestors owned so much of Argentina.) In the next few years, Aristotle provedhimself a very capable manager and with great potential as an underworld leader.Juan Gaoana, the boss of a leading Argentine cigarette manufacturing company wasthe first to put in an order through Aristotle to get tobacco from Turkey viaAri’s father in Greece. This tobacco importing was the cover for Adi’s opiumrunning. After two years, Onassis went into manufacturing cigarettes. Again thiswas a cover, but Onassis was out to prove himself in any way he could, so heillegally borrowed the name of a famous Argentine brand of cigarettes calledBIS, and labelled his cigarettes the same thing. The owner of BIS sued Onassisfor using his company’s name and won in court. The cigarette manufacturing wasclearly a losing deal, and Onassis got out of it. However, the biographiescredit his cigarette manufacturing as bringing in his wealth, while at the sametime acknowledging that he was losing money from them and had to dump thembecause they were unprofitable. Which is it? As I stated, Aristotle was runningdrugs into Argentina. Aristotle states that he was penniless when he arrived inArgentina at age 21, and that he had made his first million dollars by age 23.Long story short-the facts as to where he lived, what witnesses say etc. appearto collaborate that he went from having nothing to being wealthy within thosetwo years. His lifestyle changed dramatically. People blame his riches on thefact that he worked long hours. (I know many people who work long hours and arecreative and people just don’t move up the ladder that fast by working for aphone company and selling tobacco.)Aristotle’s FriendsAristotle Onassis associated with many powerful people. The fact that he rubbedshoulders with establishment figures that tie back to the elite is nothingsurprising of a person his wealth. However, it is the nature of his involvementwith other Illuminati figures that reveals his position within Moriah. Beforegoing into his Illuminati business ventures, let’s just discuss some of hisfriendships. An example of his visits to friends is this quote from the bookOnassis. ‘The Christina’s cruises always produced items which no alert gossipcolumnist could miss. Onassis dropping in on Prince Alfonso Hoheiohe’s MarbellaClub in southern Spain and lunching with Baron and Baroness Guy de Rothschild(amidst rumors that it was Rothschild money that had supplanted his own in MonteCarlo) was obviously a noteworthy social incident.’ (Onassis, p. 255) DuringW.W. II, Onassis was a regular guest of the movie mogul Spyros Skouras atMamaroneck on Long Island. Other close friends of Onassis were the Perons ofArgentina. The Perons set up a dictatorship in Argentina The Perons have a greatnumber of Nazi & Satanic connections/activities. If you get into studying aboutthe Perons you will come up with names such as Josef Mengele (a Satanic NaziDoctor), Dr. Fritz Thyssen, and Otto Skorzeny. Onassis had sexual liaisons withEvita Peron, who was a platinum blonde. Onassis had Nazi connections thatcontinued his whole life, as did the Perons. For instance, one of Onassis’s Naziassociates was Hjalmar Schacht, president of Hitler’s Reichbank, who Onassishired after the war. Schacht helped Onassis’ shipyards in Germany build tankersafter W.W. II. Until people realize that the real guiding hand behind the Nazi’swas Satanism they will continue to be misguided as to the way everythingconnects together at the top. For instance, John Foster Dulles was the man atVersailles Treaty who can be credited for having created the Treaty’s harshterms against Germany that ruined Germany financially after W.W. II. And yetthis same man, John Foster Dulles, was the person who secretly went to Hitler toconfirm to Hitler that the elite would financially back Hitler’s rise to power.If Hitler were anything like our image of him, Hider would have rung his neck,here before him was the man who made Germany suffer. Why was Hitler friendlywith this man? It makes no sense, unless people wake up to what is going on. Theanswer is that there is a conspiracy of those who are at the top to rule us, andto guide us toward a New World Order, and they are quite willing to sacrificewhole nations to do that. Onassis was an extremely close friend of WinstonChurchill. The Freemason Winston Churchill is a descendent of a family that hasbeen part of the elite that have secretly run the world. Winston Churchill onseveral occasions told Onassis that the only one he could trust in W.W. II wasJoseph Stalin. (This is a far cry from the picture given in history books.)Winston Churchill spent a great deal of time on Onassis’s yacht Christina.Onassis was also friendly with Winston Churchill’s friend of Bernard Baruch. Itwas Bernard Baruch who convinced Winston Churchill to join the Illuminaticonspiracy. He asked Churchill to come watch something important in NY in 1929,and then he showed Churchill how they could destroy the Stock Market. That showof power brought Churchill on board. Two other Illuminati friends of Ari Onassiswere Joseph Kennedy and Peter Grace, both men also belonged to top 13 Illuminatibloodlines. Gianni Agnelli, a powerful man in the Illuminati spent time on anumber of occasions on Onassis’s yacht Christina while it was in the Riviera.Years before JFK became president, Onassis had JFK and Winston Churchill on hisyacht at the same time. In 1928, the Illuminati men who controlled the major oilcompanies got together at Achnacarry Castle and formally created the AchnacarryAgreement which divided up the world into an international cartel. This is whyyou may have watched the same gas truck bring gas to all the different gasstations in an area, for instance, say a Sinclair station, a BP station(Rothschilds), and an Exxon station (Rockefeller). If the reader understands theworld’s oil was totally in an Illuminati monopoly by 1928, it will help youunderstand that Aristotle who was the man who built the largest oil tanker shipswas also Illuminati. In one year alone during the 1950s, Onassis bought 17 newtankers.Evidence of the ConspiracyOne of the most telling paper trail signs that the conspiracy has left behindwas an executive order that FDR signed just after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.This executive order was a semi-secret amendment to “Trading With The Enemy Act”which made it LEGAL to trade with the enemy if the Sec. of the Treasury (thenHans Morganthau) gave permission. Morganthau was a tool of the conspiracy, andof course he gave permission to the top Illuminati to trade with the enemy. (In1983, a book came out, Trading With The Enemy, which exposes how the elitesecretly kept Hitler going by supplying him, rebuilding his communications etc.Onassis as an Illuminati king worked with other elites Rockefeller, Kennedy,Getty to quietly make a profit and keep the war going longer. Onassis sold oiland guns to both sides. ITT telephones were used in German submarines. [ThisExecutive Order shows that at the top there is a conspiracy--it is reproduced onthe following pages.) There were 450 merchant ships owned by Greeks before W.W.II. Out of those Aristotle said 410 were sunk during the war. The official countwas 360. Either way it is clear that most of the Greek shippers lost their largemerchant ships. However, the German submarines and aircraft never once touchedAristotle’s ships although they sailed through war zones. Neither did theAllies. Aristotle alone did not suffer any losses. Aristotle’s large fleet didnot lose a single ship even the ones that were in Scandinavia when the Germansinvaded. Only the full collaboration at the highest levels could have pulledthat one off.Howard HughesHoward Hughes was a self-made millionaire and genius. Howard Hughes was not partof the system, so he was fair game to destroy. Even millionaires like Hughes andthe Hunt brothers have to toe the line, or they can be taken out by theIlluminati. This doesn’t mean Howard Hughes was virtuous. Howard Hughes gaveNixon’s brother Donald a quarter million dollar \"loan\" (gift) in 1956 in orderto continue having vice-pres. Nixon in his pocket. Hughes had been a supporterof Nixon for many years.Onassis infiltrated his own men into Hugh’s organization. Chester Davis was fromSicily, and although he worked for Hughes, took orders from Onassis. In 1955,Hughes had obtained two doubles, one named L. Wayne Rector and the other BrooksRandie. In March, 1957 Onassis’ men at the Beverly Hills Hotel captured HowardHughes using Hughes’ own disloyal men. Hughes was seriously hurt in thekidnapping. I believe at this point he was taken to Emerald Isle Hotel in theBahamas. (Some of the people who are aware that Onassis captured Hughes, disputethat Hughes was taken out of the country.) The top floor was rented for the\"Hughes Party\". For a month the captive Hughes was shot full of heroin, and thensecretly transported to a cell on Onassis’ private island of Skorpios. Hughestwo doubles stayed on under the pay of Onassis. One became Hughes, and the otherbecame Hughes’ double. Computer programs which can duplicate signatures wereused to provide Hugh’s signature. The computer and its program used forduplicating Hughes’ signature even became public knowledge when the Los AngelesTimes had an article on 1/28/71 about a computer which had been programmed towrite the signature of Hughes. The Mormon Mafia that supposedly guarded Hughesactually ran the Hughes empire for Illuminatus Onassis, which accounts for thechange in policies that were made by Hughes empire. It also explains why theybought up every newsreel they could find on Hughes in order to duplicatevoice-prints using computers. When they were through with the double L. WayneRector he was shot at Rothschild’s Inn on the Park, in London.In a meeting with fellow Satanist Joseph Kennedy in September, 1957, thedecision was taken to use the Mafia’s power to get John F. Kennedy elected. TheMafia was caught in Chicago tampering big time with the voting--but Nixon wasdenied a recount of the votes. Nixon backed off from making a fuss, because hewas promised the chance to be President later. Illinois Republicans made anunofficial recount of 699 paper ballot precincts in Cook County and came up withthe vote in favor of Nixon. Those votes would have changed Illinois’s electoralvotes and thrown the victory to Nixon. However, Sam Giancana and his henchmanMayor Richard Daley were not about to let an official recount take place. In1961, Joseph Kennedy had a stroke, and John Kennedy and Robert feeling theirfreedom, and disliking some of the powerful Illuminati like Aristotle Onassis,decided to use their popularity to destroy the conspiracy. I believe Kennedy andRobert had more courage to take on the conspiracy, due to the fact that theywere familiar with it from having been (in a sense) on the inside of it duringtheir days growing up. However, neither son had received the Illuminati trainingand indoctrination that their older brother had, and when he died. Joseph made amistake when he decided to replace Joe, Jr. with John (who they called Jack).The mistake was that John F. Kennedy may have seemed like he’d be a goodIlluminati President, but he actually thought for himself. He thought forhimself because he was young and with that impetuousness and vigor of youth, andwith the popularity he had, he had the possibility to do some good for thisnation. If I were state my evaluation, it would be to tell conservatives thatthey have been \"hoodwinked\". John F. Kennedy did more conservative (preservingthis nation) things in his Presidency than Nixon and Reagan who are heralded asconservative. Kennedy didn’t recognize Red China, no-- that was Nixon. Kennedydidn’t triple the national debt, no, that was Reagan. The CIA has been out toget JFK, ever since they realized JFK didn’t view himself as their puppet, butthat he viewed himself as their boss. The head of the CIA on purpose ruined theCIA’s chances to succeed at the Bay of Pigs. He personally prevented the CIA aircover from taking off, which the CIA knew that without air support, theoperation had no chance, which was soon proved correct. In everyone’s zeal toget JFK they blamed JFK. It all sounded so believable, because the CIA was goingto tell the full story. The public is not astute enough to realize that thepress had subtly turned against Kennedy. Two powerful friends who liked John F.Kennedy and wanted to help JFK fight the elite were taken out before Kennedy wasassassinated. Senator Estes Kefauver, who’s Crime Commission had discovered the1932 deal that Onassis, Kennedy, Meyer, Roosevelt, Lansky and otherIlluminati--Mafia figures had made. Kefauver was poisoned so that he had asecret poison induced \"heart attack\" on Aug. 8, 1963. One suspect that mighthave done it was his subordinate Bernard Fensterwald, who was also a CIAassassin. The other was Phillip Graham. His wife Katherine MEYER Graham has beena full participant of the conspiracy and shows up repeatedly in eliteactivities. Katherine bribed some psychiatrists to certify her husband who waseditor of the Washington Post was insane. He was ordered by a judge into amental hospital. When he was allowed to visit home on a weekend, he was found\"suicided\" by a shotgun. Bobby Kennedy had a good idea who shot his brother. Hewrote an unpublished book called The Enemy Within, and then later he wasassassinated too. Actually, the whole establishment was out to get Kennedy, andeven George Bush was involved with the assassination.The key to understanding the Illuminati is that it is headquartered in theLondon area. The Satanists (and witches) refer to Great Britain as the mothercountry Onassis had the best connections anyone could want in the BritishGovernment, as would be expected of someone of his standing in the illuminati.He had many British friends, just one example is Sir Lionel Heald, the Br.Attorney General. He attended the exclusive Br. Other Club. When W.W. II brokeout on Sept. 3, ’39, Onassis was living in Savoy Hotel where the headquartersfor the Illuminati’s Pilgrim Society are. The British London Times backedOnassis in his dispute with Peru over whaling. Onassis did finally get himselfinto trouble with illegal whaling when the nation of Norway gathered theevidence of his lulling of hundreds of whales that were illegal to hunt. Justtwo more quick examples of his social connections in Britain are his attendanceat J.Paul Getty’s party at Sutton Place, Eng. in the ‘50s, and Onassis’ own bigparty for the elite on 17 June ’58 at Dorchester, England. As explained in BeWise As Serpents, Britain’s overseas intelligence MI-6 is the Illuminati’s chiefintelligence agency.There is no way of knowing how many meetings took place dealing with theplanning of the assassination of Kennedy. The first were high level Illuminatimeetings. But the Illuminati meetings were not operational level meetings. Therewere several levels of meetings. Next, a series of meetings by BritishIntelligence at Tryall Compound at Montego Bay, Jamaica, and Mafia meetings atwho knows where. A minor trading company called Permindex was the cover to anassassination bureau that had its major U.S. subsidiary the International TradeMart in New Orleans. The FBI’s Division 5 was tied in with Permindex, andPermindex’s board of directors had U.N. posts, Mafia positions, European bankingties, Nazi ties, etc. In other words Permindex was well connected. By the timethe planning was done, it included certain elements of the CIA and Freemasons. AMajor Lauis Mortimer Bloomfield, Permindex’s Pres. & Chairman, a key player inHoover’s Division 5, and a member of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem (theProtestant branch of the Knights of Malta) was a homosexual lover of FBIdirector J. Edgar Hoover. All the board of Permindex and many of its varioussubsidiaries were in various areas in November, 1963 carrying out theassassination and cover up. One of the covers for the Permindex operators/teamswas to pose as missionaries of the American Council of Christian Churches(ACCC). The whole reason the elite set up the extensive ACCC was to have a coverfor their killing units. For instance, a group of about 30 of the best marksmenwere undercover as part of ACCC missionary school in Puebla, Mexico, The TolstoyFoundation (who I have visited with] were another pseudo \"Christian\" front.Later, the headquarters of this assassination group was shifted to ParadiseIsland, Grand Bahamas to Intertel. Ian Flemming’s novels write about a ThirdForce used to create a world government that was based in the resort islands ofthe Carribean. How true that has become. In the Westerns put out by Hollywood,when the bad guy does something to the good guy, he runs off with his woman.That is what happened with JFK. Onassis was one of the Illuminati kings whodecided JFK must go, and he got to run off with the dead man’s wife. Onassis hadalready gotten Jackie onto his yacht, sexually, prior to Kennedy’sassassination. Franklin Roosevelt, Jr. was on board together with Aristotie andJackie. Jackie didn’t enjoy her marriage to Onassis. At one point in theirmarriage when they were swimming nude at Onassis’ island Skorpios, tenphotographers with underwater cameras and telephoto lens captured Jackie nakedand her picture was splashed across Playboy and Hustler, etc. Jackie was furiousand wanted her husband to sue the newspapers and magazines, which he refused todo. A year before Aristotle died he actually admitted that he had planned thewhole operation. The date given for the actual Howard Hughes’ death, who hadbeen kept prisoner under horrendous conditions by Onassis, was Apr. 18, 1971. Inthe previous year 1970, Hugh’s purported autobiography had come out written byClifford Irving. Clifford Irving’s wife took the publisher’s check made out toHoward Hugh’s to one of Onassis’s Swiss banks, and was paid.Family DifficultiesOnassis’ second wife was Tina (Athina Mary Onassis) when she divorced herhusband for committing adultery said, \"It is almost thirteen years since Mr.Onassis and I were married in New York City. Since then he has become one of theworld’s richest men, but his wealth has not brought me happiness with him nor,as the world knows, has it brought him happiness with me.\"Tina divorced Ari and then went on to soon marry a relative of WinstonChurchill, the Marquess of Blandford. Later, she divorced him and married herold brother-in-law Stavros Niarchos in May, 1971. But after he killed her sistershe quit him too.Eugenia KilledEugenic, the sister-in-law of Ari Onassis, died according to the officialversion of an overdose of sleeping pills. Her body in the post-mortem wascovered with bruises, black left eye, swelling on the left temple. a hemorrhageto the left of the larynx and so forth down the rest of her body. Let’s notswallow the Illuminati’s propaganda to lull us into sleep about what they havedone.It might also be important to comment on the background of the Uvanos family.Both Stavros Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis married Uvanos girls.The Uvanos family was a prominent family on the Turkish island of Chios. Theisland of Chios had a type of tree, mastic trees that produced an early form ofchewing gum. From the word mastic is where we get the word masticate. Chios wasthe private property of the sultan and it was where he kept his harem. Theisland was given special royal treatment and allowed to have it full of chewinggum, and \"booze and broads\". The Uvanos family was one of the leading familieson this island.Basic Sources on Onassis Family * Interviews with people, and notes from other researchers. * Author’s own research. * Genealogy compiled from research notes of this writer Fritz Springmeier. * Frischauer, Willi.
