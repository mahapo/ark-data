Yet, many will not immedi ately see any connection. Many people if you ask them have only vague ideas about the Jehovah's Witnesses and Masons. To them the JWs are some overzealous people with some twisted religion, and the Masons are some group related to benevolence like the Shriners and their hospitals. Without a doubt, many people will not see any connection between their own liv es, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Freemasons. A number of people have advocated that \"Truth without love is too hard; Love without tr uth is too soft.\" This author firmly believes this. It's time to wake people up from their slumber. The Second Tower of Babel There is a coming New World Order planned by the secretive leaders of the Jehovah' s Witnesses that should scare the socks off anyone including the JWs themselves. However, if this New World Or der were only in the hands of Jehovah's Witnesses to initiate, we could relax, because they have only minimal political cl out, few guns, and teach non- participation in war. It's when we get the bigger picture that we realize these people are talking about something serious. This author's research has led him to conclude that the 1- world-government 1-world-reli gion that the New Age has planned for us, and the 1-worl d-government and 1-world- religion that the Freemasons such as the Grand Orient have planned, and the Watchtower Society's New Order are one and the same. Before you dismiss this as sensationalism, you owe it to yourself to investigate a scheme that has enough high calibre people of all walks of life worldwide involved in bringing it to fruition. Like the French Revolution, many people may be involved without realizing what is taking place. Some may unwittingly support this new revolution. Perhaps it may be only such help as your neighbor giving a small \"donation\" for a WT book. Your neighbor may then go back into his house,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS and as he watches the news feel frustrated because what he sees happening in world events does not make sense to him. The Witnesses' literature will provide him a prepackaged explanation of world events. Once he buys into this, he is theirs. However, this book give s the reader the inside story about that prepackaged explanation. Also we will find out that there are three groups with identical plans for a New World Order. The reader will also find out that these three are connectioned. This book is a preliminary investigation. Should the good Lord see fit, it will someday be followed with more pertinent information. The book begins with curiosity about the Jehovah's Witnesses strangeness. It pro ceeds to examine the story of their founder Pastor Charles Taze Russell. Because Russell's history is a liability to the Soci ety, they have tr ied to distance themselves from C.T. Russell, while at the same time in general carrying forth his ideas. The Author has confirmed Russell's Masonic membership. Now the reader knows the bottom line even though Chapter two and three are written in a very speculative fashion. Howe ver, they call an array of facts and clues to the reader's attention. Facts that call for answers. This book was never intended to answer all the reader's questions. This publication has always been intended as a vehicle to get pe ople to think. Everyday we act on plausibilities, so it is nothi ng unusual for this Author to ask the reader to think, peruse these clues, and then to investigate further on his own into these things. The book covers the second WT President's modus operandi in covering up the use of a demonic WT healing device. It also shows how demons played the crucial role in channeling information to the Watchtower leaders. Each of these items is just a piece in the puzzle about who these men are, and what their objectives are. This book will help you understand the mindset of the first two presidents of the WT Society. The men today involved in sc heming for this new order do not think like many of us. Their mindset is power and control. Therefore, the Orwellian world they are bringing in is not the type of world you and I would bring in.

The seven volumes of Charles Taze Russell's Studies in the Scriptures had this strange Winged-Sun-Disk. 1 Russell spoke of the Gold en Age to come.

However, I do distinctly remember the first impression as a Christian—\"this is weird.\" How does one investigate something strange like this? It does have its difficulties. First, it's like being a policeman who comes upon a suspicious car accident. If he rules it \"an accident\", rather than a homicide, he will limit his approach in gathering clues. On the other hand, if he assumes the worst and views it as a homicide, he will collect all th e evidence he can. This book is an attempt to gather evidence. Yes, the fact that the policeman gathers facts means he's suspicious. It doesn't mean anyone is guilty. Certainly today, Je hovah's Witnesses do not join Masonic Lodges and Orders. After years of indepth study of the Jehovah's Witnesses, and learning what I could about the Freemasons by talking to Freemasons, talking to ex-F reemasons, reading, going to public lodges events, etc. I offer the following conclusions and cautions when beginning research. Researching a book on Jehovah's Witnesses and Freemasons, both secretive orga nizations, is a challenge. Both publish propoganda based on what they want you to think, rather than history. Morey, in The Origin and Teachings of Freemasonry, goes so far as to quote respected Masons who themselves warn othe r Masons that most of their own history books are in large part fiction and unreliable. Not all Masonic writers identify themselves as being Masons. The Jehovah's Witnesses' literature is biased and loaded with ficticious information. Several writers have taken them to task for scholastic dishonesty. That is, they have a penchant for misquoting others. On the other hand, Protestant and Catholic material is biased t oo, for they may be latching onto superficially learned knowledge in a effort to counteract others. Expect the Masons' bias to be to show their legitimacy and antiquity. Less of this appears in recent times. Expect big differences between European Masonry and American Masonry. Expect to meet both Mas onic and non-Masonic writers with the incorrect view that all Freemasons have a common"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"STRANGE VIBES 3 purpose, common beliefs, and common methods. The Freemason next door may sincerely believe the Freemasons are innoculous, for he regards his own personal experience as universal, without bothering to ge t an historical perspective. Some Masonic groups are not so benign. Any secret organization such as the Masons is a ready-made organization for mischief should scheming men control it. But the non- Mason should be slow to imagine any grand conspiracy scheme. Masonry, even if leaks of an invisible high level organization are true, may not be united enough for a single grand scheme. The American Freemasons, today about 3 million strong, experience the lodge mostly in terms of a philanthropic fraternity. Still, expect them to confuse and deceive to protect their secrets. 2 Expect the Jehovah's Witnesses to portray a selfless, pristine perfect organization, to hide or gloss over doctrinal controversies, to change histor y to match \"present truth\", and to cover over anything embarra ssing. Each group has kernals of truth in their positions and biases. Yet truth with embellishments is no longer truth, but a distortion. In this investigation, you are the ju ry— even as this goes to press the facts and evidence are not all in. In a court of law, every witness has his chance on the stand. There are some sources th at are quoted that the Author would not endorse without some reservations.

My experience as a world traveler and a histor y buff is that I marvel at how much continuity a modern peopl e has with their ancestors. For instance, one day in a restaurant while I was waiting for a meal, I was studying some ancient Egyptian cursive handwiting from the 19th Dynasty. That means this handwriting was about 3,300 years old, and this hieratic (the ancient Egyptian cursive) is a different system than the modern arabic script used today in Egypt. An Arab approached me and started a conversation, because he thought I was reading Arabic. It caused me to reflect. The Egyptians had been conquered by the Assy rians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, and had gone through using various scripts, yet they choose to use the Arabic script which resembles the hieratic they had used in the centuries before Christ. (The word \"choose\" is used on the premise people are responsible for their behavior.) People also tend to build, to adapt on past ideas. People tend to borrow ra ther than create new. When we see something \"new\" arrive in history, such as the alphabet, a person then looks for clues as to when that alphabet was introduced. It is valid then to question where \"new\" ideas spring from. They rarely come from a vacuum. When Charles T. Russell cr eated a new religious body, his ideas did not come out of a vacuum. Various scholars have tracked down Russell's ideas to all kinds of heresies."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS 6 Where did all these strange beliefs come from? My early exposure to the Jehovah's Witnesses piqued my curiosity. For instance, why call one's meeting place a hall? why not Kingdom meeting, or Kingdom assembly, or Kingdom study, or church, or chapel, or tabernacle, or temple, or something else? why hall? Why all the secrecy? Why are the writers and the leaders of the Watchtower Society cl ouded in secrecy? Why have no membership records been kept? The answer given, that it was a security measure in case of persecution didn't satisfy me. Other groups equally persecuted made other choices, choices that are not secretive. They would say, we trust God and are willing to suffer for Him, so why be secretive? What have we to hide. The choice to be secretive is just that, choice. And that decision and other attitudes ar e instilled from the top down. That is, from the Watchtower President and now the Governing Body down the \"pyramid\" to the masses of JWs. The answer to where JWs recei ve their strange beliefs, strange doctrines, and attitude s comes primarily from two men. Because primarily only two men, Charles Taze Russell and Joseph F. Rutherford made all the decisions of the Watchtower Society for the beginning 60 years. 2 It is important to understand their overwhelming contribution. 2 Franz, Ray. Crisis of Conscience.

The he resies concerned the extent of Christ's atonement, along with some leaders adopting the Arian view of Christ. Several synods were cut off and some offenders disfellowshipped. 5 The author hasn't confirmed which side of the disputes Joseph was on, but there are indications. Charles T.

He started a business soon after arriving in America. At age 11, his son Charles wrote up a c ontract which made him and his father partners in his clot hing store. This would develop into a chain of five men's clothing stores. 10 Pastor Russell would buy his father's store in 1884; his father would get land in Florida. Charles grew up zealously accepting the Presbyterian worldview and heritage of hi s parents. His personality took him on a journey that left th e Presbyterian church. In many ways, his world view reflected his heritage and it was basically established by the e nd of his teenage years. His father at age 54 joined Russell's group and worked in accord with Charles until his death in 1897. One of his uncles, also named Charles T. Russell, and who also had a store, 11 was sympathetic of Russell's later religious course and left Charles T.,Jr. a large sum of money. (That sum greatly increased Charles' wealth; he invested some of that money.) 12 Considering the evidence, Charles' doubts about orthodox Christian doctrines may have been a reflection of his father's doubts. Perhaps his mother's early death furthered his serious and intense religious nature. His father promoted his maturity and independence by giving him so mu ch responsibility early in life.

It is important also to realize that his intense personality absorbed emotional e xperiences to a greater extent than most people, and that th ese feelings endured longer, were retained longer than most people do. This is the picture of a very capable multi-talented person who sets out on his own track, determined to cont rol his own destiny and who can not be deterred by anyone. 13 Those concepts he embraced early in life set his course. Perhaps because of his father's good nature, Charles T. Russell found it difficult to conceive that his heavenly Father would eternally punish people. Th is difficulty caused him to reject the doctrine of hell, which then had further consequences. A person does not reject the eternal punishment spoken of in the Sc riptures without having to make some major revisions in other doctrines too.

Subsequently, their imaginations aid them by provi ding explanations about these causes for which these threaten ed individuals have such a dependence upon. This describes the route Russell took. That is, later when he sought answers, he would seek it from those who had hidden knowledge and revelations. What about the route Russell t ook? First, he rejected his Presbyterian Church for the more liberal Congregational Church. There was just one in town, a Welsh Congregational Church . Then he rejected the Congregational Church when he tried to convert an \"infidel\" friend (one source says \"pool hall friend\"). He was unable to defend his religion to his friend, especially why a just God would torment people in hell. This caused him to question his minister and a Professor from the Allegheny Th eological Seminary about the Bible's reliability. They did not answer him to his satisfaction, so he rejected Chri stianity and requested a letter of dismissal from the church. 15 His steps to peace and away from orthodoxy, according to his own words, were first a total rejection of scriptural authorities, then a reliance upon himself, then a peace of heart and then finally, a desire for revelation. In an interview with the Jamestown Evening Journal. Sat. Aug.6, 1910, Russell says that after rejecting Christianity, \"I bowed my knee, and worshipped an unknown God, saying 'Great Creator who made me, I reverence thee...My heart found rest...This started me to look for a divine revelation.\" He became intrigued with religious ideas that called fo r imagination an d a belief in mysteries and hidden knowledge.

A study of Russell's life, shows no interest on his part of jo ining the anti-Ma sonic campaign. The worst enemy of the Maso nic Lodge was the Catholic Church. In modern times, the Masons have successfully obtained supporters and a few members from their long time opponent, the Catholic Church. 37 When Russell was a 33, Pope Leo XIII made it anathema for Catholics to join the Masons. This act drew no acclaim from Russell. Russell refers to the Catholic Church as the Jezebel of 2 Kgs. 9 in his second volume, p.256. And Russell does seem to echo the Masons Albert Pike, Mazzini, and others in his strong anti-Catholic attacks, who also, like Russell, branded the Pope and his hierarchy as ag ents of the Antichrist. Both Russell and these men call the Ca tholic church \"Babylon the Great.\" Considering Russell rejected the Protestant doctrines, it seems rather Masonic-like that he dislikes the Catholics to such an extreme. 36 Reading Russell's series of sermons advocating the Protestant denominations to me rge, highlights how much he lumped them together. 38 In Thy Kingdom Come (1891) the defilements and persecutions of the Pope are mentioned.

There does seem then to be some justification,to see hi s anti-Catholic behavior as more than simply a doctrinal disagreement. This is displayed in Russell's World Tour. Russell seems to have connections to people he'd never met. Masonic connections- Masonic help? At any rate, Russell concludes at the end of a world tour that there was no market for his message in Catholic countries. He felt his message could be marketed in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Scandinavia 39 (which by then Scandina via had a strong Masonic membership, remember that King Gustavus V of Sweden was Grand Master of Swede n, and King Edward VII of England was at one point the Grand Master of England's Freemasons.) 40 If Russell really believed in his message and that God was behind him, why did he feel heathens would come more readily than Catholics to his message? Now if the Masons were supporting him, this might offer an explanation that would make this more understandable. Russell claimed to have spent the two years after he rejected the Congregationa l Church studying Eastern religions. In one sermon, he lists several like Buddhism, but adds that there were others. The author has read much of what Russell wrote and said, a nd has yet to see evidence of indepth knowledge on the part of Russell toward Buddhism, Hinduism, or Islam. This author theorizes that the Eastern religions he studied most were likely those that the Masonic Eastern Star would study, such as the study of the Egyptian and Middle East paganism that is so important to Masonry.

The only connection that the author has found between the OES and Russell are his meetings there. But it can be asked, what Masonic symbolism was Russell's astute mind exposed to? It is important to bear in mind that Russell was adept at picking and choosing within his mind the facts, arguments, and evidences he cared to regard. It can be depended upon, that Russell accepted new information which he was predisposed to accept. His shell was hard to penetrate, because he was a good speaker, had exceptional abilities to bluff, to feign confidence, and maintain himself before audiences in situations where others would have lost face. These all contributed to his ability to filter out what he didn't want to accept. 42 A scholar of C.T. Russell co mmented once that it is unknown when Russell became Arian. (Arian referring to Anus' heresy in believing that Christ is only a good man, and not Almighty God.) M. James Pe nton in his excellent work Apocalypse Delayed writes (p.14) , \"Much attention has been devoted to Russell's concepts and teachings; surprisingly little has been paid to the sources thereof; either by his friends or by his enemies.\" Penton does a good job of accurately portraying Russell as an honest man, albeit often the victim of his own sincere misguided self-deception. So when Russell obviously lies under oath in a court of law to protect his friends,( see p.57) and does it without remorse or difficulty, does this mean he was after all dishonest? Russell in general lived up to his beliefs. He was, as people go, an honest person. The author believes the answer lies in the Masonic concept that to lie to protect a brother is not a lie, but the truth. To conceal hidden knowledge is not a lie to them; indeed it is their moral duty to deceive in order to \" protect truth.\" Such a concept is not scriptural, nor is it taught by the Christian churches including the adventist groups Russell associated with.

What about his Arian views, did Pastor Russell get these from the Masons? The Masonic Doctrine does not recognize Christ as Almighty God (individuals on th e lower levels may possibly hold their own views), however it appears that Russell's heresy goes deeper than that. It may have created an atmosphere conducive for him to investigate Freemasonry, but the heresy probably de rived from his heritage. His heritage? Yes. The author concurs with Pent on that little attention has been given to the sources of Russell's beliefs. When attention has been directed towards th em, people have studied the Adventists, and totally neglected to focus on his family. This has been a serious overs ight. The author believes it is time to correct this. Charles T. Russell not only worked hand in hand with his father Joseph L. in business, but also in their religious endeavors. There is not the sli ghtest trace of discord between father and son. The whole tenor of their relationship and cooperation, leads the author to conclude that Charles derived some of his thinking from his father. When Charles started a Bi ble study, it was not long before his father joined him and his little group. During the 1880s, both father and son married two Ackley sisters, Maria F. and Me linda P. Both of which were supportive of the religious r oute they were taking. Maria helped Russell write his books a nd contributed ar ticles in the Watch Tower magazines.(Later he lost his wife to divorce and his father to death in the same year, 1897.) Both Russell and his father were businessmen who went out and marketed C.T. Russell's views. The rest of their family seemed to help out. Russell's sister, who worked side by side with him for years, felt he was the greatest man alive. Charles T. Russell obviously wa s not violating his father's own beliefs when he went off on these wild heresies early on in life. Indeed, Charles and his si ster Margaret stated that he had been chosen before he wa s born for his religious work. Perhaps, Joseph L., (like Joseph Kennedy who had goals for"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"IDEAS DONT COME OUT A VACUUM 21 his son to be President) had goals for Charles. And if Charles had been encouraged to go forward in such things, then that could help account for his sister's great admiration for him. He had fulfilled her father's wishes. His sister Margaret outlined how God planned and chose her brother when she gave a testimony at the Put-In-Bay Convention. God planted a seed with the early church. But the seed lay dormant for centuries. \"In due time\" the seed of truth grew and was watered according to God's plan. During the Dark Ages the seed of trut h was barely kept alive waiting for God's chosen one to bring it to fruition. When it was time, God \"annointed the eyes\" of her brother at age 17, and \"God's smile of favor rested upon him.' Her brother was the faithful one God could depend upon, the \"one who despite the burden and heat of the day\" would be the faithful one for God. 43 Perhaps too much attention has been given to the men that Russell listened to, and not enough on why he listened to them. Why was Charles predisposed to listen to George Storrs, Barbour and Paton? If we consider George Storrs, for instance, here is the man second only to Pastor Russell's father, to have influenced Charles. Russell wasn't a blank mind being impressioned by a venerated teacher, but rather Charles rejected some of Storrs' strongest beliefs, such as his militant anti-slavery stand. It wasn't that Charles was awed by the man. It was because they shared common views that made them friends. Because they shared mutual views on Christ and the Atonement, and Charles then liked his Conditionalism (that is, his forceful views agai nst the immortality of the soul --which supported Russell's disd ain for the doctrine of hell) The impression sometimes written is that Russell met Storrs and was led by Storrs to all th ese heresies. On the contrary, Charles met Storrs, because he shared those heresies. Charles just needed someone to provide the accurate defense of those views. Charles didn't immediately know all the ins and outs to NOTES___________________ 43 The Laodiciean Me ssenger, pp 179-180"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"22 __THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS support his early ideas. He didn't know the full consequences of his sometimes vague and confused ideas. But there seems to be evidence that Charles' father came over from the old country with Arianism and un-orthodox atonement views. Charles was never instilled with orthodox views of Christ and the atonement. Consequently, there was never a rebellion against his fath er. What we're looking at is a long legacy of heresy. One could perhaps start the stor y with the terrible period of northern Ireland known as the period of \"the black frost.\" On the evening of Dec. 26, 1739 a frost appeared that remained until Feb. 15. The sun seldom was seen, and the frost was unusually dark in appearance. Consequently, famines and unproductive harvests followed afterwards. A scheme was approved to create \"The Widows' Fund\". Long-story short \"The Widows ' Fund\" brought the large majority of orthodox Presbyterians in close contact with un- orthodox Presbyterians whom they had shunned. The General Synod, being orthodox, was fearful of any reconcilliation, but the establis hment of this Widows' Fund created an opportunity and an avenue for the Non-subscribers to begin fellowshipping w ith the orthodox majorities. Now at this time, all the young men from Ulster who wanted to be ministers went to the University of Glasgow, Scotland. There they were instructed by Profesor Simpson, who taught them Arian views. Thomas Boston turned out to be the only minister who took a stand against this heresy. For that he would be named At hanasius after the defender of the trinity in the fourth century. 44 As the decades of controversy would reveal, many of the other professors also happened to be Arian in belief. So it took many years before the judicatories of the Church of Scotland took the mild action of suspending Prof. Simpson. Another heretic professor was Dr. Francis Hutcheson, Professor of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow. He possessed a NOTES 44 MacLeod, John.

It appears the young minds of the students were not as discerning as the average Presbyterians. For instance, when Hutcheson substituted for his father at his father's c hurch, the congreg ation got up and all walked out during his serm on. One of the elders meeting his father said, \"We a' feel muckle wae for your mishap...your silly son, Frank, has fashed a' the congregation wi' his idle cackle; for he has been babbling this oor aboot a gude and benevolent God, and that the souls of the heathens themsels will gang to heeven...not a word does the daft boy ken, speer, nor say aboot the gude auld, comfortable doctrines of elec tion, reprobation, original sin, and faith.\" So generations of young susceptible minds were led into heresy by the staff of this university. This theological training explains why Ulster C ounty churches were Arian in view for many years, and how the New-Light movement was able to steadily progress, a nd ultimately take over control of the Synod of Ulster, Ireland. Several other factors happened to occur during this century, to excerbate the dete rioration of orthodox belief in Ulster. The Established Church of Ireland and the Episcopal churches sank into apathy and heresy during this period too. For instance, the Right Reverend Dr. Robert Clayton who was bishop of Killala, of Cork, and Ross , and Clogher went so far as to publish an attack on the trinity with his long titled Essay on Spirit, wherein the doctrine of the Trinity is considered in the light of reason...and the doctrine of the Trinity as maintained by the Egyptians....Platonists,...\" The Synod of Ulster degenera ted for several generations into heretical views of salvation and Christ. Published sermons during this time period showed little understanding by Ulster's ministry for the Ch ristian doctrine of salvation. In 1755, the Lord raised up an effective minister Mr. Clark, whose pamphlets called attention to errors of the Synod of Ulster.

Silently over the next 50 y ears, the orthodox believers gained in strength. In 1808, Re v. James Homer at the annual Synod of Ulster declared that a code of disciplinary laws to govern the synod would be drawn up. So confident were the Arians of their strength that they did not oppose a clause in the new code which required a subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith. The code passed almost unanimously in 1824. They figur ed they could easily evade the letter and the spirit of th e code. One of the most gifted ministers in the area, promptly declared war on Arianism. The struggle began. By Friday, 27 June, 1828 the Synod pledged to set up a committee to examine candidates for the ministry, so that all who denied the doctrine of the Trinity, justification by faith, and regeneration by the Holy Spirit, would be excluded from the ministry. By July 30, 1829, the Arians knew they were beat, and many of them formed their own synod. The strength and numbers of the Arians continued to decline over the next years. 45 In 1841, the Arians and the Trin itarians clashed again in the Scottish Presbyterian churches. And from this hotbed of heresy in Ulster comes Charles T. Russell's parents. Need one speculate why Charles' father and uncle weren't trinitarians? They were not trinitarians in America, is it not reasonable to assume they were not trinitarians back in Ire land, before they immigrated? Charles T.

Russell's answer is,\"In our judgement the majority of 'secret societies' are merely beneficiary and have no secret schemes antagonistic to the gene ral public welfare, the secret rites and ceremonies being merely 'boys' play,' occupying the time and attention of pers ons who have no greater aims than those which pertain to the present life.\" In this, one catches a glimpse of the impatient drive of a reformer caught up in his pursuit of religion. Russell points out that for people who have no ambition toward the future life in paradise, the rites and ceremonies are harmless games. The implication being, if one is interested in the future Golden Age, he will not waste time in such organizations.

Quoting Russell, \"We note also that the Order of Free Masons, if judged by its past history, has some secret object or scheme, more than fraternity and financial aid in time of sickness or death. And, so far as we can judge, there is a certain amount of profane wo rship or mummery connected with the rites of this orde r and some others, which the members do not comprehend, but which, in many cases, serves to satisfy the cravings of the natural mind for worship, and thus hinders it from seeki ng the worship of God in spirit and in truth—through Christ, the only appointed Mediator and Grand Master.\" 2 This reply by Russell is significant. From it one notices that a. Russell doesn't oppose secret societies except that they take time from his mission which he is trying to inspire the world about. b. Russell has an intimate know ledge of the Masons. He knows how their members feel, and how the upper degrees promote profane worship. Finally, if the article is read to its conclusion, Russell advises even against belonging to insurance companies for they will be \"very insecure dependencies when the time of trouble will have fully commenced...\", and insurance does injury to children who inher it money, and it is more noble to leave a legacy of religious separation from banks and insurance companies than to leave money to one's children. He advises, \"Trust in the Lo rd\". Give all your money and time to the Lord's service. Interestingly, Russell doesn't follow his own advice. He takes out insurance policies and uses the banks as he wheels and deals. In 1912, he states privately, \"I have taken out NOTES __________ 1 Robinson, James. Born In Blood.

Russell preaches, \"The great Messiah...has long been waited for ...for thirty five centuries the Jews have waited...Freemas ons have waited twenty-five hundred years for the same glorious personage, as Hiram Abiff, the great Master Mason whose death, glorification and future appearing are continually set before them by the letters upon their keystones.

He even st ated that the resurr ected Christ was at the center of the s un. (WT R 5135) When Charles T. Russell calls Hiram Abiff the Messia h and says that the pagan Masonic religion is based on the Bible, then this is significant. If Russell isn't a Freem ason, at this point he sure is doing a good job of sounding like one. It may appear that Russsel is only indicating that Masons believe Hiram Abiff is the Messiah. However, more is happening here than at first me ets the eye. Russell definitely calls Hiram Abiff \"the same personage\" as the Christian/Jewish Messiah. While it true some Jews wait for the Messiah, and the Moslems await Christ's return, the person of Hiram Abiff is differ ent. In interviewing an active 32° Mason, the author was told, \"Hiram Abiff is not the Messiah, but only a good man, like Buddha, or Moses. Someone we can learn a lot from.\" Yet, Masonic sources and some of their best references show that in spite of their public denials, they do view Hiram Abiff as the Messiah figure. Since Russell would not have learned that Freemasons view Hiram Abiff as the Messiah from a casual conversation with a Mason, he must have learned it from an indepth study of the Masons. Th e author has never heard or read in 20 years of sermons, a ny Christian preacher showing Christ's Messiahship by appealing to parallels to Hiram Abiff. For instance, the reader will look in vain at Billy Graham's sermons for any such references. It is significant then that Russell refers to Hira m in his sermons as being the Mason's name for the Messiah.

There is evidence that Russell learned his hermeneutics from Swedenborg. 12 Also Swedenborg who wrote a number of books stressed some of the same mystical ideas that Russell would use. Milton S. Terry in B i b l i c a l Hermeneutics says Swedenborg, \"sets himself up as a new oracle, and while assumming to follow the written word of God, puts forth his own dictum as a further revelation.\" From where did Swedenborg draw his ideas? From the Kabalah and other Masonic sour ces. Albert Pike 28th °, in his standard Masonic referen ce. Morals and Dogma, p. 744, says, \"All truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return to it; everythi ng scientific and grand in the religious dreams of the Illuminati, Jacob Boeheme, Swedenborg, Saint Martin, and others is borrowed from the Kabalah: all Masonic associa tions owe it their secrets and their symbols.\" (p. 741 continues) \"Masonry is a search after Light. That search leads us back, as you s ee, to the Kabalah. In that ancient and little understood (source-book) the Initiate will find the source of many doctrines ; and (he) may in time come to understand the Hermetic philo sophers, the Alchemists, all the Antipapal Thinkers of the Middle Ages, and Emanuel Swedenborg.\" The author remembers one ev ening when he was sharing his faith in Christ with a Wa tchtower official, when this lifetime JW began talking about the Kabalah, which he had studied.

It may not be so well known that WT articles and some of their books admit that Yahweh is technically more correct. They defend their usage by saying Jehovah is more commonly used by people. This is a strange logic, it is rare that they defend something wrong by saying \"it's right because the majority of people do it wrong.\" Russell said the name Jehovah should not be translated. (WT R p.1410) Their word Jehovah is the overriding centerpiece of their religion. God saved the Isrealites just to ma ke his name Jehovah known. Jesus' primary mission was to vindicate the name Jehovah after the angels had reproached the name. See Rutherford's Angels, p. 31. This overemphasis came when Freitag declared how God is the Lawgiver. He has placed the Law on the automatic track of cause and effect. Because of that, there is no challenge to God's sovereignity here. Consequently, there is no punishment nor can there be a reward from God. (This negates Christ's work of atonement.) Rutherford then gained the upper hand by transliterating the universal law and no guilt concept of Freitag by claiming that \"God lost His good name in the fall\" and that now \"this name must first be vindicat ed before there ca n be deliverance.\" MASONRY The Masonic reference book Morals and Dogma (1871) published by the Supreme Masonic Council of 33 °, p.97, states that the transl ation of the Tetragrammaton as \"I am that I am\" is \"wretched\". True, a few Christian scholars have questioned whether this is th e most proper translation, but they have never considered the spurious word \"Jehovah\" as a sacred special word like the Jehovah's Witnesses and Freemasons.

In 1880, Russell \"discovered\" that \"The use of the word mediator in the Scriptures is restricted to the mediating of covenants between God and man, \" and since the church is not under any mediated covena nt then the church has no mediator at all.

Note, they advertise Russell's book as a \"key\"; they say every assertion of Russell is well sustained by Scripture, and that it is impossible to read the book without loving Russell its author. Another Watchtower add proclaims Russell as very orthodox. \"Pastor Russell\" a column paid for by IBSA-Chr.

WATCHTOWERS To understand the importance of watchtowers to masons one only needs to understand what the origin of the Freemasons is.

According to Ferguson, 50 Million Brothers, he combined presbyterianism and existing lodges into a beautiful system veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. Another historian writes that Anderson t ook Christianity out of the Masons and instead established it on the principles of charity, fraternity, and mutual assistence. In the 1970s on the inside of the cover under \"The Purpose of the Watchtower \" one could read, \"Every watchtower has its purpose. It serves as an elevated place for a wide-awake person with sharp vision. It enables him to see far ahead into the distance and tell those below for whom he is a watchman what is drawing near, whether it is a danger against which to prepare or it is something good over which to be glad with strong faith and hope.\" However, the leitmotiv of the watchman as it occurs in the 1970s was not so strong in Russell's time. The idea of a castle tower was actually expressed in equal implication. During the 1880s-1890s, Russell's publishing company was actually named Tower Publishing Co. However, due to a need to change his assets, to prevent his ex-wife from getting anything, the Tower Publishing Co . transferred all its assets on Apr. 1,1898 to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The Tower Publishing Co., published everything for Russell from the time he had quit si mply placing his name as publisher. It ceased printing with the Apr. 1, 1898 WT . The next issue printed by the WTB&TS gives a notice of the transfer on the inside of the cover. Russell referred to his magazine as \"Towers\". Today, of course they are called Watchtowers for short. The id ea of the watchtower has not been entirely lost, there has never been any watchman portrayed by the Society on the Watchtowers. If it wasn't that castles were important to the Masons as a symbol of their work, then it wouldn't raise questions why of all the many choices, he decided to pick a castle tower as his central idea. His early issues carried a rising sun. The rising sun is another important Freemason sy mbol.

In 1119, a group of Crusader knights, nobles who were billeted in the King of Jerusalem's pa lace, took vows of poverty. They sought to prot ect the Holy Sepulcher, and other holy sites, and pilgri ms coming to the Holy Land. Because the King of Jerusale m's palace was built on King Soloman's Temple site, these knights were named \"Poor Knights of the Temple.\" For years, the Knights Temp lar built and manned castles throughout the Holy La nd. Some of these still stand. They made the way safe by escorting pilgrims. Ov er the years this Military Crusading Order grew numerous and rich, possessing property throughout Europe. The Knights' Templars built castles like this one in the Holy Land. A mural in the Templar chapel of Cressac, western France, from 1170-80 shows a Templar Knight leading two other knights into the crusader victory at Krak. The author will let Peter Partner's excellent book The Knights Templar and Their Myth pick up the story.(on the Book's cover and also p. xvi) \"At the end of the 13th century, after their withdrawal from Syri a, they became the apparently innocent victims of a campaign of slander and persecution mounted against them by the French government. \"The ruthless dissolution of the Knights Templar was only the beginning of a new and strange chapter in their"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"RUSSELL & MASONIC KNIGHTS TEMPLAR 93 history. They soon became the focus of numerous beliefs about their presumed occult powers, and by the 18th century their history had undergone a mythical metamorphosis—they figured highly in occult fantas ies of magical practices and hidden knowledge.\" Today thanks to historians like Peter Partner, the sad ending of this Order is accurately known. The Greenwood Encyclopaedia of American Institutional Fraternal Organizations, p.194, recounts the fa te of the order, \"Ruling princes, hard pressed for m oney, envied the Templars. Phillip IV of France (reportedly denied membership in the Templars) with the help of Pope Clement V succeeded not only in having the Pope disba nd the order but in having its grand master, Jacques de Molay, burned at the stake in 1314.\" 1 Phillip IV arrested many thous ands of these knights and after torturing false confessions of heresy from them, killed thousands of them for heresy. Their large land holdings and wealth were confiscated--(a more accurate word might be stolen). The manner of the Knights' Templars demise, led to fables and hopes which gave impetus to the creation of the Masonic Knights Templar. For cen turies, the historical events were shrouded by the Catholic church's coverup of these mass excutions with the Church's stories of their extracted confessions of fictitious heresies. The stories grew wilder and wilder. Now enters the Reformation, and the Enlightenment Men in the 18th century read medieval history alert for anything that seemed to break the monot ony of the medieval Church's European Theocracy and gave signs of altern ative world- views. \"There was also a stro ng Gnostic trend in eighteenth- century thought, which tended to substitute for the idea of a general illumination cast by the pr inciples of reason over all, that of special illumination possessed only by a few. \"Men of this cast of mind no ticed the Templar story, and turned it into a paradoxical fable of hidden wisdom which had NOTES ________________ 1 Some groups of Templars surv ived, such as those in Spain."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"94 THE WATCHTOWER& THE MASONS set itself up against the reigni ng Christian orthodoxy of the Middle Ages.

And men in the 19th century with si milar thoughts—like Charles T. Russell also took notice of th em.

Today, we have at our disp osal the benefits of better historical scholarship concer ning the Crusader Knights Templar and the origin of the Masonic Knights Templar. However, during the time of C.T. Russell the campaign to portray the Knights Templars as a grand alliance of such groups as the Manichaean groups, the Cathars, the Albigensians, the Vaudois, and others had reached its peak. In 1877, The Rules was publishe d for the general public's consumption. It purpor ted to show how the original Knights Templars shared beliefs with other heretical groups in the Middle Ages. 3 In the 1890's a new anti-cleri cal and romantic right in France began incorporating the Templar myths into their new theories. Likewise, Nutt, A, The Legends of the Holy Grail (London, 1902), adva nced the view that the Templar Knights had stood up to Cath olic church for centuries, by trying to show ties between medieval romances which he asserted were modaled on the Knights Templar's principles.

Not only did they claim to be decendants, but they claimed the Knights had not only opposed the Catholic church but also obtained mystical and hidden knowledge. Many fictitious documents were created to substantiate this cl aim. This group was the Masonic Knights Templar. Historians, even Masonic ones, now concede that the Masonic Knights Templar are not directly historically linked to the ancient Crusader order. 4 However, in Russell's day this was still accepted by many people who did not have the knowledge to expose the fake doc uments that were frequently coming to light, along with th eir pseudo-scholar creators.

It is divided into three degrees: the Order of the Red Cross, the Knights of Malta, and the Knights Templar.

Did Russell ever claim to have borrowed from the Masons, or Knights Temp lars? Russell borrowed from all kinds of heresies. He wa sn't outspoken about who he borrowed from, but he did say, \"I confess my indebtedness to Adventists, as well as to other denominations.\" 7 However , it was common knowledge among those who lived with him that he borrowed heavily from others. One close follower wrote, \"His was a remarkable ability to adapt to his own uses all the knowledge of others. In pursuing this method, he was not peculiar; fo r it is the method of many of earth's brightest minds.\" \"And it is striking of these geniuses that they are humble enough to rely on their predecessors for whatever of good can thus be obtained.\" 8 Before moving to Brooklyn in 1909, Russell lived in Allegheny (now Pittsburgh),Pa.

What might have Russell le arned from the religious teachings of the Masonic Knights Templar? The Knights Templar's method was to use historical fancy in the service of a new idealistic symbolism.

People also viewed the Templars in this time period as \"a secret revolutionary group which had possessed hidden knowledge fatal to ort hodox Christianity, and which pointed forwards to the establishment of a new enlightened society.\" 16 Russell felt this exact wa y towards his own work. 1868-The Dictionnaire raisonne de l' architecture francaise du XIe au XVI siecle . was published in Paris. On p. 16 it expressed that Templar buildings were inspired by number mysticism. This ties in with other Masonic beliefs on ancient architecture, and Russell's belief that the Pyramid had number mysticism. 17 Bear in mind, the Masons were claiming that they had built the Great Pyramid and Solo man's Temple. The Templar claims must have looked attractive to Russell. He felt sympathy for those who were trying to bring a new spiritual message and for their opposition during the Middle Ages to the medieval governing class. He searched for such groups, because it added legitimacy to his own new message which was opposed to all the mainline denominations in one way or another. By accepting Masonic Knights Templar claims about being the reforming spirit behind the Reformation and th e Enlightenment, Russell could reject Protestant claims; so mething Russell desired to do. In the 1880s, Templar Saint-Yves d' Alveydre saw a chosen band of initiates hidden from view exercising their rule through bodies that repres ented the various orders of society. The spiritual counterpart of this would be Russell's idea of the 144,000 elect ruling the earth from heaven. NOTEES _______________ 16 Ibid. 17 This is not to say he borrowed from this dictionary. It is clear that Russell borrowed from Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth of Scotland. Russell acknowledged th at he had read Smyth and had borrowed his pyramid ideas. Two other Scotsmen were then inspired by Russell's work \"Thy Kingdom Come\" about the pyramid. It is still possible that the seeds to all this pyramid numeriology go back to the Freemasons, because it is so close to the type of knowledge they promoted.

They viewed themselves as knight s, and as princes. One Mason described themselves as \"princes who wished to enlighten, edify and build up the living Temples to the Most High.\" 18 Russell certainly liked castle s. He called himself and his followers princes buildi ng a spiritual temple. QUESTIONS A) Is it possible that Russell used the Knights Templar and the other crusader l ogo because he saw hims elf as a crusader? No. Russell never held a posit ive view of the Catholic Church's crusade. His opinion was, \"From our present-day standpoint and clearer perception of things, people generally style the Crusades an outbreak of foolishness, wasted effort, manifest ignorance and bigotry . But perhaps Christians today have something equally f oolish and irrati onal.\" Russell goes on to compare th e foolishness of the Crusades to the foolishness of the pre- W.W. I military buildup. 19 B) What are the differences between Templar groups? In early masonic histor y many KT groups came and went. The Commandery of the KT, which is the top degree of the York rite, called by some masons the \"Christi an rite\", is the principal group. Of th e various small Templa r fraternities the Templars of Liberty, founded in NJ in 1881, seems more in line with Russell's tastes. This society had three emphases: anti-Catholicism, benevolence, and patriotism. The society's ritual was based on incidents of the Protestant Reformation. Local units were called \"Templ es.\" Most of the society's membership resided in th e states of New York, Pennslyvannia, and New Jersey. 20 To discuss the differences of the many groups would take an en cyclopaedia.

To say its use was widespread would be an overstatement. It was used by individuals and groups, but in the context of being the KT emblem. The author knows that various Christians have used the symbol, even churches. But in each case, the Christians using it are the type that make them likely Masonic members. Two examples will suffice to make the point. A particular Baptist group in this city which built a church c. 1919, placed the KT emblem on the side of its building. What is interesting is that anyone bothered to place something on the side, rather than front. This Baptist church calls its church a \"temple.\" And its origin is far different than most Baptists. It was formed by some Scandina vian Lutheran Pietists. How did they view Freemasonry? In the early 1900s, a number of Portland Baptist Ministers beca me Masons. Baptist evangelist Ray Palmer, a Lodge member, ev en used his order as the subject of a sermon in July, 1904. Portland's First Baptist minister, W. Brougher, a member of the Masons, invited his Masonic order to church in June, 1909 and preached a sermon \"Baptists and Masons\" in which he said the two groups believed the same. An ex act quote is that they were \"one in their fundamental doctrin es.\" (The Author wonders if he considered Christ's Atonement and Salvation fundamental.) What happened next? The next day at a conference for all the area Bap tist ministers, the Temple Baptist minister participated in silencing a W. M. Wyatt, who stood up to take issue with Brougher's sermon. Clearly, the Baptist Temple didn't see anything wrong with the Masons. 21 Second example, a Christian uses the logo for his business. But an inquiry into his personal life, makes him a suspected Mason.

Then, I can examine whether it might possibly be an exception to that. The following pages contain Photo-copies of Bible Student Convention programs. During Russell's time the International Bible Students Association (IBSA) used Masonic Halls and Temples fo r their meetings.Today, Bible Student groups loyal to Russell and his teachings continue to meet in about the same kind type of places as they met in Russell's day— Masonic Halls, Y.M.C.A'.s, and public meeting halls. The frequent use by Russell's IBSA during the early 20th century of Y.M.C.A's is notew orthy. It may provide a clue as to how Russell could have been recruited by the Freemasons. Active Presbyterian John Wanamaker was the national president of the Y.M.C.A. Like C.T. Russell in Allegheny, John Wanamaker also ran a successful men's clothing store in Philadelphia. The established churches felt his Y.M.C.A.s were unneccessary competiti on He had even begun Sunday School classes at the Y.M.C.A. Wanamaker was made a Mason in Mar. 1898 and a Knights Templar in June, 1902, and a Knight of the Rose Croix (the Scottish Rite derivation of Roscicrucians) Dec, 1912. Wanamaker, who is world famous for his positive retail innovations during the 1860 to 1900 time period very likely ca ught the eye of nearby C.T. Russell. For those who have forgotten, the list of his innovations include, the attitude \"the customer is always right\", profit sharing, employ ee benefits, the department store, customer service, and guaranteed refunds for customers.

That Jewish scripture would allude to a pagan religious symbol might gi ve us pause to think about how thoroughly they were su rrounded by and mixed in with the pagan world at this time.

In 1923, Rutherford removed the Wing ed-Sun-Disk from all of Russell's books coming off the press. His masonic logos on the Watch Towers were also removed. For some the Winged-sun-disk may seem to them the strongest evidence of Masoni c connections to Russell. For instance, Albert Pike 24° , Morals and Dogma, p.401, refers to the Gods in the trinity symbol, \"These two divinities (the Sun and the Moon, Osiris and Isis, etc.) were commonly symbolized by the generative pa rts of man and woman; to which in remote ages no idea of indecency wa s attached...and which, as such appeared in the Mysteries (the ancient religions of which Masonry is a revival.\" Albert Pike, in the same Mo rals and Dogma. Fellowcraft Degree, p. 22 states, \"Mason ry, successor to the Mysteries (the pagan religions of Isis, Osiris, Baal, My thras, Tammuz, etc.) still follow s the ancient manner of teaching.\" In the book Ancient Mystic Rite s, it states that Masonry gets its mysteries from ancient Egypt (p.25) a nd that Masons worship Osiris and Ra and Isis and Horus. (p. 17) Masons are appropriately called the 'Sons of Light' states Lightfoot's Manual of the Lodge, p. 175. This sheds some light on the fascination the Egypt holds for Freemasonry. PASTOR RUSSELL FASCINATED BY EGYPT & PYRAMIDS For five years, Pastor Russell's loyal follower Bro. Bonnet looked fruitlessly for just the right granite to build a pyramid for the Watchtower Society.

It should be stressed that the term has been used by so many people that it is not just an Egyptian term. The term golden was popular for the Theosophical Society. The term the Golden Age was very popular with Russell. This study will examin e that interest.

With the completion of this elect class, all shaped and polished as the Lord's Jewels by present trials, difficul- ties, etc., etc., the time will have come for the inauguration of the work of this Royal Priesthood.

Then the Law shall go forth and the Word of the Lord; then Satan shall be bound; then every evil thing shall be plucked up by the root! What a turmoil this will mean at the beginning may be better imagined than described. But so far as the uprooting and up- turning is concerned, the Lord has a peculiar way of accomplishing this; namely, by simply allowing present institutions to \"run amuck,\" to overthrow themselves, to develop anarchy which will sweep the world as with a besom of destruction and produce a Time of Trouble such as never was since there was a nation! It will be at the conclusion of this period of awful anarchy toward which the world is now heading rapidly and from which it can- not be held back by human wisdom and prudence because selfishness has blinded the minds of the masses.

The author hasn't had access to the full range of documents that would help confirm Russell's membership in a Masonic order. Rather than presenting conclusive evidence about a membership, the author will present a series of cases that will show the reader the importance of not just giving attention to what a man writes, but also what he does. Many people incorrectly think that what the WT publishes or the Society says is absolute truth. In order to break the illusion of WT credibility, and to open the reader's mind to the possibility of Russell's duplicity with occultic Freemasonry this chapter has been written. Indeed, the cases presented in this chapter are very revealing and will be very shocking to some people. Prior to C.T. Russell's second trip in 1911 to the Great Pyramid, Russell had found hims elf in the Court of Common Pleas. He faced divorce proceedings launched by his soon-to- be ex-wife. As so often happens, both parties threw everything but the kitchen sink at each other. In court in 1906, Maria Russell brought the accusation of child molestation against Charles T. Russell. Russell admitted he'd locked himself in with Miss Ball \"to minister to the sick\" and had kissed Miss Ball, but onl y to give \"spiritual tonic.\" To set his congregation at ease, Charles T. Russell took \"A Vow Unto the Lord\" which actually consisted of 5 vows, two of which concerned his sexual conduct. He vowed he would conduct himself privately in the same manner with the opposite sex as publically and no t to lock himself in any room with the opposite sex alon e. These vows were printed in the WT 6/15/1908. As there was a question as to whether he'd been involved in the occult, he also publicly addressed that issue in his vows. He vowed, \"I vow to Thee that I will be on the alert to"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"154 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS resist everything akin to Spiritism and Occultism, and that, remembering that there are but th e two masters, I shall resist these snares in all reasonable ways, as being of the Adversary.\" This vow was repeated pub licly. \"I will be ON THE ALERT TO RESIST EVERYTHING AKIN TO SPIRITISM AND OCCULTISM\" Chapter 7 clearly shows beyond a doubt that C.T. Russell soon broke that vow. The Winged-Sun-Disk is not only akin to the occult, it is part of the occult. It was originally used in Egyptian magic. In modern times, it is still used for magic, whether by non-masonic practitioners of Egyptian magic or Masonic ones. The first three degrees are called the Blue Lodge. Why? Because the heavens (astrology) is so important to them. Astrology is important to Mas onry as it is to many groups steeped in the occult. The Zodiac Signs were formed in pagan Babylon and have all kinds of occultic significance. Yet, Russell after his vow, had no problem displaying Zodiac signs on his Photo-drama of Cr eation.(p.2) Is this steering clear of anything \"akin to Spiritism and Occultism\"? Interestingly, while breaki ng his own vow, Russell was busy pointing the finger at Christendom. He interpreted Jer. 51:7 in a sermon, \"Babylon was a gold cup in the Lord's hand; she made the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore they have now gone mad.\" Russell was claiming the \"gold cup\" was the Bible, and that heathen philosophies were joined w ith Christendom into \"a poisonous draught\" which was mixed and poured into the \"golden cup\" of truth, which had made all the nations drunk What shall Russell's additions to the \"gold cup\" of the Bible be called? Other inconsistencies of Russell are notable. When Russell established congregations, he copied Christadelphian congregational methods—such as their views on membership & baptism, of elected unpaid serving brethren, on women having congregational voting ri ghts but no part in public speech or prayer, of naming th eir congregations \"ecclesias\", of posting signs saying \"Seats fr ee, no collections taken\",etc. Christadelphians had specially chosen the unused term"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"RUSSELL-MARTIN LUTHER OR MASON? 155 \"ecclesia\" to name their congr egations in order to set themselves apart from all other Christians. Russell liked the term, and took away their ecl usive use of it for his own congregations. Russell was very critical of the Christadelphian Ecclesias. Perhaps they were too close for comfort. Naturally, it can be expected some will regard the written statements of the Watchtower Society and its leaders as final and the gospel truth. If these st atements were consistent and reliable, the author could us e that testimony to show how Russell and Rutherford condemned Freemasonry, and skip writing this book. But these men of the Watchto wer Society have vascillated and contradicted themselves in word and deed, not to mention contradicting each other. When men do not lead consiste nt lives, it is critical for any objective investigation to look at both what they were saying and what they were doing. The reader has seen how Russell failed to honor his vow. How about this great leader's followers? Let's examine first the instructions he issued to his Bible Students. Calling his people \"New Creation\", Russell advises them to withdraw from organizations such as the Freemasons. \"It is very reasonable to assume that what are called the fraternal insurance societies will fail before the regular companies, because the former are without capital, and depend upon assessments; and because these assessments will become the more onerous as the membership of the societies not only ceases to increase, but, under pressing conditions will dwindle... \"This brings before us the whole question of orders, societies, etc., and what privileges the New Creation has in connection with such organizations. Is it right for them to be members of these societies? We answer that while Church associations are purely religi ous, and labor and beneficial organizations in general are pur ely secular, there are still other orders which combine the religious and the secular features. As we understand the matter, for instance, the Free Masons, Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias, etc., perform"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"156 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS certain rites and ceremonies of a religious kind. Let it be understood that we are not waging any warfare upon those who hold membership in these various orders, even as we are not waging warfare against the various sectarian religious systems. We place upon one le vel all of those which have any religious ceremonies, teachings, etc., and consider them all as parts of Babylon, some qua rters or wards of which are cleaner, and others less clean, but all, nevertheless, full of confusion, error—contrary to the divine intention, as displayed in the organization of the primitive Church...We admonish the New Creation to have nothing whatever to do with any of these semi-religi ous societies, clubs, orders, churches; but to \"Come out from amongst them, and be ye separate, and touch not the unc lean thing.\" (2 Cor. 6:17) Their things, their worship, th eir teachings, their doctrines, are unclean to us, though th ey may not be unclean to themselves. The eyes of our understanding have been opened, and now to us all things appear in a new light, so that things which we once loved we hate, and things which we once hated now we love. \"But as concerns other orde rs...which contain nothing of a religious character...which attach signs and passwords merely as a diversion...we have nothing to say against these.\" (The New Creation, pp 580-581) Russell also suggests in his book The Battle of Armageddon, pp.44-45, that to come out of Babylon means leaving groups like the Freemasons. \"To come out of Babylon cannot mean a physical emigration from the midst of the nations of Christendom...The idea of th e command is a seperation from all the binding yokes of Christen dom—to have no part nor lot in her civil, social, or religious organizations...This implies the withdrawal from the vari ous religious organizations, whose doctrines misrepresent...the Word of God.

In that time (and, b ear in mind, it will probably be within the next few years) fi nancial institutions, including insurance companies and benefi cial societies, will go down; and \"treasures\" in them will prove utterly wo rthless...the time will come when men \"shall cast their silver into the streets, and their gold sh all be as though it were unclean...But those who ha ve made the Most High their refuge need not fear the approach of such times. He shall cover them with his feathers, and under his wings shall they trust; yea, he will show them his salvation.\" SPIRITISM Even before Russell advi sed his people to avoid entanglements with secret soci eties, he was warning them about Spiritualism. An article in the Mar. 1881 WT (which was reprinted in the Sept. 1881 WT) warned about Spiritualism. One of Russell's followers describes in a letter her struggles as a Bible Student. \"I have been having a rather strange and perhaps unwise experience lately. My husband's br other is a Spiritualist, takes the Progressive (?) Thi nker and is thoroughly imbued with its teachings, and, when I visit there, he reads articles from its teachings, and asks my opinion concerning them; especially those fr om persons claiming to have received messages from 'departed fr iends' through the aid of the mediums. Now I never have thought it 'all humbug' as many do, though there is much fraud connect ed with it—for it seems to me that the Bible plai nly teaches that spirits have had, and will have, the power to communicate with men. I have told him that I believed those communications came from fallen angels who personate d the dead for the purpose of deceiving men into believing Satan's old lie, \"Thou shalt not surely die.\"...His wife...is a firm believer in SCRIPTURE STUDIES...Some time ago he bought a Psychograph, an instrument used by mediums for communicating with spirits, but he could not use it. \"A few days ago it was placed in my hands, and, as I"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"158 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS found I was a medium, I resolved to \"try the spirits.\" About the first thing it said to me was that there is a valuable gold mine on our place: that did not surprise me, as we had been told that a \"vein\" had been traced across the place. It described the exact location to di g for it; said it is only 7 1/2 feet below the surface. So that will not be difficult to prove. Then it gave me some Script ure messages, Col. 1:4,5 and 2:4. I asked what was meant by \"enticing words\" and was answered, Bellamy, Christian Science, Spiritualism, Ingorsollism, etc. I asked who was talking, and was told Epaphras. That did not seem to please my brother-in-law very much, and he said he would like hear from some one we had known in the flesh, so I as ked if such an one were present, and was told, 'Yes, East man\" (a stranger to me, but my brother-in-law a nd his wife, who alone were present, were both acquainted with him). When asked what he wished to say he cited us to Titus 3:5, said the doctrine of THE STUDIES (Russell's books) is true, and that his wealth had hindered him from gaining the prize of the high calling. 'I,' said Eastman,' was not thought a very good Christian, though a member of the church.' \"The next day I tried the wheel, or Psychograph, again, and was told that a dear good fr iend of mine who had lived in speaking distance of me for several years was talking to me. She asked me to write to her husband and tell him that she said, a certain boy (giving name) was having a bad influence over their boy. She told me that my husband (who is in Florida) was hurt and very lame , and I got a letter from him day before yesterday confirming it. She said she regretted that she had not given SCRIPTURE STUDIES the attention that I had wished her to, that she had life on the angelic plane; she also told me of the \"mine. \" I asked did she know the one claiming to be Eastman, and sh e said yes, that it was a deceiving spirit personating him, and that I would best not make use of the means through which I could receive such communications. One claiming to be Cephas cited me to the first chapter of Daniel. Another, claiming to be my father, said in substance the same. A ll said the same about the gold \"mine,\" and all professed to believe in Christ and that SCRIPTURE STUDIES are co rrect exponents of God's"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"RUSSELL-MARTIN LUTHER OR MASON? 159 Word, and told me that I was failing to make the best use of one of my \"gifts\" --teaching; that I should teach publicly as well as individuals, but was cau tioned with I Cor. 3:7 and Eph. 4:2. \"During the little time I experime nted with the instrument I was told many things (a few of which were not true) that would take too much of your tim e to tell you; and several of the 'spirits' claimed that they would heal the sick through me, if I would only trust them. A great deal of Scripture was given, and all very appropriate to those for whom it was given; but the Devil quoted Scripture to Christ; and I still think the same as I did before \"trying the spirits\"--only I was not sure that fallen angels would admit, even for the purpose of deceiving, that Christ had \"come in the flesh\"; but it seems now they will. Probably 1 John 4:1-3 refers to doctrines of men wholly. Of course, it would be possible for those who shall have \"part in the first resurrection\" (the elect) to speak through such a device, but is it probable that they will? I will be glad to hear from you on this subject.\" 1 An important Watchtower official, who publicly confessed demon's possessed him, was Clayton J. Woodworth. C.J. Woodworm was the editor of The Golden Age, one of the Watchtower Society's periodicals now renamed Awake! He was its editor from its first issue in 1919 to the last issue under its next name Consolation in July, 1946. His confession came during one his speeches at the summer Truth convention at Ashville, N.C. He claimed he had been having a terrific battle with de mon possession. Woodworth would write the Revelation portion of The Finished Mystery in 1916- 1917 which was fraudulently passed off as the \"Posthumous\" work of Pastor Russell. In that work, he apparently alludes to his fight with demon possession. 2 NOTES _________________ 1 Johnson, Paul S.L. Spiritism—Ancient and Modern. Philadelphia, PA: pub. by Paul S.L.

Indeed, his problem began while he was translating. The translator, when he began to be aware of the presence of demons, decided to preach to them. He told them that they had a hope of salvation in the scriptures I Cor. 6:3. But now that they had made him a medium , were not inclined to listen to this, nor did they care to l eave him. Finally, after earnest prayer, they departed. 3 Modern Witnesses have their run ins with demons too, according to what they have related to the author. Let the reader focus on this problem whic h at times is almost a comic tragedy. One Watchtower circuit ov erseer told the author that demons caused marital problems until he and his wife threw out all of their old birthday and Christmas cards, which took the demons with them. What the author experienced being around JWs he would normally hesistate to portray as typical JW behavior, on the chance he experienced a fluke. However, Dr. Jerry Berman's book The Mental Health of Je hovah's Witness shows study after study confirming the things the author saw first hand. Psychological studies have indicated a widespread pattern of these following behaviors. 4 *JWs claim to be the happiest people in the world, but actually suffer high rates of depression and mental illness- rates much higher than the general population. *The Watchtower Society and its hierarchy have little understanding of Mental Heal th. Some of the advice the Author observed Witness elders giving could have come out of the Middle Ages. Indeed the Awake! Sept. 8,1976 has an article which extols the following example to its readers. \"Doctors of Sao Paulo Hospital of Psychiatry called in a former exorcist, who is now a W itness, to exorcise spirits, NOTES ______ 3 Spiritism-Ancient and Modern, p. 137 4 Bergman, Dr. Jerry R.

Any thing evil that they do tends to be rationalized \"The devil made me do it.\" They see Satan as having power to control people at will like pawns. In practice, God seems to have very little practical power compared to the power they attribute to Satan. This may seem to some at first glance like Christianity- it isn't. If I as a Christian walk into- say a pagan temple, I know the idols are nothing and that my God is st ronger than them and able to protect me. I would not run a nd hide like the Witnesses. They live their lives in fear of demons. Bergman, Jerry. The Mental Health of Jehovah's Witnesses, p.53 gives us a Jehovah's Witness' case history that illustrates the point,\" Noble (1982) notes: We were always so demon oriented that I developed a tremendous fear of them. And when I became sick, depressed, and suicid al, I would desperately search the house for an object that could be demonized. I once discarded a picture of a little girl that I had hanging in my guest room because she had \"intense\" looki ng eyes. I had my master bathroom done in an Indian decor at the time, and on the wall was a plaque of a dancing Indian. I decided he must be an Indian god of some sort, so out he went. One night I awoke, terrified, and got it into my head that all of the herbs from the health food store were drugs of some sort. I threw them all away, along with aspirin, Turns, cough syrup, and you name it. My whole medicene cabinet got tossed in the trash.\" *Witnesses blame their own problems on outsiders. Satan is one of their favorite scapegoats. They rationalize reality away. Since everyone out side of their organization belongs to Satan, Satan wants to keep them happy, and keep them where they are. The flip side is that Satan is trying to make everyone on the inside of the Watchtower Society miserable. This view contradicts the official-published view that they are the happiest people in the world, but it is a neccessary rationalization for Witnesses who can't overlook the obvious unhappiness and demonic influences pervading the organization. *Those people who can practi ce the defense mechanisms of denial, rationalization, or projection are more likely to"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"162 THE WA TCHTOWER& THE MASONS remain JWs. *Problems not understood are blamed on demons. *Lack of organizational zeal or loyalty is blamed on demons. *Mental illness and thoughts of suicide are blamed on demons. *Any book like this which di scusses demons—whether pro or con is demonized. But in contradiction to this, the Society's publications which show demonic signs, astrology signs, etc. are good. During his time with the JWs, the author's experience exposed him to a surprising amount of JW hypocricy. Nor can one simply read Russell's condemnation of the occult and Freemasonry and assume the Society is squeeky clean of such. 5 Other evidence corroborates the author's personal experiences, that in spite of many sincere people that seem to have integrity, there is corruption throughout the organization. Perhaps Organizati onal loyalty blinds the eyes of those with integrity. The inconsistencies and problems of integrity go way back. For instance, The The Ch ristian Globe, had an article placed in it by the Internati onal Bible Students Association, printed May 5, 1910 which descri bed the Pastor as \"Above all, the Pastor may be desc ribed as strictly orthodox, evidenced by his close adherence to the Bible as the inspired Word of God.\" NOTES _______________ 5 If Russell wasn't consistent with his own writings, let us bear in mind other men have been guilty of that too. Remember, Joseph Smith, Jr. also condemned Freemasonry and Secret Societies in his wr itings. His first sealed wife was the widow of Morgan, the famous man who was murdered after he exposed Masoni c secrets. Yet, in spite of what he wrote, Joseph Smith joined, and the majority of his followers joined too until they were kicked out by the Grand Lodge for changing the rituals."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"RUSSELL-MARTIN LUTHER OR MASON? 163 And did Rutherford have f un with the Bible. In 1930, Nebuchadnezzar was said to represent Satan. In 1936, he was said to represent God. In 1923, character development was declared the work of God, in 1927 it was declared the delusion of the devil. Is it surprising with all this confusion, that after printing hundreds of pages of Watchtower literature against Spiritism, the occult was encouraged at their headquarters? The worst cases of this are the statements of Rutherford and Fred Franz, the current President, about receiving messages channelled to them by angels. As the messages were false and unscriptural (such as the advice of the book Children which forbade JWs from having children; and later changed when Armageddon failed to arrive), what does that suggest? Another case eventually got whistle-blower Roy Goodrich disfellowshipped and slandered. Roy attempted to stop the use of a gadget that wa s a glorified ouija board that the Jehovah's Witnesses used to heal themselves. Rutherford got tired of his accusations of demonism and in rouse to shut him up, had him write his views for a Golden Age article. (3/5/1930) Thereupon Rutherford had an article presenting a rebuttal to Roy's article published. Then he declared the topic closed, and not to be discussed, while the Society continued its \"Ouija Board\" healing. How intimate was this \"Oija Board\" quackery? The Watchtower Society as a body had promoted this from the Society's President, its travelling representatives, its pioneers, and its periodical, dow n to the Jehovah's Witness on the street. At headquarters, Dr . Mae J. Work practiced this quackery during the 1920. During the 1940's, Matthew Arnold Howlett carried out th e therapy at headquarters. Hudgings at the \"Abrams Institute\" across from Bethel Headquarters at 24 Clark St., Brooklyn also handled the constant stream of JWs who wa nted treated by the gadget. Some called the gadget a \"Radioclast\", others \"Oscilloclast\". Roy Goodrich called it a Ouija Board.

Early in the '50s, the JWs stopped. Dr. Rollin Jones, the personal physician to Judge Rutherford, also advertised the book The Grape Cure in the Dec. 26, 1928 Golden Age, pg. 206. To quote Roy Goodrich, \"To the Bible student who knows the Bible on demonism, the book has the earma rks of demonism all over it and all through it.\" Fred Franz, current President, promoted the book back then too. Remember, God through \"his\"(?) angels had informed Rutherford that vaccinations were evil. Even today, years after the ban on vacc inations was lifted, the author knows Witnesses who refuse them for themselves and their children. The Society by destroying the authority of science and the medical profession in the eyes of the JWs, have created an atmosphere conducise to quack and demonic cures. There were other quack cures besi des the ones above. One was nicknamed the \"spook cure.\" Now the Watchtower has gone to some wild extremes to prove their points. They have often dishonestly misquoted scholars (what's to lose? how many JWs would look up, for instance, a quote from the Catholic Encyclopaedia—an encyclopaedia they aren't to have anyway--on a quote that says the Trinity is false, when they want to believe it's false anyway.) And the Watchtower So ciety has grasp at some real straws to prove their points. That sets the stage for the reader for this next case in point, their campaign to medically prove blood transfusions are dangerous. (The author will relate this a ll back to the Freemasons in due time.)

The Watchtower had previously warned that vaccinations produced hybrids, because the vaccines were made of another species' blood. The ideas are similar. In the 5/31/1939 issue of C onsolation (p.3). the Society blames the use of vaccinati ons on greed. \"The Medical Association is not content w ith one vaccination. There would be slight profit in that. Vacci nations of various kinds are recommended, and, where possible, insisted upon, in order to \"guard\" the individual against known and unknown diseases.\" The article goes on to say on p. 5 that \"the practice of vaccination is nothing more nor less than deliberate blood- poisoning.\" The Golden Age 2/4/31, p.295, states that vaccinations are an \"unnatural pollution of human blood.\" \"Of all the inventions that have been foisted upon mankind for their defilement the most subtly devilish is that of vaccination.\" Page 294 states, \"Vaccination has never saved a human life.

On a WT page called \"Insight on the News\", a story called \"Transplant problems\" says \"A peculiar factor sometimes noted is a so-called personality transplant. That is, the recepient in some cases has seemed to adopt certain personality factors of the person from whom the organ came.\"(WT 9/1/75 p.519) Another WT states,\"...medical research has indicated in a realistic way how blood tran sfusions may damage the individual's personality...The blood in any person is in reality the person himsel f...Transfusing blood, then, may amount to transfusing tainted personality traits.

Under the subtitle \"Personality Influenced\" the WT says blood from cadavers is transfused in some places. Further, it states blood transfusions ma y demoralize a person's moral nature, and taint a person's hereditary offspring for generations. They quote some Doctor Alonzo Jay Shadman as saying, \"The blood in any pers on is in reality the person himself.\" Another doctor in Brazil is quoted, \"Moral insanity, sexual perversions, repression, in feriority complexes, petty crimes—these often follow in the wake of blood transfusions.\"( WT 9/15/61, pp.563-564) The Watchtower Society calls blood transfusions \"a vague medical mystery\" (1963 Y earbook, p.69) And their Awake! 7/22/63 p. 14 claims \"doctors ad mit\" that blood transfusions are a \"fad, more mystical than scientific.\" If the"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"RUSSELL-MARTIN LUTHER OR MASON? 167 Watchtower is correct then the world's best doctors are practicing mysticism. And the So ciety's view is scientific. SO WHOSE POLICY TOWARD BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS IS MYSTICIS M--THE DOCTOR'S OR THE WATCHTOWER SOCIETY'S? The modern Masons received received thei r mystical religious aspects into their trad e guilds in th e 17th century from the Rosicrucians. 8 Without sidetracking to document that, let it just be stated that the 18t h Masonic degree, known as the Rose-Croix perpetua tes many of the Rosicrucian symbols, and that the modern Ro sicrucians were created by a Mason. Quoting from the book The Rosicrucian Cosmo- Conception or Mystic Christianity it reads, \"The blood is one of the highest products of the vital body as it is the carrier of nourishment to every part of th e body, and the direct vehicle of the Ego.\"(p.91) This is summed up \"Blood...carries the feelings and emotions.\"(p. 606) Further it states, \"The blood is the highest expression of the vital body, for it nourishes the entire physical organism. It is also, in a sense, the vehicle of the subconscious memory, and in touch with the Memory of Nature, situated in the highest division of th e Etheric Regi on.

The section \"The Bl ood The Vehicle of the Ego\" (pp. 143- 146) states \"Not until the bl ood is made by the child does it think of itself as \"I.\" \"Science has lately discovere d that haemolysis results from the innoculation of the blood of one individual NOTES _________ 8 Hall, Masonic, Hermetic...pp.CXXVIII-CXXXIX gives proof of this, and ev en refers to an Encyclopaedia Britannica article that about the genesis of Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"168 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS into the veins of another of a different species, causing the death of the lower of the tw o.

Here is the Watchtower Society, with identical beliefs to the occultic Rosicrucia ns, claiming that the Medical profession is demoni c and practicing mysticism. Who would you, as the reader , say practices mysticism? Where has all this confusion come from? If indeed Russell borrowed the idea of degrees of enlightment, keys to the scri pture, progressive light, and hidden knowledge from the Maso ns, and it appears he did, then indirectly they may have caused the major process of Watchtower thought. That statement will ta ke some explaining. Is Rutherford alone responsible for spoiling C.T. Russell's organization? Did he betray Russell? It is popular today by both JWs and non-JWs to tend to disassociate Russell from the movement today. This dilutes the \"credit\" or \"blame\" Russell receives for where the Jehovah's Witnesses are today. And indeed if you have some pet doctrine that Russell espoused that Rutherford changed, it is easy to feel that Rutherford is responsib le for the Jehovah's Witness sect. But that is not the case. Russell (using his borrowed Masonic concepts) set the stage for what happened. Russe ll's religion was based on progressive light. That the \"nig ht\" was turning to dawn was proof that a new day was comi ng. The millenial dawn, was a light that was getting progres sively brighter; and the big proof that this was a millenial dawn was that the light was getting brighter. The respons e was good. People wanted to"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"RUSSELL-MARTIN LUTHER OR MASON? 169 get progressive enlightment. However, in contrast to the Freemasons, the JWs after baptism do not have progressive secret levels to ascend. In order to provide progressive li ght to the initiates, new light must be delivered periodically . Thus the Mason's indirect contribution, the con cept of progressive li ght, was to lock the Watchtower Society into a process where they had to continue giving new light. For if new light stopped, then the proof of the new dawn and its coming millenium vanish. Does the reader not realize that Rutherford had this figured out? And if Rutherford had not given new light, do you think the Society would have remained stagnant like the Bible Students have who have re mained loyal to Russell all these years? No, as soon as Russell died, Woodworth, Freitag and others immediatel y took up the sl ack to produce new light. The first new light was on the mystery books of Ezekiel and Revelations. Ruthe rford's big challenge was to keep the flow of new light to a minimum so that his new light would be the principle new li ght. But if he had not been there, there were numerous ot hers that had realized the process—the process of new light. And just like the Masons going from degree to degree, as long as the JW feels he is getting progressive light he feels progress. (This is also the same idea behind the living prophets of the LDS and the RLDS churches, although their prophets in modern times ha ven't given much new light.) But is the new light all that it's cracked up to be? No, to a large extent it is semantics. Just as the Masons rename symbols x and y, at different degrees or levels, so too the JWs rename every so often the components of their religion and pass it off as new light. Sometimes the renaming has swung a full circle. The problem is that for so long the Chris tian focus has been on the details and not the pr ocess. It is not so important that Russell's prophecies are s hown false, or Rutherford's, or Franz's. The Millerites and the Second Adventists were wrong, but for the Adventists th ere was someone to pick up the banner and char ge on. That person was C.T. Russell. And there will always be someone to grab the fallen banner of a false prophecy and char ge on, until the process is"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"170 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS challenged, rather than the details. After Russell's death the Bible Students(4,000) kept the details, and have stagnated. The rest of the International Bible Students(17,000) stayed with Ru therford and the process, and have experienced growth. Rutherford understood the pro cess of and principles of Russell's. Russell in many ways set the stage for what happened. By de-emphasizing Christ and by emphasing hidden knowledge, he played a key role in the formation of today's Jehovah's Witnesses. For today in Russell's legacy, the key to understanding the Bible and salvation is the Society. The goal of the initiat e is to learn knowledge and take in light Consequently, the JW spends his time studying Watchtower material. Afte r studying through two book studies, which often takes two years he is deemed suitable enough for the next level, baptism. In contrast to the tragic (o r comical at times) script the Society is playing, where their ro le is to continue to provide new light, the Christians ha ve continued to emphasize a relationship to one's Creator. Intimacy with God is stressed. Therefore developing a characte r that pleases God has been given a high priority. Alt hough WT material does have material on self-improvement, the thrust is not really on personal growth, but rather on production quotas, and since the best way to do something that can be added is hours in door to door service that is where the emphais is put. In some ways, it parallels the old co mmunist system. A factory produces shoes not to please its customers, not to build a satisfactory relationship with its customer, but rather to produce a quota. For many JWs the author knows, a relationship with God is not important, they are concerned with the production quotas of th e Society. If the quota is so many smiles, or so many frowns, then that is what is strived for.

The Russell movement went on the same course other similar movements have. The church became an authority whose pronouncements are truth.

Its basis of authority has become almost a carbon copy, and its hierarchy has an exact 1 to 1 relationship with the Catholic structure- just substitute president for pope, Governing Body for College of Cardinals, etc., ri ght on down.

Russell has a very light view of sin, similar to the Mas onic view. Real Ch ristianity is set apart from other religions on the gravity of sin.

If indeed Freemasons felt as strongly about the need to rebuild the Temple as this 1861 Je wish article indicates, then perhaps Masonry could have given impetus to C.T.

Hassidic Jews are a mystical minority of Jews claiming hidden knowledge. Jacob de Haas, an hassidic Jew who visited with C.T. Russell, found similarities betw een Russell and the teachings of Hassidism. What is the Kabalah? Hebrew theology was divided into three distinct parts. The first was the law. The second was the soul of the law. And the third was the soul of the soul of the law. The law was taught to a ll the children of Israel. The Mishna, or soul of the law, wa s revealed to the Rabbins and teachers.

Only a few things are similar. The use of the Kabalah to interpret the soul of the law seems to have been supplanted by Russell with his own ideas and writings which serve an identical role.

RUTHERFORD'S ANT I-RUSSELL & ANTI- MASONIC CAMPAIGN Rutherford carried out a step by step campaign to discredit Russell. He discredited Russell's character-building emphasis in the 5/1/1926 WT. He replaced it with door to door proselytizing. He discred ited Russell's character in the 1/1/1927 WT p.7. And one month la ter, repudiated the belief that Charles T. Russell was the Faithful and Wise Servant; Rutherford said that this servant was the annointed class (WT Feb. 1927, p.51-57) Even minute mistakes of Russell's were highlighted such as a minor mistake about Soloman's Temple (Vindication. Vol.III, p. 186-187). Pro-Russell Bible Students split away and formed a number of Bible Student groups which continue to this day. The break was not a cordial parting one description says Rutherford's tactics provoked \"violent criticsm\" by International Bible Students. 14 Most of these groups continue to use the Knight's Templar l ogo. For instance, the People's Paper still uses both the logos and the Watchtower on its cover. Some Bible Students continue to believe in the Pyramid as a second Bible too. 15 NOTES _________________ 14 Braden, Charles S. These Al so Believe.

In the Golden Age 9/3/30 was an article \"How Masonry Originated?\". It concludes \"it plainly links Freemasonry with demonism.\" Again Rutherford re peats himself in the 8/5/31 Golden Age. In spite of dabbling with the occult, Rutherford's attitude during the late 1920's and early '30s is one of intolerance toward Freemasonry. Rutherford was also negative toward Zionism. ERA OF WATCHTOWER SYMPATHY TOWARD FREEMASONRY 1935-1947 By the second half of the 1930's, Rutherford had succeeded in eliminating the reverence for Russell by Jehovah's Witnesses. He now had total control of their allegiences and obedience. He directed their minds against new enemies. The Catholic church came first, but he also railed against any government of the world, and then along with that came the Protestants.

Huey Long in Louisiana created a fascist dictatorship, and had he not been assasinated, many believe he would have been elected President and taken the U.S. on the road Germany went on. During the years between W.W.I and W.W. II, the Freemasons also had been active. In the U.S., they tried to organize at Cedar Rapids, Io wa. 37 jurisdictions led by Grand Masters organi zed into a conference. This would develop into the Conference of Grand Secretaries.

Continental European Freemasonry has been different than the British and American Freemasonry in that they have taken an active role in politics. They participated in France in the revolutions of 1789,1830, 1848, and 1871, and elsewhere in Europe in revolutions in 1848 and 1917.

Still the Grand Orient Masonry may have seen an ally in the Bible Students in their common goal to abolish nationalism. 19 The fascists didn't oppose one world government, except that they wanted to be the one s in power, not the leftists. One Mason speaker at the 1922 Convent of the Grand Orient stated \"Masonry should be felt everywhere, but nowhere should its face be unveiled.\" However, Masonry was to be unveiled, because the Fascists had no intention of allowing other secret organizations to exist. Beginning with Mussolini, the Fascist governments set out to crush Freemasonry. There were also many Jewish links to the Freemasons. The author knows of at least 9 books that concern themselves with Judaism and Freemasonry. (It should be noted though that many groups can be associated with and have influenced Masonry including Gnosticism, Christianity, Occultism, and its daughter Theosophy, Islam, Satanism, and Deism. ) However, to someone like a die hard Nazi party member, that Jews would be associated with this secret organization would make it suspect. Did Rutherford try to stay neutral in this battle between the Freemasons and the Fascists? He had plenty to lose if he antagonized the Fascists. Rutherford did not attempt to stay neutral, nor did he try to mitigate the potential suffering looming ahead for the Jehovah's Witnesses.

It can be speculated some of this interaction was with Freemasons, perhaps even friendships were made. 23 During World War II, the Allies were led by Masons.

His father was an elder in Russell's day, and his mother Mrs. Eisenhower was baptized in 1897 into the Bible Students. The Bible Students used the Eisenhower home for their meetings for 20 years. During the war, Dwight D. Eisenhower's mother continued to be a Jehovah's Witness. In fact at the age of 82, sh e still considered herself a Jehovah's Witness. The Allied nations owe a lot to these Masons and this son of Jehovah's Witnesses. It is interesting that the Axis leaders who were the worst pe rsecutors in history of the Freemasons and JWs, would be defeated by such a group of Allied leaders. Rutherford did not survive the war. His successor continued sympathetic articles on the Masons. The Golden Age 6/20/1945, p. 12-13 relates the massacres of Spanish masons by Franco's fascists. The WT states, \"They hadn't done high crimes against the state. Their offense was simply and solely that they were members of the Masonic Fraternity. No other charge was brought against them.\" \"Freemasons, known the world over for its works of charity and its principles of fraternity,...\" On March 13, 1946 the WT on p. 5 tells the story of how among the first victims of Mussolini were Freemasons. Why this group catches the sympathe tic eye of the Society and others don't, the author can't quite explain. Certainly the rank and file JWs do not have memberships in Masonic Lodges. However, it can't be definitively stated for sure about the upper echel on. If the Masons and the Watchtower Society were not so secretive, it would end speculation one way or the othe r. The upper echelon of the Watchtower Society has historically gotten away with things that would shock the rank and file.

Yet, the evidence is clear that the leadership knew his open claims that his information came to him through spirit mediums.

CHRISTIAN RESPONSE TO FREEMASONRY There is a feeling by some (even by some who proclaim to be Christians) that Freemasonry should not be condemned by Christians because of its benevolent activities. Many so-called Christians participate in Freemasonry. They must answer for themselves to the Lord. Meanwhile, rather than wait to see how the Good Lord settles the issue at the Judgement, scripture can be used to indicate how the good Lord thinks. Just what is the Christian faith ? It is to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with a ll our soul, with all our mind, and with all our strength: this is the first and greatest commandment. The second is similiar, it's for me to love my neighbor as myself. (cf. Mt. 22:37-39 & Mk. 12:30,31) Naturally, the Christian faith believes that man is incapable of reaching the God he loves on his own. This is what separates Christianity from other religions. Christianity holds that sin is so terribl e that God must remove the consequences of sin for man in order for man to get to know Him. Christianity believes that God Himself saved mankind. Accepting God's love, means accepting His means of redemption. To God be the glory for every person who finds Him, for it is not we who find Him, but He who draws us to Him, and gives us the capability to know our Creator. What an awesome privilege. If the Christian is sincere in all this then he will give his"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"200 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS whole soul, and strength toward loving God. Loving one's God and Father naturally implies obedience and personal knowledge of Him. \"Do we de vote more time and energy toward knowledge about God (theology) than we spend trying to figure out our girlfriend, or English literature, or an economic problem?\" This is a question for all Christians. The Christian who loves his G od with all his heart, with all his soul, with all his mind, and with all his strength will seek God to the point that he has some definite answers, convictions and an unde rstanding of what is expected of him. Freemasonry, in contrast to this, has believed in a universal brotherhood of all religious thought The Masons have pointed to their rapport with Christianity as proof that Ma sonry has promot ed and has not inhibited Christianity. One Masoni c reference states, \"It is no part of the functions or purpo se of the Masonic organization to provide spiritual ministra tions in the way of public worship, and thus usurp the pl ace of the Christian church.\" 1 Anyone attending a Masonic funeral has seen how a Mason who has never pr ofessed any Christia n in his life can be said to be in glory. Robe rt A Kessinger, of the Boise, ld. Commandery No.2 writes his vi ew in the Knights Templar. 1988,p.l0, \"Masonry is omni potent and omnipresent.

And she patiently awaits all seekers of light-ev en though they are apparently few in number at the presen t time. When good men desire her, she will rejoic ingly raise them up one by one, to the celestial heavens.\" Yet in spite of this and other disclaimers, many of the most respected Freemasons have declared it is a religion. Lynn Dumenil, describes Freem asonry in Freemasonry and American Culture 1880-1930 . On p. 54 she reports, \"Masonry's dedication to uni versality, toleration, and morality was in keeping with the tendencies of liberal Protestantism, which placed less emphasis on creed and NOTES ____________ 1 Trestleboard 10 (Jan. 1896): p. 39-40 reprinted from the Repository."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"___________ A CHRISTIAN ANALYSIS ________ 201 denominations, and which tende d to stress ethics and morality as crucial elements in religion. Liberal Protestants, eager to stem the tide of skep ticism and atheism, could well tolerate Masonry a nd welcome its efforts at encouraging morality and religiosity.\" Masonry makes equal all religious teachings, thereby devaluing the exclusive truths that Christianity presents mankind. \"...despite Masonic unive rsalist's attempts to deny that Masonry was an alternative to the c hurches, one group of Masons clearly contradicted them...these men were indicating that Masonry could se rve as a vehicle for religious expression outside the churches.\" Further, those that chose the path of Freemasonry's Universalism were, according to Dumenil's Ph.d. research, men that did not seek Theol ogical answers whole-souled. She writes, \"It seems, however, that Masonry's religion was particularly appropriate for th ose men with rather vaguely defined beliefs. For men unsettled by controversies surrounding the Bible and the validity of Christianity, Masonry provided a religious experience that was comfortable, not distur bing....Masonry could thus have special appeal to men who persisted in believing, but who were un certain about what they believed.\" Because Freemasonry promotes a lazy mental attitude toward seeking God and know ledge of Him (Christian theology), but promotes indefin ite confusing answers it is in disobedience to the first commandment. Freemasonry from a Christian analysis has promoted a \"freedom of religion\" that amounts to a \" freedom from the true religion.\" Men of fait h do not doubt that there is a definite source of truth c oncerning God. Men of faith recognize scripture as the Word of God. Men of faith realize theology is important, and th at a vague intuition about who God is, is not satisfactory. Men of faith seek wisdom with all their heart. Men of faith reject the notion that all the contradictory religious views ar e all right. Such a confusion of beliefs is unscriptural and unchristian.

I Jn. 4:1 also warns the Christian to \"try the spirits.\" And wh at does the Holy Spirit tell Christians in th e Good Book which he co- authored? He says that He the Holy Spirit will teach us all things. (Jn. 14:25,26) and furthe r that He will guide us into all truth (Jn.16: 13,14). You do not need to pay money and progress through oaths(obligations ) and rituals to get truth. The Holy Spirit will guide you. There may be Christians with in Masonic lodges, but the lodges didn't make them Christian, God made them Christians. Further, by uniting themselves with \"brothers\" who are not Christian br others they risk th eir fellowship with the Lord, for He has warned us not to be bo nded together with unbelievers,\"Be ye not un equally yoked together with unbelievers?\" (II Cor. 6:14 cf 6:15-18) Psalm 1:1 \"Blessed is the man what walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinne rs, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.\" When one become s aware of all the oaths, the scornful anti-Christian Masons , the unconverted Masons, the rituals etc. that are part of Masonry, he becomes aware just how well suited this verse is.

The scriptures condemn fortif ying one's word with oaths (Mt.5:33-37; 23:16-22; Jas. 5:12, Ex. 20:7 and others).

Contrary to Russell's view, G od's communion of believers is not patterned after oath- bound secret societies, which promise salvation to all regardless of whether they become believers in Christ or not The Christian congregation which follows the ethic of the New Testament cannot tolerate lodge memberships on the part of their members. CHRISTIAN RESPONSE TO THIS BOOK'S INFORMATION Again as the Christian has problems with Masonry, he has problems with Russell's mystical hidden progressive light in God's secret order. Jesus spoke of a different kind of light for his disciples. \"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do men light a lamp, and put it under the peck-measure, but on the lampstand; and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.\" Again, Christians have problems with Rutherford's fallen"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"204 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS angels bringing him messages.

So-what attitude does the Christian take with this information? Is he to persecute the JWs and Freemasons? In times past, some Christians have done that. Likewise, Jehovah's Witnesses have mocked and slandered Christianity. The JWs have trie d various tactics at various stages in their history such as entering churches during services, handing out th eir literature outside of church doors, and their present day modus operandi of house to house calls. The Jehovah's Witnesses have certainly offended many people. Their personal light w ould improve if they could resolve their unhealthy bitterness toward Christianity, and if they could develop a loving attitude toward Christians. Likewise, Christianity doesn't have a clear conscience either. Christians should discard items that hinder our witness for Christ, and hinder us in the spiritual race before us, such as Santa Claus. Chri stians must face honestly how we, as Peter did long ago, have in our own ways at times denied Christ. But when we hear the roosters, we must cry, and submit ourselves. That must happen before we concern NOTES 3 Why do the Christians say angels can't be redeemed? Heb.2:11-17 shows that Christ saves those who are His brothers (2:11). Even though th e angels are called \"sons of God\" and Christ is the Son of God, they are not brothers. In order to save his brothers, Christ had to take on their nature of \"flesh and blood.\" (vs. 14) Obviously, this is not speaking about angels. God's election of angels was done by perserverance, not redemption. The good angels are the \"elect\" and remain fixed in holiness, after passing the test to remain loyal to God. On the other hand, bad angels are unredeemable. Their destiny of destruction is mapped out for them.

Indeed, most JWs will view this book as another book in a tall stack which is out to pers ecute them. However, they do not meet the spiritual criteria to suffer for God. Yes, Daniel opposed Babylon and suffered, and opposing Babyon the Great will mean sufferi ng. However, Daniel first took several steps to make sure he was really suffering for God, and not for his own sins. When Christia ns call attention to the false prophecies of the Watchtower organization (whether they call themselves an inspired or \"uni nspired\" prophet is irrelevant when they have acted as a prophet of God), then the JWs must stop deceiving themselves and realize they are \"under attack\" for the WTB&TS sins against God. Likewise, Christians may try sharing this information and consider that the nasty response and rejection by the Witnesses is suffering for God. Whether Christian or Jehovah's witness, unless we approach this whole issue in a Christlike manner, even if we have the truth, we are not ready to suffer for Yahweh (Jehovah). Do we have the proper attit udes? Daniel in Dan. 1:8-16, 9:20 shows his preparation in a ttitude, before he was ready to suffer. A condemning spirit is the base of self-righteousness; an ungrateful spirit toward the pos itive results of charitable organizations, the medical profession, and the benefits of science is the base of pride; and a bitter spirit toward others is the base of selfishness.(cf. 1 Ptr. 3:15,16;Acts 24:16, Gal.6:4) So can we correct our offending attitudes toward others, acknowledge our mistakes and make peace with our enemies?

Greater than history, are the values history teaches. This book has not been heavy on values, until this chapter. Now, the value of the book from a Christian standpoint is reviewed. Christians have sought the elusive \"key\" to open Jehovah's Witnesses minds to see the real nature of the Watchtower Society. Sometimes JWs, as with some Masons, have their blinders or rose-colored glasses removed when they reach the higher levels and are disappoint ed. They find that as truth loving individuals they must leave. The lower levels however are not aware of so much. Just as in the lower degrees of Masonry many are uninformed, so also many JWs are not aware of such things as how the Society functions as a big profit-making bookseller, for which they provide themselves as unpaid salespeople. ARE JWs GOD'S ONLY PEOPLE? Many uninformed people are suckered into accepting the bogus Watchtower pronouncement that God came in 1918 and of all the churches and people in the world only the Jehovah's Witnesses-then called International Bible Students- were doing His will and were teachable. They teach that since 1914 millions of people have be en practicing true religion along with the 'faithful and discreet slave class.\" 4 First, this book clearly shows that there is an array of information exposing the Masonic influence and other corrutions and bankruptcies in their beliefs back in 1918. This investigation casts seriou s questions on how clean and pure the Bible Students were of occultic influences in Russell's day.

And on page 298 of the same article (without mentioning that the Watchtower Society itself believed the Great Pyramid was God's second Bible)- states, \"R ather is it not an insult to God to hold that he felt it necessary to corroborate his inspired Word by some mute edifice?

Next some qustions will be answered. Then an analysis of what this information means. POINTS First, it is clear that Russ ell knew detailed information about the Masons. Second, Russell's background was conducise to Masonic membership, and placed him in an excellent position to learn about the Masons. Third, in spite of his own warnings that Freemasonry promotes \"profane worship\", and in spite of his detailed knowledge of Masonry, Russell picks for his organization Masonic logos, symbols, and names. Fourth, an overview of hi s writings and speeches show an almost continual repetition of Masonic teachings, Masonic buzzwords, and toleranc e toward Freemasonry. Fifth, Russell elevates his teachings above everyone else including the Freemasons . It was no accident when he printed two ex-Mason Bible Students' le tters which praised his anti- Masonic stance. It was his way of building up his reputation. He is the only one with tr ue brotherhood, and only his followers have true love. No or ganization is exempt from his criticism. His self-elevation a nd demeaning of most everyone else, should not be mi staken or confused as being a rejection of Masonic ideas and principles . Sure, Russell has dispensed with the boyish pranks of hand shakes and passwords. Still, he sees the Masonic order as a pattern of the \"fellowship of mystery\", God's secret order, better known as the church. Sixth, Russell's beliefs dovetail with the Masons. Seventh, Russell's th irst to examine all the heresies in his personal studies, especially the likes of the Kn ights Templar, make it difficult to imagine that Russell didn't study the Knights Templar."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"212 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS QUESTIONS 1. Not all Scot-Presbyterians were Masons, and the words \"Jehovah\" and \"light \" are not the exclus ive reserve of the Masons, isn't the case overblo wn? Although these words are used by others, they are us ed excessively by Russell. The Knights Templar logo hasn't been used by everyone. Those who have seen it before need to prove that whoe ver is using it is definitely not a Fr eemason or close to one . It must be borne in mind, that Russell had un limited choices of logos and symbols, and an unlim ited supply had he so desired of logos that were completely untainted of Freemasonr y. Why would an informed leader surrounde d by \"enemies\" pick such tainted symbols? 2. Did Russell have time to be a Mason? According to Ron Sutherland, an ex-32° mason, a mason is free to devote as much or little of his time to th e order as he chooses. Russell could have kept his busy schedule and still been a member. 1 3. From the quotes and descriptio ns of Russell's beliefs it sounds as if he borrowed from several different types of Freemasonry. Doesn't that show th at this is all coincidence, rather than him ha ving a membership in one place and deriving one particular type of Masonry? There are indeed several schools of Freemasonry thought. Each of these four schools has its own symbols a nd ceremonies, and approach toward Masonry. However, it is clear that modern Masonic writers have often been infl uenced by and borrowed from more than one school. 2 NOTES ________________ 1 Interview with Ron Sutherland by author 2 Ancient Mvstic Rites, p.2"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"A FINAL LOOK 213 A close examination of Masoni c leaders show that many of the York Rite have also b ecome 33° Scottish Rite (occult) members and Shriners too (t he Moslem oriented group). 4. What significance is there if C.T. Russell borrowed from the Masons? In the book What Has Religion Done for Mankind? the Watchtower Society spells out its policy which is still rigorously adherred to, that is, that there will be no compromise with the world and false religion. In reference to Jehovah's strict instructions to the Israelites to stay separate a nd clean of the pagan peoples of Palestine, they write, p.155, \"But was this not the rankest ki nd of religious intolerance as well as genocide?...Not at all! This was the divine command and it was in favor of keeping the pure religion alive in the form God gave. The pure and the false could not exist side by side without hurt to his people and danger to their opportunity for eternal life in the new world.\" Page 323 begins a chapter \"Pure Religion Alone Survives the World's End.\" The Society has repeatedly gone on record condemning Freemasonry as Satanic. Either Freemasonry is or it is not Satanic. That is, either Satan and the demons have played a role in Masonry or they haven't. If the present-day Society is correct that Freemasonry is satanic, then how do they reconcile that with the fact that their founder borrowed from it. How could God's pure spirit have existed side by side with C.T.Russell's and Rutherford's tainted organizations? How does one reconcile this book's information with the Watchtower's statements on p. 308 of What Has Religion Done for Mankind? \"Under the guidance of God's spirit of freedom the magazine today known as The Watchtower but known back there as Zion's Watch Tower, began to be published in July, 1879...The better to organize, serv e and activate this work of liberating God's devoted people by the power of the truth, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society was incorporated in Pennslyvannia, United States of America, in 1884.

The Watchtower states Freemasonry is satanic. The Watchtower was contamin ated with ideas from the occult and Freemasonry in its first years. The Society's claim is that they are the only righteous ones on the earth. The New Heavens and a New Earth, p.328, \"on earth today the New Wo rld Society is the only group that is doing a true cons tructive work...all others...at the battle of Armageddon God will destroy...\" They downplay that now. Rutherford's claims that crosses, wind chimes, holiday cards, church steeples, national flags etc., are demonic, make it hard to accept both his organization and Russell's could be God's chosen people. The two time periods seem mutually exclusive. Now this book presen ts evidence that devastates both times periods even more. The tons of nice sounding literature produced can not erase history. And if that history includes the Freemasons, then the organization needs to re-examine their claims. 5. Doesn't this book present an unbalanced view of the Jehovah' Witnesses? This is a good question to answer, because it will be asked. The point will be made that the JWs actually take people out of the occult and convert them. In response to that claim, I submit a parallel. Is a person saved from Nationalism, if say, he gives up his strong nationalistic feelings for Germ any, moves to the U.S., and then develops strong nationalistic feelings for the U.S.? Is German nationalism \"nationalism \", but American nationalism something else? No, that w ould be a double standard. Likewise, to save someone in the occult, by introducing him to a religion that received its doctrines during the 20's thru 40's from fallen angels, and whic h boasts that it adherants are slaves, is like trading German for American nationalism. The appearance may deceive some people, but the bondage is still there."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"A FINAL LOOK ______________________________ 215 6.

Joseph L., his father, contributed letters to the WT on three occasions, May 1888 (p.2), Mar. 1889 ( p.8), and June 11, 1889. He was very supportive of everything Charles was doing. He wrote, \"The most regret I have and the onl y thing which makes me feel dissatisfied with myself is th at I cannot do more than I am doing for the cause of truth.\" By truth he meant his son's views. His sister and her two daughters played active roles in the movement, and were constant headquarter workers. The roles that these people played in Russell's life should be looked into in even greater de tail. One part they played in Russell's life was that they were part of his original Bible study group. The role that orig inal Bible study group played on Russell's beliefs has also b een neglected. It is possible that the philosophy that th ere was permission of evil originated out of that Bible study group. Together they lead each other on in the direction that they and Russell went.

Surely there is a church somewhere that understands the gospel completely? Surely there is church that is God's church.\" At this the man repeated his oft asked question, \"Would the Lord want me in such a c hurch that believes wrong things and has all these faults?\" \"Yes, he does,\" said the woman. \"For Christ is your example to follow. Can you imag ine Him leaving the church the minute there was trouble in it? I'm afraid if it were so, he would not have anywhere to fellowship regularly.

You're saying you're only wanting a church with the right doctrines, but you know people are imperfect How do you separate a man's doctrinal stance from his morality? The scriptures rela te the two, and you've likely noticed how people's theology can be the result of their morality. As I was saying, Christ's disciples were far from being perfect. But Christ never thought of leaving them.\" \"Did you ever think of Christ as a pastor, and what happened in His congregation? Why, one of the first things was a split.

If Christ was here with you, I believe he might say something like the following teaching on the Holy Spirit,(and ex cept where He speaks in parable these stories are true), Listen, now I speak to you a parable. There was a man driving to the mountain Mt. St. Helens. He picked up a hitchhiker. S oon afterwards, he allowed the"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"APPENDIX C 227 hitchhiker to drive. However, the hitchhiker began driving in a direction that the man had not planned, so he took back the steering wheel again. About this time, the man heard on his radio the news about Mt. St. Helens eruption. Now the hitchhiker was the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit comes like a mysterious strange r, and he comes to call the lost driver. Woe to those who are confident in their own driving abilities, for they shall be lost. Blessed are those who are filled with the Holy Spir it, for trully I tell you, being filled with the Holy Spirit means to to let the Spirit of God control your life. The car in the parable is a man's earthly journey. Listen, a car serves not two, but only one steering wheel. Do not think you and the Holy Spirit can both drive your car together. A car goes bu t one direction at a time. Many will say they have prophe sied in my name, but the Holy Spirit never controlled their lives, and I knew them not. For some others will say, we have no need of this Holy Spirit, our lives are fine, let us be. Go make disciples of the weak, blind, sick, and heavy laden, but let us be. It is written, pride goes before the fall. Are you trully that sure of yourself? Have you not yourself noticed how wise and intelligent the universe's creator must be. For you study the fine-tunes heavens, and you study the de tails of the many complex designs in nature, and you ma rvel. You say God is wise, and that this all-wise God know s what is best in our lives. And have you also not noticed the almighty power of the universe's creator, does he not have the power to accomplish what is best for you. And again I ask, do you not feel his strong love, how he gave you life and salvation, a love for you surpassing anyone else's. Then do not marvel, if I tell you that the logical thing for man is to surrender his life to the Spirit. Whoever does the will of the Spirit of God is my brother and sister, and yours too. Ha ve you understood all these things? then go and do likewise. Now there was a certain f undamentalist minister, who didn't believe that the gifts of the Holy Spirit are given today."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"228 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS ___ He was sure the gifts of the Holy Spirit were only for the first generation and only apostoli c in nature. He put together a sermon on the matter. And it was the best sermon of his life. He preached with enthusiasm and the people were excited. The next week during his quiet hour, the Spirit of God came upon him and he prayed in an unknown tongue. So the following Sunday, his conscience caused him to deeply apologize for his good sermon to his church. Some were unable to bear this, and left his church. Truly, I say to you, be slow to judge those who do strange things by the Spirit. Remember, that no one who works a miracle in the name of Christ can soon afterward speak evil of Christ. Do not presume to know the power of God. Forget all things, and leave them behind, and run the race the Holy Spirit leads you in. For I tell you, you conscience is a good thing, but it must be trained. What man would pay attention to his watch if it weren't set correctly? So set you r consciences to the correct standard. The spirit of God has spoken through the Word of God. Blessed is the man who l oves the Word of God, for it will be a path to his feet. The word was co-authored by the Holy Spirit. If you would unders tand the Spirit better, read his book. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for the Holy Spirit, for they shall be filled. As it is written, 'As the deer pants for water, so my soul pants for thee, O God the Holy Spirit. My soul thir sts for the living God. Have you not read in Dr. Luke's account how the Holy Spirit fell on men reading and hearing the Word of God? Woe to you who set all kinds of conditions for how to get the Spirit of God. The wind bl ows where it wants, and you can't even explain where it's been. Listen, there was a certain w eathy man who walked into a jail one day. Out of his love for the abused prisoners, he told them he would post bail on all of them, and that then they would be free to live and work with him. They would not have to face their charges, he could take care of that. He posted bail for all the prisoners, but some refused the gift and"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"APPENDIX C 229 remained instead in jail. Now the Spirit is a gift like this bail, but it is only good if you accept it. And it must be accepted on faith, step by step. Again, the Spirit of God is like a boy on a camping trip at night. He was trying to fetch wood from the cabin, but he couldn't see but one foot in front of him. But having faith in his father's encouragement to only step as far as he could see, a step at a time, he proceeded to bring back the wood from the woodpile. Do not grieve the Holy Spir it. As the prophet Ezekiel wrote, \"He put his Spirit in us to cause us to walk in his statutes.\" The Law is the Law of the Spirit and it is not written in ink on paper, but has been faxed by the Spirit into your heart. Now the wise man Soloman said, \"As a man thinketh, so is he.\" As he thinks—but then how many of us think? How many of us lead no-existent live s? Paul wrote by the Spirit's direction, \"To be carnally minded is death, to be spiritually minded is life and peace.\" Repent of your carnal mind, confess your sin, and this will re-open the door to the Holy Spirit to create a temple of your body. There was a certain Norwegian explorer who was trying to reach the North Pole. Afte r many difficult months of being away from the people he'd left behind, he wrote a little message and attached it to his carrier pigeon. When the carrier pigeon was released, it circled 3 times and then headed south. It flew 1,000 miles over the artic ice, and 1,000 miles over the ocean and finally arrive d at the explorer's home in Norway. The explorer's wife knew her husband was safe. And so it is with the heaven ly Dove, who has been sent from heaven, to comfort you. The heavenly Dove bears witness of a number of thi ngs, first that Christ lives. We would not question that the pigeon was thoroughly familiar with the home it went to—why should we question whether the heavenly Spirit knows His homes intimately also? Truly, I speak to you. The heavenly Dove knows you very well, even before it brought you Christ's message. Again, I tell you there was a photo in a newspaper showing a man lifting a piano, but the crane and cable doing the lifting were not visible. Likewise, the Holy Spirit is"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"230 THE WA TCHTOWER& THE MASONS lifting your spirits, but is not visible. How many of you when seeing someone drunk, or on speed, euphoric with dope, wired on some stimulants, or deadened from a tranquillizer would not imme diately recognize the power controlling these people. Why then should we have difficulty seeing the Holy Spirit when we see mighty works, or tranquil peace, or speak ing in tongues a if drunk. Have you not heard how the Ho ly Spirit helped Gideon blow his trumpet, and Samson kill a lion, and Saul become a new man? Have you not read where the scriptures say, \"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me, Because the Lord has annointed Me To preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives, And the opening of the prison to those who are bound, To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn... There was a certain German so ldier in the Second World War who was home wounded. His mother was very concerned about him, and kept after him until he agreed to go for medical attention at a nearby military hospital. When he entered the hospital, a sign pointed down one hall for enlisted men, and another for officers. He took the enlisted men's hall. At the end of that hall, was another sign, this time pointing one way for \"seriously wounded\" and down another corridor for the \"slightly wounded\". He took the slightly wounded route. At the end of that hall was another division. The sign indicated one way for party members, and another way for non-party individuals . He took the \"non-party\" direction which came to a door. He open the door and stepped through it, and found himself outside of the hospital. Now when he returned home inquired how it went. \"Did they do any good at the hospital?\" \"You wouldn't believe how we ll-organized they were, but I wasn't able to do much good there. When the Holy Spirit walks through the halls of your mind and your life, and the doctines of your church, and your church itself—will he come back saying, \"You wouldn't believe how well organized they were, but I wasn't able to do"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"APPENDIX C _______________________________ 231 much good.\" Do you know that the Holy Spirit departed King Saul yet returned to him while he was still evil, causing him to prophecy? Do you not know how the script ures say that after King David had the Holy Spirit, he kept the Spirit even when in adultery, and that his prayer after realizing he'd sinned, was not \"Holy Spirit return\", but Holy Spirit don't leave me\"? Do you really think you can box in the truth about the Holy Spirit? Do you yourselves not say the ways of God are higher than ourselves, that G od is awesome and difficult to describe. Woe to those who think they can box in God the Holy Spirit, and the power of God the Holy Spirit Have you not read that the Holy Spirit \"came upon\" Balaam, an unconverted man, who had no lasting or voluntary relationship with th e Spirit, and yet you try to define Biblical men's relationships with the Holy Spirit by what preposition is used in your particular English Bible translation, whether it be \"i n\",\"with\",\"among\",\"upon\", or others. Truly, I say to you, if you knew the scriptures, you would not follow such baseless theories. Who do you say the Holy Spirit is? Blessed is he, who worships the Spirit. For in times past, they annoi nted with oil, but now you are annointed with the Spirit. In times past, man was created, but now you are creat ed a new creature—a spiritual man. The oil you put in your ca r is vital to many of the car's functions. It reduces friction, transfers heat so the engine doesn't melt and other functions. The oil of the Old Covenant is now replaced by the new oil of the Holy Spirit, who runs the body. It is rare for a mechanic to save the can after he uses its oil. Likewise, you should value the Spirit more than your earthen-ware body. You are a jar— a container for whatever spirit you contain. The Jews looked for a beautif ul unbreakable container, one that was child and cross prove. Blessed are those who do not reject the Holy Spirit. No power to lift man up has come to man except that power which has come down from heaven. This is what separates the true gift of faith from all religions."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"232 THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS There is no greater gift than the gift of faith which the Spirit can give a man. The Scriptures testify how Abraham's promises of faith were linked to the promise of the Holy Spirit. Blessed is the man who carri es the treasure of faith, which is the Spirit of Faith in his earthen vessel. If God would raise up stones to testify of Him, do you not think he can use the Holy Sp irit? Which is harder to raise for a testimony, a stone or a book? You have heard it said that the scriptures are inspired of God, but I say to you, that great men, and spiritual gift s, and good books, and hymns of praise are also inspired. Judge not, that you be not judged. The measure of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Fait h, the oil of gladness you give, will be the measure you get. But do not give the Holy Spirit to the dogs. Apart from the Holy Spirit you can do nothing. Christ and the Spirit are one , and those who would meet Christ, must meet the Spirit. If anyone does not have the Spirit, he does not belo ng to Christ (Rm.8). A certain wealthy man visited an old man in a shack. He inquired how much the man want ed for his property. The old man, not realizing what would happen, said $100,000. The rich man wrote him a check for this amount, and left for his home. After some time, the old man felt guilty. When he looked at the old shack, he knew it wasn't worth $100,000, so he began patching it up. When the rich man returned, the old man prouldly showed his patched & painted shack, but the rich man, was unimpressed because he wanted to bulldoze the shack and build a nice big new mansion. So it is with the Spirit of God. He visits old shacks, but he wants to bulldoze them and build new. He doesn't care for a patched up old sinner. He wants to create a spiritual life. For life, there needs to be a birth. Blessed are they who like King David gave their bodies to become temples of the Holy Spirit."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"EXODUS 20:7 .......................... 202 DEUTERONOMY 18:9-12 ..................... 206 I SAMUEL 15:23 ........................ 207 II KINGS 9 ................................. 17 JUDGES 3:29 .......................... 193 JOB 38:4-7 ......................... 51 PSALMS 1:1............................. 201 25:14 ........................ 137 92:7 .......................... 193 118:22 ........................ 51 119:97-104............... 148 PROVERBS 3:7,8 ......................... 204 21:1 .......................... 204 16:7 .......................... 204 ECCLESIATES 3:1...................... preface ISAIAH 28:16 ......................... 51 28:17 ........................ 147 40-46 ........................ 125 45:23 ........................ 147 55:9 .......................... 137 JEREMIAH 3:20 .............................51 23:6 .......................... 125 33:16 ........................ 125 51:7 .......................... 154 DANIEL 1:8-16 ....................... 204 9:20 .......................... 204 12:10 ........................ 136 MICAH 4:2............................ 147 HABAKKUK 2:14.......................... 147 MALACHI 3:13-4:3.................... 125 4:2.....................125-126 MATTHEW 5:33-37 ......................202 7:6 .............................138 7:14...........................141 11:25,26 .................... 144 21:42..........................51 22:37-39 ...................198 23:16-22 ...................202 25:4...........................203 26:28...........................56 MARK 12:30,31 ................... 198 LUKE 8:10 ........................... 145 11:2 .......................... 145 JOHN 1:11,12......................140 10:29........................ 142 13:35...........................30 14:25,26.................... 201 16:13,14.................... 201 18:20......................... 201 ACTS 14:15........................ 204 24:16........................ 204 ROMANS 8:9............................ 143 8:38,39..................... 142 I CORINTHIANS 2:10.......................... 137 2:14 .......................... 137 SCRIPTURE REFERENCE INDEX"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"3:7................................ 159 4:10.............................. 140 15:25,26....................... 147 15:28............................ 147 II CORINTHIANS 6:14.............................. 201 6:15-18 ........................ 201 6:17.............................. 156 GALATIANS 3:29.............................. 141 6:4................................ 204 6:10.............................. 143 EPHESIANS 4:2................................159 5:11,12 ..................... 201 COLOSSIANS 1:4,5 ......................... 158 2:4 ............................ 158 2:8................................172 I THESSALONIANS 5:21..............................201 I TIMOTHY 2:6................................136 TITUS 2:12-15 ....................... 50 3:5................................158 HEBREWS 2:11-17 ........................203 6:1............................. 137 9:22................................ 56 12:23................... 139,146 JAMES 2:5................................145 5:12..............................202 I & II PETER 1...................................

What were the original sources of the Watchtower Movement? What were the sources of the many strange and seemingly unique doctrines of Charles Taze Russell, the founder of the Watchtower movement? Researchers in the past have chosen to rely primarly on historical sources provided by Russell himself in an attempt to answer that question. Fritz Springmeier has taken a different path in this new book. Rather than attempting to rehash old, worn out material, Mr. Springmeier, with bulldog like tenacity, has uncovered astonishing new evidence that links C.T. Russell with Freemasonry and the Occult! This book will raise many new questions on Russell's doctrines. -David Waltz, 4th generation Jehovah's Witness Fritz Springmeier is a Witness, lnc. missionary to Jehovah's Witnesses. He has attended West Point, U.S.M.A., Rosedale Bible Institute, and Clackamas Community College . He has written a small 7- volume series on Christian doctrine, a comic book \"Adventures of 2 JWs\", and a book \"Refutation...\" which refutes the JW belief that the Archangel Michael is Christ. He has also written on non-religious subjects. Fritz has travelled extensively world- wide, and lived in Europe, Africa, and Asia. He lives in Portland with his wife, Gayle, and son Michael, and another child on the way."}]
