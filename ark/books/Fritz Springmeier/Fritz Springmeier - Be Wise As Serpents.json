That book co nnected the Jehovah's Witnesses' Watchtower Society with the Masons. Some of the ch apters for Be Wise As Se rpents were originally written for The Watchtower & th e Masons, but were not used. It was obvious as I wrote The Watchtower & the Mas ons that I could not go into depth in the book, and that the book would have to be followed up with an indepth work. For that reason its cover called it a \"Preliminary Investigation.\" In 1990, I began look ing for a publisher of Be Wise As Serpents becau se such a work deserved to be published properly by a well-known pu blisher. The months past by on the calender, and the time clock continued ticking away on the New World Order's ag enda as I looked for a publisher. Because no person can have a total monopoly on the facts of a subject, I welcomed the help of others. I looked out for anyone who would team up with me, or appreciate my research. They would even be welcome by me to publish my research themselves under their own na me. I didn't find any takers. At this point it looks like I'm left to share this message that the Lord ha s given me by myself without the help of a co-author or publisher. By the summertime of 1991 a publisher had been foun d. But the Lord laid it on my heart in December, 1991 that I would have to self-publish. There is still research to be done . For instance, an ex-member of the Satanic Illuminati hierarchy revealed that the Russell family is one of the top 13 Satani c families that have generation after generation passed down their Satanic power. It would be nice to have the time to finish the genealogy work I began on Charles T. Russell's family to see how they fit in with the other Russells. So why publish an unfinished book? This information is very time ly. 1992 is a major year for the Satanists to kick off a series of crises to bring the world under the Satan's rule. I can not presume upon the future that there will be an opportunity to put out books like this. Marsha ll law under an emergency decree could come any time during the next few years. If I could fight one thing with this book it would be fear. If we know what we are up against and are going to experience, I believe it will take away some of the fear of the unknown. The more we seek the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and the more we love and obey God th e less we fear. Christ warned, \"Ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled.\" (Mt 24:6.) Christ also said, \"Take no thought for your life...\" (Mt 6:25), which is rephrased by the Holy Spirit , \"Be anxious for nothing.\"   Phil   4:6.   The Christian will \"commit thy way unto th e Lord and trust also in Him.\" (Ps 37:5) We are unable to see how God w ill win a victory in all this. We know that it will be some kind of miraculous display of his power and glory. But we re joice with the Lord always , and realize that today is the day that the Lord has made, we will take each day at a time, and rejoice in it This book is a call for people to face reality as it is today. I believe th at if we are unable to face what the real situation is due to our fears, then the New Worl d Order's many tent icles will continue to wr eck havoc with our lives, it will continue to sap our resources for its causes and diversions, and it will c ontinue to deceive us. May God give you hope and a spirit of courage that only God can give as you read this."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO ALL THE MEN & WOMEN WH O HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN OPPOSITION TO THE 1-WORLD-CONSPIRACY (THIS DEDICATION & LIST WILL MAKE MORE SENSE AFTER YOU READ THE BOOK AND ITS DOCUMENTATION.

If you don' t have the patience fo r some introductory pages of explanations and can't wait for the evid ence, then turn to wh ere the scouting report begins. I have entitled the book \"Be wise as serpents, and as harmless as doves.\" This allusion to the story of the serpent remi nds us that the crafty serpent was a threat because Eve was naive. Wisdom is founded upon correct and significant knowledge. The serpent was wise, because he knew the issues at stake. Evil was out of Eve's frame of reference. She didn 't know sh e was being seduced. She thought she was getting an apple. She and Adam didn't know enough to fe el a need to recognize issu es. Something as simple as biting an apple meant the di fference betwee n adherence to goodness and its counterpart rebellion. The time for being naive ended with Eve. She got her apple. The second part \"harmless as doves\" is the response to the first part. While doves are symbols of true enlightment and foresight, they carry no malice toward others. In the modern version of Eve's story, we fi nd her thinking to herself when she meets the serpent, \"My pastor has told me not to study the adversary and the cults. We only need to know what real money looks like and not to st udy the counterfeit. My pastor has told me what an apple looks like, and that is a real apple. It is a re al apple, and real apples are edible. Mmmm.\" Eve is still getti ng her apple, and is still naive. This book exposes a composite serpent whic h has devised sinister plans concerning everyone. Christians are attracted to its nice looking apple called the New World Order. The book will answer questions like , what does this serpent look like, will it be as good a thing as it looks on the surface, wher e is it, what is its power? The book is based on evidence and testimony. In addition to the evidences obtained from primary documents and books, this work is ba sed on dozens of interviews with informed people. This includes Jehovah's Witnesses, ex-JWs, Mormons, ex -Mormons, New Agers, ex-New Agers, Catholics, Jews, Masons, ex-Masons etc., etc.. The strongest evidences are the personal testimonies given to me by those people that have been intimately involved with the conspirators. Unfortunately, because of the vici ousness of those seeking our enslavement with their grandiose schemes, my sources remain anonymous. This is understandable; such is the exigencies of a spiritual war against powerful conspiracies. What I have done in this publication coul d be called a scouti ng report about our opponent. We are familiar that basketball and football teams se nd out scouts to see what their opponent is doing. We are familiar with how alert an athlete is in watching and forecasting his opponents moves. We would consid er it very unwise if a team choose to close their eyes and stop their hearing when playing another team. Are the scouting reports already made? We need better ones. The ones we have try to stop a snaking river with a stone in place for a da m, at best they redirect the opponent. The scouting report must be able to give us a solu tion, a real remedy that stops the flow because it correctly guages the width of the river. How wi de is this torrent? This ravaging diluge is a conspiracy for power that extends into every dimension of life where power exists, be that religion, politics, finances, edu cation, mass media, or scienc e, and its current has been flowing for centuries. It has even skillfully planned and created its own opposition, which periodically makes prep lanned non-fatal attacks. Back to the basketball analogy, do I really th ink we can beat the world at its own game, especially when it has the home court advant age? No, not if we play their game by their rules. Yes, if we play our game plan and not th eirs. You will find out ways to do this in Unit 3."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In the end it doesn't matter who wins the battle s, but who is on the ultimate winning side when the war ends. Logic alone will tell you that evil which is self-destructive can not be the final victor. It is obvious that life had an intelli gent creator. Do you thin k that an intelligent creator created life only to let it destroy itself? How do we keep score in a sp iritual war? Is a martyr for truth a victory for truth or a defeat for truth? I personally could not sit idly by and watch myself and my loved ones be enslaved. It made me si ck to see the leaders that the Ch ristian people looked up to selling them into slavery. I was tired of the Christian book stores fille d with lies while the truth lay silent. Of course a comprehensive work on the cons piracy of power would be volumnous, so this work concentrates on giving new information on where this crafty snak e has hidden itself in religion. The religious dimension would be shallow without supplementar y information on the other aspects, indeed this work has been desi gned to fill in the gaps and tie together the scouting reports that are available. The vast knowledge I had on th e subject gave me a responsib ility to warn others. I tried unsuccessfully to give my research to others, but in the end found that I would have to do the mission myself. Why did we need another bo ok on the One-World-Religion One-World-Government conspiracy? First, the nature of the Conspiracy's power is so vast no book covers it entirely. It's power is on three levels--a. the dedicated, b. the de luded who have been dece ived into buying into its philosophy, and c. those whom the Conspiracy in their secret papers have called \"cattle\" - those going along with the Zeitgei st of the times. It's power is multidimentional. Many of the books available to the public only scratch the surface of the religious dimension, or even pretend the religious aspect doesn't exist. Even most Christian books tend to dismiss the reality of any spiritual danger from human conspiracies. This book's attemp t to look at real situations which exist behind the scenes hopefully will expose the weakness of the pervas ive Pietist viewpoint which narrowly defines the Christian's enemy as \"the devil.\" Due to the strong pietist infl uence within Protestantism in the Western World today, many Christians perceive spiritual warfare as some thing happening only on a spiritual level, something involving only the de vil, and something happening only on a personal level. The world is not perceived as a thre at. This pietism shields Chri stians from the fact that the world is out to destroy them, that there are real humans and real human institutions that desire to do physical harm to them. The result of the Pietist view is that it shields the Prot estants from experiencing the Spiritual power of the Christia n community. Salvation is view ed on a very selfish personal level, and not as an aspect of Christian community. The church to the pietist is merely an aggregation of individuals. Concer ning a wide variety of church es, even sects, that I have experienced, my opinion is that with minor ex ceptions the only Christian groups that really experienced Christian community were those of the Anabaptist tradition. These communities know already that the world is not a neutra l environment, because they are sincerely attempting to live out in real life Christ's Sermon on the Mo unt. To give one example: the Amish believe Christians should care for their elderly. They do not view the State as a neutral or benevolent force, but an anti-Christia n force that is treated with love as Christ responded to the despotic Roman rulership. Because of this viewpoint they rejected participation in the Social S ecurity program and are respon sibly caring for their elderly better in many ways than the ge neral public. Because these Ch ristians are willing to accept that the world they live in contains real liv e enemies, these type of Christian communities"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"have already caught onto many of the solutions to the New World Order and are implementing them even though they are not awar e of the extent of the human conspiracy that this book exposes. The Pietist view refuse s to see the U.S. government as a threat, and so they have no problem giving the State more power to care for their elderly. Second, this book \"Be Wise As Serpents...\" wa s written to show the full width and depth of the One-World-Religion while edu cating the reader how the One- World-Religion relates to the other powerful dimensions of the Conspiracy. This book is designed for any freedom loving truth loving person. You do not need to be a Christian to appreciate this book. My guess is that sadly many non-Christians will be too brainwashed already to read something that is written by a Christian. In some ways, I can sympathize with non-Christians in this, because much of what is passed off as \"Christian\" is trash. There are no sacred cows in my book. The world's manure caked bovines are shown for what they are. I treat God Almighty with respect and esteem his Word as Truth, because in my life they have proved trut hful. Many people mock God and the Bible, but have never sincerely tested the validity and truthfulness of both. People who have not experienced the power of God in their lives, will not understa nd my motivation. I was sustained in writing this book by my conviction that the power of God which I have pe rsonally witnessed will somehow ultimately win the war against evil. It is beyond my comp rehension how; God's ways have a tendency to be highe r than my ways, so I am willing to trust in victory, without being granted any special revela tion or visions of the future. I am a soldier of the Lord, ready to stand in place and fight. That is my duty. To the powerhouse Fraternity I be longed to, West Point, USMA , I pledged service to duty honor country. I have wanted to fulfill this in a higher way. If this book ever sees publication, I will have only done my duty with honor for my country, the Kingdom of God. I hope that others who have ma de other pledges will reevaluate their oaths, and choose the higher fulfillment of their search for light by joining with me.

IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS Two words that need to be de fined before the reader proceed s are Christian and Jew (also Jewish). Christian- It was my desire to use language in its common usag e. Who am I to say a person can or can't call himself a Christian? The primar y use of the word Christian in this book is to use it in its broadest sense. Unfortunately, its common usage is so broad that it carries little meaning. Today, it is difficult to say, \"I am a Christian,\" for the disciple of Christ because the word is devoid of meaning. In th is book then, if a Satanist calls hi mself a Christian, he will be nominally refered to in this book that way. (The word Christian may have been originally a derogative word for the disciples of Christ.) The only other sensible alternative use of the word is its legitimate narrow sense which means a true disciple of Jesus. And the word is occasionally used herein in this legitimate narrow sense. It should be pointed out that Jesus commmanded his disciples to love their enemies and to do them good. This means most of the Christian chur ches do not have a Christ-like world view. Or to say it bluntly, most of what is called Christian is not Christia n. Protestants and Catholics think nothing about a millionaire evangelis t preaching Jesus' sermons to the poor. Nor do many of them find discomfort that Protestants may have \"Jesus in their heart\", receive supportive prayers from their chaplains, and then climb into Jet bomb ers and drop 500 lb. bombs onto innocent civilians, who are written off as collateral damage. Jesus continued to call the Temple the \"House of God\" even though it had become a den of thieves. (Cf. Mt 21:13, Mr 11:17, Lu 19:46, et. al.)"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Rather than detract from the readability by la belling all the various groups being used by the Conspiracy Power \"pseudo-Christian\", I prefer to use their own labels. Real Christians are an extremely small maligned minority. Although it is popular to say that it is judging to say someone isn't a Christian, it is e qually judgemental to say he is a Christian. To judge means to form an opinion about, to determine authoritativ ely. This book claims no ability to determine authoritatively the final judgement of peopl e by their Creator. The Scriptures do command Christians to form opinions about the actions a nd fruit of other people based on the authority of the Scriptures. I have done this research and contribute my observations not becau se I am against any particular person or deno mination of Christianity, but because I am sold out to Christ, and believe an expose of traitors (wolves in sheep's clothi ng) will protect the flock and encourage people to seek Godly men. Missing today fro m all the scientific, economic, a nd political studies is the vital voice of God the Creator. He ca n and is making a contribution to solve mankind's problems if mankind would listen. But to lis ten to God, means to quit listening to the SPIN of Cults connected to the Power. How can a Cult speak of God without knowing him? Consequently, there is collective ignor ance, as the people allow the Power to religiously lead them. These people, although nominally Christian, live and worship in such a tw ilight zone that they can't distinquish black from white because of all the gr ey that has resulted, indeed somewhere along the way black has become white and white black. Th e definition of what is really a Christian has been lost in this Twilight Zone. Jew, Jewish.-Some people would insist that the wo rd must mean either a race or a religion. It can refer to the race that were the tribe of Judah. It can also refer to t hose who practice Judiasm. The word has been used to designate both a race and a religion, but toda y it can not be limited by common usage to either one fo r several reasons. Today, the \"Jew ish people\" are not \"a single race\" nor are they \"a single re ligion.\" The Jewish people range from being atheists, humanists, satanists, orthodox Talmudic followe rs, to Torah following Karaites , to upright God fearing men and women. The Jewish Encyclopedia uses the term Jew to mean both those who follow Judaism and those who are merely genetically descended from those who followed J udaism at some time. Rabbi Morris N. Kertzer, a well-known and well- travelled Rabbi when asked to explain Judaism gave a very appr opriate answer to the question what is a Jew. \"What is a Jew? It is difficult to find a single definition. A Jew is one who accepts the faith of Judaism. That is the religious definition. A Jew is one who, w ithout formal religious affiliation, regards the teachings of Judaism - its ethics, its folkways, its literature - as his own. That is the cultural definition of a Jew. A Jew is one who considers himself a Jew or is so regarded by his community. That is the \"practic al\" definition of a Jew. Prof. Mordecai Kaplan calls Judaism \"a civilization.\" Jews share a co mmon history, common prayer, a vast literature and, above all, a common moral a nd spiritual purpose. Judaism is r eally a way of life.\" (A Guide to the Religions of America. Rockefelle r Center, NY: Simon & Schuster, 1955, p.65.) Interesting is Rabbi Kertzer's point that wh ether religious or secular the Jews are \"a civilization\" that share a common purpose. The Mason Richard Carlile quotes favorably in his Manual of Freemasonry, pp. viii, xi, a Rev. Robert Taylor who claims that th e term \"Jew\" was origin ally the term for the 12th degree in the Eleusinian Mysteries which was th e highest degree. The Eleusinian Mysteries began at least 1400 years before Christ and involved Isis and sexual rites. Those who attained the highest Eleusinian degree were named \"Jew\" and were considered to have become God himself by a deification"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"process. Some then would view the term Jew to have come into use not so much from the tribe Judah, but from the fact that the tribal leaders of Benjamin, Judah and Levi were initiated into the Mysteries at Babylon. The Mas onic lodge and Rosicrucians clai m to continue the Eleusinian mysteries. (Whether or not Taylor's view has any historical merit, it is interesting to note that this is an alternative view that apparently a fe w people believe.) This book uses the term Jew in its widest sens e. Some of the people called Jews in this book might be surprised to be so labelled. How do we describe a pe rson who was born to Jewish parent s, adopted by nominal Christians, sprinkled with a little baptismal wa ter, and who then turns to Sata nism? Is he Christian, is he Jewish, is he Satanic? In some cases like th is, the person may in the book be identified as \"Jewish\"- that is if they knew they were a dopted from a Jewish heritage on the assumption \"blood [a blood tie] is thicker than water.\" Blood ties are importan t in Satanism and witchcraft. Many higher witches belong to the traditional view that one needs to belong to a family with a witchcraft heritage to be a real witch. The whole issue is re ally difficult. Karl Marx and Adolf Hitler were both Satanists. They were both nominal Christians, and from the best I can tell both had \"Jewish\" blood. The same Sa tanic blood line that sired Hitler' s parent, financed Karl Marx to write Das Kapital. Why not sa y that Marx was of Satanic blood? Certainly, in these two cases to call either Karl Marx or Adol f Hitler Jewish doesn't seem prope r at all. But then how does one describe their ties? If the word Satanic is used people think of only a spiritual tie in. The word Jewish, although it doesn't prope rly describe either man, co mes closer to helping people understand a blood connection. The use of the term Jewish in this book denot es neither disapproval or approval of a person. It can be correctly argued such a broad use of the terms Christian and Jewish makes them just a whisker above meaningless. I enjoy labelling people just a notch above catching AIDS. To use labels to prejudge someone is superficial. The reason I use the term Jewish is that it is important to show the mu ltitude of blood ties this conspiracy has. One of the primary Satanic groups , which is the vehicle to create a false Messiah for people to worship, is a false Jewish blood group. This false Jewish blood group is a danger to every Jew who loves his Creator, and his Creat or's laws, and his Creator's genuine freedom, (and not the pseudo-freedom passed o ff on the populace like snake-oil.) TERMS IN GENERAL The prophet of Israel Isaiah wa rned \"Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil.\" It seems that some of the advertising bu siness hasn't taken Isaiah to h eart. The English language of the population in general is becoming a tool of evil men, as the misnomers and Double-speak increase. The evil and selfish refer to themse lves as good and generous. Slaves to sin call themselves liberated. The foolish call themselves enlightened. The lustful call themselves \"good lovers.\" Mortals call themselves \"God.\" The oldest religious superstitions call themselves \"the New Age.\""},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"— CHAPTER 1 — WHO BUILT YOUR FRAME OF REFERENCE?

Satanist Aleister Crowle y who felt he was the Beast considered 666 to be his number. Other satanists have considered the number special to use also. Their attraction for the number matches an interesting prophecy made by a fisherman in the first century A.D. This fisherman named J ohn had a vision of the end of the age. From th is be wrote a prophecy \"that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the numb er of a man: Hi s number is 666.\" REV 13:17-18 The significance grows when we ourselves learn how to decode the bar codes into numbers and prove to ourselves that the numbers 666 are the universally hidden numbers. It grows some more wh en we learn about the great secrecy that surroun ds the creation of the Universal Product Code. The significance grows ev en more when we catch on to all the sneaky ways 666 is designed and hidden in many other items, including the cover of the new public school Globalism 2000 curriculum, Treasury Dept. badges, IRS codes and forms, social security forms, credit cards, and some bank cards.

Magic and witchcraft are already being taught in many Christian churches, often under new la- bels. In fact, human sacrifices are already being done in secret in some well known Christian churches with well known pastors. In August 1979, this Author passed some in- telligence information to the CIA via a Jehovah's Witness. 1 Seventy-seven months later, the President announced this information publicly when it was politically advantageous. The release of this in- formation was purely manipulation of the public, and a distortion of histor ical perceptions. It was a lesson on how intelligence information serves those in power. The public is manipulated by those in power through the use of information. What is amazing is how gullible even people with higher degrees are, those people who we might think would know better. Apparently, critical thinkers among the so-called educated public are few. Also, thos e, who have been in the government controlle d educational system longer periods of time, have simply provided the system more time to condition and propagandize them, unless they are the type of person to chal- lenge what they are being fed. On the other hand, it must be remembered that all communication that a pe rson perceives is then related to his or her whole experience. Frag- ments that do not relate to what a person has experienced more often th an not are forgotten. The person may puzzle over the tidbits of incon- gruent fragments, but bei ng unable to relate them to his world view, finds hi mself unable to file the fragments away in a meaningful manner. There seems to be no end to the fragments of information relating to the conspiracy, and these are available to everyone, but the meaning is elu- sive, because the observing public can't assimilate or doesn't want to assimilate their meaning. Making a fundamental change in our frame of reference is a frightening task. The reader isn't a piece of grid paper for me to design his thinking. The reader must participate with me. Even if it is too difficult for you to agree with everything I say, press on, for if you gain even a little insight it will begin a process. 1-4 1 The reason I passed information to the CIA was that while I was in Libya, (working with my father who was with the U.N.), I learned about the large missile silos the Russians had installed and were manning. I had never had anything to do with the CIA but as a concerned citizen for the welfare of the freeworld, I felt an obligation to pass on this information concerning the outflanking of Nato with Russian missiles. Today, I would not pass that information on, because afterwards I learned that CIA agents such as Edwin Wilson were carrying out assassinations for Libya's Qaddafi. CIA agent Wilson hired Anti-Castro Cubans and Green Berets to carry out assassinations and other assignments for Qaddafi. The CIA agents Frank Terpil and Wlson supplied Qaddafi with all kinds of forbidden mi litary hardware like heat-seeking ground- to-air missiles, sabotage and psyc warfare training programs, sophisticated assassination gear and bombs disguised as household trinkets using plastic explosives to slip past airport metal detectors. Wilson supplied planes, men, and weapons for Qaddafi's military invasions of Chad and the Sudan, and supplied training for his airforce which uses Pakistani pilots. (For information on CIA agent Wilson and Libya, and other crimes read Kwitny, Jonathan. The Crimes Of Patriots A True Tale of Dope, Dirty Money, and the CIA NY: W.W. Norton & Co., 1987, pp. 101-104, 291,312-13.) Even after information of these things leaked out, the U.S. government continued to pretend not to notice. Ironically, meanwhile, Reagon was picturing Qaddafi as a bloodthirsty terrorist supported by the Communists, while behind the scenes Qaddafi's invasions and assassinations were made possible by the CIA. While I was in Libya, Americans at home were being led to believe the Libyans were bloodthirsty for American blood, while Americans in Libya were running the oil fields. The reason I mention this anecdote was [a] to show how the public is manipulated by \"news\" and their leaders, [b] to show the reader how this Author has been around and writes from an informed position, [c] to begin destroying the illusion that Jehovah's Witnesses have nothing to do with the CIA or the New World Order.

I'll do my part in providing evidence, but I'm dependi ng on you to get some- thing out of this book. I anticipate much of th e reading audience may be Bible readers. Why s hould Bible readers read this book? Doesn't the Word of God fully equip us? In one sense it doe s. A soldier is fully equipped going into battle, but he must s till study his enemy. When a missi onary uses a Chilton's manual to repair a car, or prays for wisdom he is showing that the Bible was not designed to answer every question. What ma ny Christians seem un- aware of, perhaps it is a s ecret, is that the Bible was intentionally ambigious and insufficient so that we would turn to Go d and trust in Him, and not in some formula or knowledge. Knowledge is a tool. And as a tool it can be used for good or bad. The most sordid events have been used by God. The Bible stories are full of humans at their worst. But God is able to communicate to us a spiritually beneficial me ssage from su ch events. Likewise, it is this book's purpose to be spiritually beneficial. This book is not a prophetic panhandler. Speculation on Bible prophecy is absent from this book. This book is base d on fact, solid facts known to me about the Ne w World Order regime and its one-world-religion. The entire picture is lacking in confirmed details at a few points and in these areas I try to advise the readers that I am giving only my observations. By and large you will be reading fact, not theory. It is a complex picture when the pieces are all jumbled up. Hopefu lly, an integrated de- sign will be seen by the r eader by the end of the book. SOME OF US WANT TO BE FOOLED I was a West Pointer. We st Point cadets learn the meaning of authority and discipline. I still believe in obedience to authority. Many relig- ious or patriotic people want to believe in our leaders, for they feel it is our duty, right or wrong, to blindly obey. While in the military, I believed in obedience to authority . My primary focus in the military was how to ca rry out an order, not whether the order had merit. In this regard, I was like many of the men and women in this nation, an instrument of those who are deceiving this nation. It is proper to obey authority. Even more important, it is proper to obey our highest authori- ties. As a Bible believer and as a child of God, you will want to obey you r heavenly parent. If you do not believe in God, perhaps you believe in the Constitution or the c oncept of Man's freedom. The Declaration of In dependence and the Bill of Rights are reminders to patriotic Americans that there are limits to what a government should or even legally can do. Re member God is a higher authority, remember the Constitution is a higher authority. At times a person must prefer to obey a higher authority — did not even the founders of the American government and its laws say, \"When in the course of human events it becomes NECESSARY for one pe ople to DECLARE the causes which impel them to a separation...\"? After reading this book, you the reader will learn more on how the Cold War at the highest level was a staged production, reaping all kinds of benefits for those seeki ng to rule th e world, and creating a frame of refere nce that made it difficult for people to see beyond an east-west confronta- tion. What's funny, in a sad wa y, is that there were people predicting the tota l collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, becaus e they had se en through the conspiracy, and yet th e press again has still pulled a fast one on us.

Because they did nothing serious diplomatically toward this, it was clear that they meant to do it militarily. Those of us who have been to that area of the world, like myself , knew the Ir aqi military threat was way overblown. Again, it was clear from history what the m ilitary would do. This author is no military geni us, but he stated before Desert Storm that the m ilitary thing to do would be to first bomb for one month and then go around the fortifications like th e Germans did the Maginot line. Knowing what was going to happen made it hard to watch the care fully orchestrated media manipulate the people. Ther e is much more that could be said about wh at went on behind Amer- ica's back during the Ira q-Kuwait crisis, but the point is simply this, some people were not being surprised by what happened. If your frame of referenc e grows as a result of this book, perhaps you t oo will not be surprised next time. Another example of how the public's frame of reference is lacking is Nixon. The Power built Nixon's false public imag e as a hard-nose anti- communist conservative, yet he was actually working for the conspiracy. His liberal voting record, his establishment of close ties with Com- munist China haven't been given much analysis, because that wouldn't fi t his public image — that frame of reference that th e Power created that he was an anti-communist crusader. Harvard his- tory professor John Kenneth Galbraith, a socialist, revealed in the New York Magazine (Sept. 21, 1970) p. 25 that Nixon had surrounded himself as President with leading leftists and was pushing a Socialist agenda. Perhaps your high school history book like mi ne showed a picture of Nixon waging an anti-Comm unist crusade in the 1950's. Later, I learned that Nixon's involve- ment was really a sham. Another random exampl e is the album cover of Beatle star Harrison's Living in a Material World. This album cover does indeed show us how we are to live in a material world. The cover shows a hand containing money with the chakra point on the opposite side being illuminated. To me, this clearly shows an initiation point already in use and which is plan ned for the general popu- lation in the future. (It also happens by some holy coincidence to fit th e Bible prophecy of the Mark of the Beast needed to buy and sell.) By the way, this book's st ory does not need Bible prophecy to prop it up. Whether you believe in Revelations or not, it is s till possible to realize that a New Age initiation process has already begun. Our previous experience and our information available will directly influence how accurately each of us assigns mean ing to information we receive. This Author knew Harrison was into Hinduism. Although Hinduism and the New Age are not exactly synonym ous the terms can be used interchangeably here in regards to Harrison. (The meaning of such terms will be detailed later.) I am also aware that th e New Age movement has already begun initiations at the chakra points. I have seen horns tatooed onto the third eye posi- tion. I have experienced as an observer Hinduism first hand, and listened to New Agers discuss the chakra points. I have studied Texe Marrs' Mystery Mark of The New Age which ex- amines in detail the initia tion point and what is happening today compared to REV 13:16, 17. Revelation 13 says the Mark of the Beast will be placed on right hands and foreheads. These chakra positions are alre ady initiation points for the New Age.

President Bush's remarks about the New World Order are another example. Few Ameri- cans are aware that Bush belongs to a powerful group called the Order (believed to be part of the American portion of the Illuminati). Nor are most Americans aware of what kind of New Order these people want for us. So when Bush says a New World Order is bei ng created, most people must surmise at best what they think he means by this. 4 (See this footnote for the documentation of Bush's membership in the Order.) The popular film Indian a Jones and the Last Crusade provides the next example. At one point Indiana Jones (Harrison Fo rd) is told, The quest for the Grail is the quest fo r the divine in all of us. At a later point, a character who has belonged to a secret order tells Indiana Jones how his Order has protected the Grail for 2,000 years. Those who have read Holy Blood Holy Grail will recog- nize at once that this is preparing viewers to accept the new Messiah. Holy Blood Holy Grail ex- poses a conspiracy connected to groups such as the Masons and other secret gr oups to introduce a new Messiah. Supposedly the Ho ly Grail that secret societies have preserved is the holy blood line of Jesus Christ. By unconscious persuasion the viewer is having his frame of reference expanded so that when the story line of the new Messiah is presented, he will be able to place it within his frame of reference. How has the American public had their frame of reference created by the conspiracy? More will be provided later on, but a few quick points can help establish for the Reader the extent of the conspiracy. They have been in control since the American Revolution. Over a period of 200 years they have had the time and the resources to create history and news. (See chapter 3-5 and 3-6) They control the ma jor newspapers and the major political figures. If a President stepped too far out of line, he was as sassinated. In each case, the assassination has b een covered up. Although the coverup in the Kenne dy and Lincoln assassi- nations doesn't fool anyone willing to look at the evidence, still they got aw ay with it. They have written our history books and our text books. They have created such an artificial frame of ref- erence that the public finds it hard to hang factual information about the conspiracy in their frame of reference. But this didn't happen overnite, they have had two hundred years. Impossible you say! Article I, Section 8,10: U.S. Constitution forbids the production of paper- money by the government. Has this been ignored and circumvented? Do you use paper money? Oh, does it seem impossible? Another eye opener is the id entity of who wrot e Shakespeare's works. Manly P. Hall, a powerful Mason (whose credentials are s hown in the photocopies of Masonic material follo wing this opening chap- ter), provides proof in his book that Sir Francis 4 The connections of Bush to the Power documented in th is book (the New Order) are so numerous they won't all be given here except in brief form. His membership in the Order is discussed in Antony Sutton's America's Secret Establishment. A Biography about George Bush by Fitz Hugh Green entitled George Bush An Intimate Portrait (NY: Hippocrene Books, 1989) makes passing reference to his membership in the Skull & Bones Fraternity (p. 48) and the Andover Fraternity (p. 49) . Sutton's books serve as a good beginning to document and study what George Bush is. One of his books is The Two Faces of George Bush. This information has been leaking slowly into the news in a way to keep some lid on it. The Williamette Week (Sept. 19-25,1991, Portland, OR) had an long article on the facts about Bush's Skull & Bones membership, pp. 1,8-11 based on John Lawrence's research. However, the tenor of the article was that the Order had little to do with a grand conspiracy but had much political influence. Without a proper frame of reference this type information is forgotten, ignored, or misused by people. Bush is al so a 33 degree Freemason, (testified to by numerous Masonic sources) even though it is being denied by the White House. He has oil connections, banking connections, intelligence connections and he was director of the CIA. He has connections with blood lines connected to the Conspiracy.

His Zapata oil rigs were used to smuggle drugs into the U.S. Drugs were unloaded on the oil platforms off the coast of TX The small boats coming from the platfo rms do not go through customs.

And the cold war was real for the common man. But now these vast spy networ ks can not be disman- tled. A great deal of th eir activities have nothing to do with the reasons th ey were created. And we unwittingly fund these secr et services that spy on us, and are at the complete disposal of the con- spiracy. The machinations of the secret services such as MI 5, MI 6, the FBI, the CIA, and others boggle the mind. It is no comfort to real ize that men identified as related to the Conspiracy are also men in control of the secret services. The tie-ins by the leader- ship of all of these agencies to the Conspiracy confirms confidential leak s that they are used by the Conspiracy. For inst ance, George Bush(the Order) dir. CIA, Lord Ro thschild (family part of the center of power) CSC (chief) of MI 6, Hugh Sinclair (family part of blood line for new Mes- siah) CSC (chief) of MI 6...and on and on... This chapter is not the place in this book to detail all this. It may be sufficient at th is point to simply sum up the power of MI 6 (British Secret Service overseas) and the American system that works hand in glove with the British by quoting Nigel West, an expert on MI 6, ...\"the firm, as it is re ferred to by outsiders, enjoys a unique reputati on for stealth, devious efficiency, ruthlessness and, it must be said, treachery. It has often been considered all-pow- erful, wielding enormous secret influence. It was once said in Americ a in the 1920s that six institutions rule the wo rld: Buckingham Palace, the White House, the Bank of England, the Fed- eral Reserve Bank, the Vatican and the British Secret Service.\" Should the reader indul ge this Author long enough, he shall learn that apparently all these centers of power Nigel West thought ruled the world are controlled by an single elite group. If the evidence shows that th e last two popes are not only Masons, but part of the conspiracy, (the pre- sent one is Jewish by the way) then indeed they have solidified the power of the world into one hegemony. This Author would like to introduce the reader to this conspiracy and do so at whatever point of entrance will work for th e individual. But he would also like the chance to suggest the means to implement readjustments. What good is it to know that a One-World-Government is planned if there is no means to resist? You can start by turning off the television and reading this book. You can start by turning off the control gnostic religious leaders have imposed upon you and thinking for yourself. Di sconnect yourself from the umbilical cords of th e conspiracy, which have fed you misleading information. You can start by thinking. Use this book as a launching pad to new investigations, it is not an infa llible crutch to lean on, although the author will try to give the documentation you need. So me of the documen- tation can simply not be given. Dozens of interviews with people ha ve simply resulted in the author knowing dangerous information that no- body wants to have their name associated with. IMAGINE LIVING UNDER HITLER The German population feared the Gestapo. The same International group of people that helped Hitler to power and assisted him to cleanse Europe of unwanted people are ready to go to work cleansing again. (See ch apter 2 and other parts for the details.) WHAT THIS BOOK IS NOT This book is not a comp rehensive study of the conspiracy, in spite of th at appearance. It is ac- tually a limited study on how a one-world-religion has been created, and is to become the religion of the New World Order that forces are moving us toward. Many different groups ha ve been studied in- depth, and all kinds of people with clues to how power is really functioning talked to. For in- stance, this Author stud ied the following group. EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE GROUPS STUDIED In Rabbi Jack Moline's book Growing Up Jewish on page 76 he clai ms that Congress is run by the Jews, \"For years, anti-Semites have ac- 1-9"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"FRAME OF REFERENCE cused Jews of controlli ng Congress, and for years it has been denied. Ir onically, as of 1984, the Jews do control Congress. A recent survey of the 435 representatives, shows that for all practical purposes, 219 are practicing Jews. Interest- ingly, twelve members of the Black Congressional Caucus ar e Ethiopian Jews. On the Senate side, an astounding 62 out of 100 Sena- tors identify themselves as Jews!\" (This surely doesn't square with what the press is telling the public.) 6 The Jewish author A. Cowen, in his book The X-Rays in Freemasonry, on pa ge 6 says that Jews control Freemasonry, \"The Jews swarmed into it (Freemasonry) from the earliest times and control- led it through the higher grades and councils. They have controlled the ancient and accepted Scottish Rite since the beginning of the Nineteenth Century.\" (This is not wh at the Scottish Rite is telling the public.) The widely known Jewish author Marcus Eli Ravage in an article in Century Magazine, Jan. 1928 wrote, \"We Jews are at the bottom of nearly all your wars; not only of the Russian but of every other major revolution in your history. We did it solely with the irresistable might of our spirit, with ideas and propaganda.\" Rabbi Stephen Wise, a Scottish Rite Mason and leader in the Order of B'nai B'rith, when discussing communism said, \"Some call it com- munism; I call it Judaism.\" (See the American Bulletin, 5/15/1935) What? How can commu- nism be related to Judaism? There are many other identical claims or simi- lar ones made by other Jews in books and articles whose primary reading audiences would be Jew- ish. In investigating what power or powers control our lives, it was necessary to check the record to see if these Jewish claims had any valid- ity. This Author is a researcher, a detective who wants to ferret out the original documents, dis- cover an honest history ba sed on a more balanced, broader picture of what happened in the past. THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR OR AGAINST ANY RACE This book is not a book about races, even though race plays a part in the story. The God of the Bible not only claims responsibility for creat- ing the races, but also Hi s belief that before Him they are all equal. Script ures categorically state, \"But now you must also put off all these: anger, wrath,... put on the new ma n who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all in all.\" Christ placed no conditions on the great commis- sion. This Author could care less what race the world says you are. Popular concepts of race are to a large degree based on myths. If the Arabs are from Ishmael, and the over twelve million Ashke- nazim Jews are descended from the Khazars as some Jewish historians validate, then these Aske- nazim Jews are derived from a combination of European blood overlaying the blood of a Mongo- lian tribe. This Mongolian tribe, the Khazars, claim Togarmah, a pagan person found in the Bible as their ancestor. Consequently, the ma- jority of people called Je ws would not even carry Semitic blood. The Arabs are known to be de- scended from Shem, hence Semites. Since the Jewish people are today the persecutors of the Arabs in the Middle East (at least by some Arab perceptions) that would make the Ashkenazim Jews the biggest anti-semites in the world. At any rate, there are so many myths, so much intermarriage, and movement of peoples that the popular 'histories' of races should be tossed in the garbage. This Author believes that before our Creator there is no Jew, there is no Gentile, there is no Greek, no German, no Ne- gro, no Scythian. 1-10 8 For instance, Parade Magazine's Intelligence Report reports that 41 —that means 7 1/2% of the 540 Congressmen are Jewish.

Pollock has a beef with the Israeli government. His elaborate plans to celebrate this September the 1.000th anniversary of the Jewish-Khozar alliance were sum- marily rejected. An elderly, meek-looking man who migrated to Israel from Russia 43 years ago, Pollock ekes out a living as a translator of scientific texts and proofreader in a publishing firm. But his great passion, hobby and avocation is historic research. He has devoted 40 of his 64 years to trying to prove that six out of 10 Is- raelis and nine out of 10 Jews in the Western Hemisphere are not real Jews' Jews, but descendants of fierce Kho- zar tribes which roamed the steppes of southern Russia many centuries ago. For obvious reasons the Israeli authorities are not at all eager to give the official stamp of approval to Pol- lock's theories. \"For all we know, he may be 100 per cent right,\" said a senior gov- ernment official. \"In fact, he is not the first one to discover the connection be- tween Jews and Khozars. Many fa- mous scholars. Jews and non-Jews, stressed these links in their historical research works. \"But who can tell today what per- centage of Khozar blood flows in our veins, if at all? And who can declare with any degree of scientific accuracy which Jews are Jews and which de- scendants of this Tartar-Mongol race? \"As a matter of fact, our alleged descent from the Khozars is the cen- tral theme of Arab propaganda,\" he added. \"The Arabs claim most Euro- pean Jews have no right to be in Israel in the first place because they are not descended from Biblical Hebrews, but from Tartar-Mongol nomad tribes, in- cluding the Khozars who were con- verted to Judaism en masse 1,000 years ago.\" Scientific opinion in Israel is divided on the subject. No one argues the basic premise: that a group of 12.000 Jews, fleeing from persecution and wart in the Holy Land, in the wake of Byzan- tine and Moslem co nquests, made the long overland trek to Persia, crossed the territory of today's Turkestan in Central Asia and found asylum in the Khozar Kingdom, which occupied a vast area between the Caspian Sea, Volga River, Ural Mountains, Black Sea and the Polish borderlands. In the year 965 the Khozars were de- feated for the first time in 500 years, by Prince Sviatoslav of Kiev. King Bulan III of Khozaria concluded that Prince Sviatoslav emerged victorious from the war because his troops and mercenaries were Christians, while his nomads were pagan worshipers. The king and his nobles embraced Judaism in 965, and in 966 a royal edict was passed enforcing Judiasm as the only legal religion in the Khozar Kingdom. Tribesmen had to undergo circumci- sion, learn Hebrew prayers and recog- nize Jewish rabbis as their spiritual leaders — on pain of death. As other Jews who were persecuted in the Middle East, medieval Europe and Spain at that time, heard of the new Jewish-Khozar kingdom, rumors spread that the Messiah had arrived at long last. There were several consecu- tive migration waves to Khozaria, via Persia, Greece and Poland. Pollock believes the traditional Rus- sian anti-Semitism probably stems from that epoch when Hebrew-speak- ing Khozar raiders attacked Russian villages, killed the men folk, abductod women, forcibly converted them to Judaism and married them in full- fledged religious ceremonies. This also would explain why so many European Jews are blond and blue-eyed, with a slight Mongol slant to their eyes, as well as the total absence of Semitic features among many Israelis of Euro- pean descent. The flourishing Jewish-Khozar King- dom was destroyed in 1230 by the Mon- gol invasion of Ban Khan. Following the Mongol invasion and conquest, surviving members of Jew- ish-Khozar tribes trekked west and settled in Poland, Hungary, Bohemia, Austria, Romania and the Ukraine. How can one find out if he is a \"Kho- zar Jew\" or a \"Hebrew Jew?\" According to Pollock, whose parents came from Poland, if your name is Halperin, Alport, Halpern, Galpern, etc., you are a 100 per cent Khozar. \"Alper\" means \"brave knight\" in the Khozar tongue, and the name was granted by the king to the most dis- tinguished warriors. Names like Kap- lan, Caplon, Koppel, and the like are positive proof of Khozar descent, ac- cording to the scholar. \"Kaplan\" means \"fierce hawk\" in the Khozar language. Kogan, Kagan, Kaganovich show aristocratic descent from Kagan- Hagan, King Bulan's chief minister. 1-12 Figure 1-6"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 Likewise, the reader may trace his Saxon an- cestors back to the Scyt hians, and from Assyrian tablets to Palestine. Just be aware that obedience to God, whether Gentile or Israelite, is a pre-con- dition of blessing, accordi ng to the history of the Bible. (Romans 2:28-29 sums it up). Unfortunately, in the history of mankind, ra- cism has played a role th at has shown us the bad side of humanity. This is not to say that the races don't exist, nor does this mean God doesn't bless cities, tribes or nations as a group. But race has been such an important i ssue to many pe ople in the wrong way, and so much so that the ideas and myths of race have wove n themselves into the fabric of the conspiracy and can not be separated out without tearing out part of the story. With the One-World-Power all racism be- comes even more dangerous. Why? Read Orwell's 1984. Remember Krystalnacht. The One-World-Power loves to direct people's hate to their own advantage. The motion picture indus- try and their editing abilities are a powerful tool in creating and directing peopl e's hates. On Aug. 1, 1990, Saddam Hussein wa s a good guy. Such a good guy that our President and gov ernment were generously supplyi ng him with lots of credit and weapons. But after the invasion of Kuwait, it did not take long for tele vision to create an image that Saddam Hussein had been an evil Hitler for a longtime. Indeed, he pr obably has been a rotten character for a long time. The point that the reader is being reminded of is that your image of hiM, whether good (during the Iraq-Iran war) or bad (during the Kuwait cris is), was formed by the system's television. For some reason most peo- ple don't ask, If he was a Hitler in 1989, why were we doing business with him? Many peo- ple's frames of references are built like faucets that the media controls and can turn hot or cold. Does the reader want to be a media faucet? One idea that has been conditioned into the Christians through Christ ian television and their leaders (which will be disc ussed later in this book) is that the Jewish people are the apple of God's eye, the seed of Abraha m, God's Chosen People. This prevalent form of racism is unquestionably accepted because the Old Testament blessings of God are applied to the Jewish nation. Christians apply for instance the blessing given to Balaam to Israel today, \"Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curset h thee.\" Num 24:9 Chris- tians have been conditioned to view Israel as the prodigal son that the Father continues to smile on and bless. A more accurat e view is that mankind in general are prodigal sons that the Father contin- ues to have patience with. He actively watches for us to come home to Him. The last thing this Author wanted to do was to thrust upon the reader a ny controvery concerning the Jews that might upset him and stop people from getting the wealth of bene ficial knowledge this book has. But readers of the manuscript kept wanting to know where I got authority to dare criticize anyone Jewish. Aren't the Jewish peo- ple under a special blessing that exempts them from criticism or exposure? Those who claim God's blessings to Israel base their claims to that blessing on two criteria. Either they claim the bl essing on the basis Israel is the PHYSICAL seed of Abraham, or that they are Israel being the SPIRI TUAL seed of Abraham. According to JEWISH scholarship, modern Israel is neither. 80% of the Je ws today are not geneti- cally the seed of Abraham, but are descended from the Khazar tribe in Asia which later was forced to move into Po land, and other European areas. The Khazars beca me Jews because their King decided his Asian kingdom would adopt the Jewish religion. See the page for a photocopy from a JEWISH HISTORICAL ATLAS authored by a JEW who is a JEWISH HISTORIAN. In- formed Jews know of this . It is in the Jewish Encyclopeadia. The Sephardic Jews in Israel, who are genetic descendants of Abraham, not only are a minority in Israel but, according to some of them, are abused and discriminated- against by the majority of Jews which are descen- dants of the Khazars. Ev en the Sephardic Jews have assimilated much of the genes of other na- tions. Sephardic Jews from Africa look like Africans, from China th ey look like Chinese. Are they spiritually in line for a blessing? The Universal Jewish Ency ., p. 637, states that the ultimate authority fo r Orthodoxy is the Baby- lonian Talmud. The Bibl e itself ranks second to it in reality, if not theo ry. That 6,000 page Tal- mud, although not written when Christ was alive, is part of the system Ch rist repeatedly rebuked in public as the syna gogue of Satan. It is only Chris- tian ignorance of what the Talmud actually says 1-13"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"FRAME OF REFERENCE that prevents Christians from realizing that that Jewish statement alone morally separates the Or- thodox Jews from God's blessings. The Jew Jesus Christ rejected certain Jews' claims that they were God's chosen people, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.'\" Jn 8:39 The Jew and ex-rabbi A postle Paul dropped a bombshell when he declar ed not everyone who is born of Jewish parents a nd educated in the syna- gogue is viewed by God as children of God's promised blessing. \"For they are not all Israel who are of Israel; nor are they all children because they are the seed of Ab raham; but, 'In Isaac your seed shall be called.' That is, those who are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as the seed.\" Rm 9:6-8. The Christian church trembles today before the Chosen Race, and is af raid to criticize any- thing the American government does to assist Israel. Nor will many of the Christian ministers speak out against the human rights abuses done to the Palestinians. They have hurt the cause of Christ several ways, first, there are a good num- ber of Palestinian Chri stians, second, the Arab world has rejected Christ because of Christian support for Israel, and th ird, they are supporting human rights abuses. Since the Orthodox Jewish system was operating in Jesus' time it is clear what the Christian view was. The Christian Apostle Paul states that the good Orthodox Jews of pure descent are not the seed of Abraham. Romans 2:8,29 says this very thing. Even Jews who have read about Moses will realize the great Moses was not allowed into the Promised Land for simply disobeying in one small matter. God wanted a holy people. Before God allowed the Children of Israel into the promised land, they had to wander 40 years to purge them- selves of their sinful a ttitudes, disobedience, and idolatry. That was the good Lord's moral stand- ard then, and I find no scri pture that reveals God has lost his moral inclinations since then. Why will this Author make references to Jews? THEIR ROLE Jews have given us Jesus, and many other positive th ings. It was a Jew, Michael Landon, who bucked the System to bring us Little House on the Prairie and Highway to Heaven. It was also a Jew, Henry H. Klein, who warned the world with his book entitled A Jew Exposes The Jewish Wo rld Conspiracy. Many attempts were made on Kl ein's life. The events this book covers are worl d-wide, and entail more than the Jewish people. Anti-semitism is a tool of the Conspiracy. Klein and others have ex- posed that. Who do you think controls the Ku Klux Klan? THEIR HIDDEN IDENTITIES According to Jewish sources, half of the Jews no longer have names that are recognizably Jew- ish. Further, reliable Jewish sources indicate that on a yearly basis about 80 % of the applications for name changes in the Un ited States are Jewish. Where 50,000 applications are made roughly, that means on a yearly basis 160, 000 Jews change their names legally, (this is not referring to marriages) and almost all of the name changes are to non-Jew- ish sounding names. 7 Because the Jewish peop le are not easily iden- tified, and yet are interwoven so deeply into the whole story line, it is ne cessary to point them out as the story develops. Scottish and British blood lines also play a part in the story. Th ey too will be pointed out. THE NEW MESSIAH HAS A JEWISH LINE- AGE Putting aside the Bible, and observing care- fully what is happening today, the good observer will note several men are being groomed for a role as the new Messiah. The new Messiah will have the lineage of David and Ch rist. (At least that is 1-14 7 Kaganoff, Benzion C. A Dictionary of Jewish Names and their History. Schocken Books, 1977, pp.69, 72."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 what will be said.) Who can say how things will go for this Priest/King? But in the long run it must surely fail, because it is built on the same man-made ideas that have failed before. If this new Messiah doesn't fail, one of his successors will, otherwise thousands of years of historical lessons mean nothing. If people knew history, they would recognize that today's New Age move- ment is simply a regurgitation of all the ancient superstitions that failed mankind long ago. This is another example of the inadequacies in our media built Frame of Reference. That certain Jews are involved is one thing. But not all Jews are alike, and this leads us to another question, who is a Jew? This author has not used the term in the narrow sense that a very Ortho dox Jew in Israel might. On the other hand, he has not used it in a way that would please those who might call themselves Jews, based on evidence of the migration of the 10 Israelite tribes. Anyone descended in some way from Jewish heritage gets the label. The descendents of the 10 tribes should be called Isra- elites anyway. Labels can be very important to people, but it is impossible to please everyone. Likewise, the label Christian is used loosely, as a label for those who claim to be Christian. God is not going to judge people on the basis of labels. For Him there is no stigma attached to being labeled Jewish, nor any bene fit to the label Chris- tian. What you actually are is what is significant. This book is about the misapplication of God's promises to control people to serve a Power. The reader may on his own wa nt to discover what God's promises are, and to whom those promises are made. THIS BOOK IS NOT ABOUT FEAR This book is not about f ear. Cowards will not read this book. They will re turn to their ostrich existence afraid to face reality or challenge their world view. The universal religion being brewed up for us is devoid of faith, hope, and love, so it is important to keep peopl e distracted with mean- ingless entertainment. This religion speaks of a cluster of values and a common fabric of values which leaves out faith in the Word of God. It speaks of evolution. It values what man can do. This Author has a hope, a faith in the ultimate triumph of good, a trium ph man alone can not achieve. And yet what is faith without works. If my neighbor is hungry and I only pray for him, that is not faith. If I am simply going to pray about all this when I can do other things, that is not faith. Faith without works is dead. So I give you this book revealing the struggle between God's value system and man's. This Author is betting on God's. WHAT this book is reveal ing is the struggle be- tween God's value system and man's. This Author is betting on God's. WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT After telling you what this book is not, it i s not about race and it is not about fear, it is time to tell the reader what this book is about. This book concerns TRUTH and which AUTHORITY we go to for truth. What? Yes, Authority, because unless we replace the lying One-World-Power as our source of TRUTH, we are not going to resist it. Is there any Authority that stands against the One-World Power? Those people who view God as an ultimate Authority, are not allowing themselves to be cowed into going along with what they know is evil. God is a rival authority to the One-World- Power and One-World-Religion. Religions have been used by the One-World-Power (you will learn that as you read), so it is not religion per se that is in opposition to the One-World-Power, but those fanatics who believe that there is right and wrong, because they believe in their Creator. This book is not an attack on individual relig- ious or philosophical beliefs, except where necessary to turn people from the false Authority of the One-World-Power. I say false because when we have attended school, we believed we were being handed the unadulterated truth. When we read our so-called free-press and media we thought we were bei ng handed the unadulter- ated truth. When we we nt to our Kingdom Halls, Masonic Halls, our churches and synagogues we 1-15"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"FRAME OF REFERENCE believed we were bei ng given the unadulterated truth. It is difficult to swallow that the same Authority that lied to us in the Kingdom Hall, in the Masonic Hall, in th e Churches, and in our synagogues was the very same authority. This book's task is to demonstr ate what fals e authority is behind the One-Worl d-Religion a nd its New Order. BUT IS THERE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN GOD & TRUTH? Science thought so. If it wasn't for the idea of creation by God, scien ce would not have gone out looking for the princi ples that govern the uni- verse. Science had the no tion that a ma ster mind had created this world, and that understanding the Universe was a window on that master mind. The subject of Geometry became sacred, because men realized that the entire Universe can be de- scribed mathematically, therefore Geometry was viewed as a window to God's thought processes. The foundation of Govern ment authority im- plies so. That men are to be governed implies that good rather than evil should be promoted. That behavior can be cl assed as good or bad ties into the concept that man sins. The God of the Bible clearly states man sins and is sinful. The concept of sin elevated th e Children of Abraham's view of God had over the pagan view of the gods. Perhaps the reader is pr otesting that real gov- ernments today don't speak of sin, how can their authority be from God? If sin does not exist, what authority do gov- ernments have to tell peopl e how to live their lives. Because we don't acknow ledge that man sins, we end up in a situati on like the man in law enforcement who told the Author that there is no such thing as sin. After listening to his view, it was as if there are two basketball teams, the good guys and bad guys; our side are the good guys, the other side the bad. Therefore, he tells me there is nothing wrong for the CIA to bring in and sell drugs in this country . (Yes, he is fully aware they do.) But the bad guys are those guys in the streets selling drugs. This man hates people with rigid beliefs of right and wrong, and under- standably so. If he didn't, how could he rationalize his support for the system? Who gives the U.S. government the authority to smug- gle in and sell narcotics while at the same time waging a war against drugs?

The One-World-Power wants no rival. Their mass media is being used as a tool to destroy this rival authority. So much hate has been injected into the public's mindset that many people will not tolerate this book be cause it holds up God's authority. The public is unaware of the constant bombardment of anti-Chri stian material spewing forth from the media. The Moslems don't fare much better. Those who ar e Arabs and Christians are doubly cursed by this bias. As one Lebanese Christian aptly said, We are hated because we are Christians by the Arabs, and hated because we are Arabs by the Christians. Absolute domini on by God and ab solute truth is being subtly replaced by ministers and evangel- ists, whom you will learn later about in Part 2, with a subjective, false de scription of God. This is the subtle difference between confessing God is Lord and making God the Lo rd of your life. It is the distinction between accurate knowledge of God and a subjective, relative emotional belief. It seems so rigid to belie ve in the existence of sin. It is. It creates st andards. People are be- ing taught to throw out standards. Art and life and other things have lo st their meaning. An- cient Israel stood out as a nation because they tried to have standards. Christians are condemn ed because they look to a rigid written standard . Yet, this is no differ- ent than the Supreme Cour t, which, after hearing opposing arguments, is suppos ed to return to the Constitution for their deci sions. If it is rigid and reactionary for a Christian to follow a written standard, how should we view the Supreme Court? This is why the C onstitution needed to be subverted.

The Establishments Man by James J. Drum- mey This well-written, well -researched book does a good job of exposing George Bush. It is well balanced between appeali ng to the broad masses and providing good detail for the sincere student of the New World Order. One of the shortcom- ings of the book is that they do not show that George Bush is only a cog in the big machinery of the New World Order. A lit tle knowledge can be a dangerous thing. It is important to put George Bush in perspective. Th at is why Be Wise As Serpents is needed by c onspiracy investigators.

This is not the Plan, and if the condition continues uncorrected, phys- ical society will collapse upon the individual, burying him beneath the debris of his own productions. With the rise of materialism, the Secret Societies were concealed from the profane, not by any elaborate machinery of their own, but by popular disbelief. There was no place for sacred institutions in minds already dedicated to scien- tific skepticism. The importance of invisible principles over visible purposes and ambitions was simply ignored. Only that small minority which remained true to a higher standard of values continued to be concerned with inevi- table outcome. For the major ity, the physical world with its wonders was sufficient to absorb all available time and interest. The result is obvious. The physical state of man enlarged, and his ethical horizons were appropriately narrowed. The old adversaries were gone. The power of the Church and State to plague th e destiny of the average man was broken. It was no longer needful to struggle against the despotism of feudalism or the perversities of princes. The Inquisition had lost its te rror, and theology was unable to impose its traditional formulas upon a down-trodden laity. But the ills that men must bear changed their appear- ances, not their substance. Th e authority of science took the place left vacant by the de parting authorities of aris- tocracy and theology. It was st ill necessary for the human spirit to struggle against th e intolerances of the human mind. Personal ambitions, liberated by the new code of freedom, immediately began to dream of supremacy. A vast con- cept, highly competitive in principle and highly destructive in practice, perpetuated most of the instruments of the old tyranny. Siegfried ha d slain the dragon, but was in A MERICA ' S A SSIGNMENT WITH D ESTINY 111 grave danger of being drowned in the blood that flowed from the mortal wound. Having overcome the despotism of entrenched classes, humanity discovered the despotism in itself. It was faced with the unhappy realization that tyrannical systems are only sy mbols of those tyrannical instincts which exist in all creatures until they are over- come by enlightened understanding. —From Hunt's History of the Seal of the United States THE REVERSE OF THE GREAT SEAL Professor Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard described the design thus: \"The device adopted by C ongress is practically incapable of effective treatment; it can hard ly (however artistically treated by the designer) look otherwise than as a dull emblem of a Masonic fraternity.\" This is one of the important esoteric landmarks that have been conveniently ignored. It is evident that the conti nued operations of the genuine Secret Societies make it unwise to describe them or identify their members. Humanity has not yet reached a state of collective security in which leadership beyond the political sphere is unnecessary. The need for guidance actually in- creases with the complexity of mundane affairs. All of sincere heart find consolation in the conviction that powers beyond and above human corruption continue to administer the destiny of the globe. It would be a mistake to confuse this governing body with the various sects which pretend to authority, but give no indica tions or proof that they can manage efficiently even their own affairs.

The theory of freedom could be preserved by Secret Societies, but the practice of freedom required the co- operation of an enlightened people dedicated to a lofty ethical standard. When evaluating the esoteric groups of this period, the most reliable guide is their acceptance of the responsibility of the Great Plan. Progress is not ordinarily for the advancement of the individual, but for the unfoldment of the universal project. The real Esoteric Schools still labor toward the goal of the World Commonwealth. The Plan remains Utopian, and the disc iple advancing through the grades of a legitimate initia te-system is being prepared, not for personal emancipation, but as an instrument for the liberation of his fellowmen. Wherever religious induce- ments are personal and selfish or the devotee is encouraged to advance his own growth wit hout consideration for others, there is something wrong with th e policy of the sect. Yet, the literature of modem me taphysical movements seldom emphasizes growth as responsibility. The reader is encour- aged to study mystical systems or to affiliate with organiza- tions claiming extraordinary knowledge in the hope that he will acquire th e skill to advance his own condition. Where such objectives are used to intrigue the gullible, those of sincere mind and heart are entitled to reservations. The old Secret Societies remain as they had always been, custodians of an overconviction. They are now emphasiz- ing the right use of privileges. Education can be conferred by schools and universities, but enlightenment must still result from internal growth .

If this goodwill finds expression, two things can occur: first, certain poten cies and forces can be released upon the earth which will aid men's effort to attain right human relations, with its resultant effect—peace; secondly, the forces of evil will be so potently defeated that never again will they be able to wreak such universal destruction upon earth. Years ago I said that the war which may follow this one would be waged in the field of the world religions. Such a war will not work out, however, in a similar period of ex- treme carnage and blood; it will be fought largely with mental weapons and in the world of thought; it will involve also the emotional realm, from the standpoint of idealistic fanaticism. This inherent fana ticism (found ever in reaction- ary groups) will fight against the appearance of the coming world religion and the spread of esotericism. For this struggle certain of the well-organised churches, through their con- servative elements (their most powerful elements), are already girding themselves. Those sensitive to the new spiritual impacts are still far from powerful; that which is new always faces the supreme difficulty of superseding and overcoming that which is old and established. Fanaticism, entrenched theological positions, and materialistic selfishness are to be found actively organised in the churches in all continents and of all denominations. They can be expected to fight for their established ecclesiastical order, their mate- rial profit and their temporal rule, and already are making the needed preparations. The coming struggle will emerge within the churches themselves; it will also be precipitated by the enlightened elements who exist in fair numbers already, and are rapidly growing in strength through the impact of human necessity.

This is the revelation which the passage of the candidate through all the degrees conveys. In the first three degrees we have depicted for us the search of the individual for light, wisdom and life. In the higher degrees there is given us the varying aspects of the universal search (by the collective whole) in the various ways, and in the many lands and through the diverse religions, for the final revelation for which the so-called Blue Lodge has prepared the candidate. Subtle and illusive indications are given also of that organised and intelligent activity which is carried on by that Grand Lodge of Master Masons who have for ages watched over humanity and guided men steadily in the way of light. Little as it may be realised by the unthinking Mason who is interested only in the outer aspects of the Craft work, the whole fabric of Masonry may be regarded as an externalisation of that inner spiritual group whose members, down the ages, have been the Custodians of the Plan, and as Those to Whom has been committed the working out of the will of God for the race of men. These Master Ma sons, to whom T.G.A.O.T.U. has given the design and Who are familiar with the tracing board of the G.M. on high, are called by many names and are known at different times by various appellations. They can be referred to as Christ and His Church—that band of disciples who follow in the footsteps and work under the inspira- tion of the great Carpenter of N azareth. They can be known by others as the Masters of the Wisdom for They are skilled in the divine ways and have mastered the arts and sciences which Their fellowmen have yet to ma ster. They are the Dispensers of Light and to Them has been given, by virtue of Their achievement, the privilege and the authority to pronounce the great Masonic formula: 'Let there be light' and to evoke the response: 'And there was LIGHT'.

They are the Rishis of the oriental philosophy, the Builders of the occult tradition and those Individualities of outstanding wisdom, strength and beauty of character Who have guided, by precept and example, the faltering steps of blinded and ignorant humanity. They are the bestowers of the privileges and benefits of initiation, and They prepare the candidate for those great revelations and expansions of consciousness which are the reward of all who persevere in the quest, and thus learn to work in the Temple of the Lord. Step by step They guide the candidate until he has gained the right to stand in the East before the Presence, and there, before the brethren, prove himself initiate. Stage by stage They assist at the unfold ing of the consciousness of the candidate until the time comes when he can 'enter into light' and, in his turn become a light-bearer, one of the Illuminati who can assist the Lodge on High in bringing humanity to light. Silently and with full understanding They watch the initiate go down to the gates of death in order to prosecute the search for the Master's Word and, in defence of his ideals is slain by those with whom he has worked. Then they too go down to the G ...................wherein th e Master lies, and through Their united effort and by the st rength of Their joint endeavour They raise him to the fullness of life and service, giving him that secret which must suffice to guide him in his search until the time comes when the race (a s one united whole) has proved itself fit to receive the true L.W.

The prime work of the church is to teach, and teach ceaselessly, preserving the outer appearance in order to reach the many who are accustom ed to church usages. Teach- ers must be trained; Bible knowledge must be spread; the sacraments must be mystically interpreted, and the power of the church to heal must be demonstrated. The three main channels through which the preparation for the new age is going on might be regarded as the Church, the Masonic Fraternity and th e educational field. All of them are as yet in relatively static condition, and all are as yet failing to meet the need and to respond to the inner pressure. But in all of these three movements, disciples of the Great Ones are to be found and they are steadily gather- ing momentum and will before long enter upon their desig- nated task. The Masonic Movement when it can be divorced from politics and social ends and from its present paralysing condi- tion of inertia, will meet the need of those who can, and should, wield power. It is the custodian of the law; it is the home of the Mysteries and the seat of initiation. It holds in its symbolism the ritual of Deity, and the way of salvation is pictorially preserved in its work. The methods of Deity are demonstrated in its Temples, and under the All-seeing Eye the work can go forward. It is a far more occult organisation than can be realised, and is intended to be the training school for the coming advanced occultists.

In the esoteric group, which is composed of the true spiritual esotericists found in all exoteric occult groups, in the church, by whatever name it may be called, and in Masonry you have the three paths leading to initiation. As yet they are not used, and one of the things that will event- uate—when the new universal religion has sway and the nature of esotericism is u nderstood—will be the utilisation of the banded esoteric organism s, the Masonic organism and the Church organism as initiating centres. Th ese three groups converge as their inner sanctuaries are approached. There is no dissociation between the One Universal Church, the sacred inner Lodge of all true Masons, and the inner- most circles of the esoteric societies. Three types of men have their need met, three major rays are expressed, and the three paths to the Master are trodden, leading all three to the same portal and the same Hierophant. It must not be forgotten that only those souls who are on the Probationary Path or the Path of Discipleship will form the nucleus of the coming world religion. It exists on the inner planes for the purpose of gathering out of all the churches those who have reached the point in evolution where they can consciously and of their own free will place their feet upon that PATH which leads to the centre of peace; who can in full awaren ess turn their eyes upon the Great Lord, and transmute the life of worldly endeavour into the life of service.

The sacraments, properly understood, serve to strengthen this link and realisation, and such a one as that of Baptism (when entered upon with understanding) will draw forth oft a response from the Great Lord Himself. It is almost as if a golden strand were directed from His heart to the heart of the servant—a strand unbreakable and un- fathomable and which, with each administration of any of the holy rites in the succession of lives, becomes stronger, broader and brighter. Eventually these many strands will be- come reabsorbed into their source when the Body of the Christ—one of the seven Heavenly Men on the second or monadic plane—is completed in full expression, for each one linked to Him becomes, in a vital sense, a cell in His Body. This the initiate Paul truly sensed and knew. Via this strand passes the power to strengthen, to stimulate, to vivify and to bless, and this is the true apostolic succession. All true disciples are priests unto the Lord. There is no question therefore that the work to be done in familiarising the general public with the nature of the Mysteries is of paramount importance at this time. These Mysteries will be restored to outer expression through the medium of the Church and the Masonic Fraternity, if those groups leave off being organisations with material purpose, and become organisms with living objectives. When the Great One comes with His disciples and initiates we shall have (after a period of intensive work on the physical plane beginning around the year 1940) the restoration of the Mysteries and their exoteric presentation, as a consequence of the first initiation.

By means of the educational work of the world, the Great Lord seeks to reach tho se of the intelligent public who cannot be reached by means of ceremonial and symbolism as in Masonry, or by religious means and ritual, as in the Church. It touches the masses and those in whom the in- telligence aspect predominates to the lessening of the other two aspects.

In all these bodies there are to be found esoteric groups who are the custodians of the inner teaching and whose uniformity in aspiration and in technique is one. These inner gToups consist of occult students and of those who are in direct or occasional touch with the Masters and of those whose souls are in sufficient c ontrol so that the will of the Hierarchy may be communicated and gradually filter down to the channel ot the physical brain. These groups which constitute the true inner esoteric group are many, but their membership is yet small, for the fact that a student may belong to any of the outer esoteric groups so-called is no indication of his true esoteric status. When the few who are the true esoteric students of the world know the difference between etheric and astral forms, between mental clair- audience and clairvoyance and their astral counterparts, be- tween the elementals of thought and the elementals of na- ture, then will the Christ and His church have a real esoteric group on the physical plane and the outer organisa- tions receive the needed stimula tion.

It must be borne in mind that the true Occultism, the real Mysticism, is essentially religious in its nature, and students must not be surprised to find that some of the historical religious sects—many of the principal secret societies take St. John as their patron saint, notably is this the case with many of the Masonic bodies—had their foundation in Occultism and Mysticism before stated, the Occult doctrines of the Gnostics were heirlooms and sacred traditions from a very distant past, and when the early Christian era dawned, the human ram had long been plunged in the ORIENTAL MASONRY 83 darkening and materializing tendencies of the Black Ages. Soon the Gnosis was rejected by the orthodox church, and the Sacred and Secret teachings of the Great Master, Jesus, become materialized; they have, however, never been lost, and traces of them can be discerned from epoch to epoch. 124. \"The Masonic movement, to state it generally, was at first a sort of broad, semi-mystic and largely moral movement, worked from certain unknown, to Them, centers, and deriving its origin from the Ancient and not generally known basis. 125.

Research es into Masonic literature must be made in many languages and countries before this view can be firmly established for the general world, but to students of Mysticism and who are also students of Masonry it becomes more and more ap- parent that the movement which is generally termed Masonic had its roots in that true Mysticism which originated, as an Ideal e ffort, from the Spiritual Hierarchy which guides the evolution of the world; and that, however much the branches may be separated from the root-idea, there is nevertheless a Mystic Masonry is not from Builder's Guilds of operative Masons "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"84  ANCIENT  MYSTIC teaching in Masonry for those who will seek below the surface. 127. \"The Ancients of Atlantis preserved not less than sixteen distinct Secret Orders, all of which con- stituted—what was known at the time of the advent of Poisedon to the Kingdom of Atlantis—as the Mystic Brother or the Great White Circle.

Hence there ever has been, is, and ever will be Freemasonry on our planet.

Without pressing the argument, I may suggest that some portion, at least, of our symbolism may have come through a Templar source, Romanist, yet deeply tinged with Gnosticism; while at a later date the Lollards, inheritors of Mani chteism, and who were but one of the many religo-political societies with which Europe was honeycombed, possibly introduced or re- vived some of these teachings.

Then, by degrees, all will be pardoned, even Ahriman and the Devs, and admitted to the regions of bliss, and thus there will be a new Heaven and a new earth.\" In the doctrines of Lamaism also, we find, obscured, and partly concealed in fiction, fragments of the primitive truth. For, according to that faith, \"There is to be a final judgment before E SLIK K HAN : The good are to be admitt ed to Paradise, the bad to be banished to hell, where there are eight regions burning hot and eight freezing cold.\" In the Mysteries, wherever they were practised, was taught that truth of the primitive revelation, the existence of One Great Being, Infinite and pervading the Universe, Who was there worshipped without superstition; and His marvellous nature, essence, and attributes taught to the Initiates; while the vulgar attributed His works to Secondary Gods, personified, and isolated from Him in fabulous independence. These truths were covered from the common people as with a veil; and the Mysteries were carried into every country, that, with- out disturbing the popular beliefs, truth, the arts, and the sciences might be known to those who were capable of understanding them, and maintaining the true doctrine incorrupt; which the people, prone to superstition and idolatry, have in no age been able to do; nor, as many strange aberrations and superstitions of the present day prove, any more now than heretofore. For we need but point to the doctrines of so many sects that degrade the Cre- ator to the rank, and assign to Him the passions of humanity, to prove that now, as always, the ol d truths must be committed to a few, or they will be overlaid with fiction and error, and irretrieva- bly lost. Though Masonry is identical with the Ancient Mysteries, it is so in this qualified sense; that it presents but an imperfect image of their brilliancy; the ruins only of their grandeur, and a sys- tem that has experienced progressive alterations, the fruits of social events and political circumstances. Upon leaving Egypt, the Mysteries were modified by the habits of the different nations among whom they were introduced. Though originally more moral and political than religious , they soon became the heritage, as it were, of the priests, and essentially religious, though in reality KNIGHT OF THE SUN, OR PRINCE ADEPT. 6 25 limiting the sacerdotal power, by teaching the intelligent laity the folly and absurdity of the creeds of the populace. They were therefore necessarily changed by th e religious systems of the coun- tries into which they were transp lanted. In Greece, they were the Mysteries of Ceres; in Rome, of Bona Dea, the Good Goddess; in Gaul, the School of Mars; in Sicily, the Academy of the Sciences; among the Hebrews, they partook of the rites and ceremonies of a religion which placed all the powers of government, and all the knowledge, in the hands of the Priests and Levites. The pagodas of India, the retreats of the Magi of Persia and Chaldca, and the pyramids of Egypt, were no longer the sources at which men. drank in knowledge. Each people, at all informed, had its Mys- teries. After a time the Temples of Greece and the School of Pythagoras lost their reputatio n, and Freemasonry took their place. Masonry, when properly expounded, is at once the interpretation of the great book of nature, the recital of physical and astronom- ical phenomena, the purest philo sophy, and the place of deposit, where, as in a Treasury, are kept in safety all the great truths of the primitive revelation, that form the basis of all religions. In the modern Degrees three things are to be recognized: The image of primeval times, the tableau of the efficient causes of the Uni- verse, and the book in which are written the morality of all peo- ples, and the code by which they must govern themselves if they would be prosperous. The Kabalistic doctrine was long the religion of the Sage and the Savant; because, like Freemasonry, it incessantly tends toward spiritual perfection, and the fusion of the creeds and Na- tionalities of Mankind. In the eyes of the Kabalist, all men are his brothers; and their relative ignorance is, to him, but a reason for instructing them. There were illustrious Kabalists among the Egyptians and Greeks, whose doctrines the Orthodox Church has accepted; and among the Arabs were many, whose wisdom was not slighted by the Mediaeval Church. The Sages proudly wore the name of Kabalists. The Kabalah embodied a noble philosophy, pure, not mysterious, but symbolic. It taught the doctrine of the Unity of God, the art of knowing and explaining the essence and operations of the Supreme Being, of spiritual powers and natural forces, and of determining their action by symbolic figures; by the arrangement of the alphabet, MASONRY IS IDENTICAL TO THE ANCIENT MYSTERY RELIGIONS.

And wherever, in the higher Degrees, the two colors white and black, are in juxtaposition, the two Principles of Zoroaster and Manes are alluded to. With oth- ers the doctrine became a mystic Pantheism, descended from that of the Brahmins, and even pushed to an idolatry of Nature and hatred of every revealed dogma. [To all this the absurd reading of the established Church, tak- ing l i t e r a l l y the figurative, allegorical, and mythical language of a collection of Oriental books of di fferent ages, directly and inevi- tably led. The same result long after followed the folly of regard- ing the Hebrew books as if they had been written by the unimagi- native, hard, practical intellect of the England of James the First and the bigoted stolidity of Scottish Presbyterianism.] \"The better to succeed and win partisans, the Templars sympa- thized with regrets for dethroned creeds and encouraged the hopes of new worships, promising to all liberty of conscience and a new orthodoxy that should be the synthesis of all the persecuted creeds.\" [It is absurd to suppose that me n of intellect adored a monstrous idol called Baphomet, or recognized Mahomet as an inspired prophet.

The whole body of the Royal and Sacerdotal Art wa s hidden so carefully, centuries since, in the High Degrees, as that it is even yet impossible to solve many of the enigmas which they contain.

It had conceived a great work which it was incapable of executing, because it knew neither humility nor personal abnegation, because Rome was then invincible, and because the later Chiefs of the Order did not com- prehend its mission. Moreover, the Templars were in general uneducated, and capable only of wielding the sword, with no qual- ifications for governing, and at need enchaining, that queen of the world called Opinion.\" [The doctrines of the Chiefs would, if ex- pounded to the masses, have seemed to them the babblings of folly.

Yet, when it considers itself safe, it throws aside the garb of religion and reveals its true nature as a gigantic political organization, de- termined to crush individual liberty and freedom of thought, and by super- stition, ignorance, and fear, to bring all peoples into subjection to its tyran- nic will.

WHENCE AND WHITHER? By C. A. O PPENBORN , 32° The Masonic Order is held to be the greatest force of constructive initiative in existence HAT IS the impelling force that is drawing men in such large numbers to Freemas- onry? In an age of progressive en- deavor, bristling with inventive and scientific genius, focused continually on bringing to light something of material benefit to the human race; what is there about this great Brotherhood, which had its origin and won many of its laurels in the remotest times of antiquity, that it so universally appeals to men to- day? P OTENCY AND I NFLUENCE How came men to find the seed for the inestimable Institution of Free- masonry, and the inspiration to generate it to a practical fruition? What gave them the perspective that in its amelio- rating cement was to be found the ul- timate hope of the world ? What made them, when humanity was still wearing its swaddling clothes, provide the meas- ure for its beneficent bounty? At every hand we come in contact with the work- ings of the silent potency and expand- ing influence of its invigorating leaven. Everywhere we behold the magnificent edifices it has in the building, so that the imagination is taxed with wonder and admiration. With its origin wrapped in the pro- foundest secrecy, it should not surprise anyone that Freemasonry still is as much of an enigma to many of its initiates as it was in olden times. While the modern mind has become capable of penetrating some of the veils of its deepest mysteries, the fact that it not yet has fully come into the possession of the Grand Arcanum—how its philoso- phy laid hold on the human and in spite of strenuous persecution maintained an almost unbroken sway of perpetuity during the now silently slumbering ages—should encourage and stimulate in the initiate a thorough mastery of the truths of its scientific formula. W ISDOM TO B E G AINED While many students of Freemasonry pride themselves of being possessed of the secrets of their Brotherhood, the genuine adept is not so sanguine about having found the kernel of its funda- mental philosophy and still is groping for more Light. The true Mason feels that the Institution yet holds unlocked in its majestic bosom from mortal the key to the magnetic charm and suasion that has led so many to and is holding them in contentment at its Altars. The true Mason feels that, in accord- ance with its Ancien t Formula, Free- masonry only from time to time un- locks as it sees fit, from its storehouse of Wisdom, the Truths required for the human needs and not more of them than can be borne. He has an abiding assurance that its Great Founder never intended that mortality should see Free- masonry in the luster of its full splen- dor  and  glory.  Has Freemasonry, then, a spiritual conception only? __ Is its objective but the solidifying into a beautiful Utopia the wonderful Infinity of the First Cause and the kaleidoscopic finiteness of its mortal, human creatures? Is. its mis- sion solely directed to the establishment of the long-heralded and hoped-for Kingdom of the Brotherhood of Man? And has its Founder for these reasons but allowed the human occasional glimpses of some of the inner beauties that ever are sweeping it onward and upward; that ever are dazzling the physical vision from its distant snow- capped elevations; that ever is compel- 549 Masonry is the \"greatest force\" for what Masons see as good, & has more than just Utopia and brotherhood in store for mankind.

Masonry's greatness is not in the an- tiquity of its beginnings, neither in its conservatism, but rather in the fact that it has always been a leader of thought and action. Its members have been the world's pioneer corps, clearing away the dense growth of ignorance, bridging the turbid waters of superstition and fanaticism, blazing ways of enlightenment whereon the mighty army of humanity...might move to nobler achievements, to grander victories. The great leaders in Masonry as well as in the secular world have been men who, though clinging tenaciously to cer- tain great principles, were quick to see and take advantage of everything in the line of progress and development. Theirs was no blind conservatism holding fast to a dead past, but a glorious faith in the possibilities of the future, a faith, that, like the star in the East which led the Magi of old to the lowly birthplace of the Redeemer has led mankind un- der the leadership of many a Moses through the wilderness of pain and travail and bitter opposition into the bright light of twentieth century civili- zation. I repeat, a comprehensive understand- ing of the history of Masonry leads in- evitably to the conclusion that not through conservatism has it most served the world, but rather through its spirit of unrest, its utter abhorrence of un- necessary restraint, its abiding love for liberty, its unconquerable desire to pro- gress away from the old to the new and better conditions. Wherever the conflict has been waged between the old and the new, between a narrow conservatism and real progress, our Masonic brethren have been found on the right side, witness the members of St. Andrew's lodge of the Green , Dragon who threw the tea into Boston . harbor. We must not be content to abide in the glory of bygone days. There is need today of just such men as have made Masonry great in the past. We cannot rest on our laurels, but following in the footsteps of our sires we must make Masonry of the twentieth century as potent a factor for good as it has been in the centuries that have gone.— Ma- sonic Tidings. Antiquity Admitted a Century Ago. An old book published in London in the early part of the last century con- tains the following in regard to Free- masonry: \"This very ancient society is so called, either from some ex traordinary knowl- edge of Masonry, of which they are sup- posed to be masters, or because the first founders of this society were persons of this profession. They are now very con- siderable, both on account of their num- bers and the rank they hold in society, being found in every country in Europe, as well as North America; and they con- sist principally of persons of merit and consideration. They make no small pretentions to antiquity, for they claim a standing of some thousands of years. What the design of their institution is, seems still in some measure a secret. \"The members are said to be admitted into the fraternity by being put into pos- session of a great number of secrets, called the Mason's word, which have been religiously kept from age to age. In a treatise on Masonry, published in 1792, by William Preston, grand master of the Lodge of Antiquity, the origin of Masonry is traced from the creation.

One hears such suggestions in Edinboro, as well as in San Francisco; in Sydney, in London, as well as in New York. Are you unconsciously echoing their propaganda? The example of Jesus constitutes the very lif e of both these institutions. A Christian who took The Christ as his model founded the first \"Y.\" Remove the Christ spirit from the \"Y\" and it will soon degenerate into an institution ossified with materialism, officered by seekers for soft jobs. You suggest facilitating contacts among ma te-seeking young business folk. Do you know that the most successful San Francisco institution of this land is managed by a Protestant Christ- ian Church, that, as a product of its \"beau parlor s,\" as its girls call them, have come scores of happy marriages; that this institution, costing about a quarter of a million, was given to San Francisco business women devoutly by its donor, in the name of The Christ, to be administered by His Church? On the other nand, partly because of the lack of such mating facilities, as you wisely suggest, society has the problem of the unmarried mother s. Do you know that these in Northern Cali- fornia gravitate for protection to another institution, again founded by a Protestant Christian woman, and managed for many years by another, the daughter of a multimillionaire who, in Christ's name, left her life of luxury to care for these poor girls, continuing until she broke down from overwork?

In the process of transmuting the old form and so releasing the imprisoned life, there are two things which are steadily held in view by the Guides of our evolution: First, that the general public serves or is dominated by the concrete mind and is unable to grasp abstrac- tions. It is the form which matters to them the most, for they are conservative and cling to the familiar. The church is intended to serve the masses and is not in- tended to be of use (except as a field of service) to the esotericists of the world, for they heed not the form to the same extent, having contacted somewhat the inner compelling life. Secondly, the church movement, like all else, is but a temporary expedient and serves but as a transient resting place for the evolving life. Eventually, t h e r e w i l l appear the Church Universal, and its definite outlines will appear towards the close of this century. In this connection, forget not the wise prophecy of H.P.B. as touching events at the close of this century. This Church will be nurtured into activity by the Christ and His disciples when the outpouring of the Christ principle, the true second Coming, has been accomplished. No date for the advent do I set, but, the time will not be long. The Christian church in its many branches can serve as a St. John the Baptist, as a voice crying in the wilderness, and as a nucleus through whic h world illumination may be accomplished. I indicate the hope. I do not assert a fact. Its work is intended to be the holding of a broad platform. The church must show a wide tolerance, and teach no revolu- tionary doctrines or cling to any reactionary ideas.

THE PLAN TO BRING IN A ONE-WORLD-RELIGION Alice Bailey in her writings , especially the book The Externalisation of The Hierarchy quite openly spells out The Plan to bring in a New Age One World Religion. Alice Bailey needs no introduction to followers of the New Age Movement. Her 24 New Age books, her organization Lucis Trust (originally named Lucifer Trust), her Arcane School, and the Findhorn community in Scotland (started by h er disciples Peter and Eileen Caddy and Dorothy McLean) are present-day reminders of the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"immense impact she and her 32° Mason husba nd had on the New Age Movement. 1 She is credited with start ing over one hundred New Age groups. She worked for th e Dept. of Health, Ed ucation, and Welfare in 1958 setting up educational goals, and her writings were used in the new Globalism 2000 curiculum (already tried in some areas) and soon-to-be used across the board in the US public schools. Alice Bailey started the Arcane School to teach New Age disciples the principles of the Plan to br ing in the New Order. The Arcane School is located in Europe and America, and headquartered in New York City. A major part of this Plan is for mankind to recognize the Spiritual Hierarchy of the planet. This Spiritual Hierarchy is headed by the Spirit Being Sanat Kumera (the first name is a scrambling of the n ame Satan), and helped by the Great White Brotherhood. Her writings we re given to her by the same Great White Brotherhood that Masons, lik e Manly P. Hall (33°) , say direct Masonry. Other New Age leaders, for instance Elizabeth Clare Prophet in her book The Great White Brothe rhood in the Culture History and Religion of America, also believe the Great White Brotherhood has been controlling religion. Va rious Rosicrucians claim to be guided by the Great White B rotherhood too. 2 THE EXPECTATIONS FOR MASONRY BY NEW AGE LEADERS According to Alice Bailey, the Maso nic movement will be the religion of the New S ystem. Benjamin Creme, another big New Age leader, also believes Freemasonry with a revitalized Christian Church will be the religion of the New Age. 3 Lola Davis, another New Age leader, also sees Freemas onry as the New Age Religion ( Dark Secrets of the New Age, p. 273). Bailey wrote in 1957, \"The Masonic movement... is the custodian of the law; it is the home of the Myster ies and the seat of initiation. It holds in its symboli sm the ritual of Deity, and the way of salvation is pictorially preserved in its work. ... It is a far more occult organization than can be realised, and is intended to be th e training school fo r the coming advanced occultists. In its ceremonials lie hid the wielding of the forces connected with the gr owth and life of the kingdoms of nature and the unfoldment of the divine aspects in man.\" \"... when the new uni versal religion has s way and the nature of esotericism is understood-will be the utilisation of the banded esoteric organisms, the Masonic organism and the Church organism as initiating centres. T hese three groups con verge as their inner sanctuaries are approache d. There is no dissoc iation between the One Universal Church, the sacred inner Lodge of all true Masons, and the inner-most circles of esoteric societies.\" There the reader has it, the Universal Churches of the One- World-Religion such as the universa l churches of the Baha'i, the mysteries of the Masons, and the occult (esoteric societies) are not disunited.

We shall constitute the equilibrium of the Universe, and be rulers over the Masters of the World.\" (Morals and Dogma, p. 817, referring to the goal of esoteric groups.) For many this may be shocking . Why would Masonry be the religion of the New Order, a nd appoint its religious leaders (pontiffs) when it doesn't claim to be a religion? Freemasonry, the Church of Scien tology, the Watchtower Society (Jehovah's Witnesses), the Theosoph ical Society, the Maharishi's Transcendental Meditation He avenly Communities are all similar in that they strongly deny that they are reli gions. It is standard practice for many groups of the New World Order to protest to the public that they are not a religi on. Yet each of these groups repeatedly contradict that, by dec laring at other times that they are in fact a religion. Masonry not only functions as a religious institution, its leaders have quietly declared it is a religion. (See chapter 1.17 for proof on this.)

At least one Masonic author writing to Mas ons felt that Masonic religious power had be en underestimated. He writes, \"In the past Masonry has been condemned as a shallow substitute for religion. This the Masonic body has always denied but in fact the new a ge revitalised Ma sonry will be a paralleling evolutionary way of ma n's approach to God, and Masonry and religion will gladly cooperate.\" --The Spirit of Masonry, p. 129 O.K. We've seen that some of the most prominent leaders of the New Age movement plan for Freemas onry to be the future One-World- Religion. We've also seen a few (of the many quotes available) where Masons declare their desire for Masonry to be the creed of mankind. But can they do it? or is this ju st bravado and talk? How the Masons have done it is the subject of this book. Chapter 2.12 will examine specific sets of plans to bring in a New World Order with its One-World-Religion. Unit two will examine denomination by denominati on, sect after sect and expose how Masonry controls a vast diversit y of groups. The diversity is but only an appearance. Unfortunately, we have tended to look at the superficial outside, rather than the inside substance. This book may change your life in regards to that. Freemasonry is a front for the P ower, but it also is a major part of their power. To illustrate this point let us look at the manned- mission to the moon Apollo. We'll develop the story enough that the significance of the final point will be appreciated. THE SPACE RACE In 1960, Pres. John F. Kennedy tugged on the emotional heart strings of Americans, \"We are in a strategic space race with the Russians, and we have been losing ...But we cannot run second in this vital race.\" Ken nedy challenged the nation to land a man on. the moon by the end of the decade. And so America was rushed into a race to the moon. It seemed forgotten that the moon had been aro und for a long time, and would continue being there for a long time , even if man didn't get there by the end of the decade. U.S.-U.S.S.R. COOPERATION This Author is not go ing to try to document this next paragraph. To do so really is another book. But if the reader is aware of the US-USSR cooperation it clears up a long list of anomalies. The reader can do with it what he pleases, but what if this paragraph is true? First, . the interested person can learn about the U.S. technology that ou r leaders have q uietly given the Communists over the years, such as nuclear weapo ns by reading Anthony Sutton's well-documented b ooks.

One area of cooperation that is extensive and has been for many years is between the CIA and the KGB. Both of these agencies feud like siblings, and both are honeycombed with double-agents, triple-agents, Airier. Communist CIA agents, etc., it is rather impossible to develop a clear pic ture of where loyalties are of particular individuals. In fact, it may be harder to see the overall picture for those closest to the scene, because these agencies are so se gmented that people work in offices unaware that other secret offices ajoin their own rooms, and unaware of people working in secret only a few feet away. It is the epitome of Orwell's 1984. And the process is that Big Brother of the New World Order controls the world and works thr ough the MI6, MI5, the CIA, the KGB, and Moussad. However, th at is a hefty conc ept to swallow, so the reader is welcome to disbelieve it, and to put that on the back burner. It is o nly mentioned to serve as an introductory background thought to the next item. (The topic will be picked up again in chapter 2.7). THE SOVIETS PROVIDE HELP The Soviets gave the American leaders the reas on to go to the moon. The Soviets played the ir role well. Th ey continually gave mixed signals as to their intentions. For instance, on Oct. 15, 1968, Russia's top scientists denied Russia was interested in going to the moon. On Nov. 23, 1968 Tass declared that Zond 5 and 6 were test flights to precede a manned flight to the moon and back. Such statements greatly enhanced NASA's sal es pitch, that if we did not go to the moon, the Russians would. Thanks to the Russians, few people in the U.S. opposed the Apollo program. One day the Russians would deny interest and then the next day would come some statement like, \"The Soviet Union is preparing to launch its most spetacu lar manned space fli ght by dispatching shortly at least two, and probabl y three, men on a circumlunar flight,...\" Rocketry is a sophisti cated science. The U.S . leaders knew that the Russians were strappi ng several small roc kets together in a hazardess fashion, and t hat they were not far out in front of us technologically, but inferior. (How could they be ahead of us? We were supplying them w ith much of the techn ology, just as we had for years. The examples are en dless. One example is the chassis of the feared W.W.II T-34 Tank was American technology.) Going to the moon is such an invol ved process that it is not bel ievable that our intelligence agencies did not have a fix on where the Russian space program was. Either, the y did have a fix on it and our leaders lied, or, they didn't know much if anything about the Russian space program. Recently, the Russians have disp layed a craft they say they built to go to the moon. Only one model of it was built. However, building such a model, and actually having the technology to send men to the moon are two different items. (The Space Program actually serves purposes that are entirely different from its cover. That is material for another book.)"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Next, it is eye-opening, becau se supposedly according to our President, whoever got their flag a nd men to the moon first was to be considered the leader of mankind on earth. 53 "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"54 The point this Author is mak ing is simply that the Russian threat, which was blown out of prop ortion, helped NASA sell its space program to the public. Informed critics of the Apollo program tried to point out how on a scientific basis, unma nned spacecraft are far less expensive and will yield far more scientific information. A case in point, is the relatively inexpensive Surveyor spa cecraft series which took thousands of close up lunar pict ures and made soil analyses of the lunar soil. THE MEDIA COVERUP The media and NASA cooper ated to keep a lid on the public's awareness of the level of risk for the Apollo astronauts. Safety features and calls from NASA techni cians were ignored in order to meet self-imposed deadlines. Critic s claimed that the fatal accident of Apollo 204, could easily ha ve been avoided if safety concerns had been listened to. However, a Senate Committee on January 30, 1968 reported after the fatal Apollo 204 accident which killed three astronauts, that the end-of-the-decade \"Moon landing was necessary because the schedule is an ess ential and significant management tool.\" The critics of the Apollo program who railed about the terrible odds and lack of safe ty features were supp ressed, and are now silent because the Apollo program gambled against the odds and actually won. Critics had c laimed that the manned moon program was \"an arbitrary goal\" a nd that there was \"n o logical next step\" beyond landing men on the moon. They were correct in terms of the public-known space programs, yet the glory of the Apollo program and its success silences their reasoning. So wh y bring up their moot criticism? Because it is being established for the reader how much the manned space program, which took money away from possible unmanned programs, was actually motivated on the basis of national pride and not scientific research. The lives of many brave Amer ican astronauts were recklessly played with so that the world could marvel at Americans planting the American flag on the moon. But America wanted that glory. Some of the NASA scientists got antcy, because so much precious lunar time was spent on the first lunar mission, Apollo 11, just \"raising\" the flag. Th ey were more concerne d with learning scientific data than pomp and ceremony. Americans wouldn't trade that glory for mor e moon dust, or for more knowledge of the lunar surface. They were pr oud to get their flag to the moon first. It seems then that with so much hoopla and pride, with so many billions spent to achieve that great feat, with so much danger given to our brave astronauts that America would n ot want to share the glory of the moon landing. It would seem that it might be disconcerting to some A mericans to learn that the Masonic flag got to the lunar surface at the same time the American flag did. The Masons tied for first flag to the moon. Yes, taxpaying Americans spent billions of dollars to get the Scottish Rite's flag to the moon first. Most people I have menti oned this to have see n the significance of this. Then others say, \"So what if the Masons got their flag to"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"55 the moon first?\" Our President Ke nnedy answered that one. He said that whoever got their flag to the moon first was to be considered the leader of mankind on earth. There are other interesting aspects to this. How ironic it is that the organization that sponsored and got the first Communist Internationale going was given such a big privilege by a supposedly anti-communist U.S. sp ace program. Comm unism's sponsoring organization during the 1860 s was the Masonic Lodge. H.G. Wells, who has ties to F reemasonry, and was a Fabian Socialist, prophecied that men would land on the moon. Masons have held H.G. Wells up as a \"prophet\" in their of ficial Scottish Rite publication. The One-Worlders seemed to have a interest in insuring his forecast and plans would happen. H.G. Wells felt that the New Worl d Order would rule because it controlled the air and sea ways. Indeed today the y do dominate it completely. For instance, his book The Shape of Things To Come, on p. 11 advises us that \"...during the struggles and changes in world government that went on between 1980 and 2 059, at which date the Air Dictatorship, properly so called, gave place to that world-wide Modern State.\" He also calls the Air Dictatorship a different name \"the new World Council\". \"The new World Council, which is known also as the Air Dictatorship...\"(p. 348) In A Modern Utopia, p. 67, H.G. Wells tells us that this Air Dictatorship's Utopia will be \"Bacon's visi onary House of Saloman.\" And in the following pages he fo resees that some of this Utopia's methods will use Plato's thinking. The Air Dictatorship's air power was demonstated in the book The Shape of Things to Come and the film based on it, in the same manner that George Bush demonstated the New World Order's air power in Iraq. The parallels are interesting. Is it proper to call 33° Mason George Bush's New World Order an Air Dictatorship? •In 1991, when Iraqi Scud missiles were launched Air Force Space Command Defense Support Program missile-warning satellites provided stereo data on the Iraqi Scuds within seconds of their launches. 8 Within 12 0 seconds the u nderground facility in the Rocky Mountain, which is full of computers, had received the data and determined what to do. The commands would be relayed in seconds back to the Patriot missile crews in Saudi Arabia or Israel which then would figure the last minute tragetories and launch their Patriot missiles. 9 The reaction time would be in a matter of something like 6 minutes from the time the scuds were fired until the Patriots were launched. Is that air power? •The government admits that its spy-satellites can read license plates and newspapers from outerspace. When describing intelligence capabilities it usually understates its capabilities. Imaging satellites beam their intelligence down to the Air Force/CIA at Fort Belvoir, VA. In the future if the Air Dictatorship wants to turn its attention to control you, it could conceivably watch your house from space, and fol low you going out to your car, and track your car electronically.

Satellites have also been used in law enforcement in the United States. Is that not air power? Can't our New Wor ld Order today pro perly be called an Air Dictatorship? The significance that Bacon's House of Saloman (Solomon) is also describing this same World Order (this Air Dictatorship) will be seen as we examine some more about what the Masonic Lodge is and its history.

TWO BEGINNING ITEMS OF MASONRY ARE A STORY IN A NUTSHELL Two items tell much about the Freemaso ns by themselves. These two items occur before anyone becomes a Freemaso n. They tell a story in a nutshell. First a petition by each candidate is made in the standard form supplied by the Lod ge requesting \" ... that I may be initiated into the mysteries of Freemasonry ... \" It can be shown from many Masonic sources that the Mysteries of Fr eemasonry are the Mystery religions, and the initiation is an initiation into those mystery religions. Second, an oath on penalty of a gruesome death is made that the candidate will not reveal a ny of the secrets of Masonry and will deceive those on th e outside as to what go es on in the lodge. That this is carried out, can be easily shown by Masonic articles which discuss such deception. And if that were not enough proof, it is attested to by the testimony of men who quit practicing such Masonic deception. MASONRY REPEATEDLY CLAIMS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT TRINITY THAN CHRISTIANS. What is the Holy Trinity that early Masons talked about? Mackey in his History of Freemasonry & Concordant Orders, p.771 states, \"Masonry d oes ...not teach the 'Trinity in Unity' as Christians understand it; furthermore, it does not teach that T: G: A: 0: T: U: is Immanuel, the God with us , the Christ. Templary is called the Masonic Ch ristian Order, but mo dern Masonry is not Christian.\" DECEPTION The great pontiff of Masonry, Albert Pik e, has had his words on page 819 of Morals and Dogma often quoted. He states there that lower degree Masons are intentionally deceived and whoever tries to undeceive them will la bor in vain because t he first degrees are convinced they have the true explanations. As most people, including most Masons themselves do not know what the deep secrets of Masonry are, they are not in a position to know whether Masonry has any secrets.

Yet on the other hand, they must conceal their true face to the majority. By filtering t he candidates throu gh a series of degrees, the ones who will serve Luciferia n (Satanic) goals can be identified. Those who control power over the world benefit from the general population 's reluctance to admit the possibility of ugly realities. The general method of t hinking is to attribute to these men motivations common to the common man, such as fair play, national interests, human de cency, and honesty. Perhaps the best book on the mind-set of those who secretly rule the world is Lindsey Williams' Syndrom of Control. Lindsey Williams, who rubbed shoulders with some of these men, studies ho w the mind-set of power is in a different realm than the common person. Think power, control, and money. Think of men who believe they are special, and that destiny has called them to Lord it over the world. The Christians are manipulated to fight each other. The various nations pre tend to feud with each other, concealing the fact they are puppets on strings with the same Master. The democrats and republicans feud wi th each other, wh en the real power has nothing to do with their pre tended power strug gles. Many straw-monsters are created, and pretended power struggles, and senseless conflicts, simply to mask the steady growth of the one-world-power. This strategy is taught in military colleges as Divide and Conquer. Our self-deception is one of the One-World-Powers best allies. MANY REFUSE TO ADMIT MASONIC DECEPTION When the profane non-Masonic world uncove rs some Masonic ritual, or Masonic act, then the uncovering is taken as proof that there was no deception. \"Why [suppo sedly] was there no deception? Because the world was able to uncover thi ngs.\" Obviously such thinking believes we are onl y deceived when we are unaware that we have been deceived. This thinking can be summed up, We have never found anything that the Masons ha ve successfully covered up. And because we have been able to di scover things, then there must not have been a serious attempt to hide things."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"HOW EASY IT IS TO DECEIVE Our self-deception is one of the Power's best allies. The truth simply needs to be suppressed, and fictions embellished somewhat to fool most people. For instance, suppress the actual figures of how many Masons are in government positions, and embellish ficti ons of how many anti or no n-Masons are in government. Masonic statements to such effect don't mention how those non-Masons allowed in government still fit into their plans and power structure. Grand Orient Mason s are not on the rolls of American Lodges, a lthough they are Masons. Masons pretend to the public that those Ame ricans with only Europe an lodge memberships are not Masons. Further, a man bought off by the Masons is just as much theirs as one who is a membe r but they can say he is not a Mason. Or again, suppress the actual figures of Jewish involvement in the Masons, and stress the fic tion of anti-Jewish lodges. Or again, suppress the actu al figures of Jewish Masonic involvement with Communism, and stress the fict ion of anti-Semitism in Russia. The show case propog anda in communist cou ntries of anti-semitism works well to hide the overwhelming figures of Jews within the communist power structure. Still, this Author's experience is that ma ny Christians would rather listen to men who have repeat edly sworn to deceive than to read what the Masons ac tually teach. Wh y? It is discomforting to them to disturb their secure feeling in this present system. They don't want to learn that their prese nt system is an elab orate myth, concealing and insulating the world power from anything that might oppose it. The Mason Rev. Dr. William Dodd in a spe ech to brother Masons to open a new Masonic t emple in 1794 traced Freemasonry from \"the first astronomers on the plains of Chaldea, the wise and mystic kings and priests of Egypt, the sage s of Greece and philosophers of Rome.\" Whether or not this would be historically correct if one looks from 1794 backward in Masoni c history, it clearly shows that even in 1794 the Freemasons did desire to identify themselves with the Mystery Religions of the ancient pagans. Let us examine o ne Masonic deception- that their organization was or is Christian.(See chapter 1.17 for more on Masonic deception.) Recently, E piscopalian theologian Dr. Morey wrote a book declaring Freemasonry's origin and early history to be Christian. Today, Masons are still leading people to believe it is a Christian institute. Morey's book h as been in Christian book stores. According to Mo rey, his book is popular with Masons, and is to be advertised in a Masonic magazine. This Episcopalian Theologian with Masonic friends, says that his permission to visit the best Masonic library was becaus e the Masons were blinded just like when Brother Andrew went into Communist countries. He says they never once asked in weeks of his research who he was. Indeed, they opened up locked documents and made suggestions as to what he could see. 11 This Author and others have repeatedly been told by official representativ es of the Scottish Rite that no-one except Masons with special permission are allowed to use such libraries. This Author and others know that they do ask who people are. They don't just allow anyone in.

The reader can draw his own conclusions, but it is the opinion of this Author that it is highly possible the grossly misleading research of Morey's book, was a setup, aided by his Ma sonic friends who asked their library to play dumb, break the rules, and assist (guide) this research. There are other suspicious items about the book, but it will take time to follow them up. THIS BOOK'S MESSAGE- AMAZING BUT TRUE Yes, I agree Be Wise As Serpents conclusions sound outrageous AT FIRST.

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE VARIOUS GROUPS It is true that there are several centers of power upon the earth. However, these groups have made al liances and together create the New World Order. A One-World-Government already exists. Even though the world is ruled by a secret world government, the world has not willingly consented to this. H.G. Wells, who spent his life planning how this One-World-State would come into power and function, f ully expected today's situation in his timetable, \"The World Council was in effective possession of world power, but not in unc hallenged possession. Even in 2000 C.E., nineteen-twentieths of mankind were still unassimilated to the organization. If the world was not rebellious it was mutinous, and there were plenty of alert and intelligent people in opposition, ... to the reconditioning of human affairs on Modern State lines. \" 12 The reader is familiar with how two royal blood lines can be joined by marriage, to produce a new royal blood line containing both lineages. This principle has been used a great deal in creating the unified One-Wo rld-Government of today. The Black Nobility is a group of nobility that traces back to the Roman Emporers. Many of the royality of Europe belong to the Black Nobility. The Knights of Malta are one of the Black Nobility's secret orders. The Orde r of the Knights of Malta helps continue the cohesion of the Nobili ty as a group. This Black Nobility have formed an alliance with two major groups, the Jewish blood line of the House of David, and the group of International Bankers who are practicing Satanism. The merging of these three groups has created a unity called t he New World Order. A host of other organizations are built upon this nucleus. Freemasonry is one of the fundamental ones. The Jewish blood line (co nsidered to be not only the House of David but to contain the Royal blood line of Je sus) has been preserved by the secret ord er the Prieure de Sion. The Satanists have been actively working through groups that are illuminized. There are groups are called the Illuminati. There"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"are also individuals (usually at the head of gnostic religious groups--see chapter 1. 3) who are Illuminati. One main Rosicrucian group is called the Church of Illumination. The three groups- the Black Nobility, the Satanists, and the claimed Blood Line of Jesus- have an outer gr oup of about 500 men who assemble once a year. This group is nicknamed the Bilderbergers. Altho ugh the heads of some of the largest newspapers attend, and their meetings are news worthy, the media do not cover their supersecret meetings. (More about the Bilderbergers in chapter 2.12.) The center of power geographica lly recides in Great Britian. 13 That does not mean New York, Zurich, Rome, Paris and Moscow, etc. aren't important. Thes e cities also are cen ters of their power. Through a vast number of org anizations the world has been brought under their contr ol. Some of their organizations like the Boy Scouts or the Or der of the Antelope 14 play little part in the control of humankind and their construction of a one-world- religion. While others like the Ord er of the B'nai B'rith and the Order of the Skull and Bones play major roles. The One-World-Power has used and is using foreign cults and secret societies that Americans rarely hear about like the Hung and Triad secret societies in China, and the Tenri Kenjukai in Japan. As a reference to help the r eader get started a list of some major groups is now prov ided. (This author ha s files on hundreds of organizations and sect s. The number of reli gous groups and secret fraternal organizations, and New Age organizations started by the One-world-power is simply fantastic. See chapter 2.9. for a chart showing some.) SECRET & SEMI-SECRET ORDERS OF THE ILL UMINATI KNOWN ABOUT the Order of B'nai B'rith- Although its strictly Jewish membership is not secret anymore, the inner workings at the top are. It's purpose is to organize, unify, and direct the Jewish people. It also directs Christian clergymen and Freemasons at times. Its militant arm is the JDL and ADL. It also has Hillel and some other all-Jewish organizati ons included in its m embership. Although it claims to represent all jews, it has promoted the liberal \"Reformed\" Jewish mov ement. The Order has around 500,000 members and 3,500 local lodges. the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn- An illuminated Satanic group that worked with the German Thule Socie ty, related to the O.T.O. Reportedly directed by the Rothschi ld family. (See chapter 3.3) This was a branch of t he Masonic Societas Rosi cruciana in Anglia. Many groups developed from the Golden Dawn including Stella Matutina (Morning Star). The Morning Star is Lucifer. 63"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"64 Grand Council of Allied Masonic Degrees (AMDGC)- The council controls the various allied degrees. It works fourteen degrees: Royal Ark Mariner, Secret Monitor, Knight of Constantinople, Grand Tyler of Solomon, Red Branch of Eri, Ye Ancient Order of Corks, and other degrees. It's subordinate groups are called councils. Grand Orient- This is a type of Masonry which is almost global, but based in Europe. It is blatantly occultic, and sponsors revolutions. It ma intains strong ties with all the other branches of Masonry incl. British Masonry. T he French Grand Orient is the mother lodge directing other G.O. in other count ries. Funds for the assassination of the Archduke in 1914 tr avelled from Paris to Rome between the Grand Orients on behalf of the Alliance Israelite Universelle. 15 the Group- Based at Oxford U niversity, this group's initiates form part of the Illuminati's British elite. Jason Society- A branch of the Order of the Quest, this secret group is extremely po werful in the United Stat es. Some of its men sit on MJ-12, the body that rules the United States for the New World Order. Jesuits, the Socie ty of Jesus- This is the Catholic branch of the Illuminati. Black masses are performed at the higher levels. Only the higher echelons ar e aware of the Ill uminati contacts. There are about 28,000 Jesuits worldwide. The y have been primary agents to change Christianity into Marxism through Liberation Theology. Knights of Malta- This order preserves the cohesion of the \"Black\" nobility, the Europea n aristocracy that do minated Europe for many centuries, the head family traces itself back to the Roman emperors. Not all Knights of Malta members have connections to the Black nobility though, only about half of the 1 0,000 members are Black nobility. (Another Black nobility group in Europe is the Club of Rome with a small select group of about 75.) Typically, U.S. Govt.envoys to the Vatic an are Knights of Malta. Mizraim Rite (of Freemasonry) and the Prieure de Sion (Priory of Zion)- These two closely related groups are guarding the lineage of a future messiah to rule the world. The Mizraim Rite is almost exclusively jwish. Th e Prieure de Sion is p rimarily in Scotland, Britian, U.S., Canada, and Fr ance. France has about 43 members, of the 9,731 members. The Prieure de Sion is divi ded into the Legion (charged with the Apostolate) and t he Phalange (charged with the guardian of the tradition.) The Prieure de Sion has nine levels of initiation. Palladium Rite- A secret rite that extends globally. This super- rite is sold out to Lucifer and controls Freemasonry behind the scenes. Both men and women are members. Its tria ngles (lodges) are in the major cities."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Independent Order of Oddf ellows- This group is designed for the lower classes and minorities. Because its members are not often in powerful positions, it functions less as a powerhouse fraternity than does Freemasonry, but places more emphasis on the occult for the lower levels. Order of the Quest- Th is is the group in char ge of preserving their plan for world domination . (The name used here for this order is the one Manly P. Hall used for it, it -- like other gr oups-- most likely it has an esoteric name also.) Several groups mentioned in this list play important roles f or the Order of the Quest. Scroll & Key Fraternity- Based at Yale, this is a secondary group which also provides some leaders hip for the Illumi nati along with Wolf's Head. Skull & Bones Order (Russell Trust)- B ased at Yale, this group is one source of American leadership. It is part of the larger \"Brotherhood of Death.\" Exactly 15 members are added each year. (Previous to 1860 the number ini tiated varied.) Ther e are about 600 active members currently. In the last 150 years about 2500 Yale graduates have been initiated in to this super-secret society. Some members, perhaps excep tions, have been initiated away from Yale. Most are descended from the early Puritan fami lies, and are tied to the Unitarian/Universalist movem ent. These older S&B families have formed blood alliances with wealthy families such as the Rockefellers. (See Chapter 2.3) Thule Society- Based in Germany, this group was the primary German Illuminati group prior to W.W. II. This Societ y recruited German leaders including Adolf Hitler who they placed in charge of their Nazi party. Their symb ol was the swastika, which was then also used by their daughter o rganization the Na zi party. Satu rn was an important god, so t heir lodges met on Sa turday. It was associated with the Prussian Freemas onic Lodges which were opposed to the western or Jewish Masonic lodges.

THE PRIEURE DE SION PLAYED AN IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE EARLY MASONIC LODGE SYSTEM The St. Clair Charters of 1601 and 1628 are interesting. William St. Clair, who was part of the Prieure de Sion, and a d escendent of the St. Clairs of Roslin was given the right to govern the Masons. [FIG. 6 Charles Radcliffe Pasteup 3.25 x 2.5] HOW THE PRIEURE DE SION STARTED THE SCOTTISH RITE Charles Radclyffe was the Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion from 1727-1746. 16 \"It is probable that Scottish Rite Freemasonry was originally promulgated, if not indeed devised, by Charles Radclyffe.\" 17 It seems also most likely that Charles Radclyffe was one of the \"unknown superior s\" (likely the head one) of a German nobleman Baron Karl Gottheif von Hund 18 (1722-1776) who is well known to have created the Rite of S trict Observance. 19 According to von Hund a Grand Master of a super secre t order authorized him to start the Rite of Strict Observance. The Rite of Strict Observance entered France in 17 58 under the name of Council of the Emperiors of the East and West, and three years later authorized Stephen Morin to take the rite to t he four corners of the earth. 20 With his Charter of Authority Mor in went to Jamaica where he initiated the Jew Moses M. Hayes. Hays went to Charlesto n, SC. The Rite that Hays established had only the 25 degrees that Von Hund had offered. 21 The Rite of Perfection is now known as the Scottish Rite, and in around 1802 the authorizati on was given to all ow Masons to progress in eight more degrees. 22 Another early branch of the Rite of Perfection had 32 degrees, and th is contradiction was eventually worked out. The result is that Sc ottish Freemasonry has 32 degrees for most worthy Masons to achieve, with 33 s pecial men chosen to an advanced 33 degree.

The upper grades of the Scottish Rite are the lower degrees of the Prieure de Sion, accordin g to M. Jean-Luc Chaumeil, a man who had contact with the G rand Master of the Prieure de Sion and was familiar wi th that Society. 23 Also according to Jean-Luc Chaumeil, whose kno wledge of the Prieure de Sion is obviously of merit and worthy of attention, the Prieure de Sion is generally Jewish but a few non-Jew ish members are admitted. 24 Why would a man like Chaumeil leak information about this powerful Jewish soc iety which is cl aimed to guard the holy blood lineage of King David and Jesus Christ? Be cause the time is close when the most powerfu l \"Jews\" in the world plan to reestablish a King-Priest to rule the world. People must be given a chance to believe in this purported blood descendent of Jesus Christ. In order to legitimatiz e their story, the y have orchestrated a complex series of \"leaks\", which has revealed the existence of their Order and its antiquity. Whether their story line that they have guarded the royal blood line is true or not, it has enough truth in it to fool most people. It is and will be one of the best orchestrated hoaxes of histor y. By uniting both the Christians and Jews behind this Messiah, they can rule the world with the religious blessings of the masses. Now the reader begins to see the significance, that the present day Pope is Jewish, a Freemason, and working with the Prieure de Sion. 25 [FIG. 7 picture of square and compass becoming the seal of solomon PASTEUP 1.6 x 5] [FIG. 8 charter] THE TOP OF THIS MASO NIC CHARTER SHOWS TH E SEAL OF SOLO MON HIDDEN IN THE SQUARE & COMPASS.

The various orders of Freemasonry also re late to the lineage of the House of David. For instance we learn from 33° Mackey, \"So that now almost all the symbolism of Freemasonry rests upon or is derived from the \"House of the Lord\" at Jerusalem. So closely are the two connected, that to attempt to sep arate the one from th e other would be fatal to the further exi stence of Masonry.

It is a theme rep eatedly pushed in the Masonic temples. An example of this is the Scottish Rite article by 33° Mason Charles L. Bachtel entitled \"Where Is Ki ng Solomon's Temple\". \"Until the arrival of the day when the Temple is located and reconstructed for the use of all mankind, we should carry the symbol of the Temple in our hearts.\" 28 [FIGURE 9 Picture of the interior of a Royal Arch Lodge showing the banners of the 12 tribes of Israel, SCAN 7 x 6.5.] 73"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"74 PHOTO OF THE INSIDE OF A ROYAL ARCH LODGE WITH THE BANNERS OF THE 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL JEWISH PARTICIPATION WITHIN THE EARLY MASONIC LODGE Because there has been such a powerful coverup of the role Jews have played in Freemasonry, this su bject must be dealt with. The Reformed Rabbi Gotthold Saloman wrote that Fre emasonry was more a Jewish movement in origin than Christian. However , as is so often the case today, Jews can say things about themselves which if Gentiles, the Goy, say the same thi ng, then the non-Jews are in serious trouble. The initial formation by four Masonic lodg es in 1717 of the first public Grand Lodge, included several Jewish Masons as participants. These were Mar ranos Jews (Jews converted to Christianity) and included Mendez, de Medina, Alvarez, and Baruch. 29 In other words, Je ws were there from th e start. A look at the seals of the various Mas onic groups in England in the 18th century reveals a Jewish or magical influence. (See illustrations of early Masonic seals with the Star of David, etc.) [FIGURE 10 Seals of the early Grand Lodges to be here -PASTE UP 3 disks of 2\" diameter side by side.] Many books, including Morey's rec ent one, portray the American lodges as anti-Jewish. This is a smokescreen. The only Grand Lodge that was really anti-Jewish was the Prussian Grand Lodge which eventually transformed itself into the Thule Soci ety and then into the Nazi Party. The reason tha t the Prussian Lodges became concerned in the early 19 th century about Jewish control of Freemasonry could be a book in itself, but was based on several items, 1. being close to the several radical Jewish movements in Poland and the German States the Ge rmans were more aware of what was taking place, 2. in Germany warnings were given by ex-Masons and Masons, 3.

A close examination by reliable Masonic, Jewish, and other sources reveals that the Jews have indee d played an important part in the Masonic lodges since their be ginning. A person today will witness for instance such things as the Feast of Tishri observed by for instance the Arkansas Lodge of Perfection. 30 SECRET DENS OF ANTI-CHRISTIANITY The first early lodges in the various European nations of Scotland, England, German states, and France bu ilt upon a number of existing organizations. Various se cret societies were built upon. Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to explain Masonry's early history, it will be found in the Knight's Templar groups, in the secret societies of Europe and the Middle East (including the Order called Roshaniya, the Assassins, & Sufism), the Rosicrucians, the Prieure de Sion, the Mystery Religions (including the evolution of the Mazdains to Mithraism to Manicheanism to Freemasonry), witchcraft, and Platonic humanists and philosophers. Not only were the Masonic Rites formed from the early secret societies, but the secrecy of th e Lodges encouraged and provided a forum for men of all types of anti-Christian persuasions, including - but not limited - to the J ews. John Robison, a Mason and a leading intellect of his day, ex posed the conspiracy of Illuminized Masonry to take over the world and destroy Christianity in 1789. After decades of working closely with these men and listening to them in the Lodges he writes about the activities of these men, \"...although in direct opposition to a standing rule, and a declaration made to every newly received Brother, 'that nothing touching the religion or government shal l ever be spoken of in the Lodge.' But the Lodges in other countries quickly followed the example of France, and have frequently become the rendezvous of innovators in religion and politics , and other disturbers of the public peace. In short, I have foun d that the covert of a Mason Lodge had been employed in eve ry country for venting and propagating sentiments in re ligion and politics, that could not have been circulated in public without exposing the author to great danger. I found, that this i mpunity [freedom due to Masonry's secrecy] had gradually encouraged men of licentious principles to become more bold, and to teach doctrines subversive of all our notions of morality...\" 31 \"...under the p rotection of Masonic secrecy, they planned schemes... they formed associations in opposition to the... superstitions of the church....The church dreaded the consequences, and ende avored to suppress the Lodges. But in vain.... the rigours of the church only seved to knit the Brethren [Masonic Brethren] more fi rmly together...The Lodges became schools of skepticism and infidelity, and the spirit of conversion or proselytism [to spread M asonic Dogma] grew every day stronger. \" 32 Robison found in his attendence of Masonic meetings that even some of the Church offic ials like the Prince Bishop of Liege at the 75"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"76 Loge de la Parfaite Intelligence mocked and attacked the church in his talks given at the Masonic Lo dge and this wh ile many of the other Lodge members were dignitari es in the church. 33 This type of thing is still continueing. Today some of the most important \"Christian\" ministers who are Masons have only contempt for Christianity once they have the Lodge's secrecy to talk. The Standard Jewish Encyclopedia states, \"Early European Jewish settlers in the U.S. were amongst the most en thusiastic masons and the...first lodge in Newport, R.I.. ..[was established by them]\". 34 Indeed, the St. John's Lodge of Newport was one of the first lodges in the colonies. 35 Charlestown, S.C. bec ame a \"capital\" or a ner ve center of Freemasonry for a number of reason s. The city of Charlestown, S.C. had the largest Jewish population of any U.S. city in 1800. 36 It was also an early strong point for the Unitarian church whose congregation originated in Charlestown in 1772. 37 Further, Charlestown was a cosm opolitan commercial cent er with strong French ties. (The Rite of Perfection came from France to Charlestown via the West Indies.) 38 The Scottish Rite's Sublime Grand Lodge of Perfection was created in Charlestown in 1783. Also the Order of Palladium (the Palladium Rite) had been started soon after 173 0 in Charlestown. 39 (The significance of this la st point will been seen later.) One of the original founders of the Mother Supreme Council, Scottish Rite, at Charleston, S.C. was Abraham Alexander. Abraham Alexander was the chazan (reader) for the Bayh Elohim Jewish Congregation, 40 and later a Rabbi. 41 Another Jew involved in founding the Scottish Rite at Charleston was Moses C. Levy. He was a man of great l earning who became the president of the Bayh Elohim congregation. 42 The Inspector General appointed by the Grand Consistory of Princes of the Royal Secret to ov ersee Masonry in the British colonies in the New World was Stephen Morin, a Jew. Morin was joined by the Jewish Mason Moses M. Hays in Jamaica. Moses M. Hayes established the Sublime Lodge of Perfectio n in Boston, Mass. 43 The Jewish Mason Abraham Da Costa worked with Morin to establish Masonry in Charleston, S.C. 44 They set up the King Solomon Lodge. Morin forged Frederick the Great's signature on his Masonic documents to gain credibility. Another Jewish Mason, Isaac Dacosta, in 1758 working with Moses M. Hayes established the St. Andrew Lodge in Boston, and helped out in S. Car. Dacosta helped establish the Charleston Lodge of Perfection, and served as one of its Grand Masters. Joseph M. Meyers, another Jewish Mason was his successor. 45 The Jew Moses Cohen, who was originally initiated into Masonry in Philadelphia, was one of the first members of the Mother Lodge in Charleston. From the two mother lodges in Boston and Charleston, S.C. came many of the Scott ish Rite lodges. 46 Charleston, S.C. would also be known as the cradle of Refor med Judaism. Inter estingly, the Jew Isaac Harby who fathered Reformed Judaism in Charleston is called \"Pallas Athena\" in the Jewis h author Max Dimont's book The Jews in America, (Simon & Schuster, 1978), p. 93. The significance of this will be discussed soon."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"And Charleston, S.C. w ould be the place th e Civil War conflict began. Mason Brig.

A quick overview of the eleven f ounders of the S upreme Council 33rd degree of t he Scottish Rite: Rabbi Abraham Alexander (33°)-Jewish Emanuel De La Motta (33°)-Jewish Israel De Lieben (33°)-Jewish Moses Levy (33°)-Jewish Dr. Isaac Auld (33°)-Presbyterian Dr. Frederick Dalcho (33°)-Episcopalian Dr. James Moultrie (33°)-Scot who studied at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland de Grasse (33°)-French aristocrat active with Grand Orient Masonry Jean B. Delaho gue (33°)-Frenchman Mitchell & Bowen (both 33°) -t wo men born in Ireland. 49 Hezekiah Levy, a Jewish Mason, was one of the earliest members of the Fredericksburg Lodge No. 4 to which President George Washington would join. 50 Jews played prominant ro les in the lodges in America and Europe. For instance, the English Grand Lod ge's Coat of Arms was designed by Jewish Mason J.J. Leon Templo. 51 In 1717, when Anderson's Constitution began to be drawn up, the Constitution not only included parts of Egyptian and Pythagorian thought, but also included the two pi llars Jachin and Boaz w hich derive from Jewish Rabbinical tradition con cerning Solomon's temple. The German Jewish Mason Moses Mendelsohn (1729-1796) was a friend of the Mason philosopher Kant and was himself a very famous philosopher. He has been called the \"German Socrates.\" He wrote a metaphysical book Abhandlung uber die Evidenz in den Metaphysichen Wissenschaften. 52 Another Jewish Mason, Karl L. Reinhold, was also a philosopher and friend of Kant. He published Letters on the Philosophy of Kant, and the book The Hebrew Mysteries or the Oldest Religious Freemasonry . This later book explains that Moses got his religious system from the Egypti ans, and that Free masonry derives from that lineage. Remember, that Moses practiced magic. 53 77"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"78 L IST OF O FFICERS E LECTBD BY THE R OYAL L ODGE OF THE COMMANDERS OF THB T EMPLE , FOR THE O RIENT OF C ABCASSONE , to direct the labors from the 24th day of the fourth month of the year of G: L: 5785 to the same day of the year 5786."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"79 Many of the Lectures of the Sublime degrees cont ain an epiteme of the arts and sciences, and in their hisory many valuable and important fact s are recorded, obtained from authentic archives in the possession of our society, and which, from the manner of their communication can never be mutilated or corrupted. This is an object of the first magnitude in a society whose princi- ples and practices should be inva riable? Much variety and irregu larity has unfortunately crept into the Blue degrees, in consequence of the want of Masonic knowledge in many of those who, preside over their meetings, and it is particularly so with those, who ar e unacquainted with the Hebrew language, in which all the Words and Pass- Words are given. So essentially necessary is it for a man of science to preside overs Lodges that much injury may arise from the smallest de- viation in the ceremony of initition, or in the L ectures of instruction. We read in the book of Judges, that the transposition of a single point over the Sbeez; in c onfequence of a national, defect among the Epharimites designated the Cowans, a nd led to the slaughter of forty-two thousand. The Sublime figure of the Divinity formed in the Fellow-Crafts degree, can be elegantly illustrat- ed, only by those who possess some knowledge of the Talmud. Most of the Words in the Sublime degrees are derived from the Chaldean Hebrew and Latin languages. The various tranflations which the Symbolic degr ees have undergone since their first establish- ment, from one language to another, and that; of tentimes by men illiterate even in their mother tongue, is another cause of the va riety which we lament. Not so the superior degrees, they ap- pear in that Sublime dress which their founders gave them; skilled in science and embellished by genius. Many of the Sublime degrees are f ounded on the polite arts, and unfold a mass of information of the first importance to Masons. Although many of the Sublime degrees are in fact , a continuation of the Blue degrees, yet there is no interference between the two bodies . Throughout the continent of Europe, and the West-Indies, where they are very generally known, they are acknowledged and encouraged. The Sublime Masons never initiate any into the bl ue degrees, without a legal warrant obtained for that purpose from a Symbolic Grand Lodge; but they communicate the secrets of the Chair to such appllicants, who have not already received it , previous to their initiation into the Sublime Lodge, but they are, at the same time informed, that it does not give them rank as Past Masters in the Grand Lodge. The Sublime Grand Lodge, sometimes called the Inessable Lodge or the Lodge of Perfection extends from the 4th to the 14th degree inclusiv e which last is the degree of Perfection. 16th degree is the Grand Council of Princes of Jerusalem, who hold jurisdiction over the 15th degree, called Knights of the East , and also over the Sublime Gra nd Lodge, and is to them, what a Symbolic Grand Lodge is to the subordinate Lodges. Without a warrant and Constitution re- gularly issued by them, or by an higher Council of Inspector, they are deemed irregular and are punished accordingly. All the de grees above the 16th are under the jurisdiction of the supreme Cou n c i l of Grand Inspectors General, who are Sovere igns of Masonry. When it is necessary to establish the Sublime degrees in a Country wher e they are unknown, a Brother of the 29th degree, vhich is called K. H. is appointed Deputy Inspec tor General, over the dist rict. He selects from among the Craft such Brethren as he believes will do honor to the foci ety, and communicates the Sublime degrees to as many as is necessary for the first organization of the Lodge, when they elect their own officers, and govern themselves by the Constitution, and warrant which is furnish- ed them. The jurisdiction of a Lodg e of Perfection, is twenty-five Leagues. It is well known that about 27,000 Masons accompanie d the the Christian Princes in the Crusades, to recover the Holy land from the Infidels. While in Palestine, they discovered several impor- tant Masonic manuscripts, among; the descendant s of the ancient Jews, which enriched our Ar- chives with authentic written records, a nd on which, some of our degrees are founded. In the years 5304 and 5311, some very exraordina ry discoveries were made, and occurrences took place, which renders the Masonic History of th at period, of the highest importance.

Franklin's life was surrounded by Freemasons. Franklin's role in the establishment and promotion of Freemasonry is overwhelming. His role in the destru ction of Christianity is quite unknown. Franklin's career as a Freem ason is shrouded in mystery. This Author has in his library the somewhat rare book Benjamin Franklin as a Freemason by Julius Sachse (J.F. Sachse is the last of a line of Sachses in the World Order.) This leading Masonic scholar writes, \"To write the history of Franklin as a Freemason is virtually to chronicle the early Ma sonic history of America....A great difficulty, h owever, here c onfronts us, n otwithstanding the prominence of FRANKLIN in Pennslyvannia Freemasonry; strange as it appears, he does not mention a word of his Ma sonic connections or career in his Autobiography, or in any of his correspondence, with but two exceptions, so far as known. This omission is the more remarkable when we look at his Masonic career while in France during the later years of his life. There, his activity and intimacy with the Brethren was intimate and close, both personal and official, FRANKLIN taking an active part in their proceedings, even advancing to the so-called high er degrees.\" 56 In spite of all his many duties, Benjamin Franklin was \"never absent from a [Masonic] meeting.\" 57 The Masonic Lodge played such a big role in Franklin's life, and yet Franklin never even hints about Freemasonry in his autobiography. The editor of his autobiography points out that Franklin tried to portray an unr eal persona in his autobiography, but one that Franklin felt people would want to emulate. 58 If Masonry is so virtuous, one wonders why it plays no role in his autobiography which was written on purpose to create an image worthy of emulation. Benjamin Franklin was the founder of the American Philosophical Society. 59 He was also a Rosicrucian. 60 In Feb. 1730, it appears he was initiated into St. John's Lodge of Philadelphia. 61 And in 1727, he started the secret revolutionary political society called the Leather Apron Club which changed its name in 1731 to Junto, and took on the appearance of being a literary society. 62 The same year that this \"literary\" society changed its name, the St. John's Masonic Lodge that Franklin be longed to got in touch with the Grand Lodge of London whose Grand Master the Duke of Norfolk appointed Daniel Coxe. Daniel Coxe advised the Masons when he arrived of a plan for the federati on of the colonies. 63 In 1754, while deputy Grand Master, Franklin unveiled at Alban y, NY to his brother Masons his plan to unite all the co lonies under o ne government. 64 Albany was the site of one the earliest Scottish Rite's Lodge of Perfection. Between Jan 21, 1769 and Jan. 2 1, 1772 a series of inflamatory letters called The Letters of Junius, which were written in England, were circulated through out the American colonies. The letters advanced those c auses that the colonis ts would declare to be the causes of their revolution, human rights, freedom of the press, and taxation w ithout representat ion. The lette rs were read by Franklin and many of the Masons who initiated the American Revolution. The man who wrote these letters acco rding to his niece, 81"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"82 was the Reverend James Wilmot (1726-1808) a Mason and rector of Barton-on-the-Heath, in Warwickshire in 1785. He also was the first person to publicly name Bacon as the author of Shakespeare's works. 65 He also apparently was in c ontact with the Lod ge of Nine Sisters in France that Frank lin would join in 1777. 66 \"Historians have never ceased to wonder at the enormous psychological influence which Franklin exercised in colonial politics. But up to the present day, few indeed are those who have realized that the source of his power lay in the secret societies to which he belonged and which he was the appointed spokesman.\" 67 Independence Hall which becam e the famous center of the Revolution was built by the Masons. It is believ ed by some that the Mason Benjamin Fran klin layed its cornerstone, others say it was another Freemason instead. (For more on the American Revolution, the Masons, and what the history books are lacking see chapter 3.4) BENJAMIN FRANKLIN & RELIGION Some of Franklin's Masonic brothers in France were impressed by the rituals, etc. that he thought up for a new religion. Turning our attention to a differe nt aspect of Franklin's, in a statement of beliefs Franklin states, \"I c onceive then, that the INFINITE has created many beings or Gods... It may be that these created Gods are immortal; or it may be that after many Ages, they are changed, and others Supply their Places.\" 68 Not only were Frankl in's beliefs not Christ ian, but in the later years of his life all the Christian standards were violated, so that it is really a travesty of honest reporting, that Franklin is held up by so many as a role model for Protesta nts. The distortions in the popular history books about Franklin are but a microcosm of the distortions that history books in g eneral suffer from. FRANKLIN'S MOT HER'S CONCERN His mother was very c oncerned that he had jo ined the Freemasons, and strongly objected. In diplomatic double-talk he advised her not to worry about what she didn't know about. \"As to the Freemasons, unless she will believe me when I assure her that they are in general a very harmless sort of P eople; and have no principles or Practices that are in consistent with Re ligion or good Manners, I know no Way of giving my Mother a better Opinion of them than she seems to have at pres ent (since it is not allow'd that Women should be admitted into that secret Society)... I must entreat her to suspend Judgment till sh e is better inform'd,...\" 69 To paraphrase-- So Mom I can't tell yo u anything more, but do n't judge until you're well informed about us. THE ROSICRUCIANS There have been numerous small gr oups of Rosicru cians of various kinds. (See the di agram) The purpose stated by one of the principal Rosicrucian groups: \"The Fraternity is now entirely devoted to philosophical research, spiritual traini ng and Occult Initiation.\" 70 The famous Jewish magician E liphas Levi (self-named Zahed) 71 was"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"the Supreme Grand Master of the Rosicrucians in 1861, when the next Supreme Grand Master, the American Dr. P.B. Randolph was chosen. 72 Eliphas Levi was a deep student of the Kaballah, and wrote many books on magic, including the History of Magic. His 1896 edition of Transcendental Magic carries a big illustration of the \"Star of David.\" One hostile biographer claimed he charged up to 25 Francs to give clients prophecies from Lucifer. 73 Lytton knew Levi. Lytton tried to establish a magic so ciety in London, which Madame Blavatsky became acquainted with. 74 (Magic, the Je wish Cabala, and Freemasonry are connected . A large number of famous magicians have been Jewish Freemasons.) 75 This Rosicrucian group had an Order which in England was called The Order of the Rose, in France L'Ordre du Lis, and in America The Order of the Lily. During the Civil War, the Rosicrucian Council of Three of the Order of the Lily consisted of Paschal Beverly Randolph, General Ethan Allen Hitchcock (his mother was the Mason Ethan Allen's daughter), and Abraham Lincoln. 76 It is well known that Lincoln and his wife had seances, etc. in the White House. Abraham Lincoln's wife was especially into sp iritism. Rev. Cole of the Church of Illumination writes in The Light of Life, \"Abraham Lincoln also received his training in t he Regeneration, in like manner, under the great Teacher Dr. P.B. Randolph.\" 77 This helps solve one \"mystery\" abou t Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was never a M ason, but many lodges an d individual Masons believed he was. 78 Lincoln had been asked to join, but turned down the chance. A French Masonic magazine Monde Maconnique referred to Lincoln as a \"memb er of the Grand L odge of New York.\" 79 It appears from various reliable Masonic sources th at Lincoln was not a Mason. But he was a Rosicrucian. The c lose affiliation between the two orders, and the overl apping memberships would naturally tend to cloud the issue. During the Civil W ar, Randolph and Hitchcock, who were close friends, Dr. Alex ander Wilder and Abrah am Lincoln formed the nucleus of the Rosicrucians in Wash.D.C. 80 Hitchcock in a compilation of his notes Fifty Years in Camp and Field alludes to their meetings with the President. (Lincoln was the man the Rothschild s wanted, for his election provoked secession by the South. Their plans were to control Lincoln. He turned o ut to be a far grea ter man than people expected.) THE LEADERSHIP OF ROSICRUCIANS The leadership consists of a Gran d Master and a Council of 3 . Underneath this are a Council of 7, Council of 9, and a Council of 21. Their Priests are called Priest s of AEth or Priests of Light. They have Round Table discussions, and an Order of Chivalry, the Knights of the Holy Grail. They are associated with the Martinist Order of Freemasonry.

The Masonic L odges were kno wn to the public and practice symbolic ritual, the Rosic rucians were secr et and were spiritual, \"...training is often given sec retly even in our day,\" and \"...today there are numerous me n... receiving instructions from the Great Order unbeknown to their closest friends.\" 81 (This does not apply to AMORC which is less secret.) Masonry was a brotherhood introducing the occult but not demanding any religious growth from the initiate, while the Rosicrucians have always linked \"spiritual growth\" to the progress of their initiates. At the time of the Revolution, the Council of Three consisted of Benjamin Franklin, George Clyme r and Thomas Paine. 82 George Washington received his training in Regeneration from Paul Ardenheim, the Monk of Wissahikon. 83 Thomas Jefferson was also a member of the Order, as well as Laf ayette, who was initiated in France prior to helping wi th the Amer. Revolution. Later british King Ed ward belonged to the Order of the Rose. A GREAT MYSTERY There is a great man of history whose life was more mystery than it was known. But certain men, especially Alfred F. Dodd, have broken codes, have uncovered ancient ov erlooked letters and documents, and have analyzed and put multitudes of tiny pieces together so that the evidence is so great as to be incontrovertable about who this man really was. But it is not likely you know who I am writing about, bec ause Alfred Dodd's books wi th their evidence have been supressed by the system. 84 I am writing about an extraordinary genius , a great philosopher, a great orator, a great lawyer, and a man of g reat character. A man who was framed in his old age for a crime he was innocent of, by a ruthless politician. 85 A man who gathered the sciences together under the Royal Society. 86 The man who wrot e the greatest works of English literature, 87 and proofread the King James Bible. 88 Many of his incredible works of genius are known under his pen-name of William Shakespeare. 89 He conjectured ahead of his times that heat was energy in motion, and that light travels very fast. 90 He created the modern English language and is resp onsible for English replacing Latin in the English higher schools. 91 He was of royal blood and proper heir to the throne of England. 92 He also lived in an age wh en the shadow of the executioner's block haunted men. It was a day w hen the heads of those who displeased the Queen were severed a nd put on public display. He would have lost his head for so me of his works written under Shakespeare's name had the Queen been able to identify who wrote the works.

She had watc hed baby heirs to the throne be killed. Such barbarism is forgotten, and the Elizabethian age seems now to be only full of the glamour of romance. It was difficult and dangerous times, even for the Queen of England. Who was this great man? Sir Francis Bacon, Vi scount St. Alban, for over two decades the leader of the British Parliment 's House of Commons, and later in life , on January 30,1621 , a member of the House of Lords, the secret first son of the secret marriage between Lord Robert Dudley and Elizabeth Tudor. [FIGURE 13 PHOTOCOPY 2 x 2.6] IN 1586 FRANCIS BACO N PUBLISHED A BOOK CHOICE OF EMBLEMS WITH THIS PICTURE CONTAINING THE MASONIC PILLERS (Joachin and Boaz) & OTHER ESOTERIC SYMBOLS. A GREAT BIRTHDAY PARTY On 22 January, 1621 in honor of Sir Francis Bacon's sixteeth birthday, a select group of men assembled without fanf are for a great Masonic banquet. This Masonic banquet was to pay tribute to their leader, Sir Fra ncis Bacon. Only those of the Rosicrosse, the Rosicrucians, and the Ma sons who were already aware of Bacon's leadership role were invited. Bacon's favorite perfumes had been used. The meeting was at the Great Hall at York House, England (now known as Whitehall) . The tables were T-tables with gleaming white drapery and silver. Flowers decorated the Great Hall. A dear longtime friend of Ba con's, the famous English Poet Ben Jonson gave a Masonic ode to Bacon that day.-Jonson once remarked something like, \"I lo ve the man (Bacon) and do honor his memory above all others.\" 95 First, Ben Jonson toas ted his friend. Next, one can picture this man with his strong face and long nose, and full, thick, and wavy hair, and short mustache and beard as he read out his ode in English.

The word Pile also meant spear in those days- -an illusion to Francis Bacon's role as the Happy genius who was Pallas-Athena the Spear-Shaker. Smiles referred to their fellowship in their brotherhood. The Masons would Fire with their glasses, and the Wine refers to th eir toasts that vent alon g with their Firing Glasses. As their gat hering was all male it refers to the Men. Because Bacon was like a Christ figure Ben uses the wording \"in the MIDST.\" Finally, the word Mystery is full of Masonic connotation. Sir Francis Bacon had revived the M ysteries which only his genius and deep scholarship could have done so well. 97 THE MASONS PRINT BACON'S DIARY YEARS LATER In 1625, Sir Francis Bacon was busy gett ing his affairs in order. He arranged his private diary of sonnets carefully, and then disarranged them to destroy per sonal meanings. The private Rosicrosse Press published it for the exclusive use of the heads of the Rosicrosse-Masons. F inally in 1766, the M ason George Steevens reprinted this Masonic secret book. FRANCIS BACON & THE PRIEURE DE SION The Grand Masters of the Prieure de Sion during those times were Robert Fludd (1595-1637), J. Valentin Andr ea (1637-1654), and Robert Boyle (1654-1691). 98 The driving force behind what became the Royal Society, the Briti sh scientific soci ety, were Robert Fludd, Robert Boyle, Wren, A shmole, Locke, and Sir Thomas Moray. 99 Interestingly, all of these men were both Freemasons and Rosicrucians. 100 When King Charles II raised the Academie (which had gone through various names, the Gresham College, The Invisible College of Scientists) to its present status of the Royal Society, Francis Bacon was honored as the \"M oses\" who had le d the Invisible College through its \"wilderness.\" 101 Sir Francis Bacon knew the Prie ure de Sion. He sta yed according to a number of reliable historians, 102 with the Prieure de Sion's Grand-Master-to-be Andrea in Berlin the last ye ars of his life, after faking his death in England. 103 Sir Francis Bacon is widely know n for his Utopian book the New Atlantis. What is not widely known is t hat it was originally titled The Land of the Rosicrucians. The concept of Atlantis has been preserved by the Mysteries. Sir Francis Bacon and the other leaders of Secret Societies in that day felt the N ew World held out the best chances to create the New Atlantis. 104 Sir Francis Bacon played a leading role in creating the British colonies, especially in Virginia, the Caro lina's and Newfoundland. 105 The British Masons with the British Empire behind them were entrusted with the Plan to create the New Atlantis. Bacon's de scendants moved to Virginia in 1635, where his desce ndant Henry Blount to ok the name Nathaniel Bacon. 106 Nathaniel Bacon, a Master Mason, 107 led a premature revolution called Bacon's Rebellion that prefigured the American Revolution. 108 It is true that Freemasons served on both sides of the American Revolution. Naive people think that indicates that the Masons could not have had anything to do with the Revolution. 109 On the contrary, the Masons wer e the primary instiga tors and leaders 87"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"88 of the Revolution, although they al lowed others to get involved. The British Masons fighting the rebels actually contributed to eventual independence of the Colonies, 110 as did the secret societies in France and Germany. The Masons claim to know something about Sir Francis Bacon uncovered by excavations done in Williamsburg, Virginia. A vault left by his descendants supposedly gives information about the founding of the United States. 111 Some of Sir Francis Bacon's last words known to us, \"I have held up a light in the obscurity of Philosophy, which will be seen centuries after I am dea d. It will be seen amidst the erection of Tombs, Theaters, Fo undations, Temples, of Orders and Fraternities for nobility and obedience,--the establishment of good laws as an example to the World. For I am not raising a Capital or Pyramid to the Pride of men, but laying a foundation in the human Understanding for a holy Temple after the mod el of the World. For my memory I leave it to Men's charitable speeches, to foreign Nations and the next Ages, and to my own Country after some Time has elapsed.\" 112 At another occasion he said, \"I go the same way as the Ancients, but I have something better to of fer than the Morality Dramas of the Greeks and the Mystery Ceremonials of the Egyptians.\" True, he gave part of the Masonic ritual 113 and much of it decidedly non- Christian. TWO NOTABLE OCCULTIST S THAT WERE FREQUE NTLY AROUND BACON The Earl of Leichester, who was Bac on's actual father, had as his physician the magician and Jew Dr. Frederigo Lopez. Christopher Marlowe described Lopez in a dramat ization of his career in the book The Jew of Malta. Marlowe was stabbed to death after the book came out. 114 Sir John Dee, who was another magician/doctor, travelled throughout Europe and was the court astrologer for Queen Elizabeth. (See chapter 1.11 about John Dee.) THE NEW ATLANTIS Bacon describes the Masons in New Atlantis \"...amongst the excellent acts of that king, one above all hath the pre-eminence. It was the erection a nd institution of an order, or society, which we call Solomon's House; the nobles t foundation, as we think, that ever was upon the earth...\" 115 THINGS HAVE CHANGED The idealism, charity, and integrity that c haracterized Bacon is notably absent today in the inner c ircle of the One-World-State power. Bacon was a Philosopher. A man who for much of his life was not wealthy or exceptionally powerf ul. His life was in jeopardy a great deal of the tim e, although contrarywise he and those who knew about his secret royal blood were more respectful, never knowing if he might be proclaimed King by his mother the Queen. When James 1 took over the throne from Bacon's mother , to protect his head Bacon wrote a letter to King James 1, delivered through the Secretary of State, renouncing any ambition to t he throne, and announcing his decision to marry a commoner. 116 By comparison, those who are as prominant today in the One-World-State as Bac on was then are part"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"of a far greater power , and have been corrupt ed by that power. Technology has made a One-World-Sta te much more ominous. It is possibe that Bacon would be aghast at what the One-World-State is going to be. GOING PUBLIC IN 1717 In 1717, four lodges in London wen t public. To give the reader the frame of mind that the \"new\" lodges had, a quote from a Masonic book Defense of Masonry, (1730) is informative as to their view of antiquity. \"The System, as taught in the regular Lodges, may have some Redundancies or Defects, occasion'd by the Ignorance or Indolance of the old m embers. And indeed, cons idering through what Obscurity and Darkness the MYSTERY has been deliver'd down; ...notwithstanding the gre at Rust it may have contracted, there is much of the OLD FABRICK remaining...\" 117 According to Christian researcher Edith Star Miller, 118 once Masonry was open to the public, it was to serve as the screen behind which a host of secret societies, whether theurgic or political, would operat e clandestinely. In other words, organizations like the secret Palladium Ri te of Masonry find it easier to function secretly behind the screen of regular Masonry. Masonry acts as a c learing house for many of the occult organizations. The ce nter switchboard for the various types of Masonic lodges is the Alpina Lodge in Switzerland. The Sufi mysticism, which is maso nic theosophy, operates in cooperation with Freemasonry. Sufism has \"a species of Masonic or Eleusian initiation from low er to higher degrees.\" 119 The Sufi leader to be, who is cons idered the Messiah by the Sufis, is being helped by a select g roup which includes s everal Masons to be revealed as Lord Matreya.(See chapter 1.4) One researcher of Masonry offere d his evaluation, \"The masonic Order usually draws its members fro m the leading merchants, and from the professions, bankers, doctors, and lawyers. They come to their meetings, they dabble in som e charity work, and in general, they mark time until the day when they are asked to perform some unusual task for a fe llow Mason, or for the national or world order. At that time, they finally realize that th e blood oath does have significance, but by that time it is usually too late. They may be asked to support a Masonic candidate for political office, to swing a business deal to a fellow Mason, or. even to commit perjury or some other illegal act f or a brother Mason. Even then, they are never offered any confidences; they are merely told what they must do, and they obey.\" 120 Ex-Masons confirm this. They also indicate that some of the more insignificant members may not be in a position to help, and may not be called upon for favors. THE PRIEURE DE SION & THE ILLUMINATI In order to explain the connection let us cover the structure of Masonry.

WHAT WAS THE VALUE OF THE UNION OF THE SCOTTISH, MI ZRAIM & MEMPHIS RITES? What was the value of this unio n? The Rites of Mizraim and Memphis are far m ore occultic and g nostic than the S cottish Rite. If a neophyte was obv iously interested in the occult, and was lacking finances, this Masonic pamphlet \"The Gr and Mystic Temple\" indicates he could be started at the 18t h degree of the Scottish Rite (the Rose Croix of Heredom) and at the 46th degree of Mizraim. From there he could progress in the 3 rites. There are numerous secret \"interoffice memo type\" papers that indicate that a Satan ist, a Luciferian, a prac titioner of black magic, or the like has a easy time in Free masonry, because the upper degrees are controlled by men who will bend any rules to help them. Having a membership card is of limited value in visiting a foreign Lodge. A dues card is important, showing that one's dues are all paid up. Certain questions will be asked, and certain parts of the rituals need to be quoted by memory to satisfy the Lodge one is visiting. Now, let us, for instance, picture an American Mason visiting an Irish lod ge. He can go to the Freemasons' Hall in Dublin or to one of the Provincial Masonic Temples and be examined."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"This examination though is a courtesy, and it is up to the Grand Lodge's office whether they bother to interview him. By being interviewed this Am erican will then be vo uched to attend any meeting in the Grand Lodge of Ireland. When attending he will have to have been given the password of the First Degree (or other degree) . However, if he has been vouc hed, he will know the passwords. One can now see the le verage the Luciferian occultists have in Masonry, when the correct dues ca rds, diplomas, and passwords are given freel y to them by the head s of these Rites. THE RITE OF MIZRAIM & MEMPHIS These two rites, a lthough separate in s ome areas are closely allied. The Rite of M izraim is mainly Jewish. 121 The secret order of the Prieure de Sion is also predominantly Jewish. 122 The B'nai B'rith seems to have taken over some of the Rite of Mizraim influence upon Masonry. 123 The Rite of Memphis is not just European. Americans, such as 6- term Governor of Wiscons in Lucius Fairchil d who was 95°, are Memphis Rite Masons too. The Rite of Memphis has Ormus in their ritual. What or who is Ormus? Ormus (Ormudz) was the supreme God of Mithraism and Zoroastrian thought. It was also the name by which the Prieure de Sion allegedly went by from the years 1188-1306. 124 In 1188, when the Ordre de Sion became the Prieur e de Sion it took the subtitle Ormus, until just before the arrest of the Templar Knights' leaders. The controversial Protoco ls of Sion have been tr aced to the Rite of Mizraim in Paris, to a Mason named Maur ice Joly. People have raised a straw man in clai ming that the Conspi racy \"Theories\" are based on the Protocols of Sion. The Protocols, whether they are of any significance or not, are a tiny atom of the mass of evidence. Even so a lot of disinformation has spewed forth from the System against the Protocols, and it continues to be printed, perhaps by agent provocateurs for the System. The book Warrant for Genocide put out by Yale University, suppose dly destroying the credibility of the Protocols is such poor thinking and pure nonsense, 125 one wonders if that is the best argumentation against the Protocols, then the Protocols must be valid. Warrant for Genocide makes it appear that all \"anti-semitism\" comes from crazy people who use the Protocols. The Protocols themselves speak of a Masonic conspiracy, not a Jewish conspiracy, so why have the Jewish people never used that as a defense? Numerous researchers into the Consp iracy have noticed heavy Jewish involvement. The lack of pub lic response has resulted in some researchers believing that radical problems needed radical solutions. Nesta Webster, who began neutral toward the Jews ended up a die-hard Fascist in the 1920s. She wrote The Need for Fascism in Great Britain. (For the Christian it would be worthwhile to take a fresh look at 1 C or. 13 which declares that no matter what worthwhile thing we do, if we do not have love, it of no value.) The religion called Mithra ( Babylon), Mithras (Roman), Mitra (India) had spread over the known world during the first centuries A.D. It was very popular. It had cabbalistic thought, astrology, numerology, 'words of power', Greek philosophy, Babylonian myth, 93"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"94 and a Gnostic dual the ology which Maso ns like Albert Pike believed in. 126 When Christianity became a recognized religion, it is a valid question to wonder which absorbed which, Mithraism or Christianity? Certain ideas of Mithraism continue to resurface under the label Christian. For instance, in Mithraism (which became known later as Gnosticism ) there was the idea that after 6,000 years of man's existence, a Golden Age would come in. 127 Mithraism is so close to Mas onry, that those who stu dy Mithraism have often commented that Freemasonry is the continuation of it. Mithraism absorbed occultic tho ught, and was somewhat eclectic. It's follower's held rituals (for men only) in caves, or temples. Their rites remind one of the Masonic Rituals. In Israel, Masonic ceremonies are held in the Caves of He zekiah, which have a chamber about 130 feet underground below th e Temple Mount (of where Herod's Temple in Jerusa lem was) . The cave wi ll seat about 200. The cave is near t he Damascus Gate. The City of Jerusalem gives a special privilege to the Masons to use it. On days of Masonic ceremonies, the caves which are nor mally open to the public are closed. Manly P. Hall claims the Mason ic eye comes from the supreme God Ahura Mazda (or Ormuzd, Ormus). There are many similarities between Mithraism, th e Prieure de S ion, and Masonry. In A Guide To The Gods a reference works on pagan gods the Rite or religion of Mithra is described, \"It contained much symbolism. . .all with Masonic overtones.\" 128 \"One can see in the appurtenances of Mithraism the germ of many secret society and occult rite, many an exc lusive cabal... and clubs.\" 129 In Mithraic Studies, an extensive compilation of studies on Mithraism, it states, \"Undoubtedly ancient Mithraism li ke orthodox Freemasonry today, with which it has so much in common...\" FREEMASONRY HAS LO TS OF SPIN-OFFS Freemasonry is \"directly or indirectly the parent of all modern secret societies, good, bad, or indifferent.\"--Cyclopedia of Fraternities . One outdated source indicates there are over 600 secret societies in the U.S. utilizing Masonic symbolism, and operating largely under Masonic inf luence, so that about every third male adult in the U.S. is a member of one or more such societies. 130 The 600 figure is outdated, and the actual number of secret societies has increased by several hundred more secret societies. See Chap. 2.3 for the Spin-off Chart. Some of the Masonic spin-offs have become such a part of normal life that the negative reactions of past years toward them are forgotten. Rotary, be cause of its Masonic control, hostility toward the Catholic Church, and its moral code, \"which in almost every particular resembles that of Freemasonry, \" was forbidden in some Catholic jurisdictions, and discouraged in others. 131 That was back in the 19th and early 20th century. THE HIGHER SCOTTISH RITE DEG REES & THE PALLADIUM RITE In the hard to obtain book, The Hidden Life In Freemasonry, written by 33rd degree C.W. Leadbeater for Masons one learns in Masonic language what the upper degrees of Freemasonry can get into. On page 175 Leadbeater refers to \"when a cland estine meeting"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"is held, even though a duly I.M. be present, th e inner recognition is not given...\" What? Why are these Masons being so secretive amongst themselves? Because the Theurgical fun ( Magical & occult) and politics begin, and the Lodge quits being just a private club for ritual. How this operates will be discussed. First, we'll discuss the 30-33 Scottish Ri te degrees. This is where it is becoming evident that Lucifer is the God of Masonry. Leadbeater says, \"It mu st of course be underst ood... the conferring of the Higher Degrees puts certain definite powers in the hands of the recipient.\" Where does such power come from? \"The 33 degree links the Sovereign Gran d Inspector General w ith the Spiritual King of the World Himself--th at Mightiest of Adep ts who stands at the head of the Great White Lodge, in whose strong hands lie the destinies of earth--a nd awakens the powers of the Triple Spirit as far as they can yet be awakened.\" ( The Hidden Life In Freemasonry, p.302) Other Masons like Manly P. Hall (33°) and Foster Bailey (32°) have said similar things. Foster Bailey calls the spirits that Masons communicate with the \"Illuminati\" 132 . These spirits initiate the se higher Masons into becoming light-bearer s themselves. The Ill uminati...\"assist at the unfolding of the consciousness of the candidate until the time comes when he can 'enter into light' and, in his turn become a light-bearer, one of the Illuminati who ca n assist the Lodge on High in bringing humanity to light.\" 133 These spirits have various Mason s. Masons Harold Waldwin Pecival and Lynn F. Perkins claim their books were inspi red by spirits. 134 Is 33° Mason Leadbeater talking about linking up with the Christian Christ? \"Th e H.O.A.T.F. makes the ac tual links both with Himself...and also through himself with that Mighty King...This stage combines the wonderful love of Horus the Son with the ineffable life and stren gth of Osiris the divi ne Father and Isis the eternal Mother of the world.\" This initiation connects the Mason with the pagan egyptian trinity? That's what he says. Leadbeater goes on to say how much glory, spiritual power, and worldly power the Mason has after this initiation, (p. 3 04) The next page Leadbeater begins the section telling the Mason \"How to Use the Powers\". He talks about the Liberal Catholic Church. Yes, men who have left the Liberal Cat holic Church have verbally and in writing talked about how Satanic it is. Leadbeater continues, \"Yet when on e of these bright Spirits is attached to us by a Masonic ceremony we must not think of him either as a director or as an attendant, but si mply as a co-worker and a brother.\" (p. 309) The next chapter \"Two Wonderful Rituals\" describes Egyptian rituals to Amen-Ra, and the Blazing Star. They sing a hymn to \"Ra, the Logos, the Sun-God, than king Him for His response...\" They take a sacrement to Osirus. The next ritual described may pos sibly refer to part of the secret Palladium Rite , as it refers to THE TRIANGLE OF ADEPTS. The Palladium Rite calls its g roups Triangles. He talks about chanting invocations, and then angels appear ing. Then the Illu minati salute is given to the Angel, where t he left arm is placed above as if shielding one from light. (p . 341) Leadbeater indicates that 95"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"96 eventually the Temple of the Ange ls draws 9 orders of angels, \"which are not limited to one solar system.\" (p. 342) If the reader is still with me--thi s Author would like to describe some about the Palladium R ite. This Author has never been in the Palladium Rite, and it is secret, so how would a person find out about such a rite? One expose of the Palladium Rite that appeared to be a hoax in the 19th century, has made people leary that the Rite even exists. When a n ews conference had been held, they were unable to p roduce evidence. One ex-P alladist Mason has problems getting people to believe it exists! Goddess Pallas Athena , the Sign of Pruden ce and Circumspection, was used especially by Francis Bacon because it had the double meaning from Greek mythology of Spear-shaker, or \"Shake-speare\" his pen name. Palladian means pertain ing to the Goddess Pallas or characterized by wi sdom. And palladium mea ns an object that is essential to the safeguarding of a community. Palladium is also the statue of Pallas Athena, upon which the city of Troy depended upon for its safety. Pallas Athena is also called Athena by the Greeks and Minerva by the Romans. Sir Francis Bacon wrote the name AthenA in his Rosicrucian books as A.A. Alfred Dodd goes into details of letters, poems of people to Bacon and writings of Sir Francis Bacon which use Pallas Athena. 135 A secret Palladium Rite had existed at least from the time of 1730. Perhaps it was itse lf was from yet anoth er earlier Palladium Rite, or perhaps it drew from some Rosicrucian source. At any rate, it was reactivated in 1884. At the Public Library was the respectable Encyclopaedia of American Institutional Fraternal Organizations by Schmidt. Under \"FREE AND REGENERATED PALLADIUM\" it reads \"This Masonically linked society... remained dorma nt until 1884. After this date it was reformed to ' impart new force to the traditions of high grade Masonry.' The society admi tted men and women, the former to the grades of Adelphos and Companion of Ulysses and the latter to the grade of Penelope. The society held all its \"Councils\" in strict secrecy. It never printed any proceedings and very much restricted its membership.\" (p.119) On page 161 is an article on HOME PALLIDUM, which is a fraternal benefit society, apparently for members of the Palladium Rite. The Palladium Rite created by Albert Pike is totally Luciferian. It is \"androgynous.\" In the larger cities, activities are carried out in the Masonic Temple s, which allows women to slip into the Temples without arousing attention. All of this will be strongly denied by the Masonic Lodges. Members are selected mainly from higher levels of the Scottish Rite, although the members can come from other Rites too. The Palladium Rite has its own budget. Its power over the Masonic Lodge does not derive from being a part of the power structure, but from the careful sel ection of Masons that participate in the Palladium Rite and their distribution throughout the various Rites of Masonry and their con trolling bodies. The Grand Central Direc tories (and from there to the Supreme Councils, Grand Encampments, Grand Orients, and Grand Lodges) are the nerve centers of Masonry from which orders emanate. The Palladium Rite is popular among those in positions of power. It is said that the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"leaders of the Palladium Rite are allowed to visit or join the B'nai B'rith lodges.(See chap. 1.7) 136 William Schnoebelen is presently a Christian author. Prior to becoming a Christian, he had been initiated into the Palladium Lodge in Chicago named Resurrection Lodge #13. He describes some about getting the Palladium Degree of Paladin in his recent book Masonry Beyond The Light. That lodge claimed to be derived from the European chapter of the AISB.(p. 186) Higher Masons become Illuminati-- which go by several names one of which is \"Masters of the Temple.\" A single illumined pe rson is called an Illuminatus. SUMMARY This chapter has sh own how Freemasonry is the One-World- Religion. Freemasonry has created hundreds of organizations. Freemasonry itself is the pagan m ystery religion, which at the highest level becomes Luciferian worship. It has quietly played the dominant political role in the United States even before independence. (Fo r more details on its political role see the Appendix.) NOTES 1. I have tried to leave these introductory parag raphs without footnotes to help the fl ow of reading. Ali ce Bailey is so well known that these things really don't need footnotes. However, the question can be asked, \"How much would her husband and her have talked about things, considering Masons do not talk or tell the truth to their wives about the Lodge?\" This is a legitimate question, some wives have found out that their honest husbands lied for decades about the lodge. There are some rites which are designed for both sexes like the Palladium Rite and the Order of the Magi which admit women. Also for women is Co-masonry, Order of the Eastern Star, and Daughters of the Nil e. The high level of importance that Alice Bailey held indicates she was in communication with whoever in Masonry she needed to cooperate with. 2. The Watchtower June 15, 1963, p. 377 says the Rosicrucians go back to Great White Brotherhood of Egypt. 3. Benjamin Creme, a student of Fre emasonry, the occult, and Bailey believes the Hierarchy has assigned him the job of John the Baptist to announce the new m essiah named Lord Mai treya. (See chapter 1.4) Benjamin Creme in describ ing the One-World-Religi on that is coming in the Age of Aquarius states, \"The Ancient Mysteries [Freemasonry] will be restored, the Mystery Schools reopened, and a great expansion of man's awareness of himself and his purpose and destiny will become possible.\"(Creme, Benjamin. The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of Wisdom. London:Tara Press, 1980, p.182) \"The Mystery schools will be reopened and men will go to them as they now go to University, to l earn and to take the disciplines that will prepar e them for initiation, and so into the Hierarchy.\"(ibid.,p.190 ) \"The new religion will manifest itself through organizations like Masonry.\" (ibid.,p. 28) (bold added.) 97"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"98 4.

Delia Bacon, (no relation to Francis Bacon) was the first profane person to really realize that Sir Francis Bacon was Shakespeare. She was so overwhelmed by this discovery, she went to England and devoted her life to researching the connections. They man aged to lock her up in an insane asylum near Stratford, but not before she succeeded to get her book published. Her nephew final ly rescued her from the British insane asylum and brought her back to Hartford,Conn, where she died in peace \"trusting in the Lord.\" She was cruelly slandered, rediculed and moc ked as if her discove ry was an insane idea. Whether true or false, her theory, n ow substantiated, makes more sense than any other explanation. In terestingly, various Masons, including Mark Twain, and various important men in the One- World-Power like Henry James and Sigmund F reud believed in her research, while the \" profane\" world almost entirely ignored her. 85.

The United Nations wa s set up, as a testing ground for the New World Order. This background information is intended as an introduction for th e reader to th e multifaceted gnostic religion and the one-world-government c onspiracy it is married to. You will now learn that the basic ingredients are the same for the va rious gnostic hierarchical religions, they just have a different flavor to them. They operate off of the same principles. There is even a book How to Start your own Religion. As you progress through this book Be Wise As Serpents you'll learn how they cooperate and function togethe r. What we have been viewing as separate independent religious groups are actually at the very top working together. This chapter is meant to be a tool to enable th e reader to see that t hose basic ingredients of gnosticism make up all the gnostic religions, and that the Jehovah' s Witnesses, th e Nazi's, the Mormons, the Masons, Wicca, etc. are simply different flavors of the same thing. If you want Moslem flavor be a Sufi, if you want a Jewish flavor join a Je wish New Age synagogue, if you want a Buddhist flavor join Ni chiren Shoshu or Lamaism, if yo u want American Indian flavor join the Earth Circle or the Be ar Tribe Medicene Circle, if you wa nt a Christian flavor join the Moravians, or Jehovah's Witnesses, or the LDS church, or the I AM . The Gnostic New Age movement has other flavors too, Egyptian, Aryan, Witchcraft, S un Worship, Satan Worship, and New Thought. This Author has drawn a diagram to show the reader his choice of Gnostic poisons. What flavor do you want? Let's say your religious tastes are like the Neopalitan Icecream (a combination of three) lover. There are groups to accomodate you. For exam ple, Annalee Skarin has an offshoot from Mormonism which is a small me taphysical religion. In 1948 she published Ye are Gods. Another of the many Mormon offshoots called the Aryan Christian Church combines the philosophies of Mormonism and Nazism. They use th e Hitler salute and the swastika. Basic ingredients to create a gnostic religion. 1. Hidden knowledge. 2. A heirarchy, generally divided in 3 basic tiers, the general initiate s, the elect, the enlightened top 1,2 or 3 leaders 3.

The word Gnosis means the ultimate knowledge transmitted by an elite hierarchy of initiates.

[Place FIG. 2 -chart of gnostic religious flavors] Many have asked this author, do the leaders of the cults know what is going on? Yes, they have been orally, emphasis on that word ora lly told exactly what is happening. The leaders of the New Age, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and th e LDS church know what they are up to, and what their roles are in creating a one-world gov ernment. That is the method that Gnosticism uses. The very top Prophet or Illumi nated Master is informed orally. Illumination for any Gnostic group comes from superhuman knowle dge. New Age leaders almost always claim they are channeling. There is an evolving dualistic fight of lightness and darkness found in the Hindu Vedas, the old Ge rmanic legends, the Nordic sagas, and the Jehovah's Witnesses myth that Je hovah is struggling to vindicate himself to Satan. Like C.T. Russell, founder of the Watchtow er Society, the gnostics often s ee the sun as a primary sacred symbol. The Hakenkreuz (swastika) of the Nazi s was a sun wheel. The sw astika was a frequently used Masonic symbol, until Hitler. Since Hitler, the Ma sons haven't been using it. It is also called the gamma cross and has been used for many centuries. The Jewi sh gnostic groups have tended to exalt the moon, (also the plan ets and stars) while Aryan groups from India, Ira n, and Germany tend to exalt the Sun. One of the better summaries of Gnosticism, and how Gnosti c religion has come down the ages to us today is given by the Theosophical Society, \"From the time of the closing of the Neo-Platonic and Gnostic Schools to the last quarter of the Nineteenth Century, save for the fe w alchemists, Kabalists, Rosicrucians, occultly instructed Masons and Christia n mystics, Theosophy was unknown in the Western world. Before then it was known and studied in various fo rms by the Platonists, the Pythagoreans, the Egyptians, and the Chaldeans, whil st in India and Chin a it has been preser ved down the ages in unbroken continuity. It is the wisdom of the Upanishads and the Vedas, the very heart of Hinduism, Taoism and Islam.\" 4 111"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"112 To realize what is being said here is eye opening. The Rosicrucia ns and occult Masons have preserved Gnostic Theosophy which is the very heart of Hinduism, Taoism and Islam. The Gnostic religions are often called pagan. This pagan worship is often the exoteric cover that the first levels are in itiated into. The highest level is often the real esoteric worship, and often involves dire ct Luciferian or Satanic worship. In other words, the Sun worship of the Masons and other groups is a fig leaf for the wo rship by the highest levels of the Divine Serpent Satan. Gnostic religions use symbols a nd rituals. The Jehov ah's Witnesses have formed their own new rituals, and their own new symbols. But they have retained the magical use of the word Jehovah which has been in use for centuries. The WT Society has followed the very popular school of Gnosticism which follows the ideas of Valentius. This school teaches that matter is more evil than good, and that all matter will be destroyed by fire. For in stance, this pattern of thought is seen in the refusal of the WT Society to accept sex as a natural process and to view it as an evil to be tolerated. Listen to a professed Gnostic , \"Humanity reaches forward to a spiritual consummation when the whole Earth will be peopled with a R ace of men fully conscious of their god-like nature and powers; and si n, sickness, and death will have b een banished for th e remaining period of the Earth's cosmic cycle.\" 5 It almost sounds like something out of the Watchtower magazine. The WT magazine has even used the phraseolgy that a new race was to inhabit the New System. 6 The Gnostics believe they have a deeper form of Christian ity. Then they generally take this further contending that they have the root teaching for the ancient scriptures of the other religions. They indeed have the root teaching of religion, but not of the Christian faith. In the first book of the Hebrew sc riptures is the stor y of the perfect Gard en of Eden. This perfect garden environment shows that originally God had established order. (Some readers may not believe the Genesis account, even so by continuing to read this chapter you will understand an alternative to the New World Order's Gnosticism and why many Christians contend their faith in God is the opposite of religion. This is important not only for those seeking answers but also to understand why the Christianity that Christ taught is being singled out for destruction.) From the time man left that Garden environm ent of order, he has been trying to create a New World Order. By the use of religion he has tried to patc h up the wild world, and to rearrange, to repair, to reform th is polluted disordered world. Th e condition of the world testifies that religion has failed. But religion was never mean t to be the tool to re order the world. In the Garden of Eden, Jesus Christ was promised to Adam a nd Eve as God's own method of reconciling Himself back to mank ind. Christ was the hope of the Hebrew pr ophets, and the center of their faith in God. The mystery of God, Je sus Christ, was sent to man as God's way of allowing those people searching for Him to get to know Him. Religion is supposedly a search for God, but in reality the priesthoods are not honestly looki ng for God to reveal Himself (how often do they speak of a need for an atonement?) , but they are looking for techniques they can develop to sell to the masses. Religion continues for various reasons, many of them selfish. In reality, they have misunder stood the Christian message. Th ey reinterpret in the view of their religious message.

If one wants to search for and study a rock, there is no object ion on the part of the rock. If one wants to search for and study a man without his consent, he may run into big trouble. If one searches for God, he finds out that unless God reveals Himself to the searcher the finite man cannot find an infinite and Holy God. Christ came with the object of showing man how man doesn't need to seek God by himself, that God is willing to reveal Himself to mankind. Rather than relying on religion, man can allow God to reconcile Hims elf to mankind. Jesus Christ was not very complimentary to the religious leaders of the day. He called them \"ye fools and blind; woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites.\" (Mt 23:13) Those Pharisees had picked up the entire Babylonian gnostic relig ious system. After Jerusalem fell to the Romans the Jewish religious leaders returned to Babylonia, which became the Jewish religious center until they began moving into Europe in the middle ages. The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia states on pages 13 through 17, \"...in the second century C.E.[A.D.] Babylonia ha d become a bulwark of Judaism.... The former land of exile had become a land of refuge... Th e 7th century found the importance of Babylonian Jewry considerably increased. During the precedi ng 300 years, Palestine had been merely a place of veneration, while Babylonia became the center of Jewish life and le arning. Babylonian Jews no longer looked to Palestine for instruction; ev en the heads of the sc hools at Tiberius were Babylonian Jews....Babylonia was the spiritual cen ter of Judaism, and its influence brought many Babylonian customs into general use...\" (bold added) The early groups called gnostics in Egypt a nd the Middle East were primarily Jews. From the preceeding information one begins to realize how indepted the world is to the Jews who served as a vehicle to spread gnosticism throughout the world. (The Cause celebre of this book will be to show how the Jehovah's Witnesses' Watchtower Society ties into the New World Or der in chapters 1.5 to 1.17. Anyone at all familiar with how the Watchtower Society claims to have nothing to do with any political, religious, or fraternal group, will realize that if the Watchtower Society is part of this New World Order then our minds can adjust to accepting about anybody el se could be involved too. Unit 2 will tell us who else.) EXAMINING JEHOVAH'S WITN ESSES GNOSTIC TEACHINGS Let us examine for a while the Gnostic teachi ngs of the Jehovah's Witnesses. Rutherford in Preservation (1932) p. 153, \"God has made known to his people the meaning of much that has heretofore been hidden, and may not those th ings be taken as proof that Armageddon is near,...\" The Jehovah's Witnesses credentials ar e based on revealing hidden knowledge. Let us narrow our examination to their book The Harp of God. \"Jehovah had a great plan before the foundati on of the world; but no one knew about it. During the first four thousand year s of man's history God's plan wa s kept a secret. He began to reveal it to man nearly nineteen hundred years ago, and then only to those who are consecrated to do his will. Promise was made that greater light should come at the end of the age, and this promise has been kept. We ARE AT THAT TIME , as clearly proven by the contents herein... 113"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"114 People generally have not been thoroughly instru cted in the Bible. Even those who have attended the Sunday schools have merely learned the text and not the meaning of the text. Like the prophets of old, they have hear d but understood not. The real reason for thes e conditions is that God's plan could not be understood until his due time to reveal it. HI S DUE TIME IS HERE. (Preface to The Harp of God, 1921) \"The mystery of God has been a stumbling bl ock to both Jews and Ch ristians, so-called; but in God's due time he WILL MAKE KNOWN to all the secret of his mystery and then all rightly exercised by this w ill rejoice with exceeding jo y.\" (Harp of God, p. 182) \"The mystery is THE CHRIST...(ib id. ,p.l82) The Christ is th e instrument or channel for the blessing of mankind. THE CHRIST IS COMPOSED OF JE SUS, THE GREAT AND MIGHTY HEAD, AND 144,000 MEMBERS. (ibid, p.187) \"Jehovah has so arranged th at only those who have th eir minds illuminated...can understand and appreciate the mystery of God. Th ese are the ones designa ted by the prophet Joel as the servants and handmaid ens of God...\" (ibid., p.190) ANALYSIS Concerning the revelation of the \"mystery\" Col. 1:24-27 says, \"...the mystery which hath b een hid for ages and from ge nerations, but NOW is made manifest to his saints...\" When Paul wrote \"this mystery is NOW made manifest\" it was 19 centuries ago. This is just one of several scriptures that say the same thing. Rom. 16:25-26 and I Cor. 2:7-10 were both written by Paul and both declare that the \"m ystery\" which had been \"hid\" was revealed to all the nations in Paul's day. The Gnostic Rutherford would have us believ e that he is revealing to the world the mystery knowledge for the first time. However Jude in his epistle in verse three says , \"contend for the fa ith which was once delivered (the ASV \"once for all\") unto the saints. Were Christians to receive a better new message at some future point? Paul warns the Christians that \"the faith\" that was once delivered is the one and onl y gospel, and that if an angel (spirit being) or man brings a nother gospel, whet her better or worse whic h Paul had not preached then let him be cursed. See Gal. 1:8,9. Don't let anyone fool you. The church of the first century knew this Mystery and proclaimed it to the world. Mt. 28:18-20, Mk. 16: 15,16. Yes, the Myster y had been on the mind of God since the beginning of th e world, and had been only partially revealed in the Old Testament and the prophets. Read Eph. 3:1-2 and we find that 1. the mystery was revealed to him-verse 3, 2. when the Christians read Paul's letter they could perceive his understanding of the mystery. They understood it then. 3. We see in verse 5 that the \"mystery\" was rev ealed to the apostles and the prophets by the Spirit. 4. Paul's mission was to MAKE ALL MEN see what was the disp ensation of the mystery for ages which had been hid in God. We are told that \"in God's good time he will pour out his spir it upon all mankind, so that all can understand his wonderful plan.\" (The Harp of God, p. 190) Yet, the Bible verse that this is quoting and the reference to th is on p. 190 which is Joel 2:28,29 is applied by Peter in the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"New Testament to what was happening back on the day of Pentecost, \"This is THAT spoken through the prophet Joel.\" They misunderstand the me aning Joel gives to \" all flesh\"- he doesn't mean every person that has ever lived, but rather all kinds of people Jew and Gentile, Greek and Egyptian, and they were all there at Pentecost. It is clear from II Tim. 2:15 that the day when the mystery was revealed partially by inspired men and women is over. The revelation of God's will is complete; and now we should study the written Revelation. This only makes sense. Rutherford says, \"Those who are thus anointed have the spirit of th e Lord and by virtue of his spirit are ABLE TO UN DERSTAND THE MYSTERY OF GOD...\" The Holy Spirit inspired the writers. He does not have to inspire the readers. If so, there was no point in inspiring the writers. It does not re quire an inspired man to interpret an inspired man. If so, the first inspired man's book is no t a REVELATION, but still a MYSTERY. If we can not understand the first in spired man, how can we understa nd the second inspired man. Especially if they are inspired by the same Holy Spirit. Gnostic leaders like the power that comes from people having to come to them for enlightment. Even if the Bible is not understood by a man, because he is so carnal that he can't think straight, he doesn't need to go to a man like Rutherford. (Read more about Joseph Rutherford in especially chapters 1.12 & 1.14.) The reason Christ went awa y, according to Christ was so that the Holy Spirit would be sent to teach us all things. A further study of Christ and his relationship to the despised common masses of people, would show that he was advoca ting the opposite of G nosticism. His wisdom was not hid under a bushel basket, but set on a hill, so to speak, for all to lear n and profit from. Also Christ ministered and befriended those of every social class, including government officials and gentiles. God wants to reconcile himself to ever yone, not just to some inner clique. Jesus Christ also taught the limitations of knowledge (gnosis). MAN-MADE NEW ORDERS Christ's atoning work is totally overlooke d by popular \"theology\" that the New World Order is trying to get people hooked on. One of th ese is called \"Liberation Theology\". Naturally, they are going to give it a good label. Liberation Theology has as its goal the creation of a man- made Kingdom of God on earth, a millenium. This Millenial kingdom is to be a One-World socialist (Marxist) government such as Cuba and Russia's communist regime. The use of a promised Millenium by the New World Order will be discussed in Chapter 2.5. For now, we will touch on LT here simply to point it out as anot her religious scam. People are told if they through violent revolution create a Marxist socialist One-World government, then they will have the classless Utopian society Jesus supposedly tried to set up. People today are killing in the name of Liberation Theology, blindly fighting for their own enslavemen t. The plans of the New Order over a century ago were to make us demand what they wanted to do to us. Under the religious trappings of \"Liberation Theol ogy\" many people are helping create what is planned already to be the worst slave stat e in mankind's history. Even if Liberation Theology through communism could satify man's material needs, Jesus said \"Man does not live by bread alone.\" \"Take heed and beware of covetousness, for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the thi ngs which he possesseth.\"Lk 12:15 Why? Because man is an organic unity of body, spir it, and soul. To neglect the spir itual side is to ignore part of man's nature. Further their program will fa il even on the material needs, for those administering communism are full of greed, lust for power, pride and selfishness. Christ said, 115"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"116 \"out of the heart of man proceed evil though ts—all evil comes from w ithin and defiles the man.\"Mk 7:21-23 The Bible's age old wisdom was that unless God builds th e house, they labor in vain who build it. That can equally be applied to theology. Men are building religions, God builds men's faith in Him. In any case, being religious or not being religious, will not solve the basic problem of man. The action of a pig rolling in the mud does not make him a pig. He won't become a lamb if stops rolling in the mud. Likewise, man and creation are disordered and sinful by nature. Whether man \"rolls\" in religion or doesn't roll, doesn't change man's nature either, and so knowledge doesn't reconcile man to God. God reconciles man to God. Man has been working hard to create a Ne w World Order without the new heart God has offered him. (Ezekiel 18:31, 36: 26, Jeremiah 31:33b, Deut. 30:6) FINAL WRAP UP Gnostic Religions create inst ant power bases for their ad ministrators—whatever those administrators are called Priests, Rabbis, Swam is, Guru's, etc. The gnostic religions follow a pattern. The various leaders at th e very top of these various aut hority pyramids are collaborating. (You'll learn much more on this further on in th is book.) The bottom line is that what appears as perhaps fifty or one hundred religious \"scams\" are component s of one single conspiracy for ultimate world power. Judaism comes from Ba bylon. For those who li ke the ancient myst ery religions you will want to thank the Jews. Jews have been one of the best instruments for spreading gnosticism in its various forms. Christ's teachings and missi on was the opposite of gnosticism . Christ was the predicted method that God had for revealing Himself to th ose who were seeking Him. Faith in God through Christ Jesus is not a power religi on. Rather than trying to hide kno wledge, Christ tried to spread his good message by calling on his di sciples to \"go into the whol e world teaching\", and to do good to all even those who despitefully would abuse them. Notes: 1. Cumbey, Constance. Th e Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow, p.99. 2. Readers who are familiar with the conspiracy will be aware of mu ch of this. It was appropriate to give some background in formation at this point for the general r eadership. 1 didn't want to bog the reader down in footnotes and details of events at this point , because this information about W.W. II is not vital to the discussion at hand. Re aders are encouraged to investigate several of the books now available th at cover the Conspiracy's role in W.W. II.

No wise person would knowingly choose to fight their opponent blind and deaf, yet that seems to be the choice which many nominal Christians are choosing. They would like to characterize this book as doomsdayer stuff and then dismiss and ignore this material. They want to eat, drink and be happy. This book has nothing to do with a dooms day, if Christians suffer for Truth t hat can only be a wonderful testim ony of love for their Lord Jesus, who is the Way, t he Truth, and the real Life. (Christians are not seeking martrydom, but the chance to st and for the Truth revealed in Christ is a chance to honor their creator for his love.) This book has to do with recording what p eople involved with the Power have planned, and why they can carry out their plans. Further it will give you things you can do to counter the Power. While you may perhaps s hudder at the thought of World War III, you should be aware that many people have bee n deceived to look forward to an Armageddon. Not only are these people planning an d looking forward to it, but they have been blaming its assumed arrival on Christians for several years.<#1. Various New Age leaders preach the power of colle ctive consciousness (which belief is a type of belief in magic). Some of these New Agers speak and write that Christianity's belief in Armageddon is the reason it will occur, that Ch ristians are Willing it to happen.> If people think that by putting their heads in the s and they can escape the future, or even the present difficulties, they may be in for a rude surprise. So how is the adversary of freedom building a One-Wo rld-Religion? Several items are stock tools, a. What they call Blinds- these are deliberat e deceptions placed within their own writings to confuse the uninitiated.

These truths and other are deflected from their origi nal purpose of gl orifying the Creator to glorifying their ow n programs. Rather than publicly opposing Ch ristianity, they rename their own movements Christian, and t hen proceed to do very little for Christ, and everything for Lucifer.

Kurt Billings, an ex-New Age leader now a sincere Christian has been giving his testimon y around the United States , he was a New Ager who infiltrated churches and as a church leader channe led a demon named Jesus.> c. They use Hegelian Dialectics. This di alectic process doesn't happen on its own so it often has to be forced into happening. The idea is that each idea (\"ism\" ) called a \"thesis\", like say Capitalism, naturally by definition has an opposite, an \"antithesis\". In Capitalism the antithesis is Communism. The conflict between the two produce s a synthesis. By controlling both ends of the conflict, one c ontrols the end product, the synthesis. More than not, the One-World-Power can be se en working behind both sides of many conflicts. Indeed, the Secret Societies have been historically shown to be behind all the revolutions and wars in Modern Europe si nce the American Revolution. In religious conflict, both sides are often being manipulated. Some of the various groups openly admit their strategy is desi gned to create a synthes is. You will find Hegelian Dial ectics has been introduced into the U.S. educational system by the Skull & Bones Order (considered an llluminati group). It was adopted in Russia by the Slavophiles in the 19th century. Communism, Nazism, Fabians, most New A ge groups, Liberation Theology, and other parts of the Power use Hegelian Dialectics. Hegel in turn bas ed his system on the ancient Greek atomists espe cially Democritus. d. The New World Order's One-World-Religi on is organized on the SPIN principle. WHAT IS THE SPIN PRINCIPLE? This concept is to be t he topic of this section. S-P-l-N = Segmented Polyce ntric Integrated Networks If one were to diagram a SPIN organizational chart it would not be a conventional box type configuration such as an army co mpany organization chart. Rather, it would resemble a fish-net with interlocking nodes with groups linked to many other groups and cluster around nodes. There is no center to the network. It is like the brain's electrical connections, with an overlap of functions, so that good cells can ta ke over from damaged sections. A network (one of th eir buzzwords) is many time s more greater than the sum of its parts. The New Age author Marilyn Ferguson does an excellent job in describing how the Conspiracy's SPIN network functions. \"This is a source of power nev er before tapped in history: mult iple self-sufficient social movements linked for a whole array of g oals whose accomplishment would transform every aspect of contemporary life. \"Because SPINs are so qualitatively differe nt in organization and impact from bureaucracies...most people don't see them—o r think they are conspiracies. Often networks take similar action without conferri ng with each other simp ly because they share so many assumptions. It migh t also be said that the shared assumptions are the collusion. \"The Aquarian Conspiracy is, in effect, a SPI N of SPINs, a network of many networks aimed at social transformation. The Aquarian Conspiracy is indeed loose, segmented, evolutionary, redundant. Its ce nter is everywhere. Although many social movements and mutual-help groups are repres ented in its alliances, its lif e does not hinge on any of"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"them.\"<#4. Ferguson, Marilyn. The Aquar ian Conspiracy. Los Angeles, CA: J.P. Tarcher. lnc, 1980, p. 217.> Organisationally, the SPIN prin ciple has worked w onders for the llluminati, who are the Illumined Ones who are directed by an angel of light variously call ed Venus, Lucifer, Satan, or Sanat (a scrambli ng of Satan). Different groups have their own preferred name for this Master. Almost withou t fail their literature and art provide enough in each case to positively identify this Being of Light Lucifer as the Ascend ed Master of every Illuminated group. Sources that have been near the top of the hierarchies of these various groups reveal that the \"alliances\" are not as loose as the public pictures them. The top leaders are actually in contact and collusion t ogether. Further, the New Age movement is producing all kinds of organizati onal charts, Yellow Pages, co ordinating councils between groups such as the Unity in Di versity Council, etc. The moveme nt is not as leaderless as the New Age Movement likes to pretend. Further, while their SPIN ne twork is powerful, it is mu ch more manmade and artificial than people can imagine. Groups that supposedl y just materialize out of nothing, are actually funded and promoted from the start by an outside source. While the New Agers pride themselves on t heir SPIN strategy, the followers of Christ have been configured t he same way for centuries. It must be admitted that several interlocking Secret Cults, the Free masons, the CIA (the Company), and MI6 (the Firm) control much of the world. Through allied groups such as the B'ai B'rith (the Order), the Skull and Bones Order (the Order), the KGB, the Triads, the Mafia, the Order of Jesuits (the Company), and th e MOUSSAD their control extends even further. Finally, there ar e a plethora of reli gious groups interwov en into the whole SPIN network. Some like the Universal Aquar ian Church, the Metaphysical Church in America, Light of Christ Community Church, the Institutes for the Enhancement of Life Energy and Creativity (IELEC) in NY, Ch ildren of God's ashr am, and the Church Universal & Triumphant are op enly New Age religious bodies. Unity School of Christianity in Unity Villiage, MO is a training center for the New Ag e where Luciferian initiations have been conducted for years. Lucis Trust functi ons as part of the brain of the New Age movement, and the Findhorn Foundat ion in Scotland is compar able to the Vatican City of the New Age movement. Today the llluminati are also know n by the esoteric (inside) name of Royal Ipsimus (I psimus is Latin for \"Mas ter of the Household.\") It is not impossible to draw diagrams s howing the seed, producing its rotten fruit, producing seed, producing fruit, producing a host of seed, etc. The Spin diagrams in this book are an attempt to begi n showing the development of their SPIN of SPINs. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PSYC & EDUCATION SPINs Let us take for instance, Karl Kasimir Wundt (1744-84), a German professor and member of the Bavarian lllum inati. His son was Maximilian (1787-1846), whose son was William Maximilian Wundt (1832-1920). Wil helm Maximilian Wundt was influenced by Johann Herbart who was a stud ent of Hegelian Dialectics. Herbart's mentors were llluminati. Wilhelm Mazimilian Wundt then in fluenced Daniel Coit Gilman and G. Stanley Hall, who were Americans who went to Ge rmany to study. Daniel Coit Gilman and G. Stanley Hall were very influential to intro duce Hegelian ideas into American education. John Dewey was influenced by Gilman and in turn influenced many other in the American Educational System.<#5.

When one considers some of the other important U.S. educators that learned He gelian ideas from Wundt it is easy to picture how a vast network of interlocking schools of educat ion and departments of psychology were established.

Patrick, of Iowa University 169 C.H. Judd, of the University of Chicago 196 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHURCH UNIVERSAL & TR IUMPHANT NODE Another line of influence by th e llluminati can be seen in the illumination of the leaders of the Continental Masons in the 18th cent ury. Illuminated puppets like the Portugese Jew Martinez de Pasqualis went fr om Germany to France and in itiated various people and started various Secret illumi nated groups. As a result Grand Orient Masonry was illuminated, and so was Co-Masonry on the c ontinent. The illuminatus Giuseppe (Joseph) Mazzini (1805-1872), who belon ged to several Secret Societ ies, the Scottish Rite, the Grand Orient, Carbonari, You ng Italy, Young Ireland, the 1s t Communist International, initiated Helena Petrovna Blavatsky into Carbonar ism (a type of Masonry) in 1856. Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (she went by the initials H.P.B.) had already met the magician mentor of Mazzini in 1848 in Asia Minor. After her initiation by Mazzini, H.P.B. claimed she was illumined by the Hierarchy of the Great White Lodge in 1856. George Felt of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor also wa s a big influence on H.P.B. After 1866, she was also under the influence of the Mason hy pnotist and spiritist Victor Michal.<#7. Que'non, Rene'. Le Theosophisme, 1921, p. 14.> H.P.Blavatsky was also initia ted into the Order of Druses , the Adoptive branch of the Ancient and Primitive rite of Masonry (1877), and the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim. In the Grand Orient Adoptive Ma sonry she held the highest ra nk, a Crowned Princess 12. With the help of the Rosicruc ian Masters, H.P.B started th e Theosophical Society. The socialist and occultist Herbert Burrows, a member of the Stella Matutina (a Masonic occult spinoff from the Golden Dawn), introduced the Co-Mason Annie Be sant to H.P.B. in 1889. In 1887, H.P.B. started a Theosophical magazine called Lucifer the light-bringer. Annie Besant took over the illuminated Theosophical Soci ety. Annie Besant bungled her job in creating a Christ in the early 1920 s, so her job was given to Alice Ann Bailey. Alice Ann Bailey decided (or rubber-stamped) revised secret plans to keep the work low key until 1975. 1975 would be the big year . Meanwhile, she wrote numerous influential"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"books, and in 1922 established Lucifer Publis hing, and Lucifer Trust, later changed to Lucis. Early in the 1930s, a c ouple named Edna and Guy Ballard received illumination, and started the I AM movement. Th e St. Germain Press publishes items such as the monthy periodical The Voice of the I AM. Guy borrows much of his ideas from Alice Bailey, the Rosicrucians, and the Masons. Two of his books Unveiled Mysteries and The Magic Presence sound masonic. His me ssages he received from th e Great White Brotherhood seem like a regurgitation of w hat others had also received. Mark and Elizabeth Clare Prophet began as a spin-off of the I AM movement in the late 1950s. In 1958, they started Summit Univer sity to train initiates of their Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT). The I AM movement feels that CUT stole their picture of S t. Germain, and have started using a different picture in order to a ssert their separateness. Even though they don't cooperate officially, the I AM movement and the Church Universal and Triumphant are nearly identical in beliefs. What has been covered is how the lineage of Illuminati on has been passed down from generation to generation in a series of sp in-offs. Although there is no publicly known connection between the Church Universal and Triumphant and the Masons, it will be worthwhile to examine this mo vement. Although the lineal desc ent is a direct one between CUT and the Masons, few people would on thei r own see any connection between the two.

One of the first items that struck me about Elizabeth Cl are Prophet's Theology is how Masonic it sounded. Since Elizabeth Prophet states she is continue ing the Ballard's work- -not with Mrs. Ballard' s approval though—it is not surpri sing the two groups are alike. But the CUT doesn't talk about an y Masonic connections. Sure th ey sell Masonic books, and they do use the Masonic Temples for their meetings, but th ey make clear to her followers that even though Masonry is O.K., her church is a bi g advancement over Masonic believes. The truth is, her te achings and the Ballard's ar e just a rehash of Masonic beliefs. They even invoke (p ray to) the Masonic All-Seeing -Eye as the Elohim Cyclopea. Their Knight Commander is St. Germain. <#14.

The Great White Brotherhood is the same group that Bailey, H.P.B., the Rosicrucians and the Esoter ic Masons follow. Note , they are following the same authority. The Masonic Book Ancien t Mystic Oriental Ma sonry, (1907) written based on information from the highest Mas onic authorities, stat es on pg. 79, \"THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE. 114 \"T he Ancient Wisdom Religion is the Thread-soul' on which are strung all the various incarnat ions and encasements of the religious life,...Begotten by that Spir itual Hierarchy—the Great White Brotherhood—in whose guardianship is the evolution of the human race...\" The next page tells how the \"Great White Brotherhood\" is known in Ancient Mystic Oriental Mas onry as the 11th degree. (Is this a Blind?) Students of the Supreme Initiation will see \"The Beautiful Philosophy of Initiation,\" by the Count M. de St. Vincent. An Illumined Chief of one of the occult branches of the English Masonic Lodge of Rosicruciana in Anglia— called Stella Matutina— left it, bec ame a Christian. This ex- Chief's book Light-bearers of Darkness clearly deta ils how the lllumina ti (Illumined ones) are lead by the Great White Lodge and that the Illumined ones in that day (1930) were far more powerful than people im agined, and that they were in all kinds of groups. \"These secret societies, formed when needed, are detached into groups dist inct and apparently opposed, professing respectively and in turn the most contrary opinions of the day, so as to direct, apart and with confidence, all parti es, political, religious, economic, and literary.\" (Light-Bearers of Darkness, p.2) Another follower of the occult, Tal Brooke, who was the top Western disciple of India's miracle-working god-man Sai Baba, also lik e the Stella Matuti na chief, became a Christian and also wr ote a book When The World Will Be As One warning people about Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the Fabians, t he New Age agenda and the Masons who are promoting it. The highest Masonic authoritie s teach that illumination li ke Elizabeth Clare Prophet practices was part of the Mystery Religi ons. Elizabeth Clare Prophet often uses the llluminati 3-dot symbol when sh e signs her initial. How ironic that her teachings are being passed off as so fresh and new, yet are the very ancient supe rstitions that men practiced long ago. In the Secret Teachings of All Ages, \"The Mysteries taught that spiritual illumination was attained only by bringing the lower nature up to a certain st andard of efficiency and purity. The Mysteries were ther efore established for the purp ose of unfolding the nature of man according to certain fixed rules which, when fait hfully followed, elevated the human consciousness to a point where it was capable of cognizing its own constitution and the true purpose of existence. This knowl edge...of spiritual illumination constituted the secret, or esoteric doctrine of antiqu ity. Certain apparently physical organs and centers are in reality the veils or sheaths of spiritual center.\"<#17. Hall, The Secret Teachings of All Ages, p. LXXVI.> This is the issue at stake here.

The issue is more important than that. A world-wide authority is being created through the actions of separate nodes of a SPIN of SPINs. This authority plans to someday be absolute.

Hundreds of people who have come out of CUT or had family members in it, are warning that this is a deception that has destroyed people's lives and families. Judging on the basis of where CUT came fr om, who they are friends with, and what Masonic and llluminati tactics are, it is a safe bet that there is some kind of colloboration at the top by Elizabeth Clare Prophet with Secret Societies. Indications are that it is part of a vast scheme to establ ish a One-World-Government. Elizabeth Clare Prophet has no problem ge tting on the radio, and getting publicity. Obviously, she has connections. Although she her alds her own group as the Church, she has appeared with other New Age leaders on r adio talk shows. She does seem to work with them on some level. Her Summit Universi ty, started in 1958<#19. Pearls of Wisdom, on the back pages of for example July, 31,1977 Vol. 20, No.31, Malibu, CA: CUT, p.148.> is not shabby. Her \"Fraternity of Keepers of the Flame\" as she calls her initiates learn such things as astrology, crystals, whit e magic, Hinduism (reincarnation, karma, meditation, chakra points), how to decree, how to dress, and how to become divine at Summit University.

How did her husband and her finance things in the beginning when they established Summit University, and their headquarter s in Colorado Spri ngs, and their house in Santa Barbara? Details about Elizabeth Clare Prophet and her Organization are hard to come by. If she can keep recruiting new people, her finances may do all right. If a person gets serious about being part of her organization, they are expect ed to make a once in a life- time gift of everything they have to the CUT controlled by Elizabeth Clare Prophet.<#21.

Both make a big show of being against the system, the United Nations and the people uniting the world. However, neither group ever mentions the Masons in connection with plans to bring in a one-world-state. The religious side of the One-World-Power can not be understood with out an awar eness of Freemasonry. While supposedly warning their adherents of those men who control the world, both CUT and the WT Society carry out a systematic program to condition their people to believe in a soon-to-come Golden Age, and training people how to act in it. It's this wr iter's conviction that it is not so criticaly dangerous to the One-World-St ate for these people to kn ow something of what is happening, because their leadership, who they blindly follow, are part of the One-World- Religion.

In spite of all the time CUT spends teachi ng its people about the Conspiracy of the Communists, the International Financiers, the CFR, etc. when Elizabeth Prophet makes statements like this above she is shifting the blame for wars and W.W. Ill from those who control the world to the common people. If she only succeeds in this propaganda ploy, she will have accomplishe d a great favor for the One-World-State. The common people of the wo rld are not directing world events. For instance, it was not the common people of either Iraq, Kuwait nor the U.S. that had anything to do with Operation Desert Storm and De sert Shield. In fact, months before Kuwait was invaded the Trilateral Commission had decided at the White House that Iraq was to be the focus of a disarmament program. As not hing was attempted politically, it is clear that they had planned a military di sarmament program. CUT initiates received a letter, \"Keeper of the Flame: the need for harmony and love between all the masters servants united in a common effort cannot be overemphasized.

Lett er by CUT Chairman of the Outreach Committee Mich ael Veys to the Fraternity of the Keepers of the Flame, c. 1980.> CAPTURING BY USING FEAR CUT is a New Age Religion desi gned to catch the conservative elements, that would shun most New Age groups. CUT preaches against Communism, the Feminist Movement, Abortion, Drugs, the Trilateral Commission, t he Bankers, an d uncontrolled immigration from Mexico. It is in favor of su rvivalist tactics, political activism, wearing business suits, and looking clean cut. If one l ooks at where they ha ve concentrated their activities one notices they have worked in some very conservative western areas, Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Ar izona. (California is also an important center of activity but hardly a bastion of conservatism.) When I contemplated the hoax that Church Un iversal and Triumpha nt is apparently carrying out among the conservatives in We stern United States, I was reminded of a fishing trip years ago. In 1969, several Germans and I went out to a small German island in the North Sea. We strung a net across a river, went downstream and entered into the river. We walked upstream to ward the net. The fish were af raid of being caught by us. They swam into the net. We reached the net, pulled the net to shore and filled two large baskets full of big good tast ing flounder. It's one of my favorite fishing trips. The people in the Western U.S. are like these flounder. They are aware that big powers are trying to control their lives. They are tr ying to get away from the One-World-State Power. And so what do they do ? They swim right into the very conservative CUT, and are easy pickings for the One-World-Religion. To gain the great advantages of Hege lian Philosophy— the One-World-Power has been behind both extremes. Bu t this can only work if the people being deceived and manipulated, don't realize that the same people are behind different groups."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"129 "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"130 One thing that Elizabeth Clare Prophet ma y be commended upon, it is her willingness to give some of the best occult knowledge to her followers.

They know that Sh amballah is the region of the hollow earth. The spiritual region where the Ki ng of the World and his Master dwell.\" The Spirit Masters have told the hi ghest level occultists who are sold out to them that the earth is hollow. For instance, Pam Davis was to ld by a spirit, \"Do you not know that the center of your Earth, it is not that which has been spoken by your scientists, the bubbling of the molten rocks, it is beauteous. It is home for thousands upon thousands of Beings that have lived there in tota lity of harmony and understanding of love.\" (\"The Power of One,\" Life Times (Winter 86/87), p. 84.) Elizabeth Clare Prophet is infatuated with the Great Pyramid lik e H.P.B. and C.T. Russell. She has produc ed an illustrated program with 8 cassettes entitled A Retreat on the Ascension, which includes lectures on the inner mysteries of the Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid has long been held by esoter ic groups as an initiation center. Some confidential sources speak of gaining godlike pow er from the pyramid. The occult leaders of the One World Power have held that the Great Pyramid's Ki ng's chamber is an initiation center for godhood.

They basically are another Gnostic Mystery Cult Whether one identifies CUT as having the I AM movement's beliefs, or Masonry's, or the Gnosti c Mysteries is perhaps moot, they are all about the same. Let's look at some of the similarity of CUT with Masonry before CUT was even thought of. ITEMS OF SIMILARITY- THE TR IBE OF MANASSEH IS THE USA The first item of similarity between Eliz abeth Clare Prophets teachings and Masonry is the belief that the Tribe of Ephraim is Great Britian and the Tribe of Manasseh is America.<#34. Notes from a local CUT meetings.> In the Masonic book, Mystic Americanism we are told The theme of the entire Bible centers around a ho pe of a glorious country afar off, in an age that was to come. The crowning event of the allegory of the Twelve Tribes of Isra el—the one and one-half tribe of Jewish and the rest Christian origin—cul minates in Manasseh (America) and Ephraim (Christ's Kingdom) as sons of Joseph (Great Britian). Most im portant of all is the story of the Woman (Revelation: 12) who fled into t he wilderness (secrecy)' but who is to return and, in a glorious nation, de feat the Dragon by reopening the ancient teachings of the Holy Grail (Illumination of the Soul).\"<#35.

For instance, the British Royal Family which has been prominant in Freemasonry and believes in British-lsraelis m,<#37. Numerous Masonic sources parade the lists of Kings, Princes, etc. that are Masons.

Cecil Rhodes, who believed the One-World-State would be British, included Lo rd Rothschild on his roundtabl e. The Mormon leaders, who believe in British-lsraelism, have had close relations with the Jews, and although they should know better, have totally ignored th e fact that the Aske nazim Jews are not genetically related to the Ch ilden of Israel. They apply prophecy to those Jews because they are supposedly the right seed, and then ignore the hist orical evidence they never were genetically that seed.<#38. LDS Mc Conkie's writings on prophecy.> Even the Mormon leaders who have access to the world's genealogi cal records, are pro-Askinazim Jew. Elizabeth Clare Prophet's teachings have been a welter of c ontradictions. While condeming the Bavarian llluminati in talks, she also has taught about how great Sir Francis Bacon, who she believes started Mas onry, is. She points out to her people how the Masonic Temples have the words I AM on them, to support her I AM beliefs.<#39. Notes from a CUT class.> In 1723, Dr. Abadie, a protestant apologist, put forth the view that the lost ten tribes were the people of the Brit ish lsles.<#40. Gaebelein, Dr. A.C. World Prospects, cf. Gaebelein's art. in Our Hope, Jan. 1932 i ssue.> However the idea predated Abadie by half a century. Oliver Cromwell was convince d that the British were Israelites. He was not only active in Masonry, but was the person wh o brought the Jews back to England in 1655, after their expulsion. Some contend it was money that motivated Cromwell to bring the Jews to England. Interestingly, it was the discovery of Jews in China by the Jesuits that allowed Cromwell to justify allowing Jews into England. Rabbi ben Israel who lived across the street from Rembrandt in Amsterdam corre sponded with Cromwell. (The Rabbi was also responsible for the philos opher Spinoza's educati on. Spinoza made his own contribution to the moral demise of We stern Civilization.) T he Rabbi brought out the phamplet \"Spes Israelis\" (latin for \"The Hope of Israel\" or in Heb. \"M ikveh Israel\"). Using a Biblical passage that the Je ws were to be found at two ends of th e earth, and declaring the recently found Chinese Jews as one end, he argued that Biblica lly the other end of the earth was...Portugal (well, at first it was Portugal—but then the Rabbi realized 131"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"132 England had more commercial profit potential so he reworded his trac t to say...)England. Yes, the Rabbi declared that Biblically the Jews were at both ends of the earth, and since England had no Jews then the British must be Jewish. If Jewish, then how could they forbid other Jews from comi ng in. Since then, others have built on the Rabbi's idea. The dual marriage of Jacob with his wives Leah and Rachel was referred to as \"two bands\" (Gen. 32:10). These are the \"two sticks\" that the Mo rmons,<#41.

The United States began with such settlers as the Pilgrims who were British, therefore Ephrai mites. This particular version seems illogical. Another version is that that the sons of Joseph (Great Br itian) culminate in Manasseh (America) and Ephraim (Christ' s Kingdom). This last idea ca rries an eerie aura about it to this Author. The symbology of the Tribe of Manasseh is the Olive Branch and the Arrows (associated with Joseph's bow).<#43.

The best book in showing archeological evidence concerning the fate of the ten tribes of Israel is Missing Links Discovered by E. Raymond Capt.

FITS A PATTERN There are some people who will be disatisfied with this chapter. They will want harder proof. Yet, these same people very likely accept many things without any proof. If they didn't they wouldn't be part of mainstream America. For instance, you are told that this c ountry is a democracy. Democracy means the people vote and decide everything. Everything in a real democracy is decided by what is called a referemdum today. Very little is decided by referemdum today. Has anyone shown you proof this is a demo cracy? Have you ever asked? I have found that those who object to this information are those who have not studied the subjects at all. CUT. fits a pattern that has been repeated over and over. Either it is part of the pattern which can be shown to be Masonic or it's an exception to the rule. If CUT. is really against the Ne w World Order (it depends what part of their literature you read, because they do want a Global Inter dependence of Spiritual Ones, they only claim to be against a Global Political Union), it is interesting that the sy stem cooperates with them so much. On the surface they appear to some to be against the CFR/lnternat ional Bankers, etc. They teach their members t he dangers that these men po se in conjunction with international communism. On the otherhand in their tract \"What is The Summit Lighthouse?\" they end the tract saying \"The Summit Lighthouse s heds its beams o'er the earth and releases into manifestation the symbol for the coming Golden Age—\"Destiny, not dust!\" Unless a person is aware of th e connections between the Rockefellers and the Masons and the New Age movement, the common person will not be able to see Hegelian dialectics being used. While conservatives join CUT., it is not likely very many of them caught a little clause that CUT. put into its Christmas Day, 1981 De claration of International Interpendence. Line 8 from the bottom st ates, \"Therefore, as divinely ble ssed individuals...the citizens of planet Earth have the right...to call for a co nstitutional convention to found their nation under God;...\" Elizabeth Prophet has repeatedl y stated Sanat Kumara was the leader of the Great White Lodge Hi erarchy and God.<#48 Just one example of many where Sanat (Satan) is identified as a God by Elizabeth Clare Prophet is her 19 79 Christmas message, p. 2. \"Yes, my chelas have sung for you and for me the message of Sanat Kumara, the Great Bodhisattva, known to Daniel and the pr ophets of Israel as the Ancient of Days.

U.T. is the John Birch Society. Both groups are so conservative th at they stick out as extreme. El izabeth Clare Prophe t likes the John Birch Society and speaks good things about it. The John Birch Society was created as the Anti-thesis of communism , much in the same way t hat C.U.T. siphons off the conservative element that dislikes long hai r and dirty clothes, etc. but theologically is attracted to the New Age. A 32 degree Mason named Robert Welch<#50. Braddock, James E. The John Birch Society An Enigma.

For the Board of Directors for the John Birch Society he chose men from the Council of Foreign Relations (CFR). As JBS policy, he had an Anti -communist but pro-Jewish stance.

The Jo hn Birch Society was able to siphon off much resistance that could have been really damaging to the One-World- Power, and waste that concern and money of resistance into a make-believe battle against communism. Many of the highly knowledgeable people who jo ined the John Birch Society, such as Dr. R.P. Oliver, Dr. Draskovich, Brig. Gen. G.

Helena P. Blavatsky (or H.P.B. as she called herself)(1831-1891) was sponsored by several occult groups to get the Theosoph ical Society started. A small group of Rosicrucian adepts were the primary sponsors of hers. The Great White Brotherhood was lurking in her background too. The Theosophical Society is also called Co-Masonry. Many of the leaders of the Theosophical Society have been wo men involved in the occult Masonic groups that admit women, and men who have been part of Masonry. (See the Appendix.) In the book On The Watch-Tower by Sri Ram we are told that the Theosophical Society was working to unite Europe into one United States of Eur ope (p.570) and that eventually the only solution fo r mankind was a Federation of all the nations.(p. 571) The Primer of Theosophy states th at the T. Society wa s started for two reasons a. to study Occultism and b. to spread Universal Br otherhood.<#53. American Section of the Theosophical Society. A Primer of Theos ophy. Chicago, IL: The Rajput Press, 1911, p.110.> The theosophical book A Primer of Th eosophy tells us that \"There are two presentations of the divine wisdom which are rounded and satisfyi ng; that given by Theosophy and that of Masonry. No religion or exoteric philosophy can equal them in fullness or clearness.\"<#54. ibid., p. 61.> WHO SHALL HEAD THE WOLRD GOVE RNMENT THAT THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY WANTS? Interestingly, the Theosophical Society feels that Freemasonr y and itself teach the clear divine wisdom. H.P. Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society tells us that the God of the Bible is \"a tribal Go d and no more\"<#55 Blavatsky, H.P. Collected Writings, Vol. 8.

Los Angeles: Theosophy Co., 1925, p. 386. H.P. Blavatsky, a Jewess, tells us, \"Once the key to Genesis is in our hands, the scientific and symbolical Kabbal a unveils the secret. The Grea t Serpent of the Garden of Eden and the \"Lord God\" are identical.\"— The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2, p. 132. \"Satan, the Serpent of Genesis is the real creator and benefact or, the Father of Spiritual mankind.

H.P.B. and her Society hate the Christians who they see as \"fighting against divine truth, when repudiating and slandering t he Dragon of Esoteric Divine Wisdom.\"—The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 3, p.376. When we study further we discover that the glob al initiation spoken of by the T.S. is a Luciferian initiation, and the Second Co ming of Christ means that a \"Christ consciousness\" of m an's divinity returns to the human race. Although people who follow the Theosophica l Society initially may join for personal development or enlightment and do not realize the ultimate go al, the ultimate goal of the Theosophical Society is a O ne-World-Government with H.P.B.'s \"Lord God\" ruling. Christians refer to her God as Satan, the Devil. MASONS & THE T.S. Manly P. Hall, 33° Mason, was an important Theosophical leader. He could really pack the audiances in when he spoke to their gr oups. Many Anglo-American Masons study Theosophy. Theosophic books are placed into the Masoni c Libraries. Theosophy is another way to describe Hinduism, or the Ne w Age teachings. A vi sit to a Theosophic Library will reveal that they carry books on witchcraft, Judaism , as well as all the various topics of the Ne w Age movement. T.S.'S INNER CIRCLE & DIVISIONS The E.S. or Esoteric Section, also known as the Eastern School of Theosophy is the inner secret circle. This inner ci rcle has itself several levels. The Theosophical Society divi ded into two competing gro ups. The major group has its international headquarter in Ma dras, India with its American headquarters in Wheaton, II. The other group had its head quarters in Covina, CA an d also in San Diego, CA. The American Theoso phical Society has its Quest Pu blishing house at Wheaton. Interestingly, the name Manly P. Hall gives the to the Order wh ose job is to preserve the plans for the take over of the world is called by him the Order of the Quest. The Theosophical library at Wheaton called the Olcott Library and Research Cent er is one of the best occultic collections anywhere."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The two Theosophical Societies have made their greatest impacts in the British nations U.K/Can./Aust./N.Z./lndia and the United States. They have also been very popular in the Scandinavian countri es and Germany. Episcopalian clergymen have been active in both Theosophical groups. Alice Ann Bailey who took over the leadership in t he 1920s, had taught in the Episcopalian church and was married to an Episcopal rector. Alice Ba iley did as much for Theosophy as did H.P.B. Bailey is still influencing our cultur e today. She felt the number 666 was sacred. One of the Theosophical Society' s publications is Lucifer. Bail ey started Lucifer Trust now called Lucis Trust.

The Watchtower Society has a number of teac hings, symbols, etc. that match up with the Theosophical Society's. More about these later. PROMINENT THEOSOPHICAL LEADERS Two prominent leaders that we re involved with the Theosop hical Society were Mahatma Gandhi and Adolf Hitler. Mahat ma Gandhi was interested in learning about Christianity until H.P.B., who pretended to be a Christian c onvinced him Hinduism had more to offer. Gandhi joined the Theosophical Society. The impetus for India's independence to a large degree came from the Theosophical Soci ety. Ann Besant the second Theosophical President was instrumental in changing British attitudes. I ndia's political leadership has been closely connected with the Theosophical Society ever since independence, including several Gandhis and Jawaharlal Nehru. Hitler learned much of his occult knowle dge from the Theosophical Society, although credit needs to be given to his occult ment ors at the Benedictine monastery school who got him off onto the occult trail. Hitler spent much of his time in occult bookstores l earning metaphysics. He also had several adepts in white and black magic instru ct him. In Vienna, Hitler jo ined a modern German version of the Knights Templars, a German Maso nic group called \"The Order of the New Templars.\" The swastika wa s their emblem. The Theosoph ical Society even today continues to use t he swastika as one of their emblems. The Theosophical Society has also included such genius in ventors as the co-workers Thomas Edison and Nichola Tesl a. It has included such writ ers as George Bernard Shaw and William Bu tler Yeats. It is possible that the Dalai Lama is also associat ed with them. Elvis Presley was a Theosophist.

The Sufis have secret societies around the world and rule in most of the Arab states. T here are now about 14 million Ahmadis who give tota l allegience to whoever hold s the position that Rahmat Ahmad is to inherit. His titl e translates \"Successor of Mess iah.\" Why might the New World Order pick Rahmat Ahmad to be their Ki ng/Priest? The Sufi Moslems are tied to Freemasonry, the Knights Templars, and the Theosophic Soci ety. A visit to a Theosophical Society Library will allow the reader to see t hat they have a good selection of books on Sufism. Sufism is a mysticism that holds that man can become illuminated and divine. Although it is call ed Moslem, it has no more to do with the Moslem religion than the Rosicrucians have to do with Christia nity. Sufism is New A ge mysticism, similar to Hinduism. It is reported that Col. Quadda fi of Libya is a Sufi or a Sufi supporter. When Quaddafi when came to power, he repressed the Mosl em clergy, even shut down a few mosques and made the moslem clergy subservient to him.

The Buddhists are looking for a Lord Maitreya (the fifth Buddha) to re turn. Some of the Jews are looking for a Messiah, and the Shiit e Muslims are looking for Imman Madhi. The Hindus are expecting the Bodhisattva (Kal ki) or Krishna. The Tara Center, which promotes the Lord Maitreya, hopes to pl ay upon all these va rious expectations. Great expense and great plans ar e to be used to c onvince the world of his divinity. The Establishment media is ready to be used fo r promoting Lord Maitreya. A number of indicators seemed to indicated that the new messiah would have a Je wish Lineage of the House of David. If Rhamat Ahm ad is not of the House of Da vid, and it appears he isn't, then it may well be that Ahmad is not the priz ed leader that they plan to set up as a King/Priest. The Tara Center often uses the pyramid wi th the all-seeing eye which is a masonic symbol. The Tara Center ha s ties to Freemasonry. Ta ra worship is linked to Freemasonry, and has been practiced by the Dr uids and the Hindus. Ta ra Hill in Ireland is a worship center for Druid worship. The Tara center believes in a One-World- Socialist government with revitalized Freemasonry as the world's reli gion. People are being told man will become divine under this New World Order. (Sadly, the truth is they will become slav es. And slaves of Satanists have been t he most pitilessly abused slaves of all.) SUMMARY The New World Order has a Pakistani man named Rhamat Ahmad ready to be revealed as the Lord Maitreya. His identity has been a secret only known to a handful of men. The New Agers, the Masons, and the Sufi, and some of the Buddhists can be counted on to worship him, if the Power de cides to go ahead and use him.

What the symbolic meaning of this strange Winged-S un-Disk with snakes was not explained. Obviousl y, the meaning was for thos e \"in the know\" and not the casual reader. The author of \"Studies in the Scriptur e\" spoke of a Golden Age to come. He capitalized in bo ld underlined letters on each volume's title page THE GOLDEN AGE OF Russell had a fold out chart in the front of Vol. 1 about the Great Pyramid. | was unaware of who Russell was, and unable to realize the im plications of all this. I do, however, remember those first im pressions as a Christian in high school \"this is weird.\" Where did all these strange beliefs come from? It doesn't take much to pique the curiosity of my research oriented mind. My teenage mind was al ways from early on searching in an effort to learn, checking out Plato, John Dewey, Will Durant, Mahatma Gandhi, and many other philosop hers and religious leaders. As a youngster, I was always asking why? The curious can have a field day with th e Jehovah's Witnesses. For instance, why call one's meeting place a hall? why not Ki ngdom meeting, or Kingdom assembly, or Kingdom study, or church, or chapel, or taber nacle, or temple, or something else? why hall?"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Why all the secrecy? Why ar e the writers and leaders of the Watchtower Society clouded in secrecy? Why have no membership records been kept? The answer given, that it was a security measur e in case of persecution di dn't satisfy me. Why? Because other groups equally persecuted made other c hoices, choices that are not secretive. Others said, we trust God and are willing to su ffer for Him, so why be secretive? What have we to hide? The choice to be secretive is just that, a choice, a decision. And it was made at the top of the Watchtower pyramid, by the Watchtower President, and now by the Governing body. And this secret ive attitude permeates down the pyramid to the rank and file Jehovah's Witnesses. \"I was interested in possibly joining t he Jehovah's Witnesses,\" a stranger related to this author in a chance conversation, \"but when I a rrived at the Kingdom Hall, the meeting had begun. They had lo cked the door, there were no windows, and I didn't want anything to do with a secr etive religion like that.\" The answer to where Jehovah's Witnesse s receive their str ange beliefs, strange doctrines, and attitudes comes primarily from two men. Bec ause primarily only two men, Charles Taze Russell and Joseph F. Rutherford made all the decisions of the Watchtower Society for the beginning sixty years. Ray Franz who was an import ant Governing Body member stated that the first two Watchtower Bible and Tract Soci ety Presidents \"acted acco rding to his own perogatives in exercising his presidential authority, with no hint of a governing body.\" 2 Since these two WT leaders, two other Presidents hav e served, Knorr and Franz. But while Knorr administrated, Frederick Franz was the real religious leader. Governing Body member Klein referred to Fred Franz as their \"oracle.\" But today their oracle is 97 years old, blind, and only a figurehead. How does the researcher attempt to understand these problems and men? Some of this Author's conclu sions after years of research, is that there are certainly many pitfalls to investigat ing secretive organizations. Material written by secret ive organizations for the public 's consumption are often loaded with fictictious information. Modern Masonic writer s are quite frank that the early Masonic writers when wr iting about the lodge ar e not to be trusted. 3 Not every Mason author identifies himself as a Mason. The Ma sons have lied to show their legitimacy and antiquity. The Jehovah's Witnesses have done si milar things, but hav e also deceived to gloss over doctrinal controversies, emba rrassing scandals, anythi ng that doesn't square with the image of being God's selfless, pristine perfect organization. Periodically they rewrite their history to match \"present tr uth.\" The WT Society has been taken to task numerous times for scholastic dishonesty. Anyone familiar with the Mormon murders has a chance to know the elaborate deception the LDS (Mormon) church leaders have gone to, to preserve their power. 4 As the reader will discover, Masons and Mormons are given latitude to explore religious thought, within the limits given them, but the power and integrity of the leadership is an off-limits subject. Two insiders close to the top of LDS pyramid of power, Frank J. Cannon and John C. Bennett, revealed in their books some of the high-level workin g of the LDS church. 5 LDS members were forbidden to quote their sensitive material. Both Masonic and non-Masoni c writers often have an in correct view that all Freemasons have a common purpose, common beliefs, and common methods.

He may have only experienced the lodge in term s of a philanthropic fraterni ty, and has not bothered to study what Freemasonry has done historically, or what the higher levels reveal. Like army-grunts in the field, they have no knowledge of the high-level planning. The Masons have clouded their activities . The higher degree s are called \"side degrees\" and they claim the hi gher degree aren't higher, but simply on the side. The truth seeker has to work his way through these ruses. How does one investigate the strange mas onic connections of the Watchtower Society, the Mormons, and other religious groups? It's like being a policeman who comes upon a suspicious car accident. If he rules it \"an accident\", rather than a homicide, he will limit his approach in gathering clues. On the other hand, if he assumes th e worst and views it as a homic ide, he will collect all the evidence he can. This book is an attempt to gather evidence. Yes, the fact that the policeman gathers facts means he's suspicious. It doesn't me an anyone is guilty. For instance, just because C.T. Russell was a Mason, doesn't mean Jehovah's Witnesses today join Masonic Orders. Now this Author can not actu ally take the reade r through all the hoo ps of research he has jumped through to ge t to his conclusions. But he can pass some of it along in this book, along with his conclusions. This Author has concluded that t he following statement of Manly P. Hall, a powerful Mason who wa s on the secret world council of thirteen, 6 is an accurate reflection of t he power that the Masonic mystery religions feel they have. \"Under new names and, to a measure, with new interpretation, the old wisdom which guided the destinies of ancient peoples is being reconsidered and restored. It becomes increasingly more evident that wisd om and understanding alone can can bestow the security and happiness which all men still seek as the foundation of a useful life. The shadowy forms of the venerate d sages and prophets of the Golden Age rise again, inviting our appreciation. Though long exiled fr om the sphere of mortal purposes, these noblest of men are being re-established as th e great teachers of the human race. The mystery religions of antiquity, which flouris hed long before the rise of the modern way of life, have been brought in to clear focus by prog ressive leaders in the fields of psychology and comparitive religion.\" 7 Manly P. Hall is correct in that Hindui sm is presented today under a new name \"New Age Movement.\" And true, the Hindu forms of pr ayer, Yoga and Tr anscendental Meditation have a new interpretation, they ar e exercises to practi ce. And the venerated sages of Hinduism and Witc hcraft have risen (and fallen like the \"Bhagwan Shree\" Rajneesh and Krishnamurti, and like New Age leaders Jim Jones an d Adolf Hitler). However, progressive leaders have not brought the New Age movement into focus. That is why this book is needed. The author's experiences in New Delhi, Indi a were a real pictur e of the end result of the New Age beliefs. There are many clues around.

For those readers who are interested in stories of power, fo r those who do not want to be compliant servants of a New Worl d Order, this book is written for you. Dedicated to those whose love of truth an d freedom led them to pay the ultimate sacrifice, death. Let's start by an examination of those three mysterious it ems of the founder of the Watchtower Society, Charles Taze Russell. Those were th e winged-sun-disk, pyramids and the Golden Age to come. It is disconcerting to find that these items are three notable things discussed in Manly P. Half's cl assic reference book on esoteric Masonic knowledge, The Secret Teachings of All Ages. As we flip through Manly P. Hall's book page after page refer to a coming future Golden Age. We also stum ble upon the winged- sun-disk (on page XLIX) which is explained as a solar trinity, and represents the various sun Gods of the ages. At leas t eight pages discuss pyramids in detail, especially the Great Pyramid that Pa stor C.T. Russell wr ote so much about. On page XLIII appears a Great Pyramid drawing from Pia zzi Smyth, C.T. Russell's mentor. It is well established that Smyth was the mentor of the Watchtower Society's experts on the meaning of the Great Pyramid. Smyth was the source of both Manly P. Hall's esoteric Great Pyramid knowledge and C.T. Russell and the Edgar br others' (well known WT lecturers on the Great Pyramid) knowledge. IDEAS DON'T COME OUT OF A VACUUM When something new appears it is good fo r us to remember there is nothing new under the sun. I illustrated that point with a perso nal anecdote in my previous book The Watchtower & The Masons. (This book Be Wi se As Serpents is going to go over some of the same material on the Watchtower Societ y as my previous book , but this time more details and better explanat ions will be brought to bear on the subject.) Perhaps the reader can think of his or her own experience that taught him how we derive our ideas from sources, and not from out of a vacuum. I marvel at how much continuity a modern people have with their ancestors. This point was highlighted one day. I was studying some ancient Egypti an cursive handwriting from the 19th Dynasty while wait ing for my meal in a restau rant. My sample of cursive called hieratic was about 3,300 years old. An arab approached me and st arted a conversation, becaus e he thought I was reading Arabic. That caused me to reflect. The Egyp tians had been conquered by the Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, and had gone through using various scripts, yet they choose in relatively modern times to use the Arabic script which resembles hieratic. The word choose here is used on the premise peo ple are responsible for their own actions. People tend to build, to adapt old ideas. Peop le tend to borrow rather than create new. (As I did with this paragraph from from my earlier book.) When we see something \"new\" arrive in history, such as the alphabet, then it is valid to question where \"new\" ideas have come from. In the case of an alphabet, one look s for clues as to when it was introduced. \"New\" ideas rarely co me from a vacuum."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"If the researcher tracks down where Charle s T. Russell's ideas come from he is led to a source that was a co mmon source of other religions too. The researcher begins to see patterns, and to realize that religions stemming from the source of Russell all have a common goal. The rank and file of these grou ps are of course unaware of much of this, and are unwittingly contri buting to a master plan. RUSSELL & THE WINGED SUN DISK In 1910, Russell made his second trip to the Egyptian pyra mids. He went inside the Great Pyramid. When he retu rned, he inform ed the readers of the Watchtower magazine about the Pyramid's hidden messa ge. He also instituted some big changes to the binding of his books. His Studies in th e Scriptures received the Eg yptian trinity Winged-Sun-Disk on their covers, and the other Watchtower books also received it. He also at the same time made an effort to look international stamping the bi nding of the covers either \"London and Brooklyn\" or \"Brooklyn and London\". Another religious leader, Helena Petrov na Blavatsky, leader of the Theosophical Society, also used the Win ged-Sun-Disk. She by coincidence also started putting it on her magazines Theosophy in 1912. She had also made a pilgrimage to the Great Pyramid, and like Russell had to go in and explore the passa geways and chambers herself. She spent an entire night alone in the heart of the Great Pyramid in the King's chamber."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"5 INTERLINKED CONCEPTS OF THE SERPENT "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Theosophical Society had a branch in Pittsburgh when Russell lived there, and also in Brooklyn where Russell reestablished. It would be hard to conceive that Russell never came into contact with this group. Especially since he writes about them, and mentions contact with Theosophists. Interest ingly the man who was famous in the Irish Lodge of Theosophy was George W. Russell, w ho wrote for The Iris h Theosophist. The Golden Dawn was a Society and the name of that Society' s magazine that was started by a Mason in 1887. The Irish, especially Geor ge Russell, were attracted to this order and its Temple of Isis. The Temp le of Isis used the Winged -Sun-Disk over its portals. The tie-in with Masonry, the New Age, and the Theoso phical Society is a close one. The Scottish Rite started the modern Rosicrucians who star ted HP. Blavatsky off with the Theosophical Society. 8 They financed her and her constant travels. The Grand Master of the Brotherhood of Lux or recommended H.P.B to Olcott with a letter written in gold ink on green paper. 9 Olcott, himself an active Mason, suggested to H.P.B. that they start the Theosophical Society using their group of Masons, Rosicrucians, Cabalists, and Spiritualists that were meeting in a NY apartment. 10 The Scottish Rite also has published for over 100 years the New Age magazine, and has promoted the New Age Movement from the Masonic Lodges.

More on the meaning of Watchtowers and the parallels between the W. S. and the T.S. later. WHERE THE SYMB OL CAME FROM The investigator will find si milar winged-globes in the pagan mystery religions of the Middle East, but this representation of the Winged-Sun-Disk originates in ancient Egypt. The meaning is derived from Ancient Egypt, and stands for Osirus (the Sun God), Horus, and Isis. Those who study Egyptian Ma gic and practice it toda y use the symbol for its purported magical properties. \"Emb lematic of the element of air, this consists of a circle or solar-type disk enclosed by a pair of wings. In ritual ma gic it is suspended over the altar in an easterly direction and used when invoking the protection and co-operation of the sylphs.\" So says an expert on such magi c in his book Practical Egyptian Magic. 15 According to a book used by the Church of Illumination (Rosicrucian) to instruct on their teachings, \"The Winged Globe is pr e-eminently a Rosicrucian symbol, although the llluminati may lay some claim to it, and it may be admitted that it is of Egyptian origin. The Winged Globe is the symbol of the perfected soul making its flight back to the source of its creation in Elysian fields beyond.\" 16 It is also said to be the \"house of many mansions\", that is the God-like reasoning that man supposedly has. 17 If one investigates further back into Rosi crucian thought one finds that the German llluminati used the Winged-Sun-Disk. The us e of the magic symbol goes back to the Kabbalah. The Kabbalists use it to portray Jehovah. However, their full explanation of who Jehovah is, is that Jehovah is the sun-god. He is to the Kabbalists the same as the Gnostic sun-god Demiurgus or the Greek almighty God Zeus , which name at times is used interchangably with Je hovah. The Jewish mystical thought that pervades Rosicrucian thinking then is seen in an illustra tion of a secret 16th Century Rosicrucian book Die Goldene Zeit (The Go lden Age) which portrays the Winged disk with the magical Tetragrammaton in t he sun globe's center."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"From the sources quoted, the reader has learned that the llluminati and Rosicrucians use the Winged-Sun- Disk. What about the Masons? Illustration from the secret 16th cent ury Rosicrucian book The Golden Age. MASONIC USE OF THE WINGED-SUN-DISK Upon achieving the 32 degree, the Mason is given Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma. It is now from the Pope of Masonry, Albert Pike, that th e Mason learns that Phallic worship is the true worship of Maso nry. However, an ex amination of Phallic worship, which is the worship of the regenerative parts is t he same as sun worship, the sun being the symbol of regeneration. 18 The worship of the sun has often been sexual in its ritual. The Elysian fiel ds that the Sun Trinity-the Winged Solar Disk represents are sexual rituals. Masonry itself claims to perpe tuate the ancient mysterie s of Isis and Osiris, Tammuz and Baal 19 which are Sun religions that ulti mately are derived from a single common origin. In Albert Churchward's (30° Mason) book Signs and Symbols of Primordal Man, The Evolution of Religious Do ctrines from the Eschatology of the Ancient Egyptians, he states that the Winged-Sun-Disk is used by 33 degree Masons. The 33rd degree is the highes t public level of the Scotti sh Rite Masons. There are both honorary and actual operative 33 de gree Masons. Notable persons, such as Presidents and leading clergy men are initiated into t he 33rd degree. According to Churchward they alone know its meaning. Ho wever, exposure to the symbol is almost unavoidable to those Masons re ading Theosophic literature. \"That's the sun disk Ra,\" exclaimed an active 32 degree Mason when this Author flashed Russell's cover of th e Studies in the Scriptures. \"It's a Masonic symbol,\" this Author chimed in. \"No, it's not a Masonic symbol,\" came the reply. \"How did you know what it was?\" Complete silence. He had immediately re cognized the symbol but refused to talk about it, or his knowledge about it. According to the Masonic oa th they aren't to talk about Masonic knowledge. QUESTIONS & OBJECTIONS Some will object that if Russell went to Egypt he may have got the symbol from Egypt, and not from esoteric Masonic-connected groups.

Visitors to the exhibit can view the Winged-Sun-Disk at the top above each door an d on the far side or rear panals. However, in drawing representations of this over their temples the Egyptians employed a variety of styles. The snakes may look like vipers or cobras, and may even be dropping down rather than looking out from the sun disk . In researching what books were available to Russell, an d what live Egyptian drawings Russell could have studied of the Osirus, Isis, and Horus trinity, it is th is Author's conclusion t hat he would have seen a variety of representations. None of which he used. However, he did follow basically the way the esoteric Ma sonic groups drew it, so consequen tly his source was most likely an esoteric source. Illustrations from references of C.T. Russell's day showing the Winged-Sun-Disk are provided to document the variety of choice. Some have speculated that the Winged-S un-Disk is an angel's wing like a Cherub. This is an uninformed guess. A cl ose look at copies of Russell's books in excellent condition will reveal that there are snakes on each side of the disk. Further, Russell passes up ways to use it as an angel. It is undoubtedl y the Winged-Sun-Disk on his books. WHAT DOES C.T. RUSSELL & THE WT SOCIETY HAVE TO DO WITH THE SUN-GOD? Surprisingly, there are a number of clues th at show C.T. Russell did believe in a Sun deity. Russell spoke about Zorastor as a true prophet (WT '06, p. 14). Zoroaster, was considered to be the Sun Go d by his followers. Cyrus t he Great, who name meant the Sun, was considered by his gnostic followers to be the Sun-God. Russell thought Cyrus the Great was a prefiguring of Jesus Christ. Russell in fact believed the Resurrected Jesus was at the ce nter of the Sun. Russell never left himself without a scriptu re to explain whatever he decided to believe. Mal. 4;2 refers to \"But to you who fear My name, The Sun of Righteousness shall arise With healing in His wing s; and you shall go out And gr ow fat like stall-fed calves.\" Russell at various times gave various inte rpretations to Mal. 4:2. A comprehensive examination shows he said the Sun of Righteousness is 1) Jesus and his church SYMBOLOGY OF THE MYSTERY RELIGIONS After reading thousands of pages on the My stery religions, dozens of Masonic books on their religious symbology, various books on the mythic images of mankind globally, and the Christian scriptures it wa s clear that 5 concepts repe atedly have been interlinked with each other on a worldwi de basis and that each of thes e 5 interlinked ideas has also been represented by the conc ept of a serpent, a snake."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"[place diagram here] It is understandable how man in various areas could see the stars, the closest star the Sun, and fire and worship these items.

The Egyptian priests that taught the people sun worshi p in Moses' day were monoth eistic. This monotheistic god was the Light-bearer. To understand the significance of pyramids to Masons (and New A gers in general) we can show how pyramids, especially in particu lar the Great Pyramid of Giza, relates to these 5 interlocked concepts. The Great Pyramid is important to Masons according to Masonic sources because: a. An initiate (then and now) after entering the Great Pyramid leaves as a god. (light— bearer/godhood on chart) b. The Great Pyramid is said to be prophetic when its passageways are measured. (wisdom) c. Sun worshippers built the Great Pyramid.(sun worship) d. All pyramids are said to emit special energy. e. Pyramids are an architectural picture of an ascended flame to heaven.(fire) f. The pyramid's upward triangle shape st ands for the male generative principle. When the Masons Charles T. Russell and H.P. Blavatsky made their pilgrimages to the Great Pyramid and went into the King's chambe r it is possible the si gnificance of their visits included the ab ove a through f items. The philosophy behind the my stery religions, Freemasonry , Theosophy, Gnosticism and the New Age movement continue the idea that man should seek out the fruit of the tree of good and evil for it shall make him a god. These religious philosophies also declare that \"true\" Christianity (cos mic or New Age Christianity) is also this gn ostic quest for enlightenment. 20 Many Gnostic religions hate traditional Christianity. They have also over the years criticized biblical Christianity for holding mankind back from find ing his quest for godhood. For several upcoming pa ragraphs we will cont rast Christianity wi th the gnostic quest for enlightment. We will refer to the head adve rsary of the Creator, what the scriptures call \"...the dragon, that serpent of ol d, the devil, or Satan.\" Rv 20:1 Some readers will hold the view that Satan and demons don't exis t. They are free to speculate that, but there is no way to prove their speculatio n. On the other hand, it is easy to substantiate an objective belie f in demons by examining the countless testimonies, etc. about them. J.W. Montgomery in Principalities and Powers, written after years of research into the existence of demons, conclude d, \"The problem involved in determining whether demon possession occurs and whether witchcraft works is absurdly simple. The documentat ion is overwhelming.\" 21 Whatever our view of demons and their realit y, there is the visible behavior of humans who are so brutal that we la bel their behavior as \"inhuman\" bec ause they exhibit a cruelty that surpasses all the anima l kingdom and surpasses any purposeful depraved needs. So why are these men so \"demonically\" dest ructive? How do we explain a man like Pol Pot who cruely killed half the people (many killed were of the better half) in his beautiful country of Cambodia. These were his own people. Ration al answers fall short of explaining such irrational behavior for destruc tion. This destructive force may be labeled demonic, whether we view demons as re al or as a psychological phenomena."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"\"Be wise as serpents...,\" What were the i ssues at stake in the Garden of Eden? If we are to be as wise as serpents, what was it that the serpen t knew that Eve didn't know? The story of the Garden of Eden sets forth the Biblical view of this issue right from the first part of scriptures. The serpent knew that man was man, and that it was a delusion for man to try to become god. The only way since then for m an to think he has reached godhead is if he deludes himself. And the serpent is there to help him try. But why does the Serpent want man to seek godhead th rough taking in the fruit of good and evil? The biblical view of God was that man s hould not try to determine good from evil by taking in knowledge—that is eating of the fr uit of the tree of good and evil. For man to determine for himself right from wrong is ca lled situational ethics. Rather than man pretending to be a god by de claring what is wrong by his own wisdom of situational ethics, man was to allow God to decide. The creator had laid down physical, spiritual, and moral laws. But the gift of choice was given to man. That was God's will. God's will allows for bad choices on man's part, including the op tion by man to reject his loving Creator and make up his own rules in contradiction to truth. Today, we are seeing that m any young people do not want the responsibility of making their own choices about what is right and wrong. They are running to Guru's, and laying their freedom of choice at the feet of thes e New Age \"Godmen\". \"Tell me what to do,\" they ask. And then men like Jim Jones, who thought he was God, 22 make their choices for these youth, often with disasterous consequences. Why does Satan encourage man to seek divini ty? Even today people are as naive as Eve concerning the issue. Satan and the dem ons really hate the Creator and would like to destroy his Creation. But how does seeking one's divinity aid in mankind's destruction? The Theosophical Society tells us that \" ...all philosophy is an effort to apprehend Reality; but it is an effort of the intellect merely, and as such it is, and must always be a fruitless effort.\" 23 The inability for man to find godhead by reason and logic has been repeatedly discovered by all the great minds. Man has always failed. For instance, William James the philosopher tell us in A Pluralistic Univ erse, p. 212, \"For my own part I have finally found myself compelled to give up the logic, fa irly, squarely, and irrevocably. It has an imperishable use in human life, but that use is not to make us theoretically acquainted with the essential nature of reality.\" To apprehend reality as a truth seeker by using only logic and reason is a dead end street. God reveals truth to man accord ing to the Scriptur es, and man obeys. If man chooses not to obey, and in sists on seeking truth on hi s own, he invariably must discard logic and reason and turns to mystic ism, the occult and the mystery religions including Hinduism. In or der to achieve his delusion of g odhead, the initiate is encouraged to leave reality by using drugs, self-hypnosis, ectastic activity such as rigorous physical and sexual activity, psycotic st ates of the mind and trances. The Theosophical Society states, \"Some of our modern philosop hers are beginning to apprehend this fact : notably Henri Bergson, who speaks of a higher faculty which he calls intuition, and which he says must replace intellect if we would contact Reality.\" 24 The Theosophical Society believes the world is but an illusion, Maya, an idea they have learned from Hinduism."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The reasoning that these people use is a form of reasonin g not under God's authority and is consequently according to scripture not under his protection from demonic control.

Although these people use reason, it is a distorted version. The dying words of atheists who exalted r eason, shows that they often discovered their philosophy tu rned out to be a cruel hoax. Does Satan benefit by watchi ng men pursueing altered states of consciousness and tripping out and leaving reality? Yes. A lif e centered on deluding ones elf is a destructive life.

Get in touch with reality and stay there. Quit trying to \"cop out\" of r eality. Christians are to test the spirits to see if they are of Go d. That means elements of logic, science, and reason must be tested to see if they are unde r God's authority. If they are, then embrace them. Christianity and the Scri ptures are not against science, logic, and reason. No those items are powerful tools for Christianity. But when those items are used in a distorted way that must be avoided. Science an d intellect are not to be used to create gods nor is their purpose to invent systems of morality. Evolution is an example of a powerful warped way of thinking. Because it was developed intentionally as a tool to destroy be lief in God, it has not been protected from demonic powers. All kinds of demonic influenc es have directed the evolutionists, and the list of frauds perpetrated by evol utionists is long. It is also used to teach us morality, such as, only the fit (the best) survive. This me ans one is superior if he survives by any means. To use reason, science and reality to become go ds is in itself a di stortion of reality—a contradiction, for man is but ma n. In order to delude himself into thinking he is a god, mankind is turning to drugs and other escapes from reality. The Christian NT book of Ephe sians chap. 4 deals with sins of the flesh in the context of the old man (verse 22) and the new man (v erse 24). In this context, suddenly Paul warns us, \"Neither give place to the devil.\" (v erse 27). By committing fleshly sins, the demons are given a place ( lit. ground) for their activi ty in the believer's life. But the Christian idea of Go d establishing right and wron g for us, is rediculed as simplistic by all the various Gnostic groups. \" 'Christianity,' so-called, lulls its devotees in to a false sense of security, or \"salvation\"; whereas the whole history of humanity, and of religion itself, shows us that: \" The path by which to Deity we climb Is arduous, rough, ineffable, sublime.\"' 25 The poem is right. The path to divinity is an arduous path, because it is a path man is not to accomplish on his own. It is a cruel hoax which Lucifer as an angel of light assists. The Masonic lodges which continue the anci ent mystery religion (one religion with various names) teaches the initiate that he needs light.

For instance, the Entered Apprentice, or first degr ee is asked by the Worshipful Master, \"In your present condition, wh at do you mo st desire?\" And C.T. Russell, Joseph Smith, Jr., Bill y Graham, and Robert Schuler all answered, \"Light.\" 26 \"Light is the first demand of a candidate at his initiation; and the material light is succeeded by an intellectual illumination.\"— Historical Landmar ks, Vol. 1, p.135. This search for light continues up throug h the degrees. When the candidate receives his lecture for the 32nd degree he is told, \"You are here to learn, if you can learn, and to remember what you have been taught. In th e Scottish Rite you will be taught that our ancient ancestors who knew all the Mysterie s left enough traces so that we today with diligant labor and teaching may renew them and bring them to light for your enlightment. We now come to the great symbol of Pythagoras. Our symbols have descended to us from the Aryans, and many were invented by Pythagoras, who studied in Egypt and Babylon. In order to preserve the great tr uths learned from the profane, there were invented some of our symbols that represent the profoundest of truths descended to us from our white ancestors...The ancient Mast ers invented some of these symbols to express the result of deity. They did not atte mpt to name him, but ra ther tried to express their reverence by describing him as Ahura-Mazda, spirit of light.\" 27 Ahura-Mazda was the god of the Mazdean religi on which worshipped five types of fire. The five fires were the internal fire of the ea rth, the Kundalini aka as Sex-force or serpent power, the fire of lightning, the fire of vegitation, and the fire of Ahura-Mazda. The ritual quoted above of the 32 degree lectur e introduces us to two concepts worthy of note at this point. First, t hat symbols are used to conceal truth from the profane, and second that Masonry involves the worship of the various 5 elem ents of the serpent. In Ez. 8:16, Sun worshippers ar e described facing the east. Generally, su n worshippers have faced east, as the Mas onic rituals connected to su n worship do. Because of a number of items, it appears that Lucifer may be playing a lar ger role within the Masonic lodges than one is led to belie ve. The symbology of the lodg e includes frequent use of the Sun, the serpent, and the eagle representing the sun. In order to bait mankind into continuing to self-destruct, Lucifer and his demons have been appearing and providing en lightment for those who ar e on the New Age road. It should be obvious that a real angel of light (by Bible standards) is not going to appear to help men become gods. The Bible is clear from the beginning Yahweh the God of the Bible doesn't want situational ethics and man-made gods. Notes 1. The seventh volume was billed as Russell' s, but was written by George H.

Russell, founde r of the Watchtower Society. BLOODLINES Bloodlines, they can mean authority (such as royal lineages), they can mean mean power (occult wisdom and power is generationa lly passed down in Satanists), they can mean likemindedness (world views are learned to a great extent from our parents, similar physical brains are genetically i nherited; for instance, identical twins separated at birth, and rejoined at adulthood are found to have surprising simi larities in modes of behavior.) Today the principles of racial heredity are no t popular at the public e ducational institutions controlled by the Power. Also supposedly, roya lty is a thing of the past and aristocracy is fading with it. After thousands of hours of re search on the Power, one th ing is blatantly clear— the Power recides in bloodlines that pass authority, occu lt power and knowledge, and likeminded worldviews from generation to gener ation. Bloodlines have not ceased to be important. THE PROCESS TO IDENTIFYING THE POWER In researching the Power behind hundreds of individuals and groups , it has been like peeling the layers of a on ion. Which men and women ar e front men, lackeys, and hirelings, and which ones are really ru nning the show and making decisions? For instance, men like Anto n LaVey, George Bush, William Buckley, the major networks' news anchormen, although powerful in their own ri ght are in the overall picture front men. There is an elite, not only in the United States , or Great Britian, or Russia but an elite over the entire globe. Surpri sing? When the astute observor begins to realize that an oligarchy is running the world, then there are lackeys in academia to tell us we should not have been surprised. Robert Mi chels concluded that elitism is a natural thing of society, because society required organizati on and all organizations are oligarchies even socialist societies. 1 That elites are inevitable is debatabl e (the elites are actually unproductive parasites on society), but this is not likely to be debated in today's population, which have been conditioned by the elite's media to be sheep. It was debated by the U.S.'s founding fathers, who set up an alternative to an oligarchy or a democracy, by establishing a Republic. Although there are societ ies, even somewhat modern ones without oligarchies, which prove that a community can function without some se lf-perpetuating power elite, these societies are not in control of the world. The Power that is in control of the world is not the benevo lent wise and spiritual group some of the masses ha ve been conditioned by behavior modification to believe. This"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"book intends to expose that world Power, and that means attempti ng to expose the bloodlines that have savagely maintained their parasitic power. IMPORTANT BLOODLINES Important bloodlines for the Power include: •The Jewish bloodline of the Prieure de Si on which starts with the tribe of Dan, extends through the Merovingian Dynasty and into the Hapsbu rg royalty. This bloodline has kept a close association wi th all branches of the occult, often providing the leadership for the occult. •The bloodlines of the leaders of the LD S and RLDS churches which go back to the bloodline of the Prieure de Sion, the Mero vingians. A secret so ciety of Danites was created by the LDS church. •The bloodlines of the 13 llluminati families, which include several Jewish and Maranos Jewish families. •The bloodlines of the petty Hasidic Jewish messiahs that began th eir religious reigns in Poland among the Askinazim. •The bloodlines of the Babylonish Talmud ic Jews. Historical evidence shows these bloodlines were of mixed blood even in Chri st's time, in disregar d for the Scriptures commandments not to mix blood. 2 •The bloodlines of the \"Successors of the Me ssiah\", that is the bloodline of the Sufi leadership. •The bloodlines of the Knights of Malta. The aristocratic/royal bloo dlines carry titles, wealth and power. •The bloodlines of the desc endents of William of Orange and those wh o helped him conquer England. They have been in powerful posit ions since, especially in England. Part of William of Orange's hel p was derived from those of Jewish descent. • The bloodlines of the thirte en llluminati families (w hich have tie ins to the blood lines above). These thirteen are not a fixed set, but because of their powe r change in who are the thirteen doesn't often occur. A tentative list of these thir teen families includes Astor, Bundy, Collins, DuPont, Freeman, Lee, Onnas is, Rockefeller, Rothschild, and Van Dyne. Besides those families there are a host of ot her families that are important within the llluminati. The list includes: (those of German Jewish Heri tage): Adler, Geisenheimer , Goldschmidt, Guggenheim, Lazard, Oppenheim, Oppenheim er, Seligman, Sichel, Speyer , Stern, Russell, Wolf(e) (and those of British or Sco ttish Heritage): Acheson, Bell, Billings, Brown, Buckland, Clinton, Eddy, Frost, Gardner , Hall, Hopkins, Hooker, Kennedy, Leek, Lord, Morgan, Sinclair (St. Clair), Smit h, Tolkein, Lewwellyn (and others such as): Hapsburgs, Sassoons What makes this study of vital and timely importance is that members of these bloodlines intend within the 7-year period of 1992-1999 to launch a sequence of events to lead the world into a one world slave-stat e ruled by a man controlled by the god which the elites worship. Should the reader allow, I will quote from the Power's own statements plus other proof to show that this god, the god of the world, is Luci fer (aka Satan, Sanat, Venus, etc.) For thousands of years, The Plan for worl d domination has been passed down from occult generation to occult generation. Spaced every 20 years plus is a Feast"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"of the Beast, a year-long holiday during which Satanists receive new instructions from Satan on how to ca rry out The Plan. 3 We read of the great holi day and its Great Councils in Externalization of the Hierarchy, when Sa tan's instrument Alice Bailey writes, \"The past year...has, however, been the year in which the greatest spirit ual Approach of all time has shown itself to be possible - an Approach for which the initiates and Masters have for centuries been preparing, and fo r which all the Wesak Festival s since the meeting of the Great Council in 1925 have been pr eparatory. I have, in past in structions, referred to the great meetings held at interval s by Those to Whom is entrust ed the spiritual guidance of the planet and particularly of man.\" (Externalisation of the Hierarchy, p. 389.) ONE SAMPLE OF THEIR PLANS As example of how ingenius these plans are to create a On e-World-Government consider the following part of it. The Drug War is not what it seems. It is a very ingenious scheme to enslave the American people, an d destroy all their civil rights. 4 The first rumblings of the Drug War part of Th e Plan seem to stir from the occult, so it is highly possible the Drug War originally was first developed by Satanists, perhaps even given during one of th e Feasts of the Beast. The Drug War seems like the perfect plan, with no way for the Power to lose. First, the Power creates a drug culture in America. The Drug Culture would and did give many their first step into the Aquarian (New Age) conspiracy. 5 The Power would make billions of dollars by running drugs, to further finance other nefarious schemes, and could use their world-wide power to crush all their com petitors. When the Power crushed and arrested their competitors in drug running, they woul d be hailed as heros by the majority of people.(And they have.) The introduction of drugs into society does several things. It taxes the Christian church's ability to oppose immorality. It ge ts the public indignent about drugs, and the public's moral outcry allows t he Power to pass \"drug\" laws that remove the last vestiges of legal ci vil rights. In fact, the beguil ed public demands the laws which abolish their rights, and applauds these laws in ignorance unknowi ng what the laws actually say and mean. If the public some how gets a complete picture that their government has been smuggling drugs to creat e a drug war in spite of the controlled media, or perhaps through the media at the ri ght time, then they can create a scandal involving several U.S. Presidents to eliminat e the U.S. government and switch the public's alligience to a world government. (See chapter 3.9 for more details and a chronology of the secretly planned escalation of today's designed Drug War.) As an ex-Mason, who is very aware of thei r plans, said to this Author, \"These people are in it for the long-term.\" THE BLOODLINE OF THE RUSSELLS The purpose of this next subsection may be misunderstood, unless I make myself clear at this point. This Author has not establ ished any link between the various famous Russells. (Although I have been doing genealogy work, I have not had the chance to do the long term Geneology work required to clarif y the issue, if the re ader is dissatisfied with the extent of this inform ation, he is encouraged that rat her than criticize to research it himself.) The reader will observe by the time he finishes this book , that this Author has"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"done extensive research into many groups. One item that has popped up consistently is that people with the surname Russell repeat edly appear as impo rtant figures in the various elements of the World Order as it has developed. Before becoming aware of the One World Or der, this Author had no inkling how important blood lines have been for the elite that controls the world. Friendships have also played a role, for instance, Eleanor Roosevel t (who was involved in numerous communist organizations 6 ) was a close friend and confidant to Ronald Reagon's mother. This seems trivial, but the reoccurance of blood lines and the reoccurant discovery of connections of friendships between what have been thought of as unrelated personages, compels one to believe the elite is more compac t than appears.(More on that later) The mysterious Watchtower Society and its founder Charles Taze Russell will serve as perhaps the most used example in this book of an organization that is secretly serving the New World Order. (The reader will be presented with the history of all this throughout the book, especially in chapters 5-17 of the first section.) Let's comment about the type of Russells that keep appear ing throughout the course of the history of the New Wo rld Order as this Author we nt about his research. To summarize, these various Russells (who until the genealogy work is done to show the connections should be view ed as individuals—not a gr oup) have been prominent members of the llluminati, the Masons, th e Fabians, the Mormon s, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Jesuits, the Royal Society, and the Media controlled by those of the New World Order, and a deputy chairm an of the Federal Reserve. Typically they have been merchants and lawyers, with a fair share of them also as Christian heretics. It will be easier perhaps to illustrate ho w the Russells keep popping up in the New World Order story line by listing a good sampling of them.

RUSSELL'S STORY Once there was a Jewish family whose name was Roessel. They lived in early 17th century Germany. They moved to a country called Scotland. There they re-spelled the name Russell. They took on the ways of their new homeland. The English tried to settle Protestants from Scotland in Ireland in order to control the Irish. When the opportunity opened up to go to the Emerald Island (Ireland) with the Scottish settlers who went to the plantation Ulster they went. It is possible, but not known for sure that they learned to know the Rutherfords either in Scotland or Ireland. Scotland repeatedly appears as the source of much of the religious heresy connected with the Power. That C.T. Russell's family were in Scotland for a period, and also from the German states which seem to be a hot bed for Jewish Satanism may be only a coincidence and then again it might be a clue to understanding the origins of the Watchtower Society. This Author's previous book The Watchtower and the Masons tells the story how the Arian heresy began at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland and spread to the the Presbyterians of the Synod of Ulster. The book gives t his Author's reasons for believing that the C.T. Russell's family in northern Ireland were Arian in belief before coming to the U.S. and cha nces are they were involved with Freemasonry also. THE ACKLEY CONNECTION In The Watchtower and the Masons the early history of C.T. Russell is given. Charles a nd his father married two Ackley sisters a number of years after Charles' mother died. What is an intriguing item is that C.T. Russell's mother's will indicates she owned land in Iowa. A description of that land shows it was north of the town of Ackley, Io wa. It turns out that a man named William Ackley had purchase d the land in t hat area, and had sold it in large part to Scot-Irish settlers of the Presbyterian faith as they were coming to America. At the time C.T. Russell's mother died a town named A ckley had been staked out in 1857, but the Civil War had interferred with construction plans. A Presbyterian congregation had been formed in the area during the early 1860s in the Ackley area , which indicate s some settlers had arrived. What connection did the Russells have with the Ackleys years before Charles T. and his father married Ackley sisters? Who are the Ackleys? Maria Ackl ey, who was Charles T. Russell's wife, was well-educated and an excellent writer. Interestingly, in the 19th century she believed a socialist revolution was coming. She wrote, \"This great revolution has not yet come, but where is the statesman or the intelligent citizen that does not see it coming?\" (Russell, Maria. This Gospel of The Kingdom, p. 26.) She was the ghost writer and ghost editor for much of her husband Charles Taze's work. Her family was well -off. William Ackley, the land speculator/seller in Iowa, traces his ancestry back to Prence Doane and Elizabeth Godfrey. Elizabeth Godfrey in turn was the great-granddaughter of William Brewster of the Mayflower fame. The Ackleys were Puritans to begin with and seem to have been"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"concentrated in the Connecticut area, and from there their family members moved out into NY and PA. Another Ackley (1832-1881) at that time was Richard Thomas Ackley, a Freemason who worked for the Miller, Russell and Company store in Salt Lake City in 1858 soon after the Mormons built Salt Lake City. LEADS Of course, these are all simply tantalizing leads for the investigator but nothing solid. There seems to be much more to Charles Taze Russell than the little that the public has been told. In the next few chapters we will attempt to dispel some of the mystery surrounding the man."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Chapter 1.7 God's \"Annointed Seed\" In 1852, the Joseph Lyttle Russell family had a baby who they gave the same name to as his uncle had. This ba by, named Charles Taze Russell had a br other Frank who was two years older, but Charles ended up the favorite of his fathe r. Later Charles would get a sister Margaret M. Both Charles T. and his sister Margaret spoke on various occasions that his had been chosen before his birth for the work that he was to carry out. 1 Margaret referred to her brother as the greatest man alive \"a giant unmatch ed.\" She stated that he had been choosen for his religious work before his birth. Perhaps, Charles' Russell family, and hi s father Joseph L., (like Joseph Kennedy who had goals for hi s son to be president) had goals for Charles. If Charles had been encouraged to meet such expect ations and had gone forward, th en that could account for his sister's great admiration for him. He had fulfilled her father's wishes. At the Put-In-Bay Convention his sister Margaret had outlin ed how God pla nned and chose her brother. First God had plante d a seed with the early church. But the seed had laid dormant for centuries. \"In due time\", she says, the seed of truth grew a nd was watered according to God's plan. During the Dark Ages the seed of truth was barely kept alive waiting for God's Chosen One to bring it to fruiti on. When it was time, God \"annointed th e eyes\" of her br other at age 17, and \"God's smile of favor rested upon him.\" Margar et said her brother wa s the one, the faithful one who God could depend upon, the \"one despite the burden an d heat of the day\" would remain faithful to God. 2 NOTES 1.

However, for the minute it takes to read through the next few paragraphs, this Author wants to point out how prevalent yet secr et Satanism is. Whether you the reader are or aren't aware of evil sp irits, the facts remain there are c ountless people down through the ages who have worshipped evil spirits. On Friday and Saturday nigh ts across the United States members of Satanic Covens are secretly meeting. 1 They also meet on the ma ny Satanic special days. (See the list of their sacred days and the blood sacrifices that they carry out on those days.) An ex-Illuminati member estimates that over 300,000 covens exist in the United States each having 13 or more members. A Black Prince (B lack Satanic Magician) estimated 40,000 to 60,000 sa tanic human sacrifices occur in the U.S. yearly. 2 This Author had the privilege to talk to someone w ho had an accidental rare encounter with Satanists in Kansas City and managed to successfully flee to live and tell about it. Having been a West Point cadet, it especially caught my atte ntion when the West Point Day Care Center was accused of bein g involved in the ritual abuse of 30 children. The officer requesting an investigation into his 2 1/2 year old daughter's abuse was told to resign his commission. (This is no surprise in several ways.) Many dozens of day care centers in California are investigated each year for subjecting the children left in their care to Sa tanic Ritual Abuse. In Los Ange les County 800 allegations of ritual abuse involving 64 schools and pres chools and 27 neighborhoods were reported. The newmen and newspapers are repeatedly coming upon news stor ies involving Satanism. Most of these stories never get printed, and ma ny stories which do, do no t draw conclusions from the obvious clues indicating Satanic activity. An exam ple of this is a news story describing the desecration of a grave by some young people. Certain bones are listed as having been taken, and the story writes the incident off as youngsters playing games. If more were known about Satanism the fact that the left hand was ta ken would have clued pe ople that Satanism was involved. The left hand, the femur, the Skull, and a particul ar rib bone are especially important parts of the body. Left hands ar e associated with Satan-right ha nds with God. Human sacrifices are always done with knifes in th e left hand, except wh en the Priestesses ba ttle to the death for power. 4 Many criminal cases showing clues of Masonic involvement have the Masonic clue s ignored by the police and the press. Examples a bound such as Jack the Ripper's case. This Author knows personally from when he did farm work that occassionally ca ttle would be found obviously killed from some type of Sata nic ritual. The newspape rs often did not report such stories by farmers. The Chicago Tribune, Sunday, Ap r. 27,1986 carried a story \"Sat an Worship Ca lled Dangerous, Growing\" by Eric Zorn. The story told how youth in the area had been involved in attempts to sacrifice humans to Satan, and about a series of mutilation killings in Cook and Du Page Counties in 1981-82 in which 4 men abducted and murdered up to 18 women. The parts of the dead women's bodies were used in Satani c rituals involving cannibalism and sexuality."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Satanic Ritual Abuse Calendar Jan. 1 ............................New Years Day..................................Druid feast day Jan. 7 ............................St. Wi nebald Da y ..............................bl ood ritual, Jan. 17 ...........................Satanic Revels ...................................sex ritual Jan. 20 ...........................St. Agnes Eve Jan. 20 ......................................................................................kidnapping, sacrifice preparation Jan. 26 ...........................Grand Climax ....................................sex ritual, human sacrifice (5 wks. & 1 day since equinox) Feb. 2 ............................Candlemas .........................................sex ritual, one of the witches' Sabbats Feb. 25 .........................Blood Host or St. Walpurgis Day .... blood ritual, animal sacrifice March 1 ........................St. Eichatadt Day ...............................bl ood ritual, demon hommage March 20 .......................Equinox Feast ..................................se x and blood rituals, Sabbat March 24 ..................................................................................16 year old bride of Satan ritual April 19-25 ...............................................................................kidnapping, sacrifice preparation April 24 ........................St. Mark Eve April 25 ........................Grand Climax ....................................female sacrifice (can be a child), sex & fertl ity ritual (5 wks. & 1 day since equinox) April 26-30............. ......high holy days for Beltaine April 30 ........................Walpurgis Night or May Eve............blood ritual, one of the greatest witches' Sabbats May 1 ............................Beltaine, Walpurgis or May Day ........bl ood ritual and/or fire festival June 21 .........................Solstice Feast.................................... sex ritu al, animal or human sacrifice June 23 .........................Midsummer's Eve ........................... fire festival, most important times for the practice of magick [sic] July 1 ............................Demon Revels .................................. bl ood ritual, sex with demons July 20-27 ............................................................................... kidnapping, sacrifice preparation July 25 ..........................St. James Day July 27 ..........................Grand Climax ................................... sex ritual, human female sacrifice (5 wks. & 1 day since solistice) July 31 or Aug. 1 ..........Lammas / Harvest............................. animal or human sacrifice, great Sabbat Aug. 3 ...........................Satanic Revels .................................. sex ritual Aug. 24 .........................St. Bartholomew Day....................... fire festival, great Sabbat Sept. 7............................Marriage to the Beast ........................ sex &. blood rituals, female under 21 Sept. 20 .........................Midnight Host................................... hands of glory / blood ritual Sept. 22 .........................Equinox Feast Day ........................... sex ritual Oct 23-30 ................................................................................ kidnapping, sacrifice preparation Oct 29-31 or 31 ............All Hallows' Eve .............................. blood ritual, fire festival, great Sabbat, believe the dead return to earth this night Nov. 1 ...........................

Even th ough the news media is careful not to give the full ramifications in su ch stories, and is reluctant to ca rry these stories, the stories still can't be totally suppressed. Two points have been introduced, that Satanism is widespread, and that our awareness of its activity is very slim due to its ex treme secrecy and poor news coverage. DEMONIC DEPRAVITY The Satanic Skull and Bones Order has initiation rites which include the candidate lying in a coffin and relating their sexual exploits. Anothe r part of the ceremony involves wrestling in a manure pile. 5 This is the type of degene rate activity Satanism is well known to draw people into. One of the top Christian research ers in demons, and author of tw o excellent books on Satanism and demons Merrill F. Unger writes, \"People wh o deal in the occult are often found to be immoral. Men and women who aba ndon themselves to immorality reach a point where God gives them up, in the sense of rest raining Satan and dem onic power from them, so that they are abandoned to the degrading depths of immorality and are shamelessly re duced to actions that even animals avoid (Romans 1: 26-32; cf. Revelation 9:20, 21).\" 6 ROLE OF DEMONS IN STARTING RELIGIONS Hinduism is replete with many gods and ma ny superstitions. It has a deep-rooted tendency toward mysticism, and derives much of its pow er from demonic activity. Some of the Holiest men of Hinduism are deranged me n who run around on all fours lik e animals. This Author has personally seen the total demonic degradation of the human by Hin duism all in the disguise of making the person spiritual. Primitive religions are as a rule full of magic and the worship of evil spirits. These evil spirits are feared, ceaselessly placated , and slavishly worshipped. 7 The polytheism of the Mesopotame ans, the Sumerians, Assyrians, the Persians, the Babylonians are full of demons from the ea rliest of historical records. Demonism is the dynamic behind the magic and spiritual powers of these groups' religion. 8 The Caananite, Egyptian, Greek, and Roman gods relate to the Babylo nian gods in character and natu re, and are also demonic. All kinds of magic, immorality, human sacrifice, astrology, etc. came to be practiced 2 Page CHART the SATANIC HIERARCHY BASIS FOR CHART: This chart has been devel oped from charts by Ex-S atanists, it also is colloborated by information received from many historical sources. Historical information describing the hierarchie s and power structure of demonology are worldwide. Although differing in details, it is clear that multiple levels of demonic authority have be en experienced by people. LEVEL A. SATAN AND RULING SPIRIT PRINCE S- The ruling spirit princes are widely known among Satanists. Many of the ruling pr inces go by several names, as do many of the Satanists. Some of the ruling princes are still refe rred to by names they used in ancient Babylon and ancient Egypt."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"LEVEL B. DEMONS- The highest ranking Satanist s teach their children that the demons are aliens from other planets. Within the Satanic cove ns one variety of demons looks like E.T. (but also can have more hair) are common and they se rve as guardians. Also a grey type of demon with almond eyes associat ed with UFOs is also working closely with the high ranking Satanic Illuminati. The first rumblings of Satanic plans to use a mock alien invasion from outer space to unite the world under Satan's rule were given to the Satanists in the 19th century, perhaps at a Feast of the Beast in possibl y 1868. After the next Feast of the Beast 28 years later, UFOs began appearing in large numbers in the USA es p. Calif. H.G. Wells novel War of the Worlds was published in serial form the fo llowing year too. By 1917, the se cret occult frat ernities show signs of working toward creating this artif icial alien invasion. The UFO phenomena is accompanied with a. repeated accounts by abduct ees and contactees that man has failed to advance morally as rapidly as he has technologically, and that th ese aliens will give mankind or the elite of mankind both adva nced technology and advanced morality. The secrets of the galaxies- not just ancient mysteries but the myster ies of the ages- will be given to our elite free by these aliens (actually demons), b. mankind is on the verge of a great evolutionary leap forward, but also faces an Arma geddon. Demons which appear manage to come in all sizes and shapes. There is a munchkin variet y called elves, lepricans, or me nihunis. There is a large giant variety too. The spirits are assigned various task s, and are often grouped in 4's, 7's, or 13's. LEVEL C. PRINCIPALITIES & POWERS- These fo rces are akin to \"s chool spirit\" or the power that a rampaging crowd has within its elf. These powers of synergy are carefully manipulated by the Satanic forces. These energies produce a Zeitgei st -a spirit or fad of the times. Peer pressure is a form of such power. These power stru ctures are known and manipulated by the Satanic forces. LEVEL D. GUARDIANS - These Nephalim (half men - half demon) ar e to be found distributed throughout all the levels. They ar e the goon squads, the enforcers, the Sargeant-at-arms, and have rank according to the level they operate on. LEVEL E. ILLUMINATI - Illuminati members depe nding upon their groups have various levels themselves. Their knowledge of Satan's organization de pends upon which group they are in and which level they are at, most us ually they may have only that kno wledge needed to function at their level. Illuminati members have their name written in blood by a quill pen into a book. The various factions of Illuminati rule the world as the Kingpins in politics, finance, porn, drugs, communications, and religion in prep aration for the Anti-Ch rist (Kashema) to take his throne, and rule with rest of the Satanic tr inity of the Beast, and the False Prophet. This level includes the Grande Druid Council, and the 13 highest Satanic families. Vari ous branches have their own terminology and rules for their lower le vels which are the following pattern. LEVEL F. BRIGADES- SISTERS OF LIGHT/ ASMODEUS -These are the Mothers of light, the overseers of power. Training for these Illumi nati begins at age 11. Coronations for a Queen in the Mother of Light is at 14 years old. LEVEL G. REGIMENT- This level is led by a Grande Master/Mat riarch. Regiments are divided up into various levels of groupi ngs of covens into companies and sub-regiments led by captain and major-types. Rings are worn by various levels."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"LEVEL H. COVENS- Basic low level group (sim ilar to an Army platoon) containing 13+ witches with a Priest or Priestess as an officer. Most covens are extrem ely well kept secrets. A few show temples like Anton LeVe y's Temple of Satan are put on for the public's consumption. NOTES: Alan K. Russell put together Th e Collector's Book of Science Fiction by H.G. Wells which gives the information about the Pe arson's Magazine serial publicat ion of H.G. We ll's War of the Worlds. Interestingly not only do Masoni c publications indicate a Satanic trinity, and Occult and Magic publications describe this, but the Christian Scri pture's book of Revelation 20:10 (et. al.) also refers to the Satanic trinity of th e Beast, False Pr ophet, and Satan. According to the Masonic book An Interpretation of Freemas onry by Mason Martin Wagner, p. 97, the name Solomon which is used by Masons so frequently is actu ally a Sun-God trinity, \"This name Solomon is not the Israelitish king. It is name in form, but different in its meaning. It is a substitute which is exte rnally like the royal name. This name is a composite. Sol-om-on, the names of the sun in Latin, Indian, and Egypt ian, and is designed to show the unity of several god-ideas in the ancien t religions, as well as with those of Freemasonry.\" If Wagner, and ex- Mason McQuaig who also claims this is the ca se are accurate, and this view was known in Elizabethan England, then Solomo n's temple that the Masons ar e building ends up to be nothing other than Lucifer, the light-bearer's te mple. [end of Satanic Hierarchy Chart] under these systems. Another example from anot her angle, the cloven hoofed Greek god Pan from who was derived the English word \"panic\" is a carbon copy of what ex-Satanists claim Satan looks like. In Shintoism all kinds of deities and spirits are conjur ed up, and all kinds of occult practices including divination, fortune- telling, spiritism, magic, a nd conjuring are practiced. In Taoism, which is polytheistic, all kinds of magic, divination, charms, de alings with demons, geomancy, and fortune-telling are practiced. Buddhism exists in many forms. This Author lived in Nepal and can personally testify that Buddhists in Nepal and Tibet as well as other Asian lands ha ve many superstitions, do practice all the occult practices, and they live in fear of demons which are placated. Confucianism was started strictly as a philosophy, not as a reli gion and does not concern itself with the spirit realm. By default then most Confucists must learn of the supernatur al from Taoism which most of them practice. Taoism is very demonic. Rabbinic Judaism is based on the religions of Babylon, not the Old Testament as most people especially Christians incorrectly assume. Th e Kabballa and the Zohar of the Jews are the fundamental books that most occult, magic, and Satanic groups ba se their actities on. One of the leading well-known Satanists and a magician E. Levi wrote in hi s book Transcendental Magic, \"All truly dogmatic religions have issued from th e Kabalah and return therein. Whatsoever is grand or scientific in the reli gious dreams of the illuminated, of Jacob Bohme, Swedenborg, Saint-Martin and the rest, is borrowed from the Kabalah; all Ma sonic Associations owe to it their secrets and their symbols.\" 9 (Bold added) A BIZZARE DISCOVERY"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"One of the strangest things for this Author was to continue running into evidence that seems to indicate Charles Taze Russell, the man who started the Jehovah's Witnesses' Watchtower Society, was secretly an important Satanist. Lest the reader devalue the evidence, permit this Author to state that th e evidence came in first before I came up with my theory that Russell was an important Satanist , and not vice-versa. Some of the outstanding clues are: a.) C.T. Russell was definitely a Mason, yet he puts up some great smokescreens in his writing concerning his membership. b.) C.T. Russell's Bethel staf f became concerned about his oc cultic activities and required him to take an oath forsweari ng any further occultic activities. c.) In my previous book The Watchtower and the Masons, I st udy 35 parallel beliefs that Russell had with Masonry. I spent a page per parallel. These 35 are not in any way inclusive, Russell had many other identical ideas to what the Masonic lodges propogate. d.) Various items from magic were part of Ru ssell's religious beliefs including healing handkerchiefs, phrenology, the Winged-Sun -Disk, Enochian Magical planes, etc. e.) Russell's family's possible I lluminati links, and his wife's possi ble connections with a family line of Satanists. f.) Russell's apparent secret Rosicrucian memb ership with the Quak ertown, PA group of Rosicrucians, as revealed by the pyramid he or dered erected, his use of the Winged-Sun-Disk, and his cremation three days after his death. g.) Russell owned a cemetary in Pittsburgh. Leadi ng Satanists try to own cemetaries for several reasons. First, it facilitates the di sposal of human sacrifices which are buried in pieces below the fresh holes dug for someone else's burial. When the casket is placed in the hole, it would be rare for anyone to dig below the caske t level ever again. Second, magic power is associated with cemetaries. The spiritual power of the dead is pulled up by making a circle of light over them then within the circle a naked Satanist lays. Th ird, specific bones are sought such as the skulls and left hands. Left hands are preserved in order to hold candles for certain ceremonies. h.) Contacts from various places today indicate that the modern Watchtower Soci ety is working with the New World Order. This im plies that at some point the Society began cooperating with the New World Order. Russell seems to be the likeliest starting point. UNDERSTANDING CHAR LES T. RUSSELL As with all occult organizations a veil of secrec y is maintained by requiri ng initiates to take secrecy oaths on penalty of death. As in Witchc raft, Masonry repeatedly demands secrecy oaths at every new level. Charles T. Russell began participating in th is secrecy when he took the Entered Apprentice (first Masonic degree) oath on penalty of mayhem and vi olent death, \"I...do hereby and hereon most solemnly and sincerely pr omise and swear that I will always hail, ever conceal and never reveal any of the arts, parts or points of the secret arts and mysteries of ancient Freemasonry which I received, am about to receive, or may he reafter be instructed in...\" NOTES 1.

RUSSELL? Jehovah's Witnesses point to their success as proof of God's approval, in the same way that communists have pointed to various re volutions to show pr oof that the broad masses support them. COLOSSAL SPENDING During the half century befor e his death C.T. Russell spent vast sums of money. Russell travelled nearly conti nuously. His trips took him to Europe frequently and around the world. He often had lar ge entourages accompanying him. The Jehovah's Witnesses, then called International Bible Students or simply Bible Students, gave out enormous quantities of FREE books, tracts, and other th ings. For instance consider some of the following expenses, In 1881 the WT issued a 164-pg book Food for Th inking Christians. The cost of printing was born by the WT Societ y, and for some unknown reason several newspapers picked up the cost of distribution. These small books (now extremel y rare) were distributed free. Zion's W.T. in 1881 says that their tract Suppl ement No. 2 is \"for fr ee distribution. Order as many as you can use.\" 1 In 1882 the WT magazi ne (then called Zion's Watch Towe r) advertises, \"We have plenty of tracts and September numbers, which you c an have for free distribu tion by asking for them.\" 2 In 1886, Russell had 300 workers distributing Food for Thinking Christians. 300,000 free tracts were distributed in Great Britian alone. WT literature was given free to the colporteurs. In 1893, the WT Magazine says \"A good colporteur can put into the hands of the people 5 to 6 thousand volumes of Dawn in a year. One with li ttle talent ought to dispose of 3,000 a year.\" 3 The Dawn books were good looki ng hard back books with about 370 pages apiece. To distribute su ch vast quantities of books genera lly free had to have cost the Watchtower Society plenty. The WT Magazine (Z.W.T) published by the Tower Publishing Co., stated under its title \"FREE TO THE LORD'S POOR.\" For instance, the May 1, 1893 issue states under a first page article \"ADDRESSES FOR FREE READING MATTER\" that \"we are glad to send out matter freely to such.\" Such refers simply to those interested. 4 In 1897, there was a mass distri bution of 300,000 of the free WT booklet the Bible versus Evolution. 5 "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"In 1899,948, 459 tracts were handed out by pe ople a half block away from churches in each direction as people came out. 6 In 1910, Russell had 76 worker s at headquarters and paid 2,000 different newspapers to carry his articles. How much money woul d it take for an unknown person without connections to pay 2,000 newspapers to ru n their articles? Russell wasn't without connections. In 1910, the Ge rman branch ran a $7,340.49 deficit, even though they received much of their literatu re free, and the British branch came up $9,331.41 short that year, all made up by the Brooklyn,NY headquarters. 7 Had the gigantic literature gi veaways ended yet? In 1913, in a Convention Russell states, \"Do you know how many copies of free lit erature have been distri buted by the people of Great Britian this year so far? Eight millions of copies....And I am so pleased to see that many of God's peopl e are rejoicing in the privilege of showing forth His praises. Never mind if it is not customary to go about giving out literature. Ne ver mind if it is not popular to give out religious literature. We have a message and work, and this is our way of preaching.\" 8 During all this time pe riod of 35 years, the Watchtower Society had managed to rent such hugh building such as Prince Albert Hall—wh ich by the way is fa mous for many big Masonic events. Rent ing the Hall would have ranged in the hundreds of dollars. In 1910 they rented it six times. 9 WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD Up to now, no one has contested the expla nation that has been provided by the WT Society and their offici al history. Supposedly, Russell so ld his clothing store and financed his activities from the proceeds. Anyone familiar with printing and shipping kn ows that the large quantities of material Russell distributed free had to co st in just one year alone mo re than the proceeds from selling his store. On t op of that, Russell had legal fees from repeated court battles, exorbant travelling cost s, and a full-time st aff to house and feed. His followers were not required to give up their money to become Bible Students. So where did the money come from ? The foreign branches receiv ed free literature some of which they sold, and came up sh ort even after some sales an d donations. Bear in mind, the WT Society was not efficient as it is today. Today they make their own ink and have the latest equipment to typeset and print with . But back then, at least part of the books Russell printed he paid outside printers to print. Up to now, it has been stated that Russell was a genius with money. That kind of statement simply clouds what really happ ened. Russell was not Rumplestiltchen. If he was such a man of finan ce (and he certainly had the reput ation then), it seems hard to picture him sending out his people to stand in front of churches to hand out expensive books free to Christians as they left. A man that loose with his own money would hardly makes a fortune in ten years of running a clothing store. Russell wasn't being careless with his money, because he was not having to finance his operation himself. His backers"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"were obviously quite rich and powerful. The Greek Orthodox church which jealously guards it turf, has re peatedly accused the Jehovah's Witnesses of being financed by the agents of \"Inter national Zionism.\" 10 This topic is discussed more in chapter 6. RUSSELL'S FINANCES It will surprise many peop le to learn that Char les T. and his father Joseph L. were quite poor in 1870. They boarded and t heir store was rented to them . In 1870, they were not involved in religion yet, and be tween the two of them they had not a single piece of property. Joseph's personal belongings were $2,000. 11 Actually, they were doing fine, considering Joseph had left Ireland during the Potato famine, and had left owing his brother-in-law money. 12 The first good financial break was when Charle s T. Russell's uncle by the same name died Dec. 1875. His father inherited $1,000. 13 Because his father and him were in business together, this was a real boost. According to cour t testimony, Russell had a chain of 5 stores by 1880. S oon Russell invested in oil in Butler Co. and his father and him opened a scrap meta l business in 1882. 14 They closed the men' s furnishing business in 1883. Charles bought out his father, and when his father died in 1897, his will reveals that he had 3 houses and lots in Allegheny , PA. a house and 3 lots at Farfron Springs, FL. along with another 25 acres, 160 acres in Polk Co.,FL and stock in the Carlin Co. Besides that he had shares of stock in the Railway and Dock Construction Co. of NYC which C.T. Russell inherited. 15 Because C.T. Russell's wife di vorced him in 1897 Russell hid his money so that his ex- wife would not be able to get any support, in court, C. T. Russell would not honestly state his holdings even under oath. A Reverend J.J. Ross investigated on his own and discovered that Russell had li ed under oath. Russell was a stoc kholder in the Pittsburgh Asphatum Co. which later became the Calif. Asphatum Co. which was the organizer of the Selica Brick Co. Russell also had control ling interest in the Brazilian Turpentine Co. located in Pittsburgh, a cemetary in Pittsburgh . & the U.S. Coal & Coke Co. with capital of $100,000. 16 After having lied in court, Pastor Russell had to make a clean breast of his lies when the Reverend Ro ss confronted him in court with the facts and the charters of some of Russell's companies. 17 Russell also had money invested in timber limits. Russell had just secretly purchased silver mines in Nevada, and had gone out to check them out on his western trip when he died. In 1874, when C.T. Russell began his religious meetings , he also began buying property in Allegheny. He bought again in 1874, 1884, 1885 (two properties), 1889 (four properties), in 1890 (five pr operties), 1892, 1894, 1896, 1897 (t wo properties), and four more properties after the turn of the cent ury in that area al one in his own name. 18 Further, the WT Society whic h he had control of had owners hip of numerous properties. Russell had control (99% of the snares) of the U.S. Investment Co., Ltd. which in turn held 38 houses and lots in Binghamton, NY, several lots in Tacoma, WA, a farm near Rochester, NY, a house and lot in Buffalo, NY , a farm in OK , 100 lots in TX, a house and lot near Pittsburgh, and 5,500 acres in KT. 19 By the way, the original owners of U.S. Investment Co. were John A. Bohnet (5"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"shares), Ernest C. Henninges (5 shar es), and C.T. Russ ell (990 shares). 20 The popular story is that Pastor Russell gave all his money to his great crusade and died a poor man, leaving his poor wife (the WT Society claims they were only seperated- -the divorce papers say otherwise) with only $200. 21 The court records show a very rich man indeed. And most of Russ ell's money came in after he started up his Watch Tower Society. THE ENIGMA REMAINS Here is a man that starts a religion from scratch. He is busy travelling, writing and talking almost full time. He is well off but not a millionaire. After starting his religion, he spends millions on giving away free literature, and invests perhaps millions in gold, silver mines, government bonds, oil fields, property, an d stocks in companies. There has never been a real analysis of C.T. Russ ell's finances, and his WT Society. Russell was involved in several fina ncial scams also. He lost in court. WHOEVER FINANCED RUSSELL HAD BIG PLANS FOR HIS SOCIETY Russell's WT Society was financed by so me heavyweights. The history of the WT Society gives evidence that the power to bring in a one- world-government financed Russell. The WT Society has been a proxy for the One-World New Order to accomplish certain goals. Unfortunately, the JWs \"in the trenches\", have not known how they have been used. JWs brought upon themselves all kinds of persecution when Rutherford announced to them that the angels had revealed that all national flags were the \" devil's banner.\" On page 44 of Uncovered Rutherford st ates \"Flag saluting is in direct violation of God's law.\" Individual JWs had to suffer first in order to bring the issue of flag saluting before the Supreme Court. It would have looked bad for t he Masonic Lodge to openly support the issue, but the WT Society was accomplishing a goal that they, the Masons had determined in advance. So the populace hated the JW s, and the Masons could continue putting out Patriotic material for public consumpt ion, although in their own literature, they had clearly ma rked Nationalism for destruction. J.P.Morgan, the Rothschild's r epresentative in the United Stat es, set up a trust fund to unite the various Christian denominations. Russ ell praises this in his Jan. 1, 1911 WT, pp.1-4 (WTR p.4735), \"Mr. Morgan's we ll-known business capacity, exhibited in connection with financial trusts, encourages m any to believe that he will accomplish the desired end in connec tion with the movement . More and more a ll denominations are craving a religious trust or fe deration and are becoming more and more willing to sacrifice doctrines and principles formerly held dear, in order to accomplish the federation....Evidently th is federation is near at hand; the Scriptures hav e long foretold the Federation, as we have been pointing out therefrom for thir ty years. It is to us one of the special signs of our day, one of the specia l indications marking the end of the Gospel age and the inauguration of Messiah's kingdom.\" Here is a trust fund set up to pay denominati ons to federate , and here is Russell saying this is fulfillment of Scripture. \"Our message was to the Jews as Jews...\""},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"In 1910 and 1911, Jews flock ed to hear a Christian pr eacher. His message at St. Louis (June 11-12, 1911) was \"Zionism, the hope of the world.\" This fatherly figure of a preacher, the likes of which the Jews had never seen before, was C.T. Russell. And he captured many of the Jews' attention if not their hearts. They flocked to his meetin gs. Four thousand Jews listened to this Christian preacher at New York City's Hippodrome on Oct. 9, 1910. Later in London 4,600 went to the Royal Albert Hall (site of many large Masonic gatherings) to hear him, and 800 at the Shoreditch Town Hall. 1,200 Jews came at Manchester, 1,400 Jews turned out at Glasgow, Scotland, and anothe r 5,000 at Cincinnati, OH. What captured their hear ts? Russell sums up his hi ppodrome message, \"We were not preaching Jesus to them. Our message was to the Jews as Jews, from Is. 40:1,2, Comfort ye, comfort ye my people.\" 22 Russell's repeated assurances that he wasn't proselytizing the Jews achieved their goal to calm the fears of wary Jews. Further, Russell had a radical message for his time, Zionism. Russell was a Zion ist before the word existed. Russell's Zionism In 1880, Russell began to predict that the Jews would re turn to Palestine. He wrote an article \"God's Message of Comf ort to the Jews\" telling the world that God had promised the Jewish nat ion would be restored. This article was made into a 32 page Bible Student trac t around Sept., 1881, and reprinted again in tract and newspaper- article forms in Dec. 1887. O ne source also says the booklet was put out in 1912. This Comfort for the Jews is not to be confused with Rutherford's later book in 1925 by the same title. Russell's third book, Thy Kingdom Come, s pends its entire 8th chapter on \"The Restoration of Israel.\" His prophecy about the Jews returning to Isr ael are, in this Author's estimation, his most accurate. The others failed. This pr ophecy goes unmentio ned by today's WT because it clashes with their present light that the nation of Israel is not in God's plan. Russell applauded as he sa w his predictions on Zion ism starting to happen. Russell advertized Dr. T. Herzl's lauching of Zionism. Russell published a Yiddish paper Di Stimme, which circulated in Europe and Ru ssia. With Jewish help it was circulated worldwide. It was especially popular in Poland. The WT Society collaborates with Jewish groups After Russell's death, and wh ile Rutherford, the second WT president was confined in a Federal Penitentiary, the WT headquarte r shifted back from Brooklyn to Pittsburg. The Watchtower magazine on Sept. 1, 1918 prints a revealing letter from the men in Pittsburgh who were running th e Watchtower Society. The le tter equates the Watchtower Society with the Jewish Zionis t movement. Whether the two are actually the same or not, it is evident from this arti cle, that the Watchtower lead ers were not concerned that the Society and the Zion ist movement be identified together. \"On Saturday and Sunday we had the pleasure of heari ng our dear Brother Thorn expound the further unfolding of God's plan. He spoke of the restoration of the Jews to their land, called the attention to the signifi cance of their Passover Supper coming the day following ours, and also to the significanc e of the opening date of the of the recent"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Zionist Congress in Pittsburgh, June 22nd, th e day following a most memorable day in the history of our Society. Note how in this wonder ful sequence of events the ceremonial and governmental features of the movements effected ha ve been kept seperate and distinct. This Congress accomplished more than did the former twenty Zionist conventions put together...\"(WT 1 Sept '18, p.275) It has not been a total secret that Jewish groups were associated with C.T. Russell. \"...Russell interviewed a la rge number of Jewish nota bles and leaders who came to visit him at the central office s of the Witnesses in Brooklyn.\" 23 Some like the Jewish editor of the Bost on Jewish Advocate , Jacob de Haas, a Hassidic Jew and promin ant member of the Munich Zion ist meeting on Aug. 25, 1897, felt Russell had identical religious beliefs to his. Another Jew, Raymond G. Jolly, states about his meeting with Russell, \"I was very much impressed with this godly man...\" 24 So much so that Jolly joined Russell's movement, along with many other Jews. Numerous Jews would become prominant figures in the Watchtower Soci ety including Paul S.L Johnson, John J. Hoefle, and Olin R. Moyle. Many with Jewish heritage would al so find Russell's moveme nt attractive such as Frederick Franz and Nathan Knorr. Early lis ts of Bible Students show that people of Jewish heritage may have ma de up to 20 percent of Russ ell's movement. This Author gives that figure, not as a statistic, but as one of the many fact ors that lead him to conclude that Jews joined Russell faster than the general population. Jews referred to Russell as a \"gre at friend of the Jewish people.\" 25 And Russell did love them, even those who were secular humanists, \"I feel great sympathy for the Jews in their unbelief...\" 26 When the Berlin Conference in 1878 proposed a Zionis t solution to the Jewish question, Russell threw together a hodge-podge of scripture to show that this event in 1878 had to be the beginning of the \"Millenial day.\" This Millenial day would then progress to the restoration of the Jewish Kingdom in 1914. 27 Indeed, one of the plans to restore the Jewish blo odline of David with a united Euro pe with the aid of the European Freemasons was scheduled for 1914, but was delayed due to World War I. 28 One of the undeniable leader s of the Jewish people were the Rothschilds. Pastor Russell wrote the Rothschild s several letters, one of wh ich will be quoted, and the importance of the Rothschilds will be discussed later in chap. 3.3. The B'nai B'rith finances Russell The B'nai B'rith was behind Russell's start. Before explai ning who the B'nai B'rith was and why they suppor ted Russell let's look at some of evidence of the cooperation. Edith Starr Miller, a researc her into international politic s and the causes of social unrest, who managed to position herself in amongst various important people, came upon \"irrefutable evidence\" of the bewilderin g drama of a conspi racy between various organizations. She writ es that the B'nai B'rith was resp onsible for getting Russell started. Frank Goldman, both a member of the Order (as the B'nai B'rith is known) and a Mason, escorted Pastor Russell by car to the Hippodrome for his two hour talk. Jewish financiers had by the wa y rented the Hippodrome for Russ ell. After Russell finished his talk, the Zionist anthem \"Rosh Hoshkana\" was played. Frank Go ldman went on to become the President of the B'nai B'rith."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Interestingly, the B'nai B'rith points out in their Los Angeles B'nai B'rith Messenger 29 their close affinity, \"The Jews themselves are Jehovah's Wi tnesses. In due time, according to prophecy, Jerusalem will be the capital of t he world and Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and other Ancient Worthies' will be resurrect ed and form the nucleus of God's Kingdom on earth. This was the underst anding of Pastor Russell fr om his studies of the prophecies, and he so taught during his long ministry.\" Zionism actually encompasses Russell's visi on for the establishment of a universal Israel, with Jerusalem as world capital. For instance, Yigal Aldon at the United Nations on Sept. 30, 1975 speaking for the nation of Israel (and ther efore in a sense Zionism & Jews worldwide) defines Zionis m, \"Zionism is, in sum, the constant and unrelenting effort to realize the national and universal vision of the Prophets of Israel.\" A national homeland is not enough, the universal kingdom the Talmud says is to be Israel's millenial kingdom is their goal. The Watchtower Society dist ributed a Yiddish periodical Di Stimme (The Voice) all over the world. 30 It was especially attempted to plac e it Russia, to motivate Russian Jews to emigrate to Palestine. Because the paper wa s ostensibly Christian it's distribution came under less restrictions than Jewish literature. The Watchtower Society offered to suppl y the Di Stimme periodical to anyone \"in any quantity—free.\" 31 There seems to have been no botto m line to the financial backing of the WT Society. The same year that the offer was made to supply the Yiddish paper to anyone \"in any quantity—free\", the WT Society's acc ount books claimed a $22,415.93 deficit. \"We doubt not this indebtedness will soon be cancelled; nevertheless th e fact that it is nearly double the shortage of last year cautions us that we must to some extent put on the 'brakes.' \" (WTR 1911,p.4936) So how does the Society show caution and put on the brakes? Does it stop printing and distributing millions of pieces of free Zionist liter ature? No. They have subtly bilked their readers for more donations, but t he pace of the free giveaway of Zionist literature worldwide doesn't abate. The reason for this is given away in the WT of Jan. 1, 1911, p. 4 which quietly reveals that funding came from Jewish sources. The distribution of Di Stimme was aided \"...by Je wish Journals interested in the message...\" Secret backers have always been the secret to Russell's success. In 1882, Russell tells readers, \"...a brother who has already contribute d largely guarantees any debts incurred, to the amount of one thousand dollars in excess of receipts.\" Although there are reports of anonymous donations every now and then of amounts like $9,000 and $1,000, the real underwriting must have been almost a blank check when one examines the WT Society's activities. Further, the ease with which Russell visits , works with, and writes Jewish leaders indicates a close relationship. EVIDENCE OF RUSSELL'S JEWISH HELP STANDS IN COURT Isn't the evidence that the B'nai B'ri th helped Russell's Watchtower Society circumstantial? It wouldn't hold up in court would it? Indeed, it has held up in court. A swiss physician, Dr. Fehrmann, at a pub lic meeting on Jan. 21, 1924 upset some"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"people by asserting the B'nai B'rith and t he International Jews had contributed large financial sums to the \"Ernst Bibel Forscher\" (that is in Sw iss German the Earnest Bible Students which was the name the Russellites— that is th e International Bible Students, the followers of the Watchtower Society were known as.) R.G. Binkele of Zurich charged Dr. Fehrmann with slander on this particular point, and the Dr. in a libel court of law sucessfully defende d his statement. Dr. Fehrmann brought forth a number of pr oofs. One letter entere d as evidence was a Masonic letter from high Ma sonic sources dated 27 Dece mber, 1922. The letter was of unquestionable genuineness and stated, \"W e give them (the Earnest Bible Students), in the usual indirect ways, much money th rough a number of brothers, who during the war made a pile. It won't hurt their fat pocket books. They are Jews.\" Why would Jews support the Christian Pastor Russell? Obviously today the WT Society would be a good investment. And for someone who was trying to destroy t he power of Christianity, the WT Society is very divisive. The Soci ety targets minorities and the lower classes so it isn't quite the threat to someone in the po wer structure. But what about then, in Charles T. Russell's day? Not much attention has be en given this question. The prominent Jew, Jeane Kirkpatrick, who was the U.S.'s amba ssador to the U.N. described Russell's Zionism as \"a neglected chapter\" and concerning his contributions to Zionism, she describes Russell a \"neglected man.\" 32 Such praise is significant. Kirkpatrick is a CFR member, in favor of a One-World-State, and is often praised in the CIA's National Review. 33 Her husband was involved in intelligence in key operations. 34 Pastor Charles T. Russell preached Judaism with a veneer of Christianity. Perhaps no one else has more successf ully passed off Jewish thou ght as Christian, than C.T. Russell. Consider what Russell taught. (Actual quotes documenting these points fo llow later.) Russell said: 1. the Jews would be the principle rulers during the Millenium. 2. That the nations of the world would hav e to become Jews during the Millenium. 3. That God would bl ess the world through the Jewish people 4. Russell advised the Jews to go to their Rabbi's to learn how to protect themselves from Christian teachings. 5. Russell told the Christians they should stop trying to convert the Jews, for it was against God's will to convert them 6. and that it was God's will for Jews to remain Jews. 7. Russell promoted Zionism, an d frequently reprinted articles from leading Jews in the WT. What does Russell do for Christianity? Ever ything sacred to Christianity is attacked. 8. Russell says the Messiah is a collection of Jews, with maybe a few gentiles included. 9. Russell says the Protestant and Catholic Bibles are inaccurate, and that only he could understand the Bible. The WT Society would carry this to its logical conclusion, they produced their own Bible call ed the New World Translation, which true to its makers"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"preconceived ideas, tries to erase the deity of Jesus Christ. 10. Christians are the most guilty and horrible of people. 11. God has not tried to sa ve the world of mankind. If Russell had labelled himself a Jew, he ne ver would have been listened to by the Christians. But by labelling himself the most orthodox of Christians, many Christians bought into his mess age which was the same message some of th e most rabidly anti- Christian Jews have advocated for centuries. Let's read some of the docume ntation on the previous points: 1. Jews will rule the world. After the \"times of the Gentile s\" ends in 1914 Israel will be restored. The Kingdom of David will be restored. 35 \"God has certainly promised a restitution and a glorious futu re to Isreal in the flesh...\" 36 \"The channel th rough which this spiritual and invisible kingdom will operat e amongst men will be t he ancient worthies of Israel. 'Ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom.' In close association wi th these, first to be recognized will be the Jews, natural Israel.\" 37 \"We are interested in the earthly Jerusalem a nd the prosperity about to come to it, when, under Messiah's Kingdom, it shall become the capital of the world.\" 2. Nations must become Jews. God will answer the prayers of the Je ws and fight against the nations. Then the Jewish remnant w ill be restored. The ge ntiles will go up to Jerusalem from year to year, to keep the feast of tabernacles. 38 \"To my understanding, dear friends, the Scriptures are very clear in their statement that this New Covenant will be for Israel only and that all the nations of the world, if they desire to receive the blessings of that cov enant, must come into Israel, so that during the reign of Messiah, which will be for 1,000 years, all nations will be pressing into it that they may become members of Israel, and so the nations will event ually come to be a pa rt of Israel, as the Scriptures say—the seed of Ab raham, like the sands of the seashore, filling the whole earth—and every one who will not become an Is raelite, who will not come into harmony with God, with that divine law, with t he New Covenant, will be cut off in the Second Death.\" 39 2 & 3. In the New Order the worl d is blessed through the Jews. \"All who would enjoy Divine favor and restitution blessings will gladly gather to their standard...will become Israelit es, proselytes, children of Ab raham...all who will obey...will be lifted up, up, up to perfection...\" 40 4. Jews should go to their rabbi to learn how to protect themselves from Christian doctrine. \"Jews should be taught by their rabbis, and should be able to answer such arguments by showing t hat 'the wages of sin is death'... God's Word applies to Jews as well as to Christians- \"My people perish for lack of knowledge;\" This pa ge goes on to say the blessing of the Messianic King dom will come first to the Je w. Also Russell states, \"So far from endeavoring to bring Jews into any of the Christia n denominations, Catholic or Protestant, I would advise the Je ws to stand clear of all of t hem. I seek to point out to the Jew that he has his own Divine promises, whic h are separate and distinct from those of Christians. God's promises to the Jew are all ea rthly. The Israelites are all to come back from the state of death under Messiah's glorious Ki ngdom, which will gradually efface sin"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"and death from the world...\" 41 5. Christians should not conv ert Jews. (See quote pt. 8) 6. It is God's will for Jews to remain Jews . \"The Jew who ceases to be a Jew ceases to look in the proper direction for t he blessings God has promised him.\" 42 7. His promotion of Zionism has already been discussed. 8.The Messiah is basically a gr oup of Jews. \"The hidden My stery is that this great Prophet, Priest and King is not a man, but a Son of God on the spirit plane; and further, the great Messiah is composed of many 'member s,' of which he is the 'Head.'\" Christ is a son not the son and is made up of many people. 43 The church is the Messiah—\"twelve thousand for each of the twel ve tribes of Isreal...\" \"Thi s class as a whole is the Messiah...\" \"Does this make clear my reas ons for not wishing to turn Jews into Presbyterians, Baptists, Roman Catholics, etc. ? Does it make clear my reason for urging Jews to a preparation mentally, morally and physically for the great work that God has for them to do? I hope so...it is my conviction that the Messianic company , all saintly, will be composed more largely of Jews than of any other nationality.\" 44 9. This is discussed in other sections. 10. Christians are the most guilty and horribl e of people. \"Millions of people are being turned away from faith in a God of Love and from faith in the Bible as His Message by the most monstrous blasphemies of the 'dark ages.' I charge the responsibility of all this against the sects and cr eeds of Christendom.\" 45 Christians are the biggest hypocrites in the world. 46 11. God has not tried to save the nations. (Evil people would be resurrected to learn Judaism in the New Order.) From the beginn ing, Russell accepted a very Judiastic outlook. In reviewing the 1877 Three Worlds which Russell agreed with although only helped write one finds... (p. 11)- God has never tried to save mankind. Rather, God gave the gospel to only a select group. God's promises to the Jewish nation are unfulfilled. (p. 7-8)- Christ, which is a group of the elect, subjugates all the nations in the Millenium with \"real subjection\" \"with a rod of iron.\" (p. 12)- \"While under the past Jewish dispensation not a Gentile could be saved...\" (p. 13)- God did not make any effort to save mankind, and they have died without the truth. Why? Scriptures tell us that God ma de it \"unlawful to give the children's meat to dogs\". Also, says Russell and Barbour, wh y did Christ command his disciples \"Go not in the way of the Gentiles...\" \"He (God's so n) did not come, at his first advent, to save the world;...He did not ev en pray for the world, 'I pr ay not for the world.' (John 17 9).\" (p. 14)- \"If God has been trying to save t he world during the gospel dispensation, He has made as great a failur e as during the Jewish Age.\""},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"This Author would direct the reader to a 12 part series of articles Ru ssell wrote for the Overland Monthly. Each was entitled \"God's C hosen People\". The individual articles had titles which dealt with the following iss ues: how faith was the foundation of Jewish character, how the Jews could revive their faith in Judaism, how Israel had a \"double\", about the Jubilee of restoratio n, the Passover, the Sabbath, Yom Kippur, Zionism, Must Jews Become Christians in Order to Receiv e Divine Favor?, plus three other topics related   to   Jews.   THE \"CHOSEN PEOPLE-STRONG STUFF The concept that the Jews are the Chos en people who will eventually rule the world forms the basis of Rabbinical Judaism . In the Cabala, even more than the Talmud (and the original Talmud is pre tty strong stuff), the concep t of world-dominion is even more noticable. The Zohar accepts it as an accepted fact. The Toldoth Noah, folio 63b (de Pauly's trans., I p. 373) st ates, \"the Feast of Tabernacles is the period when Israel triumphs over the other people of the world; that is why dur ing this feast we seize the Loulab and carry it as a trophy to show t hat we have conquered all the other peoples known as 'populace' and that we dominate them.\" The Zohar relates that the kings of the world will end by declaring war on the Messiah. But \"the Holy One, blessed by He, will display His force and exterminate them from the world.\" (Zohar, se ction Schemoth, folio 7 and 9b; section Beschalah, folio 5 8b -de Pauly's tran s., III. 32,36,41,260) WHAT IS ZIONISM? A popular misconception among the Goyim (gent iles) is that Zionism is simply a desire of the Jews for a small place to call home. The WT Society itself is aware that Zionism entails more. On page 296 of their tenth Souvenir Report, \"Many Hebrews of the United States believe that t he whole course of world even ts is now favorable to the Zionist movement, and that the day is near when their aims will be realized and the Jews, as a united people, will become one of the most powerful factors in the modern world.\" But when they needed to still opposition to taking over Palistine from the arabs, the B'nai B'rith told the public, The Jews of neither America nor any other of the democratic lands will return to Palestine.*\" At that time (before the state of Israel) the B'nai B'rith sounded lik e the Jewish people were loyal to the countries they lived in, and harbored no desire to go to Israel. THE HATIKVAH The Hatikvah (\"The Hope\") to return to Er etz Yisrael (\"Israel\") didn't start with Theodor Herzl, but goes back to the Tenak h (the Hebrew O.T.) But by and large the modern movement has been led by secular Jews along with cultic and occultic Jewish leaders. A secular messianism has also per vaded Judiasm where the modern state of Israel is believed to be the world's Messiah. The one-world-conspiracy has distorted so many people into a deterministic eschatological frame of mind . This mindset is that God's will has preordain ed in heaven that this state of Is rael would be grea t. Therefore, to oppose it is wicked. Many Chri stian leaders and Jewish leaders take this one step further and give Israel a blank check to do whatever they want without any moral responsibility. Persecution has fallen on Goyim who have had the audacity to reprint what the Talmud says on conquering the world and Jewish rulers hip. One dare not criticize the large gay community in Tel Aviv, nor talk about the Je wish prostitutes there, nor talk about the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Mossad running drugs fo r profit, nor about the terrori sm done by Jews to the Palestinians-many of them Christians. One dar e not talk about Christian church services being shot up by Uzis, and innocent Christian ministers being beat up by Israeli soldiers. RUSSELL SAYS THE JEWS ARE SUPER IOR MORALLY & INTELLECTUALLY Russell preached that the Jews are superior to Christians morally and in tellectually. \"Judged in this broad, general way, who will dis pute that the twelve millions of Jews are not in advance of the average of Chri stendom intellectua lly and morally?\" 48 That's quite appropriate fo r a man who has turned the Messiah basically into a collection of Jews. Russell's hatr ed for Christianity, could serv e the interests of any group bent on Christendom's de struction. The reader will learn more of how these various anti-Christian group relate. Whether justified or not, many Jews see the source of th eir problems as Christians. Most of the various groups working toward a one-world government are united in their hatred for Christianity. That fa ct doesn't automatically mean t hey are all in collusion, but it is a tell-tale sign of thei r similar origins. After their collusion is established, the investigator becomes aware it is an important element of their collusion. This Author is reminded of when he visited a synagogue Shabbat (w hat gentiles call \"S abbath\") service, and how his Jewish host clearly lumped all Chri stians into the category of evil and anti- Jewish. He was not alone, sections of Ch icago and New York, would oblige any Christian desiring actual Martyrdom.

Without the support of the common peoples that wicked sy stem called 'Christendom' could not survive...instead of heeding the message...those constituting the unholy alliance...continue to oppress...The doom of 'organi zed Christianity' or Babyl on is sealed.\" (WT 10/15/27 p. 312, cf. Babylon the Great, p. 559 an d a host of other WT references.) In contrast, the WT Society doesn't a ttack the modern Jewish religion, or its adherents, except with mild jabs. \"But what grieves me today is the large scale voluntary assim ilation (into Christian society) especially am ong Jewish Youths.\" (A modern day follower of Russell, Bible Student Kenneth W. Rawson) 49 THE HOLOCAUST Today, men like CBS's Norman Lear (who is into humanis m and the New Age) like to blame Christianity for the Holocaust. Lear 's \"Sunday Dinner\" hero Ben is used in one scene to blame Christians for the Holocaust. The WT Society has been accusing Christians of the same for years. 50 The truth is that many Ch ristians opposed the Nazi regime and lost their life for it. 51 The truth is that many Chri stians risked their lives to save Jews. 52 The truth is that many Chri stians died in the Holocaust. 53 Even Jewish sources will admit that many of the people rounded up as Jews, were not even Jews. 54 The Nazis preferred to error on side of killing more than needed, rather than not enough. 55 The truth is the Nazis did try a final solution, the Holocaust, 56 and their new religion what is now known as the New Age reli gion, with its belief in reincarnation helped alliviate any guilt. 57 The Truth is that much of wh at is shown the public about the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" When reading Jewish books written for Jewish readership this Author has repeatedly bumped into remarks mentioning the KEHILLA.

Be rational and think about su ch things. Was the Swastika a hindu or a Christian symbol? Did the Masonic Lodges or the Christians use the Swastika as a symbol before W.W. II? The Masonic Lodge s and the Theosophic Lodges used it. TIEING IT ALL TOGETHER This may be getting quite confusing. Init ially, this book descr ibes Russell's belief in a Sun-god, later this book shows Russell, a Jew financ ed by Jews, was preaching Judaism with a veil of Christ ianity, and finally this chapte r speaks of a New Age religion. Isn't this contradictory? No, and this book will cover all this in due time. Joseph Campbell shows an old synagogue with a picture showing Sun-god worship was part of the synagogue, in his book on Myths. 60 As one gets into where modern day Judaism is derived and what the Talmud an d Cabbala are about, an invest igator finds that they are a continuation of Babylonian magic and paganism. They are occultic. But then how widespread is the Caballa among the Jews? Fo r the religious elements it is extensive. Judaism has become a cultural and tr aditional ritual for many Jews. 61 The small group of Karaites, Samaritans, and the larger grou ps of Messianic Jews (Christian Jews) have rejected the Caballa. The Caballa, which came from Babylon, forms the basis for many if not all the Satanic, Magic, and occultic Fraternal Societies. 63 Further on, this book will show how the sy ncretism of the New Age movement has no problem including each of these religious stra ins, and who, why, an d how it was brought it to the West. The New Age mo vement itself tosses various things together like a tossed salad. I know this is difficult to envisio n for many readers, per haps one example will suffice until later. When this Author lived in Nepal, many people were both Buddhists and Hindus. The Hindi world-view can and does accomodate most anythi ng but the Moslem religion and real Christianity. Hinduism is many things to many people. Caryl Matrisciana who also lived in that area of the world, and was active in the New Age movement concurs with this Author in her book God's of the New Age that the New Age is basically Hinduism. Does that mean the New Age isn't related to the occult and Babylon? Hinduism and Babylon's religion are closely related. For in stance, the God Moloch goes by the names Pluto, Saturn, Kali(Hinduism), and Durga. (S ee Spin diagrams) A w hole book could be written on the interweaving of religious ideas between Greece, Egypt, Babylon and India. Such as Hinduism's Shiva relates to Jupite r. From Babylon came Rabbinic Judaism. The speculative Kaballah is pantheistic. The Ancien t Mystery schools' wisd om is taught by the Jews today according to \"Academies\", Jew. Encyc., p.67. Just one more of the many examples of how far reaching the interweaving is, Horus of Egypt (sometimes depicted as an evil adversary in the fo rm of a snake) finds its counte rpart in Calyia the Snake God that Krishna, the 8th inca rnation of Vishnu, killed. Zionist James P. Warburg of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. told the U.S. Se nate that we were"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"going to get a one-world-governm ent, whether we liked it or not. The only question is, whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent. 63 Another member of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. the Jewish legal office r Louis Marshall said, \"Zionism is but an incident of a far-reaching plan.\" 6 Russell was fully aware that the Declaration of Independence of the Zionist State (published in The Jewish World, Feb. 9, 1883) said \"The great ideal of Judaism is...that the whole world shall be imbued with Jewish teaching, and that in a Univer sal Brotherhood of Nations-a great er Judaism in fact-all the separate races and religions shall disappear.\" When one realizes that that Judaism today (aka Rabbinic Judaism, earlier aka Pharisism, aka Babylonian occult ism) would like to be world-wide, and one observes the New Age movement is sp reading world-wide, what this mean? It is apparent powerful forces ar e trying to move us away from Christ's teachings. The question can be raised, is it unfair to put down Judaism's go al of world-wide conquest when Christians envision the world wi ll be entirely Christianized at some point in the future? It depends. If Christians want to conquer the world like during the Crusades, then yes the Christians are s ubject to censor too. The Ta lmud doesn't portray a peaceful conquest of the world—but sl aughter of the \"cattle\" gentile s. (The author has in his possession photocopies of several different modern Jewish documents spelling out present day plans to carry out su ch a ruthless bloody conquest.) In informing people about the New Age \"A quarian Conspiracy\", as New Age writer Marilyn Ferguson calls it, she states on pg. 63 of her book who the people are who are supporting the New Age Conspiracy. \"Maveri ck theologians and members of the clergy pondered \"the new spirituality\" that rose as churches declin ed. There were networks of innovative, \"transpersonal\" educators, cauc uses of legislators, and a melding of economists-futurists-managers-engineers-sy stems theorists, all seeking creative, humanistic alternatives. A few captains of industry and finance. F oundation officials and university programmers, arti sts and musicians, publishers and television producers. A surprising clutch of celebrities. Scions of Old American Wealth. Ex-political radicals, minus their rhetoric, now in pos itions of influence.\" As you r ead further in this book, you'll learn more about who these people are. Th e Scions of Old Amer ican Wealth can be found in groups like the Skull and Bones Order. The publish ers and televisions producers are Jews and Masons. (See other chapters.) Thafs right, the Jews own and operate all three major networks, and the major newspapers and publi shing houses. On pg. 367 she states, that the reli gious backgrounds of a poll she took indicat ed 20 % of the Aquarian Conspirators were Jewish. What is perhaps not known, is the prominant positions that so many Jews are playing. See the footnote for a list of some of these. 65 The B'nai B'rith According to Jewish leader Rabbi Meir Kahne of the Jewish Defense League the Jewish leaders such as Adler, Schiff, Mars hall, Seligman, Loeb, and Warburg formed the B'nai B'rith and the ADL. 66 Actually, although these men were prominant in the B'nai B'rith, the origins of the B'nai B'rith also ties in with the Masonic Lodge. Twelve men on Oct. 13, 1843, in NYC began the Order of the B'nai B'rith. 67 Most of them were Freemasons and Odd Fellows. 68 "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" Philip Klulznick, B'nai B'rith president ( 1953-1959), heads a delegation of presidents of sixteen major Jewish organizations me eting with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in October 1954 on American policy regarding Is rael and the Middle East. These cooperativ e efforts led to the establishment of the Conference of Presidents of Major Americ an Jewish Organizations to coor dinate American Jewish policy o n Israel."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"For the first sixty years the B'nai B'rith was patterned after the Masonic Lodge. The Masonic Lodge had in turn also been pattern ed to a large degree from the synagogue, with a smattering of witchcra ft added. Because they were patterned af ter the Masons and the Oddfellows, the B'nai B'rith was secret, benevolent , exclusive, and fraternal. 70 In contrast to the Masonic Lodges wh ich were open to a ll religions and types, the B'nai B'rith admits only Jews. But in contrast with the Masonic Lodges which are very select in selecting upper crust candidates, the B'nai B'rith accepted men of low social status. In this regard, it was in the fashion of the Oddfellows. This Auth or believes it was the need to establish a secret Jewish fraternity open to the rank an d file Jew, that moti vated the establishment of the Order (as the B' nai B'rith is called.) The founder taking his cue from the Masons billed his fraternal Order as non- religious and non-sectarian. And then in typical masonic fashi on at the same time called the Order as \"the restoration of the Id eal synagogue, which had ceased to exist.\" 71 This gives us a further clue as to Russell's connection to t he B'nai B'rith, in that the B'nai B'rith set out to Reform the Jewish religi on into the Masonic religion. The B'nai B'rith was associated with Reform Judaism after it was drafted in 1885. Reform Judaism's centers of power were Pittsburgh and Broo klyn, the two cities Russell operated his headquarters from. BROOKLYN N.Y., JEWISH CENTER OF POWER Crown Heights Section of Brooklyn is just for JWs but is also the world headquarters of the world's \"best organiz ed and most dedicated Jewish or ganization in the world,\" the Habad of the Lubavich, at 77 0 Eastern Parkway. The Nati onal Council of Churches reported in 1957 that there were 1,077,000 Jewish synagogue members in Kings Co.,NY and 556,000 in the Bronx. 72 THE B'NAI B'RITH (THE ORDER) & THE MASONS The connections of the Order to Masonr y are certain. One Mason exposed quite a bit when he wrote about the B' nai B'rith having a made a se cret treaty with Masonry. 73 Albert Pike and Armand Levi co ncluded this secret treaty. There are numerous cases of the lead ers of the B'nai B'rith also being Freemasons. There are also num erous cases of leading member s of the Order promoting socialism and communism. An example of this is that the Grand Mast er of the Order (of the B'nai B'rith) in Russia in 1917 was al so a 32 degree Free mason and one of the leaders of the Socialist Revolution. 74 THE ORDER WINS ITS FIGHT FOR CONTROL Various Jewish leaders have fought to prevent the B'nai B'ri th from capturing control of the Jewish people, but they were not successful. As this book will show the Christians also have not been successful either , for many of the Christian leaders are marching to a Masonic agenda too. Many of the Rabbis toda y are members of the Or der, which has in the neighborhood of a half m illion members and ha s membership all over the world. 75 One of the Order says, The question of who speaks for the Jews has no single"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"answer. B'nai B'rith ha s urged its own primacy, first on the grounds of its secular and national character, then, a fter the ADL's establishment, on the premise that whoever defends American Jews leads them. Since B'nai B'rith has represented a cross-section of Jews, it perceives itself as deserving to sit at the head of Jewry's communal table.\" 76 The U.S. president recognizes their pr imacy. And since 19 54, has sponsored a Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations headed by the B'nai B'rith to coordinate the American governmen t's Jewish policy with respect to Israel. 77 \"A SECULAR SYNAGOGUE\" Those Jews that are tied to the moral values of the Old Testament, are being subverted, and humanism is bei ng promoted. For instance, the B'nai B'rith has promoted all kinds of Jewish education, that has elim inated much of the Jewish religious teaching. 78 The B'nai B'rith in the 1970s began to fe el that the seperatio n of the sexes was an artificial relic to be done away with. 79 The Order in 1913 started the Anti Defamation League (ADL). This gro up organized long before the Nazi brown shirts, has used tactics on the level of the Mafia. Thei r radical leaders have repeatedly gone on record as having contempt for all laws, believing in the end is justified by any means. 80 Rabbi Meir Kahane removes all doubt about how da ngerous he is in his book Th e Anti Defamation League. A comprehensive dossier on JDLs bombings, killings and maim ings is in the book The Zionist Terror Network. They apparently have power within the Christian ranks, because they are able to mobilize Christians fo r their causes when they need to. 81 It is believed by many students of Masonry that the B'nai B'rith has issu ed orders to various Masonic orders. If the B'nai B'rith has some influence on the Freemas ons, it would explain why the ADL has influence within the ranks of fundam entalists and liberal Christians.(For more info on this refe r to chapter 2.1) The ADL has been exposed conspiring with the FBI. 82 And its leader Meir Kahane worked for the CIA prior to starting up with the ADL. 83 JEWS SPEAK UP People of Jewish heritage ha ve all kinds of opinions . Some have bravely spoken as one Jewish man, \"I am anti-Zionist. Jewi sh chauvinism is no less despicable than other kinds of chauvinism and more despicable than many si nce it is based on racist ideology. In the dispute betwee n Israel and the 900, 000 Arab refugees it had driven from their lands, I support the Arabs.\" 84 Jewish writer Kenneth M. Mitzner, in The Wanderer (June 29, 1989) encourages Christians to opose those Jewish forces that are corrupting the morals of this country. He writes, \"It was not anti-G erman to oppose Nazism, nor anti-Russian to oppose Bolshevism. It is not anti-Semitic to oppose th e forces within the Je wish community which are waging war against you and your family.\" Jack Bernstein, a Jew, tell s in his book how corruptio n, graft, persecutions and dangers are forced upon thos e Jews who want to be Jewish but no t Zionists. Another Jew, Henry H. Klein exposes th at the certain Jews are out to control this country and the world no matter what they have to do in his book A Jew Exposes the Jewish World Conspiracy.

Sam Swain will say the proper things he can get financing from the B'nai B'rith. 85 Some of the nominal Christia ns willing to work with the B'nai B'rith are those of Jewish heritage. Th e B'nai B'rith magazine itself has written articles about the widespre ad practice of Jews who have pretende d to become Christians. 86 The B'nai B'rith has sponsored the Nation al Conference of Jews and Christians, and under the auspices of the Order Protesta nt, Catholic, and Jewi sh speakers appeared together in the year of 1939 at 10,000 meetings in 2,000 communities in all the U.S. states. 87 While carrying on such c onferences, the Order has ac tively pursued the removal of all Christian books from school libraries , have forced numerous Passion plays to shut down, and threatened Christian ministers fo r discussing the cruc ifixion on the radio. 88 New Testament Scriptures specifically des cribe the anti-Christ as those denying that Jesus is the Christ. At one point even the Almighty declared of the Hebrews, \"How long will this people provoke me?\" But Jesus called hi s disciples to love, and if the Christian can not love the Jew, and the Jew the Palestin ian, and the Palestinian the Jew, how can each of these love God. And if there are men among the Christians who want power, the Christian should follow the example of hi s Master Jesus Christ, and return good for evil. Those who live by the sword will die by it. Th ose who live by power will die by it. Zionism's goal of real estate is not as im portant as the relationship of each Jewish person to his creator. This aut hor would like to see each Je wish person have spiritual power. The religion that C.T. Russell was helped to create, has taken away from its adherents the most precious legacy of the Je w Jesus Christ. That is that God loves each of his children, and has given them the chan ce to be his sons an d daughters, and to receive the Holy Spir it to guide them. Notes I.

Christians, they sa y, are obviously evil for C hristians are not promoting the name Jehovah. Although it is true the Bibl e has a Tetragrammaton, even the Jehovah's Witnesses admit in their lit erature that Jehovah is not the proper pronounciation, in fact it is known to be a Middle Age invention. What is not widely known is the importance that the word Jehovah has played in Black Magic and Freemasonry. The word was introduced into Freemasonry, not in a Chri stian context but in a magical context. Albert G. Mackey, 33 degree, one of the highest respected Masonic authorities for the Masons states in his Encyclo paedia of Freemasonry, Vol. I, 1871, \"JEHOVAH is, of all the signi ficant words of Masonry, by far the mo st important. Reghellini very properly calls it 'the basis of our dogma and of our mysteries.'.. .The history of the introduction of this word into the ritualism of Freemasonry would be highly interesting, were it not so ob scure. Being in almost all respects an esoter ic symbol... That this name, in its mystical use, was not unknown to the Medieval Freemasons there can be no doubt... It is now conceded, from indisp utable evidence, that the holy name was, in the earlier years, and, indeed, up to the mi ddle of the last century, attached to the Third Degree, and then called the Master's Word...Third Degree refers to 'the mystic word, the Tetragrammaton.'\" 1 What was the esoteric, mystical use of the word Jehovah? It stood for what Medieval Cabalists and other practitioners of magic called their Satanic Holy Trinity. E.M. Butler an expert on Magic writes in his book Ritual Magic that \"...the 'triple name' could stand for ADON AY, ZEBOATH, JEHOVAH or for JEHOVAH, EMMANUEL, ZAMEH (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) or any ot her of the variant holy names by which the deity was invoked in black magic. With this exception, the invoca tion, although there is a learned Renaissance flavour about it, fo llows orthodox lines, and the word valeat instead of salveat represent s ... rather subtle attemp t to make the invocation blasphemous. It certainly is at odds with 'Jehovah's name forward and backward anagrammatized' (a pithy poetical way of des cribing the method us ed by Kabbalists to determine the seventy-two names for God), and also with the abbreviated names of the saints in the circle. It makes nonsense too of the conclusion: \"By Jehovah, hell and the holy water which I now sprinkle, and the sign of the Cross, which I now make.' lt would be worse than useless, it would be in the highest degree dangerous, to call on the name of the 'triple deity' who had just been dismissed (however courteously) from the circle.\" 2 "},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The frequent use of the word Jehovah by Joseph Smith, Jr., and Charles T. Russell was the impact of Masonry on their lives . C.T. Russell disliked Christ's name so much he wrote the word Christmas as X-mas in his personal letters. 3 Joseph Rutherford, who was involved in the occult, elevated th e name. Jehovah even more, and downplayed the name of Christ. There are many solid Scri ptural reasons why Jehovah is not the name that Christians are to promote and worship, but that is a topi c in itself. The point though is that a balanced view of sc ripture in no way de mands that Joseph Rutherford's worship of the word Jehovah be adop ted. The over emphasis thes e men placed on it, was due to their contact with the occult. WHO FIRST PROMOTED THE WORD JEHOVAH? \"It was the Kabbalists who emphasized th e mystery surrounding the letter JHVH by referring to the name they represented as the 'word of four le tter', TETRAGRAMMATON, and this caught on like wild-fire in the ma gical texts. Few indeed and far between are those modern rituals in which that awe-inspiring name does not occupy the place of honour.\" 4 From a group of JW elders at my house came the adv ice, \"If you will say a prayer using Jehovah's name, a nd say it with lots of will powe r, you can count on it working.\" Folks, those elders don't know it—but that 's Kabbalistic Magic. Unfortunately, not knowing history well, they do not realize who promoted the name Jehovah for centuries— the Magicians of the Kaballist Jews. THE MASONIC HOLY TRINITY But if the Caballists believe in a Holy Trinity doesn't t hat make them Christians? \"The Cabala is Occult Science itself. It is the secret theology of the initiates, theology essentially Satanic. In a word counter-theology. Our God, the God of the Christians, is the power of ev il in the eyes of the Cabalist s; and for them the power of good, the real God, is Lucifer.\" \"One cannot be a convinced Cabalist wi thout soon becomi ng a magician and devoting oneself to the pr actices of occultism.\" 5 This explains why many of the famous magicians such as Harry Houdini 6 have been Jewish Freemasons. In Freemasonry at the Kadosch the triangle is inverted to re present Lucifer, who is said to be the Very Holy an d Indivisible Trinity to which the Kadosch take s his oath of blind obedience. The Grand Insp ector Inquisitor Commander ta kes his oath to this Very Holy and Indivisible Trinity of Lucifer also. 7 This is clearly desc ribed in the 33 degree French Mason Domenico Ma rgiotta's book Le Culte de la Nature dans la Franc-Maconnerie universelle. Is the reade r surprised that a Mason would publish something saying their Holy Trinity is the Trinity of Lucifer? Mackey in his Ency. of Freemasonry, 1887 ed., p.617 explains that \"The objection to treatises and disquisitions on Masonic subjects, that ther e is danger through them of giving too much light to the world without, ha s not the slightest supp ort from experience. In England, in France, and in Germany, scarcely any restriction has been observed by"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Masonic writers, except as to what is emphatically esoter ic; and yet we do not believe that the profane world is wiser in those countries than in our own in respect to the secrets of Freemasonry. In the face of these pub lications, the world wit hout has remained as ignorant of... our art, as if no work had ever been written on the su bject.... The truth is that men who are not Ma sons never read authentic Masonic works. They have no interest in the topics discussed,... \" This Author agrees with Mackey. When this Author has tried to show what the Masons are about, few people will even accord the courtesy of ev en a few seconds of their time. Even when people ar e willing to spend a few minu tes, how can a few moments dispel all the Masonic smokescreens. Some read that the Masons believe in a Holy Trinity and conclude they are solid Ch ristians. If such men believed in the Christian Trinity, why have most of the most anti- Christian philosophers and writ ers been fervent Freemasons? Masonry and Christianity are not the same, nor are their trinities. \"Theurgy is the highest degree of occu ltism. Necromancy is limited to the summoning of dead souls, but the Theurgists of the ninete enth century evoke entities qualified by them as genii, ang els of light, exalted spirits, sp irits of fire etc. In their meetings, scattered throughout the world, they worship Lu cifer. The three mysterious letters J... B ... M.... that the common in itiates see in the Masonic Temples, are reproduced in the meeting rooms of the Lu ciferians, but they no longer mean Jakin, Bohaz, Mahabone, as in the Lodges, nor Jacques Bourguignon Molay, as with the Knights Kadosch; in Theurgy these three letters mean; Je sus Bethlemitus Maledictus. Theurgy is therefore pure Satanism.\" 8 The Cabalists and Masons profess to prac tice white magic and refer to Theurgy as black magic. What the reader sees here is a common tactic by the devote Satanists. They rename or slightly disguise their symbolism and foister it upon groups of people that don't know what they are really worshipping or ge tting into. Albert Pike states in Moral and Dogma that the lower levels are deceived. 9 They have been dece ived from the very beginning of the Masonic Lo dge. The Masonic symbolism from the beginning has its origins in the occult. It use of Christian symbols is esoteric. TOPIC OF CHAPTER This chapter will explore the relationsh ip of Watchtower symbology and their special words to the Ma sons and the occult. A VISITOR The young blond girl in a patterned dress at my door stammere d and shook a little as a Matronly older woma n looked on and observed her memorized presentation. \"This is the great issue that fa ces everyone,\" she said jitterly."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"And indeed the cover of her Watchtower magazine 10 said, \"The Great Issue Faces You,\" along with a picture of an old man with stars surrounding him. As a scholar of the Watchtower Society, my curiosity was aroused, What is the great issue? Her visit had caught our family at an unfor tunate time when I couldn't invite them in. I took her magazines, and silently prayed she'd keep her word to return on her back call, which she didn't unfortunately. I opened the magazine. What is the great issue—was it sin? That certainly was Christ's great issue, his ce ntral message was man's slaver y to sin. He preached that theme from several different an gles. The captives he came to set free were the captives of sin. Those he was able to bl ess, were those poor in spiri t, that is those who realized their sinful nature. The apostle Paul cont inued Christ's message on sin. \"This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Ch rist Jesus.\" (Rom. 3:22-24) Even the Apostle John, a favorite among the Masons and other esoteric groups made sin the great issue. \"If we claim to be without sin, we dece ive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\" (I Jn. 1:8,9) So what was the Watchtower's Great Issue? At the end of page three, wh ich is the first article, we learn the answer, \"In fact, the great issue facing each one of us is whether we accept or reject the sovereignty of God, \"whose name alone is JEHOVA H.\" Having been associated with Jehovah's Witnesses, I knew that the issue of God's Sovereignt y meant Jehovah's name. For instance, Moses had done all he did to Pharoah and the Egypti ans the JWs had instructed me, solely to teach them his name is pronounced Jehovah. Knowing this, it was fairly ce rtain what would follow in the Watchtower article, \"The time must come when he will re solve all aspects of this issu e of sovereignty in harmony with his own stated purpos e: \"They will have to kn ow that I am Jehovah.\" 11 And there they did it again. The WT Soc. has taken a Bi blical concept the Sovereinty of God and perverte d it into a test of \"Are th ey promoting the word Jehovah or not?\" The real issue is not whether some magica l word Jehovah is promoted or not. The issue is sin."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"If you want words the Hare Krishna's have magical words. \"Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Krishna Krishan, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, \" they chant. If you want magical words the Maharishi Mahe sh Yogi will give you for around $20 a mantra (the name of some Hindu deity picked especially for you) to relax with. These groups all have plenty of magical words to save us, bu t what do they say about sin? Transcendental Meditation (TM) says sin is a state of mind. Hare Krishnas see sin as something that can be purged with eating, clapping and dancing. The Watchtower Society chooses to believe that the results of sin can be ig nored, for in the New order sinfull mankind will teach himself to be perfec t with the aid of 144,000 elite teachers. The guilt, the horror, and the need for confession of sin eludes thei r religious teachings. Christianity realizes sin, realizes the guilt man has, his need to confess his sin to God, and his need to rely on God for salvation. WHAT IS THE WATCHTOWER'S REASON FOR USING THE TERM \"NEW WORLD\" & \"NEW ORDER\"? The WTs answer to the public was given in the WT May 1, 1987 issue pg.30. Their answer is that the greek word kosmos allows them to fitti ngly speak of a coming \"new world.\" To quote, \"But the Bi blical use of Ko'smos allows for a Christian to speak of a 'new world' when referring to the coming Paradise restored on earth.\" This answer is good fodder for brain-washed androids, but is not a responsible answer at all. Strong's Concordance's Greek dictionary indicates that the word kosmos (word #2889 in the dict.) probably came from a root word meaning or derly arrangement such as a decoration, and by implication means the world. The Bible however does not speak anywhere of a new world order or a new order. AT-ONE-MENT Did Russell coin the breakdown of the word atonement into At-one-ment? Hardly, the Christian Scientists and the Ma sons were using such phrase ology before Russell. Russell used it as the title of an approx. 500 page bo ok he put out in 1899. An example of the Masonic use of the term is an article in the Mar. 1923 New Age Magazine entitled \"TOWARD AT-ONE-MENT\". 12 Notes 1. Mackey, Albert G.

The Masonic Watchtowers The Masonic Lodges are usually given a number and then are named after the location they are at. For instance, in Oregon something like 9 out 10 lodges are named after the town that they are in. Howeve r, some of the lodges are nam ed after famous Masons such as Franklin, Lafeyette, and Washington. Other s are named after Masonic themes Mystic Tie, Mystic Circle, Rising Sun, New Jerusalem, and Miz pah. Mizpah? What is Mizpah. The Watchtower Society tells us in the issue of the Golden Age 3/26/24, p. 387, that Mizpah translates Watchtower. The word Hebr ew word Mizpah (also spelled Mizpeh, and Mitspeh) occurs only once in scripture. 1 And the use of the word Mizpah among the Masons is interesting. This Author has located 4 Masonic chapte rs so far in the world that are named Mizpah, and three of these are in C.T. Russell's area of Pennslyvannia. These are all York Rite (R.A.M-Royal Arch Masons) l odges like Russell belonged to. They are Mizpeh Chapter No. 288 R.A.M. of A llegheny, PA, Mizpah Chapter No . 252 R.A.M.

What could be important enough to Masonry to call their lodges Watchtowers? The highest Masons which get cryp tic and mystic, are exposed to Enochian magic, where the use of the Magical Watc htowers is the key, the heart so to speak, of Enochian Magic. It is interesting to note that several of the Masons who founded new cults were fascinated in the name and per son of Enoch, for instance Joseph Smith, Jr. and Charles T. Russell. Joseph Smith gave himself the name Enoch, called his first community the City of Enoch, and created the communal Order of Enoc h. Further, Joseph Smith, following the Jewish pseudepigraphic Book of Enoch's story, purports to narrate Enoch's experiences in the Book of Moses. (Jos eph Smith, as the reader re members, wrote the Book of Moses.) Joseph Smith in fact believed that Freemasonry went back to Enoch. Freemasons believed that the correct pron unciation of the sacred name of the Tetragrammaton had been revealed to Enoch. 2 In Enochian magic the Tetragrammaton plays an important part. Each letter represents a diffe rent element. In Joseph Smith's day it was popular for Masons to trac e Freemasonry back to Enoch. It is not so much in vogue now. \"...Enoch may be considered as representative of that class of mankind which in the future will be in harmony with God and have eternal life—the ones who will be brought to perfection during the Millenn ial Age.\"—Charles T. Russell, 1907 3 Russell was careful not to exceed what he could back with scripture, and he was not about to break his Masonic oath of se crecy and blab about Enoch and Enochian magic. However, Russell can still be recognized as having put an in ordinate amount of emphasis on Enoch. What happ ened to Enoch \"seems to be one of the secret things which Moses says belong unto God. Deut. 29:29\" WT Apr. & May 1884. Russell pointed out on numerous occasions th at Enoch was the 7th man fr om Adam, this meaning he was the perfect man. This view was still coming out in the WT as late as 1941. 4 The WT Society has been fascinated by Enoch's tran sformation, but have be en varible in their explanation of it. In 1943, t he WT Society tells us that \"Enoch was put into a trance\" 5 That \"God gave him a final vision of the New World...\" 6 and that when scripture says \"transferred Him\" in Heb. 11:5 that meant God granted Enoch a vision of the New World. 7 This was a change from Russe ll's speculation that God may have taken Enoch to another planet. Also that year, the WT Society tells us that Enoch was the first man to prophecy of Christ. 8 This is just a glimpse of Russell and the WT Society's fascinatio n with Enoch. Now we will discover what En ochian Magic is about. THE MAGICAL WATCHTOWERS Twice a month, a magazine called the Watchtower goes out in 105 languages in about 13 million per issue. (Actually minor foreign language editions lag behind the English editions, so that the 13 million copies are no t issued simu ltaneously.) Yet no one has explained why Charles T. Russell chose the Watch Tower as the name and center idea of his new religion. Many return to the Bible movements like"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Campbell's Church of Christ churches, have eschewed be ing associated with any symbology. The idea of the Watch Tower must have been very important for Russell to have situated it as the central symbol for his movement. Was he thinking that a tower towered him above others? Or was it be cause ancient Watch Towers could view approaching armies and thereby warn of approac hing battles. Or wa s it chosen because Masons have been associated with building castle s and cathedrals? Each of these explanations put forth, has some merit. But there is another explanation. One that seems bi zarre, so bizarre that this author dismissed it until such time as he was able to confirm C.T. Russell' s Masonic membership. C.T. Russell's membership records in t he Masonic Knights Templar are kept in Ireland. The Blue Lodge records belong to the Grand Lodge of PA. Lady Queenborough in her book Occult Theocrac y published in 1933 notes on page 737 C.T.Russell's masonic membership. His Masonic membership must hav e also been common knowledge to those associated with him, and th ose acquainted with the prom inence Russell gave to the Knights Templar logo. Before diving into the evidence of this chapter, this author would like to interject that the idea that Russell used the Second Adventists as the source for the name Watch Tower was the first theory this author considered. Russell a ssociated with Adventists and moved in Adventist circles during the years leading up to the publication of Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence. Th e Adventists frequently used the word Watchman as part of the titles of their periodi cals. However, after closer-examination this author dismissed the Adventist origin as an in complete explanation, for it doedn't really explain what happen ed. First, the original concept seemed to be as much the idea of a Tower rather than a Watchtower. Russell's prin ting firm was initially called the Tower Co. and only later became the Watch Tower. Is one to believe that later Russell substituted \"Watchtower\" for his company name of Towe r because the Adventists use \"Watchman\" at a time when Russell was trying to distance himself from the Adv entists? Bear in mind that under discussion is one of Russell's ce ntral symbols of his movement — the other at that time was the Knight's Templar logo. So the decisi on to use the word \"Watchtower\" was not trivial or accidental, but a very important decision. The name of Russell's religious publishing co mpany had to express someth ing important to Russell. Russell by this time was trying to distance hi mself from the Adventists, trying to remove the idea he was with them. Also noteworthy, Russell does not make any fuss about the word Watchtower. He selects it, but is silent about its importance to him. This silence needs to be taken into account by any expl anation of the origin of the title \"the Watchtower.\" Second, when this author su rveyed the entire range of Second Adventist periodicals (about 30) printed prior to Russell's Zion's Watc h Tower, I discovered 8 of these used the word Watchman in the titl e but not one used the concept of a Watch Tower. Why would Russell in the beginning, when his movement was really Adventist, substitute the magazine title Wa tchtower for the very popular Adventist title of Watchman? While there were no Adventist magazines prio r to Russell's Watchtow er magazine that used the word Watchtower, it appears that the Masonic magazine Mizpah could have served as example to Russell. The Masoni c Mizpah magazine, and a masonic article in"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"an early Masonic Review with th e title \"Watchman what of th e night\" do prove a similarity here between that Masonic thin king and Russell's Magazine. Evidence shows C.T. Russell was not only a high Freemason, but prominent in their schemes, in other words he was a key pl ayer. Watchtowers are very important to the very highest Freemasons. The highest secret knowledge of many Masonic rites including such rites as the Scotti sh Rite, the Rite of Memphis, the Rite of Mizraim, etc. is concentrated in a high leve l group of llluminati. The basic group of the llluminati is the O.T.O. The initials O.T.O. c an stand for a several names fo r this group one being Ordo Templi Orientis (The Order of Oriental Templa rs). Its esoteric name is Order of To Ov. Its members also have been referred to as the Great Whit e Brotherhood or Atlantean Adepts, and have worked with the B'nai B'rith. The O.T.O. llluminati teach t heir select group of initiates Hermetic Science (occult knowledge), magick (called Holy Magick of Light), Mysticism, and Yoga of all forms. The O.T.O. during C.T. Russell's lifetime establis hed in every important metropolitan area, including New York, a secret hidden cent er (Collegium ad Spiritum Santum) where members could carry out t heir \"great work\" concealed without interference. However, each llluminati is not hing if he is not able to practice the Magick that gives him a knowledge of the Watchtowers and the ability to enter the four Watchtowers. Is this bizarre? Why doesn' t C.T. Russell mention any of this in his writings? This author must unreservably without any do ubt in his mind advise the reader that C.T. Russell would never hav e mentioned anything of hi s higher esoteric Masonic knowledge to anyone. The pena lties for such higher secrets are harsh. This author knows of some cases that th e men were killed. Obviously without presenting, any proof on that point, the reader can simply know that the higher echelons in the esoteric group of llluminism rarely lose their initiates, because they are so sold out to the occult. This author as a teenager studied the life of Benjam in Franklin, in order to emulate his great character. Benjamin Franklin gi ves no hint in his Autobiogra phy of his intense activities in the Freemasons. Franklin wa s the Grand Master of the oc cultic Grand Orient Masons in France, and participated in many weird unchristian activities. Benjamin Franklin although hailed by many Christ ians as a Christian was not a Christian, in fact he gave money to a Synagogue. But the bottom line is that, a great man like Franklin, whose life was closely watched, could still ge t away with keeping his Masonic activiti es fairly secret. Only the avid historian, or the average Maso n, is aware of his Ma sonic membership, let alone what he did in the lodge or with his Masonic brothers. C.T. Russell was in the pu blic eye. Everything he published was with the public eye in mind. No one should expe ct to find any notes or slips about Masonic activities or beliefs in Russell's writings. C.T. Russell followed a policy of backing everything he said with a scripture. If he could not establish a point by twisting scripture in some fashion, th en he would try not to"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"publish the point. What needs th en to be looked for are-occu ltic strains of thought that seeped into his Bible explanat ions, because they had a possible scriptural explanation. There are a fair number of statements by Russe ll that seem to be ev idence of ties to the magic of Watchtowers, but this Author must strongly emphasize that this is not written as proof that Russell used the term Watchtower because of its magi c meaning. No, this chapter presents this material or evidence because to date this possible explanation has been unpublished, (Indeed, th is author knows of no one else who has observed a possible magical explanation for the title Watchtower.) and this author feels it ought to be placed on the table for consideration, for investigation and possibl y even rejection (if additional evidence can suffi ce to solve this mystery.) WHAT ARE THE MAGICAL WATCHTOWERS? Watchtowers are regions of the Magical Universe. The type of Magic that uses these regions is called Enochian Magick. According to occultists, Magic is merely the use of hidden laws to bring about the will. Every person has a spark of divinity— an inner God, also called an angel or Holy Guardian Angel. The Magician is to get in t ouch with his Angel—his divinity. This is where his knowledge of the Watchtowers is help ful. Enochian Magick claims for itself two unique elements: an or iginal language, and the map of the indivisible worlds. The Indivisible worlds are known as the Magical Universe. The map of this Magical Universe contains 4 Enochian regions called Watchtower s. These are the Watchtower of Fire, the Watchtower of Air, the Watchtower of Wate r, and the Watchtower of Earth. These 4 regions are often symbolized in ancient es oteric manuscripts. The following are the 7 planes and their regions on the map: Occult Planes Enochian regions Divine........... ------------ Spiritual.........Tablet of Union Causal ........... Watchtower of Fire Mental ...........Watchtower of Air Astral ........... Watchtower of Water Etheric .......... Watchtower of Earth Physical......... ------------- Should all the bodies of the pl anes (except for the physical) be collectively taken together, the Magician calls this the Body of Light. Ne w Age, Masonic, and Rosicrucian Magicians will then speak in terms of le aving their bodies and enteri ng into the Watchtowers (the Body of Light). To be an advanced magician, you must be able to enter the Watchtowers. It is an established fact the llluminists all learn this Magic and practice it. Could there be some connection between C.T. Russell and th e llluminists who practice Enochian Magick?"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"In order to answer this, this chapter will explore a. the history of Enochian Magic (to be divided 3 ways: early, since Sir John De e, and certain Masons worthy of study), b. clues in Russell's works that may indica te a connection in thought with Enochian Magick. WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF ENOCHIAN MAGIC? The history of Enochian M agick is tied in part to the history of the masonic Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Sir John Dee (1527-1608) made Enochian Magic known to the esoteric initiates of the Eliz abethian Era. However, the roots of Enochian Magick go back before Dr. John Dee. The name of this magic comes from Enoch. Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, relates that some Jews identi fied Enoch as the Sun God. Th is identification can be better understood knowing that the Hebrew word we translate Enoch comes from the Hebrew word chanak (pronounced khaw-nak') meaning to initiate or disci pline. Note also in Gen. 5:21-23 that Enoch lived exactly 365 years. Enoch, the Initiator, living 365 days, as the Sun God gave his name to Enochian Magic. Esoteric thought from Egypt was learned by the Greeks. Hermes was originally an Egyptian. Hermetic thought and Pythagorean thought (secrets of Geometry), including magic, have been passed down through the years by secret groups. Today, geometry is merely a field of ma th dealing with shapes and numbers, but throughout history geomet ry has been viewed as sacred. Sacred geometry revealed to man the unifying principle of the divine architect of the world. God's mind and glory was revealed in shape and numbers. Even toda y the New Agers and Satanists place an importance on the geometric shap es of circles, triangles, and squares. Geometry, the study of shapes and number s, became sacred to both Judiasm and Islam. Note the importance of the geometric patterns on their mosques and synagogues. Geometry was held to be tied to the Creator' s mind, and to reveal his mast er plan. It is well-documented that leading operative masons during the Mi ddle Ages also had knowledge of not only sacred geometry, and both its building and m ystical purposes, but al so were philosophers, and mystics. The origin of this sacred geometric scienc e is clearer when one notes that its big revival in Western Europe, resulted from the infusion of Greek thought into Italy which resulted in the Renaissance. Remember that the Eastern half of the Roman Empire calied later Byzantine, which had as its center Greece, never fell to invaders. The wisdom of the mystery schools and the ancient greek philosophers and scientists was still intact until the Byzantine Empire's capital of Constantinople fell in 1453 to the Islamic Turks. The vast libraries of Greece which dated material back to Alexandria, Egypt were moved to Italy where they spawned th e Renaissance. Forty years late r Ferdinand and Isabella by expelling the Jews from Spain created anot her movement of people and ideas. These two influxes of people and their esoteric know ledge are believed to be the single most important contributing factor to the Rena issance. The Flemish Renaissance resulted"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"because the Netherlands belonged to Spain, and fleeing Jews went both to Italy and to the Netherlands. From the Ne therlands and Italy esoteric knowledge went to the house of Guise and Lorraine. An example of how esoteric knowledge then became associated with the royal house of Guise and Lorraine, is that the first edition of Corpus herm eticum (pub. in 1549) was dedicated to Charles de Guise, the Ca rdinal of Lorraine an d brother of Marie de Guise, who married James V of Scotland and who bore Mary Queen of Scots. Under the cover of being zealous Catholics, the h ouse of Guise and Lorraine spread esoteric knowledge. Me n like Sir William Sinclair impo rted the esoteric knowledge into Scotland. Another figure was the Scotsman, James Beaton, the Scottish ambassordor to France , who was also the former Ar chbishop of Glasgow and who worked with the house of Guise and Lorraine. SIR JOHN DEE INTRODUCES ENOCHIAN MAGIC Esoteric knowledge spread to England before Ireland. A famous Welchman, Dr. John Dee, created a center for estoteric studies. Sir John Dee, was the court astrologer for Queen Elizabeth. He also was a brilliant magician, ph ysician, philoso pher, alchemist, Cabbalist, mathematician, scientist, and di plomatic emissary. This model of the Renaissance man lay the groundwork for modern speculat ive Freemasonry. He lectured on the Continent to the great European univ ersities on Geometry. Sir John Dee was fully aware and spoke about the idea of Plato about the Great Architect of the Universe, for which sacred geometry is a method to understand this gr eat architect's mind. In the preface Dee wrote for Henry Billi ngley's translation of Euclid published in 1570, Dee refers to Plato as \"Divine Plato.\" Sir John Dee is credited for founding a type of Magick called Enochian Magick. (Practitioners of magic ofte n spell magic with a k.) He believed he could conjure up Angels. And he was convinced that the angels he conjured up with magic were not demons. 9 John Dee believed he was descended from th e tribe of Dan, and that the Queen of England and him were related to the Brutus and the city of Troy. He also associated himself intensely with the King Arthur leg ends, and his belief th at the England had a destiny to rule the world. 10 Dee had a politico-re ligious program for the imperial destiny of Queen Elizabeth I. This expansion was based on the belief that Elizabeth was descended from King Arthur, wh o was supposedly also a desc endent of Troy which had been settled by the tribe of Dan, and that the Queen had a re ligious duty to conquer the world. He managed to convince the Queen to follow through on these ideas. Francis A. Yates has described this belief system in hi s book Astraea. The Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century (197 5). Dee received a vision of a vast universal religion. A good portion of the Christian caballists in Europe at that time were converted Jews. 11 Dee's library contained thous ands of books, including Lullist works, Pico della Mirandola and Reuchlin. He had Agrippa's De occulta philosophia, and the 1545 edition of the Latin version of Giorgi's De harm onia mundi. Agrippa was an cabbalist. Giorgi"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"wrote on achitechtural symbolism, the sa cred geometry and combines cabalism letter- mysticism and Pythagoro-Plat onic theory to create hi s own synthesis of these. Dee was very influential with the Earl of Leichester and his secret son Sir Francis Bacon. The puritan Edmund Spencer the poet was also Caballist Neo-Platonist. 12 Dee's idea of an architect is more a descrip tion of an esoteric intiate, he writes, \"I thinke, that none can justly account themselves Architects, of the suddeyne. But they onely, who from their childes yeares ascend ying by these degrees of knowledges, beyng fostered up with the atteyning of many lang uages and Artes, have wonne to the high Tabernacle of Architecture...the Name of Architecture, is of the principalitie, which this Science hath, above all other Artes. And Plato a ffirmeth, the Architect to be Master over all .... The reader has a better appreciation of the significance of Russell's references to God as being the Great Architect or the Divi ne Architect or Great Architect of the Universe. This masonic buzz word for God, allows us to see the connection between Russell and those who prac ticed sacred geometry. In 1603, a scion of the Guise-Lorranne families became King James of England. Scottish families at this point in history ca rried their estoric knowledge to Ulster, Ireland, where over two centuries later Russell's family , originally from Scotland would be living before coming to the New World at Allegheny, PA. One of Sir John Dee's principle disciples was Robert Fludd. Fludd and Francis Bacon spread esoteric thought through the Rosicrucian chan nels. This esoteric thought came the full circle back to England when Johann Valentin Andrea created the lodge system to protect the Rosicrucians, and some of these lodges emigrated to England. These later became the \"Invis ible College of the Rosicruc ians\", and later became the famous Royal Society. In a Rosicrucian wo rk from Germany A Go lden Treatise on the Philosopher's Stone (print ed 1625) on the page entitled \"T he only true way ... to attain true perfection.\", there is a paragraph labell ed \"Enigma\". Two towers must be passed to get the true believer to where he is going. Th e sun god is also referred to on this page. A rare plate from Elias Ashmole's Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum also throws light upon the subject. The plate is named the \"Key to the Grea t Philosophical Secret\". It states the Philosopher's stone is a macrocosm and a microcosm of the universe. It shows four areas which correspond to the four Watc htower areas of the Magical Universe. They are Ignis(fire), Aer(air), Te ra(earth), and Aqua(water). Before dealing with how those who practiced Enochi an Magic might have had a common goal or worked with C.T. Russell, let us examine some of t he items in Russell's writings that seem to connect him wi th Enochian Magic and its Watchtowers. The idea of planes of existence is an im portant Enochian Magic idea. In Russell's first book, pp. 225-237 a bi g issue is made of 6 planes of existence.

The clergyman had been imprisoned in for sedition against the state. The man was Samuel Rutherford, and his radical hatred of the state, and his advocacy of disobedience to it on religious grounds, seems to be a foreshadowing of his de scendent Joseph Franklin Rutherford, who would on June 21, 1918 be sentenced to twenty years in the Atlanta Pen for sedition against the United States government. THE UNEDITED STORY The whole story of Joseph F. Rutherford may never be know n. But the unedited story will be presented, especially in regards to the Masons, the New Age and power. Joseph was bom at Versa illes, MO and grew up 11 in the rolling farm land of Morgan Co., Missouri. 12 He was ambitious. His father wanted him to remain on the farm, but he wanted to become someone important. He had always had hi gh goals for himself, nove l goals at that. His goals were novel in part due to his great imagination. 14 Joseph had his flights into fantasy, 15 and from the eviden ce available actually channeled with what he felt were spirit beings. 16 He liked to call attention to himself and his theatrics. His booming voice, six foot figure, and emotional earnestness made him a dynamic speaker. He wa s not interested in accumulating wealth, 17 but he did like the fine life. 18 He lectured all over the United Stat es, and travelled throughout Europe and the Middle East. 19 One Watchtower source says, \"Probably no man in the world was clos er to Pastor Russell than Mr. Rutherford .\" This is simply a big lie. Rutherford had made himself obnoxious to the point, Russell had exiled him away from headquarters. Russell even pa id him to leave. Rutherford was very sensitive. He seethed at his treatment by Russell. Russell stepped on his toes numerous times. In one case, Rutherford wrote a complaint to Russell abou t his treatment, and Russell did the wrong thing considering the sensitive feelings of Rutherford. Russe ll printed the complaint in the WT magazine. 20 Alexander Hugh Macmillan, another man of Scottish bl ood, was responsible for Rutherford join ing the Society. 21 Apparently Rutherfo rd, who was a big read er, purchased three books by Russell. While sick at home he happened to look at Russell's books. 22 Joseph Rutherford had become a lawyer, and up to this point had not shown any interest in spiritual matters in his life. He knew pr actically nothing about the Bible, 23 and did not attend church, although his parents were Baptists. But he liked what Pastor Russell ta ught. And his friend A.H. Macmillan who was prominant in th e WT Society, was able to ge t Rutherford pos itions in the Society. Rutherford becam e the Society's lawyer, and went to court numerous times to defend Russell in court. After 1907, all the legal matters of th e Society were handled by Rutherford. 24 "},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"A.H. Macmillan's friendship with Rutherford was an important one. A. H. Macmillan claimed he had been put in charge of the Watchtower Society when Russell was gone. (Macmillan, A.H. Faith on the March, p.70) Macmillan along w ith his cohort Van Amburgh, the Society's accountant used their power to get Rutherford into the WT Presidentcy. (F aith on the March, p. 68) As is common knowledge, Rutherfo rd took turns filling in as a special judge in the absence of any regular judge of the Eighth Judical Circuit Court of Boonville, MO. This happened before he became associated with the Bible Students. Because of this the Jehovah's Witnesses called Joseph Rutherford, Judge Rutherford. It was a term he liked. The Judge stated, \"My purpose is good toward all.\" But his actions came across entirely different. 27 \" When Russell died all pandemonium broke out,\" a Bible Student said. Rutherford's ability to take firm command of a situation was pu t into motion. Out of hi s L.A. exile he came, and by force of his personality, legal trickery, an d some nasty power gra bbing tactics took charge of the situation. He e xpelled 31 Bethel workers. 28 And being the trail bl azer that he was, he renounced all the former guide lines and followed his own ideas rather th an Russell's. He took the Society out of the rut that the cult around Russell had the Society in. Many that were loyal to Russell left the Society. It is important to understand Rutherford's na ture to think for himself. It was so extreme that he found it difficult to conform to any regu lations. He set his own guidelines. He was always resisting anyone thinking for him. 29 Consequently, because the Judg e liked alcoholic beverages, he was an alcoholic, and even created the sa me attitude among some of his associates. 30 He encouraged JWs to break the pr ohibition laws and smuggle alcohol. 31 Because the Judge liked certain women, he had his girlfriends, 32 even though the script ures condemn adultery. Mysterious, distant, reserved, a nd cold, Rutherford is remembered best for his greed for power. With dictatorial powers came th e ability to live in luxu ry at the Society's expense. His life of luxury during the depression is hardly known to Jehovah's Witnesses t oday, but it included the use of several mansions, several 16-cylinder Pa ckards, the best liquors money could buy, and all his desires for comfort. He rarely spent tim e with his invalid wife, who lived in California. 33 It is hard to picture Rutherford as a Ma son. He was so narrow- minded and had so many prejudices that it isn't likely that he would have been asked or wo uld have cared to joined. None the less it would not be beyond the realm of possibility, considering th at some of his friends were some of the most powerful Masons in the United States. Initially Rutherford had worked for three time Presidential nominee, and Secretary of State and Arch-Mason William Jennings Bryan (1860-1925). Rutherford had a friend in the in the U.S. Senate, a German-born Jew from Cumberland, Md. named George Louis Wellington, who also was a banker and president of Edison Electric Illuminating Co. 34 Sen. Wellington was a leading Freemason (32° and a Knight Templar). Wellington was also an Oddfellow, an d Elks, and a Knights of Pythias. Wellington's family had to leave England during Mary Tudor's reign and move to Germany. His mother's maiden name was Meyer. She was Jewish. 34a Certain Bible Students have claimed that Ru ssell was murdered. They believed that certain men J.F. Rutherford, W.E. Van Amburgh, R.H. Hirsh (J ewish), Morton Edgar (Scottish), Morton's brother Edgar, C.J. Woodworth (Methodist pare nts), Paul S.L. Johnson (Jewish), Czeslaw Kasprzykowski, A.H.

They believed that some poison was slipped past Russell's foodtaster. 35 They think the body was gotten off the train at the next stop and embalmed quickly to hide the murder. According to Macmillan, Menta Sturgeon took the body to an quack embalmer a nd got Russell into a $20 casket. 36 It would be hard to determine anything now about Russell's body because the 5 foot thick foundation of the pyramid which is over Russell is reinforced with lots of barbed wire, 37 and at least one WT reference says that Russell was crem ated before being laid under the pyramid after having lain in state in Brooklyn and Pittsburgh. Russell's body was cremated after three days in the good Rosicrucian fashion. It is the Rosicrucian's belief that the spirit within the body must be given this time. The WT Society at the time owned th e Union Cemetary, 38 and later placed a decoy tombstone with Russell's name to de ceive people as to the real burial spot. Perhaps the second most vital position of the WT Society was the L ondon office, as it helped with the European and Commonwealth work . Paul S.L. Johnson, a Jew, had been assigned this position by Russell. Paul Johnson had for so me time thought Russell had selected him to suceed, 39 and a majority of the Directors thought so to. 40 For a while the London office and British Guinea were loyal to John son rather than Rutherford. 41 But Rutherford tricked the law into believing that the four Dir ectors who opposed him were illeg al, and forced their dismissal. 42 Then he had the upper hand. The motive for murder would have been power and money. Rutherford and his friends like Macmillan to ok over the Society. Rutherford became a recluse. 43 He gradually solidified his power and wealth. He had the use of several Packards, and several mansions, even in Europe. 44 [text missing] On Feb. 8, 1942, Rutherford died according to one WT reference with his boots on. 70 Some older Bible Students on the West Coast say he fell down the stairs drunk. His death was kept secret for several days, and the local Sa n Diego Union paper didn't get the scoop until the 10th, three days later, and printed a story the 11t h. His estranged son Malc olm C. (also a lawyer) and his neglected wife, who he had ignored for year s, Mary M. Rutherford lived in Los Angeles. His live-in secretary Bonnie Boyd was with him at his Beth Sarim mansion when he died, and signed his death certificate. Afte rwards she married a man name d W.P. Heath and dropped out of the picture. It appears his death was kept secret until the petty power struggle between the Triumpirate in Bethel was ironed out. Still wh y his death was wrapped in secrecy is not known for sure. His burial was kept secret because he wanted to be buried at Beth Sarim which was outside of any cemetary zone. In a fitting tribute to a man who had no respect for anyone else's opinion nor was ever governed by anyone else's rule, Rutherford was buried secretly against city ordinances at Beth Sarim. 71 Three months later a lone una ccompanied hearse pulled up to Woodrow Cemetery and a mock fu neral was held in the Staten Island dawn by a select group of Jehovah's Witnesses. 72 The death certificate says Rutherford died of uremic acid which he had had for 1 month, due to Carcinoma Rectum which he had had for 18 months due to Pelvic metastasis which he had had for 6 years. In exploring the relationship of the WT So ciety to the One-World-Conspiracy several items can be mentioned in relation to Rutherford."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"1) What ever Rutherford d ecided to do, he would have done it, for he was not guided by moral scruples, but his own ideas. 2) Rutherford had some powerful friends. He had campaigned w ith William Jennings Bryan's presidential campaign, worked with civic groups 73 and groups like the Masons, 74 and had friends like Congressman Blackburn Barrett Dovener of W. Va., a lawyer. 75 3) He had some pull with some newspapers, for instance, the National Labor Tribune of Pittsburgh ran his sermon on Thurs. May 9,1918. 4) His modus operandi to cover over the controve rsy over the widespread use of a demonic oeji healing device by Jehovah's Witne sses was to allow Goodrich to wr ite an article against it, and then to refute Goodrich's article in a subsequent issue, and then to proclaim the issue closed to discussion. 76 In light of this and other similar coverups it is not out of the question that the anti- masonic article reprinted in the WT in 1930 may have been merely a subterfuge. Was Paul Johnson slated by the B'nai B'rith to take over the WT Society? Was Rutherford and his close henchmen tried on sediti on, because they upset the plans of the B' nai B'rith to put their man in? Did Rutherford strike a deal at some point with th e Powers? Circumstantial evidence points to Rutherford agreeing to some kind of working relationshi p with the Conspiracy. Or did the One-world-government planners support both sides of the struggle for power over the WT Society? There was a noticable change in Rutherford during the 1920's. He began channeling. He wrote that wicked angels worked their sins off by bringing messages to th e earth for God. Since his messages from these spirit beings have proved false, the conclusion is they were demonic. After God's channel to redeem the angels had di ed, the WT described his death in these words, \"Brother Rutherford's advancing on to great er fields of activity, by Jehovah's grace...\" 77 NOTES 11.

New Age leaders who have been illuminated by the Brotherhood of the Great Whit e Lodge have been helped by and promoted by the Freemasons. Most New Age channellers are not Masons, nor are they expected to be to receive Masonic sympathy.

Another New Age Bible given by the spirit \"god\" to Michael Mathiesen warns that man will be severely punished unless mankind organizes into a 1-world-government by the year 2000. Mathiesen titled his 442 page \"Bible \" The New American Bible. Interestingly, this message of a coming Golden Age paradise has been given thousands of times to New Age channelers. Often the spirits mention that a cataclysmic or series of cataclysmic events must precede the New World System. Yes, the terminology and message happens to be identical to message given to Rutherford by t he spirits who channeled to him. Interestingly, the parallels don't end here. The Watchtower Society came out with a Bible called New World Translation. It is apparent that portions of that t ranslation borrow from translations which were channeled, such as Johannes Greber's translation. THE STRANGEST CONNECTION The channeling connection betwe en the Watchtower Society, the Freemasons, and the New Age is indeed the strang est type of connection, because it sugges ts a supernatural power is coordinating such \"new light.\" For a while it appeared that the idea of the Devil was going to disappear from Western culture.

However, seve ral New Agers have confided with the Author that at some point t hey discovered the spirits revealed their demonic identity to them. One famous New Age leader who found out that these spirit gui des were demons was Randall Baer. It is believed Randall N. Baer was murdered for revealing too much about the New Age Movemen t. His book Inside the New Age Nightmare tells the story of someone who left his channeling when he realized he was serving demons. The reader should read his book to fully appreciate why Baer after y ears of being a New Age leader concluded that Satan and his dem ons were the spirit guides of the New Age. Baer tells the compelling story of how the spirits had power, indeed a supernatural power, and were not simply figments of the mind. The skeptic of supern atural events, will at least concede from his book that these spirit guides are believed to be real by the people w ho communicate with them. Some examples of New Age channeler Baer's conclusions concerning such spirit guides are. Public channeling is mass hypno sis. \"Through speech cadence, orchestrated body and hand movements, voice inflections, and invisible demonic powers that fill the room, the sp irit weaves a hypnotic web of rainbow-gilded infiltration. Not only do the participants take in false informat ion but, more deeply, they absorb the permeating influences of the de mon's formidable powers into the heart, mind, soul, and spirit. Often, a type of open-eyed trance-state overtakes the listeners with a sense of relaxation, pleasant tingling sensations, and rapt fascination with the goings-on. 3 It is refreshing to see B aer, like so few prophets ever do, reveal that the \"psychic power s ultimately draw upon demonic principalities as their source of power.\" 4 \"Channeling is indeed a blending, a merging, a touching, between humans and disincarnate spir its. However, behind the oh- so-friendly and wise fascade are demons who touch to deceive, blend to invade, and merge to possess. T hey come with an olive branch of peace, love and universal brotherho od in one hand, and a smoking gun concealed behind their back in the other.\" 5 "},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Baer became a Christian when he discovered that these spirits were demons. Other New Agers who ha ve told their stories to this Author also came to Christ when they realized that demons were the spirits that were controlling them. Baer praised the Lord God for his salvation from \"Satan's New A ge Movement\" and for the true freedom and salvation received through Christ Jesus. He turned his back on all his New Age practices and his demon Ascended Masters. Baer felt the New Age Kingdom was a delusion. \"The ultimate paradox for New Agers is that they believe the lie that they are heading for the New Age Kingdom-on-earth. All the while, they're really following a Satan-conspired path to destruction.\" 6 If Baer's insight from his year s of leading the New Age can be applied to the Watchtower's channeler Rutherford, then Rutherford was part of a demonic conspiracy. At the very least even if some readers are very skeptical of this whole thing, they must recognize the many similarities between Rutherford and the New Age channelers. There are more similarities. T he similarities go back to such things a Russell believing that Cyrus (who was supposedly an incarnation of the sun god and worshipped by his people as such) was a foreshadowing of Christ. Zoroaster was also viewed by Russell as a great prophet 7 (and is also tied to the sun and its worship. One of the Ascended Masters is Zoroaster. Elizabeth Clare Prophet has channeled Zoroaster's messages. The Masons also look to Zor oaster. Their New Age magazine calls this Persian prophet a \"noble\" prophet. 8 In another article, of the New Age Magazine (Nov. 1922, p.658,) 32 o Mason M.M.

GOD BECOMES GRAND MASTER On Tuesday, 23 November, 1954 a slim, reti cent, kindly man took the stand in the Right Honorable James Latham Clyde's courtroom. 1 The man's name was Frederick William Franz, who besides Russell and Ruther ford, has contributed more leadership for the Jehovah's Witnesses than any other m an. He was then Vice-President and later became the President of the Watchtower Society. When he got older, arrangements were taken to place the power in the hand s of others. While Nathan Knorr was still President, prior to Franz succeeding him, the Governing Body removed much of the power of the President of the WT Society. 2 This was a curious phenomena which will be discussed later.

FRED FRANZ, AN EARL Y WT RELIGIOUS LEADER Fred Franz, before joining the Watchtower Society, had studied to be a Presbyterian minister. 3 In 1913, while C.T. Russell was still co nsidered the Faithful and Wise Servant, Fred Franz joined. 4 He was soon promoted to prominen ce in the Society, and as an early key player was a key speaker already in the early 1920s. 5 In 1924, he delievered talks over the WT Society's radio-station WBBR. 6 Some observers think he may have played a greater role in format ion of the Watchtower's Theol ogy during Rutherford's time, than is generally credited him. Fred Franz remained a bachelor for his lifetim e. As part of the Bethel Headquarters, he lived simply, although like other WT leaders because of their power he rarely lacked anything. He went on trips to places like Israel and Ireland. He earned a reputation of being friendly and of not being se lf-conscious to the point he'd walk around headquarters in slippers and mismatched socks. 7 THE WT SOCIETY'S SCHOLAR He was also the Societ y's Bible Scholar by virtue of a few college classes in Hebrew and Greek. Because he was thei r most skilled leader (his nephew Ray Franz would prove equally as adept until Ray's conscience bothered him), Fred's skill came under scrutiny at the Douglas Walsch Trial on that Tuesday. Much time and effort was spent in court on witnesses, to uncover the story behind the controversial New World"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Translation of the Bible. It is clear from testimony that day, and that testimony is colloborated by testimony from other sources, that Fred Franz, as the Society's leading scholar, played a crucial role in the production of the NWT. When asked, \"Insofar as translation of th e Bible itself is undertaken, are you responsible for that?\" To which Fred Franz answered, \"I have been authorized to examine a translation and determine its accuracy and recommend its ac ceptance in the form in which it is submitted.\" 8 The New World Translatio n was billed by the WT Society as the most literal translation available. The NWT itself expr esses this, for instance, on pg . 9 of the Forward, of the 1950 ed., \"We offer no paraphrase of the Scri ptures. Our endeavor all through has been to give as literal a translation as possible, where the modern Engl ish idiom allows and where a literal rendition does not for any clumsiness hide the thought. That way we can best meet the desire of thos e who are scrupulous for getting, as nearly as possible, word for word, the exact statement of the original.\" The anonymous Translating committee revi sed in 1961 and 1970 the NWT. They declare that \"An effort was put forth to bring about even greate r consistency in the renderings of the related parts of the Holy Scriptures,... the purpos e was to attain to closer conformity to the literal reading in the original languages. All this process has resulted in revisions in the ma in text of the translation.\" 9 According to one source con nected with the translating committee, the translating committee sat around a table with 20-30 differe nt translations, and went verse by verse picking the version that fit their theology best. Sometimes they relied upon Johannes Greber's spirit channelled translation. Whether this is exactly how they created their \"t ranslation\", is not crit ical at this point. The reader is asked to bear in mind, three pertinent items— a. That the translation was an a ttempt to be the most literal translation possible. In this they have succeeded in points to where it is hardly readabl e. However, all translations must paraphrase to some degree, the language s involved are not constructed so that word for word translations could make sense. In other words, they do paraphrase in spite of their denials, but they have managed to produce a very lit eral translation. (This is not to imply that they used the best ancient manuscripts, just that they tried to be literal with the ones they chose.) b. Fred Franz directed and edited the wo rk. He gave the final approval and recommendation to print. c. Other translations were consulted, if my sources are accurate , other translations formed the base or were re lied upon heavily. The wordin g of the NWT supports this information. So what? It's important to the discussion, because Fred Franz gives his Masonic membership away, when he tran slates at Hosea 12:14 the Hebrew word adonai= Lord as \"grand master\"."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"The word \"adonai\" is literally Lord. It is a si ngle word that simply calls for its simple, direct, straightforward translation as Lord. I ndeed, almost all translations (with a few minor exeptions) translate \"adoni\" in Hos ea 12:14 as Lord, the Watchtower itself translates the word everywher e else in their NWT correct ly as Lord. There is no conceivable, pl ausible explanation for calling God the \"g rand Master\" except that it is a subtle signal of his Masonic membership. Even if we believe that the committee merely borrowed from other translations, there are no other translations t hat call God the grand Master at Hosea 12:14. For in stance, Young's Literal, the N AS, NIV, NEB, AV, NKJ, and others simply use the obvious word Lord. An exception is the Jerusalem Bible which interjects \"Yahweh\". In this instance, th e Catholic translation does a better job of promoting Gc s name than the Watchtower Society. MORE EVIDENCE OF FRAN Z'S MASONIC MEMBERSHIP Other clues about Fred Franz's masonic me mbership have surf aced. The greatest evidence has been br ought to light by another researcher. His firsthand research (which is at some point to be published) may deal with the issue even more indepth.) 10 Certainly, if the New Order's plans are defeated it will owe a big debt to men like Russ Pi ne, who have labored hard to bring to light the actions of the conspiracy to unite the world under their political, economic, an d religious domination. FRANZ'S BACKGROUND Franz is a German Jewish surname. 11 It is interesting to note that the locations of Russell's hometown, Pittsburgh, and Franz's hometown are centers of Jewish thought and power. T he location that Russell moved his headquarters to from Pitts burgh, Brooklyn, N.Y., is the center of Jewish power and thought in the world. As this author trave lled through Israel, the question was never are you an American, but many times, are you from New Yo rk? because so many Jews recide in New York City. Someone who went to the University of Ci ncinnati with Franz wa s Sidney S. Tedeshe, who was a Jewish Freemason, and a Rabbi after graduation. Tede she graduated from both the University of Cincinnati and the He brew Union College in 1913. He later got a Ph.D. from Yale in 1928. He became th e Rabbi of Union Temple in Brooklyn, NY. 12 Frederick's father was Edward Frederick Fr anz. He was apparently a German of Jewish heritage who professed to be of the Lutheran Church. Fr ederick's parents made a big display of Fred and his brother 's Lutheran baptismal certific ates which were framed and hung on the wall for all to see. Fred and his brothers though were not sent at school age to a Lutheran school but to St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church parocial school. According to Fred, he took part in Catholic Mass and in going to the Catholic confessional. (Cat holics were expected to go to confession before Mass unt il after Vatican II when it quit being a rule.) Before he entered 3rd grade, his family moved to Cinc inatti, OH which is across the river from Covington, KT. When they move d to Cincinnati, Fred and his brothers started attending the Second Presbyterian Church of Cincinnat i where he had Bessie O'Barr as his Sunday School teacher, and a Mr. Fisher as his Sunday school superintendant. 13 Franz's family's changeability raises questions. Having Lutheran relati ves, this author is fully aware of the deep ties, devotion, and stubborn loyalty many Lutherans have to ward their church. To"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"prominently display the infant baptismal cert ificates, etc. makes one wonder if this religiousness was a show c onsidering how quickly they could switch churches. A RHODES SCHOLAR? Fred Franz and the WT Society have clai med he rejected the offer of a Rhodes Scholarship to work for the WT Society. 14 While making this claim to enhance Frederick Franz's scholastic credentials, it actually undercuts the reputation of his character in several ways. First, the Rhodes Scholarship people in response to querries have said Franz wasn't selected. On the surface it appea rs Franz has lied. To have \"rejected\" it means Franz is claiming it was offered to him. Even if Franz had sat through a personal interview with an election commi ttee (which in the U.S. select s 32 scholars), and then was not selected— that is not the same as \"rej ecting\" an offer of a Rhodes Scholarship. Did Franz lie? Perhaps he didn't. Just maybe a secret offer of a Rhodes Scholarship did occur. If secret feelers had been put ou t, concerning whether he would want to go to Oxford or not, he just may have secretly rejected such an offer. What? MYSTERIES OF THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIP Cecil Rhodes was a British mu ltimillionaire who during his lif e time was deeply involved in secret societies and his vision of a unit ed world. His vision of a united world under B'rit-ish rule (that in Hebrew means the rule of the Covenant Peop le, and is a way to legitimatize their One-World State) was a big part of his life early on. By age 22, he had already drawn up a will to l eave his money for the purpos e of furthering the British empire. 15 Cecil Rhodes was a Scottish Rite Mason. 16 He contributed the land upon which the Bulawayo Lodge No. 2566, Rhodesia built a Masonic Temple. 17 He established the Rhodes Scholarships which to no surprise have tended to go to Masons and people sympathetic to his visi on of a One-World-State. 18 Cecil Rhodes, along with some of his friends like the Rothschilds, fo unded a secret society based on the King Arthur Legends and his Round Table. 19 This group ties into the Pierre de Sion whose key facet is the Holy Grail and its legends which they are the caretakers of. Rhodes and Lord Rothschild in 1891 formed a \"Circle of Initia tes\" known as the Round Table. 20 The key to Rhodes' spiritual ph ilosophy are Plato and Aristotle. 21 Rhodes' mentor, John Ruskin, was heavily into Plato and Plato's idea of an \"ideal state\" under a single world rulership. 22 The Rhodes Scholarship was de signed to bring together sc holars, and it was viewed that they would learn the ruling class conc epts of Rhodes' One-World-State vision. Rhodes and his friends are resp onsible for the Royal Institut e of International Affairs, which expanded internationally and is know n in the U.S. as t he Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). 23 Rhodes amalgamated the diam ond mines in the Kimberley area of southern Africa under the Jewish corporation, the De Beers Consolidated Mines in 1888. 24 The Jewish De Beers have a monopo ly on essentially the world's diamond market. 25 Diamonds are mined in places like South Africa and cut in Amsterdam. Rhodes \"was disclosed as instigator of attack upon govern ment of a friendly nation; fo rced to resign premiership (1896).\" 26 Rhodes was involved in various political intriques, because he wanted the British to control South Africa for the fabulo us financial benefits it would provide. When"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"he died 6 million pounds were left which endowed 170 schola rships for youth from the British Empire and the U.S. to go to Oxford. 27 German students have been included off and on also. 28 THE LEADERSHIP PASSES TO OTHERS Fred Franz played a big role as the \"oracl e\" of the Society. It was Governing Body member Karl F. Klein that perhaps first refe red to Fred Franz as the WT's \"oracle.\" But he became a figure head to conceal that t he real directing influence of the WT Society was outside of the Society. A big 6'2\" Jewish man has gone everywhere with Fred Franz as his guide these last few decades. This man, Natheer Salih, was needed because Fred became blind. However, for ma ny years people at Bethel found that Salih was more like a bodyguard. Indeed, he was more than a bodyguard, for any communication to Franz has been going through Salih, w ho then returns with the \"answer\" from Franz. This Jewish man with obvious rich tastes, big expensive rings and watches, has become the President's mouthpiece, and in effect a de cision-maker although he isn't part of the Governing Body. 29 Salih was in a positio n to protect against an old man saying the wrong thing. THE TRIUMVIRATE How has the leadership of the WT Societ y been determined? Appar ently the guidance of the Society is by a power outside of the Society and this is secret. However, even those men who carry the titles of leadership are cloaked by the Society in the deepest secrecy. During a tour of th e Brooklyn Headquarters, while associated with the Society, this Author found his questions concerning su ch items as the writing staff were given \"answers\" that avoided giving information. Various stories exist about Rutherford's death. It is said that Rutherford, an alcoholic, while drunk, fell down some stairs at his California mansion. 30 The official story in the WT publication Let Your Name Be Sanctified (1 961), pp. 335-336 describes Rutherford on his deathbed passing the mantle of authority like the prophet E lijah did to Elisha. The WT publication describes the mantle of Elijah falling to a composite three-man Elisah. According to Ray Franz, ex-G overning Body member, Ruther ford told these three men to carry on after his death an d to \"stick together\" as a team. These three men were Nathan Knorr, Fred Franz, and Hayden Coveinton. 31 Ray Franz has gotten of course his information on what happened from others, thes e others having a vested interest in what story would be told. Ray Franz trusting hi s WT brothers bought their story about Rutherford. The WT leaders main tained that Rutherfo rd only left an or al will. A lawyer and author left only an oral will when he knew he was in ill health for some time?? Sure. What is reliably clear though is that these three men took over the rulership of the Jehovah's Witnesses, but when their group dissolved, the mantle was transferred to certain other men on the Governing Body who were also recepients for the One-World- State's directives. Hayden Cooper Covington is also an interesting WT le ader. He took the stand during the Douglas Walsh Trial in Scotland. Coving ton was a Jewish lawy er who earned his law degree at San Antonio School of Law in San Antonio, Tx. He began passing out Watchtower literature in 1934, 32 and was baptized in 1935. 33 He succeeded Judge Rutherford as the Jehovah's Witnesses' lega l counsel in 1942. He won many cases for"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"the Jehovah's Witnesses, sometimes with the help of the ACLU. He also took on clients like heavy-weight boxer Muham med Ali. He personally argued 41 major cases before the U.S. Supreme court for Jehovah's Witnesses. 34 Interestingly, Hayden becam e part of the Governing Body and was made Vice- President of the Watchtower Society from Jan. 13, 1942 until Sept. 24, 1945 without being part of the annointed class. According to WT Theology the JWs are divide d into two major classes, the annointed and the great crowd. 35 Supposedly the recruiting by God for the annoi nted class was completed by God in the early 1930s, but occasionaly when one of the annointed apostasize, they are replaced to keep t he magic number of 144,000. The annointed are to be the governing ones. It may have been this blat ant conflict with this official doctrine that caused Hayden Cooper Covington to step down from his positions. That is what the Nov. 1, 1955 WX p. 650 indicates. NATHAN KNORR Nathan Knorr took over the WT Presidency soon after Rut herford died. He was born in Bethlehem, PA. Apparently he had been baptized as a baby into the reformed church, although he possibly was of Je wish heritage. When he join ed the International Bible Students at age 16, he had his nam e removed from their rolls. 36 He graduated from Allentown, PA. Nathan served the Society as an administrator and was not important in terms of their doctrinal gymnastics. He wa s important in seeing their plans put into action. However, statements made by a relat ive of Knorr's indicate that Knorr was aware of how the Watchtower Society is part of a world-wide conspiracy. 37 Some of the other Governing Body members who may possibly be of Jewish extract may include Albert D. Schroeder, Karl F. Klein, and William Jackson. 38 The Cult of the Double-Sexed God Jehovah The WT magazine was forced to admit to some degree that problems of morality reached to the very top of the Watcht ower Society, including homosexuality. 39 The leaders of the WT Society belong to a group called the Governing Body. Even the names of this Governing Body are kept secret. For instance, when this Author called headquarter to try and get any informatio n at all about the Governing Body the spokesperson at Headquarters refused to reveal anything, not even how many men served on the Governing Body. 40 The following paragraph may offend some readers, however it is not included to embarrass any individual but to develop a point about the occult connections of the WT Society. A number of men on the Governing Body have been bachelors all their life, and are believed by people who worked at headquarters to have been homosexuals. 41 Leo K. Greenlees was forced to resign when hi s homosexuality became public. He then moved to New Orleans. Governing Body member Ewart C. Chitty, was in the middle of a sexual act with a sevent een year old male Bethelite when some unexpected guests arrived and opened the do or. The boy committed suicide. An unconfirmed report says that Chitty was forced to resign later. Ex-Bet helites also report st range behavior by the \"oracle\" of the Society—the principle light of the Society on religious matters, the"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"President Frederick Franz. It used to transp ire that all the youn g boys would sit at Frederick's table, and that at other times he would disc uss scriptures with them in the nude. That's passed, Fr ederick is now 97 years old. Othe r examples have been reported. Anyway, these specific examples are mentione d only to give some credence to the next discussion. There may be a definite occu lt link between the homosexu al activity of the WT leaders and witchcraft. It turns out that \"Homosexual rites, which were most foreign to later religionists, and disturbing to Christian id eas, were associated most strongly with all that the Christian religion ha ted, notably occult powers.\" 42 For instance,\" In the Congo it was not unusual for a priest to dress as a wome n and be affectionate ly spoken of as 'the Grand Mother'. 43 \" Further, \"It is possible to link homosexuality with religion and magical practices all through the world.\" 44 Several items might lead one to the conc lusion that the homosexuality of the WT leadership is rela ted to the occult. 1. Their relationship with th e channeler Johannes Greber who lived in NY (later NJ) indicates a. that the leadership has occult connections and b. that they are willing to cover and lie about any occult connections. 2. Their belief going back to C. T. Russell that the perfect st ate of man is to have the sexual organs of both sexes. This androgenous belief goes back to Baal, to Mithras, Aphrodite, and the Hindu's Siva who are all de picted as double-sexed in some of their statues. It also relates to the Jewish Midras h. Rabbi Samuel-bar-Nac hman (third century) says, \"Adam when God create d him was a man-woman andro gune.\" Maimonides, a later Jewish scholar also believed this. The sing ular account of the creation of Brahm and Adam led various Jewish scholars to suggest that Jehovah, like Baal and the Syrian gods, was double-sexed. 45 The two words that make up t he word Jehovah were composed with the male-female idea. 46 The Hebrew letter Hod (or J) was the virile organ, and Hovah was Eve, the mother of all living things, the procreat or. This interp retation of Jehovah as bi-sexual has been preserved by the Cabbala and t he mysteries of the Masons. At first it may seem like ju mping somewhat to connect a belief in an androgenous God to homosexuality, but after studying the lives of several homosexual religious leaders/witches that's exactly the connection they themselves make . For instance, Manly P. Hall, the great Masonic philosopher was homosexual. He makes this connection between it all, \"These holy persons seldom took part in war, and frequently were distinguished by a costum e combining elements of male and female attire. This practice has been common throughout the religious world and has infl uenced the dress of pagan priests and Christian clergy alike. The and rogynous human being, in whom there is a spiritual union of male and fe male attributes, has been wide ly accepted as personifying a superior type capable of a greater unde rstanding of the Father-wisdom and Mother- love potencies of Divinity. Su ch symbolism existed in all the great Esoteric Orders of the past.\" 47 This leading 33rd degree Ma son Manly P. Hall reports, \"Philosophically, Adam may be regarded as representative of the full sp iritual nature of ma n—androgynous and not subject to decay.\" 48 He suggests that Elohim may have been androgynou s. From these it can be seen that Hall believes homose xuals are on a higher spiritual level. 3. Wicca, black witchcraft believes that Jesus is a gr eat teacher, but not God. 49 "},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"4. The use of the word Jehovah by Caballi sts and Masons has meant a double-sexed God. This Author in researching the Occult not iced that there was a connection between homosexuality and the New Age. For inst ance, upon entering a New Age store called the Third Eye (see the chapter on the Mark of the Beast), he found that free Homosexual literature was being given out. The whole idea of such connections seem bizarre to those of us who have had little to do with the occult or homosexuality. Yet, in trying to understand others, say for instance, Catholic nuns who openly flaunt thei r lesbianism, and who are also into the New Age, the possibility that witc hcraft and homosexuality play a role with each other may be a worthwhile explanation. As one climbs the ladder of the Watchtower Society's hierarchy he becomes more immune to any censor of immoral behavior. \"Wit nesses are resentful of the fact that it seems that Elders commit 'the same wrong ov er and over, and littl e is done—and yet if a publisher is caught sinning once, he or she is disfellowshipped almost on the spot!\" 50 This Author has witnessed that double-stan dard. This is one more reason why it is possible that widespread homosexuality ma y have been pract iced so long at Headquarters. MECHANICS OF THE GOVERNING BODY The Governing Body holds meetin gs at least weekly to di scuss appointments, business, and recommendations by branch personnel. 51 The Governing Body in 1971 began a rotation annually by alphabetic al order of the offices. 52 A WT spokesperson told the Brooklyn Heights paper that the Society no w had 2 Vice-presidents, George Couch and a Pearson. The WT Society has made the Gov erning Body so mysteriously powerful that just the rubber stamp of their signat ure is enough authori zation for anything. NOTES 1.

It has established itself worldwide. Americans are familiar with the door to door Jehovah's Witnesses. They are less familiar with the Watchtower Organization. The Watchtower So ciety was actually esta blished by a Knights Templar Mason Charles T. Russell to destroy, and to change the Christian churches. In the process, an organization worth over a billion dollars has come into being, led by a secret group of men called the Governing Body. Out of the public's view, and even little known to Jehovah's Witnesses these men direct the details of the lives of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The Governing Body has so much control that they have convinced JWs that the Watchtower Society nev er prophecied that 1975 would be the end of the world and Armag geddon. The Watchtower Society's financial operations are totally secret. Some rumors have circulated that the WT Society is one funnel for money laundering. JWs would never believe that their Society and their Governing Body could ever do such a thin g. Indeed the Governing Body has almost a godlike image with the rank and file Jehovah's Witn esses, which they have promoted through their slick propoganda. Few today can escape the proselyt izing efforts of the Jehovah's Witnesses. But few understand the o rganization that they are coming up against. The organizat ion has frequently af fected families, and the careers of tens of thousands of people caught up by its slick propoganda. Much of what the Watchtower S ociety writes abou t itself is fantasy. I have not attempted in this chapter to write an encyclopedia of the org anization and its peop le, but to describe some of its personalities, policies, and political pull in order to reveal some of the myths about the Watchtower Society. PESONALITIES General William P. Hall of the U .S. army and General Alexander P. Stewart were early supporters of Charles T. Russell. Although JWs are typically thought of as anti-military such w as not the case in the early WT Society. Some early IBS were members of the military for years after joining the society. 1 General Hall was a West Pointer and a decorated sharpshooter. His family had associations with the Masons. Gene ral Hall was on the IBSA Committee of which Russell was the Chairman. General Hall was chosen to accompany C.T. Russell on his world-wide tour. 2 Fred H. Robison was one of the seven WT leaders sentenced in June 1918 for violating the espionage ac t. A NY District Court sentenced"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"him to many years of imprisonment, but he was released after only a short time in prison. Papers were introduced at the trial \"showing their connection with German agents in the United States of America and Mexico.\" 3 At his sedition t rial, Robison disclosed that his religious experience before joining the WT Society consisted entirely of several years service for the Christian Endeavor groups. He was no t a member of any ch urch prior to joining the International Bible Students. The Christian Endeavor groups were known to have departed from the Christian faith. 4 The President of the Ch ristian Endeavor Society of America (and Sec. of the World Chapter) was Dr. Stanley B. Vandersall, who was a high ranking and active Freemason. 5 William E. Van Amburgh was treasu rer of the WT Society. Some of the older International Bible Students didn't trust him. If one considers what the Society was teaching is it any surprise? In court during the Sediti on trial in 1918, he to ld the court that the Millenium of God had started in October, 1874. 6 Van Amburgh was one of the sus pected ringleaders by those who suspected foul play in the death of C.T. Russell. Before joining the WT Society, Van Amburgh had been active in the YMCA, and the Methodist church. He served on the editorial staff of the Watch Tower, along with the Jew R.H. Hirsh, Robison, and Rutherford. 7 POLICIES The WT Society has pushed their people hard to get out in field service, that is the door to door sales work. In order to squeeze more time out of their people the Society ordered the JWs not to have children. This was done in WT 11/1/1938 pp.323-324; in the Children book 1941, and could be seen in the Awake! magazine of 11/8/1974 p. 11. About Christians the WT Society said, \"Do not confuse Christianity with the so-called \"Ch ristian religion\". The latter operates in the name of God and Christ but is wholly against Christ and his kingdom, which is the only hope of th e human race. Religion labeled \"the Christian religion\" is a racket invented by the Devil to defame the name of Almighty God. \"--Enemies, p. 146. About democracy the Society says, \"Democracy is the perverted form of the third form of government. . .God's Ho ly Word says nothing about democracy...God is no t the Author of any other ocracy than theocracy.\" The origin of democracy is demons. --The New World, pp. 69-70 Dr. L.W. Jones (of Jewish heritage) gave an address in a lodge building to the IBSA in 1911, \"I was much impressed on looking around to see all of thes e beautiful mottoes. All of them seem to speak of the one word, \"Loyalty,\" which we have on our badge...friends, the key... is \"obedience.\" And surely, now is the time we must be loyal, and we will not be loyal if we are not"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"obedient. \"--Convention Report for Convention at Seattle, Wash. July 2-3, 1911. POLITICAL PULL One ex-JW mother found out that the JWs had obtained the political pull of the Governor of her state, which Governor is heavily into the New Age movement, to win custody of her child. 8 When a JW was arrested for peddling magazines without a license in Tucson, AR. The JW, Hal was foun d guilty of violating the city's ordinance No. 729 'Peddling Without a License'. The case was appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court. The next day, Judge Cella, who had sentenced him, had a mys terious fire that destroyed his whole office, and Hal was released. 9 ACTIONS During the Prohibition days, the WT Presi dent had fine Scotch whiskey smuggled into the U.S. from Canada by the Branch Overseer. 10 In 1938, Rutherford tried to enlist the support of various civic agencies to support the Watchtower Society and its upcoming Seattle Convention. 11 During Rutherford's presi dency, the office of an enemy of the Watchtower Society was destroy ed by a special team of Jehovah's Witnesses that broke into the o ffice of Koerber at night and destroyed evidence against the W atchtower Society. 12 So the Watchtower Societ y clearly will break laws, will deal with political power clandes tinely, and operate in a total cloud of secrecy. It has remained rabidly hostile to Christians. The sinister nature of the upper Watchtower leadership has been clouded in the tightest secrecy, while the rank and file willingly submit to their dictatorship. NOTES 1.

It is quite extraordinary to suggest that Jehovah's witnesses would fight during Armageddon, especially since they have buil t up such a public reputation for being conscientious objectors. This author is quite conscious that wild ac cusations or overstatements could damage the credibility of this book. He is including the suggestion that the Jehova h's Witnesses may be ordered to take more than a passive role due to careful consideration. This Author doesn't know what the future holds. He does suggest it is na ive to think that the WT Society poses no potential threat. Several points can be establ ished beyond doubt. These are: 1 The Jehovah's Witnes ses are not conscientious objector s in the classic sense. They have adamently declared that themselves. Th eir reasons for not participating in war are not from being conscientious objectors. 1 2. Jehovah's Witnesses ar e instructed by their leaders to physically defend themselves (Awake! Sept.8,197 5,pp27,28) and other JWs (W T June 1,1968, p.367) and that there is no bloodguilt in a death blow to an attacker (Awake! Sept.8,'75). Over the entire history of the Watcht ower movement there are nu merous cases when the JWs have felt the need to physically attack and seriously injure those they consider to be threatening. 2 One JW attack in N.Y.C. left do zens of people hospitalized. 3 3. The WT Society is anticipating a military attack upon themselves during Armageddon. 4 4. The WT Society's literatur e does make statements that do include the JWs in the fighting at Armageddon. These statements are on the record, in spite of other WT statements to the contrary. 5 5. There are numerous case histories from Africa, where WT conv erts after reading WT literature, have got the mi staken impression God wanted them to kill. So they have gone out and killed. The WT argues that their message has been misunderstood. That may be so, but the point remains that it is at best difficult to clearly understand WT intentions. The WT Society has played a big role in destroying the colonial governments in Africa, and then in limiting the success of African leaders to try to create nations out of borders left over from colonial rule."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"This Author fully recognizes that the WTB&TS has urged their people to be politically neutral, and to stay aloof from politics. But such neutrality has in some cases in re ality translated into political sabotage. When black African leaders try to create nati onal identities and build national concensus from odd ball groups of people and bounderies that are me aningless to Africa, and then the JWs block their efforts, and by intense proselytizement encourage others to block their efforts, then it is understandable that Af rican national leaders have often viewed the JWs as a thorn in their side. And while the JW literature has played a big role in pr omoting riots, murders, strikes, and other tensions, t he WT Society simply ignores t heir responsibilit y by claiming that they are not responsible for people misunderstanding their literature. In other words, an event (e ffect) is caused by a certai n particular cause. Just because the WT did not want the effect that is caused, they feel they are relieved of any responsibility for the effe ct that they caused. In Zaire, the Society was held resp onsible for the 1961 Luba rebellion. 6 In Southern Rhodesia, especially at Wank ie in 1923, \"the Watchtower became a kind of surrogate union move ment... and was a major elemen t in one of the earliest strikes in the country.\" 7 In the eastern province of what was Rhodesia\"... protes ts led by the Watch Tower preachers brought a quick crack-down from the colonial authorities.\" 8 A Watch Tower self procla imed prophet Tomo Nyiren da and his associates murdered 174 people before Ny irenda was captured and execut ed by the British colonial government. 9 \"... the Watch Tower was a worker's move ment. The revolutionary tenor of its teachings helped pave the way for the first modern labour protests on the Northern Rhodesian Copperbelt, the 'rolling strikes' of 1935.\" 10 If my literature incites people to kill and ri ot, am I guilt free? The WT Society has never expressed (to this Author's knowledge) remorse for those who became victims of overzealous WT readers. The So ciety's reaction is to stress that these tragedies are not their fault. In Africa when a political par ty loses and is outlawed, t heir leaders at times seek refuge by joining the JWs. Al though the JWs are in their ow n eyes neutral, by providing a haven for dissidents, and by proselytizing for the hearts of the pe ople in competition with ruling political parties, they appear in practice to be a political threat."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"If the WT Society's message were not so an ti-state, it would be different. But the Witnesses are taught that thei r governments represent Satan, and that allegience should go solely to the WT Society in N.Y.C. Is the WT Society merely a religious faith, or is it a government as it so often has called itself? It may be the \" perfect scam; call one's government a non-political religion -and then who can dare oppose you? But the Witnesses know who rules them. They are told the WT Society is the voice of God (WT 6/15/57, p.370) They are told that rejecting the WT Society is rejecting God. (WT 2/15/76 p.124) They are told the WT Society is their mother.( ) They are told that the God's sole visible channel is the WT Society and they must be submissive to it. (WT ) They are told to avoid independent thinking, and not to question the WT Society. (WT Jan. 15,1983, pp.26-27) The WT Society is not just any government, it is a very autocratic dictatorial one, but they believe it is the only legitimate government, all others are Satanic.

The coincidence is not coincidence. Hitler founded his Nazi religion on Hind i (New Age) beliefs. This author has repeatedly during the course of his research come across New Agers referring to Hitler as one of them. The Watchtower Society adveritises themselves as Christians. They don't now directly identify themselves with the New Age Movement. The Watchlower Society doe s a good job of portraying their Millenium as a wonderf ul paradise. Hitler also promised his people a 1,000 year reign. The Society anticipates a special race in the New Order. This New Age race is to be esp ecially righteous and spiritual. Allow the Author to digress. There is a certain disquieting flaw in the WT's history that perhaps when taken with some modem recent WT statements produces an uneasiness. Permit the Author to dig up the WT's unrepented and covered up racist past. It indicates an inability of the Society to admit faults. Who is going to keep the Society honest in the New Age if they have been able to hide their racism during this century? At one time the Society was simply racist. Consider the following Watchlower Society messages, which arc but a sampling. \"The negro race is supposed to be descended from Ham, whose special degradation is mentioned in Gen. 9:22,25\" WT 8/1/1898 A black man whose skin was turning while was hailed in the WT 10/ 1/1900 as proof that the New Age was about here. The WT 7/15/02 declares Caucasions are more intelligent than others. Russell's Studies in the Scriptures. Vol.6,p.490 advises to keep the races segregated as New Creatures. On and on the articles went like this. Reformers, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. was to become, were branded satanic. WT 2/ 1/52 \"It is generally believed that the curse which Noah pronounced upon Canaan was the origin of the Black race.\" The Golden Age 7/24/29 Even up to recent times segregation was practiced. While others were fighting discrimination; the Witnesses were practicing discrimination, yet fighting for the right not to sa lute the flag and going to jail for it. Their priorities are disquieting. The Society has never admitted to t h e i r racism, or repented of it. In all due fairness, the rank and file JWs are in these times very commendable in their acceptance of racial differences. However, the Governing Body continues to make decisions that reflect a racial bias. Raymond Franz gives an example of that in thei r decision not to translate the AID Bible encyclopedia into Spanish, because supposedly the Spanish speaking JWs wouldn't use it. The Society promotes the idea that in the Millenium there will be brotherhood. That is an interesting concept, because it implies tolerence, and acceptance, and love. For now, let's accept the WT's word that it believes in brotherhood, and that in their Golden Age to come there will be this love, and acceptance, and tolerance. Bear in mind, the WT Society has consistently said that all men resurrected into the New Order will have their same personalities as before. Most of the resurrected will be all the wicked people throughout history that lived be fore the JWs began seperating the sheep from the goats. Likewise, those that survive the revolution, the battle of Arma geddon will also have only the same personality as they always had. From this is to come a special race. The Watchlower Society has be en brutally frank in their literature about what life will rea lly be like under their rule in the New Age. However, because these items are slipped into articles along with nice garden-like paradise pictures with people s m i l i n g and a lot of verb age, few people, if anyone, have really stopped to assimilate the whole picture and digest what they arc really saying. It's interesting that the Communists and the Nazi have always spelled out publically to their people what was "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"THE WT's \"MEIN KAMPF\" intended. There seems to be several reasons for this according to political scientists. They have done that while simultaneously painting a rosy picture to other countries. Equally interesting is how mo st foreignors have tended to prefer to ignore clear statements of evil intentions. In spite of repeated warning by Germans who were scared of Hitler's intentions, the Allies gave him Czechoslovakia. A phenomena for social scientists to study. Hitler spelled out what he w ould do in Mein Kampf, but most people choose to ignore it . The WT Society has also prepared its people, while at the same time keeping the illusion going that paradise will be wonderful. Hitler had the Hitler Youth sold on his wonderful predictions for the future. The Society has also maintained an illusion of pacifism which when juxtaposilioned against numerous statements to the contrary when dealing with the last battle, ought to at least raise some eyebrows. This author would never want to live in the New Age 1984 Orwcllian world that the Wa tchtower Society describes in their own literature. This Author has taken a few quotes from older WT material in the following report—but in general most is fairly recent. However, the older materi al is relevant along with the new in that it hasn't ever been denied, or changed, and today's Governing Body was around when it was published, and finally modern WT liter ature tells the same story. THE WATCHTOWER'S MEIN KAMPF The actual quotes documenting each of the following will follow this summary. According the Watchtower Society the future New Age has this waiting for us. l. A new mark on the forehead will be required to survive the revolution.(more on what this is about later) 2.

The genocide of all Christians 10. and those without the mark begins. 11. A time of slaughter and pain equal to all the bloodshed in history begins. 12. The Society doesn't give advice to Jehovah's Witnesses on where to hide, or protect themselves. 13. The JWs are to treat this as a time of great joy. 14. Tears are not allowed for any victims. 15. The WT Society survives Armageddon to lead the New Age Society. 16 The Society is God's government now and in the Millenium 17.They are training their loyal peopl e right now to govern during the Millenium. 18. Does the sla ughter end with the initial genocide?- no, executions continue during the whole New Age period 19. People in the New Age are afraid 20.The WT Society will serve as judges. 21. Their secret police force will have absolute control and even control over the minds. 22. Instant punishment will be handed out 22. Ambitious people will be killed or brainwashed 23.

Christ who is Satan's brother will rule invisibly but will never show himself. 47. God will never communicate with the world 48. But his occultic po wer will be used in the Millenium. 49 People will still be the same people as they are today 50. but they will not be taught anything of Christ's redemption, 51. but they will be perfected through training, the Laws, and executions. 52. But what is really wild is that the JW s have all these visions of the New Order being a lazy garden paradise, while the WT Society say that they will spend the first seven months burying dead bodies. Pass out the gas masks! That certainly is one picture one doesn't get from all their colored pictures, but it is wh at they warn JWs it will be like in the New Order. 53. People will ha ve to wait to see anyone resurrected, because it will take some time before things are ready for any one to be resurrected. 1. A new mark on the forehead will be required to survive the revolution. One of the WT Societ y's methods is to hint at something in their literature in a vague fash ion and then la ter come along and reinterpret it in a more precise manner or even in an unexpected manner. When they teach that a mark on the forehead is absolu tely needed they are laying the ground work for their people to accep t the New Age Mark of the Beast. On the one hand the Society says the mark is symbolic. But then it says that a persons doesn't automatically acquir e the mark simply because he has done all the right things. The mark is symbolic alright. But this author suggests it's symbolic of a sinister empire. Somehow the JW is to receiv e this, but it isn't acquire by just doing all the right things. An allusion to \"standing in line\" is made in the United in Worship book. 2.A fight between \"God's Kingdom\" and those now in power breaks out. How will there be a war be tween God's kingdom and the world? \"Such wars during the centuries prior to 1914 were mere wars against human na tions, human gov ernments; but the wars that the nations, including thos e of Christendom, were to fight at the consuma tion of the system of things were to be against God's kingdom and its King Jesus Christ, on the issue of worl d domination.\"A New Heavens and A New Earth. 1953,p.246. Note the fight is between more than just Christ bu t with \"God's kingdom.\" 3. precipitated by an attack on the WT Society. The final assault on the New World Society will provoke the final battle. A New Heavens & A Ne w Earth. 1953,p.32 This will be a military attack on the Jehovah's Witnesses KJ,1971,p.360 4.God's forces and the world's clash. What alliance makes up God's Kingdom forces at Armageddon? \"At Armageddon the nations a nd demon powers invisibly behind them will meet up with the Invincibles, 'kings from the rising of the sun\", name ly Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ.\" A New Heav ens and A New Earth, p.290, para. 7 5.The heavenly Zion is actuall y in part the WT Society. We read much about a heavenly Zion in WT material. Who is God's woman, the heavenly Zion? \"The creating of the new heav ens at the Kingdom's birth A.D. 1914 was not accompanied by the creating of the promised new earth, for Jehova h's witnesses on earth were desolated during the world war that then began. According to the appearance of them by 1918 God's woman, the heavenly Zion, thei r mother, was desolate and a rag- covered captive in the dust at Babylon's feet....In 1919 Jehovah...rescued the remain ing ones.\" A New Heavens & A New Earth, p.322 The \"heavenly Zion\" in this pass age is definitively linked to the WT Society leaders here on earth. The \"heavenly Zion\", "},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"God's woman was captive on earth. It must be then the WT Society that is being referred to or in the least the ____________ THE WTs \"MEIN KAMPF\" WT Society and the dead members of the elect that must make up part of the \"heavenly Zion.\" \"On earth today the New Worl d society is the only group that is doing true constructive work.\" Ibid, 328. You mean the WT Society plan s to keep on governing after the revolution? \"The surv ivors of Almighty God's victorious war will step out as pioneers into the new earth. Although spread all over the ear th according to their pre- Armageddon location, they will promptly operate together as a new-world society in harmony with the theocratic organization already established among them.\" Ibid. 343- 344. This sounds like a subtle hint, \"promptly report for orders, so that you can work in harmony.\" \"The new heaven is the government of Messiah, The Theocracry, born and in power.\" WT June 1,1943 Who will rule the New Order? The WT Society. \"The NEw World Society on earth really started with the remnant when restored from Babylon in 1919...the new earth can rightly be said to have been founded in this remnant, for the New World society continues on fo r eternity on earth.\" A New Heavens & A New Earth, p.338 6.The Watchtower Society is God's government and speaks for him. 7. The JWs fight in the revolution. Who fights? To protect themselves the Society writes, \"Jehovah's woman in heaven brought forth her male child, her theocratic Messianic gove rnment....Therefore, let all earthly, man-made governments be put on notice that God's kingdom is not established by any seditious, revolutionary movement of Jehovah's witnesses on earth.\" A New Heavens and A New Earth, p.222 And yet three pages further Rutherford's oft-quoted 1922 Cedar Point Speech is given which instructs JWs \"Be faithful and true witnesses for the Lord. Go forward in th e fight until every vestige of Babylon lies desolate.\" See also Babylon the Great! p.464 The only sense that reconciles both these statements is that the true legitimate King has been born, and that his claim to"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"THE WATCHTOWER & THE MASONS the throne can't be taken away. But that meanwhile his foot soldiers will be out destroying Christendom until every vestige of Christendom is destroyed.

The WT Society is compared to when Jehu went to slaughter Baal-w orshippers. (Children. 1941,p.201) At the St. Louis assembly the Pioneers were greeted, \"Well, it should refr esh anyone's heart to greet a company of real fighters, that are not only willing to fight, but to fight for the greatest thing that has ever been known or ever will be known, namely, the great Theocratic Government. \" (Report of the J.W. Assembly, St. Louis. 1941,  WTB&TS,  p.43)  8.other revolutionary gro ups fight at Armageddon. One of the best examples of this are the WT quotes which declare that Armageddon will be like the French Revolution. Occultic Masonic groups are known to have created the French Revolution. The Society tells us under the title: French Revolution. A Foregleam of Things To Come. \"From autumn 1793, the revolutionary government set up a vast plan for dechristianization. The aim was to build a \"new man\" who would be rid of vice. The Catholic religion was accused of trying to take advantage of the people's credulity. Some chur ches were destroyed, while others were turned into barracks. The clergy were forced to quit their vocation...Those who refused were arrested and executed.\" \"The French Revolution sowed ideas that later grew into both democracies and dictatorsh ips. It also showed what can happen when political powers suddenly turn against organized religion. In this, it may provide a foregleam of things to come.—Revelati on 17:16; 18:1-24\" (Awake! 12/22/1989, p.28) Docs this mean the JWs receive help from others? There is no mixing of good and evil forces according to The 1952 Yearbook. Mon. June 16.

(KJ, 1971, p.367) The fighting is summed up in that God will \"dash them all to pieces at the final war of Armageddon.\" (1949 Yearbook, Sept.3) and \"Christ will strike the enemy with confusion and the various el ements of Satan's visible organization will fight and anni hilate one another.\" (This Means Everlasting Life. 1950, p.263) 9.The genocide of all Christians begins. \"The so-called 'Christendom', with its dem on religion, is in the most reprehensible position of a l l because 'Christendom's' leaders have fraudulently and blasphemously posed as the "},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"representatives of Almi ghty God...\"(Religion. 1940,p.79) \"They call themselves shepherds of the flock...The Christian Clergy...That they will die in Armageddon is certain...they will demonstrate that they belong to Satan and are unworthy of life...\"(Light , p.215) \"Christendom will be completely blotted out.\"(1943 Yearbook.

Now the greatest issue of all ages will be settled by the most tremendous battle ever fought, and there will never be another.

No. Everyone who supports th e world as it is now, and who will not submit to a Big Brother-1984 type government of this New Order will be eliminated. Under the caption \"Beneficia l Results\" in the WT book True Peace and Security, p. 43 note the question, \"What will result from the destruction of the present world system and its supporters? The text th en relates that wonderful things will come from the annihilation of anyone committed to the present system.

The idea that some people are good and others are bad is not scriptural. God loves all people. The idea that the earth can be cleansed by eliminating bad people smacks of Nazism and New Age threats to eliminate Christians.) 12.Quest. 30 \"Would it be wise to try to hide during the great time of trouble, and wouldn't it be safer in the country than in the city?\" (The cryptic reply-) \"I advise you to hide before the time of trouble.\"(11th Souvenir Report, Con- Reports, p.20) Although the WT Society has stated it expects many terrible things to happen, they seem to have taken no precautions to elliviate the pain that is to come. The same thing happened in Nazi Germany. The JWs were told simply, \"Jehovah will protect you.\" This attitude is reflected in the following quote, \"Those who maintain their integrity toward God and who remain true and faithful to the Theocratic Government will receive protection and salvation from the disast ers of Armageddon.\" (1940 Yearbook, p.215) 13. The JWs are to treat Armageddon as a great time of joy. \"a great slaughter...This grea t carnage at Armageddon...it will...be to those who delight themselves in Jehovah...joy to their hearts and will give them strength to go onward in their work and service which God may yet have for them to do on earth.\" (1931 Yearbook. Dec.25) \"...Allow your mind to dwell upon God's righteous new world. Cultivate a strong desire for it. Keep a clear-cut vision of it before you all the time. Meditate upon it. Picture yourself walking in the midst of its paradisaic beauty. Feel its peace and tranquility. See yourself looking at the ruins of one of the old-world cities and at happy members of the New World Society busily clearing away those ruins.\" WT July 1, '57 (This sounds to this Author like a New Age visualization.) 14. Tears are not allowed for any victimes. \"The present mourning of the people world-wi de speaks out plainly its own meaning, but now such mourning will not much longer continue.

There will be only ONE GOVERNMENT, indivisible, world-wide, only one central authority...All humankind under them shall be subject to them as unto the King whom they visibly represent:...\" What is this government? It is in Brooklyn, NY known as the Watchtower's Governing Body. A very secretive group-so secretive th e WT refused to tell this author anything about it, not ev en how many are on it. This Author didn't need their help to learn this. Anyway this group is slated to lead. On page 133 of the recent publication You Can Live Forever On Planet Earth, a picture is shown of two JWs going door-to-door, the caption reads, \"Subjects of God's government must tell others about it.\" Another t i p o ff that they plan to rule, is that according to their theo logy, the heavens were cleansed of evil in 1914, yet today God's government rules \"In the Midst of Enemies\" (You Can Live Forever On Planet Earth, pp. 136-142) God's government must today be on earth, because Christ is safe in heaven, and is not in the midst of enemies. 17.\"God has been selecting, pr eparing and training the new government of those who will live on earth in the new system.\" (The Truth that lead s to Eternal Life, p. 73) The WT School of Gilead is training administrators of the Kingdom government, \"origina lly designed for training missionaries...Also receiving tr aining on how to teach for the expanded work during the Millenium.\" (1952 Yearbook, p.51-52) 18.After the genocide of Christians, and the executions of all who do not have the mark, the New Order will be in process, will the executions stop? \"The new heavens of Jesus Christ,...and his 'bride,'...will then be in complete control over the earth. So th ere is nothing to hinder such children in attaining to a hundred years of age and eternity. And a man who attains to a hund red years of age need not then die as if he had lived his normal span of life....Hence if anyone then lived a hundred years and was executed for willful disobedience to the \"n ew heavens\" King, he would be dying relatively a mere youth or child in view of the endless eternity he might have lived. If he did die at a hundred years of age, it woul d not be then because of extreme age and decrepitude.\"(A New Heavens and a New Earth, pg 332, para 28) \"If one then dies eith er under or at the age of a hundred years, it will be because of the curse that one may bring upon himself because of steady, willful insubordination to the King.' (Ibid, pg.333, para. 29) Note, Big Brother will execute in the New Order, but very quietly. The option of a long life will be offered a New Age citizen in return for hi s obedience. Indeed the WT Nov.15,38 p. 1 enunciates, \"What will be required of each individual composing that multitude? Obedience. That one word answers the question.

They were expected to be obe dient and not have children. This commandment was characterized in the Report of the Jehovah's Witness Assembly, St. Louis, 1941, p.52, \"The book Children is manna from heaven prepared by the Lord for the people of good will to enable them to see their relationship to Theocracy.\" It wa s said to be proper to wait until after Armageddon to have children.

Has the reader watched a TV show on India, or met with a Guru? Perhaps you've seen how Hinduism, expecially the Hindu teachers mark their foreheads with a red, yellow, or white dot. This is the position of the third eye. Geoffrey Hodson, in The Hidden Wisdom of the Holy Bible, Vol. 1, p. 140 tells his readers that man has now advanced to the point where he is able to use the third e ye lying benea th his forehead. This is why public sc hools are now teaching subjects on the third eye such as \"Math and the Third Eye.\" This third eye is on one of the Chakra s, which are energy points, and initiation si tes that open up outside forces to enter the body. Another Chakra is on the palm of the right hand. These two positions happen by some holy coincide nce to match up with the marks of the beast prophesied in Rev 13:16,17. The information that this Author has learned on this subject is vast. Hopefully, the following will summa rize this subject before the details are given. The Plans of the Satanists who co ntrol the Illum inati are to have every one take a Luciferian initiation. 1 Luciferian intiations have been g iven already for years (actually for centuries). 2 These initiations have already involved using the chakra points of the right palm and the forehead. 3 Satanists may initially only push for an invisible mark, but the ultimate goal is to make the mark a visible mark t hat people will wear as a status symbol that they will be proud of. That will give the Satanists a perverse thrill to look over their slaves who proudly wear their Master's brand, in the same proud manner that a Texas rancher looks over his herd of cattle al l wearing his ranch's brand. 4 The New Age Manual of Initiation entitled The Rays and the Initiations reveals that the mark is to be gi ven to all mankind. It is also clear that the Power intends to inject coded microchips into everyone under the disguise of a nationwide AIDS vaccination. 5 Humane Societies are al ready injecting microchip tags into dogs to prove the vi ability of t he tagging system. 6 The tags will enable computers via Satellites to track and identify every human being. It is very likely th at hand scanners will come into use and people given a manditory bar code on their hands.

That J ehovah's Witnesses are being directed in that direct ion is another indica tion who their masters will ultimately serve. As the JWs have been conditioned to obey without question, it is probable that they will also join in taking the Luciferian Initia tion. The JWs are not esteemed to highly by the Internationalists. For them the JWs are merely the Internationalists' expe ndable shock troop s. They are not too concerned whether the JWs do or don't fall in line for survival. MARKS OF LUCIFER Witches receive a smal l mark called the Devil 's Mark. New Agers are receiving stars on theirs during a Lucif erian initiation. This initiation also gives them a Kun dalini (aka Skak tipat) experience. Their minds are altered by the initiation and their new personality is now Satan-possessed. ASTARA's booklet Finding Your Place in the Golden Age has a picture of a New Age thinker with a star on his forehead. These marks on the forehead's third eye area may vary. The important item is the location. Th e third eye are is an important point to the occult. It is signif icant that the Watchtower Society has been warning people in recent years that t hey need a mark on the forehead to get into the New Order.

Under the chapter \"Identified For Destruction Or Survival\" under the Subsection \"D o You Have The Mark\", th e JWs are instructed, \"It would be a serious mista ke to conclude that if a person tries to lead a 'good' life and if he shuns religions that are doing things clearly condemned in God's Word, noth ing more is required of him.

On the one hand they refer to an ac tual physical mark being neccessary, yet a further page says the mark me ans to put on a new personality. This sounds somewhat like the Skaktipat experience. Whatever the Watchto wer Society means, it is significant that they have spent one chapter and a color ed picture on the theme. Three colored pictures are included in the Survival Into a New Earth book. First is the picture of the person taking a Mark. Second is a picture telling us to be submissive and repent of our own prideful ways. Third is a picture of what h appens if a person thinks of what life used to be, or if a person thinks anywhere that the Society doesn't want them to think, they may share the fate of Lot's wife who turned into a pilla r of salt. The message is that once you are a JW you can not tu rn back and look at the world. You must only look where you are being led. (Read this a mind control, a self-imposed censor ship. Now if you do this your mind in the WT Society's.) It is interesting that the location of the WT's required mark exactly matches the New Age initia tion point required to survive into the New Age. It is not clear why if this is an invisible mark, and only symbolic, why it is so omn inously fussed over so much. The fuss being made is that \"all regardless of bac kground, who hope to survive into the 'new ear th'...must hav e this mark.\" One WT reference alludes to standing in line to receive the mark. The door has been left open f or the WT to do what they have often done before, that is to come back and r einterpret in a different but more precise way what they have hinted at in a vague fashion. This makes it ap pear that they have held the view for a long time. On the one hand the Society says the mark is symbolic, on the other hand they say it is needed. They s ay a person doesn't automatically acquire the mark by doing all the correct things. Who is the man with the inkhorn that gives this mark on the third eye to survive? Originally it was said to be C.T. Russell. 8 Later the man was identified as \"the spiritual remnant or 'faithful and discreet slave' class\" 9 . Alice Bailey indicates that the Luciferian initiation will be done in the churches and Masonic Lodges. ( Externalisation of the Hierarchy, p. 514) and that what she calls externalized Ashrams will be active along the major line of \"The public inauguration of the system of initiation.\" (p. 700) Should the Watchtower Society align itself with the New Order when needed, then it's Kingdom Halls may b ecome part of the system of churches and \"externalized Ashra ms\" that provide the initiation.

ASTARA's booklet Finding Your Place in the Golden Age has a picture of a New Age Thinker with a star on his forehead. The New Age and Hindu teaching of an energy point between one's eyes on the fore head is a precursor of the Mark of the Beast. Marrs finds in his research that various New Agers are already sealing people in the third eye area. An New Age Manual of Initiation entitled The Rays and the Initiations reveals the Mark is to be given to all mankind. It also reveals the marks are related to the third eye and right palm chakras. The pentagram comes up repeatedly in New Age literature as an initiation sign on the forehead. The Mark will be a mark of an advanced thinker.

One April Saturday in 1974 in sunny souther n California, an overconfident Jehovah's Witness met with Bill Cetnar. The Jehovah' s Witness was Duane Magnani and he was sure that he could expose t he lies that Bill had told his brother about the Watchtower Society. Duane was tryi ng hard to get his brother back into the organization. He felt that Bill had to be met and refuted, even though the lo cal elders had trembled and stuttered with fear and warned him not to talk to Cetnar when they lear ned who Duane was to meet. They had told him that to \"follow God's arrangement\" is what was important. One of the things Duane lear ned that day was the lies and false prophecies that the Society has propogated. And l ong story short, Duane did something about the information he learned that day. Duane eventually would r ealize the mind control that the Watchtower Society uses, and so Duane us ed their own literature to show the Society's lies in order to crack that mind control. Hi s campaign to expose their lies motivated him within two years to get the largest collecti on in the world of JW material (outside of the WT Society itself). His book Eyes of Understandin g, (the title based on the WT Society's explanation that one needed eyes of understanding to know God's plan, and they of course were the ones with the correct eyes), exposes their false pr ophecies. Duane went on to write Who is the Faithful and Wise Servant? Called the Who bo ok for short it shows the WT's coverup of their long held view that Russell was the so le Faithful and Wise Servant. Because their present leadership use the parable of the Wise Servant to justify their dictatorship, that the Society held Russell to be that Servant and that Servant died, is devastating to their theology. They have worked har d to coverup the \"creature worship\" they gave to C.T. Russell. The numerous coverups by the WT Society, a nd their dishonesty is so pervasive, that it boggles the mind of the sinc ere historian. But they are su ccessfully carrying out their campaign of false information, why?"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Most people know nothing or little about th e JWs. They have the liberty to investigate before they join, but few know how to and they then rely on WT ma terial. After they join, it is difficult for them to ev er make an honest appraisal of their religion or its history. Outsiders have little interest in the Watchtower movement. Only a small group of people keep watch over the WT Society. This is why the Society is able to buffalo so many people. RUSSELL'S SMOKESCREENS Most of us go through life without questioning why we do the things we do. Why do we wear ties and import granite from Vermont to bury our dead under? However, this Author is one of those who is always asking wh y. And the problem of why Russell was so deceptive many times in his life, and yet was cl early respected as a very honest man, and indeed considered himself to be an honest ma n, was a puzzle. His lies in court to cover his friends would hardly seem to be worth th e trouble. But once this Author saw how the mindset of Russell was so clearly a reflecti on of the views surging through the Masonic Halls of that age, then it at last made sense. Russell was honest as Masons ar e trained to be, that it is not a lie to deceive those not worthy of the truth. Further, like many Masons, he kept hi s membership very quiet. He pays close attention not to let out any clues th at his beliefs are from the Masonic Hall. He always portrays his beliefs as coming from the Bible. A Mason in vented Phrenology, and the Mormons and Russell were big on Phrenology at that time it surged through the Masonic halls. Masons had dabbled in the occult and magic, and both the early Mormon leaders and Russell did healin g with magic handkerchiefs. The pyramidology surged through the lodges, and both t he Mormons and Russell picked it up. But Russe ll is careful to always use the Bible as the \"fall guy\" for his beliefs. He calls his magic handkerchief Paul's handkerchief. He ties his pyramid beliefs back to some scripture which are misused to prove his beliefs. Russell is always playing to an audience. He is very careful to say and do the right things. He is careful not to expose his deep Masonic mindset. But every now and then he slips. He refers to the woman of Luke 15:8 as \"divine en ergy\", but then when questioned about this denies having writte n it, \"The fact that something in the Tower might be misunderstood would not su rprise us any. Why, we fi nd a whole lot in the Bible that has been \"misunderstood. \" (Bible Student's Convention , Indianapolis, 1907, p.26) Russell is also asked if anyone else teaches the invisible presence of Christ. \"Are there any other papers than the Towe r which teach as it does th at Jesus is now present?\" Russell answers, \"We know of none other which teaches the personal presence of Jesus.\"(WTR p546 10/1883) That he can say this is just remarkable . He is fully aware that others such as the Rosicr ucians teach this, besides the Christians have held that he has been invisibly pres ent since his ascension."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"RUTHERFORD Rutherford is the second WT President. He was a lawyer. He was as honest as the common stereotype of lawyers. In other words, he does what it takes to win. By reprinting in 1928 an article that is ne gative about Freemaso nry, he may simply have been putting up a smokescr een, so that Masoni c goals could continue to be carried out. Certainly, that was his modus operandi with the demonic Ouji healing devices that headquarters were using. To st iffle criticism, he allowed so mething negative printed, and then forbade discussion. However, it may be that he wasn't a Freemason. Unlike Russell, this author hasn't any Masoni c records of membership fo r Rutherford, although the rumors persist. The powers that controlled him certainly were not concerned whether he was a Mason or not, but simply t hat their goals could be furthered. That Rutherford could do what he pleased with out the rank and file knowing it is clearly demonstrated. He became an alcoholic, and this and his live-in girlfriend, who even signed his death certificate, managed to be kept secret. During Rutherford's reign, R.H. Barber of Bethel Headquarters throws out a smokescreen with some false clues about the conspiracy to bring in a one-world-government. He points the finger at the Christian clergy. He says the Christian clergy have originated the co nspiracy and are in someway de ceiving the governments into becoming a party of the conspiracy. (The Go lden Age, pp 277-278 , Feb. 3,1932 #323.) Another conspiracy smokescreen appears in the book The Truth Shall Make You Free (1943). It states that Christendom has an \"inter national police force for her continual world domination.\" But Rutherford is carefu l not to tell us the es oteric Masonic sources that have taught him all about the supposed pagan connections to Christian symbols—such things as Phallic worship. Phallic worship is by the way, declared by Albert Pike's Mo rals and Dogma to be the true worship of Masonry. Each Scottish Rite Mason is given Pike's book after the 32nd degree. Again Rutherford, like Russell, is careful not to clue us in on any Masonic connections. Isn't easier to believe that he learned all his mystery religion/ pagan symbolism stuff from masonic sources th an from angels. AFTER RUTHERFORD The WT Society leaders contin ued their secrecy. Covington, even managed to succeed Rutherford as President and run the Societ y for a period without the rank and file Jehovah's Witnesses knowing about it. Nathan Knorr pushed him aside, and apparently that suited the Powers in control of things . Knorr, Covington, and Franz were to work together, but circumstances didn't really work out that way. Covington, not one of the annointed, theologically was a red herring. Yet, the Covington family is a prominant family within the Order, so he ma y have had strong support, at least temporarily."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"At the Scottish Douglas Walsh Trial in 1954, we see Covington lying under oath. Another JW, named Hughes, aske d the same question, gives the truth. What was the question? The question was whether the JWs use other groups buildings for their Kingdom Halls. The practice of using Mas onic Halls and Oddfellows Halls was widespread. Covington was in the best position of anyone to know this. So why did he lie about it? Was this perhaps a sensitive issue? The questions on page 381 of the trial t ranscript had touched on buildings rented for use as Kingdom Halls and what steps were taken to consecrate them. On page 382 of the trial transcript, the ques tioner asks, \"Sometimes the Kingdom Halls are shared with other bodies or secular societies, aren't they? A. I do not know of any such cases where the actual hall itself is. I may say this, that Kingdom Halls of Jehovah's Witnesses are often to be found in commerc ial neighborhoods and in buildings where, say for instance, on the ground floor ther e might be a store.\" However, the truth is that the JWs were using Masonic temples and lodges. In Grand Coulee, WA the Kingdom Hall was located on the bottom floor of the Oddfellows Hail, and while the JWs used the bottom floor, the O ddfellows would at times be conducting meetings above them. This lasted from abo ut 1947 to 1952. Two of the Melbourne Kingdom Halls in Australia w ere Masonic lodges to begin wi th. The Kingdom Hall at 256 Murray Road, Pres Victoria, Austrailia had been a Spiritist church which was converted into a Kingdom Hall. While Covingt on only admits to a dedication of Kingdom Halls occuring, the truth is that this Spiritist church required the Spirits to be exorcised by the Jehovah's Witnesses before they could us e it. Covington was privy to everything, having been the Society head legal guardian and its President and Vice-President. A.F. Hughes, under oath apparently doesn't k now the sensitivity of the issue for when he is asked, several questions about the Kingdom Halls leading up to the question, These Halls are sometimes owne d by the Society? A. They are owned by the local congregation. Q. Or leased by the local congregation? A. Yes. Q. Or shared with others; outside agencies? A. Sometimes, yes, but that w ould only be where there is a small congregation that is not able to meet the costs for the ti me being. They would, of course, have the ultimate in mind that they would have a Kingdom Hall of their own. (Douglas Walsh Trial, p.626-627, 1954). The Society has put out instructions that \"W hether you own or rent your hall, it ought to be ... a proper representation of Jehovah's true worship.\" (Organization for Kingdom Preaching and disciple-making,1972, p.104) Today the Society is still using Masonic Halls for weddings where one of the spouses is not a Jehovah's Witness. Their use of Masonic and Oddfellow Halls for Kingdom Halls raises questions. Either, these places are proper representations of true worship according to the Society, or the Society has been quietly being hypocritical. This Author tends to believe that the JW top leadership is a Mason, so in that case, the close relationship between Kingdom Halls and Masonic Halls is not hypocritical."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"The WT Jan. 15, 1958, p. 46 states \" ... it is really th e holy spirit that leads to the appointing of such overseers; \" The Governing Body have is sued other statements such as this, that lead one to believe that their decisions are made after prayerful consideration. Ray Franz, former Governin g Body member, in his book Crisis of Conscience, pulls the cover off that false picture. One mask though that has never been pulled off, is the Jewishness of Russell's religion. This book does that fo r the first time. In the twenties , it appears that some people began to catch onto the connec tions between the B'nai B'rith and the WT Society. Could this explain why the WT beca me anti-Zionist. Was this to hide their origins and their Jewishness, or was it because Rutherford ha d actually broken with the Society's Jewish backers? It is an intriguing puzzle. The Jew Paul S.L. Johnson, who had forsaken being a nominal Lutheran minister and became a Bible Student, acted like he sincerely believed that he was to be Russell's succes sor. What is interesting is that 4 out of the 7 board of Directors of the WT Society also thought so . In fact, in the 197 5 Yearbook, p.89 it explains that Johnson believed clear back in 1915 before Russell died that the mantle would be passed to him. The British office and the Kingdom Halls in the British South American colony of Guiana (see WT Oct. 1, 83) went under Johnson's leadership. It was only by hard fisted manouevering that Ruth erford gained control. It meant dismissing those men on the Board of Directors, who at the time didn't thin k Rutherford had the power to dismiss them. (The 73 Yearbook, pg.101 also gives details of the British events in this battle for control.) Ruth erford gained control, but then he and his leadership ended up going to prison. Could it be that the Orde r did not want Rutherford in? Did Rutherford have to make a deal with them, or did he simply rea lize from there on that they had power? One of the biggest smokescreens is the appearence the JW make of hating all religions. In reality, they a ttack only one religion in their literature—Christianity. They claim that their lack of work in India is t hat Hinduls are hard to deal with, but a close examination shows they have ma de almost no effort over th e last 150 year s to convert Hindus. The rank and file witness certainly ha s little affection for ot her religions, but his leadership has been careful to direct his hate toward only one group in particular—Christianity (called Christendom). If the New Age Religion were to be capsulized into 7 teachi ngs it could be reduced to the following seven id entifying beliefs. 1. God is impersonal. 2. Christ is not Almighty God, but a good teacher. 3. Jesus is but one of many Christs. 4. Sin and evil do not exist. 5. Man should seek instruct ion from the spirit world. 6. All religious teachings are of merit, except those that are Christian and believe in absolute truth. Therefore the religious view s of Egypt, Babylon, In dia and the Aztecs are held to be of value for us today. 7. Man can be a god."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"8. The Jehovah's Witnesses have made repeated statements over the years that God is not personally involved in events. This is not just an insignificant idea in Watchtower theology—it is necessary because they declare that what is happening in the world is not the will of God. Because they have an incomp lete understanding of the will of God they need to distance him completely from evil wh ich they do not realize he has permitted. 9. The Jehovah's Witnesses are well known for their attacks on the divinity of Christ. If pressed, the JWs will declare he a god, a lesser God. 10. The Jehovah's Witnesses see a composite Christ class. Jesus Christ is merely the first of a class of exalted men. 4. The Watchtower Society has destroyed th e Biblical concept of sin. This is accomplished very subtly. Sin is so trivial th at sinful mankind is to receive a second chance and will teach itself how to overcome si n in the Millennium. The Christ class will live perfect lives without sin. Men on their own strength in a perfect environment will be able to attain perfection an d sinlessness. (See Truth book , chapter 9, para. 4 as an example of this type of thinking.) 5. While condemning the occult to its fo llowers, the Watchtower leaders have gone to the occult for enlightenment. For instance, Ruth erford received his messages from fallen angels supposedly working out their redemption. 6. The WT Society does not accept all relig ions—in this it appears to disagree radically with other New Age groups. At least this Author thought so, until I scratched below the surface in researching the Watchtower Society. An indepth look at what the Watchtower Society has condemned shows that only lip-s ervice has been given to the idea other religions are false. In reality, there is one e xception, that is t he only religion has been singled out and targeted for attack as the enemy is Christianity. 7. The Watchtower Society beli eves that ultimately mankind will elevate itse lf to Godhood. Texe Marrs, although very scimpy on the proof, correctl y placed the Watchtower Society in the camp of New Age religions in his book New Age Cults & Religions. It was one of the first Masonic New Age religions. They have been preparing mank ind for an alien rulership of 144,000 alien beings— known by Christians as demons. This last charge—that the 144,000 will be demons is ba sed on the following: demons have been supplying the WT leaders with gui dance, and the Masonic Plans to bring in a world government include se tting up a government of al iens to rule mankind. Understand that only the very selected top of the leadership realiz e this. The rank and file are taught to fear demons, and not to believe in aliens. Several New Age channelers have told me (or someone who spoke with them have said) that the Hierarchy (the Spiritual Hi erarchy that guide the occult, New Age, and Masonic groups) has been directing the Wa tchtower Society leaders, but that the Hierarchy has been having trouble bringing them into line. Appa rently there is an effort to bring them into line. S hare International Magazine, Oc tober 1988 has a article about Maitreya visiting Kingdom Halls. The article concludes, \"Som e Jehovah's Wi tnesses have had certain experiences as a result of Maitreya's presenc e among them which have led them to abandon an entrenc ed, 'ideological' position.\" Another subtle indication that the Watcht ower Society is moving its people toward a One-World-Religion is that they have been t eaching their people what the other religions"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"believe. Only Christianity has been singled out as a target for criticism and abuse. True, the Society hasn't approved of these other religions, but the idea of teaching their people what the other religions believe, is a new it em and a step toward a possible assimilation. On the other hand, it could be postulated that the Hierarchy has lied to these channelers, and that also the New Agers are exaggerating Lord Maitreya's influence among the Kingdom Halls when he visits. Perhaps as some claim, the Watchtower isn't smart enough to criticize the Hindus. (Even the public pap ers criticized the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh— so that argument is very difficult to swallow.) ARE THE JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES CHRISTIANS AS THEY CLAIM? This question can be debated, however it is clear that all the fundamental important sacred concepts of Christiani ty have been attacked by this organization calling itself Christian. Why did they feel a deep seated need to eliminate Christ's name out of our dating system? Why have they felt such a deep seated need to a ttack the idea that Christ died on a cross. Let us examine their attack on t he cross. This is a prime example of their anti-Christ anti-Christian bias. For most people that Christ di ed on a cross is taken for g ranted. It is simply not an issue. And what difference does it make ho w exactly he died? It is a rare person who questions the idea he died on the cross, unless he is someone who has come under the influence of the Watchtower Society. If the Christian wants to know how Christ died, the Scriptures are very clear—he died on a cross. A close reading tells us that. In Mt 27:37 it tells us that when Christ was being crucified they nailed the sign above his head. (If the WT is correct then the sign would have been above his hands as a stake would require. ) It goes on to say in verse 38 that on his left hand was one robber and on his right hand's side was another. This is nonsense by WT drawings of C hrist's hands tied above hi s head. In Jn 20:25, the resurrected Jesus talks about t he prints of the nails in hi s hands. The WT Society has acknowledged that Num 21:9 is a picture of Christ's death. (For instance see What Has Religion Done For Mankind where they even portray this.) They also acknowledge in the Awake! May 22,1952 that flag banners were crosse s in ancient times. The Hebrew word in Num 21:9 picturing and forecasting Christ's crucifixion is Nec which means a flag banner which in those days was a cross. The mark placed on the foreheads of those saved (see Ez 9:4, also Rev 7:3) was called \"tav\" in Ez 9:4. The \"tav\" in Ezek iel's day was a cross shaped Hebrew letter. For this reason Christians in early times of Rom an persecution made the sign of the cross on their foreheads. Bottom line is that Gal. 6:14 states that the cross is import ant for Christians to glory and boast about. It is an important symbol. Does the Watchtower use their authority to glorify the cross? Do they instead glorify in the torture stake which they claim was used? NO. What truth loving Christian authority woul d attack Christianity so viciously as the Watchtower Society does conc erning the cross, while i gnoring so many Christian scriptures? The real answer lies in the Watchtower leaders veiled hatred for Christ and his atoning work on the Christ. As with so many Masons who lead various religious groups they do not honor Christ in a Christian way."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"MASONIC SMOKESCREENS The smokescreens put out by the Masonic Lodge are so thick they come close to choking any investigator.

Masons assist public schools and other public bo- dies in a variety of ways . Masons and members of Masonic affiliated bodies assist as tutors. Some Lodges have scholarship programs, student re- cognition programs, and activities recognizing the achievements of students and teachers. Masons serve as volunteers for many community projects.

FIRST WITNESS Within the Masonic Referenc e 10,000 Famous Freemason s is an article on the Freemason John Robison (1739- 1805). John Robison was a pr ofessor of natural history at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland and secretary of the Royal Society in that city. We are talking about a we ll educated respected man. In 1797 Robison published information in a book entitle d Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meetings of the Freemasons, llluminati, and Reading Societies Collec ted From Good Authorities. 1 The book is still available.

With the Unit arian and Theosophical system in Masonry it is nearing this goal.

He wrot e, \"I then focused my attention and study to learn how the lodge was started, and by whom. At this point, I became thoroughly convinced, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that a world-wide conspiracy existed against God, Our Lord and Savior and all mankind.\" 3 OTHER WITNESSES There have been other Maso ns and ex-Masons that have given similar testimony.

Stevens, an ex-Mason te stifies, \"If the lodge went unchecked, the United States would have a Masonic monarc hy for its government, a Masonic church, a Masonic way to a Masonic heaven...Masonry was a state within a stat e and that one day Masons would overthrow the democratic government of the United States and would crown one of their 'grand kings' as ruler of this nation.\" 4 As the reader continue s into Unit 2 he will see in detail how the Masons have done what these witne sses have warn ed us about. Freemasonry has repeatedly told the public th at it doesn't keep its memberships secret. For instance, in an article entitled \"What Can I Tell My Non-Maso nic Friends???\" in the Scottish Rite's New Age Magazi ne it says, \"You can explain that Freemasonry is not a"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"\"secret society.\" A secret society is one t hat keeps its existenc e a secret and whose members do not make known their affiliation wi th the group. Freemason ry is not a secret society because it does not hide its existe nce nor do members hide their membership.\" Dear friends, any Mason saying that ought to have his nose grow long. That is simply a boldfaced lie. Repeatedly, th e Masons have created secret groups within secret groups. They seem to have a ceaseless urge to create new organizations, and many like the Pallidium Rite are secret. That is why they do not keep wr itten records, and why the Pallidium Rite's finances are separate from the regular lodges. The Highest Masonic authorities have repeatedly lied to keep secret their memberships. Gary Blevins has a letter received from Gran d Executive Director William G. Sizemore, 33°, of the Supreme Council at the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. which denies that Ronald Reagon is a Mason. 5 The April, 1988 New Age Magazine shows on its front page cover Presiden t Reagon receiving th e honorary 33rd degree of Masonry. When friends of this Author ha ve called Billy Graham's minist ry to ask if he has been or is a Freemason, they were told that his ministry chose not to comment on the matter. And yet on the authority of a number of several very reliabl e sources his me mbership has been confirmed to this Author . (See chapter 2.1 for a disc ussion and an explanation of the meaning of this.) When President George Bush became presiden t, by law he was required to place in the Library of Congress information about hi mself. That information included his 33° membership in the Scottish Ri te, but after a few months the information disappeared from the Library of Congress. (George Bush by the way took his presidential oath on a Masonic Bible.) These are just some of th e examples I am aware of where the Masonic Lodge is covering up prominent memberships. They are covering up the memberships of Congressmen and religious leaders too. HEAVIER COVERUPS 6 This chapter up to this point has only scra tched the surface of two organizations who are front organizations for th e Power. If the Maso nic Lodge and the Wa tchtower Society have been screened in such secrecy, what about the organization th at controls both the Watchtower Society an d the Masonic Lodge? Indeed, Satan's closest worshippers have b een shrouded in the deepest secrecy. Each of the top Satanists have at le ast one cover. That cover is a life that they live in the public's view. They may be a mayor of a town, a busine ss leader, or a Christian evangelist. The primary goal is that the cover makes them look good to the public, or at least too powerful for people to believe critic ism of them. For instance, George Bush is nicknamed the teflon president because no crit icism of him seems to stick, even though the proof is abundant that the man is a ve ry dangerous servant of the New World Order. Perhaps one of the most su cessful covers of the New World Order has been the one Adolf Hitler with the help of Satanists world-wide has fois tered on the history books. Hitler's cover was to be an anti-Judeo-Masoni c crusader. Hitler pretended to be the ultimate crusader against the One World Powe r, while he really was a powerful Satanist and descendent of the llluminati family of the Rothschilds. Stalin was a co-conspirator in the Satanic llluminati's plans. Bear in mind England according to Satanists is the Satanic mother of all nations —the center for llluminism. 7 Hitler personally intervened to"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"prevent his tanks from destroying the Britis h Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk. Hitler personally intervened to prevent the German invasion force fr om capturing Leningrad, and Stalin personally intervened to prev ent the Soviet milita ry from protecting itself when many intelligence sources were warning them of a German invasion. The llluminati got exactly the war they had planned and ex actly the results they wanted , and Hitler's Satanic role for the llluminati is still basicly secret. The fictions revolv ing around W.W. II are too numerous to try to clear up, the reader's mind would simply not accept them. Perhaps after reading this book, enough of a thinking pr ocess will have occure d to get the reader to initiate his or her own inve stigation. Part of what really went on behind the cover of killing Jews, was the elimination of all devout Chri stians and the placement of Satanists into leading offices. The U.S. Army and the Soviet army facilitated this after Germany surrendered. Information about the top le vel of Satan's organization are hard to get because: A. Much of the activities are committed to memory. B. Informants or people who know too much are murdered. C. High level Satanists from the time of birth ha ve been psycologically worked over by mind programming to commit suicide if they think about things that they are not to reveal. Information that has come out of the Satanic cults is so unbelievable that most people dismiss it. Why is the informat ion unbelievable? Because the ma jority of people in this nation have been programmed by the Satanists. Chapter 3.3 documents how the leading Satanists control the mass media. Over a period of decades they have subtly brainwashed the people, in such a subtle way that people do not even know they have had their behavior modified and controlled. This author ha s repeatedly witnessed that buzz words when told to the masses cause th em to respond like Pavl ov's dog. (Part of the reason that this Author can write this book is that I was spared from watching Television until age 11, and since then have on ly seen small amounts of Television and Movies since, in part what little has been viewed was done to understand the American people and the Power.) A program of kidnapping and implanting of control devices within the heads of people has also been going on, without t he people knowing what has happened to them when they return to society. THE FORCE In order to fully understand why evil men, also do good deeds let us study the philosophy of Satanism which perpetuat es the gnostic principle of duality. Gnostic religions have since their inceptions worked off a dual view of the power. This thinking is directly linked to Hegelian philo sophy, which by prov iding to the masses opposite answers oftens dive rts people from seeing the co rrect answer which has little to do with the two extreme views nor with t heir synthesis. The easiest way perhaps to explain what we are discussing is to refer peop le to how the force in Star Wars could be used for both good and evil. In the final analysis , the mind set of Satanists is that they themselves above all others have been deceived into th inking that light can be used for good or evil. This is seen in their idea that there is white and black magic. According to Alexander Wilder in his book Philosophy and Ethics of the Zoroasters (pub. 1885) \"The Mithraic rites supersede d the Mysteries of Baccus, and became the foundation of the Gnostic system, which for ma ny centuries prevailed in Asia, Egypt, and even the remote West.\" The importance of this is that if the foundation of the Gnostic"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"5 INTERLOCKED CONCEPTS OF THE SERPENT "},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"system with its various religious hierarchies is based on Mithraism, then it is apparent that the concept of the Force cont aining both evil and good was part of the Gnostic system. Mithraism believed in a good god Ahura-Mazda (aka Ormu zd, and aka in latin as Oromazes). The llluminati today often uses the latin version of the word Oromazes. Ahriman is the evil god and places evil wher e ever Ormuz creates good or does a good deed. Mithras is the mediator between the two. Today the lllu minati continue to believe in two principles, Satan and Lucifer. Satan is the evil one, Lucifer is the good side of the Force. Mithras tries to harmo nize the two. In order to be in step with Mithras the llluminatus as he (or she) ascends the occult ladder must try to ba lance his progressively evil deeds with equally benevole nt deeds. Consequently, the most wickedest and powerful Satanists are big philanthropists as they try to balance their deeds while gaining Satanic power. The belief of the Satanists is that if an unbalance occurs th ey are destroyed. The initiate into Mithraism was to ld Mithra was his own soul, Ormuz was his spiritual nature and Ahriman was his animal nature. The \"Grip of the Lions Paw\" an d the references to the Lion in the Master Masons degree come from Mithraism. 8 Part of the benevolence done by Satanic or ganizations and Satanist s is part of their belief system to maintain a balance within their lives of the dual principles, it is not entirely done to deceive. In contrast to this Jesus Christ told the G nostic religious leaders that evil is will be judged by God, and that all the good deeds of mankind are but filthy rags. The Caduceus is a wand with two serpents twined around it and often has two small wings or a winged helmet on its wand's top. Today it serves various uses symbolically. It is the insignia of the Catholic bishop in the Ukraine. The symbol is very ancient and goes back to ancient Indian Hindu temp les and Mesopotamia (B abylonia, Sumer, Assyria). The Buddhists also use it to repres ent the world (wand) and the kundalini force (serpents). But what the twin snakes are always expressing is the \"idea of active equilibrium, of opposing forces balancing one another in such a way as to create a higher, static form.\" (book on sy mbols of witchcraft). This is a symbolic representation of the balance the leading Satanists attempt to maintain between their evil and philanthropic deeds. [Figures of a Swiss 1515 Caduceus and an early Sumerian caduceus from several thousand ago.] SATANIC RITUAL ABUSE 9 Why is this item put in a chapter on Sm okescreens? Because wh at has been called Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) is the primary v ehicle for maintaining the shroud of secrecy. The primary part of Satanic Ritual Abuse is to use a series of sophisticated and sadistic mind control strategies which use the combined effects of physical pain and threat of pain, double-bind coercion, split brain stimul ation, drugs, hypnotism, and other methods to program and brainwas h the candidates for membership in the llluminati. In order for the lower level covens and the Satanic hierarchy to maintain its secrecy, intense effort is expended to program all the members of th e Satanic hierarchy to commit suicide if they"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"betray the Satanic covens. Ther e is no easy way for such people to ta lk or break lose from the llluminati. The professional terminology for this mind control is \"conditioned stimulus-response sequences.\" The program s that are taught the subconscio us mind of the Satanists can be triggered by auditory, visual, tactile, olfa ctory and/or gustatory (taste) modalities. In other words the trigger to cause them to hur t or kill themselves or someone else are subconsciously set to go off by some sensory trigger, perhap s a word that they are not to reveal. But these people are not just gi ven one program. Layers upon layers of destructive back up program s are put into their minds. These layers of programming ar e intentionally put into place by creating in the tiny infants multiple personalities called alternate personalities or alters for short. Once the splitting process is started on the human persona lity, it is like passing critical mass on the splitting process of atoms in a nuclear reaction, it becomes di fficult to stop the splitting process which is self-sustaining. People who are Satanists or come out of Satanism have Multip le personalities. Adolf Hitler is quite a visibl e example. He could talk peac e with the Czechs and Poles while simultaneously preparing for war. Should something go wrong the Satanists are programmed to do such things as stop eating, have an accident, ingest poison, not sleep, not to ta ke medicene, break their own bones, etc. Reminders to reinforce these trig gers are enacted via such things as spoken phrases, taps, or a rapid series of six el ectronic tones. These suicide programs are responsible for many of the shootings, hangin gs, overdoses, auto accidents, starvation, etc. that ex-Satanists experi ence. However, their deaths are not all suicide, Satanists will also put in great effort to kill the ex-Satanists. Satanists are also programme d with Scrambling programs to confuse and block their alter system, emerging memories, thought pr ocesses and incoming data. Other programs forced into the SRA victims are Flooding programs to in terfere with any therapeutic process, Recycle programs to c ause the SRA victim to re-di ssociate memories if any do get revealed, Cover programs to discredit the SRA victims stories with unbelievable content, Verbal Response progra ms which have been extensiv ely and painfully rehearsed by the SRA victim and his programmer to wa rd off questions about Satanism and the victim's alters with acceptable answers. So me other programs are the Silence-Shutdown Programs which cause the victim to stop talk ing, another type is called Nightmare-Night Terror Programs which cause th eir minds to terrify them with horrible images. These programs can be tripped automatically if the vi ctim tries to talk ab out forbidden material. It is critical to realize the extent of such mind programming. Not only have the Satanists practiced this mind control for centuries, going clear back to early Hinduism and the early Mystery religions, but the mind programming is pa rt of the life of the child of Satanists on an ongoing basis without time to be safe from the abuse. The Ritual Abuse Task Forc e, Los Angeles County Comm ission for Women put out a report in 1990. The following are excerpts from it. Because of the nature of this material, I am quoting directly so that it will not appear to be simply this Author's own opinion but rather this is the real story about the indoctrination that pe ople are going through everyday into the beliefs of Satanism. \"Ritual abuse is usually carried out by memb ers of a cult.

These young victims are particularly susceptible to being terrorized and indoctri nated into the abuser s belief system. During and even long after the abuse victims live in a state of terror and di ssociation and suffer from the impact of mind contro l techniques. All this makes th e initial disclosures of abuse exceedingly difficult, and can ma ke each subsequent disclosu re a terrifying and painful experience. \"Mind control is the cornerstone of ritual ab use, the key element in the subjugation and silencing of its victims. Victim s of ritual abuse are subjected to a rigoro usly applied system of mind control designed to rob them of their sense of free will and to impose upon them the will of the cult and its leaders. Most ofte n these ritually abusive cults are motivated by a satanic belief system. The mind control is achieved through an elaborate system of brainwashing, programming, indoctrination, hypnosis, and the us e of various mind- altering drugs. The purpose of the mind control is to compel ritual abuse victims to keep the secret of their abuse, to conform to th e beliefs and behaviors of the cult and to become functioning members who serve the cu lt by carrying out the directives of its leaders without being detected within society at large.\" It is not by accident the the Mason Mesmer came out publicly with hypnotism (aka Mesmerism). The occult ists who were the foundation of many of the Science Academies have been working to give scientific credibilit y to their occult met hods. What was once Satanic is now scientific. Hynotism, spirit guides, visualization etc. which have long been part of the occult's mind control methods ar e now \"scientific\" and becoming an integral part of modern society. Other occult beliefs, such as evolution (discussed later), are being made the foundation of many of the arts and sciences. Step by step the Satanic Plan for world domination is being carried out. You the reader will l earn what these plans are and how they are being carried out, if you read the rest of this book. HOW CREDIBLE ARE SU CH ISSUES AS SATANISM? How can this book maintain credibility in examining Sata nism, when to assert the possibility of Satanism seems so unreasonable and monstrous ? Not only is Satanism a historical fact, it is a contemporary experience of eyewitnesses who have been interviewed by this Author. THE HISTORICAL FACTS Throughout the history of Eu rope (and the rest of t he world) there have been widespread reports of witchcraft. Not all practitioners of Witchcraft are Satanist s, but Witchcraft is a part of Satanism. All across Europe and indeed the whole world come countless hi storical documents attesting to the practice of witchcraft, and on a lesser scale also Satanism. It has long been recognized by scholars wh o study witchcraft that some of witchcraft is merely slight-of-hand, terror, fraud, in sanity, sensory illusion, hypnosis or semi- hypnosis. 10 "},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Witches in earlier times believed that they could fly on broomsticks on the Sabbat (the Satanic Sabbath). Chemists who have reconstruc ted medieval potions that were recipes for flying ointments have identified that these potions are of hemlock and aconite, (henbane and Jimsonweed were also used). These were in reality drugs that often gave the witch the notion of flying through t he air when she applied the drugs. There are reports by medieval judges w ho watched suspected witches to ss in delirium after these potions were applied, and then witnessed the individual witches insist that they had \"flown\" to their Sabbat and retur ned, yet the judges knew in fa ct they had never left the room. 11 Apparently, the use of these flying potions was widespread, and their covens would secretly carry the witches while they were delirious to the S abbat, and when they would come down from their drug trip they w ould believe that they had flown and their belief in Witchcraft as a powerf ul fulfilling life would be increased. But in spite of many of the non-supernat ural explanations for various aspects of witchcraft, there is an element of the supernatural that persists. I say supernatural based on the common opinion that demonic spirit s are supernatural. However, the demons may be more a natural part of this w orld than is commonly realized. In 1681, two respected schol ars Joseph Glanvil and Dr. Henry More published their scientific and empirical evidence that Witchcraft existed. The book was called Sadducismuc Triumphatus, Or full and plain Evidence concerning Witches and Apparitions...After the first came the Third Edition with Additions... (pub. in 2 parts) London, 1700. The book was an extensive co mpilation of case-histories and other evidence of Witchcraft. The book was so well received it settled the issue for a period until the book was forgotten. The book went through 5 is sues it was so popular. In 1668, Dr. Meric Casaubon came out with a book that contains information and evidence of Witchcraft. His A Treatise Proving Spirits, Witches and Supernatural Operations by Pregnant Instances and Evidence, was also well received and republished in 1672. Obviously, the controversy about the existenc e of Satanism is an old one, but the evidence concerning Satanism is very old and sufficient throughout history. Skeptics to Satanism, have tended to be people who did not believe in God or perhaps anything supernatural. But within my own lifetime, this Author has seen how those who reject God because they supposedly don't believe in the supernatural and God is supernatural, have turned to the occult for their values and their world-view. T hey claim they are rejecting the supernatural, but their action s show they are rejecting God. Witchcraft is not simply silly credulity. It is hoped that as the Power (Satanism) takes a stronger power grip on the world, its Satani c aspect will become more visible, so that when it fails people will know it for its evil deed s. Our written history has typically greatly under reported both good a nd evil. Evil prefers the darkne ss and evil prefers good not to shine, consequently the Power as it has c ontrolled the media has ignored many miracles that God has done across the world, while si multaneously ignoring the activities of Satanism. This has served to blow smoke over the whole spiritual battlefield. This Author can identify with somethi ng Joseph Glanvil wrote on page 6 of his Sadducismuc Triumphatus. After years of studying witchcraft and trying to debunk the stories and testimony of wi tnesses, Glanvil writes conc erning those people in general who object, \"To this aggregate Objection I ret urn, in the general, The more absurd and unaccountable these ac tions [of witchcraft] seem, the greater confirmations are they to"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"me of the Truth of those Relations, and the Re ality of what the Obje ctors would destroy.

Why would people s eeking help and understanding (SRA victims) repeatedly say that they had guardian spirits t hat looked like E.T. (the alien on the film E.T.)? People coming out of the Satanism, the llluminati, or Encounters of the third kind with Flying Saucers are repeatedly making similar outlandish statements that can only obviously destroy their credibilit y. These people can't all be ir rational in the exact same way. Their stories are too similar. Statements by those who have become Christians who were into Satanism say that Satan appears like an exceedingly hand some man with cloven hoofs. These contemporary witness, sound just like the testimony that has come forth for centuries. For instance, in France in 1578, Jeanne Hervilli er testified that her Satan was dressed in black with hoofs, and in 1646 an English witch named Joan Wallis testified the same thing that Satan was \"a large man in blackish cl othing, but with cloven feet.\" Can such confirmation of the description by people in different countries at different time periods simply be dismissed? These demons are reported to like the tr iangle symbol. For whatever reasons the triangle is becoming a popular symbol to use today. These demons also lie prolifically. There are many tie-ins between UFOs, demoni c activity, Satanism, and the New World Order. That is a subject vast enough for another book. The foundation of the Satanic religion, its basic doctrine from t he middle ages down to the present was that Satan would one day rule the world. \"The triumph of Satan will only be accomplished when the dualist dilemma is obviated and when one single force, Satan, rules supreme....This vision and ambition eventually becam e the fundamental Satanic influence in medieval Europe and laid the ground f or the full-fledged Satanic religion known as witchcraft.\" (—Magic: Black, Wh ite, and Otherwise chapt er of The Occult Conceit, p. 81) 12 The inventions that intuitively came to scient ists that were involved in the occult, make it suspicious that the technology has been spoon-fed mankind with an ulterior motive. Satanism during the Middle Ages was extensive, but it wasn't the threat to the world, as it is today with the increased world-wide co mmunications, centralized controls, and high technology. Before there was merely the will to have Satan rule, but now there are power structures and the means to. The Old Testament states that God formed the nations to limit the power of evil. Today, the world is be ing rushed into globalism without being told the dangers. By the end of this book you will learn more about how the plans for the future Satanic slave-state ha ve been carefully concealed. 1. Denslow, 10,000 Famous Freemasons, Vol. IV, p. 54 2. Storms, E.M.

But for now here are some note worthy items, that can be mentioned in ge neral about the Masonic infiltration of the churches. 1. Ministers, especially high ranking church offi cials are special targets of recruitment. Not only is this known to this Author from interviews with ex-high ranki ng Masons, but can also be seen from the following quote from the Proceedings of the Grand Lodge of Illinois (1909), The Grand Master Charles R. Smith speaki ng to a large Masonic meeting which had representatives from 24 foreign grand lodges, an d representatives from 54 lodges in attendance stated his following decision, \"1. I was asked, \"Is a Jewish Rabbi a minister of the gospel,\" within the meaning of section 21, chapter XV of the constitution, entitling him, in the discretion of the lodge, to a reduction in. or rebate of the fees for initiation? As Je wish Rabbis are authorized by law to perform marriage ceremonies and other dutie s appertaining to the sacred o ffice of the ministry, I ruled that they were \"ministers of the gospel\" within the meaning of the section.\" (Underlining added to highlight how recruited ministers ca n get their fees waived by a lodge.) 3 2. In some denominations the selection of what congregation a minister is assigned to involves church politics, that can give the Masons an edge. Conservativ e ministers are assigned small, poor rural churches. More liberal ministers with the right connectio ns are given large, rich, city congregations. Not only is this bor n out by an interview with an ex-minister, but reports like the following make it suspect. This report is from th e Bishop of Southwark, Dr. Mervyn Stockwood, \"A case known to me involved a particularly unfortunate appointment to an important living. The man, a Mason, had little to commend him. But he wa s approved by the diocesan, the suffragan and by the archdeacon—all of whom were Masons. I am prepared to believe that the hierarchy was innocent and never allowed the Mas onic factor to determine their choice. But in the diocese it was widely believed that it was the golden hand-shake rather than the Holy Spirit that filled the vacant living.\" 4 3. The Masons are a seed of destruction to the church using techni ques parallel to what sucessfully worked for the white man against the Indian. The American Indian was conquered by the white man due to a series of several contri buting factors such as fa lse pretensions of peace by the white man, the introduc tion of infectuous diseases an d bad habits (alcohal), and the promotion or the problem of in ter-rivalry between Indian group s (divide and co nquer). Within the Christian churches Masons ar e introducing various \"infectious diseases\" such as (to name a few) are subjective religion, witchcraft and th e New Age under different labels, the Rapture theory, fatalism toward an Armagggedon, expectat ions that the Jews (p racticing Pharisism from Babylon) will rebuild their temp le, the notion that th e Asian-bloode d Askinazim Jews are God's chosen people and have an inherent right to take Palestine, a lack of zeal toward evangelism, especially cult evangelism, and ecumenicalism. On e woman into Eastern St ar, who calls herself a Christian, informs people that one can be a Ch ristian and believe in evolution. According to her, those Christians who don't believe in evol ution are bringing dishonor to Christianity. Episcopalian Dr. Morey would ha ve us believe that Freemasonr y was a Christian organization before Albert Pike turned it in to a \"Hindu temple.\" However, th is is pure Masonic propoganda. Any unbiased researcher will find the Christian c hurches were concerned from the very beginning about Freemasonry. According to the Scottish Rite's New Age Magazine the first expose of"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Freemasonry was in 1730 and entitled Ma sonry Dissected by Samuel Prichard. 5 In 1798 and 1803 the Baptist Reverend Henry Crocker in Vermont preached sermons against Freemasonry saying it\" makes a disturbance in the churches...\" 6 In the rare Autobiography of Rev. Abel C. Thomas, writing about 1829, records his observations of a Mason minister, \"the light of Mr. Kneeland was fast going away into the darkness of Atheism in the Masonic Hall.\" 7 In the Masonic book The Spirit of Masonry published in 1775 we are told, \"Masons know the way of gaining an understanding of Abrac.\" 8 Abrac is a type of magic. There are many other quotes that could be ad ded from this time period, but the reader can see the point which is being made . Masonry has been a cancer destr oying the Protestant churches for over two hundred year s. Charles Finney the great Christia n evangelist after he'd joined and found out what Freemasonry was ab out, became a rabid anti-Mason. This was in 1 824, the year he went into evangelism. While Finney was warning Christians ab out Masonry, another Christian, the Rev. George Taft was saying, \"Masonry and religion—what God hath joined together, let no man put assunder.\" 9 Dr. Morey claims he read \"everything\" the Christians had wr itten about Freemasonry. 10 He claims in the book to have studied Masonry in depth and found it was Christian before Albert Pike. One wonders if he missed the great Evange list Charles Finney's st atements. Finney was a Mason, but left to be a Christia n in 1824. He stated in the 1830 s, \"Surely, if Masons really understood what Masonry is, as it is delineated in these books , no Christian Mason would think himself to remain at liberty anot her day as a member of the fratern ity. It is as plain as possible that a man knowing what it is, and embracing it in his heart, cannot be a Christian man. To say he is is to disbelieve the very nature of Christianity.\" 4. According to an ex-M ason now Christian, the Masons have infiltrated all the religious and denominational groups. Whether this is an over statement or not, it is clear from the Author's research that it can't be much of an overstatement, because Mas ons can be found even in groups that forbid them. If organizations of Christians are examined Masons can also be found in the leadership. By controlling Bible So cieties, the type of Bible tran slations, the distribution pattern, etc. are controlled. Some examples of Masons within Christian Societies are: American Bible Society- John T. Manson (Pres. ABS), Edgar C. Powers (33°, Dist. Sec. of ABS), William Phillips Hall (V.Pres. ABS, trustee Old St. John St. Meth. Episc. church, NY, KT & Scottish Rite), John Pi ntard (ABS 1st Sec.) American Christian Alliance- Willia m H.

The influence of Masonry upon church teachi ngs can be seen in what the Educational and Historical Commission of the Gr and Lodge of Georgia published in its Leaves from Georgia Masonry, \"Let us take a look at the number of great Bible cl asses for men which have been organized by the Church. Many of these classes are being led by enlight ened Masons....These laymen are bringing to the interpretati on of the Bible many of Masonry's great revelations.\" 11 (bold added) Circle G- Seminaries and Christian Schools Circle G on the chart is Seminaries and Scho ols.

Without Grants many Christian schools woul d end up in the red financially. I am looking at an interoffice me mo of a Christian Seminary \"R E: The Five Ye ar Planning Process.\" It states, \"We must cultivate a financial support base of both current and endowment revenue adequate to securing the desired quality of students , faculty, staff and facilities.\" 12 Seminaries cultivate relationships th at bring them financial grants. What foundations are busy giving money to re ligious institutions? There are a host of tiny foundations, and some medium size ones that were started by sincere people. Most if not all of the few big foundations tie-in to the One- World-Power. The On e-World-Power in 1964 provided about one-third of the gr ant money going to religious groups. 13 In terms of foundation powe r, the manipulation of Chri stendom can not hardly be underestimated. In order to stand in line for life- sustaining finances, Christian institutions have to \"prostitute\" themselves to the wi shes of the One-World-Conspiracy. AN EXAMPLE OF A SMALL FO UNDATION—HOUSTON ENDOWMENT The Mason Jesse H. Jones create d the Houston Endowment. The disbursement of grants in 1984 give us an example of a small Foundation which is working for the One-World-System. In 1984, Houston endowment gave out the following grant amounts 14 : Abilene Christian University- $50,000 Jewish Anti-Defamation Leag ue of B'nai B'rith- $5,000 Asbury Theological Seminary- $5,000 Baylor College of Medicene- $30,366 Baylor University- $795,000 Congregation Beth Israel (synagogue)- $5,000 First Presbyterian Church of Houston- $5,000 Georgetown Univ.

Meth. Church- $15,000 Salvation Army- $397,611 South. Meth. Univ.- $50,000"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Texas Christian Univ.- $50,000 Texas Lutheran College- $215,000 Texas Wesleyan College $50,000 Trinity Univ.- $55,000 It is clear that these institutions must not be rocking the boat concerning the Freemasons. It is also noteworthy that the radical Jewish ADL which has bombed a nd assasinated people ruthlessly is a recepient. Until this book, few people would have seen any link between the Church of Christ, Jewish synagogues, Baptists, Lutherans, Methodists, Ca tholics, Presbyterians, and Salvation Army concer ns. This book is exposing that the Mas ons have interest in all of these groups. AN EXAMPLE OF A LARGE FOUNDATION— In the book The Unholy Alliance details are gi ven on how the seminaries, church boards and Christian colleges have been ca ptured. Much of the money for this came from the Rockefellers. One of the principle large Foundations that was instrumental in controlli ng religious institutions of various kinds was the Sealantic Fund. (T hey have now shifted to other channels.) This Foundation which was inco rporated in 1938 and was head quartered in New York City (50 West 50th St.) gave enormous sums of money to manipulate Protestant concerns. In 1964, according to the Russell Sage Fo undation's book The Fo undation Directory the Sealantic Fund gave away $681, 886 in grants. 15 In 1969, the Fund gave $1,889,550 in grants. 16 By 1984, the Sealantic Fund was not being used . But a look at another Rockefeller non-profit untaxed Foundation the Rockefeller Brother's Fu nd shows a revealing gran t pattern. Until this book, many people would not be able to assimila te the meaning of this pattern. Although these other Rockefeller Foundations are not specifically geared toward religion such as the Sealantic Fund was it is clear these other Foundations still impact religion.

The next chapter w ill explore the Catholic church 's part in the One-World- Religion. THE INFILTRATION OF THE BAPTISTS The largest of any Protestant denomination in the U.S. are the Southern Baptists. How widespread is Freemasonry in this largest deno mination? 40% of the Southern Baptist ministers are Masons. 19 Not only are large numbers of Baptist ministers Freemasons, but the various Baptist denominational leaderships are heavily Masonic. Some examples are, Brook Hays, 33°, President of the So uthern Baptist Convention in 1957. Joseph C. Hazen, 32°, Corresponding Secretary of the Nort hern Baptist Convention, 1940-51. Commentator of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in Amer., 1930-45. Matthew W. Hill, Vice-Pres. of the American Baptist Convention, 33° and York Rite (K.T.?). Kenneth Raymond Kennedy, minister of General Assn. Gen. Bapt. and later Exec. Sec. of the Gen. Assn. General Bapt., 1965-1977 Joseph Fort Newton, 33°, author of seve ral masonic books and a Baptist minister. Aaron E. Prince, 32° a Baptist minister and president of two Christian colleges. George W. Truet (1867-1944), 32 °, President of th e Baptist World Allia nce, 1934-39, and President of the Southern Baptist Convention, 1927-29. William R. White, 33°, President of the Baptist Ba ylor University, Waco, TX since 1948. Baylor University was by the way named after th e Baptist Mason Robert E.B. Baylor. The list could go on...Myron E. Ad ams...David Benedict...Clarence A. Barbour...and on and on. 20 SCOT-BAPTISTS, MASONRY, & MORMONISM The Baptist Masons can be seen to have tie-ins to heresy. Sidney Rigdon was the Baptist minister who th rew his lot in to support Joseph Smith start the Mormon church. Rigdon had been licensed to the ministry in the First Baptist Church in Pittsburgh, PA . in 1819. 21 The 1866 Directory of Pittsburgh a nd Allegheny states on p. 10 that this First Baptist Church met in the Masonic Hall. Sidney Rigdon, was influenced by the ideas of the same occultist thinkers who were active in secret societies in Eur ope as Karl Marx was. Ideologies, such as communism, are in many ways modern forms of religion. 22 The original"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"thinkers devising Comm unism were men like Sain t-Simon, who wanted to give birth to a new Messiah. In order for his goal of breaking the ba ck of Christianity, a new religion had to be created. His final work was The New Christianity . He and his disciples planned for a fantastic new secular religion with globalness that fore shadowed much of this century's thinking. 23 A recurrent mythic model for ma ny of the early revolutionists was Prometheus, who in Greek religious thought had been the T itan who stole fire fro m the gods for mankind . Fire, and flames have been used as a symbol of enlightenment for many occultic groups. This gi ves us further understanding behind Lenin's name for his periodical \"The Spark.\" 24 One of the Masonic adepts says that the Illuminati Hammer of Thor repr esents illuminating power. This in all probability is the origin of the Russian's flag's hammer. 25 To understand the origins of revol ution and today's New World Orde r it is of profit to realize that \"speculation about 'the year 2000' began not with the futuro logy of the 1960s, but with a dramatic work written in the 1780s by the same figure who invented the word communist.\" 26 The secret fraternal society of \"Society of Flowers\" in Fra nce (1836-38) was the first full- fledged communist society.\" Prior to its foundi ng there were a multitude of experiments along a similar line. Owen founded communes in both England and America. Owen was invited to France by one of his disciples Jules Gay to set up a \"Maison Harmonien ne\" to unite Saint- Simonianism, Fourierism, and Owenism. He went in 1837. Th e Mason Buonarroti produced a basic text for social revolutionaries later entitle d History of the Consprir acy of Equals. This book was widely used by french soci al revolutionaries. The Mas on Buonarroti, who headed the Universal Statistical Society, and who looke d up to Owen, helped get a small Owenite Association of All Classe s of All Nations going. 27 Saint-Simonianism was continued after Saint- Simon died by the son of a Jewish banker O linde Rodriques and his student Enfantin. The Scotch Baptists (immersed Sandemanians), started in 1775 by the Scot minister John Glas, were also a primary s ource of Sidney Rigdon's thinking. It is not hardly known that Alexander Campbell was conve rted to the Scotch Baptists, and th at his Disciples of Christ were an offshoot of this group. 28 Rigdon's \"Baptist\" church was of this type, and maintained tenuous if any relations with ot her Baptist churches. The Scot Bap tists practiced a modified communism 29 and believed in a Universal church. 30 Alexander Campbell lost patience with their church in Pittsburgh, PA becau se they were havi ng so many problems. 31 Alexander Campbell had initially received help from the Presbyter ians, and later was ordained by the regular Baptists, 32 but finally struck out on his own tang ent, and Sidney Rigdon joined him. Sidney Rigdon want ed to continue the communism that the Sandemanians had. Alexander Campbell wanted to continue the nomenclature of the Scot ch Baptists in regards to the week ly collection which they called \"the Fellowship\" but wasn't interested in the communism. 33 It is at this point that, the influence of the occultic-originated Commun es of Owens, Fourier, George Rapp and others also played a part. These communal experiments had all failed, but individuals still loyal to their ideas found Ri gdon's communal ideas co mpatible. Alexander Campbell not only allied his church temporaril y with the Unitarians, 34 but allowed Universalists and Masons to join his movement. Alexa nder Campbell later regreted doing this. 35 People with these types of background found their way into tw o commune towns that Ri gdon set up, and later handed over to Joseph Smith. John Cook Benne tt, who was a Mason as a Cambellite, later became the mayor of the Morm on town of Navoo. (He was e xpelled from the Mormon church on May 11, 1842 and moved to Pittsburg, PA.) 36 Rigdon joined the Freem asons. He also was the major factor in taking Joseph Sm ith from being a prophet without a church to a prophet with an organized church of two communes. Rigdon's congr egations at Kirkland gave Joseph Smith the"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"nucleus of his Mormon community. To this came in such new converts as the followers of the millenialist and communist Bernhart Mueller (aka Count de Leon) whose followers had left George Rapp's faile d Economy commune. 37 These people were expec ting the \"Lion of Judah\" would reveal himself for the constitution of his divine Kingdom. One of the practices of the Scot Baptists of going to the theatr e and dances and other worldly amusements, which were commonly condemned by most respectable Christian denominations in those times, seems to have carried over into modern Mormonism through Sidney Rigdon and other ex- Disciples of Christ Mormons. 38 Horace Greeley, a Fourie rist, an Illuminatus, 39 and editor of the daily New York Tribune, gave Joseph Smith some of his early publicity. In 1842, Horace Greeley publishe d in his paper information on a ll the Fourierist movement's activities, meetings, conventions , and the organization of the first settlement as well as ideological articles. 40 THE BAPTISTS & THE JE HOVAH'S WITNESSES The Mason Rigdon had been associ ated with a fringe Baptist group. The help the Jehovah's Witnesses received was from a very c onventional mainstream Baptist church. In 1893, the Columbian Exposition in Chica go cut railroad rates dow n to about a penny per mile, a quarter of their normal rate s. This prompted the Internati onal Bible Students to have their first national assembly. 41 Five days of meeting were held, and what denomination helped them out? The Baptists. 360 Jehovah's Witnesses, then know n as Bible Students, were in attendence. The JW audience watched in the Calvary Baptist Church while th e Bible Students baptized 70 converts in the Baptist baptismal facilities. 42 Baptist churches also opened up and allo wed C.T. Russell to preach in them. THE BAPTISTS & THE NEW AGE Will the Masons who are Baptists pr otect their flock from the New Age? In answering this, this Author is reminded of how one evening his wi fe was remarking how the Baptist Senator Mark Hatfie ld was being shown on television. The news was about a Masonic gathering for the Senator. 43 Yes, this prominent Baptist Sena tor, and there are other Baptist Senators who also are or have been Masons, is a 32 degree Freemason. This Author has it from first hand sources that the Senator attends mee tings with witches and other New Age activities. This is just one of many Baptist Mas ons who are involved with the New Age. The Masonic influence seems to be the best explanation for the seepage of New Age propoganda into the Baptist churches. The ancient Hindu occult symbol the Ennegram was introduced and promoted in the U.S. by the representative of The Mother . The Mother is the leader of the New Age community at Auroville, India. Maurice and Hanna Strong, w ho have connections to the Order, to the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds are the leader s in the U.S. promoting the Mother. Each year, her disciples make pilgrimages back to Auroville for an international meeting. 44 The ennegram has spread into many areas of Christendom— but its use is no accident, it has been promoted. Nor has the heavily Masonic Baptist leadership prevented its use by Baptist leadership. Shirley Ann Miller, an ex-occultist who became a Chri stian writes, \"No one really knows where the enneagram came from but it is believed to have originated around the 14th or 15th Century by mystics called the Sufis and the Jesuits.\" 45 Whatever a person believes is its pagan origin, it is now being promoted by Catholic Ch arismatics, mystics, New Ager s, and uninformed Christians."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"The Southern Baptist chur ches have been inviting the New Age author M. Scott Peak, an open promoter of Zen Buddhism, to speak to thei r congregations. Zen Buddhism, as the reader remembers, has no person al God, but does have plenty of me ditation and works, and expects the individual to find his own salvation. 46 \"Recently in The Baptist Stand, the most wide ly distributed Baptist publication in the state of Texas, a top official of the Southern Baptis t Convention suggested that Baptist churches did not have to worry about losing members to New Age Churches since, There are no New Age churches.' \" 47 In a perverse way, there is tiny element of trut h in that, some Baptist churches don't need to fear losing their members to New Age chur ches because THEY AR E NEW AGE CHURCHES. For instance, Rodney R. Romney, th e senior minister of the First Baptist Church in Seattle wrote a book, which on the back cover says \"MISSION: To find God. METHOD: By finding one's self.\" Opening the book we find out that \"To unde rstand God is to finally realize one's own godhead.\" Romney advocates using Ea stern Mysticism, Sufism, and T.M. 48 Masons within the leadership of various Christ ian denominations have helped lead the fight against believing the Bible is infallible, for allowing homosexuality, a nd many other liberal unscriptural ideas. One of the Southern Baptist groups that Masons have participated in is the Association of Baptist Professors of Religion. Taylor Clarence (T.C.) Smith was that Associ ation's President and a faculty member of the Furman University, a Baptist school. Smith, who wa s educated in part at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, is well know n for believing the Bible has e rrors, and also that modern scholars should decide what books they want to co nsider as canon. T.C. Sm ith, in a talk which criticized various Baptists for believing in Bible Infallibility a nd which advocated the historical- critical approach to scripture, said it is \"t he Bible, not God, that we are questioning.\" 34 Three other instructors at Furman University of Greenville, S.C. were also known for their attacks against the Bible. The book People of the Covenant was co-authored by the three faculty members Robert Wilson Crapps, Henry Jackson Fl anders, Jr. and David An thony Smith. At least one of these co-authors, if not more, Henry Jackson Fl anders, Jr. is a Freemason. 49 Their book attacks many of the traditional Christian views su ch as Moses' authorsh ip of the Pentateuch, which they \"discern\" Jesus was wrong about. Many of the Seminaries are no w teaching Eastern Mysticism. 50 Baylor University which has been a Baptist Seminary run by the Masons has c ontinued to get more a nd more liberal. Some of the students that are going there are rebelling ag ainst the anti-Christian administration of this so-called Christian seminary. On Labor Day, on Focus On The Family program, students of Baylor Univ. who are trying to fight the anti- Christian administration of Baylor were interviewed. 51 Baylor University has served Masonic goals well, or so says a letter from Sovereign Grand Commander Luther A. Smith, 33°, to Dr. James Wood, professor at Baylor. The Scottish Rite Supreme Council sent a $5,000 check to Bayl or, handed to them by 33° Mason R. Lee Lockwood. Smith, 33°, writes Dr. Wood (perhaps also a Mason), \"T his is another contribution to further the cause of education in the area of church-state separa tion to which Baylor University is making such a fine contribution.\" 52 THE MASONIC INFLUENCE ON THE BAPT ISTS IS NOT ALWAYS BLATANTLY ANTI- CHRISTIAN"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Anything goes in the New Age. An ex-Mason, now a Christian, to ld this Author how he and his wife went to a Masonic lodge for an event that to their surprise turned out to be a wife swapping party. They left disgusted. An examination of pictures of Albert Pike and Henry Clause n, two of the most important Masons of their time, shows them wearing the symbol of Satan. It is hard to picture that devout Christia ns unequally yoked with these things, would not become corrupted. How could they sincerely participate in an organization that promised salvation to men practicing such things. One f eels compelled to believe that high ranking Christian Masons are not sincere Christians. Ind eed, it seems that some of these insincere men are helped into promin ent ecclesiastical positions, and use those positions to subtly ruin Christianity. Once we grasp the possi bility of their insincerity, then it is easier to grasp what they are doing to Christianity, behind the scenes. Ho wever, the specific motivations of these men recide within their hearts. They may even be experiencing blackmail. WHAT KIND OF SEED ARE YOU JESUS ASKED. The fruit from the type of seeds of destruction that are planted by these Mason Christians, are difficult to identify before they fully develop. This is why it is so important to examine ahead of time what is being done. Some Amish have a saying that you can tell how sucessfully a man was a Christian by his grandchildren. (The Author may have not only heard this, but may have read it in Family Life, an Amish periodical by Pathway.) The Amish are experienced in counting the cost of a project or activity. Many practical or sound practices ar e being discarded today, because they are no longer fashionable. The bias to be modern and new is so great it clouds our evaluations. It 's this Author's opinion that some of the progressive types of people who were excited by cars , are now the type of progressives that are telling us how bad car pollution is. Like the headlong rush to use cars, the headlong rush to use computers was done without counting th e cost. MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) discovered in their study of 20 Fortune 500 companies, that productivity had gone down in all of these t op 20 companies with the introd uction and use of computers. \"Sophisticated technology added nothing to overall productivity.\" 53 USA Today (Nov. 16, 1983) in an article \"High-tech can't deliver on jobs\" says, \"Despite the siren appeal of high-tech industries, most new jobs in the USA economy will be created in old -fashioned service and manufacturing fields.\" So great is our bias toward change that our text books and media mi sportray history, for instance, history books and movies report about the German Panzer divisions, but we seldom hear that most of Germany's WW II army units relied on horses for transport. These horses were also valuable as a prime food source for the encircle d German 6th army at Stalingrad. The use of horses doesn't fit our American image of what a \"modern\" army should be using. This American cultural bias toward anything new makes it easier for those intent on introducing new ideas into the Christian churches, to do so wi thout their proper evaluation. When these ideas wash out, we sel dom evaluate what was wrong. The failure of many Christian Ma sons— (this book uses the term Christian loosely—as stated before the term is used as it is commonly used for anyone and anything that even masquerades under that label)— to see their ch ildren maintain any interest in Ch ristianity should be a warning. (This has been observed by this Author and others in the Stat es—Chick publications even has a tract addressing this.) For instance, one of the parents of a Mason family asked this Author,"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"\"I just can't understand why my kids are into drugs, and aren't interested in going to church at all?\" What are the costs to the Chri stian churches of the various pseudo-scriptural ideas that Masons are intoducing into the churches? What are these? Unquestioned Christian support for Israel. That Israel will rebuild the Temple and reintroduce the Temp le sacrifices. That the Jewish rites (blood sacrifices) will be restored. That Ch ristians should not worr y about the One-World- Power, that they will be secretly rapt ured. But aren't th ese Biblical ideas? Before examining if they are Biblical, let us note which denomination has been very instrumental in pushing these ideas — the Sout hern Baptists. The Southern Baptist leadership which was Masonic has pr omoted Masonry to the rank and file. During the 1920s the Southern Baptists joined the Masons by the millions. This had a Christianizing effect, but it also gave good cover for the died-in-wool members of Satanic cults, who used their Baptist membership as a cover. As an example of Baptist doctrine The Ency clopedia of Southern Ba ptists, Vol. IV, states \"The Millenial Kingdom will be predominately Jewish with headquarters in Palestine and Temple worship in Jerusalem.\" 54 Although this Author doesn't want to take the space at this point to show it, the idea that temple blood sacrifices will be restored is completely contrary to the work of Christ, and is actually part of The Plan, the Satanic plan to carry out blood sacrifices in the open. 55 AN EXAMPLE Before examining these ideas, let us look at one good example of a leading Baptist Mason who was very useful in spreading these ideas from the pulpit and radio. His name is Rufus McKinley Dodrill. People in Indianapolis will re member him for several things. Some remember there was a bad spirit in his la rge Broadway church. After his d eath his large Br oadway Church practically vanished.(This is where the importance of the long range conseq uences of our actions can be seen.) Others will remember how he s poke over the radio for 37 years, much of it om prophecy. Others will remember how most of th e Baptist churches in th at area were spin-offs from Dodrill's Broadway Baptist Church. Dodrill wrote about the Secret Rapture in his book Keep Your Eye on the Sky The Key to Prophecy which was published in 1972. He provides a big chart of his Dispensational Premillenial overview of history in the book's back. On page 31 he states, \"When Billy Graham will have finished his last evangelistic ca mpaign, he will have preached the Gospel to every nation.\" 56 A little further on p. 42 one reads th at he is fully aware many scri ptures contradict his Secret Rapture theory. \"As I have studied prophecy over the years I was struck by apparent contradictions...How could Jesus co me as a thief in the night a nd yet at the same time on the clouds of great glory and every eye see him?\" He finds the key to this contradiction (which to him proves an invisible rapture) is that a certai n week in Daniel's prophecy \"was postponed till the end of the Church Age.\" He sees the figure of 144,000 as litera l Jewish evangelists and that the Jewish Kingdom of David will be restored. That the man was a Mas on, doesn't mean his doctrines are necessarily wrong. But it is important for Christian to go ba ck and unravel who has been teaching us some of these doctrines and wher e they originated. It is especially critical to our study of the One-World-Religion because th e Secret Pre-Trib rapture theory has almost wiped out Christian oppostition to the One-World-Powe r. Upset Christians have confronted this Author, \"Why are you bothering about this, we ar e going to be raptured. God is not going to allow us to suffer.\""},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"ARE THESE IDEAS BIBLICAL? The Pre-Trib rapture theory has b een discredited by Theologians, and has fallen into disrepute in recent years with Bible schol ars. Even so, it comes as a s hock to many to hear that the teaching is not in the Bible. (This isn't to say that no one claims it comes from the Bible. As this is a historical expose, not a doctrinal dissertation, the reader is encouraged to examine the Secret Rapture and why it is not Biblical from other sources.) The Encyclopedia of American Religions by J. Gordon Melton st ates that the Rapture idea started with Margaret McDonald in 1830. For 18 centuries, Christians had believed in what is called today the Post-Trib Rapture—that is that when Christ returned they would be caught up with him. This is what 1 Thes 4:13-18 clearly indicates. However, severa l Protestant groups in Ireland, Scotland and England with Jesuit ties began preaching a secret Rapt ure after Margaret's visions. A confluence of two sources, a Sc ottish lady Margaret McDonald with her visions, and the Irvingites, helped influence Dar by to adopt the Raptur e theory. The first s ource was a channeler or spirit medium, and the second source, the Irvi ngites, received their teaching from a \"Rabbi Ben Ezra\" which was the pen-name of a Jesuit Emanua l Lacunza (pronounced Lacuntha)(1731- 1801) of Spanish heritage. Margaret McDonald lived near Gl asgow, Scotland at Port Glasgo w. A brilliant Englishman Dr. Robert Norton was an actual witness of what Margaret had spoken duri ng her visions, and had also received her own written accounts of ever ything. Her first vision was Feb. 1, 1830. Her visions that the Christia ns would be raptured se perately before Christ would return came in the spring of 1830. Norton cleared the air with his rare book The Restor ation of Apostles and Prophets; In the Catholic Apostolic Church in 18 61. This book tells the story of how Margaret's visions started the Rapture belief. The Irishman John Darby, Robert Norton, and a number of Irvingites, and many others came to Margaret's house to hear he r visions. Edward Irving (an ex-Sc ottish Presbyterian) wrote in a letter \"The substance of Mary Campbell's and Ma rgaret Macdonald's visions or re velations, given in their papers, carry to me a spiritual conviction and a spir itual reproof which I cannot express.\" 57 It did not take Irving l ong after Margaret's vision s to first begin to preac h the Rapture. He also then translated the work of La cunza, knowing full well that it wa s the work of a Jesuit priest. The earliest mention of the Pre-Trib Rapture by this minister, who had been preaching during the 1820s, was in a letter wri tten soon after July 6,1830. 58 The Plymouth Brethr en, even before Darby's influence, had heard in Plymouth, Engl and in 1831, a sermon on the Pre-Trib rapture by Captain Percy Hall. 59 Two lawyers Darby and Schofield pr omoted the Raptur e theory in the U.S. Darby made trips across the U.S. during th e 1860s and 1870s promotin g the Rapture. Darby himself had some tainted connections during this time period. In Dublin, Ireland, in the Brethren assembly seven leaders were chosen, and Edward Cronin was one of these. Edward Cronin was an ex-Cat holic who preached the masonic slogan \"liberty, equality, and fraternity.\" He was in to a type of mystic Christia n belief system. These Brethren churches were part of the Tractarian movement supported secretly by the Jesuits, and to which Darby joined himself to in 1827. 60 Darby also spent time with Irvingites and Tractarians in meetings at Lady Powerscourt's castle in 1833."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"In England, The Oxford Movement, a secret Je suit program to destroy Protestantism published tracts promoting the Rapture.

Later, Baxter declared that the messages he had rece ived although supernatur al, had come from Satan. 61 Since that time a interesting host of religious leaders have promoted the Secret Pre-Trib Rapture, Herbert Armstrong, Oral Roberts, Seiss (one originator of Pyramid prophecy ideas), Hal Lindsey, and the 33° Mason and Southern Baptist Billy Graham. SIX QUESTIONS TO GET US THINKING 1. Why is it that died-in-the-wool communist leaders like Billy Graham? 2. Why is it that the Pope and the Catholic church gave Billy Gra ham his doctorate (yes, his doctorate is honorary)? 3. Why is it that Billy Graham is on reco rd advocating that if the Ten Commandments can't be read in the pu blic schools then communist Chai rman Mao-Tse-tung's principles should be taught? 62 4. Why is it that Billy Graham is on record several times saying in speeches that the Catholic Church pr eaches the gospel? 63 5. Why is it that Billy Graham doesn't belie ve in hell, but believe s in Armageddon, yet both ideas are in the book of Revelation? 64 6. Why does Billy Graham support a One-world-gove rnment one-world-church? 65 THE NEW WORLD ORDER CREATES BILLY GRAHAM The meteoric rise to prominence, that Billy Graham experie nce resembles other Masons who have had their careers made for them by the New World Order. Billy Graham made his first confession of fa ith under the Evangelis t Mordecai Ham. It appears Billy Graham has be en a Mason since the 1940s. His rise to fame started in Los Angeles. In 1949, his first Lo s Angeles Crusade was launched. Notable Holywood entertainers attend ed such as Stewart Hamlin. William Randolph Hearst, head of the large Hearst ne wspaper chain, direct ed all his newspaper editors to give Graham wide coverage with the command, \"Puff Graham\". Hearst's newspaper chai n is loudly touted as being a non-Jewish a ffair. Dilling reported in 1940 that the general manager of Hearst papers was the Jew J.D. Gortatowsky. Chairman of the executive committee of Hearst Enterprises Inc. was Jew Solomon Solis Carvalho. Hearst's Boston pu blisher was Jew Carl Dreyfuss , managing editor of Hearst's NY American was Jew Arthur G. Newmyer. Hearst's Int. Ne ws Service (pres. and gnrl. mgr.) was Jew Moses Koenigsberg. Circulatio n director of all the Hearst papers and magazines, and a member of Hearst exec. council befo re going to prison was Jew Moe Annenberg. The list of Jews in the top leader ship of Hearst newspaper chain could go on. The reader should be getting the picture. Following Hearst's newspaper chain's lead, the national news medi a gave Graham wide coverage in magazi nes and newspapers."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Since that first publicity, the Jewish press, Jewish religious leader s, the Federal Council of Churches of Christ, the World Council of Churches and others have been bragging on Billy Graham. For instance, \"Dr. G. P aul Musselman, Executive Director of the Department of Evangelism of the National Counc il of Churches, spoke in warm terms about the work of evangelist Billy Graham...'I call Billy Graham the...greatest of the ecumenical voices,'...\" 66 The New Order Power has spent an enormous amount of energ y, time and money to build up Graham's image. And Billy Graham has stayed away from controversy. Because Graham had connections to the New World Order, t hey got him booked in the communist countries. This seems more ev ident when we read Graham's Mason friend Robert Schuler's explanation for why Sc huler was allowed into Russia to preach. The Mason Robert Schuler explained his succ ess in becoming the first teleevangelist to be on Soviet T.V. as both a combination of 1. having friends like Armand Hammer and 2. because his approach would not be sect arian nor evangelistic, but would be a message of \"possibility thinking.\" 67 For those not aware, the late Armand Ha mmer was close to the center of the New World Order's center of power, and was a go between the World Order and their men who ruled in the Kremlin. According to report s, Hammer brought instructions each time as to who was to rule the U.S.S.R. each time there was a change. Hammer was a friend of the Mountbattans and the Ro thschilds. (See chap. 3.3.) Graham has been very close to all the Presidents since Eisenhower. All of these Presidents have been handpicked by the New World Order as acceptable. (See Appendix for their connections to the New Order). Altho ugh Nixon knew that G raham was in favor of his Presidency, Nixon told him not to pub licly endorse him, \"Your ministry is more important than my getting elected President.\" Why would Nixon, who worked for Rockefeller, view Graham's ministry as more important than for Ni xon being President? Nixon is not really that religious. I believe Nixo n meant it more in the sense that Graham's ministry is more important to the New Order than Nixon's presidency. Certainly, Nixon wasn't concerned about Christ. WHY THE NEW WORLD ORDE R CREATED BILLY GRAHAM The New World Order doesn't feel they c an fail when they can create men like Billy Graham. The New World Order has made him t he most respected m an in America. And he is their man consciously working for them. If he lives long enough he will be one of their most powerful assets to bring in a false Christ. Adam Weishaupt, organizer of the Bavarian llluminati, said in German, \"The most admirable thing of all is that great Protes tant and reformed theologians who belong to our Order really believe they see in it the true and genuine mind of the Christian religion. Oh! man, what can't you be brought to believe!\" 68 The great evangelist Charles Finney left the Masonic Lodge when he dedicated his life to God. The evangelist Finney spent his life warning Christ ians about Freemasonry. He declared that Masons in the higher levels have lost their conscien ces because they have seared their consciences so much. 69 It's seems almost rediculous to imagine this great evangelist groped blindfolded in some lodge and declared he was in need of light to the \"worshipful\" Masonic Lodge Master. But that is what Billy Graham did."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Again, when we ask ourselves how is it that a Christian evangelist could be part of the New World Order's team, we need to stop a nd remind ourselves that Co-Mason, New Age leader, and Theosophical Society President Alice Bailey in her book Externalisation of the Hierarchy teaches that \"The three main channels through which the preparation for the new age is going on might be regarded as the Church, the Masonic Fraternity and the educational field.\" (Externalisation of the Hierarchy, p.511, see Chapter 1.1 for the photocopy documenting it.) The Jehovah's Witnesses' Watchtower and Aw ake! magazines in the 1950s began to report on Billy Graham's crusades. Billy Graham's message about Armageddon and the Millenium is so similar to to the Watchtower So ciety's, that they like to quote him. Billy Graham has been warning that \"many experts project that man will not live to see 2000. \" 70 The ultimate goal of Freemasonry and t hose bringing us a One-World-religion is power. Their program has been to infiltrate leadership and recruit the clergy whenever possible. Consequent ly, you will not hear Billy Graham warn you about Freemasons. 33rd degree Mason Billy Graham does tell us that a Ne w Age is coming. His tract is titled—\"A New Age Is Coming\"- is suggestive of the Ne w Age of Aquarius, havi ng a rainbow on the tract's cover. However, the in side declares the New Age to be a Bible concept. The inside is about a Millenium and an Armageddon that Graham believes will soon be here. Brad Steiger is a New Age leader si nce 1957 when he wrote an article on reincarnation. Since then he has written hundreds of books on a ll types of New Age subjects, including cha nneling and magic. When interviewed and aske d to define the New Age, Steiger apparently is remembering and quoting Gra ham's New Age tract or a similar type of tract to prove that the New Age is Christian. \"All my lif e I have tried to resist being labeled. I know that when I was in the evang elical-fundamentalist school as a child, we were told there was a New Age coming, t hat that was something that Jesus had promised. Now that I am a mature author, certain people say I am in the New Age movement, so I am on the side of Satan. I am very confused. Is the New Age a part of Jesus, or a part of Satan? I recently sa w a little tract printed by an extremely fundamentalist church: It was called \"A New Age Dawning\" and had a big rainbow on the cover. But you also have Constance Cumbey, a fundamentalist, writing an attack on the New Age called The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow.\" 71 When Billy Graham was in Moscow's Baptist Church, he held out in his prayer with them the idea that the National Council of Churches were a important positive Christian group. He prayed for the NCC to his audience, \"out of this meeting [NCC's] there may come a great message to the Christian world. \" NCC people were not slack in getting this quote, and it came out in th e Official NCC news release. 72 Graham is supportive of the WCC, which in turn is supportive of a One-World- Government. (See chapter 2.7) Almost every issue of the New Age M agazine (the name was recently changed to Scottish Rite Journal and then after two years it has again this year, 1991, been changed back to its original title New Age Magazine) has an article that makes a big production that this country was foun ded by Masons. Although neither Washington, Jefferson, nor Franklin were Christians, Christians like to believe this.(See chapter 3.4) Paul L Boiler in his book George Washington & Religion put an end to all such myth and nonsence. After his book it is impossible to identify the adult Washington in any positive way as"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Christian. One of the nice sm okescreens that Masons like to use ad nauseum is that George Washington was a Ch ristian and the Father of this country and a Mason, therefore Masonry can not be evil. Billy Graham, perpet uating this myth, went to Valley Forge to the spot Washington supposedly pray ed in the snow, and Gr aham knelt in Valley Forge to \"remind\" us of this. Likewise, Billy Graham's membership in the Lod ge is held out to Ma sons as proof that Masonry is a Christian organiz ation. Robert Morey, who actu ally examined the Scottish Rite's file on 33° Freemason Billy Graham, 73 refers to Billy Graha m on page 11 of his recent book The History of Fr eemasonry. \"Since most Maso ns in the U.S. are members of Christian Churches and many clergymen belong to the Frat ernity, the idea that they are all involved in some kind of devil cult is absurd. Can anyone seriously think that such 33rd degree Masons as Senator Jesse Helms, the Christ ian champion of conservative politics, is a worshipper of Lucifer? Or, that one of the most well known evangelists in the world is a Luciferian because he is a 33rd degree Mason?\" Well Dr. Morey if I believe the Scriptures th en I can answer yes to that question. The Scriptures say that Sata n will not appear as ev il, but as an angel of light and will deceive many. The Scripture warn that \"in the last da ys perilous times shall come\" as \"evil men and seducers shall wax worse and wo rse, deceiving and being deceived.\" But some will argue isn't Bill y Graham seducing men to come to Christ? In 1957, in Billy Graham's New York Crusade the largest numb er of decision card s (that is the cards filled out by Graham's counselors to people who come forward) were sent to 33° Mason Norman Vincent Peale's Ma rble Collegiate Church. 74 That was 373 people. Also 135 decision cards were directed to the liberal Riverside Ch urch where Dr. Robert J. McCracken is minister. McCrac ken is what Christians call an infidel, he renounces the atonement, the resurrection, and the Virgin Birth. Rep eatedly from newspapers, magazines, and counselors at the Crusades come the report s that Catholics who come forward for Christ at Billy Gr aham's Crusades are directed to join the Catholic Church. This has been a long standing policy. In 1957, Billy Grah am said, \"Anyone who makes a decision at our meetings is referred to a local clergyman, Prot estant, Catholic, or Jewish.\" How many Christians at the grass roots who volunteerly do much of the work to make a Billy Graham Crusade possible, know that the people who co me forward if they are Jewish will be directed to a synagogue? It may not happen in all cases, but it is happening. The Jewish author Gerald S. Strober in hi s book American Jews Community in Crisis, p. 110 states that after a re solution in Feb. 1973 at Pittsburgh by the NCC failed to declare the NCC a gainst converting the Jews, that Billy Graham announced the following day a statement that God ha d a special place for the Je ws and rejected \"coercive evangelistic efforts.\" Privately, Graham ha s assured Jewish leaders he is against converting the Jews to Christianity. Strober al so informs his readers (p. 111) that many Christian organizati ons that are \"Jewish Mi ssions\" take their marc hing orders from Billy Graham. This confirms numerous reports by Christians that many Jewish Missions are designed to simply fleece the Ch ristians, and that they pad thei r figures of converts to get more financial support while pretending to co nvert Jews. Christians should investigate what their money is actually going to. This idea that we as Christ ians should look at all the great things Billy Graham has done is unscriptural. Christ sa id the least on earth will be the greatest in heaven. Christ"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"said if you've been rewarde d here on earth you don't need a reward in heaven for you've already been paid. The many books and publicit y praising Graham in every possible way, including calling him a prophet, have given Billy Graham his reward. Most of his works are not so wonderful, as already stated, the ma jority of people who come forward at many of these crusades are not directed to sound churches, but to New Age churches, etc. People are excusing and justifying their Maso nic memberships by th inking if the greatest Christian is a Mason then it must be a good organization. New Christians also look at Graham as the supreme role model. They think if the greatest Christian is a millionaire, then that is a good role model. They really have no excuse for su ch perverted thinking because Jesus is our role m odel. But how good is Graham as a role model, when people are starving world-wide and he lives the life of the millionai re with rich food, hob-nobbing with the elite, playing golf, etc. When G raham's works are examined they will be burned up, while some old widow who nobody has give n any attention to is going to receive many golden crowns in heaven. Jesus' words will then come tr ue, that the least on earth shall be the greatest in heaven. But it may be argued, Billy Graham doesn't wa ter down the message of salvation. And he has talked to more people abou t Christ than anyone else, and look how many are making decisions for Christ? But Billy Graham does water do wn the message of Christ in many ways. All put one of B illy Graham's children have rece ived an infant baptism with a sprinkled baptism. 75 Supposedly, Baptists are strong on baptism on confe ssion of faith and reject infant baptism. Not Billy Graham. Interestingly, a well-resear ched article on Billy Graham in the Journal of Church and State concludes in examining Billy Grahams interaction with the various Presidents, \"...could Graham speak the w ord of truth - especially when that word may be critical or slashing - to the man in the White House wh en he is on such friendly terms with him? On the basis of the evidence now available, the answer must be no.\" 76 JUST HOW DOES GRAHAM MA TCH UP TO SCRIPTURE? \"Each of us has his reference point and, for me as a Christian, the reference point by which I measure my life and thought is the Bibl e, the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments.\"—Billy Graham I would like to remind Billy Graham that Chri st did nothing in secret, especially not the mystery religion of Masonry. No man is above being rebuk ed by the Word of God. T he Apostle Peter who was so instrumental on the day of Pent ecost and in the e arly church was rebuked by Paul to his face. (Gal. 2:11-14) Billy Graham claims to me asure his life by the Bible. \"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they be of God; because many false prophets are gone into the world.\" 1 Jn 4:1 The Bible says try the spirits. Billy Graham has been active in Freemasonry and helpful to the W CC. It is obvious by the friends and groups he supports that he does not try the spirits to see if they are from God."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"\"Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them wh ich cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine wh ich ye have learned: and avoid them.\" Rom. 16:17 The Bible says to mark those with false doctrines. But Graham praises and compliments the wors t kinds of heretics, such as Dr. E. Stanley Jones (author of a book on Gandhi), Methodist Bi shop Gerald Ke nnedy (the 1963 LA. Crusade chairman and whom Graham praised as, \"Bishop Kennedy is one of the ten greatest Christian preac hers in America.\" The tract \"Why We Cannot Support The Billy Graham CRUSADE\" outlines beautifully what the scriptures say we are to do with heretics. REBUKE THEM-Titus 1:13 HAVE NO FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM- Eph 5:11 WITHDRAW YOURSELF FROM WITH THESE TYPES- II Thess 3:6 FROM SUCH TURN AWAY- II Tim 3:5,8 RECEIVE THEM NOT- II Jn 10, 11 REJECT HERETICS- Titus 3:10 BE YE SEPARATE- II Cor 6:17 Billy Graham fails on each of these point s. Dr. Robert J. Mc Cracken head of the Riverside Church and an infidel was the man G raham wanted on the pl atform to lead in prayer in the 1957 NY Crusade. Over and ov er again men like this have played key roles in Graham's Crusades. If Graham did not call on his Masonic buddies to help out in his crusades, perhaps mo re people would re alize that Catholics that make decisions are sent to Catholic churches, Jews are sent to the Rabbis, and many weak Christians are directed to New Age \"Christian\" churches. Of the 1,300 Catholics that came forward at the San Francisco Crusade \"practically all remained Catholic.\" (Swo rd of the Lord, 7/2/64) Joe Kennedy, the liberal minister and chairm an of a prominent NCC committee was placed in charge of G raham's new converts in 1958. 77 His Co-chairman of his Advisory Committ ee for his St. Louis Crusade in 1973 was Arthur Lee Malory (32° and deac on in a So. Bapt. Church). Before the 1972 Paris Billy Graham Crusade the Press was informed that people coming forward \"requesting reaffi rmation to the Catholic fait h would be turned over to the Catholic Church.\" 78 Flyers from Billy Graham's Crusades indicate that co nverts are being sent to Catholic churches. Billy Graham gave assurances to Jewish l eaders that he didn't feel they needed to be converted because God had a specia l plan for the Jews. In line with this Jews that come forward in Crusades are direc ted to synagogues. Billy G raham is pro-Jewish. When a resolution in Feb. 1973 at the National Counc il of Churches at Pitts burgh, failed to declare the NCC against converting the Jews to Christianity, Billy Graham announced the following day that the Jews are a special group and called on Chri stians to reject \"coercive evangelistic efforts.\" 79 Billy Graham has used particular worldly entertainers repeatedly in his Crusades. 80 Pat Boone, a \"charismatic\" continued to play in Playboy type clubs and night clubs, while Graham used him to sing at his Crusades. Pat Boone was given a special position by the State of Israel, and is very pro-Jewish. He was involved the Nugen Hand Bank scandal which was a CIA creat ed bank. His daughter Debbie Boone made a hit song \"You Light up My Life\"; the words of the song were written by woman who worshipped Lucifer and wrote the song to Lucifer. Christ warned us to beware when all men spok e good of us, and to realize that it is harder for a camel to go through t he eye of a needle than a.... The simple meaning of his"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"words should not be lost in all the wealth and the mansion that is part of an evangelist's life. Finally, if we want to get blunt about i t, Billy Graham, your w orship of Lucifer is unscriptural. For the reader's edification, let us review how the upper levels of Satanism operate. The llluminati requires its people to have a cov er, preferably a cover identity that is very respected. In order to keep their Satanic pow er, as Satanists rise through the ranks of Satanism, they must maintain a balance between their good deeds and their evil. If this balance is lost, they lose their power and in the hi ghly competitive llluminati are destroyed. This is why some of the leading llluminati are some of the most respected and leading philanthropists. Let us take an example. Was Jimmy Carter a. a Christian, b. a Satanist, or c. both ? This Author would say both. Jimmy Carter came from a family involved in Satanism. His sister was the highest witch in North America. His brother B illy is famous for his friendship with Quaddafi. Jimmy Carter was programmed by the Ta vistock Institute. Tavisto ck Institute pyschologist Dr. Peter Bourne picked Carter for President because he had undergone \"an intensive brainwashing program administered by Admiral Hyman Rickover at Annapolis.\"(Mullins, The World Order, p. 192) Tavistock also maintains two schools at the Rothschild's old haunt Frankfurt, Germany. Through programming the llluminati are able to create multiple personalities. These people can have some personalities that serve God, and others that are Satanic. The various personalities are called alters. While on the llluminati's top Council of 13 before turning his life over to Christ, Johnny Todd got a memo from the Rothschilds (the Satanic headquarters) telling him that Jimmy Carter was totally reliable for the Satanists. Todd also has revealed that Carter is a Mason and part of the llluminati. Knowing then how Satanism w orks, we would expect that a high ranking Satanist would have to have the respectibility that Billy Gr aham has. That is the way they operate. It is also quite normal for these people to have respectible covers and multiple personalities. WHAT ABOUT THE GOOD BILLY GRAHAM DOES. God does work good through all circumstances, and can exercise His will in spite of Satan. Christians recognize t hat He created Satan, and certainly know s how Satan thinks. Some readers may wonder whether it isn't just as well to allow Bill y Graham to continue his crusades, even though behind the scenes he might be something else. This Author would like to sugges t that Christians reevalute what is really happening at the Crusades. Marshall Frady has written perhaps the best book making an attempt to present the real picture of Billy Graham behi nd the myth. His book is Billy Graham. A Parable of American Righteousness. Boston: Little Brown and Co., 1979. One Christian commented that if every Christian read Frady 's book Graham would lose his support. Frady covers the NY Crusade on pages 291-315. The details are especially enlightening in terms of Be Wise As Serpent's res earch. The original patronage to have the crusade came from people like the Vanderbilts, Goulds and Whitneys. To oversee the NY Crusade an executive committee was estab lished with names that could come from a Who Who of the New World Or der if such a book existed. The committee chairman was"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Ragen Hull president of Mutual Life of NY . The committee included Chase Manhattan bank's president George Champi on, 33° Mason Norman Vincent Peale, and millionaire William Randolph Hearst, Jr. (pp 292-93). Millio ns were spent on the Crusade from money Christians and Churches donated. E normous volunteer time and energy were put into building everything up for the moment Graham would speak. 650 billboards announced Billy Graham along with 40,000 bumper stickers. Although the Crusade was billed as designed to save \"Sodom\" New York, 7,500 of the Garden's seats went to Christians bussed in from a ll over the U.S. 11,200 seats in all were given to distant delegations, guest ministers, the crusade staff of counsel ors, ushers, and choir. Only 7,800 seats were available for New Yorkers. Most of t he New Yorkers who did go were church members. Most of the decisions were made by Christians for minor backsliding. Of the people who went f orward 64% were referred to ch urches they w ere already members of, and almost all the other 36% did not join where they were referred. Graham himself admitted that 40 to 70 percent of the decision cards were from people of sponsoring churches and almo st all the rest were from people who had been members of non-sponsoring churches. Frady concludes from the various studi es and figures that Graham's NY Crusade did little for the unsave d of NY, but did revit alize Christians who attended somewhat. (It also netted the Billy Graham C rusade many extr a millions.) Observors of the crusade des cribed the coversions as popcorn conversions. All over the stadium comes a pop! pop! as people puff and bloom into weightless Christians, (p. 307) One minister who observed the NY Crusade said, \"My greatest misgivings about Graham is his apparent conviction that a kind of intramural revival within the church serves just as well as a true sweeping revival out in the world. Fo r that reason, I don't think he's ever going to reach the truly lost, the truly destitute and despised and unreconciled of the earth. With him, it's more an inside-the-sanctuary production --a matter of housekeeping with in the faith.\" (p. 311) BILLY GRAHAM'S MASONIC MEMBERSHIP STICKS OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB TO THOSE FAMILIAR WI TH FREEMASONRY. Graham pals around with other Mason clergymen. In his book s, if he refers to people it is typically someone who is a Mason. His masoni c membership sticks out like a sore thumb to those familiar with masonry. Christ rubbed shoulders with all types. But he didn't legitimatize them like Billy Graham has. Billy Graham commented once concerning hi s friendships, \"I make every effort not to let it appear that I favor one party over anothe r. I count Secretary Dulles a friend, but Senator Humphrey is also a good friend of mine, [who he met]...when we were both swimming in the nude at the YMCA pool in Minneapolis wher e he was running for mayor.\" Allan Dulles was especially an important player for the New Wo rld Order and Senator Humphrey has been very connected too. R epeatedly, these are the people Billy Graham spends his time with doing v arious recreational activities. Much more can be said along this line, including his subtle support for his fellow Masons ' political campaigns, such as Sen. Jesse Helms."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"One particular Christian close to Billy Graham spent time in an eastern city in a hotel room with Billy Graham talking about the conspi racy. After spending 18 hours in this hotel room discussing the New World Order, Billy Graham is reported to have said, \"I am a captive of this organization.\" It is a standard tact ic of the llluminati, their New World Order and its various branches to use fear and blackmail to bring people into line. This is what separates those who lo ve Christ, and those who esteem other th ings first. Those who try to save their lives will lose their lives, and those who lose their lives for Christ's sake will be the ones who really save their lives—this is taught in Mt 16:25, Mk 8:35, Lk 9:24, 17:33, and Jn 12:25. THE AUTHORITY ISSUE The issue here is not doctrine, but authority. The issue involves a false authority that has immense power, and has deluded many people. Billy Graham has been consciously helping the Power to set up its one-world-religion (more about this and his participation later). The Masons have been creating a hurricane—a concentration of power; like the vortex of water going down your drain— power is being concentrated. This power has a plan. Their plan is frightening. It is like Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxl ey's Brave New World, and H.G. Well's The Shape of Things To Come, New World Order, A Moder n Utopia, etc. For myself, no matter how nice men seem, if they are contri buting secretly or openly to an agenda to enslave me and my posterity, then I wi ll not support them nor their programs. An old letter written on July 3, 1855 to a Baptist minister in this area from a Baptist Reverend Ezra Fisher (in New England) sticks in my mind. The letter describes the Baptist minister Boyakin, who was the firs t Baptist minister in Port land, OR and an arch- Mason, \"Brother Boyaki n...is popular with his church and the world.\" 81 The words are somewhat haunting, wh en one thinks of Jesu s' words, \"Woe to you when all men speak well of you...\" (Lk 6:26) The Masonic influence has alwa ys been strong within the Baptist minist ry in this area. A minister who tried to raise t he issue of Masonry in a minist ers conference in June, 1909 was silenced by the group. The event that ha d spurred W.M. Wyatt to try to raise the issue was that Portland's First Baptist mi nister W. Brougher, a Mason, had invited his Masonic Order to his church the previ ous Sunday and preached a sermon \"Baptists and Masons\". In the sermon, he had declared th at the two groups believed the same. An exact quote is that they were \"one in their fundamental doc trines.\" (This Author wonders if Brougher considered Christ's atonement an d salvation as fundamental doctrines.) This was not the first time this type of thi ng had happened in the area. In July, 1904 the Baptist evangelist Ray Palmer, a Mason, had sp oke positively of the Masonic Order which was the topic of his sermon. 82 One Pietist Baptist Temple in the area, apparently Masonicly connected, placed the Knights Temp lar logo on the side of their church in 1919. Whether a denomination or a man meets Daniel Webster's dictionary definition of a Christian or not is not important. Daniel Webster is not going to be their judge on"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"judgement day. Some of Billy Graham's clos e masonic clergy fri ends mock the idea of God being a judge. The Mason G. Bromley Ox nam, friend of Graham s, leader of the Fed.C.C.C. (see chap. 2.4), in his book Preaching in a Revolu tionary Age mocks the concept of a judgement by calling a Go d who would judge sin a \"dirty bully.\" 83 Definitions such as Webster's or Oxnam's w ill not be the issue at judgement, but what is acceptable and righteous in God's sight. Any one is free in this country to practice whatever religion he want s, and to call himself a Christi an. That the Constitution gives this \"right\" does not make it right to practice anything. The Constituti on is not the standard God Yahweh judges by to det ermine whether something is pl easing to him or not. He has given his word, and standards to ma nkind in his inspired Scriptures. CONDEMNED BY THEIR OWN WORDS Many in the Conspiracy have hidden t heir involvement behind nebulus statements against the anti-Christian forces. Some have even spelled out their agenda in reverse. For instance, the Mafia owned major shares in the producer of the Godfather movie. The Mafia made millions over a mo vie supposedly exposing them. In Billy Graham's book A pproaching Hoofbeats The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, chapter seven, the reader is told of the in filtration by the One-World-Power into the church. Who wrote chapter sev en, called \"The White Horse an d Its Rider\" is not clear, the reader should be alerted that major Chri stian publishers write books and affix with approval the names of big Christian authors. 84 Billy Graham also says on page ix that \"Without the help of a few of my associates an d friends I could not have written this book. We should say it is 'our' book.\" Interestingly, whoever wrote it gives a good warning about the Power's deception within the church. First, Mt 24:24, 2 Thes 2:9, 2 Cor 11:14, and Gen 3:13 are quot ed. These scriptures are all good warnings to Christians that it will be diffi cult for Christians to recognize deceivers, because the deceivers will perf orm so many signs, miracles and wonders. Then it is pointed out that Satan comes as an angel of light, and cunningly conceals his real intents. 2 Tim 3:13 is quoted, \"Evil men and imposters will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.\" (It seems like Jesus left the embezzler Juda s with the money bag, and the church has left advice against the Power to o ne of the Power's primary men.) The chapter continues, \"The Bible teache s that there will be more and more false teachers, prophets and even false religious co nferences in the churc h as the age draws toward its end. As the apostle Peter said, T here will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. In their greed these teac hers will exploit you with stories they have made up...\" Note, that some of Graham's teachings have denied the dominion of the Sovereign Lord and made Christ a subjective truth only. Billy Graham's book continues, \"Satan does no t want to build a church and call it \"The First Church of Satan\". He is far too clev er for that. He invades the Sunday School, the"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"youth department, the Christian education program, the pulpit and the seminary classroom. \"The apostle Paul warned t hat many will follow false teac hers, not knowing that in feeding upon what these people say they are taking the devil' s poison into their own lives. Thousands of uninstructed Christians are being deceived today. False teachers use high-sounding words that seem like the height of logic, scholarship and culture. They are intellectually clever and cr afty in their sophistry...\" 85 Lord, we have allowed ourselves to be dece ived. We humbly confess \"The White Horse and its Rider\" chapter is correct, we have a llowed great men to deceive us. We pray for forgiveness for Billy Graham. If he would simply stop his cooperation with this evil Power, it would gratify us. Lord, we pr ay that your church will resist being fa talistic toward the Power that plans to enslave mankind, and wake up to th eir manipulation by the Power. 1.

Nov. 1972. \"Much broader in scope than the WCC\"? The WCC is as broad as can be, it already has anti-Christian groups. There are but two wa ys to broaden WCC, one way would be for the small and faithful groups of sincere Christians that do not want to join to find themselves in the WCC, but that would hardly fit Graham's description of a \"much broader\" WCC, since some of the churches in WCC include conser vative elements dragged into it by their liberal denominational leaders. The only way to take Graham seriously, is that Graham has in mind bringing together the WCC with Hinduism, the New Age movement etc. I would challenge Graham's perc eption that there is a great need fo r a much broader WCC. Graham has clearly indicated just by who his friends are, the people he associates with and uses, about his pro -New World Order stance. 66.

THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND The Church of England (also known as the ANGLICAN Church in Canada and the EPISCOPALIAN or PROTES TANT EPISCOPALIAN Church in the United States) is now part of the One-World-Religion. There are a few conservatives w ho are still holding out, but they appear to pose little threat to t he power structure, and can be ignored by the Masonic hierarchy that control s these churches. It must be difficult at best for the conservatives, for these conservatives are pl aced repeatedly in positi ons where they must compromise with the direction the church is going. Several items that will be ex amined in further detail are: 1. How the Anglican & Episcopal C hurches are run by the Masons 2. That these churches are no w supporting the New Age Movement 3. That the Anglican church has been closely as sociated with a distorted form of British— Israelism. THE ORIGINS OF TH E ANGLICAN CHURCH The Church of England was or iginally part of the Roman Catholic Church, and it retained its clergy and hierarchy from its Catholic da ys. The reader will recall that King Henry VII desired the privilege of divorce in order to marry Anne Boleyn. Henry VII went so far as to force the clergy of his realm on Jan.,1531 to declare him \"supreme head\" of Christ's Church in England. In 1535 he declared himsel f \"in terra supremum caput Anglicanae ecclesiae\"—that is in Latin \"s upreme head on earth of the English Church\"."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"That is the King/Priest concept. Thomas Crom well who believed in that concept was also a close co-worker with Henry VII, and his dec endent Oliver is responsible for the Jews coming to England and for Anglo-lsraelism be coming so prominant in the English Isles. The Church of England did make changes a fter their separation from Rome, but they were principally changes based on humanism and the Reformed movement rather than Luther's ideas. 1 After the political separation of the Church of England from the Catholic Church, many of the problems that had plagued the church during its years under Rome's authority continued and even grew. For instance, the Church of England became notorious for the practi ce called Pluralism— that is wh ere a clergyman will hold several church offices in order to draw pay from eac h, and yet the clergyman would not perform the function of but one office. 2 When the separation with Rome occured, and for many years afterward, the clergy in the Anglican Church were often poorly educated and had poor morals. 3 TIES TO MASONRY & BRITISH-ISRAELISM The idea of British-Israelism was so popular with the Anglican Church that many associate the two together. The form of Br itish-lsraelism that the Anglican Church practices is perverse in that it elevates th e Askenazim Jews to central position in the affairs of mankind, whic h God never promised them. King Alfred the Great (who reigned from 871 to 899) was positive he was fiftieth in direct descent from Adam. King James I, who was the first to call Engl and \"Great Britain\", had written on the gates to his throne Jer 17:25, \"Then shall enter into the gates of the city, kings and princes sitti ng upon the throne of David.\" The Royalty of England, who have been leaders in British Freemasonry, have hinted off and on that they believe that they are descendents of the House of David. (A letter requesting clarification from the British Queen on this point ha s gone unanswered.) Whet her the Royalty bel ieves it or not, various researchers are saying they are descendents. 4 On the books, technically the British royalty has immense powers, but the today's traditional wa y of handling things gives them very limited power. It is not inco nceivable that they might someday regain in reality the power that is still on the books. Prince Charles is a New Ager, 5 and when he visited the Pope in 1985 he attempted unsuccessfully to share the mass with the pope. 6 The Anglican church is also so close to Masonry, the Anglican and Episcopal churches are really extensions of Freemasonry. One scholar on Freemasonry de scribes the Church of England as paralyzed against Freemasonry. 7 Church officials (Anglicans and Presby terians) have lost their jobs because they criticized Freemasonry, 8 so it is something that in 1987 the Masons ruling the Church of England allowed a group of Anglican priests call ed The Working Group established by the Standing Committee of the General Synod of the Church of England to publish a report questioning the compatibility of Freemas onry and the Church. The report says it \"points to a number of very fundamental reasons to question the compatibility of Freemasonry with Christianity.\" 9 Even though this is a step in the right direction, the report pos es no threat to the Masonic power structure. Earlier in Chap. 2.1 lists of Anglican, and Ep iscopal priests and bis hops is given. This is not a blanket condemnation of the Episcopal church, nor can the motives of these men be questioned. However, to give docum entation on how powerful Masonry and its"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"daughter the New Age movement are in the Anglican/Episcopal church this data is given. Are we not to judge a tree by its fruit? So me of the top leaders of the New Age have come out of the Episcopal church, and now in their pulpits some of the most anti- Christian, and some of the most perverted people are preaching. MANY OF THE VERY TOP LEADERS ARE MASONS It has been popular for the Archbishop of Ca nterbury to be a Mason. The following are some of the Masons who have been at th e top of the Anglican/ Episcopal hierarchy: IN ENGLAND Dr. Geoffrey F. Fisher, Archbishop of Cant erbury beginning in 1945. He was initiated into Masonry in 1916 and before he became the Archbishop and Primate, while only an Anglican Bishop. He became the Grand Chaplain of the Grand Lodge of England in 1937 and 1939. William Howley, Archbishop of Cant erbury (1828-1848) and important Mason. Henry Chicheley- another Archbis hop of Canterbury and important Mason. IN CANADA Samuel Pritchard Matheson (1852-1942) Bishop and primate of all Canadian Anglican Churches from 1909 to 1930, in itiated into Masonry in 1874. D.T. Owen (1878-1947), 33°, Primate of the Church of En gland in Canada, and Archbishop of Toronto. IN THE UNITED STATES (Also refer to the earlier listing of Bishops and Priests) Henry St. George Tucker, Presiding Bishop of the Protestant Epis. Church in the USA 1938-46. An overview of the extent of Freemasonry within the Ang lican church can be seen in an article by London's Daily Express which li sts the numbers of Ma sons in the highest Anglican offices in 1960. In 1960, there were within the Anglican church, 13 Mason Anglican Bishops, including one Canadian and 6 retired. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of the West Indies were both Freemasons. Also there were 6 Deans and Provosts of Cathedrals and 10 Archdeacons (incl. those retired) who were Masons. 10 It's amazing that so many m en have dedicated their lives to the Masonic Institution. Bear in mind that these men as they were initiated in Lodge were told in the ceremony, \"No institution can boast a more solid foundat ion than that on which Freemasonry rests, the practice of every moral and social virtue.\" Yet, the Scriptures declare that \"For no other foundation can be laid exce pt that which is Christ Je sus.\" To accept otherwise is a denial of Christianity. The reader can now understand better the common complaint that one of the requirements in order to rise in the Anglican hierarchy is to be a Mason."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"A pro-Jewish book written about a century ago indicates one reas on the Masons may be popular within the Anglican hierarchy. \"It is known that five of the bishops and over 300 of the clergy of the Ch urch of England are either Jews or of Jewish descent.\" 11 EARLY EPISCOPAL CHURCH & MASONRY The Church of England was especially strong in colonial Virginia, and somewhat also in colonial Maryland. The Episcopalian who is sometimes called the Father of Freemasonry Henry Price (1697- 1780) came to Boston, Mass. in 1723 and convened a regular lodge in 1733 in Boston. 12 Irregular lodges had been m eeting in the colonies previous to this. James Madison, the first Episcopalia n bishop in colonial Virginia was also an active Mason. 13 In discussing the colonial time period C.S. Co les, 32°, writes in the New Age Magazine (Oct. 1921) p. 468, \"In those days too, Free masonry was largely conf ined to the members of the Episcopal Church among English-spea king people, both Scottish and English Masonry having its main support among the members of the Established Churches, and it is a fine thing to know that in t hose days the Church and Masonry went hand in hand in performing works of charit y and good-will. Today the Epi scopal Church takes the same position as the Masons in regard to the great public school system of our country, the past century having worked a revolution in our methods...\" The Church of England controlle d its churches in the colonies through the office of the Bishop of London who appointed commissaries for the colonies to carry out his orders. By the time of the Amer. Revolution, there were 300 Anglican churches and 250 Anglican clergymen in the 13 colonies. 14 REV. JASPER ADAMS The Rev. Jasper Adams (17 93-1841) is an example of e arly Episcopalian leaders. He was a Mason and well known Epicopalian cl ergyman during the early years of this country. He served as the chaplain and a prof essor at West Point. He eventually started a private seminary at Pendleton, S.C. 15 HERESY & THE ANGLICAN CHURCH The Anglican church has embraced men of all forms of persuasion. From the Anglican Church have come men like John Taylor, w ho became the LDS churc h's third President. John Taylor was the descendent of Richard Wh ittington, three times Mayor of London. He had been exposed to both Masonry and th e Anglican Church's Anglo-lsraelism, both of which Mormonism encompasses. (He also was a Methodist minister for a spell.) He declared that Christianity was \"hatched in hell\" and was \"a perfect pack of nonsense...The Devil could not invent a better engine to spread his work...\" 16 In other words, when we get the bigger picture we see new religious groups which we had pictured as new formations drawing their blood from many rel igious heritages, but which were actually in many ways just regroupings of Masonic thin kers accompanied by those who they were able to get to follow and submit to them. WILLIAM TEMPLE In 1921, William Temple (18 81 -1944) was made Bishop of Manchester and in 1942 the Archbishop of Canterbury. William Temple is quite well known, especially for his"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"ecumenical activities. He was instrumental in promoting the World Council of Churches and the unification (union) of the various British Protestant denominations, which unified under the British Council of Churches. He was c hairman of the Provisional Committee of the World Council of Churches. W.R. INGE W.R. Inge (1860 ---------- ), Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London is another well known Anglican. He has promoted mysticism and Platonism. JAMES PARKS MORTON James Parks Morton, Dean of the Episco pal Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York City, is openly a New Age leader. He is on record as in favor of the New Age plan (called Planetary Initiative) to unify t he world under a One-World-Religion One-World- Government. And he is doing all he can to promote its happening. For Pentecost, he inivited every type of religious group in to commune with his church. For a Thanksgiving celebration he did the same. He describes this: \"So at Pentecost we invited the head R abbi of New York, the Abbot of the Zen Community, Satchidananda—a Hi ndu Oren Lyons—an American Indian, the head Imman at the mosque, and we all stood around the altar and prayed for peace in our own languages. \"Then we all received communion. Some ch urch people said, \"How can you do that? They don't know what they're receiving! \"I say, \"Well, I don't really kn ow what I'm receiving either... \"We're increasingly being called to realize that the body of Christ is the earth- the biosphere- the skin that includes all of us.\" 17 For Thanksgiving in 1988, James Morton invi ted in witches, medicene men, nature worshippers, and American Indians and they danced around in a \"C ircle dance\" to promote friendship and unity. Morton stated that the dan ce was to create a \"heightened consciousness of the necessity of differ ent religions working together to save our planet.\" 18 PRESIDENT BUSH It is no surprise then considering the Episco palian support for a Ma sonic World Religion and a One-World-Government that 33° Freemason George Bush, 19 who hopes to be the one in office to have the honors of bringin g in the New World Order, would as U.S. President turn to such men as the Rt. Rev. Edmund L Browning, pres iding bishop of the Episcopalian Church in the United States. Another Reverend that Bush turned to during the Kuwait crisis was the Senate chaplain, Rev. Richard C. Halverson. 20 EPISCOPALIANS HAVE REJECTED CHRIST Not only have homosexuals, Satanists and New Agers spoken from the Episcopalian pulpits, but in 1990 at the Michigan Ep iscopal Diocese a resolution by those Episcopalians who apparently still believe in t he Bible was ignored. Their resolution which was refused to be given to a vote, simply quot ed the Bible that \"Jesus is the Christ, the only name given under heaven by which we may be saved.\" It was rejected for a vote,"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"because it was said to be \"devisive and demeaning to people whose faith in God is as strong as ours though it is differently defined.\" According to the Christian scriptures this is really warped thin king. Although pretending to be different and Christian, actually t he Episcopal Church, which now adheres to a social gospel is preaching and defining \"faith in God\" just as th e other religions. The Episcopal Church by rejecting the Bible's definiti on of \"faith in God\" is not able to see that witches, New Agers, Satanists, etc. do not have a \"faith in G od\". The issue that Episcopalian Masons raised that one shoul dn't demean other people' s faith is fake, for the Buddhists, Witches et. al. do not have Christ ian faith. It is not true that Christians are rejecting other believers by believing in Scripture. An example of where the Episcopal clergy ha ve gone, is Newark's Episcopal Bishop John S. Spong, who talks about how he worships in a Buddhist temple, \"In the fall of 1988, I wors hipped God in a Buddhist temple . As the smell of incense filled the air, I knelt before three images of the Bu ddha, feeling that the smoke could carry my prayers heavenward. It was for me a hol y moment...beyond the wo rds and creeds that each [religion] uses, there is a divine power that unites us... \"I will not make any further attempts to convert the Buddhist, the Jew, the Hindu or the Moslem. I am content to learn from them and to walk with them side by side toward the God who lives, I believe, bey ond the images that bind and blind us.\" 21 PARTICIPATION IN THE ONE-WORLD-RELIGION The Episcopalian Church is officially part of the One-World-Religion. A foreshadowing of the Union of the large power religions of Christendom was seen in 1922, when the Greek Orthodox Church—specifically the Eastern Orthodox's Holy Synod of Constantinople accepted the Anglican religious orders. The Archbishop of Canterbury committed the Church of Engl and to the pact that the \"Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliament ary Leaders on Human Surv ival\" decreed. That pact resulted in a five-day Gl obal Forum where religious l eaders of all persuasions (except Bible-believing Christians) were present. Also participating were the Archbishop of Canterbury, the normal host of Mason relig ious and spiritual leaders, U.S. Senators, Soviet Government officials, the U.N. Se cretary General, the Dalai Lama (considered a god), and a host of other types like monks, Moslem inmans, and rabbis. They declared that their committment to a Unified Religion (w hich is supposedly nec essary \"for global survival\") is in their words \"commitments that are irrevocable.\" In Jan. 15-19, 1990, they held another Global Forum in Moscow, U.S.S. R. That Global Forum called for a \"new planetary perspective\" involving a \"new spiritual and ethical basis for human activities on earth.\" 22 Yes, they are proposing a NEW ethical basis for us, to replace that \"old time religion\" so many Christians have sung about. Theirs is the revitalized Christianity also known as the Masonic religion that New Age leaders such as Bailey and Benjamin Creme say will be the One-World-Religion. It is the religion of Masonry wh ich is described by Albert Pike: \"Masonry around whose altars the Christian, the Hebrew, the Moslem, the Brahman, the followers of Confucius and Z oroaster, can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God...\" 23 "},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"THE NEW AGE PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE CHURCH Masonry and its daughter the New Age do no t plan to destroy the church but to subvert it to their purposes. New Age writer William Thompson states, \"The new spirituality does not reject the earlier patterns of the great universal religions. Priest and church will not disappear; they will not be forced out of existence in the New Age, they will be absorbed in to the existence of the New Age.\" 24 The Anglican Church is not being destroyed but rather subver ted. And just as it was made to bow to the dictates of Henry VII, it is bowing to the dictates of the International Power which plans to rule the world. The Ang lican priests still have their churches but they are used for the New Age. An example of that is the historical St. James Anglican Church just off of Piccadilly Square. The church is a favorite for tourist s, especially to the New Age type which it caters to. The church calls itself \"A Se ven Days a Week Church for London and the World.\" Within the church are held classes for all types of New Age religious activities such as \"Health for the New Age...through meditation, visualization...,\" \"Lifetime Astrology,\" \"Yoga Meditation.\" If you want to join the Sufi Healing Order which meets there you can. 25 Episcopals like Bishop Lewis Stuart Keizer, who authored The 8th Revelation Reveals the 9th: A New Hermetic Initiation Di scourse (1974) are turning to the occult. Episcopal clergyman and professor at the Cat holic Notre Dame University Morton T. Kelsey promotes the occult to Christians in his book The Christian and the Supernatural. This apostasy is causing much glee to hard c ore New Agers. One said , \"I am very glad to discover such strong movement within Chri stian churches that is sympathetic to the Pagan Spirit and willing to learn from the teachings of the Old Religion.\" 26 Notes 1.

And the Congre gational churches that rose out of the congregations of the Puritans worked in close cooperation with the"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Presbyterians. \"Theologica lly the two were akin.\" 1 The state organizati ons in New England of the Congregationalists and the Presby terian General Assembly had exchanged delegates beginning in the 1 790s. They cooperated in sending missionaries, in the Home Missionary Society, and in the Ameri can Bible Society (begun in 1816). 2 Forty-nine colleges and universities, many of them now secular were started by the Presbyterians. 3 Many of the Presbyterians in the United Stat es were from the Scot-Irish settlers that had moved to northern Ireland, and left Ireland when the eco nomic situation deterioted. Charles T. Russell's family were part of this group. PRESBYTERIANS PLAY AN IMPORT ANT ROLE IN THE LODGES Various Presbyterian ministers have play ed important roles in the Masonic Lodges. Presbyterian minister James Anderson was re sponsible for the Masonic Constitution and the development of modern Freemasonry. 4 Presbyterian minister James Allan Cabiniss wrote the Grand Lodge of Mississippi's official history, which was published in 1967 by the Grand Lodge. MASONS HAVE PLAYED PROMINENT RO LES IN THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH This section must be prefaced by saying that the United P resbyterian church is very close to Freemasonry. There are more United Presbyterians than all the other 7 major Presbyterian denominations put together. There is in excess of 2 million American United Presbyterians in 9,000 churches. In contrast, the Orthodox Pr esbyterian Church had only 16,590 members in the 1982 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches and the Presbyterian Church of North Ameri ca was listed having but 4,878. 5 The small Reformed Church finally took an official stand against Freemasonry in 1942. The one Presbyterian denomination prior to t hat time that took a clear stand against Freemasonry was the Associate Presbyteri an Church which following the 1757 Secession tradition had forbidden Masonic membership. In writing this part concerning the Presbyteri ans, I have taken the liberty to lump the various groups together in the same section— however, they can in no way be lumped together in their response to Freemasonry and the One-World-Power. Examples of Presbyterian Ma sons working on the functi onal church leve l are Robert W. Cretney (33°, deacon Presby terian church), Morton P. St eyer (KT, 32°, Shriner, York Rite College, Royal Order of Scotland, an d elder Presbyterian Church), and Hugh I. Evans (33°, KT, National Head of the Presbyterian Church, USA.) 33rd degree Mason Hugh I. Evans (188 7-1958) deserves some note here. He represented the U.S. at the meet ing of the World Council of Churches in Holland in 1948. He was the National Head of the Presbyt erian Church, U.S.A. in 1950-51. In 1955, he became the director of the Foundation of the Presbyterian Church at NYC. and he served for a while as the President of the Board of National Missions. The Newsletter Free The Masons (Aug. 1990) says \"On the other end of that, however, is the church on whose Board sit Lodge members, or whose Deacons or Elders share Masonic secrets. These secrets reflect their higher allegiance to the Lodge, and seem to produce an aloofness from the rest of the C hurch body. These are ' good' men who attend regularly and are often the financial backb one of many small congregations."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"\"One Pastor wrote of his frustration in a rural c hurch. He put it this way, \"As faithful as these men are, I always feel at board meetings that there is a second agenda which is not open to me. It's like they get their marching orders from the Lodge on how to conduct the business of the church. They are good m en, but they seem to operate with some 'higher' knowledge than the rest of us. There is no submission to the authority of the church and its members.\" \" Sometimes Masonic literature shows its true colors almost to the point of being embarrasing. The book Standard F reemasonry states that Presbyterians are bad material [for the lodge] until they go against their church. 6 The Proceedings of the Grand Lodge of Oregon, 1870, p. 209 states that the w orld is a good place when the Presbyterian church shares its pulpit with a Jewish rabbi in Salem, OR. The Alabama Grand Lodge reported in 1889 that out of it s 7,950 Freemasons in the state 483 were Christian ministers. 7 The New York Grand Lodge report of 1890 gives us the breakdown of the 703 Christian cle rgymen that were N.Y. Masonic members: Methodist(288), Episcopalian(14 6), Baptist(112), Presbyt erian(59), Universalist(31), Congregationalist(21), Dutch Reformed(13), Christian(13), Lutheran(11), Jewish(7), Unitarian(l), Reform Jew(1). 8 THE NEW AGE & THE PR ESBYTERIAN CHURCHES The United Presbyterian Church put out a \"R eport on Occult and Psychic Activities\" in 1976 that gave a positive report to various oc cult activities. It encourages the study of the occult \"within the churches\" (p.3). The medium Olga Worra ll's book The Gift of Healing gets a favorable review. One of the seven on the task force that wrote up the report was Mrs. Margueritte Harmon Bro who was a medium and the cofounder of SFF. Another example of the New Age in the Pres byterian church is Pastor H. Richard Neff, of the Christian Community Presbyterian Chur ch of Bowie, Maryland.

Lorenzo Dow is one of these. Lorenzo Dow was solidly behind the Masonic belief system. 1 He joined the Freemasons in 1824. 2 Some of the things he wr ote, sound like Universalism, 3 but he wasn't really theologically a universalis t. Most of the people he preached to didn't understand where he was coming from either. Lorenzo Dow was the catalyst that caused Hugh Bourne and a friend William Cloves to establish the Primitive Methodists in 1811. Several denominations experienced primitive movements, for instance the Primitive Baptists. The idea of Primitivism goes back to Rosseau and Diderot's writings. (Both were Masons.) There are para llels in Freud's Civiliz ation and its Disconten t and Spengler's Man & Technics. Nature is the norm. The world goes in cycles . And we are returning, that is recycling back into another golden age. The Mason Thomas Paine encouraged this type of thinking. \"We have it in our power to beg in the world over again.\" 4 Indeed, Billington in his scholarly work Fire in the Minds of Men, shows how the word revolution was coined by the occultic secret societies because they believed that an upheaval would precede a revolving back to the conditions of an ancient golden age. Lorenzo Dow was sincere in bringing peopl e to Christ—albeit his understanding of Christ, which many considered heresy. He travelled almost non-stop for his lifetime, and likely preached to more people in his lif e than anyone else in that time. 5 He was called crazy by many . Some called him a mystic. 6 He was very keen on prophecy, and preached it a lot. He preached often on Paradise and Hell. During his non-stop travelling, Lorenzo Dow was a constant visitor to Masonic Lodges, to their chapters, and their commanderies, 7 yet his memoirs ment ion nothing about such an important part of his life. There is not the slightest hint of involvement with the Masons, and in his memoirs there is but an offhand remark on page 122 about a lodge meeting going on above him in a Tavern he was staying at while he was trying to sleep. Why is he silent about his involvement? The Primitive Methodist Church that wa s set up, had 12 pe rmanent members who ruled. Later in 1846, 24 guardian representatives were selected and lega lly invested with the Primitive Methodist Church's property. It wa sn't until the next century that democratic procedures began. What was the Primitive Methodist Church like when Russell's colpateurs found them? Apparently, the Masonic influence was strong. John Whittaker, a Primitive Methodist minister exposes the Masonic influence when he describes his denomination, \"The desire for latitudinarianism has wrought untol d mischief in our Church. Theosophy, Swedenborianism, Unitarianism and even Agnos ticism are rampant to-day within our borders. It is time the Church was purged.\" 8 In England, Charles T. Russell's preac hers found the Primitive Methodists and Free Methodists very friendly. Bro. J.B. Adamson in a letter reprinted in the WT in 1881 states \"Found the Free Methodists very fair. The tr eatment better than I got anywhere else. Gave the pamphlet to sixte en preachers and one h undred of the most intelligent of the church membership.\" 9 It's possible some of the Pr imitive Methodists heard of the"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Watchtower movement in the Masonic Hall or at some Masonic function. The 1991 Yearbook (for the J ehovah's Witnesses) 10 records an early Bible Student preaching to the Masons in their Masonic Hall. What did he preach on? He showed them the pyramid diagrams in the front of Russell's volume 1. In terestingly, the Masons used Piazi Smyth's diagrams also in their literat ure, (such as Manly P. Hall's The Secret Teachings of All Ages). They must have felt comfortable wi th Russell's pyramidology. At any rate, there is the possibility some Primitive Methodists might have learned a bout the Bible Students through lodge functions. In England, many Primitive Methodists joined Russell's movement. Six Primitive Methodist ministers joined his organization en masse. 11 In the WT Feb. 1884, p. 2 the problem is mentioned that Russell's followers were being mistaken for Universalists, Prim itive Methodists, or Adventists. \"New readers in all parts of the country are c onstantly inquiring: By what names do you call yourselves? Are you 'Primitive Baptists '? Are you 'Missionary Baptists'? Are you 'Universalists'? Are you 'Adventist s'? Are you Primitive Methodists'?\" 12 As this book is documenting, the Univers alists, the Primitive Methodists, and the Second Adventists all have strong Masonic connec tions. As this book has made it clearer what the early Watchtower Society was like (i n contrast to today), and how much closer it was to Masonic thinking in its early years, it is not such a surprise, indeed it is understandable how the Watchtower Society coul d be mistaken for being Universalists, or Primitive Methodists. THE NOT SO PRIMITIVE METHODISTS Most of the Methodist groups have been \"progressive.\" But what are they headed toward? \"The book, Prominent Personalities in Am erican Methodism, by Howell, gives an authoritative listing of the various lodge affiliations of prominent Methodist leaders. According to our compilation from this book, b earing imprint of 1945, twenty-nine out of the thirty-six active Bishops are members of secret orders of one sort or another. Twenty-one of the thirty-six are members of th e Masonic fraternity, many of them holding the higher degrees of the Order....The best q ualification for becoming a Bishop today is that one be at leas t a 32nd degree Mason.\" 13 Perhaps better than showing lists of Methodist Bishops who are Masons, is just to get to the bottom line, the United Methodist Church wants a O ne-World Government under the New World Order. The United Methodist Church, Rocky M ountain Conference wrote Pres. Reagan in 1983, \"Resolve that to insure world peace and disarmament among nations, we United Methodists of the Rocky Mountain Conferenc e urge the President and the Congress of the United States, in concert with all other willing nations, to call a World Constitutional Convention to reform the United Nation s into a federal, representative world government...\" 14 Masons like 33° Mason James C.

True, John Wesley's group at Oxford, already called the \"Enthusiasts\" and the \"Hol y Club\", was active before the Moravian Peter Boehler came upon the sc ene. Still, it was Boehler, whom Wesley met in Georgia and then again in Lond on, whose glowing pietis m had such an effect upon the father of Methodism. It was Boehler who in 1738 helped Wesley turn his attention inward to discover a new wellspring of religious fe eling, and it was Boehler who suggested establishing the Fetter Lane Society in Lond on, which Wesley patte rned after several Moravian meetings already in existence.\" 17 John Wesley advocated universal redemption, which emphasized salvation as an option of man's free-will rather than God's free-grace. Until American Independence, the Methodist ministers under Wesley's authority in America and England we re considered a Society whose members were scattered within the various Episcopal Churches . The American colonies' in dependence caused Wesley in 1784 to send Rev. Thom as Coke to organize the Methodists into their own congregations. 18 UNITED METHODISTS & YOUTH In 1972, the United Methodist church sponsored me to go with the Kansas East Youth Study Group. The tour was well-planned an d well-executed. The group was part of the United Methodist Church's program to raise up church leaders. Th e group consisted of U.M. teenage leaders (I was an exception— I was Baptist). I still have the papers and items from the tour. The group met Methodis t leaders including the head of the United Methodist Church, Pentagon pe ople, Congressmen, UN people, and revolutionaries from Angola. While our group was decidedly anti-Vie tnam War, it seemed that our group did not connect the contradiction that the United Methodist church helped finance the communist revolutionaries we talked with. I am grateful to the United Methodist Chur ch for the opportunity to experience the group. In the context of this book, it co uld be mentioned that the Jewish and Masonic undercurrents within the U.M. church were vi sible through out that trip. Some of the concepts that were stressed were Civil Rights, Globalism, and Libera tion Theology. Those concepts all tie-in with the Power's agenda to bri ng in the New World Order. The Liberation Theology and revolution that the United Methodist Ch urch finances will be discussed in the next chapter. THE SMALL CONSERVATI VE DENOMINATIONS To the credit of the small, conservative, indepedent churches and denominations many of these are not part of the One-World-Re ligion, but the Power has still made serious inroads into most of them . What will the New Order do with these denominations? They have three options, subvert the leadership , if there is no hier archy to subvert then subvert the people, and if neither of those ca n be accomplished then they will have to make an exception for these gr oups or eliminate them. We w ill examine briefly three small denominations that this Author is familiar wi th that illustrate th ese three approaches. It"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"should be noted that in prayfully studying many religious bodies, this Author hasn't found any that don't bear out the Scri ptures, \"For all have sinned a nd come short of the glory of God.\" What is presented is neither to bu ild up or tear down th e reputation of any group— (reputations are often simply men's im ages of something— rather than the thing itself) but to plot the cours e of the One-World-Religion as the New Order wars to destroy the last pockets of resistence to the One-W orld-Religion. The next few years will decide whether they overextend them selves like Napoleon in Russia or if they take over Jerusalem (figurtively) like t he Babylonians and Romans did. CONTROL THE HIERARCHY The Seventh-Day Adventists have over a ha lf-million members in the United States. Started by a woman of Jewish heritage Ell en Gold White, they have made the Sabbath a prominant part of their religion. This Author has admired their church members for the standards that they have maintained, espe cially their stand against Freemasonry. This denomination has a hierarchy with a President. Ever y five years th e denomination has a convention to discuss a particular issue that is placed on the agenda. For instance, recently they discussed whether women could become ministers. The easiest way for the New World Order to deal with such denominat ions is to subvert t he hierarchy. That the hierarchy can be moved in such directions can be s een by their decisi on years ago (even before Roe vs. Wade) to allow abortions, 19 which even their people help perform in their hospitals. Maybe this Author is offbase on this next observation, but to think of an Adventist doctor eating health food for lunch, and then performing an abortion seems like a New Age value system. That is just one indication of a shift toward New Age morality. We see people like Seventh-Day Adventist writer Rene Noorberge n co-authoring a book with psychic Jeane Dixon. SUBVERT THE MEMBERSHIP Not all small denominations have a hierarc hy. The Church of C hrist are groups of independent churches. Although independent for many years a few editors of Church of Christ periodicals and a clique of a few mini sters were looked to for guidance. The trend within the Churches of Christ seems to be one that churches are moving away from looking to a few men for their direction. 20 Because there is no powerful hierarchy to subvert, the Masons haven't shown a great deal of interest in recruiting its ministers. This denomination has historically put no barriers or deterence up against Freemasonry. Masons have had free access to church positions if they have wanted them. There are Church of Christ ministers who are Masons, and this Author personally knows various Church of Christ churches wi th lay members involved in Masonry. One Church of Christ in California meets in a Masonic Hall. 33rd degree Freemason and C hurch of Christ Minister Forrest D. Haggard, who recently wrote Short Talk Bulleti n which is an attack on every Christian who criticizes the Lodge. Haggard says that critics of the Ma sonic Lodge can be divided into three categories: 1. someone had a personality pro blem, 2. political or religi ous dictatorships which oppose free speech often attack the Lodge because it insists on su ch freedoms, 3. for money. Haggard even claims the lodge is \"s upportive of it [the church].\""},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"These groups of churches are showing movement tow ard the One-World-Religion. They are adopting the ideas that New Agers are planting within the churches, using New Age language and moving toward ecumenicalism. In visiting with Church of Christ ministers this Author has experienced a lack of knowledge on their part as to what are New Age ideas as compared to Biblical Christianity. (By the way, there have been attempt to bring these items that this Author is bringing up in this book before the Christians practi cing them. Those that have been contacted by myself or others have stubbor nly refused to listen, and so it is hoped that by some chance some of the many people contacted will read this book and see the bigger issues at stake. When a Church of Christ asks the United Methodist church to have communion with it, the issues at stake are much l arger than simply do we like them or not.) Churches like the Churches of Christ are ea sy targets for the many schemes the New Order has thought up to subvert the churches. They in general fell f or the one where in exchange for signing on a paper denying Christ as the head of the church, the churches received a tax exempt status. The top secret Operations Research Te chnical Manual TM-SW7905.1 that the Bilderbergers Policy Committee uses, which is discussed elsewhere (chapter 3.6) spells out one of their methods to subvert the Christ ians. Because the Church of Christ doesn't take a stand against military serv ice, this tactic has been, and will be sucessful as one tool to subvert there members.  Quoting one part of this TM SW7905.1 we read, \"Few efforts of human beh avior modification are more remarkable or more effective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft. A primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, by intimidation, in the young males of a society the uncritical conviction that the government is omnipotent. He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus, a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years of his life ca n, by this instrument of government, be broken down, be purged of all his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that conviction is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill. Even more interesting is t he process by which a young man's parents, who purportedly love him, can be induced to send him off to war to his death.\" The manual goes on to say that part of t he reason for drafting men is to corrupt them. Why? \"It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders, thus making criticism of the elders by the youth le ss likely (Generational St abilizer). It is marketed and sold to the public under the label of ' patriotic=national' service.\" In other words, the New World Order realizes that if the y oung men of this country have moral superiority over their elders they will stand up to them when asked to do some thing amoral or immoral. By making them do things that they can be made to feel guilty for under the guise of defending their homeland—like fighting in Vietnam, they have eliminated moral opposition"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"by creating another generation of guilt ridden young men. This highlights what you will learn in chapter 3.10 \"Where the rubber meet s the road\" where we discuss methods to cope in a Christ-like way with the New Order. If there is a lack of safegu ards for the Church of Christ churches, that is not the situation with the next de nomination we will discuss. ELIMINATION OR SPECIAL EXEMPT STATUS Some groups like the Old Order Amish can not be subverted by the New World Order because they are not p art of the system, don't believe in serving in the military, and don't give much if any chance to outsiders to subvert them. When Hitler took power the three Amish se ttlements in Germany were eliminated. The members of these churhes disappeared. Because the Amish are independent church districts, many of which do work with other districts, it was a small vi ctory for the govern ment during the Vietnam war when the Amish churches decided to work together and be represented by a steering committee. But although this sets a precid ence that the government will try to further encourage, it is a minor gain at best. The Amish churches will never give their autonomy away to some committee. This means that ev en if the government got in people they liked on a steering committee it would have only minimal influence. Can the membership be subvert ed? Although it rarely happens, it isn't impossible. One major subversion took place over two hundred years ago, when the Amish allowed folk magic to mix with their culture. When the Rosicrucian settlements fell apart, they joined the Mennonites in Lancaster PA. and brought in many of their occult ideas. Other influences too have intoduced occult practi ces. Although the famous Pennslyvannia Hex signs are more representative of the higher Pennslyvannia Dutch churches, they and the magic they represent also been practiced among the Amish. Magic, astrology, and new age healing have made solid inr oads into the Old Order Amis h. The Amish book which lists all their ministers is mixed with p ages of Astrology, and has been for decades. After writing an expose of Astrology showing its Ba bylonian origin and its unscriptualness, this Author sent the book to the publishers of the Amish Calender, their book listing their ministers, challenging them to leave the Astrology out of The Calender. The challenge was ignored. The Amish have worked hard to remain a rura l people. The farmers of this country are one of the true producers in th e U.S. Most of us merel y manipulate, or move, or rearrange what the farmer produces. The farm er depends upon the weather, the soil, the sun, and water. Because he is more dependent upon these things he is often more dependent upon God. America has belittled and ignored the farmer too long. One weakness of today's society and the New World Order is their total lack of appreciation for the farmer of America. Someday that di sregard may come back to haunt them. The push today by the Power is for agribusine ss and large Russian-type farms. It seems all the lessons learned in the Communist c ountries will have to be rediscovered the hard way."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"1. Denslow, 10,000 Famo us Freemasons, p. 327 2. ibid. 3.

Witn esses to the truth of Billy Graham's 33° Scottish Rite Masonic membership are many. 1 Not only is this membership hopelessly at odds with Christ's teachings, but it reveals th e Satanic side of Billy Graham's ch aracter that the media hasn't told you about. 2 Billy Graham groped blindfolded in the Masonic L odge and declared before the Worshipful Masonic Lodge Master that he was in need of light. How redicu lous for a Christian evange list who claims to have the light of the world, to be g a pagan hierarchy for light. Billy Graham has repeatedly taken blood oaths on pena lty of gruesome death to keep the Masonic Lodge's secrets and to deceive others about their activitie s. When such a man as an international evangelist swears to be dishonest, is dishonest, and takes blood oaths, then this is a reproach on the Bible and on Christ. Are Freemasons like 33° Bi lly Graham trustworthy? No, according to the great evangelist Charles Finney who left the Masonic Lodge when he dedicated his life to Christ. He said the Fr eemasons could not be trusted. Finney declared that Freemas ons in the higher levels have lost their consciences because they have seared their consciences so much. According to Finney's warnings , Billy Graham would have a seared conscience. Finney spent his life warning Christians a bout Freemasonry, and if he were alive today, would likely be writing a tract like this. ► Does God's work depend on pe rsonalities?

Is n't there something wrong in the man-made characte r of the Billy Graham crusades? According to repeated st udies, almost all decisions at Crusades have been made by people who were already Christians. 3 Was Christ wrong to focus on discipling, ra ther than spending m illions for superficial mass-evangelism decisions, most of which are not co nversions, but mild renewals?

If there are obvious flaws in Graham's character and the character of his crusades w hy is he so popular? Consider the following and you will know better w hy Billy Graham is popular. First, his popularity began when William Randolph Hearst, the multimillionaire, began funding Youth fo r Christ and Billy Graham's evangelis tic efforts. Billy Gr aham became a nationall y known figure when millionaire Hearst publicized him through his newspapers in 1949. Hearst's influence got the national media to pick up on Graham. BILLY GRAHAM IS INDEED POPULAR...SO PO PULAR THAT Graham was described by Dr. G. Paul Musselman, \"I ca ll Billy Graham the...greatest of the ecumenical voices.\" 4 Billy Graham is on record in support of the World Council of Church es expanding to include th e other major religious groups in the world. 5 ...SO POPULAR THAT Graham was given his doctorate (yes his doctorate is an honorary doctorate) by the Pope. The Pope must be please d that Graham on receiving his honorary doctorate said that the Catholic Church is preaching the same gospel as he is. 6 It must be further rea ssuring that Catholics who go forward at Billy Graham Crusades are referred to Catholic churches. 7 ...SO POPULAR THAT Charotte, N.C. has had a holiday named Billy Graham Day, and Billy Graham is heralded as a great Christian prophet. ...SO POPULAR THAT Christian publishe rs like to take things written by others and us e Billy Graham's name because books with his name as author sell well. ...SO POPULAR THAT died-in-the-wool communists like him. They must have been pleased when Billy Graham was recorded on tape in an interview late r published saying, \"I think communism's appeal to youth is its structure and promise of a future Utopia. Mao Tse-tung's ei ght precepts are ba sically the same as Ten Commandments. In fact if we can't have the Ten Commandments read in the schools, I'll settle for Mao's principles.\" 8 ...SO POPULAR THAT all the Presiden ts and many leading politicians wo rldwide have been close friends with Billy Graham. Billy Graham has given resp ectibility to the Presidents, including his good friend Richard Nixon. A well-research ed article on Billy Graham in the J ournal of Church and State concluded after examining Billy Graham's interaction with the various Presidents since Eisenhower, \"...could Graham speak the word of truth - especially when that word may be critical or slashing - to the man in the White House when he is on such friendly terms with him?

When Billy Graham went to India he gave assurances, that he was \"not going to proselytize any Hindus.\" 10 While in India, he spoke to Christ ians. If Billy Graham will not ta ke on Hinduism which is almost identical to the New Age Movement, do you think he will seriously take on the New Age Movement?

After the National Council of Churches failed to pa ss a resolution declaring the NCC against converting the Jews to Christ, Billy Graham gave assurances to Jewish leaders that God had a special place for the Jews and that he rejected \"coercive evangelistic efforts\" by Christians to convert Jews to Christ. 13 All this cooperation with the Catholics and Je ws is summed up by Billy Graham's statement in 1957, \"Anyone who makes a decision at our m eetings is referred to a local clergyman, Prot estant, Catholic, or Jewish.\" 14 •Jesus said, \"WOE TO YOU WHEN ALL ME N SPEAK WELL OF YOU, FOR SO DID THEIR FATHERS TO THE FALSE PROPHETS.\" LK 6:26 Christians, put on the mind of Christ, and as his disciples see things the way he sees things.

Bu t you are not to be lik e that. Instead, the gr eatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rule s like the one who serves.\" Lk 22:25-26 COULD IT BE THAT THE ONES WE THINK ARE THE GREATEST WILL BE THE LEAST IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD? Could it be po ssible that some unknown widow may be placed at the greatest position? In our haste to idolize men, we ha ve forgotten the Apostle James' warning not to be respecters of men. We have forgotten the Apostle Paul's statemen t about being \"followers of no man but God.\" Christians seem to ask, \"What would God do without Billy Graham?\" and \"Could God get by without Billy Graham's ministry?\" Not only could He, but in many respects Christians would be better off. How so? Tony Campolo, well-known Christian socialogist , pastor and speaker found that converts from television or radio were rare. He found that most converts from the televised Billy Grah am Crusades had had Christians who were f undamental to their conversion around them before and after they watched him on TV. He concludes that it is \"uncertain whether the sermons or the Christia n friends were what was crucial.\" 13 If Billy Graham were not around, and the Holy Spir it needed people to testify of God, it is clear that almost all the converts had a Christian(s) in th eir life who could have ministered completely to them. Christ desires that we Chri stians quit placing all the re sponsibility of ministering on professionals, and that we each take up our individual responsibility to minister. Next time you have a large Christia n gathering ask them how many came to Christ through the television. When Christian groups are asked th is, the response is very small per centage. As stewards of Christ's wealth are we honestly spending our wealth in best ma nner? Compare th e large sums spent for TV evangelism/Crusades with the other needs, that go begg ing for our Christian money.

The Bible teaches us how to treat men who deny Christ, who deny the Scriptures that the Holy Spirit co-authore d, and who lead gravely immoral lives. Scriptures do not say to give them leadership positions and praise them, Scriptures say- REBUKE THEM- Titus 1:13 HAVE NO FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM- Eph 5:11 WITHDRAW YOURSELF FROM BEING WITH THESE TYPES- 2 Thes 3:6 FROM SUCH TURN AWAY- 2 Tim 3:5,8 RECEIVE THEM NOT- 2 Jn 10,11 REJECT HERETICS- Titus 3:10 BE YE SEPARATE- 2 Cor 6:17 NOTES 1. The following are three dependable witnesses to Billy Graham's 33rd degree membership. WITNESS 1. Billy Graham took part in Rev. Jim Shaw's 33° Masonic ini tiation. This was before Shaw left the lodge for Christ. Only 33° degree Masons and candidates partic ipate in that initiation. Jim Shaw refers to Billy Graham's presence at this Mas onic initiation on p. 104 of his book co -authored with Tom McKenney, The Deadly Deception. Lafayette , LA: Huntington House, Inc., 1988. Ji m Shaw has verbally confirmed that p. 104 refers to Billy Graham. WITNESS 2. A recent book (adver tised in a Masonic periodical) The History of Freemasonry written by Epis copalian Dr. Robert Morey refers to Billy Graham being a 33° Mason. A telephone interview with Dr. Morey, who has examined Bill y Graham's 33° degr ee Scottish Rite file in the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple, confirmed that his book' s reference that \" one of the most well known evangelists in th e world...is a 33rd de gree Mason...\" (p. 11) refers to Billy Graham. WITNESS 3. Kurt Billings, an ex-New Age leader now Christian, warns Christians in a ta lk entitled \"New Age and Occult Influences in Public Schools\" that some of their big leaders are selling the Christians down the tubes as fast as they can. In person, Kurt noted that his comments refered to men like 33° Freemason Billy Graham. OTHER WITNESSES. Ralph E pperson who is giving public talks and is the author of The New World Order (1990) and Fritz Springmeier author of Be Wise As Serpents (1991). 2. Recent books exposing the hidden Sata nic side of Freemas onry are The Deadly Deception by Shaw & McKenney, The Secret Teachings of the Masonic Lodge by Ankerberg and We ldon, The Hidden Power Behind Freemasonry by Mohr, Should A Christian Be A Mason? by Storms , and Be Wise As Serpents by Springmeier. Free The Masons, P.O. Box 1077, Issaquah, WA 98027 ha s a good proclamation that was the Free The Masons Newsletter Ja n 1991 which summarizes the serious problems that make Christianity and Freemasonry incompatible. 3. Just one example of the type of results that Grah am's Crusades get is the results of the New York Crusade. Almost all that came forwar d were Christian. 64% were referred to churches they were already members of. Graham himself admitted that 40 to 70% of the decision cards were from people of sponsoring churches a nd almost all the rest were from people who had been members of non-sponsoring churches. See Billy Graham A Parable of American Righteousness (1979 ) by Marshall Fr ady, pp. 291-315. 4. Statement made in 1969. Quoted in Why We Cannot Support The Billy Graham Crusade by E.L. Bynum. 5. At a press conference in Los Angele s Graham said, \"There is a great need for an ecumenical Christian body much broader in scope than either the World Council of Chur ches or the National Council of"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Churches.\" -F.E .A. Nov. 1972 Graham wants the WCC and the NCC more broader. The NCC already includes The Church of Satan (Ant on LaVey's) and has long included such groups as the Unitarian- Universalist Church. Th e WCC is as broad as it ca n be, as it already has an ti-Christian groups, and it has some conservative elements that ha ve been dragged into it by their lib eral denominational leaders. The only way to take Graham seriously is that Graham ha s in mind that the World Council of Churches will add to it New Age churches and other world religion s. That Graham wants to see a One-World-Religion modeled after Freemasonry would be consistent with the views of those who he has as close friends. 6. Speech by Billy Graham at Belmont Abbey College when receiving hi s honorary doctorate from the Catholics. Graham said, \"The gospel that built this sc hool and the gospel that brings me here tonight is still the way to salvation.\" 7. Numerous instances confirming this can be cited. Here are a sampli ng. In the San Francisco Crusade 1,300 Catholics came forward, \"prac tically all remained Catholic.\" Swor d of the Lord 7/2/64. The Catholic Voice of Oakland, the official dioces an paper of the Catholic Church said that if a person makes a decision at a Crusade, \"If he is Catholic, he is referred to a Catholic Church.\" The National Catholic Reporter, 12/21/90 tells its readers that the Bill y Graham Crusade will help them \"to become active again\" in their Catholic parishes. 8. American-born reporter Maur een D'Honau recorded an interview with Billy Graham which was used for an article in the Mainichi Daily News, (May 28, 197 3). In the interview, and re ported in the article was Graham's statement that Ma o Tse-tung's eight precepts are basically the same as the Ten Commandments. 9. article \"Billy and the U.S. Presiden cy\", Journal of Church and State.

Strober in his book American Jews Community in Crisis, p. 110, states that after a resolution in Feb. 1973 at Pittsburgh by the NCC failed to declare th e NCC against converting the Jews Graham came out with his stat ement. Strober also notes that Graham has privately assured Jewish leaders he is against converting the Jews to Christia nity. Strober then on p. 111 informs his readers that many Christian organizations that ar e \"Jewish Missions\" take their ma rching orders from Billy Graham. Christians should investigate wher e their money is really going. 14. Why We Cannot Support Th e Billy Graham Crusad e, by E.L.

The author and his wife entertaine d regional officers of the min- isterial group of his religious organization on the same day one of the pastors had conducted a funeral that had Masonic graveside services. This pastor expounded, at length, on the absurdity of these \"fat little men running around the grave with their aprons, books and sticks.\" Another pastor, who had been called upon to address an Easter morn- ing service at a Scottish Rite Temple started in on his reactions to grown men in costumes, etc. But as the conversation went on it be- came very apparent that their real objection was the \"competition\" at these crucial times—burial and Easter festival. The author, who was at the time , a Grand Chaplain, slipped out of the room and clothed himself in apron and jewel of his office and returned. His entrance was met with absolute silence and then with many, many questions. The ensuing discussion proved, without ex- ception, that all non-Masonic clergy present really resented and feared the competition they felt existed in the sense of loyalty their people gave to Masonry and its allied organizations. The Rev. R. H. Kendrick of Springfield, Massachusetts, writes: In my own personal experience I have not knowingly come across those who oppose Masonry because th ey believe it to be another re- ligion. Rather the attitude of most of the clergy with whom I have talked is one of mild opposition on the supposition that it keeps men from church. There is some truth in this, I do believe, especially when you think of those who are going through the chairs. On the other hand we know that there are many, men in Masonry who wouldn't be active church members if they were not Masons. Few non-Masonic clergy have any idea of the large number of their active supporters who are memb ers of the Fraternity. They are aware unfortunately, of those Masons who use their Masonic affiliation (if such really exists) to serve as an excuse against any participation in the ongoing of life in a positive creative manner. If a man's life and work proves that he is indeed living up to the ideals as taught by Masonry, then I know of no clergy who would really resent his presence or the presence of Masonry in the life of that man, whether that person be in or out of a religious institution. Many a man owes his beginning in depth of spiritual growth to the lodge. If this be an insult to Organized Religion—then let it stand as 126 such. Rather it is a compliment to the Fraternity and to the Organized Religious body in which Masons may affiliate—Masonry has started them on their journey towards light and in their search they have found light in other places; have recognized it and are using it to shed upon their journey. W. A. E. Johnson, D.D., Superintendent of the Methodist Church, Barbourville, Kentucky: There are more than 100,000 Freemasons in Kentucky and I have never known a man among them who has not been a deeply religious man, especially those who have occupied high offices. This same viewpoint is extended of course, to the youth organiza- tions that affiliate with the Masoni c lodge in most communities. This author has served as advisor to the Order of DeMolay and can testify to that excellent group. His wife has served in Job's Daughters and many of the young ladies from his congregation have been in the Order of Rainbow. It is time that these groups are seen, not as com- petition, but as allied organizations, as Dr. Billy Graham said: I find two kinds of young people today. First (and least important) are those given to rebellion and violence. We have always had those, even as far back as Cain and Abel . These vow to annihilate the \"mid- dle class\" morality and ethic, and to toss away the time-honored tra- ditions and ideals of yester year. But happily, this group is a tiny mi- nority, with more noise than influen ce. Then, there are thoughtful, con- cerned young people—who seek to correct the errors in moral naviga- tion that have been made by their elders, intelligently and responsibly. There are the young people upon which the hope of America's future rests and DeMolays are part of th is group. . . . May God richly bless all DeMoIays as they continue their good work. The Reverend William Clyde Donald of Fenton, Michigan, wrote a very astute article on the relationship of Organized Religion to the youth organizations as sponsored by Masonry: In relationship to youth the Masonic lodge has a great advantage in one respect over the church. The church is interested in youth, but as a rule its dealing with youth is confined rather largely to the youth in the families in relationship with that church. Masonry (through its youth program) can minister unto youth in the community regardless of their family church relationships. Masons meet as Masons, not as Methodist or Presbyterian, etc. Their sons and daughters and their friends of their children can come and receive training that will build them into stalwart citizens. The DeMolay, Order of Rainbow, and Jobs Daughters give Masons and the Eastern Star a great opportunity to train youth to believe in and have great faith in the Creator and Sus-"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Exhibit B.

Gelli's aim was somewhat different: extreme right-wing control of Italy. Such control would function as a se- cret state within a state, unless the unthinkable happened and the Communists were electe d to power. If that happened then there would be a coup. The right wing w ould take over. Gelli was confi- dent that the Western powers w ould accept the situation. Indeed, from the very early days of P 2, he had the active support and encouragement of the CIA operating in Italy. It may sound like the scenario of a madman, doomed to the fate of all such schemes, but it should be noted that within the membership of P2 in Italy alone (there were, and still ar e, powerful branches in other countries) were the armed forces commander, Giovanni Torrisi; the Secret Service chiefs, Generals Giuseppe Santovito and Giulio Grassini; the head of Italy's fi nancial police, Orazio Giannini; cabinet ministers and politicians of every political shade (except, of course, the Communists); thir ty generals; eight admirals; newspaper editors; television executives; top businessmen; and bankers, including Roberto Calv i and Michele Sindona. Unlike conventional Freemasonry, the list of members of P2 was secret; only Gelli knew all the names. Gelli used a variety of techniques to obtain new members and increase the power of P2. One of them was the innocuous method of personal contact and introduction from an already existing member. Others were le ss tasteful. Blackmail was the most prevalent. When a \"target\" joined P2, he was obliged to demonstrate loyalty by placing at Gelli's disposal documents that would compromise not only himself but also other possible targets. Confronted with the evidence of their own misdeeds, these new targets also joined P2. This tec hnique was used, for example, on the president of ENI (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, the state oil company), Giorgio Mazzanti. Shown the evidence of his own cor- ruption concerning proposed huge bribes and payoffs on a pend- ing Saudi oil deal, Mazzanti caved in and joined P2, bringing to Gelli even more compromising information. Another technique Gelli used to obtain a new member was to ascertain from already corrupted s ources the short list of candi- dates for important jobs. He woul d then telephone these candidates, announcing to each that he intended to fix it for him. Naturally, one of the candidates would be hi red, and Gelli would then have a very grateful new member of P2.

Another error typically made by anti-Masons is the assumption that Freemasonry is based on the writings of a single individu al. They usually pick Al- bert Pike as the official \"spokesman\" of Freemasonry. Although it clearly violat es the Landmarks of Masonry to adopt the religi ous views of one man as \"the\" view of the Craft, some Masons have said that Albert Pike speaks for the whole Craft. Thus anti-ma- sons can hardly be faulted for using the strange be- liefs of Albert Pike to attack Masonry. We will deal with Pike later on in our study. Two notable anti-masonic frauds deserve special notice. The Norton Affair An orthodox Jew by the name of Jacob Norton petitioned the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to re- move the obvious Christian elements in Freemasonry such as references to St. John, the cross, the Cru- sades, etc. The Grand Lodge naturally refused to alter any- thing in the Rite. In great bitterness, Norton resigned from the Craft and attacked it by making false and misleading statements concerning the history of the Lodge and its teachings. The amazing thing is that Norton's misinforma- tion was accepted as genuine by subsequent masonic writers such as Rollins, Hughan and Gould. They did not know that they were basing their work on the writings of an antl-mason! 19 They were basing their - conclusions on Norton's fantasies. The Luciferian Conspiracy Of all the attacks against the Craft, none is so vicious as the charge that Masons are a secret cult of Devil worshipers or Satanists and that at some point in the higher degrees th ey must pass thorough a Lu- Opening Principles 11 ciferian initiation. When most Masons hear of a \"Luciferian con- spiracy\" in Freemasonry, they simply shrug it off in the belief that no one would seriously entertain such a scurrilous charge. Since most Masons in the U.S. are members of Christian Churches and many clergymen belong to the Fraternity, the idea that they are all involved in some kind of devil cult is absurd. Can anyone seri- ously think that such 33rd degree Masons as Senator Jesse Helms, the Christian champion of conservative politics, is a worshiper of Lu cifer? Or, that one of the most well known evangelists in the world is a Lucif- erian because he is a 33rd degree Mason? It would be helpful to pause and consider the origin of the Luciferian charge. One of the most interesting episodes in the his- tory of Freemasonry is the anti-masonry movement spawned in 19th Century France by one Leo Taxil. 20 What is known about Taxil does not endear him to the bosom of anyone. He was thrown out of a Catholic seminary before he took holy orders. Al- though the exact cause for his expulsion is not known, the result is. As a reaction, he became a rav- ing atheist, an anti-Catholic and anti-cleric. He spent his time printing scandalous stories of the sexual crimes of priests, monks and nuns. He was quite adept at making up stories when needed. He joined the masonic L odge as another way to thumb his nose at the clergy. He was welcomed at first because French Masonry has always been in- fected with skeptics, anti-c lerics and revolutionaries. But not long after, Taxil's lies and fabrications caused him to be thrown out of the Lodge. He now became as zealous an anti-mason as he was anti-Catholic.

Next, came the discovery from Masonic sources that numerous Catholics down through the centuries have been Masons. Finally, it was discovered that ex -Catholics had been disturbed by the contradictions of Masons being in the Catholic church leadership. Although my specialty is not the study of the inner workings of Catholicism, and I may not have every single detail correct, there are too many legitimate sources that clearly indicate the fact that the Catholic Church w ill be a fundamental part of the Masonic New Age 1-World-Religion not to accept this. Not only are there theolo gical and religious tie- ins since Vat. II, but the Catholic Church also has numerous economic and political connections to the 1-World-Power.

My formulae will be to try compress the story and provide the framework of documentation and sufficient references for the history given so that the reader may be introduced to what has transpired. ILLUMINED MASTER JOACHIM OF FLORIS The idea of illuminism is an old one. One of the earliest Catholic scholars to adopt illuminism was Joachim of Floris. Joachim of Floris in the eleventh century was heavily influenced by Jewish apocalyptic th ought and under the veil of being Christian began a group of \"Illuminated Ones.\" A number of the ideas that this Illumined Master Joa chim of Floris held, can be seen to have resurfaced with certain Adventists, such as Charles Taze Russell, among others. Joach im of Floris believed a new race of s piritual or enlightened ones would take control of the world. This view is now echoed in hundreds of religious groups today. One of his ideas that of viewing the days of Rev. 12 as equalin g a year was picked up by C.T. Russell. Thomas Aquinas attack ed that view in Summa Theologia (part 3, \"Supplement,\" p. 77, art. 1 & 2). 1 "},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"The Illuminated Ones we re very sucessful in various ways to discredit Christian ity and establi sh their own age nda. They have worked quietly through d ifferse groups, and it has taken centuries for the fulfillment of the Plan, which various Illumined ones call \"the Divine Plan.\" The advancement of technology has greatly added to the fulfillment of the goals. Some of the greatest advancements in technology have come through Illumined minds such as Thomas Edison (who was both Jewish and a Rosicrucian), and Nikola Tesla who were friends and co-work ers. Edison's daily associate was the Freemason George E. Stringfellow. 2 Everett W. Frazar was a Freemason who worked at Edison's lab. HOW A PERSON IS ILLUMINED? The Illumined Ones receive their illumination through various channels which co rrespond incidenta lly to the Hindi forms of salvation. Drugs, dance s, channeling, ritua ls, and intuitive knowledge are methods to be enlightened or illumined. These types of activities have ch aracterized the Mys tery Schools si nce Ancient Egypt, Ancient India, and Ancient Babylon. Chr istianity would call illumination under many circ umstances \"demon possession.\" Nikola Tesla was quite open that his achieveme nts (and some have called him the \"greatest inventor\" ever) came from intuitive knowledge. 3 Other scientists have also received their ideas from some outside source of illumination. The Illumined Ones stand in oppositi on to Christ and his teachings. Christ b elieved he was the Truth, and the Light. He taught that no one could come to the Heavenly Father except through him. Illuminism teaches disodedience to our Creator God, because it believes men can be come Gods. This my sticism has worked to destroy all the normal aspects of a uthority and to glorify Lucifer. This it has done, under many masks. If the Illuminati goals of destruction of family, nation, and Christianity along with the esta blishment of a 1-world-government were to be achieved, then the largest religious body, the Catholic Church would have to be included. The capture of the Roman Catholic Church is one of their crowning achievements. CABALISTIC JEWS Illumined Cabalist Jews infiltrated Catholicis m over the Middle Ages. Pope Leo X (Giovann i de' Medici of Flore nce- Pope from 1513- 21) was interested in the Kaballah. The de Medicis have been a powerful family in Italy. This family p rovided several Popes including Leo XI, Clement VII, and Leo X. The Merovingian Dynasty provided Pope Stephen IX. Jewish literature today brags about how the Marranos in Spain were able on a large scale to pretend to ac cept Catholicism. 4 Actually, the Catholic Church set itse lf up for what happened. To give a specific example, that is re presentative of what took place in Catholic Europe, the city of Toledo may be presented. Todelo was one of the main centers of Illuminism. 5 On May 24, 1485 the Spanish Inquisition ca me to Toledo. A Time of Grace was given to the Jews to convert before violence would start. It appears that 3,000 Seph ardic Jews became \"co nversos\" during the periods of Grace given them. 6 It is likely that the Toledo"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":" Fig. J EWISH C ABBALIST HOLDING THE S EPHIROTIC T REE Paulus Ricius, Porta Lucis kac est porta tetragrammaton, justi intrabunt per eam (Augsburg, 1516)."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"population was between 15,000 and 18,000 in 1486. 7 Upwards of 20% of Toledo's population was Sephardic (that is genetically related to Judea and Palestine), and many were prominent citizens. These Sephardic Jews had to march in groups of 500 to 750 person in procession through Toledo's streets to the cathedral and publicly confess their sins. Then they were \"disabled\", that is prohibited in some ways to cramp their style, such as prohibited to hold certain offices and to drink alcohal. The strength of these prohibitions can be seen in that many soon regained their old offices, in spite of the prohibitions. 8 The real effect was to make many Jews who were into the Cabala become Catholic in name, and to hide their Jewishness. Many changed their last names, and by some coincidence almost all key public records have disappeared, making it difficult to trace and positively identify who were Jews back then. The Quietism of Spain which included Michael de Molinos was associated with Illuminism. 9 CATHOLIC ROYALTY LOOKS TO JEWS Catholic Royalty during the Middle Ages often turned to the Jews for help. The Jews became the court astrologers and magicians. Because Christians were prohibited from taking any interest on money, in general only the Jew s were into money-lending (see chapter 3.2). When Kings and Princes needed money for their wars or extravagances, they went to the J ewish moneylenders. 10 Catholic Europe's trade with Cathay (China) was con trolled by the Jews, 11 and so were the Italian banks which resulted. 12 Marco Polo wrote in his book in 1286 about how the Jews controlled trade with Cathay (China) as well as having political power there, and how they operated the trade routes between the Kingdom of Franks in France and Cathay and India. (I n China, the only Jewi sh community to hold onto its identity up to modern times was in Kaifeng.) Again, history shows how the Catholics s et themselves up to be controlled by the Jews. This author has read Jewish boasts that they are superior to the gentiles, and therefore d eserve to rule the wo rld. In the tug-of- war between the Jews and Catholics, the Jews have exhibited shrewdness. RABBINICAL JUDIASM The Pharisees secretly perpetuated the Caballa (also spelled Kaballa, Qabbala, etc.), an ancient occult gnosticism from Babylon, this is what is known as Rabbinical Judiasm. The Illumination, magic, and astology that made up the Babylonian religion were continued under its present name today Rabbinic Judaism. Repackaged again as New Age teachings it is seeping into the Christian churches. The Catholic Church viewed the Jews as a special threat, but their response in some ways was improper, misguided and inadequate. The best evidence concerning the Catholic Church's fear concerning the Jews exposes two major threats to Catholicism. The Jews were protecting a secret blo od line to enthr one a new Messiah (the lineage is the Merovingian lineage that the Prieure de Sion has preserved--see the index for more information on the Prieure de"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Sion), and the complete Talmud, which became available at the time of Luther's challenge, clearly promoted the destruction and subjugation of the Gentiles by the Jewish people. 13 (It is difficult now to find complete the complete Talmud. Even the partial translations paraded as complete translations are not numerous. ) The top leaders of Catholic Church reacted to the first threat by trying to destoy blood lines and by keeping the subject quiet. 14 Concerning the Talmud, the Catholic Church tried to burn it out of existence. The Talmud was burned in 1244 in Paris and subsequently in other cities. THE BLOODLINE & THE CRUSADES As is often the case, motivations can be complex. The Crusades were the Catholic Church's response to the horrible conquests by the Moslems. As has often been the case, the Catholic Church has often been her own worst enemy. According to one ex-Priest the Catholic Church had h elped financ e Mohammed. 15 Mohammed gained much of his religious knowledge from Nestorian Christianity which pervaded that area of the world. If all that isn't enough to confuse the issue, it appears that the Catholic Pope was prompted to start the Crusades by the secret blood line considering themselves to be the lineage of King David and Jesus Christ. Using Catholic power they hoped to gain Palestine which they considered historically theirs. 16 THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS The Knights Templars became a visible military monk order of this bloodline, which anticipated that when the timing was right, a new Kingdom of David would be proclaimed. The Knights Templars increased in power until they were one of the dominant powers in Europe, but the intervention by t he King of France, with the Pope's cooperation upset their time table. The Knights Templars were arrested in France. In order to survive in Spain and Scotland, they took on a low profile. In Germany, they evolved into the Teutonic Knights. In Spain and Portugal, they became the Order that sent out the Jewish 17 captain known as Christoper Columbus. Columbus sailed with the Templar's Order's Red Cross logos on his sails. Well- known pictures of his ships display this. The Rosy Cross- the Red Cross will reappear in other scenarios connected with secret societies. Undercurrents of the occult seem to never cease. Lorenzo de' Medici, who was a distinguished Platonist and a patron of secret societie s, and a member of the b lack nobility, is said by some to have helped Columbus with the connections to sail. 18 Columbus is said by several histori ans to have been from Greece. 19 Even if Columbus was of Jewish herit age and from Greece, the records show he was firmly co mmitted to a strong display of Catholicism. Even more plausible than his Jewi shness is the strong connection that seems certain between Columbus and secret societies. (Even his signature is a cipher.) THE ORDER OF JESUITS"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"The Order of Jesuits gave the Illuminists a secret channel to subvert the Catholic church. Note for instance that the famous Illuminati of Bavaria were created at the Jesuit College at Ingolstadt, Bavaria. Adam Weishaupt, who founded this branch of Illuminati was a Jewish Jesuit professor. Also note that Ignaz Aurelius Fessler (1756-1839), who received a Jesuit education at Raab, Hungary started a Masonic group in Russia in the early nineteenth century called the \"Illuminati\" or \"hateful revolutionaries.\" 19a Again another Jesuit example is Francisco Calvo (1820-1890). Calvo was a Jesuit priest. Calvo was a 33° Mason. He obtained a Scottish Rite charter from Spain, and organized the Scottish Rite in Costa Rica. 19b (The President of Costa Rica 1847-49, D r. Jose Maria Castro, wa s also a co-founder of the Scottish Rite in Costa Rico.) The mystic St. Ignatius of Loyola founded the Order of Jesuits. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. XVI, printed in 1914 with the approval of the Pope's cen sor and Imprimatur, Ignatius of Loyola and St. John of Avila were brought before an Inquistion council concerning links to the Illuminati in Spain (the Alumbrados). 20 This Catholic source also states that the Illuminati believed that they could become \"the essense of God.\" And that the highest perfection was in the elimination of all activity, and for the self to be absorbed into God. For them carnal desires and actions are not sinful and can be engaged in. What the article describes as Illuminati beliefs are what is known as Hinduism. ILLUMINATI GOALS For those who have not studied the Illu minati, and their goals, let us review a summary of their tenets. 1. Abolition of monarchies and all ordered governments 2. Abolition of private property and inheritances 3. Abolition of patriotism and nationalism 4. Abolition of family l ife, and the insti tution of marriage, and the establishment of communal education of children by the state. 5. Abolition of religion , except illumination, which is based on the occult belief man can become God. 21 WEISHAUPT'S JEWISH BACKER'S Behind Adam Weishaupt was a man named Nicolai who had established in Berlin a literary group to propogate Illuminism. Nicolai in turn was suppo rted by Lessing and Mendelsohn. The Mason Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729-1781 ), the founder of modern German literature, gave his support to this anti-Chri stian Nicolai and his literary endeavors. Also one learns in the memoirs of Moses Mendelssohn, that he was behind the efforts of Nicolai. Moses Mendelssohn was part of the International Jewish Kahal (world government). 22 Moses Mendelsohn (aka Moses Dessau) was impressed by the Jewish thinker Maimonides (who taught Millenialism) and the Mason Locke who taught the importance of human reason. 23 "},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"It was not long before the Rothschilds and other influential Jews added their support to Adam Weishaupt's Bavarian Illuminati. In that day, the Jewish communities were all linked, Often their secret communicat ions only needed to be written in Hebrew letters, because outside of so me scholars that was enough of a code to keep messages fairly secure. The anonymous author of Witchcraft and the Illuminati, perhaps borrowing from Dr. Tom Berry's The Illuminati, says that Adam Weishaupt got some of his occult books, the Major Keys of Solomon, the Lesser Keys of Solomon, and the Kabbalah from the Rothschilds. Whether this is accurate or not the author hasn't confirmed. However, it is accura te that the Rothschil ds did get involved.(For more about them see Chap. 3.3.) Most of the groups that have beco me illuminated, are not called Illuminati. One of the principles of the Illuminati as revealed in the paperwork confiscated by the Bavarian Police was that all Illuminati groups had orders to con ceal the very existence of their groups, and if known at all to represent t hemselves as unimportant philanthropic movements. 24 The leaders of these various groups would each get to play roles in t he coming planned illumination of the world. (And they have.) While the Catholic Church has appeared to be a bulwark against Masonry and Illuminism, it has not been exempt from their penitration. Historian Nesta Webster in his book World Revolution seems to desire to limit the involvement of the Jesuits, although he does report that two of the first recruits of Weishaupt were ex- Jesuits. Weishaupt attributes his own description of their code of conduct \"der Zweck heiligt die Mittel\" (the end sanctifies the means) to the Jesuits. Various Catholic and Jesuit works verify this as a Jesuit attitude. 25 John Robison whose gives an excellent picture in his Proofs of a Conspiracy of the various people who used the Masonic Lodge for devious purposes, indicates in several places that the early Masonic Lodges were used by the Jesuits. \"At this time [after King James had fled to France ] also the Jesuits too k a more active hand in Free Masonry than ever. They insinuated themselves into the English Lodges...At this time changes were made in some of the masonic symbols, particularly in the tracing of the Lodge, which bear evident marks of Jesuit interference.\" 26 By adept use of old rivalries, those desiring to create a One- World-Government have played off their rivals against each other, and sneaked in and captured the remains. This movement is what Robison in 1798 called the Cosmopolitan movement. Cosmos is greek for world and Polls is a city, henc e, Cosmopolitan in Robison's use means Citizenship of the World. The most zealous cosmopolitans or 1-Worlders in Robison's day were the Loge des Chevaliers Bienfaisants at Lyons. Remember, it was from Lyons that the Scottish Rite travelled to the Americas. That Lodge's Grand Masters were Duc de Chartres, the next Orleans, and aft er him Ph. Egalite. The Paris and Strasbourg lodges among others were daughter lodges from Lyons. 27 "},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE CATHOLIC STRONGHOLDS WEAKENED Poland, because it was such a geopolitical asset of the Catholic church, was destroyed as a nation by the Masons. 28 The French Revolution, planned by the Illuminati through several secret societies like the J acobins wiped out the Catholic clergy without mercy. After the French Revolution, Napoleon and his four brothers, who were also Freemasons, 29 continued to break the Roman Catholic Church's power. Napoleon broke the temporal power of the Pope. Napoleon also seized and carted off to Paris almost all the Vatican's archieves, wher e fraternal scholars from several secret orders began examining them. (More about this later. ) If this wasn't enough the Masons Mazzini and Garib aldi led a revolution in Italy and installed a Masonic government. After Masonry conquered France, Grand Mast er and Illuminatus Lafayette directed th e Mason Bernardo O'Higgin s and Simon Bolivar to revolt in South America against Catholic Spain. Likewise he encouraged Juarez to rev olt against Spain in Mexico. Since then the Masons like Mason and President Diaz of Mexico 30 have held sway over Catholic Mexico. The Mexican governmen t has often been anti- Catholic. 31 Mexico has been a confusion of com peting Lodge systems. These various revolutions were intended and suceeded in curtailing the Catholic Church's power. THE SECRET BLACK POPE & \"THE COMPANY\" The Jesuit control of the Catholic Church is known to some. In Italy, the Jesuit Master General is called the Black Pope because they realize how mu ch power the Gr and Master wields. Every Catholic country has at some time expelled t he Order because it wields its own power. 32 The Order is also called by the Jesuits themselves \"the Company.\" In understanding the mechanisms of power within the Catholic Church, and the Catholic Church's leverage on world events it is crucial to know what the Jesuits are about. However, in modern times there often hasn't bee n any difference between the white and black Popes. A big exception was on Oct. 5, 1978 when Pope John Paul I replace d Master General Arupe with his personal delegate Paolo Dezza. 33 According to Dr. Alberto R. Rivera, who claims he was a Jesuit Priest, he was shocked when he learned in the early 1960's that his Jesuit Master General, he ad of all Jesuits, w as a Freemason and had close ties to the Illuminati in London. 34 One reason it was so shocking was that the Jesui t priests were being taught to regard the Freemasons as enemies. (Dr. Rivera is a controversial person, a letter written to him by this Author asking for clarification or confirmation of his story was never answered.) ILLUMINATI PLANS FOR WORLD DOMINATION Before W.W. I, none of those who designed plan s for a One-World- Government display any sen se of urgency . Nothing in the state of the world demanded a One-World-Government. The reason was that in the era prior to W.W. I nationalism was working beautifully. Europe, with only some minor exce ptions like the Franco-Prussia War had enjoyed peace. Travel throughout Europe was unrestricted, and a person without a passport could t ravel all over Europe with the new ease that railroads were providing. Post-millenialists were in"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"large supply. They felt assured that events would continue improving until the earth would become a paradise. However, illuminated plans had long been in the making to create conflict, in order to bring into being a world-wide popular desire for a world state. GRAND ORIENT MASONRY The Grand Orient Masonry bec ame illuminated in 1789. In 1860, the Grand Orient lodges established comm unism, which is a step in the implementation of Illuminati goals. 35 The Jewish Masons Marx and Engels wer e prominant in the cr eation of communism. Mazzini was even more influential. Marx even in 1848 knew of a coming world war, which would destroy reactionary dynas ties and what he called \"riffraff\" peoples such as the Slavic races. The two most powerful Masons of that time, Albert Pike and Mazzini wrote of the coming World Wars. It was Mazzini perhaps who proposed that it woul d take three world wars to destroy the worl d's love for nati onalism, and to insure the people would demand a One-World-Govern ment. A letter written in 1871 and sent to v arious Masonic Lodges (one found its way into the London Museum) explains how three world wa rs were to be created to bring in a World-government. WORLD WAR I What instruments were us ed to bring about World War I? The Freemasons and the Order of Jesuit s. The Freemasons were involved in the asassinati on of the Archduke, 36 which touched off a chain of reactions. The Jesuit influence on the Austria-Hungarian empire egged them into taking punitive measures against Serbia. 37 The Vatican threw their support behind the Cent ral Powers hoping to see their enemies, the Orthodox Chuch in Russia and the Balkins, the English, and the uncooperative French government taken care of. The Vatican's ancient fear of its old rivalries gave the Illuminated groups an easy button to push. WORLD WAR II The forces the Vatican ha d hoped would win wer e crushed, and the Vatican reacted predictably with new power moves. The Catholic church was losing power f ast in Europe. The Fascism of Mussolini was the answer to the problem in Italy. Th e Catholic Church threw its support behind Hitler. 38 Here, we find an alliance between the Catholic Church bent on protecting her position and the occult. Nazism was different from Mussolini's Faci sm in that it was the embodiment of the New Age Occultic religion that the Secret Societies had been planning to establish. 39 Hitler gave the Catholic Church great power, but had he won, his ultimate plans were to contol and remake Catholicism for his New Age religion. 40 \"Hitler spoke of the German mission to protect Christian Europe against Bolshevik Asiatic hordes. But this was only political propaganda, as the Nazis were no more Christian than the persecuting emperors of the Roman Empire or Stalin's satraps; four thousand Roman Catholic priests and monks and probably as many other dedicated leaders and laymen of the Lutheran and other"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Protestant Churches were killed...for resisting the pagan Nazi views and brutalities.\" 41 The Vatican was manipulated into thinking that Hitler and Mussolini would bring them what they wanted. Both Hitler and Mussolini gave the Catholic Church extensive benefits that boosted her waning temporal strength. 42 Another agreement gave the Catholic Church the exclusive privilege to follow the Nazi Armies into Russia and convert the Russians. 43 Actually, the Catholic efforts seem to have been counter productive in some ways, for they set up the Second World War that the Illuminated Ones had been wanting. Britian and Russia secretly manipulated Hitler into war. 44 Hitler's thinking made him quite easy to manipulate. The three Freemasons who led the three most powerful nations Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill, all Freemasons, got the war that had been planned. They secretly used the war to further Illuminated plans in many ways. 45 The Catholic Church hoped the Nazis would wipe out a Secret Order that believed they were the blood lineage of Jesus Christ. This lineage was called the Holy Grail. Its secret elimination would destroy a potent rival to the Catholic Church. The Nazis hoped to use the Holy Grail for the ir own use, and sought not just the blood lineage but the Grail cup that stood for the lineage. Masonry (especially the Mizraim Rite, but also the Scottish Rite) is intimately connected to the preservation of that Holy Lineage. THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ORTHODOX JEWS Two Orthodox Jews have come out wit h shocking evidence in their books Perfidy and The Holocaust Victims. What their evidence indicates is that the Zionist and Reform Jews sacrificed the Orthodox Jews of Europe. More and more Orthodox Jews are writing books and telling the truth of their betrayal by the Zionist Jews who were in positions of power. Malkeil Greenwald, a Holocaust researcher, discovered that a certain high ranking Israeli Official named Rudolph Kastner was directly responsible for the slaughter of one million Hungarian Orthodox Jews. Further, it turns out that the emigration bureaucracy of the Third Reich was r un by Zionist Jews. There fore, the Roth schilds and other Jews of the Reformed variety got out, the Orthodox were abandoned. Powerful Reformed Jews in nations like the US, encouraged the prohibitions on Orthodox Jews immigrating before W.W.II to safety. It could be said that Jewish power was strong enough to get Roosevelt elected, but not strong enough to raise a protest to get Orthodox Jews out Germany, when Hitler tried to expel the Jews and no country would take them. Jewish author David S. Wyman, in The Abandonment of the Jews writes on pages 198 and 199, \"The (Jewish) Emergency Committee worked almost alone for the passage (through our Congress) of the Rescue Resolution. Zionist leaders, acting through the American Jewish Conference, even hampered its progress...[Stephen] Wise had based his testimony on policy set by Zionist leaders of the American Jewish Conference. This group, which include d Wise, Abba Hillel Si lver, Naham Goodman, Herman Shulman, and Babbi Irving Miller, had taken sounding in"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Congress and must have realized that pressing the Palestine issue could not help the Rescue Reso lution and might jeopardize it. Whether they intended to undermine the legislation is not entirely clear. \" On page 200 we read 'The Emergency Committee, parts of the Jewish Press, and even one prominent Zion ist, Rabbi Meyer Berlin, publicly accused Zionist leaders of internatio nly obstructing the Rescue Resolution,... Senator Gillette , a dedicated friend of Zionism, candidly discussed the obstruc tion he encountered from Zionist leaders: 'These people used every effo rt, every means at their disposal, to block the Resolution...[They] tried to defeat it by offering an amendment to it that would rais e the guestion, the controversial guestion of Zionism or anti-Zionism...or anything else that would bl ock the action th at we were seeking.\" In 1985, a Zionist Jew wrote The Abandonment of the Jews. This book, written from a Zionist perspecti ve actually st ates the truth, that the Zionists made a decision to concentr ate on the creation of the nation of Israel rath er than try to save the Orthodox Jews in Europe. \"...On the debit side, Zionist insistence on committing the (Jewish Rescue) Conference to a Je wish Commonwealth in Palestine, a post-war objective, ended the chance f or a united Jewish action on the immediate issue of rescue...The unavoidable conclusion is that during the Holocaust the leadership of American Zionism concentrated its major for ce on the drive for a future Jewish state in Palestine. It consigned rescue of the Jews to a distinctly secondary position...\" This information clears up several points. First, it explains why the Jewish International Financiers would finance Hitler. They were trying to destroy their rivals the Orthod ox Jews and to create the conditions necessary for World and Jewish enthusiasm for a Jewish takeover of Palestine. They were also moving th e world toward the Power's objective, the One-World religion of Masonry. The Orthodox Jews can be as fixed on the Bible's morality as the Christians. It explains the actions of Chur chill and Roosev elt too toward the plight of the Orthodox Jews. It coincides in spirit with some of the other things that the Reform Jews have done to the Orthodox Jews since W.W. II. Reformed Judiasm and the Illuminati have been actively working on the destruction of the J ewish people's morals and Bible convictions. They have been do ing this for centuries. A Jewish author not long ago described the subversi on of a Polish town in a histo rical novel Satan in Goray. The scene is in Poland in 1665. The book is based upon the subversion that took place within various Jewish communities as Illuminated ones of the Satanic Jewish Sabbatianism Sect began to destroy the Jewish morals. One offspring of Sabbatianism was called the Frankists and they were the core group which started up the Illuminati in Germany. Some Rabbis tried to stop the Oriental Pantheism of these Kabalistic Jews, their Magic, and the lewd paganism that the Sabbatai were introducing, but it was a losing battle. Today, psychiatrists, our primary recognized authorities on people, are"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"taught principles that are derived from the teachings of the Satanic Sabbatai. Freud took his ideas from the Zohar and some of the ideas of the Sabbatai. It might surprise some people that Freud got his ideas from the Satanic Jewish sect of Frankist-Illuminati. The depraved behavior of the Frankist-Illuminati was the beginning of what has become the everyday perversions of the ungodly American Society. Psychiatrists using Freud's teachings have been granted unquestioned power over many people lifes. WHO WAS ADOLF HITLER? The author of the book The Mind of Adolf Hitler gives evidence that Hitler was the grandson of Baron Rothschild of Vienna. A secret document prepared by the Austrian police after an investigation of the Hitlers done under the orders of Austrian Chancellor Dolfuss revealed that Hitler's grandmother Maria Anna Shicklgruber was in Vienna working as a servant for Baron Rothschild when she conceived. When the Rothschilds discovered her pregnancy she was sent to her hometown in Spital where Alois (the father of Adolf) was born. 46 Adolf Hitler ordered his own investigation into his roots. He directed his private lawyer Hans Frank to investigate his paternal lineage. Frank reported back that his grandmother had become pregnant while working as a domestic live-in servant for a Jewish household in Graz, Austria. After this point, Hitler came to believe that he was related to the Rothschilds. 47 The Swastika was at the Catholic abbey school Adolf Hitler attended at Lambach. It was the heraldic sign of the abbey's administrator Father Hagen. 48 Hitler very early showed an interest in magic, theosophy, and the occult. POST WORLD WAR II The Catholic Church after the war naturally continued her crusade against communism. This was fine because the Illumined Ones wanted a Cold War. The final step was when the Cold War was to be dismantled and a New World Order created, they would have to step in and actually control the Catholic Church rather than manipulate it. By using the fear of Communism, the CIA was able to infiltrate the Catholic Church. An outlawed Masonic Lodge system called P2 working with the CIA gained control of Italy and the Vatican, although the reg ular Masonic lodges h ave also gained large power within the Catholic hierarchy. 49 It is at this point that this bo ok will now zoom in and focus in on, to cover the details of how the great Roman Catholic Church became another New Age religion.

When needed these su bchapters will be broken down into sections. For those readers who are unfamiliar with the Catholic Popes the list of Popes since the first Pope to forbid Freemasonry is given with the date they became Pope. Subchapter 1.

Whether the reader is Catholic or not, he will be aware that the Catholic church has always had enemies. That some of these enemies would choose subversion and secret organizations is of no surprise. However, those that were opposed to the Catholic church because of its moral deficiences and corruptions were not the ones that were willing to be totally amoral to fight the Church. It was not the reformers, but those that wanted to destroy all vestiges of Christianity that were the most dangerous. The Jews had adopted and codified in the Talmud, the worst moral perversions, not even the Catholic Church could tolerate Talmudic Jewish morals. The Talmud instructs the Jews to commit every sin possible against the Goyim (the Gentiles). In numerous obligatory passages it also promotes amongst the Jewish people themselves child rape (Sanhedrin 55a & b, 69b, 76a, Kethuboth lib), sex with animals (Footnote to Sanhendrin 55a), and a host of other practices called \"wicked\" by Christians. This is why the Catholic Church tried to stamp out the Jews—be cause they practiced disgusting pervertions that were codified in the Talmud. The Catholic Church very early on felt that one of their bitterest enemies were the Kabalistic Jews, a nd the Catholic Church from the public beginnings of Masonry felt that her Jewish enemies were behind the lodges."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Likewise, the Protest ants Reformers felt m ost threatened by such people too, not out of rac ial prejudice, but be cause they were so destructive to all morals. Calvin and those who ruled Geneva burned Servetus at the stake because he was against what the Church stood for--they weren't burning Catholics, because in the eyes of the Protestants the Catholics weren't challenging th e basic tenets of the Scripture. 50 Surely there were t imes that racial prejudice came into affairs, but the my thical image that the Jews were persecuted down through history because of their race, doesn't hold up historically. Christians are ignorant that the Talmud advises \"Even the best of Goim (gentiles) should be killed.\" (Abhodah Zarah --26b, Tosephoth). The Jewish controlled Media is not going to expose such terrible Jewish racism, but they have put out shows on TV blaming Christians for the Holocaust. From the beginning the Rosicrucians and Freemasons employed Jewish symbolism and Jewish Kabalistic magic. The theme of the Masons from the be ginning was the Rebuilding of S olomon's Temple. The temple in Jerusalem had been destroyed according to Christ's prophecy. The rebuilding of the Jewish Temple was a Jewish hope-- that slowly over the years has been adopted by the Christians. Clement XII in 1738 condemned Freem asonry and asked Catholics to leave it and not join. Ignoring the Pope's edicts, the Catholic Duke of Norfolk served as Grand Master of the English Masons, and the Catholic Viscount Montagu (who was a key player for the Power), and who was head of the English Cat holics also served as the Grand Master of England's Mason ic Lodges from 1772-77. 51 The Masonic Lodges became hot houses for every anti-religious sentiment. Within a few years of the public appearance of the Masonic Lodges, the governments of Europe were teeming with Masons. The Marquis de Pombal, royal adviser in Portugal; the Count de Aranda, royal adviser in Spain; Minister de Tillot and the Due de Choiseul in France, Prince von Kaunitz and Gerard von Swieten at the Habsburg court in Vi enna, Austria were some of these prominent Masons in high government positions . They addressed each other as \"Brothers of the Pyramid and advo cated the overthrow of Christian organizations. \" 52 On July 21, 1773, the Pope abolished the Order of Jesuits. Interestingly, Frederick the Great of Prussia, one of the most important and dedicated Masons that has lived and a homosexual, protected the Jesuits in order to use their services against the Pope, and the Bourbons. Is it st range then, that soon afterwards, the Illuminati arose in Jesuit areas, yet appeared not to be connected with the Jesuits? Heckethorn and other writers have noted the close connection between Masonic rituals and Jesuit initiations and rites. 53 Within a few years the French Revolution, a product of Illumined Masonry, broke the Papacy 's control over France. Napoleon, a great Freemason, continued the Revolution in the name of \"Liberte, egalite, fraternie\" that is \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.\" Napoleon proceeded to completely break the Papacy. He arrested Pope Pius VI. Contrary to the advice of other Masons he allowed him to live, but was slow to replace him with another Pope when he died."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Napoleon permitted Pius VII to become Pope. But Pius VII and him didn't get along, and Pius VII ended up arrested. Napoleon treated him according to Cath olic sources \"brut ally\" and forced him to sign away more papal power. When Napoleon saw his position in Europe smashed by the Allied armies, he released the Pope. In 1814 in one Pius VII first acts after release he reinstated the Jesuits. 54 During these years of the Pope's captivity, the Masons controlled the Catholic Church. What all they did behind the scenes to the Catholic church would be interesting to know. They did haul the Vatican's archieves to Par is. What is interesting is that they have not revealed whatever great secrets they must have learned from those archieves. It can be assumed that perhaps they kept these secrets for blackmail , or to release when to their maximum benefit. (These are not the only historical secrets that the Freemasons are guarding.) Charles T. Russell saw the capture of the Pope by Napoleon as the turning point in history. He may be correct. Apparently, Freemasonry through the Jesuit leadership and other of their men, have had some control or influence over the Catholic Church since that time period. As we will witness in our next subsection, the Catholic Church m ay have forbidden Freemasonry but the records show that many Catholics, especially revolutionaries from Catholic countries, continued their affiliation with the church after joining Freemasonry in spite of the bans. Subsection 2. Pius IX, the first verifiable Mason to become Pope. After the Masons had comp letely captured the Catholic Church by the 1960s, they were no longer concerned if p eople would learn that Pius IX had been a Mason. In the New Age, April 1962, p. 17 in an article \"A Pontiff FREEMASON\" An Official Bulletin of the National Grand Orient of Egypt published in Italian and dated Mar, 1876 records a document No. 13,715 bearing the great seal of the Grand Lodge Luce Perpetua of Naples: Masonic Lodge Eterna Catena of Palermo: \"We Master Masons, dignitaries and officials...certify...we have received in this Lodge in the form prescribed by our rituals, and w ith entire conformity to our constitution, the Brother Giovanni Ferretti Mastai... in the profane and civil year 1839, on the fifteenth day of the month of August.\" The article then goes on to discuss how various Masons and various lodges were aware of his me mbership. After he was ordained to the Priesthood, he was appointed Apostolic Delegate in the Uruguay, where he appeared in the Masoni c Lodges. This was even known to \"profane p eople\" (non-Masons). In 18 73, in an epistle Pius IX denounced Freemasonry as originating from the devil. Garibaldi, a 33 degree Mason and others had overthrown the g overnment of Italy and installed a Masonic government. Victor Emmanuel had been made King of Italy, and while he ruled he was also the Grand Master of Masons in Italy. After the Pope denounced Freemasonry, a letter signed by King & G.M. Victor Emmanuel was sent out to the Masonic bodies informing them of the Pope's expulsion from the Masons."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Subsection 3. Leo XIII. The best Anti-Masonic Encyclical. During the administration of this Pope, the Modernist Catholic Movement became active against the traditions of the church. The director Jean-Baptiste Hogan of the Se minary of St. Sulpice in Paris was an important figure in this movement. Various members of this movement were linked to Freemasonry and excommunicated or suspended. In 1884, Pope Leo XIII sent out the strongest and most comprehensive encyclical aga inst the Freemasons that was ever done. The warning comes across as very sincere. As to whether there was a hidden agenda behind heating up the war of wo rds with the Masons, this Author is not aware of any. Occasionally, this Author is asked why the Catholics were against the Masons. (By the way this author is not Catholic. ) Pope Leo XIII answered that well with his encyclical. If any Catholics are reading th is, they are reguested to read this message from Pope Leo XIII. Masonry hasn't changed but your Church isn't warning its pe ople any more. Other r eaders may want to jump over this next part . This condemnation of Freemasonry is so well said that it des erves repeating at le ast in a condensed form. \"THE MASONIC SECT  LEO, POPE, XIII.

They seek skillfully hiding pla ces, assuming the appear ance of literary men or philosophers, associated for the purpose of erudition; they have always ready on their tongues the speech of cultivated urbanity, and proclaim their charity toward the poor; they look for the improvement of the masses, to extend the benefits of social comfort to as many of mankind as possible. Those purposes, though they may be true, yet are no t the only ones. Beside s, those who are chosen to join the society must promise an d swear to obey the leaders and teachers with great resp ect and trust; to be ready to do whatever is told them, and accept death and the most horrible punishment if they disobey. In fact, some who have betrayed the secrets or disobeyed an order are punished with death so skillfully and so audaciously that the murder escaped the investigations of the police. Therefore, reason and truth show that the society of which we speak is contrar y to honesty and natural justice. \"...\"A good tree cannot yield bad fruits, nor a bad tree good ones.\" (Matt, vii.,18) Masonry generates bad fruits mixed with great bitterness. From the evidence above mentioned we find its aim, which is the desire of overthrowing all the religious and social orders introduced by Christianity, and building a new one according to its taste, based on the foundation and laws of naturalism. \"What we have said or will say must be understood of Masonry in general and of all societies, not of the individual members of the same. In their number there may be not a few who, though they are wrong in giving their names to these societies, yet are neither guilty of their crimes nor aware of the final goal which they strive to reach. \"By opening their gates to persons of every creed they promote, in fact, the great modern error of religious indifference and of the parity of all worships, the best way to annihilate every religion, especially the Catholic, which, being the only true one cannot be joined with others without en ormous injustice. \"Those who boldly deny His existence are admitted as well as those who, like the P antheists, admit God but ruin the idea of Him, retaining an absurd caricature of the divine nature, destroying its reality.

This is deplored by ev erybody, and by those who are compelled by evidence and yet would not like to speak so. \"But naturalists and Masons, reject ing divine revelation, deny original sin, and do not acknowledge that our fr ee will is weakened and bent to evil. \"... there have been in the Masonic sect some who openly said and proposed that the multitudes should be urged by all means and artifice into license [promiscuity]... \"For domestic socie ty the doctrin e of almost all naturalists is that marriage is only a ci vil contract, and may be lawfully broken by the will of the contracting parties; the State has power over the matrimonial bond.

Its tenets contradict so evidently human reason that nothing can be more perverted. The desire of destroying the religion and Church established by God, with the promise of immortal life, to try to revive, after eighteen centuries, the manners and institutions of paganism, is great foolishness and bo ld impiety. No le ss horrible or unbearable is it to repudiate the gifts granted through His adversaries. In this foolish and ferocious attempt, one recognizes that untamed hatred and rage of revenge kindled against Jesus Christ in the heart of Satan. \"...The other attempt in which the Masons work so much, viz., to pull down the foundations of morality, and become co-operators of those who, like brutes, would see that become lawful which they like, is nothing but to urge mankind into the most abject and ignominious degradation."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"\"...That the State ought to profess relig ious indifference and neglect God in ruling society, as if God did not exist, is a foolishness unknown to the very heathen, who had so deeply rooted in their mind and in their heart, not only the idea of God, but the necessity also of public worship, that they supposed it to be easier to find a city without any foundation that without any God.

LEO.PP XIII A number of Masons took this en cyclical Humanum G enus as a joke. They have no sense of a fear of God. Someone who would not take this enc yclical as a joke was Father Charles E. Coughlin. 55 Father Coughlin preached over the radio until the Power finally forced him off the air. This independent minded Christian did not follow the lemmings rushing over the abyss, but courageously preached sermon after sermon exposing paganism, satanism, capitalism, communism and all these isms related to Freemasonry. This Catholic Father brought his whole energy and intellect to bear on stemming the tide of Satan his temple Freemasonry. As can be expected the full resources of the Power's press were turned against him. The Detr oit Free Press ran nine days of front page \"yellow journalism\" to destroy his reputation. The IRS \"leaked\" that it was investigating Father Coughlin. 56 The national press made much of abou t Father Coughlin cheating on his income taxes. Actually, the only error found was an error in arithmetic had been made, the Father had overpaid, and the IRS owed Father Coughlin $8.61. 57 (See chapter 3.7 for more on the IRS.) Sadly, while he was defending Christ, his leaders were selling his church out. Subchapter 4. Popes St. Pius X, Benedict XV, and Pius XI St. Pius X took over in 1903. Catholism had some dangerous cracks within its solid looking walls. The International Financiers had the Church at their mercy. They could infiltrate the Church, spy on the church, etc. but they ha dn't moved the church into its role as a major part of the One-World-Religion. Nor had they built up world sympathy for a One-World-G overnment. The Twentieth Century was to be Christendom's attitude ajustment. In 1902, Minister Combes, a former Catholic seminarian and Mason, appointed under the concordant, Father Lacroix bishop of Tarantaise. It was St. Pius who summoned Bishop Lacroix to Rome and forced him to resign. Lacroix's will after his death confirmed that he was a Freemason. Pius XI then proscibed all the ordinations conferred by the Mason bishop be repeated (with conditions). The dissident Leferbrites that have split with mainstream Catholicism trace back their ordinations to that Mason bishop. 58 Their leader Leferbre happens to have recently died in 1990. Pius XI was Pope during the confuse d state of all the political intrigues of the 1930s. There seem to be more questions than"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"answers when one investigates the One-World-Power and its dealings with the Vatican during the 1930s. For instance, the Spanish Civil War seems to have been in part contrived by the In ternational Jews and the New Fasc ist dictators. General Franco and his financial backer, Jaun March, were both Marranos Jews. General Franco was reportedly also a Grand Orient Mason. 59 Peter Wyden reports in Passionate Years that Archivist Victor A. Berch, of Brandeis Univ., had found that 40% of the Lincoln Brigade (volunteers fighting again st General Franco) were Jewish. Perhaps the only sense of this, is to look at the process and not the details. One overall result of the war, was that the Communists secretly stole the Spanish gold reserve of over a billion dollars in gold, and shipped it to Russia. One of the means of transport was the Soviet ship Komsomol that carried the gold and it arrived in Odessa Nov. 2, 1936. The gold was trucked to Moscow's Precious Metals Deposit, Gohkran. 60 The other big result was that Hitler revitalized his military machine, and tested out his new weapons. If the Germans had not been given the opportunity to test their military capabilities, they may have been slower in going to war. A great amount of political manouve ring was taking place. Father Coughlin was trying to warn Catholics of the dangers that were coming, and warning them to vote against Roosevelt. Father Coughlin for years warned people about the M asons. But while he was doing this, Cardinal Pacelli, the Pope's Secretary of State, timed a visit to the U.S. in 1936 that coincided with the elections and gave the appearance of Papal approv al of Roosevelt to the Catholic voters. Pacelli was of Jewish blood (according to Dr. Rivera). As readers may remember, Cardinal Pace lli had negotiated with Lenin on behalf of the Pope; this was according to Avro Manhattan with the view of supplanting the Russian Orthodox Church with the Catholic Church. 61 When Pope Pius XII (Pacelli) took over 1939, because he was a \"compromising man\", the Mason Pres. Roosevelt established diplomatic relations with the Vatican, which had been officially ignored since 1867. The Protestants did not disapprove of this move because it was billed by the media as a step to keep Italy out of World War II which had broken out. The first pers onal ambassador to the Vatican from the U.S. was the millionaire, Episcopalian, and active Freemason Myron C. Taylor (1874-1959). The New York Times, Nov. 6, 1936 records Myron C. Taylor's views of Mussolini. One of the many praises he gave is Taylo r's declaration, \"the whole world has been forced to admire the successes of Premier Mussolini in disciplining the nation.\" At that point, a bond of cooperation between Masons, and the International Financiers and the Vatican can be seen quietly working in the background of history. Commenting on the parallel policies that the U.S. and the Vatican entered into during these years in W.W. II the former French Ambassodor to the Holy See, Francois Charles Roix in the Revue de Paris, Sept. 1946 said, \"few people in Europe were aware of the union which was functioning on a spiritual level between the two forces which were represented in the United States and the Holy See and which...were co-ordinated in each instance that justified joint action.\"(Emphasis added.)"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"This book does not have the space to delve into all the politics and cooperation during these years between the Catholic Church and the One-World-Order, incl uding such groups as the CIA, the Knights of Malta, and MI 6. Let it simpl y suffice here to indicate that there was a lot of ac tivity between the various parties, and a lot of mixing and cooperation . It appears the clos e relationships were mutually beneficial. Perhaps the Catholic Chur ch in some was naive with who they were dealing with, but that is unlikely considering men like Father Coughlin, and others who were giving warnings. Subchapter 5. Pope John XXIII A HUMBLE BEGINNING On a damp rainy day in Sotto il Monte, Ita ly Signora Maria Anna Mazzola Roncalli gave birth to a healthy baby. The cross-mountain wind that the people call tramonta no was slamming through town rattling wooden shutters and forcing rain into the damp houses. It was Nov. 25, 1881, and due to the h igh rate of infant mortality the family followed the church's instructions and went that very same day to the parish church of San Giovanni to have the infant baptized Giuseppe Angelo Roncalli. Later his names were reversed. 62 And later this child as a seventy-seven year o ld man would be known as Pope John XXIII. That name Pope John XXII I is pregnant with meaning. This name that he selected had be en anathematize d because an anti-pope (an imposter) up to 1415 had used it. Since then nobody had dared use it. The name John is very important to the Masons, for the Patron saint of the Freemasons is St. John. Further, a document placed in the National Library in Paris, France prior to to 1956, indicates that a man called John XXIII (Jean Cocteau ) was the Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion, 63 the secret order en trusted with the blood line of the Hous e of David. There was considerable consternation when Roncalli choose the name J ohn XXIII, consider ing that the Anti-Pope who had that same name was known only f or seducing 200 women including his own sister- in-law.(Spearman, Neville. The Broken Cross. Piers Compton, 1983.) EARLY YEARS Due to Masons in the Italian government, Italy entered W.W. I on the side of the Allies fighting the Central Powers. One of Roncalli's first a ssignments in W.W.I was with a medical unit at Bergamo. While there in Mar. 1916, all the priests in the Italian Army were made Chaplains and given the rank of lieutenant. Roncalli was both a nurse and a priest to the shattered bodies that came back from the fr ont. After the defeat at Caporetto, masses of horribly wounded men overflowed the entir e city, and Roncalli worked night and day giving last rites and comfort to dying boys. Later in the spring of 1917, he served at the front moving through the mud and rain among the troops in a cassock stained with blood. 64 "},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Later in life, Roncall i would look back and say, \"I thank God that I was a sergeant and a milita ry chaplain in World War I. How much I learned of the human heart at that time time; how much experience I gained, how gre at the grace I received...\" It is hard to fault him for wanting peace and peace at any price. A letter to hi s brother Severio w ritten from Constantinople, 28 April 1938 reflect s his desire for peace, \"For our own part, let us try to keep the peace with everyone, sp eaking against no one and staying out of politics.\" 65 Exactly what he meant by staying out of politics is hard to grasp, because he himsel f was to use the words of his biographer \"As the Bishop's secretar y, Roncalli was in th e thick of the socio- ecclesiatical politics, which eventually led to the founding of the Italian Christian-Democratic Party. \" 66 But he did try to keep peace with the Jews, as Pope he removed words in the Good Friday liturgy that the Jews disliked, and when speaking to Jews on various occasions called himself a \"brother\" to the Jews. 67 PAPAL NUNCIO & THE ROSE-CROIX Another impact on his lif e was when he went to Turkey in 1935 as Papal nunico. One book in dicates that while in Turkey, he became part of the Rose-Croix (the Rosicrucians). 68 If true, his move after the wa r to represent the Vatican at Paris, France takes on added significance. Paris is a nerve center for Occultic Secret Societies inclu ding the Masons and especially the Rosicrucians. Interestin gly, from 1952 onw ards the permanent observer for the Holy See at UNESCO was Roncalli. 69 UNESCO was as in shown later a Masonic invention designed to promote the New Age religion. During the Second World War, during the occupation of Greece by Italy, Roncalli felt that the Italian occupation was kind and beneficial to Greece. Wr iting to his sister f rom Athens 14 June, 1943 he states that Freemasonry was causing a bad division between Greece and Italy. \"We see how Greece which is orthodox and, because it is dominated by Free masonry, hostile to an ything which might draw it nearer to Italy (not b ecause of national interests but because Italy holds the centre of Catholicism...Oh, Sister Maria, how I dislike politics! and nation alism it is a re al curse for a nation when religion serves as its tool.\" 70 In spite of his lette rs expressing disdain for politics Roncalli was known for his success in deal ing with the Orthodox Church's prelates and the Moslem Turkish government. 71 While he served as a cardinal representing the Vatican in France, across Europe th e CIA was making paym ents to the Masonic Lodges to rebuild them. 72 The CIA was also maki ng large payments to the Catholic Church. Former CIA age nt Victor Marchetti stated: In the 1950s and the 19 60s the CIA gave ec onomic support to many activities promoted by the Catholic Church, from orphanages to the missions. Millions of dollars each year were given to a great number of b ishops and monsignors. One of them was Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini. It is possible that Cardinal Montini did not know where the money was coming from. He may have thought it was coming from friends. 73 "},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Cardinal Montini became Pope Paul VI. He was also at some point a Freemason, and an OSS agent. 74 Even prior to Roncalli becoming Pope John XXIII, Freemasonry had some powerful men in the Vatican. For instance, Cardinal Sebastino Baggio (his Masonic name Seba, in Lodge #85/26 40) was raised into a regular Masonic Lodge on Aug. 14, 1957. 75 Various sources also indicate that the Vatican's foreign minister, at times called the Kissinger of the Vatican, Archbishop Msgr. Agostino Casarolli, was initiated into a r egular Masonic Lodge on September 28, 1957. This Author has studied Pope John XXIII to try to understand who he was, and what made him tick. How sold out was he to secret societies, and their ambitions? There are mixed clues, at this point this Author has the opinion, that Pope John XXIII was guided more by a sincere belief that he was helping promote world peace than any sinister motivation or evil agenda. But if this Pope can be said to have had good int entions, some of his close associates at the Vatican don't appear at all so. VATICAN II Constance Cumbey in her book The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow, p. 160, says, \"If there has been a single Catholic pope who permitted the New Ager's plan to take root within the Roman Catholic Church, it was Pope John XXII I who is spoken of reverently by New Agers and Catholic modernists.\" Vatican II is a hallmark of toleration. It is an edict right in line with Masonic doc trine. For instance, it pronounces salvation to anyone who is good at whatever he is pursuing. Pope John XXIII, who was on record for Lab or groups, not only allowed Catholics to become Masons but ended the chur ch's anti-comm unist stance. Pope John XXIII threw his whole weight into getting Vatican II passed. Some claim the o verwork in doing this speeded up his death. In addressing the Vatican II council prior to it sucessfully passing Vatican I I, John XXIII told them, \"Illuminated by the light of this Council the Church, we confidently trust, will become greater in spiritual riches, gaini ng the strength of new energies from it....Unfortunately, th e entire Christian fa mily has not yet fully attained...unity in truth. The Catholic Church, therefore, considers it her duty to work act ively toward the fulfillment of the great mystery of tha t unity which Jesus invoked with fervent prayer from his heavenly Father on the eve of his sacrifice. . . [The Church] exults greatly at seeing that invocat ion extended... even among those who are outside her f old....Venerable br others, such is the aim of the second Vatican counc il, which, bringing together the Church's best energies.. . prepares and consol idates the path toward that unity of mankind whi ch is required as a necessary foundation in order that the earthly city may be brought to resemble that heavenly city where truth reigns, cha rity is the law and whose extent is eternity.\" 76 There he said it. The goal of Va tican II is the unity of mankind to create a earthly millenium. The key Commission (group) of Vatic an II was the Secretariat of Christian Unity headed by Cardinal Bea. Cardinal Bea was a Grand Master of the Freemasons, and was also a Jesuit and a Jew. His"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"original name was Behar. During the Vatican II meetings he flew back and forth from the Vatican to New York (thought to be those of the One-World-Pow er) to brief these others on what was happening. The Second Vatican Council was anno unced in Jan. 1959, opened in Oct. 1962, and concluded in Dec. 1965. This Author has the entire Vatican II in his library. It is appropriate to clarify that Vatican II does not tamper with the ultimate authority of the Catholic Church but leaves it intact. 7 Authority in the Catholic church is not the protestant \"sola scriptura\" but ultima tely rests with th e church which then states what scripture and tradit ion is. Scripture wit h tradition then is their authority for dogma. Christ the Word of God still speaks, the church believes, in the priestly and papal offices, so that they claim infallibility for Christ's Church. (See the Catholic church's Decree on the Church 1.8, 11.12, 1.2, III.20.) The hierarchy and its power were left untouched. And we will learn more about what that hierarchy is today as we continue to read. In April 1963 Pope John XXIII m oved the Roman Catholic church closer toward a synthesis with comm unism with the document Pacem In Terris which promoted compromise with Communism. Further he neutralised the conservatives by adding 12 new cardinals who favored his views. CATHOLIC GROUPS TO EXAMINE The student of the New World Order will want to keep track of the following secret societi es that involve th e Catholic church. THE ORDER OF KNIGHTS OF MALTA- Connected to the \"Black\" Nobility, this group connects with the Vatican, CIA, the Mafia, the Prieure de Sion, and many of the government s of Latin America. According to one Masonic source this group is also conn ected to Freemasonry. OPUS DEI- A fraternal organization (in some ways secret) started in 1922 which is amassing i ncreasing power within the Catholic Church. This movement is tied to the French Mas onic Grand Orient. 78 THE SOCIETY OF JESUS (JESUITS)- This fraternal Society has long had connections with illumination, and has bee n the cutting edge of the Church's strenth. They nominally owe allegiance to the Pope, but are practically a power unto themselves. The Pope has the power to try to replace the Master General with his own selection like he did with Arupe, but doing that is no assurance of Jesuit compliance. German Novali s said, \"this Society will be an example of every society which feels an organic longing for infinite extension and eternal duration.\" Ignatius said, \"The more universal your work the more divine it become s.\" Usual training period for a Jesuit is 17 years. THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS- A Fraternal organization for Catholics modeled after Freemasonry. Also the reader shoul d be aware of the fol lowing church systems, because they play a role in the Illuminati's power structure."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"OLD CATHOLIC CHURCH- This branch is more occultic than the regular Catholic Church. One of its Rites is the Engl ish Rite. Became the Liberal Catholic Church. THE LIBERAL CATHOLIC CHURCH- Their Christ is Maitreya, and they follow the \"Great W hite Brotherhood.\" They ha ve a pagan trinity, and practice the occult. Started by a Freemason. Not directly under the Catholic system. SECURITY AROUND POPE JOHN XXIII The Pope dismissed the colorful ceremonial Swiss Guard from their duty of keeping a nightly vigil outside of his papal apartment. At the same time overa ll security around the Pope was beefed up tremendously. Some say these extraordinary measures were to protect the invest ment Secret Societies had in the Pope. Subchapter 6. Paul VI Under Paul VI the Cat holic church continued down the road toward the New World Order. Some of the noteworthy developments include * Liberation Theolo gy was embraced by the church * The Catholic Knights of Columbus and the Masons began working together. * The Catholic Church set up Maso nic Fronts * An outlawed Masonic lodge system devel oped called P2 LIBERATION THEOLOGY The Pope has never officially bl essed Liberation Theology and has at times not been publicly pleased with it. In a fashion reminiscent of Charles T. Russell, parts of the Catholic Church (Jesuits, Dominicans, Paulist Fathers, etc.) began to promote what is actually Judaism as a type of Christian theology called \"Liberation Theology.\" Liberation theolog y follows Jewish thought in se veral ways. It is revolutionary & socialist (which are definitely Jewish), it speaks only about Christ' s humanity, and it str ives for a socialist New Order. Yes, liberation theolo gians have actually called for a \"New Order\", which is also called the Kingdom of God, or the Millenium. Catholics are being promised a \"Golden Age of Christianity.\" (Whe re have we heard this before?) Quoting from a book on Liberation Theology by one of it's expousers entitled On Earth as it is in Heaven Jews, Christians, and Liberation Theology it says, \"Christian-Jewish dialogue has thus ceased to be the impossibility it once was....Combining theory with practice, this movement attempts to use the insights of Marxist social criticism to forge a new vision of the Christian message. Most importantly for Jewish-Christian encounter, liberation theologians have gone back to their Jewish roots in the Old"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Testament. Suddenly Jewish and Christian writers find themselves using the same vo cabulary and motifs...\" 79 \"The writings of thes e theologians [liberation theo.J express a common conviction that the rights of the poor must be upheld in a quest for the liberation of the oppressed. ... Thus the kingdom of God, contrary to what many Christians believe, does not signify something tha t is outside of this world. Each individual must make an effort to bring about a new order, a mission based on Jesus' actions and teachings as recorded in the gospels.\" 80 This Author's reaction to Liberation Theology is to be amazed at how sheeplike even Theologians are; the people of the New Order make it fashionable to believe in Liberation Theology (a Christianized Judaism) and all the sheep just follow along. Even the Catholics are forgetting tradit ion and going with the fads. Further, we read un der the chapter Common Ground and Shared Concerns, under the section A Marxist Perspective , we are told that Marxism allows the Jews and Christians to have common ground, \"This shared vision can serve as a bridge between the two traditions. Liberation theology's return to tr aditional Jewish ideals should make it possible for both faiths to work together for the first time in areas of social concern. . . .As we have seen in their analysis of society and in trying to understand conflict, liberation theologians fre quently utilize the ins ights of Marxism. For liberation theologian s Marxism is essentia lly an instrument of social analysis; . . . \" 81 So the dialectic synthesis of Judaism and Christianity is Marxism, (Oh?), does the reader s ee how they attempt to control both sides of an issue to control the synthesis? Back then, Australian Carmelite Patrick J. Gearon said, \"Efforts are being made today to replace the Ch urch of St. Au gustine, St. Thomas Aquinas...with a new Church, the Church of Humanism and Evolution...\" 82 Jesuit Priest Padre Lupe (short for Guadalupe) aka James Francis Carney writes, \"We Christian-Marxists wil l have to fight side-by- side in Central America with the Marxists who do not believe in God, in order to form a new socialist society...a pure Central American model....a Marxist is not dogmatic, but is dialectical. A Christian does not d ogmatically condemn a nyone, but respects the beliefs of others. A dogm atic anticommunist Chris tian is not a real Christian; and a dogmatic anti-Christi an Marxist is not a real Marxist....Neither co mmunist nor socialist...the universe of man is in dialectical evolution towards the Kingdom of God.\" 83 The Nicaraguan revolution was a carefully thought out orchestrated affair. 84 The Sandinistas would ha ve had little chance of installing a Marxist government in a country 91.6 % Catholic if the Catholic clergy h ad not supported revolu tion and preached to the people that the revolution wa s a religious matter sanctioned by the church. \"Heaven becam e the earthly paradis e of the workers from which captialism is abolished.\" 85 The National Council of Churches gave $305,000 in 1981 alone to the Jesuit staffed CEPAD in Nicaragua to help support the Revolution."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Not only have the Jesuits bec ome communist revolutionaries attempting to bring in a socialist state by violence, they have joined the Masonic Lodges in great numbers. \"There were, in addition, revelations th at certain circles of the international section of the Masonic Lodge in Europe and Latin America were actively organizing opp osition to the Ponti ff in Poland; that Vatican prelates- -some twenty in all--w ere formal members of the Italian Lodge. . . \" 86 The Jesuit influence has meant that the Roman Catholic population of India of 3 million has slipp ed back into what is Hinduism. To complete this picture, let us comment on how Vatican II has helped transform th e Catholic church into a Masonic-like religion. Three Cathlolic Priests in their co-authored book Finding Grace At The Center (bearing the official Imp rimatur approv al) advises, \"We should not hesitate to take the fruit of the age-old Wisdom of the East and \"capture\" it for Christ... Many Christians who take their prayer life seriously have been greatly helped by Yoga, Zen, TM, and similar practices. . . 87 The Mason Pope John Paul II has publicly endorsed such syncretism. 88 And much of the Catholic church is following suit. Zen Buddhism and Hinduism are being practiced now by many Catholics at church sponsored events. A local Christian (protestant) went to a retreat put on by Catholic monks. After coming home, he felt very good about his experience, until his brother who is a Zen Buddhist convinced him that what he had prac ticed doing on the re treat was Zen Buddhism. 89 Both of the two main schools (ty pes) of Zen Bud dhism teach that the goal of the Zen Buddhist is enlightment--which they call \"satori.\" The founder of Zen got his enlightm ent by staring at a blank wall for 9 years straight. The Christian concept of sin doesn't even enter the picture. For instance, listen to two Zen teachers describe satori. \"Satori is utterly impersonal...su fficient unto itself, its own authority...witho ut any sense of separ ateness there is no need of benevolence or love for one's fellow men.

THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS (A Semi-secret Catholi c Fraternity) and THE FREEMASONS WORK TOGETHER People from some areas can remember how th e Protestants in their area would join the M asonic Lodge, and the Ca tholics would join the Knights of Columbus, and that the two sides were separated by tensions, and animosities."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"On Washington's Birthday (how appropriate) in 1967 the two secret fraternal orders held a historical \"fraternal summit.\" The leaders of the Catholic Knights of Columbus and the leaders of the Northern Jurisdic tion of the Scottish Rite of Freemaso nry discussed the coordination and comb ination of the tw o fraternal orders. The Catholics were represented by Supreme Knight McDevitt, Deputy Supreme Kn ight Charles Ducey, a nd Supreme Ad vocate Harold Lamboley. The Scottish Rite was r epresented by George M. Newbury, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Northern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite, who was accompanied by the Grand Master of New York, Frank C. Staples, and some other ranking Freemasons. 92 This fraternal detente or pact of cooperation is a phenomena of the greater event, the capture of the Catholic Church by Freemasonry. AN EXAMPLE OF MAS ONIC CONTROL In Cincinnati, OH in recent years when the Catholic church wanted to see if their candidates w ere qualified to be priest they sent them to psychiatrist Joseph Wicker who is Masonic leader and a Rosicrucian. 92a MASONIC FRON TS SET UP In the light of all their suc esses, they were not content to allow the real Pope Paul VI to continue. He was too slow with change. In the 1970's, an imposter Pope, a look alike, replaced him. Voice analysis proves the two men were not the same. The nose and the ears were not the same. T he imposter was far sighted, the real Pope Paul VI was sh ort sighted. It is clai med that the real Pope Paul VI could speak English an d Latin. Others say he couldn't speak English. When t he imposter spoke on radi o, a voice could be heard coaching hi m from the backgro und. Still most people continued as they have always done, just accepti ng whatever th ey are told. If they are told that this is Pope Paul VI, then that is who he is, end of discussion. The look-alike imposter Pope reversed many of Pope Paul's stands. The real Pope had strongly against divorce. He had been against women at the altar, and co mmunion in the han d which the new Pope allowed. Communion in the hand was important for the Satanists, and their Black Mass becau se they liked to take the wafer back and use it in their Ho ly Communion (Holy or Unholy?). This Satanic ritual an d the ability to bring back and use \"Christ's body\" gives them a sense of power. The imp oster allowed all these things and also discontinued the Index of Forbidden Books. The imposter travelled, and went to the U.N. and met with the Chief of State of the Soviet Union Podgorny. Three men were instumental in carrying out the deception with this imposter Pope Paul VI. They were Cardinal Villot, Archbishop Casaroli, and Archbishop Benelli. All were Freemasons. Casaroli's membership has already been dis cussed. Cardinal Villot became a Freemason August 6, 1966. Benelli w as not only a Freem ason, but his mother (maiden name Wanda Katz) was Jewish. He himself was known to be a communist and described by some as \"self-serving.\" Villot was the Pope's Secretary of State, and his assistent was Benelli."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Villot was also head of the Sacred Congregation For The Clergy. This allowed him to administer the temporal belongings of the Vatican. Casaroli used other Catholic Masons as Papal envoys, and set up Masonic fronts in other countries. One Masonic front was the National Council of Catholic Bishops in the U.S. All this Masonic activity and infiltration did not go unnoticed. Cardinal Danielou of France announced that he had a list of the names of Masons who had risen to important positions in the Catholic Church. This 67 year old Cardinal was murdered four days after his announcement, (20 May 1974) and the body put in the apartment of a prostitute to discredit him. On 25 June the New York Times ran the story of his \"heart attack\" in the stripper's apartment with undertones of a scandal. As did the Sunday Times, 9 June. (For more on this type of thing see Chap. 3.7) Later in May 1976, another list of Ma sons holding positions in the Vatican even got circulated in the Vatican, 93 but due to the enormous power of the Masons nothing ever came of it. THE BIRTH & GROWTH OF P2 Under the administration of Mussolini, the activities of the Masons had been sharply curtailed. Yet Mussolini had met with and warmly received the Rosicrucians. 94 In other words, Mussolini was primarily concerned with maintaining power, the Masons were a secret power and therefore a thre at, while the Rosicrucians seemed to simply be an occul tic religious gro up. One law fr om Mussolini's rule managed to remain on the books in Italy that cramped the style of the Masonic Lodges. That rule was that they had to report their memberships. It's harder to secretly rule, if the public knows who is a Mason and who isn't. The history of how the Masons got around that law to report their lodge membership li sts is the history of P2. Licio Gelli was raised in a regular Masonic lodge in Nov., 1963. He went on to become a 3° Mason and the Master of a lodge. The Italian Grand Master approached him with the idea of forming a secret Lodge system. With the blessings and help of the Grand Master, Gelli began forming a secret (therefore in Italy illegal) Masonic Lodge system called P2 for short- \"Raggruppamento Gelli-Propoganda 2\" was the full name. 95 The original Propoganda Lodge was a historic italian lodge in the 19th century. This group has their own ritual, which include dressing up in black robes and black hoods, like friars. They pledge total loyalty to the Lodge, and called themselves \"fratelli\", 96 In Italian the word for Mason, \"Masso\" comes from the word for brick. Consequently, the \"suicide\" of Roberto Calvi done by his P2 fratelli can be understood. Roberto Calvi, an Italian Banker of importance was a P2 member and P2's paymaster, and was found hanging under the Blackfriars Bridge in Lo ndon in 1982 with bricks in his pockets. Can the symbolism go unnoticed? The warning must have been clear to the other fratelli. Calvi had eight bodyguards, armor-plated Alfa Romeos with bullet-proof tires, etc., one of the best security systems in Italy. And none of it saved him."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"BUT WHO WOULD JOIN SUCH A FRATERNITY? When one examines how the P2 Masonic Lodges operate, the question becomes not \"who would joi n?\" but \"who wouldn't join?\" If you have managed to get into a position of power without selling yourself out to the system, then the P2 Masonic system has their ways to recruit you that se em to come straight out of the book The Godfathers. Personal contact by existing members is a nice way to recruit. Potential recruits are especial ly impressed when they receive a phone call telling them that P2 will fix a certain upcoming job position for them, and then they see P2 has the power to fulfill. If that doesn't make them want to join, then there is always blackmail and threats. The re are other more permanent solutions for people who are totally unwilli ng to bow to terror. When joining the ca ndidate is required to spil l his guts and expose all the dirt he knows, which gives the Lodge further material to blackmail not only himself but many other people. An example of the talent that P2 has, is P2 Mason Jose' Lopez Rega, who created the imfamous Triple-A death squads and a cocaine smuggling opperation between Argentina and the U.S. Cardinal Giacomo Lercaro, an in fluential liberal who helped insure that Vatican II was ad opted as policy for the Catholic Church was close friends with P2 M ason Ortolani. Ortolani in turn was a businessman, lawyer, ex-head of the Italian SISMI Military Intelligence during W.W.I I. Nor was Lercaro th e only highly placed Vatican friend of P2 Mason Ortolani. Due to a few incorruptable brave Italian law enforcement officers, secret P2 mem bership lists were s eized in Tuscany in 1981. These revealed about 1,000 na mes. The lists revealed that most of the power in Italy (not to ment ion Latin America ) had been brought under the Lodge's control. In the decade prior to this, various individuals had also been leaking memb ership lists of high ranking Vatican officials that were Masons. For instance, L'Osservatore Politico (OP) published a list in Sept. 1978 of 121 people in the Vatican--what OP called \"The Great Vatican Lodge\" who were Freemasons of some sort, more were members of the regular lodges than of P2. Is it possible that P2 is a runawa y lodge system, a power unto themselves? Even if that is so, (and only a few men would know for sure the exact ties P2 h as to regular Freemasonry--this Author doesn't know), it certainly has b een working closely with regular Freemasonry and many of the other groups that Freemasonry associates with. The P2 lodges hav e connections with the English Grand Lodge, the Tril ateral Commission in th e U.S., the Bohemian Grove, and the Club of Rome, not to mention the Mafia and Intelligence Services (MI6/CIA/etc.) One of George Bush's appointees was P2 Mason Philip Guarino, the Vice-chairman of his Ethnic Outreach Com mittee. When his member ship became public he was dropped.

Subchapter 7 JOHN PAUL I In a home partly conv erted from a barn at Canale d'Agordo north of Venice, Albino Luciani came into the world on Oct. 17, 1912. The young man grew up in poverty. The book The Five Wounds of the Church by Antonio Rosmini deeply influenced Albino Luciano. These two items, his compassion for the poor (due to his roots) and his desire to return the Catholic Church to its Christian roots (brought on by men like Rosmini) go a long way in explaining how he acted when he was elected Pope. As pro-vicar-general of Belluno, he enjoyed reading, cycling, and climbing mountains. He was a man of real character. When saw corruption he in the church he brought it to P ope Paul VI' s attent ion. When the Pope did nothing about his complaint, Luciani accepted this out of a deep sense of obedience. Pope Paul VI misinterpreted Luciani's acceptance of his decision as perhaps suggestive of Luciani's acceptance of the corruption. Luciani's father had been an outspoken Socialist and Albino Lu ciani had maintained good working relations with the communists. 97 This explains in part how Luciani, a man of genuine sinc ere character ended up Pope. In 1958, he was made a Bishop by Pope John XXIII. He was made Patriarch of Venice on Dec. 15, 1969. It was while he was patriarch in 1972 that he learned from Giovanni Benelli (second in command under the Vatican's Secretary of State about the Masonic Financial intrigues with the Vatican Bank. Albino Luciani with others we re disgusted with the shameful money-making schemes of the P2 Masons Calvi and Bishop Marcinkus. (Luciani at this point didn't know they were Masons.) Luciani and others in his diocese that were disgusted moved their accounts from Banco Cattolica to the small Banco San Marco. The book In God's Name is a masterpiece of research into what happened to Luciani after he became Pope John Paul I. This book is highly recommended. This subchapter is drawn to a large extent from the book. Pope John Paul I set out to reform the Catholic church. He refused to be coronated. He set out to remove the trappings of royalty that surround the pope. He tried to replace those men"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"around him who were Freemasons with honest men. He started to divest the church of its wealth, and to open an investigation in the Church's scandalo us financial deal ings carried out by P2. The men in the Vatican ce nsored his statements, is sued false statements in his name, limited his phone calls, failed to send his letters, and censored his remarks in his speeches out of the official records of his speeches. Finally, he was murdered on only the 33rd day (a number ripe with M asonic symbology) that he had been Pope. In good Mafia style, the morticians were called to embalm him, before the body had been discovered by Father McGee.(p. 254) His will disappeared. The world was fed lies, and in general the world swallowed the lies. But there we re many people in the Vatican who loved the Pope and wh o knew the Vatican was lying profusely about his death. Pope John Paul I told a friend in northern Italy his observation, \"I have noticed two th ings that appear to be in very short supply in the Vatican. Honesty and a good cup of coffee.\" On the 33rd day of his papacy, Pope John Paul I was apparently poisoned. And just knowing some of the di shonest people Pope John Paul I had to deal with wh en he came to the Vatican explains a lot. Let's introduce some of the chara cters that John Paul I dealt with: Licio Gelli- the Grand Master of P2, nicknamed Il Burattinaio (the Puppetmaster) because so many people were his puppets. He had been part of Mussolini's feared Black Sh irts, an SS officer during W.W. II, then a communist spy, besides serving the CIA and and the Italian SID. Bishop Paul Marcinkus- a P2 Freemason and President of the Vatican Bank, nicknamed the Gorilla, he had grown up in Al Capone's Cicero,Il. around the Mafia and was street smart. He was 6'3\" and 224 lbs. His nickname \"Gorilla\" was appropria te in several ways. Michele Sidona- a P2 Freemason, worked for the CIA, the Mafia, and Interpol. He was the Vatican's fin ancial advisor. He was also a Sicilian banker. He was adept at stealing othe r people's money, and had the appropriate nickname \"the Shark.\" Cardinal Jean Villot- a P2 Freemason and raised in a regular Lodge both, the Vatican's Secre tary of State. Yallup considers Villot one of if not the prime suspects of the murder of the Pope. Yallup describes Villot's destruction of evidence, coverup and lies concerning the Pope's murder, \"If Luciani died naturally, Villot's actions and instructions are completely inexplicable. His behavior becomes understandable only when related to one specific conclusion: Either Cardin al Jean Villot was pa rt of a conspiracy to murder the pope, or he saw clear evidence in the papal bedroom indicating the pope had been murde red, and he prompt ly determined that to protect the Church that evidence must be destroyed.\"(p. 220) Cardinal John Cody- in c harge of Chicago's arch diocese, the man was considered by many to be the worst character possible in about"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"every way. Some have called him Captain Queeg of The Caine Mutiny, with apologees to Captain Queeg. He claimed to have work ed for the FBI and CIA. While in charge of Chicago he closed Catholic schools down without consulting anyone.(p.189) He had total control of several large paris hes during his lifetime . No one knows how many millions or billions of church dollars he siphoned off for himself. John Paul I tried to remove him one week before John Paul's murder. Cody worked with members of P2. Branches of P2 Masonry are in Argentina, Venez uela, Paraguay, Bolivia, France, Portugal, and Ni caragua. Members are also active in the United States, the U.K., and Switzerland. Peter Thompkins has been a researcher into P2. P2 Masonry interlocks with the CIA, the Mafia, and the Vatican. It also has close ties with the Neo- Nazis and members of the Fourth Reich in S outh America. It likes to recruit priests, bishops and cardinals. Lesson from Jo hn Paul I. Even though John Paul had made stat ements in favor of Vatican II and a stronger 1-worl d-government, it is clear he had only bought into their progra m for his own reasons an d without subscribing to its end result. His e lection shows tha t men of good character can even slip through the cracks in the One-World-Order's screening process and wind up as part of that Power's rulership. Many people, who didn't pay attention to the P2 Banking scandals that destroyed an Italian govern ment and shook America's FDIC, did pay attention when a Pope in excellent health mys teriously died after 33 days in office. It may be too late for w hoever killed the Pope to repent. Villot died shortly after the Pope died, as did a number of other important people. P2 Mason Sindona, and drug deale r, involved in the collapse of the Franklin National Bank in New York went to prison. Before dying in an American prison he told an interviewer how America's leaders were giving America to the Russians. When the USSR supposedly bought wheat from the U.S. \"The Sov iet Union was allowed to pay for its purchases in the fol lowing manner: the cent ral bank of Hungary, acting for the Soviet Union, placed an order to sell the dollar short for $20 billion; Secretary of the Tr easury John Connally then devalued the dollar by 10% ; the Soviet Union ma de $4 billion on its short selling operation, and paid for the grain; they had $2 billion profit fro m the short se lling operation a nd $2 billion from the 10% devaluation of the dollar.\" Sindona said, \"In its fathomless naivete, the U nited States has prov ided the Soviets with $4 billion, money that has since doubtless been invested in the destruction of its benefactors; I b egan to see that America was the consort of her own ruin.\" (The Curse of Canaan, p.62) Subchapter 8 John Paul II The Catholic Pope today is John Paul II, a Polish Jew and a Freemason. Under his papacy all the corruption of the P2 lodges within the Vatican fi nances and the infilt ration of the Masons in all positions of the Catholic hier archy continues."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"As a result of this, we now find the Rocke fellers spending vast sums of money on various Catholic schools and projects. Laurence Rockefeller, multimillionaire gave the New Age Catholic Priest Matthew Fox a grant so that he could write the Satanic book The Coming of the Cosmic Christ. 98 Mathew Fox is a Dominican Priest who believes in such things as phallic worship, reverence for \"Mother Earth\", and Jungian psychodynamics.\" Fox's monism teachings are 3,000 year old Hindu teachings. Other new age Catholics like Kennith Wapnick are now spreading the good news of the New Age. The Vatican under John Paul II undertook one of the largest projects in recent history. The Catholic Church with the blessings of the New-World-Order created the Solidarity movement in Poland and by 1986 it was estimated that t he Catholic Church had sent over $100,000,000 to Solidarity. 100 The purpose of this was all revealed before it happened by a defector from Russia who described in detail how communism had planned to allow Eastern Europe to open up. And how this was all part of a plan for the eventual unification of all Europe and Russia. JOHN PAUL II It is not surprising knowing that John Paul II is a Freemason that he has been placing many Masons into key positions. All the barriers have come down to Catholics joining the Masons. The barriers have slowly come down. John XXIII officially allowed tolerance of Masons, alth ough the books still fo rbid Catholics from joining. The Masons had continually joined in increasing numbers from after W.W. I onward. 101 In 1974, Pope Paul VI gave permission \"in particular cases\", which conveniently allowed many American Catholics to join the Masonic lodge. 102 Pope John Paul II placed into canon law a rule that took effect Nov. 27, 1983 that eliminates the ban on Ca tholics bei ng Freemasons. 103 Now Catholics are subjected to Masonic propaganda from their own official magazines. The U.S. Catholic Magazine of Mar. 91 56:22-33 is almost a recruiting article for the Masons. The article shows pictures of bricks, plumbline, and trowells to portray the false image that the Masons simply are an extension of the construction workers. To explain what the Masons are all about they interview various Masons and their answers are duly recorded: \"They meet monthly to conduct their ancient ritual..and simply to socialize...This last item is really what the Masons are all about.\" (p.31) \"I n many ways they rese mble the Knights of Columbus, who can be thought of as Catholi c Masons;...\"(p.32) \"The Freemasons are Boy Scouts for adults....Today the Masons are essentially a genial service organization...\"(p.33) The article quotes Masonic historia n Williamson who guesses that there are hundreds of thousands of Catholic Masons today.

WHAT IS YALE'S POWER? Harvard was started as a colle ge in 1636, and Yale in 1701. A Harvard alumnus who planned to send his son to Yale sa id \"all the Harvard men ar e working for Yale men.\" 1 Why is it that Yale men have so much success over Harv ard men? Why? What is Yale's power? WHAT IS THE UNITARIAN CHURCH'S POWER? There were Lutherans, Catholics, long before there were any Unita rians in this land. Lutherans outnumbered the Unitarian-Universalist church by over 60 times the membership, and the Catholic church is over 300 time s the size of the Unitarian Chur ch. But the political power of the Unitarian Church has been enormous compar ed to these other groups. For example, there have been at least 4 Unitarians elected U.S. President. There has never been a Lutheran, a Pentecostal, nor a Mennonite president. There has on ly been one Catholic president. Why? What is the Unitarian Church's power? THE POWER The Power of the New World Order is the power of the Unitarian-Universalist church and Yale College (now University) which was associated with the Unitarians. The Universalist and Unitarian churches have been essentially Masoni c denominations. It was appropriate that when the Illuminati and Illuminated Masonry branched out to the United States, that they chose the Unitarian church as an important center of th eir activities. They followed their pattern of founding Illuminati cells in Univer sities, such as they had done at the Univ. of Ingolstadt, and \"the Group\" at All Souls College, Oxford Un iv. Yale was a natura l \"shoe-in\" for them. And it was from Yale University, a center for the Illuminati, that 3 Yale men in the 1850s went over to the Univ. of Berlin to learn Hegeli an philosophy which they imported back to the U.S. and totally revised American Education. Th eir Revolution in how we teach our children to read is why phonetics are not taught, and the Look-Say method even though students learning phoneticly are reading better a nd national reading scores are going down with Look-Say. 2 They obviously have other e ducational priorities."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"WHO ARE THE UNITARIAN-UNIVERSALISTS? The Unitarians and Universalists ha ve merged their denominations. A brief overview of the Unitarian-Universalist C hurch will show how the church fits in the New Order. Today, they openly promote the Ne w Age Movement and a Universal church. It resembles Reformed Judaism so cl osely that Rabbi Kahane said Unitarianism is indistinquishable from Reformed Judaism. The Rabbi said, \"The Amer ican Jewish religious theories that came into being included the Reform brand, whose distin quishability from Christian Unitarianism was evident only to the keenest of scholastics or philogists;...\" 3 The Unitarian Church has its share of Jewish members, and the original founders often have links to important blood lines. IF THIS CHURCH IS SO POWERFUL, WHY HAVEN'T PEOPLE HEARD OF IT? Good question. In 1852, the Unitarian Reverend Theodore Pa rker praised the high ranking Mason Hosea Ballou (1771-1852) for having crea ted \"a revolution in the t houghts and minds of men more mighty than any which has been accomplished du ring the same period by all the politicians of the nation.\" 4 If the Mason and Universalist Hosea Ballou wr ought such a powerful revolution in men's minds why doesn't history record his achievement with fanfare? Perhaps, the same reason they haven't advertised how the Orde r wrought such a Revolution in Am erica's education system. The control and direction they have given our lives is far more pervasive than most Americans have any clue about, and they most likel y prefer it to remain that way. THE UNITARIANS & UNIVERSALIST CHU RCHES WERE ORIGINALLY SEPERATE Outside of the Masonic Lodge, or away fro m Masonic gatherings, the Universalists and Unitarians, during Hosea Ballou's day went sepera te ways. The Unitarians were Universalists (belief wise) in disguise , and later the groups woul d merge. However, at the time of Ballou the Unitarians were still Congregational in name, and up until the early 1820s still received state money collected from the universal religious tax levied upon the entire population for the support of the established Congregational church. Althoug h the Unitarians did not believe in the concept of sin, the Atonement of Christ, the Deity of Ch rist, the Judgement of Ch rist as the Almighty, the miraculous conception of Christ, and many othe r fundamental Christian doctrines they carried the label Christian, and in th e U.S., a nominally Christian na tion, were state supported until 1820. In contrast, to the wealthy a nd influential members who made up the Unitarian churches and received state support, the Universalist ch urches were made up of common people. HOSEA BALLOU MISREPRESENTED & IGNORED BY HISTORIANS To dispel some of the misrepresentations a bout Ballou, the Universa list Historical Society published a book. One myth that they did away wi th is that Hosea Ballou was the originator of his own religious beliefs. The book's author, Ernest Cassara, criticizes past writers on Ballou, \"Most serious of all, their work nourished the myth that Ba llou was purely an original thinke r. They believed that he had arrived at his theory of atonement, his unitari an conception of God, his Arian conception of Christ and many aspects of his thought simply through an independent study of the Bible.\" 5 Hosea Ballou (1771-1852) was mo re influential in his time than the New Thought Unitarian Masons such as William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson, 6 who both have been given"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"more attention by historians than Ballou. By the way, William Ellery Channing had a Jewish heritage. Ralph Waldo Emerson was raised by hi s Mason stepfather Ezra Ripley. Emerson praised his stepfather's religious views. 7 POWER OF THE WRITTEN & SPOKEN WORD The story of Hosea Ballou shows the power of the written and spoken word. How much support during his lifetime did the Masons give Ballou? That would be an extensive study. However, it is easier to pinpoint the three bigge st influences upon his life (fatherly influences aside). Ballou was greatly influenced by a mys tic named Caleb Rich. The second big influence was the Masonic author Et han Allen. And the fina l big influence particularly upon his Theology, was the books by the Masonic deists of that age. BALLOU'S LIFE PARALLELS JOS. SMIT H'S & C.T. RUSSELL'S IN SOME WAYS Hosea Ballou's early life has affinities to both C.T. Russell's and Joseph Smith, Jr. All three came from families that appear to have had grea t expectations religiously for these men. Like C.T. Russell's mother, Hosea's died when he was young. He wa s only 20 months old. 8 And like Russell he was very close to his father. 9 However, unlike Russell's fa ther, Ballou's father was opposed to his Universalist ideas. In spite of hi s opposition his father did accept his son, and there weren't any hard feelings between father and son in spite of Hosea's changes. The mystic Caleb Rich converted Hosea and mo st of Hosea's siblings to Univ ersalism. In turn Hosea later converted his oldest brother. 10 In the genesis of his beliefs, Ballou, like Russe ll, challenged a local au thority to answer his questions. Elder Brown of Westfiel d failed to answer his questions. 11 Ballou in his late teens, increasingly hardened in his Universalist beliefs. While a youth, Ballou had been interested in the lodge, and as a young man he joined. 12 More about his Masonic career later. In 1789, Hosea and most of his siblings, brot hers and sisters, joined the Universalist movement. His brother was a type of homespun philosopher. 13 Hosea himself had very little formal education. \"Though rich in native intelligen ce, he was always to suffer from the lack of a good thorough educational backgroun d. His accomplishments were to be made in spite of this deficiency.\" 14 Later, Hosea converted his el dest brother to Universalism. 15 In terms of family support and education the three Masons Russell, Smith, and Ballou also had affinities to each other. BALLOU'S FIRST INFLUENCE Caleb Rich, the mystic universalist (with possibly a Jewish heritage), who would influence the Ballou family so much, moved into a nearby town the year Hosea was born. 16 This mystic received his theology from a se ries of dreams and visions. 17 Caleb Rich on the basis of his visions started a church na med \"the General Society.\" 18 The General Society had members from the nearby towns of Warwick, Richmond and Jaffrey. 19 It is considered likely that Hosea as a boy partic ipated at some of the General Society's events. Some of Hosea's relatives joined this General Society. 20 BALLOU'S SECOND INFLUENCE The next influence on his life was the Mason (a gain with a possible Jewish heritage) Ethan Allen. Ethan Allen's book Reason the Only Oracle of Man changed Ballou's thinking. Allen's"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Masonic membership has been debated back and forth, the author tends to side toward the evidence that he was a Mason. Reco rds from lodges back then are often nonexistent, a nd it is not that perilous to believe statemen ts of people that he was a Mas on. Masonry was very strong in that area and not only influenced Ethan Allen, but also the family of Joseph Smith. (The connections between the Universalist Church and the origins of Mormonism will be discussed elsewhere, as well as the Masonic tie ins.) Ballou himself cites Masonic deist writers as th e source of his views. \"It may be proper for me here to state on e circumstance, which, no doubt, had no small tendency to bring me on to the ground where I have, for many years, felt established. It was my reading some deistical writings. By this means I was led to see that it was utte rly impossible to maintain Christianity as it has been generally believed in the church.\" 21 Ethan Allen's book was rather ra re, because after lightening st ruck the print shop and burned up most of the newly printed books, the printer destroyed most of the rest because of the book's atheistic views. At least one copy circulated among the Universalists (from hand-to-hand most likely), and Ballou read such a copy. 22 From Allen, Ballou learned to examine everythi ng escpecially scripture from the light of reason. The doctrine of the Trinity seemed contra ry to reason to Allen, so Ballou following his cue also rejected the Trinity. 23 Allen was forced, because of hi s rejection of the Trinity, to change his view of the Atoneme nt of Christ. So he dismisse d it altogether. Discarding the Atonement of Christ, meant discarding the concept of sin. 24 Allen's book which he called \"Oracles of Reason\", and others called \"Ethan Allen's Bible\" had a pr ofound effect upon Ballou as is evidenced by Ballou's 1805 A Treatise on Atonement. BALLOU'S THIRD INFLUENCE Ballou was also familiar with another Mason deist Thomas Pa ine. Although he didn't share Paine's views, he felt they were healthy for true Christianity. Ballou wrote that he felt rigid Christians \"have done more harm to the religion of Jesus than his open enemies from Celsus down to T. Paine.\" 25 His close friend Caleb Rich got him together w ith his wife-to-be, the daughter of one of the few universalist families in the area. 26 Although the Masonic referenc e book 10,000 Famous Freemasons is generally very accurate, it does make a mistake about Ball ou. Contrary to their statemen t, Ballou was not ordained a Baptist minister. Rather, in the fall of 1789, the Baptist church excommunicated him. 27 However, the Universalist Church did ordain him in Sept. 1794 at their Oxford general convention. 28 Hosea Ballou then went on a non-stop pr eaching travelling sche dule similar to the three Masons C.T. Russell, Lorenzo Dow, and William Miller. He prea ched nearly every 29 evening. In May, 1802 four Univer salist groups formed \"Sister Societ ies\" in the Woods tock Area. They named their societies the Libera l Catholic Society of Woodstock, the Independent Catholic Society of Woodstock, Th e Catholic Benevolent Society in Ha rtland, and the Un iversalist Society of Bethel. 30 Leading citizens of the area joined the Universalist Societies 31 , so it is possible that other Masons in the local beca me involved with the Societies. BALLOU'S MASONIC CAREER After being \"raised\" in one of the lodges of one of the towns th at he lived in during his early years, he moved to Dana, Mass. in 1794, and then to Barnard, VT in 1803. Ballou became active"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"in the Masonic Lodge. He is know n to have preached at a Masonic Festival in June 1806 at Chester, VT. 32 In 1807, he was made the ma ster in Woodstock, VT lodge. 33 In 1809, he moved to Portsmouth, N.H. and soon afte rwards was made the Junior Gr and Warden of the Grand Lodge of N.H. which he served at from 1811 to 1815. 34 In 1817, he moved to Boston and became the minister of the second Universalist Society 35 and joined the Mt. Lebanon Masonic Lodge in Boston. 36 Ballou was a member of that lodge until his death in 1852. One of Hosea Ballou's close friends was Sylvanus Cobb, Sr., who was a pallbearer at his funera l. Sylvanus Cobb, Jr. wrote the book The King's Talisman and was the high priest of the Norfolk Chapter of the Royal Arch Masons. Sylvanus Cobb, Jr. also became a Knights Templar and a Scottish Rite member. 37 Another friend of Hosea's, fellow Bostonian William Ellery Channi ng (grandfather? or granduncle? of the Christian Scientist and Mason George Channing) was a Unitarian. Many theological students came to Ball ou, including many clergymen from other denominations. 38 The future Mason Thomas Starr King, who became a famous Unitarian minister and the Grand Orator of the Calif. Grand L odge, studied for the ministry under Hosea Ballou. 39 While Ballou lived in Boston, Mass. the future fa mous Universalist Albert J. Holden was born in 1841. Albert J. Holden would join the Masons and be the organist for the Universalist church in N.Y. named the Church of the Divine Patern ity. He also played fo r the Church of the Puritans. 40 IS THERE SOME CONNECTION BETWEE N THE PURITANS & ALL THIS? The story behind Hosea Ballou goes way back. Perhaps a good place to start is with the passing of the English crown from the Tudors to the Stuarts. Th e rule of the Stuarts was a significant influence in the deve lopment of Protestant thought. 41 One example of the change the Stuarts brought is seen in the marriage of Elizabeth Stuart to Frederick of the Palatinate. These two \"to realize the ideal of Hermetic re form centered on a real prince...created a culture, a 'Rosicrucian' state with its court centered on Heidelberg. 42 The Stuarts were intimately involved with the sp read of Freemasonry, and are regarded as the source of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. 43 Although certainly the groundwork had been laid by that secret Tudor prince Sir Francis Bacon.(See chap. 1.2) During the Stuarts reign, advocates of all kinds of extreme millenial views appeared in the Anglican church and the Puritan movement. 44 An Edinburgh translation of a German work Dorn ier, On the Person of Christ had an appendix by Dr. Fairbaim which introduced Socinianism to its British readers in the 17th century. In the year 1691, this appendice's thought appeared in Dr. Bury's Naked Gospel. The Naked Gospel, which was too much for Orthodox thinkers, wa s publicly burned. Whiston in 1708 kept the stream of thought flowing, as di d others until in 1782, with Pries tley and Belsham as leaders, the Unitarians met in London for the first time as a church body. Priestley, himself became in succession an Arian, a Socini an, and lastly a Unitarian. 45 The relationship between severa l types of thinking can be summed up by quoting from an article \"Unitarians\" in the Dic tionary of Sects, Heresies, Eccl esiastical Parties, & Schools of Religious Thought. \"Modern Unitarians, the school of Priestley, who are principally of England and America, are the successors rather than the lin eal descendants of the So cinians....the Unitarian sect was formed out of the Arianism floating in th e Church and in dissent. This Arianism sprung from the Dutch Remonstrant theology, which was largely studied in England. (Arminianism.) Historically, Arminianism has led to Arianism , and thence to Socinian ism and Unitarianism.\" 46 "},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Socinianism had strong German and Polish Jewish ties and origins. In other words, although some of these \"isms\" are thought of as Christian heresy, if a pers on examines back to their roots, one discovers their roots in the past were not Christian. Initially, the Unitarians used Presbyterian chapel s for worship, but late r shifted to Puritan churches. 47 Prof. F.A. Christie has done a scholarly work entitled \"The begi nnings of Arminianism in New England\" which details how the early Purita n church in New England had advocates for Arminianism within it. The beginnings of the Unitarian movement in the U.S. go back to the first Puritan settlers, some of which were Unita rians, but nominally called Puritans. The Puritan churches are now called Congrega tional Churches. The Congregationalist, Rev. Experience Mayhew, gave a message in 1744 in fa vor of Arminianism. An other minister, William Pynchon, in 1650, wrote out in fa vor of liberalism in his Merito rious Price of our Redemption. The beginnings of the Unitarian movement go back to the firs t Puritans, and some of these families involved links to Jewish blood lines. The Universalist movement also can be studied in the lives and writings of such Puritan pioneers as Rev. John Murray (18 16) and Rev. Elhanan Winchest er (1836), Jonathon Mayhew (1763-64) and Charles Chauncey. Chauncey's Universalist views ca n be seen in such works as \"The Mystery hid from Ages and Generations...\"(1784)46 The historian will also note that these liberals were in correspondence with British Unitarians. Thomas Belsham's \"Memoirs of the Late Revere nd Theophilus Lindsey M.A. ...\" (1812) provides a look at the communication kept up between the Britis h and American liberal Congregationalists. (They weren't yet known as Unitarians.) There were also ties to Jews. For instance, one prominant ear ly Unitarian minister, Rev. Samuel J. May, records how clos e his family was to the Jewish family of M.M. Hayes. M.M. Hayes was also an active Freemason, and Samuel called him \"uncle.\" Perhaps to date, the best historical look at th e movement is Richard E ddy's \"Universalism in America, Vol. I 1636-1800. HARVARD COLLEGE (now university) Harvard was started by the church and became a hotbed for liberals such as Henry Dunster and Charles Chauncey. For instance, Rev. Joseph Avery (1751-1824) graduated from Harvard with honors in 1771 and went forth as a prominent Congregational minister practicing magic. (The Salem Witch Trials were but a small distortion of the symptom of an occult problem under the Puritans. Some hold that the witc hes were the ones who were invo lved in condem ing the women. If so, that would tie in with othe r information, that indicates one of Joseph Smith's ancestors was involved in cond eming the women to be burned.) EARLY LINKS BETWEEN UNITAR IANS & MASONIC REVOLUTION Harvard, a church school, brought in professors like Karl Follen of Giessen, Germany. Karl Follen helped create the Bund der Jungend (L eague of Youth) in Europe which was a revolutionary movement with links to the Carb onari and the Masons. These movements at times moved under the guise of the Swi ss Bible Society. In August 18 19, ministers met at Carlsbad, Germany and denounced the moveme nt, which then was broken up by the arrests of its members. In late 1824, Follen left Switzerland to be a Unitarian minister at Harvard. 48 LATER LINKS BETWEEN UNITAR IANS & MASONIC REVOLUTION"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Our next topic is a group of Unitarian c onspirators, who are re latively well-known in American history as ministers and for things other than revolution.

But J ohn Brown did not do this on his own. What men supported John Brown, supplied hi m with his money and arms? And who was the real John Brown?

Bear in mind, that contrary to popular mythology, Br own knew little about the Bible. He knew of one verse \"the wages of sin is death\" and he literally beli eved that it meant if someone sinned against you, you could blow him away. It is reported he picked up this revolting idea from hearing a Mormon sermon. The Rosicrucian leader George Lippard, member of the Brethren of Light, who was seeking to create a Brotherhood which wa s to be \"a poor Man's Masonr y\", personally influenced John Brown to become rabidly anti-slavery. 50a John Brown's eldest son John Brown, Jr., who al so murdered and stole along side his father, was a faithful Mason. 51 John Brown, Jr. was also a lecturer on phrenology. 52 Phrenology was \"immensely p opular among those turning aw ay from formal religion.\" 53 Three avid students of phrenology who also supported John Brown and his sons,(besides the actual secret six) were Dr. Samuel Howe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Sen. Charles Sumner. Masonic historians have tried to characterize John Brown as anti-Masoni c, but this Author finds nothing to substantiate that claim. They make a big deal that supposedly John Brown said the rituals were \"silly\". Whether he did or not, simply calling the rituals \"silly\", is no indication he was anti-masonic. Indeed, hi s uncle was the master of th e Hudson Lodge No. 68 where he was \"raised\" as a Mason. 54 John Brown worked with him and other Masons during his lifetime without any problems. For instance, August (Anschel) Bondi was a Je wish Freemason who fought with John Brown in the Kansas \"battles\" of Blackjack and Osawatomie. 55 One might better describe these battles as butcheries. Anyway, this Jewish Freemason Ansc hel Bondi, before he jo ined with Brown, was a long time revolutionist having fought in the Ma sonic created Metternich revolution, and against Spain in the Masonic crea ted revolution in Cuba. 56 (The Scottish Rite's New Age Magazine has an article about how the Masons st arted and led the Cuba revolution.) 57 Another tie in that John Brown had with the occult was his membership in the Rosicrucian Fraternity. He was on their Worl d Council and Council of Three. 57a One of his Rosicrucian Fraternity brothers, William Lloyd Ga rrison, would help him in st arting armed revolution to free the slaves. Garrison had joined the american Rosi crucians first, establis hed the American Anti- Slavery Society in 1832, and become a member of the Order of the Rose in England in 1834. 57b THE INNER GROUP OF THE CON SPIRACY FOR BROWN'S REVOLUTION The secret six which was the inner core of the conspiracy for armed revolution were, Rev. Thomas Wentworth Higginson Rev. Theodore Parker George Stearns Gerrit Smith"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Franklin Benjamin Sanborn Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe. The inner group might better be described as Unitarian than Ma sonic, because although some were Masons, it is known the group itself consisted of Unitarians. This core group consisted of six men, who in turn can be traced back to th e Bird Club. Before giving the history of their plotting, and mentioning the contributions of others, let us examine these six men. Unitarian Rev. Theodore Parker, was a big reader. His pers onal library was 12,000 volumes. He associated with the social experiment at Brooks Farm, 58 and believed in evolution before Darwin. Read his book A Discourse on Religion for that one. He was privately educated but passed Harvard's exams in 1830-31. 59 Parker wrote in The Dial in 1840, \"God will create a soul yet larger and nobler than Jesus,\" \"...to l ead the way to a more perfect religion...\" George Stems, a Unitarian born in Mass., 60 was a friend of Emersons . He was an upper class Bostonian lead pipe manufacturer. 61 That was before lead was known to be poisonous. Rev. Thomas Wentworth (1823-1911 ) was a Unitarian Pastor of the 1st Religious Society of Newburyport, Mass. and married Mary Channing. 62 Gerrit Smith was a multi-millionair e. He had more land in New York State than any other individual. His father was a pardner with the Je wish Mason John Jacob Astor (the Astor family has ties to the Illuminati group in England). 63 Garrit Smith generously gave 140,000 acres of land to destitute free blacks. 64 Unfortunately, most of the land was lost by the blacks when they were unable to pay their land taxes. 65 Although nominally a Presbyter ian, he is on public record as saying that Satan is the author of Christianity. 66 Franklin Benjamin Sanborn (1831-1917) was named after the famous Mason Benjamin Franklin. (Yes, they named him after him backwards.) He was a pro-transcendentalist and a Unitarian. 67 A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CO NSPIRACY BEHIND JOHN BROWN Charles Sumner had been interested in Masonr y and revolution for a l ong time. He had made personal visits to occultic revolutionists in Europe, including Mazzini. He excited his fellow Bird Club members with his revolutionary talk. 68 Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, G.L. Stearns, F.B. Sanborn, Charles Sumner, and Rev. Higginson were members of the Bird Club. 69 They met in Young's Hotel in Boston, 70 and from this group came much of the core of the cons piracy to create an armed revolution. These men were not alone in supporting an insurre ction. The origins go back to such famous men as Ralph Waldo Emerson. Ralph Waldo Emerson learned Swedenborgian from his friend Wordworth who was one. 71 Emerson was a Unitarian Reverend of Boston's Second Church, and was found after 1829 to be diligently studying such Masonic writers as Rousseau, Goethe, Sw ift, and pagan works such as Aristotle and Plutarch. 72 His sermons were spiced with refe rences from Socrates and Confucius. 73 He wrote a book on the Mason Swedenborg's religi ous thinking entitled Observations on the Growth of the Mind."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Another early abolitionist wa s William Ellery Channing, bo th a Freemason and a Unitarian minister. Channing also studied and was influe nced by Rousseau, Voltaire and other masonic authors. Channing believed the Bible was a story-book, not a trust worthy authority. 74 He felt the Trinity belief was idolatry and polyt heism. He felt Calvinism was immoral. 75 John Brown had very little religious scr uples nor very little defined theology. 76 He did have a hate for slavery, which was spar ked by reading abolitionist material. Finally, history finds all the pl otting, and planning, the shippi ng of guns and ammunition, etc. culminating in the raid on Harper's Ferry. The raid and its hoped for insurrection was primarily the work and finances of the i nner six, although John Br own supplied most of the wild military plans (dreams). Newspapers like the N.Y . Tribune, which had Jewish Mas on Karl Marx as one of their European correspondants, 77 made John Brown into a mythological hero. The N.Y. Tribune, the N.Y. Times, the N.Y. Post , the Boston Travellor, and the Chicago Tribune all built up the mythical image of John Brown 78 as a Moses like figure. In real ity, the man was nothing of the Biblical saint that they described him as. UNITARIAN/SECRET SOCIETIES' PLANS AFTER JOHN BROWN The plans of the Secret Societies in accord with the designs of International Ba nkers, saw some great opportunities if war could be started and the South defe ated. One item was to start social experiments that they hoped would then spread to the nation and to the world. After John Brown was executed, another Rosicrucian was selected to carr y out the work that Brown had failed to accomplish, his name was Abraha m Lincoln. The Masons split the Democratic Party (see the Appendix List of Presidential Candidates) as well as running a third Mason on yet a fourth party- the Constitutional Union. The votes we re scattered enough that Lincoln won with a minority of the popular votes. The South had be en properly agitated by the manipulated and controlled Press to believe they needed to secede, if Linc oln were elected. George L. Stearns, leased two plantations in Tennessee. In 1869, a group of Boston abolitionists established a \"Sout hern Industrial School and La bor Enterprise\" on a Georgia plantation. What were these? Ma ny of these types were their experiments to create the social institutions that they wanted. An example of this social \"New Order\" t ype expermentation was attempted by Robertson James and Garth Wilkinson James. These tw o brothers were the son of a Mason and Swendenborgian philosoph er Henry James,Sr. Besi des training in Europe, they went to the New England academy of Franklin Sanborn, who had fi nanced John Brown. They formed the Gordon Colony after the American Civil War in northern Florida. The colony was an experiment in a Utopian community using the freed black slaves, to prepare them \"to take part in the new heaven and new earth\" that the Swedenborgians were prop hesing was coming. Usin g Fourier's \"scientific principles\" they hoped to achieve a min iture \"Swedenborg New Jerusalem on earth.\" 79 All across the Americas, Masons led revoluti ons. Just to name a few of these masonic revolutionaries who will be recognized by those who are familiar with the various national histories: Eloy Alfaro - Ecuador, anti- Christian Mason revolutionary Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla - Mexico, Mason revolutionary Francisco de Miranda - Vene zuala, Mason revolutionary In an interview Daniel Ortego of the Sandini stas said that the origins of the political development of Sandino and his m ovement was the Masonic lodge. 79a "},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Later, a man who had joined a secret Masonic lodge in Switzerland under the name of Ulianov Zederbaum, 80 would finally succeed in setting up this Utopian goal on a large scale.

His perception reached far beyond the established body of knowledge. This chapter will begin with four astute o bservations by various people. Then it will take a fresh chronological probing of the origins of the Mormon religion, s howing how those four observations relate to Mormonism and the Power. Let's begin with an o bservation by Mormon leader Brigham Young at a meeting at LDS headquarters in 1845, \"When we come to the connections we di scover that we a ll sprung back to the settlement of New England about 200 years ago. It is but a little more than that time when Father Smith, the Goddards, Richards, Youngs and Kimballs were all in one family--as it were. We are all relations. It is only three generations back that Brother Joseph Smith's family were related to this family.\" 1 Along with this observation goes what Joseph Smith told his sixth cousins Orson and Parley Pratt in the 1830's that their \"fathers and his all sprang from the same man a few generations ago.\" 2 Observation #1: The Mormon leadership and many of the original converts to Mormoni sm came from th e same progenitor. Bernard DeVoto, a schola r studying Mor monism wrote, \"Some subtlety of cl imate, racial stock or social organization on the frontier of New England an d New York made the air fecund. A circle described on a radius of one hundred and fifty miles around such a center as Pittsfiel d, Massachusetts, would include the birthplace of ninety percent of the American sects and of an even greater percentage of their prophets. Many prophets before Joseph Smith revealed God's will within that circle, and many more came after him.\" 3 Observation #2: 90% of America's new religions and even more of her prophets came from a certain racial group of people located in the geographic area defined by a circle with a radius 100 miles around the center pt. at Pittsfield, Mass. A very controversial book arrived in 1982. This author has read the criticism of the book, and although some of the book is pure speculation, and 1-track scholarship, this author also agrees with that book's three authors that the bulk of the research is not refuted by any of the critiques. To quote a small portion which briefly summarizes an intricate story, \"We have formulated a"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"hypothesis of a bloodline, descended from Jesus, which has continued up to the prese nt day...But our researches have persuaded us that the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau does involve a serious attempt by influential people to reestablish a Merovingian monarchy in France, if not indeed in the whole of Europe--and that the claim to legitimacy of such a monarchy rests on a Merovingian descent from Jesus. . .And it would be apparent why the Protocols of the Elders of Sion speak of a new king 'of the holy seed of David.'\" 4 The researchers establish that the Masons are intimately part of the conspiracy to establich a new messiah, who is a descendent of Jesus Christ (claimed descendent, that is.) Observation #3: The Masonic Lodges have been part of plan by a powerful bloodline which claims to be the lineal descendents of Jesus, and seeks to e stablish their rule. The machinatio ns of this bloodline underlie much of the political and religious activities of Europe, especially Scotland and France. William J. Schnoebelen, who became a Master Mason, and a Wican High Priest, and studied in the esoteric Europ ean Masonic rites and had the highest Druid Witch as his mentor, later went on to join the Mormon church. His book Mormonism's Temple of Doom is an astute observation of how Magick, Masonry, and Mormonism's Temple ceremony are the same. On one page alone he indicates fifteen ceremonial similarities (p.43). The grips, oaths, prayers, garments, and the Mormon temple's design s are copied from Magick and Masonry, and are complete with occult significance. 5 Observation #4: The most sacred M ormon religious ceremonies, which are held in their temples come from Masonry and Magick. All three are practicing what is called the occult. THE PURITANS \"The revival of chiliasm in the later Middle Ages...had been kept alive in the Middle Ages in Jewish apocal ypticism...Throughout the Middle Ages Jewish teachers and commentators, studying Old Testament prophecy and even astronomical phenomena, predicted the appearance of the Messiah and the establishment of a Messianic kingdom.\" 6 Jewish rabbi Abba Hillel Silver wr ote, \"The hope of the Messiah did not at any time disappear in Israel. 7 The great Jewish philosopher Maim onides felt that belief in the Messiah was an essential article of faith: \"King Messiah will arise in the future and will restore the kingship of David to its ancient condition...he will rebuild the Temple and gather the exiled of Israel...all the laws will return as they were in the past.\" This belief system al so included a belief in a resurrection of the dead, a last j udgement, and a New J erusalem. The last great king would be a human figure with t he blood of David, the Messiah. 8 "},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"The beliefs called chiliasm or premillialism were branded as Jewish by both Luther and Calvin, and the Augsburg Confession of Faith. The introduction of millenial belie fs and the occult occured in the British Isles when the Stuarts, part of the bloodline that secretly claimed to descent from Jesus, took the English throne. The Puritans began during this period in England, and their speculation about the Millenium was on a grand scale. 9 Certain elements of the Puritans were very much involved with the occult too. 10 The millenarian Puritans suffered political defeat in England, but were able to relocate to the New World. The first puritan group is kn own as the Pilgrims. The famous Pilgrims would retain a certain separateness from the later Puritan groups that would arrive to populate Massachusetts, 12 and Connecticut. Johnathan Edwards gave in tellectual stature to millenial beliefs. 13 The idea of a coming Millenial Kingdom of a Jewish Messiah led Puritans to feel that th ey had a divine mi ssion to the world, 14 much in the manner that the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses view themselves today. NEW ENGLANDERS & THE BURNED-OVER DISTRICT The revivals of the Great Awakening and the Second Great Awakening produced great resurgences in religious activity. Researchers found th eir hottest points of revival, in those areas where descendents of the Puritans resided. 15 Michael Barkum in his book Crucible of the Mil lennium discusses man y of the connections between the revivals and the Millen ial religions that sprang up in what is called the \"burned-over district of New York.\" The burned- over area produced Mo rmonism, Adventism, as wel l as a host of other religious groups incl uding 55 communal groups during the years of 1842-1848. 16 Two of the better known grou ps are the Oneida communal group and the Shakers. The burned-over area was settled by fami lies, the majority of which had come from western Connecticut, w estern Massachusetts, and western Vermont. 17 The New England ers tended to mo ve in groups of families en masse. Where that did not occur, relatives would join afterwards which meant that communities were usually culturally homogeneous and blood related. 18 THE FAMILIES THAT STARTED MORMONISM It is important to note that the families which formed the nucleus of early Mormonism moved together from Connecticut to Vermont and then on to the Palmyra, New York area. 19 Not only were they intermarried, but they claimed to be Jewish. 20 The Jewish Bennett family was also influential on Joseph Smith, Jr.'s thinking. Three prominent families in this group were the Walters- Winchell-Hurlbut families. 21 Other families in the group included those of Cowdery, Young, and those related to Royal Barney, Sr., Jabez Carter, Orrin Porter Rochwel, Samuel F. Lawrence, Alva Beman and Erastus Ives. 22 From these families came men that were to play important part in the creation of Mormonism. For instance, Luman Walters, a magician who went to Europe and studied the occult, was related to Joseph"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Smith, Jr.'s wife through the common ancestor Thomas Tuttle. Luman Walters passed his occult mantle of magick power to Joseph Smith, Jr. Winc hell was anothe r occult mentor of Joseph Smith. 24 His family had followed th e Smiths to the Palmyra , N.Y. area from Vermont. 25 Winchell introduced the use of the Rod of Aaron into the group in 1799. 26 While in Vermont members of these families had formed a secret religious fraternity called by outsiders the \"Fraternity of Rodmen.\" They were millenial, believed they were Jewish, and believed in restoring the true religion, and that they would someday become masters of the American continent. 27 Yet, nobody has given any attenti on to the fact, these people later were the original Mormons. BLOOD LINES Critics who portray Joseph Smith, Jr. as illiterate, superstitious, a liar, and con-artist have only served to cloud the truth about the origins of the Mormon church. Joseph Smith, Jr.'s people were very keen on genealogy. His mother shows in her book about her son her amazing awareness of the genealogical history of their entire family. 28 She traces the Smiths back to 1666. 29 It is clear from various statements that not only was Joseph Smith chosen for his work as a pr ophet because of his intellectual abilities, 30 but that his family had been passing down their beliefs and spiritual blessings from generation to generation for some time. 31 The author's research shows that Jo seph Smith, Jr. was a dynamic individual, with ma ny abilities. 32 The evidence indicates that the creation of Mormonism may have been a well orchestrated plan by several families to set themselves up as the priest-prophet rulers of the New World that they had claimed was theirs years before Joseph Smith, Jr. ever anno unced his an gelic visits. In contrast to the role that the Masonic Lodges played in introducing the occult and generic religion, tw o religious groups that were openly occultic played possibly no role in the future formation of Mormon heresy. These were the Rosicrucians and the Moravian Brethren, whose leader Count Zinzendorf was head of the Rose Croix from 1744 to 1749. One of the names the Moravian Brethren went by is the Moravian Brothers of the Order of Religious Freemasons. Many of the Moravian Brethren were of Jewish blood, although nominally Lutheran. Th ey were gnostic. 33 Various books written by Rosicrucians and Freemasons, which promoted magick, astrology, mysticism, rationalism, deism, and various mystery religions and the occult, were guite popular in colonial New England and made guite an impact. A study of men connected with forming new religion s, repeatedly indicates the far ranging impact of men like Boehme, Voltaire, Paine, Swendenborg, Charles Fourier and others. Acting behind the veil of the Masonic Lodge, wave after wave of new thinking rolled into America. Later, this chapter will discuss how the Philadelphians, organized by the Masons 34 , would influence Saint-Simon through his friendship with the Philadelphian leader Jacgues Rigomer-Bazin. Saint-Simon wrote The New Christianity and his ideas generated religious a nd communistic experiments 35 that eventually would infl uence the Mormons to adopt communism."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"THE FRATERNITY OF RODSMEN After Nathaniel Woods was excommunicat ed from his ministry with the Congregational Church he formed a secret religious group 36 that included the parents of Joseph Smith, Jr. 37 Through Congregational records the link between the Winc hells, Woods, Cowde rys and Smiths can be made. 38 The evidence suggests that the occult practices that Lucy Smith openly admitted her family practiced 39 were likely participated in by the entire set of families that formed the Fraternity of Rodmen. Mormon scholar D. Michael Quinn writes, \"Such coincidence of time, place, a nd occult activity among these people suggests that there could have been personal acquaintance that linked them and encou raged them to partici pate in similar and joint occult activities. 40 EARLY MASONIC TIES Heber C. Kimball, 41 Hyrum Smith (brother of Joseph Smith, Jr.) 42 and others of Joseph's family 43 were Freemasons at Palmyra before Joseph ever announced any of his visions or gold plates. Men like the Mason itinerant preacher Lorenzo Dow came through their territory. 44 Items used by the Smith family prior to Joseph's revelations, also indicate a Masonic influence. A Masonic dove medallion from an English Masonic Lodge was used by Joseph Smith, Jr. Some of the magic items that still survive today of the Smith family are 3 magic laman parch ments, a magic Ju piter talisman, the Masonic dove medallion, another Talisman possibly the magic seal of Jupiter, a magic pouch, a healing handkerchief, and a healing amulet (a cape blessed by Joseph use d by the John L. Butler family). 45 Dr. Reed Durham, director of the LDS Institute of Religion at the University of Utah and president of the Mormon History Association announced his discovery in 1974 of information about Joseph Smith's masonic Jupiter talisman, \"...I should like to initiate all of you into what is perhaps the strangest, the most mysterious, occult-like esoteric, and yet Masonically oriented practice ever adopted by Joseph Smith...All available evidence suggests that Joseph Smith the Prophet possessed a magical Masonic medallion, or talisman, which he worked during his lifetime and which was evidently on his person when he was martyred.... originally purchased from the Emma Smith Bidamon family, fully notarized by that family to be authentic and to have belonged to Joseph Smith, can now be identified as a Jupiter talisman...The characters on the talisman are primarily in Hebrew, but there is one inscription in Latin. Every letter in the Hebrew alphabet has a numerical equivalent and those numerical equivalents make up a magic square....To the Egyptians, Jupiter was known as Ammon, but to the Greeks he was Zeus: the ancient sky Father...Jupiter is a lways associated with high positions, getting owe's own way, and all forms of status....The purpose of the Table of Jupiter in talismanic magis (magic?) wa s to be able to call upon the celestial intelligences, assigned to the particular talisman, to assist one in all endeavors. The names of the deities which we gave to you, who could be invoked by the Table were always written on the talisman or represented by various numbers.\" 46 "},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"A guest in the Smith's home around 1830 wrote, \"This Joseph Smith, Senior, we soon learned, from his own lips, was a firm believer in witchcraft and other supernatural things; and he had brought up his family in the same belief.\" 47 In the rituals of the 13th, 14th, and 21st degrees of Masonry the legend (derived from cabbalistic sources) is told of Enoch's gold plate. The resemblances to Joseph Smith, Jr.'s story about finding the gold plates is i nteresting. The stories are basically identical, which suggests Mormonism may have be en founded from the beginning on a Masonic legend. 48 The use of crystal-gazing which the Smith family, including Joseph Smith, Jr. and their friends, used was called scrying and was practiced in the Masonic Lodges. 49 These points have been brought out to give the investiga tor the feel that the Fraternity of Rodmen, which are known to have used the Rod of Aaron to obtain revelation, 50 may have also had affiliation with witchcraft and masonry. The leaders of the Fraternity had previously been notable citizens, and one had been a state legislator. 51 The Fraternity felt led to build a temple. 52 The Fraternity became apocalyptic and upset the non-believers in the area. The night that the Frater nity prophesied would bring an apocalyptic event 14 January, 1802, only brought gunfire from the Middletown, Vt. militia who wer e frightened by the group. 53 One witness claimed Joseph Smith, Sr. was one of the leaders of the Fraternity. Justus Winchell, who was involved in the fraternity, became the Mormon pr ophet-to-be's occult mentor. 54 After 1802, the group began moving to Palmyra, N.Y. It has been interesting to note that Palmyra, N.Y. repeatedly shows up in this auth or's Masonic research as a real stronghold of Masonry, and Poultney, Vt. as a place where new religious ideas seem to appear. 55 ISRAEL ESTABLISHED BY MASONS Nine years after the Smiths had moved to Palmyra, N.Y. the Jewish Mason Mordecai Manuel Noah reestablished a City of Refuge for the Jewish people of the world in Buffalo, N.Y. which was about 90 miles from the Smiths. The great event was on September 15, 1825. The National Advocate advertised the event calling on Jews world-wide to partici pate in the founding of t his \"City of Refuge.\" What is interesting is that this great ceremony ended up as a Masonic parade and a Masonic ceremony where a cornerstone of Ararat was placed with the inscription \"Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God--The Lord is one. ARARAT The Hebrew's Refuge, founded by Mordecai Manuel Noah\". The sandstone monument was placed with a Masonic ceremony. The Reverend Addison Searle of the Episcopal Church of St. Paul played a big role in the event. The church ceremonies opened in the Episcopal church led by the Reverend, followed by a Jewish Declaration of Independence, and a call for Jews around the world to gather in the state of New York so that they could enlighten themselves and qualify for a restoration to their ancient heritage. Afte rwards, Noah returned to New York City and advertised his reestablishment of the Jewish nation. This strange event seems most odd. Why the Masons in Buffalo went to"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"such lengths for such a ceremony isn't clear, nor is Noah's authority to be a Judge of Israel. 56 THE RESTORATION- A MASONIC KINGDOM RULED BY THE LINEAL DESCENDENTS OF JESUS Joseph Smith, with outstanding tale nt in cabalistic wizardry, 57 set out to restore the priesthood of Israel and restore the religion of Jesus. 58 Joseph Smith's restoratio n was in fact in line with the Masonic/ Rosicrucian beliefs of esoteric Chr istianity, a type of occultic secret mystery religion t aught by the higher Masons, supposedly the original Christiani ty. Smith's Sept. 1832 revelation, describes a lineage for his beliefs that re sts on esoteric Christianity. 59 Manly P. Hall, 33 degree, calls this \"Mystic Christianity\", and describes it in detail in his book The Secret Teachings of All Ages. Smith made a revision of Genesis called the Book of Moses which was in line with the o ccultic Mystic Christian teachings 60 and its gnosticism. Emanue l Swedenborg was a herme tic philosopher and mystic Christian Mason of high rank. Smith was familiar with Swedenborg's teachings, 61 (indeed Swedenborg's publications were on the shelves at Smith's hometown library and circulating through the Smith's area.) 62 Smith adopted Swedenbor g's concept of 3 heavens, with the highest being what Swedenborg called the \"celetial kingdom.\" The caballa which forms a basis for mystic Christianity also provides Smith for some of his answers that are canonized as scripture in the Mormon Doctrines and C ovenants. Compare D & C 77:2 with Seder Olam Quest. 24, compare (cf. ) D & C 77:4 with Seder 01am Question 23, cf. D & C 77:8 with Seder 01am guestion 42, and D & C 77:15 with Seder Olam guestion 58. Joseph Smith believed the Jewish Cabala was sacred knowledge which had been pa ssed from God to Adam and from Adam to Enoch, to Noah, on down the line through Melchizedek to Moses. This priesthood has performed magic. Remember, the Cab alla is intimately part of magic. Indeed, much magic d erives from the Caballa. The Masons, Rosicrucians, and m ystics like the Ephrata Commune were already practicing the Order of Melchizedek when he established the Order of Mechizedek after the Order of Enoch. By the way, the mystics at Ephrata had baptiz ed the dead long before Joseph Smith copied this mystic ritual. 63 Joseph Smith, in a fashion like various Masonic and Magick groups, gave his Mormon leaders and himself new names. 64 Smith's new name was Enoch. 65 Masonry claimed to be derived from the ancient mystery religions, 66 and it was those mysteries that Joseph Smith intended to restore. In D & C 76:7 Smith announces, \"And to them will I reveal all mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come.\" Joseph Smith needed to restore the mystery reli gions involved in mystic Christianity, because he believed the magic and occult in Freemasonry was only a shadow, a vestige of the real thing. An examination of Masonic literature prior to the 20th century will reveal teachings on the lineage of Jesus Christ, the importance of"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"the Holy Grail (a blood line from Jesus), the mys tical meaning of the crucifixation, the discipling of Jesus by Eastern gurus and other ideas. These are mentioned he re, because the lack of public awareness of the old age of these teachings. Jo seph Smith was not the first to claim Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and sired a royal blood line through her. 67 The New Agers today are not the originators of the idea that Jesus was a Hindu adept, initiated into the Temple of Melchizedek like Pythagorus. Even Justin Martyr noted that the Christian Christ was a parallel to the sons of Jupiter of the pagan mystery religions. 68 This explains how important it was to Joseph Smith's family that he was a son of Jupiter. And his type of knowledge was preserved in the Masonic lodges. The Mormon Apostle Herber C. Kimball verifies that Joseph Smith, Jr. set out to restore the mysteries of Masonry (the mystery religions & mystic Christianity) when he explained, \"we have received some pressious things through the Prophet on the preasthood...thare is a similarity of preast Hood in masonary. Br Joseph s es masonry was taken from preasthood but has become degenerated, b ut menny things are perfect.\" 69 Joseph Smith was speaking about tokens, signs, keys and other masonic things before he was initiated into the Masonic Lodge in 1842. 70 Joseph Smith claimed that an angel brought him the lost key-word to several Masonic degrees, that would allow him to progress further than the highest Masons. 71 The concept that Mormonism was a higher form of Masonry can be seen in the Mormon writer M.F. Cowley's book Wilford Woodruff, p.160,\"The fraternity sought for in that organization (Masonry) was superseded by a more perfect fraternity found in the vows and covenants whic h the endowment in the House of God afforded members of the church.\" Joseph Smith, Jr. set out to create a high le vel super rite of Masonry, perhaps meant to be supreme over all the other rites. Along with this, he took the practice of white magick to its highest level in North America. That is why the highest Druid witch in North America advised his student witch Schn oebelen that if he wanted to practice the highest form of white magick, he should become a Mormon and partak e of the Templ e ceremonies. 72 This will surprise many people, e specially many Mormons, until they understand Magick. An expert Enochian Magician quotes the supreme evil magician Crowley (33° Scottish Rite and other Rites) as defining Magick as \"the science and act of causing change to occur in conformity with will.\" This expert magician further explains, \"Essentially, Magick is the ability to bring about a willed change. Suppose t hat you are hungry. W hen you will yourself to eat, and then fix yourself a sandwich and eat it, you are performing Magick, at least to a de gree. If you will to converse with a friend, and then pick up a phone and call him or her, you are a magician. We all go through l ife performing Magi ck. Most of it is so ordinary that we don't th ink of it in magical terms, but any willed change in ourselves or in our environm ent is Magick.\" 73 From this the reader will realize that many Mormons have been duped into practic ing Magick in the Mormon temples without knowing it. One doesn't have to know he is practicing Magick to practice it. However, for those men who have joined witchcraft before"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"joining Freemasonry or Mormonism, they recognize the close parallels of the Masonic initiations from the beginning with witchcraft, and Mormons going to the Temple endowments with prior witchcraft experience recognize the parallels with the endowment ceremonies. Schnoebelen was one of the few men to have gone through Witchcraft, Masonry, and Mormonism and to have forsaken it for Christ. His book does an excellent job of revealing the magical meanings and powers involved in the Mormon temple ceremony. (See book recommendations at the back of this chapter.) Even his book doesn't cover all the similarities, by the way which are not coincidental. They are too numerous to be coincidental, but even more important the history of their origins show that it is not coincidence. Why did the Mormon leaders decide to keep this all secret from their own people? Why haven't the M ormon people been told about the Masonic and occult overtones to their religion? First, they have guietly been told if they look close at what has been said. Second, witchcraft and Luciferian worship within Masonry has always preferred to be veiled. Witchcraft has always preferred darkness and secrecy. Even today, New Age recruiters are telling people that they can \"expand their potential\" and other sales pitches, rather than saying, \"Come worship Lucifer.\" An ex-New Age recruiter who was into Luciferian worship is now exposing their sales pitches and warning people how New Age recruits are not told when recruited that they are being led to worship Lucifer. Further, there has been a mass deception to keep hidden that the Mormon leaders are high ranking Freemasons. This deception can only be explained in full by un derstanding that a conspiracy of great magnitude is underway. It appears that befor e the Mormons got the ir recruiting speels worked out, that some of the original missionary elders were telling people about the mysteries. They w ere very soon instructed by Joseph Smith, Jr. not to ever tell converts about the mysteries. Joseph Smith's instructions to th e elders to keep mum about the mysteries are preserved in a book compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith of his teachings entitled Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith. \"Elders to Preach Repentence and Let Mysteries Alone...Declare the first principles, and let mysteries alone, lest ye be overthrown. \" 74 \"Strive not about the mysteries of the kingdom, cast not your pearls before swine, give not the bread of the children to dogs, lest you and the children should suffer, and you thereby offend your righteous Judge.\" 75 See footnote fo r further references. As early as 1843, a Mormon secret order ca lled \"The Holy Order\" which involved both men and women had been create d. This order wore a special garment with the M asonic square and compass. The Rites of the group included reenacting scenes from the Garden of Eden. 76 If the reader will allow a minor digression, I would like to emphasize that one of the important parts to magic is will power. If you look into Hitler and Nazi doctrine you wi ll find will power was one of the most impo rtant features of Nazi doctrine. Why? Hitler and many of the Nazi leaders were into witchcraft. Did the Nazi's overtly tell the masses that their will power doctrines were"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"witchcraft renamed? No. Neither is the New Age today, especially in the Christian churche s. 98% of the Christian churches in the Puget Sound area are preaching New Age doctrines of some kind. 7 The idea of willpower is being promoted hard in many Christian churches. The World Power has suppressed all the information they could about the Nazi's Satanic religion, because it touches too close to home. 78 Joseph Smith's mother wrote, \"...let not the reader suppose that. . . we stopt our labor and went at tryin g to win the faculty of Abrac, drawing magic circles, or sooth saying, to the neglect of all kinds of business. We never during our lives suffered one important interest to swallow up every other obligation.\" 79 To paraphrase Lucy, she is saying that the faculty of Abrac, and these occult practices were important, but not to the point of making the Smiths unbalanced. The Smiths were able to carry out all their other obligations in life. Masonic sources show that the Faculty of Abrac went back in Masonic history even predating the founding of their constitution. 80 For more information concerning the Masonic \"way of winning the faculty of Abrac\", the reader is encouraged to read the sources indicated in the footnote. William Wines Phelps in the town of Canandaigua close to Joseph Smith's home, discussed in 1828 in the Ontario Phoenix (Aug. 25, 1830) about the \"very Ancient Masonic Charm, or the way of winning the Faculty of Abrac,...\" Both Lucy (see pg. 37 of her book) and Joseph Smith, Sr. believed in a need for a restoration. 81 What that restoration was to be, appears to have included then a \"restoration\" of mystical Christianity whic h meant the reinstitution of magic and the occult into Christianity, and a rej ection of all the principle dogmas of orthodox churches. Both of Joseph, Jr.'s parents repeatedly went on record repudiating all the de nominations that then existed. The restoration \"movement\" was not an organized body but rather variously believing individuals including men like Roger Williams that believed there were no real Christian churches. Williams didn't even believe the church he led was real, but he looked for a future restoration. Apparently, for the Fraternity of Rodsmen and the Smiths none of the esoteric groups (Rosicrucians, Moravians, the Ephrata commune, et. al.) had properly restored enough magic and a priesthood enough to satisfy them. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO GRASP. It indicates why the One-World-Power has helped the Mormon church. Lucy and Joseph weren't blindly lashing out at Christianity, they knew exactly what they believed in, and it wasn't being taught in the Christian churches. UNIVERSALISM Joseph Smith, Sr. wa s a member of the Universalist church 82 and most likely had contact with occultic and mystic Masons that were preaching for the Universalist Church in that area. The first Universalist minister in Western NY used o ccult powers and a rod. 83 The Universalist mi nister who preached at Palmyra, NY from Jan. to Mar. 1825 likely mentioned to his congregations about his visions of Christ. 84 Universalism is directly connected to Freemasonry.(See chapter 2.3). The public image of the Jehovah's Witness and Mormons is that"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"they teach that they alone will be saved. This is not the case. According to the WT, at Armaggeddon only baptised JWs will be saved. 85 But at the re surrection almost all of sinful mankind (the WT figures 20 billion sinful people) 86 are to be resurrected and given a second chance. Their doctrine is veiled universalism. Likewise, the Mormon church envisions essentially all of mankind will be saved minus a handful of exceptions. Some end up going to a lesser heaven, but this lesser heaven is claimed to have essentially all the blessings of a Christian heaven. MORMONISM ANOTHER NODE IN THE MATRIX OF POWER The Mormon religion was from its inception meant to be the mystic Christian religion that the Masons had claimed existed in ancient times, complete with the blood line of Jesus Christ. Many of the early Mormons ha d been Masons before joining up with Joseph Smith, Jr. \"Among the prominent Mormons wh o had been Masons for years were the following, though the list does not include them all: Hyrum Smith, Newel K. Whitney, Heber C. Kimball, John C. Bennett, George Miller, Lucius N. Scovil, Elijah Fordham, John Smith, Austin Cowles, Noah R ogers, and James Adams.\" 87 The Masonic career of Heber C. Kimball, an outstanding early Mormon leader was described by his daughter Helen Mar Kimball in an article she wrote in Woman's Exponent, (Vol. XII, p.126). \"It was in 1823 when he received th e first degrees of Masonry in the lodge at Victor Flats, Ontario Co., New York, and in 1824, previous to receiving all of the rights up to the Royal Arch Masons, the Morgan affair broke out and the Masonic Hall in Canandaigua was burned by anti-Masons, and all their records consumed. It seems that the Masons were persecuted and the same unjust proceedings were heaped upon them by the anti-Masons that have been upon those who hold the Priesthood. ' Not as many as three of us,' father says , 'could meet togethe r, unless in secret, without being mobbed. I have been driven from my houses and possessions with many of my brethren belonging to that fraternity five times, by mobs led by some of the ir leading men. . . I have been as true as an angel from the heavens to the co venants I made in the lodge at Victor....I wish that all men were Masons and would live up to their professsion, then the world would be in a much better state than it is now.\" Several items are noteworthy. Heber C. Kimball was a staunch Mason his entire life. The theory that Mormons quit being Masons after the Nauvoo Lodge was shut down is a deception. The Mason Sidney Rigdon was a Cambellite leader who had two communes. When Mormons missionaries happened to come through his area Rigdon, immediately invited them in as guests, and in a rather quick way, pronounced to his group that he had discovered the true religion and its new prophet Joseph Smith. That a leader of a group could change overnite, and hand his churches over to another, is rather suspicious. Th ere have been a number of tie-ins made between Rigdon and Smith, before they officially met. Although it is difficult to know for sure, it does appear that Smith and Rigdon were in some type of collusion. Alexander Campbell, who disliked Freemasonry, but had tried to work with Sidney Rigdon wrote, \"Rigdon had been for some time"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"diligently engaged in endeavoring, by obscure hints and glowing millenial theories, to excite the imaginat ion of his hearers, and in seeking by fanciful interpretations of Scripture to prepare the minds of the churches of Northern Ohio for so mething extraordinary in the near future. He sought especially in private to convince certain influential persons that, along with the primitive gospel, supernatural gifts and mi racles ought to be re stored, and that, as at the beginning, all things should be held in common....Cowdery and Pratt soon made their appearance in Mentor [one of Rigdon's communes] , and we re received as ol d acguaintences by Rigdon, who at once publicly endorsed their claims and with several others was immersed into the new faith...\" The day-book used by Joseph Smith in Nauvoo is now in the possession of the Iowa Masonic Libr ary. It reveals that the Masonic Lodge funds were considered but a p art of the Mormon community's resources. 88 Interestingly, Horace Greeley, a Republican candidate for president in 1872, and the publisher of the important New York Tribune would give much publ icity for the Millerites 89 and some for the Mormons, while at the same time denouncing Masonry. Greeley also supported communism, 90 and the occult and spiritism that oddly enough was what the European Masons were promoting. All this at the same time he was maintain ing a highly visible an ti-Masonic profile. Is the reader beginning to see how this conspiracy operates? And this book was written in order for Christians to realize that just because som eone is publicly against Masonry doesn't mean he is against the New World Order. They feel they are sure to win, because they have camoflouged their power in a Matrix with seemingly independent nodes. Let us return to the restoration that Smith was bringing to Christianity. Mormonism isn't simply the Temple ceremonies, but it encompasses an authority structur e of priests and a priest/king/prophet ruler along with its mass of revelations and doctrines. Many of these \"revelations\" are simply the regurgitation of masonic beliefs from the ages. Ev en the approach to doctrine is definitively masonic. A most remarkable book Line Upon Line put out by the liberal Mormon scholars shows the remarkable parallels be tween the generic theology of the Masons and the generic theology of the Mormons. As the LDS church promotes such men, even while criticizing some of their findings, one concludes that this book's scholarship and documentation is not only accurate but approved. Mormon scholar Stephen L. Richards writes in this book, \"Dogmatism and bigotry have been the deadliest enemies of true religion in the long past.\" \"The very elasticity of prayers, ceremonies, and procedure is additional evidence to me of the adoptability of our religion to human needs and therefore of its divinity.\" 91 He should have added their elasticity of what is doctrinally and fundamentally true also, f or Line Upon Line clearly documents that every major Mormon b elief has gone through changes. Change and development characterize Mormon doctrine, consistency does not. For instance, on p. 178, Mormon scholar Bryd Kirkland"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"states, \"...Smith himself departed radically from his own teachings, giving precendent for Young's additional innovations.\" 92 Mormon Apostle Orson Pratt then in turn deviated from Brigham Young, 93 the second Prophet's views, an d Brigham Young censured Pratt's concepts of God. An official censu ring by Young occured in 1860 and 1865. 94 Pratt felt God was \"The Great First Cause\". The idea was rejected by Young. Without going the details, it can be stated that both men we re building upon contradictory teachings of Joseph Smith, Jr. 95 The issue here is not which view point of Joseph Smith was right, but for Mormons the issue revolv ed around a pow er struggle. As far as doctrine Mormons are given the flexibility in deciding for themselves. The issue was that Brigham Young felt his authority was being challenged, and he was determined to remain \"the Prophet.\" Today, Young's views of eternal progression and the \"second death\" would be rejected as heretical by many Mormons. The generic doctrines of the Mormons is not so troubling then as the authority that the rank and fil e give to their leaders. It is conceivable that a Mo rmon could even agree with orthodox doctrine, but it is not conceivable that he could remain Mormon and remain out from under the authority of his King/Priest. Some Mormons are attending New Age churches, but are members in good standing at the LDS church, because they pay their tithe. 96 They receive their home visits, and are not treated negatively by other Mormons. They are not seen as questioning the LDS church's authority. (Chapter 2.9 picks up the story of the LDS church after Joseph Smith.) THE IMPORTANT ISSUES People are believ ing false doctrine, beca use they are believing in a false authority. This holds true in a wide range of religious groups. The supposed \"restoration\" of authority in a priesthood led by a lineal descendent of the seed of David, is the greater threat, than the restoration of mystic Christian doctrine and its magic. The seriousness of the threat may be seen when one is aware of how widespread the masonic and witchcraft support is for this claimed \"seed of David\" which is being prepared to rule the world. Bear in mind that the symbols of Luciferian worship adorn the Mormon temples, and that demons are consi dered part of the same eternal family as the gods, angels, and mortals are in but considered simply to be at a different stage in growth or development. 97 The Mormon missionaries themselves will tell people that the authority issue--that is, what authority is the right one to submit to, is the crucial issue before people. Yet, the restored priesthood they bring is in submission to the same men who control witchcraft and Freemasonry, and who ha ve at the highest levels pledged alligience to Lucifer. This is the authority of the mystery religions. Another choice besides the mystery religions is to place oneself under the authority of Christ a nd the Christian scriptures. Mystic Christianity is a negation of Christ's teachings. This author has seen it seems about every dist ortion possible done to the pure message of Christ by Masons. The Ma son who wrote Esoteric Masonry claims in the book that Jesus was actually a sperm and Judas was"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"the male sexual organ holding his bag. People like this may claim to be Christian, that is their perogative, but what this Author would like is for legitimate followers of Christ to guit honoring these wolves in sheep clothing. It is also vital we recognize who these people are so that their false messiah will be rejected. In contrast to Christianity, which stresses all men are sinners, the traditional doctrine of Mormonism is that man is essentially good by nature. 98 John A. Widtsoe, a leadin g Mormon writer, argued after Darwin's theory of evolution came out, th at \"God was not the creator, nor was he omnipotent. He too was governed by natural law, which was fundamental.\" 99 Again returning to doctrine, the underlying bottom line in Mormonism, is the Masonic idea of flexible truth. Thaddeus E. Shoemaker, Mormon scholar, advocates that the key to a dynamic faith is to have a theology based on speculation—what he calls \"speculative Theology\". 100 The generic Mormon mish-mash of Theology, this homemade brew that each Mormon priest and theology student cooks from his own recipe, is very representative of masonic philosophy. Add to that a leadership which gives revelations based on esoteric masonic beliefs, and add to that that all the Mormon prophets have been Masons, then is it any surprise that the ideas of universalism, polytheism, exaltation to godhood, multipl e heavens, and many other ideas which have surged through the Masonic Lodges and the books they publish, are part of Mormonism? The Mormon temple in Salt Lake City is covered with Masonic symbols. These are explained by some Mormon scholars to have been placed there because Mormonism and Masonry come from the same origin. The explanation the Mormon Gavin gives for the Star of David on the Mormon temple is \"It must be remembered that the Mormons are Israelites, being descendants of Abraham through the lineage of Joseph who was sold into Egypt....As members of the great nation of Israel, the Mormons have a legal right to use the special insignia and emblems which that ancient nation developed.\" 101 What's involved in starting a new religion? Extraodinary new material is being presented bel ow. Its contribution is that it may help us to understand or theorize w hat happened to Joseph Smith Jr. A MODERN JOSEPH SMITH One day in modern times an older child was l ooking at the fire in the fireplace when he saw a shining metallic gold plate. The plate had a type of hieroglyphics or symbol writing that he wrote down. The original draw ing made that day is reproduced below. This event led to further revelat ions, and the angelic beings brought him golden plates. He found he had an ability to translate the plates . He deciphered what they said. He learned that the symbols were from the Azruslan la nguage. He wrote a gra mmar and a dictionary of the language. This man became a respected religious leader . The plates formed the basis of a new Scriptures called The Flower of Truth. This American guru had a great deal of dignity and poise. His bearing was what one would expect from a man who had written a Bible. He"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"was a true friend to people, and came across as meek. He was faithful to what he thought was right, indeed he was somewhat of a perfectionist. He was a man of culture and integrity. He had a command of the use of words. He was also a very loving sensitive man who wore long white robes. His search for knowledge led hi m repeatedly into new realms of knowledge, and he had momentary flights into fanta sy. He preferred to investigate things on his own, he was a se lf-teacher who then taught others. Although he trusted his own research, hi s biggest shortcoming was pe rhaps his personal self- deceit. One day he got a revelation that co mpletely changed his life. He went from a modern day Joseph Smith, Jr. to a Christian. It is rare when the founder of a new religion turns his ba ck on his own New Age Bible and his own followers to follow Christ. Yet, that is what this New Age leader did, because in a later revelation he had it revealed to him that he was serving demons. Upon realizing that the plates and the translation of those plates were demonic, he turned his life over to Christ. He walked away from t he religious community he had established in Edmonton, Canada and began li ving a Christian life. How many writers of demon inspired scrip tures never learn the source of scriptures, or if they did, have never rev ealed the source of their own scriptures? It takes real moral conviction to do something like that. WHAT HAD THE DEMO NS PASSED TO HIM? It is very interesting to examine what the Demons had passed to him because today, a religious buffet is being offered the public. Real Christian faith appears to be just one of many viable options. The Flower of Truth is a syncretic work, a mixture of Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity et. al. like the lessons of so many New Age groups today. Examples from The Flower are: (shades of Bu ddhism) The Fivefold Path, p.9, \"I Who in My Christ am called the lotu s-born.\" (shades of Mormonism) The last chapter is called Doctrines and Covenants. (shades of Hinduism ) The Fivefold Path, p. 16, \"Whoever chants My names in pure devoti on to Me, I will lead to the green fields of My Kingdom.\" In the preface to the book 102 we are told, \"This book was not compiled, nor is it presented, to be a substitute or replacement for the Bible or any of th e other great scriptures. The spirit which ha s spoken to Man in the past through these old books is the same one which speaks to us now through the new. The Torah, the New Testament, the Koran, the Gita, the Flower: are all chapters in the eternal stream...\" Shades of the occult appear in The Flower. Examples are The Opening, p. 5 \"The keys to My Kingdom I give to you.\" The Opening, p. 3 \"All men shall desecrate my temple...but wherever the ash will come to rest shall spring up as a legion of pheonix from the flames endless temples.\" Even more significant than how eclectic the book is, is that it puts forth all the lies of Satan. Examples are: The Opening, p.2-\"There is no death. All men are saved.\" The Law, p. 4-\"l say unto you, ver ily, after death I do not punish.\" Revelation, p. 3 we are presented Situational Ethics- \"There is no man that knows what is truth and what is untruth, e xcept judging for himself only,...\" Below, published for the first ti me to the public in any b ook are the origin al drawings, which were entrusted to Dr. K.V.

This Bible verse in Revelations 20 has been the basis for much speculation and thought. The concept of a 1,000 year period has been extended by some to apply to other passages in Revelations, and by others like Charles T. Russell to apply to vast portions of scriptures. C.T. Russell arbitrar ily decided through the entire Bible whether a particular verse was for now, or for this 1,000 year period ca lled the Millenium. The popular concept of a 1,000 year Golden Age millenium, that has been advertised so strongly by groups like th e Watchtower Society has been rarely held by Bible scholars until the last two centuries. The appearance of this Milleni um concept on the modern scene has actually derived its pr inciple impetus not from Bibl e study as much as from a wide-spectrum of Masonic-st arted groups ranging from t he secular communists and socialists, the Second Adventists, certai n Rosicrucian groups, and the Jehovah's Witnesses. This chapter is not an investigation into the meaning of Rev. 20 and what the Bible says about the Millenium. It is an investig ation into how the conspiracy has used and manipulated people with these Millenarian vi sions. According to Scripture Satan quoted Scripture to Christ, the catc h was his motivation was wrong. A WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON Millenarian visions have been a global ph enomenon. Secret societies which have continued the Ancient Mystery religion, hav e believed in the pagan idea of cycles, and reincarnation, which has as a part of its system of thought the revolution back to a Golden Age. The Pagan religious concepts of a Golden Age (t he term is nowhere in the Bible—but often in Classical Greek and Ancient Egyptian literature) have been easy to promote in Christendom, because of their cl ose affinity to the Christian scriptures. A present day example is Hans Hofer, who in 1985 came out with his book The Final War. Hans Hofer is Socialist with Fabian beliefs, whose mentor wa s the Fabian Bertrand Russell. 1 From Germany, Hans now lives in Austral ia. His book is bei ng pushed by some esoteric groups even now that the Iron Curtain has fallen in Eastern Europe. Let us read some snippets from his book that summarize his Fabian beliefs. \"...I still believe in a coming Golden Age, a time in which suffering is little, where justice prevails and where good men and women reign on this planet earth. This new Golden Age brings fulfillment and happiness to a ll who...understand the Law of Politics and"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Economics...and accept other nations...and le t them live their own way of life according to Nature's laws...\"(T he Final War, p.6) \"To know the Golden Age is co ming is good, joyful news for those who have children that they want the best for.\"(p.7) \"All wars from the early beginning of ma nkind were nothing other than a selective process towards the will-be worl d leader. Until this process is complete, there will be no peace. Warfare goes on until only one is left, and this one will be world leader.\" \"Unless we have a world leader, a One Wo rld Government, there will be no peace, harmony, controlled trade or lasting prosperity.\"(p.9) \"...Therefore, all those wars have been noth ing else than for the natural selection process for the Would-be Worl d Leaders.\"(p.11) \"Now afte r this great struggle, the selection process towards Wo rld government, a new 'World Communism' will take over the world, which will be a far better system of communism.\" (p.32) \"The U.S.S.R. will declare World Government before the year 2000.\" (p. 45) For a much earlier instance of Millenialism a person can lo ok at the Muenster affair where another Hofmann from Ge rmany comes into view. Jewish , occultic influences with Jewish chilastic ideas within the Anabaptist movement prod uced the disasterous Muenster affair when a group of Anabaptists tried to se t up a Millenial kingdom. This affair seriously discredited those Anabaptists which had no thing in common with the Muenster Anabaptists, even though there was not justification to asso ciate the different groups for the Anabaptist in general publicaly repudiated Hofmann. It was the result of Melchior Hofmann's followers taking over Muenster in Mar., 1535 which they was renamed the New Jerusalem. There they set up the Kingdom of God and Jan of Leiden became King. A terrible Kingdom of God was created, which in turn was brutally overthrown by Catholic and Protestant forces. Interestingly, Melchi or Hofmann designated himself \"the second Enoch.\" 2 In this chapter, the reader will be presented information on how the conspiracy has introduced new religious groups with Millenial visi ons in order to further their ultimate goal of creating a gnostic one-world-relig ion based on the e fforts of man, and subservient to hierarchies, which in turn are centrally controlled. The Masonic Lodge ha s preserved and prom oted the concept of the New Age, the Golden Age, a Millenium. The twentieth century has se en the rise of secular m illeniarn vision s such as communism. With the introducti on of the New Age movement the vehicle of promotion has shifted back more to a re ligious millennialism as the e nd of the 20th century is approached. The distinction between religious and secular Millenial views is bl urred in real life. Secular ideologies, while lacki ng religious symbology have re placed the various parts of religion with secular equivalents. Men from va rious groups have coordinated their millenial views, so that it becomes diffi cult to identify the individual millenial movements as strictly secular or strictly religious. This is illustrated, by a letter which appeared on the front page of the New York Daily Tribune (Mar. 15,1843). The letter was written by a Boston abolitionist who later that year attempted to establish the Sk aneateles Community, a Utopia n experiment using Robert Owen's secular Millenial ideas. The letter wa s addressed to Albert Brisbane. Albert Brisbane was America's"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"principal exponent of the French occultist an d Utopian philos opher, Charles F ourier. A close relationship exists between the s ecular Utopian communities establ ished in the U.S. and the U.K. and the secret occult Fraternal orders in Europe a nd Fourier. (The reader is encouraged to read Fire In the Minds of Men, for a scholarly history of the connections . Then he encouraged if still wants to pursue such a study to look at the i ndividual experimental communities.) The letter reads: \"The millennium of the sacr ed writers and the golden ag e of the poets have buoyed up the drooping heart in every age a nd every condition of life. The ha rmony of the material world, its ability to supply our wants, and the constant swelling up of the Soul for a purer and better state, convince every reflecting mind that a benevolent Creator designed Man for Happiness in the present state of existe nce, in spite of all the teachings of the Church.\" In 1820, the Anglican church which was heavily mi xed with Masonry, saw some thousand Anglican priests and radicals band together and ann ounce that the \"Second Advent\" was due not in some hazy future date but at any moment. 3 GENERAL LAFEYETTE The year was 1825 and the country's attenti on was focused on the famous french General Lafayette, (a member of the Illuminati) who wa s touring the United Stat es. At every town the Masonic Lodges went to great lengths to prep are great festivities. (G eneral Lafayette had possibly been given his position in Washington 's revolutionary army due to his Masonic connections, although initia lly the Americans had been somewhat cool to putting hi m on the staff of the Continental army. The foreign military experts take n in by the American Continental Army were all Masons. Prior to Lafayette's original arrival in the colonies, French agents, with ties to the Grand Orient Masons, had been sti rring up trouble in the British colonies.) After the American Revolution's end, Lafayette went back to France, where he was to play a role in the French Revolution. Lafayette was one of the most powerful men within the secret masonic societies of Fran ce. He did have his secret Illuminati superiors. He was not only a high ranking Freemason, but a leader of th e Carbonari (called Forest Masons). It is interesting to note that the man the Masons selected to wine and dine with Lafayette in the New York area on his 1825 tour was a farmer from the town of Poultney, VT. At this point in history this Mason farmer had not distinquish ed himself in anything especially except his fervor in Masonry. This Mason was William Miller. He was aided by the Masonic deists in his ar ea to broaden his knowle dge. The Episcopalian deist Matthew Lyon had a large pe rsonal library and had shared it with William Miller. Miller read all the great Masonic thinke rs of the time, Voltaire, Hume, Paine, Ethan Alle n, and others. Up to now however, most schol ars because they are unfamilia r with the strong secular millenialism within those non-Christian masonic wr iters, have tended to view Miller's Millenial views as his own creation. It is hard to accept that Willi am Miller did not dr aw from others. One of the best Millenial scholars, Michael Barkun aptly writes, \"Although to all appearen ces theologically self-taught, the congruence between his Biblical interpretations and older read ings of millenarian symbols strongly implies access to an oral if not a wr itten exegetical tradition.\" This Author concurs. Before meeting with Lafayette, Miller had married Lucy Smith. Then he claimed to have become a Christian in 1816, and to have discovered the date of the return of Christ from independent study in 1818."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"So the Grand Master met with hi m. And Miller, like Lafayette, would within a few years be travelling around the country vis iting many Masonic Lodges. Miller claimed to have lectured 4,000 times from June 9, 1834 and 1845. His biogra pher, Sylvester Bliss, mentions more than 230 communities that Miller spoke to. Up until 1839, these were confined to New York and Vermont. Miller's meeting with Jo shua Vaughan Himes changed that. William Miller joined the Masonic Lodge in 1803. At that point he was well known for his rejection of Christ as Savior and his Deism. Later, he joined the Baptist church. According to Miller, he set out to harmonize the contradictions of the Bibl e himself. It's interesting that when Miller was finished harmonizing his religious views, those views were described as \"a type that would pass with the world philosophical, pure, and sublime.\" Two important ministers early on for William Miller also had Masonic connections, Elder Fuller of Poultney, VT. and Joshua Himes. Elder Fuller had influe nced William Miller during the \"silent years\" before M iller's ministry and was one of the first to join his movement. William Miller's best friend, Truman Hendryx, was a Ba ptist minister of possible Jewish heritage. In 1833, a group of Baptist ministers from Wh ite-Hall where Miller ha d met Lafayette, and from Hampton, NY gave Miller, a layman, a license to preach. For a layman to receive such a license was unusual, especially si nce it was clear at that time that William Miller was preaching the return of Christ and that the Millenial Age was soon-to-come in 1843. Soon afterwards, another strange and unique document was put together by 17 clergymen from various denominations authoring Miller to preach. As thes e denominations often back then had heated squabbles over doctrine, it was very unique that such a variety of denominations would give Miller such a document to authorize him to preach. It smells of Masonic influence. The Masons at the time were powerful within the clergy. According to the scholar Whitney R. Cross, \"About a fourth of all Protestant ministers were Masons,\" in that re gion of the U.S. The Masonic lodge recruited men of influence: politicians, merc hants, and clergy men. Cross adds, \"though their congregations were not, and like a ny group of private individuals interlocked against competition on economic, political, or social levels, they [the Masons] subverted the democratic process.\" Also interesting is an analysis of the 1850 censu s. It reveals the following statistics about the Adventist movement and their leaders. 20 percen t were farmers, 6 percen t were merchants, 13 percent were craftmen, and 45 percent were mini sters. The Adventist movement drew from all types, but consisted ma inly of Methodists, and of small- town New Yorkers with New English heritage. The rapid rise in Second Adventis t thought implies that its leaders went to other sources. It is also interesting to examine what type of men became Adventist leaders, such as men with Jewish backgrounds, with Yale a nd Andover educations, and men prominent in the Abolitionist movement. The Abolitionist move ment, although it drew its mo ral indignation from what was happening to the slaves, it drew much of its finances and lead ership from Secret Societies who apparently were bent on revolution. William Miller's prophecies failed and made a laughing stock of those who would talk about Christ's return. While attention was focused in the U.S. and the U.K. on the fulfillment of the Mason William Miller's prophecy about Christ's return a new relig ion very similar to Fr eemasonry believed that Miller's prophecy was fulfilled in the Middle East. This masonic like universal belief held that a man Baha'-u'llah was th e manifestation of God, the Chri st. They believed he created the foundation of the Kingdom of God on earth, and th at the day would soon come when the Golden"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Age would be ushered in. The f oundations for a New World Order we re passed to his son, who began to implement Baha'u'llah' s Tablets and Instructions. So began the Bahai religion. Bahai writer Jessyca Russell Ga ver wrotes, \"Among these proph ecies was the belief that sometime between the years 1843 and 1847, His Ho liness, Jesus Christ, would reappear on earth.\" \"Should you search through the scri ptures of any divinely reveal ed religion, you will find that God has never sent His messengers to a place having no need of them-be it a town, a city, or a country that is fairly content, progressive, or sp iritually aware....Instead, such messengers seem to arise where they are needed most...This was the condition in the ancient country of Persia (now called Iran) about 200 years ago.\" 4 While Miller's failed prophecies brought scorn on the Bible in the U.S. and Europe, in the Middle East they were being used to bolster a new universal religion cal led the Bahai faith. The Mason Kheiralla who first began teaching the Bahai faith in th e 19th century had some Millerites as his early pupils. He taught them that the Mason William Miller's prophecies about Christ's return had been fulfilled in the Bab. The Bab's Declaration in 184 4 began the Baha'i' Era according to his followers. Numerology is part of this religion. The numbers 9 and 19 are revered. They have a heirarchy called the Baha'i' Administrative Order which is headed by the Guardian of the Faith. Their goal is to unite ma nkind into one religion. They hold informal mee tings called \"firesides.\" The Bahai faith has recei ved help from the United Nations and the symp athy of Masons. It established its Internati onal Headquarter in Palestine just prior to W.W. I at what is now Haifa, Israel. The British government was very positive toward the Guardi an of the Faith Abdu'l-Baha and knighted him in 1920. When he came to California he s poke in Oakland at the YMCA. Jewish, Christian, and Mo slem leaders attended hi s funeral. Troops of Mo slem and Christian Boy Scouts also paraded at his funeral. The new Guardian of Faith Shoghi Effendi Rabba ni received land earmarked by the Jews for institutions of the Jewish State on which he built at Mazra'ih a Holy Place. He also built at Mt. Carmel a world center. Bahais would use Prince Albert Hall, London for meetings. That Hall has seen a lot of use by the Mas ons and the early International Bible Students. A series of 7 years plans which were parts of several stages to bring in a New Order were put into motion. These plans were part of what was called the Divine Plan. A Universal House of Justice was established a nd its pronouncements are put forth as divine. According to Bahai teachings the cradle of th e New World Order is to be America. They believe the troubles the world is suffering and will go through are the \"birth pangs\" of the New World Order. A new race of spiritual beings is to come under their tutelege. They do not believe in the concept of sin. Although they build temples and other religious buildings they claim not to be a church. In the book The Dynami c New Religion Bahai Faith it states , \"Someone who is attracted to the Baha'i' Faith finds that he is on the threshol d of a new spiritual experience. He learns that God loves those who work in groups and that His ch ief purpose in this age is to create unity. To do his part in building a New World Order, each person has to develop new qualities of character, which the Baha'is feel their teachings demonstrate.\" 5 In contrast to Jesus who was concerned about sin and spoke, \"B lessed are the poor in spirit,\" the Baha'is' believe having poverty of the spirit is the worst situation. 6 They like other New Age groups, they believe man is going through evolutionary stages."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"The Baha'i Way of Life is clearly in acc ord with Masonry whic h believes that by following their path a man will will receive salvation. The Masons, Universalist-Unitarian Church, Mormons and Baha'is p ractice essentially the same universal religion with different labels, and different rituals. Today the Baha'is are forbidden to join the Masonic Lodge or any Christian denomination. They don't need to join the lodge, considering they are commited to much of the same thing. In terestingly, it was Masons and the Chicago Masonic Temple that got the Baha'i religion going in the United States. The man who began propogating the Baha'i religion in t he U.S. Kheiralla was a Freemason. By 1900, he had his \"medical\" offi ce in the Chicago Masonic Temple. The secret Masonic Oriental Order of the Magi produced the core of the pupils who took Kheiralla's Baha'i lessons. The Order of the M agi had mostly men but also women which were mainly physicians and their relatives. Dr . Rufus Bartlett, Dr. Eugene W. Sawyer, Dr. Chester Ira Thacher, and Louisa (\"Lua\") Au rora Moore were all ear ly Baha'is that belonged to the Order of the Magi. A comparison of the names of a number of the prominent early Baha'is in Chic ago including those of the Or der of the Magi with this Author's list of Chicago's Oriental Consist ory (Scottish Rite) membership fails to produce any dual memberships. It is not clear to this Author just what the relationship of the Oriental Order of the Magi to the Oriental Consistory (Scottish Rite) is. Baha'i Dr. Chester I. Thacher also had his business office within the Chicago Masonic Temple, and is believed to have probably been a Ma son. It is also believed th at the Order of the Magi rented a room within the Chicago Masonic Temple. 6a Baha'is are not only committed to a One- World-Religion but also a One-World- Government. Their leader is called the \"Heral d of the New Age.\" They work hand-in- hand with many other agen cies working to bring in a Ne w World Order, and those that are helpful to the cause such as NOW, NAACP, Kiwannis, and others. AN OVERTLY SATANIC LODGE SYSTEM & THE GOLDEN AGE One lodge system that is overtly satani c is The Golden Dawn. In their publication Watch Jerusalem in 1948 they tell reader s that Armageddon is to happen during the 1990s. 7 In another publication, they tell us \"The Aquarian Age is alrea dy upon us and it, too, is radiating a most powerful influence. The Aquarian Age will be in full power all through the coming Millennium. In fact, ri ght now it is preparing the way for the Millennium, the THOUSAND YEARS OF PEACE.\" 8 MASONIC VIEWS In Mystic Americanism bille d as \"a book for every Ma son and for every man and woman who is looking for the fulfillment of pr ophesies\", it teaches that the defeat of the Dragon will reopen the teaching of the Holy Grail which is illumination of the Sou'. A New Dispensation is coming. Supposedly, the cycle of Jesus of Nazareth is over, and we must discard that old cycle for the new one we are in.

THE STREAM OF SECULAR MILLENIAL HOPES The stream of secular Millenial hopes such as Fabian Socialism, Communism, et. al. have been part of the revoluti onary forces unleased by lllumi nism. This Author has been requested to diagram how all th ese groups and people relate , however, to do so would be a meaningless jumble of interconnecting li nes. It is most appropriate to understand these groups and people as moving parts of a stream unleased by and fed by the llluminati and Illumined groups. Two stream illustrations are provided, one giving some of the groups the other prominent people. What does this have to do with Christianity and the On e-World-Religion? Socialism (aka Communism) with its secu lar Millenial Hope was the real religion of the leaders of the National Council of Churches of Chris t. In the U.S. over 100 NCC leaders had affiliations with communist-front organizations including a nu mber of prominant ones who were Communist party members. 10 The NCC secular Millenial hope is illustrated in a policy statement issued by th e NCC's General Board in 1965: \"We have pushed our machines with th eir mechanical minds and vast powers outward into space among the stars and inward into the secrets of matter and men, and into the fields, the factories, the mines an d the market place. A world without hunger, nakedness or human beas ts of burden is now a real po ssibility, no longer a visionary dream.\" 11 THE MAN-MADE MILLENIUM OF LIBERATION THEOLOGY Perhaps nothing more vividly illustrate s how the New World Order can use religion to manipulate people to fight for their ow n enslavement as liberation theology. Liberation Theology (or more accurately Liberation Myth ology) holds that men will establish a new Jerusalem. Liberation Theol ogy strategies for accomplishing the New Earth vary from teacher to te acher, but can be basically su mmarized by saying that the principles of the Bava rian llluminati and Karl Marx are to be put into practice through revolution (liberation struggles) to cr eate the New Earth, the Kingdom of God. WHO BEGAN LIBERATION THEOLOGY Liberation Theology was started by various mi nisters who were Marxists, socialists and One-Worlders. The roots of the movement be gan with the men who preached the social gospel, such as socialist cler gyman Dr. Walter Rauschenbusch, a crucial influence on the Federal Council of Churches. It began first with the Protesta nts and then spread to the Catholics, especi ally the Jesuits."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"In 1959, Ernst Bloch a Marxist posing as a Christian published Principles of Hope (Prinzip Hoffnung) trying to mix Marxism and C hristianity. In 1965, t he German Protestant Jurgen Moltmann published what is commonly called the foundation of Liberation Theology A Theology of Hope. During the 1960s and th e 1970s the World Council of Churches began to support revolutionary struggles. In July, 1968, at the Uppsala, Sweden Assembly the WCC made a commitment to help create a One-World-Gov ernment. They decided to fund third world \"liberation movements\". From there on, the WCC has increasingly pledged itself to Liberation Theology. Examples of how Liberation Theology ha s functioned. The WCC gave $157,820 to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War between 1966 and 1970. They gave the revolutionary group SWAPO $740,000 an d the communist ANC received $362,000. 12 Christians who belong to denominations within the WCC (such as the Episcopal, Presbyterian, United Methodist, et. al.) mu st bear responsibility for the bloodshed caused by WCC funding various terrorist groups, be cause their churches contribute large sums to the WCC. A new phase of Liberation T heology took place when \"Basic Christian Communities\" BCC were set up in Nicaragua and helped bring in the Marxist revolution. The BCCs began spreading t hroughout Latin America. In 1971 a national meeting in Santiago, Chile took place of Christians for Socialism. The next year, an international meeting in Latin America took place with over 400 Protestant and Catholic Latin American liberationist from all over South America gathered. In 1981, John Paul II replaced the Master Ge neral of the Jesuits wi th his own choice because Arrupe had not controlle d Liberation Theology. This move was a superficial political gesture on the part of the Pope. A rrupe was already incapacitated by illness, and the change in leadership did nothing tangibl e to slow down the Jesuits' promotion of Liberation Theology. It simply blew a smokescreen on the Pope's intentions. In 1987, Latin American Communist Partie s met in Prague to discuss with other communist experts how the Churches could be effectively used to promote Marxism worldwide. WHAT DO LIBERATION THEOLOGIANS BELIEVE and PREACH? \"It is time to...concentrate on the fundamental fact: the Bible teaches communism...Communism is obl igatory for Christians....T he Ananias episode...means: pain of death for whoever betrays communism, Christianity's indispensible condition.\"— Jose Miranda, leading Mexican LT spok esperson, Communism in the Bible. \"I am convinced that my attitude represents th e highest form of responding to the call from God. For me, Christianity is communi st militancy.\"—Father Santiago Salas, Filipino Guerrilla Priest \"The solution is Marxism. It is the only possi ble way to achieve liberation. I do not see any other way to realize the promises of histor y and of the Gospel, there is no salvation outside the Church, and there is no liberation outside of Marxism. A Christian should embrace Marxism if he wants to be with God and with men."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"\"Liberation theology is an entirely new theolog y which reinterprets, in the light of the revolution, all the themes of traditional theolog y: God, Christ, the Ch urch, the priesthood, marriage, labor, everything. \"The mission of the church thes e days in Latin America is, above everything else, to preach communism... Communism is profoundly Christian. Communism, according to Marx, is a society in which there is no selfish ness or injustice. It is the same as what Christians understand as the kingdom of God on earth.\"—Father Ernesto Cardenal, Communidades Eclesiais de Base. The biggest barrier to the satanic llluminati dreams of World conquest are the teachings of Christ. This challenge to the New World Order is being subverted by teaching the people that Christ was a Communist revolution ary. Isn't it amazing that men can be so easily fooled to work and fight for the ens lavement of the human race? The New World Orders manipulation of people by their promises of a man-made Golden Age, a Millenium, needs to be challenged.

Her brand of religion was very popular among Jews a nd Freemasons as this chapter will bring out. The sequence of events that le d to her quest for the Metaphys ical laws that govern healing started with an accident, a fall on i ce one stormy cold Feb. day in 1866. Prior to falling, Mary Baker Eddy, a childless sad frail 60 year old woman, had been \"just sitting around waiting to die.\" 1 Although her fall was an acc ident, that she turned to the occu lt wasn't. Some maintain that her mentor was one of the founders of New Thought Phineas P. Quimby. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby was a possible Freem ason. He was also an early hypnotist who attempted to heal by hypnotism. There has been much debate on how much he influenced her. Mrs. Eddy stayed in Portland, Ma ine as a patient of Phineas Quim by, and it was at that time she borrowed his writings which she used as hers. 2 Quimby had gotten his ideas in turn from the Mason Anton Mesmer. When the Mason Mesmer ga ve a performance in Belfast, Maine of the power of Mesmerism (also called animal ma gnetism and now called hypnotism), Phineas Quimby became interested and learned Mesmer's technique of hypotism. 3 Both the Mason Lafayette and the Mason Mozart were impr essed and promoted Anton Mesmer to their friends. 4 Quimby felt religion was making many of his patients sick. 5 Mary Baker Eddy picked up on that idea too. One observor summed up the resear ch into Mrs. Eddy borrowing Quimby's writings, \"If it had not been for P. P. Quimbey ther e would have been no Mrs. Eddy a nd if it had not been for Mrs. Eddy we should never ha ve known of Quimby.\" 6 Two people that did without doubt have great in fluence on her were her father and her much beloved husband who died. Her fath er was very interested into Metaphysical religion, and her husband was a Freemason and an Oddfellow. As an Oddfellow he got into Witchcraft. The Freemasons took care of her as a widow, and after that kindness sh e was very close to them her entire life. She had material published in the Freemason's Monthly Magazine. 7 From the very beginnings, she took the Mas onic Knights Templar logo and used it on her publications. She altered it slightly and it has b ecome a copyrighted trademark of the Christian Scientists. An early form of the Knights Templar logo used by her appeared on her book Unity of  Good  and  it  appears  below."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Mary Baker Eddy explained he r fall and her healing in her classic book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. Four year s later after this tes timony was published, she managed to round up 26 others a nd organize a church in Boston. This church was later designated as the Mo ther Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist. It was \"designed to commemorate the word and works of our Master, which should re- instate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing.\" Here again is the Masonic c oncept of revolving (revolution) back to a primitive purity. Her concepts also were Gnosti c. They held that salvation could come only through knowledge and that sickness, sin, and dise ase would disappear in proportion to one's understanding that God is All. She believed in anothe r Gnostic tenet, that matter was opposed by God. Her positive thinking is called New Thought. Ne w Thought ranges from outright Hi nduism to the more subtly occultic beliefs of positive thinking by the Freem ason Norman Vincent Peale. However, Peale's New Thought is not new. Emerson was one of the men that made New Thought famous. Emerson was closely associated with Freemas onry, and borrowed and studied Hinduism. Mary Baker Eddy and Emerson believed every man is a center of \"God-consci ousness\", and is to recognize his complete unity with the whole. Christ is a divine idea, not eternal, but me rely a \"reflection of God.\" Further Christian Science tells us that man is divine, because he is part of God. The official organ of the Scottish Rite, the New Age Magazine in May, 1923 contained an article of the highest praise for Mary Baker Eddy. In line with Masonic duplicity and secrecy, the article doesn't contain her name, but it is obvi ous from the article's description who is being honored. It said, \"But it remained for the latter years of the 19th century to witness what many believe to be one of the greatest 'Declarations of Independence' of all history, and which promises to result in the final breaking down of the bars to truth and the rending of the chains of man's greatest enslavement—his supine submission to material laws. \"One evening at the close of an autumn da y in the year 1866, a spiritually-minded New England gentlewoman (she was th e wife of a true Mason) sat in a lonely rock-ribbed crypt on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, near a little v illage in Massachusetts... she had fitted herself for the great part she was destined to play in the drama of world events. She was inspired by the same God that directed the enlightened thoughts of Abraham, Isaac, Jac ob, Moses... In such a moment of at-one-ment with infinite intelligen ce, this woman wrote wh at many deep thinkers are coming to regard as the gr eatest \"Declaration of Independence\" ever revealed to the inhabitants of this planet. \"Our children's children and all future gene rations will speak and write of this present twentieth century period as \"The Days of the Great Revolution,\"—the last Religious Rennaissance—the time of the signing (the adop tion) of Man's Declaration of Spiritual"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"Independence and his freedom from the (so-called) laws of matte r. And those children of our children, in looking over the record, will be proud of the Masonic recognition of, connection with, and active contributions to, this great event.\" 8 With such a close affiliation in doctrine and friendships with Freemasons, it is no surprise that Freemasons have played a big role in Ch ristian Science. Channi ng was one of the men responsible for the founding of Christ ian Science, and was a Freemason. 9 Since that time, if one examines the Mother Church in Boston we fi nd that Archibald McLellan (1857-1917) who was a leading Freemason was director of the Mother Church and editor -in-chief of the Christian Science Monitor. 10 Albert F. Gilmore, president of the Mother Church in 1922-23 was a Freemason, 11 and his successor Charles E. Heitman, pr esident of the mother church from 1923- 24 was a Freemason. 12 Since 1956, the first reader and a chur ch official at the Mother Church has been the Mason Arnold H. Exo. 13 The Mother Church at Bost on exerts authority over its 2,500 international daughter congregations. Many of the editors of the Christian Science Monitor have been Freemasons. For instance, George Channing, Paul S. Deland 32 degree, Alex ander Dodds, Roland R. Harrison, and Charles E. Heitman. 14 Opponents of Mary Baker Eddy's \"primitive Christianity\" have called it \"Yankee witchcraft.\" When one is familiar with Chris tian Science auto-suggesti on and compares it with magic, the two are same in principle. Mary Baker Eddy, born at Bow, New Hampshire in 1821 started her church in Boston in 1883. Again one sees the origin of a Christian New Agy cult started within the same geographic area that so many ha ve originated from. Mary Baker Eddy found she coul d be a channel, a medium. After she found her talents as a medium, she began the Ma ssachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston in 1881. Two years later she began the Christian Sc ience Journal which has evolve d into the Christian Science Monitor, a respected journal. In ancient times, the Sybils were controlled in a hypnotic way. Is it possi ble that Phineas Quimby or someone else controlled her by hypnotism? A Mrs. Stetson, a decendant from the Puritan family 15 that would be tied to the Order which is thought to be part of the Illuminati 16 , was a friend of Mary Baker Eddy. Stetson was another early Christian Science leader. Augusta Stetson was also into co-masonry. And her life is shrouded in mystery. 17 Another connection with the Illumi nati is that both Mary Baker Eddy and the Order have drawn deep ly from Hegel's philosophy. Indeed, the history of the 20th century has been a century when the Illuminati has tried out Hegel's ph ilosophy to create their desired changes by conflic t. Mary Baker Eddy earl y on in her original wr iting plagerized Francis Leber, who had written \"The Me taphysical Religion of Hegel.\" Mary Baker Eddy was part of the Baker family by birth. The same prominant Baker family of today. Many of the early converts to Christian Science were the we althy and/or Jewish people. Because Christian Science st resses mind power many Jews were attracted to it. 18 So many Jews belong to the Christian Scientists that one person who deals with Jews lists Christian Science as a Jewish group. 19 The New Thought by the 1880's was a collect ion of philosophy from such men as Confucious, Emerson, Buddha, and others.

Three world wars would be created. 1 The first would set up an illuminati controlled go vernment in Russia. The second world war would allow them to conquer Europe from th eir secure base in Russia. The third world war would be an imitation of the Biblical Armaggeddon. These wars were to occur during the 20th century.

In the 19th century, both the Scottish Rite and the world's Jews had their own secret intelligence networks. 2 During the 19th century, the machinery was put into place and tested. 3 In the 20th century, this machinery suceeded. Only the fi nishing touches are being put into place, before the unveiling of the One-World New-Order. 4 Because the center of power is in Great Britian, a great decep tion has taken place. Great Britian has \"given up\" her empire, has seemingly lost her power. The Masons in Great Britian try harder not to be seen associated with revolution, and not to be associated publicly with the occult. T he British MI5 and MI6 operate under far greater secrecy than the American CIA. The power in Great Britian that issues directives has been kept very secret.

BUILT COMMUNIST RUSSIA During the Russian Revolution, while Trotsky was publicly making anti-American speeches, the U.S. and Britian 6 were secretly aiding the new Russian government. U.S. troops were obstensively sent to protect the Trans-siberian railroad from the Bolsheviks, but the actual reason was to insure that the Japanese didn't enter Siberia, until the Communists took over. 7 When these American troops left Vladistock, Russia, the Communists gave them a thankyou farewell. 8 American equipment and military trainers were secretly sent to help the Communist army in 1919. 9 President Wilson quietly sent Elihu Root (Kuhn, Loeb lawyer) to Russia with $20 million out of a spec ial war fund. This transaction was revealed in Congressional hear ings on Russian Bonds, HJ 8714.U5. Also this amount was recorded into the congressional record on Sept. 2, 1919. The New Age Magazine (official organ of the Sc ottish Rite) throws some light on this in an article \"Freemasonry in Russia\". \"During the 19th century Masonry was rega rded in Russia as a nest of atheistic revolutionaries and those workin g for the overthrow of Christi anity and lawful government. At the end of the 19th century a group of Russian Masons went to France and there joined Lodges, some under the jurisdiction of the Grand Orient of France and some under the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, such as Kosmos and Mount Sinai. On their return to Russia they founded two provincial Lodges, the Polar Star in Petrograd and Regeneration in Moscow, ...By 1909, six Lodges had been established. \"At this point, Mackey (one of Masonry's leading Authorities) states, there was a pause in their activity due to police restrict ions. These Lodges were were reopened in 1911 and worked under the Grand Orient of France with virtually no ritual and with avowedly political aims in view; namely, the over throw of autocracy. In 1913 and 1914 this organization had forty Lodges. A split occurred about 1916, an d ten Lodges were said to have gone out of existence. The revolution of March, 1917, and the establishment of the provisional government were inspired by and operated from these Lodges.\" 10 There you have it from t he horses mouth—THE MASONS CAUSED THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION. However, this information will no t be put into its full context for you by the Masons, for if the full context is seen, we realize that Jewish Masons, who were controlled and financed by International Bankers interested in a New-World-Order, caused the Russian Revolution. They will not tell you that Marx and Le nin whose heads have ado rned many a socialist postor around the world were both Jewish Freemasons. 11 They will not tell you, that the America n Scottish Rite was in full cooperation and communication with the Grand Orient Lodges. 12 They will not tell you that almost a ll of the revolutionaries were Jewish. 13 "},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"They will not tell you the part that the Rothshilds play ed, through their American proxies to provide the Russian Revolution financial ai d to prop it up.

Morgan & Co. sent the new comm unist government several millions of dollars of Red Cross money. 17 After the revolution, the Masons and Jews seem to drop out of the picture. 18 Since their obvious involvement in starting and directing the Russian Revolution can only be partially hidden historically, it wa s imperative for them that they seem to drop out of the picture. 19 A few show case trials against Jews and Masons and a few showcase mob attacks with world-wide publicity and the worl d has been convinced now that Russia is anti-Jewish and anti-Mason. 20 It is important to allow the read er to realize this deceptive front. Otherwise, it will not make sense when the reader l earns about American Christian Masons who are on important co uncils working on a socialis t agenda. Because after the Russian Revolution, the Masonic Lodge tried to place themselves at the forefront of the crusade to save America from communism. Act ually, what they were doing is helping to promote a conflict, that they had been helpi ng construct for years . The Rockefellers, and the Harrimans can be seen donating time and money to both si des of the conflict. 21 BACKGROUND 22 In 1920, the Bolsheviks began taking over the Russian oil fields. The Caucasus oil fields had slowed down, because the oil fi elds were not managed and water percolated into the wells. The Baku oil fields had required 50,000 feet of drilling per month to keep up production, but under the Soviets the av erage drilling per month in 1921 was 370 ft. 23 Rotary drills would be needed as part of the solution to get the oil fields producing, but the Soviets didn't have any. 24 Pravda announced in its S ept. 21, 1922 issue that an American company International Barnsdall would provide the technology and management to get Russia's oil field back in to production. A frame, on the U.S. Dept. Decimal File, records that Americans went in to the oil fields to superintend the work. 25 Who was the chairman of International B arnsdall? A 32 degree Mason named Matthew C. Brush. In July 12, 1925, an agreement was reache d between W.A. Harriman Co. of New York and the U.S.S.R. for exploitation of the Chiaturi manganese deposits. 26 The Harriman operating company was named Georgian Ma nganese Company. And the man running it was 32 degree Freemason Matthew C. Brush (also a KT & Shriner). In 1924, Harriman (S & B Order) gave a loan to the Soviets. This was against U.S. law at the time, and the Dept. of State at that time had jurisdiction to inve stigate. But it didn't even after the loan's existe nce had quietly slipped throu gh the Power's censorship and appeared in the London newspapers.

Morgan was trying to give a little nu dge to the activities of the Masons, who through the Unitarian and Universalist churches had been trying to create an ecumenical movement. 29 The Unitarian church has had strong Masonic (and to a lesser degree Skull and Bones Order) leadership and money. It was a radi cal departure from orthodox Christianity, deriving its religious philosoph y from the German Idealism of the Mason Ka nt, of Hegel, and English Romanticism. It was transcendental and pant heistic. Transcendentalism helped create the abolition movement, so cialism, and eventually the social gospel. Their idea was to recreate the sucess of the Masonic Lodge on a much greater scale. Benevolence was the key. The sucess of Maso nry to bring divergent religious elements together and to calm the Chri stian scruples was through Be nevolence. It was seen as a tried and tested method to mold the Christ ian elements into a One-World-Religion. Masons, Socialists, and Unitarians (who were possibly also Masons) were quietly placed into the leadership of the Ch ristian ecumenical councils wher e they proceeded to slowlv and skillfully redefine the Chri stian gospel. The Christian go spel came to be defined as a social gospel based on t he goodness of man without me ntion of Christ's act of atonement and mankind's sin. While thinking they were rediscovering a lost Christian teaching—benevolence, the major denominati ons were slowly be ing recreated into Masonic institutions. Institutions that enga ged in benevolence, believed in Magic, and were tolerant of everything. The Federal Council of Christ, the World Co uncil of Churches, and the National Council of Churches have given relig ious sanctum to their program s by carefully couching their programs with veiled language that sounds Chri stian to the naive. Th ey have used every trick in the book. Transcendentalism working on the New England mind resulted in the Presbyterian split between the Old and Ne w Schools in 1837. A great retreat from Calvinism toward Arminian theology took place in all deno minations, especially in New England's Congregationalism. Instead of talking about Go d's election of man, the Christians began emphasing only man's election of God. In discussing the origins of t he F.C.C.C., C. Gregg Singer states, \"Involving :he denial of man's total depravity, the departure from Calvinism brough t with it an optimistic view of human nature. This optimism promoted not only the belief that man must and can cooperate with God in the achievement of hi s eternal redemption, but also its corollary that man in the same manner can achieve a millenial existe nce on earth. This fondness for millennialism brought with it an addiction to re form, which swept the nation in the three decades before 1860. Arminians, Unitarians, and devotee s of the cults joined hands in the quest for Utopia under th e banners of millennialism.\" 30 The Christians were now ad opting two ideas of Masonry—the revolution back to a Golden Age found in Eastern Mythology and the idea of us ing benevolence to hide their lack of interest in faith in the personal God of the Bible. Prior to the Confederate State's of Amer ica's defeat, the Unitarians and their International Banker friends had several plans for the South. (See chap. 2.4) The defeat of the South opened up several opportunities. The congre ssional Plan of Reconstruction of the South was to be precurser of what they intended later for the whole U.S. 31 Masons in the South with connections to the big Ba nkers advised Southern ors that they needed the big Financiers and their technology. 32 The International Bankers bought up land in"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"the South from destitute Southerners. 33 Religious reformers and experimentors went to work. 34 In much of this they seem to have failed. 35 The contested elec tion of 1876 broke the strength of the radicals, and they abandoned the conservative backward South to try their experiments and c rusades in the North. 36 The Masonic elements found a new tool to br eak conservative Christianity, Darwinism. Although Darwin was not a Mason, his grandfat her who was influential in his life and his close friends were. 37 And it was Masons that initially promoted the idea of Darwinism. At last here was a \"scientific\" justification to support the Hindu belief in evolution. Some transcendentalists, who had looked to Ea stern religious thoug ht, had already adopted evolution, before Darwin. But it had been a mystical notion, now evolution had the blessings of the scientific community. Darwin 's ideas weren't issued forth into a vacuum like a microbe suspended in outer space, but rather into a culture medium full of nutrients to promote it. Darwinism multiplied like bacteria. Devote Christians responded by retreating to dogmatism in the Bible, rather than scientific investigation. They might have realized God gave them a brain for a reason. There is nothing wrong in using science to testify to the validity of the scriptures. Christians seem to rationalize their lazy ment al attitudes and willingness to scientifically investigate by saying that this would be showing a lack of fa ith in the Scriptures. On the contrary, it shows one believes the facts will vindicate script ures. It took the Christian community, years to catch up to the Evolut ion Theory. And they st ill haven't taken the initiative away from the Evolutionists (due to the unequalities of the playing field.) Now, science has itself discarded what Darwin pos tulated, and the modern evolutionary theory is nothing like its predesesor. Further, Cr eation Scientists can now out-debate the Evolutionists with hard data. 38 Men like Stephen Hawkings have shaken the scientific community. 39 The evolutionists are saved now by the Power which controls the vast media, and the public's lack of critical thinking. Union Seminary in New York which was controlled by th e Order produced a Dr. Charles A. Briggs who stated very clearly that the Christian adherence to elaborate creeds such as the Westminster Confession and the Lutheran Augsburg Conf ession were sinful because they seperated Christians. 40 Advocates of the social gospel and theological liberals followed up Briggs suggestions. An examination of early Christian ecumeni cal groups of an evan gelical nature shows the hand of Masonry quietly at work. The Young Men's Christian Association (1851) 41 has been basically a Masonic run operation. Early attempts at unity for social reform, such as the Women's Christian Tem perance Union (1874) and the Anti-Saloon League(1893) had leadership that was connected to vari ous tenticles of the World Power. 42 According to Elias B. Sanford, who was the honorary Sec. of the FCCC from its beginning, these types of preliminary grou ps were used as a ba se. Sanford describes in his book Origin and History of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America the five steps they initiated to work these va rious preliminary unity groups into the FCCC. These were: 1. A series of conferences looking to the fo rmation of local and state federations. A great deal of effort was spent to give the impression that this work was the resu lt of local and popular pressure for a new type of ecclessiastical cooperation. 2. A conference which met in Philadelphia early in 1901 for the purpose of creating a FCCC."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"3. A second annual conference wh ich met in Washington, D.C. which took the fourth step which was to create a comm ittee on correspondence. 4. This committee with Dr. Sanford as its Secretary travelled exte nsively all over the nation to seminaries and local federa tions drumming up support for step 5. 5. The Inter-Church Conference on Federation in New York in late 1905. This conference proposed the formation of a federal council to meet in 1908. The gr oundwork to create a constitution called the Plan of Federation was also laid. Their 5 step plan was a well th ought out, systematic formula. When the Federal Council of Churches was o fficially launched the criteria for a group to be accepted was merely that it receive a two-thirds vote of acceptance. There were no creedal stipulations. The seeds to destr oy the evangelical Christianity of its constituency had been planted from the start. Methodist Episcopal Bishop E.R. Hendrix (who this author has reason to suspect was a Mason) was made the FCCC's first president. A Committee on the Church and Modern Industry came up slyly with what became known as the Social Creed for the FCCC. It wasn't until much later that the churches disc overed that the Social Creed (with 9 articles) was originally written for the Method ist Federation fo r Social Service. 43 Without realizing it, the 33 denominations that had joined we re being quietly led do wn the Social gospel path, a path of salvation based on socialisti c optimism in the nature of man. A salvation not from sin, but from sin's effects. Becaus e the surface problems were played with, the root problems continued unabated. In the early years, the FCCC spoke loud rhetoric in fa vor of pacifism, but when war broke out, it urged its deno minations to fight a holy war to end all wars. 44 The Mennonite General Conference (the only Anabaptist grou p involved with the FCCC) withdrew in 1917 over this hypocracy. In the early years, the FCCC made statement s that the new social order was the hope of humanity. They called this new social order what Christ called the King dom of God. \"We conceive it to be the duty of the Church to point out wh erein human life, as it is presently organized, falls far sh ort of this ideal and fails to apply these principles and what changes need to be made.\" 45 The Southern Presbyterian chur ch protested the FCCC's theology in the early years. It wasn't interested in building a soci alist Utopia. But it didn't leave. How close were the original FCCC leaders to the One-Wo rld-Power? Even from the beginning of the FCCC in 1908, some of the FCCC leaders were talking about the creation of a League of Nations. Understand that the League of Na tions was one of the reasons why the Power wanted W.W. I. That these men we re promoting the idea of a League of Nations long before W.W. I ought to raise eyebrows . They threw their ecclesiastic support behind Wilson's proposal for a League of Nations. The failure of the United States Congress to allow the U.S. to join the League shows that even the Power can miscalculate. It seems that every step of the way, the FCCC was the erand boy for the Power bringing us their socialistic New World Order. Some denominational leaders in order to quiet opposition from their conservative members claimed that they were having a moderating effect on the FCCC. However, there is no evidence to show that the FCCC leaders paid any seri ous attention to its critics. Why should it? It had a secret agen da and secret backers that could produce"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"serious support. Bear in mind, there were ev en FCCCer's writing books like Christian Principles Essential to a New Worl d Order by W.H.P. Faunce in 1919. Evangelicals were setting aside their beliefs in conversion and regeneration, for the Social program of the FCCC. In return, th e FCCC gave them rhetoric, like this Federal Council Bulletin \"Within the Federal Council there is full freedom for those who are now joined in common tasks to hold varying views as to the ultimate form in which the spirit of Christian unity may express itself. Some there are whose eyes are fixed upon the coming of a complete organic union in which the many groups while preserving their own distinct methods of worship and work and their ow n special emphasis and point of view shall be organized in a single comprehensive church. Others simp ly want friendly co operation. Both groups can meet in hearty acc ord in the Federal Council.\" 46 COMMENTS My comments on this are as follows. For Christians ther e is but one freedom, the freedom to do what is right. There is no freedom in being unequally yoked with those who don't want to do what is right. Today, good m en are afraid to be good. Many Christians today are afraid to stand up for what is right. Toleration has been drummed into their heads. But what is tolerated is sin. People today do not real ize that the people who are preaching liberation and freedom, are the ones who enslave m en to drugs, bad habits, hatreds, and other evils. The socialist New Order that the FCCC l eaders talked about wasn't \"full freedom.\" When men don't want to confront the issue of sin, and the FCCC didn't, then in the long run they will settle for slavery to sin. FCCC'S THEOLOGICAL ORIGINS Singer states, \"There can be no dou bt that the theology of the Council was liberal, with Unitarianism and higher criticism its chief ch aracteristics. Its leadership was hostile to evangelical Christianity...\" 47 Chapter 2.3 presented how Unitarianism was essentially a Masonic religion with ties to the Order (One possibl e llluminati Power group.) FCCC LEADERSHIP Who was this leadership which was hostile to evangelical Christianity? Consider some of the following— (these Masonic memberships are from reliable sources such as the Masonic reference 10.000 Famous Freemasons): S. Parkes Cadman- Freemason, served as the President of the FCCC, and also, though he was a socialist and unevangelical, was put on the FCCC's radio broadcast as their evangelistic program duri ng the early years. Dr. Earnest H. Cherrington-Freemason, se rved as Vice Pres. of the FCCC Henry St. George Tucker-Freemas on, Pres. of the FCCC during the 40s. He emphasied in the Federal Council Bulletins that \"Doubt is cast on the sincerity of Christians\" because of the racial problems of America. Did he ever preach any thing about the sincerity of the Masonic Lodge being in question due to their racism? Never to my knowledge. The racial issue and the civil rights movement that the FCCC started was a nother front for the FCCC to distract and manipulate Christians with. Because of the i ssue the FCCC built a legal staff for the first time."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Bishop G.

Roosevelt needed supp ort to push his New Deal (New Order) legislation through to move this nation away from our traditional freedom toward their socialist New Order, guess who was there to give him full support? The FCCC radically promoted the New Deal legislation of Roosevelt. 48 Although technically the FCCC didn't speak for all the denominations that were joi ned to it, it pretended to , while simultaneously denying to its constituency that it was actually doing what it did. At this time, people began to be concerned that the FCCC was working for the communists. There were very few people aware then that this whole thing was much greater. The FCCC advocated \"collectism\" and \"economi c reconstruction,\" duri ng the 1930s, in items like their 1937 report on The Church and the Social Order. Subsequently, the FCCC published in their Bi ennial Report, 1943, p. 18 such verbage, \" The chief contribution of the Church, especially of the clergy and all who have a teaching function within the Church, is to keep alive the vision in men's minds of the true order of life as God int ended it to be, an order in which the whole process of production has as it primary purpose the meeting of human needs instead of having the meeting of those needs the by -product of the pursuit of prof it..an order in which the resources of the earth, land and water are controlled for the ben efit of the total community with whatever forms of ownershi p in each case are conducive to such control...\" (Bold added) John Foster Dulles, a active participant of the New World Order, 48a briefed the FCCC on the United Nations charter after the 1945 San Francisco Conf. 49 and the FCCC adopted a resolution in support of it. \"The churc hes of Christ in America have long held that the nations can better serve God's purpos e for the world as they are brought into organic relationship with one another for the commonwealth.\" 50 (THEY HAVE?) They soon gave their total support for UNESCO as an indispensable step. The prime movers in the creation and leadership of UNESCO were Masons. The constitution of UNESCO was written by S&B Order member Achibald Ma cLeisch. UNESCO immediately went into action to promote Hinduism and the New Age throughout the World. 51 It also became another conduit for instructions to religious leaders throughout the w orld from a secret Masonic Council of 13. 52 The list of non-governmental organizations that were in a consultive and associated relationship to UNESCO (Report of the Director-General, 1991 for the time period 1988-1989) shows the follo wing organizations both associated with and advising UNESCO, the International Council of B'nai B'rith, Ecumenical Institute for the Development of People, In ternational Association for Religious Freedom, Catholic International Education Office , International Young Christian Workers and a host of other Jewish, Catholic, and Hindu organizations."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"But the FCCC wasn't big and powerful enough to carry out the function the Power had for it. Even in 1933 comments in the C hristian Century had been made, \"The Federal Council has exhausted its present commiss ion. New conditions require that it be recommissioned with a new chart er...to be set free from inertia...\" 53 In 1942, they began to create the NCC. On Nov. 29, 1950 the National Council of Churches was created. Notice the name of Christ was dropped in the change from the FCCC. Again one notes men like William C. Martin (32 Freemas on) was made Pres. of the National Council of Churches, and Hugh I. Evans (33 )- U.S. rep. World Council of Churches. 32 degree Freemason J. Edgar Hoover also watc hed over the FCCC for the Power. He had his FBI agents within the Federal Counc il of Churches of Christ leadership. 54 When it is mentioned that FBI agents are infiltrated into the FCCC, the reader should remember that the FBI agency has been filled with Masons like Ass. Dir. of FBI Hugh H. Clegg and Ass. Dir. of FBI Clyde A. Tolson. When examining the CIA, Intelligence Agencie s, The World Council of Churches, the Federal Council of Churches of Christ (later transformed into the National Council of Churches) the detective is not going to understand the evidence until he grasps that these agencies were designed ultimately with the obj ective to bring in a New World Order. Were this book on the entire New World Order Conspiracy not just the religious side, a seperate chapter would be required for the intelligence agencies. I have chosen to include them in with this chapter on the Councils which they have infiltrated. Ex-CIA agents Marchetti and Marks disill usioned with the corruption and immoral activities of the CIA have stated in their book that the CIA (\"the company\") \"penetrates and manipulates private institutions, an d creates its own organizations (called \"proprietaries\") when neccessary. 55 One of the best kept secrets of intelligence agencies is their infiltration of religious organizations. Agee, another disillusioned CI A agent, who was with the company for twelve years, says that the CIA was an evil force and that it serv es the interests of rich and powerful men, rather than countries. 56 However, there are hints of their penetration, if the re searcher looks closely. Two examples will be given. JOHN FOSTER DULLES & THE WCC In the mid 1930s, the Soviets and British were working to encour age Hitler to become aggressive. The British were promoting the be lief that they would not declare war on Hitler. 57 On Jan. 4, 1933, at Cologne in the home of Baron Kurt von Schroder Adolf Hitler and the Dulles brothers met. The Dulles brothers, A lien and John Foster Dulles were sent over as legal representat ives of Kuhn, Loeb Co. 58 Kuhn, Loeb Co. had given large short term credits to Germ any and wanted a guarantee of repaymen t. They also wanted to assure Hitler that they would guarantee him the funds neccessary to install him as Chancellor of Germany. 59 Later Allen would become head of the Europ ean branch of American Intellig ence (OSS) and his brother John Foster would become Secretary of the Federal Churches of Christ. John Foster"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"would serve on various FCCC activities, in cluding being the Chairman of the Commission on a Just and Durable Peace. The FCCC Commission on a Just and Durable Peace basically adopted a statement that claimed the Christian churches wanted certain things to be done in the Post-World War II world. By coincidence, their program matched what the New Order and the United Nations was planni ng to do at the time. By coincidence, Masons in the leadership of the Church of England praised th e Commission on a Just and Durable Peace. Also by coincidence, Ca tholic and Jewish clergy came together and gave their blessing to the Commission's work too. In 1942, John Foster Dulles apparently adopted pl ans to use Catholic and Protestant churches and the World Council of Churches for the OSS (which was the forerunner of the CIA) for his own purposes. The OSS analyst who presented him wi th plans for such an operation, impressed him and was s ent to the Berne, Switz. team. 60 Controlling and infiltrating the World Counc il of Churches could not have been very difficult considering the high ratio of hi gh ranking Freemasons on that make up the World Council when it meets. For instan ce from the U.S. the United States has sent Jesse M. Bador( Mason, General Secretary and Presiden t in 1930), Perry E. Gresham (delegate 1949-52, KT & 32 ). Australia sent as the president of t he Austrailian Council to the World Council of Churches t he Freemason George C. Barber. It's interesting to note that after the de cision was made to use the World Council of Churches by American Intelligence, G. Bromley Oxram, 32 degree & KT, (33 in 1949), was given the position of President of the Am erican Fed. Council of Churches of Christ (served 1944-46) as a stepping stone to becoming the first American president of the World Council of Churches. He remained the p resident of the World Council of Churches from 1948 to 1954. MASONS ARE CHRISTENDOM'S RE PRESENTATIVES TO THE WORLD Had the reader imagined that the Chri stian Churches of the World have been represented and headed by a 33 degree Freemason? Also in 1948 at the World Council of Churches in Holland the U.S. was re presented by 33 Mason Hugh I. Evans. The American delegate in 1949 was 32 & KT Ma son Perry E. Gresham. He was also a delegate to the World Council of Churc hes conventions in 1950,51, and 52, and participated in the founding assembly in 1949. SMOKESCREENS As the reader has seen by now throughout this book, th e Masons would like one supra-Church, what some Masons refer to as \"T HE religion.\" Baptist Mason Rev. Newton could say in one breath that Masonry is not a religion, and in the next Masonry is the religion. But to openly tell announce to Christians w hose denominations participate in WCC, that the WCC is the first step toward a Supra-C hurch (the One-World-Religion) would just create opposition, and fric tion to their plans. They are w illing to quietly take their time, because there is a master plan, and things are continueing. Consequently, over the years t he public has been repeatedly given a real snow job. WCC leaders have repeatedly told the public they are not want ing WCC to develop into a Super-Church, but their actions and words at other moments belie that."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"For instance, the words of Dr. Franklin Clar k Fry, Chairman of t he influential Central Committee of the WCC said, \"The World Co uncil not only disavow ed becoming a \"super- church\" at its beginning at Amsterdam; its total development since then has been the most convincing refutation of the whole notio n. We who are closest to the Council are constantly baffled how any such charge can be made or any such misconception can still exist, except in critics who are deliberately self-deceived.\" 61 He says they are BAFFLED by such charges.(?) But in the forward of that report when published we read, \"In any case the story of a Council of Churches, however great its achievements, can never be a success story unt il the moment when it ceases to exist as a Council, because of the emergence in reality of the Una Sancta.\" 62 When one realizes that Una Sancta is Latin fo r ONE HOLY CHURCH it is the people who listen to him who are baffled. Even the official WCC publication Jesus Chri st, Light of the World reveals their real desire. \"The churches have created the World Counc il of Churches. They have created it so that one day they might dispense with it. The World Council of Churches lives to die. If churches ever become content wi th it or concerned solely to perpetuate it, then they will be disobedient to the heavenly vision.\" 63 THE OSS (fore-runner of the CIA) REBUILDS EUROPE'S MASONRY During W.W. II, the Axis countries had ravaged the Masonic Lodges. In Germany, Masons had been arrested. After the war, the Masonic Lodges were lavishly financed with OSS funds in Italy, and in Germany. 64 According to the F reemason Roberts there are many Freemasons within the CIA. 65 THE CIA MAIL OPENING OPER ATION IN BIG U.S. CITIES From 1953 to 1973, the CIA ran a letter opening operation that in 1972 examined 2,300,000 items of mail out of the 4,350,000 items that went through the New York Post Office. Of those 2 million plus letters it de cided to open 8,700. Similar letter opening operations were run in San Francisco, Hawaii and New Orleans for shorter periods. 66 The CIA's Operation CHAOS compiled 7,200 files on Americans, and the CIA's Directorate of Operations has indexed and filed records on 115,000 Americans. Detailed files were kept on 57,000 Americans. 67 The American Taxpayer in 1974 was estimate d to be paying 5 Billions of dollars for espionage, and for th e year 1967 it was officially ad mitted that the CI A alone cost 1.5 Billion dollars. 68 We asked them for this, and we have al lowed them to do what they want. As an ex-CIA agent said, \"It does whatever is req uired to achieve its goals, without any consideration of the ethics involved or the moral consequences of its actions.\" The intelligence agencies have no accountability except to God Almighty, and of any group they perhaps feel more at ease with using any means. Anything that works has become their method. They are a cult that is a powerful tool in the hands of the Conspiracy, because the public and courts want their operati ons kept secret. The public would not stand for a real invest igation, because they are so intimidated that national security demands secrecy and practically a hands off policy."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"THE ANGLO-AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE CULT The British, the Americans, Canada, Au strailia, and New Zeal and Intelligence agencies are secretly working together. Jeffrey T. Richelson and Desmond Ball in their well researched book The Ties That Bind examine that cooperation in detail. The cooperation began early on, was very close in W.W. II, and was reaffirmed in the UKUSA Agreement in 1947. 69 All personnel now cleared by the British sign at statement declaring security to \"other co-operating Governments.\" The Americans and British have been the dom inant powers in the world for the last two hundred years. Even without knowing about the secret agreement to cooperate, most people would expect that the Americ an and British are working together. \"...the most important intelligence relation ship Britain had was with the United States which I knew, from extremely reliabl e sources, collected m ore than 85 percent of western intelligence material.\" 70 If the U.S. Intelligence services collect so much, why are the British Services shrouded in so much more secrecy? The obvious answers is confirmed by sensit ive confidential leaks, the British are closer to the power which plans to rule the world. There have been murmuring all along among the intelligence agencies about the power of British intelligence. Congressman Leon Gavin (Congressional Record, May 22 , 1945, p. A2434) c harged that American Secret Intelligence in the Fa r East was \"dominated and di rected\" by a British agent. A female American agent said, \"We had been warned in Delhi that the British were past masters at intrigue and had planted spies in all Americ an agencies to piece together information.\" 71 Why? The obvious answer is the British are still trying to control world events. It doesn't take a sleuth to realize that. Having been with British U.N. workers overseas and other British working in thir d world countries, this Aut hor can assure th e reader the attitudes that went with having the larges t empire in the worl d haven't abandoned the British. And they are now only more subtle. The American intelligence cults are awesome in their own right. Experts write, \"The United States had created an awesome data- collection organization that could sweep up virtually every single transmission within its reach, from ordinary te lephone conversations to super-secret enciphered transmissions . Among those who k new, no one yet fully grasped the implications of that capacity.\" 72 The implications can't be gr asped. Who wants to believe that secret intelligence agencies working for a 1-world-government are controlling various religious organizations? We thought these people were protecting us. We find it hard to digest that they are not on our side. It is so frightening it makes us si ck to the stomach to realize that they are being used to bring in a 1-world-government. With su ch secret power, access to the power of their govern ments, and so much money these intelligence cults have little opposition. 1. Kirban, Satan's Angels Exposed, p. 61. cf.

We say this person is a Germ an Jew, this person is a Russian Jew, or this person here is a Spanish Jew. We say \"german\" Jew be cause they are a Jew first, and their country of origin is le ss significant. (This does not im ply all Jews feel this way in the least). Rarely does one say a Jewish German, or a Jewish Spaniard. Every Jew in the world automatically holds a dual natio nality. Every Jew can get an Israeli passport and is a citizen of Israel automaticaly, no matter where he lives in the world. The Jews Alpari and Samuely were in charge of the Red Terror that carried out the torturing and executing of t he bourgeoisie, the peasants, and the counter-revolutionists in Russia. The Jew Moses Uritsky was the first head of CHEKA. And the long-feared and imfamous Lavrenti Beria, well kn own just by his last name Beria, was a Jew and protege of the Jewish Kaganowitsch family. Beria ran the NKVD (Soviet Secret Police). The reader will recall that the Jew Lazar Kaganovich and the Jew Litv inov were next to Stalin the two most influential men in Russia during the 1930s.

The Mormon Church which is headquartered in Sa lt Lake City is named the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The Corporation of the President of the Church of J.C. of LDS is set up to hold the property and copyr ights, etc. of the hierarchy. However, an extensive set of corporations, dummy corporations, etc. also ex ist to manage a far-rangi ng financial empire under the exclusive control of the head of the Mormon church. The head of the Mormon Church is called Presi dent. He and two other top leaders of the Mormon Church are called the First Presidency. \"The First Presidency ha s authority over all matters pertaining to the Church.\" 1 \"The next in order are the Twelve Apostles...Th ey hold the same authority in all parts of the world that the First Presidency doe s at home...The twelve have a president...This presidency is obtained by senority of age and ordination.\" 2 These fifteen men are followed by \"the seventie s\". The \"seventies\" ar e groups of men whose groups also have a Presidentcy of seven men ove r their group, and these intermediate Presidents interface with the twelve apostles. 3 The structure looks like this in descending order: 1. The First Presidency (which consists of 1 President + 2 counselors) 2. The Quorum of the Twelve (w hich consists of apostles) 3. The Presidency of the Sevent y (called members of the Pre sidency of the Seventy. 4. The First Quorum of the Seventy (members co me from the different church districts) 5. The Second Quorum of the Sevent y (members also come from the different church districts) WHAT ARE THE TWO MORMON PRIESTHO ODS & THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE HIERARCHY There are two priesthoods the Aar onic and Melchizedek and their relationship to the hierarchy is described by Preside nt Joseph F. Smith, \"Ascending the scale of authority, the titles and callings of deacon, teacher, priest and bishop come within the purview of the Aaronic Priesthood; while those of elder, seventy, high priest, patriarch, apostle and president are offices and callings in the Melchizedek Priesthood, to which the Aaronic Priesthood is an appendage . A full equipment is thus shown for the government and conduct of the Church both spiritually and temporally.\" 4 Like the Watchtower Society the LDS church pow er structure is set up to govern its members totally in both spiritual and temporal affairs. WHAT THE MORMON FIR ST PRESIDENTS ARE Various ex-Mormon Masons indicate that all of the Presidents, also called Prophets, of the LDS church have been Freemasons. Because this has come from several reliable sources, none of which can be named, it stands the test of being accurate. This is why 33 degree Mason Norman Vincent Peale has always been good friends with the Mormon prophets. At the 85th birthday of current Mormon Prophet/President Spencer W."},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Kimball (who is as mentioned also a Mason) Peale was the keynote speaker.

Confidential sources al so reveal that couriers have been used to carry commands directly to the LDS leadership from the center of power in England. Some of these cour ier routes are through UNESCO and INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. Again because this came from different sources that were not in touch with each other, it must be   considered   reliable.   THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MASONRY & MORMONISM Blanchard, 33 degree Mason in his book approve d by the highest Masonic authorities, states that Mormonism and Masonry are legally the same institution. \"The two institutions are morally and legally the same.\" 5 Mervin B. Hogan, who is one of the best Masoni c writers, when he was selected to be a Blue Friar in 1976, presented his paper \"Morm onism and Freemasonry: The Illinois Episode.\" In discussing the Articles of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he said, \"It is evident to anyone who acquaints himself with this creed that there are no conflicts or incompatibilities whatsoever between the teachings, theology, and dogma of Mormonism and the philosophy, principles and tenets of univers al Freemasonry...Surely with that simultaneous background, it must be readily acknowledged that Mormonism a nd Freemasonry are so intimately and inextricably interwoven a nd interrelated that the two can never be disassociated.\" 6 A Mason within the Lodge can say what H ogan spoke and be comme nded, yet a non-Mason saying the similar things about the Mormon Church to a Baptist church watched Mason Baptists get up from the pews disgusted and leave in the middle of his talk. 7 To quote only two Masons of the many who have noted the connections between Masonry and Mormonism: \"The general outline of the en dowment ceremony, and the signs used therein, are closely connected with Masonry; and, in spite of Mormon de nials, it is easily established that a certain amount of the early Masonry which was used fr eely in the Temple ceremony still survives.\"— Mason Stuart Martin, The Mystery of Mormonism. p.308. \"Not infrequently the question is asked, 'Does the Mormon church make use of the Masonic ritual in its Temple ceremonies?'...the reader will be left free to make his own deductions.\"— Past Grand Master S. H. Goodwin. (Goodwin th en proceeds to mention many similarities between Masonr y and Mormonism in his book Mormonism and Masonry.) THE OBSERVABLE PHENOMENA Because individuals that reveal information about the instructions that the Mormon leadership are taking from the New World Order are in the gravest danger, it is more sensible to discuss the observable phenomena. These phenomena are more or less public record, what must remain secret testimony shall. WHO IS ORCHESTRATING THE MO RMON CHURCH ACTIVITIES? The answer is not as hidden as one might assume. The following are all observable phenomena, that did not take any cloak and dagger activity to lear n. William Schnoebelen's books describe the connection be tween witchcraft and the Mo rmons. Talks with New Agers"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"reveals that they view the Mormons as co-worke rs in the work to enlighten the world with a \"higher consciousness\". Clearly th ere appears to be some kind of an arrangement of cooperation. Again confidential sources i ndicate that the Mormon Temple s are used by non-Mormons for witchcraft ceremonies. Such cooperation can only come from the authority of the First Presidency. After writing the above paragraph early in 1991 from confidential sources about Satanism within the Mormon temples, a confirmation has come out in the form of a memo written by Glenn L. Pace, Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric of the LDS church. The memo is authentic, and the Mormon committee it refers to called \"Strengthening Church Members Committee\" did exist. The memo was only for use for the select inside the Mormon church, but the Utah Lighthouse Ministry got a copy and published it in thei r newsletter Salt Lake City Messenger (Nov. 1991). Basically, wh at Mormon General Authority Gl enn Pace is warning about is that there is a Satanic conspiracy operati ng within the Mormon church. Pace interviewed 60 Mormons who had been abused in Satanic rituals. These 60 were all Morm ons, the Satanists that had abused them in Satanic ritu als were all Mormons, and the a buse had taken place in various places including Mormon churches, the Temples, and even while one was serving as a Mormon missionary. The Satanic abuse had occured in the following places: Utah (37), Idaho(3), California (4), Mexico (2), other places (14), wh ich indicates Satanism wi thin Mormonism is very widespread. The perpetrators of the Satanic abuse came from such positions in the Mormon church as Young Women leaders, Young Men leaders, bishops, a pa triarch, a stake president, temple workers, and members of the Tabernacle Choir. My sour ces indicate that Glenn Pace's memo is not reaching high enough. That Satanism goes clear to the top. If so then Pace's memo may have been leaked as damage control. Pace's memo is well written. Un fortunately the Tanners who reprinted it are quite reluctant to admit that a Satanic conspiracy could exist, and have repeatedly shown they are either ignorant of how Satanism is operating or are trying to do damage control for th e Mormon church. Some people who are trying to expose the extent that Satanism controls Mormonism feel the Tanners are trying to help the Mormon church. Within recent years several outstanding events ha ve given the public knowledge that Satanism is widespread within Mormonism, but somehow the lid continues to prevent it becoming public knowledge. In the Salt Lake Tr ibune, Jan. 13, 1988 was an ar ticle about a Mormon who had ritually abused his children and had been convict ed. The case was in Pr ovo, and the Tribune had run an article on Dec. 16, 1987 discussing the testim ony of a therapist who allege that within one ward as many as 40 people had been ritually abused. The Jan. 13th issue had quoted a spokesperson for the Utah Psychiat ric Association who said that mental-health professionals had identified several communities in Utah where groups were abusing children. Other cases of child abuse by Mormons continue to occur. This author has personally known one perpetrator in Kansas a nd one in Oregon. From personal knowledge of the Mormon church it can be honestly stated there is little protecti on within the Mormon church against Satanism, and members who leaned that way that the Author has met, were never to his knowledge rebuked by the church or other members. Pace's comments in the memo correctly stated th at what he reports in his memo \"are very minor infractions\" compared to what the occult is doing in the Wasatch Utah area. He also correctly notes that the perpetrators are livi ng dual lives, and many of them have temple recommends. Living dual lives is but stan dard operating procedure for Satanists."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"THE BIGGER PICTURE Only through a good grasp of the bigger picture does this cooperation b ecome more visible. Chap. 3.3 discusses the role of the Rothschilds, who helped fi nance the Mormon church. Chapter 1.7 describes the B'nai B'rith, and its role as a cover for the Powe r's operations. The B'nai B'rith operates both as an intelligence front and as a conduit transmitting orders to various groups including the Mormon Church and the Masons. A visible result of this close cooperation can be seen in the following information con cerning Utah's first \"gentile\" Governor. LDS POLITICAL CONTROL Many observers have noticed the political that the LDS Mormon Church has and exercises in Utah's politics. \"Of course, in Utah, political ambition and religio us ambition were always closely allied. It was difficult to rise to prominent public office w ithout the Church's backing. It was virtually impossible to do so against the Church's opposition. That was a fact of life in Utah that any good politician understood...\" 8 Even in modern times, even very recently, reports by non-Mormons, called \"Gentiles\" by the Mormons, continue to tell how much oppressive opposition, pressure, and control the Mormon Church and the Mormon people are exerting on thei r lives and on their churches in Utah. The oppressiveness has caus ed some to move. The U.S. Congress went on record repeatedly c ondeming the Mormon Church control of Utah's politics. They declared they n eeded evidence of the seperation of church and state in Utah. Congress dragged their feet in giving Utah statehood. After statehood the complaints by \"gentiles\" in Ut ah continued. And so a charade, an act of deception was foistered on the American people, and most people rela xed, confident that Congress had taken care of the problem. How this was done will be discussed. The Mormon Church after state hood continued to deny allegations of Church interference in the least in State matters. \"The Church does not claim any such right...We disclaim the right to control the political action of the members.\" 9 However, assemblies in LDS chur ches to discuss and advance th e cause of a certain political party continued unrebuked by th e Church's higher authorities. 10 \"Gentiles\" did get placed in some of the State' s positions, and this was \"proof\" to the outside world that the Mormon church had no influence on State politics. However, the outside world did not have the pe rspective on things that this book gives. The outside world if they noticed a man like Jame s William Cherry sitting on the Supreme Court of Utah would not likely see any connection between this 32 degr ee Freemason and his Unitarian Church which is involved with the Ne w Age movement and the Mormon Church. 11 Is it surprising that we find so many of the \"gentiles\" in Utah, carrying out policies that the Mormon Church wants? Joseph L. Rawlins, was portrayed by the Morm on Church as a Gentile, and to its church members as an apostate. This \"a postate\" is rather suspicious. No tice, that back when Polygamy was an issue between the American people a nd Congress and the Mormon Church that this apostate stood on the floor in Congress and denied that there was \"one sylla ble of evidence\" that Utah had practiced polygamy. 12 In 1966, the LDS Church was still having to issue statements denying influence in Utah politics, yet even to this day th e firm conviction remains with ma ny \"Gentiles\" who live in Utah that this type of denial is not true. They notice the rumors that circulate through the LDS"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Churches about which candidate th e Church is in favor of. It is understandable how such rumors could be circulated with or without the Church 's responsibility, so the LDS Church can not be blamed unless there are actually people who are able to state that the orig ins of some of these voting rumors are known by them to st art with someone in the hierarchy. In early Utah, at a time when political tension was high betw een Gentiles and Mormons in Utah, the election of the first \"G entile\" Utah state governor helped to diffuse the tension. His name was Simon Bamburger. Looking beyond the surface, it is noteworthy that none other than the most prolific Mormon writer who defended the Mormon religion, B.H. Roberts, nomi nated Simon Bamburger at the state Democratic convention. 13 Simon Bamburger was a great man for the Morm on Church. He diffused tension, detracted attention form the Church's power, and dispelle d the bad publicity of the image of LDS control in Utah. He also carried out a program in publ ic office that was extremely pro-Mormon. He could get away with a pro-Mormon attitude because he wasn't Mo rmon. Gov. Bamburger opposed anything that opposed the Mormon Chur ch, whether it was anti-Mormon information or anti-Mormon legislation. Simon Bamburger wa s a Freemason, and he was also a high ranking member of B'nai B'rith. 14 He was Jewish and had rece ntly immigrated from Germany. THE PRIEURE DE SION & MORMONISM According to the geneologies put out by the Mo rmon leadership, who happe n to be all related, they are descendents of the Merovingian Dynast y. The Merovingian Dynasty is supposedly the House of David and the blood line throug h which the new Christ is to come. Merovee was the first Merovingian king. His s on's Clovis I was the second Merovingian king. The tomb of Clovis I contained hundreds of sma ll minature solid gold bees. The bee was the Merovingian symbol. The Merovingian bloodline went into the Hapsburgs. When Napoleon married the Hapsburg Marie Louise they had so wn onto their coronation robes the Merovingian gold bees. The bee is the state symbol of Utah, and a widely used Morm on symbol, such as with their Deseret Industries. The Mormon Church leadership ties in very ti ghtly with the New Worl d Order and may very well play a significant leadership role. THE CIA, FBI CONNECTIONS The CIA and FBI have many ties to the Mormon Church. This is well known in Utah, because these agencies do so much r ecruiting in Utah. The CIA and FBI also besides having many Mormon agents, have a high percent of Masons within their ranks. For instance, the participation of the Robert R. Mullen Co., which is the company which handles the Mormon church's interna tional public relations, is a CIA front. 15 According to testimony before Congress, some of the planning for the Watergat e burglary took place in Mullen Co.'s offices, and members of its staff knew ahead of time of the breakin. 16 The book Mormon Spies, Hughes And the CIA i nvestigates the close connections and collaborations between the LDS Church and the CIA. 17 History is full of examples of LDS spying activities. The Tanner's book Unmasking A Mormon Spy The Story of Stan Fields provides an example."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"The Mormon Church is very similar to the Masoni c Lodge in the way it exercises its authority. The Mormon Church gives its members plenty of latitude for freedom of belief, while exercising strong dictatorial authority over its people. An ex ample of this is that while Mormons have the freedom to visit New Age churches, which this Author has witnessed first hand, and while Mormons work for New Age religious groups, the Mormon Church hierarchy maintains a Big Brother vigilence over their own. One source stated that plans ha d been made to tap and listen to all the Missionary phones within the Portland area. Whether the plans have actually been implemented or not, it shows the mentality of cont rol and power within the hierarchy. It is not by accident then, that Mormons have th e freedom to attend New Age seminars. 18 THE MORMONS & THE CH URCH OF SCIENTOLOGY For a while, this Author shared an apartment with a Mormon fri end. He was much older than this Author, in the neighborhood of 42. He wa s in good standing with the LDS Church. It was only natural then, when he became unempl oyed for him to go to the Mormon church's employment service. There, employment specialists , seek to match their clients skills with their job contacts. Many of their job contacts are from LDS members. After visiting the Mormon employment service, this man went to the Chur ch of Scientology, and after an interview was hired onto Hubbard's Church of Scientology staff. This Author was surprised that an LDS me mber in good standing would work for the headquarters of a New Age cult. Mormon friends of this man found nothing alarming in the least that he worked for the Church of Scientology. Is the Church of Scientology a religion? Acco rding to their own literature (which at some times says no) they are. To quote one of their pieces of literature, \"Is Scientology a religion? Yes! Scientology is a religion in the truest sense of the word...The church of Scientology's purpose is to help the individual lead a happier life, and so there is nothing in Scientology principles to conflict with ot her religious beliefs.\" \"The C hurch of Scientology is non- denominational. One can be a Scientologist and also a member of any religious group. There are Catholics, Protestants, members of the Jewish fa ith and most any other religion who are also active Scientologists.\" 19 The Church of Scientology kept asking him to volunteer vast amounts of time, and he was lucky to get peanuts in compensation for his hard work, so after several months he quit. He quit because of the lack of pay, not because of religious scruples. THE MORMONS & THE UNIFICATION CHURCH W. Cleon Skousen, an ex-FBI agen t and former Salt Lake City Ch ief of Police, is in charge of the Freeman Institute of the Mormon Church. 20 The name Freeman Ins titute even echoes the name given past Masonic magazines and newspa pers. The Freeman Institute was established ostensibly to rescue the U.S. Constitution. Inte restingly, close examination of Mormon doctrine, reveals the Church plans to supplant the U.S. Constitution with their own in the long run. 201 Somewhat akin to the fox guarding the chic ken house. Anyway, under the guise of fighting communism the Mormons and Moonies have been working together. Things are coming together now and such type of covers will not long be needed. For those who are familiar with Rev . Moon's claim to be Jesus Christ, 21 and the Moonies' belief that they will install their man as the world' s future ruler, it seems that the Mormons and Moonies are strange bedfellows. How can the Mo rmons and Moonies work together when they"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"both claim the same thing for their own respec tive group? Shouldn't the Moony threat to take over the world be as serious as a Communist takeover to the Mormons? When the Unification Church wa s taken to court by the IRS, the Mormon Church along with the ACLU, the Unitarian-Universalist Church, th e National Churches of Christ, the American Baptists, the African Methodist Epis. Church, and the Freeman Institute supported the Unification Church's position. The Mormon church only gave am ici curiae support, in contrast to the some of these groups which participated even more. 22 W. Cleon Skousen has worked in close cooperation with Rev . Moon's CAUSA organization, and he and other members of the Freeman Ins titute would participate in CAUSA conferences. The Moonies' CAUSA organizati on has declared, \"We affirm th at the the God of Judaism, Catholism, Protestantism, the Mormons, the Unifica tion Church and the God of all religions are one and the same.\" 23 (emphasis added) After all the self-proclaimed Christ Sun Myung Moon's pretensions to fight Communism, Moon went to Moscow and declared that Russia was to \"play a major role in the plan of God to construct a world of peace.\" 24 Panda, a business which is headed by Moon's closest associates and chief lieutenant, is investin g $1 billion in a major automobile plant in Red China to produce cars (the Chinese version of th e Chevrolet Chevette) that will be sold to the United States. 25 Moon advocates the Internationa list's line for Global Free Trade. Rev. Moon, who like Joseph Smith, claims to have been visited by angels and Jesus and given the mission to \"restore\" Christian ity. This restoration is to start in the United States and then eventually spread world-wide. And similar al so to the Mormon Church is the emphasis on authority and money. Rev. Moon's church is a good example of how a s ynthetic religion can be created from scratch, using state of the art mind control, and other re ligious manipulations. Members are locked into fund-raising and are programmed to fear outsiders. They are told their children are sinless. Rev. Moon and his wife claim to be the first perfect sinless people. \"After World War II, the Rockefellers had secr etly acquired substantia l holdings in Japan and wanted to see them develop.\" 26 Chase Manhattan (the Rockefeller's bank) was named the lead banker to the South Korean government and acquired Moon's bus iness. The U.S. military governme nt installed the chiefs of South Korean according to Chase Manhattan's advisors. In Oct. 1962 the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) an extention of the CIA sent their KCIA chief Kim to meet with his U.S. counterparts. He met CIA director Jone McCo ne and Lt. Gen. Carroll, head of the Defence Intelligence Agency. Along with Kim was Moon. The most important meeting Kim and Moon had on that trip was with Nelson and David Ro ckefeller. Both Moon and Nelson hit it off well immediately because both wanted to see a One-Wo rld-Government. The Japanese sector of the Rockefeller empire began to covertly finance Moon. The purpose of Rev. Moon's religious anti- communist crusade was to neutra lize the patriotic conservative forces opposing the Rockefellers' dream of a New World Order. A lawyer who worked for the Ro ckefellers and who confidentia lly talked said, \"David and Nelson Rockefeller were fanatical globalists, and so is Moon. Hi s Unification Church aims to bring Christianity under the same internationalis t rule the Rockefellers planned to clamp on the world's nations. Moreover, to re ach this goal, the Chase Manhatta n crowd had to penetrate and neutralize the patriotic forces of the so-called Republican right wing. If you look closely, that's just what Moon has accomplished.\""},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"Sun Myung Moon's Washington Times, the only ne wspaper Ronald Reagon said he read daily, makes light of The Spotlight's interest in th e Bilderberger. Moon's paper would like people to believe that their meetings are simply w eekend picnics for businessmen and diplomats. 27 Moon promotes globalism within his church by fi xing the marriages for all his adherents, and these marriages often mix differe nt nationalities and cultures togeth er. This is further enhanced by sending different nationalities to other lands to work and the communal living situations that the Moonies live in. W. Cleon Skousen's anti-communist crusade a nd his book against communism is a joke. He gives the readers of his book no historical persp ective of what has really happened. He gives no hint that Communism and Mormonism were both started by Masons. He gives no hint that the Mormon Church practiced Communism before the Communists. When the Mormon Church's communism failed, the church moved into capitalis m. This shift happened toward the end of the 19th century. The Mormon Apostle Canon said in reference to Mo rmonism, \"One of the most promising modern experiments in communis m has been frustrated and brought to ruin.\" 28 Kuhn, Loeb & Co. which financed the Mormon church in 1898, 29 is also known to have financed the Bolshevik Revolution with $20 milli on dollars. (In 1918 and 1922, the Reds repaid in gold, 600 million rubles in gold was tr ansferred from Russia to Kuhn, Loeb, and Co.) 30 Brigham Young described the Mormon leaderships real attitude toward democracy. He said, \"Every government lays the foundation of its own downfall when it permits what are called democratic elections.\" 31 The Mormon Church went into capita lism like Socialist Russia is doing today—not out a change in doctrine, but b ecause communism failed to work. Individual Mormons still believe that in the future communism will work under the Mormons. 32 When the New Jerusalem is established it will be under \"T he Law of Consecration\" or as the Mormon scholar on Prophecy Crowther puts it, \"...this [N ew Jerusalem] will be carried out under the communal living system known in the Church as the United Order or the Law of Consecration.\" 33 Russian Communism has been consistently port rayed as an enemy by the Mormons and Masons since the 1920s. This pattern of creating two opp osing forces such as the Anti-Communists (the FBI, Mormons, Church of Scie ntology, and Scottish Rite) and the Communists (leftist Labor Unions, Socialists, Russians, Ch inese), has been the masterful outworking of the One-World- Power's belief in Hegelian Philos ophy. By controlling both side s, the One-World-Power expects to control the outcome, and to be able to direct people's hate and energy as it wills. See note 30 for further study on how Masons a nd Communists use Hegelian philosophy. THE MORMON CHURCH & THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT Aren't the New Age Movement's beliefs diff erent than Mormon belie fs? Yes and No. An examination of the listings in the National New Age Yellow Pages shows what the New Age movement entails. It includes the following: Healing, Astrology, Health foods , Channeling, crystals and gems tones, dreams and revelations, divining, Hinduism and polytheistic beliefs, magi c and the occult, and Godhead for aspirants. Mormonism contains all these elements. The same type of path to godhead that the New Age packages and sells is prom ised by the Mormon Church. This helps explain the repeat ed little connections one sees between New Agers and Mormons. Some examples are:"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"1. A New Agy type Mormon Fireside wher e Networking Techniques were taught. 34 While \"networking\" itself is a legitimate concept, it is also possible to trace some Networking ideas back to New Age sources. 2. William J. Schnoebelen in his book Mormonism's Temple of Doom re ports how he was a Druidic witch. His witchcraft ment or was head of all the Druidic witches in North America. This head Druidic witch told him that the highest form of witchcraft practiced in North America was practiced in the Mormon temple ceremonies. Sc hnoebelen joined the LDS church to receive a deeper occult experience. 35 WITCHCRAFT NOT A RECENT INNOVATION FOR MORMONS A number of people have been seriously bent out of shape by Schnoebele n's mild exposes of witchcraft and Mormonism. It seems people want to ignore the obvious. What? How is it so obvious that witchcraft is within Mormonism? An examination of Mormonism from the start re veals that it has always been heavy into Magic. Five of Peter Whitmer, Sr.'s sons and his son- in-law Hiram Page (named after Hiram Abiff) became the witnesses to the Book of Mormon. Their family were Perm. Dutch from Lancaster Co., Pa. and lived near the Rosicrucians and the Ephrata Co mmune with its occultism. Obviously some of it rubbed off, because th e Whitmer family was into Magic. The original three witnesses to the Book of Mormon were all involved in magic prior to Smith's revelation.(This inform ation comes from Mormon sources.) 36 Of the next 8 witnesses, five ar e known to have been into Magic. It appears that \"at least two- thirds of Mormonism's first 12 Apostles may have had some affinity to magic.\" 37 Most of Mormonism's early converts were not only connected with magic but religious seekers who were frustrated with the standard denominations. Up to 1837 34.4 percent of Mormon converts were people who had not been affiliated with organized religion. 38 With the death of Orson Pratt in 1881, the Q uorum of 12 Apostles no longer had any of the original Mormon apostles who public ly endorsed magic practices, a nd a dramatic public shift in attitudes toward public magic occu rred. Magic continued but only in the shadows. As has been documented by Schnoebelen, the Mormon temple ceremonies are wh ite magic. It wa sn't until this Author learned that one can pr actice magic without knowing it, and when I learned what Magic is, that it became quite clear that the Temple ceremonies are magic. Where magic, such as seer stone divination, was widespread among early Mormonism, such practices became rare in the twentieth century . Mormon scholar Quinn mentions an LDS mission president in the 1940's who still practiced magi c. Astrology, which had been popular among 19th century Mormons, fell into disuse. 39 Contrast this with the early LDS Deseret News, edited by the second counselor in the LDS First Presidency, which carried an astrological table in its first issue. The use of Astrology among the Mormons goes b ack to the Order or Fraternity (called by outsiders the Fraternity of Rodmen). Mormon Willia m W. Phelps, whose family is linked to the Fraternity, published an almanac in 1863 which refers to the LDS use of astrology and the to prophecies. \"The moon's days in the signs of the Zodiac are also given near enough for the general reader.\" His 1865 Deseret Al manac also had Zodiac information."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"Many Mormons have enjoyed the practice of the Mormon religion, but felt very disturbed by the Temple ceremonies.

The members of this Church view the Book of Morm on as scripture, and are led by a prophet, but are in practice different than the LDS church. A NEW TOWER OF BABEL The design of the long awaited RLDS Temple, built on the site of the world's future Millenial capital was the responsibility of the First Presidency and the Pre siding Bishopric. 1 Some people were alarmed when the long awa ited RLDS temple in Independe nce, MO was planned with a spiral design similar to the famed Tower of Babel. Scholars have long viewed the spiral Babylonian Ziggurats to have been the design of th e first Tower of Babel, \"the identification of the tower of Babel with one su ch ziggurat seems inescapable.\" 2 The RLDS prophet Wallace B. Sm ith said, \"The design gives the impression of seeking to link that which is earthbound with the creator who is beyond our reach.\" 3 It is \"a symbol of our vision of Zion.\" 4 According to RLDS sources, this $60 million temp le will not be used for temple ceremonies like the LDS temples. If this information is accu rate, it would mean that the Masonic-like temple ceremonies like the LDS church's and the top secr et witchcraft meetings in the LDS temples would not be take place in the RLDS temple. Th e public stance of the RLDS church is that its temple will not be used for secret ceremonies. THE RLDS GOVERNMENT The government of the RLDS Mormon Church has b een described as Theocr atic or Theocratic Democracy. Although the RLDS prophets have all b een lineal descendents of Joseph Smith, Jr. and his son Joseph Smith III, there has always been an effort toward democr atic processes within this denomination. THE FIRST RLDS PROPHET"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"The first prophet of the RLDS church was the son of Joseph Smith, Jr. named Joseph Smith III. Joseph Smith III had a style of leadership much different than his father's. He also was a leader, but his ideas took the RL DS church in a path that se emed more like the mainstream Christian denominations. The RLDS church initially carried out an active missionary program to recruit LDS members over to their organization. It was believed that the credentials of authority of their organization which were superior to th e LDS would draw Mormons in Utah into their organization. Because the RLDS church was opposed to polyga my (while the LDS church practiced it), and was opposed to other unscriptu ral practices that the LDS church practiced, many non-Mormons and Christians ha ve cooperated with them. Like wise, the cordial relationship between Christians and members of the RLDS church continue. For instance, a R.L.D. Saint works with Saints Alive, a Christian ministry to Mormons and Masons. Joseph Smith III was initially interested in Spir itism, but gave it up, before he became the RLDS prophet. \"Smith took part in the seances in Nauvoo for so me time, but by at least 1852 his interest in Spiritism began to wane. Two significant events turned him against the cu lt and in so doing, may have paved the way for his eventual return to a form of Mormonism.\" 5 Joseph Smith III spoke of his rejection of spiritism, \"I feel it is not a part of the divine plan to allow spirits to communicate with mortals, and I can scarcely see how we can have tangible intercourse with departed spirits...\" 6 Since Joseph Smith, III, the leadership of the RLDS church has been passed down the line of his decendents. (See appendix for list.) THE RLDS CHURCH IS OPEN TO THE OCCULT & SECRET SOCIETIES Although Joseph Smith III sincerely rejected spir itism, the RLDS church itself has never taken a stand against the Masons or other occultic power s. That pattern was es tablished by the General Conference Resolution 175 in 1874. 7 Joseph Smith III said, \"If th ey [church members] choose to belong to the Masons, or Odd Fellows, or any ot her secret organization, they are at liberty to do so as far as the church is concerned.\" 8 According to various Mason historians, many of the RLDS members ha ve been Masons. The Mason Haywood states, \"After the Mormons split, the mother group remained in Illinois, and later made its capital in Independ ence, Mo.; many of its members ha ve been Masons ever since.\" 9 Joseph Smith Ill's successor reaffirmed the c hurch's open attitude toward Freemasonry when he rebuked in 1906 the editor of the Saints Hera ld for an editorial the editor had written. The editorial is very revealing in itself. It said, \"t hat members of the United States Senate who were members of the Masonic Order might feel symp athetic toward Mr. Smoot [an LDS senator under investigation] in regards to the secret oath s by which he was said to be bound to the Mormon hierarchy, since they themselves took such oaths on becoming Masons.\" 10 (Emphasis added.) This comment helps substantiate the Masonic refe rences which state that legally and morally the Masonic Lodge and the LDS church are the same. Here the editor of the Saints Herald. Leon A. Gould, is equating the oaths of the Morm on hierarchy and the Masonic Lodge's oaths. While the RLDS church gives so me good advice against the occult to its members such as an article in the Saints Herald entitled \"Magic and Religion\", 11 it has always given members the latitude to explore and participate in such activ ity. This has been an open door to subversion by the Masons and the New Age.

PARTICIPATION IN THE ONE-WORLD-RELIGION There has been a definite shift in the RLDS church toward th e New Age. It has joined the World Council of Churches, and other such activiti es. 19th century Masoni c plans had goals to introduce feminism and abortion. In the 1970s the RLDS church came out in favor of these items and gave its support to the pr o-New Age group NOW, th e liberal feminist Na tional Organization for Women. 12 The RLDS church has begun participating in such things as an international organization \"Church Women Un ited\" at the United Nations. 13 SMITH'S DAUGHTER Wallace B. Smith has no ma le successor, and there is speculation that on e of his daughters will take the helm once he pa sses on. If this would happen, it woul d seem to insure that the RLDS church will move even closer to a New Age stance. NOTES 1. The Temple Ensign of Peace. RLDS broshure, Inde pendence, Mo.

(The word is being used here with its original meaning and not in the disparaging sense of a body of distorted information.) The influence of Masonic prop oganda must be understood befo re the reader can really appreciate the role Masonry has played not only di rectly but also indirectly in the creation of Millenial religions (millenial religions include a ll types, including a. secu lar millenial religions of all types, including a. secular millenial religions such as Communism, b. pagan gnostic millenial religions such as the Nazi religion, the New Age movement, and their allies the New Thought c hurches, and c. Chris tian gnostic millenial religions such as the Jehova h's Witnesses, Mormons, Sec ond Adventists, and certain Dispensationalists.) The connections between Masonic propoganda and the creation of e ach of these groups is there for historians to see, if they choose. Examine th e statements and history of the leaders of these movements and one will find that they studied the stream of masonic propoganda that has issued forth over several centuries. The Order (Skull and Bones—considered to be an American Branch of the Illuminati) have held many key political , and economic posts and have been able to manipulate what propoganda the public has had easy access to. In other words Masonic thinkers have had help in the promotion of their thinging, not only by other Masons but by the Order, which is a power above them, but working with them. And this stream of Masonic thinking has had a snowball eff ect, in influencing others to act, and further promoting this stream of thought. What characterizes the Masonic thought? First, it sees a return to a Go lden Age, a Millenial hope. This is often connected with the reestab lishment of some Messiah king/priest to rule. Reason and Gnosticism and evolution are promoted. Christianity is attack ed or limited, and secularization is promoted. The s ubterfuge in much of this is amazing. For instance, the JWs under the guise of religion have helped ban religion from public places. The best understanding of what is happening is not to look at labels , but the process, what happened. For instance, whether a Communist calls his belie f a religion or not, is not releva nt if his belief is in essence a millenial religion, granted it is a religion without many of the normal religious trappings. Although a closer look reveals most of the tra ppings of religion are th ere, under a new cover. The separation of church and state, the promoti on of feminist rights including abortion, and the New Age religion have been promoted by the Masonic lodges, not just individual Masons. This gives the reader a quick overview of the Masonic stream of thought. Two charts follow which should help the reader grasp the extent to which Western Civilization has been shaped by this massive, sometimes a quiet undercurrent of Masonic thought. One chart is fo r Masonic authors in the 18th century, the other for the 19th century. English Freemasonry exerte d a profound influence on the great reformers of the eighteenth century.

It is true that a U.S. President has power, but let him overstep the path he is to follow, and those who have put him in power will tighten the screws, with bad press, or if neccessary the final solution, asassination. That is what happened to John Kenn edy and Abraham Lincoln. Those two men ticked off practically ev eryone in the System. The Jesuits, the Industrialists, the Masons, in Kennedy's case one can add to the list the CIA, the FBI, and the Mafia. 1 To avoid such drastic steps, key men are in gove rnment positions to insure that the President receives the slant to the news that will allow th e President to see the right path. The Council on Foriegn Relations regularly determined at secret meetings high level CIA policy. The CIA in turn is capable of presenting their secret briefings to th e President to almost insu re that he sees their slant to things. 2 The foundations are one conduit of control. Th ey create and implemen t government policies through their staff people which are salted throughout the U.S. government. 3 That the New World Order must use the CIA, FBI, and the Foun dations shows that it has to work secretly. As a cover for their secret i nvisible government, they run carefully screened handpicked men in expensive democratic elec tions. This allows the populace to continue believing what they want to believe . Most people want to believe th ey are superior to others, and our \"democratic\" system allows Americans to be proud. That the One-World-Power pays for these expensive charades, shows how important secrecy is. The success of Big Brother in 1984 was exactly the type of control that they have been successfully us ing—double speak, hate politics, divide and contro l, rewritten history, etc. These same tactics are being used powerfully on the religious scene. FORGOTTEN HISTORY Years ago, this Author came upon several areas of religion that are examples of history being lost. This Author is very devoted to the Holy Bible and its age old wis dom. It was clear from the Scriptures in both the Old and the New Test ament that taking Interest, any interest, was contrary to scripture. I discovere d that interest taking had been fo rbidden by most Christians until the 19th century. The New Order has erased our memory of that issue, and for a good reason, that is one of their principle methods of robbery a nd control. (Because this is one of their primary weapons, and it is also a religious issue— chapter 3.02 will deal with just the issue of interest taking.) FORMULA FOR POWER The close interweaving of Gnostic thought into the Masonic stream is important in terms of understanding how power is created. The principl e \"knowledge is power\" is skillfully used by Masonic religions. For instance, the WT May 1, 1922, p. 132 states C.T. Russell is the only source of knowledge about the divine plan of God. \"Then to repudiate him and his work is equivalent to a repudiation of the Lord...\" Jose ph Smith, Jr. and the \"Bhagwan Shree\" Rajneesh, and so many others, by virtue of their claims to special knowledge have created an automatic power base. One has to co me to them for knowledge. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, ESPECIALLY IF ONE CONTROLS WHO THE EXPERTS ARE Likewise, the Order along with Masons in so many of the key positions have determined who our experts are in the various fields.

Erasmus Darwin became a Mason in the famous Canongate Kilwinning Lodge No. 2 of Edinburgh, Scotland. He founded and others into the occult joined the Philosophical Society in 1784. This Author was surprised that the Masonic historian Denslow was quite aware and open that the Philosophical Society \"was the fountainhead for the ideas developed by hi s [Erasmus Darwin] grandson, Charles.\" 5 Co- discover of the evolutionary theory with Charles Darwin was Sir William Crookes of the Theosophical Society. Anyone familiar with th e Theosophical Society knows they believe in Hinduism. The man who translated Darwin's work s into German soon after they were written was another Freemason. The Hi ndu concept of Evolution diffu sed from Darwin into many other areas of the arts and sciences.

Darwin never proved evolution, indeed the \"historical\" record does not scientifically prove the General Evolution Model but contradicts it.

This attitude is deeply embedded now in the various churches. This s ecular gnosticism has creat ed the followers and the leaders, and their system selects their me n as leaders. If the publ ic knew the details of how the Order, Illumined groups, especially th e Masons, have conspired to elevate certain academic guru's for us to follow, they would r ealize how the pretended pyramid of knowledge has helped create a pyramid of power. As discussed in th e chapter on Educa tion, John Dewey, the main creator of modern education, was financed, instructed by, and promoted by the Order. Some in the Order even create their own universities, an example is the Univ. of Chicago started in 1890 with Rockefeller Fund s. The Rockefellers started others too."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"CHRIST REJECTED POWER RELIGION There are quite a number of re cent books that try to get th e public to believe Christ believed in power religion and hi dden knowledge. This is such a distorted view that in spite of all the propoganda out there, it should be easy for the sincere person to be shown in the scriptures that it is false. Although Christ was intimate w ith 12 men, and then had his 70, and then the masses, his teachings were in contradiction to this gnostic idea of a hidden knowle dge . This will be dealt with indepth later, suffice it to say, that Christ did not advocate using hidden knowledge for power, and he showed no desi re to create any power base of goodness. This is why so many Rabbis have a hard time in terpreting Christ correctly. They think he failed as a candidate for David's throne. They think in terms of power. Secular and religious authori ties have been set up who clai m to have special knowledge. The men who have controlled the advancement and placement of others are a particular group of men, who are related in some fashion to each other. The particular heads of thes e groups claiming special knowledge are then controlled by an elite group. For instance, the leaders of the Communist country of Russi a have been selected by them. The leaders of the Mormon Latter- Day-Saints, and New Age groups receive instructions from them. The careers of thousan ds of our leaders like Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixen have been created and directed by them. Various channels of control are in use. One council controls religion. Manly P. Hall sat on this council of 13 and was able to use UNES CO to channel communi cations from Britian. l British military intelligence is also used. When one sees the connections between the Masons and the FBI and CIA, and then th e connections all of these have to the Mormons for instance, then one is able to see how a complex set of secret networks can tran smit secretly through a host of routes. Another blatant example, are the connections between the directors of the intelligence cults of the CIA and the FBI and the One-World-Power and the Masons. For a particular route to be revealed, means only th at another needs to be implemented. The intelligence cults of the FBI and CIA will be examined in detail later. Examples of how the conspiracy directly prov ides power to their network of offspring will be the next feature of this chapter. We will examine how the same people who funded the Communists funded the Mormons. We will see how the ch annel of communication and orders for the power, UNESCO was created by them. We will examine how the prominant families that make up the Order, the power here in the U.S., happened to be the families that were prominent in the creation and control of the Jehovah's Witn esses. We will see how a well spring of Unitarian heresy was directly r un by the Order. We will examine specific ways the Masons have promoted the New Age movement, and how the New Age Movement has been systematically planned, and is not an accide nt of history. All these are examples of what has been happening on a world-wide but secret level for several hundred years. AN ARISTOCRACY In dealing with the conspiracy of power it be comes evident that not only is networking and associations important, but also family lines a nd family ties. Authors, who are not even aware of the conspiracy of power, have written books e xposing that America has an Aristocracy, but America's Aristocrats are very low key comp ared with Great Britia n. Even today, the privileges that the British aris tocracy still retain are easily seen by those who are not so"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"fortunate in birth. Everyone is aware that Britia n has an aristocracy, but one has to try to convince Americans of theirs. At the very top of power in the U.S. is a ti ght group of 20 to 30 fa milies that intermarry and interact. Particular members of these familie s are selected for member ship in a few secret groups such as the Skull and Bones Order, which has been a cell for the Power. The Skull and Bones Order, as the reader may now realize, is strongly suspected as one of the American chapter's of the Illuminati. Those in the Skull and Bones Order if they are involved in religion tend toward the Unitarian Church, which presently is merged with the Universa list Church as the Unitarian- Universalist Church and is activel y promoting the New Age Movement. The Order works hand in glove with another group also called the Order—that is the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith. It is no surprise then to learn that the B'nai B'rith also has connections to not only Freemasonry but the Bavarian Illuminati. Both the Order (S&B) and the B'nai B'rith wo rk through the Masonic Lodges. In studying UNESCO it is apparent all three groups have power in UNESCO. Notes. 1. Marrs, Jim.

They have taken two opposite views of the situation. Someti mes they quote the same material and get tw o different views. Dave Hunt's books forecast peace and prosperity a nd a rapture of the saints. He tells us that reports about the dangers from the CFR and the Trilaterial Commission, communism (socialism), and New Age groups are overblown. It might be appropriate to quote the man himself, \"In contrast to the gloom-and-doom and frighten ing forecasts of the vast majority of Christians and non-Christians alik e, we shall propose \"A Contra ry Scenario\": a coming new age of unprecented peace and prosperity just over th e horizon!\" -Peace, Prosperity and The Coming Holocaust, p. 18 As proof of this Dave Hunt quotes a number of experts, researches at Rand Corp.(p.ll), Herman Kahn, head of the Hudson Institute (p.12) , and Robert Muller, a man Hunt describes as \"certainly one of the best informed men in the wo rld\" (p.12). By the way, all of these people are intimately connected to the New Or der, and Muller is not just one of the best informed, but one of the most dangerous men in the world for Christians. \"Much of an alarmist nature has been ru mored about a conspiracy among top political leaders in Washington to betray America's nationa l interests...However, th e Trilateralists and CFR people are invaribly refe rred to with exaggerations...Does this hypnotic control extend to every nation on earth?

These people will be sent to another dimension, will pass into spirit, and be neutra lized, and be washed away fo r their karmic debts. These euphemisms remind us of the words of New Ag e adept (and I refer to him thusly—because I have seen New Agers refer to him thusly and because I am familiar w ith his religion) Adolf Hitler, and how he pla nned to \"cleanse\" Europe . Alice Bailey describes that cleansing as a penalty to the Jewish people because of their bad karmic debt.

Remember?

This is why I have chosen not to quote scripture to inform you what the New World Order is doing. I believ e in Scripture, and that the sincere moral spirit-led seeker will find the true interpretation as God's grace permits. But this book and its research stand on their own, without pulling some Bible text out of Ezekiel or Daniel. OPEN YOUR EYES, HYPOCRITES Jesus, (who obviously didn't take Dale Carne gie's Cource on Human Relations), calls the people who came to hear him hypocrites, \"W hen you see a cloud rising out of the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming'; and so it is. And when you see the south wind blow, you say, 'There will be hot weat her'; and there is. \"Hypocrites! You can discern the face of the earth, but how is it you do not discern this time?\" With all our technology, is our discernment any better? Let me inform you of a \"south wind\"—a certain policeman has already informed us that he has seen the lists of people the US government —part of Bush's New World Order—plan to arrest. (See chapter 3.9 for more about this.) Let me inform you of this \"south wind\"—a friend of mine receiv ed all the election statistics on a map months before the actua l \"election\" of Bush and Duka kis. These figures were not projections, they were the planned results. (Hun t would have you believe that its rediculous, alarmist, and dangerous to hear that CFR people in Washington, D.C. might conspire and have power. He says if they were so powerful they would put their own man in office. Mr. Hunt, for your information they have been placing their own men in even before this century—see Appendix, and have had the power to keep it from the general public.) A graduate research project at Florida State Univer sity on Who's Running America told the American people after intensive study that power in the United States of the media, various economic fields, politics, etc. is concentrated in an elite, and that th e policy of that the Government carries out are decisions made outside of the elected government officials. There is nothing alarmist in their book which records their research finding, but it is just one more report of that \"South Wind\" that we should discern."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"Let me also inform you that there are many leaders in this nation and the U.N. who we know are into witchcraft and the New Age.(This chapte r will discuss that some more later.) Men of power are turning to the leaders of Satanic groups for power and money. The army has developed its own Psychic warriors- an actual military un it made up of demon empowered men, paid for by your tax-dollars. Why would these people want to arrest God-fearing, peacefu l, good-intentioned Christians? Is this simply because George Bu sh likes Alice Ba iley's books? What do th ey have to fear from Christians? The answer to these questions is the topic of this chapter. This answer will in part answer why the New Age movement is prom oted by the One-World-Order. Promote? Didn't the New Age movement just happen? No, it's been promoted by some very powerful people.(See chap. 3.3.) For instance, rock music stars which are i dolized by the youth of the world have been instrumental in bringing millions of young pe ople in Eastern mystic ism and the New Age Movement, and into Satanism. For instance, Wa rner Bros. and CBS (owned by Jews) have not ceased to put out some of ro ck's most objectionable material . Warner's produced Frank Zappa's \"The Mothers,\" Prince's \"Dirty Mind,\" Exile's \"I Want To Kiss You All Over,\" and Alice Cooper's \"I Love The Dead.\" CBS Records produced Tosh's \"L egalize It,\" Pink Floyd's \"The Wall,\" Dr. Hook's \"Sl oppy Seconds,\" Ted Nugent's \"Scream Dr eam,\" and others. Atlantic Records located in Rockefeller Plaza, NY, Capital Recor ds, and Electra/Asylum have also produced objectionalbe records. Teenagers are not foistering these evil records on themselves. It is not by accident that a record company cuts a certai n record. Who is ultimat ely responsible for the Satanism and New Age Movement 's promotion in rock music? But it wasn't enough just to in terest people in the New Age— they needed gurus from India to lead the young people off on their various path s. So the VHP (Vishva Hindu Parishad) was formed. It is a missionary counci l of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Lingayats, th e Theosophical Society etc. that are organized and financed to import Hinduism et. al. in to the Western World. In 1966, the VHP had their first missionary conference. 3 Their VHP in house magazine is the Vishva Hinda Par. The Tibeta n Dalai Lama was the presiden t of their semi-secret VHP Conference in 1979. 4 Sixty-thousand delegates and others participated. Yes, the leader of the Hindu Missionary Organizatio n, this Dalai Lama is the same Dalai Lama that is receiving awards and honors all over the world, not just by the secular world, but by Christendom's leadership. The Da lai Lama is a great man, but he thinks he is God, the reincarnation of Buddha. As a Christian, I am reminded of the scriptures where the elders worship the Creator, \"You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will th ey exist and were created.\" Rv 4:9 If this seems off the track, it isn't—its actually involves the underlying answer to why Bible- believing Christians (and Bible- believing-Jews, and Koran followi ng Moslems) are in conflict with the New Order. Both Moses and Christ tried to give the common people the perm ission to have access to God, and their God was not just some imitation god either. The relig ious leaders were requiring initiations in India, Babylon, Gr eece and Egypt into their myst ery religions. They supposedly were the guardians of exoteric mystery knowledge. As long as the people gave alligence to their power structure the common peopl e generally were permitted to think they could be gods, and do whatever they wanted. In Hindui sm, heresy is to teach that ma n is separate from God. This is directly opposite of the Christian concept of sin, where sin is defined as those imperfections"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"that separate us from our Creator such as transgressing the law of God. No matter how deceptive it's said, the truth is that Hinduism has no con cept of sin, (sin being defined scriptually as anything separating us from the glory of God and transgressing the law.) For example, the \"Bhagwan Shr ee\" Rajneesh, and his staff rule d over their Antelope commune with a strict power structure, but the common people were allowed freedom to act as they pleased. Amand Sheila, Rajneesh's trusted right hand woman, has been a devoted student of the satanist Hitler, and studied his methods. 5 Moses and Jesus, both in blatant disregard for the religious hierarchies of their day, set out to free the Israelites from false aut horities. The Egyptian Mystery re ligions kept the common people worshiping a pantheon of Gods, but the higher init iates in the secret soci eties were taught that there is but one God. 6 Also each Christ tried to point out that sin can be a false taskmaster far worse than the Romans. He tried to teach the people to realize th ey have direct access to their Creator, without a hierarchy. Each man was a priest. But toda y's New Age \"cosmic Christians\" have stood Christ's teachings on their head. They promise freedom, but then offer the things Christ said enslave us. They promise each of us that we can be gods ourse lves, but then give us \"spiritual laws\", and the Grea t White Brotherhood Hierarchy, and our own positive thinking (magic will power) to trust in. For instance, to give an example, Elizabeth Cl are Prophet has five rings of interested people in her movement, Pearl's Reader (5th), Keeper of the Flame (4 th), Community Member (3rd), Temporary Staff (2nd), and Permanent Staff (top le vel), and finally her, Elizabeth Clare Prophet. E.C. Prophet (who for some reason always uses th e last name of her first husband, Mark Prophet rather than her last three husbands), is a very strict authoritarian with her church. Although her members are promised godhood—only she is allowe d to channel messages from the Great White Brotherhood. When a particular couple went onto permanent staff, they were repeatedly counselled to cease channeling. 7 Masonic references to witchcra ft abound. In Pike's Morals a nd Dogma page 733 he refers to the Kabalah (which he calls philosophy but co uld best be called magi c). In the next two paragraphs he talks glowingly of \"the powers of the human will.\" Th at is what witchcraft is all about. 33° Mason C. W. Leadbeat er in his book The Hidden Life in Freemasonry refers to the Senior Deacon in Masonic rituals as taking on the ro le of Lucifer. \"The S.D. is the Lucifer, who bears the light to his fellow-men.\" (p. 125 plus others) And his pages 311- 12 refer to gigantic \"Angels\" taking over 33° Masons. These are just off hand samples of many similar Masonic references. If one really understands the occult/Luciferian/witchcraft nature of Freemasonry, then it becomes clear why the power of the Lodge promotes the reviva l of the Mystery Religions. In contrast with Christ, the Masonic Lodge tries to keep its power to an exclusive clique. According to ex-High Satanic Priestess Brown, \"Demons have no loyalties. They will always go to the stronger person. Satan's entire kingdom runs on the principle of competition; just the opposite of God's kingdom where everyone serves each other.\"—He Came To Set The Captives Free, p.48 USING WITCHCRAFT TO FIGHT OPPONENTS OF \"THE PLAN\" Alice A. Bailey in her book A Treatise On White Magic or The Way of The Disciple (NY: Lucis Publishing Co., 1951) p.346 teaches her New Age disciples how to fight \"forces that are working against the Plan and hindering the work to be done....To counter them you employ the first method with the following additions and ch anges. You link yourself up either as an individual or forming one of a group with your own soul and with the Lodge of Masters, not"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"simply with your own Master, but with the Brot herhood for which you are working. Then when stillness has been achieved, you visualize thos e Masters of whom you know, and raising your vibration higher still, you connect up, if possibl e, with the Chohans, w ith the Christ and the Manu, according to the line, religious or politi cal, with which you may be working, and along which the attack will come. You then pour th rough the linking chain, and through all the vehicles, a stream of violet light.\" The New Order doesn't fear gnostic religions, they simply take them over if they didn't create it in the first place. They fear people who will unreservably serv e God and follow his Authority no matter what. This may still not be clear. Let us give an example that hits home in many Christian denominations toda y, witchcraft. A DIFFERENCE IN TERMINOLOGY The following diagram shows a conflict between the historic Christian terminology and that of the occult in defining witchcraft. Historically, Christianity has called A through D witches, while in the occult some would say only those at level D are witches. HOW THE DIAGRAM IS DIVIDED The diagram showS that witchcraft and magic can said to be performed either for \"good\", or evil. Witchcraft can also be done with physical implements, or secr etly with some internal power. From those two divisions, four possi bilities arise as is diagramed. Some examples of what is meant by the four categories. A (E-BNL)- Person with a ouiji board B (E-HML)- Person sticking pins in a voodoo doll C (I-BNL)- This is a whole area th at has entered into the Chris tian churches through people like Jimmy Carter's sister Ruth Carter Stapleton, who is said to be the top witch in North America. She calls it \"inner healing.\" It has various name s and variations. Basica lly, it is casting a good spell on someone, including oneself. D (I-HML)- Casting a harmful spell on someone. Historically, Christians have rejected all of these forms of Witchcraft. But today Block C has been introduced into many Chris tian churches. It is introduced through New Agers who pretend to be Christians, either as speak ers or as members. (Yes, pretend is the proper description because some are actually infiltrating, knowing full we ll what they are doing.) Kurt Billings, whose mother was a high witch, was trained by the New Age to infiltrate chur ches posing as a born- again Christian. He told his stor y on Praise The Lord , Beaumont, TX. 8 Men like Kurt who were taught how to infiltrate and subvert the Christia n churches are trying to warn the Christians. The new age also uses books such as How to Write Your Own Ticket With God to promote their witchcraft too."},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"St. Paul, Minnesota is one training center for w itches to infiltrate the Christian churches posing as Christians. 9 The Pentecostal and Charismatic move ment has been infiltrated, including portions of the leadership. 9a Isn't everyone free to talk about what they belie ve? Yes, but there is a right way and a wrong way. Let's give a true but an extreme example. When the \"Bhagwan Shree Rajnees h came to the U.S., his members dressed conservatively and joined a good size Christian chur ch in California pretending to be Christians. When Rajneesh had a majority of his people as members, they voted the chur ch to Rajneesh. 10 We are talking about a church that others had worked hard to build and to pay for, but through decept ion was grabbed by Rajneesh. Likewise, if we prac tice that type of deception to ca pture a church spiritually is it any better? Buildings can be replaced. I ndividual's can't, each one is precious. There is the possibility that those wanting to destroy Christianity will be converted. One man from England into spiritism who jo ined an Assembly of God ch urch intending to lead its members into spiritism, ended up being converted to Christ. 11 This author is aware of a few others too who were Satanists th at were sent to destroy church es and converted to serve their Creator. A DIFFERENCE IN AUTHORITY contrast Christian prayer Witchcraft invoking/decreeing Authority: God who is Authority: A god(s) who is not supernatural & involved. involved, godlike power given to everyone. Supplication of trust W o r d s i n v o k e s p i r i t u a l laws of spirit world. Not to be done ritually, or Formulae and ritual, repetitions in vain repetitions, by by spirit speaking through the heart. called \"faith, trust, hope\" called \"scientific.\" This is in part the reason the World Order is promoting the New Age movement. The New Age movement is subtly creating a different Auth ority than God Almighty . The Christian Creator can't be controled. He is a rival authority to those in power, and they can't tolerate a rival. In order to mask their own di ctatorship, the New World Order is permitting almost any type of carnal behavior to its duped slaves. H.G. Wells felt the New Wo rld Order needed to create a rulership, \"a caste\" as he calls it, that would be quasi-religious and would \"pander to all your worst instincts.\" 12 At the very top of the power structure of the New World Order are the Rothschilds. (See chapter 3.3 for a more indepth look into this dynasty.) Prominent member s of this family in recent times have been Philippe (the leader), Ed mund, Victor, Guy, and Nathaniel. Philippe is"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"a business partner with Queen Julia na.(See chapter 2.12 for a discu ssion of their role.) The upper levels of witches believe that the Rothschilds are lesser gods in bodies. 13 The Rothschilds have been part of witchcraft and the Illuminati for generations. Th eir enormous godlike financial powers must indeed help convi nce them that they are gods. Within the Satanic groups there is an elite soci ety of witches called the The Sisters of Light. They are also called the Illuminati, but are not organizationally to be c onfused with the main group of Illuminati that are Drui d witches. The Brotherhood that The Sisters of Light belong to is linked to the Druids though. Both the Sist ers of Light Illuminati and the Druid Illuminati practice human sacrifice. 14 Numerous other occult groups are named Illuminati. The Brotherhood works with other occult groups su ch as the Freemasons. It has its own retreat centers, airplanes, etc. It uses churches for some of their cerem onies. Human sacrifices are being performed within Christian churches. 15 These satanic groups sacrific e babies born to witches who have no birth certificates, members who want out, and people like hitchhikers that they pick up. Human sacrifices are generall y done indoors. The Brotherhood ha s developed disposal of the bodies to a fine art. Uniting the world under one world gove rnment is a goal of witchcraft. 16 Another goal is to destroy Christianity. Ma ny of the members of the satanic group The Brotherhood join Christian churches, which they then proceed to destroy over a period of time. 17 Alice Bailey speaks about channeli ng Jesus in her book Externalizati on of the Hierarchy, p. 514, and Kurt Billings speaks now about his years with in the Christian churches when he channelled a demon named \"Jesus.\" Other ex -Witches have testified that wh en they infiltrated Christian churches they used all the Christian language including doing things in \"Jesus'\" name. A Council of 13 under their direction gives orde rs throughout the worl d to religious groups even \"Christian\" churches. Because this Council of 13 is so powerful and secretly controls so many of their puppets that run many of the different denominations, it is of v ital interest to this book's subject that an examination be done of the people on this Counc il. Those on the council can either hold the view that true witches ar e only born to families of witches (indicated by T for Traditionalist) or that anyone can become a witch by training and practice (indicated by an M for Modernist). THE COUNCIL OF 13 (Druid witc hes aka Illuminati) (As of Spring, 1978)(This information comes from basically one source, and without further verification should be treated the same as getting an opinion from a doctor—it's alwa ys best to have a second opinion.)

Manson believed his group would grow to 144,000. 20 We have seen how va rious religious groups started by Masons have emphasized the number 144,000. As the reader may recall in chapter 1.2, the OTO or Ordo Templi Orientis was the distillation and power of many Masonic and occult groups. The OTO's lodge in Los Angeles was The Proce ss Church of the Final Judgement. 21 One of it's masonic members was the witch and relig ious leader Charles Manson. 22 In his trial, he flashed the Masonic sign several times to his judge , apparently hoping to gain leniency. 23 HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS Originally in the Garden of Eden Satan began wh at is called Gnosticism, that is that knowledge will save man. 24 Satan led Eve astray for his own perv erse satisfaction in rebellion to his Creator. From Gnosticism came the Myster y Religions. The Mystery Religions were called mysteries because they concealed their religious knowledge for only a select few. They were an excellent way for men to use religion for their own selfish ends. From believing that knowledge save s, and then from searching for that light, men came to worship Lucifer who pretended to be that agen t of enlightment. Thus the mystery religions developed an exoteric teaching such as the worshi p of fire, the sun, sex, light, and snakes to conceal the esoteric teaching of Luciferian wo rship. The center of th e mystery religions was Babylon and from the mystery religions come Hi nduism, Egyptian Paganism, Greek mythology, Rabbinic Judaism, and Freemasonry. The names of items were changed and the legends were altered slightly but the various mysteries are like Hollywood script s, they follow only a few basic patterns. For instance, in the book Ancient Mys tic Oriental Masonry we see how the various mysteries are equated \"...yet we readily recognize in Hiram Abif , one of the Grand Masters of Freemasons, the Osirus of the Egyptians, the Mithra s of the Persians, the Bacchus of the Greeks, the Dionysius of the Fraternity of the Artif icers, and the Atys of the Phrygians...\" 25 A further developement in the Mystery religions came from the Babylonian branch of religion headed by the Pharisees (now known as Talmudic Judaism). They perverted the faith and hope that men had in a coming redeem er and developed Millenialism. Millenialism split of in various directions. One Satanist/humanist branch is wh at is known as Communism (that is the system developed from Marxism). Within the churches Communi sm is called Libera tion Theology. There is evidence that many of the historical big figure Communist leaders were not atheists, but satanists. Karl Marx is just one prominent ex ample. If so, then Communism is simply another mystery religion with humanism, atheism, and stat e worship as the exoteric for the masses, with Satanism as its esoteric teaching for the higher ups. On the surface, Communism, Freemasonry and Sata nism appear like three separate items. Those who have investigated the National C ouncil of Churches are aware that it and its predecessor the FCC were Communist Fronts. With in this book you have learned that the NCC was operated by Masonry, and that Masonic Lodges started communi sm. The reader has read in chapter 1.2 about satanists controlling Freemasonr y. With all this in mind, it should be no surprise then that the National Council of Chur ches accepted the Church of Satan of Anton LaVey as one of its members. 26 Satanists in Israel work with the secret satanic group called Th e Brotherhood.

As Satan and the dem ons are limited beings they must build up human strongholds. In Belgium is an ornate Cathed ral with an ornate balcony of gold and a 1,000 points of light within it. The is where the Quee n Mother stays. It is also wh ere the White Book which contains the history of the world written in blood on parchm ent is kept. A pregnant woman is sacrificed, and the infant in her womb rescue d. Some of the infant's blood is then taken and used to write down the progress that has been made historic ally in the enslavemen t of the human race by a One-World government. 26a At Inyokern, southern CA area n ear the China Lake Naval Weapon s Center at a Naval hospital, is a doctor from Germany known He rr Doktor Green. This doctor is one of the better Satanic programmers. Many people around the country (many of them children) are flown in to him and are programmed by him. He has va rious techniques. One of the pop ular one is called Twinning. The subject is subjected to fam ily movies in one eye and cere monial and porn movies in the other. The rapid pictures are stressful to the eyes . Angled mirrors and intense lights are used in the process. The mind consciously begins concen trating on the family pi ctures and forces the terrible satanic pictures that are being flashed in the other eye in to the subconscious. This process is done to two people in such a way as to su bconsciously bond them to each other. The end result of the technique is created twins—magically paired sisters or brot hers who when brought together later at some call back will function as a team. These teams do not know each other, but as the final countdown to the plan gets into full swing are being calle d back. Each twin is not given all their plans but only part so that they fit togeth er when they come together. However, if one dies, the team still has one person to carry out their part of the plan for world domination. 26a Henry Gruver, a man of God, re lates how a powerful Satanist ca me to Christ in Omaha. In the insueing spiritual ba ttle, this ex-Satanist showed him and others where human sacrifices were to be done in the storm sewers of Omaha on th e solstice. Gruver watched the Lord God Almighty bring a storm which the Omaha papers called \"a mystery storm\" which mysteriously appeared over Omaha and filled up the sewers dur ing the days around the solstice. 27 This is just one of many stories that could be told, showing the pow er of Jesus Christ over the Satanic realm. Satanists and witches have on num erous occasions sincerely repe nted and become follows of Jesus Christ. Another example is a man who recently was sent out to kill the minister who dared hold a public Christian rally on Halloween. The power of the joy and peace he saw on the faces of the Christians led him to ren ounce Satan and turn to Christ. 28 The positive energy, the spiritual power of Christ, that is present when Christians meet creates strongholds th at are obstacles to the Power of the New World Order. While there has been a serious increase of the Power of Satan and his mystery religions, this story will not seen in its full c ontext unless we see also the might y hand of God, working quietly to display His power over the principalities and powers. The establishmen t media will not tell you of such victories. If you want to get a balanced view of history, and not just learn about the activities of evil, you must begin listening to what God is doing around the world. NOTES 1. Marrs, Texe.

Hall, 33° Mason, desc ribed as Masonry's greatest philo sopher, was part of the Order of the Quest. He wrote \"...there exists in the world today, and has existed for thousands of years, a body of enlightened humans united in what might be termed, an Order of the Quest. It is composed of those whose intellectual and spiritu al perceptions have revealed to them that civilization has a secret Destiny— secret, I say, because this high purpose is not realized by the many; the great masses of peoples still live al ong without any knowledge whatsoever that they are part of a Universal Motion...it is men lik e Plato and Buddha who still exercise the most powerful force in mortal affairs...\" 1 British author and researcher Ian Taylor discovered that the humanists which included the early masonic thinkers in the 1500s we re fed up with the corruption in their governments of the time. They decided that Plato's vision of a Utopian government ruled by well paid wise men was the best answer. To create this New World Order th ey would have to destroy the Old World Order of the monarchs. Of course, in general the peoples of the various countries and their monarchs were unfavorable to Plato's Republic, so the Masonic New World Order agenda had to done secretly. 2 United States was their first child, and served as a model, the \"carrot\" so to speak, to hold up to the world to motivate all the nations to overthrow th eir their rulers. After the steady secret growth of their power helped by the upheavals of revolutions, the Orde r of the Quest's wise men now currently secretly rule the world. The major capitalist countries have these ruling bodies of wise men. 3 In the United States this body is called Ma jesty 12 (this body has other names too.) The Jason Society, part of the Order of the Quest, makes up part of th e members of this secret ruling body of wise men. Plato in his writing Republic advocated socia lism (aka communism) for Utopia. Plato also believed differences in personal property could be kept within strict bounds by a supertax of 100% on incomes beyond the statuatory limits. The most important function of government was to be State controlled education. Plato believed in early PE for children. He is also held to be the originator ot the primary/secondary school idea. Plato believed that in Utopia (the New World Order) the distinctions between the sexes should be abolished. State run schools should not teach children that any distinction exists between the two sexes. Finally, Plato believed that philosopher-kings (w ise men) shall be trained in the supreme science which \"see the one in the many and the many in th e one.\" That is the dialectical process. The wise men were to be \"dialecticians.\" 4 In this chapter, you will beco me a dialectician. You will \"s ee the one in the many and the many in the one.\" This chapter will examine an d compare the written plans of the various groups which were participants of (and generally c ontrolled by) the Order of the Quest. Water to become a river needs a river bed to fl ow. Ideas likewise can st agnate in pools rather than flow down through history, unless a bed of compatible world views (Weltanschauung) occurs into which to conduct the ideas successive ly from the minds of one generation the minds of another. Sometimes it seems ideas become underground streams. Our world-views are developed in large part by our parents. This e xplains in part why the lineal descent of ideas"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"follows geneological lineages. (For instance, Mary Baker Eddy and the E ddy family have been involved in witchcraft for generations.) 5 The Branches of the Order of th e Quest such as the Jason Society, the Prieure de Sion, and others have been crucial to c ontinuation of their plans. The notable feature of the One-World- Power is that their planning is long-term. Such long term continuity suggests an \"alien\" or \"demonic\" factor holding it all together. Indeed, th at such super-natural beings have helped is suggested by Manly P. Hall and many others associated with the Or der of the Quest. Perhaps as a possible example, a relative of An ton LaVey, who is Christian, st ated that Anton LaVey, leader of the Church of Satan, when x-rayed afte r an accident did not have a human skeleton. Manly P. Hall states \"Wise men, the ancients be lieved, were a separate race, and to be born into this race it was necessary to develop the mind to a state of en lightened intelligence...It is this larger and coming race that will some day inher it the earth... Our age of gold will pass and some day the Golden Age will come again.\" 6 \"Plato's political vision was for the restoration of the Empire of the Gold en Age. The old ways of the gods must be restored...Two thousand years later Lord Bacon re-sta ted this vision in his New Atlantis.\" -Manly P. Hall, Th e Secret Destiny of America, p.63. Is the reader beginning to see the continuity between Plato's Utopia, Sir Francis Bacon's New Atlantis, and 33° Mason Geor ge Bush's New World Order? But Plato and Bacon saw something else. Th ey saw an ideal philosopher-king who was a priest to the people of the gods. Halls descri bes the New World Order's king, \"This king was descended of a divine race; that is, he belonge d to the Order of the Illumined; for those who come to a state of wisdom th en belong to the family of he roes—perfected human beings.\" 7 This is the Illuminati—the so-called Christ-men that have been prepared by the various parts of the New World Order. The Pri eure de Sion has as its task the preservation of the geneology of the purported lineal descendants of Christ. Th e Holy Grail=the holy bloodline=sang rael. The Prieure de Sion plans to seat the new Christ-Pri est-King on a world-wide throne and restore the lost treasures of the Jerusalem Temple when the time is correct. 8 An examination of the leaders of the Prieure de Sion will show they have also been prominant Rosicrucians, Freemasons, and the lead ers of other esoteric societies. The descendants of the Merovingian dynasty ar e the purported descenda nts of the House of David and Christ. The Merovingian Dynasty's surv ivors exist in the Hapsburgs, the St. Clairs, Sinclairs, Montesquious, Planta rds and a host of other names. 9 A member of the Prieure de Sion stated that \"Without the Merovingians, the Prieure de Sion Sion would not exist, and without the Prieure de Sion, the Merovingi an dynasty would be extinct.\" 10 The Merovingian dynasty ruled in the area of Fra nce from the 5th to the 8th century. Later the blood line of the Merovingians joined with the Hapsburg Dynasty when Charles V de Lorraine married Eleonore Marie von Habsburg daughter of Ferdinand III, Emporor of the Holy Roman Empire in the 18th century. SYMBOLOGY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLOODLINE Symbols associated with the royal bloodline are the Holy Grail legends and initiations. The legend of the Round Table also is associated with the Grail, as well as a sacred stone. New Age,"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Masonic and esoteric lite rature abounds with refe rences to Round Tables, sacred stones, and the Holy Grail. The original Knights Templars were originally asso ciated with the Prieure de Sion but split off. The Knights Templars' leader was Jacques DeMolay after whom the Masonic boys' group DeMolay is named after. The Kn ights Templars created and used the Skull and Crossbones as their emblem. After the King of Fra nce and the Pope tried to elim inate the Templars they fled to various countries. Centuries old gravestone s in Scotland from the years after the Knights Templars fled to Scotland can be seen with their skull and bones symbol. Merovee was the first of the Me rovingian Kings. His son was King Childeric. Merovee's tomb has not been found, but the tomb of his son King Childeric revealed a deep interest into magic and the occult. 300 beautiful miniture solid gold bees were found his tomb . The bee symbol has continued in various forms to represent the desc endents of Merovee. The fleur-de-lie s developed from it, and has been a promin ent french logo, due to the hea vy influence of the Merovingian descendants. Napoleon and his second wife Ma rie Louise Habsburg (a Merovingian descendent) took the 300 gold bees and had them sown onto their coronation robes. 11 Two prominent clues that the Mormon heirarc hy has ties to the Prieure de Sion and the Merovingians are 1. their belief Mary Magdalene was Christ's wife and that Christ had children and 2. the prominence the bee symbol is given. Bees are used by Dese ret Industries, are the official symbol of Utah, and are used in the Mo rmon temples. Further, the geneologies that the LDS Mormon presidents have published of them selves all trace their lineage back to the Merovingians, Sythians, Sicambri, and Cimmerians, and to Anna a relative of Jesus Christ. (See Appendix.) Another symbol of the Merovingians was Merov ee's birthmark, which was a red cross. The red cross has been prominent symbol of the Knights Templars, and groups with ties to Freemasonry including the modern Red Cross. Th e red cross was an important symbol for Charles T. Russell, who was a Knights Templar and was placed on his Watch To wer magazines and at the IBSA conventions. It appears that the Ru ssell family has ties of some kind to the New World Order. (See appendix.) Hopefully, in the process of studying these first two units the reader ha s come to appreciate the many connections between groups like th e Rosicrucians, Masons, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the various New Age groups. THE YEAR 2000 The period of time designated 2000 on our calender should not hold any intrinsic special significance. It is merely a decision on the part of some of mankind to designate and associate that period of time with the number 2000. In te rms of any Biblical chronology that supposedly God must be following it can't in trinsically have any significance either after the various calender changes, the years of error betw een Christ's death and when the A.D. counting begins etc. Our modern way of accounting days is even different from the Bible which views the evening (from sunset) and the morning (the followi ng period of daylight) as a da y. Yet, many people have been convinced that the year 2000 is something speci al. It is like Kennedy's end-of-the-decade man- on-the-moon belief that America took up so heartedly. \"Those closest to John Paul [II ]... became convinced that, in the wake of the shooting, the pope was motivated, perhaps even obse ssed, by the thought that somethin g dramatically decisive would happen to the world by the year 2000.

U Thant is a Burmese Buddhist who advocates a One-World-Govemment One-World-Religion. 14 To help see his word s come true, Mueller along with some others founded Planetary Citi zens, a group that encourages people worldwide to try to force their nations into a One-World-Government by the year 2000. 15 From every angle of the One-Worl d-Religion come remarkably similar feelings of foreboding concerning the year 2000. 33° Mason President Bu sh, who is to inaugurate the new millenium in with ceremonies at the Great Pyrami d, has been pushing forward his Globalism 2000 curriculum. The Watchtower Society continues to hi nt that the year 2000 is the big year. The Theosophical Society in their book On the Watc htower, p. 351, also tells us that the year 2000 is to be the year to bring in the New Age.

How do these plans compare? How much of thei r plans do we know about? How firm are their plans? There are basically two levels of plans—the esoteric and the e xoteric. The insiders have the real plans, the public is given through various ch annels the plans in sli ghtly altered form. The various groups adjust the esoteric plans to matc h what they can pragmatically give their own audience. The key then is to decide what has been added for the \"benefit \" of some particular audience. For the Jehovah's Witnesses they will be told th at they are the only ones who will be saved when the revolution for the Gold en Age comes. The terminology fo r this has changed to \"the battle of Armaggeddon.\" But in the older WT publ ications both the words revolution and Golden Age have been associated with these events. For the New Ager s they will be promised that every one will become gods. For the Industrialists they will be promised th at a great age of prosperity will arrive from a global economy without any tariff barriers.

There are mutually beneficial system of trade but the globalism rhetoric of the One- Worlders is propoganda. First the globalism is built on principles that are opposite of about every economic principle that the Bible gives us. I tend to believe the Bible's age old wisdom rather than Rockefeller and Kissinger. Can American s really think that becoming one-nation economically with Mexico is going to benefit them? If hordes of poor people destroy what others have cared for like the serfs did in Russia to the belongings of the middle class, and American industry moves to where the peopl e will allow themselves to wo rk for slave wages, will this really benefit Americans? Our l eaders are reducing the American people to a nation of serfs. And comrade I don't care to be a serf if I have a choice, how about you?) In the next pages, plans and stategies of the various groups will be looked at. MASONIC PLANS The best sources of Masonic plans are the plans that were discovered long ago and have been written about for centuries. These include the Bavari an Illuminati plans, the plans that Robison, the Scottish Mason revealed in his expose, and th e Protocols of Sion orig inating from a Mizraim Masonic Lodge. Because these are so well known, and the reader may have alrea dy formed an opinion on these, this chapter will cover other sources. SOURCE A- 33° Manl y P.

SOURCE A- Masonry's greatest philosopher according to the Sc ottish Rite Journal was Manly P. Hall. In Hall's book America's Assignment With Destiny he puts forth hi s belief that Columbus worked with Lorenzo de Medici and an esoteric society related to the Masons to \"discover\" America. What he is attempting to show is that America has alwa ys played a role in esoteric plans, even before its public discovery by Colu mbus. His other book The Secret Destiny of America comes out and states rep eatedly that the Masons have big plans for America and these are to create Plato's Republic, ak a Bacon's New Atlantis in this na tion. Manly P. Hall in his other books repeatedly shows us that Masonry intends a Universal re ligion, that this universal religion will be eclectic like the Hindu re ligion or the New Age movement and will be a continuation of the mysteries."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"Although the specific tactics and other details like the names of modern day people carrying out the Masonic plans are not given, Hall does provide a portrait of the basic framework of what they are up to. SOURCE B- This source gives us the details of a pattern that has repeatedly been used successfully by the Masonic Lodge. One Masonic researcher claims ev ery Masonic inspired revolution (such as Europe's and Latin America's for the last 200 years) has used this. It appears his claim is correct. What is done is to create two movements—one th at promotes Pacifism, the other to promote overzealous nationalism. The Pacifist group a ttacks, enfeebles, and undermines existing authorities of various kinds. This allows the sec ond group to attack those remaining authorities. In all cases it is hard to show a conspiracy between the two apparently different opposing and covertly cooperating groups. Th e cooperation is more visible after the nationalistic group succeeds, because then they pl ace the surviving Pacifistic pa rty into administrative positions. SOURCE C- The Mason Adams writ es that credit can be used to control a. the press, b. international news-agencie s, c. and the book market.

The second group are non-Masonic groups who in some way promote some aspect of the Masonic plan. Descamps describes these, \"Along with this is th e creation of non-Masonic bodies, often secretive, controlled by Masons that are at least partially identi cal with the Freemasons' goals. These groups work for the r ealization of some special asp ect of the overall Masonic plan.\" \"The lodges do not form the complete framework of the army of the Revolution...Under them are numberless popular organizations, circles and associations of a ll kinds, which are nothing else simplified forms of Freemasonry...These reach the classes which Freemasonry cannot admit into the lodges.\" THE NEW AGE MOVEMENTS PLANS Gerald and Patricia Mische w ho were co-sponsors of the orga nization Planetary Initiative for the World We Choose have spe lled out in detail in their book Toward a Human World Order many of the plans for bringing in a One World Religion/Economy/Governme nt. The Paulist Press, a press connected to th e Catholic Church published their book Toward a Human World Order. The Paulist Press is now an instrument of th e New World Order and its scams like Liberation Theology. Another book that spells out the details of the New Age movement's plan is The Externalisation of the Hierarchy by Alice Bailey. Indeed, the book is designed to be a textbook on how The Plan is to unfold. Pages and quotes from this book have already been introduced to the reader in chapters 1.1 and 1.2.

Th is paper gave the goals for the International Coven Council. Among the objectives on that paper were the following: •To bring about personal debts, causing di scord and disharmony within families. •To remove or educate the \"new-age youth\" by: a) infiltrating boys'/girls' clubs and big sister/brother programs. b) infiltrating schools, having prayers remove d, having teachers te ach about drugs, sex, freedoms. c) instigating and promoting rebelli on against parents and all authority. •To have laws changed to benefit our ways, such as: a) removing children from the home environmen t and placing them in our foster homes b) mandatory placement of children in our daycare centers c) open drug and pornography market to everyone. 20 Notes. 1.

From personal experience, I know those out in the tren ches doing spiritual warfa re out of devotion to the Kingdom, have found apathy in the general Christian population. This apathy stems in part due to a total lack of wisdom and knowledge of what is going on. 17.

Alice Bailey's book Externalisation of the Hierarch y is so blatant about spelling out their plans it is somewhat unnerving. Her book is for teaching New Agers about their Plans, so even though it does tell what they are going to do, it describes events in terminology th at would appeal to its readers. Just as the Greeks camoflaged th eir intentions with the Trojan Horse, the New World Order is window dressing their socialist dictatorship to make it appear to be what the public wants. And like the Trojans, Americans are busy pulling the Tr ojan Horse of the New World Order into their fortifications. (Chap. 1.14 is an example of how people's perception of what the New Order is may be quite out of line from what they are really going to get.) PROMISES, PROMISES! Alice Bailey tells us that this Hierarchy of Ru lers wants to bring us \"salvation\", \"spiritual intercourse\" (whatever that is), \"a new world\" (we all like new things), to be led by a \"new group of world servers\" ( great! so me more public servants). 1 (If you are one to have swallowed what some \"C hristian\" authors are telling us that Alice Bailey and Lucis Trust have no significance, ch eck the appendix out and note that members of Lucis Trust have high positions of power.

LEARNED ELDERS OF ZION A clique of about 300 Powerful Jewish men has sw ay over the affairs of the world. This group includes the the Jewish Rockefeller family and the Ro thschild family. The close connections between the House of Da vid and the \"Black\" No bility that has ruled over Europe is a topic for another complete book. We can only touch on the subject. The purported lineage of David is guarded by the Pr ieure de Sion and th e lineage of the Black Nobility by the Knights of Malta . The Grand Master of the Prie ure de Sion (inducted in 1981) stated that his organization contained Knights of the Order of Malta within its ranks. Indeed, the previous Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion Abbe' Francois Ducard-Bourget was also the Magistral Chaplain of the Knights of Malta. 2 Commenting on the two orders which are protecting two different powerful bloodlines The Messianic Legacy says, \"...both Orders could be expected to function in much the same sphere , the twilight underworld where politics, finance, religion and the work of various intelligence ag encies converge. Undoubt edly, too, the Knights of Malta and the Prieure de Sion had certain interests and certa in objectives in common. Both Orders...were apparently intent on the creation of some sort of Un ited States of Europe. And the history of both Orders, assuming th e Prieure's pedigree to be auth entic, would have been closely intertwined. Both claim a her itage back to the Crusades...\" 3 By international law, the Knights of Malta are an independent sovereign nation, a principality, although the U.K. which has the Protestant branch of this order called th e Order of St. John does"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"not recognize the Order of Malta's passports. At least 30 nations do recognize the Order of Malta's passports. 4 Nearly half of the Knights of Malta's 10,000 me mbers belong to Europe 's Black Nobility, that is Europe's oldest and most powerful families. The head of the Black Nobility claims descent from the last Roman emperior. 5 The Knights of Malta are closely allied with the Vatican, the Masons, and the CIA. That the Prieure de Sion (allied with Scottish & Mizraim Rites) and the Knights of Malta are coope rating peacefully with eac h other, considering th at the bloodlines they represent were once in competition means that an alliance between the House of David and the Black Nobility is solidly in plac e. Further, the Askenazim Jewish Banking families such as the Rothschilds have allied th emselves to all this th rough marriage and business. From the historical evidence, this Author be lieves that Mason/Rosi crucian Napoleon, who conquered Malta from the Knights of Malta and the Papal States along with the Pope, was able to realign those powers in some way with Illu minati goals. Freemasonry itself had been already been subverted by the Sanhendrin and the Illumi nati. A Grand Alliance of the various powerful bloodlines, Freemasonry, and the Jewish Sanhedrin occured back in the early 1800s. However, the manipulation of events to cent ralize their power was a gradual process. For instance, the first passports issued by any stat e was done under the Masonic rule of France after the French Revolution. Yet, it wasn't until af ter W.W.I, that the One-World- Power could justify restricting the free travel of the nations with passport requirements. 6 THE BILDERBERGERS The alliance of the great powers can be seen in the meetings of the Bilderbergers. This group consists of leaders from the Black Nobility, th e Jewish Banking families, the Freemasons, and the Internationalists. The real po wer of the Bilderbergers recides in the Inner Core, which consists of 3 groups of 13 for a total of 39. This Inner Core then answer to the Polic y Committee which consists of 13. The Policy Committee answers to a Round Table of 9. WILLIAM OF ORANGE'S FAMILY One of the most po werful men within the Bilderbergers is Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. He still retains influence, even after giving up the chairmanship . His family, the Hapsburgs, are descendents of some powerful blood lines, including the Hous e of Orange and the Roman Emperors. Prince Bernhard was the first chairman of the Bilderbergers. He is the husband of the Queen of the Netherlands, who abdicated in favor of her daughter. Prince Bernhard's wife Queen Julianna has been estimated to be worth around $2 billion dollars. 7 She holds stock in Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon. She holds the masonic title of \"Protectress of the Craft [Freemasonry]\". She and the Prince have pl ayed an active role in Freemasonry. In 1957, for instance, she received the Grand Masters attending an international conf erence at the Hague. Prince Philip of Orange gave the Grand Lodge's buildi ng while he was Grand Master, and also donated 7,000 books to its library. 7a The Orange family have been im portant in Freemasonry over the years. The Bilderberger meetings are secret, but severa l investigators, especially one has been able to get information each year on the ongoings. From the tidbits that come out of what happens, it is evident that decisions made at the Bilderbe rger meetings soon translate into official policy of the nations around the world. Some of the men in 1966, that attended the Bilderberger's meeting were Henry Kissinger, Palme of Sweden, Bieusheuval of The Netherlands, Gerald Ford of the United States; Helmut"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"Schmidt of West Germany; Rumor of Italy, and Giscard d' Estaing of France (d'Estaing was at the 1968 meeting bu t not at the 1966.) 8 The high ranking Mason Gerald Ford (originally named Leslie King) had attended the 196 2, 1964, 1965, 1966, and 1970 Bilderberger meetings. The significance of these men being delegates in 1966 mi ght at first glance el ude the reader today, because they have since been chief-executives or in top leve l government positions. However, the significance is that these men in 1966 were relatively unknowns. With in eight years these Bilderbergers had become prominent. ONE ITEM TO SHOW THE BILDERBERGER 'S POWER-THEIR DESTRUCTION OF A PRESIDENT This raises the question, didn't Gerald Ford just happen to become President? William Still, who has recently written the book New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies, became interested in the subject that his and this book concern wh en his father Lt. Col. William L. Still, was approached by so meone who asked his father how he would feel if there was a military takeover of the U.S. g overnment and implicating that Ni xon wanted to take over. The day was about October 15, 1973. Nixon was in trouble with Wate rgate. Still's father wrote a memorandum warning that a military coup was being planned to put Nixon into office for a third term by any means. William Still re searched that mysterious coup that never happened, and as a result became aware that things are in serious trouble for this nation, as we approach the slavery of the New World Order. William Still writes, \"I hope the publication of this book will stimulate the release of new data...\" If William Still is reading this book, I would like to give him new data and fill him in on what happened. But this will not be the story he expected. In dealing with operations do ne by the CIA and intelligence agen cies, one is dealing with a world of lies and counterlies. There are so many laye rs of lies that the trut h is difficult to unbury, but once it is, the lies often fall apart. \"The man who must depend upon research and investigation inevitably falls vic tim to the many pitfalls of the secret world and of the cover world with its lies and counterlies.\"—Contact officer between the CIA and the DOD (Dept. of Defense) from 1955 to Dec. 1963. Many of the Army, Navy, and Airfo rce leadership are CIA assets. 9 Many of the people in the U.S. Government are CIA assets. The CIA has spent many years and much money to get their CIA assets into all the vari ous areas of the government. 10 The CIA is adept at leaking or creating false stories that have all the ea rmarks of being true. In his b ook Prouty debunks the \"Pentagon Papers\". The Pentagon Pa pers appeared to be an expose of the U.S. government. Actually, they were manufactured by the CIA and were simply fi ction. What Lt. Gen. Still had \"leaked\" to him was a carefully orchestrated smokescreen, a dive rsion. By having their CIA assets in the government start the rumors going around that Nixon was going to creat e a dictatorship by a military coup, they allowed their military coup to go undetected. Their ta ke-over actions almost looked like a response to Nixon's supposed coup. It was brilliant. To further cover their tracks several misleading books have be en published subsequently that are written by participants of those days. The following events took place.(You can believe this or not—it is pres ented simply as an example of how powerful the Bild erburgers are, that they make and toss away Presidents. To conserve space this section will not go into why they wanted to elect Nixon and then toss him. If you are interested, others are also capable of telling you why.)"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"BASIC U.S. POLICY PROCESS Chart by Fritz Springmeier "},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"DOCUMENTATION WITH EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING MJ-12 My own secret sources of information indicate two items: a. that the highest levels of Satanism, comm only known as the Illumina ti, control the CFR and other top-level decision making groups in the U.S. government. b. that the highest levels of Satanism have on- going direct contact with the aliens (actually demons) and work with them. c. that a group of men commonly known as Majest y 12 or MJ-12 does indeed exist, and they direct the United States, and are aware of ongoing wo rk with the \"aliens\". From this limited confidential info rmation, I have proceeded to try to gleen more information to pad out my picture and hopefu lly the reader's too of what is happening. Further information on MJ-12 has come from a number of sources. The following documents pertaining to MJ-12 are included for the reader. DOCUMENT 1. Federal Register pages which are called \"Pre sidential Findings\" and are available to House and Senate Intelligence Committees. The firs t set of pages are Executive Order 10700 by President Eisenhower, Further Providing for the Operations Coordinating Board, February 27, 1957. The story behind these Federal Reg ister pages are as follows: Ne lson Rockefeller, member of the Illuminati, and Dwight Eise nhower began planning in 1953 fo r the creation of a secret governing committee from 13 to 19 men to rule the United States in cooperation with the aliens (demons). Some type of authority had to be gi ven the group from the ex ecutive branch and some type of cover had to be gi ven it also. The secr et Executive Memoran dum NSC 5510 set up a permanent Majority 12 committee. Soon afterw ards in Mar. 1955, NS C 5412/1 set up the cover story-a group which had Nelson Rockefeller at its top. The cover group was entitled \"the Policy Coordinating Group.\" As the PCG or Policy Coor dinating Group actually was a front for a real group that did and still does rule the United States, people in government correctly realized its enormous power and have refered to this secret ruling body in different ways over the years. In 1974 Thomas Ross and and David Wise came out with the book The Invisible Government by Random House. Because this book revealed th is group which was called \"the Special Group\" or \"54/12\" the name of the group was changed. Marchetti pointed out in his book CIA and The Cult of Intelligence that the Speci al Group changes its name each ti me its cover name is revealed to the public. The following are some of the names it has gone by: a. Special Study Group b. Wise Men c.

At other times a Majesty 12's orders have been called Majority 12 Directives. Intelligence people with Q clear ance and Presidential approval we re classified \"MAJESTIC\" on Project REDLIGHT. Extremely sens itive material is classified MAJIC. It appears from the numerous sources that the secret MJ-12 governing group uses MJ in connection with the words MAJIC, MAJORITY, and MAJESTIC. FALSE DOCUMENT. The pages of what is called the \"Briefing Document: Operation Majestic 12 Prepared For President-Elect Dwight D. Ei senhower\" are a CIA/NSC attempt to muddy the waters with a fake document. B ecause the public began to learn some real facts about MJ-12, a special operation called MAJESTIC to decieve th e public was carr ied out by three intelligence men, Stanton Friedman, William Moore, and Jaime Shandera. Su pposedly Jaime Shandera got some 35mm film and realized wh at he had after he developed it. It was labelled a briefing document for President-elect Eisenhower concerning MJ-12. The document has big errors in it, the dating is not written as per how it was done then, the Rosewell Army Air Field and Walker Air Force Base are misnamed Ro sewell Army Air Base and Walker Field. The dating and the name of the base would have ha d to have been done correctly under real circumstances. Much information has come out exposing these three me n who claim to have come upon this document as intelligence men. They an d others have been activel y trying to muddy the waters. Although a Study Group had been established even four years before the MJ-12 Study Group it appears it wasn't as all encomp assing as the one established by Rockefeller in 1 954. This prior Study Group (called ECG- Execu tive Coordination Group) can be identified in the National Security Council direc tive identifiable as the top secret annex to NSC-4 called NSC-4A. Later NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2 superseded NSC-4 and NSC-4A and expa nded the work of the Study Group. It appears the ECG was somewhat ad hoc, and that the people making up the group varied from meeting to meeting, and problem to problem, whereas MJ-12 is a fixed group. After Pres. John Kennedy trie d to abolish MJ-12 as the control center, the Study Gr oup retained its power but became acephalous. When the men of MJ-12 (the 54 12 committee) began meeting, it was neccessary that extreme secrecy be established for it is hard to hide so many important men getting together. In 1954, the Quantico Marine Base was used. Later meetings were held at the Marine Base at Quantico, VA"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"and the group became known as Quantico II according to William Cooper. Rockefeller built a retreat somewhere in Maryland th at can only be reached by air. Then the Group was able to fly in and maintain the seclusion they desired. The retreat's code name is \"the Country Club\" and it has complete living, eating, recreation, lib rary and meeting fac ilities according to William Cooper. Money for the Study Group was ma de available through a multimill ion dollar secret fund kept by the Military Office of the White House. So me money was periodically transferred from this fund to the Kennedy family up until 1967. The Kennedy family is one of the 13 leading Illuminati families. It is not known why this m oney was being transferre d secretly by courier. Finally, if we look at who serves on MJ-12 ther e are basically three gro ups.

Six men of the Executive Committee of th e CFR which are all members of the Masonic Order of the Quest and members of the Jason Society (not to be confused with the Jason Group).

If he accepts the plan or if I accept hi s views and we therefore present to the President a unanimous positi on, it is so stated. If, on the other hand, his views differ from mine and I do not accept his views, I don't try to find a common denominator but rather I pre- sent to the President my recommendations and state that Mr. Rusk holds contrary views and they are these. The specific approach depends on the matter at hand. In certain instances, Mr. Rusk or I will call a group together, present a pro- posal, obtain their views, modify the initial proposal in relation to those views, come to an agreement in our own minds as to the course of action to be followe d, and then put the matter under discussion in writing. Alternatively, if the matter is more complex and requires more study, we may assign the task to one of our subordinates and ask that the other department particip ate formally in the discussion by assigning an individual to work with our subordinate—in effect, setting up a small task force which studies the matter, presents in writing to Mr. Rusk and to me their recommendations, which we then either accept, reject, or modify.

They are a very useful, effective way of approaching a complicated problem and insuring that people with a variety of interests and points of view and experience bring to bear their experience upon that problem and upon its solution. They are effective if they are prope rly directed, if they operate as a working group with a director and a responsible leader. They are not effective if they turn into a leaderless committee-type organiza- tion. Some of them do, in which case they prove to be worthless. S ENATOR J ACKSON .

Richard Nixon was put into office by the New Worl d Order because they wa nted him in office in 1968, they did not want him in office in 1973-1974. 12 (Nixon had been told that rather than 1960 he could be President in 1968 which he preferred knowin g their plans for 1975-76.)

This manual spells out in detail their strategy to control the masses of people. This manual is usually quite technical. The ma nual is not intentionally deroga tory toward the common person in order to insult him, because it was not inte nded that the common people would ever lay eyes upon the manual.

The Hebrew acronym Akum in the Talmud (m ade up from the words Obhde Kokhabkim U Mazzaloth) is applied especially in Schulkhan Ar ukh to mean Christians. For instance, the word is applied to Christians in Orach Chai im (113,8), and Iore Dea (148, 5, 12). In Kerithuth (6b p.78) it says in the Talmud: \"The teachings of the Rabbis is: He who pours oil over a Goi [gentile], and over dead bodies is freed from punishment. This is true for an animal because it is not a man. But how can it be said that by pouring oil over a Goi one is freed from punishment, since a Goi is also a man? But this is not true , for it is written: Ye are my flock, the flock of my pasture are men (Ezechiel, 24, 31) You are thus called men, but the Goim are not called men.\" In Tract Makkoth (7b) one is not guilty of an ac cidental murder when trying to kill a Goi. A man is innocent of murder, \"...if intending to ki ll an animal he kills a man by mistake, or intending to kill a Goi, he kills an Israelite.\" In the Midrasch Talpioth (fol. 225d) and Orach Chaiim, 57,6a the Akum (the Christians) are said to differ only in form from beasts. The gentiles are called \"cow and ass\" in Zohar, II, (64b). Rabbi Edels in his comments on Kethuboth (110b) states: \"The Psalmist compares the Akum to the unclean beast in the woods.\" The gentiles propogate like beasts. \"The sexual intercourse of a Goi is like to that of a beast.\"- -Sanhedrin (74b) Tosephoth. Because the gentiles are beasts the Talmud repeated ly says they are not capable of contracting marriages. See Kidduschim (68a), Eben Haezer (44,8), Zohar (II, 64b). Because Christians are so terrible, the Talmudic Jews are commanded not even to do anything good to Christians. \"Those who do good to the Akum...will not rise from the dead.\" Zohar (1,25b). The reader gets the picture. The Talmud has very little positive to say about the gentiles. What throws off Gentile readers of th e portions of the Talmud that are available for him to read, are that the Talmud has some lofty principles—the catc h is that they are meant only for other men— and the Talmud is emphatically clear Gentiles ar e animals, and according to the Talmud these \"animals\" can not be sinned against. It is clear to this Author from studying the Rothschilds that they certainly have this view of the gentiles, and they have been nursing a hatred of gentile beasts for generations. (See chapter 3.3) This Author can't say exac tly what che Rockefellers' views are. They are also Jewish, (for instance one newspaper talk ed about the Rock efellers going to their daug hter's Bat Mitzvah.) The Rockefellers have at ti mes said things that indicate they don't think much of the common person. This Author suspects that if the powerful Jewish Bankers have made a lliances with any Goyim in order to rule the world—the powe rful Goyim are going to be double-crossed.

ON AND ON AND ON I have read in their own ma terial all their well thought out incentives. They prefer not to tell us the bottom line, the fine print that means a NEW WORLD SLAVE STATE. They prefer not to tell you how they have carefully thou ght out how to cause many of the problems that they use to demand to limit our freedom in order to save us. When one reads the detailed studies these people ha ve done on what they are doing and plan to do, it blows one's mind. They have many of the best minds in this country massaging their ideas, and researching and testing them. The public has no comprehensio n how carefully thought out and detailed their plans are. Further they have se t up organizations to perpetuate their power and plans to world domination over as long a period as it takes. They ar e in this for the long haul. It is designed that way.

THE SECOND TOWER OF BABEL At times it seems that those bringing in a Ne w World Order releece in the being identified with the first Tower of Babel. Th e official poster of the Council of Europe, which represent the EC, portrays the EC as the To wer of Babel unde r construction. 16 Twelve pentagrams (this Council of EC likes to use pentagrams often ups ide down) representing the 12 nations of the new United Europe are above th e poster's Tower of Babel. 17 This has been picked up by various magazines. Da ve Hunt reports that a special insert in the European Edition of the Wall Street Journal fo r the second quarter of 1990 carried an IBM ad showing the new United Europe as a Tower of Babel under construction. 18 In 1723, a poem was written in London entitle d \"The Freemasons; a Hudibrastic Poem. A couplet of it ran: \"If history be not ancient fable Free Masons came from the Tower of Babel.\" 18a If you have been helping build this Tower of Babe l, and have read this far, I encourage you in the name of Jesus Christ your Savior, to lay aside your Masonic s quare and level, your Masonic plumb line, your trowel, your masonic ma llet and chisel, your Masonic rules and lines and pick up the Word of God and free yourself of these great pillars that support a great new Tower of Babel dedicated to the religi ous enslavement of mankind.

JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES The Masonic goal was to get prayer, the pledge of allegiance, and religious trappings out of the public schools. In 1939, the composition of who sat on the Supreme Court was changing. The next few years would see many new appointees . The Mason F.D. Roosevelt was appointing Masons to the Supreme Court. When the Jehovah' s Witnesses began taking cases to the Supreme Court in the late 30's and early 40's many of the Mason Supreme Court Justices were Masons. In order of their appointments, the following Masons were serving on the Supreme Court when the Jehovah's Witnesses began winning court cases: Hugo L. Black (Mason) 1937-71 Stanley F. Reed (Mason) 1938-57 Felix Frankfurter (Jew with B'nai B'rith) 193 9-1962 (while Jewish supreme court justice Louis D. Brandeis en ded his term in '39) William O. Douglas (Mason) 1939-1975 James F. Byrnes (Mason) 1941-42 Robert H. Jackson (Mason) 1941-54 Wiley B. Rutledge (Mason) 1943-49 This author has been told by one Mason how closely he watched each of these Jehovah's Witness Supreme Court cases. This Author's theory is that the Jehovah's Witnesses were serving as the foot soldiers for the Masonic hierarchy' s ambitions. Most of the Supreme Court cases of significance during this period involved the Jeho vah's Witnesses. By 1955 they had won 40 Supreme Court victories. 21a An example of how the JWs repeat edly won is May 3, 1943 when the Supreme Court decided 12 out of 13 cases in their favor. 21b Roosevelt's Attorney General Fracis Biddee was very liberal toward th e Jehovah's Witnesses. 21c . Rolf Svensson, researching at Shiloah, found ou t that their legal library had 20 large shelves filled with legal literature involving th e Jehovah's Witnesses. 22 The Jehovah's Witnesses were instrumental in getting the vestiges of Christianity and acts of nationalism taken out of a number of countries' schools. On June 14, 1943 the Supreme Court decided in West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette that Witness children could not be expelled from pub lic schools for refusing to salute the U.S. flag. 22a Although the Jehovah's Witnesses are out in the trenches winning battles against Christendom and Nationalism for the Masons, it appears that they are considered expenda ble. In contrast to the Mormons who are advised to get the best educa tion, and to have large families, the Jehovah's Witnesses are advised not to get good educations 23 and to consider not having children. 24 The"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"Mormons have an aggressive door -to-door campaign also, so it is not necessary to throw away the potential of the Jehovah's Witness youth, and to deny the JWs the privilege of enjoying family life, just to have an aggressive door-to-door campaign. The WT Society has chosen the dates 1914, 192 5, 1975, 2000 as the da tes for Armaggedon. This is interesting. The Masons had big plans for 1914, the creation of WW I, the Prieure de Sion wanted to put one of the Black Nobility in power over a Unite d Europe in 1914, but someone changed their plans. The Theosophical Society wanted to intr oduce the New Messiah in 1925-26 but that plan collapsed in embarrassm ent. The New World Order wanted to bring in their rule by 1976, and it was al so announced far in advance that the New Age Subversive organizations announced they would do their work in the open after the key year of 1975. Things happened but not as big as they had planned and they put off many things. Finally now, the New Agers, the Masons and others are pointing to th e year 2,000 for the star t of the New Age, and so is the WT Society. An example of numerous low key statements coming out of the Society is this quote from Awake! Nov. 8, 1986, pp. 7-8, \"For the year 2000, I visualize a world transformed into a beautiful paradise! But I don't think that either the present world or its rulers will live to see that day....We are living in the last days of the system of things.\" WT -LDS LEADERSHIP COOPERATION Although confidential sources reveal that there is cooperation between the LDS top church leaders and the WT Society, it is very di fficult to see any cooper ation publicly. It would be nice in a way to be able to say on such a nd such a day Pres. So-and- so called Pres. So-and- so and here is the transcript of the discussion. Further, there is the difficulty that publicly the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are enemie s, which totally obscures the cooperation. We could expect a no-holds religious conflic t going on between such zealous proselytizing groups. Several items are hints of what is going on at the top behind the scenes. Hints: item 1. Jehovah's Witnesses ha ve been given so little and such poor quality anti-Mormon material from headquarters that a typewritten manuscript of a bout 10 pages written by a JW not in the WT hierarchy has been ci rculating among the JW congregati ons in the Western States. It is rare that local JWs will dare write anything religious, that role is reserved for the WT Society. This Author has personally examined this JW Anti-Mormon paper. It is superficial and simplistic. That the JWs have to resort to it, underlies how little importa nce WT headquarters in Brooklyn, NY have placed in converting Mormondom. item 2. C.T. Russell had a genial attitude toward Mormons. When the WT Society's founder C.T. Russell stopped at Salt Lake City , UT he went to the Mormon Tabernacle for a service. His reaction to Utah, \"It is our opinion that Mormons are as honest as others—more honest than many.\" The tenor of his brief stay could hardly be labelled an tagonistic.(WT Aug. 1, 1911, pp. 229-230 ; WTR p. 4861) item. 3. The WT Society speaks of a restoration of all true doctrine in the WT 8/15/1971 p. 503. The concept that there was a m odern day restoration of true doctrine parallels Mormonism."},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"From these three little hints we could gather that the WT lead ership is not as antagonistic toward Mormonism as we would expect, and that they both even share some common religious ideas. THE MORMONS The world's largest computer is owned by the Mormons and has been placed in an underground facility ready to withstand even a nuclear war. And what is this computer used for? It stores all the family history information of the world. Although there certainly are gaps in the histor ical records, the Mormon church has done about as good a job as possible. They have gone to ev ery country in the world and photographed every conceivable genealogical record they can find. The Tract Sacred Temples of th e Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints put out by the Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesu s Christ of Latter-Day Saints states, \"But there are uncounted millions who have walked the eart h and who have never had the opportunity to hear the gospel. Shall they be denied blessings that are offered in the temples of the Church? Through living proxies who stand in behalf of th e dead, the same ordina nces available to the living are made available to those who have passed from mortality....This vicarious work constitutes an unprecedented labor of love on the pa rt of the living in behalf of the dead. It makes necessary a vast undertaki ng of genealogical research to find and identify those who have gone before. To assist in this research, the Church coordinates a genealogical program and maintains research facilities unma tched in all the world....This program...has been utilized by various nations as a safeguard of their own records.\" 24a The Mormon people are told their chief religious du ty is to do their own families' genealogical charts. The Mormons also secretly have staffs of Mormon genealogists doing charts of people in general who are not their own relatives. This secret program is called the \"Named Extration Records Program\". 24b The Mormons also get the public sc hools involved. Because the amount of work processing the world's genealogical record s is so immense the Mormon Church is quietly getting High School classes to help with the wo rk. Public High School typing classes are being given records to type out as assignments. A lthough the Mormon people have been told this genealogical material is needed to baptize the dead, it is actually being compiled for Big Brother to control us when the New Order comes. The Mormon church has spent billions of dollars on this project, and the Mormon people have b een conned into spending untold millions upon millions of hours of volunteer work to get all these records in order. The LDS Mormon Church in Utah is the relig ion of Masonry under an other name. The RLDS church may be infiltrated with Masons, but it is not the religion of Masonry. That is why the Power has favored the LDS church over the RLDS church, and in part why the Reorganized church even though it has always had a more legitimate claim to authority and a more practical theology has never thrived. The Mormon temples are really just Masonic temples, and if their plans develop far enough we may live to see that fact openly declared. Its interesting that the LDS church was in favor of the RLDS's firs t Temple, the one built in Independence, MO. The Mormon church is being gear ed for survival. They are well prepared. It's long been this Author's opinion that in case of nuclear war, the religion that will prevail in the United States after the war will be Mormonism. Why? Mormons ar e prepared to survive, and there are many Mormons in the government, CI A, FBI who will be earmarked fo r special government shelters."},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"This Author has been in an underground gove rnment city, built to protect government people in case of a nuclear war. It's scary, the government has bu ilt itself multitudes of expensive shelters (some secret), and the people of the U.S. have been left basically to fend for themselves. Is that what it means to have a government \"for the people\"? CHURCH UNIVERSAL & TRIUMPHANT This new-age church is there to recruit those who do get concerned with the kind of information that you are reading in this book. It then siphons off the public's response against the System into this little cult. The church owns 33,000 acres in Park County just north of Yello wstone Park. On this land they have built an underground shelter capable of handling 756 people, and 45 smaller shelters capable of handling another 100 people. There are 3,000 of th e church in that area, so mathematically they appear to be short of space. The main shelter consis ts of 6 interconnected 14' x 200' living areas. Trucks of weapons and ammunition were being delivered daily, according to county official s interviewed in Mar. 1990. 25 C.U.T. member Mike Derkers interviewed duri ng the construction of one of the nuclear bomb shelters stated, \"We may seem pa ranoid, especially with all the changes in Eastern Europe, but its pretty obvious that those changes are part of a hugh KGB smokescreen.\" 26 THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH The Roman Catholic Church has provided much of the framework and manpower, etc. for the creation of a One-World-Religion. The Catholic church has been the major power behind the ecumenical movement, which has taken the Chri stian churches away from their doctrinal foundations. The Catholic Church has provide d all kinds of help for the CI A. It was Catholic money which made Solidarity in Poland, which was their planne d instrument to cause the \"Iron curtain\" to appear to dissolve. (Socialist governments are still intact in all the East ern European communist countries, and leading communists still are in key positions.) The key Bilderbergers have veto power over who becomes the P ope. What is important about the Catholic church is its power and size. It is available for a wide range of scenarios, because of that power. Some literature today pushes the idea that the Catholic church is the mastermind behind all these forces. Could it be the th e Rothschilds, the Communists, the CIA are working for the Catholic church? When one becomes aware of de tails such as how much more powerful the Rothschilds are than the Vatican , of how the Masons had troubl e controlling Pope John Paul I and had to murder him, and how Prince Bernhard of the Black N obility has veto power over who is elected Pope—these type of things show that the Catholic church is being controlled by an outside force more powerfu l than itself. The Catholic church is in alliance with these forces now, and most certainly is playing a big role in their plans. As with all of th ese groups there are three levels so-to-speak of participation. 1. conscious participation 2. bought into the philosophy, but unaware of the final end. Someone once said, they are fools living by their folly. That is not the wording this Author would use, but it does express the idea that they are wrapped up with their vain philosophies. 3. influenced by the Zeitgeist of it, people in the social framework going with the flow."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"JEWISH GROUPS The Media (long controlled by Jewry) has so conditioned almost everyone, that I seriously wonder if it is of any value to attempt to und eceive people—even though I realize the facts are on my side. I could also quote people who were tops in their fields of expertise who can verify various things—but they typically have lost thei r jobs and have been ignored and are parriahs by Society for simply telling the truth. A historical view of things is essential to understand where the non-Christian Jewish groups are coming from. Of any group of people, history is very important to th e Jewish people. They still remember that day sometime in the late 14th or early 13th century B.C. when the angel passed over their first-born. 33 centu ries and they haven't forgotten. The concept of a Messiah is bound up in the trad itions of the Jews like no other group. The Encyclopedia Judaica, p. 1416, in the art. \"Messiah\" explains that the Messiah is to be of the House of David, reign in Jerusa lem, rebuild the Temple, and rein stitute the Temple sacrifices. This is the official position of the state of Israel. Let us use a parable to discuss what has hist orically happened. Ther e was a bride, but she found that she couldn't be faithful. Occasionally she came back to her good husband, but being debauched she was unappreci ative of him, and had trouble seeing his worth. Besides there were just too many attractive men around. She was so wrapped up in her adultery and debauchery for so long, that when her husband came to help he r out of her problems, she didn't even recognize her husband. She called the police and lied to them to destroy th is man. She thought she had destroyed him through the police (but actually hadn 't). As a divorced woman, who had gotten rid of her man, she sought to replace her sugar-d addy. A new husband would remove her reproach of being a whorer. But she wants a husband that wi ll be strong, one who is attractive and worthy of her worship, but lets her have her own way in everything. So far no groom has been able to met such a demand. The new man will have to hate her first hus band with a passion like she does. Now the bride in the story is the Jewish nation. The good husband was the Lord. The new husband that she seeks for is the man of perditio n that the Jews will worship, who will replace Christ the divorced husband. Christ, who was Me ssiah, tells the Jews \"I have come in My Father's name, and you do not re ceive Me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive. \"Jn 5:43 Simon the Magician was one of the false messiahs that arose, and interestingly Simon the Magician has some ties with those in Power today. But al though Simon and many others—one author lists 25 false messiahs believed in by the Jews in the time period just after Christ Jesus 26a have come—none of those early false messi ahs ever received much of a following. For the last few hundred years, th e Hassidic leaders have been cons idered to be Messiahs by their followers. The Reformed Jews are now preaching that the Jews themselves are the Messiah— they can save themselves, and so this philosophy lends itself comfortably with the way they are gaining a monopoly of power over the world. The Jews that examine the Talmud and Zohar see in these authorities the declarations that the gentile and Christian nations will be destroyed in orde r for the Messiah to reign. 27 Whether one believes in those passages of New Testament that speak of an Anti-Christ (cf. Rev 11:7; Rev 12 & 13; 2 Thes 2: 3,8) or not, it is possible to acce pt that certain elements of Judaism are strongly committed to a new messiah, and to boot a messiah that will be anti-christian. Thus we can recognize historically that the mission of Juda ism is the dreadful mission of establishing the House of David as the world's King/Priest Theocratic dictator."},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"This is the House of Solom on that the Masonic Lodge has hoped to rebuild.

He felt his apocalyptic vision for mankind could be turned ar ound if society would adopt his plans for a Utopia run by a benevolent dictatorship. This benevolent dictatorship would largely rule through a public-spirited quasi- religious order of techni cians who would \"pand er to all your worst instincts.\"1 He refers to them as \"an elite of intelligent religious-minded people.\"2 However,religious in what way? A New Religion based on Eastern mysticism . This \"new religion\" ... would sweep away old institutions and usher in a new world order that would save the human race. \"The conspiracy of modern religion against the established institutions of the world must be an open conspiracy...\" H.G. Wells saw the religion of the New Order as a less-secret form of Freemasonry. The video \"Thi ngs to Come\" made from the film based on his book The Shape of Things to Come is available for viewing from larger video stores. In the movie, a reference is made to \"the science of Freemasonry.\" Intelligent, often wealthy men who constituted a scientifically trained functional class with a global view would rule as a service-elite. (Where have you heard we are moving toward a service economy before?) Wells describes this, \"In its more developed phases I seem to see the new republic as...a sort of outspoken secret society, with which even the prominent men of the ostensible state may be openly affiliated....The new republicans will constitute an informal and open freemasonry.\" No wonder the Freemasons hail him as their prophet. Wells called this Mas onic rulership \"a cult of the world state\" in The Salvaging of Civilization (1 921) who would direct education and mass media propoganda.(See pp. 37-41) This group is similar to Plato's Guardian e'lite corps in Plato's Utopia. In a Fortnightly Review article in 1897, H.G. Wells challenged the intellectuals and teachers who control the appartus of moral suggestion to UNITE and PROPOGATE a NEW WORLD FAITH, in the same year, he published \"A stor y of the Days to Come\" in which his Open Conspiracy was even more plainly foreshadowed. \"...if religion is to de velop unifying and di rective power...it must adapt itself...Man's soul is...part of a greater being which lived before he was born and will survive him. The idea of a survival of the definite individual...dissolves to nothing in this new view of immortality.\" Well's mentor was T.H. Huxley, who was Darwin's good friend. Not only was Wells an amusing talker with ideas, he had a real gift for thinking up and writing his plans for a New World Order in a way that people could enjoy rea ding them. His e conomic plans are highly regarded by the One-World-Conspiracy. A BRIEF LOOK AT WELL'S PLANS"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"In Well's The Shape of Things to Come, p. 248 he envisioned a world run by Technologists (experts). Money would be done away with, and the medium of exchange would become \"t he unit of energy.\" In A Modern Utopia, in his chapter on Utopian Economics, he envisions a world language and the world-wide freedom of sale and purchase. He writes, \"book-keeping will naturally be done most conveniently in units of physical energy....Accounts between central and local governments could be kept in these terms. Moreover, one may imagine Utopian local authorities making contracts in which payment would be no longer in coinage upon the gold basis, but in notes good for so many thousands or millions of units of energy at one or other of the generating stations.\"(p.83) H.G. Wells doubted that a thoroughly communistic Utopia could survive,(p.91) but a socialistic one that allowed individuality and individual initiative would. The new Utopia needs to provide for initiatiative.(pp. 92-3) Further, he writes in A Modern Utopia, \"The World State in this ideal presents itse lf as the sole landowner of the earth. (p.93) It will lease land to companies and individuals.(p. 100) The State is to take most of a man's inheritance. Wells states in The New World Order \"For in the world now all roads lead to socialism or social dissolution.\" In the Open Conspiracy H.G. Wells (p. 89-91) warns of the problem racial discrimination will bring to a One-World-State. Further on page 133 he writes \"...Big Business must carry Big Business into the Open Conspiracy...\" Back on page 30 he advises, \"Religion, modern and disillusioned, has for its outward task to set i tself to the control and direction of political, social and economic life, or admit itself a mere drug for easing discomfort....What are the necessary opening stages in the synthesis of that effort...?\" \"What we work toward is synthesis, and this communal effort is the adventure of humanity.\" 3 SETTING RELIGION \"TO THE CONTROL AND DIRECTION\" OF THE POWER In Well's non-fictional works he repeatedly declares that everyday reality is the only reality we can know, and that our ideas about it are only approximations to the truth. 4 In the very opening address, when the Federal Council of Churches of Christ was formed Bishop Francis J. McConnell was exactly in line with H.G. Well's definition of truth. \"In the next place, the work of the federated movement of the churches is bringing a very remarkable intellectual gain. There is a certain kind of mocking question as ked the church, \"What is truth?\" The Presbyterian Church say it is one thing, the Congregational another, the Episcopalian another and the Methodist another. We are coming to see very clearly in these days that we cannot define truth in abstract terms. We are coming to see, from the Christian standpoint, that truth is living. That is the absolute end in itself; everything else is instrumental.\" 5 The Open Conspiracy with their foundations, their W.C.C., and their handpicked people running many religious institutions have set into place the controls to move religion where they want."},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"An example of this is the Ford Foundations bankrolling of the Interreligious Peace Colloquim ( later renamed Muslim Jewish Christian Conference) \"founded in 1976 to bring together representatives of the world's major faiths to discuss world economic and political issues.\" (The Search For a New Economic Order, p.19) Two books resulted from these conferences World Faiths and the New World Order edited by Joseph Gremillion and William Ryan, and Food Energy a nd the Major Faiths by Joseph Grenillion. McGeorge Bundy of the Skull and Bones Order happened to the President of the Ford Foundation when all this occured. The world's religious leaders are getting involved in the economic aspects of the New World Order. It all sounds so benign. The parasite that has invested the world and is living off its prod uctivity is very well camouflaged. This parasite of the superpowerful, may use H.G. Well's principles and plan, but they will reserve for themselv es special power and privileges. They will abolish most inheritance like H.G. Wells suggested for the common people; (Well's had some exceptions he thought were worthwhile), yet somehow will secretly have loop-holes for themselves. The pattern can a lready be seen. (By the way the concept of inheritance is a Godly principle established for Biblical Israel, so that people co uld care and provide for their children.) Even Wells doesn't hide the fact that most of his suggested rulership will be same ones ruling today. In Clissold, the character William Clissold, of \"Romer, Steinhart, and Crest\"-- a giant metallurgical c oncern modeled after anot her large corporation in his book After Democ racy-- belonged to th e Industrialists that H.G. Wells always considered good material for the New Order's leadership. Romer, Steinhart, and C rest were internati onal, and by- passed governments to establish a new eco nomic order, which would provide the founda tion for political and so cial world order. This firm had countless manufacturing concerns running over national boundaries, and connectio ns to international b anking houses, and to many local industries for raw materials, machinery, skilled labor, capital, and markets. Clissold calls for an Open Conspira cy which \"...is not a project to overthrow exis ting governments by insurrectionary attacks, but to supersede them by disregard....to make them neglible by replacing their functions.\" An article by Wells two year later published in The Banker gives the international ban kers a big part in the Open Conspiracy. This was extraordinary that The Banker would print such a revolutionary article, but the truth is that H.G. Wells had Banker friends within the International Banking system. When we stop and think about it, what we are getting in the New World Order are the same International Bankers, the same Political leaders, the same Capitalists that have ruled us before. And by their own literature, one can read how poorly they have done for us. They have given us frequent economic distr ess, something in the neighborhood of 14,531 wars in the last 5,600 years of history, (with only 10 meagre years of true world peace). The difference seems to be like the Jehovah's Witnesses description of what happened when Christ became K ing in 1914. The"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"only thing that happened is that he changed chairs, changed one throne for another. If we consider their idea that Christ is a collective rulership the parallels increase. The difference betwee n now and the fut ure New Order is that they will openly be labeled an International rulership. They have been acting internationally for years. This is why Roosevelt gave Eastern Europe to Stalin at Yalta. So all they plan is a change of thrones, and to gain some more direc t power. I can s ee how the same greedy, selfish, infallible powerful men are going to become the god-men H.G. Wells thought could save the world, I fail to see how they can really bring salvation. We are being fed a rehash of what ancient Babylon had, which was by the way the a ncient origin of and center of International Banking. POWER Again and again, power resurfaces as a primary motivation of those in control. Each of us enjoys the power to control events in our life--such as the ability to sleep, eat, or rest when we want. Each of us enjoys the power to take medicene to take care of what ails us. The beings that control us are power crazy. This is not my opinion alone, but the opinion of a Christian who happened by some holy accident to find himself rubbing shoulders with the elite. They have planned for a long time how to bring in a cashless society. The country of Singapore is a test case to lead the way for the rest of the world. Singapore has made money illegal and switch to computerized cards. The Power has had the technology, but they are slowly preparing us so that we will want what they want us to do. They will make it appear like a cashless society is such a great deal. No more trips to the bank. No more theft. Fewer p olice. No counterfeiting. (They won't tell you what you will be actually giving up is one more freedom from their control.) Eventually, when people properly conditioned, they will take already existing technology to implant computer chips in our hands. The cashless society will seem like such a good deal, that unless Christians are fully committed to Christ, and are aware of the bigger picture, they will go along. Those that don't will appear like sticks in the mud. They will a ppear to oppose progress. The Christians in general have been going along with them every step of the way. It is hard to see what will wake the Christians up now. For instance, Social Security cards were initially they were never to be used for anything but Social Security. They were to be secret, and not used for I.D. Then they became I.D. numbers. Then they modified the law to say one has to get a social security number and has to give the number if requested. The Amish wisely backed out of the Social Security program when it became law.

Ballot Measure 5 was a tax revolt that slashed property taxes so deep, that Oregon schools lost $633 Million. Parks, schools and other services were possibly going to be eliminated. Naturally, some people asked, \"Who isn't paying property taxes?\" ■ \"The Masons.\" Due to the Masonic lodges' overwh elming political power, many states have given special proper ty tax exemptions to Masonic property. Other closely allied frat ernities, like the Elks, share the same exemption, but the Lions Club in Oregon doesn't because they don't have a \"lodge syst em\" with \"a ritualisti c form of government\" which is a criteria of the sp ecial exemption in Oregon. 1 The reason the Masons prefer a special exemption rather than an exemption as a non-profit ch aritable group is that th e ir definition of \"charitable\" might not match the state's. 2 Ex-Masons have criticized t he Masonic system for spending more of the funds raised for charit able causes on themselves and parties than on the causes themselves. In Multnomah County, OR the lodges of various kinds have 72 tax-exempt properties that would contribute 1/4 million dollars in taxes each year. The Masons have had their specia l exemption for half a century, and have successfully stiffled ever y attempt to chan ge things. Even compromise bills that would only le vy service fees on the Masons for police and fire protection given to their Temples and Lodges and other properties have been defeated. Ballot Measure 5 shows after it passed that the Masonic Lodge is concerned about itself more than public welfare. Even after Ballot Measure 5 passed, the Masoni c Lodge showed no compassion on everybody else. They had no intentio n of pay their \"share\" of taxes. They continued to flood the legislatures with letters and pressure not to vote against their specia l exemptions in any way.

How should the Christian respond to that? Picture Jesus being asked that qu estion. \"Master, the Masonic Lodge is getting special trea tment, that other non-profit organizations don't get.

In 1979, an articulate JW elde r, who was an ex-Baptist minist er, engaged this Author in conversation about religion, specific ally the JWs version of it. This Author's approach was to beat them at their own game, to outlegalize the legalizers. Having just self-published a book examining ho w both the NT and the OT Scriptures condemn interest taking, it was only na tural that this Author would raise Interest as an issue. The idea behind showing the full br unt of the OT law, and Christ's expectations for us, is that in showing how demanding the law is, one shows th e need for grace. After all didn't Christ say the law is a schoolmaster to lead us to Christ? For the next two years, this Author raised the issue of Inte rest taking and the lack of proper scriptural understanding about it to the Jehovah's Witnesses. This Author had also mailed out free about 500 of my books on Interest taking to various addr esses. Judging from the small amount of feedback, it wasn't a hot topic. Today's attitudes within Christ endom toward interest are 180 de grees opposite of attitudes that have been held by essentially all Christians for most of Chri stendom's history. Who could guess by looking at the Vatican Bank's large assets (over 1 Billion in 19 78) and their annual profit in 1978 of over 120 million dollars 1 that the Catholic Church forbid interest until 1830? What does Christ think about a ll of the Vatican's stock analysts , their computer s following the economic markets, their world-wide banking interests and so forth? Today's attitudes toward interest taking are so different from the past. And not only is that significant in itself, but there has been a wholesale memory loss about the evils of interest taking, undoubtedly facilitated by the One-World-Power's control ove r the media and religious institutions of learning. The JW elders with whom this Author raised the issue were totally unaware of the strong scriptural indictments against Interest taking. The subject hadn't surfa ced until recently. Since this Author's book, other Christia ns have begun to speak out agai nst it. Apparently, the Lord has laid the issue on mo re than one heart. THE WT RESPONDS TO THE ISSUE \"There's the answer to your questions,\" a JW sa id to me when the WT came out with articles on interest taking in the Mar. 1, 1981 issue. They followed with another one in the Aug. 1, 1982 issue. It seemed far-fetched to think that this Au thor precipitated a resp onse from the Towering Watchtower buildings in Brooklyn, but it wasn't a subject that was being raised by anyone else as far as I knew. At any rate if it was a re sponse, then it unwittingly did not help the WTs position with God Almight y. The scriptures condemned inte rest taking, but did leave one"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"loophole; those, who the Israelite s were authorized to kill and cleanse from the land, could be taken advantage of. It's clear why the Society had to hedge on their own repudiation of intere st taking, because the Society has been making money off of JW hardships. Their articles said that it is O.K. to charge interest for business deals, but not to take adva ntage of a brother's need. Yet, the Society when a group of JWs is too poor to raise a Kingdom Ha ll, encourages them to borrow money from the Society, and charges them interest. 2 This is a direct contradiction of their own articles in '81 and '82. WHY WRITE ON INTEREST? A popular story is that if you want to boil a fr og, then put him in cold water and heat the water slowly. If you put the frog directly into hot water, he'll jump out. Over the years, the Christians have been slowly cooked. How fa r have we come in the cooking process? We're almost done. As the Scriptures warn, Unless those days are shortened faith will not survive. Is that an oversta tement? Those readers who will bear reading this chapter will get a small sampling a how far we have come from the Scriptures. It is not likely that you will hear a sermon on such a topic in today's churches. Ezekiel was commanded to warn both the righteous and the unrighteous (Ez. 3:17-21). With God's help, I seek to declare the full counsel of G od. Paul did this and was therefore free of their blood. Acts 20:27 Many sincere Christians receive interest, due to the lack of good scriptural teaching in these times. Wisdom and tact and patie nce are certainly needed in re gards to correcting these dear Christians. It is up to God to judge their motives.(l Cor. 4:3-5) Interest-taking is only one fi nancial weapon of the New World Order. Inflation is another weapon. Economist and Nobel Peace Prize winn er Friedrich von Hayek noted, \"Inflation is probably the most important single factor in the vicious cycle wherei n one government action [increasing the money supply] makes more and mo re government control n ecessary.\" Lenin felt that the best way to destroy capitalism is to debauch the currency. Germ any's horrible inflation was a big reason Hitler appealed to the German people. Coercive semi-secret business monopolies are another tool of the New World Order. The proposed worker I.D. card will be another way to control the masses. Only those approved by them will be eligible to work. This chapter is not meant to imply that interest is their only financial weapon, but it certainly has been the primary means for th e parasite to survive and control its host. This chapter is intended to pull the mask of acceptability off of in terest, so that Christians can recognize that the basic livelihood of the International Bankers is co ntrary to Christian prin ciples. These people in their pin-striped suits consider themselves screwd and superior to the masses; the Scriptures view them as evil. It is hoped that if any Bible- believing Jews read this, they will recognize how wrong these Internationalist Bankers ar e. The issue with interest is a moral issue. It's not just that they loan money to Russia and Red China to build Socialism, it's that they make their money in the first place from having a monopoly on th e money supply, and ac ting as a parasite. THE WORLD'S GOVERNMENTS ARE SLAVES TO INTEREST TAKERS The International Bankers have the nations in debt to them. We th ink of Japan as a rich nation, but the national government of Japan is deeply in debt to the banke rs just like the U.S."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"government. Interest taking has been the life-blo od of the One-World-Order paracite. They have convinced even the Christian pe ople that interest is good. This chapter treats the same subject that chapter 3.10 is set up for, which subject is how to have a Christ-like response to the Conspiracy. This chapter deals with just one small issue, perhaps learning how far off Christianity is on just this i ssue, will stimulate Christians to investigate other financial issues. The New World Order has ru n roughshod over the U. S. Constitution and the Scriptures repeatedly, and is pre ssuring Christians into all kinds of compromises with their faith in Christ. Even though the Presid ent has suspended the Constitution, he had sworn to uphold it, as did many other Constitutional traitors. Scripturally, the Ch ristian has a duty to obey the Constitution first, before he obeys anyone who ha s broken their oath to uphold the Constitution in order to enslave you. The choice of wh at deserves obedience seems obvious, but many Christians are choosing the later course. One way to deal with the Power is to be a ligned with a superior moral power. The true Christian teachings have almost been destroye d by the Power on this subject. Unless these teachings are introduced, the Christian people will have no concept why we must come out from amongst their evil system, which is designed to prom ote evil. This is to help you know how to deal with them. WHY WRITE ON THE BIBLE? The authority of the Bible is not subtracted from when God us es men like Phillip to explain the Bible to men like the Ethi opean. (Acts 8) Sometimes, as with Peter and the people at Pentecost (Acts 2), and the three wise men in Je rusalem (Mt 2:1-8), the Scriptures can be made plainer by human words. No human can change God's word , \"For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven\" (Ps 119:89) (cf. Jn 17:17, Ps.119:160 , et al) The reader is encourag ed to check God's Word with diligence as the spiritua lly noble Bereans did (Acts 17:11). This is written to clarify the scriptures, and not to add to them. \"HOW SHALL YE BELIEVE MY WORDS?\" (JN 5:47) Those desiring to understand this chapter are encourag ed to equip themselves by being born- again and being in fellowship with the Lord their creator. \"But th e natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: ne ither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\" (1 Cor 2:14) See also 1 Cor 1:18, 1 Cor 1:25, & Jn 3:3. We must fear God: \"the fear of the Lord is the begi nning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.\" (Prov 1:7) \"Fear God and his commandments.\" (Eccl 12:13) We must be willing to do the will of God, \"For if we sin willfully after that we have we have receive d the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.\" (Heb 10:26) (cf. 2 Pt 2:21 & Jn 13:17) We must be filled with the Holy Spirit who reveals all things, \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the hear t of man, the things which God ha th prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Sp irit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.\" (1 Cor. 2:9-10) \"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghos t teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.\" (1 Cor 2:13) \"Be ye holy in all manner of life, \" (1 Pt 1:4), apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge,\" (Prov 23:12), \"The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge, and the"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.\" (Prov. 18:15) \"Study to show thyself approved unto God...rightly dividing the wo rd of truth.\" (2 Tim 2:15) FIVE O.T. SCRIPTURES FO RBIDDING INTEREST TAKING \"If thou lend money to any of my people...thou shalt not be to hi m as an userer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.\" Ex 22:25 \"I pray you, let us cease this exacting of interest.\" Neh 5:10 \"he that by interest and unjust gain increaseth hi s substance, he (God) sha ll gather it for him that will pity the poor.\" Prov 28:8 \"And if thy brother hath become poor, and cannot support himself among you, then thou shalt relieve him, yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner, that he may live with thee. Take no interest from him, or increase, but fear thy God; that thy brother may liv e with thee. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon intere st, nor lend him thy food supplies for profit.\" Lev 25:35-37 \"Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother.\" Deut 23:19 LET US... \"Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousne ss, ye that seek the Lord; look unto the rock from which ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from which ye are digged.\" Is 51:1 When the Master's sheep hear his voice they obey it. \"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar and the truth is not in him.\" 1 Jn 2:4 \"If ye love me, keep my commandments.\" Jn 15:14 \"We ought to obey God rather than men.\" Acts 5:29 The Bible has no promises to those who obey Him only partly. When we know something is wrong and do it, it is sin. Look at examples in Bi blical history —Nadab and Abihu (Lev 10:1,2), Saul (1 Sam 15), and Ananias and Sapphira (A cts 5:1-11). Remember, \"His commandments are not grieveous.\" (1 Jn 5:3) \"God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble.\" Js 4:6 The scriptures repeatedly ask us to submit ourselves under God's authority. By doing so we also come under his protection. That doesn't mean we will not su ffer— but we will be protected as He knows we should be. This author knows of amazing miracles of protection, but each person needs to trust God himself, and learn for himself that the Lord is good. LEARNING THAT TH E NT. ALSO CONDEMNS INTEREST A teacher who is hired by school to teach a cl ass, is a steward over the books she dispenses to her students. It would not be viewed lightly if she decided to make a profit for herself by charging her students money to use the schools bo oks? The teacher can c hoose to some degree how she uses those school books, but as a steward it is not her job to ma ke a monetary profit from them. Likewise, but even mo re so, we are to put to good use the wealth that God has entrusted to our stewardships. In the same fashi on that the teacher is aware of her stewardship, the Christian realizes that what we use is \"God's money\" not \"ours\". (\"The earth is the Lord's and the fulness ther eof...\" Ps 24:1, it was intended that men be stewards of this planet. As it is today, our present government taxes the land, thereby taking"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"advantage of the fact that everyone must have a pl ace to live. Whether the taxes are paid directly by the owner, or indirectly through rental increases each of us is being ta ken advantage of. It was never intended that men would take advantage of other men this way.) Our money and possessions are the Lord's. \"Those that believed were of one heart and of one soul; neither said any of them that any of the things which he possessed was his own.\" Acts 4:32 \"My Lord, O King, accordin g to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.\" 1 Kg 20:4 \"The Lord is the portion of mine inhe ritance and of my cup; thou main tainest my lot.\" Ps 16:5 The Lord \"giveth food\" Job 36:31 and \"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father\" Js 1:17 \"God shall suppy all your needs.\" Phil 4:19 Yet, \"The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, bl essed be the name of the Lord.\" Job 1:21 What should we do with God's money? \"Moreove r, it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful.\" 1 Cor 4:2 Render unto God the things that are God's. \"Fre ely ye have received, freely give\". Mt 10:8 Moreover \"everyone shall give accoun t of himself to God.\" Rm 14:12 1. \"But if any provide not for his own, and espe cially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse th an an infidel.\" 1 Tim 5:8 \"And having food and raiment let us there with be content.\" 1 Tim 6:8 2. \"Do good to them that are of th e household of faith.\" Gal 6:10 3. \"As ye have opportunity, do go od unto all men.\" Gal 6:10 \"Giv e to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.\" Mt 19;21, Mk 10:21, Lk 12:33, and Lk 18:22. Jesus \"spake many things to th em in parables\" Mt 13:3,13,34 21:1; Mk 3:23, 4:2,13,33; 12:1 \"Why speakest thou unto them in parables?\" Mt. 13:10 Those who do not understand the parables fulfill the pr ophecy of Isaiah 6:9, 10 Jesus said. Mt 13:14 God's people are to seek to unde rstand the parables' mysteries. Mt. 13:11 \"Seek and ye shall find.\" Mt 7:7, Lk 11:9 PARABLE OF THE UNJUST STEWARD LK 16:1-9 Jesus said, \"There was a certain rich man, w ho had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. And he called him, and sa id unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest no longer be steward. Then the steward said w ithin himself, What shall I do? For my lord take th away from me the stewardship. I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. I am resolved what to do, that , when I am put out of the stew ardship, they may receive me into their houses. So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? And he said, an hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. And the lord commended the unjust steward becau se he had done wisely; for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mone y of unrighteousness, that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"Here was a servant who faced judgment. His mast er was going to cast him out, fire him, and make him pay for his sins. This sevant then gave his master's money (reduced the wealth y man's debtors'de bts, and by that made friends) while he had a ch ance; and by doing so prepared a home for himself when he got his reward for poor stewardship. \"And the Lo rd (Jesus) commended the unjust steward.\" The Lord didn't say the man was just and honest (he called him \"unjus t\")—but he said he was wiser than the children of light. Why? What did the unjust steward do that many \"Christians\" don't do? He gave freely while he had a ch ance, and he secured himself a future after his judgment. Do we take our Master's mone y and give freely? Are we prepared for the judgment? Verse 9 clearly explains the lesson of this stor y. We are to make our selves friends by the money of unrighteousness by freely giving, so th at when we fail (when we die), they (the heavenly host) may receive us into everlasting habitation (which is heaven). Verses 10 and 11 continue the idea that it is more blessed to give than to receive. He that is faithful in that which is least is fa ithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. If, therefore, ye have not be en faithful in the unrighteous money, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithfu l in that which is another man' s, who shall give you that which is your own? Dear reader, God's word plainly tells you that in terest is wrong. It may be a small matter, but verses 10 and 11 tell us we must be faithful in the small things befo re we can be faithful in that which is great. Verse 11 warns us to be good stew ards of wealth. The Ph arisees and many Jews charged interest. They still do, and are called \"covetous\" (lovers of money) in Luke 16. \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\" Mt 6:24 and Lk 16:13 If people would obey God's commandments, it wouldn't be too likely they woul d have much money to be concerned about getting interest. \"Work with your hands.\" 1 Thes 4:11 Can you say with Is aiah 49:4 \"my work (is) with my God?\" \"All that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy.\" Lev 27:9 We cannot rob from the rich to give to the poor. Our money should be honestly earned. LAY NOT UP FOR YOURSELVES TREA SURES UPON EARTH (MT 6:19) This means just that. Get rid of your wealth! You may ask me, \"How can you tell people that?\" That is just exactly what Jesus told the young ma n to do to get to heaven—\"sell what thou hast, and give to the poor.\" (Mt 18:21, Mk 10:21, Lk 12:33; 18:22) LAY NOT UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES UPON EARTH. Do you have money saved up and put away? - -LAY NOT up for yourselves treasures upon earth. God told the Jews \"Ye are cursed with a curse; for ye have r obbed me.\" Mal 3:9 See also Mal 3:8, Ps 119:61 and Is 42:22. How can we rob God? Those who charge interest are robbers. \"How canst thou say, I am?\" Jer. 2:23 \"Wherefore w ill ye plead with me? Ye all have transgressed against me, saith the Lord.\" Je r 2:29 You have taken God's money that was to be given freely to the poor. (Or in the case of the government, th ey have taken the land freely given to man, and are charging us for its use.) God gave you the ch ance with that money to purchase heavenly treasure and you went out and tried to make your self richer. If you try to save your life and wealth you will lose it. (Mt 10:39,16:25, Mk 8:35, Lk 9:24) It's ironic that the One-World-State plans to impoverish America— in allowing this God will simply be allowing for His law to be fulfilled.

Abraham Lincoln said that the sin of slavery was to be paid by American blood; what manner of payment will we make for robbing God? It is quite possi ble that the future suffering we are to experience is to free us from that which hinders us from \"setting our affections on things above.\" Col 3:2 \"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.\" 1 Cor 16: 1-2 It says give as the Lord hath given you. If he gave you $5 more than you needed— thank Him fo r the chance to give it. \"Cast your bread upon the waters.\" Eccl 11:1 —symbolicly meani ng don't greatly concern yourself with the end result of thos e material things that sustain you, but in contrast it says don't cast your pearls (heavenly treasure) away. What is holy do not give to the wicked people. Mt 7:6 For example, the temple of our body is holy, a virgin should not give this holy temple away to wickedness. Th e Holy Scriptures are holy-meaning set aside for God's service- this message will only be \"trampled upon\" by the ungodly. It doesn't say loan to the rich — but gi ve to the poor. People with large bank accounts have been giving their money to the rich banks to use. The banks take that money and loan it out to needy people and make themselves richer through interest. Don't he lp the rich get richer. Especially now that you are learning that the bi g rich banks are controlled by those rich men who intend to enslave the world under their New Order. Don't save up for tomorrow like the foolish man in Lk 12:17-21. Don't build bigger barns (if what you have is sufficient) and lay up wealth for your children to inherit. Give to the Lord. Think of all the wealth Christia ns lost when the stock market crashed in 1929. The depression closed banks and made stocks and bonds worthl ess. When the One-Worl d-Power monetizes the large debts and expenses of the U.S. government, there will be an exchange of one new dollar for two or ten of the old dollars. They have done this in third world countries, and have planned it for Canada and the United Stat es. Do good while you have a chance. Use God's money as he gives it. Act today, tomorrow never comes. \"Go to the ant, you sluggard and observe her ways,\" (Prov 6:6) and fight evil with good TODAY. Do good while you have a chance. Use God's money as He gives it. Don't try keeping it like th e foolish servant who said , \"I went and hid thy talent in the earth; lo there thou hast that is thine.\" Mt 25:24 Are the riches you were given in the earth (earthly things and the world)? \"Thou wicked and sl othful servant.\" —Invest your money in heavenly treasure. \"H e who soweth sparingly will re ap sparingly.\" 2 Cor 9:6 If you do not sow God's wealth to the po or, you will reap little wealth in heaven. This is not that every pay check you get must be spent immediately, bu t rather do not be afraid of giving to a good cause, just because you want to feel secure. Riches are no secur ity. Jesus never begged, but he did not always have ready cash, as is seen when the disciples got money from the fish's mouth. Mt 17:27 One man who gave almost all he had, was asked about his generosity. He said, \"Oh, I shovel into God's bin, and he shovels back into mine, and he's got a bigger shovel.\" Some will contend that we emphasize the moral law too much, and that grace and salvation should be preached. \"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had known sin but by the law; for I had not kn own coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\" Rm 7:7 Yes, the law comes along and shows man what is sin. \"Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no tr ansgression.\" Rm 4:15 The law condemns man and points out his sin. But the law can not save him; the law w ill not cleanse a man. But the law drives a man to the cross. \"Christ hath redeem ed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.\" Gal 3:13 Sin still remains sin. \"How shall we, that ar e dead to sin, live any longer therein?\" Rm 6:2 \"They that are after the spirit mind the things of the Spirit.\" Rm 8:5"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"If God forbids interest, and you retain it, then you love interest more than God's word. \"He that turneth away his ear from h earing the law, even his prayer shall be an abomination.\" Prov 28:9 People try to make interest legal. They call it legal, because before they steal they tell the party how much they will steal, as thoug h they stole according to what is fair. It might be lawful by man's law, but there is a higher law. Making an occupation of it is no better than making an occupation out of bribery and blackmail. \"Love...seeketh not its own.\" 1 Co r 13:5 But interest seeketh of ot hers, therefore interest is far from love. \"God is love.\" 1 Jn 14:16 Therefore, interest is far from God. QUESTIONS? Is this all new to you, the reader? Have you been taught that God wants you to be rich? Perhaps they quoted to you 1 Tim 6:18 \"Instruct th em to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share.\" This is not speaking about accumulating wealth. Does good works mean money to you? Perhaps they quoted 2 Cor 9:8, \"And God is able to make all grace a bound to you, that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may ha ve an abundance for ever y good deed.\" This is not speaking about accumulating wealth . Does grace mean money to you? 2 Cor. 9:6 is the only scripture that give a legitimate motivati on for bringing in excess money —not to accumulate it, but for giving it. \"But th is I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\" So far this chapter has only scra tched the surface of a large subj ect. Naturally, there will many questions, some by sincere truth seekers, some by t hose trying to find fault or loop holes in God's financial principles for our finances. Some prefer for some misguided reasons to allow the One- World-State to do their financial planning and to allow themselves to be manipulated and jerked around, and ultimately enslaved. They are not aw are that the One-World -Power which controls the Federal Reserve, the IRS, and the Bank of England, and much more , are designed not for benevolence but to control the world. This Author has personally witnessed the System mislead and enslave many farmers with farm loans that never should have b een made.

ARE THE SCRIPTURES IN THE O. T. ON INTEREST IRRELEVANT? It is clear that Interest is against the moral teach ings of Christ. Is that all the Christian can base his actions on, or does the O.T. have relevance today? \"All scripture is given by inspir ation of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reprove, for correction, for instruction in the paths of right eousness\", 2 Tim 3:16 When Paul wrote this the only scriptures were the Old Testament. According to Mt 5:17-19 we rea lize that no one has the right to void one small commandment of the O.T., except that Christ teach us a greate r way to fulfill the law. This writer believes that the moral law is unchanged which true faith establishes. Rm 3:31 The law was everlasting. Does \"everlasting\" mean to stop at Malachi? The relationship of the law, morality and grace is examined in detail in the book Life In The Son. It shows without question th at the Christian is called to liv e the moral laws. The subject is quite complex, because so many are not willing simp ly to accept the harder scriptures at face value. Let us remember that th ere is no Christian liberty outside of the truth, which is God's word. \"If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\" Jn 8:31,32"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"Interest is forbidden by the moral teachings of the Old Testamen t, and New Testament scripture encourages us to foll ow these same moral teachings. WAS THE LAW (Torah) IN TENDED FOR JUST ISRAEL? The Apostle Paul's opposition to the law was not actually opposition to the law per se, but rather to show men that salv ation did not result from the obs ervance of the law. There are numerous New Testament scriptures that indicat e the Law was practiced by our supreme example Jesus Christ (cf Sermon on th e Mount), and also by Paul. But when one speaks of \"the La w\", there are different meanings assigned to what it means. Moses received the Decal ogue (what is called th e Ten Commandments). He also received Priestly Laws and the Covenant C ode, plus a supplementary Covenant ma de at Horeb (Deut. 29:1). It is clear that moral laws of God we re in operation long before these various Codes, Covenants, and laws were given. The first five books contain civ il law, priestly law, and public law. Nor is each law exclusively in one category. It was recognized by all the early Christians that the moral laws of God should be followed by all men. What is not of faith is sin. The Christian is called to obey rules due to his faith and trust in His Creato r. The original meaning of Torah, which is \"instruction\", applies today to the Torah. The la ws concerning interest were not figurative nor civil law, clearly the warni ngs were of a moral nature. AREA ONE-QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE RELEVANCE OF THE O.T. TEACHINGS ABOUT INTEREST TAKING. The Old Testament teachings about Interest Taking are relevant for a number of reasons for the Christian today. Let us summarize the values gained by obedience to our heavenly Father before presenting the Scriptural basis for these. * First the Scriptures are in ag reement with Christ's New Test ament teaching. We remain under his protection by our obedience. * Second, these scriptures still serve as instruc tion in righteousness for the Christian enabling the Christian to mature. *Third, a clear conscien ce is an inner freedom of spirit toward God that comes from knowing that God's holiness is no t offended. A correct a ttitude toward interest may clear up a hidden barrier blocki ng that inner peace with God. * Fourth, the rejection of God's standard quenches the Spirit, results in inner tension, and loss of spiritual direction. To follow God means to promote our health. The moral law is unchanged and is established by true faith. Rm 3:31. Reading Mt 5:17-19 it can be observed that no one has a right to ma ke void one small command of the O.T. except Christ, who was special in his own right. Because these guidelines are solid, we have a firm foundation that we can depend upon, this is ancien t wisdom of the best kind. \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in the paths of righteousness\" 2 Tm 3:16 But some will ask is the law given against Inte rest in Ex 22:25, Deut 23:19-20, Lev 25:36-37 part of the moral law? In view of the liberty the Israelites had to lend on interest to strangers, at first it seems that if it were morally wrong to take interest, why would this libe rty be allowed? After all it isn't morally right to commit adultery or to be drunk with strangers. It is important to clear up exac tly what strangers are meant he re—for the Israelite's heathen friends and their converts were to be exempt fro m interest (Deut 23:20); it was to the Israelites"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"enemies, who they could kill—or at times were commanded to kill, that they could charge interest to. Interest a ppears to have been considered a kind of punishment, and other scriptures bear this out. \"If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of th e Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes whic h I commend thee this day, that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee. He (the stranger) shall lend to thee, a nd thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.\" Again we read, \"And all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God. Th e Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in its season, and to bl ess all the work of thine hand; and thou shalt lend unto many nati ons, and thou shalt not borrow.\" It seems likely the blessing of lending and the cu rse of borrowing of these passages refers to loaning with interest. If it was or wasn't doesn't alter the fact, that God commanded them not to charge interest to his chosen people, converts to the faith, friends of th e faith, but allowed them to loan with interest to those heathen enemies. In regards to what kind of law th is was, note that the first thre e books of Moses are considered to give the law, and Deut. is consid ered by some to repeat those laws. These three books mention twice about loaning to the poor, and once abou t to poor strangers. Why does the Holy Spirit twice say, \"If thy brother be poor, thou shalt not lend on usury\" ? (Usury in the King Jame s Translation meant all interest.) So me will say that means the law was not universal, but limited to lo aning to the poor, bu t that for business ventures it was O.K. But in Deut. it forbids usury (int erest) to poor and rich alike. This is where an objection by some develops who see Deut. as only a repetition of the law. Some would claim that we must ignore any additions the prophets gave to Ex 20 because they were not law givers, but law interpreters; therefore, th ey assert these laws ar e intended for kindness to the poor, just as Deut 15: 1,2,3 and Deut 24:19,20,21. First, this ignores the tradition that Moses wr ote Deut. Second, there is much mo re morally wrong with interest than just that it is unkind. However, kindness is a moral law and should be practiced too. If we have a chance to be kind in the manner of De ut 15 and 25, then let us do this. Bear in mind that interest is contrary to both the moral te achings of Christ and forbidden by the moral teachings of the law. \"At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release. And this is the manner of the release: every creditor who lendet h anything unto his ne ighbor shall release it, he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother, because it is called the Lord's releas e. Of a foreignor thou mayest exact it again; but that which is thin e with thy brother, thine hand shall release.\" \"When thou cuttest down thine harv est in the field, and hast for gotten a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it, it shall be for the stranger, for the father less, and for the widow, that the Lord God may bl ess thee in all the work of thine hand.\" (verse s 20-22 forbid beating the olive tree over again, and gleaning grapes for a second time.)—No wonder the Jewish International Financiers will go to great lengths to destroy t hose who would hol d the Bible's teachings dear. Can a Christian go after a forgotten sheaf in the field? May those who take clothes as a pledge for money lent, wait until the sun goes down to return them (Ex 22:26) ? Can a Christian hold a debtor 8 years to a debt? Can a Christian obe y one law of kindness a nd not another? Can we deny Christians the liberty of breaking Deut 15:1,2,3 and Deut 24:19,20,21? Are we guilty of forbidding interest, a law of kind ness, and ignoring the other laws of kindness? Have \"Christians\""},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"been playing church, or have they been learning to walk in God's spirit, and not after the lust of the flesh? (cf. Gal 5:16) AREA TWO 1. Is there a difference be tween usury and interest? Today, the words have different meanings, how ever originally usury meant all interest. Generally, usury is used today to mean an exorbant or illegal rate of interest. When the shift in public attitude came toward interest, the word usury which was used to mean any interest changed to its new meani ng of an exorbant rate. However, in scripture, and al so in the nation of Israel there was no distinction between acceptable and unacceptable rates of interest, it was all considered to be extortion (Ps 109), and the extortioner was considered to be a robber. 1 Cor 6:10 2. What does the world say in favor of interest? First, as Christians let us remember, \"If a nyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, even the word s of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions, us eless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. From such withdraw yourself.\" (emphasis added) 1 Tim 6:3-5. When worldly Christians or people in the worl d begin defending interest they often try to muddle the issues. They like to make the issues s eem complicated. They also to try to show that interest taking has benefits. Let's take a glance at this last item, that interest taking has be nefits. They say the lender takes risks, so interest encourages loans. All ventures have risks, who can ascertain the future even on the safety of crossing the street ? Does this mean I deserve to be paid for crossing? The risks taken by a usurer loaning to a company are far different than the company's and its pardners' risks who must take their lumps on whether the bu siness prospers or fails. And the loss of their property, or goods remains ever pr esent. That the usurer is in a way risking his money is true, but it is a totally different risk than the compan y and its pardners are e xperiencing. Further, if risk is a criteria for receiving extra money, ever y person even remotely connected to the business venture can claim some compen sation. The families of the co mpany, the janitors, and the neighbors all have a risk of so me kind. That is the crux of th e matter. The usurer supposes he deserves to be congratulated and honored for his risk taking. But the honest farmer, or the honest carpenter take risks everyday w ithout compensation not supposing that their risks are special above everyone else's. No one pays the farmer for ta king a risk when he plants his seeds, so that we can eat. No one pays the ca rpenter for taking a risk when he begins a house not knowing absolutely if a fire or strong wind might not da mage it during constructi on. The carpenter takes this risk that we might have shelter. Risk en titles us to nothing. If it did we should all have a claim on riches. But the world will shudder, \"Loa ns are necessary and who wants to loan if they are given interest?\" In a sense, our si nful economy does need sinful in terest taking to function. The Pornography market needs more lewd photographs to continue selling books. However, many economies including the modern Mo slem economy are (or have) func tioning fine without interest taking. It is only to be expect ed that the world will shudder, bu t then they shudder to think of"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"a world without sin. To live with out cigarettes, booze, wild wome n, etc. seems incomprehensible to them also. This author is not concerned that by getting very technical and in depth in the issue of interest taking God's word might contradict itself. Go d's will for us is not inconsistent. His pronouncements against Interest are not inconsis tent with His best wi shes for our lives. The problem with getting indepth is that this Author 's approach is based on the scripture's value system, and that what the worldly Christian must realize is that what he might call benefits in God's eyes are a shame. For instan ce, it will be argued that trade is encouraged by interest. That interest helps trade does not add merit to interest , for most trade today is conducted unchrist-like. Does our trade glorify God or man? Trade can go on without interest. The old Hebrew nation and many others have managed without. If we get sucked into the compli cated theories about interest a person can get really confused. The world has their financial gurus that are argue ing, studying and contradicting each other as to how interest functions upon an economy. We are not to let ourselves be spoiled by philosophy (Col. 2:8). They would have us believe the economy regulates interest rates and borrowing, and they see all kinds of \"benefits\" of interest. In simple terms, inte rest allows people to spend more than their limits, and brings many to ruin. Sometimes, as Christians we give the thief our coat and our hat besides our wallet to show him that God loves him. Interest is robbery and perhaps we may need to experience it for God's glory, but that does not mean robbery is O.K. What would you replace lending on interest w ith? Won't people who will be ruined by borrowing, be ruined whether they took interest or not? Couldn't hard feeling arise if a man lending freely is injured for the need of money th at was promised to be repaid, but wasn't? Isn't money lent longer when interest is charged an d wouldn't the shorter period of freely loaned money be a hardship? People can injure themselves w ith about anything. The Christian applies God's principles and the dynamics of those principles work toward success. First, we ar e commanded to lend where we do not expect to receive agai n—Lk 6:35. The borrower is instru cted to be \"Not slothful in business\"—Rm 12:11 and 2 Thes 3. The borrower is plainly instruct ed not to live off of others unnecessarily. We are all commanded to honestly work with our hands. If we suffer for having righteously loaned money for a need, the Scripture' s value system esteems such suffering. If that seems cruel to the world—they should recall all the suffering they have en couraged people to go through, it is an honor in the world to suffer th rough the Iron Man Tria thalon (talk about pain), it was the in thing for worldly women to wear painful corsets and whale-bone girdles to force their bodies into painful unnatural shapes, unless one gets wasted with alcohal and suffers a hangover he is not cool at parties,... the list could go on of the many ways the world expects their people to suffer. So un derstand that for us to suffe r for our God is our glory. If we give money so that a person can be slot hful and waste it, we show poor stewardship, because we do not want to encour age that person's sin of slothf ulness. (Some misunderstand and think that not charging interest is carelessness. Satan would have us overl y careful lest we lose some of our abundance—yet that abundance was given us so that we could share.) The question is not whether we might suffer without charging interest, but what is th e morally correct thing to do. That is the question. That money freely le nt has its faults is no secret. The underlying principle is to do what is most loving toward God, and one's fellow man. The focus of interest is self."},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"How would the world today survive without inte rest?— How would it surv ive without soldiers to fight wars? What if this? What if that? Let us not worry about something the Scripture says will not happen. We know that evil along with it s \"bloodsucking usurers\" are not going to all stop their bloodsucking just because you and I do, nor will the world self-destruct from lack of interest taking. But so what if it did? Why should the Christians be disturbed if the One-World- Order feel apart? These \"if\" qu estions are vain— but perhaps it may console the sincere seeker to know that the modern Moslem world has done very well without interest taking. Medieval Europe was often without interest and did fine. The natives of the Americas and Australia did fine without interest. And it is conceivable that the New Heavens and New Earth will be able to do just fine without interest. As it stands today, interest take rs have a vested interest in people being in need. If interest were not allowed the interest takers would develop more con cern to see others sufficiently prosper. Doesn't Mt 25:14-24 teach interest is right? We can use the Master's money to get worldly or heavenly treasure, it's your decision. You can use it selfishly or give it to Christ, it's your decision. God provides us with a surplus, so that we can use it to glorify Him, and so we might enjoy the blessings from giving. Isn't a man worth $1,500 who loans $100 to a neighbor worth $1,500 losing more than the one borrowing gains? No. It is true though that th e value of money can fluctuate—there is nothing wrong with repaying according to the real valu e of the paper one has borrowed. To say \"you loaned me x amount of purchasing power and I will pay back x amount of purchasing power,\" is not interest. This is due to the fact that th e paper we call money is not real money, but the alchemy of the Satanic financial Power. Yes, th e occult does create gold out of paper and lends it out to nations and individuals on interest. (See chap. 3.3 to learn how the international bankers are a satan worshipping clique.) And then to avoid the effect of the Satanic alch emists and their inflation people try to use the interest-rates (extortion-rates) to profit from inflation. They justif y their interest in extortion by claiming they are merely \"protecting\" themselves from inflation. If they simply want to protect themselves they should buy real money, i.e. gold, silver and real wealth i.e. land, houses, and tools; rather than stealing from someone through interest. Aren't you trying to turn the world upside down? True Christians, like Paul was (Acts 17:6), will be accused of this, because they are trying to turn it right side up. When the Power makes Christianity illegal, will we have enough Christianity to be convicted? I hope so. 3. What have Christians done in the past (before the Media wa s controlled by the wrong people) concerning interest? We should not rest our faith on the actions of me n, but rather \"let God be true, but every man a liar.\" Rm 3:4 Still, many will be interested in the past. EARLY CHURCH FATHERS Barnabas, known from ma ny scriptures concerning him in Ac ts, Corinthians and Galatians, wrote against interest (usury). He also wrote \"T hou shalt labor with thy hands to give to the poor that thy sins may be forgiven.\" 1 "},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"Clement, who also worked with Paul (see Phil.) wrote in praise of the Old Testament for its humanity in forbidding interest. He said, \"indeed the man who is generous to the poor receives sufficient usury in gratitude, pr aise and honor of his fellowman.\" 2 Barnabas' writings were considered scripture in Alexandria for about a century, and Clements' writings were considered scripture for two centuries by the early Christians. The Christian Hermes also wrote against inte rest. An early writing wh ich some say Hermas wrote says, \"They that receive without a real ne ed, shall give an account for it: but he that gives shall be innocent; for he has fulfilled hi s duty as he received it from God.\" 3 Tertullian (c.155-220 A.D.) wrote against Interest. He wrote that Lk 6:35 means the same as Ez. 18:8. Remember that Ez. 18:8 re fers to interest as evil and Lk . 6:35 refers to lending without hoping for anything in return. For Te rtullian's references to the evil of intere st see this footnote. 4 St. Cyprian (205-258 A.D.) and St. Apolonius of Hier apolis (who wrote in 175-176 A.D.) also wrote against interest. Cyprian wrote in 248 or 249 A.D. \"Non faenerab is fratri tuo usurum pecuniae et usuram ciborum\"—\"We must not practice interest.\" 5 In the 5th and 6th centuries we have the writi ngs of many religious leaders who completely condemn the taking of any kind of interest. 6 The Catholic church banned inte rest until 1830. Augustine in his City of God, Bk. III, chapt. 17 related how the worst measure of oppression in the Roman Empi re during the Punic wars of all the many oppressive measur es was \"The people overwhelm ed...most of all by usury...\" The Anabaptist c hurches although they disagreed with the Catholic church over many issues, saw eye to eye with the Catholics concerning intere st taking. Only in recent times have many of them lost the teaching that interest is evil. One of the first important assemblies of Chri stians after the Apos tles was the Council of Nicene. This Council forbid usury (interest) to the clergy with these words, \"Whoever of the clergy, for filty Lucres sake, exerciseth Usury, let him be Disposed.\" 7 The 44th of the Apostoli c Canons and the 1st Council of Arie s (314 A.D.) proh ibited it in the same way. The reformers Menno Sim ons, Martin Luther and Zwingli were agreed on one th ing. They all condemned interest. Martin Luther-\"When money is lent and a charge made or more taken back than was originally made over, that is usury, and as such is condemned by every law...nor can they (interest takers) be save d unless they do penance\" 8 \"the devil invented it,\" and anyone who charges interest is \"a th ief, robber and murderer.\" 9 \"Rents are but the 'fig leaves' behind which usury hides its shame\". 10 \"Money is an unfruitful commodity which I cannot se ll in such a way as to entitle me to a profit.\" 11 \"Will not interest soon be the ruin of the world?\" 12 Luther felt Luke 6:34 commands us to follow th e Old Testament teach ings against usury. 13 He also felt that the trading companies, and banker s, and merchants revealed such a \"bottomless pit of avarive and wrong-doing that there is nothing that ca n be discussed with a good conscience.\" 14 \"How can there be anything good in trade?\" 15 Menno Simons-\"But in al l things, one towa rd another, long-suffering, friendly, peaceable, ever ready in true Christian love to serve one's ne ighbor in all things possible: by exhortation, by reproof, by comforting, by as sisting, by counseling, with deed and with possessions.\" 16 \"We beg of you from the bottom of our hearts, for Jesus' sa ke, to reflect a moment whether your spirit is one with the Lord's Spirit, and your conviction agrees with His holy Word; whether it is the Spirit of the Lord and the love for your nei ghbor or the thirst for gain and the thought of"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"temporal support that send and drive you into your profession.

One encyclopedia states \"Calvin blessed the Jews.\" 20 Even though Calvin wasn't so radical to accept all interest, he opened the door. Calvin in his Commentary on Exodus, 22:25 declared that interest could be permitted to the rich. He thought interest takers were shameful (Comm. on Ps. 15:5) a nd that a well-ordered community would not tolerate interest takers to live in their communities. (Comm. on Ezek., 18:5-9). However, though he condemned inte rest to the poor, he opened the door to it for those who weren't poor. In his sermon on Deut., 23 :8-20 he expressed that the interest should be moderate, and never allowed within the Christian fellowship. Calvin had a very good attitude toward wealth, he states \"God mixes up the rich and poor so that they may meet together and hold fellowship with each other so that the poor receive and the rich give.\" 21 There has been debate whether Calvin opened the door to Capitalism or not. It is clear from Calvin's sermons and commentaries he did not intend to support Capitalism. Troeltsch sugge sts that the ethic of Calvin was \"a door into which ca pitalism was able to steal.\" 22 It seems the proof is in the pudding. Geneva and Swit zerland developed into banking cente rs. The Reformed religion, which spread through those areas of Europe caught betw een the rival Catholic and Protestant areas, has shown a remarkable interest in commerce and capitalism. Calvin's influence carried over into the Puritan capitalistic work ethic of New Engl and. An abundance of capitalists came out of Calvinistic backgrounds. The door was let open a squeek, and through that d oor rushed a horde of characters that sought power. Along with that lust for power came the desi re to kill the one authority that stood in their way of world domination—faith in the Creator an d his Word. It's interesting to note Pres. John Adams in 1819 stated, \"Banks have done more in jury to the religion, morality, tranquility, prosperity and even wealth of the nation than they can have done or ever will do good.\" Whether Adams knew it or not, it is probable th at the War of 1812 was manufactured to prove to the nation that the U.S. needed a central national bank. During the war the bank, now known as Citibank and now controlled by the Rothschilds, raised over a million dollars in loans for the War of 1812. 23 Pressure to re-charter a National Bank came as soon as the War of 1812 began, especially from two Americans who were vocal proponents of the War of 1812, the Mason Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. Harvard President Jose ph Willard saw the war as the working of the Illuminati. 24 History records that Jewish Banker and jeweller Piccolo Tigre was an early member of the Illuminati. 25 Some of the Jewish banking fam ily of the Rothschilds have been too."},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"NOTES 1.

Don't people need incentive to pay off their loans, aren't they spoiled by no interest?"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"The nation of Israel was directed by God not to be slothful—note for instance the proverb calling them to learn from the industry of the an ts. If not having to pay interest makes people slothful, then God gave a command that was harmful. However, the scriptures against interest are fo rbidding it out of the principles of love and kindness. Jesus indirectly confirms this by stating that on love hang all the law given to Israel. Mt 22:40 The prophets of Israel (meaning their messag es) were also accordin g to Christ sent to Israel out of love. The prophets condemned interest taking. If people are observing scripture by not taking inte rest, then they must also deal with Rm 12:11 \"Not slothful in business\" and 2 Thes 3. QUESTION 5. What about inflation? In 1929, $100 would have bought a good dairy cow. Five years later $100 would have bought 3 or 4 cows. This was a case of money gaining in value. Locking someone into anykind of a fixed interest arrangement can not be justified on the basis of inflation, unless someone knows for a fact what the future will bring. It would be possible to peg th e repayment of a loan on the pu rchasing power borrowed rather than a monetary amount. This would not constit ute interest, and would actually be the most ethical type of repayment. Unfortunately, the U.S. government under the control of the World-Order allowed the International Power to issue Fe d. reserve notes contrary to the U.S. Constitution. When the Constitution was written it was plain that a monetary system on an honest medium of exchange- -silver, gold, etc. clearly was in the best interest of the nation. Christians are best off, if they can find alternatives to being in the system's perverted financial system . As Christians discover better methods than working through the One-World-Po wer's banking/financial theft system, some of these issues will take care of themselves. As much as possible the Chris tians should keep Christ's m oney among the Brethren, as the world can not be trusted to use it for God's glor y. Receiving interest from the world, encourages lending to the world rather than keeping the money within the Bret hren. Should we not take care of our own needy first? Gal 6:10, 1 Tim. 5:4, 8, 16. All of us who are keeping money within the Banking system are helping prop up one of the biggest evil powers the New World Order has. QUESTION 6 May we pay interest? Jer 15:10 \"I have neither lent on interest, nor men have lent to me on interest, yet every one of them curse me.\" The receiver of interest makes a giver of interest- he makes a thief. Wh ere there are no buyers there are no sellers. Where there ar e not bribe givers, no bribe takers. But what if it is a necessity? the Bible has so me strange cases of necessity. Adam's sons married sisters, David ate the shew bread (1 Sam 21:6), and the disciples healed on the Sabbath (Lk. 13:10). In Gen 21:32, Abraham received an unlawful oa th. Abraham made a cove nant with Abimelech and swore by God. Abimelech swore by the fals e Gods. Laban swore in Gen. 31:53 by the God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, the God of their father. Ur, city of the Chaldees worshipped Nanna the moon god and had this idol in their hom es. This father was a Chaldean. Was this an oath to the gods? Anyway Jacob swore by the f ear of his father, Isaa c, which was the Lord"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"Yahweh. Why the difference in oa ths? Did Abraham receive unlaw ful oaths and not sin? Didn't Christ show it is lawful to suffer in jury by paying tribute in Mt 17:29? Doesn't the Scripture of Isa 24:2 \"And it shall be...a s with the taker of usury, so with the giver to him.\" mean we may not pay interest? No, the verse actually says this, \"Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with th e servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress, as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to hi m.\" These verses tell the greatness and universality of the ruin and judgment on these peop le. If this verse means paying of usury is evil, then we must al so rediculously say an yone who is a priest, servant, maid, master, buyer, seller, lender, or borrower is also evil. God wasn't judgin g men for wanting to be priests or pay usury, but for not worshipping him as obedient servants. \"This I pray, that your love may abound yet mo re and more in knowled ge and in all judgment (Phil 1:9) Isa 24:2 does not condemn paying in terest. However, neither does it allow paying interest. \"If any man will do his will, he shall know of th e doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.\" (Jn 7:17) the man who gi ves himself 100 percent up to living and finding truth will understand that interest is the same as robbery and exto rtion, and paying interest should not be intentionally done. Sometimes, we are taken advantage of unawares. A man may allow himself to be robbed, but we are guilty of the crime if we encourage, tempt, or help the robber (or interest taker). We should no t lean unto our own understanding. Ma ny of us would not have thought Abraham should have accepted an oath to a strange god. Our unde rstanding would have been different than God's. God' s desire in our lives is not impossible to discover. Pray the situation through, keep praying until you know his will. \"If you want to know Go d, love him.\" 1 Cor 8:13 Otherwise I believe, \"he kn oweth nothing yet as he ought to know.\" As Naaman in 2 Kg 5:18, I w ould also say \"neither do or do not. I will not condemn thee- but if thy conscience cond emn thee then do not.\" QUESTION 7 What is required of the userer by God and his church. In referring to church our meaning is that of th e Bible's where those Chri stians within a certain city were of one church. In other words a lo cal body, where the person regularly fellowships. Interest is a work of the flesh and should be treated the same as \"adultery, fornication, uncleaness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft , hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, dr unkeness, reveling and the like.\" Gal 5:19-21. Sins should be confessed to God (Lk 15:18) and proper restitu tion (Lk 19:8 and others) and repentance done. (Acts 19:19, Lk 18:6, Jo b 42:6, Rev 2:5, Hos 14:4 and others) Unfortunately, few who charge interest understa nd how God looks at it. \"They know not what they do.\"(Lk 23:24) And most people living by it will want to defend it; people who don't live by it won't defend it, just as the silversmiths a nd the Image of Ephesus. (Acts 19:25) Will you plead for Baal? (Judges 6:31) The Bible warns usurers, \"thou ha st taken usury (interest) and in crease, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by exto rtion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God. Behold, therefore, I have smitten mine hand at thy dishones t gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hast been in the midst of thee.\" (Ez 22:12-13 ) \"The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"just.\" (Prov 13:22) It appears then that usurers sh all receive two payments. 1. the first of money, 2. the second of judgment. So repent sinner and make re stitution. Don't be like Samuel who ask, \"Whose goods did I take?\" (See 1 Samuel 12: 3); but be like Zacheus. \"And Zacheus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behol d, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anythi ng from any man by fals e accusation, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house.\" Lk 19:8-9 Restore it sinner, for the sin is not remitted until the money is restored. Amaziah in 2 Chr 25:9 did not know what he would do when he gave a hundred talents of silver. \"And the man of God answer ed, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.\" The interest taker (usurer) is out of fellowship w ith the Lord until this sin is fixed. He has no communion with Christ nor with the saints. Not onl y has he stolen, but he must not try to pass this money which is not rightly his onto his childre n, rather \"Set thy things in order before you die.\" Isaiah said to Hezekiah. (Is 38:6) So sinner, if Christ is in your heart and speaks to you as Zacheus, then restore now as Zacheus did. QUESTION 9 If I loaned money to a man would it be wrong to accep t interest if he insisted on giving it? There is a difference between ac cepting interest and demanding it. The best way to avoid the attending evils of interest is not to accept it, but encourage the debtor to give it to a worthy cause. This would be preferable, over accepting it oneself, if one is to avoid encouraging evil. Interest is a practice leading to the oppression of the poor. If the situation seems to be a special case, then the best answer is to put the issue be fore the Lord. I have myse lf had best results if I cleared my slate with the Lord first. I believe at times the Lord doesn't answer, simply because the plain answer is in his Word. Be honest with the Lord. QUESTION 10. Are there times interest taking is O.K.? Area Three- Questions concerni ng Biblical teachings on rent. QUESTION 1. Is rent the same as interest? Obviously, rent is not the same as interest. Th e very fact that the two words can be used without any problem of the mind confusing the tw o ideas shows that they are not the same idea. \"Should rent be viewed the same as interest?\" is a deeper question. Un fortunately, our modern Bible translations have confused the issue greatly . The modern Bible transl ations have attempted to put scripture in terms we can understand. In doing so they have given us words we understand, but that are not faithful to the original meaning. For instance, the parable of Jesus which occurs in Mt 21:33-41, Mk 12: 1-9 and Lk 20:9-16 in m odern translations appears to be a rental situation, when it was actua lly a SHARECROPPING ARRANGEMENT in the original language and the parable shows this. In fact, all the Biblical exampl es of \"rent\" which the modern translations present (with the exception of Paul renting a room in Rome (Acts 28:30 ) are not really examples of rent at all. Ex 22:15 speaks of loaning an animal, Deut 24:15 indicates work for wages, and Lev 25:15-16 refers to a buyer paying for a share of the crops."},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"The question remains is re nt forbidden or not? Alth ough rent was not part of the life of ancient Israel, and is not the optimum method for a Godl y Society to operate unde r, it is not expressly forbidden. It is this Author's conviction that rent is different from interest and can be paid. Rent inherently suffers from some of th e same defects of interest and in an ideal situation would be have to be eliminated. Because we do not live in an ideal situation, and we are not expressly forbidden, rent is permissible. A major diffe rence between the Israe lites and the modern man is that modern governments in effect believe they own all the land, and in effect \"rent\" the land to its citizens. If you do not belie ve this try missing your rent pa yments (taxes) and see if the government doesn't come for what they think is th eirs. In contrast to this ungodly system the Israelites were given the land for their families for an enduring i nheritance. It ge nuinely belonged to the people, rather than their government, a lthough the final title holde r was always God who held the people responsible for th eir treatment of the la nd. God will ag ain someday bring to ruin those ruining the earth, according to various scri ptures. How can we honestly quibble about rent, when in effect that is what a ll \"property owners\" are doing today? This Author does not wish to say that it is al ways right to charge or accept rent, but that although there may be some simila rity between rent and intere st, there are also some big differences. For instance, the owne r who rents his property, but pa ys the taxes and maintenance, etc., but receives no rent would be better off fi nancially, if he didn't own the property. This would not be the case wh ere money is loaned and no interest received. What if money was loaned and not returned? It would be a total loss, while if no rent was received couldn't the property be sold? In some cases the property could be sold, wh ile in other cases it ma y be the owner's home where he is unable to farm it himself. Thus to never allow rent could cause hardship. The man that could use property tax free and upkeep free - that is free of charge - has a better chance than if he would own the property. In contrast , the man who borrows $5000 without interest is not better off than someone who owns $5000. Agai n rent and interest are not alike. This does not give us any overall rule, circ umstances vary in case to case, but it does indicate that the rules applying to interest do not have blanket application to rent. The poor can be oppressed as severely by rent as interest. Some mini ng companies and other companies around the world have oppressed people to the point of actually keeping them in slavery to the companies by the use of rent. Rent originally served as a system of tribute, a tax in ancient times. It is clear that rent has its ow n harsh effects, but it must be examined in the context of being rent, and not as a type of interest. QUESTION 2. Was rent forbidden by the Law of Moses? After clarifying that rent is not interest, we then can ask, is rent forbidden by the Law of Moses? Yes and No. The origin of the word rent is helpful. Ren t comes from the Latin \"r endere\". Rendere could mean either a payment or the surrender of a city to an army. In the word \"sur-rend-er\" the rend comes from \"rendere\". The connotation has historically been a type of tribute or tax payment. Although to demand this type of payment might not be acceptable under the admonitions to love others, the scriptures do not categorically forbid rent, or taxes, or tributes. Certainly tributes, taxes and rents can and should be paid according to Christ's te achings. Whether Rent should be charged depends upon the exact situation. Again much of what we might offh and refer to as rent can or is actually something else."},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"QUESTION 3. May a Chris tian rent and not sin?

Area Four- Questions concerning lending and giving. QUESTION 1. Are the Biblical provi sions for the poor still in force? QUESTION 2. Suppose we lend money to a needy person and he wastes it, are we responsible for that? QUESTION 3. What are some of the duties of the borrower? QUESTION 4. What is the secret teaching of giving? One of the reasons Christ's and the scripture's teachings on giving are being lost is that \"The natural man receiveth not the thi ngs of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spir itually discerned.\" 1 Cor 2:14 \"But God hath chosen the foolish things of the wo rld to confound the wise.\" 1 Cor 1:27 God's secret formula of success is to give a bundantly, freely, wisely, cheerfully, humbly, and secretly—for which He sees in s ecret and He richly rewards you in return in secret. As one man has often been quoted, \"I shovel into God's bin, and He shovels back in to mine, and He has a bigger shovel.\" St. Cyprian, bishop of the church at Carthage , was one of the first Christian leaders. His writings condemn interest taking. His writings we re very interesting to read, because they emphasized alms giving to an extent that is rarely if ever heard today. In chapter 2 and 3 of his writings he brings out in scriptures in a way that is not taught today how important it is to give alms to cleanse ourselves of the sins we commit as Christians. In chapter 4 he brings out how if we do not here the needs of those around us, then we can not expect our prayer life to be fruitful. In chapter 6 he brings out that Tabitha's almsgiving had qualified her to be raised from the dead. In chapter 7, he brings out that we must be faithful with unrighteous mammon, if we are to expect God to commit to us true rich es, (cf. Lk 16:11) Chapter 9 through 13 are to encourage Christians not to fear about giving too much, and their resources failing them. In chapter 18 he advises those w ho have many children in their ho mes with stretched budgets to give much because in doing so they cover the multitude of sins that come from a multitude of family members. The read er is encouraged to read St. Cyrp rians writings for a more indepth study of the power of and the need for giving alms. Area Five- Questions concerning my hermeneutics QUESTION 1. How does the original Hebrew read concerning interest? The following are Hebrew word s meaning to take interest. 1. \"masah\". \"masah\" comes from \"nasah\" (verb) and signifies in \"qual\" to take or demand interest."},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"2. \"nesak\". \"nesak\" comes fro m \"nasak\" (verb) which m eans to bite to oppre ss, to take interest. A picture of the pain of interest to the borrower is inherent in the word . The word \"n asah\" which meant interest taker has been translated extorti oner in various scriptures. It was understood in the early church that the N.T. gree k references to extortioners were applicable to interest takers. 3. \"lavah\". \"lavah\" signifies in \"qual\" to borrow and \"hif'il\" to lend. 4. \"marbit and tarbit\". from \"rabah\" (meaning to increase or to multiply) comes two other names for interest \"marbit\" and \"t arbit\" (which also means a surplu s or increase). The equivalent word in ancient Mesopotamia \"Sibtu\" which meant increase, carried with it a negative connotation meaning increase by att ack such as an attack by pirates, or an attack of epilepsy. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES Ex. 22:25 \"If thou lend (l avah) money to any of my people who is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer (noseh - meaning ex tortioner), neither sha lt thou lay upon him usury (nesek).\" Lev. 25:35-38 \"And if thy brothe r who dwelleth by thee be wa xen poor, and fallen in decay with thee [meaning he cannot support himself among you], then thou shalt relieve him, yea, though he be a stranger (ger), or a sojourner, that he may live with thee. Ta ke no usury (nesek) from him or increase (tarebit), but fear thy God; that thy brothe r may live with thee. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury (nesek), nor lend him thy victuals (food supplies) for increase (marebit - meaning fruits or profits). In Deut. 23:19-21 the word usury (nesek) meaning interest is us ed five times. The word for stranger (nokri meaning foreignor) appears once. David complains of his en emies in Ps 109 and asks God to allow them to reap evil. Ps 109:11, \"Let the extortioner (nasah) catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour...because he persecuted the poor and needy man\" (other resons are also gi ven here in Ps 109:16). Ps 15 says \"Lord, who shall abid e in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in the holy hill?...He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taking reward of the innocent.\" Studying this seems to indicate that David believed taking inte rest came under the moral law. Sir. 29:1-3 (Apoc.) read s \"extortioner and an oppr essor to devour (nasak)\". This and Ps 109:11 are two verses where \"nasak\" was transl ated extortion rather than interest. It appears from the original Hebr ew usage that all interest was considered to be a form of extortion. Ezek. 22:12 speaks of interest takers and extort ioners in the same sent ence, and Mt 23:25 says the Pharisees are hypocrites being \"full of extortion and excess.\" Lk 18:11, I Cor. 5:10, 5:11, 6:10 ar e scriptures condemning extortioners. Amos 2 tells how the garments us ed as legal instruments for secu ring a debt and the wine of those who had been fined had been taken. The wine seized from fines must refer to a payment in kind taken from debtors. Whether this was acco rding to the law illegal interest or not, it is clear that it produced suffering of the poor which disobeys Ex 23:6; 22:22,26. QUESTION 2. Is it lord or Lord in Lk 16:18? Is it \"Lord\" or \"lord\" in Lk 16:8? Some will contend that I have added something to the scriptures , because English Bibles have a small \"1\" for \"lord\" in Luke 16:18. Does vers e 8 refer to the rich man and not to the Lord Jesus? Actually, they are the one s who are adding to the scriptur es. No distinction like this is found in the Greek manuscripts nor in the German translations."},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"The Greek manuscripts said \"kurios\" for Lord in Luke 16:8. This word is used in almost every place translated where they mean the Lord our God, or Lord Jesu s. Greek words like \"lord\" or \"father\" were not set apart with capitalization. The observant reader will be correct that this kurios could mean either Lord or lord. However, three things give evidence that kurios meant Lord Jesus in Luke 16:8. 1. First, the Lord Je sus told this story, because there was something commendable or some good example to commend there to his disc iples. 2. There is no period after verse 8 in the Gr eek manuscripts which means verse 9 is spoken with verse 8. Verse 9 reads, \"For the children of this world are in th eir generation wiser than the children of light.\" Even the King James has no peri od between verse 8 and 9. Now, does it seem likely the rich man said, \"the children of this world are in th eir generation wiser than the children of light.\"? The truth is simply the Lord who spoke the se ntence (which was numbe red by emn verse 8 and 9) was the Lord Jesus. 3. The Bible itself gives a distinction be tween where lord is (meaning the rich man) and where the Lord is meant. The story does not use the word \"kurios\" meaning the rich man once. Instead, it uses possessive words such as which translate where the steward is talking \"l ord of his\" or \"his lord\", and later lord of the steward. If Jesus had included verse 8 an d 9 in his story of the steward he would have used different word(s) for \"lord\" than just \"kurio s\". It seems evident that Luke wrote what \"the Lord (Jesus) commended in verse 8 and 9. QUESTION 3. Are the items in Ne h 5:10, 11 rent or interest? Nehemiah commanded that the Jews give back a hundredth pa rt of corn, wine and oil to their poor brethrn, is this hundredt h part rent or interest? Verse 10 calls it interest (usury) in English a nd Verse 11 does so in Luther's German trans. It is O.K. to accept that these verses in sc ripture have labelled it correctly, for to do so contradicts no other scripture.

ROTHSCHILD TALKS ABOUT THEIR DYNASTY Lord Rothschild in his book The Shadow of a Great Man quotes a letter sent from Davidson on June 24, 1814 to Nathan Rothschild, \"As long as a house is like yours, and as long as you work together with your brothers, not a house in the world will be able to compete with you, to cause you harm or to take advantage of you, for together you can unde rtake and perform more than any house in the world.\" 1 The closeness of the Rothschild br others is seen in a letter from Saloman (Salmon) Rothschild to his brother Nathan on Feb. 28, 1815, \"We ar e like the mechanism of a watch: each part is essential.\" 2 This closeness is furthe r seen in that of the 18 marriages made by Mayer Amschel Rothschild's grandchildren 16 were contracted between first cousins.

One of the Rothschilds in his will left money for ongoing building projec ts in Israel, and the Rothschilds are honored with a street named after them in Jerusalem.

The British were given a mandate over Palestine, and the Rothschilds were able to through their proxies in the British government, to create th e steps that led to the nation of Israel. 5 THE ROTHSCHILDS AS \"PROPHETS\" One item stands out as a person listens to the International Bankers and reads their books. They believe money is what makes the world go round. If you have mone y, you can do anything. Money is \"God\", and it is worshipped and served. Even after these families accumulate more than can be spent, these devotees continue selling their souls for this false but powerful god. The great poet-philosopher Heinrich Heine (a Ba nker's son) said, \"Mone y is the god of our time, and Rothschild is his prophet.\" 6 Following the cue of the Roth schilds, Heinrich Heine, a Jew, signed his name by drawing a Seal of Solomon. 7 Amsel Rothschild is reported to have said, \"G ive me control of the economics of a country; and I care not who makes her laws.\" 8 Today his descendents meet twice daily in London to dictate to the worl d what the world price of gold will be. They also dictate what the \"F ederal Reserve System\" will do with America's finances. ANOTHER GOD TOO According to eye-witnesses, who were prominent enough to visit one of the British Rothschild homes, the Rothschilds worship yet another god too, Satan. They set a place for him at their table. 8a The Rothschilds have been Satanists for many generations. The Rothschilds are an important part of the history of the Seal of Solomo n (also known as hexagram, Magen David, six-pointed star, Star of David.) The Seal of Solomon, the hexagram, was not considered a Jewish symbol before the Rothschilds began using it. 9 Throughout the Middle Ages the Seal of Solom on had been used by Arab Magici ans, Cabalist Magicians, Druid witches and Satanists. One of the few ancient uses of the symbol was on the floor of a 1,200 year old Moslem Mosque foun d where Tel Aviv is today. 10 In the twelve cent ury an Ashkenazic Jew Menahem ben Duji, who thought he wa s the Messiah, used the magical symbol. 11 Because the Rothschilds were Satanists th ey adopted this powerful magic symbol in 1822 for their coat- of-arms. The name they adopted for their family actua lly comes from the fact that in the 17th century Mayer Amschel Bauer bega n hanging out a red hexagram in front of their house to identify it. Mayer Amschel then decided to take the name red-schield (Rothschild in German) after the red Seal of So lomon that they used.

Does he do what he does for a real reason, or a single motive? Perhaps to label the Power as only Satanic or only Jewish or only Masonic is to neglect the personal human dimension. This personal human dimension is godless. Being godle ss it fills that void, by pretending its men are gods. This brings us right back to the Gnostic religions and Satan. Most Jewish people do not concern themselves with learning the occultic significance to their treasured Magen David (Star of David). King David did not have a nything to do with the hexagram, although his son Solom on did when he began worshippi ng Ashtoreth (star, also known as Astarte, Chiun, Kaiw an, Remphan, and Saturn). 12 Solomon built altars to Star (Astarte, aka Ashtoreth). The god Saturn is associated with th e Star but both Saturn and Astarte also been identified with a number of other names. Saturn is an important key to understanding the long heritage this conspiracy has back to antiquity. Th e city of Rome was origin ally known as Saturnia or City of Saturn. The Roman Catholic church reta ins much of the Saturn worship in its ritual. Saturn also relates to Lucifer. 13 In various occult dictionaries Sa turn is associated with evil. Saturn was important to the religion of Mithra, and also the Druids. CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD —connecti ons to JWs, Mormons, and Judaism It has been said all roads lead to Rome. Fo r this book, it could be said all paths of investigation lead to the Rothschilds. Charles T. Russell, in a 1891 lett er to Baron (Lord) Rothschild, mailed from Palestine, outlined possible courses of action that could be taken to establish the Jews in Pa lestine. Russell's letters praised the Rothschild's money which establishe d Jewish colonies in Palestine. Russell writes Rothschild, \"What is needed here , therefore, next to water a nd cleanliness, is a good government which will protect the poor from the ravenous and the wealthy. Banking institutions on sound bases, and doing business honorably, are also greatly needed.\" Russell continues, \"May the God of Jacob direct you, my dear Si r, and all interested with you in the deliverance and prosperity of Israel, and blessed will they be who, to any extent, yield th emselves as his servants in fulfilling his will as predicted.\" 14 When the Mormon Church needed financing in th e late 19th century, they went to Kuhn,Loeb Co. 15 To explain the Rothschild's control of Kuhn, Loeb Co. here is some background"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"information. The method th at the House of Rothschild used to gain influence, wa s the same that Royalty had used for centuries, ma rriage. The Rothschild children, girls and boys, have had their spouses chosen on the basis of alliances that would benefit the House of Rothschild, but since consolidating world power they generally have married cousins these last two centuries. 16 Jacob Schiff grew up in the house that the Rothschild's had at 148 Jude ngasse, Frankfurt. Jacob Schiff came to the United States with Rothschild capital and took ov er control of a small Jewish banking concern founded by two Cincinnati dr y goods merchants Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb. He even married So loman's daughter. In 1885, Loeb re tired, and Schiff ran the Kuhn, Loeb Co. for the Rothschilds un til 1920 when he died. 17 During Russell's and Brigham Young's day, Lord Rothschild was consider ed the \"lay leader of world Jewry.\" 18 Edmund Rothschild was President of the Jewish Colonization Association, 19 which was a major Zionist group. Amselm Rothschild indicated that his grandfather Amschel Mayer Rothschild had insisted in Clause 15 of his will to his children, \"may they and their descendants remain constantly true to their ancestral Jewish faith.\" 20 However, the will has been secret and there is no wa y of knowing what it says. The Rothsc hilds have not remained true to the Orthodox faith. If this was actually what Clause 15 said then something is amiss. The Jewish world has showered the Rothschilds w ith praises, \"The Rothschilds govern a Christian world. Not a cabinet m oves without their advice. They stretch their hand, with equal ease, from Petersburg to Vienna , from Vienna to Paris, from Pa ris to London, from London to Washington. Baron Rothsch ild, the head of the house , is the true king of J udah, the prince of the captivity, the Messiah so long looked for by th is extraordinary people....T he lion of the tribe of Judah, Baron Rothschild, possesses more real fo rce than David—more wisdom than Solomon.\" 21 The Prieure de Sion-the Elders of Sion 22 also relates to the Roth schilds who are reported to serve on a Jewish council of Elders of Sion. 23 The Rothschilds have \"helped\" the Jewish people the Rothsch ild's own way. For those who admire stingyness, the Rothschild s will be greatly looked up to. For instance, the extent of James Rothschild's charity in Fr ance to poor Jews was 5 francs (the equivalent of $1). 24 Their dynasty has destroyed honest Jews along with Christia ns. Today, few dare cr iticize the Ro thschilds. CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD—conn ections to secret societies The Rothschilds had play ed a major role in th e Bavarian Illuminati, 25 and it is known that a least one of the sons of Amsel was a member. As the reader remembers, Amsel placed his sons in the major European capitals, where they each set up the princi pal banking houses. By their own secret intelligence service and their own news network they c ould outmanouver any European government. 26 The large amounts of voluminous correspondence by Rothschild couriers attracted attention, 27 but no one ever stopped their personal intelligence and mail services. After the Bavarian Illuminati were exposed, the central occult power over the European secret societies shifted to Carbonar ism a.k.a. the Alta Vendita, 28 led by another powerful Rothschild, Karl Rothschild, 29 son of Amschel. In 1818, Karl participated in a secret document that was sent out to the head-quarters of Masonry from the Al ta Vendita. The Masons were quite distressed when a copy of this was lost, and offered reward s to anyone who could return the lost copy. It was originally written in Italian. Its title translates \"Permanent In structions, or Pr actical Code of Rules; Guide for the Heads of the Highest Grades of Masonry.\" 30 The Masonic reference book 10,000 Famous Freem asons, Vol. 4, p.74, indicates two other sons of Amschel were Masons, James Meyer Rothschild , and his brother Nathan Meyer"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"Rothschild. James Rothschild in Paris was a 33 degree Scottish Rite Ma son, and his brother Nathan in London was a member of the Lodge of Emulation. And Jewish Freemason Katz indicates Solomon Meir Rothschild, a third memb er of the five brothers, was initiated into Freemasonry on June 14, 1809. 31 The Rothschilds became pow erful within Freemasonry. We find the Saint-Simonians, the occult relig ious millenialist forerunners of communism, praising Baron de Rothschild in their magazine Le Globe, \"There is no one today who be tter represents the triumph of equality and work in the nineteenth century than M. le Baron de Rothsch ild....Was this Jew bom a millionaire? No, he was born poor, and if only you knew what genius, patien ce, and hard work were required to construct that European edifice called th e House of Rothschild, you would admire rather than insult it.\" Lionel de Rothschild (the de wa s added by the French Rothschild s) was involved with the first communist Internationale. The Mason Mazzini who helped start communism praised Rothschild, \"Rothschild could be King of France if he so desired.\" 32 Adolphe Cremieux, was a french Jewish Mason (see chap. 1.4 for his credentials). The Rothschilds gave at least £ 1,000 to Cremieux to go to Damascus with Salomon Munk, and Sir Moses Montefiore to win the release of Jews imprisoned there, and to convince the Turkish Sultan to declare the charge s of ritual murder false. 33 According to the three Jewish authors of Dope, Inc. the B'nai B'rith was a spin-off of the Order of Zion and was organized as a \"covert intelligence front\" fo r the House of Rothschild. It is highly probable that the B'nai B'rith wa s used as a Rothschild intelligence cover. The Rothschilds are prominen t in the Bilderbergers too. The Rothschilds were closely related to the Council of Fore ign Relations (CFR). Although many people today would not view the CFR as a secret society it was originally set up as part of a secret society and it was kept secret for ma ny years, in spite of its awesome power. Carroll Quigley, professor of Internati onal Relations at the Jesuit Geor getown University, exposed the Round Table Group with his book Tragedy and Hope. 24 The Rothschilds supported Rhodes to form De Beers. 35 Later, Rhodes made seven wills which established a secret society mode lled after the Jesuits and Masons to help bring in a One-World- Government centered upon Britain , and the Rhodes Scholarships. 36 The inner group was established in Mar. 1891 and c onsisted of Rhodes, Stead, Lord Esher (Brett), and 33° Mason Alfred Milner. 33bb A secondary circle of \"potential member s of the Circle of Initiates\" consisted of the Jew Lord Balfour, Sir Ha rry Johnson, Lord Rothschild, Lo rd Grey and others. Initially, Lord Rothschild was part of the inner group of Rhode's secret society, but was replaced by his son-in-law Lord Rosebury who wasn't as conspicuous. 37 The Fabian Socialists dominated the staff at Oxford when the Rhodes Scholars be gan arriving. These scholars then received indoctrination and preparation to become part of an interna tional socialist New World Order. 38 The Round Table Group developed fro m the inner executive circle of Rhode's secret society. The outer circle was established after the star t of the 20th century. The Round Table Group was extended after W.W. I by organizi ng a front organization the Roya l Institute of International Affairs. The Council of Foreign Rel ations was the American part of this front. The inner circle continues to direct the outer circ le and its two front organizations RIIA and CFR. The CFR in turn set up a number of fronts including the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR)."},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD—management of the Catholic and Czars' wealth and the capture of the Orthod ox Church's wealth Early in the 19th century the Pope came to the Rothschilds to borrow money. The Rothschilds were very friendly with the Pope , causing one journalist to sarcas ticly say \"Rothschild has kissed the hand of the Pope...Order has at last been re-established.\" 39 The Rothschilds in fact over time were entrusted with the bulk of the Vatican's wealth. The Jewish Ency., Vol. 2, p.497 states, \"It is a somewhat curious se quel to the attempt to set up a Cat holic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time (1 905) the latter are the guardia ns of the papal treasure.\" Researcher Eustice Mullins writes that the Rothschilds took ove r all the financial operations of the worldwide Catho lic Church in 1823. 40 Today the large banking and financial business of the Catholic Church is an extensive system interlocked with the Rothsc hilds and the rest of the International Banking system. The great wealth of the Russian Czars was entrusted to the Rothschilds, $3 5 million with the Rothschild's Bank of England, and $80 million in the Rothschild's Pari s bank. The Rothschilds financed the Russian Revolution which confiscate d vast portions of th e Orthodox Church's wealth. They have been able to prevent (due to their power) th e legitimate heirs of the Czars fortune to withdraw a penny of the millions deposited in a variety of their banks. The Mountbattans, who are related to the Rothschilds, led the court battles to prevent the claimants from withdrawing any of the fortune. In other wo rds, the money they invested in the Russian Revolution, was not only paid back directly by the Bolshevists in millions of dollar of gold, but by grabbing the hugh deposits of the Czars' wealth, the Rothsch ilds gained what is now worth over $50 Billions. 41 CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD—CONTRO L OVER SATANISM & WITCHCRAFT Chapter 2.11 gives the names of a Witchcraft C ouncil of 13 which is under Rothschild control and in turn issue orders to vari ous groups. One of the purest form of Satanism can be traced to the Jewish Sabbatain sect and its Frankist spinoff. The leaders of this up to the Ro thschilds were: Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676) Nathan of Gaza (16??-?) Jacob Frank (1726-1791) Rothschilds Three connections between Satanism, evil, and money. Money naturally attracts itself to evil. For instance, if a wo man prostitutes herself she may receive a great sum of money, but who will pay her for keeping her virginity or her dignity? If you are a hit man a large amount of money is yours if you kill your target, who will pay you if you would miss your target? Second, evil men believe in where there is a will there is a way, and they are willing to sell their souls for their God money. Th ey will employ evil to gain money. While most people are quite aware of these la st two connections, a third may likely have escaped their attention. Thirdly, the principle group of men who cranked up International Banking were Satanists from the beginni ng. These Satanists now are the ones who run the Federal Reserve and are responsible for the creation of U.S. Fede ral Reserve notes. Just having total control over the supply of U.S. paper money almost gives th em leverage over the world's finances, without mentioning they control the world bank. It is no a ccident then, that once they established world financial control, they would do all in their power to divide and conquer and destroy both the"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"Christian and the Moslem faith in God. These pow erful Bankers relate to faith in God as Cain related to his brother Abel. That they may be related to the Je wish people, does not mean they have the Jewish people's best interest at heart. Initially Sabbetai Zevi was reject ed by many Jews. His sect gained momentum in second half of the seventeenth century in southeastern Poland. 42 In 1759-60, 500 Jewish Sabbateans \"converted\" to Christianity. 43 In 1715, 109 of the 415 Jewish families in Fra nkfurt were engaged in moneylending. The rest were merchants of various kinds. The concepts that Satanism holds to were a natural shoe in to justify for many of these Jewish bankers the type of behavior th ey were engaged in. 44 LONG-STORY SHORT Many divisions and battles between religious elements in the world have been encouraged and supported by the Power's wealth. Unfortunately, ma ny have been fooled into thinking that being devout and faithful to God is the source of reli gious fighting. In some areas of the world, Moslems, Christians, and others have gotten along fine for centuries. Religious tensions do spring to some degree from within the religions themselves , but the fuel to keep those fires burning and to light up conflicts often come from the Powe r's wealth. An obvious example is the Iran-Iraq war. CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD—CO NTROL OVER W.W. I TREATY When Germany fell, not only did Rothschild agen ts draft the treaty, prepare the idea of the League of Nations, but Max Roth schild was one of 11 men who took control over Bavaria. Max Rothschild was a Freemason in Lodge No. 11, Munich, Germany. CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD—connections to MI 5, Rockefellers, J.P. Morgan, CFR, et. al. Victor Rothschild, who worked for J.P. Morg an & Co., and was an im portant part of MI5 (British Intelligence). Victor Roth schild was also a communist a nd member of the Apostles Club at Cambridge. 45 Lord Rothschild was one of the original members of Rhode's R ound Table group which developed into the CFR. It was the Rothschild s who had financed Cec il Rhodes, beginning in Africa. The Rothschilds' have several agents which their money got started and who still serve them well, the Morgans and the Rockef ellers. The Rockefellers were Marrano Jews. The original Rockefeller made his money selling narcotics, (they weren't illegal then). After acquiring a little capital he branched out in oil. But it was the Ro thschild capital that made the Rockefeller's so powerful. \"They also financed the activities of Edward Harriman (railroads) and Andrew Carnegie Steel.\" 46 CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD— Power within Christendom The Rothschilds also wielded much influence and power not only in Secret Societies, but also in Christendom's churches. The Salvation Army under the suggestion of the Rothschilds adopted the Red Shield (Roth-red Schild-shield) for their logo."},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"One history of the Rothschilds remarks, \"The Rothschilds had rapidly propelled themselves into a position of immense financial power and po litical influence. They were an independent force in the life of Europe, accountable to no on e and, to a large extent, reliant on no one. Popular lampoons depicted them as the real rulers of Christendom...\" 47 Some of the Rothschilds have been involved in the camp aign to loosen public morals. The first executive Secretary of the Nati onal Student Forum was John Roth schild. This National Student Forum changed its name like articles of clothing. Sp eaking about clothing, one of the aims of this Socialist group was to promote public nudity, a nd free love. This organization had the following constituent groups Radcliffe Liberal Club, Union Theological Seminary Co ntemporary Cl ub, Yale Liberal Club 48 to name just a few. A further developm ent of this was the Youth Peace Federation which consisted of the League of Youth of Co mmunity Church, Methodist Epworth League, NY District, Young Judea, and Young Peop le's Fellowship of St. Phillip's Parish 49 to name a few. American religious men have ties to the Rothsc hilds especially through their various agents. Harry Emerson Fosdick, who was Pa stor of Rockefeller's church was also among the Presidents of the Rockefeller Foundation. John Foster Dulle s, CFR, was chairman of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation, and married a Rockefelle r, Janet Pomeroy Avery. Remember John Foster Dulles was an important Federal Council of Ch urches of Christ official.(See chap. 2.9) Every road leads back to the Rothschilds. There are more items than what have been mentioned above linking the Rothsc hilds to the various tenticles. Each of the various tenticles th at conspiracy theorists have put forth,—the Jews, the Masons, the Intelligence Communities, the International Bankers, the Prie ure de Sion, the Catholics, the Trilateral commission, the CFR, the New Age, th e Cults— each ties back to the Roth schild's power. EXTENT OF ROTHSCHILD POWER According to one source \"it was es timated that they controlled ha lf the wealth of the world.\" 50 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was c ontrolled by five banks which owned 53% of its stock. These five banks were controlled by Nathan M. Rothschild & Sons of London. Control over the U.S. Fed is basically control over the world's money. That fact alone shows how immense the Rothschild Po wer is. If one examines who has been appointed to head the Fed, and to run it, the connections of the \"Federal\" Reserv e System to the Rothsch ilds can further be seen. Another private enterprise using the name Federa l that the Rothschilds al so direct is Federal Express. Any one else might be taken to court for making thei r businesses sound like their are government, not the Rothschilds. It is appropriate for th em to appropriate the name of Federal, because by way of M16 via the CIA they instruct the U.S. government. Senators are bought and paid off by their system, as inves tigators of the BCCI are discovering. The Rothschilds have been intimately involved in witchcraft and the Illuminati since its early known history. The Kaiser of Ge rmany seems to refer to them wh en he said, \"the magic powers of money as wielded by the Lord of Lucre are powers of Black Magic at its blackest.\" 51 If only half of the wealth is c ontrolled by the Rothschilds, it indi cates that if they are to be part of the world's rulershi p, they must have allies. ALLIES The Rothschilds and Rockefelle rs are only two of thirteen controlling families of the Illuminati. 52 "},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"Two Jewish families that appear to be prom inent are the Oppenheims and the Oppenheimers. A. Oppenheim was situated in Cologne. The Oppe nheimers were early memb ers of the Bavarian Illuminati. The Bund der Gerechten (League of the Just) was an Illuminati front run mainly by Jews who were Satanists. This Bund financed in part by the Roth schilds paid the Satanist and Mason Karl Marx to write the Communist Mane festo. The Jew Gumpel Oppenheim was in the inner circle of the Bund. His relative Hein rich Oppenheim masterminded the communist revolution of 1848 in Germany. The Communist Part y's official histories even accept the Bund as the predecessor of Communism. The Oppenheimers apparently are close to the Rothschilds. J. Robert Oppenheimer of the CFR was exposed as a communist. Harry Oppenheimer, an international banker, is chairman of the Jewish De Beers world-wide diamond monopoly, and chairman of the Anglo-American Corp. Oppenheimers can be found in im portant financial positions in the U.S. They help run around 10 large foundations, including the Oppenheimer Haas Trust of NY for the care of needy Jewish children. The Jewish Ency. Vol. 2, p. 496 indicates other Jewish families \"adopted the Rothschild plan.\" These were the Lazards, Stems, Speyers, and Selig mans. The Rothschild plan was to place family members in the 5 largest European capitals to coordinate their activitie s. One of Germany's largest magazines is the Stern, and Ernst Stem is second-in-command of the World Bank. 53 The Jewish families that established the Frankf urt Judenloge (this was the Masonic lodge the Rothschilds belonged to in Frankf urt) included the Adlers, Speyer s, Reisses, Sichels, Ellisons, Hanaus, Geisenheimers, and Go ldschmidts. Isaac Hildesheim, a Jew who changed his name to Justus Hiller is credited as being the founder of this Frankfurt lodge. Michael Hess, principal of the Reformed Jewish school Philanthropin was an important figure in the lodge too, as was Dr. Ludwig Baruch (later Borne) who joined in 1808. Most of these Frankfurt Jewish Freemasons engaged in commerce. 54 Those Freemasons from 1817-1842 we re the leaders of the Frankfurt Jewish community. 55 A gentile Mason in Frankfurt Johann Christia n Ehrmann began warning the German people that the Frankfurt Jewish Masons wanted a wo rld republic based on humanism. In 1816 he came out with a warning pamphlet Das Judenthum in der M[aurere]y (The Jews in Masonry). A powerful ally of the world's Jewry can be seen beginning with men like Oliver Cromwell, who was considered a Mason. Cromwell was financed by Jews, and helped the Jews gain pow er in England. Cromwell was willing to go along with the Jews, because he be came convinced of British Israelism. Since the core of the conspiracy of power is Jewish, the attitude of those allied with it hinges on their attitude toward the Jewish people. The religious idea that the British people are descended from the tribes of Israel doesn't automatically place people into th e camp of the conspiracy. Some of the British-Israelites realize that the so called Jewish people in general have no claim over the promis es of God. For that reason, they realize that it is not the Christian duty to bow and scrape at their every move. When Christians can be arrested in Israel and abused , and Christians will not even stand up for their own kind, we can see how much hold the id ea of the \"Chosen Ra ce\" theory has over Christendom. Some of the British Israelites su ch as the Mormons, the old New England wealthy families such as make up the Or der, some Masons and New Ager s, and the non-Jewish members of the Priuere de Sion are collaborating with th e One-World-Power. The anglican church which is run by the Freemasons is strongly British Israelistic."},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"SORTING OUT THE VARIOUS IDENTITY GROUPS In contrast, a hodge-podge of groups which are oppos ed to the conspiracy like some Neo-Nazi groups, and various Churches unrel ated with them are also believe rs in British Israelism. These various groups are sometimes all lumped toge ther as the \"Identity\" movement, which is misleading because of their vast differences. It is important to diferentiate between those groups that are trying to approach things from a Chri stian perspective and place themselves under the authority of God, and those who are setting them selves up under the New Order's authority, or under their own authority. CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD- The Media Eustice Mullins has published his research in his book Who Owns the TV Networks showing that the Rothschilds have control of all three U. S. Networks, plus other aspects of the recording and mass media industry. It can be a dded that they control Reuters too. From other sources it appears CNN, which began as an independent cha llenge to the Jewish Network monopoly, ran into rep eated trickery, and ended up pa rt of the system. Money from B.C.C.I.,(B.C.C.I, has been one of the New World Orders financial systems for doing its dirty business such as controlling Congressmen, and is involved with INSLA, th e Iran-Contra Scandal, Centrust, and other recent scandals) which has ta inted so many aspects of public power in the U.S. has also been behind CNN. Perhaps nothing dominates the lif e of some Americans as does the television. Americans sit themselves before the television se t and simply absorb what it pr ojects to them. On a day to day basis the biggest way the Rothschilds touch the liv es of Americans are the three major networks which are under Rothschild direction. To illustrate this we will examine who run th e networks. This list is not current, and no attempt was to provide that. The length of writing a book insures that some material will be dated anyway.

I prefer paraphrase and make short quotes fro m her book, because I am trying to document for the reader the mindset and history of the Rothschilds. A nka Muhlstein has nothing against the Rothschilds, so it will be easier for the read er to accept what she says about them than from me. I can't require the reader to read her book, but I can tr y to summarize some of the appropriate thoughts. Other books also relate many of the things A nka does, but again if I write a footnoted article, it will not carry the wei ght as my paraphrase will. The reader is recommended to read the book first hand if he has the time a nd is interested in the details of James' life. The Jews in the 18th century were restricted to living in Ghe ttos. Mayer Amschel Rothschild lived in the Frankfurt ghetto, (p .22) The Jews were re pressed by outsiders. (p .23) They lived in geographically isolated and se lf-contained communities (p. 24). The Jewish communities in Europe used a secret relay system between all th e Ghettoes. Hebrew charact ers were one effective code. (p.24) Because of the persecution and repres sion, the Jewish communities were very tight- knit and highly organized.(p.23) They were deeply hostile to the Christian people. Christians had restricted their own pe ople from money-lending wi th interest, so lending money on interest had become a Jewish enterprise. The German princes of T hurn and Taxis in the 16th century initiated a postal service. Mayer Amsche l loaned them money. (p.21) \"Certainly they [the Rothschilds] discovered the latitude that the Thurn and Taxis allowed themselves in unsealing letters, possibly divulgi ng their contents, and according to their own interests, delaying or ac celerating delivery.\"(p.22) When it profited Mayer Amschel, he would hire Christians , but in general his business and banking were conducted by his close knit family . For instance Mayer Amschel hired a young Christian woman to write his letters for him.(p. 25) Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his family were wh oleheartedly Jewish.(p.27) Mayer Amschel Rothschild picked his sons' wifes for the busin ess gains the wives would bring the family. The"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"oldest son was not happy with this (actually he was bitter because he was denied marriage to the woman he loved), but he complied with his father 's choice.(p.26) Amschel' s daughters all married bankers—in Worms, Sichel, and Beyfus.(p.26) Mayer had ten children and they were all employed in the fam ily business. (p.25) The Jews were taught from childhood up, that the Christians were to blame for all their woes, an d that the Christians were to be feared and detested.(p.24) Mayer Amschel had secret, unde rground passages. (p.22) His carriage was honey-combed with secret draw ers. (p.27) The Napoleonic War greatly helped the Rothschild business.(p. 27) Rothschild even outsmarted Napoleon—because the Rothschilds had such good connections.(p.38) The Rothsch ilds smuggled during the English blocade of Napoleon's Europe, and made millions.(p.3 3) \"The Rothschilds cha nged course consta ntly during this period, always manuevering to avoid any kind of political commitment.\"(p.34) One of the things Mayer Amschel set up, was to disperse his 5 sons to the major capitals of Europe. Anka attributes the respectibility of Jewish m oney lending to the help it gave merchants and entrepreneurs. [See chap. 3.2 -this Author's vi ew is that merchants had been borrowing for centuries prior to interest taking becoming acce ptable by society in the 19th century. It was greatly in part due to who owned and controlled the major newspapers in the 19th century—Jews and Masons—that led the public to change.] \"T he obligation to reimburse a loan and to pay interest became less onerous to men whose affair s had flourished as a result of the borrowed money. The Jewish lender ceased to be a bloodsucker; of ten, indeed, he beca me an associate of the borrower.\"(p.31) [The Bible sa ys a borrower is a slave to the lender, hardly an association to be desired.] The business of financing Monarchs was lucra tive. The Rothschilds had developed several traits in the ghetto that made their family hard to stop. \"The great gift the Frankfurt ghetto bestowed upon him [Jam es Rothschild] was adaptibility, a quality matched by the driving force of his ambi tion, his prodigious energy, tremendous powers of concentration, and determination to get even [with Christians].

It is a fairly straightforward question. Tell me which country I am describing? —your ch oices are Nazi Germany and the United States. This country backs their schools with their police. Thei r textbooks are updated and rewritten. Teachers are required to join a national league. Te achers are required to report parents and other non-school violations. The emphasis is more on ideology than academics. There are declining test scores. The training of teacher s is vested in the state where su ch universities indoctrinate the state's philosophy to the future teachers. Mora ls were declining. Th ere were new freedoms. Immorality was heralded in the schools. The textbooks were full of falsehoods. Parents refusing to participate in the compulsary education were jailed or kille d. Teachers be gan giving blind support to the state. With what I know, I would have to say it desc ribes both Nazi Germany and the United States. How did you answer? Changes are coming one after another, they come gradual enough that unless people pull themselves out of their own context and get a broader look, people may inaccurately evaluate themselves. THE MASONS & KLAN SURPRISE OREGON Early one June morning in 1922, Ku Klux Klan smen and Freemasons ma de their way quietly to public areas throughout Oregon. At 8 a.m. sharp they began quickly to gath er signatures from citizens for a \"Compulsary Education Bill\" that they told signers would make public school education compulsary for all \"children between the ages of eight and sixteen years.\" 1 Many of the signatories would later feel they had been deceived by th e men carrying out this surprise campaign. 2 Of the 50,000 signatores that the Mas ons would boast they had collected by the end of the day, only 29,000 signatures were actually collected, and 13,000 of those were rejected as illegal or duplications. That left 16, 000, yet, only 13,000 were needed to place it on the Oregon ballot. 3 The Bill was a well-thought out campaign by the Scottish Rite Lodge's leadership to bring education under the control of the state. They had obtained pe tition sheets, and quietly passed these out to lodges around Oregon , and to sympathetic fraternal organizations such as the K.K.K. The co-author of the Bill was the Knights of the K.K.K.'s leader. 4 Most of the paid advertising in the state was over the signature of \"P.S. Malc om, 33°, inspector-general in Oregon, Ancient & Accepted Scottish Rite.\" PAROCIAL SCHOOLS Originally, Christian churches had started th e schools in early Oregon. Church run schools were still in abundance in 1922, and flourished be side the public schools. The language of the Bill was subtly worded to begin a process to eliminate the role of the church in education. As there was already a compulsary school law th e public advertisements (almost all public ads were paid for by the Masonic Lodges) were misl eading. People initially were led to believe the"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"bill was only about making child ren attend public school. Once the public got an honest chance they saw it for what it was. The Oregon Voter said, \"It is as an admendment to the Compulsa ry Education Law that this initiative bill comes before the public, although it is aimed at Catholic parochial schools and includes all denominational and private schools in its sweeping abolition. \" (The Oregon Voter, Portland, Or., July 15, 1922, p.8) The Masons made this appeali ng pitch, \"Our children must not under any pretext...be divided into antagonistic groups, there to absorb th e narrow views of life as they are taught.\" Supposedly, parochial schools create a citi zenship of \"cliques, cults, and factions.\" 5 Strange, Christians are berated at one moment for wanti ng everyone to believe the same and are portrayed as obviously at odds with our wonderful diverse cu ltural heritage, yet at other times they are berated for being devisive. Oh for consistency. Another Masonic ploy was to wave the flag. They pretended that they wanted the bill to pass to prom ote Americanism. P.S. Malcolm, 33°, who led the campaign said, \"The establishment of high standards of edu cation in our public schools, the teaching of American principles and ideals, and the compul sory public school atte ndance in the primary grades, is a nationwide Masonic movement.\" 6 In one ad, Malcom urges voters to vote for the Bill in the interest of \"One Flag—One School- -One Language.\" 7 Although the call to American Patriotism worked, it was a deception on the part of the higher Masonic leadership—who had for many years pr omoted the elimination of all nationalism. 8 Even while waving the flag to in sure passage of this Bill, they were working hard to destroy all forms of Nationalism and to st rengthen the League of Nations. On Oct. 26, 1922 the readers of the News of Springfield, OR (along with other newspaper reader across Oregon) read a mas onic paid ad in favor of the B ill which said, \"At present, while the private schools are few and small, is the ti me to make the change proposed by the public school bill.\" \"The Ladies of the Invisible Empire\" (the fe male branch of the K.K.K.) campaigned to get women voters, many who had not vot ed before to vote for the bill. 9 The origins of the Bill were the Scottis h Rite and that was openly admitted. The reason for selecting Oregon for the campai gn, was stated by the Mason Robert F. Smith, It is not that there is any immediate and particular danger here. But in the East the number of foreign born and indifferent people is so overwhelming that such a bill as this one could never be put thro ugh. In accordance with the wishes of the supreme council of the Scottish Rite, therefore, we ar e beginning in Oregon, to set an example for the rest of the country. 10 This Author would add that it certainly didn't hurt the Masonic campaign that Oregon has been under strong Masonic control since its inception. Al most all of the Oregon governors have been Freemasons 11 , and a large portion of the rest of the governing elements too. A large portion of Oregon's political power has always recided in the Masonic Lodge. 12 One Oregon Masonic Senator revealed that if he want ed to be elected to governor th e Mafia was capable of getting him elected. When he rejected the Mafia's help, he lost. 13 The Mafia and the Masonic Lodge have worked together in numerous instances."},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"When the Mason Oregon Senator Mark Hatfie ld wanted his daughter into Med school, a special admission rule happened to be passed to allow his daughter into the Oregon Health Sciences University. Two men on the admissions committee resigned in protest. The Oregonian didn't print their article on the scandal, until after Hatfield's reelection campaign suceeded. 14 The Senator reportedly said, \"I did not want he r to receive any spec ial consideration.\" 15 The power that would be involved for anyone to pass a special Med school admissions policy is not near as alarming as the power it would take for anyone to sque lch a scandal for over a year until an election was over. William F. Woodward, a Mason and a long-time sc hool board member, in a talk entitled \"Our public schools as a Masonic obj ective.\" given to the Unity a nd Mt. Hood Lodges (Feb. 24,1936) reported that, \"It may interest you, my Brothers, to know that in this District over forty-three per cent of teachers, supervisors and principals are members of our Mas onic Body.\" \"Now having thrust the Bible from our public schools as a textbook we must de pend upon untaught, though accepted, principles of conduct resting largely upon home influence and training, too often in these chaotic days, lacking...\" \"This must not be a Protestant, Jewish, Roman Catholic, Seven- Day Adventist, or any other particular type of religious nation.\" Woodward was correct that the home training is not what it should be, and since the Masons have kicked the Bible and its values out of th e schools, what has happe ned? Woodward's desire that this not be any particular type of religious nation has been strongly promoted. The Scottish Rite clearly state their position, \"Our constitutions and statutes permit, and indeed guarantee, the broadest range to religious liberty, bo th to the religious and the irreligious...we take great pride in them.\" 16 But the Scottish Rite felt that the early constitutions were too religious, and didn't assure total equality of religions. 17 The Scottish Rite led the battle to prohibit any public aid to sectarian schools, such as free text books, or public paid tran sportation to parochial school pupils. They worked hard to eliminate th e Bible, prayer, singing hymns, and release time programs by public schools for re ligious education. The obvious intent was to eliminate parochial schools, by making the competition be tween public and private schools unequal. Those who disagree with the values taught in the public schools are forced to support them. Why were the Masons so intent on the destruction of paro cial school? The intent of the Constution was to protect against any religion becoming the state, not the elimination of religious intruction. AN EXAMPLE OF MASONIC ATTITUDES A book written by 32° Mason Emme t McLoughlin Crime and Im morality in the Catholic Church was given a favorab le review in the official magazine of the Scottish Rite The New Age Magazine. The Arch-Mason N.S. Meese states, \"Children attendi ng only parochial schools grow to maturity spiritually stunted and morally illiterate and are prone to become neurotic, emotionally unbalanced, and troubled with anxiety and frustration.\" 17a MASONIC CONTROL OVER THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS Using Oregon as an example, just as this chapte r has done earlier, it ca n be pointed out that the Masonic talk boasting of their control ove r education is not to dismissed lightly. The president of the Or. State Teache rs Association is Tom Powers, Jr. a 32 degree Mason. A Masonic flier for the public, shows Matthew Prophet the Superintendent of Portland Public Schools working with a group of four Masons. A ma n's advisors can have a great influence."},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"The 33rd degree Freemason Williard E. Givens wa s the Executive Secretary of the National Education Association (NEA) for 17 years. Wh en he resigned he took over the prestigious Education Program of the Suprem e Council of the Scottish Rite. 18 What has the Masonic control and influence br ought our public schools? Under the disguise of the elimination of religion, they have revi ved the Mystery religions within our schools. The textbooks are being written to promote controll able slaves, who have a global view and a syncretic secular or gnostic New Age outlook. Is this last paragraph an overstatement? Not in the least. Much that is going on in the classrooms, seems to be hidden or not noticed by the parents. The Nort h American Montessori Teachers Association (NAMTA) re cognizes reincarnation. Maria M ontessori the founder of the Montessori system had ties to the Theosophical Soci ety. One of the big lead ers of the Montessori system is Elizabeth Clare Prophet. Church Universal & Triumphant runs Montessori schools for all ages of children. The Mont essori curriculum is New Age. The ideas of Hegel and John Dewey, ideas that the Illuminati have long promoted have been made the purpose of education. Hegel believed that people exist fo r the State, \"The State is the absolute reality and the individu al himself has objective existence, truth and morality only in his capacity as a member of the state.\" John Dewey, the father of our e ducational system, echoed this, and it is being echoed repeatedly by educ ators around the country. (John Dewey was by the way an original signer of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933, this idea man is his own god. He is officially on the record as anti-Christian. The Humanist Manifesto I of 1933 states that a new religion must be created, and th e Manifesto describes a picture of their desired New Age religion that is \"synthesizing\", and for \"the comple te realization of human personality\", etc. ) At this point I will quote two items that Sutton calls to our attention in America's Secret Establishment, that are echos of Hegel and John Dewey. \"It is now time for a new vision of ourselves, of man, of human nature and of human potential, and a new theory of politics and in stitutions premised upon that vision. What is that vision of Man? that the natural, whole, organismic human being is lovi ng...that man's basic thrust is towards community.\" —Assemblyman John Vasconce llos of California, Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Educa tion and the Education Goals Committee for the Calif. State Assembly. 19 \"We are committed to the idea of Education for Global Community. You are invited to help turn the commitment into action and mobilizing world education for development of a world community.\"—National Education Association. 20 The NEA is the largest profe ssional organization in the US, 21 and their leadership has repeatedly gone on record in favor of the goals of the One-World-State. \"It is with...sobering awareness that we about to change the course of American education for the twenty-first century by embracing the ideals of global community, the equality and interdependence of all peoples and nations, and education as a t ool to bring about world peace.\" 22 The book Educational Futures: Sourcebook I states children are to recei ve through education \"a whole variety of known quantum jumps of an evolutio nary/ revolutionary nature.\" 23 An example of a book advocating the New Order view is Edu cating for a New Millennium by Harold G. Shane. Interestingly, the present Secretary of Edu cation Lamar Alexander wants to create public schools under the auspices of the occultic Intern ational Financiers through their international corporations which plan to dominate the world. In discussing this he was asked, \"Would that school—or a school run by Xerox—be accountable to the public?\" \"Yes , because that school"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"would still be public in nature. It would have to meet the same high standards, and it would be accountable to some public institution. It w ould be good to experiment with something like that.\" 24 Masonic educators are speaking to church gro ups calming their fears about religion not being allowed in the schools. They scare the gullible Chri stians, \"If we allow Christianity to be taught, then the Satanists will demand the right to teach Satanism.\" 25 Personally, this Author would take his chance on that. As it is, Satanism and the New Age are being taught in the schools, and New Age recruiters are using the schools as recruiting centers. This is not conjecture, ex-New Agers have revealed this systematic recruiting program is going on in the schools. And the Ne w Order's plans are to introduce Bush's educational program—Globalis m 2000, which books will be overtly New Age, and so blatantly anti-Christian that the students will be asked to denounce Christianity. Bush who borrowed Alice Bailey's \"t housand points of light\" expression, us es her material as part of the Globalism 2000 curriculum. It is no coincidence, that Bush the self-proclaimed \"education\" President, and admirer of Bailey, emphasises education. Alice Ba iley in Externalization of the Hierarchy, (p.61) declares, \"T he most spiritual use now to be found in the world is the application of money to the purposes of educati on.\" Why does education ha ve such an overriding spiritual context? Because they are teaching th e New Order's Spiritual systems of Gnosticism, Humanism, and the New Age in th e school systems, and have been for much longer than people realize. The United States now has witches writing our curriculums. Although the same people who are secretly involved in ritual human sacr ifice are being called upon by our government to fashion the new curriculums, th e public is unaware of this. Their approach to sin (evil) is shown in a B ill Moyer's television special in late 1988 on the subject of evil. An array of men weighted down with the big credentials of academia paraded their intellectual thoughts on Moyer's special. The Biblical answer to sin, a tried and tested method that has worked millions of times wasn't discussed. Their talk boiled down to Mankind will overcome this problem with education. As these \"experts\" aren't aware of what sin is (according to the Lord of the Universe), it's not likely such men are ever going to solve the problem for us. Nor will the planned police state. In a new guide book that teachers are already being asked to read, An ti-Bias Curriculum Tools for EMPOWERING Young Children, tw o pages are spent teaching the Educators how to dispel the image that witches are evil. According to the book, the idea that witches are evil is \"so offensive, especially to many wome n.\" The teacher is instructed to say, \"What I know is that the real women we call witches weren't bad. They r eally helped people.\" The teacher is encouraged to teach halloween chants, to bring in books on witches and healers, etc. 26 If we look at just one public school in Oregon, we can see what has happened under Masonic direction. This school has replaced Christmas even ts and a Christmas party with a Winter Solstice Festival complete with Wizzards, witches, Dr uids, etc. The teachers in an all-teacher's conference gather in Mandalas (the form of a Witch's coven) and for such a meeting draw Mandalas (a form of Buddhist pr ayer). The Hindu third eye is ta ught in the class \"Math and the Mind's Eye\" —Course I & II, and in other classes as well. Chri stian ideas about marriage are obviously outdated, as teachers promote living togeth er unmarried to the students, and other ideas of sexual promiscuity. The following holidays are to be special events- The Russian Revolution's May Day, the Independence Day of Red China, Buddha's birthday, Mohammad's birthday, and"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"several Jewish religious holidays like Yom Kippur. What is blatan tly missing in this public school is anything about Christ or Chri stian holidays, such as Christmas. When one reads the new instructions to teac hers, the Anti-Bias Curriculum, there is a noticable absent item, that is any concern about bias against Ch ristianity. Devout Christians no matter what label they carry are in short suppy, and are one of the most persecuted ravaged groups. Many sincere believers in Jesus Christ, must suffer indignities fro m the hands of those who only pretend to be Christians. It seems to me to be very biased to remove Christmas celebrations and replace them with Druids and W itches, such as has been done in the school refered to in the proceeding para graph. This author is aware of other reported events in schools across this country which displayed the same ha te for Christianity and esteem for the pagan mystery religions, and its all done under the dis guise of religious freedom. This is actually according to the NEA's plans. Samuel Blumenfeld's book NEA: Trojan Hors e In American Education does a full blown expose on how the NEA has planned to create illite racy along with the Socialist One-World- Nation they are helping establish. Another of his books exposes how th e private schools were functioning fine in America be fore public schools began to pre dominate, and how they were supplanted by the actions of those opposed to God with the purpose of destroying religious values. Another example, students bei ng expelled for talking on thei r own time about after school Bible Studies, while their particular school had Sa tanic posters in the library. Incredible, yes but true. You will not find the Masons running ca mpaigns against Satanism and the Mystery Religions entering our schools, like they did agai nst Christianity. When Christians have called the ACLU to get support for legal action against th e introduction of the religion of Satanism into their School system, the ACLU was not in the least interested. The ma sk has come off, the leaders of the Masons and the ACLU are not inte rested in religious fr eedom, they have been interested in the systematic dest ruction of Christianity, and its prostitution to serve their goals toward a One-World-State. In the gifted school program, th e classes being given for our most gifted children, they are introducing them to the mystery religions on school time by what they call \"Phantasy Games Class.\" In American PE classe s they have the children chan ting mantras (a form of Hindu prayer.) 27 Many of the modern educational ideas within such a school are not even be realized by the general public as occultic. People get very defensive when one explains that psychology, which is considered a science, is but based on the o ccultic direction that Freud and Jung gave. Jung is openly recognized by occultists like the Rosicrucians as having been an illumined mind. 28 Freud was a drug addict. Jung got his information from a \"spirit guide.\"(What Chri stian's call a demon.) Jung was into mandalas. Jung wrot e a foreward to the book The I Ching. Jung was into astrology. He wrote a commentary on The Tibetan Book of th e Dead. He says that \"to it I owe not only many stimulating ideas and discoveries but also ma ny fundamental insights.\" 29 This great Jewish mystic Jung, an associate of Freud, gave us much of the foundation of modern psychology. Leaders of the religion of psychology such as Maslow, Rogers, and Fromm all took their \"trip East\" into occultism. 30 Those who are associated with the Theosophical Society, for in stance, would be aware of Jung occultic connections, because the Society's catolog of Quest books advertis es Jung and the Lost Gospels, Jungian Synchronicity in Astrological Signs and Ages, and Gnostic Jung and the Seven Sermons of the Dead."},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":" IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT THE N.E.A .'S MAGAZINE HAS THE UP-SIDE DOWN SATANIC PENTAGRAM ON THEIR COVER.

THE NEW WORLD ORDER'S PUBLIC EDUCATION A prominant figure in the creati on of the public school system (and its secular ways) was the Mason DeWitt Clinton (1769-1828) of NY. Some consider him th e father of the system. In began to establish the system while he was mayor of New York after 1802. Another pioneer in the idea of public education was Horace Ma nn, a Unitarian in Mass., and also possibly a Mason, in 1837. Up to that time education had b een private, with parents sending their children to the parochial or private school of their c hoice. Mann had the school books rewritten to exclude all references to God or the Bible. Consequently, valuable cultura l knowledge has been never been taught in the public schools, so that students could understand much of the re ligious thought the underlie s so much of Western History. Further, the first three great spiritual aw akenings which pored over this nation with such profound effect are not even mentioned, even though their historical impact should not be ignored. The first spiritual awakening led to the f ounding of six of the nine colonial colleges. The third prior to the Amer. Civil Wa r was part of a profound new revi val that led people to realize the institution of slavery was evil. \"PUBLIC\" SCHOOLS DID MORE THAN JUST ELIMINATING CHRISTIANITY The people who gave us \"public\" education did mo re than just eliminate Christianity from the curriculum. They set out to give us their saniti zed version of history. History was rewritten in order to hide incidents that would expose their long standing conspiracy to rule not just the United States, but the world. The profound Masoni c influence on \"public\" education can't readily be seen, because they ar e a secretive organization."},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"This Author would like to have the space a nd time here to expose how public education and our history have long been under the One-Worl d-Power, but it simply is beyond the scope of this book. Others, like Antony Sutto n, have laid some groundwork in understanding their control. In his blockbuster America's Secret Establishment, he has an excellent ch apter on how the Order has influenced education. They established the American Historical A ssociation. Rockefeller has pumped millions of dollars into a an ongoing campaign to keep the hi story books written as th ey want them to be. The Rockefeller Foundation admits in their Annual Report, 1946, p.188, that they are subsidizing corps of historians to prevent anyone from rewriting history. Under the supervision of Mason administrators, and others that coopera te with the New World Order, the New Age movement has done considerable indoctrin ation already in the public schools. The author knows fi rst hand details on this. Perhaps one of the most import ant cover-ups is of their tota l control of our governmental functions. In order to do this, they have shamel essly rewritten the history books. They have not had to destroy documentation, the American public are so sheep-like that the evidence exposing their historical perversions lay just be neath the surface for anyone to discover. Hold onto your chair. You are going to read ite ms that may make you ve ry angry. Your anger may be directed at this Author for attacking some of the myths of history that you will not comfortly want to discard. Many Christians will become embittered because they want to believe in such myths as George Washington was a great Christian. They need to understand that these myths are perpetuated by the system to cover what has historically happened. For instance, many almanacs and history books record Nixon as a Quaker. What a distortion of the truth. These smokescreens effectively hide from the Public's vi ew the enormous centralized power of the New Order. Their power is such that the results of major elections are preord ained. Every four years an expensive ritualistic fraud is perpetrated on th e American public, as the people fool themselves that they select and self-govern themselves. At this point, this Author won't prove that item to you, it is a statement of fact, but you can disbelieve it if you want. What this Author would like to do is to go back to the start of this natio n. Let's go back to the beginning so to speak. It is important to distort U.S. history from the very beginning, because from there most of us take off on the wrong track. This Author is going to ask the reader to check out these items about the Amer. Revolution for himself. Good American historians know the truth of what I am writing you, the information just never filters down to th e common person. (Likewis e, Masonic historians know of the Masonic involvement in history. They brag about their involvement to themselves, but the information doesn't filter down to the common person.) This Author wishes he had a dollar for everytim e he had seen a cartoon, or sitcom, or other media show that represents the Boston Tea Party as an attack against high taxes. The Boston Tea Party is a favorite of their di stortions. The Boston Tea Party is believed by most Americans to have been an act of defiance against a high Tea Tax. Actually, the Tea Tax Act had cut taxes in half. So w hy would the colonials become angr y at a law that reduced taxes in half? The Masons who planned the Boston Te a Party in a Masonic Lodge were smuggling illegal tea. The reduced tax on legitimate tea (mak ing legal tea more competitively priced) would cut into their profits of their illegal smugglin g operation. Many, but not all of the men dressed as Indians, in the Boston Tea Pa rty were Masons. It was greed a nd lack of respect for the law that motivated their criminal act."},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"To quote one history book, \"Colonial trade would be controlled more strictly than ever before. British soldiers would be stationed in great numbers and live among the colonists. New taxes would draw money from the col onies to the mother country.\" What a great distortion of history. It sounds like the poor Americans we re being made to pay for their own oppression, and to surrender their hom es to the British Army. It is difficult to learn from our history books, that the real reason the British Army came was to protect the frontier after Pontiac's rebellion. The Br itish people were already paying hi gher taxes than the Americans and were having to bear most of the cost of de fending the American colonies. The colonists were given the chance to propose altern atives before the taxes were pa ssed, but they did not have any other solutions. One textbook states, \"Franklin and other agents fro m other colonies tried to persuade Grenville not to have the Stamp Act passe d.\" Actually, these representativ es of the colonies were as surprised as the British government by the negative American reac tion. It served an excellent purpose to allow what appeared to be an inno cent law to pass. The negative reaction was part of an orchestrated secret e ffort by the Masons in both Engl and and America to create an atmosphere of tension. They were working hard to get others involved. The British did ask that American s (remember Americans then were British citizens) to house British troops. That was a practice that all of the entire British empi re had to cooperate with. The conditions in those days, not only encouraged it, but almost demanded it. They did not have nail guns, and prefab military barracks in those days . With the housing and building situation in the colonies it was obviously the best solution, a nd most colonists did not object. (Actually, most British troops prior to the Revolution went to the British West Indies. During the Amer. Revolution the British kept a large military pres ence there against Spain and France, including large Naval forces because the We st Indies were to many British strategists more valuable to protect.) But isn't this making it sound like there wasn't any reason for a revolution? Wait, we're not finished yet. Before we look at why the Revolution happened, imagine what would have happened if it hadn't—the United States would be like the Amer ican colonies that didn't revolt—like Canada and the Bahamas. We might even be like Great Britain. If one exam ines the same textbooks that portray the British as villians in the Revolutionary War, when these textboo ks get to W.W. I and II, they portray Great Britian as a great democracy. We entered those wars, we were told, to save democracy. If Canada and Britian ca n be heralded as such great democracies now, and have the same government system as they did back then , why did we need a revolution for \"Freedom\"? The truth is we didn't. We needed a revolution for \"independence\", but not for freedom. For instance, King George (whose character is grossly misdrawn in Amer. history books) righteously created a Proclamation line to prot ect the Indians from the encroachment of the frontiermen. Many white men did not know how to respect treaties with the Indians. The primary reason the frontiermen were in favor of the revolu tion was so they could steal the Indian's land. Again if the history books mention this, they often tw ist the facts ever so sli ghtly to create a false impression. They make it seem like the Proclamation was irreversable. The Proclamation of 1763 was an excellent way to quell Indian trouble on the border. However, the textbooks falsely portray it as an irreversible act. It coul d repeatedly come up for reconsideration in 5 to 7 year periods. Schol ars have trashed the propoganda image of King George as a tyrant, although the textbooks haven't. If people want a tyrant King George, they have one in George Bush. The American King George has prom oted drug smuggling through the"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"CIA, etc. so that he can wage a trumped up wa r against drugs as a cover to take away our liberties, in step with th e New World Order's plans. Some textbooks try to portray the British as evil because they used the Indians as allies. Now why did the Indians want to fight for the King? Co uld it be he treated them better than the rough land hungry frontiersmen? Historians gloss over American colonial attempts to coax the Indians to fight on their side. The Revolutionary War's causes were complex. However, th e American textbooks purposely distort the facts. Events are rarely described in the context that they occured in. For instance, the events of the Revolutionary War occured in col onies that had had rules and regulations like the ones supposedly rebelled against for centuries (eve r since their foundings). Britian was trying to govern a world empire, and did not single out the Americans for abuse. Fe w writers portray what British colonial policy was, and what it was not. Its like hearing one side of the story. But because the American side of the story is very weak, (weak becaus e it was a manipulated conflict, like the Vietnam War), the American textbooks like to portray the colonists as universally against Britian. The Amer. Revoluti onary War wasn't any more popular than the Vietnam War. Two thirds of the people in the 13 co lonies were not in favor of it. One third of the colonists fought on the British side, and one third decided wise ly just to stay neutral and mind their own business. The northern colonies ( now Canada) completely rejected the revolution. If it hadn't been for Masonic connections in th e French government who fi nally intervened to bring France and Spain into the war, the American s might never have won. The fact is Yorktown was a defeat but not a decisive military defeat. Two large British ar mies remained in the field, and the large cities were secure in their control. The book the Temp le and the Lodge is the first book this Author is aware of, whic h goes into the historical deta ils of how the British Generals who were Masons, contributed to the American victory. The victory was not so much won by the colonists, as it was given them by lack of British enthusiasm. Patrick Henry's speech to the Virginia House, Ethan Allen's famous phrase \"in the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress, are two of the pure my ths that are told about these men. What was written by Thomas Paine as po litical propoganda, his Co mmon Sense, is taken by some as the gospel truth. The Freemason and itinerant whos e name was Mason Locke Weems (1760-1825) was according to Masonic and othe r sources the man who invented the George Washington and the Cherry Tree story. Let us be historically accurate. The Bost on Massacre was not like the American textbook image. What happened wa s typical of what has happened whenever troops are doing police work, and are being abused by a crowd. By the most accurate accounts, what happened was that after throwing rocks, oster shells, and abuse at the soldiers someone in the mob yelled a taunting \"fire\", and the soldiers (as soldiers obediently and automaticaly do under at tack) fired. This is not to justify the soldiers, but perhaps it will disp el the myth that this unfortunate incident was the result of a policy of oppression. It does s how that history repeats itself under similar circumstances (Kent State to name just one of many failures of soldiers to be police). If this seems unfairly Pro-British, let me point out that many leading colonial leaders of the future Amer. Revolution were sympathetic to the soldiers side and not the mob's. John Adams, future U.S. President, along with another famous future Revolutionist defended the soldiers in court. If the myth of the textbooks are right that it was British colonial oppression that caused the \"Boston massacre\", I would suggest that their aut hors should, to be consistent, advocate another revolution since Kent State."},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"Towns and cities where Masonic Lodges existed during the American Revolutionary War period from 1775 to 1789 are indicated on the map. Because the colonists in Washington's army came from different colonies, Washington used the Masonic lodge to wield his troops into a closer knit body of men. Military lodges were very numerous within the multitude of types of troops engaged. The book Temple and the Lodge tells the story of how the British Mason Generals followed ord ers, but showed little initiative in actually defeating the colonists. The Revolution was basically a Masonic show, with most of the Revolutionists ' initiatives and directives coming from Masons. To argue that Masons were on both sides, therefore they could not have been the initiators of the war, is as ludicrous as arguing that the Vietnamese were on both sides of the Vietnam war therefore the Vietnamese didn't initiate and plan it. The Vietnamese began their war even during W.W. II, and the Masons began their revolutionary planning even before Nathaniel Bacon, who the New Age Magazine (Apr. '64, p.43) calls \"a great lover of freedom.\""},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"Because Christian views have be en relegated to the trash h eap, we don't hear the rational voices of great Christian leaders of that Am erican Revolutionary time period who suggested peace, proper obedience to author ity, and that greed is evil. It is true that there were disagreements on how things should be done, between the colonists and Britian. There are major disagreements betw een Alaska and Washingt on,D.C. on how Alaska should be run. One poll showed a majority of Alaskans in favor of sucessi on. How would most American's feel if Alaska left the U.S.? The goal of Illumined Masonry was to destr oy all monarchies. To directly attack the institutions of Monarchies in various nations was difficult, because the on ly model the people had was to reestablish anothe r monarchy. The United St ates was design ed as their model, upon which the French and other revolutions would draw upon. There are numer ous hints that Great Britain and the United States were from th e time of the Revolution, intended to become the seat of world power. The Monroe Doctrine actually was not to protect the Americas, but in actual practice, protected the British American Empire. For instance , the establishment of British claims to Islas Malvinas were not contested by the U.S. Accordi ng to Prof. Quigley, the force that backed up the Monroe Doctrine until W.W. II was the British navy. The sucess of the American Revol ution was helped by the support of certain churches. Certain ministers, such as Isaac Bac kus, the leader of New England Seperatist Baptists, and their inflamatory sermons did more to help create revol utionary fervor, than some of the other items indicated in the textbooks. Whether one chooses to call this \"Christian\" s upport or not, it was an important factor. The narrow mean ing of Christian is Christ-lik e, and supporting war is not Christ-like. This does not remove the divine aspe ct to the creation of th e United States. It just means God did not call for men to kill each other. Although the idea that the United States was created a Christian nation is often based on shoddy history and myth, that does not mean that God wasn't involved in its birth and history. Because the Christian, religious and spiritual si de of history is blacked out of the system's approved history, it is difficult fo r people to appreciate the great ro le the United States has really played in the spiritual affairs of the world. The United States th rough its people have been part of God's plan for victory. According to Scriptur e, God has permitted all of this to happen, no matter what the surface a ppearance, it is his conditional will. Nor has American simply been an evil nation. In some parts of the world, where th e American government is hated, Americans are still loved, because foreignors appreciate the American people. The God of the Bible can use th e American people. He has i ndicated in his Word that a purifying fire is used to refine his people. Judge ment begins at the Hous e of God. Th e American Christians, if refined like Uraniu m to get the isotope 235, can be as powerful in G od's hands, as refined Uranium in a nuclear bom b. Because God wants to do great things with America, it is to be expected that a great purifying fire will be allowed. Communism was turned by God into his instrument of purification. Why does he do such a thing? I'm sure if people would repent, he could work with less drastic meas ures. But the American Christians are largely deaf to calls for repentence, they are insisting on stronger measures. The Christia n view of history will be one where the power of God is seen manifesting itself along side the free will of man. God is attracting mankind to him, without coersion. He al so has set in motion events that will result according to the Bible in victory for Good and for God. Therefore, it is proper for Christians to see God's presence at work during the American Revolution. However, let the historical chips fall where they will, the American Revolution was an act of disobedience to a legitimate Authority, and was planned and directed larg ely by Masons. When a textbook writes, \"THE"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"COLONIES WIN THEIR FREEDOM\" , it paints an illusion. The people in Canada and Great Britian did not rebel against authority, throw someone else's cargo of tea in the sea, and they are heralded today as great bastions of democracy and freedom. Christ st ated that true freedom is the freedom from sin he alone can bring. Christians n eed to return to Christ's teachings when they attribute freedom to any other source but Him alone. How many observors of drug addicts realize that living in the United States is not a guarantee of freedom, living in Christ is. (In a few years, the New World Order will unintentionaly teach Christians this lesson.—Author's opinion) ANOTHER SAMPLE FO R HISTORY LOVERS Perhaps I can indulge the reader with one more sa mpling of history that he or she will not read in the textbooks. This following information co mes from my manuscript/res earch notes for a book which, like this one, I did extensive research and work on, but has never been published. The reader can skip over this part if he is not in terested in how the history books are inadequate. What I will be demonstrating is just one area of history of many that the facts and events of history are not being taught. These facts may seem trivial, however after this next example from history, we will discuss why these se emingly trivial facts are important. The part of history I want to draw your atte ntion to concerns the Czar of Russia and his willingness to help save the Un ited States during the Civil War. The Czar of Russia was aware of European interests (the In ternational Banking House of the Rothschilds) to split the United States into two countries. The Czar moved his Paci fic fleet to San Francisco to protect the United States. This is easy to state, but the significance of th e Czar's move must be lost to most readers because the history books have to a great extent not only ignored his help, but also the crucial role the Far Western United States played in the Civil War. The far west at that time consisted of the states of California and Oregon with the rest of the continental U.S. having territorial governments. The statehood of Ne vada was rushed through by th e Lincoln administration for political motives during the war in 1864. The important part the West had in the outcome of the American Civil War has been by and large ignored. This may be due to the bias that the Eastern esta blishment has for concentrating on events in the East. Most Civil War historians ha ve concentrated their e fforts on the East, even when they speak of the \"West\" in their books, they refer to the mid-west ra ther than the far west. Further, the establishment historians do thei r best to avoid topics that would expose the machinations of the Rothschilds and th e real politics behind wars and events. Let us see the details of how protecting San Francisco and California could have saved the Union, and prevented a Southern victory, and ex amine this help of the Czar's fleet to the U.S. that was celebrated in California during the war. Prior to the Civil War, men li ke the Rothschilds in Europe schemed to brin g the U.S. under their economic dominion. The discovery of gold in California, and precious metals throughout the entire western United States helped bolster the United States economically, which in turn helped the U.S. stand on its on two feet against the Europeans. The Rothsc hilds were not the only ones to see how important the gold and silver fi elds were. On Jan. 19, 1861 while the South was still in the early stages of s eceding from the Union, before a Confederate government had even been formed in Montgomery, AL, Lincoln's government in Washington,D.C. found out that a rebel expedition was waiting in Mexico to captu re the California gold steamer that sailed from San Francisco to Panama with the gold that the western U.S. produced."},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"The vast amounts of California gold and silver were shipped on gold steamers that ran from San Francisco to Panama. During th e Civil War these precious meta ls were the real money that kept the United States government going. The Coms tock Lode's value to the U.S. during the war was 52 million dollars (dollars values accordi ng to the 1860 values). Idaho's mines provided Lincoln with 114 million dollars. Colorado mines furnished an other $52 million. In all the United States' federal government spen t $5,000 million to fight the Ci vil War, which was about the amount of the whole country's gross national pr oduct in 1860. U.S. Gr eenbacks were printed which lost most of their value compared to real money (gold and silver coins.) Further, California raised much money privately for the war, along with providing 16,000 U.S. troops, a good number of which were transported to the east. On Sept. 19, 1862 Californians donated $100,000 in gold for the war, and two months la ter an equal amount was sent east to relieve the sick and wounded. Of a total of $5 million collected for the troops by the Sanitary Fund in the North, one-fifth was donated by Californians. A sack of flour which Californians enjoyed selling and reselling to raise money for the war, grossed $275,000 in returns for the war effort. In the Pacific, the gr and american whaling m onopoly brought home an annual aver age catch worth 8 million dollars. The 70 Pacific whaling ships sunk by the Confederates in the Pacific hastened the demise of the whaling industry al ready hurt by the discovery of oil petroleum in 1859. Further, California served as Ameri ca's outlet for trade to the Far East. CONFEDERATE ASSETS At first glance it might seem that the Confederacy had no assets to threaten the West. Actually, the reverse might be stated, the U.S. had little a ssets to defend the vast land mass of western United States and the Pacific. Over 1 million s quare miles of land in the west in 1860 were divided up into 5 military departments, TX , N.M., UT, OR, and CA. The Secretary of War reported that on June 20, 1860 12, 984 federal troops were stati oned in the west. Most were withdrawn east and replaced with new recruits, the majo rity of which came from California. The gold steamers were vulnerable like a child with candy, the U.S. Pacific fleet consisted of only a few ships. VULNERABLE PROBLEM SPOTS In 1860, the British had moved thousands of tr oops and naval forces to British Columbia. During the Civil War, there we re periods when it was uncerta in whether Britian would stay neutral or help the South. Sout h of California, France moved troops into Mexico and took over. The French cooperated with the Confederacy. The French and Confeder ates even conducted several joint military operations. The Confederates established (military) re cruiting stations along the U.S.- Mexican border south of California and Arizona, whic h federal troops during the war led several expeditions to shut down. The Mexican population in Ca lifornia were not loyal to the U.S. government, because their lands had been stolen by Americans during the gold rush, and their age old titles to the land ignored by the American le gal system. Remember, that California had been captured recently from Mexico during the Mexican War. Utah was settled by Mormons, who at the time were in a stat e of hostility toward the U.S. gov ernment. U.S. tr oops had to be stationed in Utah through out the war. Earlier the Mormons ha d successfully engaged army troops. The Indian tribes in the Western territo ries and Oregon were itching to fight."},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"During the war, southern agents would visit most of the Western tribes to encourage them to go to war. On September 10, 1861 orders were found on dead confederates at the Quapaw Agency revealing the south's intentions to enlist the Plains Indians. This was just one of many incidents where Confederate agents taking weapons and encouragement to the Plains Indians were discovered. Another e ssentially unknown incident along this line was when 22 Confederate officers on their way to incite the Plains Indian s to rebel were caught on the Verdigras River in Kansas and wiped out. Because of the vulnerability of the U.S . forces, Confederate military aid, and many other factors coming together many of the civilized and the wild Indians attacked the US Army during the Civil War. Some tribes were directly recruited into the Confederate Army. The Choctaw, Chickasaw, Ch erokee, Creek, Seminoles, a nd some Apaches joined the Confederate Army. The Apaches , Arapaho, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Sioux, Snakes, Shoshones, Madocs, Black Kettle a nd Satanta went to war with the U.S . Army on their own. They were greatly outmatched. The civilian population of the west consisted of many foreignors and southernors so that although the majority of the western popula tion were unsympathetic to the idea of southern secession, they also had little in terest in fighting against the South. California was the most loyal U.S. area, and it harbored powerful la tent desires to form its own country and had some strong pro-Southern district s, especially in southern California. Considering the circumstances just presented, it is easy to see how naval and land forces of the Confederacy could have possibly 1. captured the gold steamers, 2. captured and sucessfully governed parts of the West. It was also possible that French and British forces had they entered the war could have take n the Pacific region. France and Britia n were already under the influence of the Rothschilds and had str ong Masonic governments in place. The key point in California was San Francisc o harbor, which carried on a large amount of commercial activity. Pro-Union Calif ornians were very thankful wh en the Russian Pacific fleet made San Francisco their home ba se. The Russian Fleet had instru ctions to engage in war to protect San Francisco if the occasion called for it. Besides the Russian Fleet, the U.S. iron clad Camanche made it to San Francisco which after sinking and being raised by divers was finally launched in late 1864 and put into service in May, 1865. Troops occupied Santa Catalina island to prevent the South from using its good harbor. Ft. Stevens was built to guard the Columbia River. CONFEDERATE NAVAL EF FORTS IN THE PACIFIC Numerous confederate plans were made to outfit ships in the Pacific into warships to capture the gold steamers, but most never got beyond th e planning stages. U.S. government officials stopped several, and British offici als stopped several attempts in Victoria, B.C. One attempt to seize the U.S. revenue cutter Shubrick was stopped before it reached Port Townsend. Two attempts by groups of confederates wearing ci vilian clothes to hijack the gold steamers failed. The Confederates did manage to outfit one sma ll schooner into a warship, the J.M. Chapman, but it was seized by an American warship in Sa n Francisco harbor before it could do any harm. The fear of the confederate CSS Alabama never developed in to a real threat. Another confederate raider the CSS Shen andoah however was a serious threat in the Pacific. The Shenandoah was moving to attack San Francisco when it learned in July, 1865 that the war was over. The Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies are full of dozens of reports concerning confederate privateers in the Pacific. The threats of any substance have already been mentioned."},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"CONFEDERATE ARMY EFFO RTS IN THE FAR WEST One third of California was estimated to be pr o-South. Two secret or ganizations, the Knights of the Goldern Circle and the Knights of the Co lumbia Star, were loyal to the South. Their California numbers were estimate d at over 20,000 for the first group and 30,000 for the second. Their presence in California requi red US troops to guard importan t locations throughout the state. The Knights drilled and schemed. Th eir big plans always failed, su ch as to take over the mint and the San Francisco arsenal. In Oregon, they schemed to take over the capital Salem and Fort Vancouver in WA. Their biggest plans, for which they collected arms and drew up plans for was the conquest of California in 1865 in conjunction with Confederate troops which were heading for California from Texas. The offe nsive was in its early stages in western Texas when the war ended. The 1865 offensive was to follow in part th e route of the 1861-62 Confederate offensive which had taken ov er most of Ariz ona and New Mexico. Troops fro m California ran into the Southernors near the Pima Villiage s (in what's today Ariz.) and drove the Confederates out of Arizona back into Texas. The Confederate offens ive failed in large measure due to the antipathy of the Hispanic population in New Mexico to Texans. The 1862 invasion was not seen by the locals in the context of North vs. South bu t Texans vs. Hispanics and the New Mexican population rather than help the Confederates oppos ed the Texas Units. If the Confederate Trans- Mississippi War Dept. had been able to shift Conf ederate troops from another state to carry out the attack it may well have gotten the popular support it needed in New Mexico. Volunteer troops from Colorado played the major role in defeating the confederate forces in the \"Gettysburg\" of the West at Glorieta and Apache Pass. The Texas Rangers were incorporated into th e Confederate Army. A group of 42 Confederate led by a Texas Ranger that we re moving through Colorado 200 miles SE of Denver were captured in Sept. 1861. In 1862, 7 Confederate officers that went to Colorado to recruit a southern regiment were wiped out by Osage Indians working with Federal troops. Although basically under Federal c ontrol the Wild West was indeed still a wild place, and it was vulnerable to southern activity. WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS INFORMATION In summarizing this little report on the Civil War, the purpose of the report was to illustrate further the inadequacy of modern history textboo ks. The worst are at the lower levels. As the student progresses the textbooks ge t a little better, but for the student \"as the twig is bent so it grows\". His or her frame of reference is warped from the start so that even if the young person encounters facts exposing the Power's conspiracy there is no way to assimilate it. We just discussed a very important aspect of the Civil War which involved the Roth schilds, the Czar, and the Confederate/European threat to California and the fina ncial capability of the U.S. to wage war which is ignored by the textbooks. In itself it simply a small portion of human history, and a collection of what may seem to be trivial facts. However, let me explai n how this affects you and I. First, the Power's establishment removed God and the Lord's spiritual dimension from history. Next, they removed all realistic analysis of events, so that th ings became random events. For instance, why did the Indians revolt? Random even ts. Why did the Czar sent his fleet? a random event. They most likely are not goi ng to directly tell us they ar e random events, th ey simply don't give us any real analysis, and allow us to assu me they are random events. History just happens we are led to believe. Po liticians and other leaders are simply trying to guide events like riding"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"a bucking bronco. The U.S. just stumbled into war. It was only an accident that some men made millions off the Civil War, and that they just ha ppened to be ready to pr ofit from it. Event A has no connection to Event B. Lastly, after taking away analysis of why and how events happen, they have begun taking away facts. Wit hout facts we will not be able to make proper analysis, without any analysis, we will not know wh ere we have been or where we are really going, and finally without God we have no hope. They have us where they want us. This Author has observed today's history cla sses. Today it is popular to have the students spend their period chattering their opinions on history. However, without facts all their discussions do is to reinforce ignorance. Students are being told facts are dry, and useless; and facts are, without analysis. When I was invited to a history class to speak on the Civil War the students were very interested to learn that cont rary to the Constitution we have paper money, and that being issued not by Congress but by a private ba nk. This was proof to me that with analysis showing people how they are participants in a C onspiracy directed against them history comes alive. 1.

He went into Christian work, carrying on various ministries. He ended up helping establish a Christian radi o station and a call in program. This was in New Mexico. (Further details are be ing omitted.) The call-in radio show was a big hit. In order to take all the calls over 20 local ministers manned the phone lines each night. One day this man went on the air to tell his testimony of how he came to Christ from Freemasonry. Before he went on the air, many callers had trie d to prevent the radio station from letting him talk. When he went on the air, the ministers w ho regularly showed up to take calls didn't. Out of over twenty, only two showed that night. Th e ex-mayor of the city, a Mormon called after the show to the station and yelled at great length at them that their mini stry was finished, that he would no longer support the st ation. That Christian statio n became moribund after that, and support for it simply died . Such is the power of Freemasonry even over Christian radio stations. 1 Even Christian publishers and supposedly Ch ristian radio and T.V. will rarely support Christians who could really expose the opponents of Christ , and who can really defend intelligently the Christian faith. Instead, they give us a steady supply of subjective emotional religious babyfood. (This Author won't get into an expose of the Christian publishers. Not that it couldn't be done. He will simply asked them out of love as a brother to take stock of themselves, and if need be to repent and serve Christ.) So-called Christian media may be a tool in the hand of the New-World-Order, but that doesn't get the rank-and-file Christians off th e hook for their own gross dereliction of duty. Many of us calling ourselves Christians (should that not mean Christ-like?) give lip-service to the idea that there are two kingdoms, Christ's a nd Satan's, but then sit down in front of the Television and absorb uncritica lly Satan's Kingdom's propaganda. In fact we have absorbed so much of it, we can't recognize truth if it hit us over the head . Which someday it may. A CHRISTIAN REPORTS One Christian reports that the Illuminati paid Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel two $4,000,000 checks to start Maranatha Record s and \"Jesus Rock\", in order to get rock music into the churches. Further, witches were trained as \"spirit-filled\" Chris tians and infiltrated into the companies of Sparrow Records, Birdwing Records, WORD Inc. Myrrh, Lexicon, and Light Records, and sent out such \"ministries\" as L oveSong, Children of the Day, Nancy Honeytree, Larry Norman, Chuck Girard , Phil Keaggy and others. 2 CHRISTIAN ROCK & NE W WORLD ORDER THEMES Christian rock has been coming out with album s promoting all the band-wagon themes of the New World Order, globalism, ecology, ect. incl uding even the idea of a One-World-Church. CHRISTIAN ROCK & THE SPIRIT Christian rock music is identica l with secular rock except that Christian words are used in the lyrics. Approving such music ignores that music is more than words but also beat, rhythm, and"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"the combination of particular instruments. Chris tian rock is damaging the spirit of its listeners. The beat that almost all Chris tian music sold has is the same beat that is known to put people into trances. Why is witchcraft (and the New World Order it is in favor of) supporti ng such music? Because they know it is destroying the Christian faith and helping build their New World Order. TEST THE SPIRITS The Scriptures warn the Christians to test the sp irits—to see if they are of God. Therefore, we can not blame anyone else if we have been neg ligent in carrying out this. I am not going to do an expose of \"Christian\" publishers, \"Christian\" television, \"Christian\" magazines—not that it couldn't be done—but that I hope they will qu it worrying about being sucessful and concern themselves with being faithful. An example of one issue of a very respec table Christian magazine should serve the reader notice where our \"Christia n\" media is at. The cover had a picture of Gorbechev and Bush hammering a sword into a plowshare. The ar ticle was entitled \"CT Institute: An agenda for GLOBAL Reconciliation Senato r Mark Hatfield envisions a new day for superpower relations.\" 3 So the Christians pick up something written by a 32° Mason who is into witchcraft and who wants to see a One-World-Govern ment, and they are led to belie ve this is a great Christian Senator giving us his Christian wisdom. Believing that the best defense is an offense, and believing that we should be defenders of the faith once delievered, I am doing my little to counteract the deluge of false propoganda put out not only by the secular Media, but many of our \"Christian\" sources. WHO OWNS THE CHRISTIAN PUBLISHERS? Christians need to begin to examine who owns some of these Christian publishers. One report stated a British Insurance Execu tive claimed he owned 37% of Zondervan's 4.1 million shares. 4 Zondervan denied it. A MASONIC DOCUMENT A masonic document that was wr itten for key members that were involved in the Rite of Mizraim and the Prieure de Sion is of interest at this point. The documen t was in French and is over 50 pages long. It circul ated among key illuminated Mas ons during the 18th and 19th century. How important the document was in po licy planning is open to debate, but it would seem to have either been policy or coincided with policy. On wh at basis does it seem to have been policy? Its principles have been carried out exactly over the last 200 years. A condensation, paraphrase of the translation is given below. Th is Author is not concerned with whether the document was or wasn't an actual policy plan, becau se what has happened historically is so close to the document that that in itsel f speaks for itself. Either by coin cidence or design this document describes what has ha ppened to the world. The Mass Media creates the thoughts of the people. It tells the people what they need, it allows the people to voice their complaints , and to express discontent. By using the power of the Press secretly we have also made much money. We are leading the people from one disenchantment to another. Th ey will even tire of our rule and welcome the King/Priest dictatorship of the House of Da vid that we have been preparing for centuries. Agents tell the people that in order to secure lib erty, the international br otherhood of all, and"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"their equality of rights they need to abuse their national governments. This is to be accomplished by a unification. But we do not tell them who will rule the unification. Who can overthrow an invisible force? Freema sonry remains a my stery to the public and serves as a screen for us. It is critical to undermine all faith, destroy th e principle of the Godhe ad, and replace it with materialism and mathematical ca lculations. Keep the public busy , put industry onto a speculative basis, and foster a desire for consumerism and wealth. We will slowly increase the centralization of government. We have created a class of specialists from our administrative branch that have developed the manipulation of the public into an art. This skilled manipulation uses theory, verbiage, regulations and ot her items and quirks which the public can't comprehend. The principle object is to debilitate the public's mind by criticism, and lead it away from serious reflection of what is really going on. These distractions along with sham fights will prevent resistence. We must bring them into a state of bewilderment by allo wing and promoting so many contradictory opinions, that people will lose their heads in the la byrinth, and come to believe the best thing is to have no opinion of any kind in politics. Sow discord, dislocate the forces against us. Di scourage sincere persona l initiative. A man with genuis and initiative is more dangerous to us than millions of the public. In order that the real meaning of events are not realized they will masked with economic theories. We will manipulate government th rough public opinion, which we ca n create by the power of the Press. We will create tenor. We will harne ss the anarchists, the socialists, the Utopian dreamers so that they will bore away at the last foundations of the established form of order. We will not give them peace until th e New World Order is in place. In order to carry out struggles, money is needed, and all the m oney is in our hands. We have fooled, corrupted, bemused, amused the youth with principles we know are false. We have created laws that are an incomprehensible tangled web. Should any city dare oppose us, we can terrorize it so that ev en the bravest will be intimidated. The subways, sewers, and other subterranean corridors can be mined and the city blown into the air along with its government, records, and service systems. We will be saviors to the mobs, who will vote us into power. We have everyone regardless of qualifications voting, because otherwise it will be difficult to get our consensus from a properly educated group of people. We set up republics with constitu tions. And then use the press to condemn the rulers and make them impotent and inactive, and in effect they become us eless and superfluous. We put into power presidents from the masses, who can be blackmailed. The people in government are often not our own people, but our puppets who we ca n blackmail and destroy if they don't follow orders. In order to create conditions so that people will want a world government, every kind of trouble and discord must be promoted, including the inoculation of diseases, starvation and drug use. Secret Masonry is not known, and the aims ar e not even suspected by the cattle. They are attracted to us by our show lodges which se rve to throw dust in the eyes of their fellowman. Any attempt to attack us by the press on its own will be stopped. But note that we ourselves will attack ourselves in the press—at predet ermined points. Not a single pronouncement will reach the public without our c ontrol. The International News agencies ar e already ours, and use what we dictate to them."},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"The masses look at events of the world through the glasses we provide them. We will neutralize the influence of the privately owned press. If ten priv ately owned presses are permitted, we will have 30, and so on. But the public will never suspect this, because our journals will be the most opposite in appearance, opinions, and procedures. The official publications are guarding our in terests. Then come the semi-official publications. Then will come what appear to be the organs of o pposition to us. Our real opposition at heart will accept this stimulated oppos ition as their own and will show us their cards. Like the Indian god Vishnu, we will have a hundr ed arms— publications of all possible complexions. Our false attacks on ourselves wil convince the public that all organs that oppose us lack substance to their criticism. Our opponents will lack the ability to give full expression to their views because of the lack of their media power. We can ignore them. The masses must be retrained and given new employment periodically. Keep them further distracted with amusements, passions, games, sports of all kinds, art competition. They will grow less and less reflective, and adopt more and more our wa y of thinking. We will continue to direct their minds with all kinds of fantastic theories, new and apparently progressive. Progress, like a fallacious idea, serves to obscure truth, so that none may know truth but us. We have stage managed so many people over the years in many inst itutions. Our belief will not be examined, but the shortcomings of the various beliefs of the masses will be discussed by our experts. In countries called progressive we have created senseless, filthy literature, to direct the masses to learn what knowledge we want them to know. Whenever we come into power, ev en into the New Order, Masons that know too much will be eliminated. We are facing only two major powers, the Russian Cz ar and the Papacy. [As the reader has learned, those have since both been captured by Masonic power.] The curious join the the Masonic Lodge. Using their vanity they can be brought into a total state of slavish submission. Their conceit allows us to bring them into a state of naiv ete. Masons who know too much are executed when required by a normal kind of illness. This action prevents any opposition from within Masonry itself. There you have it. Whatever we make of this Machiavellian-like document, it certainly describes what has happened. For instance, A. Ralph Epperson has written a fairly good book The Unseen Hand, which is a good introduction to the Conspira torial View of History. However, who does he suggest people go to oppose the Conspiracy? To the Mormon Skousen an ex-FBI man, and especially to the John Birch Society (which perhaps Epperson is unaware was started by a 32 degree Mason with Rockefeller money). —See chapter 40 \"Assist ance\" in The Unseen Hand.) By following Epperson's suggestion to ca ll these groups, in effect, people are simply doing what the above documents states, that is: by setting up their own opposition they will learn what their opponents are saying and doing. This is not to sa y Epperson suspected that these groups are tools of the New World Order and inte ntionally gave bad advi ce. No, he believes the JBS is legitimate. That is why Be Wise As Serpents is needed even for those who are aware of the conspiracy. Isn't this simply creating para noia? Not for those who will sincerely oppose the New Order. These people have learned that to fear is counterproductive. Th ere are a certain group of these dedicated servants of God that have been beat up by demonic forces enough in their day to day"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"life that they are no longer fear ful of Satan, but are fully comm itted to depend on the power of Almighty God Yahweh.

They will faithfully do what they must, and will let the chips fall where they fall. If they make mistakes, they learn and go on. They don't give up. What this chapter is calling those who oppos e the New World Slave State to do, is to reevaluate the issues the Media is giving us. Many of the issu es people are getting side-tracked on are intentional distracti ons by the One-World-Order. DOES FREE SPEECH EXIST?"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"Yes, if you want to discuss an ything but the details of the Conspiracy, or Christian values, or anything the Power doesn't care is talked about. Examples of \"free spreech\" include: •A man made anti-Jewish rema rks on an East Broadway bus in 1940 and was jailed in a workhouse for 15 days by a Jewish judge. 5 •A Christian radio evangelist was forced by Je wish threats to apologize over the air for a comment made. 6 •Father Coughlin who was telling the public fact s about the Power was forced off the air, banned by the Radio Assn., wh ich made the ADL gleeful. 7 •Christians in Killingly, Conn. who objected to th e film The Killing Fields as part of a three- day high school program, and othe rs in Crown King, Az who object ed to a school reading club being named \"666\" are labelled censors. The Fi rst Admendment gives everybody the rights of speech and protest. But Christians who try to ex ercise those rights are portrayed as censors by PAW's Attacks on Freedom to Learn and U.S. News & World Report, Nov. '88. •A Christian woman in Calif. Mr s. Evelyn Smith refused to rent to a unmarried couple living in sin. She believed God would ju dge her responsible if she permits people to engage in extra- marital sex on her property. Mrs. Smith was fined $454 dollars in out-of-pocket money to pay for the \"damages\" the unmarried couple suppose dly received from her rejection of them as renters. 8 Where was her First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion, and the promoise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? The examples could go on ad-nauseum. Chris tian freedom of speech, and the freedom to verbally oppose the One-Worl d-Power are being muzzled. Christians continue to try to work through th e system. (Their learni ng curve needs helped.) According to an article in th e American Family Association Journal in 1989 the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) had received 400,000 complaints about indecency laws being violated in the last 20 years. They have prosecute d only one of those, that was eleven years back. The FCC demands that a tape or a video tape be sent with each complaint. But the FCC doesn't even have a VCR to view the ta pes that they say must accompany any complaint. The complaints are simply sitting on a shelf gathering dust. 9 In Miami, an announcer regularly solicits young boys for teenage homos exual sex, the FCC does nothing 10 - this is freedom of speech. But what if a Christian wants to speak the truth even in love? The First Amendment has been stood on its he ad. Pornography, and every evil imagination along with witchcraft of all kinds can been ope nly discussed over the me dia and in public. This is hailed as Freedom of Speech. But if one wa nts to speak of morality, watch out you may be fined, threatened or end up in jail, like the above examples. And if you go through the corrupt system for redress, you may have your complaint gathering dust. In fact, the Media's anti-Christian bias is so bl atant this Author feels somewhat rediculous for calling the reader's attention to the obvious. With New Age morality, the majority of Media elite have decided that a certain group of people are subhuman, and deserving death at th e whim and fancy of another person, even teenagers. 11 I'm referring to the death of millions of unborn children, that the media has promoted. The anti-Abortion protests have been large a nd extensive across the United States and have gone widely unreported. The brutallity inflic ted on the abortion protestors has also gone essentially unreported.

In other towns women were stripped searched and the cavity searched; others were stripped to the waist and dragged thro ugh the jail by their bras with breasts exposed. Two protestors were driven over by a car while police stood by and watched. The driver was only arrested two days later after the story became public. According to the source of these anecdotes, depositi ons have been made of hundreds of similar cases. Then later, when the an ti-Abortion protestors are taken befo re the courts, their sentences are extremely out of proportio n and harsh compared to any sentence any of the other activists in the past have ever received. 13 Christians can watch the Media, observe the Police Departments, the Judges, and others coordinate a campaign against th e Pro-Life movement. But beca use their media-built frame of reference is so poor, they can no t see a conspiracy of power opera ting. If they were aware of how many Jews, Masons, Humanists, and Satanists ar e in these groups, a nd how they cooperate, maybe they would realize that a these events are part of a syst ematic plan and not isolated happenings. Not only that, the On e-World-Order puts its people into the leadership positions of the Pro-Lifers. How disheartening it is to see R onald Reagon and George Bush heralded by the American Life Lobby as leader s of the cause against abortion. The national press and Mass Media brags about its elf as a free-press. Fr om what this Author can tell, it appears they have been instruments in exactly the opposite—the suppression of free speech.

One of the State worshippers is U.S. Senator and social scientist Daniel Moynihan, who got furious at his man-made god for \"inexcusably sloppy work....If administrators and politicians are going to play God with ot her persons' lives (and still other persons' money), they ought at least to get clear what the divine intention is to be.\" 2 WHY WOULD WE WANT TO GIVE OURSELVES TO A WORLD SUPER STATE? Survival. The New World Order has a host of pr oblems that they are vigorously advertising day and nite in the media, most of which they have skillfully en gineered themselv es, to get us to believe we need their super-t otalitarian socialist New Order to survive. (More about these later.) The New World Order will merge the State with a super World Church. This Church-State confederacy ruled by a king-priest will attempt tota l control. It will broadcast that the few people such as devout Christians who stand in opposition to both the law of the state and the institution of the World Church should not be tolerated. It will be said that it is better for them to suffer than for whole nations to be thrown into confusion and lawle ssness. The problems that will come as judgements of God will be bl amed on those who do not line up with the socialist Kingdom of God. Christ's words that th e day will come when those who kill you will think they are doing it in God's service will have special meaning. The New World Order has been paying, encourag ing, and coaching Clergymen of all shapes and sizes to pronounce that our survival depends on Global Interdepende nce—their nice verbage for their New World Order. Here are some samples of the constant broken record that whines on about how we need this On e-World-State to survive: University of Chicago Sociologist and Jew Morr is Janowitz tells us in his book that state coercion has been painful but necessary for mankind. 3 The Humanist Manifesto II suggests that wit hout adopting such \"bol d and daring measures\" we cannot survive. Religious leaders from around the world declared in 1975 at the U.N., \"The crises of our time are challenging the world religions to release a new spiritual force tr anscending religious, cultural, and national bounderies....W e affirm a new spirituality divest ed of insularity and directed toward planetary consciousness.\" 4 The U.S. Global Report 2000 clai ms there is an extreme \"megacr ises\" of population, pollution, energy, soil, water, etc. \"The only solutions...are complex and long-term...far beyond the"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"capability and responsibility of this or any other single nation.

Twenty-four U.S. Senators and eighty U.S. Representatives signed a Declaration of Interdependence which repudiates items in th e Declaration of Independence and pledges themselves to support \"institutions of world order.\" (By the way a good number of them were Masons) This Declaration of Inte rdependence in 1976 begins \"When in the course of history the threat of extinction confronts mankind, it is n ecessary for the people of The United States to declare their interdependence with the people of all nations and to embrace those principles and build those institutions which will enable mankind to survive and ci vilization to flourish.\" It goes on to describe those international institutions. In my \"book\" so to speak, anyone who takes an oath \"to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against en emies within and without\" and th en signs a Declaration that pledges them to the creation of a world gove rnment which will nullif y that Constitution has committed treason, not to mention proving themselves untrustworthy. Do you really believe we are fa ced with extinction? And who has created that threat? Was it not those who governed us? Wa s it not Government that was involved in Nuclear energy and Nuclear bombs? etc. etc. WHAT DISASTERS DO THEY HAVE PLANNED FOR US. Already by the 1870s, the Illumined Masonic le aders had decided it would take three world wars to bring people to the point they would want a strong world government. They have not played the third world war card yet. H.G. Wells wrote that an invasion from outer space would unify mankind. At least two men who have worked for military intelligence have s een the plans to create a fake invasion from outer space to unify the world. The technology to build UFOs exists— I won't take the time to prove it, but it does. They have not played this card yet either. Financial disaster created conditio ns that the dictatorships of Mussolini, Hitler, and (dare we say?) Roosevelt to came into power. It is in the planning, to do a monetary exchange in the United States, and for present money to be inflated . It is in the planning to reduce the American standard of living. They have not played that card yet. THE PLANNED (MOCK) ALIEN INVASION Something big is happening. The whole subj ect of UFOs leaves the objective person bewildered. There are se veral key points that are veri fied beyond doubt on the subject. 1. There has been intensive interest by the movie industry about extraterrestrials, science fiction scenarios about their coming to eart h. There have been lots of secret interest on the part of"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"governments and intelligence agenci es. The level of secrecy on do cuments pertaining to UFOs is two secret levels above the H-Bomb project. The highest secrecy level —Top Secret Umbra— were placed on the Top Secret affidavit givi ng the National Security Agency reasons for witholding its documents on UFOs. SIGINT docu ments that are classified above TOP SECRET receive a an additional stamp su ch as ROYAL, COSMIC, or in the case of one set of UFO documents in case MJ-12 they were stamped MAJIC. 2. After the book Above To p Secret, which conclusively docu ments ad nauseum how there have been government coverups around the world concer ning UFO, especially in the U.S., there is no reasonable doubt that some of the biggest intellig ence agencies like the CIA, NSA, and MI6 are committed to disinfor mation and coverups. 3. UFO activity is related to the Occult, the Ne w Age, and demonic activ ity. It is likely the whole thing about UFOs is going to be related to a One-World-Religion. A newsletter put out by a UFO res earch group Nevada Aerial Re search Group describes Phillip Klass attending the 1989 MUFOU Conference. Ph i Klass has blown his cover with UFO buffs, they know he is a CIA agent. 6 Signs posted at the converence warned no recording devices were allowed. The Mufon Conference Security had to remove Phil 's tape recorder. 7 Not only does Phillip J. Klass apparently work for the CIA, but he wrote a book to debunk UFOs called \"UFOs-The Public Deceived.\" Perhaps he wr ote it at the CIA's behest. The Watchtower Society opens their Awake! (N ov. 8, 1990, p.3) ar ticle on UFO's by quoting Phillip J. Klass. It's interestin g how the WT Society uses Phillip Klass and Edward Dolnik to turn the subject of UFOs into the soon-to-come apocalypse. This Awake! article quotes Edward Dolnik, \"The leading explanation today has to do with deep-seated an d apocalyptic fears associated with approaching the millenium.\" The WT Society adds, \"that is, as we approach the year 2000.\" This author doesn't know what is behind UFOs, except in general it is evil. The book Above Top Secret is so well documented that it is interesting that th e WT Society would promote the view (pp. 8-9) that there has been no coverup. We are looking at a religious institution that has repeatedly called the all government, including th e U.S. government dishonest, yet it wants to turn our belief away from a cove r-up.(?) Did they not read the book Above Top Secret which they themselves mention in the article? At this point, the Watchtower Society is going along with the Party line of the New Order—which is to draw attention to the issue, but not disclose anything. The bottom line of the article is that the WT Society gets more subjective \"proof\" for the date 2000, and reinforces that date in to the collective mind of their read ers. This author does not have the inside scoop on how the topic of UFOs w ill benefit the New Order, but it looks like its a topic that will hang arou nd, no pun intended. A sample of the UFO stories su rfacing from witnesses all over th e globe is the story of Sid Padrick. His story was told with such credibility that many are convi nced of it. He says that the E.T. spokesman in the spacecraft that took him told him that, \"As you know it, we have no sickness, we have no crimes, we have no police force. We have no schools—are young are taught at an early age to do a j ob, which they do very well. Becau se of our long life expectancy we have a very strict birth control. We have no money. We live as one.\""},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"Sid Patrick claims that the Alien ask him, \"Would you like to pay your respects to the Supreme Deity?\" \"When he said th at I almost fainted. I didn't ev en know how to accept it. I said to him, \"We have one, but we ca ll it God, Are we talking about the same thing?\" He replied, \"There is only one.\"...So I knelt and did my usua l prayer....Until that night I had never felt the presence of the Supreme Being—but I did feel Him that night. \"It's obvious that they are on a very high scien tific level, but their re lation with the Supreme Being means a lot more to them than their t echnical and scientific ability and knowledge. I would say that their religion a nd their science are all in one.\" William Cooper, former U.S. Navy security and in telligence officer, claims to have seen plans while on an intelligence briefing team for the Pacific Fleet Intelligence Center to create an artificial threat from outer space to unite the world. His research i ndicates that the world is being ruled by men of secret societies intent on ru ling the world. The Saving & Loan crisis, the depletion of the FDIC fund, the forgiving of thir d world debts is all calculated to collapse the banking system and to motivate us to adopt a cashless society. A man claiming to be an intelligence officer has given dossiers of documents to certain people that there is a big conspiracy on the part of the governments to defraud the people of their freedom. Should we believe such people? Knowing what this author know s, I would suggest people listen to such men's evidence. The New Order typically has played both ends of th e spectrum, and undoubtedly has their nose is both sides of the issue. The CIA is one of the chief elements of their power. Exposes on the CIA may come fro m three sources, legitimate, cr ank, and the CIA itself, so undoubtedly some degree of discretion must be us ed in deciding what information is legitimate. HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED? Have you ever wondered why the big American automakers seem to have lost out to the Japanese? Why is it that such great corporations like GM and Ford with their capital (finances) and technology could fail so easily? Why is it that by some slight of the hand American technology was transferred to Japan? Have you ever wondered why the media plays up Japanese buy ups in America, yet Great Britian which has more investment in the U.S. than Japan goes unnoticed? Have you ever wondered why the Savings and Loans and Credit Unions are being delivered some death blows, while the powerful banks increase in powe r and size? Did you wonder why a Savings & Loan like Benjamin Franklin was so lvent and financially h ealthy one day and the next in such trouble it was ordered to sell itself? Have you ever wondered why the South African government and country has been attacked in the media and the UN for apar teid, when the racial policies of China with the Tibetans, Iraq with the Kurds, India with its culturally engraine d caste system where the light skin Aryans are tops, and other nations are far worse? Why was so much attention and economic embargos placed on South Africa alone? THE CONCEPT OF INTERDEPENDENCE & JAPAN The rise of Japan as an economic world power a ppears to disprove to some that the world is moving toward centralized control. Around 1987, Financial Times ran a headline calling Kenich i Ohmae \"Japan's Only Management Guru.\" Kenichi Ohmae, is not likely the only Ja panese to be knowledgeable in"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"business, but it is interesting to see what a lead er like him from Japan be lieves in. In 1985, he wrote Triad Power. In 1990, he came out with The Bord erless World Power an d Strategy in The Interlinked Economy. The Japanese Business Leader be lieves national borders no longer exist. He says, \"An isle is emerging that is bigger than a continent—the Inter-linked Economy (ILE) of the Triad (the United States, Europe, a nd Japan) joined by aggr essive economies such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore.\" 8 \"The policy objective for the ILE will be ensuring the free flow of information, money, goods, and services as well as the free migration of people and corporations. Traditional governments will have to establish a new single framework of global government. Toward that end, the first and most important step is to understand the global economy accurately . That's the purpose of this book.\" 9 But how does one get the Japane se to open up? The answer lie s in understanding Japanese culture. The Japanese and gifts. There is a Japanese term wh ich describes the concept of returning a gift with an equal or better gift . A Japanese person may not like to receive your gift, because he feels he loses face if he can' t ante up a better one in return. In return for Americans allowing the Japanese into American markets, the Japanese must reciprocate or lose face. Granted American pride has taken a beati ng, as the Japane se have been allowed to invest in America, but much of the cause of th is wounded pride is superficial. For instance, Sony bought Columbia, and the Ja panese also bought Paramount. But Warner Bros. is far greater than Columb ia in size and it has also merged with Time/Life. That merger between Time/Life and Warner Bros . has created such a large entity that Columbia is of small significance—except that it opens the door to th e internationalization of Japanese and Chinese products. Many of the \"Japanese companies\" are really in ternational. For instance , IBM Japan, is this company Japanese? It has 20,000 Japanese work ers, but its equity holders are American. 10 Honda has an operation run by Americans in Ohio, and Texas Instrument s has memory-chips work done in Japan—so which is the American product? Cellular phones sold in Japan by a Japanese company may have components made by Ameri cans at the U.S. division of the Japanese company. Sony sends audiotapes and videotapes to Europe that it makes at Dotham, Alabama. The New Republic magazine inform s us that \"The very idea of 'American' products made by 'American' firms is becoming obsolete. Lee Iacoc ca warns of the Japanese invasion of America, but American-made parts now constitute a smalle r portion of the top models of the Big Three than they do of Honda's top-of-the-line cars.\" 11 The companies supposedly invading us, are ofte n multinational companies that are alligning themselves with the Interdependent economy th e One-World-Order wants. Rather than believing in the myth that the Japanese ar e taking over, we should realize th at the internationals are taking us over. Which part of the world has more economic sa les potential. China an d Japan with over one third of the world's population, or the U.S.? A shoe compa ny, or most any other product company realizes that China ha s a much bigger market. To ope n the Asian market, they are allowing Japan to invest in the U.S. In the l ong run, the elite American s and Europeans who have large financial interests in Japa n, are using the Japanese to ope n up the China market. China has typically suffered from the delusion it is the cente r of the universe, so it is taking a great deal of work by the Internationalists to work the Chinese into the anythi ng global that they run."},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"It is true Japan has a near \"monopoly\" on adva nced computer chips, although recently an American firm won an anti-trust suit against them. But so what? Half of the semiconductor production machinery and software to design complicated chips ar e American made. Rare gasses, photo resists, and other items essential to its production are American controlled. Speaking about something that is greatly overloo ked American controlled is the world's money supply. There is no national currency except Ameri can dollars that are in sufficient supply for the Shieks and other weathly people to keep their money in. Most of the world's wealth is kept in dollars, and the value of do llars is contolled by the Fed (Federal Reserve System), and ultimately is Rothschild controlled th rough the Banks that control the Fed. Two of the most powerful men of the elite are Japanese. These top Japanese are definitely being given are piece of the action in the New Wo rld Order. However, sour ces that have inside knowledge indicate that the New World Order pl ans to pull the rug from under the Japanese economy first, before they destroy America's. This is possible, but during 1991 the New World Order has been moving massive am ounts of money out of the United States. (As I write this in 1991, it doesn't appear the United States has too much longer of a grace period.) Although the Japanese have Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, now the largest bank, with $414.1 billion of assets as of 31 Mar '89, they ar e not the masters of the banking world. 12 In June 1985, Chase Manhattan, Morgan Guar anty Trust, and Banker's Trust—the banks connected to the One-Worlders— were allowed to participate in the Ja panese money markets and the Japanese Trust business. Further a Tokyo-based market like the International Banking Facilities allows international fi nancial institutions to create sp ecial accounts exempt from many of Japan's domestic regulations. The major American investment banks are spending tens of millions of dollars to expand their Tokyo offices . \"These days, you can't be a global player without an important presence in Japan.\"—Neil P. Benedict, director of finance at Saloman Brothers, a Jewish banking concern. 13 Although the complete list of Foreign-Related Firms in Japan is beyond the scope of this book, it might be of value to point out to the re ader a few firms in Ja pan that are Foreign- Related (that is underpinned with foreign capital.)

In fact, of the top 100 Foreign-Related Fi rms 25 consist of 100% foreign capital. Next time the reader sees the name Mitsubishi on a caterpilla r, maybe he'll look at the machine differently, knowing that 50% of the company in Japan be longs to non-Japanese. The Big Three American Auto manufacturers have invested heavily into Japan's auto manufacturing. IBM, Schick, Nestle, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Polaroid, Del Monte, Adidas, and many other companies are sucessful in Japan. Companies are increasingly joining up in coope ration. General Electric, Toshiba, Hitachi, ASEA, AMU, and KWU (Siemens) joined togeth er to develop an improved nuclear boiling reactor. 14 The Japanese Money Barons are doing great, but th e Japanese man in the street has paid the price through hard work and little of the benef its. \"Japanese laws discourage consumption. Income tax rates go up to 70 percent. There aren't any tax br eaks for home mort gage interest or consumer borrowing....Typica lly, Japanese can't afford a home un til age forty, a d ecade later than Americans.\" 15 Interest rates on savings accounts ar e low. \"Small savers—the backbone of Japan's financial strength—suffe r. They get less return than they deserve for their toil and thrift. After calculating the effects of inflatio n, small savers have actually ha d a negative real rate of return.\" 16 According to the Federation of Economic Orga nizations the average land prices in Japan compared to the U.S. are 35 times as high. Americans are concerned that they run a trade de ficit with Japan. But all of us run a trade deficit with our supermarket, it w ould be a nightmare if each of us had to make sure we sold as much to the supermarket as it did to us. Even if we had a trade surplus it wouldn't mean we were winning economically. Europe had one with us during the 80's while losing 2 million jobs. 17 It is true that the Japanese have made substantial investme nts in the United States. This indicates that the world is becoming a global co mmunity economically. What is also interesting is that all this fuss is made concerning Japanese investment, while British investment in the United States exceeds Japanese. Some of the Japanese investments are going to be losses. The Japanese banks hold about half the perpetual floati ng-rate notes, which amounts to billions of dollars. Sp eaking about these notes (which have by the way had difficulties) Merrill Lynch money-markets sp ecialist Paul Dennison says, \"The Japanese couldn't sell their bonds if they tried.\" 18 The propoganda about the Japanese ta king over is just that, they ar e vulnerable,(as we all are) and can only expect to succeed if they play the game of intern ational interdependence. If they deviate from the Party line, they can easily be crippled economically by the One-World-Power. (Some confidential sources with good connections to the Power say that the One-World-Power plans to pull the rug out from underneath the Japa nese economy before they destroy America's.) Milton Friedman in his massive A Monetary History of the Un ited States documents how the Fed has not maintained a stable money, but has been a major sour ce of instability. The Fed has enormous power over the economy of not ju st the U.S. but power over Japan as well. The spirit of the One-World-Economy has been underwritten legally by the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) , IMF (International Monetary Fund, OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), and bila teral commercia l treaties. Since 1970, the Japanese have shifted into line with regards to in ternational trade. There has been plenty of One- World propoganda in the Japanese media, and the globalist attit udes that are appearing among"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"the Japanese are a radical change from the isolationist views that the Japanese so long shielded themselves with. Japanese pride is very stro ng, and it will be intere sting to see how the Internationalists plan to cope with that. We find the Japanese full players with the One-World-Order. One example of the many transactions carried out daily is when the Chairman of the Roth schild's American Express James Robinson III wanted to make a deal with Nippon Life, Henry Kissinger personally delivered the letter. 19 The Japanese culture creates citi zens that have values that ma tch what the New Order wants. Remember too, that Japan needs an internationa l global economy to thrive. The United States on the other hand is far less dependen t on other nations, and could surviv e even if isolated. (Reports indicate that American oil is capable of supplyi ng all our domestic needs and to last the United States long into the future.) Prior to W.W. II, Japan was an ti-Masonic. Fujivara, the Japane se delegate to the Weltdienst congress in 1938 declared, \"Judeo-Masonry is forci ng the Chinese to turn China into a spearhead for an attack on Japan, and ther eby forcing Japan to de fend herself against this threat. Japan is at war not with China but with Freemasonry, represented by General Chiang-Kai-shek, the successor of his master, the Freemason Sun-Yat-Se n... Japanese soldiers were dying not for any narrow national interest but for the sake of the whole world...t o...save from the Judeo-Masonic- Bolshevik claws...Do not abandon us, th e isolated bulwark in the Far East.\" 20 During the late 1930s, the Japanese took in Je wish Refugees from Ge rmany, about 30,000 of them which were settled in Sha nghai, China, in the hopes that a. by giving them refuge the Judeo-Masonic world Power would in thanks leav e Japan alone, and b. that by settling them in China they could create a buffer state between their empire and the Chinese. 20a Before W.W. II, Japan had been im pervious to foreign secret soci eties. This was due to their monolithic religious-political system that allowe d the Japanese to impor t Western technology and retain their culture and political system intact. China on the other hand had been a seedbed for secret societies, especially si nce the Manchus took over in 1644 a nd secret societies had formed to oppose them. European meddling into Chines e affairs had been exte nsive too. Japanese perceptions that they and the Germans were a llied against the Judeo-Masonic Secret Societies of Europe was not exaggeration. Japanese Institutions prior to W. W. II's defeat could only be challenged in secret, because Japanese Instituti ons had the concensus of the people. And there had been attempts to establish secret revolutionary societies. The Mason Douglas MacArthur had dictatoria l powers over Japan af ter W.W. II from 1945 to 1951. He single handedly masterminded the rest ructuring of Japan after W.W.II. For an good introduction to MacArthur read An American C easar. The Japanese have joined Masonic Lodges since W.W. II, but the largest group of Masons in Japan has always been Americans. Japan has at least 25 lodges and 5,000 Masons, with about 1/ 10 of these Japanese na tionals. Interestingly, English and Japanese Masons can not visit each other's lodges, or be masonically associated. After restructuring Japan, Ma cArthur was also given command of UN forces in Korea. MacArthur apparently was too i ndependent minded to allow the On e-World-Order to have their way and to allow the Chinese to score against the Americans. The Korean War was not designed to serve as victory for America by the On e-World-Order. The wa r had other purposes. MacArthur however, when he saw the large concen trations of Chinese troops massing to attack the Americans wanted to bomb them, and prevent their attack.

Even someone as brilliant and grea t as MacArthur was expected to toe the One-World- Party agenda, and was canned instantly when he didn't. BUILDING U.S. CORPORATE STRENGTH One economist has said that th e International Financiers are using their economic muscle to build U.S. Corporate stre ngth. This was done by tax incentives for stoc k, while taking away tax incentives for second pr operties. Interest rates were manipul ated by the Fed, wh ich drove people to turn to stocks rather than leaving money in Bank accounts. Employee Retirement Plans which place their funds into stocks furthe red the corporate financial strength. American and Foreign Corporati ons believing the New World Orde r is the wave of the future are getting onto the bandwagon and participating with the World Order's program. It is not important whether they have studi ed H.G. Wells. Nor is it importa nt that they have or haven't studied Kenichi Ohmae. The probab ilities are very strong that thos e that read in business have read something promoting the One-Worlder's economic ideas, because such literature has been authored by hundreds of men and is practically everywhere, and so many leaders are spouting it. What is sad, is that the Christian community is being deceived even while this New One World Economic Order is so blatant and extensiv e. For instance, in th e book A Crash Course On The New Age, a popular Christian book supposedly informing the Christians about the New Age, the author redi cules Constance Cumb ey for connecting H.G. Well's ideas with the New Age. He asks how many scientists of the world today have read Well's The Open Conspiracy. This is misleading in several wa ys. First, The Open Conspiracy is not the primary book of H.G. Wells being used as a guide for the economics of the One-World-Orde r, he wrote a number. Second, these people have think-tanks with some of the greatest minds in the wo rld massaging ideas on how to bring in the One-World-Order, they ar en't relying on H.G. Wells. Third, since Wells, there have been hundred s of men who have writt en books on the subject, fo r instance, a scientist could have read The Borderless World, Power and Strategy in The Interlinked Economy or dozens of other recent titles. So ma ny economists, speakers etc. are le cturing on it, it is hard not to hear about it. Fourth, it doesn't matter if the technicians and scientists have read anything on this subject or heard anybody talk about it. What Wells was sugg esting was that the day to day decisions would recide with specialists. That is be ing done today, just as Wells pointed out that it was being done in his day, onl y it is now done on a greater scale as he had envisioned. It doesn't require the specialist to s ee the big picture for th em to do their job. By handing over the control of everything in our lives to specialis ts, power will be taken out of the hands of the people. Wells liked the idea, be cause it is almost impossible to argue with a specialist. This author would like to point out the abuses of such a world. In a divorce, a guardian-at- liadem for the minors is appointed to determin e who should gain custody of the children. Supposedly such a person knows best—but many ac tual cases show that the guardian-at-liadems know very little about the cases they are handling. Another abuse, is that specia lists called psychiatrists make judgements about people for the courts that seriously af fect the outcomes of the court cases and the sent encing. These psychiatrists are frequently unbalanced people themselves, and their judgements are t oo often devoid of even common sense. At least in listening to many conve rsations at coffee breaks, etc. one gets the distinct impression most people regard it rediculo us for a criminal to get off by cl aiming insanity."},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"More and more the specialists, th e experts, are the System's peopl e, who are indoctrinated with the One-World-Power's propoganda, and who are increasingly making decisions based on a very narrow outlook that they have received from the Po wer's sources such as the System's T.V. and public educational system. Studies by the two top scientists in the field of global warming have shown that there has been no global warming between 1935-1990. But the system has its own specialis ts, and consequently there have been numerous international confer ences and activities about Global Warming. Why? because the Power wants to stampe de us into thinking that unle ss a One-World-Power is created the environment can not be saved. 21 Wells knew that by creating an elite of specialists and technicians with lo ts of credentials, the common man would not dare to question their decisions and things would run smoothly. The Christians (and other people as well) have not noticed the subtle method of enslavement this will perform. Increasingly, the Power to dete rmine who is an author ity, and who gets an education is in the hands of the One-World-Power. The entire educational sy stem is at the mercy of the Federal government, and the grants that th e foundations make. The list of Christians who have been excluded from techni cal positions because they took a st and in line with their Christian beliefs is numerous. Another abuse of Well's concept of an elite, is that the technicians are forced to follow guidelines that they often disagree with. The public accepts their decisions without realizing they are made under th e duress of keeping their jobs. JAPAN In Japan, the specialists in the Japanese bureau cracy have been able to dictate the validation (ninka) process for foreign busine ss entry into Japan. The career bureaucrats derive much from \"second careers\" in politics or in major business firms, and the po liticians in Japan derive their campaign funds from big business. 22 Consequently, until big busines s in Japan is solidly in the One-World-Camp the specialists in both the \"e conomic ministries\" (MITI & Finance Ministry) and the Foreign Investment Council are going to continue making it difficult for foreign investment into Japan. Each application is ha ndled on a case-by-case ba sis, and for those who are interested in the process for major, minor, and automatic validations should read Chap. VI of the proceeding reference. IS FREEMASONRY THE WORLD POWER AS IT BOASTS? In this section, we will examine th e One-World-Power's control over Asia. The One-World-Order maintains its power through a number of ch annels. For instance, in Iran prior to the Iranian Revolution the CIA ran the country through its agent the Shah, through the Secret SAVAK which they trained and developed, and through the many Mu llahs who they paid regularly to support the Shah and to keep the populace's religious devotion in support of their regime. When Pres. Jimmy Carter failed to give the Moslem clergy the pay raise they felt they could bargain for, the Moslem clergy overthrew the Shah. The Moslem clergy knew the people better than the CIA, and knew that they would support their revolution. Iran is just one of several Asian countries wher e the CIA is heavily involved with the secret police to keep a government in power. The Korean CIA works hand in hand with the U.S. CIA. The Indonesian Secret Police, one of the most br utal police forces in As ia, works intimately with"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"the CIA. The leaders of the CIA are the ones who tie back into the One- World-Power. They are members of the International Bankers, Masons , the elite Power families and the like all committed to the One-World-Order. For recruits, they like to choos e Mormons, because Mormons are the perfect Masonic servants. They have been raised in a theology that is Masonic. They have been taught obedience to authority. They are clean cut, not prone to alcoholism, or drugs and have no religious scruples about the dirty work that must be done, becau se they are convinced that communism and atheism, et al. are dangerous. (Bear in mind, Mormons in Nazi Germa ny fought for Hitler right along side the Catholics and Luther ans. Having raised this as an issue with Mormon missionaries repeatedly, I have yet to encounter a Mormon that has seen anything wrong with the German Mormons being given official chur ch approval to fight for Hitler.) Mormons, generally after their mission, perh aps sometimes during a missionary mission overseas, are recruited by the CIA. Likewise, although the Peace Corps officials have protested, their volunteers are likewise recruited by the CIA. The Masonic Lodge working through their people in the CIA and British Intelligence ha ve a good worldwide intelligence gathering capability. As the reader is beginning to picture, the One-World-Order uses pr oxies, and native agents within the Asian countries to complete the va st lower levels of their chain of command. Masonic Lodges are found in most Asian count ries, including Bangladesh, Brunei, Burma, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepa l, Pakistan, Phillipines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Singapore. HONG KONG Hong Kong has been under the Order's direct rule since China lost the Opium Wars. The penalty on the Chinese for trying to protect thei r nationals from opium addiction by fighting the Europeans was the forced concession of Hong Kong. On paper a govern or appointed by the crown and a legislative council rules. But the le gislative council can actu ally only give advice. In one reference we read about Hong Kong, \"W ho REALLY rules— The Colonial administration shares power with the wealthier members of Hong Kong's integrated (English-Chinese) business community.\" 23 It is of importance to keep in mind what powerful British companies started Hong Kong, and then it is clear that the Rothschilds and co-workers control it. Hong Kong has been a conduit for Israeli militar y technology to Red China over the years. The BCCI scandal revealed a portion of the enorm ous military help that Israel has given the Communist Chinese. INDIA India is the an important outpost of Freemasonry. Calcutta has been a nerve center for Masonry for over 100 years. 24 The British East India Company ow ned and operated by the One-World- Power ruled India for many years. During this tim e period, Masonry was es tablished in India. The first lodge was in Calcutta in 1740. In the nine teenth century, ethnic Indians began joining. In 1844, in Bombay a Scottish R ite Lodge (Rising Star No. 342) was started for non-Europeans. In the Bombay area, many Pharsees (also spelled Pharsis) join ed. Note that the Pharsees follow the ancient Iranian religion taught by Zoroaster, which was the forerunne r of Mithraism. See chapter 1.2 were Masonry and Mithraism are equated. In the New Delhi area, many Hindus joined. The turbaned Sikhs w ho never cut their hair also found Masonry appealing. Approximately 500 Masonic lodges can be found in India today."},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"In the the 1880s, for some reason the World-Or der decided to rule India from behind the scenes rather than through the British government. However, the people in India didn't want self rule. Many Indians realized that in their fragmen ted nation the British could be counted on to be an impartial benevolent ruler. Evelyn Baring, Finance Minister of the Government of India, declared in 1882 that the Indians needed to beco me self-governing on a local level. \"We shall not subvert the British Empire by allowing the Bengali Baboo to discuss his own schools and drains. Rather shall we afford hi m a safety valve if we can turn his attention to such innocent subjects.\" 25 However, a number of Indians observed that if the British had not turned over local administration to the Indian locals, the Indian s would have not consid ered independence. The reason being was that when the British did all the administrating, things were done right, but with limited self-rule things deteriat ed and people lost sight of the advantages of British rule. Annie Besant and her Theosophical Society, which originated fro m Masonic roots and has been led by Co-Masons, led the fight for India's inde pendence. She began adja tating for independence even in the 1920s. Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, and th e clique of Gandhis that have followed and ruled India have been connected to the Theo sophical Society. Mahatm a Gandhi was a member of the Theosophical Society. The Russians and Germans also encouraged Indian s to turn against British rule. However, in spite of all the various groups seeking independen ce, the power of the One-World-Order in India was never threatened. Economic control in India for the One-World- Order is through the Sassoons (one of the female branches of the Rothschilds). 26 They control the Banks in India among other items. The power of Sassoons extends further than India today. India is also ideal in many ways. The population can be easily controlled by religious gurus. The caste system, although no longer legal, is part of India's cu lture, and it produces a hierarchy which is also perfect for control. Three quarter s of the people are Sudras—that is outcasts who are only fit for the most repulsive of jobs. 27 The multitude of factions, make a divide and conquer strategy easy fo r whoever has money. Even more openly than in the U.S. and the U.K., India has b een ruled by a elite which stays in power through corruption. Th e people in India today, in general, are disillusioned with \"democracy.\" S.K. Ghosh, an Indian writer has recently come out with the book The Indian Mafia. He states, \"In return for a ring of secur ity, our politicians have surrendered their powers to gangsters.\" He notes that a mood of cynicism and foreboding pervades India's population of 844 million people. The System's media is telling us and the Indians th at it is a lack of foreign investments, lack of India not using Western lending institutions that have caused India's misery. The truth is that the religious beliefs of Hinduism ca use a great deal of the problem. MASONIC CONTROL OF GREAT BRITIAN The World Order controls Great Britian comp letely. The British mona rchs have allowed themselves to be the nominal heads of the Maso nry down through the years. As so much of British Royalty has been involved in Masonry, and this has been w ith all the pagentry that Britian is so famous for, it is public knowledge that Br itish Royalty is part of the Masonic system. There"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"are few exceptions, and it is questionable if the speci fic details are needed to relate the religious side of the story. It is my intention to keep this section as brief as possible because it deals with politics. However, something must be offe red the reader on this area, becau se the religious threat of a One-World-Religion seems so remote until we realize that the people of the One-World- Religion are the same group who are have control of our political/judicial systems. In the United Kingdom (U.K.), tw o major political parties have be en created, th e Conservatives and the Labour parties. As in the U.S. both po litical parties are controlled by the One-World- Power. Even more so than in the U.S. there is fundamentally little difference between the two parties. One British authority on the British parties noted th at, \"Two monolithic stru ctures now face each other and conduct furious arguments about the co mparitively minor issues that separate them.\" 28 As in the United States the Labor Unions have si ded with one particular party. In the U.S. it is the Democratic party, and in the U.K. it is the Labour party. Anyone familiar with the Labor Unions is aware they don't exist solely for th e working man. They ha ve hidden agendas and politics to them. That is not said here to be taken as anti or pro Union, just that Labor Unions should be viewed in relation to the external fo rces and issues that involve them. Who started these Unions, who controls them, and why? Just a sample of where the reader might begin answering this is Annie Besant, Fabian, Soci alist, Co-Masonic and Theosophical leader, and others like her. The British voting population has been divided up into Constituencies, the boundaries of which are determined by Government Commissions fro m time to time. From th ese 635 Constituencies come 635 Members of Parliament (MPs). The MPs in the House of Commons is considered to be the House that carries out the actual legisla tive work, the House of Lords being more show. Actually, policy is decided by other groups. \"T he Milner Round Table later became the Royal Institute of International A ffairs-Council on Foreign Relati ons combine which exercises unopposed control for the World Order over fore ign and monetary policy in both the United States and Great Britain.\" 29 The British legal system is totally in the contro l of the Masons. It is practically a given in Britian that you must join the Masons to become a lawyer. The Judges are essentially all Masons. (According to Knight in his book The Brother hood, upwards to 70% of British judges are Masons, and 90% of the lawyers, called barrister s and solicitors in Britain.—These figures may well be too low, although the law is on the books for the lodges to report their membership lists, it has never been enforced.) The lawyers in Britian decide who is allowed legal aid, if your case is a non-Mason against a Mason you can forget trying to get legal aid. Also to your disadvantage is your mercenary, your lawyer, is invariably a Mason and can't be depended upon to help your case against his brother Mason. In chapter 2.1, in the section on the Anglican Church is was shown how Masonry controls the Church of England. In turn, the Church of England dominates religi ous life in England. A breakdown of religious affiliation in England is given in The Statesma n's Year Book, 1978-9: England and Wales Church of England 27, 180,000 [Masonic leadership] Roman Catholic 4,190,000 [see chp. 2.2 on Mas. leadership in Cath.

And who from the churches staff these investigations?— Masons, and who do they inte rview? usually Masons, and wh at books do they read? Masonic literature. For instance the Church of Scotland's investigation in 1964-5, which was helped by the Grand Lodge of Scotland. Anot her example of Masonic help in an investigatio n of the Lodge was to the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, Aust. in 1957-8. Of in terest is the statement in the Presbyterian report, \"The comm ittee had knowledge of the truth of the opening words of the petition that many Ministers and Laymen of unquestioned sincerity are members of the Masonic Lodge.\" As might be expected in a count ry run by Masons, whose religi ous life is controlled almost entirely by Masonic power, very few British are church goers. Interest in the Bible is scarce, and the Moslems and Sufis are making big gains. By 1688, religious conflicts in England on a major scale were over, and the Masonic system of toleration had begun to pervade the British. It has been slowly diluting their religious fervor. In spite of this, individual British have been great men of God. Whet her for good or bad, the British have been a big relig ious influence world wide. The British Prime Minister appoints the Gover nor of the B.B.C. By the way, the Prime Ministers have been their men, or in Margaret Thatcher's case their woman. (How many people know that she worked for OSS intelligence, and in 1981 went to a reunion of OSS veterens in New York City. 30 She also is a Bilderberger. The Maso n Winston Churchill is well-known for kicking off the Cold War with his \"Iron curtai n speech\". He was a On e-Worlder and only had close connections with the Fabian socialis ts, along with liking their view of things. 31 Reuters, perhaps the best worl dwide news service which supplie s the American news networks with much of what they use, is owned and ope rated by the Jewish Clique that is working on setting up the One-World-Order. There are a bout 150 daily and Sunday newspapers in the U.K., 32 which is a very small number compared to most other comparable western nations. And yet at the same time, more news papers are sold in the U.K. than in any other country in the western world. The press, radio, and TV are predominantly L ondon-based and London- controlled. 33 In short, while the uninfor med person might think that a nation of over 57 million people with ties to every other na tion globally would have access to lots of unbiased information, the censorship and control in Grea t Britian is as tight as anywhere. Those who have really rocked the boat have been arrested in England, and some have even been moved to prevent relatives"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"from locating them. An example is the imprisonmen t of Lord Alfred Douglas in the 1920s after he published information in Plain English (Sept. 3, 1921). Financial Power recides in the Bank of England, which is cont rolled by Jewish concerns, to a large extent the Rothschilds. Jewish-Masonic concerns can be seen to totally dominate British life and politics. What helps out further in some ways, is that because th e British are so homogenous in racial composition (in relation to comparable countries) and like the Japanese develop an d work off a national concensous, it is only a matter of leading the he rd of cattle to direct public opinion. The British defer to their leadership, and to authority. That is one reason why British police (Bobbies) do not need to tote guns—although they can use them if n eed be. If this sounds to harsh, it is only saying in a less positive ma nner what many British author ities are well aware of. 34 The reader can study this for hi mself in the references in this last superscript footnote. Americans and Canadians have been taught that William the Conqueror was the last conqueror to invade the British Isles successfully. To quote The World Almanac published for the Kitchener-Waterloo Record, Canada (1983) p.573, \"The last su ccessful invasion was by French- speaking Normans in 1066 who united the country with their dominions in France.\" However, a more exact history is \"Largely because of her insular positi on, combined with the maintenance of a powerful navy, Britain has been able to resi st successfully all attempts at foreign invasion since 1066, apart from the relatively peacef ul 'invasion' by William of Orange in 1688.\" 35 Those who helped William of Orange invade have been in leadership positions since. \"Those who had aided William's invasion we re well-rewarded; they have be en the wealthiest families in England since.\" 36 \"Despite the fact that mobility between the social classes from one generation to another has increased since the principle of free and compulsory secondary education was established, fam ily background remains fundamenta lly important in determining social class.\" 37 One's family background determines what schools one can go to, and that in turn determines what occupation one can get into. Britis hers that come to the U.S. enjoy the seeming lack of a hereditary elitism, their aristocracy th at is so oppressive and pervasive in British life. 38 America's hereditary aristocracy is much less visible than Britain's. Indeed, few American realize the enormous hereditary links between America's leader ship and the original powerful New England families. 39 Also unknown are the connections be tween the America's aristocracy and William of Orange and thos e powerful men who helped him. 40 The Jewish bankers of Amsterdam financed William of Orange. The most influential act of W illiam was to create the Bank of England in 1694. Men who have been permitted to be play large roles in the Ba nk of England have been near the center of power. Th ey and their decendents have played important roles in Canadian and American history. For instance, the Duke of Marlborough, an early large stockholder in the Bank of England became the Governor of the Hudson Bay Company. Remember, that the Hudson Bay Company ruled over more land in North America at the time of th e Revolution than all of the 18 British North American colonies combined. According to Mullins, every ruling house of Euro pe today, whether in or out of power, are direct descendents of King William of Orange. FRANCE Recently, documentation has come out in Fr ance exposing the Establishment-supported doctored history. A wealth of documentation is being given the French people that the French"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"revolution was created by an anti-French minorit y who set about the deliberate destruction of 3.5 million Frenchmen. These same murderers, through their desce ndents, remain in power today. \"This mystery group, all linked by their member ship in the Grand Orient, a major Masonic secret order, has ruled France for the last 200 years. It has crea ted an omnipresent bureaucracy and police network to keep the ge neral populace in line. It was on this system that Lenin and Trotsky patterned their own Bolshevik reign of terror, resulting in the deaths of 50 million people.\" 41 At the end of W.W. II, under the disguise of ta king care of collaborat ors with the Germans, the Grand Orient Masons went after every one on their hate list. One and a quarter million Frenchmen were killed at the end of W.W. II by the Masons. Most had had nothing to do with the Germans, they were simply enemies of the Grand Orient Masons. Women were paraded naked in the streets heads shaven , before being tortured to deat h. Men were shot like dogs. Children were tied to posts and s hot. Sisley Huddleston's rare book France, the Tragic Years tells the story of this r ecent masonic butchery. The Grand Orient in spite of all the Masonic propoganda to the pub lic, maintains a close working relationship with the American and Br itish lodges. The Alpina Lodge in Switzerland serves as a switchboard for th e various groups of Masons. MEXICO From the Masonic reference book 10,000 Famous Freemasons we learn of the Masonic memberships of the fo llowing Presidents of Mexico: Jose de la Cruz Porfirio Diaz, 1877-80, 1884-1911, Manuel Gonzalez 1880-84, Miguel Aleman , 1947-52. From the Scottish Rite New Age Magazine, (June '1963) p. 53, we learn President of Mexico Card enas Obregon was a Mason. It is clear why the Mexican governments in the past have been so anti-Catholic, they have been as Masonic controlled in Mexi co as in the United States. A CONCENTRATION OF POWER Power in America and Great Britian is concentrated with in a small sphere of elites. Not only do these elites control political decisions, but they run the financial institutions, the corporations, the news, the oil companies, and other center s of power. There is a tremendous amount of interlocking directorates of the various types of institutions. For instance, an international banker might also run oil companies, transportation companies, communication companies, foundations, universities, and hold some political office. This is not a new conc ept for those who have studied who actually makes the decisions in our society. What may come as a su rprise to some though is that this elite is not an aggr egation of individuals, but in genera l is a group. It is a group of men who by virtue of their rela tionship to the New Wo rld Order have access to the institutions that will allow them to progre ss to prominence. In other words, people do not solely become powerful because they have spar kling personalities, valuable sk ills, ambition, etc. but also because of their position relative to the power structure of the New World Order. Power is an attribute of roles within the New World Order, and is not an attribute of individuals. George Bush has power due to his role within the New World Order, not because he personally is such a powerful personality, but because he and his fam ily play an important role. The Rothschild family, fo r instance, is an institution that is acutely aware of its role and its power. The Rothschild family has been very intere sted in genetic engineer ing and the raising of superior beings through genetics. Hitler, one of their illegitima te offspring did important research for them concerning genetics. Th e Rothschild family raises illeg itimate offspring whose parents have been genetically matched.

Although it was the original intention of this Author to show how the power of the various institutions such as banking, televi sion, politics, oil and gas, utilities , etc. are concentrated in the control of a small group of elites, I have opted in stead to simply provide a few suggested sources for the reader to study. FOR FURTHER STUDY FOR THE READER: Who's Running America? by Thomas R. Dye and Florida State University. This book was not the creation of some foundation grant, but developed ou t of a graduate seminar at FSU. This is one of the most exceptionally well-wr itten well-researched books to inst ruct the public about the elite that controls their lives. Highly recommended fo r someone who wants more nitty-gritty details than this book provides. The book is a systematic look at the various areas of power. Don't expect any secrets to be revealed, the book's cont ents are not extremely controversial. Be Wise As Serpents goes beyond Who's Running America a nd reveals the secret groups such MJ-12 and the policy committee of the Bilderbergers who really make the decisions. The Energy Cartel, Who Runs The American Oi l Industry by Norman Medvin. This book exposes the unchecked concentration of power that allows the elit e through joint ventures and interlocking directorates, insurance companies, and hugh banks, etc. to have worldwide control of energy resources. It happens that the elite that The Energy Cartel portray are not interested in the general welfare of the wo rld's people, but for the control of the world for their New World Order. The book states that its main purpose \"is to show that popularly held assumptions about vigorous competition in the oil industr y are false.\"(p. 3) It is clearl y shown that an elite of less than a dozen members control the America's (and the world's) energy. The Money Lenders by Anthony Sampson. This book gives a good look at the world of the International Bankers. Although this book is not an expose, its excellent information does bring the power of International Banking into clear vi ew. It describes how the world including the communist world is in hock to the elite of the International Bankers. NOTES 1. Quotations of Hegel from Popper, Karl R.

As to what that has to do with my trust in God, it simply adds fuel to the fire, that it shows all the more reason to put my trust in God and not men.\" (It is because of the truth that a ll men have sinned, and ha ve a sin nature that I trust the Almighty.) As to scandals in the church , I've seen enough of them. What is not known to the public, is that a. many of these scandals are created by those groups actively working to destroy Christianity, and b. the playing field is not level—scandals concerning Rabbis, people in power, etc. are not publicized unless it serves some purpose for the New Order. To give a few examples of how \"unbias ed\" our news is consider the following. This author made an attempt to place an add in a newspaper to advertise a book which documents the Jehovah's Witnesses' false prophe sies. I upfront told the newspaper I would provide them with a letter from a lawyer saying that they would not be sued, and showing them other evidence that the material was legitimate. They would not allow the add to be placed under any circumstances. But when the Jimmy Swaggart story comes they printed it. A national \"rag\"—the kind that people read the h eadlines of at supermarket check stands was approached to run an add advertising Sutton's book on Bush's membership in the Skull and Bones Order. They would not allow the add in their \"rag \" magazine. But they sure enjoyed the Swaggart and the Baker stories. Yes, scandals of all kinds are being reported on 60 minutes and the ot her papers, but people are either unaware or don't take the time to analyze them. The va rious groups of the New World Order use blackmail and scandal as weapons. C onfidential sources say that, some of the leadership even use the book The Godfather as an inspirational how-to book. For some reason, Machiavelli's The Prince was required reading fo r those of us at West Point, U.S.M.A. They knew that some of us would be recruited into the power structure. The Masons have been in control of West Point too, by the way. The New Age movement has ma de inroads into West Point's training, curriculum, and options. One is reminded of what one of the leaders of the Haute Vente, a secret European fraternal group in alliance with the Masons, said to other members, \"It is co rruption en masse that we have undertaken; the corruption of the people by th e clergy and the corruption of the clergy by ourselves, the corruption that ought one day to put the Church in her tomb. The best dagger with which to strike the Church is corruption. To the work, then, even to the very end.\" 1 The Jesuits who are run by Masons provide part of the recruits who infiltrate Protestant churches to destroy them. They have been doing this since 1550, so they are quite skilled at it. One man, who infiltrated hundreds of churches and Christian orga nizations and destroyed many by creating discord or scandals, le ft, converted to Christ, and ha s been warning Christians who will listen to the danger their churches are in. He destroyed at least 20 churches and a seminary. 2 "},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"This man, whose documentation is legitimate, describes that ther e are 3 basic ways to destroy the minister of a church that is not making progress toward joining the One-World-Church. These three ways are 1.\"Destroy his reputation by lying about hi m...twisting something he said, making him look like an enemy of the country...to get hi m in trouble with the officials, or frame him with a woman. She could be plante d as his secretary to have an affair with him. Once we had a pastor called to a home late at night. On the wa y, we had a woman in distress on the side of the road...He stopped to help.

When he proves his innocence, it's too late. The news media has alr eady made him look guilty. \"His credit can be messed up, like through credit cards. Everybody is told but him, putting him in a mess. Later they apologize for the mix-up...When it's too late. All this is to make him look bad. Secret phone calls accusing his wife or child ren of obscene acts...These are only a few things to make him look bad. By now he is considered unreliable and branded as a liar and a thief!\" 2. Isolation. A letter-writing and whisperi ng campaign get started saying he is too controversial...He is a trouble-maker, thos e opposing his stand call him an enemy causing division. He's against unity... He's not showing G od's love! He has his ow n strange doctrines or beliefs. He is left alone with pastor friends. \"A new lie is spread sayi ng, \"He had a nervous break- down. So everything he says is unreliable.\" Most of them give in and compromise...it is much easier than facing the heat. Isolation is used to force them out of the ministry.\" 3. When he believes he has a call from God and will not compromise under all this pressure from other pastors, friends(? ), and family...then strange things happen. \"He is hit by a car in an accident, goes to the hospital. Some nurse pulls the plug on his oxygen, or there's a mix-up in medicene. He gets complica tions and dies. He can die of food poisoning or be fed mind changing dr ugs putting him in a mental institution. \"He can have a mysterious fight with a stranger who knifes him in the dark...or a contract is place on him for assassination by a bullet. As you can see, we are at war!\" 3 For those interested, contact Dr . Rivera for the details of how he destroyed a Christian seminary for the Masonic controlled Jesuits before coming to Christ. The basics of the story is in Alberto. GO NEW AGE OR BANKRUPT Small groups of disciples, trained by leading oc cultic Freemasons have been infiltrated into Christian churches. The main purpo se now is to re-align these c hurches with New Age thinking. However, should they desire, they are also in a position to promote financial schemes that often seem to be great at first, but end up bankrupting the churches. 4 JIM JONES One of the best kept secrets by the Media was that Jim Jones' group was a New Age Christian church.

GETS IN TO CHRISTIAN BASHING An 800-page report published by U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services and entitled \"Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Yout h Suicide\" (Jan. 1989) blames religion for contributing to \"Gay Male and Y outh Suicide.\" Paul Gibson, a San Francisco therapist wrote the report. According to the report churches cause \"unresol vable internal conflicts for youth who adhere to their faith but believe they will not change their sexual orientation.\" This government study concludes that churches need to change thei r beliefs concerning homosexuality. \"Religion needs to reassess homosexuality in a positive context...,\" According to this report homosexuality is a \"natural and healthy expressi on of human sexuality.\" It goe s on to recommend certain youth programs for homosexuals. This is all a slow but steady slander of the Christians, in order for the public to acquiesce when the IRS pulls churches' tax-exempt stat us for not advocating hom osexuality. The IRS has already pulled the tax-exempt status on several religious groups whose teachings it disliked. 5 Words like \"right-wing extremist\", \"bigot\", a nd \"moralist\" are used of anyone who opposes the liberal New Order agenda. The Christians ar e caught coming and going. If they stand up for their Bible-based convictions they are named \"bi gots\". If they slip, they are hypocrites. If they don't have any Bible-based convic tions they fit in with the New Order plans to continue religion—masonic religion, which has a totally different morality than Bible-based faiths can accept, and is part of a plan for the total enslavement of world to an elite rulership. THE IRS IS PRIME INSTRU MENT TO CREATE SCANDAL The book To Harass Our People. The IRS and Go vernment Abuse of Power was written by a Congressman George Hansen. Th e IRS leaked false information to try to ruin his campaign, because he had begun exposing them. After hi s book came out, they have managed to get him in prison. Hansen's book documen ts many cases of innocent people being framed. The stories are heartbreakers, and many of the IR S's targets are moral upright Chri stians that are opposed to the New Order's agenda. Anyone who reads Hansen's book, will learn to discount any media stories about so-and-so cheating on his taxes. For instance, when Pastor Robert McCurry of Calvary Temple in East Point, GA printed exposes of improper IRS activities, the IRS on Oct. 11, 1983 sent the Pastor's church a letter telling the church it owed $213,416.16 in taxes, with interest and penalties adding up to nearly a million. This was supposedly fo r money that the church had w ithheld from employees saleries, but never paid the IRS. The church had 30 days to pay. The interest ing part of the story is that the church had NO employees during that ti me period to withhold taxes from saleries. 6 There are few steps that a person can attempt in such a case, and there is no legal protection against such awesome manuevers. 7 Those who have faced the IRS have learned the IRS becomes the"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"judge and jury, and they seldom defeat them self.

He was also excepti onally his own thinker. He ch anged his mind so many times during his life, that some historians think he was mad. He certainly left his own followers confused. Educated in England, and friends with Cooke and many other prominent people of Elizabethian England, Roger Williams could ha ve lived a comfortable life if he had so chosen. Instead, Williams went to the Puritan settlements in Ne w England. Considering all churches to be heresies, he seperated himself alone in Rhode Island after ma king himself a thorough nuisance to the Puritans, where others jo ined him. King Charles II granted him a special charter which instituted the opinions: liberty of conscience with separation of church a nd state, and the rights of man. In London, Roger Williams had b een in touch with a small gr oup of Calvinistic \"Seekers.\" Oliver Cromwell, who argued fo r religious tolerance, was also involved with the Seekers 1 — although the term should not be taken to denote any specific group. The term meant those people looking for a restoration of the true church, and such people were of all types of theological positions. The Seeker desire for a re storation of the lost church seems to be in part a concept that the Fraternity of Rodmen and the Mormon church inherited. Roger Williams was apocalyptic in thinking. He believed that it was possible for Christians to live with Jews and Moslems in peace, and th at the Moslems and Jews intended no injury to the Christians, if treated pe acefully by the Christians. 2 (History doesn't square with that. How could Williams read about Christ and come up wi th that?) Roger Williams did put into practice his tolerance. He was well liked by the Indian s, and the apocalyptic Quakers that permeated Massachusetts Colony also in general could like him. The Quakers in Massachusetts, rejected Scriptur e as authority and belie ved in an inner light. Certain of them believed that Christ was born in th em, and that they were the saints to rule in the Kingdom of God. In 1700, Massachusetts was made up of abou t 80 communities, and Quakers were to be found at a variety of thes e including Duxbury, Mars hfield, and Bridgewater. These Quaker groups joined in to Quarterly and Monthly Meeti ngs such as the Sandwich and Scituate Quarterly Meeting, th e Rhode Island Quarterly, an d the Salem Quarterly Meeting. 3 The mystical influence of the Qu akers on New England should be borne in mind, and their connections with Rhode Island to o. It is not well known that th ey made up about a third of the population in Massachusetts colony. Roger Williams was Pre sident (essentially Governor) of Rhode Island, 1654-1657. When he died he was buried with military honors. Roger Williams' approach to church and state (a nd other ideas) were adopted. They influenced the adoption of our separa tion of church and state. Whether pro- or anti- Williams, a number of researchers are protesting that the image presented of Roger Willia ms today is a myth. 4 Without going into all the ins and outs of the myths about Williams, this Aut hor would encourage the Reader no t to simply sw allow Williams views on separation of Church and State without going to the scriptures. Af ter all, it is likely the reader would reject so me of the strange things Williams taught—even Williams himself rejected"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"his own teachings as he changed his course nume rous times. Williams woul d have rejected your baptism and your church too, as he did with all the churches of his day. He therefore is not the example of toleration that he is portrayed as being. The Baptist churches can be traced to Roger Williams. The Baptist churches are strong believers in separation of church and state. The Masonic Lodge s are strong believers in separation of church and state. The Baptist churches ha ve been heavily direct ed by Baptist Masons. The Baptist churches in the hands of the Masons have been a good instrument to destroy the influence of religion and the authority that God declares is his. That statement will come as a shock to many people, permit me to explain how it could be. When this Author became a born -again believer, he chose to be baptized by an independent Berean Baptist Church in his ar ea. I naturally, like millions of other Baptists never questioned the concept of Separation of Church and Stat e. As I matured in my understanding of the scriptures, I began to realize that what the Bap tist churches were calling \"separation of Church and State\" was not that at all. As I realized what Baptist Masons were really pushing, it then became apparent that they were not after \"Separ ation of Church and State\" in the context of freedom in Christ, but rather for the State to dict ate to the church what to do, which in its final form would be the same freedom of religion o ffered in Communist Russi a, which this Author would call \"Freedom from religion.\" Many Baptists supported the growth of the State unwittingly, not aware of the Scriptural princi ples that were being violated. The Scriptural concept of separation of church and state would be Christ 's statement to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God what is God's. The New World Order is against that. The World Order has been slowly en throning the State in the place of God. It is God's perogative to decide whether a man should live or di e, or whether a war should be fought, yet the Baptists go to war, thereby giving the State what belongs to God. This directly contradicts Heb 12:14, Mt 5:39, Mt 5:44, Mt 6:14, Mt 26:52, Jn 18:36, 2 Cor 10:3-5, Jn 13:34 and many other clear scriptures . (How vivid this Author remembers pro-War sermons in the Baptist church during the Vietnam War.) God has directed his people to take care of thei r own, providing their circuits with almoners and people to help the almoners , Acts 6:3-6, 1 Tim 5:9,10; Ro m. 16:1,2 and to rely on Him rather than the State for sustenance, see Ps. 118: 8, Ps. 37:25, 2 Ptr 2:3, Mt. 6:25-23. That is God's juridiction, but the Baptists have given this power to the State with their support for the Social Security program. Education is scripturally given to the parents as a responsibility, not to the State, but Baptist Masons have supported the State to have control over education. The earth and fulness thereof is the Lord's, but Baptist Masons have supported laws which declare the State to be final overlord. (Conse quently, the American people, whether native or otherwise, are being deprived of the land as scriptural principles would dictate.) Oaths were originally administered in the Unite d States on the Bible \"so help you God,\" or by affirmation. The courts upheld th is because they believed that at heism was extremely rare. Today, that Bible/God orientation is being replaced with swearing on penalty of perjury, which implies that the State has now taken over the role God wa s originally given. (The Christian according to Jesus is not to swear at all.) The Christian's allegiance should be to God and his people first, but the Baptist Masons give their first allegience to the Masonic Lodge. Christ is to be the head of the Christian churches, no matter wh at denomination or country they are in. But the Baptist Masons supported the pape rwork that so many churches signed that denies"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"Christ as head and declares that the attorney-general of the state is the head of their church. They did this for the Power's bribe that they could receive a tax-exemption. See photocopies of the Internal Revenue Code, U.S. Code Title 26 Sec. 501(c)(3). Any legislation that destoyed the Parachial Scho ols has been supported by the Masonic Lodges under the banner of separation of church and state. Every Ch ristian Biblical influence or Christian value has been attacked and is being eliminated from the educational system under the banner of separation of church and state. When separation of Church and State should be enfo rced to protect the church from state control, Masonry and Baptist Mas ons have been silent. They have repeatedly failed to stand up for the churches. They have been gung-ho when the Christian religion ha s been injured in the name of separation of ch urch and state. Therefore, this Aut hor concludes that Masonry, Baptist Masons or whoever, are in genera l in favor of control of relig ion and are not concerned with protecting Christ's viewpoint to rende r only to Caesar what is Caesars. What God has joined together let no man tear asunder—who joins couples in the covenant relation? God. However, the Mas ons under the banner of separa tion of State and Church now have ministers across the land performing marriages \" by the power vested in me by the State.\" Since when did the Constitution declare that marrying people was a duty of the government? But this is all trivial compared to the power the \"Christian\" Ma sons have been promoting for the State in regards to life. Birth control and abor tion is the first step towa rd State control of who is given the privilege of life and who is permitte d to live. The constituti onal right to live has been destroyed by an \"end-around\" attack. Ab ortion and population control don't just spell the death of unborn children , they spell the death of millions of undesirables in th e future as the World-Order exercises their concep t that life is but a privilege given by the state. In India, millions of forced sterilizations ha ve taken place. In China this has also occured too, but also there have been tight controls to keep families limited to one ba by. In Red China, elderly people are often given injections that kill them after they are place d in old folks homes. A proper understanding of what Authority God has given the State, would prevent Christians from supporting such things. The Masonic-Socialist run National Council of Churches advocated the recognition of Red China. 5 The NCC pronounced itself in favor of birt h control in a vote Fe b. 23, 1961. Their pronouncement at this time was in favor of gove rnmental aid to family planning. Governmental planning of family size is the fi rst step in the control of who liv es and who doesn't. This is not within the authority authorized by God to the government nor to the church. Separation of Church and State by Christ's defi nition, would take away the mora l right of churchmen to support Government control of population. The NCC supported the Supreme Court's (made by a bunch of Mason Su preme Court justices) decision to remove the Bible and Prayer from th e schools. Two NCC leaders issued statements in support of the decision saying, \"prayer is cheapened when it is used as a device to quiet unruly children and the Bible loses its true meaning wh en it is looked upon as a mo ral handbook for minor.\" 6 Education can not be separa ted from God and his moral code. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Take away that, and the Christian scri ptures are not in support of education. The scriptures condemn following after vain philosophies— and th at is what is being taught from Kindergarten on up— the vain philosophies. The NCC and the Masonic Lodges are not protesting the wide spread Hindu form of prayer called TM (transcendental meditation) that is be ing taught in many public schools, and has been for two decades now. Nor are th ey protesting other forms of i nvoking, and occultic prayers that"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"are being introduced into the curriculums of public schools. Therefore, this Author concludes that their stated claims in favor of Separation of C hurch and State are meant to primarily apply to situations where Christianity is under consider ation. And as already stated, when separating Church and State would help th e church, the Masons, ACLU, and others have a temporary loss of ardor and a memory lapse about separation of church and state. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF STATE ENCROACHMENT This Author has not conducted an exhaustive study of state encr oachment upon religion within the United States, but it is possible to give some examples that are representative of the type of actions that have frequently occured over the years. (As the reader has seen, the New World Order has control over the various religions and denominations throu gh many avenues besides the power of the State. Still the State is a powerful tool to limit and handicap religious elements that oppose the policies of the Ne w World Order.) Some examples: Jewish Mayor of New York City Edward Koch re fused to grant the Salvation Army a religious exemption from his executive order demanding no job discrimination against homosexuals. As a result the Salvation Army was to lose $ 4.4 million in 10 social service contracts. 7 On August 22, 1978, in the Federal Register the IRS announced their new policy that unless a parochial school could prove that it didn't racial ly discriminate it would lose its tax-exempt status. It later came out that the IRS interprete d the requisite minimum percentage of minority enrollment for private schools to be 20% of the minority school-age population in the community, and the employment of minority teacher s. Does the IRS have \"legal competence\" to regulate hiring and enrollment of church schools and churches? 8 On 13 February 1979 the IRS altered its pr ocedure by exempting Jewish, Roman Catholic, Muslim, and Amish schools. This action brought on the charge of anti-Protestant discrimination. But the dust hadn't settled on the IRS's plans, a nd more dust was raised by debate in the House of Representatives over the issue. IRS ARROGATES TO ITSELF THE RIGHT TO PROCLAIM WHAT IS A LEGITIMATE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION AND WHAT ISN'T. On February 11, 1976, the IRS announced that it would decide what organizations it could be called \"integrated auxiliaries of a church.\" On 4 Jan. 1977, they clarified this by saying an integrated auxiliary must be \"e xclusively religious\" and not edu cational, charitable, or literary. James E. Wood, Jr. of the Bap tist Joint Committee on Public A ffairs (BJCPA) was quoted as saying this represented \"serious encroachment of government on religion and an exercise of political authority totally unacceptable to the churches ...[the IRS] in effect, arrogated to itself the highly questionable role of determining what is and what is not 'religious activity of church agencies and institutions.'\" Form 990 was designed to give the IRS complete information on those groups the IRS did not want to call proper religions. 9 Interestingly, one of the groups the IRS has called spurious is the Identity movement churches, which believe that the Jewish pe ople are not God's chosen people a nd that the Anglo-Saxons are. It is a matter of belief who is God's chosen people—and the religious freedom to decide that issue should not be in the IRS's hands. Further, those church who do not have a hierar chy suffered greatly under the IRS rulings. Do you see a pattern? Does the reader see that the One-World-Power has actively promoted"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"hierarchies? Further, does the IRS have the right to define and restrict wh at the churches' mission should be? Recently, several magazines have had articles on the Credit voucher system that President Bush, the Brookings Institute and others of th e New Order have been advocating. The Credit vouchers give certain parents a voucher for the sum of money that the state presumably spends on the child in the public school and allows the pare nts to use this at the private school of their choice. However, the list of private schools allo wed is determined by the government. When one Wisconsin family put their children in a school found using the Bible, the school was notified by the government they needed to withdraw the use of the Bible or they would be removed from the voucher program. The school refused and was withdrawn from the program. The credit voucher system is another Trojan Horse gimic of the New Order to destroy the Parochial schools. It has possibilities of doing damage in several ways. THE STATE ELEVATED TO GODHOOD Fichte, Hegel, and Hitler to name a few felt the State should take over much of the role that is God's to have. A subtle form of this is ex tensively practiced alrea dy in the United States. Arthur Schlesinger for instance discarded moral principles and elevated the state to Godhood; he wrote, \"...the safest basis fo r decision in foreign policy lies not in attempts to determine what is right or wrong but in attempts to determine the national interest.\" 10 National interest, or the State, is the highest basis for human d ecisions. This thinking is the philosophy of the CIA, the FBI, and the military . Numerous CIA agents have been bothered by what they have been ordered to do. But they are convinced that th ey are doing it for the interests of the nation, (whatever that is). Wh at the interests of the nation rea lly translates in to, in practice, is the desires of the One-World-Order. If the rule rs of the New Order are the state in essence, and the state is god, they are in effect our gods. This is why in places like Communist China and Romania the rulers of state have been treated like divine gods. For example, Mao tse Tung was worshipped. The obvious answer for th e Christians is either to reject th is god called the state a. militantly, that is by setting up their own government or opposing the state politically , or b. to reject it passively by ignoring its pretensions to godhood. Policemen that arrest pro-life activ ists on the grounds that it is in the national interest and that they are preventing the church fro m interfering in the state are c onfused. They are elevating the state to godhood, which is idolat ry. They as agents of the state are actually going where the state doesn't belong. The Scriptures warn the Christia n not to have fellowship with demons, because one cannot fellowship at both the Lo rd's table and have fellowship with demons. The Psalms tell us that evil laws are the result of the devil, and that we fellowship with devils by enforcing evil laws. Rather than viewing its duty as one of limiting and challenging faith, th e state should realize its job is the protection of the faiths of its people in God. NOTES 1. Roger Williams, p. 29 2.

The Genera l Services Administration would actually be in charge of confiscation of private property for gov ernment use. The Labor Dept. will be in charge of allocating manpower to where it is needed. The Transportation De pt. working with the military would have responsibility to move you to the c oncentration camp. They will in many areas do this by rail, which is why they have selected sites close to rail lines. The two code names of the operations are Operation Cable Splicer (Army Civil Affairs Units take over) and Operation Ga rden Plot (the Martial Law pr ogram). The two operations go together. According to Deputy Attorney General of Calif., who was part of the program anyone who attacks the state—even verb ally—is an enemy of the state. A clearing house to unify the po lice of the various nations is already functioning in Rome. The documentation of all this was originally collected by William R. Pabst, Houston, TX. According to one policeman, the lists of who to arrest have alrea dy been made up. He happened to see the lists. Many observers have conclude d the 35 military bases shut down around the United States are so that the New World Order will have a pl ace to put the many peopl e arrested in \"drug sweeps.\" Those people will be put to work as slav e labor to build more prisons, so that more people in turn can be arrested. The people that ar e indicating such things, are people with fairly good sources. The Writ of Habeus Corpus has been amended to a legal appeal proce ss that could take years. The exclusionary rule has been amende d, the police now only n eed to show \"good faith\" rather than probable cause. Th is legalese means that they now have total police power. It is impossible to show that the police didn't have \"good faith\" whatever that is. It is somewhat akin to trying to disprove divorce on grounds of incompatibility—if one says you are incompatible, then you are, whether the other one disagrees. The Reco Act which allo ws the police to knock down doors, is just one more terrifying police power. HR-9-49 is a nightmare; it eliminated Cruel and Unusual punishment. Step by step they have built their police state, and the American peopl e have been watching their sit-coms and football games. It seems no amount of warning has stirred the American convictions that this is the La nd of the Free that God has built, and forever will be. No matter how bad critics say the situation is , many Americans feel they shoul d be ignored because the rest of the world is (they believe) worse off.

They have effectively sold it to the American people, because the American pe ople are argueably perhaps the mo st deceived in the world. The deception has worked on th e Americans because the facade of a \"free press\" has been maintained.

I feel safer because of the crackdown.\" 1 Let the record show: Security measures—as in Maximum Security. Those radio stations that have allowed talk hosts to speak about what the New World Order is actually doing have been squash ed and taken off the air. This has happened for many years, but has intensified in this area particularly this year—1991. President Carter create d FEMA (Federal Em ergency Management Agen cy.) Samuel Huntington of the Trilateral Commission had prepared th e Presidential Review Me morandum 32 upon which the 1979 Executive Order establishing FEMA was based on. The agency has the Emergency Power to relocate millions of work ers as it pleases, reorganize national industry and banking, and distribute all economic resources (rationing, etc.) and transportati on. After it became operational it needed to be tested. The Thr ee Mile Accident was, it seems, manufactured in order to let the agency test its wings. How else does one explai n the mysterious nature of the accident, that investigators could not even locate whoever closed the valves of the backup cooling pumps which would have kept the re actor from overheating? 2 Further, it is clear that the release of radiation was greatly blown out of proportion. But FEMA got their first chance to go into action. Next, came the Cuban boat crisis. Again, the whole emergency wa s a very suspicious affair, and FEMA got the chance to test its abilities to relocate thousands of people throughout the U.S. Canada was tested in Oct. 1970 when their Prime Minister Trudeau inv oked the War Measures Act which suspends the Canadian Bill of Rights, and the people of Canada did not protest. Unless more North Americans ge t information like this book, it appears that most people will not question a dictatorship taking over. THE FOLLOWING IS A CHRONOLOGY OF HOW THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS DEVELOPED The War on Drugs has been planned for a long time. A secret government study had concluded that a substitute for actual war would be wort hwhile to develop. In 1961, a study group was initiated and their report became known as the Report from Iron Mountain. Later President Johnson established the Ackley Committee which also went to work studying the same proposal. The idea was that the government considered givi ng the people peace, but they needed something to substitute for war to continue their control of the people. On e of the solutions was to create a drug war. (By the way it is believed that th e secret committee that put together the Iron Mountain Report consisted of Erick Fromm, Sa muel P. Huntington, Henry Kissinger, Prof. Quigley, Vincent P. Rock, B.F. Sk inner, and Edward Teller. It is possible that Leonard C. Lewin in the telecommunications field was also part of the group.) The highest government authorities have ordere d police heads not to crack down hard on drug dealers and crack-houses. This is quietly been done in order to keep the \"epidemic\" out of control. It is very frustrating for many policemen who see that th ey could do more, and be more effective, and then to have th eir hands tied. Some of these po lice and their families are quietly telling of their frustrations in this regards."},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"Early 1960's- major psychedelics like LSD are introduced to co llege campuses by the CIA.

The secret process of transferring 1 billion dolla rs worth of U.S. military hardware and surplus equipment begins. During this period $200 worth of equipment is shipped backed secretly by credit back by the U.S. taxpayer. June, 1987- Col.

The Author was not led to give the bulk of the message that the Sp irit has given him at this time. - A shout of hope. - A compilation in succinct form of Satan's plan s and God's plans for this day and age. Learn what both kingdoms' goals are. \"Beloved, do not think it strange c oncerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; but rejoice to the extent that you partake of the Christ's sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.\" I Ptr 4:12- 13 \"Why do the nations rage, And the people plot a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the LORD and against His Anointed, saying, \"Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away their cords from us....Now therefore, be wise, O kings; Be instructed, you judges of the earth. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest He be angr y, And you perish in the way, When His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him.\" Ps. 2:1-3, 10-12 \"See then that you walk circumspectly, not as f ools but as wise, redeem ing the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be unwise...\" Eph 5:15-17 \"...stand fast in the Lord, beloved.\" Phil 4:1 \"But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come...But you ha ve carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, l ongsuffering love, perseverance, persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, Ic onium, at Lystra-what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord deliv ered me. Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.\" 2 Tim 3:1, 10-11. The judgement of God begins in the House of th e Lord. He will discipline those that he loves. \"I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I could wish you were cold or hot... Because you say,' I am rich, have become wea lthy, and have need of nothing'-and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, an d naked-I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich...As ma ny as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent.\" Rv 3:15-19 SATISFACTION \"Consider mine enemies, for th ey are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred\" Ps 25:19 There is nothing more satisfying to the committe d Christian than to follow Christ's example."},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"There were times when Christ fled to avoid being captured, but when it was time according to the Spirit he was willing to stand and suffer . In standing up for truth, he suffered. His suffering gave God a warrant to step in and bring judgement and justice upon the situation. A similar pattern can be seen in ancient Israel. The difference wa s that they had turned away from God's authority. God sent the Assyrian army as a judgement upon his people.(Hos 11:5, Is 7 & 8) Good King Hezekiah (727-698 B.C.) repented and did what was good in the Lord's sight. When the Assyrians asked Hezekiah to make peace and quit trusting in God, he refused. Hezekiah didn't want to avoid suffering when he prayed. Rather, he prayed that God would bring about a victory so that the world would glorif y God. Still Hezekiah's ki ngdom was mauled fairly badly by the Assyrian army. (We know that from non-Biblical historical records.) However, Hezekiah's faith never wa vered.(2 Kgs 18:3-6) He knew that this was God's way of allowing sin to reap its own reward. When the Assyrians overstepped the limits that God's purifying called for, Yahweh God stepped in and brought justice to the Assyrian army, i.e. they were destroyed as they encircled Jerusalem.(details in 2 Kgs 19:35) (King Hezekiah built an underground water system into Jerusalem that still exists. For those tourists, like this Author, who know who Hezekiah was, it was a special treat to see this tunnel, a monument to a ma n of great faith.) Christians remember, \"Who shall separate us fro m the love of Christ?...Rm 8:35-39 \"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial whic h is to try you...\" \"Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wi les of the devil...against spiritual wickedness in high places.\" Eph 6:11, 12 Not only is it impossible to please God without faith (Heb 11:6), faith- simple pure blind faith- in the Lord God Almighty is our shield of protection. (Eph 6:16) I would strongly encourage every Christian to ch allenge everything he believes and his entire behavior until he is solidly convinced that he ha s the truth as revealed by the Holy Spirit through the Scriptures and personal reve lation and testimony. At the same time, we need to encourage each other to have total faith in the Lord God Almighty and to disregard our own fears or perceptions that might drag our faith down. If you have not sought the will of God and prayed and studied in His Word, you have not earned the right to express an opinion on what is truth. John Calvin and Martin Luther both responded to their fears by trying use political power to stop the enemy. Burning Servetus at the stake, (although Calvin was agains t such a cruel method) did more harm than good to the cause of Christ and Calvin's desire for the Bible to become the daily guide for people's life, than if they had allowed Servetus to preach. There is a way that seemeth right but the end thereof is death. Th e power that will conquer the New Order Power must derive its power from the fact it is moral. When evil fails, men wi ll turn to good, and it is at that time, that the world will be ready for a revival, a global response to repent, Lord Willing. Meanwhile, Christians will be faced with a nu mber of difficult decisions. The Christian will get lost unless he commits himself to doing G od's will no matter what the cost. If you are willing to commit yourself without reserva tion to God, He will indeed show you His will. Extremely few people have ever taken that step . \"Taste the Lord and know that he is good.\" But few have ever had the faith to really taste. It means discardi ng preconceived notions, and tasting the Lord God. (Have you tried to convince a child to taste something they don' t like.) The Lord will show you his will through the Word, through Prophets who ha ve the testimony of consecrated servants of God, through mature Christian c ounsel, through circumstances and an inner witness. If you pray through a situation, eventually you will get thr ough to God. God is holy, set apart from evil, so"},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"we can be our own biggest barrier to communicati on with God. \"Let the peace of God rule in your hearts.\" Having the peace of God improves the communication level. Scriptures declare that those w ho really love the truth will not be deceived in the last days. When the enemy approaches the watchman sounds the trumpet to call the troops into formation. Wake up, look, and move. The love of God will motivate you to stand up for what is right, for what is truth. The world is la ughing at the church. Jesus said \"...you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.\" Jn 16:20. It is ti me for the men and women of God to allow God to fill their lives to point that we are falling on our faces, and receiving the Power of God. The mission of the Holy Spirit is to convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and judgement. Cf. Jn 16:7-8. Th ere is much more to be sa id in facing the enemy than this chapter will tell you. Jesus said, \"I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.\" Jn 16:12. This author also has many things that the Spirit of God has revealed and laid on his heart. But as I sit and write this I feel a check. I will give the first step, and pray you step it. And again although this chapter's message is the first step toward facing the enemy, this author and also the Spirit of God both have more to say. The reader has been shown what the enemy has done. The readers eyes are opened, and he or she can make decisions base d on the more accurate knowledge provided in Be Wise As Serpents. The reader must not stop he re with this chapter. The reader must learn about his spiritual we apons and armor. This book will not show you how to deal with evil spirits, but at some point you will need to move against them, and you will not be able to do this if you do not even belie ve in fighting evil spirits. But even now a new elect is being trained who will know how to go forth in Jesus's na me and to take cities for the glory of God. REJECT THEIR NEW MESSIAH There is abundant evid ence that they are preparing several men, only one is ne eded to rule the world as a King-Priest. To rule men with au thority over their political and their religious allegiences. Whether 2 Thes. 2:3,4 is specifically refering to our day and age or not when it warns of an anti-Christ, the warni ng is still of value. \"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falli ng away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all th at is called God.\" EMBRACE THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT Satan even in Christ's day coul d offer to Christ the Nations of the World. Christ therefore faced the same situation as exists today. Ch rist's words then, are appropriate to ask the conspiracy, \"What does it profit a man that he s hould gain the whole world but lose his soul?\" The world has rejected Christ's Sermon on the Mo unt as impractical idealism. It has rejected the Sermon on the Mount supposed ly for intellectual reasons, but deep down the re al reasons are moral ones that prevent them from seeing the glory of God's ways. It is very rare that a man will try Christ's teachings out. So certainly, the re jection of Christ's Sermon on the Mount is not because they have failed when tr ied. Christ doesn't call people to an idiotic blind faith. He challenges people to test out what he is saying to see if it is from God. \"My doctine is not Mine, but His who sent me.\" Jn 7:15 \"If anyone wants to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whethe r I speak on my own authority.\" Jn 7:17 Try it you'll like it—try it, you'll learn it's from God. The Sermon on the Mount is Christ's advice in a nutshell on how to deal with the world-wide forces of evil."},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"We have a choice, go with the flow of Medi a garbage and their value system, or anchor ourselves in the time-tested advi ce of the ancient wisdom of that all-time best seller, the Word of God, aka The Holy Bible. You will never be able to answer everything with your intellect. Even the greatest philosophers and thinkers are unable to do that, so w hy would you expect that you will instantly know everything as a Christian? In this sense you will need simple faith. Some people miss out on God's power because they feel they can't step out and act on faith unl ess they understand more, and yet simple faith calls them to respond where they are at. Perhaps this simple faith, this confident trust in God which is called simple faith , might best be called \"blind\" faith. This is not the cliche \"blind faith\", but the type of faith Abraham had when he le ft his homeland. Allow yourself to meet God a nd obey him just where you are at in understanding. To obey in faith you will need to have this type of faith in spite of your unanswered intelle ctual questions. Many of the \"intellectual\" questions do not have clear answ ers because they really need to be asked as a spiritual question. If you follow th e world's approach to any num ber of issues you won't even be asking the right questions concerning the topic at hand. Just as we follow the Spirit's direction, we mu st also follow our consciences. The advice to always follow our consciences is good advice. If we do not listen to our consciences we singe them and they no longer advise us. Unlike the Spirit, our cons ciences may be quite wrong, so we constantly work at retraining them to be mo re in line with the Spirit. Gradually our whole being, will be turned over to God. One of our chief parts the tongue ma y be one of the more external testimonies of the Spirit's control. REJECT THEIR GNOSTIC HIERARCHIES Remember, how the nation of Israel wanted a pow erful ruler? Many today, including the Jews, want a powerful international rule r. But where did Israel's desire for a powerful ruler lead to? \"Let us be like the nations...and worship wood and stone.\" Ez 20:32 The world today including religion is enthralled with their bu ilding projects and idols. It is lik e in the days of Genesis, when God observed how the nations of the world were unified under one rulership. God said, \"Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they purpose to do will be withheld from them.\" That was the problem. There was no longer any limits to the power evil could do. We are faced with the same thing. If the New World Orde r takes control, nothing will be withheld from them. The limits to the evil they can do will be gone. Even Hitler had his limitations. This New World Order will know no limits . Absolute power corrupts abso lutely. They will retain for themselves the power to know God. They will want men to come to thei r Gnostic varieties of religion. As long as people do not buy this clap-trap, a nd realize God is assessibl e to all mankind, they will score a victory against the One-World-Order. In response to the Gnostic religions holding the people in bondage, John the Baptist and Chri st preached a message calling the people to A COMPLETE CHANGE OF MIND (Metanoia). That is the message of this book. This book suggests we change our mind comp letely. We should not look to Satan's New World Order for truth. They have lied to us in almost every aspect of life. Nor can we continue going alo ng with the way the crowd does things, so we can be popular. Christ told his disciples \"Do not be like them.\" This echoes the Levites call to holiness, \"You shall not do as they do.\" Lev 18:3 Those who want friendship evangelism, should remind"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"themselves that the world can befrie nd itself, but it doesn't have a faith in their Creator. It is fine to be friends, it is even better to allo w them to witness the beauty of faith. MEETING A NEED THAT THE NEW ORDER CANT The New World Order places a lot of stock in economics . This is clearly th e thinking of the Jewish International Overlords which is filteri ng down to the rank and file. Marx's Dialectic Materialism was based on man' s rationality with a heavy empha sis on economics, and ignored the spiritual side of man. This goes back to Hegel who stat ed, \"If all of the abso lute development of rationality is within the human sphere, and is carried out by man, then man is true God. The human being is the true God.\" (From Socrates to Sart re, by T.Z. Lavine, p. 266) In contrast to this Jesus calle d men not Gods, but sl aves -unless men are willing to break the bonds of sin by coming to his word they re main in slavery. \"I f ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know th e truth, and the truth shall make you free.\" They answered hi m, \"We be Abraham's se ed, and were ne ver in bondage to any man, how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered them. \"Verily, verily I say unto you, Whosoever committe th sin is the servant of sin.\" YOU ARE FREE, THEY ARE THE SLAVES If you have read this book and r eceived the Truth—you are the free person, the New World Order are the ones in b ondage. Keep that in mi nd. No matter what the ou tward appearances, they are the slaves. They are slaves to their own lies, their own greed, and to their own passions. Those masters will be harsh masters. Just ask the slave of alcoha l, or the slave of drugs, or the slave of uncontrolled buying, or the slave of uncontrolled lusts. Contrariwise, it is of little value for us to be concerned about the actions of others to enslave us, if we will not take actions within our own personal power to free ourselves of the enslavement of Satan's drugs, alcohal, academ ic philosophies, etc. If you are unable to free yourself from such bondage , kneel before Christ, and confe ss your sins and spiritual poverty. Blessed are the poor in spirit. MORAL FREEDOM is not the right to do what ever you want, it is the POWER to do what you ought. That is the power you have, that th e New World Order doesn't. There is a moral power in being willing to suffer for righte ousness sake when the Lord asks you to. YOU HAVE FREEDOM, TH EY ARE IN PRISON The Hindu world view can not accept reality for it seems to them that reality is a terrible prison; Hinduism's approach to the problem is to convince themse lves that realit y is an illusion. The Christian should bear in mind this is their way of mentally escaping from the reality that the world is a prison. And it proves that the worl d is a prison for the ungodly. The ungodly deny they are in jail, for they do not want to face up to the fact they will some day go before a judge and receive a sentence. However, you love the taste of your freedom in Christ. The ungodly will not understand your freedom in Christ, for to understand it means to ad mit they are in prison. They are jealous of your joy, and wish to destroy it. And who is the warden of their prison? Oh, they have such a wonderful Overseer Prince, his name is Satan, aka Sanat or Lucifer. He can really look like a handsome charming angel of light."},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"But he likes his inmates where they are. Why? Because he wants to use them and destroy them. But why destroy them, you may wonde r. Because he hates the Creat or and is jealous. He seeks to destory God's creation, not just mankind. You might wonder who would join forces with someone who wants to destroy them? You can observe the answer around you, how many people are self-destr uctive? Unfortunately, people are not allowing themselves to taste freedom, they are born in captivity and don't know what they are missing. They do think, but their th inking abilities are manipulated by deceptive forces. Satan builds temples, and churches . People go to Satan's Christia n churches and find that they are still in prison. They must taste the Lord and se e that there is something better than their daily fare. The good news of Christ's salvation is found in sc ripture, \"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me, Because the Lord has annointed Me To preac h good tidings to the poor ; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives, And the opening of the prison to those who are bound;\" (Is 61:1) Jesus told the synagogue that he was fulfillment of those scriptures. (Lk 4:18-21) Christian, forsake your prison wa ys (the world's ways). Get rid of your prison clothes (worldly clothes). Seek out the banquet Christ has prepared for you. Mt 22:2, Lk 14:16 It is better to turn back in the middle of travel, than to continue to go the wrong direction. Why aren't more going to the banquet? It remi nds me of inviting peopl e to a free meal at church, they won't come. They might do about a nything for a buck, and to get something free, but they are afraid to set foot in a church. They have been caressed with the lies of demons. The demons have pictured freedom in Christ as old-fashioned somethin g outdated and no longer applicable to life. The demons have labeled it \"Pollyanish\", or as bigoted and mean, or some other distortion. To prevent further escapes from his prison, the Warden is convincing the inmates into attacking those who are seeking freedom. The inmates are told if they don't police themselves, they will not advance, life w ill not get better. Toda y, Satan's inmates are convinced that Christians are holding the world back from progress. They are too blind to see the deception, and how they are helping build their own prison. In their muddled crusade for their prison warden they have developed a feigned holiness. As th eir minds are befuddled, they are willing to use false pretenses to destroy the Christians. The Scriptures say \"Yea, the ti me cometh, that whosoever kille th you, will think he doeth God service.\" Jn 16:1-4. But why does this surprise us? If these peopl e can convince themselves that murdering innocent children (abortion) is good, then it is no su rprise they will murd er innocent adults and pronounce it good. This is but a sample of how craz y with hate the inmates are toward those who have freedom in Christ. For instance, when men lik e Jack Mohr have tried to warn Christians and expose the deceitful warden, he has been denounced and ignored by \"C hristians.\" This indicat es that either many Christians are actually still inmate s, or have been released from prison but have decided to put handcuffs and shackles back on themselves. Drop all these weights and run the race before you dear Christian. Christians are not doing their job of testing th e spirits, if you see \"Christians\" who hands are bloody that ought to send red flags to your brain. When Christ said, \"Do men gather grapes of thorns?\" Mt 7:16, he was trying to warn his di sciples that good fruit doesn't come out of evil men, no matter how deceptive the fru it appears. Likewise, I can not predict what the Masons will"},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"do, nor if they will be tolerant in the future as they claim they are. But their men at the top belong to Satan, and worship Lu cifer. Shall we gather good grapes from thorns? How much tolerance did the Masonic-run French Revolution have? How real is Masonic tolerance when during this century they have claimed in their Ne w Age magazine to respect all religions, but until the 1960's repeatedly wrote ex treme Anti-Catholic articles. Be sly with Satan's empire. Be as wise as serpents, but harmless as doves. We will not overwhelm them by over threaten ing them on one issue alone, but many issues, especially the moral issues. There are many issues that they must guard against. There are countless lies they are trying to cover. Be aware you are part of a vast group of di sciples dedicated to the biggest challenge ever whic h is to bring free dom to mankind. The Christia n through the blood of Christ has power over demons. \"The body they may kill: God's truth abideth still\" (trans. of Luther's A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.) A mighty fortress is our God A bulwark never failing; Our helper He, amid the flood Of mortal ills prevailing. For still our ancient foe Doth seek to work us woe; His craft and power are great, And armed with cruel hate, On earth is not his equal. For the Christian we know who is behind all the channeled spirit s, their messages of a coming New Age, etc. For the Christian, we know that we are the only group th at is warning mankind of his sinful nature, and his inability to solve hi s own problems. That is a message they do not want to hear. But it is a message, they will eith er learn in hope, or in despair when they learn the hard way. Let us learn thei r needs and minister to them. CHRIST WARNED US OF THIS Christ told us that the wheat and the tares w ould grow up together. That is the condition of the church today-totally infiltr ated, and mixed with evil. The Churches of Christendom are a mission field for the disciple of Jesus Christ. Christ also told us that Satan's Kingdom is not divided against itself or else it could not continue functioning. Th is book is the result of research and the knowledge that comes from confidential sources in the New Order that Satan's ki ngdom is indeed one m onolithic coordinated Power structure that is physically in communicatio n with its various parts. If you some how failed to realize that the Watchtower leaders, the Mo rmon leaders, the Masons , and other groups are actually in communication with and coordinati ng their activities, then you have missed an important message of this book. BUT AREN'T THERE ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSED TO THE NEW WORLD ORDER One of the hardest items to tell the reader is that many of the people pretending to be on our side aren't. The New World Order is not stupid. They are trying to stay one jump ahead of the opposition. They plant their people as leaders of the opposition. That seems to be the only"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"explanation for much of what is happening. Th e reader should investigate all organizations, before he contributes to their cause. I remember when I worked in a particular fa ctory the foremen would come around and tell us how we weren't doing our jobs as they wanted them done. I would listen and at times if I were asked tell the foremen honestly that what they were saying wouldn't work. The other workers who were not Christians would smile big and say \"Sure, we'll do it no problem.\" After the supervisor would leave, I would fi nd myself trying hard to meet the standard the supervisor had left, while the others wouldn't even try it. I woul d be correct that the e xpectations were out of order, but its doubtful that the foremen ever pick ed up that I was the onl y one really trying to achiveve their impossible expectations, even though I was the only one honest about its feasibility. Likewise, I detect many Christians ar e smiling and saying all the right things from the pulpit. Love your Christian brot her, hallelujah, I belie ve in God, praise th e Lord, etc. but they have no intention of doing the will of God. Most people like those supervisors are quite content to look on the surface of things. Love is su rrender to His will. God makes his own decisions without asking us our opinions. To smile at God and make false promises is not acceptable. Without love (surrender to his will) toward G od (cf. Cor.) then our actions are a waste. Apparently, many ministers feel th at they need to smile and tell the people what they want to hear, and the people in tu rn will idolize them. There are but two kingdoms, Satan's and Christ's. In None Dare To Call It Conspiracy, p. 136, people are advised to go to the John Birch Society. The John Birch Society was started by a high ranking Mason who used Rockefeller money. Further, Gary Allen's book gets recommendation's from peopl e in the establishment, and it is very flattering of men who were prominan t Masons involved with the New World Order. Was Gary Allen misinforme d, sidetracked, or what? Some of these men have so many connections to the New World Order, and so much knowledge that it is almost impossible that they are simply misinformed. Craig Hulet, who has a number of aliases and driver's licenses, and who did intelligence work for the New Order, is warning people about the coming One-Worl d-Government. However, much of his information even when true is in a se nse \"disinformation\", in spite of how much good indepth information he has. A nd he has no program to counter the New Order. He speaks in Episcopalian Churches, and at hi s public meetings license plat es numbers are taken down by men, and the people attending targ eted for destruction. Whether Craig is involved with this scheme to destroy those who attend, or not, is difficult to say. However, this Author knows personally of someone who was almost destroye d after coming in contact with Craig Hulet. In communist countries, it has been a popular method to kill opposition, by allowing leaders to stand up and allow the Authorities to identify who their hidden silent opposition are. This was the concept behind what happened at Tiennamen Square. Those people are identified, and when the boom falls, then all of these people are take n out of circulation from the general population. By using people like Hulet (whether he in partic ular is used or not—pe ople like him are used), they have assembled their lists of people to take out of circulation. There are infiltrators who are helping them assemble lists of patriots, and devout Christian leaders. Ex-intelligence men who have seen the plans say that they intend to arrest the Christians on a holiday like Thanksgiving Day when they can find the most people home.

If you are going to oppose the New World Order, start your own group. Then at least you know who the head of it is. THE NEW WINE BELONGS IN A NEW WINE SKIN If you start it on the principles of the Scriptures then hopefully you will want it free of all the corrupting principles of the chur ches that have compromised with the Satanic New World Order. Turn to the Scriptures and base what you do on a fresh leading of the Spirit and the Word, rather than continueing the same inade quate methods of the spiritually dead churches. Keep two goals in mind, shake up the world for Christ a nd then reconcile them to their Creator. THE OLD INSTITUTIONS HAVE FAILED A number of the prominant John Birchers caught on to how thei r goals were being subverted by the One-World-Order at the top of their organization and left. If you feel you have legitimate complaints agains t some other group, you are best to forgive and forget, and concentrate on d ealing with the Satanist's One- World-Order. If you are going to escape the One-World-Order's system, you will have to be part of another system. To be part of Christ's Kingdom's system is going to take effort on your part to learn and do things God's way. All scripture is given by inspiration of God a nd is provitable for reproof, instruction in righteousness, and doctrine. When Paul said this there was no New Testam ent, he was referring to the Old Testament. THE NEW WORLD ORDER IS DIVI DING US AGAINST OURSELVES The Ku Klux Klan is considered a protestant organization, but it has clandestinly received Catholic help early on? Why? Because the Klan discredits the Protestants. Agents provacateurs, including FBI men ruin the intentions of the those who are in the Kl an. While some men may join the Klan because it is the only way they see to defend what they believe in, they unfortunately are being manipulated. An analogy to this is, Did the Hollywood character of Archie Bunker help or hurt the th ings Archie Bunker believed in? Bl acks aren't a big threat to the white men like the propoganda pe ople are instilling into Southe rner's minds. The same people at the top are agitating both sides to get and keep a conflict going betw een whites and blacks. It is to the point that whites and blacks had better forget their diffe rences, and realize the common man everywhere is being led into slavery. Indeed, like the Pied Piper, the common man is willingly going into slavery. Under a banner of socialism for the common man, the Power elite is creating a World Dictatorship. Demonic led people battle each other in hopes to entice God's people to get involved in their fights. These are traps. The Caucausian, the Negroid, the Oriental race s should each respect each other. That doesn't mean they need to try to become like the othe rs. God has a purpose and a plan for each tribe and nation. The nations are still existing as nations in heaven according to the book of Revelations. Let us recognize our real enemies. For instance, the Protestants had best quit de nouncing each other over so me trivial doctrinal issue. The real enemy is not that someone's decl ension of the Greek is inadequate, but that an enormous rival kingdom to Christ's kingdom is strongly in place. In other words, the problem is not how the JWs have mistranslated Jn 1:1 but that they have given th eir allegiance to a false"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"authority. If we get to the real problem, the root of why they mi stranslate Jn 1:1, it goes back to that the false author ity called the Watchtower Society taught them that. The Kingdom of God In the OT the kingdom (i.e. the rule or s overeignty) of God means his almighty power, ordering the created world and establishing with in it righteousness and justice, the vindication of his people, and merc y and deliverance for th e sick, and the oppressed. In the NT no precise definition can be given, because according to the context the term Kingdom of God my cover a wide range of me anings including \"sovereignty\", \"kingship\", \"exercise of royal authority,\" \"r eign,\" and \"territory ruled by a king.\" In some passages it is equated in a sense with eternal lif e, in others the church. In so me passages it is related to the gospel, salvation, repentance, and the new birt h. Jesus' disciples become kingdom rulers and priests. A summary that catches the concept of the Kingdom is: The Lord God omnipotent reigns. And if you are of the kingdom of God, then that means He is reigning in your life; if He is not, then you are not of His kingdom—it is that simple. INTRODUCING A PROBLEM Part of the problem within Christendom is th e way the gospel is defined and presented to people. The following pages are designed to pull people away from the ru t Christendom is in, but it is only a mere introduc tion to call God's people to reth ink God's gospel and salvation. Charles Hodges is but one of se veral brothers-in-Christ who ha ve realized that Rom. 5:18, \"Therefore as by the offense of one judgement came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.\" The scriptures confirm then that all men ar e saved except those whom the Bible excludes from union with Christ. Human nature was not the object of the atonement for the nature was not the object of sin, simply because human nature is an abstraction, it is pe ople who sin. The fall of Adam involved distinct persons \"many were made sinne rs\" Rm 5:19. Therefore all are of the elect except those plainly excepted by the Word of Go d. Christ told a certain group of people they were the seed of Satan. Who is exempt from entering the Kingdom? Peopl e who individually refuse to walk in obedience to God. \"for whatever a man so ws, that he will also reap.\" Gal 6:7 \"And the dead were judged by what was writte n in the books, by what they had done.\" Rev 20:12,13 The individual misdeeds are: 1. Not knowing Christ personally (Mt 7:23) 2. Not treating the least with love (Mt 25:42, 45) 3. Not obeying Christ (John 3:36) 4. Doing evil (Jn 5:29b) 5. Exchanging the truth of God for a lie (Rm 1:24,25) 6. Dishonorable passions and refusing to acknowledge God (rom 1:26a, 28) 7. Passing judgement on others, while doing the same (Rom 2:1,2) 8. Having an impenitent heart 9. those who are immoral, idolaters, adulterers, sexual perverts, thieve s, greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers (I Cor 6:9b, 10) 10. those who are fornicators or covetous (Eph 5:5,6)"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"11. not believing truth but having pleasure in unrighteousness (2 Thes 2:12) 12. those who are sorcerers, witches, fornicators, murderers, idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehoods. (Rev 22:15) Because children have not rejected God they are in Christ and are not helped by infant baptism. Billy Graham is on record advocati ng and supporting infant baptism as a help to salvation. The messages preached by 33° Mason Billy Grah am are unscriptural. A ll men have salvation until they reject it by doing the wicked deeds just listed. The Lord God reigns. Billy Graham wants people to believe that by making a decision for Christ you are saved. Your decision for Christ takes you no further than you originally we re in the beginning of your life. Salvation was given all men, \"behold the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.\" In other words you haven't gained anything. Acknow ledging that God exists is quite irrelevant. The demons even believe that Jesus is who he is, and that God exists. What you need to do is reject sin and follow truth. Graham states you are to make God Lord . But Whoa horse! We don' t make God Lord, we acknowledge it only. Some children who grow up in Godly homes (or even ungodly hom es) and never reject Christ can honestly say they have always been Christians. You can not blame Adam or your mother if you do not reach heaven. It is your own personal choice to reject God and to sin which is the problem. WE HAVE NO SCRIPTURAL MANDATE TO GIVE FALSE HOPES TO PEOPLE WHO DISOBEY THE WILL OF GOD. True be lievers are said to be the descendents of Abraham (Gal 3:7, 29) and Revelations describes this as \"a great multitude which no man could number\" Rev 7:9. If you have rejected God and jo ined World's order, then scripturally you are in Satan's domain. The television networks run by the Jews are in Satan's domain. The political governments of this world are part of Satan's do main. But their realms' pow er can be taken away by God when he desires, so we can still acknowledge that God is Lo rd of all. Every so often God reaches in and draws out someone from the depths of Satan's realms, and shows that He has ultimate power. THE LOST SOCIAL TEACHI NG OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD The real concept of the Kingdom's social message is al most lost today. (And I am not referring to setting up half-way houses, or orphanages, etc. which are fine but neither Paul nor Jesus made this their message.) The Kingdom of God is both h eavenly and earthly. The so cial aspect is what has been termed Gemeinde (community), ecclesia (church), and koinonia (fellowship)--that is a closely knit fellowship of disciples. The Kingdo m of God is not an aggregation of saved individuals, but rather a family, foreshadowed by the family tribes of Israel. God frequently treated groups of people as a unit-much as the la w today looks at a corpor ation as a person. God would address, condemn, and punish groups of people-tribes, cities, and nations. A group of people have a Zeitgeist that ma kes them a unit. Likewise with in the scriptural church the emphasis is not on personal salv ation, but of an ecclesia. Such a dynamic community can not exist in t oday's churches because first they do not recognize this teaching-basically the Protestant and Catholic traditions never had it (it is an Anabaptist view). Second, it creates tension with the world compared to individuals doing their own little thing (Pietism) and churches are trying to get along with the world. And third, the"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"Christians that go to a church building are usua lly so geographically isolated and spread apart they couldn't try practicing it. I have attended numer ous Protestant churches where the people called each other brothers, but made no attemp ts were made to live close by even though opportunities presented themselves. The concept of being accountable to one another is also not there. The cross in today's churches is experienced emotionally rather than existentially, such as is experienced by a dynamic community of disciple s would. Proper Christianity is a movement of people touched by the spirit, but it can be even more than that. I believe that Christian communitie s would be barriers to the powe r of Satan—and if Satan then also the New World Order. Prophets of God have given his people the revelation that there will be a pooling and clustering of devout Christians throughout this nation when the New World Order takes over. Further, a proper understanding of how the ki ngdom is here now, is a safeguard against adventism, millenialism, chilism, or whatever you want to call having an overemphasis on the future while spiritual values, discip leship and community are neglected. LOST AWARENESS OF PR INCIPALITIES & POWERS Christians have lost this awar eness in several ways. First, th ey don't recognize the power that comes from a unity of evil. Sec ond, they have swallowed the lin e that there ar e safe occult practices. To dabble in the spir it realm, which is what makes these new age techniques work- such as visualization, one's inner mentor, etc. is not to deal with an area of human potential but it is the manipulation of human potential by the \"p rincipalities and powers.\" To align oneself with these powers is to openly oppose God. Christians are swallowing the g nostic idea that with proper enlightment the occult powers can be properly handled to benefit society. The New Age Journal (M ar., 1978 special issue) had an article representing this thinking entitled \"Perils of the Path.\" The Christian has been told to try the spirits. Th at means to test the Sp irits and evaluate that which is evil and good. Note how the New Agers do not test the spirits, but believe whatever the messages their channeling ha s dredged up. The demons are inveterate liars. A fourth century Christian was approached by a demon disguised as Gabriel the Archangel. The Christian was sensitive to the spirit, because his spiritual life was in orde r. He told this angel that the angel must be wrong because he wasn 't good enough to receive a revelation, that the angel should depart and give hi s message somewhere else. At th at the demon departed. Are we willing to admit that our lives must be morally prepared, before we ac cept messages from the spirit world. If we are holy, how will we have the proper discernment? Joseph Smith accepted messages when the historical records do not show that he was morally prepared. SEPARATION Man has a sin nature, and the wo rld prefers to surround him with all the items that intensify his weaknesses. Even now some Christian books are telling us that we are stronger Christian if we will be around such a worldly climate without succombing to it, than if we try to avoid being around it. Such is nonsense. There is a relentless war being waged to make us fit into th e New Order's mold. Considering the powerful forces against the true Christian, it is a shame that our so-called leaders are not preparing us for this war, but are pretending th at these things are exag gerations. Indeed, some Christian leaders are suggesting that we should be more like the world, so that non-Christians will like us better."},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"We can not wish Satan's age-old plan for world domination away. \"What does it profit, my brethren, if some one says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, \"Depart in peace, be wa rmed and filled,\" but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.\" Certainly, we must pray. But if we are only wil ling to pray, we are no different that those who pray for their hungry bret hren. Our faith must translate into action against the New World-wide Slave State. Misplaced trust in the wr ong people has allowed th ings to happen that are contrary to our faith and freedom. We must be more voc al in getting the truth disclose d to us, and more vocal about the truth we know. Men who are evil are leading Ch ristendom and are para ded as great men of faith. Christ was very direct with that t ype of religious leaders. He called them hypocrites, a brood of vipers, and said \"Woe unto you.\" We cannot bl end the true faith with impurities . Scripture teac hes that what is holy does not make the unholy holy by touchi ng it. Rather the opposite happens. Holy means set aside. Does not even a little poison contam inates pure water and ruins its fitness, even though the poison may be diluted to some degree? FINANCIAL FREEDOM These times are getting increasingly difficult fina ncially. If possible get debt-free, and stay away from the worldly way of financing things. Christians need to develop their own economic systems. Investments in land, apartments, and houses are fine. But keep in mind that our security is in Christ Jesus. The primary mission is to serv e the world as a beacon light of Christ This can be achieved by being holy and unde filed, by visiting the sick, and caring for those in need. We also serve as a priest before God's presence for them. New cl othes, nice cars, flamboyance, ostention, and the pride of life are not high on God's priority. BE NOT UNEQUALLY YO KED WITH UNBELIEVERS Scriptures admonishi ng us not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers is written in the context of Christians being called to holiness, rath er than the subject of who one should marry. There are scriptural principles that teach us not to be depe ndant upon the ungodly, but to be self-sufficient within the limits of faith. If we decide to preserve our holiness and our self-sufficiency then we must create our own communities or close-knit groups. This advice is c ontrary to what Christians are being advised to do by their big name popular lead ers today- yet it is what the script ures actually steer us into. This is why the early church held all things in common. They did this not because communism is the only way, but that in their situation it wa s how they expressed their community. Other NT churches had close-knit groups w ithout having all things in common. If Christians want to increase th eir resistence to the Power, th en creating Christian communities is one of the strongest ways. Divide and conquer is an old tactic. The Christians have been deceived by their leaders that to be isolated in the world is a virtue. Th ese poor shepherds scatter their sheep by distorting the meaning of the scripture, \"We ar e in the world.\" They falsely imply that Christians in Christian communities aren't in the world."},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"It is difficult for Christians to build each ot her up if they only see eac h other during a sermon on Sunday morning. When Paul speaks about \"renew ing of your mind\" (Rom 12) he is speaking in a corporate sense, that is a body of believers is being called to develop the mind of Christ in a corporate sense. I Cor 12:14-26 actually teaches that Christians can not function effectively by theirselves, but receive their meaning in life through a corporate structure. \"Accept him whose faith is we ak, without passing judgment on disputable matters\" (Rm 14:1) \"Brothers, if a man is trapped in some sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself; you also may be temp ted\" (Gal 6:1) These two scriptures show that the emphasis was not to be on doctrinal matur ity but morality. So often in toda y's churches people are branded heretics for doctrinal differences , while immorality is ignored. Ag ain the whole concept of the church as a holy body has been lost, and replaced with an organization that is an incorporated business. The people in control of the business f eel their power challenge d if someone disagrees with them. The organism has been replaced with an organization. For instance, this Author knows JWs who committed somewhat gross sins but their sins didn't challenge the power structure of the JW power pyramid. On the other hand, so me JWs were booted out for the most minor doctrinal deviances. FALSE \"CHRISTIAN\" GOALS VS. GODLY HOPE Modern preachers today are telling us to plan t money seeds, set goa ls, get motivation, visualize, to speak in tongues, to be powerful and a whole list of things we are to do. However, God's message is the same as it has always be en, \"Seek ye first the righteousness of God and all these things shall be added unto you.\" However, most of today's \"Christians\" including their well-paid famous ministers have no idea of what it means to seek the righteousness of God. To live the righteousness of God means to be unwor ldly. The world is generally doing the exact opposite of what is God's will, consequently th e Christian who lives the correct life must stick out as different. However, our so-called Christia n leaders are trying to get Christians to blend with their unrighteous environment rather than to be holy. \"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy a nd peace in believing, th at ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.\" Rm 15:13 \"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?\" Rm 8:24 Hope is a virtue. It is something that only G od really gives. The breas tplate to protect the Christian is righteousness. Part of that ri ghteousness is to have the virtue of hope. Hope is a vital feature of our victory over the New World Order. Hope is a teaching that the Christian churches are almost forgetting. How many times have you heard someone preach that we are saved by HOPE ? We have made great efforts, and wasted great sums in tryi ng to evangelize. Much of our efforts were misguided, but the Lord loves us anyway. He sees that like little children we are trying to help in our own little way. Howe ver, God will save the world and Lord Willing evangelize it in a way that will display His power and glory, and will leave things totally clear in the minds of everyone that He himself was the one who wrought it. Rather than getting caught up in our own efforts to evangelize the world, and to fight the New World Order, let us work out our salvation with fear and trembling towa rd our Creator. Let us have a radiant hope that He will choose a method at some point to display His glory. His method to accomplish it will be miraculous and will humble all our feeble efforts.

Love your Lord and keep that attitude of hope that is a sure expectation. Be prepared that the real victory will be brought about by God alone, He simply wants us to experience the spiritu al fruits of walking in faith and trust.

You will be increasingly called upon to serve Satan's New World Order. Y ou may not now be aware that Satanists are running it at the top and that every 28 years they have personally received instructions from Satan on how the New Worl d Order is to constructed. However, it will become increasingly clear that ma nkind is being led to destruction and slavery, and it will become increasingl y clear who and what kind of power controls the New World Order. It will be increasingly harder for men to free themselves of the New World Order's pow er. Now is the time to choose freedom. The sooner the better. In order for us to understand what the choices are before us, we must have some historical perspective on today's situ ation. This paper will also reveal in a powerful way, the details of what both c hoices mean for the world. Perhaps, one of the easiest ways to understand histor ically what has happened is to show history as a giant game of move and countermove. There is a cosmic chess game going on be tween the Master and his experienced adversary with its attending moves and countermoves. This chart/paper has been constructed to give the Master's disciples an understanding of the Master's moves so that you can maintain your expectation, your hope of His victory. Hope in the Mast er's final victory is important, least we lose hope, then lose courage, an d turn our backs on our adversary. The Master's disciples will also see what the adversary's game plan is, so they can anticipate what the adversary and th e Master will be doing. The adversary's moves will seem utterly de structive and devastating to the Master's plans, actually they are simply a rehash of ite ms that the adversary has tried before. Reviewing history is of value in realiz ing how the adversary has tried these moves before. The adversary so hates the Master that he wants everything that the Master has done to be ruined and destroyed, and replaced by the glory of his own reputation and power. He will overexte nd himself and allow the Master to checkmate him, because he has self-delude d himself into overconfidence, and is too fixed on destroying the Master's re putation, not to me ntion he does not begin to compare with the Master's brilliance nor power. The adversary's reputation is a sham, a mask. He is real ly a paper dragon against the Master's brilliance. A short review of the moves to date. (THE FOLLOWING MOVE'S ARE NUMBE RED ONLY FOR ID ENTIFICATION -AND ARE NOT MEANT TO IMPLY OT HER MOVES DID NOT OCCUR.) THE MASTER'S MOVE #1. G od creates man to have dominion over the earth, and to have fellowship with hi m. He creates within man the special capability for genuine free-will love. THE ADVERSARY'S COUNTER MOVE #1. Satan promises man godhood through knowledge. This knowledge is promised if man will stop limiting himself by obeying the Master's \"narrow-minded\" rules."},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"THE MASTER'S MOVE #2. God allows man to rebel. After all his original purpose was to create a free-will agent who would fr eely love Him. God must maintain his holiness from sin and imperfection, and so he separa tes himself from fellowshipping with sinful man. He provides mankind an alternative, an alternative that he has with foresight prepared for the situation from the beginning. This alternative is univers al redemption through Christ, and the redemption may be appropriate d ahead of time. God allows Satan to set himself up as ruler of the world. Through Satan' s evil efforts, a pure group of men and women who are perfect and love their creator will be identified. THE ADVERSARY'S COUNTERMOVE #2. Th e Adversary must prevent mankind from appropriating the promised redemp tion. The Adversary and his demons have intercourse with the female of mankind and create Nephalim. (Nephalim can still be found today. They are the Gu ardians of the Satanic covens, which ex- Satanists speak about so dreadfully with fear.) Mankind is completely terrified into submission to demonic world rule, and is unable to defend themselves from Satanic slavery. THE MASTER'S MOVE #3. God destroys th e world. He saves righteous Noah and deals with the Nephalim and the demons . Righteousness is given another chance to take root within mankind, and the bloodline continues to produce the hoped for Savior of mankind. THE ADVERSARY'S COUNTE RMOVE #3. Satan again entices mankind with himself and what mankind can achieve. Because Satan is not an attractive alternative when men have all the facts between the two choices of either the Master's rule or the Adversary's rule, the choices must be camoflouged. Man is told that nothing is beyond his capability, he must only unite, create a giant U.N. building, and centralize all power world wide into a single world-wide government. But man must exclude God in his attempts to elevate himself. THE MASTER'S MOVE #4. God turns thei r U.N. building, what is known as the Tower of Babel, into a monument to man' s folly for trying to elevate mankind in disobedience to his Creator. The langua ges are confounded to prevent man from unifying. The nations, states, and tribes are created by God to form a barrier to prevent evil from unlimited growth, there by limiting Satan's ability to rule the earth. THE ADVERSARY'S COUNTERMOVE #4. Satan repeatedly lashes out to destroy the bloodline that will bring Salvation. Not only does he try to prevent this Salvation by enslaving and eliminating the bloodline, he also begins creating his own false bloodline through the tribe of Da n. This bloodline will be used in the last days, to raise a false Messiah. THE MASTER'S MOVE #5. Salvation comes to man. The lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world and who brings redemption for all mankind, carries out his mission. THE ADVERSARY'S COUNTERM OVE #6.

Every thought in heaven and earth are to come into obedience to Jesus Christ. A short discussion of Satan's primary goal. In order to bring all authority under his power, Satan must destroy all authority which might conceivably be used by God. This means that respect for all othe r authorities is being attacked, whether this authority is the authority of churches, teachers, parents, or national governments. Respect for scientific truth is being replaced with an occult-based science dependent on intuition and demonic control. Satanism's control has been greatly helped by the communications advancements in recent years, some of these inventions can historically be shown to have been handed to mankind by demons. What might be called \"Operatio n Black Widow\" is under way. It is a final big push by satanists to gain access to all secrets and to kill and replace people of power worldwide with Satanism's own people. Satanic plans to destroy the world's economies, to create wars and all kinds of crises and calamities are designed to create the desire and love of mankind for a another Hitler-like dictator over the world who will resolve these Satanic created crises for mankind. A short discussion of God's primary goal. There are nominal \"Christians\" who have mislabelled themselves for they are not part of God's kingdom. These are often agents of the Adversary. God is we ll aware of these subversives, but He has indicated that he will permit them until the harvest. 1 The harvest period is beginning. 2 In order to have a complete harvest, the good news of the Kingdom will be preached to all the nations. 3 The period before the final harvest is extended to give the body of Christ's true believers time to increase. 4 The body of Christ has been an important goal of God since the beginning. 5 The Kingdom of God is built only on the foundation of Christ. 6 In order to insure that this foundation is built properly, a shaking will take place 7 and a burning baptism of fire. 8 The arrogant and doers of evil will be burned up. 9 As the light of truth shines brighter Christians must also be content to see the shadows of darkness increase in intensity. The twilight of toda y where the issues seem clouded with a great deal of grey will be separated into severe darkness and severe brightness. The harvest is not simply a harvest of good , but of the thousands of years of evil too. A lot of evil has been planted by the Adversary that will come to fruition. God has promised man that whatever he sows, that shall he also reap. 10 God is not going to contradict that, and intervene to save man from the evil that is coming to full bloom. God describes th is as \"The ungodly and untaught will distort...to their own destruction.\" 11 In other words, God knows that- give evil"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"enough rope and it will hang itself. God has given al l mankind salvation, but many are rejecting it through unbelief a nd their sins unto spiritual death. Mankind is rejecting God— not the other way around. COMPARING THE TWO STATEGIES God's plan and Satan's plan are two tota lly different plans. However, lest the Master's disciples not realize this, the Ma ster's plan not only takes into account Satan's plan but intends to use it for His own good purpose. Satan will perform the following functions for God: •Satanic forces will be used as a r od of correction on the Christian people. Judgement must begin at the household of God, 12 but because the Master disciplines His own first, they will not be condemned along with the world. 13 •The pressures of the Adversary will ma ture Christians and they will become battle-hardened spiritual warriors. The disc ipline of spiritual warfare will develop character and obedience within the body of Christ. This refining process will be similar to the refining of the Uranium 2 35 isotope. A refined spiritual material will be produced which will have the powe r of a nuclear expl osion. These battle- hardened Christians will live for their Mast er and his victory rather than for their selves. •The Satanic forces will show people what Satanism is rea lly all about. People today are dabbling with occult powers within the Christian churches, little realizing what the horrible side of th at occult power is like that they are unwittingly tapping into. When Satanism exposes itself publicly, it w ill be rejected and f eared and fail like communism (which has secretly been a form of Satanism). The bankruptcy of the large array of gnostic religions that Sa tanism hides behind will be seen. The ancient superstitions that the \"New Age\" movement is based on will fail like they have repeatedly failed in the past. • Satan is providing the prophetic sign that God said would indicate the end times. 14 •Satan will provide for the destruction of pseudo-Christian ity. Satanists will totally humiliate the \"Christian\" church es. Hireling pastors will flee or turn against the Christians. Churches will be disbanded, or subverted into initiation centers for Lucifer. Those ministers w ho speak from themselves for their own glory 15 will join the New World Order and leave the Christian people to better leadership. The Holy Spirit will again have the leadership of the Christian people rather than all the pseudo-leaders who have gained their positions from popularity, from self-promotion, political manipulation, and other evil means.

Many of the world's political systems are also under the direct rule of Satanists. Those few that aren't are being targeted. Because the New World Order has studied mankind so indept h, it can operate sucessfully by playing upon the lusts, fear s and desires of men. Repeatedly, they manipulate things so that the world begs them for what the Satanists already want to do. This has repeatedly happene d and will continue. The world is already calling for a global government. After a third world war and/or an \"alien\" invasion, they will be begging to be enslaved by a One-World-Government. Bach of the various groups, the capitalis ts, the oil Shieks, and the third world are being told of the wonderful benefits they will receive from the New World Order. They are being told whatever is needed to get them to jump on the bandwagon of the New World Order. Computers and satellites have been bu ilt to give the New World Order the capability to monitor and control all activitie s on earth. In order to facilitate this total control a cashless society is in th e process of being established. Nuclear plants and nuclear weapons are coming unde r the control of Satanists. Lists of all Christians and potential troublemakers to the New World Order already exist, just waiting to be used when the orders are to be given to arrest such people. Truth serums for use on their oppone nts, secretly programmed masses of people, poisoned candy, regional world m oneys and many other items are waiting ready to be used as the Satanic seven years of tribulation unfold from 1992 to 1999. The tactics and strategy fo r Satan's big world power play are spelled out in numerous books and papers. As the A dversary's plans call for numerous organizations coordinating their efforts in what is called a SPIN (segmented polycentric integrated network) of SPIN s, the exact details of who will do what, and the deceptive and power tactics that will be used are too numerous to provide in this paper. For instance, how many groups have participated in the destruction of traditional family life a nd marriage? Divorce has been promoted. Serial monogramy, adultery, and polyg amy have been promoted. Women's \"liberation\" (actually their enslavemen t) has been promoted. Pornography has injured the moral fiber of the traditiona l marriage, and is now everywhere. The destruction of the family -a specific goal of the Satanists, has been promoted by so many organizations and peopl e through a variety of means. Part of the Satanists plan is to pr omote homosexuality, for their world ruler will be a man of unnatural affection. It might be said that Satan's plan is to deceive, manipulate, and coerce mankind into their enslavement and destru ction. Socialism is paraded as the"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"common man's panacea. The fallacious nature of that should have been revealed from Commun ism. People are slow to learn, es pecially because they have not realized that Satan controls the mass me dia. Satanists directly own the major networks, and the Mass me dia has a strong unwritten censorship that newsmen must abide by if they want to keep their jobs. God doesn't need the mass media to rev eal his plan and his glory. God has purposely planned to use the most humble means to win His victory, so that it will be blatantly His victory. Therefor e, the most humble houses will be His temples. The most humble people will be His people. The most humble of publishing houses will be His instruments. God will prove that He can win a victory by His power without any help. This is God's plan. Do not be discouraged if God seems to have little on His side. He has planned it th at way. Jesus was born in a cave. The Isrealites, were chosen to be God's people, while they were an insignificant nationality of slaves of glorious Egypt. God's general Gideon had only 300 men to fight with. God has chosen the weak, to confound mankind's wisdom. IT IS YOUR CHOICE. NOW YOU KNOW TH E PLANS - YOU CAN CHOOSE WISELY. WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THIS PAPER OR NOT YOU WILL CHOOSE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. Notes 1. Parable of the Wheat and Tares 2. Mt 13:39 et. al. 3. Mt 24:14, Heb 9:26 4. Mt 25:16,17 5.

Most of the Freemasons within the U.S. President/Cabinet member list have been identified, but there are stil l many Masons within the religious groups listed that remain to be found. Most of Lucis Trust members and Counc il of Foreign Relations members have also been identified. There are local chapters of th e CFR besides the national group, and this has added much confusion as to who is or isn't in CFR. For instance, JFK was a member of a local group, but is never listed in the national level CF R membership lists. So the bottom line is that if some tie-in is given, you can know it is accurate, but if nothi ng is indicated after a person's name, it may simply be that more research woul d disclose how that person is connected to the establishment that is now known as the New World Order.

The national symbol of Scotland is the dragon (the sn ake), and for years the chief of Scotland was called the dragon. The Gaelic la nguage is an im portant language for Sa tanism, although English and French are also use extensively by the Illu minati. The planning sess ions for world takeover that some ex-Satanists experienced were held in french. The British R oyal Family have long been involved with the occult. For more informat ion on this there is a de tailed examination of the Royal family and the occult in the book The Prince and the Paranormal -the Psychic Bloodline of the Royal Family by John Dale (1987). 2 They have also been actively involved with Freemasonry. (See the chart.) British MI6 has been a major vehicle for the Sa tanic hierarchy working behind the secret veil of Freemasonry to control world events. 3 British MI6 is the most s ecret intelligen ce organization in the world. 4 (It is properly know n as British Secret Se rvice not to be conf used with the U.S. agency by that name but performi ng a different function entirely.) The British Royalty have serv ed as important figureheads to British Freemasonry lending credibility and respectibility. Br itish Freemasonry has managed to k eep itself free of much of the criticism that the other national masonic groups have brought on themselv es. However, much of the credibility of British Freemasonry is undese rved. True, British Freemasonry is what it portrays itself to the public for the lower levels . But, the lower level Masons by their dues and activities are unwittingly supporting an organizati on that is led by Satanists at the top. An example of the subterfuge constantly exercised on the public by Freemas onry is a book purportedly written by a non-Mas on entitled The Unlocked Secr et Freemasonry Examined. The book portrays itself as an unbias ed and complete expose of Freemasonry. Th e book states unequivicably that the Masonic order called Societas Rosicrucian in Anglia [sic] is only open to Christians and is a \"Christian Order.\" However, Edith Star Miller reprints copies of a number of letters from the chief of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia which show that the English Grand Masonic Lodge, the SRIA, the OTO, and the German Illumina ti are all working together. 5 She briefly explains how she obtained the letters.
