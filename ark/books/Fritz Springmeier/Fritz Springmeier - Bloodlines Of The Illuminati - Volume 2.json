Today, there are around 190 members of this family with theRockefeller name and of course some others by other last names. This article isto explore further for those who investigate the Illuminati, how the Rockefellerbloodline is involved in the promotion of the occult and Satanism, and how theyare involved in the control of the Christian denominations. This article keys inon just one family, the Rockefellers. To understand the full extent of theIlluminati’s control of religion, including Christendom, would require perhapsseveral books. The Illuminati itself draws its lifeblood from around 500 verypowerful families worldwide. This article will not attempt to explain theirnetworks and the many organizations of the Illuminati. It will not even try todo this for the Rockefellers. In fact, no one knows how many trusts andfoundations the Rockefellers have. They have hidden trusts within secret trustswithin secret trusts. It is estimated that they have between 200 and severalthousand trusts and foundations. The finances of the Rockefellers are so wellcovered that Nelson Rockefeller did not pay one cent in income taxes in 1970,yet he was perhaps the richest man in the U.S. The Rockefellers exert enormousinfluence over religion in this nation in the following ways: 1. They provide a large share of the money that Seminaries in the United States need to operate. 2. They provide a large share of the money that universities need to operate. Education influences the religious values of our people. 3. They provide large grants to various religious organizations. 4. Their influence and control helps determine who will get publicity in the major news magazines, and on television. 5. Their influence has contributed to various anti-Christian organizations being set up. 6. They directly help control certain religious groups such as Lucis Trust.The Rockefeller’s Influence Is Both Subtle and Not So SubtleIn the book The Unholy Alliance details are given on how the seminaries, churchboards and Christian colleges have been captured. Much of the money for thiscame from the Rockefellers. One of the principle large Foundations that wasinstrumental in controlling religious institutions of various kinds was theSealantic Fund. (They have now shifted to other channels.) This Foundation whichwas incorporated in 1938 and was headquartered in New York City (50 West 50thSt.) gave enormous sums of money to manipulate Protestant concerns. In 1964,according to the Russell Sage Foundation’s book The Foundation Directoy theSealantic Fund gave away $681, 886 in grants.[2] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn2]In 1969, the Fund gave $1,889,550 in grants.[3] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn3]By 1984, the Sealantic Fund was not being used. But a look at anotherRockefeller non-profit, untaxed Foundation the Rockefeller Brother’s Fund showsa revealing grant pattern. Many people would not be able make any sense out ofwhat seems a random pattern of grants without the broad picture of what theIlluminati is doing today. My book Be Wise As Serpents should have clarified howthose various groups who receive grants are related and helpful to theRockefeller agenda. Although these other Rockefeller Foundations are notspecifically geared toward religion such as the Sealantic Fund was, it is clearthese other Foundations still impact religion.4 Selected Grants in 1984 of the Rockefeller Bro. Fund[4][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn4]Council on Foundations- $41,000(This money was according to R.B. Fund info “Toward work of project which willcarry out recommendations from study that points out lack of knowledge aboutglobal interdependence and about relationship between international and domesticissues.

Of Notre Dame - $25,000 Catholic institutions have been large recipients of grants from foundationsconnected to the World Order. The Catholic Church, the Episcopalian Church, andthe Unitarian-Universalist Church are all playing big roles in the New WorldOrder for the Satanists. One ex-Satanist has talked about visits that were madewith the Pope and Vatican leaders, where the Pope dealt with this person as amember of the Illuminati. In other words the Pope was not in the Illuminatihierarchy, but he carries out transactions with them, and coordinates hisactions according to their instructions.We will now go into some depth on the six items above.1. They provide a large share of the money that Seminaries in the United Statesneed to operate.The Union Theological Seminary has operated from Rockefeller funds.[6][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn6] UTS hasn’t been the only Protestant Seminaryreceiving Rockefeller funds, but it may be the best example of a seminarycontrolled by the Rockefellers. The Sealantic Fund stated under its purpose andactivities, “Current interests are primarily Protestant theologicaleducation......[7] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn7]The President of the Sealantic Fund when it operated was David Rockefeller, andLaurance (not Lawrence) S. Rockefeller was Vice-President. Steven C. Rockefellerwas one of the trustees.2. They provide a large share of the money that universities need to operate.Education influences the religious values of our people.In 1952, Congressman Eugene E. Cox headed up a committee that for the first timetried to uncover the Rockefeller’s (and other’s) foundations’ activities. Forsome reason, Cox encountered stiff opposition everywhere against his committee’sinvestigation, and the Congressman for some reason got sick and died. One memberof the committee, Congressman Carroll Reese, and his Counsel Rene Wormserattempted to continue the investigation. Rockefeller’s henchmen and newspapersdid their best to destroy Congressman Reese. The Reese investigation was givenonly the barest minimum of time and little resources for their investigation.However, they were still able to uncover that beginning in the 1930s vast sumsof money were spent in Education by the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations.This money went to promote John Dewey, Marxism, a One-World-Government agenda,and Socialism. The foundations (principally the Rockefeller and Carnegie)stimulated two-thirds of the total endowment funding of all institutions ofhigher learning in America during the first third of this 20th century.[8][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn8]The NEA (National Education Association was largely financed by theRockefeller/Carnegie foundations. A 1934 NEA report advised, “A dyinglaissez-faire must be completely destroyed and all of us, including the‘owners’, must be subjected to a large degree of social control.” ReeceCommittee Counsel Rene Wormser wrote of the investigation, “...leads one to theconclusion that there was, indeed, something in the nature of an actualconspiracy among certain leading educators in the United States to bring aboutsocialism through the use of our school systems...” They discovered that theRockefeller foundation was the primary culprit behind the teaching of socialismin America’s schools and universities and also behind the NEA’s policies. ReneWormser, Counsel for the Reece Committee reported, “A very powerful complex offoundations and allied organizations has developed over the years to exercise ahigh degree of control over education. Part of this complex, and ultimatelyresponsible for it, are the Rockefeller and Carnegie groups of foundations.”This was the situation in the 1950s when the Reece Committee brieflyinvestigated. The Rockefeller-Carnegie groups have continued basically unopposedfor the next 40 years in controlling education. One of the educational bookproducers is Grolier, Inc. Avery Rockefeller, Jr. sits on Grolier, Inc. boardmeetings. Another interesting board member is Theodore Waller who is thedirector of Grolier, Inc. He was a member of the International Book Committee ofUNESCO. The Rockefellers maintain great influence in the United Nations.3.They provide large grants to various religious organizations.On Jan. 31, 1945, John D. Rockefeller addressed the Protestant Council of theCity of N.Y. and told them that the answer to the problems Christianity was thatChristianity needed to become “the Church of the Living God.” Many listeningthat day, may not have realized that he and other top Illuminati considerthemselves gods, and that the solution John D. was cryptically giving was forChristianity to serve him a living god. (Rockefeller, John D. The ChristianChurch- What of its Future? NY: Protestant Council, 1945, & 1917.)4. Their influence and control helps determine who will get publicity in themajor news magazines.The Rockefeller family has enormous controls over various magazines andnewspapers. Let us examine how the power of the press can be used in religion.One of the magazines that the Rockefellers have some control over is Timemagazine. Time’s board chairman, Andrew Heiskell was associated with DavidRockefeller. Another Illuminatus of the 6th level1 Henry J. Fisher, ran McCall’sMagazine from 1917 to 1956. The establishment’s media boosted Anton LaVey’sChurch of Satan into prominence. The Jan. 31, 1967 New York Daily News ran astory about Anton LaVey performing the first Satanic wedding ceremony inAmerica. The March 1970 issue of McCall’s ran a nice story about the Church ofSatan. Not only is LaVey’s Church of Satan a publicity stunt to make Satanismmore popular and to deflect criticism of real covert Satanism, the McCall issuemakes Anton LaVey’s church sound even better in the article than it is. (Forthose brainwashed folks who think that this free advertising for Anton LaVey wasjust for the sake of finding a good story for the Daily News and McCall, I canshow you dozens of better juicier stories that never have seen the light ofday--because they are contrary to what the Illuminati want people to hear. Iwon’t argue that a story on Satanism may be interesting, I am pointing out thatmany other interesting stories don’t get printed. Stories are selected by aneditor, they don’t just happen.) Finally on June 19, 1972 Time Magazine providedmore coverage for LaVey with an article “The Occult: A Substitute Faith.”Believe me, the sincere devout Christian groups haven’t ever received such nicefree publicity. I’m not referring to men like 33° Mason Billy Graham, who worksfor the New World Order and Knights Templar Mason Charles T. Russell, founder ofthe Watchtower Society who both received great press coverage. Another minorexample, and I am pointing out minor examples because they occur many timesduring the course of year, is Van Daniken’s UFO books. Lew Wasserman, head ofMCA, which owns G.P. Putnam’s Sons, is a member of the Rockefeller UniversityCouncil. G.P. Putnam’s Sons published Van Daniken’s anti-Christian UFO religioustheories. Cadence Industries own Marvel Comics. The men on the board of Cadencesit under David Rockefeller in places like the CFR. Is it any wonder MarvelComics promotes the occult and heros like “The Son of Satan?” Where does thebuck stop? You say that the Rockefellers don’t control subordinates. Bear inmind, that many of the Rockefellers call themselves Baptists. If they are reallyChristians don’t you think they could use their influence to stop such terriblethings? The point is that the rottenness starts at the top. The rest of thepyramid has a hard time turning out O.K. when the top of the pyramid isdedicated to Satan. Rockefeller and Hearst worked together in their newsmonopolies. It was Hearst who promoted both books on Satanism and Billy Graham.(If you learn what I know--the two are not contradictory.) Hearst made BillyGraham who he is today by financially backing him and publicizing him.Rockefeller was supportive of Billy Graham’s New York Crusade, and theManhattan-Chase Bank helped Billy Graham out.5. Their influence has contributed to various anti-Christian organizations beingset up.Maurice Strong is a good friend of the Rockefellers. He has been promotingMother Gaia worship. David Rockefeller works with Maurice Strong and his New Ageideas. Reverend Moon from Korea has been very much loved by the Rockefellers.Moon calls himself Christ and is setting up a religion promotinginternationalism. His religion is also a good testing ground forbrainwashing/recruiting techniques that are being perfected by the NWO. TheRockefellers have been helping Moon, who also has his primary mansion in NY.Also of interest is that the prominent political figures that have endorsed Moonare those with ties to the NWO, and include Ted Kennedy, Mason Mark C. Hatfield,Mason Jesse Helms, & Illuminatus William F. Buckley, Jr. (See pg. 32-33 of ThePuppet Master by J. Isamu Yamamoto.) A lesser known group is the SpiritualFrontiers Fellowship (SFF) in Independence, MO. Their address was Exec. Plaza,10715 Winner Rd, 64052. They were founded in 1956. Just like Reverend Moon theyclaim to be Christians, but teach and practice other things. They teach andpractice the occult. Two prominent men in SFF are Marcus Bach and GardnerMurphy. They both have interesting backgrounds. Marcus Bach shows the touch ofthe Rockefellers. Marcus Bach, born in 1906, is director of special projects forSFF. The Rockefeller Foundation granted him a fellowship in “research andcreative writing” from 1934-36. Gardner Murphy was the consultant in 1950 forUNESCO in New Delhi to the Hindus of the Indian Ministry of Education. From‘52-’68 he was director of research at the Menninger Foundation, Topeka, KS.(Yes, psychology is led mainly by occultists!) Menninger himself is a member ofseveral environmental groups for the elite, an honorary trustee of the AspenInstitute, a Freemason, member of ACLU, and a close associate of W. ClementStone. W. Clement Stone in turn is also a Mason, a member of the occult AmericanSociety for Psychical Research, and the financial backer of the MenningerFoundation. The Federal Council of Churches was financed to a large extent byRockefeller money. In my Be Wise As Serpents book I detail how the FCC wasdesigned to destroy Christianity, how they carefully plotted to make thecreation of the FCC look like a grass roots movement, when it was actually thecreation of the elite (Illuminati). I further detail how the men who ran it werehigh ranking Masons, Socialists, and One-Worlders. Also shown is how theycarefully manipulated the real gospel for their own devious ends.6. They directly help control certain religious groups such as Lucis Trust.David Rockefeller is part of Lucis Trust’s management. Lucis Trust puts out thebook Externalisation of the Hierarchy by Alice Bailey which spells out The Planfor the Satanists and New Agers on how the spiritual Hierarchy (actually thedemonic hierarchy) is to externalize their rule of the planet. The book givesquite a few of the details of the plan, and is used as a textbook for New Agersat the Arcane Schools in NY, London, and Europe on how the New Age/One WorldReligion/One-World-Government will be brought in. If anyone doubts theRockefeller’s commitment to Satan, read page 107 of Externalisationof theHierarchy. On page 107 Alice Bailey, President of the Theosophical Society andpart of Lucis (formerly Lucifer) Trust, tells us who will rule when the New Age(New World Order) takes over. On the Earthly level--Humanity so to speak, theRuler is given on page 107 as Lucifer. On the Spiritual level--called “Shamballa- the Holy City” the coming ruler is given as “the Lord of the World” which weChristians know as Satan. Lucis Trust knows it is Satan too, but for publicconsumption they say that the “ruler of the world” is Sanat (a scrambling ofSatan) Kumara. They also predict there will be a Christ Consciousness and theChrist (actually the Anti-Christ) The book Externalisation of the Hierarchyteaches repeatedly (see pages 511-512, 514) that the 3 vehicles to bring in theNew Age will be the Masonic Lodges, (obviously not everyone attends Lodges),next the Churches (this is clearly revealing to us that men like theRockefellers are using the churches for the Luciferian plan of Lucis Trust), andfinally Education (Well, of course education. Not everyone attends churches.They need a safety net to catch everyone in their brainwashing to make us allwant to be happy slaves under the Light-bearer.) The home life of theRockefellers is decidedly different than for most people. They have over 100homes to stay at. The Rockefellers own vast tracts of good land in variouscountries in South America, and have nice homes in Brazil, Ecuador, and theirMonte Sacro Ranch, Venezuela. They have two mansions in Washington, D.C. (atleast), numerous ranches around the United States, resorts in Hawaii, PuertoRico, and the Caribbean, a 32- room 5th Ave duplex in N.Y., not to mention theirplace at Seal Harbor, Maine, and the large estate at Pocantico Hills, NY. It isestimated that they have 2,500 house servants. Over the years, they have builtup the reputation of being miserly with their help, and to each other. (Icouldn’t begin to know all about the Rockefellers, but I can give a sampling ofsome of the many items that surround the real lives of America’s top Illuminatifamily.) Winthrop, who is homosexual,, enjoyed living in Arkansas with his blackmale friend. He reportedly had the world’s largest porn collection. WinifredRockefeller Emeny, Nelson’s cousin, murdered her two children and committedsuicide. Michael Rockefeller died when he tried to bribe New Guinea tribesmen with largesums of money to go head hunt and make shrunken heads for him. The natives hadgiven up head hunting and Michael couldn’t successfully bribe them. Finallygetting tired of Michael, the natives decided to head hunt Michael himself! Many of the Rockefeller family have had troubled lives, filled with all kinds offears and occult activities. It is known that the Rockefellers have frequentlybuilt many hidden tunnels and hidden rooms onto their buildings. They havedeveloped their occult and worldly powers to the point they consider themselvesgods. Their powerful often suffer violent ritual death as most high levelSatanists traditionally go through. One who died in Arizona is known to havebeen cremated.Partial BibliographyBooks: * Allen, Gary. The Rockefeller File. Boring, OR: CPA Book Publishers, 1991. (reprint of 1976 ed.) * * Bailey, Alice.

A ContinuationThe first article about the House of Rockefeller in this newsletter occurred inthe Mid-Dec 1992 Vol. No. 13 Issue pp. 3-8. The primary focus of that articlewas to show how the family controlled large segments of the Protestant groups inthe United States. A secondary focus of that article was to show the Satanicoccult side of the family. An attempt will be made in this article not to rehashinformation given out in that earlier article. The Rockefeller family has beenso busy and there Is a large amount of information that can be provided aboutthem. Therefore my goal with this article Li to provide introductory informationto the readership, and to qualify that what is written In this article Is butthe basics of what should be written about the illuminati activities’ of thisfamily. Much of my own material on the Rockefeller family was lost this year andI don’t have the time to go back and research it again. Much of it involved thesecret wheeling and dealing that went on behind the scenes to bring theRockefellers into wealth and power. Some of the details also involved theirmanipulations to control about everything that the Rockefellers can find tocontrol. Some of the research was on the occult activities of the House ofRockefeller.The First Notorious Rockefeller. The first notorious Rockefeller that researchers who are not working for theRockefellers refer to is William Avery Rockefeller (1810 -1906?). William AveryRockefeller was totally corrupt and lacked any type of morals. He was involvedin the occult and practiced magic. He married a number of women around thecountry in bigamous relationships. He also had a number of mistresses, and alarge number of sexual partners. He was charged with raping a woman and escapedthe state of New York to prevent being sent to Jail for it. He stole, lied, andabused his way through life. He wore the best of clothes, and he never lackedfor money, including gold coins. Besides loving women, he loved gambling. Andwhere did his money to gamble with come from? He made much of his moneydishonestly. His life is a carbon copy of other men who are known by this authorto have been in the Illuminati. (The reader also needs to bear in mind that theIlluminati carry out a large number of secret occult marriages, which onlyinsiders learn about.) One of his wives was Eliza Davidson (181349). She was anextremely cruel woman. Historians who have been bought off by the elite like topicture Eliza Davidson as a very pious woman. Although she had a religiousfront, there are a number of things in her life that show that she was not theparagon of virtue that the paid-for historians have made her out to be. When shemarried William Avery Rockefeller she moved in with him and his mistress.The First Notably Rich Rockefeller. William Avery Rockefeller had many bastard children, and it can be imagined manychildren born for ritual or for the cult. His wife Eliza had six children forhim and of those John Davison Rockefeller is the infamous one who brought thefamily into limelight. John D. Rockefeller in his lifetime became one of themost powerful men in the world. One of the most best kept secrets were hissecret dealings with the other Illuminati families. The Payseurs and otherIlluminati families are all intimately involved in the rise to power of theRockefellers. The other factors involved in John D. Rockefeller’s rise to powerIs his utter ruthlessness. He was willing to do anything for power. John o.Rockefeller established the family in their principal estate at Pocantico Hillsin New York. I have lost the exact figure, but over 100 Rockefeller familieslive at the private land of Pocantico Hills.A Brief Survey of the Rockefeller’s Influence The Rockefellers have divested much of their holdings into places which theycontrol, but nominally they are not owners of. The Rockefellers financial poweris far greater than the balance sheets would indicate. The Rockefellers can givedonations from an organization which they control to another that they control,and not lose any control over the money. The donations look Impressive, but theRockefeller bloodline hasn’t lost. Have you ever noticed that Rockefeller’sStandard Oil uses the satanic pentagram in a circle as their logo? Just three ofcountless Rockefeller companies are Texas Instruments and General Electric, andEastman Kodak. The Rockefellers also control Boeing. This author (FritzSpringmeier) has repeatedly been given information from numerous sources aboutthe occult activities that are being perpetrated at the Boeing plants in theSeattle area. Monarch programming has even taken place at a Boeing Plant. Allthese things fit together when one gets the bigger picture and the inside scoop.The Rockefellers also control Delta. Has anyone realized that the Delta symbolis a very widely used satanic symbol? Is It any wonder so many Illuminati andCIA, and world financiers, and people like Chuck Coison (see the exposes onChuck Colson in 93’s newsletters) use Delta to fly on. My notes are lost, hut suffice it to say the Rockefellers own land all overSouth America. The Rockefellers own land most anywhere anyone would want tovisit in the US. from Hawaii to Texas to Florida and Seal Harbor, Maine. Noticehow often Bush would go to Maine when he was President? The Rockefellers haveplayed a role in Lucis Trust and the United Nations. Interestingly, you willnotice that Prince Charles is the spokesperson for Lucis Trust and also workswith the United Nations in various ways. Prince Charles is from another satanicbloodline. Readers need to study my Be Wise As Serpents book to see how LucisTrust fits into things. The Rockefellers were involved in the creation of theFBI, so that the FBI has always been an arm of power for the Illuminati. That iswhy there are official FBI programs in action today to kidnap children andprovide them for sacrifice. Yes, American people, the wolf was set in charge ofguarding the chicken coop. The organization that is working as part of the FBIis the Finders. (The stink was so bad that US. News & World Report did a storyto soften the impact of the scandal. See the article on a following page.Ex-Satanists who worked with the FBI to receive the children the FBI kidnappedand sold to them for sacrifice have been trying to get the word out publiclyabout the FBI’s corruption. When the Illuminati was beginning to get exposed inthe Franklin Saving & Loan case in Lincoln, NE the FBI was part of the dirtyactors and was part of the cover up. The Rockefellers have had control over theFBI since they helped get it started. When Congress wanted to investigate theCIA for wrongdoing the appointed a Commission headed by Rockefeller toinvestigate the CIA’s wrongdoings! Yes, the Rockefeller Commission did a bigstudy and slapped the hands of the CIA for a few misdeeds. Their report is stillcited as the big investigation of the CIA. Some investigation! Since theRockefeller family work hand in hand with the CIA to create Monarch slaves, ofcourse that part of the CIA’s misdeeds got overlooked!A recent convert from Satanism, Michael McArthur, has given validated insideinformation about the FBI and the CIA programs which kidnap children in order tosupply Satanic rituals with sacrificial material. The names of the agents whospend their official government time kidnapping children for Satanism thatMichael knows about are as follows: * Chucky “Mike,” “Peters”-FBI hit man in Div, 5 of FBI * Nichol Harrah--FBI agent who abducts children for sacrifice * Unda Krieg--Satanist working for FBI * Ken Lanning--FBI agent who abducts children for sacrifice * Nick O’Hara--FBI hit man, Satanist, has covered FBI child kidnappings by murder * Kape Richardson--CIA agent who abducts children for sacrifice Rather, than risk election, a brilliant coup d’état which is exposed in Be WiseAs Serpents was carried out to put Nelson A. Rockefeller into theVice-Presidency.The Rockefellers control both education and religion in this country by theirfoundations. The Rockefellers have played key roles in the CFR. Rockefellerwrote the book the Future of Federalism which supports the union of nations intoa world government. For many years the Rockefellers have been pouring billionsof dollars into projects and international groups which are working to bring ina public One-World government. (The world already has a secretOne-World-Government.) The Rockefellers take part in decisions that affectRussia, China and other parts of Asia and with good reason, the House ofRockefeller has holdup and assets in these countries too. The investigator of the Rockefellers will find that they have secretly had theirhand in the politics of the United States during the 20th century. The decisionsand directions this nation has taken, are the result of countless orders whichthe Rockefellers have given to their underlings.Bibliography & SourcesBooks * Allen, Gary. Rockefeller.

The firstfarmer sold his horse to the second for a quarter million dollars, and thenbought it back for about $20 more.

And perhaps we should laugh at ourselves forhaving been fooled, for if there is one area in life that exceeds the religiousin deception, and touches all of us it is the financial. What else can we doabout it except laugh?

You’ll learn about some otherneighbor horse traders in this chapter too.Rothschild Talks About Their Dynasty Lord Rothschild in his book The Shadow of a Great Man quotes a letter sent fromDavidson on June 24, 1814 to Nathan Rothschild, “As long as a house is likeyours, and as long as you work together with your brothers, not a house in theworld will be able to compete with you, to cause you harm or to take advantageof you, for together you can undertake and perform more than any house in theworld.\"[9] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn9] The closeness of the Rothschildbrothers is seen in a letter from Saloman (Salmon) Rothschild to his brotherNathan on Feb. 28, 1815, \"We are like the mechanism of a watch: each part isessential.”[10] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn10] This closeness is further seenin that of the 18 marriages made by Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s grandchildren 16were contracted between first cousins.Visiting the Nation the Rothschilds BuiltIn 1974, in the summer after the Yom Kippur War this Author toured Israel, andgot the chance to personally visit many of the buildings like the Knesset thatthe Rothschild’s money has built. The Knesset is the Israeli equivalent to ourCongress’s Capitol building. One of the Rothschilds in his will left money forongoing building projects in Israel, and the Rothschilds are honored with aStreet named after them in Jerusalem.The people of Germany and Turkey have been very close. I can recall meetingTurkish “Gastarbeiter\" (“guest workers”) in Germany. The reader will rememberthat Turkey fought on Germany’s side in W.W.I. A few powerful Jews, includingthe Rothschilds were responsible for the wording of the Treaty imposed onGermany that ended W.W. I.[11] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn11] The treaty gavethe Rothschilds the German owned railway rights in Palestine (which had beenpart of the Turkish Ottoman Empire), thus paving the way for the Rothschilds tohave a sure leverage to dictate policy concerning Palestine. The Rothschilds hadmade loans to Turkey which amounted to almost one hundred million pounds. Whenthe Turkish government collapsed after W.W.I., because they were on the losingside, the Rothschilds had a claim on Palestine because of those unpaid Turkishloans.[12] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn12] The British government followed thedictates of the Rothschilds. The British were given a mandate over Palestine,and the Rothschilds were able to through their proxies in the Britishgovernment, to create the steps that led to the nation of Israel.[13][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn13]The Rothschilds as \"Prophets\"One item stands out as a person listens to the International Bankers and readstheir books. They believe money is what makes the world go round. If you havemoney, you can do anything. Money is \"God\", and it is worshipped and served.Even after these families accumulate more than can be spent, these devoteescontinue selling their souls for this false but powerful god. The greatpoet-philosopher Heinrich Heine (a Banker’s son) said, \"Money is the god of ourtime, and Rothschild is his prophet.\"[14] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn14]Following the cue of the Rothschilds, Heinrich Heme, a Jew, signed his name bydrawing a Seal of Solomon.[15] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn15] Amsel Rothschildis reported to have said, \"Give me control of the economics of a country; and Icare not who makes her laws.[16] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn16] Today hisdescendants meet twice daily in London to dictate to the world what the worldprice of gold will be. They also dictate what the \"Federal Reserve System\" willdo with America’s finances.Another God, TooAccording to eye-witnesses, who were prominent enough to visit one of theBritish Rothschild homes, the Rothschilds worship yet another god too, Satan.They set a place for him at their table.[17] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn17]The Rothschilds have been Satanists for many generations. The Rothschilds are animportant part of the history of the Seal of Solomon (also known as hexagram,Magen David, six-pointed star, Star of David.) The Seal of Solomon, thehexagram, was not considered a Jewish symbol before the Rothschilds began usingit.[18] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn18] Throughout the Middle Ages the Seal ofSolomon had been used by Arab Magicians, Cabalist Magicians, Druid witches andSatanists. One of the few ancient uses of the symbol was on the floor of a 1,200year old Moslem Mosque found where Tel Aviv is today.[19][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn19] In the twelve century an Ashkenazic Jew Menahemben Duji, who thought he was the Messiah, used the magical symbol.[20][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn20] Because the Rothschilds were Satanists theyadopted this powerful magic symbol in 1822 for their coat- of-arms. The namethey adopted for their family actually comes from the fact that in the 17thcentury Mayer Amschel Bauer began hanging out a red hexagram in front of theirhouse to identify it. Mayer Amschel then decided to take the name “Redschield”(Rothschild in German) after the red Seal of Solomon that they used. AliceBailey in A Treatise On White Magic, p. 412, claims that the Hierarchy has aspecial group which she calls \"the financial group\" controlling all that can beconverted into energy, and constituting a dictatorship over all modes ofintercourse, commerce and exchange.\" According the Luciferian Alice Bailey, the\"financial group\" is the latest group directed by the Hierarchy. In 1836 ZeviHirsch Kalischer approached Rothschild and proposed Rothschild buy all of ErezIsrael. It took many years for the Rothschilds to finally create Israel. TheRothschilds have been a primary force behind the creation of Israel, and so itis appropriate that the nation carries their magical Seal of Solomon as thestate logo. The Ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel will not serve in the Israeli armybecause they know that Almighty God was not behind the creation of modernIsrael, but rather the rich ungodly apostate Jews. They refuse to serve theungodly. They are more wise than men like Jerry Falwell who run aroundproclaiming Israel is God’s nation. Men like Falwell are the type that thisAuthor finds reference to repeatedly in Jewish documents that speak of theirpower within the Fundamentalists. God is ultimately in charge, he has allowedHitler to come to power, Stalin to come to power, and the Rothschilds to come topower. In the same sense that God rules over and blessed Stalin’s Russia, herules over America and Israel. To twist scriptures about God seating the rulersand then to apply them to bless one Satanic secular communist nation and notanother is inconsistent and not correctly using the Word of Truth. Some peopleobject that the conspiracy of Power is labelled Jewish rather than Satanic bycertain concerned citizens. This objection is valid-- however, will theseobjectors then take the obvious next step and admit the nation of Israel whichthe Rothschild’s created is Satanic and not Jewish? But then who knows preciselywhy people do what they do? If you ask someone why he does something, he willgive you one answer today, another tomorrow, and another the next day. Does hedo what he does for a real reason, or a single motive? Perhaps to label thePower as only Satanic or only Jewish or only Masonic is to neglect the personalhuman dimension. This personal human dimension is godless. Being godless itfills that void, by pretending its men are gods. This brings us right back tothe Gnostic religions and Satan. Most Jewish people do not concern themselveswith learning the occult significance to their treasured Magen David (Star ofDavid). King David did not have anything to do with the hexagram, although hisson Solomon did when he began worshipping Ashtoreth (star, also known asAstarte, Chiun, Kaiwan, Remphan, and Saturn).[21][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn21] Solomon built altars to Star (Astarte, akaAshtoreth). The god Saturn is associated with the Star but both Saturn andAstarte also been identified with a number of other names. Saturn is animportant key to understanding the long heritage this conspiracy has back toantiquity. The city of Rome was originally known as Saturnia or City of Saturn.The Roman Catholic Church retains much of the Saturn worship in its ritual.Saturn also relates to Lucifer.’[22] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn22] In variousoccult dictionaries Saturn is associated with evil. Saturn was important to thereligion of Mithra, and also the Druids.Co-Masters of The World -- Connections To Jews, Mormons, and JudaismIt has been said all roads lead to Rome. For this book, it could be said allpaths of investigation lead to the Rothschilds. Charles T. Russell, in an 1891letter to Baron (Lord) Rothschild, mailed from Palestine, outlined possiblecourses of action that could be taken to establish the Jews in Palestine.Russell’s letters praised the Rothschild’s money which established Jewishcolonies in Palestine. Russell writes Rothschild, “What is needed here,therefore, next to water and cleanliness, is a good government which willprotect the poor from the ravenous and the wealthy. Banking institutions onsound bases, and doing business honorably, are also greatly needed.\" Russellcontinues, \"May the God of Jacob direct you, my dear Sir, and all interestedwith you in the deliverance and prosperity of Israel, and blessed will they bewho, to any extent, yield themselves as his servants in fulfilling his will aspredicted.\"[23] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn23] When the Mormon Church neededfinancing in the late 19th century, they went to Kuhn, Loeb Co.[24][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn24] To explain the Rothschild’s control of Kuhn,Loeb Co. here is some background information. The method that the House ofRothschild used to gain influence, was the same that Royalty had used forcenturies, marriage. The Rothschild children, girls and boys, have had theirspouses chosen on the basis of alliances that would benefit the House ofRothschild, but since consolidating world power they generally have marriedcousins these last two centuries.[25] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn25] JacobSchiff grew up in the house that the Rothschild’s had at 148 Judengasse,Frankfurt. Jacob Schiff came to the United States with Rothschild capital andtook over control of a small Jewish banking concern founded by two Cincinnatidry goods merchants Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb. He even married Soloman’sdaughter. In 1885, Loeb retired, and Schiff ran the Kuhn, Loeb Co. for theRothschilds until 1920 when he died.[26] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn26] DuringRussell’s and Brigham Young’s day, Lord Rothschild was considered the \"layleader of world Jewry.\"[27] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn27] Edmund Rothschildwas President of the Jewish Colonization Assoc.[28][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn28] which was a major Zionist group. AmselmRothschild indicated that his grandfather Amschel Mayer Rothschild had insistedin Clause 15 of his will to his children, \"…may they and their descendantsremain constantly true to their ancestral Jewish faith.\"[29][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn29] However, the will has been secret and there isno way of knowing what it says. The Rothschilds have not remained true to theOrthodox faith. If this was actually what Clause 15 said then something isamiss. The Jewish world has showered the Rothschilds with praises, \"TheRothschilds govern a Christian world. Not a cabinet moves without their advice.They stretch their hand, with equal ease, from Petersburg to Vienna, from Viennato Paris, from Paris to London, from London to Washington. Baron Rothschild, thehead of the house, is the true king of Judah, the prince of the captivity; theMessiah so long looked for by this extraordinary people… The lion of the tribeof Judah, Baron Rothschild, possesses more real force than David--more wisdomthan Solomon.\"[30] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn30] The Prieure de Sion-theElders of Sion[31] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn31] also relates to theRothschilds who are reported to serve on a Jewish council of Elders of Sion.[32][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn32] The Rothschilds have \"helped\" the Jewish peoplethe Rothschild’s own way. For those who admire stinginess, the Rothschilds willbe greatly looked up to. For instance, the extent of James Rothschild’s charityin France to poor Jews was 5 francs (the equivalent of $1).[33][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn33] Their dynasty has destroyed honest Jews alongwith Christians. Today, few dare criticize the Rothschilds.Co-Masters of the World -- Connections to Secret SocietiesThe Rothschilds had played a major role in the Bavarian Illuminati,[34][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn34] and it is known that a least one of the sons ofAmsel was a member. As the reader remembers, Amsel placed his sons in the majorEuropean capitals, where they each set up the principal banking houses. By theirown secret intelligence service and their own news network they couldoutmaneuver any European government.[35] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn35] The large amounts of voluminous correspondence by Rothschild couriers attractedattention,[36] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn36] but no one ever stopped theirpersonal intelligence and mail services. After the Bavarian illuminati wereexposed, the central occult power over the European secret societies shifted toCarbonarism, a.k.a. the Alta Vendita,[37] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn37] ledby another powerful Rothschild, Karl Rothschild,[38][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn38] son of Amschel. In 1818, Karl participated in asecret document that was sent out to the head-quarters of Masonry from the AltaVendita. The Masons were quite distressed when a copy of this was lost, andoffered rewards to anyone who could return the lost copy. It was originallywritten in Italian. Its title translates to “Permanent Instructions” or“Practical Code of Rules; Guide for the Heads of the Highest Grades ofMasonry.\"[39] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn39] The Masonic reference book 10,000Famous Freemasons, Vol. 4, p.74, indicates two other sons of Amschel wereMasons, James Meyer Rothschild, and his brother Nathan Meyer Rothschild. JamesRothschild in Paris was a 33 degree Scottish Rite Mason, and his brother Nathanin London was a member of the Lodge of Emulation. And Jewish Freemason Katzindicates Solomon Meir Rothschild, a third member of the five brothers, wasinitiated into Freemasonry on June 14, 1809.[40][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn40] The Rothschilds became powerful withinFreemasonry. We find the Saint-Simonians, the occult religious millennialistforerunners of communism, praising Baron de Rothschild in their magazine LeGlobe, \"There is no one today who better represents the triumph of equality andwork in the nineteenth century than M. le Baron de Rothschild... Was this Jewborn a millionaire? No, he was born poor, and if only you knew what genius,patience, and hard work were required to construct that European edifice calledthe House of Rothschild, you would admire rather than insult it.\" Lionel deRothschild (the de was added by the French Rothschilds) was involved with thefirst communist internationalist. The Mason Mazzini who helped start communismpraised Rothschild, \"Rothschild could be King of France if he so desired.\"[41][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn41] Adoiphe Cremieux, was a French Jewish Mason.The Rothschilds gave at least £1,000 to Cremieux to go to Damascus with SalomonMunk and Sir Moses Montefiore to win the release of Jews imprisoned there, andto convince the Turkish Sultan to declare the charges of ritual murderfalse.[42] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn42] According to the three Jewishauthors of Dope, Inc. the B’nai B’rith was a spin-off of the Order of Zion andwas organized as a “covert intelligence front\" for the House of Rothschild. Itis highly probable that the B’nai B’rith was used as a Rothschild intelligencecover. The Rothschilds are prominent in the Bilderbergers too. The Rothschildswere closely related to the Council of Foreign Relations (CFR). Although manypeople today would not view the CFR as a secret society it was originally set upas part of a secret society and it was kept secret for many years, in spite ofits awesome power. Carroll Quigley, professor of International Relations at theJesuit Georgetown University, exposed the Round Table Group with his bookTragedy and Hope.[43] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn43] The Rothschilds supportedRhodes to form De Beers.[44] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn44] Later, Rhodes madeseven wills which established a secret society modelled after the Jesuits andMasons to help bring in a One World Government centered upon Britain, and theRhodes Scholarships.[45] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn45] The inner group wasestablished in Mar. 1891 and consisted of Rhodes, Stead, Lord Esher (Brett), and33* Mason Alfred Milner.(33bb) A secondary circle of \"potential members of theCircle of Initiates\" consisted of the Jew Lord Balfour, Sir Harry Johnson, LordRothschild, Lord Grey and others. Initially, Lord Rothschild was part of theinner group of Rhode’s secret society, but was replaced by his son-in-law LordRosebury who wasn’t as conspicuous.[46] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn46] TheFabian Socialists dominated the staff at Oxford when the Rhodes Scholars beganarriving. These scholars then received indoctrination and preparation to becomepart of an international socialist New World Order.[47][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn47] The Round Table Group developed from the innerexecutive circle of Rhode’s secret society. The outer circle was establishedafter the start of the 20th century. The Round Table Group was extended afterW.W. I by organizing a front organization -- the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs. The Council of Foreign Relations was the American part ofthis front. The inner circle continues to direct the outer circle and its twofront organizations RIIA and CFR. The CER in turn set up a number of frontsincluding the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR).Co-Masters of the World -- Management of the Catholic and Czars’ Wealth and theCapture of the Orthodox Church's Wealth.Early in the 19th century the Pope came to the Rothschilds to borrow money. TheRothschilds were very friendly with the Pope, causing one journalist tosarcastically say \"Rothschild has kissed the hand of the Pope...Order has atlast been re-established.\"[48] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn48] The Rothschildsin fact over time were entrusted with the bulk of the Vatican’s wealth. TheJewish Ency., Vol. 2, p.497 states, “It is a somewhat curious sequel to theattempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the presenttime (1905) the latter are the guardians of the Papal treasure.\" ResearcherEustice Mullins writes that the Rothschilds took over all the financialoperations of the worldwide Catholic Church in 1823.[49][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn49] Today the large banking and financial businessof the Catholic Church is an extensive system interlocked with the Rothschildsand the rest of the International Banking system. The great wealth of theRussian Czars was entrusted to the Rothschilds, $35 million with theRothschild’s Bank of England, and $80 million in the Rothschild’s Paris bank.The Rothschilds financed the Russian Revolution which confiscated vast portionsof the Orthodox Church’s wealth. They have been able to prevent (due to theirpower) the legitimate heirs of the Czars fortune to withdraw a penny of themillions deposited in a variety of their banks. The Mountbattens, who arerelated to the Rothschilds, led the court battles to prevent the claimants fromwithdrawing any of the fortune. In other words, the money they invested in theRussian Revolution, was not only paid back directly by the Bolshevists inmillions of dollar of gold, but by grabbing the huge deposits of the Czars’wealth, the Rothschilds gained what is now worth over $50 billion.[50][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn50]Co-Masters of the World -- Control Over Satanism and WitchcraftChapter 2.11 gives the names of a Witchcraft Council of 13 which is underRothschild control and in turn issue orders to various groups. One of the purestform of Satanism can be traced to the Jewish Sabbatain sect and its Frankistspinoff. The leaders of this up to the Rothschilds were: * Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676) * Nathan of Gaza (16??-?) * Jacob Frank (1726-1791) * RothschildsThree Connections between Satanism, Evil, and Money.Money naturally attracts itself to evil. For instance, if a woman prostitutesherself she may receive a great sum of money, but who will pay her for keepingher virginity or her dignity? If you are a hit man a large amount of money isyours if you kill your target, who will pay you if you would miss your target?Second, evil men believe in where there is a will there is a way, and they arewilling to sell their souls for their God money. They will employ evil to gainmoney.While most people are quite aware of these last two connections, a third maylikely have escaped their attention. Thirdly, the principle group of men whocranked up International Banking were Satanists from the beginning. TheseSatanists now are the ones who run the Federal Reserve and are responsible forthe creation of U.S. Federal Reserve notes. Just having total control over thesupply of U.S. paper money almost gives them leverage over the world’s finances,without mentioning they control the World Bank. It is no accident then, thatonce they established world financial control, they would do all in their powerto divide and conquer and destroy both the Christian and the Moslem faith inGod. These powerful Bankers relate to faith in God as Cain related to hisbrother Abel. That they may be related to the Jewish people, does not mean theyhave the Jewish people’s best interest at heart. Initially Sabbetai Zevi wasrejected by many Jews. His sect gained momentum in second half of theseventeenth century in southeastern Poland.[51] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn51]In 1759-60, 500 Jewish Sabbateans “converted\" to Christianity.[52][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn52] In 1715, 109 of the 415 Jewish families inFrankfurt were engaged in moneylending. The rest were merchants of variouskinds. The concepts that Satanism holds to were a natural shoe in to justify formany of these Jewish bankers the type of behavior they were engaged in.\"[53][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn53]Long Story, ShortMany divisions and battles between religious elements in the world have beenencouraged and supported by the Power’s wealth. Unfortunately, many have beenfooled into thinking that being devout and faithful to God is the source ofreligious fighting. In some areas of the world, Moslems, Christians, and othershave gotten along fine for centuries. Religious tensions do spring to somedegree from within the religions themselves, but the fuel to keep those firesburning and to light up conflicts often come from the Power’s wealth. An obviousexample is the Iran-Iraq war.Co-Masters of the World -- Control Over W.W. I TreatyWhen Germany fell, not only did Rothschild agents draft the treaty, prepare theidea of the League of Nations, but Max Rothschild was one of 11 men who tookcontrol over Bavaria. Max Rothschild was a Freemason in Lodge No. 11, Munich,Germany.Co-Masters of the World -- Connections to Mi5, Rockefellers, J.P. Morgan, CFR,et. al.Victor Rothschild, who worked for J.P. Morgan & Co., and was an important partof MI5 (British Intelligence). Victor Rothschild was also a communist and memberof the Apostles Club at Cambridge.[54] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn54] LordRothschild was one of the original members of Rhode’s Round Table group whichdeveloped into the CFR. It was the Rothschilds who had financed Cecil Rhodes,beginning in Africa. The Rothschilds’ have several agents which their money gotstarted and who still serve them well, the Morgans and the Rockefellers. TheRockefellers were Marrano Jews. The original Rockefeller made his money sellingnarcotics, (they weren’t illegal then). After acquiring a little capital hebranched out in oil. But it was the Rothschild capital that made theRockefeller’s so powerful. \"They also financed the activities of Edward Harriman(railroads) and Andrew Carnegie Steel.\"[55] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn55]Co-Masters of the World -- Power Within ChristendomThe Rothschilds also wielded much influence and power not only in SecretSocieties, but also in Christendom’s churches. The Salvation Army under thesuggestion of the Rothschilds adopted the Red Shield (Roth = red and Schild =shield) for their logo. One history of the Rothschilds remarks, \"The Rothschildshad rapidly propelled themselves into a position of immense financial power andpolitical influence. They were an independent force in the life of Europe,accountable to no one and, to a large extent, reliant on no one. Popularlampoons depicted them as the real rulers of Christendom...\"[56][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn56] Some of the Rothschilds have been involved inthe campaign to loosen public morals. The first executive Secretary of theNational Student Forum was John Rothschild. This National Student Forum changedits name like articles of clothing. Speaking about clothing, one of the aims ofthis socialist group was to promote public nudity and free love. Thisorganization had the following constituent groups Radcliffe Liberal Club, UnionTheological Seminary Contemporary Club, Yale Liberal Club[57][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn57] to name just a few. A further development ofthis was the Youth Peace Federation which consisted of the League of Youth ofCommunity Church, Methodist Epworth League, NY District, Young Judea, and YoungPeople’s Fellowship of St. Phillip’s Parish[58] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn58]to name a few American religious men have ties to the Rothschilds especiallythrough their various agents.Harry Emerson Fosdick, who was Pastor of Rockefeller’s church was also among thePresidents of the Rockefeller Foundation. John Foster Dulles, CFR, was chairmanof the board of the Rockefeller Foundation, and married a Rockefeller, JanetPomeroy Avery. Remember John Foster Dulles was an important Federal Council ofChurches of Christ official. Every road leads back to the Rothschilds. There aremore items than what have been mentioned above linking the Rothschilds to thevarious tentacles. Each of the various tentacles that conspiracy theorists haveput forth,--the Jews, the Masons, the Intelligence Communities, theInternational Bankers, the Prieure de Sion, the Catholics, the Trilateralcommission, the CFR, the New Age, the Cults-- each ties back to the Rothschild’spower.Extent of Rothschild PowerAccording to one source \"it was estimated that they controlled half the wealthof the world.\"[59] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn59] The Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York was controlled by five banks which owned 53% of its stock. These fivebanks were controlled by Nathan M. Rothschild & Sons of London. Control over theU.S. Fed is basically control over the world’s money. That fact alone shows howimmense the Rothschild Power is. If one examines who has been appointed to headthe Fed, and to run it, the connections of the \"Federal\" Reserve System to theRothschilds can further be seen. Another private enterprise using the nameFederal that the Rothschilds also direct is Federal Express. Anyone else mightbe taken to court for making their businesses sound like they are government,not the Rothschilds. It is appropriate for them to appropriate the name ofFederal, because by way of MI6 via the CIA they instruct the U.S. government.Senators are bought and paid off by their system, as investigators of the BCCIare discovering. The Rothschilds have been intimately involved in witchcraft andthe Illuminati since its early known history. The Kaiser of Germany seems torefer to them when he said, \"the magic powers of money as wielded by the Lord ofLucre are powers of Black Magic at its blackest.\"[60][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn60]If only half of the wealth is controlled by the Rothschilds, it indicates thatif they are to be part of the world’s rulership, they must have allies.AlliesThe Rothschilds and Rockefellers are only two of thirteen controlling familiesof the Illuminati.[61] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn61] Two Jewish families thatappear to be prominent are the Oppenheims and the Oppenheimers. A. Oppenheim wassituated in Cologne. The Oppenheimers were early members of the BavarianIlluminati. The Bund der Gerechten (League of the Just) was an illuminati frontrun mainly by Jews who were Satanists. This Bund financed in part by theRothschilds paid the Satanist and Mason Karl Marx to write the CommunistManifesto. The Jew Gumpel Oppenheim was in the inner circle of the Bund. Hisrelative Heinrich Oppenheim masterminded the communist revolution of 1848 inGermany. The Communist Party’s official histories even accept the Bund as thepredecessor of communism.The Oppenheimers apparently are close to the Rothschilds. J. Robert Oppenheimerof the CFR was exposed as a communist. Harry Oppenheimer, an internationalbanker, is chairman of the Jewish De Beers world-wide diamond monopoly, andchairman of the Anglo-American Corp. Oppenheimers can be found in importantfinancial positions in the U.S. They help run around 10 large foundations,including the Oppenheimer Haas Trust of NY for the care of needy Jewishchildren.The Jewish Ency. Vol. 2, p. 496 indicates other Jewish families \"adopted theRothschild plan.\" These were the Lazards, Sterns, Speyers, and Seligmans. TheRothschild plan was to place family members in the 5 largest European capitalsto coordinate their activities. One of Germany’s largest magazines is the Stern,and Ernst Stern is second-in-command of the World Bank.\"[62][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn62] The Jewish families that established theFrankfurt Judenloge (this was the Masonic lodge the Rothschilds belonged to inFrankfurt) included the Adlers, Speyers, Reisses, Sichels, Ellisons, Hanaus,Geisenheimers, and Goldschmidts. Isaac Hildesheim, a Jew who changed his name toJustus Hiller is credited as being the founder of this Frankfurt lodge. MichaelHess, principal of the Reformed Jewish school Philanthropin was an importantfigure in the lodge too, as was Dr. Ludwig Baruch (later Borne) who joined in1808. Most of these Frankfurt Jewish Freemasons engaged in commerce.[63][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn63] Those Freemasons from 1817-1842 were theleaders of the Frankfurt Jewish community.[64] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn64]A gentile Mason in Frankfurt Johann Christian Ehrmann began warning the Germanpeople that the Frankfurt Jewish Masons wanted a world republic based onhumanism. In 1816 he came out with a warning pamphlet “Das Judenthum in derM[aurere]y” (“The Jews in Masonry”). A powerful ally of the world’s Jewry can beseen beginning with men like Oliver Cromwell, who was considered a Mason.Cromwell was financed by Jews, and helped the Jews gain power in England.Cromwell was willing to go along with the Jews, because he became convinced ofBritish Israelism. Since the core of the conspiracy of power is Jewish, theattitude of those allied with it hinges on their attitude toward the Jewishpeople. The religious idea that the British people are descended from the tribesof Israel doesn’t automatically place people into the camp of the conspiracy.Some of the British-Israelites realize that the so called Jewish people ingeneral have no claim over the promises of God. For that reason, they realizethat it is not the Christian duty to bow and scrape at their every move. WhenChristians can be arrested in Israel and abused, and Christians will not evenstand up for their own kind, we can see how much hold the idea of the \"ChosenRace\" theory has over Christendom. Some of the British Israelites such as theMormons, the old New England wealthy families such as make up the Order, someMasons and New Agers, and the non-Jewish members of the Priuere de Sion arecollaborating with the One-World-Power. The Anglican Church which is run by theFreemasons is strongly British Israelistic.Sorting Out the Various Identity GroupsIn contrast, a hodge-podge of groups which are opposed to the conspiracy likesome Neo-Nazi groups, and various Churches unrelated with them are alsobelievers in British Israelism. These various groups are sometimes all lumpedtogether as the \"Identity\" movement, which is misleading because of their vastdifferences. It is important to differentiate between those groups that aretrying to approach things from a Christian perspective and place themselvesunder the authority of God, and those who are setting themselves up under theNew Order’s authority, or under their own authority.Co-Masters of the World -- The MediaEustice Mullins has published his research in his book Who Owns the TV Networksshowing that the Rothschilds have control of all three U.S. Networks, plus otheraspects of the recording and mass media industry. It can be added that theycontrol Reuters too. From other sources it appears CNN, which began as anindependent challenge to the Jewish Network monopoly, ran into repeatedtrickery, and ended up part of the system. Money from B.C.C.I., (B.C.C.I. hasbeen one of the New World Orders financial systems for doing its dirty businesssuch as controlling Congressmen, and is involved with INSLA, the Iran-ContraScandal, Centrust, and other recent scandals) which has tainted so many aspectsof public power in the U.S. has also been behind CNN. Perhaps nothing dominatesthe life of some Americans as does the television. Americans sit themselvesbefore the television set and simply absorb what it projects to them. On a dayto day basis the biggest way the Rothschilds touch the lives of Americans arethe three major networks which are under Rothschild direction. To illustratethis we will examine who run the networks. This list is not current, and noattempt was to provide that. The length of writing a book insures that somematerial will be dated anyway.The Rothschild’s History by a Jewish Writer Related to the RothschildsJewish writer Anka Muhlstcin wrote a book Baron James The Rise of the FrenchRothschilds. I prefer to paraphrase and make short quotes from her book, becauseI am trying to document for the reader the mindset and history of thcRothschilds. Anka Muhlstein has nothing against the Rothschilds, so it will beeasier for the reader to accept what she says about them than from me. I can’trequire the reader to read her book, but I can try to summarize some of theappropriate thoughts. Other books also relate many of the things Anka does, butagain if I write a footnoted article, it will not carry the weight as myparaphrase will. The reader is recommended to read the book first hand if he hasthe time and is interested in the details of James’ life. The Jews in the 18thcentury were restricted to living in Ghettos. Mayer Amschel Rothschild lived inthe Frankfurt ghetto. (p.22) The Jews were repressed by outsiders. (p.23) Theylived in geographically isolated and self-contained communities (p. 24). TheJewish communities in Europe used a secret relay system between all theGhettoes. Hebrew characters were one effective code. (p.24) Because of thepersecution and repression, the Jewish communities were very tight-knit andhighly organized. (p.23) They were deeply hostile to the Christian people.Christians had restricted their own people from money-lending with interest, solending money on interest had become a Jewish enterprise. The German princes ofThurn and Taxis in the 16th century initiated a postal service. Mayer Amschelloaned them money. (p.21) \"Certainly they [the Rothschilds] discovered thelatitude that the Thurn and Taxis allowed themselves in unsealing letters,possibly divulging their contents, and according to their own interests,delaying or accelerating delivery. \" (p.22) When it profited Mayer Amschel, hewould hire Christians, but in general his business and banking were conducted byhis close knit family. For instance Mayer Amschel hired a young Christian womanto write his letters for him. (p. 25) Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his familywere wholeheartedly Jewish. (p.27) Mayer Amschel Rothschild picked his sons’wifes for the business gains the wives would bring the family. The oldest sonwas not happy with this (actually he was bitter because he was denied marriageto the woman he loved), but he complied with his father’s choice. (p.26)Amschel’s daughters all married bankers--in Worms, Sichel, and Beyfus. (p.26)Mayer had ten children and they were all employed in the family business. (p.25)The Jews were taught from childhood up, that the Christians were to blame forall their woes, and that the Christians were to be feared and detested. (p.24)Mayer Amschel had secret, underground passages. (p.22) His carriage washoneycombed with secret drawers. (p.27) The Napoleonic War greatly helped theRothschild business. (p. 27) Rothschild even outsmarted Napoleon because theRothschilds had such good connections. (p.38) The Rothschilds smuggled duringthe English blockade of Napoleon’s Europe, and made millions. (p.33) \"TheRothschilds changed course constantly during this period, always maneuvering toavoid any kind of political commitment.\" (p.34) One of the things Mayer Amschelset up, was to disperse his 5 sons to the major capitals of Europe. Ankaattributes the respectability of Jewish money lending to the help it gavemerchants and entrepreneurs. [See chap. 3.2 -this Author’s view is thatmerchants had been borrowing for centuries prior to interest taking becomingacceptable by society in the 19th century. It was greatly in part due to whoowned and controlled the major newspapers in the 19th century--Jews andMasons--that led the public to change.] \"The obligation to reimburse a loan andto pay interest became less onerous to men whose affairs had flourished as aresult of the borrowed money. The Jewish lender ceased to be a bloodsucker;often, indeed, he became an associate of the borrower.\" (p.31) [The Bible says aborrower is a slave to the lender, hardly an association to be desired.] Thebusiness of financing Monarchs was lucrative. The Rothschilds had developedseveral traits in the ghetto that made their family hard to stop. \"The greatgift the Frankfurt ghetto bestowed upon him [James Rothschild] was adaptability,a quality matched by the driving force of his ambition, his prodigious energy,tremendous powers of concentration, and determination to get even [withChristians]. James set out to make his place in the world.\" (p.40) The fiveRothschild brothers, each in the five major European capitals set up their ownprivate courier system which was faster than the regular mail. (p.47) TheRothschilds had news whether political or economic faster than anyone elseincluding the monarchs. \"Thus the Rothschilds had news before anyone else,including ministers [govt.]; they also understood how to make use of it.\" (p.47)[Somewhat akin to how money could be made off of knowing the future.] TheRothschilds normal correspondence to each other was in code.(p.46) Their worldwas one of finance, politics and secrecy. In the anti-Napoleonic time period,the Rothschilds increased their wealth ten-fold. (p.47) \"...James. He enjoyed,moreover, a rock-solid strength and stability, built up by his family, thatfamily simultaneously closed tight like a fist, united by mutual confidence andan invisible wall of secrecy, yet wide open to the outside world. Such was thecohesion of the Rothschilds that the removal of one or more of them left no gapin their common defenses.\"The Rothschilds carried out espionage with their own intelligence service, andother questionable subversive activities but none of these could be tracked.\"Whenever Mayer Amschel and his sons were on the verge of being caught out, somehighly placed person stepped in and stopped the investigation.\" (p.36)The made their money doing technically illegal activity. The original large sumof money made was to take the Elector of Hesse’s large sum and instead ofinvesting it into government bonds as directed--to put it to use at investmentsof higher returns, and giving the elector the return from the government bonds.Anka writes, \"The Elector was never the wiser, but even if he had been, he couldhardly have complained of disobedience.\" (p.34) In summary, the Mafia-likecloseness of the Rothschild family, along with their tactic to situatethemselves in all the major capitals, along with their own quick secret personalnews/intelligence/mail service gave them the contacts and the power tomanipulate all kinds of business opportunities.Where Does Nazism Fit into Satan’s Plans?Let me briefly recap what some of the plan was. And while you read these plansthat I am relaying to you from my intensive research on high level Satanism, seeif you don’t see the irony in the Satanic plans. How very ironic it is that inall the twisted thinking and reasoning of the leading Satanists for why theymust do things, it is surprising they do not catch on that this plan of Satan’sis going to achieve God’s revealed plan . How pride does blind us! (For the sakeof brevity I will dispense with my normal method of documenting everything; Isuggest that my book Be Wise As Serpents be read for documentation, and furtherquestions be written to me. Otherwise this article would be way too bulky forthe newsletter.) The \"brilliant\" plan given in detail to the Illuminati was tocreate a thesis and its opposite called the antithesis. The process would repeatitself until the desired outcome. Out of the battle between the two would emergethe synthesis. Out of the battle of chaos would come a new order reminding us ofthe Masonic slogan \"Order out of Chaos.\" If the thesis were like a hammer andthe antithesis like an anvil, what was caught in between would be broken orreshaped. Three world wars would enable the plan to work. The hammer would beconstructed and then given a homeland, a secure base in Russia. It is what wecall communism. The first anvil would be created out of economic chaos inGermany. It would be called “National Socialism.” That anvil would be destroyedin a Second World War, but another anvil would replace it called democracy. Thefirst two world wars accomplished exactly what they were intended to accomplish.Out of the First World War came: * A secure Satanic dictatorship in Russia, a secure base to carry out further world subversion. * The Satanic family of Rothschilds gained partial control over Palestine, preparing the way for Satan to rule from Jerusalem some day * Weapons of mass destruction and terror. * The League of Nations. Out of the Second World War came” * The enlargement of their secure base in Russia into a world power. * Complete control over Palestine by the Rothschilds. * Airpower, including long range missiles, jets, secret flying saucers, and powerful submarines, all items that individuals could not produce . Those in control of production would therefore control all air and sea ways of the earth. * The cold war and an era of terror to convince the people of the need for Satan’s One World Order. * The United Nations . Out of the third world war would emerge a new religious system. The third worldwar would have to be tailored to be like the Bible’s Armageddon, Satan told hishighest slaves, because- if it resembled Armageddon, then the people wouldbelieve he was the Messiah when he came after its end. It would have to beterrible, so that he could step in and bring miraculous order out of a worldbeaten into chaos by the worst war in history. Again it would be \"Order out ofchaos\", as the Masonic documents repeatedly proclaim. The third world war wouldcome during a period of seven years of tribulation starting in 1992 and runninguntil 1999. Just like the Second World War emerged out of the great world-widedepression. Satan told his followers this 1992-99 tribulation would repeat on alarger scale the plagues of Egypt, for he would wreck revenge for what was doneto Egypt by God (and Moses) by giving back in a bigger way to the world whathappened to ancient Egypt. To a demonic controlled mind it makes sense to wrecksuch revenge, especially when the end result is held out to be the salvation ofthe world by the Lightbearer, the Morning Star, also known as Lucifer. For mostof us, the idea of such pain and destruction seems like demonic madness -- whichit is .At the core of the One-World-System is Satanism. It hides itself behind frontssuch as Jewish Finance, Socialism, Aryanism, British Israelism, Zionism, andFreemasonry which are tools to get the broad masses to serve the Plan. The\"conspiracy\" to create the One-World-System has enlisted the help of almosteveryone. That is because most of the religious systems at the top arecontrolled by Satanists who know what they are doing and direct the people’sreligious efforts. (Read the research in Be Wise As Serpents for thedocumentation on this.) Nazism was a Pagan Gnostic religious system whose HighPriest Hitler knew what he was doing in relation to Satan’s mission. (More aboutthis further down.) The Jewish people (1 use the term in its broadest sense) arebeing used. Actually the allegiance of the Satanic hierarchy is not in the leastconcerned with Judaism, although it appears that at first the plans are tocreate a religious leader that will have the apparent credentials of the Jewishmessiah. How sad, because the actions of the Rothschilds and other Satanic\"Jewish\" bloodlines during W.W. II show that their first allegiance is not tothe Old Testament and not to even Orthodox Judaism, but is purely to Satan. Atsome point in the future the Orthodox Jews and the Conservative Jews will findthat this Messiah, who is already alive waiting to play his role, will only givethem temporary relief. They are being taken for a ride and then they will bedumped by the New World Order’s dictatorship.Constance Cumbey correctly notices that the New Age movement resembles Nazismexactly to a tee. For those students wanting to get a detail-by-detail parallel,go to pages 114 to 120 in The Hidden Dangers Of The Rainbow.In 1952, James Larratt Battersby in England published The Holy Book of AdolfHitler for the German World Church in Europe. Except for some of his pro-Germanideas, obviously thrown in to make the book enlist the intended audience’sfavor, the book is an exact description of what would happen in the next 50years to bring in the New World Order. The reason some of the prognosticationsof pro-German ideas are not valid is that the Satanic hierarchy is not reallyconcerned for the German people either, except to harness their help in theirplans. Batterby’s The Holy Book of Adolf Hitler was given to him \"in thespirit”. According to Battersby, the book was written in order that \"May Godopen the eyes of the Gentiles to Truth, and carry his Holy Gospel to the ends ofthe earth.\" The book is an excellent synopsis of what Satan had planned in 1952and has carried out since to a large degree. The Rothschilds (and other topSatanic families in a lesser way) financed a Jewish Mason and devoté Satanistnamed Karl Marx to write his Das Kapital. The Satanists controlling key Masonicgroups (along with some other groups they controlled) got Communism started. Theoriginal idea came from Satan, and was given at a Feast of the Beast inmeticulous detail to those highest in the Satanic Hierarchy. Albert Pike andGuiseppe Mazzini were two men in strategic positions of control that were let inon the plans.After creating International Socialism (communism) a temporary antithesis wascreated called National Socialism (Nazism). The process to create NationalSocialism was to turn again to the Masonic Lodges and other esoteric secretSocieties to get it done. Therefore, the secret esoteric gnostic and satanicsocieties along with the Illuminati helped create \"the Thule Gesellshaft\" (inEnglish, the “Thule Society”). Adolf Hitler was some type of member of thisoccult Thule Society, along with many other men who later began leading Nazileaders such as Rudolf Hess. The Thule Society used the Masonic/Hindu symbol theSwastika, which the Nazi party then also used as its symbol. In other words thegrandmother of the Nazi Party was the Masonic Lodges in Germany. The Vril wasanother secret occult group that many of the Nazi leadership belonged to. Hitleralso was a member of the Theosophical Society, which has strong Satanic andMasonic ties. Both Bailey and Hitler studied from Tibetians, Hindus, occultists,and black magicians. They also both studied the Gnostics, and every majorPagan/Occult religious system. An example of how valued the Swastika was forFreemasons before Hitler ruined its image, is a quote from Joseph Fort Newton, aBaptist Minister and high ranking Mason, \"The second of these volumes alsocontains an essay. . . by Thomas Carr, with a list of Lodges, and a study oftheir history, customs, and emblems -- especially the Swastika . SpeculativeMasons are now said to be joining.., seeking more light on what are called theLost Symbols of Masonry.\" After promoting and using the Swastika for years theFreemasons quit using it after Hitler. The Holy Book of Hitler provides theanswer as to why the Theosophical Society worked so hard to destroy the BritishEmpire. It had always at first mystified me why the Theosophical SocietyPresidents who connected to the Satanic hierarchy would want to ruin the BritishEmpire. The reason it seemed strange is that the mother country of Satanism andwitchcraft is Great Britain. The center of secret political power isgeographically in England. And further, one of the largest and most powerfulsecret fronts for Satanism is Britishism-Israelism. The reason why the BritishEmpire was destroyed was that Satan had already determined even before 1870 thatthe steps to world government would include setting up around 9 or 10Continental blocs. The Union of Europe into one country (or bloc) could not beaccomplished while Great Britain had most of her focus on her empire. GreatBritain as long as she had an empire would never want to join up with Europe. Infact all the European nations would have to be convinced to give up theircolonies, that is why the World Power got everyone they could get to help fightPortugal in Angola in recent history, everyone including the largemasonic-controlled Christian denominations who donated millions of dollars tothe NCC and WCC which moneys were then passed on to the guerillas to buy weaponsand ammo.The Theosophical Society is mostly to blame for India’s independence fromBritain. First, the Theosophical Society managed to change British policy sothat the British became unpopular. Then Theosophical President Besant, whopublished the largest English paper strongly criticized British rule in hernewspapers and eventually was arrested. Gandhi and other Indian leaders wereinvolved in Besant being made the President of the Indian Congress Party. Andthat political party still rules Indian politics. The Theosophist MahatmaGandhi, following in the steps of Theosophical President Annie Besant, led theIndian people against British rule.But the final blow to the British Empire was done by another Theosophist--AdolfHitler. It is common knowledge that the powerful blows of Axis attacks in W.W.II struck the death blow to the British Empire, or so we are told. The truth isthat the elite wanted the Empire to die, and pulled every string to convince theBritish public and indigenous natives that the Empire was too weak after W. W.II to save the empire and prevent her colonies from independence. It is hard forpeople to grasp that the Illuminati controlled Russia, Great Britain, Germanyand France during World War II, but they did. Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalinwere all Masons. DeGaulle of France was closely linked with several esotericgroups, and the Priere de Sion and Grand Orient Masons helped him to power inthe 50s. Churchill was a Zionist and pro-Fabian Socialist. Stalin was a closetSatanist. Roosevelt was a Zionist, pro-communist and socialist. Both Churchilland Roosevelt came from important elite blood lines. Apparently, Stalin wassomewhat independent, but basically did what was expected of him. As theprevious paragraph indicates the people of the world weren’t ready for a worldgovernment, and most not even a united Europe. W.W. II was carried out to adjustpeople’s thinking toward wanting European unity. Satan already ruled the worldthrough his secret chain of command, but he wanted to openly rule the world’shearts and to be publicly hailed as ruler and savior.Who was Hitler? Hitler’s father was the offspring of the Rothschild’s secretbreeding program which impregnated his grandmother. It appears from the detailsavailable, Hitler was groomed for his role, without realizing his heritage atfirst. It appears that Hitler learned of his “Jewish bloodline\" after takingover Germany. Hitler had romances with many beautiful women. Although Hitler wasvery strict with his New Age religious practices such as being a vegetarian,that did not include being celibate. He did have sex contrary to the deceptionsof the Establishment. Hitler’s seed (the Rothschild’s powerful generationaloccult bloodline) was hidden in an Askenazim bloodline, at least part of whichhas come to the U.S. In fact, Hitler’s generational occult power was passed ontoo. This was most likely done by thrusting a knife into his heart, and theperson who received his occult power then gulped his last breath with the kissof death to receive his occult power. What I am telling you is that Hitler’soffspring are alive and well and that his terrifying Anti-Christ spirit waspassed to someone and is not dead. Let me remind you of some of Hitler’s ownprophecies about himself and his goals. \"At the time of supreme peril I must diea martyr’s death for the people. But after my death will come something reallygreat, an overwhelming revelation to the world of my mission.\" The world was towitness his divinity. Further, \"My spirit will rise from the grave, and theworld will see that I was right.\" Von Ribbentrop on Apr. 30, 1945 was told thissame thing, \"You will see that my spirit will rise from the grave. \"NationalSocialism \"is even more than a religion; it is the will to make mankind anew.\"\"All creative energy will pass to the new man.\" Hitler claimed to be the realfulfillment of Marx’s socialism. \"I am not only the conqueror, but also theexecutor of Marxism, of that part of it which is essential and justified,stripped of its Jewish-Talmudic dogma.\" In essence, he is saying whatever veneerof Jewishness that Marx’s satanic plan had, he disagreed with it and woulddestroy that veneer . These type of statements reveal that the essence of themessage of various elite men like Hitler is the same Satanic plan if stripped oftheir variously decorated veneers. Hitler is viewed as the Messiah, the Holy Spirit, the martyred Savior of hispeople by his followers today. The blasphemous Holy Book of Adolf Hitler states,\"All hail to God’s Christ and Chosen, Adolf Hitler...Lord of Lords, and King ofKings, the Eternal Adolf Hitler.\" Such blasphemy! Father, forgive them for theyknow not what they do. Hitler’s Demonic Spirit and Hitler’s descendants bothlive on today. (By the way, some Rothschild descendants such as Hitler’s havecome to Christ as their Lord and Savior!) Will this powerful occult branch ofthe Rothschild’s be used again by the New World Order? Whatever the case it isclear that Hitler’s Anti-Christ spirit will get plenty of demonic help. Thedemonic forces that have manifested themselves in National Socialism andInternational Socialism (aka Communism) demonized much of Europe. So much sothat Europe officially portrays itself as a beast with Venus on it on a stampcommemorating the Second election of the European Parliament, and also as thesame forces that tried to build the Tower of Babel on an official poster. Notonly are the same demons that led communist leaders and Nazi leaders operatingin Europe’s leaders, but there are armies of demons trampling over anything ofmoral value in Europe . It can be said without a doubt that the “man\" who rulesthe One-World-Government will derive his power from a demonic supernaturalsource. According to Revelations, God is going to have an angel open up a key tothe abyss and teeming hordes of demonic spirits shall be descending upon theEarth . My conclusion is that Satan has so many Anti-Christs available thatHitler’s personal occult power is not necessary for the New World Order’ssuccess.I rarely like to comment on the end times from Scriptures because I feel likemost people are thoroughly confused about the clear teachings that theScriptures give. 2 Thes. 2:3 and other Scriptures make it clear that theChristians must witness a great apostasy and the Anti-Christ being revealedbefore Christ returns. We can live everyday as if it may be our last, butScriptures are clear that the Apostles did not live each day as if Jesus couldreturn that day. They knew that certain things had to happen first. The churchhas been going through tribulations since Pentecost. The church will go throughthe \"great tribulation\" according to the Word of God. We will if we are thatfaithful remnant we will be spared from the Wrath of God, but we will not bespared from the tribulation of Satan which shall include martyrdom. The New Ageleaders are fully ready to cooperate with this \"cleansing\" from the earth of usbothersome disciples of Truth. In this respect, their thinking will resemble theNazi’s rationalizations that people must pay their Karmic debt, and shallbenefit from being killed. How truth can be stood on its head! The Plans arealready drawn up how to use rail lines to move large groups of civilians tolabor camps. When we compare Nazi Germany with today’s New World Order plans,Nazi Germany can be seen to be the basic model of what Satan’s timetableincludes for us these next few years.To illustrate that the Pagan religion of Nazism is an example to the Satanistsand New Agers, let us ponder Anton LaVey’s (head of a visible Church of Satan)trip to the sacred initiation castle of Hitler’s Black Order the SS. The SSapparently brought the Holy Grail to Germany, and hid it before the end of thewar. On May 2, 1945, a select group of SS officers, those initiated into thehigher mysteries of the Nazi Pagan religion, hid the Grail in the SchleigeissGlacier at the foot of 3,000 meter high Hochfeiler Mountain. Seekers in the areahave been found decapitated, and mutilated . The area is still guarded by theBlack Order in anticipation of the day that the Grail can be revealed to theworld. It has been speculated 1995 might be the date, but this is purespeculation. The important thing for us is to begin to experience the Kingdom ofGod right now. Let us prepare ourselves for Almighty God’s New World Order asthe Satanists launch their counterfeit New World Order.Part 1 --The Rothschilds BeginningThe Rothschilds are one of the most well-known of the thirteen families. DavidJ. Smith of Portland was asked to prepare an article on the Rothschilds for thisnewsletter. His article follows this introduction. Satan’s selective breedingprogram has been continuing down through the ages hidden from the eyes of thepublic. One of the most powerful Rothschild bloodline families in America arethe Springs. The Springs were originally the Springsteins when they came toAmerica in the mid-1700s and settled in NY and NJ. They later changed their namefrom Springstein to Springs to hide their identity. Leroy Springs was hired byLC. Payseur. Now most American’s have to ask, who is L.C. Payseur? One of themost secret and most powerful families in North America has been the Payseurs.They have been so powerful that they could hide their wealth and power, and useother Satanic families as proxies. The Payseurs are part of the 13th topIlluminati family. The first Payseur to come to America was the former crownprince of France Daniel Payseur (1785-1860). He came over about 1805 to the U.S.and married Susannah Kiser c. 1814. They had two boys Adam and Jonas (1819-1884). Jonas married Harrietta Smith and they had Lewis Cass Payseur (1850-1939).It was this Lewis Cass Payseur who hired the Rothschild bloodline of the Springsto run a number of the Payseur’s companies. The Payseurs were one of theoriginal big railroad families along with Issac Croom and William H. Beatty.Isaac Croom’s wife was a sister of William Beatty’s, so the reader can see howall these elite bloodlines intertwine. Remember that LC. Payseur hired LeroySprings to operate a host of his companies. Leroy Springs father was A.A.Springs and A.A. Springs was the secret father of Abraham Lincoln.In 1808, Nancy Hanks, of the lineage of the McAdden Scottish family visited someof her family at Lincolnton, N.C. Nancy Hawks visited the Springs family andthat is when A.A. Springs impregnated her, and her child when born was namedAbraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln’s Rothschild blood was kept very secret, but hedid grow up to be a famous lawyer, a secret leader of the Rosicrucians, andPresident of the United States. It is believed from the evidence that theestablishment conspiracy concocted the person of Thomas Lincoln out of thin air.The actual early history of Abraham Lincoln is shrouded in myth and mystery, andas one encyclopedia puts it, \"We know little about the family of his mother,Nancy Hanks Lincoln.\" While a lawyer, Abraham Lincoln had a sexual liaison withElizabeth who was the illegitimate daughter of German King Leopold, who is alsoof elite blood lineage. Abraham Lincoln and Elizabeth had two twin daughtersElla and Emily in 1856 who were adopted out. Lincoln in fact had a fairly largenumber of illegitimate children. Now A. A. Springs, who was both the biologicalfather of Leroy Springs and Abraham Lincoln left an enormous amount of land inwhat is now Huntsville, AL to his son Abraham Lincoln. Huntsville, AL by the wayhas become a hotbed of NWO activity. Some of the mind-control research theintelligence community has been conducting has been done at Huntsville. TheRothschilds even named one of their boys after Abraham Lincoln, his name wasLincoln Rothschild. Although Abraham Lincoln secretly had powerful occult blood,he was a great man in his own right. And just like JFK, he had the strength ofpersonality to refuse to bow to the Illuminati’s instructions. Lincoln refusedto go the path that his distant European International Banking Rothschildrelatives wanted for the United States. The Illuminati goal had been to splitthe U.S. into two easier to control nations. And just as with JFK, who also camefrom a top 13 family, a large scale conspiracy Involving many governmentofficials including the Secretary of Defense was put into place to assassinateLincoln. There are numerous indications that show that the Rothschilds were inpart behind the assassination of Lincoln. Some of the men who worked for thePayseurs of the 13th top family were Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan, theVanderbilts, Giftord Pinnchot, and John D Rockefeller. These men were selectedto run Payseur companies because they belonged to the satanic elite. The LeroySprings family got Payseur family companies in the early 1920s. It was Leroythat managed to get the Rothschild’s involved with the Federal Reserve. Twocompanies that have come out of the Payseur’s old Lancaster Manufacturing Co.ins Weyerhaeuser and Crown-Zellerbach. I have long know these were companiestied to the elite, but it wasn’t until i found the secret Payseur family at thevery top of these companies that I really understood the full story. ThePayseurs have gone to extreme lengths to corrupt government documents, such ascourthouse records. They have hidden the births of many of their descendants,and have covered over with extreme secrecy most of their monetary holdings.Remember the Beatty family was an early railroad family with business ties tothe Payseur family. Bartholomew F. Moore, who was the private attorney for yearsto President Abraham Lincoln, was a blood relative of the Beatty family. It wasBart Fingers Moore who co-authored the 14th amendment for the conspiracy. TheBeatty family continually resurfaces when doing research on the conspiracy.Shirley MacLaine, the famous New Age leader/author is from the Beatty family.She credits her start to Edgar Cayce by the way, who in turn was interested inBlavatsky. Blavatsky was a student of the Mason Anton Mesmer, who introduced theworld to hypnotism. Hypnotism had been secretly practiced by the MysteryReligions for thousands of years before Mesmer taught Blavatsky and others aboutit. Charles Beatty Alexander, who is an Illuminati ”prince\"/Pilgrim Societymember is an example of a Beatty in recent times who was within the elite.Quantrill, who was a famous Confederate Colonel and guerilla leader, whose bandof raiders evolved into the Jessie James gang was married into the Springs(Rothschild) familyThe recent Madelyn Payseur Gatling Fulghum (1876-1972) was the late head of thePayseur family. The documentation on the above families is extensive, but muchof the evidence that has been photocopied out of the few documents left intacthave been destroyed since the documents were photocopied. The amount oftampering with official documents is incredible, and further illustrates theenormous power the Rothschilds and the Payseurs (the 13th family--the Holy Bloodline) have. The researchers who wrote Holy Blood, Holy Grail got a taste of thepower of the 13th blood line to manipulate documents held by libraries andgovernments in Europe. The same type of thing has been happening in the UnitedStates. The researcher into the Satanic elite has a hard row to hoe because theSatanic families have tried to cover their tracks through history. They havealso tried very hard to cover up what their financial assets are. ThoseRothschilds who have carried on the Rothschild name have had a highervisibility. It is this group of Rothschilds which have gained the public’sattention, even though they too are very secretive.The origins of the Masonic and Rosicrucian movements lie with the medievalalchemists. Manly P. Hall, Freemasonry’s greatest philosopher writes, “Duringthe Middle Ages, alchemy was not only a philosophy and a science but also areligion. Those who rebelled against the religious limitations of their dayconcealed their philosophic teachings under the allegory of gold-making. In thisway they preserved their personal liberty and were ridiculed rather thanpersecuted. Alchemy is a threefold art, its mystery well symbolized by atriangle.\" (The Secret Teachings of All Ages, pg CLIV-ul) -- Manly P Hall alsostates in his book on magic entitled Magic, \"... [the] pentagram. This was knownto medieval alchemy as the sign of the cloven hoof .... (Hall.. Magic, LosAngeles, CA: Philosophical Research Soc., pg. 46) Quicksilver (which was one ofthe things the early Astor family traded in) was one of the primary itemsemployed in the alchemical transmutations. The oxide produced using quicksilverwas considered magical and mystically identified with the god Osiris. As thereader may have already figured out, alchemy practiced Hermetic magic fromancient Egypt. Alchemy was really a front for the mystery religion of Satanicwitchcraft. The leading alchemist was a German Richard Bauer who was alivesometime in the 14 or 15 hundreds. Richard Bauer is said to have been the onlyalchemist who was successful in transforming lead to gold. Whether that reportis meant in an allegorical way, or some other way I do not know. What I amtrying to communicate is that the Bauer family was a leading alchemical familywhich secretly practiced Hermetic magic during the late Middle Ages. David’sarticle on the Rothschilds is meant to be an extension of what I have alreadyput out on the Rothschilds. For instance my chapter 3.3 in the Be Wise AsSerpents book. Chapter 3.3 is entirely devoted to the Rothschilds. I chose themto write about in the book, because the family is the most renown of the Satanicfamilies and the easiest to expose to people just becoming acquainted with whatis going on. The other family which has a chapter devoted to it is the Russellfamily. The Russell family has yet to be covered in this series, [The RussellBloodline is the next section in this book] but was covered in the Be Wise AsSerpents book because of their importance to the Watchtower Bible & TractSociety. I am aware of intense secret meetings that have been going on inFrankfurt and Moscow between World Bank officials. These secret meetings havebeen going on now for two months which gives some of the scope of theirimportance. Undoubtedly the Rothschilds are playing a role in these secretmeetings, even while I write this. There has been a great deal of misinformationput out that the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers are fighting for control ofthe world. It is true that they are in intense competition in some areas. It hasalso been true that they have been in intense cooperation in many areas. One ofthe difficulties for people to sort out what is going on, is that they don’tknow about the Satanic spiritual dimension of the Rothschilds and theRockefellers. For instance, to make an analogy, if I am a minister and one of mybrothers-in-Christ is my upline on a multi-level marketing distributorship, thenhe is my business head, but I could be the spiritual leadership that he looks upto. The point is that essentially all researchers trying to expose the NWO aredrawing conclusions about occult power on the basis of business relationships,and it doesn’t always work. Sometimes the business boss may be in a secretsatanic leadership position over someone else, but it may also be that both menare on equal footing when it comes to occult power and status within theIlluminati. So far I have seen only one book advertised (and I haven’t read it)which claims to expose the conflict between the Rothschilds and the Rockefellersas a sham. If It really does show this, then the book has contributed greatlytoward helping people tear down their misunderstandings about the Illuminatipower structure. The House of RothschildIf one looked on the backstage of history, he would find the House ofRothschild. They have indebted Kings, manipulated kingdoms, created wars andmolded the very shape of the international world. Among the hierarchy of theIlluminati they are revered as a powerful satanic bloodline. They are \"livinglegends.\"Said one biographer: \"In America a boy wants to become President. In Europe hewould rather be a Rothschild.... ‘To be ‘a Rothschild’ is to be a modernCroesus, a twentieth-century Midas.\" They are a dynasty of enduring power; a\"magic\" bloodline In Satan’s Empire. We will probably never know exactly whenoccultism was introduced to the Rothschilds. Several of their ancestors havebeen rabbis, so the occultism probably came in the form of Jewish Cabalism,Sabbatism, or Frankism. The House of Rothschild practices gnostic-Satanism (theRothschilds would probably not call themselves Satanists, but by our standardsthey are, considering the sacrificial and spiritual worship involved). The truthis sometimes hard to tell. The stories the family weave are hard to distinguishfrom the truth. Myths are one of their best weapons, and a researcher must bewary. The family began in Frankfort, Germany (the city where paper money waspopularized). The oldest known Rothschild went by the name of Uri Feibesch wholived in the early 16th century. His descendants lived in the House of RedShield. His great, great, great, great Grandson was Moses Bauer, who lived inthe early 18th century. The family was mostly made-up of Jewish retail traders,and lived in the Judengasse, or “Jew’s Alley” in Frankfort. Jew’s Alley was theproduct of the anti-Semitic bent in Europe, and did not have very good livingconditions.Most Ashkenazim Jews of that time did not use surnames, instead they preferredthe Chinese custom of using a symbol as the family identity. These symbols weresometimes used on signs outside Jewish houses as an address. Some Jews had takenon surnames, to fit in, but the use of symbols was more popular. The earlyRothschilds chose the surname Bauer (meaning “farmer” in German. Why would afamily of retail traders call themselves Bauer? Perhaps to remain un-noticed).The Bauer line continues today, but in the 1700s one man re-named his branch ofthe family after its symbol and address - the Red Shield or the Seal of Solomon.Mayer Amschel Bauer was a well-off coin trader in Frankfort. In front of hishouse hung a sign with the family’s symbol, which was a red hexagram. Thehexagram (also known as the Seal of Solomon, the Magden David, or the Star ofDavid) is very occultic. It is used today as the symbol of Israel, but It is not“Jewish.\" In his excellent book The Six-Pointed Star, O.J. Graham explains thatthe hexagram was used in the ancient mystery religions. It was the symbol ofMoloch, Ashtoreth, and others. In fact, the hexagram was used to representSaturn, which earlier newsletters have discussed. The six-pointed star isconsidered the equivalent of the Oriental Yin-and-Yang symbol, which is theLuciferian concept of balancing good and evil. The symbol appears to have beenused by King Solomon when he apostatized, and was thereafter called the Seal ofSolomon. Later on, Jewish Cabalism (or Occultism - different name, same game)picked it up as a magic symbol. Through the promotion of the Cabalists and theZionists it has become the symbol of Jewish identity, although the occultcircles know better. The Bauer’s use of a hexagram as their family sign pointsto their involvement in Jewish Cabalism. In fact, the six-pointed star was sosignificant to them that Mayer Amschel Bauer decided to adopt it as his new name- Mayer Amschel Rothschild (Rot-schildt = Red Shield). I believe this was doneto identify his family with occultism and the likes of Saturn or Ashtoreth (whomthe Astors are named after). Mayer was sent to be a rabbi when he was 10, in1753. A year and a half later his parents died. Mayer was brilliant and wasencouraged by relatives to continue his studies but coin trading was his love.He left the school and when 13 and was sent to Hanover to be an apprentice atthe Illuminati Oppenheimer bank. He worked there for 7 years, learning the in’sand out’s of money. The big question is why he left the Oppenheimer bank. It wasa good situation, both financially and socially (Hanover was less antagonistictowards the Jews than Frankfort). Why leave this security and head back home toan uncertain future? Because the future wasn’t all that uncertain. While inHanover Mayer made the acquaintance of General von Estorff, a numismatist whowas impressed by Mayer’s knowledge of the subject. In 1763 General von Estorffleft Hanover and joined the Court of Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau, whoseterritory included Frankfort. Mayer knew that through his connections he wouldbe able to get some business with the Prince. It appears Mayer’s stay at theOppenheimer bank was used to establish himself in Illuminati circles and to finda way to get close to the Illuminati royalty. General von Estorff was his key.Prince William of Hesse-Hanau was tied into the Illuminati. He was the son ofLandgrave Frederick or Hesse-Cassel, of the royal family of Hesse. PrinceWilliam was a Freemason, and his younger brother Karl, was according to Jews andFreemasons in Europe, 1723-1939, “…accepted as the head of all GermanFreemasons.” Members of the Hesse dynasty have been described as the leaders ofthe Strict Observance (in 1782 a Masonic Congress in Wilhelmsbad, a city in theHesse province, dropped the name ‘Strict Observance’ and changed it to\"Beneficent Knights of the Holy City\"). The Hesse dynasty is totally connectedto the Illuminati. Prince William was the grandson of King George II of England.The Hesse-Cassel’s were one of the richest royal houses in Europe. Their incomecame mainly from the loaning-out of Hessian soldiers to foreign countries. (Theelite loves to makes profit off of \"peacekeeping\" troops, which is exactly whatthe Hessians were called. This \"peacekeeping\" always adds up to imperialism. TheHessian troops were used by England in the American Revolution, in fact thecolonial armies fought more Hessian soldiers than English. The House ofHesse-Cassel made a lot of money off the American Revolution.) Another exampleof the Hesse-Cassel’s ties to the Illuminati is the enigmatic figure St.Germain, who is hailed as a New Age Messiah-figure. Many researchers believethat St. Germain was the son of Francis II of Transylvania. Francis II’s secondwife was Charlotte Amalie of the House of Hesse, he married her in 1694. St.Germain was either her son, or the prior wife’s, this point is debated. His namewas Leopold-George and they staged his death in 1700 to save him from the deadlycollapse of the Transylvanian dynasty. Prince Karl of Hesse, Masonic leader ofGermany, wrote that St. Germain had been sent down to Italy to be raised by theMedici family. Later on St. Germain appeared out of nowhere to work with theelite. There were questions as to his identity and Napoleon Ill had a dossiergathered on him, but the house holding the dossier was mysteriously destroyed ina fire. St. Germain was an alchemist and he claimed to have the alchemicalElixir of Life, the secret formula of immortality (which the Rosicrucians alsoclaimed to have). He was a guest of William and Karl of Hesse in 1774, and in1779 returned to Karl to spend the last years of his known life. HelenaBlavatsky, cofounder of the Theosophical Society claimed that St. Germain wasone of the Hidden Masters of Tibet who secretly controlled the world’s destiny.In 1930 Guy Ballard claimed that he met St. Germain on Mount Shasta. Thissupposed meeting led to the creation of the ‘I AM’ movement.The Hesse Dynasty has lasted clear up to the 20th century. During WWII they wereon Hitler’s side. Prince Philip of Hesse was a messenger between Hitler andMussolini. He was still alive in 1973 and was reported to be the richest princein Europe. The House of Hesse is still a powerful force in Germany. In 1763Mayer left Hanover to build his fortune in Frankfort. His main objective was tobecome a financial agent of Prince William of Hesse-Hanau. Prince William was anintelligent man who loved to make money. (His passions went beyond money. Hiswife did not please him so he became an adulterer and almost every woman heslept with became pregnant. He fathered between 70 to 21 illegitimate children.His main mistress, Frau von Lindenthal, bore him eight children and ran hishousehold.) William loved to loan money at high interest rates. He was theperfect man to aid Mayer’s quest for riches. Mayer began bribing PrinceWilliam’s servants to become informants. At that time he was an antique dealer,trader, coin collector, and exchanger (the country was divided and as a resultthe separate currencies made money exchanging very profitable). General vonEstorff convinced Prince William of the value of a rare coin collection and thenrecommended Rothschild. Thus began the relationship between the Prince and theRothschilds. Mayer would sell rare coins, precious stones, and antiques to thePrince at ridiculously low prices. Then, in 1769, after a significant amount ofsales, he wrote the Prince asking for and receiving the designation ‘Crown Agentto the Prince of Hesse-Hanau\" (a great commercial advertiser. Titels and honorswere important in that day, they opened doors). Mayer then married GutleSchnapper, daughter of a respected merchant, Wolf Salomon Schnapper, in 1770. Hethen set up a money exchange bureau. His two brothers worked in this bureau withhim until 1785 when Kalmann died and Moses quite. Some researchers contend thatAdam Wieshaupt of the Bavarian Illuminati was financially supported by theRothschilds. The Bavarian Illuminati was founded in 1776, and the Rothschildswere not necessarily a financial power at that time. I may be wrong, but I donot believe Mayer was in a financial position to support Wieshaupt. It ispossible, though, that when, in 1782, the headquarters of the Illuminati movedto Frankfort, that it began to be controlled by the Rothschilds.In 1785 Prince William’s father, Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Cassel, died andWilliam became the new Landgrave. This made him the richest prince in Germanyand possibly Europe. He left the small province of Hesse-Hanau to become rulerin Hesse-Cassel. Around this time Wolf Schnapper, Mayer’s father-in-law,introduced Rothschild to Carl Buderus who was the Prince’s chief financialadvisor. Through either coercion, friendship, or occultic ties, Mayer was ableto convince Buderus to become an agent for him. This was a big mover for Mayer.The Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel was to be the ‘steppingstone\" to power.Until then Mayer had only done meager business with William, but by 1789 Buderusmanaged to get some royal bills for Rothschild to discount. This wasn’t much,but it was a start. Carl received a cut of the profits when he did William’sbusiness through Rothschild. This was the beginning of a long financialrelationship that would benefit both parties.Mayer Amschel Bauer-Rothschild was a shrewd man, but his quick rise in socialstatus shows the power of money, for Mayer was not cultured. He could nevermaster the German language and so he and his family spoke a strange YiddishGerman mixture (which benefitted their secret network). He enjoyed discussingthe medieval world and coin collecting. When it came to business he was ruthlessand naturally adept. His occult side was well hidden. He was most likely aCabalistic Jew. Although it is not known if he was a Freemason, he did accompanythe Landgrave on several trips to Masonic lodges (after the two had becomebetter friends). He had 5 daughters and 5 sons, plus several children that diedyoung. He moved from his old house, the “Haus zur Hinterpfann\", to a new one,Green Shield, when he started making more money. Green Shield was a dualresidency and the other half was occupied by the Schiff family who were to playan important role later on as agents of the Rothschilds. Every passage of GreenShield held hidden shelves and cupboards, and the backyard counting house’swalls had a number of secret shelves and a secret underground room which wasconnected to a neighbor’s house for a quick getaway if necessary (the house wasbuilt to protect Jews from the dangerous pogroms that would sweep Germany, itwas a great place to secretly practice their gnostic-satanic rituals, if theywere yet involved in that form of worship). His five sons have been called theMayer brothers because they all shared that middle name: Amschel Mayer, SalomonMayer, Nathan Mayer, Kalmann (Carl) Mayer, and Jacob (James) Mayer. Each sonentered the family business at the age of 12. The humorous side of studying anelite Illuminati family is the biographer’s insistence on owing the family’sability to profit from circumstances as \"luck.’ They never seem to put two andtwo together. Many of these circumstances happened by design. They always saythings like ‘... the infant opportunity seemed to be the child of coincidence.\"They never attribute a family’s wealth to well-planned extortion, cheating, orthievery, which is exactly how families like the Rothschilds attain theirriches. The French Revolution is an example. The Illuminati fueled FrenchRevolution got under way in the 1790’s, and Prince William began to get nervous.He was afraid the revolutionary riots would reach Germany and he would lose hisgold. So he invested his money in a magnificent new palace called Wilhelmshoe,which was built from 1791 to 1798. Although the French Revolution frightenedWilliam it was a delight for Mayer. The war helped his sales. When the Frenchended up pitted against the Holy Roman Empire, the prices of imported goodsskyrocketed and importing goods from England was a Rothschild specialty. In factMayer’s English trade helped him secure a deal with the Landgrave (throughBuderus, of course) in which he became a middleman in England’s payments for thehire of Hessian soldiers. ‘...every ill wind of the 1790’s seemed to blow goodto the Rothschilds.\" The winds were so good that by the end of the decade theywere established as a rich and independent family. In 1800 they were the 11thrichest family in Frankfort’s Jew Alley (not counting the wealth in proxy).Around the turn of the century Mayer decided to send his most clever son, Nathanto England to establish another Rothschild House. The family tells a silly storyabout Nathan leaving for England to best an annoying English cotton trader, butI believe that Nathan was sent by Mayer with a specific purpose - to establishpower with the Rothschild network in that country. Nathan arrived in Englandwith no knowledge of the language but a great amount of money. He would soon bethe most powerful man in Europe. Many more profitable events occurred at theturn of the century. Many of these events revolve around the Rothschildinfiltration of the Thurn and Taxis postal system. The House of Thurn and Taxiswas of the Black Nobility. In 1516 Holy Roman Emperor Maximilion I (of theMerovinglan bloodline and husband of a member of the Black Nobility)commissioned the House to create a mounted postal service between Vienna andBrussels. The service eventually included all of Central Europe. The head officeof the system was in Frankfort, which was rather convenient for Mayer whoproceeded to do business with them. His relationship with Thurn and Taxis becameso close that the service began to inform him of any pertinent Information foundamong the letters (that they had a habit of covertly reading). This mail fraudsystem was also used by the Emperor Francis to keep abreast of his enemies.While Mayer was receiving stolen news from Thurn and Taxis he was busy settingup his own postal service so that no-one could secretly discover his dealings.This system was eventually so effective that the Rothschilds became the best andfastest informed individuals in the world. The system was so good that manyprominent men began to send their letters through the Rothschilds, who ofcourse, always snuck a peak at the contents. The business with Thurn and Taxishelped Mayer receive the title “Imperial Crown Agent\" in 1800. This title servedas a passport that allowed him to travel throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Italso provided the right to bear arms, and it freed him from having to pay thetaxes and obligations upon the Jews of that period. Mayer began to get even moretitles, including one from the German Order of St. John. His sons Amschel andSalomon were also busy getting various titles. In 1801 they became crown agentsof the Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel. All these titles were wonderful, butmost important were the Landgrave’s. The Landgrave was the richest Prince inEurope and the Rothschilds were determined to take advantage of his wealth.The relationship with the Landgrave improved greatly in 1803. A Danish King, andcousin of William, asked the Prince for loans but William declined because hedid not want anyone to know how rich he had become. Rothschild learned about itand through Buderus, proposed lending the money anonymously. William thought theidea was splendid. The loan was sent through Mayer and a Hamburg Jew. Theinterests were paid to Rothschild who, after taking commission, forwarded themoney to the Landgrave. The event was a great triumph, after 36 years, Mayer hadfinally done a significant job for the Prince. Six more Landgrave loans toDenmark were negotiated by Rothschild. Many more loans ensued (although theyrequired some teeth pulling on Buderus’ part), including loans to the Order ofSt. John. This negotiating of the Landgrave’s loans greatly increased thereputation of the House of Rothschild. By this time Napoleon had come to powerin France. This caused a distress in Europe, but brought great profits to theHouse of Rothschild. As one biographer put it \"Napoleon seemed bent on improvingthe Rothschild’s lot in life.\" Even though Napoleon was not purposely doing it,the conditions he created were of great benefit. Napoleon tried to get theLandgrave as his ally, but Prince William squirmed and politely as possiblerefused. William’s goal was to wait until the winning side in the Napoleonicconflict was clear so that he could join without any risks. The pressure of thesituation gave the Landgrave a very bad temper. By this time half the crownheads of Europe were in his debt. Napoleon grew tired of the Landgrave’s games.His troops Invaded Germany and the province of Hesse to \"remove the House ofHesse-Cassel from rulership and to strike It out of the list of powers.\"Wllhelmshoe became frantic as William attempted to hide his riches. After thescramble to conceal his wealth he fled the province and went to live in exile inDenmark. The French immediately found most of his treasures. Buderus and Mayerhad to act fast to preserve the wealth of the Landgrave. Some of the valuableshad already been sold. They quickly bribed a French General, Lagrange, whoturned over 42 trunks to Hessian officials and lied to Napoleon about thePrince’s true wealth. Lagrange’s deceptive act was eventually discovered and hewas dismissed, but much of the wealth was preserved. During the frantic momentsbefore Hesse-Cassel’s Invasion, the Landgrave gave Buderus the right to collectthe Interest payments due from Holy Roman Emperor Francis. Buderus eventuallytransferred this right to the Rothschilds. Mayer began doing the Landgrave’sbusiness behind Napoleon’s back. These secret dealings were greatly boosted bythe man Napoleon appointed to rule the area -Karl von Dalberg. Dalberg was afriend of Mayer and Buderns and had done business with them (his connection tothem may have also been occult). Napoleon made Dalberg Primate of the newConfederation of the Rhine, which included Frankfort. As ruler of the regionDalberg protected the Rothschilds from being exposed as traders of contrabandand as agents of the House of Hesse-Cassel. When the French cut off trade withEngland prices on Imports soared. The Rothschilds smuggled goods in and madelarge profits, with Dalberg keeping guard. \"It was certainly most remarkable,\"said one biographer. \"That the Archbishop and Lord of the Confederation of theRhine, who ruled over sixteen German princes, and stood so high in Napoleon’sfavor, should have shown so much good-will to the Jewish Mayer AmschelRothschild at Frankfort, who, although now a rich man, had no claim to move inhigh and influential circles.\" Despite Dalberg’s protection Mayer kept two setsof books, one open to inspection and the other secret. By 1807 Buderus, as proxyfor the Landgrave, was almost exclusively using the Rothschilds for Hesse-Casselbusiness. Mayer himself would visit the Prince in exile, but since he wasgetting old he soon had to give up these trips and sent his sons on thejourneys. The House of Rothschild was collecting the income of the wealthiestprince in Europe less than half a century after Mayer had begun building hisfortune! The satanic House of Rothschild’s Illuminati dealings at this time arewell exemplified by their involvement with the second Tugenbund League. Thefirst Tugenbund League (or Virtue League) was formed in 1786 as a kind of sexsociety. The group would meet at Henrietta Herz’s home (her husband was anIlluminati Jew who was the disciple of the powerful occultist MosesMendelssohn). Many Illuminists attended this \"Virtue\" League. A number of youngJewish women whose husbands were always away on business would come to theHerz’s house to participate in the immorality (two members were daughters ofMoses Mendelssohn). Frequenters of this ‘salon\" included revolutionary FreemasonMlrabeau, William von Humbolt, and Frederick von Gentz who was to become animportant Rothschild agent. Later on, I will discuss Gentz in further detail. In1807 the second Tugenbund League was formed. This League pursued‘moral-scientific\" and political aims. The main aim being the deliverance ofGermany from French occupation. The League was formed by Baron von Stein who wasits principle \"protector.\" Thomas Frost wrote in Secret Societies of theEuropean Revolution that “The Initiations [into the second Tugendbund]multiplied rapidly, and the League soon numbered in its ranks most of theCouncilors of State, many officers of the army, and a considerable number of theprofessors of literature and science.... A central directorate at Berlin,presided over by Stein, had the supreme control of the movement, and exercised,through provincial committees, an authority all the more potent from emanatingfrom an unknown source, and which was obeyed as implicitly as the decrees ofEmperor or King.” The Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel held an importantposition in the second Tugendbund. Buderus was also involved. It appears theRothschilds were members and they were “go-betweens for the [Landgrave’s]correspondence on this matter, and made payments in favor of the Tugendbund.\"This put Mayer Rothschild at the head of the propaganda system against Napoleon.Napoleon tried to suppress Tugundbund but it went underground, concealing itselfunder the protection of the English Masonic Lodge at Hanover, It assisted manyanti-Napoleon causes physically and financially. Tugendbund was eventuallydissolved, but many of its members moved on to other Masonic societies such asthe ‘Black Knights,’ ‘The Knights of the Queen of Prussia,\" and ‘TheConcordists.\" In 1818 the second Tugundbund was revived as the Burschenschaft(Association of Boys or Fellows). The Burschenschaft was a revolutionary groupof students who introduced martial exercises into the universities. TheBurschenschaft eventually fell apart. After a few years the exiled Landgravecame to totally trust the Rothschilds. “...[Prince William] got more and moreaccustomed to following [Mayer] Rothschild’s advice, and scarcely took anyimportant financial step without consulting him.” This princely steppingstonewas working out perfectly. It was paving the way towards Rothschild financialfreedom. Mayer wanted to become a creditor, and his goal was soon achieved. In1810 the Rothschild’s firm became “Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Sons\" (Nathanwas not a public partner of this firm). That same year Mayer loaned his ownmoney to Denmark and when Dalberg took out a big loan to go to the baptism ofNapoleon’s son, the financial security of the Frankfort bank was set in stone.The House of Rothschild needed a new steppingstone. The old one, the Landgrave,would not be discarded, but they needed a younger, more political man who couldbe their key to controlling Europe. That man was Prince Clemens Metternich whoin 1809 became the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs. He became the leadingopposition of Napoleon, and the Landgrave moved in his exile to Austria, hopingthe powerful up-start would get Hesse back. So the Rothschild network increasedits operations in Austria - the land of the Hapsburgs. Around this time MayerAmschel Bauer-Rothschild got sick. Before his death he wrote a Will that woulddictate the structure of the Rothschilds. Although the exact contents of Mayer’sWill have been kept secret, one edict is clear. It completely excluded thedaughters and their husbands and heirs from the business, and all knowledge ofit. The Will totally exalted the importance of the family circle. On Sept. 19,1812 Mayer died. A bogus legend about his death maintains that his five sonsgathered around his deathbed and he split Europe between them. Only Amschel andCarl were in Frankfort when he died. Nathan was in England, and Salomon andJames were on the road (the brothers were constantly traveling).The \"Five Wizards’When Mayer died, headship over the family fell on Nathan Rothschild of England.Even though Nathan was not the oldest, the five brothers had voted unanimouslythat he was the most capable to lead them. Nathan was an intelligent,uneducated, self-absorbed jerk. Though he was an impolite, foul-mouthed man(“...he could swear like a trooper.”) his money got him into the high society ofEngland. His cold view on life and power is seen in his response to an EnglishMajor who was being sentimental about the horrible deaths of the large number ofsoldiers that had died in the war. “Well,” said Rothschild. “If they had not alldied, Major, you presumably would still be a drummer.” There is a story thatsays one of Nathan’s sons asked him how many nations there were in the world andNathan replied: “There are only two you need to bother about. There is themishpoche [Yiddish for family] and there are the others.” This story may befalse, but the attitude is real.Nathan first settled in Manchester, England, the center of cloth manufacturing.In 1804 he moved to London. As his wealth and his reputation began to grow hewas able to marry Hannah Cohen. The Cohens were a wealthy Jewish family fromAmsterdam, and Hannah’s father, Salomon Cohen was a respected merchant inLondon. Nathan served with him as Warden of the Great Synagogue (the Rothschildsrelationship to the Jews will be discussed later on in this article). Hannah’ssister, Judith, married the powerful Jewish Freemason Moses Montefiore (theMontefiore’s were of \"ancient\" and extremely ‘aristocratic Jewish stock’,probably another Cabalistic family), who was friends with Nathan (Nathan’ssister Henrietta married a Montefiore, so did his second son, Anthony, and hisbrother, Salomon’s great grandson, Aiphonse married a Sebag-Montefiore in 1911).Nathan’s social life revolved around the Cohens. Nathan was a Freemason. He wasa member of London’s Lodge of Emulation. Nathan’s accumulation of wealth wasincredible. His money-making exploits were unbelievable. He was smugglingEnglish goods past the French blockade during the Napoleonic conflict, andmaking great profits. This smuggling required an agent in Paris, so Mayer,through his Dalberg connections, got his son James a passport and James went tolive in Paris. A large amount of the Landgrave’s money was sent to Nathan inEngland, on the advice of Buderus, for the purpose of buying stock. But Nathan,as he and Buderus had planned, used the money as capitol for other ventures.When the exiled Landgrave began asking for a proof-of-purchase, Buderus and theRothschild brothers had to come up with all sorts of excuses to protect Nathan’sthievery. Eventually the Landgrave demanded to see receipts, so Nathan quicklybought some stock (the Landgrave had told him to buy the stocks at 72, but theirprice when he ended up buying them was 62, Nathan pocketed the savings) and theysnuck the receipts through the French blockade to the exiled Prince. TheLandgrave was satisfied, he had no idea what had really been done with hismoney. Nathan began making connections in the British government. Probably hisgreatest early connection was to the Treasury official John Herries. Herriesaided Nathan’s rise to power in every way possible. He became an intimate friendor Nathan’s and eventually a proxy for Rothschild in the British government.Their dealings were kept secret and the public had no idea as to the enormity ofNathan’s power. The most incredible example of Nathan’s devious schemes is a jobhe would later describe as the best business he had ever done. Through Nathan’sconnections in the treasury he learned of the plight of the English army inSpain. The Duke of Wellington (soon to become Nathan’s friend) had Britishtroops in Spain ready to attack France, only they lacked one thing - hard cash(the army’s financiers would not take paper money), but the government was veryshort on gold at the time. Nathan knew how to profit from this situation. TheEast India Company was trying to sell gold that, of course, the governmentwanted to buy, but the price was so high that officials decided to wait until itdropped. Nathan stepped in and bought up the gold (using some of the Landgravesmoney as well as his own). He then proceeded to raise the price. When theofficials realized the price wouldn’t drop they bought the gold and Nathan madea great profit. But the deal didn’t stop there. Nathan offered to deliver thegold to Wellington (this was a heavy responsibility because of the Frenchblockade). Hemes went to bat and got Rothschild the job. Nathan’s plan wasincredible; one biographer said his scheme was ‘comparable to burglary in broaddaylight.’ Nathan’s brother, James went to Napoleon’s government and told themthat Nathan would be importing gold into France and that the British governmentwas upset at the move because it would financially hurt England. Napoleon’sgovernment believed his lie and any French police who might have uncovered theplot were bribed. So Nathan was able to ship the gold to Paris with the approvalof both the English and French governments. In Paris the gold was exchanged inFrench banking firms for cash Wellington could use, and then the Rothschildnetwork carried the money into Spain as France allowed Nathan to fund the waragainst itself. Eventually some French officials grew suspicious, but Napoleonignored their reports (why?). The plan went smoothly even though the sameofficials secretly watched James Rothschild and his brother Carl (who was in onthe plot). Wellington eventually defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. The Wellingtonsmuggle was one of the greatest scams in history! In order to better understandthe Rothschild’s involvement in the defeat of Napoleon we must look at the roleplayed by the Rothschild’s second steppingstone - Metternich. Metternich was theAustrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and he led the opposition against Napoleon.Metternich was a fierce enemy of the revolutionary fires that were spreadingthrough Europe. The Rothschild’s got to him through a member of the firstTugendbund (the sexual one), Frederick von Gentz. Gentz was Metternich’sright-hand man. Metternich was not financially minded and he relied on Gentz’sadvice concerning economics (Gentz’s ability to handle his private finances wasterrible, but he had a knack for political economy). John Herries brought Gentzand the Rothschilds together. The family proceeded to bribe the man into theirservice. Gentz is an interesting character. He was a Freemason so he wasprobably occultic. His involvement in the first Tugendbund League points toImmorality. Another interesting fact is that I found most of his visits to theRothschilds occurred on occultic holidays, such as Winter Solstice. This may bea coincidence, but it is interesting nonetheless. Gentz called the Rothschilds“a special species planetarium with its own characteristics.” Gentz steadilybrought Metternich into the Rothschild’s web. By at least 1814 Metternich was anally of the House of Rothschild. His goal was to protect the power of the oldaristocracy. His plan was simply to extinguish revolution, and he began withNapoleon. Austria declared war on France and allied itself with Russia. Englandjoined them to form a powerful coalition against Napoleon. The battle ofWaterloo in 1815 decided the war. Metternich had led Europe to victory with thehelp of Nathan’s delivery network which funded the overthrow. The victory madeMetternich the most powerful man in Europe. Due to his speedy courier system,Nathan knew of the outcome of the Waterloo battle before the news reached anyother Englander. A persistent myth is that he made the bulk of his fortune bymanipulating the stock exchange with this knowledge. First of all, he didmanipulate the market, but he already had a fortune, this only added to It.Second of all, he might not have even made a significant profit (the issue iscomplicated and debatable. I will not go into it). Two years before his defeat,Napoleon had pulled out of Germany. In 1813 the Landgrave William ofHesse-Cassel returned to his province. Said one biographer: ‘Earlier it had beenthe Rothschilds who had asked for favors, now it was the (Landgrave] and Buderuswho tried to maintain a close connection.’ In 1818 Buderus died. By 1815 Nathancontrolled England’s finance. He did a large amount of direct business with theEnglish treasury. John Hemes was allowing deals that would hurt England but fillthe pockets of the House of Rothschild. The following quote by one of Nathan’scontemporaries describes his eerie countenance: “Eyes are usually called windowsof the soul. But in Rothschild’s case you would conclude that the windows arefalse ones, or that there was no soul to look out them. There comes not onepencil of light from the interior, neither is there any gleam of that whichcomes from without reflected in any direction. The whole puts you in mind of anempty skin, and you wonder why it stands upright without at least something init. By and by another figure comes up to it. It then steps two paces aside, andthe most inquisitive glance that you ever saw, and a glance more inquisitivethan you would have thought of, is drawn out of the fixed and leaden eyes, as ifone were drawing a sword from a scabbard...”This description is disturbingly similar to either MPD [multiple personalitydisorder] or demonic possession. A Prussian official said that Rothschild had“an incredible influence upon all financial affairs here in London. It is widelystated ... that he entirely regulates the rate of exchange in the City. Hispower as a banker is enormous.” ‘When Nathan ... (made] a fuss, the Bank ofEngland trembled.” Once he tried to cash a check from his brother Amschel at theBank, but the Bank refused saying it cashed only its own notes. Nathan’svolcano-like temper exploded. The next morning he and nine of his clerks arrivedat the Bank and began exchanging bank notes for gold. In one day he had reducedthe Bank’s gold reserves by a substantial amount. The next day he and his clerksarrived with more bank notes. A Bank executive nervously asked how long heintended to keep this up. Nathan replied something to the effect of “The Bank ofEngland refused to take by bills, so I will not keep theirs.” A meeting wasquickly called and they decided that from then on the Bank of England would bepleased to cash any Rothschild check Nathan’s firm was named N.M. Rothschild andSons. The firm met in the New Court building and for the sake of brevity will bereferred to as New Court. New Court was so powerful that it even became a goldbroker for the Bank of England (whose price I believe they still fix at will,though I may be wrong). He also founded the Alliance Insurance Company inEngland. The Illuminati has the Luciferian belief system that one’s evil actsmust be balanced by one’s good acts. This belief system has led to thephilanthropy of the truly evil elite (although much of this “charity\" money goesto fund their objectives). Nathan hated the common masses but his duty called.“Almoners, particularly those acting on behalf of the poor Jews of London,reported that they got thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of pounds out ofRothschild, but hardly a word and never a courtesy.” Nathan did not enjoycharity. He was good friends with Thomas Buxton, the anti-slavery leader. Thefamous musicians Mendelssohn and Rossini taught his daughter to play the harp.When Mayer died in 1812, his oldest son Amschel took over the Frankfort firm.Although Amschel was not the head of the family, he was its spokesman to thearistocracy. He was the one who would apply for the honors and titles for hisbrothers. He has been described as a crotchety worrier who clung to the past. Hewas socially odd, yet held great dinners that were the talk of the elite.Religion was a big part of his life, to the point of being called “monkish.\"Even though he lived on a grand scale Amschel had no joy. Much of this distresscame from the fact that he had failed to have any children. After Napoleonexited Germany a German Confederation was set up, of which Amschel became thetreasurer. In a sense this made him the first finance minister of the PrussianEmpire which was created by the Confederation. Amschel’s sorrow over his lack ofchildren led him to pick prominent young men to treat as his sons. One such manwas Otto von Bismark, who would later become the Iron Chancellor of Germany.Amschel was the protector of his mother Gutle, who was the Matriarch of thefamily. No one could receive full admission into the House of Rothschild bymarriage unless she approved. Gutie smiled little and had a harsh tongue. Onelegend has it that a neighbor asked her whether there was to be peace or war.“War?\" Gutle replied. \"Nonsense. My boys won’t let them.\"Saloman was the second oldest son of Mayer. Along with the other brothers he wasconstantly travelling through Europe. What separated him from his brothers washis gift of diplomacy. He was more stately and complimentary than the others.Said one banker of Salomon: \"Nobody leaves him without being comforted.\" inother words he knew how to kiss up. It was this fact that led the brothers tosend him to Vienna, Austria to establish a relationship with the painfullyaristocratic Hapsburgs and with vain Metternich. Although the Rothschilds hadattempted to enter a close business relationship with the Hapsburgs and Austria,the Austrian royalty kept putting them off. Then Salomon came along. He rode inon a wave of new found Rothschild power. Their name had become famous. Oneperson described it as the \"two magic syllables.\" The brothers had become, asone biographer put it, \"the Archdemons of Progress.\" Salomon began to vie forAustrian ties through Gentz and Metternich. Eventually Salomon’s diplomacy,Metternich’s lobbying, and the below-cost method earlier used on the Landgravebroke down the wall between the House of Rothschild and the IlluminatiHapsburgs. Austria began to employ the Rothschilds on a regular basis. Salomonmoved into Vienna and bought a Hotel and a house. Salomon knew how to playMetternich like a piano. He knew the right thing to say at the right time. Heknew Metternich’s quirks and prejudices, such as his vanity which Salomon easilymanipulated. Pretty soon Metternich and Salomon became close friends. The samegoes for Metternich’s right-hand man, Gentz. Gentz and Salomon were\"inseparable.\" Salomon was also a Freemason. It came to the point where Austriabecame so controlled by the Rothschilds that the government did not want torefuse the brothers anything. In 1816 Amschel, Salomon, Carl, and James receiveda title of nobility from the Hapsburgs.In 1818 the Aix-la-Chapelle Congress met to discuss the future of Europe.Salomon, Carl, Metternich, and Gentz all attended this Congress. It was herethat Metternich first met the Rothschilds. Gentz kept the minutes of theCongress, he was called the \"Secretary of Europe.\" A Rothschild scheme at thisCongress totally shook the financial institutions of Europe, there was nodenying the power of the Rothschilds. \"The divine right of kings had beenoverthrown by the divine right of money..\" At Aix-la-Chapelle the Rothschildswidened their circle of influence in the Illuminati. Salomon set up a new firmin Vienna. He financially supported Metternich’s fight against revolution.Metternich had established the \"Vienna System\" which controlled Europe afterNapoleon’s defeat. The Austrian leader began doing what the elite love to do -sending \"peacekeeping\" troops into conflicts. 1814-1848 has been described as\"The Age of Metternich\", but since the Rothschilds financed and controlled himit would be more accurate to call it \"The Age of the House of Rothschild.\" TheOrder of Vladimir was conferred upon Salomon for his work with Russia.Gioacchino Rossini, the Italian opera composer who wrote Cinderella and theWilliam Tell overture became a good friend of both Salomon and his brotherJames. In 1822, he, Metternich, Gentz, James, and Cari attended the VeronaCongress. This Congress was totally manipulated by the Rothschilds. Theyprofited immensely by its outcome. Salomon financed the first important CentralEuropean railways. The Austrians began saying that they had an Emperor Ferdinandand a King Salomon. When it came to Austrian finances Salomon got the last word.The people would show up at his office and beg for a royal \"laying on of hands.\"He only had to touch a bond or a stock, and its owner went away certain of itsrise. Uke the other Rothschilds he gave immense charity donations. He bought thehuge coal and iron works of Vitkovitz. In 1843 he received permission topurchase inheritable agricultural real estate (many people were against Jewsbuying private property), and he proceeded to buy up large amounts of land. Heobtained the lease of Austria’s mercury mines. This and the only other mercurydeposit in Spain were controlled by the Rothschilds, creating a world monopolyon a key metal. Salomon was incredibly powerful.The next son, Carl, was the family’s chief courier. He was the least intelligentof all the brothers. He was awkward when he spoke and he had a nasty temper. Onebiographer described him as \"punchy\". In 1821 Carl was sent to Naples, Italy tooversee loans there that were meant to finance Metternich’s forces who hadarrived to quell a rebellion. While in Italy the Rothschild \"mantle\" came uponCarl and he made a series of ingenious deals with the Italian government thatforced Naples to pay for its own occupation. He also helped Luigi de Medici ofthe Black Nobility to re-gain his position as finance minister of Naples, andlater did business with the powerful man. Due to his success it was decided thathe would stay in Naples and set up his own bank. He became financier to thecourt, the \"financial overlord of Italy.\" Carl \"...wound the Italian peninsulaaround his hand.\" He did business with the Vatican, and when Pope Gregory XVIreceived him by giving him his hand rather than the customary toe to kiss,people realized the extent of his power. The Pope conferred upon him the Orderof St. George.It appears that in Italy Carl became a leader of Carbonarism. After the BavarianIllumInati was exposed, Carbonarism (or the Alta Vendita) became the majorEuropean occult power. Carl’s leadership in this group is very significant. In1818 a secret Alta Vendita document, that Cari had participated in preparing,was sent to the headquarters of Masonry. A copy of this document was lost, andthe Masons got very upset and offered rewards for the return of this copy. Thetitle of the document translates \"Permanent Instructions, or Practical Code ofRules; Guide for the Heads of the Highest Grades of Freemasonry.\"Last, but absolutely not least, was the youngest son, James. During theNapoleonic conflict James had spent his time between London and Paris,supporting the Rothschild’s network of illegal trade with England. After theWellington smuggle and the defeat of Napoleon, James became an establishedfigure in France. He founded a bank there and began the French branch of theRothschild family. James was a 33 degree Scottish Rite Mason. At this time theFrench House was the center of operations for the Rothschilds. Even thoughsuccessive revolutions would de-throne ruler after ruler, Rothschild power keptthe family in control. James was good friends with the leading minister of theBourbon court, Count de Villele, and he \"owned\" King Louis Philippe. He alsosecretly funded Spanish revolutionaries (his agent in Madrid was MonsieurBelin). James yearned for social status. The pursuit of which was second only tomoney. He had grown so powerful that the French exchange was deeply affected byall his decisions. Like his brother, Salomon, he pioneered the railroad businessin France. He also bought the great Lafite vineyards. His bank, de RothschildFreres was in a league all its own. No one in France could even wish to be aspowerful as James. As Salomon had, James received the Order of Vladimir for hiswork with the Russian dynasty. He also became a member of the Societe deAntiquites. In the Rothschild tradition (as constituted by Mayer’s Will) oftrying to keep everything within the family James married his niece, BettyRothschild, the daughter of Salomon. The Rothschilds main advantage was theirincredible courier system. It kept the five Houses connected. In fact, theHapsburgs used this system quite often. All evidence points to the Rothschildbrothers being very powerful within Freemasonry. They were one of the leadingfamilies in occultism at that time in Europe. Many prominent Masons of their daypraised the brothers. In 1820, due to Metternich’s lobbying, Nathan was madeAustrian consul in London, and two years later he was made consul-general. Jameswas also made an Austrian consul in Paris. Metternich’s promptings also providedsomething else very important to the family; in 1822 all the brothers and theirdescendants of either sex were made Barons. This established social position forthe Rothschilds. The Gentz-Metternich team was very beneficial to the House ofRothschild. By this time a few papers had run some upsetting articles about thefamily. Salomon asked Gentz to censure any more unkind reports and he alsocommissioned the Illuminist to write a bogus biography on the family that wouldportray them in a good light. Gentz, now called the \"Pen of Europe\", proceededto write legends for the Rothschilds, and the family fully encouraged thepropaganda in their social circles. The brothers had a system (based on Mayer’sWill) where only family members were partners or owners of the banks. Thissystem is still in use today. The Rothschild banks bought everything up, frommining corporations to national debts. For instance, New Court has beencontrolling Brazil’s debts since 1824. In 1836 Nathan Rothschild, head of theHouse of Rothschild, died (he may have been poisoned). The headship was passedon to his younger brother, James, by a vote of all the brothers. In 1830 thesigns of masonic-fueled revolution began to appear again. Metternich’s \"peace ofthe world\" (they always call imperialism “peace\") was being threatened. A newking was set up in France, the House of Orange was dethroned in the Netherlands.The fires of revolution were spreading through the masonic network andMetternich began to lose his grip on Europe.The Revolution of 1848 in France dethroned yet another royal house. James wentalong with the masonic agenda and financed this revolution, even though he was afriend of the court. The revolution marked the end of Metternich’s \"Age\" andthat same year insurrectors chased him and Salomon out of Austria. Neitherreturned, but a Vienna House had already been established, others would carry iton, under the direction of Salomon’s son, Anselm. Metternich’s descendants arestill close to the House of Rothschild. After this the power of the Rothschildsweakened. By 1855 all five brothers were dead except James. Napoleon III was nowin power in France and his advisors were the enemies of James. But Rothschildingenuity came through again when James got Napoleon Ill to marry a Rothschildagent. James died in I 868 and the family headship went to Alphonse, his son.\"The New Trinity\"Three cousins now ran the show - Alphonse of the French House, Lionel of theEnglish House and Anselm of the Vienna House - \"the new trinity\". The threebanded together to destroy an enemy bank, French Credit Mobilier. Anselm set upa new firm, Creditanstalt in Vienna to combat the French bank. With the help ofLionel and Alphonse he attacked Credit Mobilier until it collapsed. The new headof the House of Rothschild was Baron Alphonse de Rothschild. Alphonse was asuave, socially elite man. After the trial of France’s Credit Mobilier Napoleon,he stepped onto the Rothschild bandwagon. Alphonse was powerful; he had \"access\"to men like Napoleon III and Bismark of Prussia. The Illuminati decided to getrid of Napoleon Ill, so English Prime Minister Gladstone (friend of theRothschilds) set things up so that Prussia and France would go to war. Napoleonill proceeded to attack Prussia and Bismark responded in a furry, defeatingFrance and banishing Napoleon III from the throne. The war indemnities were paidto Bismark (who had a dislike for Alphonse, despite his connections to thefamily) through the Rothschilds. Alphonse’s brother, Edmond, was the one whohelped create Israel (this will be discussed further on in the article).Alphonse married another Rothschild, but his love for her was not very strong.The Comtesse de Castiglione was a beautiful woman who was a “Marilyn Monroe” ofher day. She was the mistress of Alphonse, his brother Gustave Rothschild (whosedaughter married a Sassoon), and Napoleon III. Anselm Rothschild of the ViennaHouse was a shrewd playboy. He destroyed Credit Mobilier with Creditanstalt, andin 1861 he became a member of the Austrian Imperial House of Lords. Anselm hadmany mistresses and his wife left him because of his adultery. He died in 1874.Lionel Rothschild of the English House inherited New Court. He financedEngland’s Crimean War, Cecil Rhodes’ South African kingdom, vast copper andnitrate mines, and the purchase of the Suez Canal. Lionel’s younger brother,Anthony was knighted by the Queen. Another brother, Nathaniel, bought therenowned Mouton vineyards near Bordeaux. Lionel was a good friend of PrimeMinisters Disraeli (who was controlled by Rothschild money) and Gladstone. Healso probably paid for Lord John Russell’s election as Prime Minister. LordTennyson (whose poems are used in programming) attended his house parties.Lionel has been described as \"grouchy\" and \"crotchety.\" In 1858, Lionel becamethe first Jew in House of Commons. After eleven tries, the British Parliamentgave in and allowed Rothschild to take his seat. Not a single significantpolitical move by Lionel was recorded during his stay in Parliament. He was amember for 15 years. in 1879 he died. After Amschel of the House of Frankfortdied without an heir, two of Carl of Italy’s sons came to take over thebusiness. But they also remained heirless, bearing only daughters. When the lastbrother died in 1901, the Frankfort bank was liquidated (I believe they did nottry to continue the original bank because they knew that Germany was about to becaught up in the turmoil of the world wars, they eventually set up anotherFrankfort bank after Germany’s turmoil). The House of Italy ended the same way.The one son of Carl who had stayed in Naples produced only daughters, and whenGeribaldi’s Red Shirts unified Italy this remaining son (out of character for aRothschild) chose not to accommodate the new powers and moved to France. Thusended the Italian branch.Rothschild Influence in AmericaThis subject is so massive that it will only be touched on. In 1837 AugustBelmont came to the U.S., during the Panic of 1837. August Belmont appears tohave been a Rothschild proxy. Belmont bought up government bonds in this Panicand his success eventually led him to the White House where he became the\"financial advisor to the President of the United States\". His policies helpedpit the North against the South for the Civil War. Judah P. Benjamin, whoaccording to A. Ralph Epperson was the Civil War campaign strategist for theHouse of Rothschild held many key positions in the Confederacy. He wasapparently connected to John Wilkes Booth. J.P. Morgan has been called aRothschild agent. His father was one of the many elite who made their fortunesby shipping supplies past the North’s blockade and into the Confederacy. J.P.was a major supporter of an American central bank (Interestingly enough, he isreported to be related to Alexander Hamilton). In 1869, J.P. Morgan went to theHouse of England and formed Northern Securities as an agent for New Court in theU.S. Then, in 1907 J.P. Morgan shuttled back and forth between London and Paris,presumably getting orders from the Rothschilds. He returned to America andinstigated the Panic of 1907, which led to the “need\" for a central bank.Another man who appears to be connected to the Rothschilds was Thomas House, whoalso made his fortune slipping supplies past the North and into the South. Hisson, Lionel Edward M. House was one of the main Illuminati figures to controlAmerica during the early 20th Century.Some of the Bauer line of the Rothschild family moved to America and took upimportant positions in the hierarchy’s network.The House of Rothschild and IsraelThe Rothschild relationship to the Jews is deceiving. The family stance ispublicized as \"pro-Jewish\", and they have given abundant charity to Jewishcauses. But their support of the Jewish race has, in most cases, been used forthe sole purpose of controlling the direction and profiting from the Jews. TheRothschilds have been described as the royal family of the Jews. Many leadingRothschilds have been dubbed \"King of the Jews\". But what kind of Judaism do theRothschilds support? Do they support the orthodox Jews who believe in the OldTestament and are waiting for the return of the messiah? No. Do they supportMessianic Jews who believe Jesus Christ was the messiah who came to save allmen? No. The Rothschilds support those Jews who have fallen prey to thedeceptive gnostic and occultic teachings of Cabalism, and in turn support theIlluminati controlled Zionist movement. Not all Zionists are part of theconspiracy, but their leaders are, and the ultimate leaders of the Zionists havebeen the Rothschilds. I am disappointed by some researchers, who automaticallycoin the conspiracy a “Jewish\" one. This unfortunate stumbling block haspolluted their work, making it just as misleading as the information put out bythe popular media. These researchers seem blinded by the fact that theconspiracy has abused and manipulated the Jewish race more than any other groupin the history of the world. The hierarchy of the Jews has sat back and allowedthe attack on, and control of the Jewish masses for the furtherance of Satan’sagenda. I am saying this to let you see that I am not anti-Semitic. I believethat there are people who call themselves \"Christians\" who are part of theconspiracy; at the same token there are people who call themselves \"Jews\" whoare part of the conspiracy. To call the conspiracy \"Jewish\" is ignorant. Ibelieve the Rothschilds to have been involved in Cabalism, Jewish Sabbatism, orFrankism, all of which are involved in witchcraft. This belief is strengthenedby the Rothschild’s use of the occultic Seal of Solomon as a family symbol. Thecity in which the Rothschilds originated, Frankfort, was deeply anti-Semitic.The Rothschilds were constantly striving to overcome the boundaries put on thembecause of their culture. It is very likely this berthed a bitterness in theirhearts towards \"Christian\" society. This bitterness, and the need to facilitatemore profit and power were most likely the reasons why they excepted the idea ofa Jewish state. (I will assume that the readers understand that the Zionism /restoration of Israel concept is an unbiblical sham.)The following quote will help you understand the Rothschild attitude towards theJews. “... the first principle of the House of Rothschild was to amass wealth,[and] the liberation of the [Jewish] race from oppressive restrictionscontributed Indirectly to this end, since it would facilitate intercourse withthe rest of the world, and thereby increase the possibility of financial gain,which in turn would serve to increase its power.\" (The Rise of The House ofRothschild by Count Egon Corti, p. 124-125) Amschel of the Frankfort House wasconstantly harassed by anti-Semites. As a result \"He became the grand almonerand grand protector to the German Jews; he helped sweep away the chains of JewStreet; he pressed, in the end successfully, for the Jews’ enfranchisement asfree citizens of Frankfort.\" One of the main Rothschild agents used to promotethe emancipation of the Jews in Frankfort was Frederick von Gentz, the evil \"Penof Europe.\" At this point I must clarify something for the reader. There arethree Baron Edmond Rothschilds, and all three have been involved with the nationof Israel. To avoid confusion I will number them: 1. Baron Edmond de Rothschild -(1845-1934) House of France. Son of James and brother of Alphonse. 2. Baron Edmund \"Eddie\" L de Rothschild - (1916- ) House of England. Son of Uonei Nathan and great, great grandson of the infamous Nathan Rothschild. 3. Baron Edmond de Rothschild -(1926. ) House of France. Son of Maurice and grandson of #1 Edmond.The story begins with #1 Edmond, the \"Father of Israel\". During the Crimean War(which was funded by the Rothschilds) the small Jewish community in Jerusalembecame cut off from all outside support. This resulted in \"semi-starvation\". #1Edmond’s father, James, set up the James Mayer de Rothschild Hospital inJerusalem in response to this problem. #1 Edmond picked up his father’s interestin Palestine. When the Russian Jews fled the Czar’s pogroms in the 1880’s Edmondbegan to finance the Russian Jew’s attempts to establish colonies in Palestine,It is clear that #1 Edmond was a fan of Zionism, his charities were not onlyaiding the persecuted but were promoting the concept of a return the \"homeland\".\"The Baron’s money drained swamps, dug wells and built houses. It foundedindustries ranging from scent factories to glass works, form wine cellars tobottle manufacturers. The Baron established his own administration in Palestineand his overseers dictated to the farmers exactly what crops were to be grownand where.\" The man who set up the first Zionist Congress was Theodor Herzl. Heattempted to get the support for his plans to \"restore the Jewish state\" fromthe Rothschilds but many members of the family were opposed to Zionism (theRothschilds supported those causes which they could profit from and theIntegration of Jews into the European culture was profitable for them. OneRothschild told Herzl he was an Englishman and proposed to remain one. #1 Edmondon the other hand. was leading a Rothschild plan similar to Herzl’s that slowlycreated a Jewish state controlled by the family). #1 Edmond did not opposeZionism, in fact he supported Herzl’s cause, yet he felt Herzl’s plans shouldnot be implemented so soon (they were \"to be accomplished quietly, stealthily,not by shouting from the roof-tops\"), plus he was concerned that Herzl wouldtake away too much Rothschild power over the slowly forming Jewish state. TheBaron continued to support his own colonies and though Herzl was sociallysupported, because his Ideas facilitated Rothschild power in Palestine, he wasnot allowed to implement his plans. #1 Edmond did not want Herzl in control.Later, after Herzl had died and was no longer a threat, #1 Edmond \"admitted\"that Herzl had been right, and went right on pouring money into the Jewish\"Homeland\". #1 Edmond had a tight-fisted control of the colonies. “... the Baronwas a dictator who expected the colonists to obey him unquestionably.\" In 1901the Jews in Palestine sent a delegation to the Baron who told him “... if youwish to save the Yishuv [the -83 Jewish settlement] first take your hands fromIt, and ... for once permit the colonists to have the possibility of correctingfor themselves whatever needs correcting ...\" This upset the Baron. He replied:\"I created the Yishuv, I alone. Therefore no men, neither colonists nororganizations, have the right to interfere in my plans.\" Herzl was succeeded asPresident of World Zionism by David Wolffsohn. Wolffsohn got the full support ofthe Baron. Wolffsohn’s successor was Otto Warburg. Another prominent leader ofthe Zionists was Chalm Weizmann. Weizmann was on better terms with #1 Edmondthan his predecessor, Herzl. He made this observation of the Baron after theirfirst visit. \"In manner be could be both gracious and brutal; and this was thereflex of his split personality; for on the one hand he was conscious of hispower and arrogant in the possession of it; on the other hand he was ratherfrightened by it, and this gave him a touch of furtiveness.\" The BaronRothschild told Weizmann be would finance a Hebrew University in Palestine. WithWeizmann’s appearance on the scene the Baron became closer to Zionism.In 1914 #1 Edmond traveled to Palestine. \"Edmond could scarcely believe hiseyes. Tel Aviv had become a city and his miserable windswept colonies had beentransformed into lush gardens...\" His journey to Palestine was hailed as the\"prince returning to his people\". Later the Baron Rothschild told Weizmann:\"Without me Zionism would not have succeeded, but without Zionism my work wouldhave been struck to death.\" Another Rothschild embraced Zionism through Weizmann- Lionel Walter, the second Lord Rothschild (apparently this upset somerelations). The Balfour declaration, which declared England’s support of thecreation of a Jewish homeland, was addressed to Lord Rothschild II. LordRothschild also received the documents of support from the League of Nations.Charles T. Russell sent a letter to Lord Rothschild that praised him for hiswork towards a Jewish homeland. After World War I Britain ruled Palestine, andthe Rothschilds ruled Britain. Also, a bulk of unpaid debts to the Rothschildsby the failed Ottoman Empire gave the family more control over Palestine. Thencame Hitler. According to Walter Langer, a psychoanalyst who wrote the book TheMind of Adolf Hitler, the demonic German leader was a grandson of a Rothschild.“Adolf’s father, AIls Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Maria AnnaSchicklgruber. It was generally supposed that the father of Alols Hitler wasJohann Georg Hiedler.... \" There are some people who seriously doubt that JohannGeorg Hiedler was the father of Alois.. An Austrian document was supposedlyprepared that proved Maria Anna Schicklgruber was living in Vienna at the timeshe conceived. \"At that time she was employed as a servant in the home of [a]Baron Rothschild. As soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sentback to her home ... where Alois was born.\" It is believed that Hitler (who wastotally created by Satan’s Empire) attacked Austria first, in order to destroythe Austrian records that proved his Jewish ancestry. As Hitler’s demonic attackon the Jews progressed, one would imagine that the Zionists would come to therescue and offer Palestine as a safe haven. Not so. Many European countries shuttheir doors to the Jews, including the Palestine colonies. The Zionistcontrolled immigration laws in Palestine were very strict and it was nearimpossible to escape to the Jewish homeland. In fact, the Zionists refused toadmit there was a Holocaust going on although evidence points to them knowing! Isuppose in their minds it was ok to sacrifice a great number of Jewish lives inorder to promote the idea of a Jewish state. To the elite the Holocaust was likeshooting dead a herd of cattle to receive the insurance payment. Said MichaelSeizer in his book. Zionism Reconsidered: \"Not even the events of 1933 arousedtheir [Zionism’s] political interest. They were naive enough to see them as aGod-sent opportunity for an undreamt of wave of immigration to Palestine. Whenthe Zionist Organization against the natural impulses of the whole Jewishpeople, decided to do business with Hider, to trade German goods against thewealth of German Jewry, to flood the Palestine market with German products andthus make a mockery of the boycott against German-made articles, they foundlittle opposition in the Jewish National Homeland, and least of all among itsaristocracy - the so-called Kibutniks.\" Hitler forced the Jews to wear thesix-pointed star as a sign of shame. It was this same symbol that theRothschilds were named after and the same symbol that the Zionists promoted as asymbol of Jewish national identity. Do you see the contradiction? Said Jewishauthor O.J. Graham in The Six-Pointed Star: \"Not all the concentration campvictims were Jewish people. Many were Christians. Spiritually, a parallel can beseen in the rituals to Ashteroth and Moloch, where the victims were burned assacrifices to these false gods. Were the victims of the Nazis someone’ssacrificial offerings?\" I believe they were. Remember the six-pointed star wasthe symbol of Moloch and Ashteroth. Unfortunately, few Jews will tolerate adiscussion of this subject. After World War II, the U.N., spurred on by theIlluminati created horrors against the Jews, panted Israel its statehood.Weizmann was the first president of Israel’s Knesset (which was built withRothschild money). The occultic hexagram is on the Knesset, and is alsodisplayed on the Jewish flag. \"...the six-pointed star [had] made its way fromEgyptian pagan rituals of worship, to the goddess Ashteroth and Moloch, to KingSolomon when he went into idolatry,\" say, Graham. \"Then it progressed throughthe magic arts, witchcraft [including Arab magicians, Druids, witches andSatanists], astrology (in which It was no new thing), through the Cabala toIsaac Luria, a Cabalist, in the 16th century, to Mayer Amschel Bauer, whochanged his name to this symbol, to Zionism, to the Knesset of the new State ofIsrael, to the flag of Israel and Its medical organization equivalent to the RedCross.\" What is the ultimate goal of Zionism? David Ben-Gurion, a Zionistleader, tells us: \"With the exception of the U.S.S.R. as a federated Eurasianstate, all other continents will become united in a world alliance, at whosedisposal will be an International police force. All armies will be abolished,and there will be no more wars. In Jerusalem, the United Nations (a truly UnitedNations) will build a Shrine of the Prophets to serve this federated union ofall continents; this will be the seat of the Supreme Court of Mankind, to settleall controversies among the federated continents.\" Simply stated, Zionism (withRothschild support) promotes a New World Order. The Rothschild control of Israelis Immense. #1 Edmond established Trusts that make massive donations to Israel.Biographer Virginia Cowles explains: \"Originally the principle Trust was knownas Pica - Palestine Jewish Colonization Association - but when it became clear,after the establishment of the State of Israel, that colonization would behandled by the Government, Its functions were changed. Edmond’s son, James,renamed it “Hanadiv” the Hebrew word for “benefactor” by which his father wasknown throughout Palestine; and at the same time rechanneled the Trust’s fundsto the promotion of education, science and culture. When James died in 1957 hiswidow, Dollie, assumed the presidency which she still holds. For many years shehas been powerfully assisted by Lord [Victor] Rothschild, and recently she hasenlisted the help of the latter’s son, [Lord] Jacob. The Trust knows noboundaries. In the 1960s it carried out James’ wishes by providing money for theKnesset, the new Parliament building in Jerusalem. Today its beneficiaries rangefrom universities, hospitals and public libraries to archaeological digs; fromthe board of the Weizmann Scientific Institute to the organizers ofInstructional Television.\"#2 Edmund is the most \"race-conscious\" of all the Rothschilds. He is on theboard of much Jewish philanthropies - including president of the Association ofJewish Ex-Servicemen and Women, joint treasurer of the Council of Christians andJews and treasurer of the Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1967he sent a letter to THE TIMES magazine suggesting Great Britain, Russia, and theU.S. all chip in and build de-salinization plants for Israel so that the desertcould be turned into a lush garden, with plenty of food and nothing to fightover (I have found that #2 Edmund loves to come up with cockamamie scientificsuggestions towards the solution of world problems. For example, in an addressto the organizers of the U.N.’s Earth Summit, he suggested building massivedry-ice machines on the polar capes to prevent their melting in the face ofglobal warming). #2 Edmund is also a warden of the Great Synagogue in London. Heis the senior member of New Court in London and is a member of the Illuminati’sPilgrim Society. #3 Edmond is an entrepreneur. He is very involved in tourism,and has funded many luxury resorts in Israel. He controls Compagnie Financlere,which is his holding company in France. He owns Banque Privee in Switzerland,and a merchant bank in Paris. He controls the largest toy company and thelargest frozen food company in France. He is a director of Belgium’s BanqueLambert, and of DeBeers Consolidated Mines in South Africa. He is on theSteering Committee of the Bilderbergers. And his interests extend into Israel,where he is the chairman of Tri-Continental Pipelines. Chairman of the IsraelCorporation, and chairman of Isrop, which controls the Israel General Bank. Thelist continues. #3 Edmond is on the board of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.He directs the Middle East Peace Institute, which he founded in 1967. Heregularly donates money to the Biological-Physio-Chemical Institute, which wasfounded by his grandfather, #1 Edmond. He sits on the boards of a dozen or sohospitals and scientific institutes. #3 Edmond is considered the richestRothschild. He has massive power, and this includes control of much of Israel.The Rothschilds have even had a street named in their honor. The FirstInternational Bank of Israel is located at 39 Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv.Bank Hapoalim, \"Israel’s fastest growing bank\", is next door at 50 RothschildBoulevard. The satanic Rothschilds simply dominate Israel. Apparently Israel hasserved as the meeting grounds for the French and English Rothschilds. The Frenchand English Houses contributed over $1 million to Israel around the time of theSix-Day War. It is reported that when Baron Alain of the French House visitedIsrael he \"burst into tears\" at the sight of the walling wall. Baroness Alix ofthe French House is the World President of Youth Aliyah, which deals with theemigration of Jewish children to Israel. Evelyn of the English House is chairmanof the Board of Governors of the Technion, Israel’s Institute of Technology. Thesatanic Rothschilds simply dominate Israel. The Rothschilds help Satan’s Empirecontrol the world’s resources, the world’s nations and the world’s religions.They are an institution in the conspiracy and, if one looks carefully, the pathof their destructive reign can be followed through the history of the past threecenturies.Bibliography: * Corti, Count Egon Caesar.

Tucson, AR.: Publius Press, 1985 Introduction to Part 2 of the Rothschilds Lenin said that the establishment of a central bank was 90% of communizing anation Lenin himself (and Trotsky) were required to place MI6 operatives in keypositions during the Russian Revolution and these operatives were in turncontrolled by the Satanic elite back in London, England. It is no secret thatthe Rothschilds play a major rode in International Bankers, and that variousRothschilds like Lord Victor Rothschild have played major roles in MI6. Imention these two items to drive home what should be an obvious conclusion, theRothschilds are major players in the control of the world and the New WorldOrder.There is so much activity on the part of the modern-day Rothschilds, that thecontrolled news media’s censorship which protects the Rothschilds have not beenable to screen out everything, there are still tidbits here and there thatfilter through the controlled media’s censorship. Still my search continues fordescendants of the Rothschilds who are willing to expose what the Rothschildsare all about. I have found a few. One who I have not had the opportunity tointerview yet, is the husband of Rebecca Brown. It is reported that RebeccaBrown’s husband was an Illuminatus of the Rothschild bloodline, and that heescaped them and has been attempting to do some exposure of their Satanicpractices. According to what I have been told, they wanted to skin him alive. Ihave unfortunately not been able to interview Rebecca Brown Yoder’s husband, whohas been called by the Lord to strengthen the end time church.Their Power Is ExtensivePeter Rupert Lord Carrington, who is the chairman of the Bilderbergers. has beenthe Rothschild’s director of their Rio Tinto Zinc Corp. He also is director ofBarclay’s Bank and part of the Trilateral Commission. Francois Mitterand, whohas led France, is an extremely close friend of the Rothschilds. I point thesetwo men out just to portray to the reader the extensive power the Rothschildswield behind the scenes.What they Call Their Bloodline in the IlluminatiDuring Illuminati ceremonies, when candidates are presented for approval at theSisters of Light and the Mothers of Darkness levels the bloodline of theRothschilds is actually called “the Rothschild bloodline.\" Although It wasoriginally went by the name “Bauer” (and many of the descendants today continueto be Bauers and Bowers), the name “Rothschild\" was the occult name that theBauers personally chose for their bloodline to be the power broker in LatinAmerica.One of my friends from South America got to personally witness the destructionof South America by Rothschild interests. One item that I am familiar with fromhistory, and which I can’t help thinking about is how the nation of Bolivia in1908 had the fine distinction of having absolutely no foreign debt. However, in1908 the Morgans of America loaned Bolivia money, and in 1917 Chandler & Co.loaned them $2.4 million. Thus began the plunge of a free nation into economicslavery to the Illuminati’s international Bankers. The point is that nationslike Bolivia, if left alone would have been far better off. People don’t realizethat the problems these \"banana republics\" have is to a large degree being causeby powerful outsiders like the Rothschilds. Who then direct organizations likethe IMF to “save\" these poor nations? When the Rothschilds set themselves up inBrazil, they set up to be there permanently. They came in during the 19thcentury. The Rothschilds and other British Interests played a major role inBrazil’s railway system, which became a law unto itself. Just as the secrethistory of the railway tycoons reveals a great deal about the secret elite inthe United States, so it also does in Brazil. Later Henry Kaiser and NelsonRockefeller moved into South America (incl. Brazil) to promote theircapitalistic visions. They promoted the light industrialization of Latin Americaand its economic interdependence in the 1950’s and 1960’s. The Scroll & KeySociety is one of the illuminati’s secret entry points at Yale University. TheScroll and Key Society financed a book by Elizabeth A. Cobbs entitled The RichNeighbor Policy: Rockefeller and Kaiser in Brazil. This book (Yale Univ., 1992,p. 248) states that Brazilians have looked to Rockefeller as their connection tothe United States. Other elite families besides the Rothschilds have alsosubstantial Latin American economic control, such as the DuPonts.The Bloodlines Are SecretOne of the principle points that should be borne in mind is that the actualoccult power of the Rothschild bloodline is hidden in secret lineages. Althoughthe Rothschilds make up part of the Rothschild bloodline, people should alsowatch out for names such as Bauer, Bowers, Sassoons, and many other last names.People within the illuminati who have Rothschild blood are aware of their secretancestry, but outsiders in the world are more often than not are never going tobe told that they carry such ,,powerful\" occult blood.Above The LawThe story of what happened to BankCal, which was the oldest bank in California,illustrates how powerful the Rothschilds are in the United States. (The detailsof this story come from the San Jose Calif Mercury News, Jan. 12. 1992. I wassomewhat surprised that the article appeared considering the strength of theRothschilds. Sometimes corruption at the top stinks so bad, that it can’t besuppressed entirely.) The United States has the Securities Exchange Commission(SEC) in place to protect the American public from stock fraud. During the1980’s there were three highly publicized cases of fraud that the SEC uncovered.These three cases created widespread confidence within the American public thatstock market trading was in general honestly traded. The story of what EdmondRothschild (full name is Edmond Adolphe Jules Jacques Maurice Baron deRothschild) did with BankCal expose to the world that men like the Rothschildsdo not have to play by the same rules as everyone else. They are literally abovethe law. The powerful Illuminati control the law. In 1973, the CEO of BankCal,De Bretteville sold Edmond Rothschild 300,000 shares of Bancal Tristate Corp.,22% of the holding company for the Bank of California. De Bretteville hadoriginally asked two English Rothschild cousins if they wanted to purchase thestock. These two cousins then called two French Rothschild cousins, who thencalled Edmond in Geneva, Switzerland for assistance. Edmond told them he wouldhelp them buy it, and that after he purchased it. he would turn around anddivide it with his relatives. He lied. And over the next few years, he wouldcontinue to lie to numerous people about his intents for the bank. DeBretteville says, \"He lied to his family and he lied to me, it was a dirty dealall around.\" Bank of California had the only banking franchise at the time whichwas in all three Pacific Rim states (OR, WA, CA). It turned out that the Bank ofCalifornia was like a piece of art to Rothschild. He had no Intention ofimproving the bank; he simply wanted it for his collection of companies. Edmondalready owned companies in Brazil, toy companies, 10% in De Beers mining in So.Africa, joint business ventures with Robert Vesco, and 30% of Club Mediterraneanwhich Edmond co-founded. Club Mediterranean was created out of the idea thatothers of the elite would enjoy seaside playgrounds like those he and his mothercavorted at when he was a youngster. Edmond went on to marry a chorus girl namedNadine. Actually, sources indicate that the Baron Edmond had wanted to give theBank of California to his only son. Bengie (Benjam in de Rothschild) as agraduation present. But Bengie who was going to Pepperdine University was moreinterested in partying. Bengie lived high on the hog at a fabulous Californiabeach house while flunking school and living wildly. Apparently, his fatherdecided his son wasn’t ready for a graduation present. In fact, he leftPepperdine Univ. after 4 years with 31 credits (97 short to graduate) and wentback home to Chateau Pregny on the shore of Lake Geneva near Geneva. Switz. Itwasn’t until 1989, that Benjamin stepped forward into the world of finance, bylaunching his La Compagnie de Tresorerie-Benjamin de Rothschild. The San JoseMercury. Jan. 12, 1992 reported, “The longtime chief executive of the bluebloodSan Francisco bank invited Rothschild to invest. Banking regulators encouragedRothschild to take charge. Securities investigators ignored the frenzy oftrading overseas, and later, the documentation of insider trading. The bank’sdirectors fawned while the baron used it as a personal plaything. “This is notwhat made this country great.\" says Bill Miles, a former BankCal vice president.\"This is greed, all the way through.\" Edmond Rothschild only purchased aminority of BankCal’s shares, but he was still able to totally control thecompany. He was also able to manipulate its stock prices and carry out insidertrading without the Securities and Exchange Commission watching it. Edmond namedtwo representatives to the board of directors. The first was George CoulonKarlweis, a patrician Swiss Banker who worked for Edmond. The other was GeorgeShapiro. a New York lawyer who knew nothing about banking. Edmond has calledGeorge Shapiro his \"godfather and his \"guardian angel.\" Then Edmond replaced DeBretteville as CEO with his man Chauncey Schmidt. Edmond had agreed to leaveDeBretteville in his position as a condition to purchase BankCal shares, butwhen he chose to renege on his agreement he did without compassion. Bank boardmeetings became a game of “What does Edmond think?\" Edmond on his part threwparties that enamored him to San Francisco’s high society. Edmond carried out aseries of actions which dropped the value of BankCal’s stock drastically.Financial advisors and securities analysts convinced small stockholders to selltheir BankCAl stock which they then did for rock bottom prices as little as $16a share. Rothschild bought some at that price. Some of Rothschild’s secretproxies paid slightly higher prices. Most of the stock went to anonymousinvestors trading through private banks protected by secrecy laws. Nearly 20% ofthe bank’s stock was sold by misled shareholders, and was sold to secretEuropean bank accounts. The Baron and his friends secretly began buying theBank’s stock after It had hit rock bottom prices. During 1979 to 1981 more than15% of Bank of California’s stock was sold in Europe. Such an abrupt shift in astock’s trading pattern is supposed to set off alarms with the Securities andExchange Commission. Instead the Securities and Exchange Commission turned ablind eye to all the insider trading. The European buyers bought their cheapstock as secretly as possible. They did not openly shop through Americanbrokerages. Instead, they bought small (and therefore. unremarkable) blocks ofstock through dozens of private banks in Switzerland, the Netherlands. Germany.Luxembourg. The Baron told his friends that he would sell BankCal, while hepublicly gave the appearance that the company was not for sale. For instance,publicly It was announced that David Rockefeller. as well as the elite’s frontman for BCCI Ghaith Pharaon had both talked with Edmond Rothschild about thepurchase of BankCal. According to what the public was led to believe. Rothschildsaid he would not sell his shares in the bank. Jean Marc Vemes, a buddy ofEdmond’s bought 310,000 shares through a defunct Asian mining company. He wasanonymous until Edmond Rothschild nominated him to the bank’s board ofdirectors. After gathering up shares at rock bottom prices, Rothschild announcedan official change of heart to sell the bank at $50 a share. Rothschild thensold this supposedly American bank to the Japanese, Mitsubishi, to be exact, and“made a killing\" off of his manipulations and insider trading. In Mar. 1982,Mitsubishi began secret negotiation to buy the bank which they codenamed“Snoopy.\" Over the years, stockholders had watched various companies offer $74 ashare, $60 a share and other good terms only to be rebuffed. When Rothschildfinally sold for $50 a share to the Japanese, it was clear that his whole goalhad been to cheat stockholders to insure a big cash reward for himself. RichardFreemon, a large stockholder who had sold, sued Rothschild and the directors forcheating him on his stock. The $25 million dollar lawsuit was settled out ofcourt, with all parties swearing not to disclose how much Freemon got for havinglost money due to Rothschild’s stock manipulations.The Round Table GroupDavid Smith who has written the following article on the Rothschilds for thisnewsletter asked me to explain in this introduction about Rothschild and theRound Table Group. The men who formed Milner’s Round table group from thevarious clues in their lives were by and large secret Satanists. Rhodes andStead created a secret society which had a “circle of initiates.\" This circleincluded such names as Albert (Lord) Grey, Arthur (Lord) Balfour, Sir HarryJohnston, and Lord Rothschild. Milner was on the executive committee of thissecret group. Carroll Quigley dates the start of the group as March 1891.Apparently, the Rothschilds helped finance this secret society. In 1909-1913,this secret society in turn formed Round Table groups in British dependenciesand the U.S. Eight of these round table groups were still functioning into the1970s. Sir Abe Bailey supported the Round Table groups quarterly magazine calledThe Round Table in 1919, Sir Abe Bailey and the Astors financed the creation ofthe Royal Institute of International Affairs which in turn created daughterorganizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States. TheRIIA is also sometimes called Chatham House. The first Round Table group of theRhode-Milner group were sometimes called the Cliveden Set because they often metat the Astor’s Cliveden Estate. Terence O’Brien’s biography describes Milner’srelationship to the Rothschild’s as very close Lord Alfred Milner (1854-1925)frequently visited the Rothschilds, stayed overnight with various Rothschilds,and even had some sleepless nights with them without explanation as to why.Milner also worked for Rothschild as a director of Rio Tinto. Three Illuminatifamilies stand out in the creation of the Round Table groups, which then becamethe RIIA and the CFR and related groups. These are the Rothschilds, Astors, andGreys. The Bailey family also shows up an important generational satanic family.The RIIA and its various branches such as the CFR are very powerful today. In myBe Wise As Serpents book readers can find a chart showing the role the CFR playsin the Policy Process of the U.S.“The Rothschilds”By David Smith The Rothschild family reached a peak in its power during the Age of Metternich(1814-1848), but as the century waned, so did Rothschild power. They still helda considerable amount of influence but their “veto power\" was not as strong asit had been before the Revolutionary overthrow of Metternich’s Europe. Thislagging power was nothing that could not be reversed though, and last half ofthe 19th century was spent manufacturing another incredible climb upward. Thenew rise in power came about during the reign of the \"New Trinity\" - Alphonse(France), Lionel (England), and Anselm (Vienna). The succeeding generations ofthese three family leaders were the catalysts of new family order. An excellentexample of Rothschild power in the late 19th century is the family’s dealingswith the Illuminati Habsburgs. In order to be court worthy for the Habsburgs youhad to have four ancestral lines of nobility and you had to be baptized. YetEmperor Francis Joseph gave the Rothschilds ,,a special act of grace\" in 1887.From then on, the House was allowed to be on close terms with the Habsburgs.This was a considerable act. The European nobility are very serious about theiraristocratic rules. (Francis Joseph was not very close to the House, but hiswife was a good friend of the Rothschilds). Another great example of Rothschildinfluence is their direct Involvement on both sides of the Austro-Prussian andFranco-Prussian Wars. Bismarck., dictator of Prussia, was a sort of son tofatherless Amschel of Frankfort. After Amschel died Bismarck remained close tothe Rothschilds (although he had occasional quibbles with the family).Bismarck’s banker, Bleichroder, was a Rothschild agent and the richest man inBerlin. He was invaluable to Bismarck as the financier of the dictator’s warswith Austria and France. In Austria, the Hapsburgs were at least publiclyimplored by Alphonse and Anthony of Paris and Anselm of Vienna to avoid a warwith the ambitious Prussian dictator at all costs. Of all the internationalbanking families, the Rothschilds appeared to be in favor of peace the most,although this was probably a ruse. “We want peace at any price,\" said Anthony deRothschild. \"What do we care about Germany, or Austria or Belgium? That sort ofthing is out of date.\" But the Austrians gave in to Bismarck’s provocations andembarked on a war with Prussia in 1866 (the Rothschilds had all congregated inLondon for a family wedding the year before; it is possible the wedding was usedas an excuse to assemble the family together to discuss a plan of actionconcerning the up-coming events) . Austria had been warned. In seven weeks thewar was over, Bismarck had crushed the Austrians. The war had been financed byRothschild agent, Bleichroder. Then Bismarck began to provoke France. NapoleonIII was in the pocket of the head of all the Rothschilds, Alphonse de Rothschildof the Paris House. In fact, the two even shared the same mistress. Alphonsealso had \"access\" to Bismarck. He was on both sides of the track, so to speak.Then, (very possibly under Rothschild direction) Bismarck began to try to put aGerman prince on the Spanish throne. Napoleon III responded by telling Alphonsethat France could not allow such a thing, and unless England interveneddiplomatically he would have no choice but to go to war against Prussia. TheEmperor wished to use the Rothschild’s courier/agent system to relay thismessage to England. Baron Alphonse did so, sending the message to Nathaniel deRothschild at New Court who relayed it to a close family Mend, and former PrimeMinister Gladstone (England happened to be without a Prime Minister at thattime). Gladstone (shedding, I believe, a light on the family’s own opinions)answered the message with a refusal to intervene. The stage was set. AlthoughBismarck withdrew his Spanish candidate, the frictions between France andPrussia had become irreconcilable. Napoleon III declared war on Prussia in 1870.Explained one biographer: \"No one foresaw the fall of France. Indeed crownedbeads and statesmen alike believed that at long last Bismarck had taken on animpossible task.\" Despite everyone’s confidence in France, Alphonse sent hisfamily to England. He apparently knew better. Napoleon III suffered a terribledefeat. His empire came to an end. This war was also financed by the Rothschildagent, Bleichroder. Here comes the great puzzle concerning the whole affair.Biographers, using diaries and such, seem to think the Rothschilds were verydistraught over Napoleon III’s loss. But It also appears they were behind thewhole mess. Perhaps the fear of the unpredictability of the new revolutioncaused this dismay. Perhaps it is just Rothschild disinformation. Perhaps theirplan was to keep connections on both sides of the conflict and ride out thestorm, but they were upset because their philosophical loyalty was to France(although I find this hard to believe). The family had their hands in both sidesof the conflict, it even appears they manufactured the conflict, why the outcomemight have upset them I have no idea. I personally believe the House ofRothschild wanted to get rid of Napoleon Ill and his empire, which is exactlywhat happened, the third republic was set up in France. After the war the Frencheconomy was devastated. The Rothschild agent, Junius Morgan was brought in tohelp restore the French financial situation. He made a large profit. As you cansee the Rothschild’s involvement in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Warswas significant, even though they were crying peace. [End of article by David Smith]French House, Late 19th and Early 20th CenturyAlphonse, of the \"New Trinity\", was the 4th head of the House of Rothschild. Hewas an aristocratic man and friend of many prominent leaders of his day. He wasalso an adulterer, his most notable affair being with the Comtesse deCastiglione. He and his wife were called \"the most lavish entertainers of theirday.\" The sophisticated Alphonse was even friends with Belgium’s King Leopoldand England’s Prince of Whales. He also improved upon his inherited network ofRothschild agents, an underground system that would continue to grow well afterhis death. He was one of best informed men of his day. His older sisterCharlotte married Nathaniel of the English House. His brother Gustave also hadan affair with the Comtesse de Castiglione. His youngest brother, Edmond #1 wasa genius and a main figure in the creation of a Jewish homeland in Israel. Hehelped divide the world’s oil between Shell and the Rockefeller’s Standard Oil.His other brother Salomon James married a Frankfurt Rothschild and is thesubject of a weird circumstance described by biographer Virginia Cowles. \"In1864 Baron James’ third son, the brilliantly clever Salomon [James], droppeddead. The boy had become a compulsive gambler which had caused his father greatanxiety, as anyone with the Rothschild name was given unlimited financialcredit. Apparently Salomon died of a heart attack which fascinated the Goncourtbrothers. “Cabarrus, Rothschild’s doctor,’ one of them wrote, ,,toldSaint-Victor that the young Rothschild who died the other, day really died ofthe excitement of gambling on the Stock Exchange. Imagine it; a Rothschild deadof a paroxysm over money.’ \"However, if the Goncourt brothers had known thedetails of a previous heart attack suffered by Salomon they would have been evenmore enthralled. Three years earlier Salomon had ‘dropped dead’. He had beenplaced in a coma and, according to Jewish custom, carried into every room in thehouse. One of the pall bearers had stumbled, the coffin had crashed into a doorand Salomon had woken up! Not for another three years was he well and trulyburied.\" This story could lead to all sorts of speculation. De RothschildFreres, the French House bank, was very powerful. It got its hands intoelectrical Industries, the development of the Mediterranean Railway and NorthAfrican business. It also controlled, with the British House, the Baku oilfields in Russia, which made the Rothschilds the main competitors of theRockefeller trust. The oil business was principally run by Edmond #1.When Alphonse died in 1905, the new generation of the French House came underthe charge of Baron Edouard, a quiet and very rich man. Edouard was a directorof the Bank of France. Baron Edouard also ran the de Rothschild Freres with hiscousin, Robert (who married a Beer), son of Gustave (Robert’s sister, AliceCaroline married Sir Edward A. Sassoon). These two carried de Rothschild Freresthrough the tumult of the First World War. Their policies were passive, as theyextremely protective of the family wealth. Baron Edouard and Robert had closebusiness dealings with J.P. Morgan. One of the operations of the Morgan-FrenchRothschild combine involved economic manipulation that allowed the Vienna Houseto almost fully regain the losses that the Austrian Rothschilds had incurredduring WWI. The son of Edmond #1, James Armand de Rothschild, carried on theIsrael work of his father after Edmond #1’s death in 1934. James Armand’sbrother Maurice was the black sheep of the Rothschild’s new French generation.Maurice was a banker and a Senator in the French Parliament. Maurice was a veryscandalous figure in the aristocratic scene. He was known as Don Juan deRothschild. Said one biographer: \"Some people went as far as to claim that ...one had to be seduced or at least pinched by Baron Maurice if one was a woman,or affronted by Baron Maurice, if a man. No other personage surpassed him inenriching the delicious scandal of his times.\" Thus a new French generationbegan the 20th century, the un-dynamic Baron Edouard leading the way.British House, Late 19th and Early 20thLionel de Rothschild, of the \"New Trinity\", brought the British House into thelate 19th century. The Lionel was a very powerful man. He ran New Courtshrewdly, and financed many prominent ventures, such as Cecil Rhodes’ gold anddiamond mines, and the purchase of the Suez Canal. He was also the first JewishMember of Parliament. His sister, Charlotte married another member of the \"NewTrinity\", Anselm of Vienna. Another sister married into the soon-to-be extinctItalian House.Lionel’s brother Anthony - who described the Rothschilds as \"complete slaves tobusiness - married a Montefiore, and was knighted by the Queen - thus SirAnthony de Rothschild. Lionel’s next brother, Nathaniel, was the father of theMouton Rothschilds. Nathaniel, though of the British House, loved France andmoved to Paris in 1851. In 1853 he bought vineyards that became known as MoutonRothschild, and he lived at these vineyards several months of the year. Hisdescendants, the Mouton Rothschilds, are citizens of France but are of theBritish House (except that their mother was a French Rothschild, but the malelineage is the most important in the Rothschild family). Another of Lionel’sbrothers, Baron Mayer, married a Cohen. Mayer built a spectacular house,Mentmore Towers. Said one woman: \"I do not believe that the Medicis were ever solodged at the height of their glory.\" The Mentmore Towers were turned over toMayer’s daughter, Hannah, when he died. Hannah married the Earl of Roseberry in1878. The Earl of Roseberry became Prime Minister of England in 1894-95. TheMentmore Towers are still owned today by the son of Hannah, the current Earl ofRoseberry. The Baron Mayer de Rothschild was a Member of Parliament (never madea speech), and loved horse breeding and racing. He was the \"sporting\" member ofthe family. When Lionel died in 1879 a new generation of British Rothschildappeared on the scene led by Lionel’s aristocratic son, Nathaniel \"Natty\" deRothschild. Natty took control of New Court, the Rothschild’s British bank. Hewas elected to the House of Commons in 1865, and then, in 1885, Queen Victoriamade him a Lord and he entered the House of Lords - the first Lord Rothschild.The Intelligent and extroverted Natty was an ornate speechmaker, unlike hisfather, Lionel, and Uncle Mayer. Lord Natty has been described as exclusive,lofty, humorless, \"one of the three rudest men in England,\" selective, blunt,aloof, powerful and a man with an explosive temper. A perfect representative ofthe ruling class. Said one biographer: \"Although Natty lacked the soaringIntelligence of his rough, unsociable grandfather [Nathan, 2nd head of theRothschilds] he had a strong personality and the authoritative air of a man whois not accustomed to being contradicted.\" Lord Natty was a good friend of PrimeMinisters Disraeli and Gladstone. He played the philanthropy game of the richvery well. The powerful head of New Court was known for his charities,especially to the Jews - he was called “King of the Jews\" as have many otherRothschilds. The haughty Lord Rothschild was even chairman of the British RedCross. Lord Natty won the hearts of the London police (an effective measure whenone is in the Illuminati). Every Christmas he presented them with a \"handsomecheque\" and any officer could receive a four course meal at his home. Hence,Rothschild carriages were always given the right of way in traffic. In businessLord Natty was very conservative. He did not take very many risks and lookedonly for safe family investments. His self-confidence told him to manage hiswealth himself and not trust his Investments with people who might strike apainful blow to his riches. \"Natty was brusque and humorless and did not sufferfools gladly.\" Nor could he allow his money into the hands of a fool, cautionwas a necessary device as far as he was concerned. According to the writer FrankHarris the Lord Rothschild told him: “I go to the bank [New Court] every morningand when I say ‘no’ I return home at night without a worry. But when I say‘yes’, it’s like putting your finger into a machine - the whirring wheels maydrag your whole body in after the finger.\" New Court was very powerful at thistime, for example it controlled the Ruby Mines in Burma, and the banksoperations covered most of South America. Brazil was the Rothschild’s \"preserve\"in South America, as Argentina was the \"preserve\" of London’s other majorbanking family - the Barings. While Lord Natty’s two brothers, Alfred and Leo,helped run New Court, Natty was almost totally calling the shots. \"Natty stoodfor finance, Alfred for the arts, Leo for sport.\" Son of the Queen, the Princeof Wales, Albert College, Cambridge. They became good friends and soon thePrince was close friends with most of the British House and others of theRothschild clan, Including Natty’s brothers, Alfred and Leo. The group offriends became known as “The Marlborough Boys\", named after the Prince’sMarlborough House at which they regularly gathered.“The Marlborough Boys\" were intent on having fun. The small circle of partierswas living a life where \"wit took precedence over etiquette...\" The Princeprobably had a hand in convincing the Queen to grant Natty peerage. TheRothschilds were suspected, rightfully so, of financing the Prince’s investmentsand paying off his debts. The Prince later became King Edward VII of England. Asyou can see, Rothschild influence extends far and wide. Alfred, Lord Natty’sbrother, was an eccentric man. He had a zebra four-in-hand, a pet goat, aprivate philharmonic which be conducted and a private circus which he wouldringmaster. Needless to say, the Baron Alfred was a man with flair. \"He lovedmusic, clothes, furniture, paintings, beautiful women and, above all, luxury.\"He was also involved in business - he worked at New Court and was the firstJewish Director of the Bank of England. The Baron was among those in charge ofthe last rites over Disraeli’s’ dead body (Queen Victoria might have had anaffair with Disraeli that the Rothschilds covered up). Alfred’s demeanor waslike that of a diplomat and was very interested in foreign affairs. He wasinstrumental in easing the English - German tensions around the turn of thecentury. It was not to the Rothschilds benefit to have war. Alfred parted withtradition when he gave, in his will, his great wealth to his daughter. Hisdaughter, in turn, used some of that Rothschild money to fund the expeditioninto Egypt that discovered Tutankhamen’s grave. Lord Natty’s other brother,Baron Leopold de Rothschild, was not much of a businessman. He much morepreferred horse racing and automobiles. He had the reputation of being a kindman. His wife, Maria Perugia, was the sister of Mrs. Arthur Sassoon. The firstworld war supposedly hurt the British House financially (although it appearstheir missing riches only went underground), but as always they bounced rightback (in the eyes of the public). Thus a new British House of Rothschild beganthe 20th century, lofty Lord Natty leading the way.Austrian House, Late 19th and Early 20th CenturyBaron Anselm von Rothschild, of the \"New Trinity\", brought the Austrian House tothe close of the 19th century. Anselm lived under the reputation of his father,Salomon, and his uncle, Amschel (with whom he spent a good deal of his time).But he did not necessarily ride their coat tails, he proved his worth, so tospeak. His most notable act being the creation Creditanstalt, which destroyedthe financial challenger of the Rothschilds, Credit Mobilier. As a young manAnselm was a bit wild and frivolous, so his father sent him away to apprentice.Anselm ended up working under his uncle Amschel in the Frankfort bank (which wasdoomed to future liquidation). Frankfort mellowed him, and he lived there for 30years. When his father died in 1855, Anselm returned to Vienna to take hisfather’s place. He became a very active businessman. Anselm had influence in theHabsburg court. Baron Anselm’s \"name was inscribed in the Golden Book of thecapital and in 1861 he had been made a member of the Imperial House of Lords.\"He also knew bow to incur his wrath. One club in Austria refused him membershipbecause he was a Jew. Baron Anselm simply bought a sewage disposable unit andinstalled it right next to the club. The smell was horrible. The dub then triedto give him a membership card, to mend the problem, but he returned the carddoused in perfume and informed them that he would not move his sewage unit. TheRothschilds set off the financial crisis of 1873 in Vienna. S.M. Rothschild andSohne totally controlled Hungarian finance. And Creditanstalt was the financialpowerhouse of the Habsburg realm. Anselm’s children carried on in Vienna afterhe died in 1874. Ills eldest son Nathaniel was an aristocrat, who was notinterested in banking, only fine art and history. Anselm’s second son,Ferdinand, moved to England. Only Baron Albert von Rothschild, Anselm’s youngestson had a business inclination and be was chosen to take over Creditanstalt.Baron Albert and Nathaniel were the two richest men in Austria. Baron Albert\"held controlling interest in innumerable industries ranging from coal torailways; and when, in 1881, he converted the famous six-per-cent Gold Loan toHungary the bank was recognized as the greatest financial force in the empire.\"Albert was afraid of the common people and he built a mansion that was more of acitadel than a house. Its walls were seven feet high, and on top of that satanother eight feet of iron fencing. Anselm’s second son, Baron Ferdinand, was amember of Prince Edward’s \"Marlborough Boys.\" He remained in England, becoming anaturalized citizen. “Ferdy\" as he was called was an intellectual socialite. Hebuilt an incredibly grandiose mansion named Waddeson Manor; one of the mostawesome of all the Rothschild homes. The Manor was so marvelous that the Queenherself paid it a visit. Visitors to its halls ranged from the Empress Frederickto the Shah of Persia. Ferdinand also had a zoo. One of Anselm’s daughters alsomoved to England - Alice. The unmarried Alice was a very \"tyrannical\" person. Infact, she even yelled at the Queen when she saw her inadvertently trampling aflower-bed. The Queen and Alice remained friends, and the Queen nicknamed Alice“The Al Powerful.\" \"Alice ... reigns absolutely,\" wrote a cousin. \"There isnothing constitutional about this monarchy. No wonder the Queen has named her“The Al Powerful’...\"When Ferdinand died Alice received Waddeson Manor. Head of the Austrian House,Albert died in 1911. His son (none of his brothers had any children), BaronLouis became the head of the house. Louis’ brothers, Alphonse and Eugene, were\"gentlemen of leisure.\" Baron Louis and his two brothers both served in theAustrian army during World War I (the war supposedly split the Vienna House fromthe French and English Houses, I don’t believe this). The Austrian House’swealth had to go underground during the war. After the war ended the French andEnglish Houses put the Austrian House back \"on their feet again.\" Thus a newAustrian House began the 20th century, powerful Albert and suave Baron Louisleading the way.The Morgan ConnectionGeorge Peabody, a Massachusetts’s trader, set up a banking house - GeorgePeabody & Co. - in London in 1837. He became regarded as a \"financial ambassadorin London. Carrol Quigley attributes the use of tax-exempt foundations formanipulation of society to Peabody, seen in his Illuminati Peabody foundation.Daniel Colt Gilman, a member of the Skull & Bones and first President of theCarnegie Institution, was involved in the establishment of the Peabodyfoundation. He was in such high regard by the elite that they have erected astatue of him across from the Bank of England. Peabody was getting old andneeded a younger partner. Junius Morgan, of Hartford, Connecticut, wasrecommended to Peabody. In 1854 Junius and his family arrived in London to joinGeorge Peabody Co. When the elite’s concocted American Civil War broke out,Peabody and Junius Morgan raised loans for the North. It appears JunIus playedboth sides of the war. Ralph Epperson claims Junius was one of the Rothschildagents who shipped supplies to the South. When Peabody retired in 1864 Juniustook over the business. The firm was re-named JS. Morgan & Co. That same yearJunius’ son, J.P. Morgan, became a junior partner in the firm. A year later J.P.left for America to represent the firm in the New York. After the end of theFranco-Prussian War, Junius Morgan was called on to help restore the Frencheconomy. Around this time his bank was talked of as a rival to the Rothschild’sNew Court, but Junius was a Rothschild agent, when he prospered so prospered theRothschilds and the Illuminati. J.S. Morgan & Co. was one of the Rothschild’sgreat power tools in the United States. In 1869 JunIus’ son, J.P. Morgan went toLondon to meet with the Rothschilds. They laid out the plans to form NorthernSecurities, a company that would act as an agent for New Court in the US. J.P.ruling as a proxy for the family. In 1871 Junius’ son, J.P. Morgan, made analliance with Tony Drexel, heir to the powerful Philadelphia bank. Their firm -Drexel, Morgan & Co. -resided in an extravagant new building on Wall St., whichis still Morgan headquarters today. After the Europeans got over their lack ofconfidence at the end of the Civil War, money began to stream across the oceanto the US., providing massive profit for the firm. It set out to finance thegrowing number of industrial projects in America. The House of Morgan wasgetting extremely rich.Junius retired in 1879 and J.P. took over JS. Morgan & Co., reorganizing itunder the title J.P. Morgan & Co. \"J.P. Morgan soon became a symbol of thegrowing centralization of American money.\" He was very monopolistic. His agentswould create cartels through ‘Morganization.\" By 1896 the Illuminati familiesPayne, Whitney and the Vanderbilts, all bad money in Morgan-Guarantee Companywhich was run by the \"J.P. Morgan and Guggenheim outfits.\"At a certain point he controlled nearly half the American railroad system. Heestablished the United States Steel Corp. (\"based on Andrew Carnegie’sPittsburgh Steel mills\") In 1901 by raising the \"unprecedented\" amount of $1.4billion. J.P. was adept at creating financial syndicates for the Illuminati,joint efforts to further the \"Great Plan.\" President William McKinley beganprosecuting the Rothschild’s Morgan-run Northern Securities under the anti-trustlaws in 1900. In 1901 McKinley ran for a second term and appointed a newvice-president, Theodore Roosevelt, a lock, stock and barrel Illuminatus. Lessthan a year later he was assassinated. When \"Teddy\" became president theprosecution of Northern Securities stopped. For this reason some people thinkMcKinley’s death was ordered by J.P. Morgan and the Rothschilds. He was able toset up a syndicate, with the help of Rothschild agent, August Belmont, Jr., thatbailed the U.S. out of a Treasury depletion. The syndicate raised $65 billion ingold. The sum would be repaid by an issue of bonds. J.P. received some criticismfor the strict terms of the deal. For 5 months in early 1907, J.P. Morgan was inEurope, traveling back and forth between London and Paris, presumably visitingthe Rothschild House’s there. A. Ralph Epperson writes: \"Apparently the reasonMorgan was in Europe was because the decision was being made to have Morganprecipitate a bank panic in America. When he returned, he started rumors thatthe Knickerbocker Bank in New York was insolvent.\" Panic ensued. People began amass withdrawal of their deposits - a run. The Knickerbocker run had a dominoeffect, other banks had runs and the Panic of 1907 “was complete.\" J.P. Morganoversaw the banking community’s response to the Panic of 1907. The wholeIncident helped the elite push for a central bank. One man who knew of the plotwas historian Frederick Lewis Allen, who wrote in LIFE magazine: “...certainchroniclers have arrived at the ingenious conclusion that the Morgan intereststook advantage of the unsettled conditions during the autumn of 1907 toprecipitate the Panic, guiding It shrewdly as it progressed, so that it wouldkill off rival banks, and consolidate the pre-eminence of the banks within theMorgan orbit.\" The Panic of 1907 made people want a powerful central bank thatcould \"protect\" the common man from the \"abuses of the Wall Street bankers.\"This whole thing eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve. One ofthe men with the Morgan financial groups was Harold Stanley. Stanley was amember of the Skull & Bones. After J.P.’s death a Morgan firm became Morgan,Stanley & Co. J.P. Morgan died in 1913. His son, Harvard-educated J.P. Morgan,Jr., took over (most conspiratorial writers do not make a distinction betweenthese two). J.P. Morgan, Jr ran the bank with a team of managers that was led byThomas Lamont. Morgan, Jr was, like his father, a power-hungry internationalbanker. He was famous for his handling of immense foreign loans. MostImportantly J.P. Morgan, Jr appears to have followed in the footsteps of theformer heads of the House of Morgan by working with the Rothschilds.The Schiff ConnectionRemember the Schiff family? In the first article I explained that they shared aresidency in Frankfort, forever binding the two families. The Schiffs becameRothschild agents, and like most agents of the Rothschilds they eventuallybecame very rich and powerful. The most prominent of the Schiffs was Jacob HenrySchiff. Jacob was born in Frankfort in 1847, and was sent by theRothschild/Schiff network to America to make his fortune (Much like the Astorssent John Jacob Astor). Jacob Schiff arrived in New York in 1865. Ten yearslater he became the partner of the Illuminati firm Kuhn, Loeb Company. Ten yearsafter that he became its president. Directing Rothschild and IllumInati affairsfrom this seat of authority, Jacob Schiff was also on the board of directors ofCentral Trust Company, Western Union, and Wells Fargo Company. Like most elite,he gave vast amounts of money to charity. Philanthropy pays off in a big way tothe ruling class.Jekyll IslandThe Illuminati interests wanted to create a Central Bank in America. They wantedto build the Federal Reserve. First, they needed a bunch of banking crisis’ thatwould push public opinion towards a Federal Reserve system. These were providedby the Illuminati, including J.P. Morgan’s Knickerbocker Panic of 190?. Second,they needed a favorable U.S. president in office. Rothschild agent Lionel Houseprovided this by getting Woodrow Wilson elected. The American people were beingconditioned. To provide the ‘reform of the American banking system\" acongressional National Monetary Commission was created and a man related to theRockefellers, Nelson Aldrich, was put in charge. For two years this Commissiontravel around Europe hob-knobbing with the Illuminati and getting directions asto how the central bank should be set up. Then the Commission returned in 1910,and Nelson Aldrich went to a secret meeting at the Jekyll Island Hunt Club inGeorgia to write the legislation for an American central bank to be run by theIlluminati. Others at the Jekyll island meeting were these Illuminati men - A.Platt Andrew, Frank Vanderup (of a Kuhn-Loeb & Company bank), Henry Davidson (ofJ.P. Morgan), Charies Norton (of a Morgan bank), Paul Warburg (of Kuhn-Loeb &Company and brother-in-law of Schiff), Benjamin Strong (of another Morgancompany). Most of these men were connected to Jacob Schiff or J.P. Morgan, whoin turn were agents for the House of Rothschild. The Jekyll Island Hunt Club waseven owned by J.P. Morgan. The Federal Reserve bill was sneakily passed throughcongress in the winter of 1913 and President Woodrow Wilson signed the bill intolaw. The Illuminati, particularly the Rockefellers and Rothschilds, bad usurpedthe financial power of the United States. The first governor of the New Yorkbranch of the Federal Reserve was Benjamin Strong. The first governor of theFED’s board of directors was Paul Warburg. Both connected to Schiff, J.P.Morgan, Jr, and the House of Rothschild. The FED has been an effective tool ofthe Illuminati and the Rothschilds, creating crisis such as the Great Depression(which J.P. Morgan, Jr was very involved in creating). Apparently (according toCongressman Louis McFadden), the Depression helped consolidate financial powerover the US., putting It in the hands of the Rothschild banking alliance betweenJ.P. Morgan’s First National Bank group and Schiff’s Kuhn, Loeb-run NationalCity Bank. The Great Depression also led to Roosevelt’s New Deal.World War IRothschild connections to the First World War are an excellent example ofcontrolled conflict. On the Allied side the British and French Housesfinancially supported their countries battles. Some Rothschilds were evensoldiers, although they didn’t see much action. J.P. Morgan Bank was a bigfinancial help to the Allied cause. It was the Allies \"purchasing agent\" untilthe U.S. entered the war.It also created a syndicate that financed “modernization\" in China, to helpdefend that country against the Japanese threat. The elite wanted America in thewar. Historian Charles Tansill noted: “... the large banking Interests weredeeply interested in the World War because of wide opportunities for largeprofits. On August 3, 1914, even before the actual clash of arms, the Frenchfirm of Rothschild Freres cabled to Morgan and Company in New York suggestingthe floatation of a loan of $100,000,000, a substantial part of which was to beleft in the United States, to pay for French purchases of American goods.” Thesinking of the Lusitania was a ploy. It was packed with some Morgan-ownedammunition, had been given over to England as a member of the navy, and despitethe warnings of the Germans was sent Into a naval war zone, specifically to be atarget - the catalyst for America’s entrance to the war. A knowledgeableAmerican State Department failed to warn the US. citizens aboard the ship of thevoyages definite danger. Churchill ordered the Lusitania’s naval escort toreturn to port, and the fated ship was left unprotected, to be sunk. Rothschildagent Lionel House probably knew of this plot, records point to a discussion ofit between him and Sir Edward Grey of England. Historian Colin Simpson calledthe sinking of the Lusitania the \"foulest act of willful murder ever committedon the seas.” On the Axis side the Rothschild network was also funneling money.Another family allied to the Rothschilds was the Warburgs. Max Warburg, brotherof Kuhn-Loeb’s Paul Warburg ran a family financial powerhouse in Frankfort,Germany (one of the reasons the Rothschilds were able to liquidate theirFrankfort bank, the Warburgs would run things). Max was the head of the Germansecret police during WWI. The Warburg connection is reported to have helped theAxis powers financially. At the end of the war in 1919, the Treaty of Versaillesmeetings were attended by Rothschild connected men like Paul and Max Warburg,John Foster Dulles (of Kuhn-Loeb), Lionel House, Thomas Lamont (of Morgans) andAllen Dulles (of Kuhn-Loeb). The harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles totallyset the stage for World War II. Said one delegate: “This is no peace; this isonly a truce for twenty years.\" Sure enough, in 1939 the Second World Warstarted. Another product of the Versailles meetings was the elite’s Charter forthe League of Nations - the Illuminati’s first attempt at creating a globalinstitution. The League of Nations failed. This called for the need to create athink tank/special Interest organization that could promote the New WorldOorder. Thus the creation of the Foreign Relations Institutions - the CFR.,RIIA, etc. This will be discussed in a bit. World War I helped create aCommunist State. * Max Warburg funded Lenin and his revolutionaries. Jacob Schiff gave a known $20 million to Lenin. * J.P. Morgan & Co. helped finance the Bolshevik revolution. * Alfred de Rothschild also helped finance the Bolsheviks.World War IIThe Second World War was also controlled by Illuminati and Rothschild interests.The Great Depression did not only occur in America. It also swept Europe. Theeconomic depression in Europe, coupled with an extremely harsh Versailles Treatyhelped fan the flames of the nationalistic fires that swept Germany.Hitler was a member of the most powerful occultic secret society in Germany. Hepenetrated the inner circle of this society where Satanism was practiced. Hitlerwas dedicated to Satan’s Empire - an evil puppet. He was brought into this evilgroup by Dietrich Eckhart who is supposed to have said on his deathbed: \"FollowHitler. He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune! I have initiatedhim into the “Secret Doctrine”; opened his centers in vision and given him themeans to communicate with the Powers. Do not mourn for me: I shall haveinfluenced history more than any German.’ In the last article we discussed thepossibility of Hitler having been of Rothschild descendance. Consider this - heprobably had satanic bloodline, he had the backing of a powerful satanicsociety, he had sold his soul to Satan, and he had the financial backing of theIlluminati. Is it any wonder that he rose from obscurity, poverty andImprisonment to become one of the most powerful men to ever live? I believe thatit is even safe to speculate that Hitler was totally controlled by a demonicspirit(s); that he simply gave himself over to Satan’s control. An ex-member ofthe Satanic Hierarchy of the Illuminati expressed a belief to me that there havebeen certain evil men throughout history that have totally given themselves overto possession by Satan. That these men (Hitler, Genghis Khan, for example) havebeen anti-Christ types, simply human containers for the residence of a verypowerful demonic spirit, or even Satan himself. The ex-illuminati memberbelieved that when Satan no longer had need for the body of his anti-Christ hewould discard It with death and find another willing soul to sacrifice hisbodily control to the devil. These evil figures would not be “The\" Anti-Christ,explained the informant, but would have allowed themselves to taken over by \"thespirit\" of the Anti-Christ. This is just a theory, but I believe it has certainmerit. If it is true, it paints an interesting picture of Hitler and the rulingclass that created him. Hitler’s main source of economic power was from the I.G.Farben chemical cartel, and I.G. Farben in turn was controlled by theIlluminati. The I.G. Farben cartel was created by loans from Wall Street in whathas been called the Dawes plan. Carroll Quigley calls the Dawes Plan \"largely aJ.P. Morgan production.\" The J.P. Morgan Group set up the loan to I.G. Farben,which created Hitler. “Without the capital supplied by Wall Street, there wouldhave been no I.G. Farben in the first place, and almost certainly no AdolfHitler and Worid War II.\" Henry Ford merged his German assets with I.G. Farbenin 1928. The cartel created the lethal Zyklon B gas that was used to exterminatethe Jews. It was also involved in the torture experimentations that led to mindcontrol methods, such as Monarch Programming. Do you see what happened? ARothschild agent set up a cartel that was directly involved in the horriblepersecution of the Jews. Still the family maintains the illusion of beingtotally supportive of their race. At first, Germany had a significantdisadvantage if they were to embark on a second world war. The nation had a fuelshortage, but the Illuminati fixed this problem. The Germans were able to fightWWII through the use of synthetic fuels that were created by the hydrogenationprocess (turning coal into gasoline). This process was discovered by I.G.Farben. Hydrogenation technology would not have been fully developed by WWII,but I.G. Farben made a deal with Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, who was able tocomplete the research, facilitating the war. Interestingly, I.G. Farben plantswere not targeted by the bombing raids on Germany. By the end of the war therefineries had experienced only 15% damage. William Dodd, American ambassador toGermany before WWII, wrote President Roosevelt: \"At the present moment, morethan a hundred American corporations have subsidiaries here or cooperativeunderstandings. The DuPonts have their allies in Germany that are aiding in thearmament business. Their chief ally is the I.G. Farben Company... Standard OilCompany ... sent $2,000,000 here in December 1933 and has made $500,000 a yearhelping Germans improve hydrogenation technology] ... The InternationalHarvester Company president told me their business here rose 33% year, but theycould take nothing [earnings] out [except in goods]. Even our airplanes peoplehave secret arrangements with Krupps. General Motors Company [which wascontrolled by the J.P. Morgan Group] and Ford do enormous business here throughtheir subsidiaries and take no profits out.\" Germany needed the capital of theseand many more American companies in order to wage a war. I.G. Farben had aholding company in the United States called American I.G. Farben. Paul Warburg,his brother Max (head of Germany’s secret police during WWI), and Warburg agentHerman Metz were some of the members of the board of directors of the AmericanI.G. Farben. Other directors included Rockefeller/International banking men(Edsel Ford, Charles Mitchell, Walter Teagle, etc,) . Three Germans on the Boardof Governors were convicted as war criminals after the war, but the eliteAmericans forementioned were not, even though they participated in the samecriminal decisions as those who were punished. According to author EusticeMullins, Hitler met with Allen and John Foster Dulles in 1933. The Dullesbrothers were acting as legal representatives of Schiff and Warburg’s Kuhn, Loeb& Co, which was an Integral part of the Rothschild network. Mullins claims Kuhn& Loeb had extended large short-term credits to Germany, and needed to ensurethe repayment of these loans. The Dulles supposedly assured Hitler he wouldreceive the funds necessary to be installed as Chancellor of Germany, if hepromised to repay the debts. One of the largest tank manufacturers for Germanywas Opel, which was controlled by the J.P. Morgan Group. Another companyconnected to the J.P. Morgan Group was Bendix Aviation, ‘which supplied data [toGermany] on automatic pilots, aircraft Instruments and aircraft and dieselengine starters.’ The examples go on and on. There is much more that could bewritten on this subject. The manufactured Pearl Harbor attack allowed Rooseveltto enter America into the war. A second world war had been created by theIlluminati, with the help of the Rothschild/Morgan/Warburg/Schiff syndicate.After the end of the war, the Tribunals that investigated Nazi war criminalscensored \"any materials recording Western assistance to Hitler,\" said historianAntony C. Sutton.GlobalismWorld War II facilitated the American acceptance of a global ‘peacekeeping\"institution - the United Nations. After the U.S. had rejected the first attemptto create such an institution in the League of Nations, the Illuminati decidedto create an arm of the Rothschild funded Round Table groups which could helpinfluence western society towards the embracement of globalism. The originalidea was to create an international special interest group of advisors thatwould promote a New World Order, called the Institute of on InternationalAffairs. The plan eventually changed, the Institute was split up so thatseparate groups could influence separate governments without having theappearance of a conspiracy. These groups were formed at what are called theHotel Majestic meetings. Baron #1 Edmond de Rothschild of France was the mainforce behind these meetings, and all the founders of these groups were men whohad met with his approval. Chief of these was Rothschild agent Lionel EdwardMandell House. One of these groups was the CFR. The CFR Handbook of 1936explains how it was established. “On May 30, 1919, several leading members ofthe delegations to the Paris Peace Conference met at the Hotel Majestic in Paristo discuss setting up an international group which would advise their respectivegovernments on international affairs.... It was decided at this meeting to callthe proposed organization the Institute of International Affairs. At a meetingon June 5, 1919, the planners decided it would be best to have separateorganizations cooperating with each other. Consequently, they organized theCouncil on Foreign Relations, with headquarters in New York. and a sisterorganization, the Royal Institute of International Affairs [RIIA], in London,also known as the Chatham House Study Group, to advise the British Government. Asubsidiary organization, the Institute of Pacific Relations, was set up to dealexclusively with Far Eastern Affairs [and facilitated the Pearl Harbor attack].Other organizations were set up in Paris and Hamburg, the Hamburg branch beingcalled the Institut fur Auswartige Politik and the Paris branch being known asCentre d’Etudes de Politicque Etrangere...\" I have never seen any research onthe Institut fur Auswartige Politik in Germany. It would be interesting to seehow this group was Involved with the elite and the creation of WWII.A group of Illuminati wise men took the plans laid out at the Hotel Majesticmeetings and formed the CFR. The founders included; Lionel Edward Mandell House(a Rothschild agent), John Foster Dulles (of Rothschild connected Kuhn, Loeb &Co.), and Allen Dulles (also of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.).The CFR was officially founded on July 29, 1921. Money for the founding camefrom J.P. Morgan, Bernard Baruch, Otto Kahn, Jacob Schiff, Paul Warburg, andJohn D. Rockefeller, among others. The funding for the RIIA in London cameprimarily from the Astor family. Rothschild-connected Paul Warburg was on theoriginal board of directors of the CFR.As you can clearly see, the Rothschild network had significant influence in thecreation of the foreign relation groups. This influence continues today. TheRothschild’s power within the secret \"Society of the Elect\" and the Round TableGroups extended to the semi-publIc CFR, RIIA, etc. The House of Rothschild wasup in arms with their fellow elites; managing the creation of the New WorldOrder. Should there be a part 3 to this series, it will investigate individualRothschilds from the World War Era up into the modern day world, and theircontinuing involvement in the Illuminati.Bibliography: * Cowles, Virginia.

Tucson, Arizona: Publics Press, 1985 A Note about the Krupps of GermanyIt has been said by an Illuminati informant that the Krupp family is part of theIlluminati. It is clear that that the Krupp family must be at least in agreementto the plans of the Illuminati. This can be said because of the extensive powerof the Krupps. The Krupps were the primary producers of the big guns for theGerman army in W.W.I. Lenin wanted the Krupps to help him make the Russiansteppes productive. The Krupps have produced agricultural equipment, and trainlocomotives as well as tanks. After W.W. I had ended, the head of the Kruppfamily, Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, began secretly planning to rebuildGermany’s military might. Gustav Krupp bought coal mines after W.W. I with aneye on using them for future weapons production. After the Allied ControlCommission departed Germany in 1928, Krupp factories began secretly turning outa few tanks particularly at Krupp’s Garusonwerk Factory. The Christian ScienceMonitor which ties in with the occult system sent reporters to Krupps factoriesduring the 1920s to report on how well the Germans were complying with theVersailles Treaty limitations. The reporters gave a clean bill of health to theKrupp factories even though the reporters should have questioned why all theirfilm was destroyed during factory tours (infrared rays were beamed Into theirfilm while they toured Krupps factories.) Prussian-trained Gustav Krupp hadmarried the daughter of Friedrich Krupp whose name was Bertha. Bertha was apowerful woman, and sole owner in 1902 of one of Germany’s largest steel firms.The Krupps have lived above Essen, German in a huge palace called Villa Huegel,whose small wing has 60 rooms. They also have other castles and villas. At onetime they owned (as far as I know they still do) a castle in the Austrian Alpsnamed Bluehnbach. Gustav Krupp hosted and was one of the leaders of a secretgroup of 12 powerful German industrialists called the Ruhrlade which secretlymade Germany’s industrial decisions during the Weimar Republic. This group alsomade political decisions. In 1932, Krupp began to help Hitler. The secretgoverning body of the Ruhrlade covered their meetings behind the cover of havinglavish hunting parties. The Illuminati kept close tabs and gave secret supportto Hitler on his rise to power. Illuminatus William Randolph Hearst had hischief European correspondent William Bayard Hale met with Hitler early in the1920s at Hale’s lavish suite at the Hotel Bayrisher Hof.Part 3 --The Rothschilds TodayThe Rothschilds are one of the most prominent of the top thirteen Illuminatifamilies. This newsletter has been singling out each of the top thirteenIlluminati families for a feature article. Articles in this newsletter havealready been done on the Astor, Buady, Collins, DuPont, Freeman, U, Kennedy,Onassis, and Van Duyn families. The Rockefellers were featured in a December1992 article just prior to this series. Because there is more Information outabout the Rothschilds than some of the other families, I decided to write morethan just one feature article about them.Reviewing the Recent Newsletter Articles.The first set of my recent Rothschild articles consisted of my Introduction andthen main article. The Introduction covered the hidden lineages of the Springs,the Payseurs, the Beatty family and Abraham Lincoln. The main article by DavidSmith covered the 18th and 19th centuries of Rothschild power. The second set ofarticles again consisted of my introduction along with a main article. In myIntroduction I covered some about their secret power, their power in LatinAmerica, and their secret power to manipulate financial things without playingthe same rules as others play. David Smith’s main article covered theRothschild’s influence in history in the late 19th century and during the 20thcentury.The Rothschilds -- A Daily ThreatMy desire was to have an article about what the Rothschild’s are doing today.One of my most dangerous opponents in this area to the work I’m doing againstthe Monarch program is a secret Rothschild descendent. I know Monarch slaves whowere created to serve the Rockefeller family, the Russell family, the 13th HolyBlood Family, the Li family and the Collins family. I also know Monarch slaveswho were created to serve the Rothschilds. From what I have been told and alsofrom just personal observation, all of the top 13 Illuminati families areinvolved in the creation of Monarch slaves. It goes without saying that It isImpossible to be a high level Satanist and not have MPD. Any person without MPDwould go insane after participating in high level Illuminati rituals. It can’tbe stated with certainty that all Illuminati members (by Illuminati I meanmembers of the first pyramidal structure diagrammed in the Jan. 1, '93newsletter and in the Feb. I Issue) have been through Monarch programming today,but it can be stated with certainty that they all suffer from multiplepersonality disorder. This means that the Rothschilds in this country and inCanada and the U.K. have closely collaborated with the highest levels of theintelligence community and the military. Who initiated my phone being tapped? Atany rate, the Rothschilds and their satanic power is here in America, and peopleneed to understand that.The First Great Temple.The Illuminati are building their temples secretly throughout the United States.The last issue of this newsletter described the massive pyramid that has beenbuilt at Los Vegas. Pyramids have also been built at San Francisco (theTrans-America building) and in Chicago, and in other eastern places. The SanFrancisco building was built by people with ties to the Rockefellers. Just northof San Francisco and east of the Bohemian Grove is the Napa Valley ofCalifornia. Anton LaVey moved to Napa Valley after his split with Aquino. LaVeyran a construction company during the 1910. out of Napa, CA. (As an aside, AntonLaVey’s chief representative in our Portland area is Rex ,,Diablos\" Church, whogrew up as Rex Nance in Seaside High School on the Oregon coast. Rex worked atthe drug store at Broadway and Holiday at Seaside during high school. Two yearsafter high school he returned to his hometown with his head shaved and wearingblack in LaVey fashion. He had a stripper who dressed in black who was aSatanist as his girlfriend for a while in the Portland area. According to Rex’sown words, he grew up in a secret Satanic family and was baptized to Satan as achild. Rex and his Satanic friends have schemed how to hurt the Christians. Howmany of their devious plans have succeeded I do not know. Also of Interest isthat Rex lived a good deal with his, what has been reported as Jehovah’sWitness, grandparents.) With the Church of Satan feeling comfortable in Napa, itis not surprising that the Baron and Baroness Phillipi de Rothschild picked thearea to build a secret temple to Satan.Also as readers of this newsletter know, these people have been constructingcastles and other large buildings on spiritual ley lines for centuries, so itgoes without saying that when this secret temple was built in Napa, that the Icylines were at least considered in choosing a site. The Baron Rothschild beganthe construction of a pyramid in Napa Valley, which his wife completed after hedied. The pyramid is called Opus 1. According to one of the contractors whoparticipated in building the pyramid, the project cost $35 million. The variousconstruction cost reports given the public have been much less than what thiscontractor has said was the real cost of the building. The theme of the numbers3 and 6 runs throughout the large Opus I pyramid building, as well as the number666. Also little circles frequently appear.The name of the building is Opus 1, which means the First Work. Its cover orfront for the temple is that It is a winery. The winery operates very strangelyto a legitimate winery. The entire project of buying the land, building Opus 1,and operating it has been shrouded in secrecy. The wineries in California whenthey open traditionally and normally are open to the public. The openingceremonies of Opus 1 were shrouded in secrecy. The opening announcement was lowkey and only select people and select International media types were invited.This opening is extremely unusual for a winery in the Napa Valley area. Privateguided tours are very hard to obtain of Opus 1, in contrast to the otherwineries in Napa Valley. Further, the estate that the winery (temple) sits on isvery protected and secluded. The wrought iron gates are always closed. However,I was able to get a firsthand report from a group of three that managed to viewOpus 1. During the tour this group saw many occult and satanic items, and yetlarge areas of the winery (temple) were closed off to even this private tourgroup. The winery is not constructed even remotely similar to any winery in theUs. The project began as a joint venture between Robert Mondavi and BaronRothschild in 1979. The land was secretly purchased and in the late 1960sconstruction quietly began using contractors from far away. Strangely, the NapaValley Register which reports on all building activity remained extremely quietabout what was being built. From the air, the construction forms a masonicsquare and compass. On the Inside hidden stairwells and other hidden featureshave been built in. The capstone of the pyramid has a rotunda where skylightpenetrates the capstone and where viewers can get a view of the entire NapaValley. There have numerous Rothschilds who have entered into the variousMasonic rites. For Instance, Louis Rothschild was a 32° Scottish Rite Mason inChicago during the 1890’s. The reason for this is that Freemasonry is used astype of early class for those who are in the Illuminati to get them familiarwith the symbols of the Mystery religions and give them more practice with handsignals, rituals, and secrecy. Orchids, which are used by the Mothers ofDarkness, are grown all over the area. Orchids are the only type of flower grownon the site, and they are cared for by apparently Mothers of Darkness who aredressed in all black, which is the standard color of garb of the Mothers ofDarkness. The pyramid was built with limestone from Texas. No doubt there issome occult significance to the site that the limestone came from. The limestoneitself has fossils, which have been hidden from easy view for some reason.(Remember the ancient Egyptian pyramids used limestone.) Originally Opus I wasscheduled to open around the Summer Solstice but the date was shifted to Wed.,Oct. 30, 1991 which is the day before Halloween. Since the opening day, theRothschilds have had events scheduled around Satanic high days. Those who arefamiliar with the occult know that these events are covers for Satanic ritualswhich are held secretly. The land has wrought iron gates which are locked at alltimes. Some of the occult Items which private visitors saw within the pyramidwere: a book on wine depicting orgies by Salvador Dailey who is a Satanist, ablue-black picture with naked ritual dancers, and other strange occultic piecesof art (such as an oil painting of what looked like Satan). Massive draconianoak doors are built facing the hail that leads to the room where wine is tasted.Mirrors abound in the place. The gilded art work on the mirrors is often Rococo.The Baroness personally designed and furnished the Interior. The upside downpeace sign is found designed in some of the furniture as barren trees. Two treesof life from Peru are by the fireplace. The tree of life is by the way veryimportant to this level of the Illuminati. The visitors also saw three Moutonceremonial drinking cups with rams, and chairs which had the carvings on thefront arms/legs of fully formed demons were found in one of the rooms. The foyerlooks like the inside of a snail or “corkscrewy.\" Much of the furnishings werepurchased by the Baroness Rothschild from the De Medicis. It has various marblefloors and tables set with orchids. The stainless steel and the floors in thewinery are immaculate. The workers who work there were scrutinized closelybefore being hired. Originally, the wine workers were required to wear blackpants and white shirts, but the workers who had to stomp the grapes were unhappyabout the uniform requirements. I have been trying to follow the Rothschildfamily with its many branches. Although the Rothschilds are seen as greatinternationalists, don’t be surprised if some of the people of the Rothschildsseem somewhat middleclass, For instance, in the Millington, MI NE of Flint, MIone family dominates the tows. This family is the Bauer family. Stan Bauer was aman who mysteriously simply attracted material possessions to himself withoutany visible source of money. His son, Harold Bauer, a 32° Mason, sat on theHoughton Lake City Council. His next son Terry Bauer was also a Mason, also hada position in local government and was on the school beard. His daughter BarbersBauer married Jim Hagger who was also a Mason who lived in Grand Blanc south ofFlint. There is certainly more that could be said about the satanic Rothschildbloodline, but this is where I will bring this article to a close, with thestatement that, Lord Welling, I will write more about them later."},{"pageContent":" The Russell BloodlineThe Watchtower & the IlluminatiLast year in the Jan. ’93 newsletter I wrote an article about the Illuminati andthe Watchtower Society. Recently, on Dec. 10, ’93, Texe Marrs interviewed meover international, shortwave radio about the 1990 book The Watchtower and theMasons. Having got a good response from the shortwave radio interview, it isonly appropriate that this newsletter starts off the New Year with anotherarticle on the Watchtower Society and the Illuminati. Because of numerousproblems within the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses with Satanic RitualAbuse (SRA), the Watchtower Society put out an article in the Oct. 8, 1991 issueof the magazine. Lee Waters of Bethel Headquarters kept a file on his computerof Jehovah’s Witnesses who were reported to be victims of SRA. It is possibleheadquarters has told him to delete the file. Another man who was atheadquarters who is now believed out of the society was also well informed ofSRA among the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses (J.W.). In fact, two J.W.swho had actually been in the Illuminati while J.W.s but had broken free,confronted the Governing Body and headquarters with their evidence of theIlluminati operating within the membership of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.What was the response of the Watchtower Foundation (WF) leaders? To simplyignore and cover up the evidence. The actions of the Governing Body insquelching any serious action against the high-level Satanism secretly operatingwithin the Jehovah’s Witnesses shows what my Be Wise A Serpents book revealed,which is that very secret, high-level Satanism has long been controlling theWatchtower Society. One of these two eyewitnesses to Illuminati activitieswithin the higher levels of the Watchtower Society realized that something isseriously wrong at the top, when the WF leaders do not really care for thosepeople in the congregations who are becoming the victims of SRA. One elder ingood standing lost his position because be warned the WT Society of satanicinfiltration. It is obvious that the Watchtower organization is more interestedin public relations than it is in having a clean organization. In examining thefamilies that are involved with the Illuminati who use the Watchtower Society asa cover, we find a continuation of the same pattern as I noticed before: thereis a large contingent of Scottish and a large amount of Jewish bloodlines. Forinstance, one J.W. Illuminati family was the Udell family (Scottish name) whomarried Picketson Milliken (English maiden name with Jewish first husband). This type of combination typifies so many of the elite who I have researched. Inthe Be Wise As Serpents book, Chapter 1.11 discusses how the Satanism within theIlluminati and the Watchtower Society could be tracked by an understanding ofEnochian magic. Readers may want to refer back to that chapter after readingthis paragraph. The Illuminati operating within the Watchtower Society use theEnochian Language which has its own language and its own Enochian alphabet(letters in boxes). According to eyewitnesses who have left the J.W. part of theIlluminati, the Enochian alphabet is known and used as the cult language bythose Illuminati operating in the high levels of the Watchtower Society. Inother words, their ceremonies are done in this ritual Enochian language. SirWilliam Sinclair in the 16th century was one of those who introduced EnochianMagic to Scotland. The Scottish connection in the Watchtower Society isoverpowering. Both the Russell and the Rutherford families came from Scotland aswell as MacMillan and many other key early Watchtower leaders. From this itappears that the Scottish type of Illuminatism that created the early WatchtowerSociety has always practiced Enochian magic. Remember from the Be Wise AsSerpents book that knowing the Watchtowers is the key to Enochian magic. Thesame type of winged-sun-disk that C.T. Russell used was also used. Two phrases that were popular among Satanists who practiced Enochian Magic inRumli's day were “Millennial Dawn” and “Golden Age.” The following are some ofthe Illuminati operating within the Watchtower Society today (names may bespelled incorrectly in some cases): * Chris family - Domelie family-Irish bloodline * Karrls - JW Overseer in Miami, FL * Prince George McKee-Monroeville, AL * Melers, or Myer-Jewish Satanic bloodline. * Sharon Russell - left the Illuminati, still a J.W., worked with police showing ritual sites. * Princess Proud Swift - lived in Delaware, with the travel industry * Jim Tifton-important WT official and elder in So. Calif. A secret Satanic serial murderer. * Walt family * Woomer familyThe areas which have been identified as strong Satanic stronghold within theWatchtower religious empire are: * Southern California (cap. San Bernadino Valley) * Florida * the Carribean * Scotland * Bethel Headquarters in Brooklyn * …and various places in New York.I expect that this list of strongholds is very incomplete. According to an eyewitness of the Illuminati within the Watchtower Society the following items canbe ascertained: * Some type of trauma-based mind control is being used to create MPD and control children born into the Illuminati within the WF Society. * The rank and file J.W.s have no awareness that the WT Society has a secret upper level of involvement. (Note, I identified this upper level in my chart explaining how religions are controlled by Satanism.) * The Illuminati within the Jehovah’s Witnesses have a hidden agenda that is separate from the published goals of the WT Society, although they also support many of the goals of the Society.Ritual Sites.Beside rituals taking place in the above mentioned stronghold areas, it is ofvalue to point out that one of the rituals that I have found out about tookplace when a boat load of generational satanic J.W.s went to the Bahamas(believed to be Andros Is.) and had a ritual at a high place. This was in 1958.Related items.There are three items which relate to what has been described above. * There is a particular man who is well informed about the WT Society who is able to explain bow the WE Society is interlocked with a lot of major corporations. As a consequence of how connected the WT Society is with politics, big business, etc. the WE Society has been closely watched by the FBI which has over 12,000 pages in its files on the WT Society alone. This figure does not include its extensive files on individuals, of which every one of the WE Society Presidents has had a file. * The WT Society performs a secret ritual every year which is their primary ritual. This ritual is actually the ancient gnostic (satanic) ritual of saying no to the body of Christ. This ancient satanic ritual is now secretly practiced under the disguise of the Memorial Supper - where the elements of communion are passed and no one partakes of the elements. (When I say ‘no one’ I mean that in a qualified sense-only a small group are allowed to partake. The actual figures of how many partake of the elements is a totally fictitious figure according to my sources, which is created at Bethel headquarters in Brooklyn. * Canadian citizens who have tried to find out why the Watchtower Society in Canada is allowed to evade taxes, have been stonewalled by government officials. MacGregor Ministries newsletter News & Views, Oct. 1993, p. 10 discusses how various people have tried to expose the Watchtower’s avoidance of the GST and how the Minister of Finance, the Minister of National Revenue and many other government groups have simply stonewalled people. The fax no. of one of the most powerful committees of the Watchtower Society is the WT Service Dept. whose fax no. is 718-6244030. This newsletter will continue to bring articles on the various branches of Satan’s One World Religion which includes the Mormon authority structure, the Catholic authority structure, the Pentecostal and the Jehovah’s Witnesses authority structures just to name a few.One of the strangest things for this Author was to continue running intoevidence that seems to indicate Charles Taze Russell, the man who started theJehovah’s Witnesses’ Watchtower Society, was secretly an important Satanist.Lest the reader devalue the evidence, permit this author to state that theevidence came in first before I came up with my theory that Russell was animportant Satanist, and not vice-versa. Some of the outstanding clues are: * C.T. Russell was definitely a Mason, yet he puts up some great smokescreens in his writing concerning his membership. * C.T. Russell’s Bethel staff became concerned about his occultic activities and required him to take an oath forswearing any further occultic activities. * In my previous book The Watchtower and the Masons, I study 35 parallel beliefs that Russell had with Masonry. I spent a page per parallel. These 35 are not in any way inclusive, Russell had many other identical ideas to what the Masonic lodges propagate. * Various items from magic were part of Russell’s religious beliefs including healing handkerchiefs, phrenology, the Winged-Sun-Disk, Enochian Magical planes, etc. * Russell’s family’s possible Illuminati links, and his wife’s possible connections with a family line of Satanists. * Russell’s apparent secret Rosicrucian membership with the Quakertown, PA group of Rosicrucians, as revealed by the pyramid he ordered erected, his use of the Winged-Sun-Disk. and his cremation three days after his death. * Russell owned a cemetery in Pittsburgh. Leading Satanists try to own cemeteries for several reasons. First, it facilitates the disposal of human sacrifices which are buried in pieces below the fresh holes dug for someone else’s burial. When the casket is placed in the hole, it would be rare for anyone to dig below the casket level ever again. Second, magic power is associated with cemeteries. The spiritual power of the dead is pulled up by making a circle of light over them then within the circle a naked Satanist lays. Third, specific bones are sought such as the skulls and left hands. Left hands are preserved in order to hold candles for certain ceremonies. * Contacts from various places today indicate that the modern Watchtower Society is working with the New World Order. This implies that at some point the Society began cooperating with the New World Order. Russell seems to be the likeliest starting point.Understanding Charles T. RussellAs with all occult organizations a veil of secrecy is maintained by requiringinitiates to take secrecy oaths on penalty of death. As in Witchcraft, Masonryrepeatedly demands secrecy oaths at every new level. Charles T. Russell beganparticipating in this secrecy when he took the Entered Apprentice (first Masonicdegree) oath on penalty of mayhem and violent death, \"I ... do hereby and hereonmost solemnly and sincerely promise and swear that I will always hail, everconceal and never reveal any of the arts, parts or points of the secret arts andmysteries of ancient Freemasonry which I received, am about to receive, or mayhereafter be instructed in ...\"Notes * Confidential interviews with ex-Satanists. * Interview by Dr. Al Carlisle with a Black Prince recorded in Stratford, L. Satan’s Underground. p. 144.Should the reader allow, I will quote from the Power’s own statements plus otherproof to show that this “god,” “the god of the world,” is Lucifer (aka Satan,Sanat, Venus, etc.) For thousands of years, The Plan for world domination hasbeen passed down from occult generation to occult generation. Spaced every 28years is a Feast of the Beast, a year-long holiday during which Satanistsreceive new instructions from Satan on how to carry out The Plan. We read of thegreat holiday and its Great Councils in Externalisationof the Hierarchy, whenSatan’s instrument Alice Bailey writes, \"The past year... has, however, been theyear in which the greatest spiritual approach of all time has shown itself to bepossible - an approach for which the initiates and masters have for centuriesbeen preparing, and for which all the Vesak Festivals since the meeting of theGreat Council in 1925 have been preparatory. I have, in past instructions,referred to the great meetings held at intervals by those to whom is entrustedthe spiritual guidance of the planet and particularly of man.\"(Externalisationof the Hierarchy, p. 389.)One Sample of Their PlansAs example of how ingenious these plans are to create a One-World-Governmentconsider the following part of it. The Drug War is not what it seems. It is avery ingenious scheme to enslave the American people, and destroy all theircivil rights. The first rumblings of the Drug War part of The Plan seem to stirfrom the occult, so it is highly possible the Drug War originally was firstdeveloped by Satanists, perhaps even given during one of the Feasts of theBeast. The Drug War seems like the perfect plan, with no way for the Power tolose. First, the Power creates a drug culture in America. The Drug Culture wouldand did give many their first step into the Aquarian (New Age) conspiracy.6 ThePower would make billions of dollars by running drugs, to further finance othernefarious schemes, and could use their world-wide power to crush all theircompetitors. When the Power crushed and arrested their competitors in drugrunning, they would be hailed as heroes by the majority of people. (And theyhave.) The introduction of drugs into society does several things. It taxes theChristian church’s ability to oppose immorality. It gets the public indignantabout drugs, and the public’s moral outcry allows the Power to pass \"drug\" lawsthat remove the last vestiges of legal civil rights. In fact, the beguiledpublic demands the laws which abolish their rights, and applauds these laws inignorance unknowing what the laws actually say and mean. If the public somehowgets a complete picture that their government has been smuggling drugs to createa drug war in spite of the controlled media, or perhaps through the media at theright time, then they can create a scandal involving several U. S. Presidents toeliminate the U. S. government and switch the public’s allegiance to a worldgovernment. (See chapter 3.9 for more details and a chronology of the secretlyplanned escalation of today’s designed Drug War.) As an ex-Mason, who is veryaware of their plans, said to this author, \"These people are in it for thelong-term.\"The Bloodline of The RussellsThe purpose of this next subsection may be misunderstood, unless I make myselfclear at this point. This author has not established any link between thevarious famous Russells. (Although I have been doing genealogy work, I have nothad the chance to do the long-term genealogy work required to clarify the issue,if the reader is dissatisfied with the extent of this information, he isencouraged that rather than criticize to research it himself.) The reader willobserve by the time he finishes this book, that this author has done extensiveresearch into many groups. One item that has popped up consistently is thatpeople with the surname Russell repeatedly appear as important figures in thevarious elements of the World Order as it has developed. Before becoming awareof the One World Order, this Author had no inkling how important blood lineshave been for the elite that controls the world. Friendships have also played arole, for instance, Eleanor Roosevelt (who was involved in numerous communistorganizations’ and was an actual card carrying member of the American communistparty) was a close friend and confidant to Ronald Reagan’s mother. This seemstrivial, but the reoccurrence of blood lines and the reoccurring discovery ofconnections of friendships between what have been thought of as unrelatedpersonages, compels one to believe the elite is more compact than appears. (Moreon that later) The mysterious Watchtower Society and its founder Charles TazeRussell will serve as perhaps the most used example in this book of anorganization that is secretly serving the New World Order. The author is awarethat there are Jehovah’s Witnesses that are covert Satanists. The Russell familyappears to have moved from Germany to Scotland and from Scotland to northernIreland. In the 1820’s Alexander G. Russell went to New York City and then ontoOrange Co., NY. He could write firsthand how good it was. When the Potato faminehit during the 1820s, the Russells did not have the roots to Ireland that theoriginal Irish had, and the rest of the family moved to America, except forFannie’s husband Alexander Harper, who stayed behind in Donegal estranged fromhis wife. The family tree looked like this: [Picture unavailable] Let’s comment about the type of Russells that keep appearing throughout thecourse of the history of the New World Order as this author went about hisresearch. To summarize, these various Russells (who until the genealogy work isdone to show the connections should be viewed as individuals -- not a group)have been prominent members of the Illuminati, the Masons, the Fabians, theMormons, the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Jesuits, the Royal Society, and the Mediacontrolled by those of the New World Order, and a deputy chairman of the FederalReserve. Typically they have been merchants and lawyers, with a fair share ofthem also as Christian heretics. It will be easier perhaps to illustrate how theRussells keep popping up in the New World Order story line by listing a goodsampling of them. Sample of Russells of InterestRussells Who Founded Fraternal Societies * William Huntington Russell - founder of what is believed to be an American chapter of the Illuminati (Skull & Bones Order).

They hold the title of Dukes of Bedford. Ordo W.Russell served in Lord Palmerston’s office from 1850-52. He served as unofficialambassador for Great Britain to the Vatican from 1857-70. His son Baron Ampthillwas Grand Master of the English Masons 1908-1935.

Russell- original investor in stock in the Mormon Deseret Manufacturing Co. which was intended to be an umbrella company for many earlyMormon Enterprises. * The Russell who opened a store with Mormon blessings in the newly created Salt Lake City. The store was called Miller, Russell & Co., a branch of Russell, Majors, & Waddell, and was a primary source of goods in the area of Utah.Other Russells * Baron Charles Russell (1832-1900)- Solicitor (Lawyer) in Ulster and advocate for Ireland. * Jerome Russell a Greyfriar, burned in 1539 for heresy with John Kennedy in Glasgow, Scot. * Philemon R. Russell- editor of the Christian Herald & Journal, in the Mar. 19, 1840 issue he stressed 2,520 years in prophecy, which was an idea C. T. Russell would later pick up and promote. * William Howard Russell- first war correspondent for London’s The Times newspaper in 1854. The London Times has long been part of the World Order, that William was the first of his kind is quite significant.Notes * Michels, Robert. Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy. (orig. 1915) reprint: New York: Free Press, 1962, p. 70. * This author has collaborated the connection of the Mormon leadership to the Satanic bloodlines and the Priere de Sion through several independent sources. One descendent of Joseph Smith who took part in Satanic rituals has been willing to tell about the family’s occult history. A Christian who was once part of the Satanic hierarchy who ran verbal instructions to the Mormon First Presidency from the Council of 13 collaborates their connections. The historical roots, even those that the Mormon leaders themselves have printed, expose the genealogical ties to some of the most powerful occult bloodlines. * This subject is very controversial. One of the few books even willing to touch the subject in a scholarly Biblical manner is Crawford, Jarah B. Last Battle Cry, Christianity’s Final Conflict with Evil. Knoxville, TN: Jann Publishing, 1986. Although I don’t concur with all of Crawford’s conclusions, the book shows more than enough evidence to support the point superscripted confidential source personally involved with it. * The documentation to show that the drug war is a contrived scheme is extensive. I have chosen to place some of the documentation much further back, but will state that several researchers give seminars exposing it in detail. The Vietnam War was an important part of the scheme and since then some of the recent important laws passed to implement this contrived war are P.L. 99-570, P.L. 100-690, and the Omnibus crime bill in 1991. * Marilyn Ferguson, New Age writer, states in her famous book The Aquarian Conspiracy, p. 90, \"LSD gave a whole generation a religious experience. But chemical satori is perishable, its effects too overwhelming to integrate into everyday life. Non-drug psycho-technologies offer a controlled, sustained movement toward that spacious reality. The annals of The Aquarian Conspiracy are full of accounts of passages: LSD to Zen, LSD to India, psilocybin to psychosynthesis.\" * Victims of Satanism have disclosed information about some of the extent of Satanism within the rank and file Jehovah’s Witnesses, and hierarchy. When it became obvious that the art department of the Watchtower Society has been hiding Satanic symbols in the pictures of Watchtower publications for many years the Governing Body chose to cover it up rather than stop it. * Sutton, Antony.

T. presidents wereunconnected to each other. Another supposition that was questionable was thatthe WT Society did not have a hidden agenda.C.T. Russell’s StoryOnce there was a Jewish family whose name was Roessel. They lived in early 17thcentury Germany. They moved to a country called Scotland. There they re-spelledthe name Russell. They took on the ways of their new homeland. The English triedto settle Protestants from Scotland in Ireland in order to control the Irish.When the opportunity opened up to go to the Emerald Island (Ireland) with theScottish settlers who went to the plantation Ulster they went. It is possible,but not known for sure that they learned to know the Rutherfords either inScotland or Ireland. Scotland repeatedly appears as the source of much of thereligious heresy connected with the Power. That C. T. Russell’s family were inScotland for a period, and also from the German states which seem to be a hotbed for Jewish Satanism may be only a coincidence and then again it might be aclue to understanding the origin of the Watchtower Society. This Author’sprevious book The Watchtower and the Masons tells the story how the Arian heresybegan at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland and spread to the Presbyteriansof the Synod of Ulster. The book gives this Author’s reasons for believing thatthe C. T. Russell’s family in northern Ireland were Arian in belief beforecoming to the U. S. and chances are they were involved with Freemasonry also.The Ackley ConnectionIn The Watchtower and the Masons the early history of C. T. Russell is given.Charles and his father married two Ackley sisters a number of years afterCharles’ mother died. What is an intriguing item is that C. T. Russell’smother’s will indicates she owned land in Iowa. A description of that land showsit was north of the town of Ackley, Iowa. It turns out that a man named WilliamAckley had purchased the land in that area, and had sold it in large part toScot-Irish settlers of the Presbyterian faith as they were coming to America. Atthe time C T. Russell’s mother died a town named Ackley had been staked out in1857, but the Civil War had interfered with construction plans. A Presbyteriancongregation had been formed in the area during the early 1860s in the Ackleyarea, which indicates some settlers had arrived. What connection did theRussells have with the Ackleys years before Charles T. and his father marriedAckley sisters? Who are the Ackleys? Maria Ackley, who was Charles T. Russell’swife, was well-educated and an excellent writer. Interestingly, in the 19thcentury she believed a socialist revolution was coming. She wrote, \"This greatrevolution has not yet come, but where is the statesman or the intelligentcitizen that does not see it coming?\" (Russell, Maria. This Gospel of TheKingdom, p. 26.) She was the ghost writer and ghost editor for much of herhusband Charles Taze’s work. Her family was well-off. William Ackley, the landspeculator/seller in Iowa, traces his ancestry back to Prence Doane andElizabeth Godfrey. Elizabeth Godfrey in turn was the great-granddaughter ofWilliam Brewster of the Mayflower fame. The Ackleys were Puritans to begin withand seem to have been concentrated in the Connecticut area, and from there theirfamily members moved out into NY and PA. Another Ackley (1832-1881) at that timewas Richard Thomas Ackley, a Freemason who worked for the Miller, Russell andCompany store in Salt Lake City in 1858 soon after the Mormons built Salt LakeCity.LeadsOf course, these are all simply tantalizing leads for the investigator butnothing solid. There seems to be much more to Charles Taze Russell than thelittle that the public has been told. In the next few chapters we will attemptto dispel some of the mystery surrounding the man.God’s \"Anointed Seed\"In 1852, the Joseph Lyttle Russell family had a baby who they gave the same nameto as his uncle had. This baby, named Charles Taze Russell had a brother Frankwho was two years older, but Charles ended up the favorite of his father. LaterCharles would get a sister Margaret M. Both Charles T. and his sister Margaretspoke on various occasions that his had been chosen before his birth for thework that he was to carry out.1 Margaret referred to her brother as the greatestman alive \"a giant unmatched.\" She stated that he had been chosen for hisreligious work before his birth. Perhaps, Charles’ Russell family, and hisfather Joseph L., (like Joseph Kennedy who had goals for his son to bepresident) had goals for Charles. If Charles had been encouraged to meet suchexpectations and had gone forward, then that could account for his sister’sgreat admiration for him. He had fulfilled her father’s wishes. At thePut-In-Bay Convention his sister Margaret had outlined how God planned and choseher brother. First God had planted a seed with the early church. But the seedhad laid dormant for centuries. \"In due time\", she says, the seed of truth grewand was watered according to God’s plan. During the Dark Ages the seed of truthwas barely kept alive waiting for God’s Chosen One to bring it to fruition. Whenit was time, God \"anointed the eyes\" of her brother at age 17, and \"God’s smileof favor rested upon him.\" Margaret said her brother was the one, the faithfulone who God could depend upon, the \"one despite the burden and heat of the day\"would remain faithful to God.

Another part of this is WackenhutWorld Technologies, Inc. or WWT Inc. Wackenhut operates worldwide. Theirheadquarters are in Florida. They have branch offices even in places likePortland, Oregon. Wackenhut handles all Intelligence-related and super-secretwork classified “ULTRA” for the US. worldwide. They are the ones who guard theUFO bases topside, along with the CIA’s Delta Teams, and various MP units, etc.Their branch in Las Vegas provides security for the Groom Lake UFO facility. LasVega’s Review Journal on Fri. 7/26/91, p. A1 & 3A had an article about 3Wackenhut agents who lost their lives in a helicopter crash near the Groom Lake.The telephone number to Wackenhut World Technologies connects first through theRussell Trust - it is 702-646-4406, and it will be answered by the RussellTrust. Wackenhut’s board of directors are CIA, FBI Div. 5, NSA, ISA, and NROofficials. The girls who answer the various local Wackenhut Corporation numbersare not in the know about what Wackenhut Wd. Tech. is all about. Their 1-800 #is 929-2431. Their San Reme Ave, Cerel Gabels, FL 33146 # was 305-666-5656.Their local no. here is 256-3996, and one of their local CA # is 714-9794966.George Russell Wackenhut is their security services executive. He is also theChrm & Chief Exec. Officer. He worked for the FBI, and is a Christian Scientist.Richard Russell Wackenhut is the President & Chief Oper. Officer. Wackenhut hasin the neighborhood of 40,000 employees.Moriah & the Mormon LeadershipThe Top 13 Families & The Mormon LeadershipRather than having an article this time about an individual family-and we willreturn later to our articles on the 13 top families, Lord willing, -this articleis an article about the 13 families in general.ContentIn the first part of this article we will deal with actual people. In the secondpart of this article, we will discuss some about the top secret, inner workingsof the Satanic religion that the top 13 Illuminati families participate in.Part 1.One of the things that the Illuminati has done is instill apathy in peopletoward resisting their wickedness. A letter by an ex-Mormon says it better thanI could,\"There are many reasons why these people (Mormons) will not come forth eventhough they know of the corruption in the Mormon Church. One is due to theirbelief in Mormon scripture which they associate with the Mormon Church. Theleadership has usurped power and authority over this scripture. Thus, themembers of the Mormon Church think that God expects them to support theirmisguided leaders. This is much the - rationalization that many Americans makeabout our government. They all know of the corruption, but rationalize that itis unpatriotic to talk against the government or ungrateful to complain whenthey enjoy superficial prosperity.\"It is interesting that this Mormon recognizes that the process of the commonman’s reaction is the same to both Mormon and American leadership, because as wewill discuss the top leadership in both the reader will learn they are relatedto each other and both under the control of the Top 13 Illuminati families.The Mormon Leaders & the 13th Top Illuminati BloodlineThe Mormon president Ezra Taft Benson (considered a prophet by Mormons) was afan of the John Birch Society. Most people who have not read my exposes on boththe Mormon Church and the John Birch Society will not be able to protectthemselves from the Illuminati. I don’t expose these organizations without agreat deal of proof. I say this because I know from too many sources and toomany angles that both organizations were initiated and have been run by theIlluminati. The Mormon Church has long prophesied that they would defend theU.S. Constitution in the last days. They are moving to fulfill that with menlike Bo Gritz, who sprinkles has talks with buzz words from Mormon prophecy. TheJohn Birch Society was part of the process of the Hegelian dialectics of thecold war. They pretend to be the defenders of the people against the New WorldOrder, but they are fake opposition. (I have met quite a few John Birchers, andso far although they claim to be against the New World Order, they want nothingto do with me, or to learn anything 1 might share with them. I can understandthe leadership doing this to me, but somehow the rank and file has picked up onsome of the attitudes of the leadership. I don’t know how the JBS has managed todo that, but the antagonistic attitudes that they have instilled in their peopletoward people like myself are amazing.) In my Be Wise As Serpents book I gavethe genealogical evidence to show that the Mormon leadership connected to the13th top illuminati family, the Holy Blood line of what purports to be Jesus’slineage. I’ve also showed numerous other connections between the Mormon leadersand the elite Illuminati bloodlines. Ezra Taft Benson’s genealogy helps tietogether some of the various parts of the Illuminati beast. The Taft is Heusen’sname is because Ezra Taft Benson is a descendent of Alphonso Taft, who alongwith one of the Russell family (Russells are one of the top 13 families),William IL Russell, started the Order of the Skull and Bones (legally it hasbeen known as Russell Trust). Remember, that George Bush was a Skull & Bonesman.George Bush also is a descendent of the 13th top Illuminati family -the familythat ties in with British royalty and the Merovingians. The man who just beatGeorge Bush in the Presidential race, William Jefferson Blythe Clinton, is adescendent of some Russells.President ClintonThis newsletter hasn’t gotten to an individual article on the Russell family,but they go way back in the Illuminati. The Russell’s are responsible forstarting the Skull & Bones Order, the Pilgrim Society, the Watchtower Bible &Tract Society, and the Masonic Daughters of Isabella (DOI). Archibald D. Russell(1811-1871) a Mason from Scotiand set up still other organizations. (Scotlandhas played a key role in the Illuminati. One example of thousands is, MarrinerS. Eccles - Gov. of the Fed. Reserve Board & supporter of FDR, who is member ofthe wealthy Mormon Illuminati Eccles family which came over from Scotland.) TheRussells played a key role in the opium trade in the early 1800s and earlyMormonism. One of the Russell business partners was Warren Delano, Jr., chief ofRussell and Company operations in Canton, China. Delano was the grandfather ofPres. Franklin Roosevelt. The Russell and Company logo was a Skull and Bones.The Taft family (which is also related to George Bush by blood) and the Harrimanfamily are two families that have been intimately connected to the Skull andBones Order (which is an entry point into the Illuminati and on the surface justan exclusive fraternity).Note: [Since this was written Bo Gritz and the Mormon church have gone separateways. Bo Gritz, under the direction of his CIA handier, has been moving aroundtalking to Patriots, and establishing a community called “Almost Heaven” nearKamiah, ID. Fritz’s newsletters have had several articles about Bo Gritz,including one entitled S.P.I.K.E., which is what Bo calls the training he isgiving people.]The Harriman family is also very prominent in Pres. Bill Clinton’s life. AverellHarriman1 was the CEO of George Bush’s father’s company. Averell Harriman’s wifewas Pamela who has played an extremely important part in Bill Clinton’s life.Pamela Harriman raised more money for the Democratic Party than any other singleperson (Newsweek, 5/15/1987). She created a political action committee nicknamedPAM PAC. When Bill Clinton lost his race for governor, Pamela made BIB Clintonhead (chairman) of her PAM PAC. (It took Brian Quig, a Christian researcher likemyself, to expose the connections between Bill Clinton and Pamela Harriman. Canyou guess why the establishment media somehow carefully kept their relationshipsecret?) When Bill Clinton was a high schooler he shook hands with PresidentJohn F. Kennedy (a member of one of the Top 13 Illuminati Bloodlines-see 5/15/93Newsletter). The master of ceremonies at the affair where JFK and Clinton metwas Winthrop Rockefeller (another member of a Top 13 Illuminati family, and atthe time Governor of New York.) In the film clips of this event which theestablishment media have used recently, the establishment media edited outWinthrop Rockefeller from the scenes of Clinton and JFK. (Now why do you thinkthey did that?) The Astor family (one of the top 13 families) was intimatelyconnected to the creation of the Rhodes Scholarship. (See 1/1/93 newsletter onthe Astor family). Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar and looked upto Prof. CarrollQuigley, the archivist of the CFR, as a mentor. The Quigley-Clinton connectionintroduces more connections between Clinton and the Illuminati. Quigleyside-tracked people by making people think the elite were Anglophiles who wantedthe British to rule the world. Although the elite are partial to the Englishlanguage as a lingua-franca, in their heart their allegiance is not to Britainbut to Satan. Clinton has been compared to JFK and FDR by people, perhaps in anegative sense the comparison is appropriate. Let’s review some of the items which stuck out as red flags to me about BillClinton: * Several ex-witches now Christians identified Clinton’s running mate Al Gore as switch. Al Gore’s book promotes several witchcraft themes such as Mother Gain worship. Senator Al Gore has intimately worked with other men who are Illuminati for years. Al Gore was close friends with Armand Hammer, the Illuminati courier who shuttled back and forth between Moscow and America on a regular basis, and had homes in both countries. Hammer bankrolled both Al Gore, Jr. and his father Al Gore, Sr. * Al Gore and Bill Clinton raised their hands at the Democratic National Convention and declared that their administration would be the \"New Covenant.\" Bill Clinton’s brother ended up in prison in connection to the illegal drug trade that I know that Bill Clinton was also involved with helping while he was Governor of Arkansas. Readers of this newsletter are aware that the top Illuminati families are the power behind the drug trade. (See previous newsletter 3/1/93, p. 19 about some of Bill’s role in Arkansas with the drug trade.) * Bill Clinton’s chief campaign advisor James Carville is pictured in People’s Magazine. p. 50 wearing a pentagram in the middle of his forehead. * Bill Clinton calls his first press conference as President. elect according to the astrologically correct full-moon day. Bill Clinton in his inaugural speech said, \"This ceremony is held in the depthof winter. But, by the words we speak and the faces we show the world, we forcethe spring.” Clinton repeated the words “we force the spring” later in thespeech. That expression is a very unusual expression. To “force the spring\" iswitchcraft language. in witchcraft and Satanism Lucifer (Baal) rises from theunderworld on May 1st (also known by the following list of names Beltane, amajor European holiday, Communism and the Illuminati’s chief holiday, andWalpurgis). The May 1st rising brings forth the season of fertility, which thewitches each year take credit for, by claiming that their magic rituals ‘forcethe spring.’ The ritual magic that ‘forces the spring’ is done on 3 Sabbats-thefirst is Imbolg (also known by names: Candlemas by the Catholics and Ground HogDay by common dupes); the second is the vernal equinox (Mar. 20) in which bloodand sex rituals are carried out and the third is Beltane (May 1) in which firefestivals are done. This is one of the fire festivals which people around theUnited States tell me they have witnessed from a distance. Witches believe thaton May 1st, the female force completes her takeover from the male force. Thereare 12 cabinet members which when they assemble with their head Bill Clintonmake the number 13. Bill Clinton choose “to force the spring” with his “cabinetcoven.” In true witchcraft tradition, the Cabinet of Bill Clinton followed thepattern of “forcing the spring.” In order for the female to overtake the maleforce, Clinton chose the position of Attorney General. The title “General” has amale connotation. All the rest of the cabinet members are called “Secretaries”which has a female connotation. The Attorney General position was to be given toa woman. But in order for the witchcraft ceremony and timing to be right, thewoman couldn’t take over until after Feb. 2, or Imbolg and there had to be 3female candidates, from which one is traditionally picked by a witchcraft coven.This is why the selection of the Attorney General was not confirmed until Feb.2. And sure enough all three candidates given by Bill Clinton were women, fromwhich one was selected. Bill Clinton did indeed “force the spring!” Further,Clinton gave told us HOW he would ‘force the spring’ in his inaugural speech. Onthe 666th word of his inauguration speech, Clinton launched into a sentence onsacrifice, “it will not be easy; it will require sacrifice. But it can be done,and done fairly, not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for our own sake.”Clinton gave the hand signal of Satanists at the end of his speech. (Seeprevious newsletters this year). And Newsweek magazine headlined its story “NewAge President Takes Office.” (Jan. 25, ’93) That Clinton would consider hisCabinet a coven is not so farfetched. Most of his cabinet tie in closely withthe Illuminati. The Council on Foreign Relations is an upper level of thevisible arm of the Illuminati. The Jan. ‘93 newsletter explained that the CFRwas the equivalent of the 4° of the Bavarian Illuminati. Note, that many ofthese people do not realize the full Satanic implications of what they are in.If one reviews the various levels of the Bavarian Illuminati, you will realizethat the process of corruption was gradual, and that the lower levels had noidea what they were really involved in, although some probably suspected whatthey were into. The basic ingredient of the lower levels is loyalty to theirsuperiors, because they believe they are in the elite’s organization. Consider,Clinton and his cabinet: Slick Willie Clinton — CFR TC (Trilateral Commission),Bldrbgr (Bilderberger participant), participant in various Illuminati frontorganizations such as DLC, Rhodes Scholar, wife Hillary is known to practiceshamanism witchcraft. * Treasury Secretary - Lloyd Bentsen -- Bldrbgr, ex-CFR, connected to S&L scandal, henchman for the Illuminati. * Secretary of Health & Human Services—Donna Shalala - CFR,, TC, close friend of Hillary Clinton. * Secretary of Defense—Les Aspin--CFR, Socialist Les Aspin chose for his top assistant the pro-communist Jew Morton Halperin. Halperln was also a dir. of the ACLU, and worked loyally for Henry Kissinger at the National Security Council. * Secretary of State—Warren Christopher--CFR * Secretary of the Interior - Bruce Babbitt — CFR, he has been involved in various activities for the elite. * Secretary of Labor—Robert Reich -- a Zionist Jew (over 50% of Clinton’s major appointees were Zionist Jews, strange considering Jews only make up 2% of the population) * Attorney General — Janet Reno -- murderer of innocent people at Waco, TX. The people at Waco believed that they were the true Jews and flew the Jewish flag at Waco, notice that Reno who is Jewish and was on the board of directors of the Jewish Illuminati Terrorist organization of the Anti-Defamation League could not stand the idea of Christians believing that they are the true Jews. * Secretary of Housing & Urban Development - Henry Cisveros - CFR * Secretary of Education - Richard W. Riley - participant at Renaissance Weekend (I think the readers get the picture. I had a list of which ones were known tobe gay, but I can’t find it.) A number of Clinton’s high appointees arehomosexuals. There is a high correlation between homosexuality and the occultand also a big correlation between the type of “Jews” Clinton has chosen andSatanism. Historically, some of the most rabid anti-Christians are Satanistsfrom Jewish backgrounds.During the inauguration week witches, homosexuals and homosexual witchesgathered at the White House for various celebrations, to perform, to holdrituals, and other events. These people were invited by the President forvarious things. Clearly, those who are known publicly as a witch or a homosexualare considered honorable by the President.What Is the Spiritual Significance of the Clintons?The answer to this can be found in my very first newsletter back in 1992.Whenever YHVH God has raised up prophets (like Elijah) to turn the people backto God and morality, Satan has sent out the Jezebel spirit. Along with theJezebel spirit goes the Ahab spirit. Hillary and Bill fit the Jezebel and Ahabspirit exactly. I remember personally when I heard several prophets of God warnabout the Jezebel spirit. I thought this sounds rather strange. I had neverheard about it before. Soon I began telling people in the church I was attendingabout the NWO and to function in a small way prophetically, and the Jezebelspirit came into that church. The church had been happy with their elders, butafter I began to warn the people about the NWO, a constant clamor was heardevery Sunday for the church to select women as elders. This church had a longhistory without believing in women elders, and it had never been an issue.Unless one is aware of the connection between the Jezebel spirit and the Elijahtype of prophet, and knows the full orb of what the Jezebel spirit is, it is notlikely that a person would notice the connection between the two! Baal worshipwas simply an ancient form of Satanism. Jezebel was the daughter of King Ethbaalof Tyre who was an ardent Baal worshipper. Jezebel was a Satanic High Priestess,a real witch. She had 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the groves. Sheput the true ministers of God to death. Her husband used his political office asshe directed to further the power of darkness. We are simply now seeing historyrepeat itself.Part 2.In this part we will explain sealing rituals. I am doing this so that Christianscan understand who a Keeper of Seals is, and also so that Christians canunderstand that Mormonism is closer to Satanism than it is to Christianity. Thisarticle will hopefully provide a written record so that Christians have anobjective way to determine If someone who claims to be an ex-Satanist really is.I realize that some Christians don’t like to learn about their enemy, and thatis fine if they do not want to read this. On the other hand, I see people whoare coming out of Satanism who the Christians are disbelieving. The Christianshave no reference from which to determine whether someone is legitimate or not.And although I believe the Spirit of God is an excellent revealer of men, I haveto be frank, even the best of Christians sometimes don’t hear what the Spirithas to say, and could benefit from a written explanation. The closestdescriptions of sealing rituals that I have found that matches the descriptionsof Satanic hierarchy rituals from people who have come out of the SatanicHierarchy are the Mormon sealing rituals. For anyone wanting to do a study abouthow Mormonism is witchcraft, I just they read the scholarly book written by aMormon scholar Early Mormonism and the Magic World View by D. Michael Quinn.Quinn conclusively shows that early Mormonism was based on magic and witchcraft.Quinn, who is a Mormon in good standing, tries to point out in the book thatthese things can’t be held against Mormonism because most everyone back in theearly 1800s practiced magic and witchcraft. Whether most people did or not,seems to me to be irrelevant as to whether it is O.K. Another great book showingthe connections between the Mormon Temple ceremonies, Witchcraft rituals, andMasonic rituals is Bill Schnoebelen’s book Mormonism Temple of Doom. Bill doesan excellent job of showing and illustrating how the Mormon temple ceremony,Masonic and Witchcraft rituals are simply the very same thing, with minorvariations. One of the most important things in Satanism is sealing. Everythingis sealed. One doesn’t hear the term sealing used a lot. I have read many booksof the enemy to know how he thinks, and it is rare to have someone mentionsealing. I had to learn about it from ex-Satanists. If one leaves off studyingSatanism and begins studying the many cults and religions, one begins hearingabout sealing again when one gets to Mormonism. Mormon men and women (contraryto Lk 20:35) are sealed to each other in the Mormon temple marriages. The earlyMormons were sealed to many spouses. The Mormon sealing is very similar to whatis done in witchcraft called “handfasting,” and it is also similar to marriagesealing in Satanism. Joseph Smith, whose family practiced witchcraft, had manytypes of seals around their house which were used in magic. According to a magicbook of 1830 Demonology and Witchcraft by Walter Scott (pp. 165, 220-221) seerstones were to be anointed with oil, and sealed with holy characters. In 1837,Mormon leaders performed such a magical sealing for James Cohn Brewster.(Mormonism and the Magic World View. p.209-210) Joseph Smith had a cane with aserpent on the top of it, and astrological seals below. Magic staff or canes areimportant in Satanism. The seal of Mars was carved on the Smith family scepterwhich was used by the family to draw circles for magic incantations. (Mormonism& the Magic World View p. 142) In 1835, a ritual done by Joseph Smith to communewith a spirit messenger is recorder by Oliver Cowdery. Joseph Smith used twoSeals of the Earth to conjure up the spirit. (Ibid, p. 120) Smith’s ritual wasin accordance with the best occult guidebooks then The Book of Knowledge andBarrett’s Magus.The 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon says that about itself “... their voiceshall be as one that hath a familiar spirit ... They shall write the thingswhich shall be done among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in abook.’ (2 Nephi 26:14-17). The Mormon scholar Quinn writes,“The Book of Mormon’s use of the word ‘sealed’ also suggested a magic context.Isaiah 29 uses the word ‘sealed’ only twice, but the Book of Mormon’s commentaryon the chapter uses ‘sealed’ eleven times in eight verses (2 Ne 26:17; 2 Ne27:7-8 ... Throughout the entire text, the Book of Mormon refers to itself withthe words ‘sealed’ or ‘seal’ more than twenty times .. Modern Mormons have oftenpictured a physical seal ... but the Book of Mormon nowhere describes a physicalseal, evoking instead the seal as a non-material restriction: ‘For the bookshall be sealed by the power of God.’ (2 Ne [phi] 27:10)”Quinn goes on to describe more about the magical sealing of the Book of Mormon. 33° Masonic leader Manly P. Hail in his book on Masonic symbols describes a sealinvolved with black magic and the Pact that is made with a conjured demon in asection entitled “Modus Operandi for the Invocation of Spirits” on p. CIII.Within both the Generational Satanic covens and the covens made up of recruitsto Satanism there is the office of Keeper of Seals. The Keepers of Seals showthe importance of sealing to Satanism. Almost everything done in Satanisminvolves sealing. There are many vows that are made, and there are alwaysexchanges made during these vows and then a sealing. In the exchanges there isalways something lost by each person. Satanic Hierarchy individuals are sealedto others, and the part of a Satanist that is put into another is magicallyinfused. In one ritual, there is a black stone with the Satanist’s name writtenon it that is given to the Queen Mother. (See the chart 1/1/93 newsletter tounderstand this high rank.) By giving something of oneself, that item supposedlygives magical power to the person you have vowed before. If you break your vow,they can take the item you have given and work destructive magic against you. Inthe Satanic Hierarchy, they have a Moonchild ceremony where they demonize thefetus while in the womb. In the Anti-Christ ceremony, the item that is exchangewith Satan for a woman’s vow to Satan is to sacrifice her child. Then of coursethis vow is sealed. The Keepers of Seals hold the books full of written pacts,and the items exchanged in all these countless rituals.Does The Satanic Hierarchy Have Tesla’s Invention?A Mother of Light said,“Power is a transitory experience... it is very conditioned upon the myths youare in. It is important that the person knows the myth be is in. He must have afeeling for it ....The tangible can become the intangible.”I’ll leave the reader puzzled how I got this quote from a Mother of Light, butthe idea of the tangible becoming the intangible is an interesting idea, becauseof two reasons. First, the United States Navy is reported to have found out inW.W.II in the Philadelphia experiment how to electronically make a force fieldaround something that makes the object invisible. However, the experiment provedto be very dangerous, and it took them years before the technology could beapplied to something safely. This technology is being used on the Stealth bomberto make them both invisible to radar and to human sight. The second reason isthat an ex-Illuminati member states that an experimental box the size of abreadbox with controls was being used by the coven to make people invisible. Thepeople had to stay where they were, they could not move around, but they weresomehow made invisible by the box where they were standing.Likewise, those who want to believe that Clinton is a nice guy, that he isn’tworking as a lackey of the Illuminati, go ahead and believe these lies, God willeven send you a strong delusion to allow you to believe these lies. But thosewho love the truth, and are tired of being lied to, and want answers as to whythings are happening like they are will not accept the surface explanations thatcover the debauchery of Satanists. Instead of getting upset that someone likemyself is showing you the double meaning behind Clinton’s hand signal--peopleshould be upset that an attempt was made to trick them by Clinton. The Christianpeople have been told by several Christians (and I could name names but I won’t)that Clinton is going to lead this nation into righteousness. God’s peopleperish for lack of knowledge. The fact is that if Clinton really came to Christ,and really began leading the people toward righteousness, (which he doesn’t evennow lead the people-the people who put him in office do the real leading), thenthe hierarchy would kill him. Christians are always saying we need to pray forour leaders--fine pray for them, they need to find God, just realize Clinton isnot one of our real leaders, he is way down on the totem pole and is simply ashoe-shine boy for the hierarchy. Maybe the Christian people ought to learn whoreally leads them so they can pray better! Bush was a heavy-weight for theIlluminati, and he was picked by the Illuminati originally as their first choiceto win. That was before the primaries. Of course all the final presidentialcandidates Bush, Perot, and Clinton, (and maybe some of the others too!) wereIlluminati men. It was a choice on their part who they wanted. Bush apparentlyantagonized the Rothschilds, and Clinton was placed into power to appease thosewho were upset with Bush. That the elite decided to change from Bush to Clintonbecame visible in Sept. and in October I notified my readers that the change ofchoice had occurred. Supposedly Bush had mishandled something that hurt theRothschilds financially, but whatever happened, it is clear that behind thescenes some big events happened. Clinton was close friends of WinthropRockefeller when he moved to Arkansas. Winthrop Rockefeller gave Clinton over $1million dollars. In return Clinton was in his pocket. It has been well worthClinton’s time to serve the Illuminati kings. So good in fact that Ace Hayes maybe correct when he claims that he has information showing that Clinton owns $1.2billion in treasury bonds. If so, then it is understandable that Clinton wouldwant taxes collected. I had hoped that my photo of Clinton giving the Satanicsignal at the inauguration would be finished by now. It isn’t, but I will goahead with this article. Since coming out with my Mar. 15, 93 newsletter I havefound out that Texe Marrs came out with a photo showing Clinton’s satanicsignaling at the inauguration. People need to spiritually discern what Clintonis all about.Clinton gave a speech before becoming president that “insiders\" would have noplace in his administration. If people study the situation his appointments haveall been insiders. This is just one example of many that show that the wordsClinton speaks are simply the words that the American people want to hear.\"Slick Willie\" is an appropriate name, for this President has absolutely nointegrity nor honesty. And yet I am hearing people in the churches that want tobelieve in Clinton. It’s sad to say they want this, because God will send them astrong delusion to believe the lies they want to believe in. Federico Pena isour new Clinton-appointed Secretary of Transportation. If he treats the countrylike he treated Denver watch out. Pena got the new Denver International Airportproject continued against all logic. John Coleman’s WIR brings out in hisnewsletter the details about how Pena’s airport project and many other projectshe sponsored are white elephants that are not what the public needs, but simplywhite elephants that help line the pockets of the rich. Those of you who don’ttake Texe Marrs’ newsletter may find it interesting that Bill Clinton has tiesto the Jesuits. Of course, I take it for granted that people realize thatCarroll Quigley was Clinton’s mentor. Carroll Quigley was one of thoseintellectuals like H.G. Wells who believed in a New World Order and the elitethat wanted to bring it in. Let me digress, and discuss men like H.G. Wells andCarroll Quigley. These men believed that the west should lead the world into aNew World Order. I suggest that people should read H.G. Wells’ book The NewWorld Order (1940) and his The Open Conspiracy (1928). Another good book tounderstand what the elite have planned is Manly P. Hall’s book Facing theFuture. Oswald Spengler also has a good book to read The Hour of Decision. Thelast few chapters of Lionel Curtess’s World Order (1939) also is good inexplaining how they want a world commonwealth of states. People like Clintonwere feed this type of stuff. But there is a much greater hidden agenda. ManlyP. Hall for instance was part of Lucis Trust, as was late leader of the ScottishRite Freemasons, as well as Rockefeller. Lucis Trust’s External visitation ofthe Hierarchy tells us what the agenda is. The agenda is to externalize theSatanic Hierarchy, and on page 107 of Externalisation of the Hierarchy it tellsus who will rule the world on the earthly plane--his name is Lucifer. And on theSpiritual level (shambala) it will be the Lord of the World Sanat. We Christiansknow the Lord of the World not as Sanat but as Satan. It’s all down in black andwhite on page 107. Greed and material wealth play such an important part in thelives of all these people who Satan has inspired to help dream up schemes for aNew World Order. Therefore, most of these people see economics as an importantvehicle for creating a New World Order. But there is a hidden agenda. Theconspiracy is neither an economic conspiracy nor a political conspiracy but asThe Externalisation of the Hierarchy reveals in page after page--theirconspiracy is a religious conspiracy. People, let’s just lay it out on theline--Clinton is a Satanist, he knows what the hidden agenda is. It’s aneye-opener to read the books I listed by Wells, Hall, and Spengler, but believeme that stuff is just for the blind intellectuals. The real details of this NewWorld Order have been written down in detail and they came directly from theMaster of Evil himself, directly from Satan to his hierarchy, who copied theplans in detail. The people who will implement the New World Order are men likeClinton. Men who have no moral code. Men who will glibly tell one lie afteranother. They won’t implement H.G. Well’s plan---they will implement Satan’splan. And prideful Satan will unwittingly implement YHWH God’s."},{"pageContent":" The Van Duyn BloodlineIn 1626, Peter Minuit traded some trinkets to the Canarsie Indians to purchaseManhattan Island. The history books like to report the value of the trinkets as$24. The purchase was supposedly a good deal for the Dutch. The Canarsie Indiansdidn’t own Manhattan Island, it belonged to other Indians, so it is debatablewho got the best deal that day. That was the beginning of the Dutch colony ofNew Netherlands, and its capital New Amsterdam, built beside Ft. Amsterdam, allthree later renamed New York. The Van Duyn family (also spelled Van Dien, VanDuyne, et. al.) was one of the Dutch families to come over to the Dutch colonyof New Netherlands which was connected to the Dutch West India Company. Otherearly important New Netherlands families from the Netherlands include Van Sise,Van Cleef (also spelled Van Cleve and Van Cleave), Van Coorn, Van de Water,Dooren, and Stoothoff. In 1649, fifteen years before the British took NewNetherlands from the Dutch, Gerret Cornellissen Van Duyn immigrated with hisolder sister from Brabant, Netherlands (Brabant is a district so. of Eindhovenin southern Netherlands, but at the time Van Duyn came over it includedBelgium.) to New Amsterdam. (This date is according to Claypool, Edward A.Descendants of Dennis Van Duyn and Alice Tunison Chicago, IL. In contrast tothis The National Cyclopaedia Vol. 4?, p. 258 states that he came over in 1640which is a mistake because that was his date of birth.)For some reason, Gerret Cornelius Van Duyn returned to Holland to Zwolle on theeast side of the Zuider Zee, although he had originally lived in Nieuwkerk inZeeland before going to New Netherlands, America. Gerrit C. Van Duyn was acoarse, non-spiritual, ignorant man who did carpenter work. His lack of interestin Christianity seems to have carried down through quite a number ofgenerations. After coming to the New World again, he moved away from NewAmsterdam fairly quickly to New Utrecht. (Now I believe that is where GreenwichVillage is.) In the long run his descendants (some related to the Castellofamily) moved to Michigan, Illinois, Kansas and elsewhere. In the next centuryhowever, his descendants moved and created 5 branches- one in Queens Co., NY;one in Kings Co., NY; one in Duchess Co., NY; a fourth in Somerset Co., NJ; anda fifth in Morris Co., NJ. It is possible a few other Van Duyns also emigratedfrom the Netherlands to America; information on the family is scarce. In Germanythe privilege to use the title ‘von’ was a special noble privilege. I believethe same applied in the Netherlands, which would mean that the Van Duyns were aprominent family when they came over. The low profile of the family didn’t endwhen they arrived in the New World, it continues. The extremely low profile ofthe Van Duyns makes one wonder if they could really be one of the top 13families. Still Mona Van Duyn was the first woman poet laureate, a Pulitzerwinner (1991) and got a good review of her book in 1990 by the I have found thatsuch awards take a combination of both talent and pull, especially in a field assubjective as poetry, it helps to have pull. Where did Mona Van Duyn get thepolitical pull to get so many awards and many well promoted poetry books? Evenbefore the British had consolidated their hold on New Netherlands the area wasgiving a foreshadowing of what it would become. Pirates which raided the EastIndies and the Red Sea were outfitted in what is today New York and RhodeIsland. William Patterson (born c. 1655 in Scotland) was the evil genius behindthe establishment of the Bank of England. It is strongly believed that he was atrader in New York in 1668-69 and that prior to this he had worked with thepirate Morgan, who operated in the New Netherlands area. Witchcraft was part ofsome people’s lives in New Netherlands, but the colony was far more lenienttoward them than in the Puritan colony in Massachusetts. The last Dutch governorof New Netherlands, Gov. Peter Stuyvesant’s sister-in-law was suspected ofwitchcraft, but acquitted. Ralph Hall of Seatalcott, Long Island and his wifewere the only ones seriously tried of witchcraft in New Amsterdam and they wereacquitted. In 1687, the British had taken the New Netherlands from the Dutch forthe second and final time, and they made the Dutch take an oath of allegiance tothe British Crown. Three Van Duyns of New Amsterdam are recorded having takenthat oath. They were Gerrit Cornelis Van Duyn, Cornelis Gems Vanduyn, and DenijsGerrise Vanduyn. However, in the 1790 census taken in New York state, there areno Van Duyn families at all listed. One of the best books on the Van Duyn familyis New Netherlands Families by Wilson V. Ledley, Vol. 3 which is about the VanDuyn family. I obtained a copy of the Van Duyn part, which was able to assist mein my genealogy work. I count 378 Van Duyn’s in the fifth generation of VanDuyn’s in this country. Some of the families that the Van Duyn’s haveintermarried with are Ailing (Allen), Brendel, Bullinger, Graeber, Hayes,Kennedy, and Robertson. Some of the other families which are definitely Dutchwith which the family married with are the Van Burens, the Van Cleeves, and Vander Hoef. It would be exceedingly interesting to find out if the Van Duyn’sconnect at all with the Dutch King William of Orange or some of William ofOrange’s supporters. Many of today’s elite trace back to William of Orange orhis prominent supporters. The Van Duyn last name has ended up with manyspellings. For instance, in Bergen Co., NJ. the name is spelled Van Dyne, VanDuyn, VanDuyne, Van Dine, VanDine, & Van Dien. An informer states that Van Duynis one of the top 13 Illuminati families. If that is so, then it certainly isthe least known family of the thirteen. This article will show clues andevidence that have kept me from rejecting the possibility that the family isindeed one of the top thirteen. On the other hand, there are also some verypuzzling things about this family that almost disqualify it from being a topfamily. One puzzling thing is how rare this surname is. Considering that thename belonged to one of the earliest settlers in the New World one would expectquite a clan to have developed. But this is not so. Another puzzling thing isthat the conspiracy has a great deal of activity going on in Brussels, Belgium.Belgium is half Dutch, half French. Many of the people in Brussels have Dutchnames, and it would be expected that if the Van Duyn family were a top familythey would have someone in Brussels, but I wasn’t able to locate any there. Seethe reproduction of the Brussels phone book to show that some places have beennamed after the Van Duyns but none live there, although two Van Duynens arelisted.Van Duyns that Caught My EyeHistorically, there were a few Van Duyns that caught my attention: * Cornelis Van Duyn (1709-1779)--left an inheritance of 1,000 pounds of money to children. William Van Duyn (1695-1773)--left two plantations to children in his will * Aaron Van Duyn (1830- 1899)--trustee & deacon of the Meth. Episcopal church Alfred Voorhees Van Duyn (1843-??)--an undertaker of Middlebush, NJ * Harrison Van Duyn (1845-1914)--member of NJ legislature in 1879, became Speaker of the House in 1881, Scottish and York Rite Freemason, member of the Holland Society (see Holland Society Yearbook 1915), and numerous other business organizations and societies. * Horace N. Van Duyn--Stockholder in the Boston National Bank * Lewis Van Duyn-- Surveyor, organizer & president of Boonton Water Co., owned lots of real estate. * Simeon Van Duyn-- inventor, member Meth. Church in Boonton The Van Duyn name is known in Western United States because of Van Duynchocolate candies. The Van Duyn name has been well known in the New York area.The oldest of the large care centers for the elderly in NY is named after a VanDuyn. It was founded in 1827 at Syracuse, NY (Address is West Seneca Turnpike).This elderly care center, the Van Duyn Home and Hospital, was reported to have537 total regular staff, 136 nurses, and 526 licensed beds which are kept 99%occupied, making it the largest. I have very limited knowledge of the Van Duynfamily. Three Van Duyn’s are worthy of mention at this point. One Van Duyn wasreported by an NSA informant to have been the liaison officer between MI6, theCIA, Mossad, and the Vietnamese government during the 1960s. Another Van Duynwas the founder of a branch of Planned Parenthood, an important New Age groupwhich has been promoting sterilizations, birth control, abortions, etc. for overhalf a century. The third is Mona Jane Van Duyn who has authored several poetrybooks, and is a Guggenheim fellow.Edward Seguin Van Duyn & Planned ParenthoodEdward S. Van Duyn (1872 - 1955) was a prominent surgeon who was born inSyracuse, NY. He went to Princeton Univ. and then got his M.D. at SyracuseUniversity in 1897. From 1909 until 1950, he was a surgeon. During the ghastlyW.W. I, he was in the U.S. Army Medical Corps in France, first as a major andthen as a Lt. Colonel. Edward S. Van Duyn attended the Unitarian Church duringhis life--a church which has long been associated with Wicca. He also associatedwith the liberal Presbyterians. In 1933, he founded the Planned ParenthoodCenter of Syracuse, New York. Planned Parenthood Federation of America was anIlluminati inspired organization that was set up to accomplish severalobjectives. The organization’s own stated purpose is very revealing: \"To provideleadership m: making effective means of voluntary fertility regulation,including contraception, abortion, sterilization, and infertility services,available and fully accessible to all as a central element of reproductivehealth; stimulating and sponsoring relevant biomedical, socioeconomic, anddemographic research; developing appropriate information, education, andtraining programs to increase knowledge about human reproduction and sexuality.\"Planned Parenthood Federation of America has about 190 affiliated organizationsand actively promotes its agenda all over the world. It operates about 900centers in the U.S. It maintains a 5,000 volume library on abortion,sterilization, and population control. One of its leaders Alan F. Guttmachersigned the Humanist Manifesto, and the president Faye Wattleton was awarded\"Humanist of the year\" in 1986. Both hate Christians. Margaret Sanger, whoadvocated neo-Malthusian population controls, with money from her husband andrich backers, started the American Birth Control League (ABCL) in 1921. The ABCLopened up the Birth Control Research Bureau (BCCRB) in 1923. In 1939 the ABCLand another similar group merged to form the Birth Control Federation of America(BCFA) which in 1942 changed its name to Planned Parenthood Federation. Considerthe changes that have happened within our lifetimes. In 1957, birth controldevices were outlawed in all NY metropolitan hospitals. In 1969, the Federalgovernment was subsidizing abortions and birth control through the federalantipoverty program. In the 1980s, public schools started offering condoms andnew types of sex education programs for teenagers. The Schlesinger Library hasbeen actively keeping historical records of the \"family planning movement\" andDavid Kennedy wrote the book Birth Control in America: The Career of MargaretSanger in 1970. Much of what has happened in abortions, birth control research,and population control mechanisms has come as a result of these type oforganizations. I was curious -- what kind of people want us sterilized, ourbabies aborted, and the world’s population reduced? What kind of people arefunding the enormous amount of money it takes to get people to abort theirbabies? What does it cost to get a population to voluntarily neuter themselves?I randomly picked a year (1984) to research the funding for Planned Parenthoodand the Planned Parenthood branches. I was astounded at how huge the sums ofmoney that the elite spend in just one year to get us to castrate ourselves andtie our tubes, and abort our babies. I have divided the list of Foundations thatdonated money to Planned Parenthood in just the single year of 1984 into twocategories. The first category are Foundations that I can identify havingconnections to the Illuminati. The others are all the rest, and I suspect thissecond group has many that tie back too, I most likely haven’t figured out how.Illuminati Connected Foundations Donating to Planned Parenthood Federation &Branches -- and the Amounts Donated in 1984, * Vincent ASTOR Foundation -- $150,000 * Mary Duke BIDDLE Foundation -- $5,000 * DODGE Foundation -- $115,000 (the DuPonts are behind GM) * FORD Foundation -- $200,000 (McGeorge Bundy was Pres. of Ford Found.) * William Randolph HEARST Foundation -- $10,000 * (Freemason) Jessee H.

STEELE Foundation -- $418,950 * Eloise & Richard WEBBER Foundation -- $20,000 * WESTERN Electric Fund -- $6,000 * Robert WILSON Foundation -- $50,000 If the reader is wondering what happened that some of the other top Illuminatifamilies are not on the above list, the reason why it is that the other familieswere supporting other organizations similar to Planned Parenthood Foundationwhich are also working to promote sterilizations, abortions, and sexualpromiscuity. For instance, the Rockefeller family runs hundreds of foundations,and just two of these -- the ones named after the Rockefellers-supported thefollowing groups in 1984 which have the same goals and agenda as PlannedParenthood -- Center for Population Options (donation given - $29,730),Population Council ($1,235,000), Alan Guttmacher Institute ($300,000) this is adangerous organization doing research to promote these things, PopulationInstitute ($10,000). On top of this, in 1984 the Red Chinese Academy of MedicalScience was given several Rockefeller grants to do contraceptive, sterilization,and genetic research. One of these was a $6,647 grant given to the Red ChineseAcademy of Medical Science to study male contraceptives. Has abortion,sterilization, sexual promiscuity, population control, and genetic research beenpart of the Illuminati’s long range plan?You bet. But it was important that the Illuminati convince the experts, (atleast the experts they control) that these things were needed to save mankind.Three studies were made by the elite to determine that a population explosionwas threatening the earth. According to William Cooper in Behold a Pale Horse,pp. 166-67. The first was during W.W. II, the second at Huntsville, AL in 1957,and the third by the Club of Rome ending in 1968. All three studies concludedthat population growth must be curtailed. Last year at a meeting of the elite,George Hunt obtained a handout which shows that the elite are committed tostopping the population growth by any means available. Years earlier,Illuminatus Dr. Aurelio Peccei advocated a plague similar to the Black Plague,and when the idea was developed it became the AIDs epidemic. The Illuminati havethe cure for AIDS. Actually, there are many cures for AIDS But the one they hadbefore the AIDS epidemic began will not be given to the population until enoughpeople die, or until the elite are exposed enough that they are forced to giveout the cure. Dr. Wolf Szmuness. Pope John Paul II’s ex-roommate was one of themasterminds behind the AIDS epidemic. The National Security Council has had anad hoc group on Population Policy to strongly encourage other nations to havebirth control, abortions, and sterilizations. This group drafted the Global 2000Report which was given to Carter. Whether the population explosion is a threator not--(having travelled world-wide and having a father who was considered oneof the better agricultural scientists, I contend it is not a threat) -- theworld’s elite believe it, and they make the decisions. Further, they have avested interest, an immoral need to believe in the overpopulation lie.Van Duyn CandiesVan Duyn Candies has its kitchen and administration at 739 N.E. Broadway,Portland, OR. They operate 10 retail candy stores in Portland, one inSilverdale, WA (near Bremerton). The 63 year old company has 16 shopping mallleases, and wholesales candy to other candy distributors. It also operates asubsidiary Miss Saylor’s Candies, Inc. of Long Beach, CA. Van Duyn has in turnbeen bought out by Van Rian Corp, 2360 NW Quimby St., Portland, 97210. In 1990,American Confectionery, Inc. of Chino, CA was listed as owner of Van DuynCandies. (These statistics were the ones I was able to get, they may beoutdated.) One informant felt that Van Duyn Candies might play a role in thedistribution of poisoned candy to American school children, which was anIlluminati plan on the drawing boards years ago. I contacted a Van Duynrepresentative about any company plans to distribute candy to schools, but gotno information. The company has had its share of strange things happen. RichardMcCall who was the president borrowed $391,000 of the company’s funds for hispersonal use. This theft of company funds was forgiven when he gave up hisposition and his share of stock so that he no longer had control over a largeblock of stock. On April, 27, 1988 The Oregonian reported that the company hadgone bankrupt, and had filed for bankruptcy in Mar. 1987. However, companyofficials declared that the bankruptcy was merely a reorganization whichinvolved the resolving of the equity split in financial control of the company.The Van Duyn Candies reported $10 million in sales in 1986. If they play anyrole in all of this or not I cannot say. I certainly do not suggest that any ofmy readers boycott their candies. That would be rather rash and certainly is notwhat I want to see happen. Besides because they wholesale to others, I don’twhat other labels the candy gets sold under.A String of Strange CoincidencesA strange thing that happened to me that may be just coincidence or anotherpiece of the puzzle. I will not mention any names, because I do not know howthis all fits together. One of the men who owns two Van Duyn stores is anex-Missionary to Taiwan and a minister. This ex-Missionary still is on best ofterms (close friend) with the most powerful Free Chinese Army generals. Hedrives Cadillacs, and when he visits China is given the red carpet by hismilitary general friend. This ex-missionary/minister was a friend of mine, andin 1990, when he heard I had written a book, he was excited to buy my bookbecause we were friends. When he found out the title was The Watchower & TheMasons, he immediately lost interest in the book and never bought it. I askedhim if he knew anything about the Freemasons and he said he knew absolutelynothing about them. I thought that was a strange reply, because he was a leaderof the Kiwanis in this area, and I have been to his Kiwanis breakfasts whichwere held in the basement of a Masonic Lodge here in Portland. How did thisminister arrange for his Kiwanis club to meet in a Masonic Lodge, yet knownothing about the Masons? Further, there are many Masons with his surname, sothat at least within his extended family I would expect some of them are Masons.Later, this man’s son-in-law (also a minister) called me to this son-in-law’soffice in a particular church and told me I should be excommunicated byChristians for trying to expose Billy Graham, even though this minister’s churchdoesn’t excommunicate. He gave me mean looks and further told me, \"You will diefor your sins.” I don’t know if this owner of Van Duyn stores has anyrelationship to the larger picture, or if all this is Just a number of strangecoincidences.I don’t even know if the Van Duyn candy company is related in any way to the VanDuyn family, although one informant claims it is.A Van Duyn & the Cia, Mi6, Mossad, NSA, etc.MI6 was intimately involved in the creation of the CIA and MOSSAD. And MI6 isthe guiding hand behind those two organizations. British Intelligence wasintegrated under the title British Security Coordination which was the world’slargest and most powerful intelligence beast in the world. This beast has beenunder total control by the Illuminati since its beginning. Since 1940 when theBSC was set up in New York the Americans have worked for the British. But theintelligence community in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, NZ has gone a stepbeyond the secret intrigue of intelligence agencies secretly controlling otherintelligence agencies. They have actually signed formal agreements whichcompletely make all these acronym monsters into one intelligence agency. Thereis The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP) and the ABCA Agreement whichconcerns intelligence information exchange in the areas of defense research anddevelopment. The ABCA Agreement concerns military intelligence. The BRUSAAgreement on May 17, 1943 established exchange of personnel and the mostintimate cooperation at the highest levels by the various national intelligenceagencies of all high-grade COMINT. A Secret Treaty of 1947 linked all the majorcommonwealth and American intelligence groups. This is just one of countlessagreements, most secret, for the exchange of information. At that point in time,levels of secrecy were ULTRA (very secret), Pearl (moderately secret), and Thumb(secret). Pearl and Thumb later became Pinup. On 17 February 1972 a NationalSecurity Council Intelligence Directive (NSCID)-6 directed the NSA to be theprincipal US SIGINT agency, with the FBI and CIA basically working for the NSA.Although some people are claiming that their is friction between the NSA and itsfront organizations the FBI & CIA, it is hard to picture that this friction isanything serious because many people in these front organizations work for theNSA. The CIA, MI6 and the Mossad all worked through the BCCI which wasscandalized recently, although the elite kept the lid on the scandal. Togetherthe UKUSA intelligence community (or what is better termed the NWO’sintelligence world-wide intelligence agency, of which MI5, MI6, CIA, NSA, FBI,NZSIS, RCMP, SIS, ASIO, GCHQ, NRO, DIA & the SASB are simply departments, havetogether at least 300,000 people employed full time. If there was in the 1968time period a Van Duyn serving as the liaison between these various intelligence\"departments’, he would be a very powerful man. (There is a way open to me toconfirm this about a Van Duyn if I get the time.)Two Other Prominent Early Dutch American FamiliesOne of the men who has worked for the NWO in their think tanks and with theirintelligence agencies is Professor William R. Van Cleave, who is a descendent ofthe New Netherlands families. His name is mentioned now because it is quitepossible the Van Cleave’s and the Van Duyn’s intermarried. (I know that WilliamVan Duyn married Sarah Van Cleef in Somerset, NJ in around 1750. Prof. VanCleave worked for RAND, Stanford Research Institute, Dept. of Strategic andDefense Studies at the Univ. of So. Calif. and was an advisor to the Pentagon,the SALT conferences etc. The Van Cleves are said to have originated from anancestor Jan Van Cleef who was the son of Dutch nobility--the last Duke ofCleves. He is said to have come to America in 1653. Two of the Van Cleaves wereScottish Rite Masons in Chicago around the turn of the century.Some Important Connections -- Collins - Whitneys - VanderbiltsWilliam Collins Whitney, a member of the Illuminati via the Skull & Bones Order,is someone who I suspect was part of the Collins family. The Collins family iswithout doubt one of the top 13 Illuminati families. William Collins Whitney wasa directory of Guaranty Trust, as well as his son H.P. Whitney who served later.William Collins Whitney married Flora Payne, daughter of Standard Oil’sTreasurer Oliver Payne. William Collins Whitney’s two sons were both members inthe Skull & Bones, and one of them married Gertrude Vanderbilt (anotheroriginally early Dutch American family). The money that the Whitney family hadamassed from the Payne’s and the Vanderbilts then was put into Guaranty Trust,J.P. Morgan, and Guggenheim. Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt was a member of the Skull& Bones Order (init. 1899). A. Vanderbilt was sent a warning not to sail on theLusitania, because the elite knew it was to be sunk, but he failed to get thetelegram and sailed to his death. Whitman Vanderbilt was part of the group ofIlluminati that made up the Round Table in which the Satanic Astors and SatanicCecils played a big role. I have sometimes wondered if rather than the VanDuyn’s that the name we should be dealing with is Vanderbilt. In any case, thepoint is that several of these originally Dutch families are in deep with theIlluminati. The origin of the Vanderbilt fortune is an obscure mystery. It wasclose to 1 billion in 1924, and must exceed numerous billions today. Onereference states that Cornelius Vanderbilt, the original Vanderbilt who made itrich, made his large sums from blackmail (Minnigerode, Meade. Certain Rich Men.New York: G.P. Putnam’s Son, 1927, pp 112-113.) Lindsay Russell (of the Russellfamily--another top 13 Illuminati family) worked for the Vanderbilts. It wasLindsay Russell who started the Pilgrim Society--which is the 6° of the branchIlluminati. Lindsay Russell was also chairman of the CFR, which is the 4°.The Vanderbilts, the Whitneys, the Goulds, and the Rockefellers gave large sumsof money to Billy Graham for his New York Crusade.The Dutch Connection TodayMany ex-Nazis and elite industrialists have made their homes in theGarderen-Putten area of the Netherlands. The Bilderbergers are building asuperhotel/conference center near this area. One of the companies involved inbuilding the hotel is the Nazi family of Nachanius. The Belgium-Dutch connectionto the Illuminati is not trivial. The Dutch William of Orange deposed EnglishKing James II in the fighting of 1688-91. That is significant, because itappears that Illuminati financial headquarters were in Amsterdam prior toWilliam of Orange’s victory. After that victory they moved to London. One onlyhas to note how important Brussels has been to the New World Order to realizethat the lowlands of Belgium and the Netherlands continue to be important forthe elite. For instance, the Beast--the supercomputer which is notified withinseconds of every financial transaction you carry on at an ATM is located inBrussels. If the Van Duyn family were indeed one of the top 13 families it mightbreak open some big clues to understanding the Belgium connections and elementswithin the Illuminati. Earlier newsletters and the Be Wise As Serpents book havedescribed high level rituals carried out in a castle (burg) in Belgium. Thereare Dutchmen in the genealogy of the Roosevelt presidents in the line that goesback to the British royalty. Other prominent elitists tie back to theNetherlands & Belgium also. Elizabeth Van Buren wrote The Sign of the Dove whichis a book about the Merovingians [the 13th Top Illuminati bloodline] and Jesus.The book takes a gnostic approach to religion, and puts forth the idea that theMerovingians were of extra-terrestrial descent. I had expected to find the townof Duyn from which the Van Duyn would have taken their name, but none of themaps so far have shown it. I had expected to find more important Van Duyns inthe Netherlands and in the U.S. Instead, I only found a Hidde Hendrick Van Duyn,who came over from the Netherlands and became a state educational official.Clearly, I have only broken the surface in trying to understand the Dutchconnection in the Illuminati.Conclusions & SummaryIt has been theorized by others that at the top of the Illuminati are unknownsuperiors, so this should not scare anyone that I don’t have all the details,and that the family is unknown. On the other hand it is very hard to hide peoplewho wield immense power. So far, I have dealt with families that were definitelywithin the top 13 Illuminati families. If the Van Duyn family is part of the top13, it may represent the ‘Dutch-Flemish-Belgium segment of the Illuminati, justas the Astors & Rothschilds came from Germany, the DuPonts from France, the Li’sfrom China, and the Kennedy’s from Ireland. Actually, the entire 13 top familiesare related in various ways and their heritages go back to the ancient nobilityof Europe, to the tribe of Dan, and to the Khazars. Many of these top familiesfeel they are descendants of the House of David. One researcher has even told methat the royal house of Japan is blood relation to the thirteenth top Illuminatifamily. (Truth is often stranger than fiction, but this sounds trulyincredible.) That would be interesting if the genealogy (which he claims doesexist) does actually show that. It would help explain why Japan is being broughtinto the picture. I was able only to identify that the Van Duyn family was avery early colonial American family of status, and that the few modern membersof this family which I could identify are suspiciously tied to the establishmentand fit the type of persons we would expect from a top 13 family. If anyone hasany information concerning this subject, that information would be appreciated.Revisiting the Van Duyn Family - One of the Top 13 Illuminati FamiliesThe Dutch-Belgium connection is one link that is very powerful in theIlluminati, but an area of which my knowledge is very scattered. I am trying torectify that ignorance. Since my big article in the July 1, 1993 issue about theVan Duyns, I received more confirmations and tips from ex-Illuminati informants.So I have continued my search for details on the Van Duyn family. I was giventhe tip that the Illuminati members of this family were located in someplacelike Michigan, and I did indeed find that the Grand Rapids area has a largenumber of Van Duyns. There are also a small smattering of Van Duyns (there are afew variant spellings such as Van Duine) at Lansing, MI; North Oakland, MI;Minneapolis, MINN; and St. Paul. I was also able to identify one more Van Duynwho has been part of the power structure, and might possibly then be part of theactual secret generational Satanic cult activity. This man was an official forUNESCO. I have had ex-Witchcraft sources tell me that UNESCO was passing NWOinstructions on to them. UNESCO is one of the more directly controlled and moredangerous U.N. organizations. My writings have referred to it before. This man’sname is Robert Gerald Vanduyn. He married Florence Elizabeth Noyer. RobertVanduyn served as the associate director of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, whichis a large foundation with HO in Battle Creek, Michigan. The Kellogg Foundationgives grants to Catholic Universities, to research along the lines of Illuminatigoals, and a variety of other causes. For instance, a 1984 $100,000 grant wasgiven to the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges. The purpose?“…To implement a national recruitment effort to enlist the support of governmentand corporate leaders to improve policies concerning adult education andtraining.\" Of course as you know, most national government and corporate leadersare part of their power structure so of course they (the Illuminati) would likethese people in the decision making process of our junior colleges. TheFoundation contributed almost $10,000 in 1984 to the Battle Creek Board ofEducation. That should give the foundation quite a bit of clout in the localschool board’s decisions. Many of the grants of the Kellogg Foundation are topromote things in health care and agriculture which are in the general trend ofwhat the Illuminati is pushing for. The American government loaned RobertVanduyn to UNESCO from 1972 onwards. He was given the position of Coordinator ofUNESCO Service World Bank Education project. To be in that position shows he waspart of the elite, whether he was or wasn’t a Satanist. UNESCO is being used topush a NWO education agenda on the world. Recently, the death of Patricia VanCleve Lake opened up some more clues about the Van Duyns. In the July 1 articleI mention on page 52 that one of the other early Dutch families in New Amsterdamwhich intermarried with the Van Duyns was the Van Cleves. Ten hours beforePatricia Van Cleve Lake died on Oct. 3, she called her son and told him thetruth about who she was. The 3 paragraph death notice was buried on page 14 inan LA. paper (I think the L.A. Times). What she told her son on her death bedwas that she was the daughter of William Randolph Hearst and movie star MarionDavies. Various people noticed her resemblance to Hearst, but dared not speakabout it publicly. Her son told people after she died, ‘She lived her life on asatin pillow. They took away her name, but they gave her everything else.\"Patricia was always introduced as \"the niece\" of Marion Davies, who in realitywas her mother. The rumor mill since the 1920s had claimed Patricia was Hearstdaughter, but it wasn’t until just this last month that it had been publiclysaid.The news links the Van Cleve family to Hearst. All this news is very interestingin light of several previously establish facts. First, Hearst who funded BillyGraham’s first 3 years of Crusades was part of the Illuminati. Second, theIlluminati often adopt out their children to hide their paternity and ancestry.Third, the Van Cleve family is linked to the Van Duyns, which raises thepossibility of links between Hearst and the Van Duyns.Followup Article on The Van DuynsThe long Van Duyn article of the July 1, ‘93 newsletter indicated that I waspuzzled that I hadn’t found more clues about the power of the Van Duyn family,which an informant had told me was one of the top 13 Illuminati families. Sincethat time, I have spent time with a very knowledgeable ex-Illuminatus, and itwas confirmed that the initial information was indeed correct, the Van Duyns areone of the top 13 Bloodlines. Some of the Satanic members of this bloodline arein the North Central area of United States, such as in Michigan. I found outthat this bloodline keeps much of their money in Europe, and that they arelinked to some Italians -- (the Mafia?).With some more clues to pursue, I hope to discover some more about this topIlluminati family which has gone to such great lengths to be hidden. It is clearthat they have kept their money and businesses well hidden, via holdingcompanies and other gimmicks.EpilogueThis collection of articles has tried to take the reader back stage to meet thefamilies that control the Illuminati and the world. One of the best places tosee representatives of the different 13 families together are when they gatherfor the Feast of the Beast. The back stage story is far from being told. The VanDuyn family is a fitting way to end this book, because the mystery thatsurrounds them highlights the work that still remains to tell the completestory. The Van Duyn articles do not mention Roel Van Duyn of Amsterdam,Netherlands who founded/headed in modern times the socialist/communist movementin the Netherlands. He was a powerful man. The movement was led by Provos(provocateurs) whose demonstrations at times got violent. What is the nature ofthe relationship between the Van Duyn family and the Van Cleve family? I knowthere was some intermarriage, but due to time restraints I never completed myinvestigation down this avenue. While Roel Van Duyn was leading his radicalmovement, Miss Davies father was living at Heart’s Riverside Dr. No. 336, andher brother-in-law George Van Cleve was an executive in Hearst’s filmcorporation. The mystery of the Van Duyn family is also reflected in the mysterysurrounding the Romanov family. The Romanov family had more than the Russianbranch, there was for instance a Prussian branch. And some of their family likethe Grand Prince Alexis Romanov came to America, where his granddaughter MaryTeissier (the cousin to Alexander Romanov) was one of J. Paul Getty’s mainlovers. J. Paul Getty if you have forgotten was at one time listed by FortuneMagazine as America’s richest man. Not only does Romanov blood flow in some ofthe Illuminati, the Romanov name pops up among the friends of Frank Sinatra.Mike and Gloria Romanov were friends of Frank Sinatra. Frank Sinatra’s socialactivities were like a Who’s Who in the Mafia and Illuminati. Frank Sinatrawould travel to France to spend time with Baron Guy de Rothschild, or could befound doing a charity ball for the World Mercy Fund with Laurence Rockefeller.Mentioning the Rockefellers brings us right back to the Romanovs. And then whowas Anne Marie Rasmussen who married Nelson Rockefeller’s son Steven ClarkRockefeller? When one reads her book There Was Once A Time of Islands:Illusions. & Rockefellers (NY: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975) one learns thatshe was from Norway, a maid in the Rockefeller home, learned TM, and was shockedby the Rockefeller’s abundant “primitive” art of the Rockefellers. “Primitive”simply was a Rockefeller expression for all the nude art that they have allaround. In her book, she talks about “The Playhouse” at Kykuit, about Margaretta(Happy) Rockefeller’s close friend Mrs. Vincent Astor, about LaurenceRockefeller’s St. John Island, where he built the Caneel Bay Plantation, and theRockefeller’s ranch at Jackson Hole, WY. Talking about the Astors brings us backto Frank Sinatra who bought Mary Astor’s large rambling property in the TolucaLake area of the San Fernando Valley. Frank bought the land without even seeingit. Frank is not the only one not seeing things. So much of what is being toldus by our media is outright distortions. John D. Rockefeller, Sr. would gettogether secretly with William H. Vanderbilt and Jay Gould to scheme against thepublic. They took oaths to cooperate while the public thought they wereantagonists. And what about the Rockefeller-Rothschild feud? And why did JohnArchbold (John D. Rockefeller’s right hand man) go overseas and secretly workout business arrangements with the Rothschilds in the 1880s? One CIA agentdescribed the “Company” as a worn out cover for who needs to come in off thestreet and get cleaned. The Illuminati have made the CIA and used it for theirown ends, and have let the CIA be the fall guy. When we start looking closer atthe CIA, we see men like Archie Roosevelt of the Roosevelt family, who was aleader in the CIA., going to places such as Nigeria to visit the Emir of Kanowith David Rockefeller. This Rockefeller/Roosevelt visit to the Emir was closeto going to Timbuktu. (David Rockefeller took along his own private professor ofEgyptology when he went to the pyramids and to Egypt. Perhaps his love for Egyptrelates to David’s fixation and love for beetles.) (Another aside, is thatAmerica’s foremost Egyptologist Dr. Charles Breasted was underwritten by theRockefellers. But then those few who understand the one to one correspondence ofthe Book of the Dead’s rituals and modern Satanic rituals might not besurprised.) Nelson Rockefeller was part of the National Security Council whichsits even higher than the CIA in Intelligence affairs. Speaking of far offplaces, what about Mis Osman Ali Khan who was the principal Moslem ruler ofIndia at one time? And what about the multi-millionaire possible billionaire AgaKhan Ill? These men interacted socially with the Illuminati families. And howfar does the Rockefeller wealth go? We know that through the Chase InvestmentCorporation they have such far off holdings as a steel mill in Turkey, and acotton textile mill in Nigeria. Creole Petroleum of Venezuela is owned byNelson. Chase Manhattan has a full-time envoy to the U.N. and the SecretaryGenerals of the UN visit the Rockefellers at their estate at Pocantico. A numberof families threw their selves in with the Rockefellers and owe their familywealth to the fact that they served the Rockefellers. These include John D.Archbold, the Harknesses, the Bedfords, the Chesebroughs, the Cutlers, theFlaglers, the Folgers, the Paynes, the Pierces, and the Rogerses. TheRockefeller’s have had a number of senators who he “owns.” In 1904, SenatorPenrose received $25,000 and Senator Bliss received $100,000 given viaRockefeller’s Standard Oil. One scholar wrote against the Rockefeller control ofpolitics, “The Standard [Oil] had done everything to the Pennsylvanialegislature except refine it.” (Henry Demarest Lloyd, Wealth Against theCommonwealth. When the Rockefellers wanted to build a highway they would summonpeople like Interior Secretary Stewart Udall to Nelson’s apartment, where hetalked Udall into permitting the Rockefellers to build an unpopular highway. In1968, Hubert Humphrey wanted both David and Nelson Rockefeller in his cabinet.The Rockefellers cooked up the idea to have a World Trade Center in NY and theircronies were involved in the scandal to promote the idea. David wrote letters ofadvice to Pres. J.F. Kennedy. Where do all these elite connections end? Allthese top 13 Illuminati families tie together at the Feast of the Beast rituals.In addition to this grand meeting, where Satan puts in his personal appearance,these families have smaller meetings and rituals frequently all over the world.Their Council of 9 and their Council of 13 meet and send out their ordersregularly. Volume 2 will examine how the Illuminati rule, what theirorganizations are, and what their life and rituals are like. An Appendix so tospeak. As I failed to provide a genealogical chart for the Rockefeller Familywhile doing my newsletter articles, I will as an appendix add that to this page.One of the families that intermarried with the Costellos was the Van Duynfamily. But who are the Costellos? Frank Costello (died 1973) was the underworldboss of New York for many years until Vito Genovese (died ‘69) took control.Carlo Gambino took over from Vito until his death and then in 1976 Carlo in turn died and his heir Paul Castellano with some of the Gambinofamily took over. Now Roosevelt (Rosy-or Rose) Gambino runs the Gambino family,(The Gambino family is related in marriage to the Eli Lilly Illuminati family.)Frank Costello had Jerry Catena working for him, and Eddie Torres was a closefriend of Jerry Catena. Eddie Torres was the President of the Las Vegas casinoRiviera, before Gus Greenbaum took over. Greenbaum was connected to all theMafia, and was a casino manager for Meyer Lansky in Havana and other places. LouCostello’s father was from Italy. In Italy the name was spelled “Cristillo.” LouCostello got Dean Martin into show business. Lou provided Dean Martin the moneyfor his nose job before Dean made it big in show business. Lou’s daughter latermarried Dean’s son. Lou Perry and Costello both got Dean Martin into showbusiness. Costello had great clout with MCA. Costello got disgusted with DeanMartin in 1945 when Dean ran up bills which he charged to Lou Costello. LaterDean ignored Lou at a Casino and also got Lou Costello ticked off. Dean’s firstwife was Betty McDonald. Betty’s father was Bill McDonald. (See what I’vewritten on the McDonald’s role in the Illuminati.) Betty McDonald Martin becameknown for being a party-throwing alcoholic while neglecting her children. CaroleCostello married Dean Martin’s oldest son. One of Lou Costello’s friends wasMickey Cohen. Frank Costello rubbed shoulders with the Rockefellers, with LuckyLucianno, and other powerful underworld figures. Costello controlled NY MayorWilliam 0’ Dwyer. Frank Costello was also the owner of Alliance Distributors whoare the sole American distributors for Whitely Co. of Scotland. Scotch drinkerslike the orange brown scotch of the famous King’s Ransom Scotch as well as theHouse of Lords Scotch. They may not realize that Costello was the soledistributor of these drinks which were imported through him from Scotland. RayRyan, a young Texas oil Tycoon went into at least one petroleum- lease venturewith Frank Costello and Frank Erickson. Ray Ryan was friends also with DeanMartin. Ray Ryan was the godfather for Ricci Martin. His Mount Kenya Safari Clubhad an elusive membership, incl. such Illuminati members as Winston Churchilland Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. Ray Ryan was involved with the Mafiawhen someone blew his Lincoln Continental up. The blast had been so powerfulpart of Palm Springs had its power knocked out. Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra,Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop were known as the Rat Pack. Allof these men were connected to the Mafia and some (if them were Satanists suchas Sammy Davis, Jr. and Peter Lawford. In 1960, these men posed together outsideof the Sands casino for a picture where they performed together. This picture ofthe Rat Pack is in the book Dino. Living High In the Dirty Business of Dreams byNick Tosches. Another picture of Dean Martin taken around 1954 shows him withMarilyn Monroe and Averell Harriman. Averell Harriman was in the Illuminati.Marilyn Monroe was a Monarch sexual slave for the elite. Marilyn was aPresidential Model sexual slave for JFK. JFK was part of the Kennedy Illuminatifamily and he often spent time with members of the Rat Pack. The HollywoodReporter described Dean Martin as a \"hypnotically attractive, homegrown Americanmonster.\" Frank Sinatra was a very cruel man too. Dean Martin (Dino Crocetti)grew up in Steubenville which was known for its gambling and prostitution. Awhite-slavery ring that kidnapped beautiful woman for whorehouses washeadquartered in Steubenville. James Vincent Tripodi of the Mafia ranSteubenville. A popular saying in Steubenville among the youth was “Learn tosteal, learn to deal, or go to the mill.” Dino became a dealer at the Rex inSteubenville, run by Cosmo Quattrone. Jerry Lewis, a close associate to DeanMartin said, \"No one ever got to know him, not even Betty [his wife].\" HermanHover, who lived at 606 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills, bought his mansionfrom the Vanderbilts. Howard Hughes did a lot of his business at the mansion.Mickey Cohen, Gen. J. Wainwright, Howard Hughes, James Roosevelt (FDR’s son),and many other prominent people would go to Hover’s Ciro nightclub. Later theywould go over to Hover’s Mansion. The mansion was a place of frequent partiesthat Dean Martin and others of his group would go to. In defiance of NBC’sstandards, Dean Martin for his Dean Martin show was going to show off womentrained as animals. Dean Martin would walk on the show with a voluptuous gal ina tiger outfit on a leash that Dean would hold. The girl would then be tellingDean at every chance that she was not a girl but a fellow. When Dean marriedKathy Hawn, in 1973, Frank Sinatra was his best man. Frank received adiamond-studded golden cigarette lighter with an obscene inscription. Deanworked many years for MGM Grand, which now is built as a pyramid in Las Vegaswith Monarch programming going on in it. The theme inside the MGM is the Wizardof Oz which is for Monarch programming. (To understand the Wizard-of-Oz mindcontrol programming the reader needs to get this author’s various writings onthe Monarch Programming, which includes an Illustrated Guide to MonarchProgramming and other writings.) Bob Hope, an MI-6 agent who was usedextensively in W.W. II to trigger mind-controlled military men with the properhypnotically embedded trigger words, received his own mind-controlled sex slavesafter the war. One of these slaves of Bob Hope also worked for the Illuminati’sCouncil of 7. This author (Fritz Springmeier) knows her and she is one of thefew Illuminati slaves who has been deprogrammed. While she was a slave for BobHope, he loaned her to Sammy Davis, Jr., Dean Martin, and Richard Nixon to namea few. More about this Monarch slave, which was used as a courier and a sexualslave, shortly. Let’s explain some about Bob Hope. Because the previousparagraph may present the reader some difficulties let’s temporarily digressinto the entertainment field’s connections to the elite. The Caesars and themedieval kings recognized the importance of controlling the people withentertainment. The occult world has long been connected with entertainment.during W.W. II, the U.S. and U.K. used almost everyone in the entertainmentfields to help with the war effort. There have been numerous connections in thisauthor’s research about the Illuminati/CIA mind control which connects back tothe U.S.O. (the American military entertainers that travelled in USO units ontours.) The story about how the USO was used to carry messages tomind-controlled agents and military men would include many names including QuentReynolds, Bruce Cabot, Joe E. Brown, Andy Devine, Candy Jones (Jessica Wilcox)and some many lesser knowns such as Wheeler (who later became known as theprogrammer Dr. Black). The military apparently was already using programmedkillers to carry out deadly assignments. Bob Hope & the USO was used to carrytrigger words to these mind-controlled people. For many years the world’sexperts in running spies--the British Empire under the control of theIlluminati, have been using certain professions for spying. For instance,Postmaster Generals are used for spying because they can control the secretspying on mail. An example of this, Benjamin Franklin, postmaster general forthe colonies, was an important spy for the Illuminati’s British TradingCompanies/British government in the colonies. (To understand his role in theIlluminati contrived American Revolution read chap. 3.4. in my Be Wise AsSerpents). Likewise, what better person to pick than Bob Hope to run messagesworldwide? Bob Hope, was British, and MI6 knew they could trust him. Bob Hopehas an excellent ability to learn and say lines. Bob was and still is great withwords, knowing how to fit them together and to make puns and double and triplemeaning sentences. His ability to construct sentences with double meanings was agreat cover for the hidden messages he transmitted for allied intelligenceduring the war. If you want to keep a secret the best place is out in the open.The British and American intelligence agencies know this. Some of their greatestsecrets are out in the open, where no one suspects what they are. Bob Hope whowas already a radio and movie star before W.W.II, was given wide publicity as hetravelled all over for the U.S.O. (the entertainment groups for the military).Bob Hope was “just an entertainer,” and yet he visited Roosevelt. Churchill,Eisenhower, Patten, and all kinds of military men. Bob traveled all over theworld to every front during the war, including England, Africa, the SouthPacific. the East & West Coasts of the U.S. the Caribbean, Panama, etc. He couldfit all kinds of signals into his jokes and talks, and no one would be thewiser. Under the disguise of building moral by being a comedian, Bob could goanywhere and because he always was making jokes, no one took him seriously. BobHope was a courier, a message bearer of coded messages. Sometimes the codedmessages almost seem to jump out when you look at his wartime talks M16 andMIS’s Section BIA under the supervision of London’s W Board and 20 Committeeoversaw the running of double agents and mind-controlled couriers andmind-controlled spies. Special Intelligence Service (SIS) for the British dealta great deal with mind-control of all types. Tavistock Institute of HumanRelations was part of SIS’s mind control capabilities. Men like Tavistock’shypnotist/mind control expert Eric Trist were willing to perform mind-control onBritish civilians/military men. Over the last 45 years perhaps the most popularplace for couriers to be signaled to meet was by someone holding a bird in acage or at a shop with birdcages. The allusion to carrier pigeons is so obvious.Look at a caption “Speaking of WRENS” with a cartoon from Bob Hope’s book INever Left Home (NY: Simon & Schuster, 1944) written in 1944 during the middleof W.W.II. The cartoon shows Bob chasing a girl with a bird cage and saying“Tweet, Tweet, Tweet.” Hypnotic commands are given three times. What seems likea harmless cartoon looks more like a signal telling people that Bob Hope is incharge of a flock of carrier pigeons (couriers). When talking to a group ofsoldiers during the war Bob said, \"In London the bobbies caught a guy walkingaround in the fog with a bird cage giving the mating call but the Americanconsul got me.”There is a great deal more that could be written, perhaps books, but Americansneed to understand that MI6 (British intelligence) started, trained and stillcontrol American intelligence. Remember, that Canada entered W.W.II along withBritain, and the British set up one of their best secret agent training schoolsbetween Whitley and Oshawa, Ontario in a place called Intrepid Park. The agentscalled it \"the camp\" or \"the farm.\" (Now the CIA has their own \"camp\" or \"farm’which is Camp Peary where they carry out mind-control.) The British named thisBritish Security Coordination Special Training School No. 103 & Hydra. STS 11).Some people called it Camp X. When the war broke out the Amer. FBI, OSS, SOE,SIS, BSC, and the Canadian RCMP all sent people to be \"trained\" at the secretCamp X hidden on Lake Ontario’s north shore across from the US-CAN border.British SOE (Special Operations Executive) set itself up for business in NewYork City, and during WW II directed operations from there. Let’s get back toexplaining about Frank Sinatra, a man who spent time visiting with theRockefellers, the European and American Rothschilds, and other powerful figuresincluding Bob Hope. Frank Sinatra, who is well known worldwide for his crueltywould serve as the handler for Bob Hope’s Mind-controlled slave(s) when shesexually serviced men in the Rat Pack. In other words, Frank Sinatra and DeanMartin knew the cues, the trigger code words to get this slave to sexually servethem, especially Frank. Because Dean knew about the Monarch programming, that iswhy he had the audacity to want to bring a slave on his show on a lease in atiger outfit. During the obedience training of a sexual slave they have anexpensive collar put on them and their mind-control programming for all sexualalters from infancy up is that they are cats. These slaves have cat alters(personalities) who are spin-kitten alters. When Dean Martin as an older manwould sexually get younger women like Andre Boyer, a 19 year old student at UCLAthere is a good chance that Andre and others like her were under mind-control.Frank Sinatra’s parents were Natalie (Dolly) Della Garavante from Genoa andAnthony Martin Sinatra from Catania, Sicily. His mother was a cigar-smokingcruel foul mouthed woman. Dolly was a midwife and abortionist (before it waslegal). Dolly didn’t always escape legal detection for her illegal abortions.Just one of the times she was hauled into court was on Feb. 27, ‘39 in a HudsonSpecial Sessions Court. Frank’s parents always had money, and so Frank grew upas a child who always had money. He would share it with other kids, if theywould be his friend. Frank was known as a lazy and mean boy as he grew up. Hestill did not have a steady job by the age of 20 and was still living off hisparents. Frank’s mother then decided to get him into singing. Due to his mother,Frank got some singing jobs and started going somewhere in life. Afterstruggling for years, Tommy Dorsey got Frank Sinatra on the road to success withhis band. Tommy Dorsey and Frank’s mother got along great. Frank Sinatra wantedto emulate Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel who was boss of Niurder, Inc. Let’s digressfor a minute and explain that the Illuminati will use the Mafia for murderswhich don’t have formal approval of the Illuminati hierarchy to carry out. About30% of the dirty work for the Illuminati is carried out by the Mafia. TheIlluminati have their own death squads which are superior to the Mafia, butindividuals must approach one of the Councils for approval to assassinate. Oftenit’s easier for those in the Illuminati just to put an unauthorized contract outon someone. The Mafia is often willing to make a business deal. The Mafia isintertwined with the occult and some of the Mafia are involved in rituals,mind-control programming etc. However, there are a number of Mafia who are onlyin it for the business end, like many in the Yakusa. They are appalled at theheartless things that the Illuminati are doing such as turning a wholegeneration of young people into drug addicts, etc. Some of the Mafia have muchhigher codes of honor than the Generational Satanists. Frank Sinatra’s heroBugsy was associated with all the Mafia heads such as Charlie “Lucky” Luciano(who controlled Marilyn Monroe as a slave) and Frank Costello. The New JerseyUnderworld kingpin Willie Moretti (aka Willie Moore) was Frank Sinatra’sneighbor in Hasbrouch Heights. Bugsy was a cruel man. Frank was in total awe ofBugsy (almost enthralled to the point of worship). The Illuminati turned toBugsy and then later to the Gambino family when the needed someone killed.Later, Bugsy got on the bad side of other Mafia chiefs and was killed by them.Frank Sinatra had a quick way of alienating people with his controlling anger.Frank alienated William Randolph Hearst, Jr. at a party by fighting with him.The Hearst papers started giving Frank bad publicity after the fight. Frank’sagent and friend George Evans flew to Hollywood and through Marion Davies, whowas William Randolph Hearst’s mistress for many years, he was able to get in tosee the old man William Randolph Hearst, Sr. who was ill. Frank was properlycontrite and got the old man to like him. Apparently with Marion Davis and theold man Hearst on his side, Frank was able to overcome the son’s orders to theHearst papers to give Frank negative publicity. After his visit with Marion andHearst, Sr. Frank began to get positive publicity again. For those who need tobe reminded, the Hearst family is an Illuminati family, and the Hearst castle inCalif. which is owned by the State of California as a Park continues to be usedfor rituals for the Illuminati hierarchy. Of special note is that Marion Daviswas connected to the Van Cleve family which is another family which hasintermarried with the Van Duyn family along with the Costellos. In case thereader missed it in a previous article, a prominent member of the Van Duynfamily who headed California’s Teen Challenge helped get Billy Graham’s ministrystarted. This person is a member of the Illuminati as well as being a Christianminister. (I am intentionally not mentioning his name.) William Randolph Hearstpaid for the first 3 years of Billy Graham’s ministry. There are a number peopleof the Van Duyn bloodline in the Illuminati who are also Christian ministers. (Ican’t give my sources-needless to say they are several people who have beenescaping the Illuminati.) In the final analysis, we can say that severalIlluminati members of the Van Duyn bloodline helped in the establishment ofBilly Graham having a big crusade ministry. Frank Sinatra rubbed shoulders withmany of the Illuminati. That doesn’t mean that he was a member, it is possiblethat his mafia ties are why he was so well received by Illuminati kingpins. TheIlluminati has a history of sharing their mind-controlled slaves with the Mafia,even slaves who are members within the Illuminati are shared. However, theIlluminati always insures that they have final control over a slave’sprogramming. One of the people who was a drummer with the Tommy Dorsey Band fora while was William Joseph Bryan, Jr. (aka William Joseph Bryon, and WilliamJenning Bryan III, etc.) William Joseph Bryan, Jr. was a CIA Mind-controlprogrammer. He programmed people when he was with the Air Force as Chief ofMedical Survival Training, which was a covert brainwashing section (If the AirForce. Bryan opened up his own hypnotherapy Institute on Sunset Strip inHollywood where he programmed some people in acting for the Illuminati. Bryanwas the person who programmed Sirhan Sirhan to kill Robert Kennedy. He alsohypnotized Alvert Di Salvo. After Bryan died in spring, 1977, the CIA cleanedout all of his files including his home files. Bryan was a 6’ 1 1/2\" fat Satanicpriest in the Old Roman Catholic Church. The CIA and the Illuminati haveconnections in this offshoot of Catholicism. Bryan was a descendant of WilliamJennings Bryan, the Mason who supposedly defended the creation view in theScopes Monkey Evolution Trial. W.J. Bryan, III (or Jr.) was a frequent guest inmany fundamentalist churches in Southern California. It’s interesting how theTommy Dorsey Band had both Bryan and Sinatra in it, since both men would go onto be involved with Satanic mind-control in the future. William J. Bryan spoketo many judges, so it is possible he used his law degree to get him appointmentswith dirty judges that needed training about the Illuminati’s Mind Controlprogram. In William J. Bryan, Jr.’s book entitled The Chosen One: The Art ofJury Selection, Bryan teaches how to use hypnosis on jury members to win one’scase. On the back of the book the author is described, \"in addition Dr. Bryanserved as an Electronics Engineer in the Navy in World War II, was Director ofall Medical Survival Training for the United States Air Force, and a leadingexpert on brainwashing.\" William J. Bryan was the technical director for FrankSinatra’s movie Manchurian Candidate, which is a film which was used to scareAmerican’s into thinking the enemy was carrying out mind-control. This was sothat if the Illuminati-CIA horrible trauma-based mind-control was everdiscovered that the CIA would be justified in the minds of Americans for thehorrible things they were doing. Illuminati Mind-controlled slaves were forcedto watch the movie Manchurian Candidate to further enhance their feelings ofhelplessness. Frank Sinatra made the movie by getting the rights from the book’sauthor for the story. The author had as far as I know only stumbled upon whatthe Illuminati and their intelligence agencies were doing. Frank Sinatrasquelched the second release of the Manchurian Candidate film, so it is clearthat the entire movie was an affair carried out by the CIA to squelch the truestory and to intimidate those thousands of Mind-controlled slaves that they’dcreated. This article has elaborated on the Costello family and the Van Clevefamily which are branches of the Van Duyns. Interestingly, the elite BohemianGrove which has been used as a site for Satanic rituals for over 25 years, hasJoseph V. Costello, Jr. and Peter Van Cleave as members. Peter Van Cleave stayedin the bungalow called Oz when he was at the Bohemian Grove. Several Illuminatisurvivors have indicated that the Van Duyns have power in California. If the VanDuyns family power is via the Costellos and Van Cleves and other unmentionedoffshoots of the family, then finally the secrecy protecting the powerful VanDuyn Satanic bloodline may be cracking for the first time. The Van Duyn familyhave changed the spelling on their name. One group spells it, Van Dine. VanceVan Dine is an important NWO figure who graduated from Yale. He is anEpiscopalian, and has worked with the big international bankers. He was born inSan Francisco, but lived in New York City area. He has been on the board of dir,of the German-connected Vereinsbank Capital Corp. Another Van Dine of note isHarold Foster Van Dine, Jr. who has been a famous architect. He has been a majorfigure in the Troy, MI company of Straub, Van Dine & Assoc."},{"pageContent":" The Merovingian BloodlineThis page has been prepared to provide some type of table of contents to thevarious items which will be included in this chapter \"The Merovingian Bloodline”which could also be called “The Thirteenth Satanic Bloodline.\" In my writings,this bloodline has been interwoven into the text of many articles, but it hasn’tbeen singled out very much. Although a great deal has been written by thisauthor on this final family, to pull out articles which concentrate on it solelyis difficult. After assembling some pages on it, a few words of explanation werestill needed. Allow me to briefly explain those items which were selected: * An article on the top family that appeared in Feb. ‘95 newsletter on page 73. * An appendix to the Be Wise As Serpents book about the British Royalty. The British Royalty are tied in with the 13th Bloodline. * Many of the American political leaders have been related to the British Royalty including George Bush and Dan Quayle. A flier from a Christian conference is included showing who the speakers are. * Finally, a little of the genealogical information I assembled on the Mormon leaders is given. This was included in the Be Wise As Serpents book to give people an idea of how the Mormon leadership ties back in with the leading occult bloodlines of the Merovingian dynasty. The chart for LDS President Albert Smith is only about 1/3 typed out. The remainder of Albert Smith’s (as well as other Mormon leaden) genealogical work is in a file in some unknown box at my house.This bloodline is harder to track because it weaves in and out of the other 12bloodlines. There are many surnames which are part of this bloodline (includingthe Smith family), however I can give one very prominent one, the Sinclairfamily. We know that Satan is the father of all lies, and Christ told thereligions leader who went out to destroy him that they were from the seed ofSatan.The 13th Illuminati Bloodline.The 13th Illuminati Bloodline is where the Anti-Christ will come from. Thisbloodline believes that it has both the Holy Blood of Jesus and the blood (orseed) of Satan in its bloodline. In my Be Wise As Serpents book, I makereference to this bloodline but I never really took the time to explain itcompletely. In fact I don’t fully understand this bloodline myself. I encouragethose who want to learn more about this bloodline to study the following books: * Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Lincoln, Leigh & Balgent * The Messianic Legacy by Michael Baigent * TheTemple & the Lodge by Michael Baigent * Crusaders of the Grail by J.R. Church * The Anti-Christ King -- Juan Carlos by Dr. Charles R. TaylorThis bloodline is so extensive in its many branches that its membership takes inmany of the Presidents of the United States, including George Hush and GeorgeWashington. The reason that I gave the genealogies of the some of the MormonPresidents to people back in 1991 in my Be Wise As Serpents book is that all ofthe Mormon Presidents in history, whether RLDS or LDS, trace their blood back tothis 13th bloodline. Within the Illuminati rituals, the emphasis of the 13thbloodline is that they are the seed of Satan. As their secret story goes, theyare the direct descendants of Jesus’s spiritual brother Lucifer. Since theFreeman family and the Rothschild family have members who are also in the 13thbloodline, it is unclear to me how interwoven the \"seed of Satan\" is.Some of the earliest attempts to trace the seed of Satan were some books whichdid extensive research on the Tribe of Dan and the descendants of Cain.The Curse of Canaan is an interesting book along with its mate World Order byEustice Mullins. One of the books which I looked with difficulty for beforefinding it, was Gerald Massey’s A Book of the Beginning (Secaucus, NJ:University Books, Inc., 1974.) The book goes in and shows in detail how theinhabitants of the British Isles came originally from Egypt. This is Importantbecause (as this newsletter has always contended) the Druidism of the BritishIsles was simply a derivative from the Egyptian Satanic witchcraft/magic ofAncient Egypt. The Egyptian word Makhaut (clan or family) became the Irish Maccuand the Maccu of the Donalds (clan of Donalds) now reflected in the nameMacDonald. The sacred keepers of the Clan-Stone in Arran, were also known by thefamily name of Clan-Chattons. Another word for clan is Mack and theClan-Chattons were also known as Mack-Intosh. Ptah-rekh the name of the Egyptiangod Ptah was passed down to us by the Druids adopting the name Patrick, whichsounded similar. St. Patrick ’s Day then is a Christianized form of a druidicholiday which originally had its origins in Egypt. The All-Seeing Eye can befound on ancient buildings in ancient Chaldea, in ancient Greece, and in ancientEgypt. The MI-seeing eye represents Osiris. Osiris had debauched revelries(saturnalias) celebrated in his honor. The temples in Arabia clear back in thetime that Moses had his black father-in-law Jethro used the all-seeing-eye torepresent the false satanic trinity of Osiris, Isis and Horus of Egypt. ThisMI-Seeing Eye pops up everywhere the Illuminati has been. In the Winter PalaceSquare in St. Petersburg, Russia is that Illuminati all-seeing eye on top of apyramid. You will also see it in the old Mexican Senate Building which is now amuseum in Mexico City. You will find this on the back of our one dollar bill,and you will find the all-seeing eye was placed on Ethiopian stamps when theygot a communist government in power.The Illuminati is the continuation of the Mystery Religions of Babylon andEgypt. And the Bloodlines of the Illuminati go back to people who at one timelived in Babylon and Egypt. Just how the House of David (the Satanic one) andthe Holy Blood of the 13th family fit in with everything else in history I can’tsay. I’m sure It would be a big story to tell If I knew. But I do feel thatsomehow the 13th Illuminati family does goes back to ancient times. Is this viathe Tribe of Dan or via some Druidic bloodline or is it via the Merovingians oris it via all three, and where do the Guelphs and Black Nobility fit Into this?Whatever the case, the 13th bloodline has amassed a great deal of power andwealth on this planet. The 13th bloodline lacks nothing to bring forth theirAnti-Christ who will appear to have all the correct credentials. I would noteven be surprised if their Anti-Christ in order to appear real will exposeanother Anti-Christ. The 13th bloodline has kept its genealogies very secret. Iwould welcome more Input from informed persons about this bloodline. The tribeof Dan was prophesied to be the black sheep of the nation of Israel which wouldbite the other tribes of Israel. The tribe of Dan had the snake and the eagle asits two logos. The tribe of Dan left its calling card all over Europe as itmigrated west in the names of many places. The tribe of Dan ruled the Greeks,the Roman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and many others which used theeagle as its logo. Great Britain is the mother country of Satanism.[65][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn65] Scotland has long been an occult center. Thenational symbol of Scotland is the dragon (the snake), and for years the chiefof Scotland was called the dragon. The Gaelic language is an important languagefor Satanism, although English and French are also use extensively by theIlluminati. The planning sessions for world takeover that some ex-Satanistsexperienced were held in French. The British Royal Family have long beeninvolved with the occult. For more information on this there is a detailedexamination of the Royal family and the occult in the book The Prince and theParanormal -the Psychic Bloodline of the Royal Family by John Dale (1987).[66][part0000_split_013.html#_ftn66] They have also been actively involved withFreemasonry. (See the chart.) British MI6 has been a major vehicle for theSatanic hierarchy working behind the secret veil of Freemasonry to control worldevents.[67] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn67] British MI6 is the most secretintelligence organization in the world.[68] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn68] (Itis properly known as British Secret Service not to be confused with the U.S.agency by that name but performing a different function entirely.) The BritishRoyalty have served as important figureheads to British Freemasonry lendingcredibility and respectability. British Freemasonry has managed to keep itselffree of much of the criticism that the other national masonic groups havebrought on themselves. However, much of the credibility of British Freemasonryis undeserved. True, British Freemasonry is what it portrays itself to thepublic for the lower levels. But, the lower level Masons by their dues andactivities are unwittingly supporting an organization that is led by Satanistsat the top. An example of the subterfuge constantly exercised on the public byFreemasonry is a book purportedly written by a non-Mason entitled The UnlockedSecret Freemasonry Examined. The book portrays itself as an unbiased andcomplete expose of Freemasonry. The book states unequivocally that the Masonicorder called Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (sic] is only open to Christiansand is a \"Christian Order.\" However, Edith Star Miller reprints copies of anumber of letters from the chief of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia whichshow that the English Grand Masonic Lodge, the SRIA, the OTO, and the Germanilluminati are all working together.[69] [part0000_split_013.html#_ftn69] Shebriefly explains how she obtained the letters."},{"pageContent":" About the Author“Fritz Artz Springmeier (also known as Viktor E.
