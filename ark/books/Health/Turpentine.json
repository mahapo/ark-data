The oil is extracted from pine trees. In Ayurveda this tree is called “ Saral ”, and its scientific name is pinus roxburghi . The use of pine tree oil is also mentioned in the ancient Ayurvedic texts known as “ Bhavprakash ”, “ Charak Samhita ”, and “ Sushruta Samhita ”. The sap that is extracted from the pine tree is called “ rosin spirit ” or “ gandhviroja ” in ayurveda and after steam distillation the oil obtained is pure and free from any impurities and is called “the gum spirit of turpentine oil”. This oil can be used externally and internally to cure many diseases according to the Ayurvedic texts. There is a detailed explanation of the pine tree oil regarding its therapeutic uses and its side effects. Pine tree is placed in the category of plants called “ Sleysam Pootiher ”. This means the plants that cure infections and mucus. The main action is described as “ Jantughan ”. That means- it kills or removes parasites. It is recommended to cure abscess, pain, swelling, hemorrhage, respiratory problems, and digestive and skin problems. Turpentine acts as a blood purifier, brain stimulant, liver stimulant and diuretic. It has been a part of Ayurvedic medicines since ancient times.

The factors that leads to the overgrowth of candida are eating inorganic food, processed food, medicines, hormones, pesticides, chemicals, weak immune system, environmental stress, sedentary lifestyle, chronic infection, intestinal worms and diabetes, which makes a favorable environment for its growth. These factors play a role in damaging our cells inside the body directly by eating them and indirectly by releasing toxic material in side our digestive system. This leads to the imbalance in our gut micro flora. This also causes damage to our immune system. These changes create a favorable environment for the overgrowth of candida and other organisms in our body. This situation becomes worse when we eat food that also speeds up the growth of this microorganism. Candida infection can take place anywhere in the body and leads to a condition called candidiasis, also called thrush or moniliasis. In women, candida is also present in the vagina. When this yeast multiplies uncontrollably due to any reason, it causes pain and inflammation in the infected tissue. When it grows inside the body, it can cause infection in the bloodstream or it can reach the vital organs causing systemic yeast infection.

The reason behind the overgrowth of candida is the wrong food habits, their wrong combinations, and the use of pesticides and chemicals that we eat daily. Whereas intestinal parasites infestation takes place due to contaminated food and water, moreover a poor level of sanitation is also a major cause. Certain foods should be avoided before starting treatment to prepare the body’ environment for candida and intestinal worms to leave the body. It is important to stop eating inorganically grown food, processed food like refined flour, refined sugar, fried food, fast food, juices with added sugar, food that contains yeast. Only eat freshly cooked food and avoid reheating and eating a food that is left from the last meal.

It contains the organic trace minerals in ionic form and many active enzymes and minerals. To get maximum nutrition out of a salad it must be chewed properly and slowly. The amount of salad, that should be taken is according to body weight. Take two percent salad of your body weight.

It improves the digestion and healing of the intestine. There is one special fruit that must be part of your daily diet during this process. That fruit is watermelon and you should eat a small portion of it along with its seeds. Do not discard the seeds because they are antiparasitic in action. Eating watermelon seeds is important because both the outer and inner part of the seed kills the roundworms and other large-size intestinal worms by tearing apart their soft body structure."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Benefits of Blood and Urine Test I t is important to do a few blood tests before starting a treatment.

An oral solution that contains mannitol and lactulose is given to the patient and a urine test is done. This test confirms the presence of leaky gut. The next test is a blood IgE antibody test to identify food allergies. It helps to know the food allergies that are present before treatment. Blood and urine culture tests are also important to check for the presence of chronic infection. A stool test can be done to check for presence of parasites and their eggs."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Achieving Optimal Hydration W ater is an excellent detoxifier and nourishes the body quickly. The most important part for turpentine oil protocol is to achieve an optimal level of hydration in our body. Even a mild level of dehydration can significantly affect our physical and emotional abilities. An adult should drink up to two liters or more water per day. Ayurveda provides the details of the different type of water, and rain water is recommends as the superior most type of water available for human consumption. Rain-water comes from the clouds and is in the purest form before it reaches the ground and becomes impure. In the modern, world distilled water is equivalent to rain-water in its purity. If there is no access to distilled water, then filtered and boiled water must be used. Moreover, it prevents the side effects that can take place due to the accumulation of toxins after the detoxification process. The best way to keep your-self-hydrated is to sip water every half an hour and to take fluids in your diet. Water inside vegetables and fruits is also a kind of distilled water, and taking vegetables and fruit juices is also beneficial to keep your-self-hydrated."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Importance of Water Enema A n enema is known as “Basti ” in the Ayurveda. A water enema is the most basic part of cleaning the large intestine and is the only way to get rid of toxins that are deposited in our intestine. Here we are talking about a simple water enema that can be done easily at home. It is a powerful method that helps everyone while using the turpentine oil. You must buy a good home enema kit and learn to use it before we start the actual process. Distilled water should be used here, so that we can achieve maximum benefits. Start using the enema a few days before starting the actual treatment. An enema can be done in the morning on an empty stomach or in the afternoon before lunch or at night before dinner. It must be done once a day or, for better results, twice daily. Never do it just after taking any kind of food; you can do it before taking food or one hour after taking food. You can mix black walnut wormwood herbal formulation in your enema water to kill the parasites that live in the large intestine. Adding one to two ml is enough to use for a week and then repeat. Lemon can be added in enema water for better cleaning. A coffee enema is also beneficial to detoxify your digestive system. A water enema can be done with hot or cold water. Hot water usually comes out more quickly than the cold water. Cold water dissolves the toxins and fecal matter easily and cleans the intestinal wall efficiently. Cold water is good to kill intestinal worms that live in the large intestine because worms cannot live in a cold environment, and they rely on the host for maintaining their body temperature."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Bowel Movements I n Ayurveda, one to two bowel movements are considered healthy. To achieve a daily bowel movement both optimal hydration and a plant-based diet are required. A normal bowel movement is necessary to achieve maximum benefits during the treatment. Many people do not have a single bowel movement in a day. This leads to constipation, which in turn causes an environment that leads to the growth of parasites. There are many natural laxatives that can be used to achieve one or more bowel movements daily. In Ayurveda, harda powder, also known as terminalia chebula, is used to cure constipation and indigestion to prevent the formation and accumulation of toxins. Take five to ten grams of it with warm water before sleeping night until you finish the treatment. If the large intestine is clean, then parasites move out of the body easily and an enema also provides great relief. Moreover, a clean large intestine means no food for parasites, and they are expelled too. If constipation is present, then it becomes difficult to remove toxins and parasites from our digestive system. This leads to many side effects and unwanted symptoms, so it is important to achieve at least one bowel movement daily."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Turpentine Allergy Test I t is important to check if you are allergic to turpentine oil before starting this treatment. It’s a powerful essential oil and can trigger allergic reactions in the body that can have life threatening side effects. There are two methods to test it. The first step is to apply at least two drops on your skin and one drop under your tongue and see if you notice any difficulty in breathing or any rashes or irritation on the skin and under the tongue. In case any allergic reaction is noticed, then do not use the turpentine oil. The second method is to get a blood test done from a laboratory to check allergy against the pine tree. Many people who suffer from respiratory problems have allergy from pine tree pollens. Start the actual treatment once it is confirmed that there is no allergic reaction to it. Do not use turpentine if you are allergic to it because it will cause more harm than benefit to your body."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Which Type of Turpentine is Safe to Use? O nly therapeutic-grade turpentine oil is safe to use. It must be free of contamination and always prepared with the steam distillation process, from the gum of the pine tree.

There are two methods to find out the correct dose, both are explained below."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"First Method T he first method is using the carrier oil with turpentine oil. Starting on day one, you must take a small dose of the turpentine oil. You should add a carrier oil to the turpentine oil to dilute it. The recommended oils that act as carriers for turpentine oil are coconut oil and castor oil. The simple method to know the correct dose is to use turpentine oil with a dropper so that you can count the drops of the oil. Put two drops of turpentine oil in to a mixture of coconut oil and castor oil. Mix it well and swallow it with water. This is the lowest dose that may produce no effect. You must be looking for any positive change in your health. Now on the second day, double the quantity of turpentine oil to four drops. Day three, it should be eight drops and on day four, is sixteen drops. Now do not double it after day four because we are close to seeing some changes in our health. On day five, take twenty-four drops which is equal to one ml of the turpentine, and mix it in the carrier oil. On day six, take forty-eight drops of turpentine oil, which is equal to two ml. Finally, on day seven, take seventy-two drops of turpentine oil, which is equal to three ml. You may discover a correct dose for yourself at three ml dose or before it. The maximum dose that is safe to take is three ml so do not exceed that."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Second Method T he second method is using white sugar with turpentine oil. White sugar cubes are used as a carrier for turpentine oil as described by the Western doctor Jennifer Daniels. In this method, just use turpentine oil with white sugar cubes instead of castor oil and coconut oil. You need to put in enough turpentine oil to saturate a sugar cube, and you can use more sugar cubes as you require. Day one, use two drops and double the number of drops each day until you reach sixteen drops on day four. From day five, take one ml that is equal to twenty-four drops. On day six use two ml or forty-eight drops, and finally on day seven, you can reach a maximum dose of three ml or a seventy-two-drop limit. A correct working dose of turpentine oil may be different for everyone, and once you discover it you should not exceed this dose limit. The method of adding turpentine oil on sugar cubes is also important. Here is a simple formula. Just use fifteen drops of turpentine oil on one sugar cube, then use a second sugar cube same way. This also prevents many issues regarding the use of turpentine and sugar."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Signs of Correct Dose Y ou should be looking for positive changes in your health while finding the correct dose of turpentine oil.

This dose may be equal to three ml of the turpentine oil or less. You should not exceed this dose at any time and strictly stick to it to avoid any side effects that may arise due to overdose. Now you know the dose of the turpentine that works for you. You must take a few days off now before starting the actual treatment; because while searching a correct dose, many parasites die or start to leave the host body.

It is essential to do an enema at this stage and to keep the body hydrated. Take enough rest so that the body can detoxify easily. Eat salad and mono meals as described before. You must see an improvement in the illness symptoms completely, and now onwards you do not need to repeat this process until you have any candida infection in the future.

Most of the intestinal parasites live in the small intestine. To do a parasite cleanse, take turpentine oil and mix it with ten ml of coconut oil and five ml of castor oil. Follow it for three to five days until your intestine is clear. If you are taking a higher dose of castor oil, then do this process on an empty stomach in the morning. You can have a light meal when you feel hungry. If you are a taking low dose of castor oil, then start the treatment any time that suits you or take it just before bed time after food. Castor oil is a laxative, and it must be tested independently before using it to know the dose that suits you. A lower dose leads to mild laxative effects whereas, a high dose leads to a greater number of bowel movements. Follow this treatment for three to four days depending on the severity of the disease.
