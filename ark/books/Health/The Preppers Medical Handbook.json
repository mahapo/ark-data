Thesecircumstances might include the breakdown in normal emergency support services(such as 911), the lack of the ability to obtain additional supplies, and theprobability that you will not be able to rely on anyone but members of yourimmediate group or yourself.Obviously, prepping requires forethought with regard to food, water supplies,power, and protection—all areas of significant technical preparation requiringskill sets and supplies. Self-reliant medical care is no exception. Evenadvanced first aid classes such as Wilderness First Responder and TacticalCombat Casualty Care rely eventually on evacuation as part of the treatmentprotocol. Under the situation of impractical or impossible evacuation, a meansof providing a plan for long-term management must be available.This book provides the basis of prevention, identification, and long-termmanagement of survivable medical conditions and can be performed with minimaltraining. It helps you identify sources of materials you will need and shouldstockpile, discusses storage issues, and directs you to sources for more-complexprocedures requiring advanced concepts of field-expedient techniques that couldbe of use to trained medical persons such as surgeons, anesthesiologists,dentists, and midwives.Two critical components of medical prepping is the concept of “off grid” versus“no grid.” This book is structured around this concept. You will be advised howto manage most problems with no outside assistance, that is, without contactwith the grid. However, it is also important to know when it is important torely on grid support, when a patient should be seen by an advanced careprovider. But then back to the other issues: What if there is no grid or it isimpossible for you to return to the grid for whatever reason? Then you must alsoknow how to provide management under a TEOTWAWKI (the end of the world as weknow it) event, when the grid simply will not be available to you.While this book is based upon my book Wilderness Medicine, 7th edition (Falcon,2017), numerous modifications have been made to address the uniquely differentaspect of prepper medical care from the experiences facing wildernessexpeditions into remote areas. Living in a remote cabin in northern Manitoba fora winter does qualify as a sort of “prepping”; this book is also based upon overforty years of experience with such activities. Providing medical care on dozensof medical service projects in remote areas of Haiti and elsewhere also providesthe basis of my experience to write the ultimate prep-per’s medical handbook.But the greatest inspiration for my prepper instincts comes from my thirtymonths in Vietnam as a young infantry officer and the training I had inpreparation for my military experiences. I have never stopped training,preparing, and experiencing the activities required to help others survive theirenvironment and their medical situation. With this book I pass on this knowledgeto you so that you can prepare and then act to manage medical problems in theultimate austere environment, the one in which you must be fully self-dependentfor even emergent medical care without any help from “the grid.”HOW TO USE THIS BOOK [nav.xhtml#sub2]There are four ways to rapidly identify where in this book to find theinformation you need.FIRSTA quick glance through the contents can lead you to the proper chapter andsubject.SECONDThe Initial Assessment (pages 6 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_6]–8[Chapter02.xhtml#page_8]) and the Focused Assessment (pages 8[Chapter02.xhtml#page_8]–9 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_9]) not only describe how toperform a physical examination and what to look for, but these sections alsorefer you to the page of the book that tells you what to do if something iswrong.THIRDThroughout the book various sections have diagnostic tables with references tofurther evaluate or explain treatment options. For problems that fall into thesecategories, you can refer directly to the tables indicated in the list belowList of Diagnostic Tables/ReferencesAbdominal Problems Table 3-6 [Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.6] Bites and Stings page 193[Chapter08.xhtml#page_193] Ear Problems Table 3-5 [Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.5]Environmental Injuries page 246 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_246] Eye Problems Table3-4 [Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.4] Infectious Diseases Tables 9-1[Chapter09.xhtml#tab9.1] and 9-2 [Chapter09.xhtml#tab9.2] Orthopedic Injuriespage 159 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_159] Shock page 13 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_13] SoftTissue Care page 116 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_116] Symptom Management Table 3-1[Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.1]FOURTHThe Clinical Reference Index at the end of the book provides a comprehensivecross-reference between symptoms, conditions, and treatments. Subjects arelisted using both medical jargon and vernacular descriptions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 [nav.xhtml#ch02]ASSESSMENT AND STABILIZATION [nav.xhtml#ch02]ASSESSMENT AND CARE [nav.xhtml#sub3]The technique of providing aid to an injured person is similar to givingappropriate treatment to someone who complains of sickness or sudden pain from anoninjury cause. Proper care can result only if several basic steps areperformed correctly. The basics are straightforward, and you should not beintimidated by this process. The problem with medicine in general is that thereare so many possible diagnoses and treatments that the whole thing can seemoverwhelming. It is not, however, if you follow certain logical steps.These logical steps form the basis of starting the decision tree that will leadalmost automatically to a correct course of action. They simplify the processinto a much less scary proposition. The initial phase is assessment, the secondphase is stabilization, and the third phase is treatment. While the first aidapproach only includes assessment, this book is concerned with developingapproaches to definitive treatment that could be reasonably performed in remoteareas by relatively untrained (and undoubtedly very concerned) friends of thesuddenly impaired.Trauma assessment is divided into two phases called the initial assessment andfocused assessment. What good is an assessment if you don’t know what to do withthe information? During rescue operations, what you do with the information isrecord it. This recorded information, which includes periodic reassessment data,can be valuable to physicians at treatment centers, as it indicates either astable or a deteriorating patient and helps direct the future course of action.For those of us stuck with caring for the patient in a remote area, this datacan be used to begin a decision tree that will help determine our best course ofaction. Sometimes this will be definitive treatment; other times it will amountto minimizing the damage and striving to keep the victim as functional aspossible, or sometimes just alive.Assessment and Care 4 Initial Assessment 6 Survey the Scene 6 Check the Airwayand Breathing 6 Check Circulation 7 Check for Severe Bleeding 7 Check theCervical Spine 7 Focused Assessment 8 The Physical Exam 8 Vital Signs 9 Level ofResponsiveness 10 Pulse 10 Respirations 10 Skin Signs 10 Blood Pressure 11Temperature 11 Oxygen saturation 11 Medical History and Physical Examination 12Head 12 Neck 12 Chest 12 Abdomen 13 Back 13 Pelvis/Hip 13 Legs 13 Shoulders andArms 13 Shock 13 Difficult Respirations 16 Foreign Body Airway Obstruction 16Adult One-Rescuer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) 17 Adult Two-Rescuer CPR20 Rapid Breathing 21 Cardiac Evaluation and Care 22 Heart Attack—MyocardialInfarction 22 Rapid Heart Rate 25 Tachycardia 25 Slow Heart Rate 25 Bradycardia25INITIAL ASSESSMENT [nav.xhtml#sub4]SURVEY THE SCENE [nav.xhtml#sub5]Before assessing the patient, assess the scene! Accidents tend to multiply. Makesure the scene is safe for the rescuers and the victim. Ensure that thesituation does not become worse. This step can include such diverse aspects asavoiding further avalanches or rock-falls and ensuring adequate clothing andfood supplies for rescuers. Initially, however, scene assessment should consistof looking for immediate hazards that might result in more casualties among thegroup attempting to help the victim.CHECK THE AIRWAY AND BREATHING [nav.xhtml#sub6]Check the airway. If the victim can talk, his airway is functioning. In anunconscious patient, place your ear next to his nose/mouth and your hand on hischest and look, listen, and feel for air movement.No air movement: Check to see whether the tongue is blocking the airway bypushing down on the forehead while lifting the chin.In case of possible neck injury, the airway can be opened by lifting the jawwithout moving the neck. Open the victim’s mouth and visually inspect, removingany objects you can see.Still no air movement: Pinch his nose, seal your mouth over his, and try tobreathe air into his lungs. If the first attempt to breathe air into the victimfails, you should reposition the victim’s head and try again.Still no air movement: Perform chest thrusts, similar to the compressions ofcardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); see page 17 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_17].Perform 30 compressions followed by attempts to breathe in air as directedabove.Once you are able to establish air movement, continue compressions until thevictim’s heart is beating and no longer requires compressions and he isbreathing on his own. See one-person and two-person CPR on pages 17[Chapter02.xhtml#page_17]-20 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_20].CHECK CIRCULATION [nav.xhtml#sub7]Check circulation by placing several of your fingertips lightly into the hollowbelow the angle of the patient’s jaw. See figure 2-1.No pulse : Start CPR; see page 17 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_17].chpt_fig_001 [../Images/chpt_fig_001.jpg]Figure 2-1.Position of fingers to check for the carotid artery pulseCHECK FOR SEVERE BLEEDING [nav.xhtml#sub8]Check quickly for severe blood loss. Check visually and with your hands. Slideyour hand under the victim to ensure that blood is not leaking into the groundor snow, and check inside bulky garments for hidden blood loss.Severe bleeding: Use direct pressure and/or a tourniquet; see page 118[Chapter06.xhtml#page_118].CHECK THE CERVICAL SPINE [nav.xhtml#sub9]During the primary assessment, keep the head and neck as still as possible ifthere is any suspicion of a cervical spine injury. This may certainly be thecase if the patient is unconscious or suffering from an accident such as a steepfall, a sudden stop, or significant blows to the head. See treatment of spineinjuries, page 168 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_168].In their excellent book Medicine for the Backcountry (Globe Pequot Press, 1999),Buck Tilton and Frank Hubbell state, “Do not let fear of spinal cord injuryblind you to more immediate threats to life. If the scene is not safe, thepatient may need to be carefully moved. If the airway is not open, grasp thesides of your patient’s head firmly, and pull with steady, gentle traction, andattempt to align the head and neck with the rest of the body. Gentle tractionshould be maintained until mechanical stabilization can be improvised.” Seespinal cord management, page 167 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_167].FOCUSED ASSESSMENT [nav.xhtml#sub10]THE PHYSICAL EXAM [nav.xhtml#sub11]While the purpose of the initial assessment (formerly called the primary orhasty survey) is to rapidly find and correct life-threatening conditions, thefocused assessment (formerly identified as the secondary survey) is an attemptto identify all of the medical problems that the patient might have. Thisrequires a thorough examination because sometimes an obvious injury can bedistracting: A broken bone may cause both you and the victim not to notice aless painful but potentially more serious injury elsewhere.The only way to perform a focused assessment is to do it thoroughly, using bothyour vision and sense of touch, asking simple questions, and being methodical inthe approach. Sense of touch is important. Sliding your hand under the victimmight find areas of tenderness or even considerable blood loss that wouldotherwise be unnoticed. It is surprising how much blood can be absorbed intosnow or sand under a wounded victim and not even be noticed until your handencounters it.The mission of the focused assessment is not only to discover various medicalproblems but also to record and keep track of them during periodicreassessments. The reassessment information is even more important than thefirst set of information taken during the initial focused assessment. How oftenthe focused assessment needs to be repeated and how extensive it needs to bedepend primarily on the history of the event. Very serious-appearing eventscould initially require total body reassessment every 15 minutes. There can beno hard and fast rule concerning how often to repeat reassessments and howextensive they must be. There is no escaping the use of common sense. Eventuallyreassessment every few hours, even discontinuing this process, will becomeproper. This is particularly appropriate when the examination is unchanged andstable, the patient is alert, and you obviously have effectively dealt with theinjuries. The scheme for recording this information is in the form of a SOAPnote, which stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan.The most significant difference between off-grid and standard urban first aid isthat the focused assessment when you are off the grid must also lead totreatment protocols. This methodical examination should generally start at thehead and work its way to the feet. The exception could be children, where youmight want to alleviate their apprehension by starting with their legs beforeexamining their heads. Generally starting at the head is best. Some ethnicgroups demand this. For example, Romani find it insulting to be touched abovethe waist directly after being touched below the waist. This is good to know ifyou are coexisting with Romani.General Principles of the Focused Physical Assessment:1. Start at the top and work your way down. 2. Move the patient as little aspossible and try not to aggravate known injuries while looking for others.3. Constantly communicate with the patient during the examination, even if sheseems unconscious.4. Look for damage, even cutting away clothing if necessary to visualizesuspected injuries.5. Ask about pain, discomfort, and abnormal sensations constantly during theexam.6. Gently feel all relevant body parts for abnormalities.VITAL SIGNS [nav.xhtml#sub12]While even accurate measurements of the body’s functions may not indicate whatis wrong with a patient, the second and subsequent measurements indicate howwell the patient is doing. You will need to use common sense to determine howoften the signs are taken, but certainly close monitoring of the patient shouldbe continued until she is “out of the woods,” either literally or figuratively.Vital signs consist of several elements: level of responsiveness, pulse,respirations, skin signs, blood pressure, and temperature.LEVEL OF RESPONSIVENESS [nav.xhtml#sub13]Is the patient alert, or does she respond only to verbal or painful stimulus? Oris she unresponsive? She should know who she is, where she is, what happened toher, and about what time of the day it is. Responsiveness ranges from alert toverbal (responsive to spoken contact) to pain (not responsive to verbal contactbut responsive to being pinched or rubbed on the shin) to unresponsive.PULSE [nav.xhtml#sub14]Check and record rate, rhythm, and quality (weak, normal, or strong) of thepulse. If an injury has been sustained by a limb, check pulses on both injuredand uninjured limbs, and compare.Shock, see page 13 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_13].Deformed fracture causing a decreased pulse, see page 178[Chapter07.xhtml#page_178].RESPIRATIONS [nav.xhtml#sub15]Note the rate, rhythm, and quality of respirations (labored, with pain, flaringof nostrils, or noise such as snores, squeaks, gurgles, or gasps). An adultnormally breathes 12 to 18 times per minute, while children breathe faster.Respiratory difficulties, see page 16 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_16].SKIN SIGNS [nav.xhtml#sub16]Check skin color, particularly in the nonpigmented areas of the body, and notewhether skin is hot/cold and moist/dry.Hot, fever, see page 11 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_11].Heat stress, see page 255 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_255].Cold, shock, see page 13 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_13].Hypothermia, see page 246 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_246].Yellow skin, jaundice, see page 225 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_225].Anemia, see page 31 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_31].BLOOD PRESSURE [nav.xhtml#sub17]Blood pressure can be measured with a stethoscope and blood pressure cuff or byestimating. If you can feel a pulse in the radial artery at the wrist, the top(systolic) pressure is probably at least 80 mm Hg. If you can feel the femoralpulse only in the groin, the pressure is no lower than 70 mm Hg. When only thecarotid pulse in the neck is palpable, the systolic is probably at least 60 mm.Normal systolic blood pressures range from 100 to 140. Low upper blood pressureswith normal pulses (70 to 85 beats per minute) are safe. But an increased pulserate with a low pressure is an indication of shock.TEMPERATURE [nav.xhtml#sub18]Oral thermometers will give the most accurate field temperatures unless theambient temperature is close to the room temperature of a Ritz-Carlton resort,in which case forehead infrared or ear temperature thermometers are convenient,until their batteries wear out. Plastic direct-contact thermometers also requirea similar ambient temperature range for accuracy. An estimation of fever can bemade if the person’s normal resting pulse rate is known. Each degree Fahrenheitwill generally result in a 10-beats-per-minute pulse increase. There areexceptions, such as typhoid fever, when there is a relatively slow heart ratefor a high fever (see page 242 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_242]).OXYGEN SATURATION [nav.xhtml#sub19]I have not included a pulse oximeter in the Off-Grid Medical Kit. If you haveanyone in your group with a lung problem, you need to consider an oxygenconcentrator and a renewable power supply. This is very reasonable equipment tomanage, both acquisition cost and weight. A pulse oximeter is only $30 andavailable over the counter at most pharmacies. Portable oxygen concentrators donot require prescriptions and power units—and power units are a mainstay of anyprepper project, so no need for me to belabor the topic here.MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION [nav.xhtml#sub20]Taking a medical history allows you to factor in your patient’s previous orcurrent illnesses as they may relate to the situation at hand. Before or duringyour actual physical examination, if the patient is not in an acute stage, askabout any allergies, medications that your patient is taking, health history,last food or drink, and about the events that led up to the accident. If he isin pain, ask what provokes it, what action (if any) decreases its intensity,whether it radiates, how severe it is, what type it is (burning, sharp, dull),and when it started.HEAD [nav.xhtml#sub21]Look for damage, discoloration, and blood or fluid draining from ears, nose, andmouth. Ask about loss of consciousness, pain, or any abnormal sensations. Feelfor lumps or other deformities.Losses of consciousness, see page 165 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_165].Headache, see page 36 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_36].Ear trauma, see page 54 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_54].Eye trauma, see page 37 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_37].Nose trauma, see page 53 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_53].Mouth trauma, see page 131 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_131].NECK [nav.xhtml#sub22]Look for obvious damage or deviation of the windpipe (trachea). Ask about painand discomfort. Feel along the cervical spine for a pain response.Cervical spine trauma, see page 167 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_167].CHEST [nav.xhtml#sub23]Compress the ribs from both sides, as if squeezing a birdcage, keeping yourhands wide to prevent the possibility of too much direct pressure on fractures.Look for damage or deformities. Ask about pain. Feel for instability.Chest trauma, see page 191 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_191].Difficulty breathing, see page 16 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_16].ABDOMEN [nav.xhtml#sub24]With hands spread wide, press gently on the abdomen. Look for damage. Ask aboutpain and discomfort. Feel for rigidity, distention, or muscle spasms.Abdominal pain, see page 65 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_65].BACK [nav.xhtml#sub25]Slide your hands under the patient, palpating as much of the spine as possible.Spine trauma, see page 168 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_168].PELVIS/HIP [nav.xhtml#sub26]Place your hands on the top front of the pelvis on both sides (the iliaccrests), pressing gently down and pulling toward the midline of the body. Askabout pain. Feel for instability.Hip or pelvis pain, see page 185 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_185].LEGS [nav.xhtml#sub27]One at a time, with your hands surrounding the leg, run your hands from thegroin down to the toes, squeezing as you go. Note especially if there is a lackof circulation, sensation, or motion in the toes. Repeat for the other leg.Bone injury, see page 154 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_154].SHOULDERS AND ARMS [nav.xhtml#sub28]One at a time, with hands wide, squeeze the shoulder, and run your hands downthe arms to the fingers. Check for circulation, sensation, and motion in thefingers. Repeat for the other shoulder.Shoulder trauma, see page 172 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_172].Joint trauma, see page 158 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_158].Broken bone, see page 161 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_161].SHOCK [nav.xhtml#sub29]Shock is a deficiency in oxygen supply reaching the brain and other tissues as aresult of decreased circulation. An important aspect in the correction of shockis to identify and treat the underlying cause. Shock can be caused by burns,electrocution, hypothermia, bites, stings, bleeding, fractures, pain,hyperthermia, high altitude cerebral edema, illness, rough handling, allergicreaction (anaphylaxis), damage or excitement to the central nervous system,dehydration from sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea, or loss of adequate heartstrength. Each of these underlying causes is discussed separately in this text.Shock can progress through several stages before death results. The first phaseis called the compensatory stage, during which the body attempts to counter thedamage by increasing its activity level. Arteries constrict and the pulse rateincreases, thus maintaining the blood pressure. The next phase is called theprogressive stage (or decompensatory stage), when suddenly the blood pressuredrops and the patient worsens, often swiftly. When he has reached theirreversible stage, vital organs have suffered from loss of oxygen so profoundlythat death occurs even with aggressive treatment.Consider the possibility of shock in any victim of an accident or whensignificant illness develops. Ensure that an adequate airway is established (seefurther discussion under Adult One-Rescuer CPR, page 17[Chapter02.xhtml#page_17]). Assess the cardiovascular status. Place your handover the carotid artery (figure 2-1) to obtain the pulse. In compensatory shockthe patient will have a weak, rapid pulse. In adults the rate will be over 140;in children, 180 beats per minute. If there is doubt about a pulse beingpresent, listen to the bare chest. If cardiac standstill is present, beginone-person or two-person CPR (see pages 17 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_17]–20[Chapter02.xhtml#page_20]). Elevate the legs 45 degrees to obtain a betterreturn of venous blood to the heart and head. However, if there has been asevere head injury, keep the person flat. If he has trouble breathing, elevatethe chest and head to a comfortable position. Protect the patient from theenvironment with insulation underneath and shelter above. Strive to make himcomfortable. Watch your spoken and body language. Reassure without patronizing,and let nothing that you say or do cause him increased distress.Attempt to treat the underlying cause of the shock. The primary or secondaryassessment and history may well elicit the cause of shock, and appropriatetreatment can be devised from the field-expedient methods listed in this book.Shock due to severe allergic reactions is called anaphylactic shock and isdiscussed on page 193 [Chapter08.xhtml#page_193].Vasovagal syncope is a common form of shock. Sometimes called fainting, the clueis a very slow heartbeat in the patient. Generally something has happened to thepatient that precipitates this reaction, such as witnessing blood loss inherself or another person, receiving an injection (or even witnessing someoneelse receiving one), or perhaps attending one of my medical lectures. (See slowheart rate, page 25 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_25].)Decision/Care TableIf no breathing is present—from whatever cause—see Adult One-Rescuer CPR, page 17 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_17].If no heartbeat is present—from whatever cause—see Adult One-Rescuer CPR, page 17 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_17].If associated with high altitude (above 6,500 feet),see High Altitude Illnesses, page 265 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_265].If associated with cold conditions,see Hypothermia, page 247 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_247].If body temperature is over 100°F with cough,see Bronchitis/Pneumonia, page 63 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_63].If body temperature is over 100°F without cough,see Fever/Chills, page 29 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_29].If severe pain, sudden onset after trauma,see Chest Injuries, page 191 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_191].If severe pain, sudden onset, no trauma,see Pneumothorax, page 63 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_63]see Pulmonary Embolus, page 64 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_64]see Cardiac Evaluation and Care, page 22 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_22].If associated with hysterical reaction,see Rapid Breathing, page 21 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_21].If associated with choking,see Foreign Body Airway Obstruction, page 16 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_16].If associated with dull ache in middle of chest,see Cardiac Evaluation and Care, page 22 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_22].DIFFICULT RESPIRATIONS [nav.xhtml#sub30]It has been stated that you can live three minutes without air, three dayswithout water, three weeks without food, and three months without love. Whilesome feel that they may stretch any of these time limits to four, others feelthey could survive only the shorter periods. Without any question, adequaterespirations are the most significant demand of the living creature. Whenrespiratory difficulties start, it’s urgent to find the reason and alleviate it.When breathing stops, reestablishing airflow is critical.FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION [nav.xhtml#sub31]If a conscious adult seems to be experiencing distressed breathing, ask, “Areyou choking?” A choking victim cannot talk but may be making a high-pitchedsound during attempts to breathe. He or she will rapidly become a bluish colorand unconscious if the blockage is total. If the victim is apparently choking,perform an abdominal thrust to relieve foreign body airway obstruction. If thevictim is standing or sitting, stand behind and wrap your arms around thepatient, proceeding as follows: Make a fist with one hand. Place the thumb sideof the fist against the victim’s abdomen, in the mid-line slightly above thenavel and well below the breastbone. Grasp your fist with the other hand. Liftyour elbows away from the victim’s body and press your fist into the victim’sabdomen with a quick upward thrust. Each new thrust should be a separate anddistinct movement. It may be necessary to repeat the thrust multiple times toclear the airway. If the person is obese or pregnant, use chest thrusts in thesame manner as described, but place your arms around the lower chest and yourfists on the center of the victim’s sternum.chpt_fig_002 [../Images/chpt_fig_002.jpg]Figure 2-2.The abdominal thrust, formerly called the Heimlich maneuverIf the victim becomes unconscious and is on the ground, she should be placed onher back, face up. In civilization and on the grid, you would activate theemergency medical services (EMS) system by calling 911. Perform a tongue-jawlift, open the mouth, and remove any visible objects. With the airway open, tryto ventilate. If still obstructed, reposition the head and try to ventilateagain. If still obstructed, give 30 chest thrusts, followed by 2 attempts toventilate as described above. Each time you open the mouth to ventilate thevictim, check for a visible obstruction and remove it if you see one. Repeatthese steps until effective.ADULT ONE-RESCUER CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) [nav.xhtml#sub32]Note: This brief presentation of the basics of CPR reflects research indicatingthe importance of immediately reestablishing circulation via chest compressions.If you are without training in rescue breathing, you may choose to performhands-only CPR.To establish unresponsiveness, first try talking—clearly and loudly—to thevictim, asking questions such as “Are you OK? Can you hear me?” If there is noresponse to your verbal contact, make gentle physical contact by touching thevictim’s shoulder and repeating your questions. If gentle contact fails, apply apainful stimulus, such as a pinch to the back of the arm. If the patient remainsunresponsive, in civilization, activate the EMS system (call 911) prior toattempting CPR. Off the grid immediately proceed with the following steps.Check for signs of circulation that include coughing, breathing, or movement. Ifyou have been trained, you may also check for a carotid pulse. This is found byplacing your hand on the voice box (larynx). Slip the tips of your fingers intothe groove beside the voice box and feel for the pulse (see figure 2-1). Checkfor circulation for a maximum of 10 seconds.If the victim is unresponsive with no signs of circulation, start chestcompressions.Chest compressions are performed by the rescuer kneeling at the victim’s side,near his chest. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the sternum. Placethe other hand on top of the one that is in position on the sternum (see figure2-3). Be sure to keep your fingers off the ribs. The easiest way to prevent thisis to interlock your fingers, thus keeping them confined to the sternum. Withyour shoulders directly over the victim’s sternum, compress downward, keepingyour arms straight. Depress the sternum at least 2 inches. Relax the pressurecompletely, keeping your hands in contact with the sternum at all times, butallowing the sternum to return to its normal position between compressions. Bothcompression and relaxation should be of equal duration.Perform 30 external chest compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute.Push down hard, and push down fast.Open the airway using the head-tilt/chin-lift or jaw-thrust technique (seefigure 2-4). Place one hand on the victim’s forehead and apply firm backwardpressure with the palm to tilt the head back. Place the fingers of the otherhand under the bony part of the lower jaw near the chin and lift to bring thechin forward and the teeth almost shut, thus supporting the jaw and helping totilt the head back, as indicated in figure 2-4. In case of a suspected neckinjury, use the chin-lift without the head-tilt technique. The nose is pinchedshut by using the thumb and index finger of the hand on the forehead.chpt_fig_001 [../Images/chpt_fig_003.jpg]Figure 2-3.(A) Position of hands, (B) position of rescuerThe chin-lift method will place tension on the tongue and throat structures toensure that the air passage will open.If breathing is absent, give 2 slow breaths (about 1 second per breath),watching the chest rise, then allow for exhalation between breaths. Thebreathing rate should be once about every 6 seconds. Using slow breaths reducesthe amount of air that tends to enter the stomach and cause gastric distention.After 5 cycles of 30:2 compressions and ventilations (lasting about 2 minutes),reevaluate the patient. Check for the return of circulation. If it is absent,resume CPR with 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths, as indicated above. If itis present, continue to the next step. Check breathing. If present, monitorbreathing and pulse closely. If absent, perform rescue breathing at 1 breathabout every 6 seconds and monitor pulse closely.If CPR is continued, do not interrupt CPR for more than 5 seconds except inspecial circumstances. Once CPR is started, it should be maintained untilprofessional assistance can take over the responsibility, or until a physiciandeclares the patient dead. If CPR has been continued for 30 minutes withoutregaining cardiac function, and the eyes are fixed and nonreactive to light, thepatient can be presumed dead. The exceptions would be hypothermia (see page 247[Chapter10.xhtml#page_247]) and lightning injuries (page 261[Chapter10.xhtml#page_261]). In these circumstances, if professional help doesnot intervene, CPR should be continued until the rescuers are exhausted.chpt_fig_004 [../Images/chpt_fig_004.jpg]Figure 2-4.The head-tilt/chin-lift method of opening the airway in an unconscious personSome authorities in remote-area rescues feel that the survival rate is very lowwithout defibrillation within 4 minutes by paramedics, and that CPR should notbe started when cardiac standstill is due to a heart attack. It certainly shouldnot be started or maintained under these conditions when its performance mightendanger the lives of members of the rescue party. Regardless, CPR is animportant skill that every person should master. The only way to learn thistechnique is to take a CPR course—it cannot be properly self-taught.ADULT TWO-RESCUER CPR [nav.xhtml#sub33]The two-rescuer technique differs in that Rescuer One will take a position bythe head and Rescuer Two assumes the position as described under one-rescuer CPR(page 17 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_17]).After establishing unresponsiveness (and activating the EMS system if incivilization) and finding no signs of circulation, Rescuer Two begins chestcompressions with his hands on the center of the patient’s sternum, at a rate ofat least 100 compressions per minute, and compressing the chest at least 2inches with each compression.After 30 compressions, Rescuer One opens the airway (head-tilt/chin-lift orjaw-thrust), takes a quick look for obstructions and removes any that arevisible, and then gives 2 breaths of about 1 second each. After 5 cycles of30:2, the two rescuers may switch places if one rescuer is experiencing fatigue.Two-person CPR is not generally taught to the public in basic courses to avoidconfusion. However, off the grid where prolonged CPR might be necessary, beingfamiliar with this technique can help alleviate the tremendous fatigue that CPRinduces in rescuers.RAPID BREATHING [nav.xhtml#sub13]Rapid breathing (hyperventilation syndrome or tachypnea) can either represent aserious medical condition or be the result of a harmless panic attack. Thissymptom in a diabetic is extremely dangerous, as it represents a very high bloodsugar level, but it can be prevented by proper diabetic management.High-altitude stress can result in hyperventilation (see page 265[Chapter10.xhtml#page_265]).The feeling of panic that results in very shallow breathing causes the victim tolose excessive amounts of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream. The resultingchange in the acid-base balance of the blood (respiratory alkalosis) will causea numb feeling around the mouth and in the extremities, and if the breathingpattern persists, it can even lead to violent spasms of the hands and feet. Thisform of hysteria can appear in teenagers and healthy young adults. It would behelpful for victims to rebreathe their air from a stuff sack to increase thecarbon dioxide level in the bloodstream. They need to be reassured and told toslow down the breathing. It is fine for them to draw long, deep breaths, as itis the rapid breathing that causes the loss of so much carbon dioxide.If necessary, from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module give Percogesic, 2 tablets,or from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module, give hydroxyzine hydrochloride,25 mg, 2 tablets. From the Rx Injectable Medication Module, hydroxyzinehydrochloride, 50 mg intramuscular (IM), is also helpful in treatinghyperventilation. These drugs are being used in this instance as antianxietydrugs. Brand names for hydroxyzine hydrochloride are Atarax (oral) and Vistaril(injectable).Diabetics must have access to a glucometer to check their blood sugar levels,even if they do not use insulin. A high sugar reading causing rapid breathing isa medical emergency requiring rapid evacuation. The management of diabetes isbeyond the scope of this book, but it must be well understood by diabetics goingoff the grid.CARDIAC EVALUATION AND CARE [nav.xhtml#sub14]HEART ATTACK (MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION) [nav.xhtml#sub36]The following symptoms are fairly classic for a person having an inadequateoxygen supply to the heart: chest heaviness or pain with exertion; pain or acheradiating into the neck or into the arms; sweating; clammy, pale appearance;shortness of breath. The pain is called angina and results from the heart musclestarving for oxygen. If the blockage is profound, heart muscle will die. This iscalled a myocar-dial infarction, and it means heart attack and damaged muscle.The cause of death is frequently a profound irregular heartbeat caused byelectrical irritation in the damaged muscle. Another cause of death is loss ofadequate power to pump blood from weakened heart muscle. A delayed cause ofdeath can be from the sudden rupture of the weakened heart wall.The most important thing for an individual on the grid with these symptoms isrest, which minimizes the oxygen requirement of the heart. Position the victimfor optimum comfort, generally with his head elevated about 45 degrees (seefigure 2-5). In some cases, even with an electrocardiogram, it is impossible fora trained physician to determine whether an individual is having a cardiacproblem. When in doubt, rest the patient and try to evacuate without having himdo any of the work. Treat him as a total invalid.Physical rest is preferred, but if air evacuation or litter transport isimpossible, the quickest route to the hospital is the best route, even if thevictim must walk at a slow pace. Reperfusion therapy (i.e., opening the coronaryarteries with medications or mechanical means), even up to 36 hourspost-infarction, reduces long-term mortality and complications.Oral therapy can reduce infarction size and improve mortality (see WildernessMedical Society Practice Guidelines for Wilderness Emergency Care, 5th edition,edited by William Forgey, MD, Falcon Guides, 2005). 1. 1.Immediately give the patient 4 chewable baby aspirin (81 mg each), then 1 daily afterward. Check to see if the victim is carrying any prescription heart medications and note usage instructions on the bottle.chpt_fig_005 [../Images/chpt_fig_005.jpg]Figure 2-5.A heart attack victim can usually breathe better sitting up. 1. 2.Give sublingual glycerin if anyone in the party is carrying it. If you are carrying the Rx Cardiac Medication Module, you will have nitroglycerin spray. Do not give it, however, if the systolic blood pressure (BP) is below 100 mmHg. If no BP cuff is available, administer it if the pulse is palpable in sitting position and there are no signs of hypotension. Do not give if the pulse is below 60 beats per minute. Do not repeat if syncope (fainting) develops after the initial dose. One tablet, followed by an additional tablet at 10-minute intervals, is appropriate. When using the spray, the dose is 1 or 2 sprays under the tongue, repeating as per the above schedule. 2. 3.Give Plavix (clopidogrel), 300 mg, loading the dose immediately, then continue with 75 mg daily. Obese patients may require 600 mg loading dose for complete platelet inhibition. 3. 4.Administer metoprolol or atenolol (25 mg) every 6 hours, beginning 30 minutes after onset of chest pain, and repeat every 6 hours even if pain improves. Wait 30 minutes after onset of chest pain to identify patients with severe shock, bradycardia (slow heart rate), or acute pulmonary edema; in other words, do not give if the patient’s heart rate is below 60 beats per minute or systolic BP is below 100 mmHg, or if the patient complains of severe shortness of breath or is wheezing. 4. 5.You may give the victim medication adequate to relieve pain (see page 31 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_31]). From the Rx Oral Module, give Atarax (hydroxyzine), 25 mg orally, or from the Rx Injectable Module, give Vistaril (hydroxyzine), 25 mg IM, if needed, to treat nausea or to help sedate the victim. You may repeat the pain medication and the nausea/sedation medication every 4 hours as needed.Observe respirations and pulse rate. You will note the comment in the sectionunder Adult One-Rescuer CPR (page 17 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_17]) that providingCPR to a heart attack victim who cannot be defibrillated within 4 minutes is alost cause. The only significant reason for starting CPR, if the person becomespulseless, is to placate the onlookers. Due to the virtual zero salvage rate,you are treating yourself and the others watching who, after perhaps half anhour, will consider that everything possible has been done. This may be a veryimportant part of the emotional support required by individual group members asthey reflect upon the event.RAPID HEART RATE [nav.xhtml#sub15]TACHYCARDIA [nav.xhtml#sub38]A rapid heart rate after trauma or other stress may signify impending shock. Theunderlying cause should be treated. This may require fluid replacement or painmedication. Body temperature elevations cause an increase in heart rate of 10beats per minute for each degree above normal. At elevations above 8,000 feet(2,500 meters), a pulse rate of 120 or greater per minute after a 20-minute restis an early sign of pulmonary edema (see page 266 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_266]). Asudden onset of rapid heart rate with sharp chest pain can indicate a pulmonaryembolism or pneumothorax. Treat with pain medication and have the patient sitpropped up for ease in breathing.A very rapid rate of 140 to 220 beats per minute may be encountered suddenly andwithout warning in very healthy individuals. This PAT (paroxysmal atrialtachycardia) frequently has, as its first symptom, a feeling of profoundweakness. The victim generally stops what she is doing and feels better sittingdown. These attacks are self-limited, but they can be aborted by one of severalmaneuvers that stimulate the vagus nerve, which in turn slows down the pulserate. These maneuvers include holding one’s breath and bearing down very hard,closing one’s eyes and pressing firmly on one of the eyeballs, inducing vomitingwith a finger down the throat, or feeling for the carotid pulse in the neck andgently pressing on the enlarged portion of this artery, one side at a time.Another effective maneuver is to take a deep breath and plunge one’s face intoice water. Frequently, however, the victim must just wait for the attack topass. This arrhythmia will sometimes come on after a spate of activity. Nomedication is generally required.SLOW HEART RATE [nav.xhtml#sub39]BRADYCARDIA [nav.xhtml#sub40]A slow heart rate is important in two instances: when someone passes out or andwhen it accompanies a high fever. Generally, fainting or shock is associatedwith a rapid pulse rate (see compensatory shock, page 14[Chapter02.xhtml#page_14]), an attempt by the body to maintain blood pressure. Asafety mechanism, which the body employs to prevent blood pressure fromelevating too high, is a sensor system in each carotid artery in the neck,called the carotid bodies. If these sensors are stimulated by an elevated bloodpressure, a reflex mechanism that relaxes and opens blood vessels throughout thebody and lowers the heart rate is generated via impulses from the carotid bodiesthrough the vagus nerve, which can at times be fooled into inappropriatelyinitiating this reflex mechanism. A person watching an accident scene, or eventhinking about such an episode, can stimulate the vagus nerve through itsconnection with the frontal lobe. The resulting slow pulse and relaxed arteriescan result in the person passing out (fainting).As mentioned above, the pulse usually increases as the body temperature rises.It also falls as the core temperature lowers into a hypothermia state (see page247 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_247]). Several diseases are notable in that the pulserate is lower than would be expected for the elevated body temperature caused bythe disease. Typhoid fever (page 242 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_242]) is the classicexample of this phenomenon."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 [nav.xhtml#ch03]BODY SYSTEM SYMPTOMS AND MANAGEMENT [nav.xhtml#ch03]SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT [nav.xhtml#sub41]Symptoms are indicators of problems. Fever, pain, and itch can sometimes aid youin determining exactly what is wrong with the patient. The various decisiontables in this book use one or more symptoms to help identify a diagnosis andplan a treatment.It is also useful to know how to minimize some of these symptoms. Why itch whenyou can treat it? The cause of an itch may vary from poison plant dermatitis toan insect bite to liver disease. Regardless of the cause, what can you do toalleviate it?The best method for reducing symptoms is to successfully treat the underlyingproblem. Sometimes definitive treatment cannot be accomplished. At other times,the symptom remains after the injury is past, and the symptom becomes thegreatest part of the problem. Table 3-1 provides a guide to general symptomcare.Table 3-1.

Rectal temperatures are 0.5 to 1.5°F higher. Atympanic temperature (taken by an infrared sensor placed in the ear) will rangefrom equaling to being 0.5 to 1°F higher than an oral temperature. An axillary(armpit) reading ranges from 0.5 to 1°F lower than oral. Forehead or temporalreadings are, in my opinion, all over the map, depending on ambient temperature,sweating, technique, and expense/accuracy of the device, but they are generallyconsidered equal to oral. Certainly, they are useful when checking a largenumber of persons rapidly and provide a good estimate. A 1°F temperature riseabove normal in a human will result in the heart rate increasing 10 beats perminute over the patient’s normal resting heart rate. This is a useful fieldmethod of judging temperature, if everyone knows what his resting pulse is. Somediseases cause a peculiar drop in heart rate, even in the face of an obviouslyhigh temperature. The most notable of these are typhoid fever (see page 242[Chapter09.xhtml#page_242]) and yellow fever (see page 244[Chapter09.xhtml#page_244]).Although injury and exposure can cause elevated body temperature, fever isusually the result of infection. The cause of the fever should be sought andtreated. If pain or infection is located in the ear, throat, or elsewhere, referto the appropriate anatomical area listed in the Clinical Reference Index onpage 300.If other symptoms beside fever are present (diarrhea, cough, etc.), see thecross-references listing for these symptoms in the Clinical Reference Index toprovide treatment to alleviate the suffering due to these conditions. This maydiagnose the underlying disease, which will have a specific treatment indicatedin the text.The prepper approach to therapy may be quite different from that used inclinical medicine. When off the grid and in doubt about whether a fever is dueto viral, bacterial, or other infectious causes, treat for a bacterial infectionwith an antibiotic from your Rx Medication Modules. Initially give the patientLevaquin 500 mg, 1 tablet daily, and continue until the fever has broken for anadditional 3 days. This will conserve medication while providing adequateantibiotic coverage for a suspected bacterial infection.If it is possible that the patient has a strep throat, give Zithromax ratherthan Levaquin, as described on page 285 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_285]. If you arenot carrying the Rx kit, then treat the symptoms using the medications describedin your non-Rx Medication Modules. In either case, rest is important until thepatient is again free of fever and has a sense of well-being.Chills are a kind of shivering, accompanied by a feeling of coldness (notrelated to hypothermia; see page 247 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_247]). Chills, alsocalled rigors, usually occur when the body temperature is 102°F (38.9°C) or theperson has had a sudden rise in body temperature. Chills frequently indicate theonset of a bacterial infection, which should be treated with an antibiotic asdescribed above. In tropical countries, serious infections such as malaria mustbe considered (see page 229 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_229]). People tolerate feversquite well, and it is possible that elevated temperatures enhance the immuneresponse to infections. However, persons with a history of febrile seizures or ahistory of heart problems should certainly be treated to lower an elevatedtemperature. Generally, it is best to use Tylenol (acetaminophen), but usuallyibuprofen and aspirin are safe. Aspirin should be avoided in children withchicken pox or other viral illness due to an increase in Reye’s syndrome (adisease of progressive liver failure and brain deterioration) with its use. TheNon-Rx Oral Medication Module contains three products useful in treating fever:ibuprofen, aspirin, and Percogesic. As these are all over-the-counter products,the dosage will be listed on the product containers. The Rx Oral/TopicalMedication Module contains the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)meloxicam, and its use is described in that section (see page 284[Chapter11.xhtml#page_284]).LETHARGY [nav.xhtml#sub43]Lethargy, or prolonged tiredness or malaise, is a non-localizing symptom such asfever or muscle aches (myalgia). Pain, however, is a localizing symptom thatpoints to the organ system that may be the cause of such things as lethargy,fever, or a general ill feeling. Frequently after a few days of lethargy—or attimes even hours—localizing symptoms develop, and the cause of the lethargy canbe determined to be an infection of the throat, ear, or elsewhere.Sometimes a chronic condition is the source of the lethargy, such as anemia,leukemia, low thyroid function, occult or low-grade infection, mentaldepression, or even physical exhaustion. The latter we would expect to beobvious from the history of the preceding level of activity, and strength shouldreturn within a few days.Anemia can be present due to chronic blood loss from ulcers, menstrual problems,inadequate formation of iron, leukemia, or other cancers in the bone marrow, andso on. Chronic anemia can be identified by looking at the color of the skininside the lower eyelids. Pull the lower lid down, look at it, and compare toanother person. Normally this thin skin is very orange colored, even if thecheeks are pale. If the color is a blanched white, anemia is very likely.Another good indication of anemia is an increase in the pulse rate of more than30 beats per minute in the standing position when compared to a recumbentposition.Malaise or lethargy can be a presenting complaint of acute mountain sickness,but this would be unusual below 6,000 feet (1,800 meters). If other symptoms arepresent, such as nausea, one must think of hepatitis (see page 225[Chapter09.xhtml#page_225]) or, if preceded by a severe sore throat, infectiousmononucleosis (see page 60 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_60]).Lethargy is one of the most common presenting complaints that I see in myoffice. An accurate diagnosis requires careful evaluation, sometimes aided bylaboratory tests. If the problem is not depression, then regardless of thecause, the person needs rest, proper nutrition, and adequate shelter.PAIN [nav.xhtml#sub44]Adequate pain management can involve a mixture of proper medication andattitude—the attitudes of both the victim and the medic are crucial. A calm,professional approach to problems will lessen anxiety, panic, and pain. Pain isan important symptom that tells you something is wrong. It generally “localizes”or points to the exact cause of the trouble, so that pain in various parts ofthe body will be your clue that a problem exists, and that specific treatmentmay be required to eliminate it. Refer to the Clinical Reference Index (page300) under specific areas of the body (such as ear, abdomen, etc.) to read aboutdiagnoses and specific treatments of the causes of pain.An application of cold water or ice can frequently relieve pain. This is veryimportant in burns, orthopedic injuries, and skin irritations. Cold cansometimes relieve muscle spasm. Gentle massage and local hot compresses are alsoeffective treatments for muscle spasm.The alleviation of pain with medication calls for a step-wise increase inmedication strength until relief is obtained. Throughout this book you will bereferred to this section for adequate pain management. Use discretion inproviding adequate medication to do the job, without overdosing the patient.Remember that a pill takes about 20 minutes to begin working and is at maximumtherapeutic strength in about 1 hour. If possible, wait an hour to see howeffective the medication has been. But use common sense. If the injury issevere, give a respectable initial dose.MILD PAINFor mild pain, from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module, provide the victim withibuprofen, 200 mg, 1 or 2 tablets every 4 hours. Meloxicam in the prescriptionkit is particularly good for orthopedic injuries, or whenever muscle sprains andcontusions are encountered. It is also ideal for menstrual cramps and tensionheadache, and it is relatively safe to use in head injuries. It can also be usedfor the muscle aches and fever from viral and bacterial infections.Meloxicam, ibuprofen, and aspirin have anti-inflammatory actions that make themideal for treatment of tendinitis, bursitis, or arthritic pain.SEVERE PAINFor severe pain you may have to rely on providing the maximal dose of ibuprofen(800 mg every 6 hours) or meloxicam 15 mg once daily. This can be augmented bygiving the victim 1 or 2 Atarax 25 mg tablets every 4 to 6 hours. Thismedication helps eliminate any associated nausea, and from my experience alsopotentiates the pain medication so that it works more effectively.The Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module also contains nasally inhaled Stadol(butorphanol tartrate). This very powerful pain medication is about ten timesstronger per milligram than morphine. It is taken as a spray up one nostril,followed by another spray in the other nostril 5 to 20 minutes later, ifnecessary. This may be repeated every 3 to 4 hours. This medication is aspowerful as any injectable product available. (See a full discussion of thismedication on page 289 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_289].) Its rate of onset is rapid;within 5 minutes relief should start, reaching its maximum effect within 20minutes. As there are no needles required to administer this drug, it should beeasier to take on foreign trips than injectable medications. You might considerkeeping it with your toothpaste until across the border. At least I do.If you are carrying the Rx Injectable Medication Module, severe pain can betreated with an injection of 10 mg of Nubain (nalbuphine). This amounts to 0.5ml of the strength listed in the kit. This can be potentiated with Vistaril(hydroxyzine), 25 mg or 50 mg, also by injection. These two drugs can be mixedin the same syringe. They both sting upon injection.Local pain can be eliminated or eased with cold compresses or ice, as mentionedabove. Applying dibucaine 1% ointment will help skin surface pain, such as fromsunburn and abrasions. Applying a cover of Spenco 2nd Skin dressing providescooling relief due to the evaporative action of the water from this safe-to-usegel pad. Deep cuts and painful puncture wounds can be injected with lidocaine 1%from the Rx Injectable Medication Module. This technique is described on page292 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_292].ITCH [nav.xhtml#sub45]As itch is a sensation that is transmitted by pain fibers, all pain medicationscan be used in alleviating itch sensations. Itch also indicates that somethingis awry and may require specific treatment. The most common causes are localallergic reactions, such as poisonous plants, fungal infections, and insectbites or infestations (or look under specific causes in the index). Generalprinciples of treatment include further avoidance of the offending substance(not so easy in the case of mosquitoes). Avoid applying heat to an itchy area,as this makes it flare up worse. Avoid scratching or rubbing; this alsoincreases the reaction. If weeping blisters have formed, apply wet soaks with aclean cloth or gauze. While plain water soaks will help, making a solution withregular table salt will help dry the lesions and alleviate some of the itch.Make a solution approximately 10% weight to volume of water. Cream-basedpreparations work well on moist lesions, while ointments are more effective ondry, scaly ones. The Topical Bandaging Module contains 1% hydrocortisone cream,which, while safe to use, is generally not very effective against severeallergic dermatitis. For best results, one should apply it 4 times daily andthen cover the area with an occlusive dressing, such as cellophane or a piece ofplastic bag. The Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module contains Topicort(desoximetasone) 0.25% ointment, which is strong enough to adequately treatallergic dermatitis with light coats applied twice daily. Athlete’s foot andskin rashes in the groin or in skin folds are generally fungal and should not betreated with these creams. They may seem to provide temporary relief, but theycan worsen fungal infections. For possible fungal infections, apply clotrimazolecream 1% twice daily from the Topical Bandaging Module.Oral medications are frequently required to treat severe skin reactions anditch. The Non-Rx Oral Medication Module contains Benadryl (diphenhydramine), 25mg. Take 1 or 2 capsules every 6 hours. It is one of the most effectiveantihistamines made, but there are less sedating ones now sold withoutprescription, such as Claritin, Zyrtec, and Allegra. The Rx Oral TopicalMedication Module contains Atarax (hydroxyzine), 25 mg. It is very effectiveboth in treating the symptom of itch and as an antihistamine. Take 1 or 2tablets every 6 hours. These medications are safe to use on all sorts of itchproblems. If one is suffering from an asthma attack, however, they should not beused, as they tend to dry out the lung secretions and potentially make theillness worse. Patients with a history of asthma should use the newerantihistamines mentioned above.HIVESHives are the result of a severe allergic reaction. Commonly called welts, theseraised red blotches develop rapidly and frequently have a red border around aclearer skin area in the center, sometimes referred to as an annular lesion. Asthese can and do appear over large surfaces of the skin, treatment with a creamis of little help. Use the diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine as indicated above.Extensive urticaria or allergic dermatitis lesions frequently need to be treatedwith an oral steroid. The Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module has Decadron(dexamethasone) 4 mg tablets; 1 tablet should be taken twice daily after meals.It should be noted that the Vistaril recommended for the Rx Injectable Module isalso hydroxyzine, as is the oral Atarax. This same module also has an injectableform of the dexamethasone. For treatment of rash, the oral medications shouldsuffice.In case of a concurrent asthmatic condition or the development of shock, treatas for anaphylactic shock (see page 193 [Chapter08.xhtml#page_193]). In case ofsuspected tick bite, an annular or circular lesion may be a sign of Lyme disease(page 228 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_228]). If fever is present, one must considerthat a rash and itch have resulted from an infection. A diagnosis may beimpossible in the bush, so treatment with an antibiotic is appropriate onexpeditions expected to last longer than several more days. Use doxycycline, 100mg twice daily, from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module as a field-expedientsolution to the problem. Treat fever as described on page 29[Chapter03.xhtml#page_29].HICCUPS [nav.xhtml#sub46]Hiccups can start from a variety of causes and are generally self-limited.Persistent hiccups can be a medically important symptom requiring professionalevaluation and help to control. Several approaches to their control whenoff-grid may be tried. Have the victim hold his breath for as long as possibleor rebreathe air from a paper sack. These maneuvers raise the carbon dioxidelevel and help stop the hiccup reflex mechanism. Drinking 5 to 6 ounces of icewater fast sometimes works; one may also close one’s eyes and press firmly onthe eyeballs to stimulate the vagal blockage of the hiccup. The other vagusnerve stimulation maneuvers described under Rapid Heart Rate (page 25[Chapter02.xhtml#page_25]) can be tried.If these maneuvers do not work, from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module, you maygive diphenhydramine, 25 mg, or from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module youmay give Atarax, 25 mg, 2 tablets. The Rx Injectable Medication Module includesVistaril, the injectable form of Atarax. This medication may be given in a doseof 50 mg IM. These doses may be repeated every 4 hours. Let the patient rest andtry to avoid bothering him until bedtime. If still symptomatic at that point,have him rebreathe the air from inside a sleeping bag to raise the carbondioxide level in his bloodstream and, if nothing else, to muffle the sounds.HEADACHE [nav.xhtml#sub47]A variety of situations can cause a headache; refer to table 3-3. Too much sunexposure, dehydration, withdrawal from caffeine, stress, high altitude illness,dental or eye problems—the list is almost endless. Be sure to consider thepossible underlying problems mentioned above as they are the most common.Table 3-3. Causes of Headache Dental 109 TMJ (temporomandibular joint) 59 Highaltitude 265 Heat 255 Sun exposure 260EYE [nav.xhtml#sub48]Pain and irritation of the eye can be devastating. Many causes are listed intable 3-4.Table 3-4.

Wash the eye with clean water by dabbing with wet,clean cloth every 2 hours to remove pus and excess secretions. Apply antibioticsas indicated under Conjunctivitis, page 45 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_45].Eye patch techniques must allow for gentle closure of the eyelid and retardblinking activity. Sometimes both eyes must be patched for this to succeed, butthis obviously is a hardship for the patient. Simple strips of tape holding theeyelids shut may suffice. In case of trauma, an annular ring of cloth may beconstructed to pad the eye without pressure over the eyeball. A simple eye patchwith oversize gauze or cloth may work fine, as the bone of the orbital rimaround the eye acts to protect the eyeball, which is recessed.Serious injury requires patching both eyes, as movement in the injured eye willdecrease if movement in the unaffected eye is also controlled. It generallyhelps to have the victim kept at rest with her head elevated 30 degrees. Asevere blow to one eye may cause temporary blindness in both eyes, which canresolve in hours to days. Obviously, a person with loss of vision should betreated by a physician if possible. Eye dressings must be removed, or at leastchanged, in 24 hours.If a foreign object has been removed from the eye or the victim has suffered acorneal abrasion, the best splint is the tension patch. Start by placing 2 gauzepads over the shut eye, requesting the patient keep his eyes closed until thebandaging is completed. The patient may help hold the gauze in place. Threepieces of 1-inch-wide tape are ideal, long enough to extend from the center ofthe forehead to just below the cheekbone. Fasten the first piece of tape to thecenter of the forehead, extending the tape diagonally downward across the eyepatch. The second and third strips are applied parallel to the first strip, oneabove and the other below. This dressing will result in firm splinting of thebandaged eye.FOREIGN BODY EYE INJURY [nav.xhtml#sub50]The most common eye problems outdoors are from a foreign body, abrasion, snowblindness, and infection (conjunctivitis). Therapy for these problems isvirtually the same, except that it is very important to remove any foreign bodythat may be present.The initial step in examining the painful eye is to remove the foreign object.One of the lessons drilled into medical students is to never ever write aprescription for eye anesthesia agents (such as the tetracaine ophthalmicsolution that I recommend for the Rx Oral/ Topical Medication Module). Thereason is the patient may use it, obtain relief, and then not have the eyecarefully examined for a foreign body. Eventually this foreign body may cause anulcer to form in the cornea, doing profound damage.When using the tetracaine, remember that it is very important to find and removeany foreign body. Pull down on the lower lid and use 1 drop. If the patient isunable to open her eye due to pain, place 1 or 2 drops in the inner corner ofthe eye while she is lying face up. Have her blink once or twice to allow theliquid to cover the eyeball. This medication burns when initially placed in theeye. This will increase the level of pain for a brief period until themedication takes effect. After the patient has calmed down, have her open theeye and look straight ahead. Very carefully shine a pen light at the cornea fromone side to see if a minute speck becomes visible. By moving the light back andforth, one might see movement of a shadow on the iris of the eye and thusconfirm the presence of a foreign body. Mucus can give a gooey appearance to thecornea that may mimic a foreign body. Have the victim blink to move any mucusaround. A point that consistently stays put with blinking is probably a foreignbody.In making the foreign body examination, also be sure to check under the eyelids.Evert the upper lid over a Q-tip stick, thus examining not only the eyeball butalso the undersurface of the eyelid. This surface may be gently brushed with thecotton applicator to eliminate any minute particles. Always use a fresh Q-tipwhen touching the eye or eyelid each additional time. Some foreign bodies can beremoved easily. Have the patient place his face under water and blink. Waterturbulence from underwater blinking or from directing running water in afast-moving stream or poured from a cup may wash the problem away.When a foreign body has been found embedded in the cornea, take a sterile, or atleast a clean, Q-tip and approach the foreign body from the side. Gently prod itwith the Q-tip handle until it is loosened. The surface of the eye will indentunder the pressure of this scraping action. Indeed, the surface of the corneawill be scratched in the maneuver, but it will quickly heal. Once the foreignbody has been dislodged, if it does not stick to the wooden or plastic handlebut slides loose along the corneal surface, use the cotton portion to touch itfor removal.A stoic individual, particularly one accustomed to contact lenses, might be ableto undergo an uncomplicated foreign body removal without the use of tetracaine0.5% ophthalmic drops, but using an anesthetic makes the patient morecomfortable and cuts down on interference from the blink reflex.Foreign bodies stuck in the cornea can be very stubborn and resist removal. Attimes it is necessary to pick them loose with the sharp point of a #11 scalpelblade or the tip of a needle (I frequently use an 18-gauge needle). Anesthesiawith tetracaine will be necessary for this procedure. Scraping with theseinstruments will cause a more significant scratch to the corneal surface, butunder these circumstances it may have to be accepted. I would leave stubbornforeign bodies for removal by a physician in all but the most desperatecircumstances. If you have a difficult time removing an obvious foreign bodyfrom the surface of the cornea, waiting 2 to 3 days may allow the cornea toulcerate slightly so that removal with the Q-tip stick may be much easier.Deeply lodged foreign bodies will have to be left for surgical removal.A painless foreign body may not be a foreign body. It could be a rust ring leftbehind after a bit of ferrous, or iron-containing, material has fallen out ofthe eye after having been lodged for a short time. If what you see is painless,ignore it in the off-grid setting.The history that involves striking an object should alert you to the fact thatthe injury may have penetrated much more deeply than you would expect fromblowing debris hitting the eye. While blowing debris can lodge in the eyesurface, a foreign body slamming into the eye due to someone striking an object(say, a hammer against a rock) might have penetrated very deeply into theeyeball. Penetrating injuries are a disaster!A puncture wound of the eyelid mandates careful examination of the corneasurface for evidence of a penetrating foreign body. These injuries must be seenby a physician for surgical care. Evacuation is necessary. If this isimpossible, the eye must be patched, examined for infection twice daily, andtreated with antibiotics both orally and topically.After removal of a foreign body, or even after scraping the eye while attemptingto remove one, apply some antibiotic. The prescription kit should containTobradex ophthalmic drops. There are no non-prescription eye antibiotics.Brand-name Neosporin and Polysporin ointments in 15-gram tubes arenonprescription antibiotics that can be used in the eye. However, themanufacturer cannot recommend the use of these over-the-counter products forthis purpose.While the tetracaine will provide local pain relief, its continued use mayhinder the natural healing process and disguise a significant injury or thepresence of an additional foreign body. Pain relief is best attempted byprotecting the eye from sunlight using sunglasses, providing a damp cloth forevaporative cooling, and oral pain medication. There is no evidence thatpatching an eye with a corneal abrasion is useful. Percogesic or ibuprofen, 200mg, from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module, both given in a dose of 2 tabletsevery 4 to 6 hours, may be provided for pain. The prescription analgesic Norco10/325, 1 tablet every 4 to 6 hours, would provide significant pain relief.CONTACT LENSES [nav.xhtml#sub51]The increased popularity of contact lenses means that several problemsassociated with their use have also increased. The lenses are of two basictypes: the hard or rigid lens, which generally is smaller and does not extendbeyond the iris, and the soft lens, which does extend beyond the iris onto thewhite of the eye. Soft lenses have been designed for extended wear. Hard lensuse requires frequent removal, as the delicate cornea of the eye obtains oxygenfrom the environment and nutrients from eye secretions. These lenses interferewith this process and therefore are detrimental to the cornea.Examine the eyes of all unconscious persons for the existence of hard lenses andremove them if found. It is probably best to remove soft lenses as well, as someare not designed for extended use and may also damage the eye. If you expectthat you may go off the grid for an extended time, you may want to rethink usingcontact lenses altogether. Also obtain the proper eyeglass prescription and keepa pair in your bug-out bag!Leaving most hard contact lenses in the eyes longer than 12 hours can result incorneal ulceration. While not serious, this can be a very painful experience. Attimes, even iritis (see page 47 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_47]) may result. Thiscondition almost always resolves on its own within a day. The history is themajor clue that the diagnosis is correct. If the condition fails to clear within24 hours, other problems should be looked into, such as corneal laceration,foreign body, or eye infection.After removal of the contact lenses, place cool cloths or ice packs on the eyes.The patient should be evaluated by a physician to confirm the diagnosis. Provideprotection from sunlight, using sunglasses during the day. Give aspirin or otherpain medication if available. The patient may have pain from the migration ofthe lens into one of the recesses of the under to upper or lower eyelid, orpossibly note only a loss of refractive correction. At times the complaint is asudden “I have lost my contact lens!” Never forget to look in the eye as thepossible hiding spot for the lens. Examine the eye as described in the sectionon foreign bodies in the eye (see page 38 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_38]). Whendealing with a hard lens, use topical anesthesia as described, if necessary andavailable. If the lens is loose, slide it over the pupil and allow the patientto remove it as she usually does. If the lens is adherent, rinse with eyeirrigation solution or clean water and try again. If a corneal abrasion exists,patch as indicated above after the lens is removed.The soft lens may generally be squeezed between the fingers and literally“popped” off. A special rubber pincer is sold that can aid in this maneuver.Hard lenses may also be removed with a special rubber suction cup device.If the patient is unconscious, the hard lenses will have to be removed. Lackingthe suction cup device, two different maneuvers may be employed. One is thevertical technique. In this method, move the lens to the center of the eye overthe pupil. Then press down on the lower lid, over the lower edge of the contactlens. Next squeeze the eyelids together, thus popping the lens out between themas indicated in figure 3-1. In the horizontal technique, slide the lens to theoutside corner of the eye. Tug on the facial skin near the eye in a downward andoutward direction; the lens can pop over the skin edge and be easily removed.See figure 3-2.The unconscious patient should have antibiotic salve placed in her eye and thelids taped or patched shut to prevent drying. These patches should be removedwhen needed for neurological checks and certainly upon regaining consciousness.If removal of the lenses must be prolonged, safe storage will have to beprovided. Regarding hard lenses, the ideal would be marked containers that padthe lenses so that they do not rattle around or otherwise become scratched.Small vials, labeled R and L, filled with a fluff of clean material, tapedtogether, and placed in a safe location, would be ideal. Soft contact lensesmust be protected from dehydration. It is always proper to store them in normalsaline. This solution can be prepared by adding 11/2 ounces of table salt to 1pint of water. Of course, if the patient has a special solution for her lensesin her possession, use it.chpt_fig_006 [../Images/chpt_fig_006.jpg]Figure 3-1.Contact lens removal—vertical techniquechpt_fig_007 [../Images/chpt_fig_007.jpg]Figure 3-2.Contact lens removal—horizontal techniqueEYE ABRASION [nav.xhtml#sub52]Abrasions may be caused by a glancing blow from a wood chip, a swinging branch,or even from blowing dirt, embers, ice, or snow. The involved eye should beanesthetized with prescription tetracaine and protected with Tobradex ophthalmicdrops. Make sure that a foreign body has not been overlooked.In cold wind be sure to protect your eyes from the effects of both blowingparticles of ice and the wind itself. Grey Owl, in his interesting book Tales ofan Empty Cabin, tells how he was walking along a windswept frozen lake on one ofhis long trips through the backwoods when suddenly he lost sight of the treeline. He felt that he must be in a whiteout, so he turned perpendicular to thewind and hiked toward the shore. Suddenly he bumped into a tree and realizedthat he was blind! He saved himself only by digging a snow cave and staying putfor three days. He wondered how many good woodsmen were lost on their trap linesby a similar incident, apparently, a temporary opacification of the cornea fromthe cold wind or ice crystal abrasions.SNOW BLINDNESS OR ULTRAVIOLET EYE INJURY [nav.xhtml#sub53]Snow blindness is a severely painful condition primarily caused by ultraviolet Brays of the sun, which are considerably reflected by snow (85%), water(10–100%), and sand (17%). Thin cloud layers allow the transmission of theserays, while filtering out infrared (heat) rays of the sun. Thus, it is possibleon a rather cool, overcast day with bright snow conditions to become sunburnedor snow blind.Properly approved American National Standards Institute (ANSI) sunglasses willblock 99.8% of the ultraviolet B rays. Suitable glasses should be tagged asmeeting these standards. Nonprescription glasses must fit properly and ideallyprovide side protection. A suitable retention strap must be worn, as I finallylearned while rafting on the Green River in Colorado. And for those of us whomust learn these things more than once, a second pair of glasses—particularly ifprescription lenses are worn—is essential. Lacking sunglasses, anyfield-expedient method of eliminating glare, such as slit glasses made from woodor any material at hand, including the ubiquitous bandanna, will help. Animportant characteristic of snow blindness is the delayed onset of symptoms. Thepain and loss of vision may not be evident until after damaging exposure hasbeen sustained.Besides snow blindness, either direct or reflected ultraviolet exposure canresult in headache or sometimes activate herpes simplex sores on the lips (seepage 62 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_62]). The headache can be treated with painmedication (see page 31 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_31]), or look for other underlyingcauses (see page 165 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_165]).Snow blindness is a self-limiting affliction. However, not only is the loss ofvision a problem, but so is the terrible pain, usually described as feeling likered hot pokers were massaging the eye sockets. Lacking any first aid supplies,the treatment would be gentle eye patches, avoiding pressure on the eyes, andthe application of cold packs as needed for pain relief. Generally, both eyesare equally affected, with a virtual total loss of vision.The prescription tetracaine ophthalmic drops will help ease the pain, butlong-term use will delay eye surface healing. Oral pain medication will behelpful and should be used. The severe pain can last from hours to several days.In case a drainage of pus or crusting of the eyelids occurs, start antibioticophthalmic ointment applications as indicated in the following section onconjunctivitis.CONJUNCTIVITIS [nav.xhtml#sub54]Conjunctivitis, an infection or inflammation of the eye surface, will beheralded by a scratchy feeling, almost indistinguishable from a foreign body inthe eye. The sclera (white of the eye) will be reddened.Usually the eye will be matted shut in the morning with pus or granular matter.Infections are generally caused by bacteria, but viral infections also occur.Viral infections tend to have a blotchy red appearance over the white of theeye, while bacterial infections have a generalized red appearance. The drainagein bacterial infections tends to be pus, while viral infections usually cause awatery discharge.Allergic conjunctivitis will result in a faint pink coloration and a cleardrainage. There are frequently other symptoms of allergy such as runny nose, nofever, and no lymph node enlargement. With either viral or bacterialconjunctivitis, look for fever and possibly lymph node enlargement in the neck.Runny nose and sinus infection are frequently present as well. Be sure that aforeign body is not the cause of the reddish eye and infection. If so, it mustbe removed (see page 38 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_38]).Rinse the eye with clean water frequently during the day. Eye infections such ascommon bacterial conjunctivitis, the most common infection, are self-limitingand will generally clear themselves within 2 weeks. They can become much worse,however, so medical attention should be sought. Do not patch the eyes butprotect them from sunlight. When one eye is infected, treat both eyes, as theinfection spreads easily to the uninfected eye.There is no suitable nonprescription medication, but note the discussionconcerning the use of non-Rx Neosporin or Polysporin in the section on foreignbody eye injury (page 38 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_38]). From the Rx supplies, onecould use the Tobradex ophthalmic drops 3 times a day for 5 to 7 days. If theinfection fails to show improvement within 48 hours, the antibiotic willprobably not be effective. Reasons for antibiotic failure include a missedforeign body; allergy to the antibiotic or to something else, such as pollen; orresistance of an infectious germ to the antibiotic being used. Switchmedications in the case of no improvement after 48 hours. When no otherantibiotic ointment is available, use an oral antibiotic such as doxycycline 100mg, 1 capsule twice daily, or the alternative antibiotics suggested for the RxOral/Topical Medication Module (page 284 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_284]). If the eyeis improving, continue use as indicated above, continuing for a full 24 hoursafter symptoms have ceased.IRITIS [nav.xhtml#sub55]Iritis is an inflammatory disease of the eye having the general appearance ofconjunctivitis, but while in the latter the reddish color fades to white nearthe iris of the eye (the colored part), with iritis the rim of sclera (white ofthe eye) around the iris is more inflamed or reddened than the white portionfarther out. The pupil will not constrict when light is shined at it.Provide sun protection. Give aspirin or other pain medication if available. Thispatient requires urgent evacuation to a specialist. The non-Rx treatment willconsist of giving the patient ibuprofen, 800 mg every 6 hours, or meloxicam, 15mg daily. Instill Tobradex ophthalmic drops 4 times a day.As iritis progresses, the red blush near the iris will become more pronouncedand a spasm of the muscle used in the operation of the iris will cause the pupilto become irregular. With further progression, it is possible for the pupil(anterior chamber) to become cloudy, for cataracts and glaucoma to develop, andfor serious scarring of eye tissues to occur. Sometimes a profoundconjunctivitis or corneal abrasion will cause an iritis that will clear as theproblem resolves. Some cases of mild iritis can be cleared with agents thatdilate the pupil without steroid use. All cases of iritis require treatment byan ophthalmologist.ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS [nav.xhtml#sub56]Common causes of allergic conjunctivitis are sensitivity to inhaled pollens andirritation from wood smoke. This problem is usually associated with a runny nose(rhinitis) and at times swelling of the eyelids. Rarely there will be ageneralized skin itching and the appearance of welts (urticaria). In severecases there can be considerable swelling of the conjunctival covering of thewhite of the eye (sclera), forming what appears as fluid-filled sacs over thesclera of the eye (but not covering the cornea). This puffy tissue generally hasa light pink tinge to it. While this can look terrible, it is not serious andwill resolve on its own within 48 hours, after further exposure to the causativeagent ceases.From the non-Rx supplies give Percogesic, 1 tablet 4 times a day, and use theOpcon-A eye drops, 1 drop in each eye every 3 or 4 hours as needed. Percogesicis used for its decongestant actions, and it will also treat the itchydiscomfort of this condition.STIES AND CHALAZIA [nav.xhtml#sub57]The infections of the eyelid called sties and chalazia can cause scratching ofthe cornea surface. Often the victim thinks that something is in the eye when,in fact, one of these small pimples is forming. The sty is an infection along ahair follicle on the eyelid margin. The chalazion is an infection of an oilgland on the inner lid margin. The patient will have redness, pain, and swellingalong the edge of the upper or lower eyelid. At times the eye will be red withevidence of infection, or conjunctivitis. An eyelid may be swollen, without thepimple formation, when this problem first develops. There should not beextensive swelling around the eye. That could represent a periorbitalcellulitis, which is a serious infection requiring treatment with injectableantibiotics and urgent evacuation.Make sure that a foreign body is not causing the symptoms. Check the eye andeyelids as indicated (see page 38 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_38]). While checking,ascertain if a pimple formation confirms the diagnosis. If it is on the upperlid and it is scratching the eye while blinking, patch the eye and send thepatient to a physician for treatment. If no medical care is available, have thepatient place warm compresses on the eye for 20 minutes every 2 hours to causethe sty to come to a head. When it does, it may spontaneously break and drain.If it does not drain within 2 days, open it with a flick of a sharp blade orneedle that has been sterilized. Continue the warm compresses and providemedication as below.If Rx supplies are available, instill Tobradex ophthalmic drops 3 times a day.(Also note discussion concerning the use of over-the-counter antibiotic ointmentin the eye on page 41 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_41].) If the lid is quite swollen,give the patient doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, or Levaquin, 500 mg oncedaily. Once the infection is localized and draining, the oral antibiotic willnot be necessary.SPONTANEOUS SUBCONJUNCTIVAL HEMORRHAGE [nav.xhtml#sub58]This condition, an amazingly common problem, presents as bright bleeding over aportion of the white of the eye. (Actually, a hemorrhage has occurred betweenthe white of the eye and the mucous membrane covering it.) It spreads out over aperiod of 12 to 48 hours, then reabsorbs slowly over the next 7 to 21 days, nextturning the conjunctiva yellowish as the blood is reabsorbed. There should notbe any pain with this condition, although some people may report a vague “full”feeling in the eye. It normally occurs without cause, but can appear after blunttrauma or violent coughing, sneezing, or vomiting. No treatment is necessary.Evacuation is not required unless associated with trauma.BLUNT TRAUMA TO THE EYE [nav.xhtml#sub59]The immediate treatment is to immobilize the injured eye as soon as possible bypatching both eyes and moving the patient only by litter. Double vision couldmean that there has been a fracture of the skull near the eye or that a problemhas developed within the central nervous system. Double vision is sometimescaused by swelling of tissue behind the eyelid. A hyphema, a collection of bloodin the front or anterior chamber of the eye, may appear. The blood settles infront of the pupil and behind the cornea, and can develop a distinct blood fluidlevel easily noticed simply by looking carefully at the pupil and iris.Patch as indicated in the section on eye patch and bandaging techniques (page 37[Chapter03.xhtml#page_37]). Patients with a hyphema and serious blunt traumashould be evacuated to a physician for care. Have the patient sit with head upfrom 45 to 90 degrees, to allow blood to pool at the lower edge of the anteriorchamber. Check the eye twice daily for drainage, which might indicate infection.If infection develops, treat with an oral antibiotic such as the doxycycline 100mg twice daily. The Tobradex ophthalmic drops may be instilled 3 times daily.Treat with oral pain medication. Give Atarax, 25 mg, 4 times daily as needed topotentiate the pain medication and help alleviate nausea, or 50 mg 4 times dailyif required to calm the patient.Provide the strongest pain medication required to prevent the injured patientfrom grimacing and squeezing the injured eye so as not to compromise the eyecontents even more. Small corneal or scleral lacerations may require notreatment at all, but these should be seen and evaluated by a physician if atall possible. Note that severe injury to one eye may even cause blindness todevelop in the other eye due to “sympathetic ophthalmia,” which is probably anallergic response to eye pigment from the injured eye entering the victim’sbloodstream.GLAUCOMA [nav.xhtml#sub60]Glaucoma is the rise of pressure within the eyeball (intraocular pressureincrease). The most common form (open angle glaucoma) generally is notencountered before the age of 40. The patient notes halos around lights, mildheadaches, loss of vision to the sides (peripheral field cuts), and loss ofability to see well at night. The external eye usually appears normal. Glaucomafrequently affects both eyes. This condition is generally of gradual onset, sothe patient can consult a physician upon returning from the bush.Initial treatment is with a prescription drug, 1 drop of 0.5% pilocarpine. Itwould not be necessary to carry this medication, except to treat this condition.This problem should be detected by the pre-trip physical examination. Everyoneover the age of 40 should check their intraocular pressure periodically as partof their on-the-grid periodic health assessment.Acute glaucoma (narrow angle glaucoma) is much less common than open angleglaucoma but is much more spectacular in onset. Acute glaucoma is characterizedby a rapid rise in pressure of the fluid within the eyeball, causing blurredvision, severe pain in the eye, and even abdominal distress from vagal nervestimulation. An acute attack can sometimes be broken with pilocarpine, but itoften needs emergency surgery. A thorough eye examination should be done beforethe trip to discover those eyes with narrow angles that could result in acuteglaucoma. In eyes likely to develop acute glaucoma, a laser iridectomy can bedone as an outpatient to prevent an acute narrow angle glaucoma attack.Events that might precipitate an acute glaucoma attack can include the use ofcertain medications, such as decongestants. If anyone develops severe eye painwhile taking a decongestant or other nonessential medication, have them stoptaking it immediately. Severe eye pain from any cause is a reason for urgentevacuation of the patient.NOSE [nav.xhtml#sub61]NASAL CONGESTION [nav.xhtml#sub62]Nasal congestion is caused by an allergic reaction to pollen, dust, or otherallergens, and viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections. Bacterialinfections can be cured with antibiotics, but otherwise all are treatedsimilarly for symptomatic relief. Use Percogesic, 1 tablet every 6 hours asneeded, for nasal congestion or discomfort. Drink lots of liquid to prevent themucus from becoming too thick. Thick mucus will not drain well and can pack thesinus cavities with increasingly painful pressure.If the patient has no fever, do not give an antibiotic. A low-grade temperatureis probably viral and still does not warrant an antibiotic. If a temperaturegreater than 101°F (38°C) is present, treat with an antibiotic such asdoxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, or Zithromax, as indicated on page 285[Chapter11.xhtml#page_285].FOREIGN BODY NOSE INJURY [nav.xhtml#sub63]Foul drainage from one nostril may well indicate a foreign body. In adults, thehistory of something being placed up the nose would, of course, help in thediagnosis. In a child, drainage from one nostril must be considered to be theresult of a foreign body until ruled out.Have the patient try to blow his nose to remove the foreign body. With an infantit may be possible for a parent to gently puff into the baby’s mouth to forcethe object out of the nose.While having a nasal speculum would be ideal, any instrument that can be used tospread the nostrils open will work; for example, the pliers on your Swiss Armyknife or Leatherman tool. Spread the tips apart after placing them just insidethe nostril. The nostril can stretch quite extensively without causing pain.Shine a light into the nostril passage and attempt to spot the foreign body. Tryto grasp the object with forceps or another instrument. If the foreign materialis loose debris—such as a capsule that broke in the patient’s mouth and wassneezed into the nostrils—it is best to irrigate this material out rather thanattempting to cleanse with a Q-tip or other tool. Place a bulb or irrigationsyringe in the clear nostril. With the patient repeating an “eng” sound, flushwater and, hopefully, the debris out the opposite nostril.After removing a foreign body, be sure to check the nostril again for anadditional one. Try not to push a foreign body down the back of the patient’sthroat, where he may choke on it. If this is unavoidable, have the patient bendover, face down, to decrease the chance of choking. After pushing the objectfarther into the nose and the upper part of the pharynx, hopefully the victimcan cough the object out. If you are using this technique, first read thesections on nosebleed (see below) and foreign body airway obstruction (page 16[Chapter02.xhtml#page_16]).NOSEBLEED [nav.xhtml#sub64]If nose bleeding (epistaxis) is caused by a contusion to the nose, the bleedingcan be impressive but is usually self-limited. Bleeding that starts withouttrauma is generally more difficult to stop. Most bleeding is from small arterieslocated near the front of the nose partition, or nasal septum. The besttreatment is direct pressure. Have the victim squeeze the nose between herfingers for 10 minutes by the clock (a very long time when there is no clock towatch). If this fails, squeeze another 10 minutes. Do not blow the nose, forthis will dislodge clots and start the bleeding all over again. If the bleedingis severe, have the victim sit up to prevent choking on blood and to aid in thereduction of the blood pressure in the nose. Cold compresses can provide aslight amount of help.Continued bleeding can result in shock. This will, in turn, decrease thebleeding. The sitting position is mandatory to prevent choking on blood from asevere bleed and, as indicated above, will aid in the reduction of bloodpressure in the nose. Taken to the extreme degree, this position aids inallowing shock to occur.Another technique that can be tried is to wet a gauze strip thoroughly with theepinephrine from the syringe in the Rx Injectable Medication Module. Theepinephrine can act as a vasoconstrictor to decrease the blood flow and allowclotting.Those having only nonprescription medical supplies will have to use the Opcon-Aeye drops, which will not be as powerful in blood-vessel constriction. Firstclear the nose of blood clots so the gauze can be in direct contact with thenasal membranes. Have the victim blow his nose gently or use the irrigationsyringe. Place the epinephrine-soaked gauze in the nose and apply pinchingpressure for 10-minute increments. The gauze may be removed after the bleedinghas stopped.NOSE FRACTURE [nav.xhtml#sub65]A direct blow causing a nasal fracture (broken nose) is associated with pain,swelling, and nasal bleeding. The pain is usually point tender, which means avery light touch elicits pain, indicating a fracture has occurred at thatlocation. While the bleeding from trauma to the nose can initially be intense,it seldom lasts more than a few minutes. Apply a cold compress or a damp cloththat can cool by evaporative cooling. Allow the patient to pinch his nose tohelp reduce bleeding.If the nose is laterally displaced (shoved to one side), push it back intoplace. More of these fractures have been treated by coaches on the playing fieldthan by doctors. If it is a depressed fracture, a specialist will have toproperly elevate the fragments. As soon as the person returns from the bush,have him seen by a physician, but this is not a reason for expensive urgentevacuation. Provide pain medication, which should be necessary for only a fewdoses. It is rare to need to pack a bleeding nose due to trauma, and this shouldbe avoided, if possible, due to the increased pain it would cause.EAR [nav.xhtml#sub66]Problems with the ear involve pain, loss of hearing, or drainage. Traumasinvolving the ear could include lacerations, blunt trauma and hemorrhage(bleeding) in the outer ear tissue, and damage from pressure changes to theeardrum (barotrauma) from diving or high altitude, explosions, or direct blowsto the ear. See table 3-5 for signs and symptoms.Table 3-5. Symptoms and Signs of Ear Pathology HEARING LOSS PAIN HEAD CONGESTIONFEVER Trauma (49) ■ ■ Foreign Body (38) ● Infection Inner Ear ■ ■ ■ ■ Outer Ear● ● ■ ● Allergy ● ● ■ Dental Source ■ TMJ Source ● ● Lymph Node Source ●Legend■A frequent or intense symptom●Common, less intense symptomBlankLess likely to produce this symptomOnly if the eardrum ruptures will drainage occur in an inner ear infection.After the rupture the pain decreases remarkably.EARACHE [nav.xhtml#sub67]Pain in the ear can be associated with a number of sources, as indicated intable 3-5. The history of trauma will be an obvious source of pain, asmentioned. Most ear pain is due to an otitis media infection behind the eardrum(tympanic membrane), or to otitis externa infection in the outer ear canal(auditory canal). It can also be caused by infection elsewhere (generally adental infection, infected tonsil, or lymph node in the neck near the ear).Allergy can result in pressure behind the eardrum and is also a common source ofear pain.A simple physical examination and additional medical history will readily (andgenerally accurately) distinguish the difference between an otitis media orotitis externa infection, as well as sources of pain beyond the ear. Pushing onthe knob at the front of the ear (the tragus) or pulling on the earlobe willelicit pain with otitis externa. This will not hurt if the patient has otitismedia. The history of head congestion favors otitis media.A swollen, tender nodule in the neck near the ear would be an infected lymphnode. If the skin above the swelling is red, the patient probably has aninfected skin abscess. The pain from an abscess is so localized that confusionwith an ear infection is seldom a problem. One or more tender lymph nodes canhurt to the extent that the exact source of the pain may be in doubt. Swollen,tender lymph nodes in the neck are usually associated with pharyngitis (sorethroat), severe otitis externa, or infections of the skin in the scalp. Thelatter should be readily noted by examination—palpate the scalp for infectedcysts or abscesses.Dental caries, or cavities, can hurt to the extent that the pain seems to comefrom the ear. They can ordinarily be identified during a careful examination ofthe mouth. If an obvious cavity is not visualized with a light, try tapping oneach tooth to see if pain is suddenly elicited (see Dental Pain, page 109[Chapter05.xhtml#page_109].)OUTER EAR INFECTION [nav.xhtml#sub68]Outer ear infection of the auditory canal (otitis externa), the part of the earthat opens to the outside, is commonly called swimmer’s ear. The externalauditory canal generally becomes inflamed from conditions of high humidity,accumulation of ear wax, or contact with contaminated water. Scratching the earafter picking the nose or scratching elsewhere may also be a source of thiscommon infection.Prevent cold air from blowing against the ear. Warm packs against the ear orinstilling comfortably warm sweet oil or even cooking oil can help. Provide painmedication. Obtain professional help if the patient develops a fever, the painbecomes severe, or lymph nodes or adjacent neck tissues start swelling.Significant tissue swelling will require antibiotic treatment. At times atopical ointment will suffice, but with fever or swollen lymph or skinstructures, an oral antibiotic will be required.Triple antibiotic ointment with pramoxine from the Topical Bandaging Module willwork fine for outer ear infections. This is not approved by the FDA for thisuse, as ear infections are serious, and it is not intended that nonphysicianstreat this condition without medical help. From the Rx kit, one could use theTobradex ophthalmic drops. These medications should be applied with the earfacing up and, in the case of the ointment, allowed to melt by body temperature.This may take 5 minutes per ear. Place cotton in the ear to hold the medicationin place. Instill medication 4 times daily and treat for 14 days. If the canalis swollen shut, a steroid ointment may also be used in between applications ofthe other ointments. From the Topical Bandaging Module, use the hydrocortisone1% cream in addition to the triple antibiotic ointment. Tobradex contains enoughsteroid to be adequate for these purposes.Swollen tissue and/or fever also require an oral antibiotic. From the RxOral/Topical Medication Module, use doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, orLevaquin, 500 mg daily. Provide the best pain medication that you can. From yourNon-Rx Oral Medication Module, use 1 or 2 Percogesic tablets every 4 hours.MIDDLE EAR INFECTION [nav.xhtml#sub69]Middle ear infection (otitis media) presents in a person who has sinuscongestion and possibly drainage from allergy or infection. The ear pain can beexcruciating. Fever will frequently be intermittent, normal at one moment andover 103°F (39°C) at other times. Fever indicates bacterial infection of thefluid trapped behind the eardrum. If the eardrum ruptures, the pain will ceaseimmediately and the fever will drop. This drainage allows the body to cure theinfection, but will result in at least temporary damage to the eardrum anddecreased hearing until it heals.There is no increased pain when pulling on the earlobe or pushing on the tragus(the knob in front of the ear) in this condition, unless an outer ear infectionis also present. If you were to look at the eardrum with an otoscope, it wouldbe red and bulging out from pressure or sucked back by a vacuum in the middleear.You do not need an otoscope to diagnose this condition. Many people willcomplain of hearing loss and think they have wax or a foreign body in the earcanal, when they actually have fluid accumulation behind the eardrum.Consequently, ear drops and washing the ear will not help improve thiscondition. Beside pain, the key to the diagnosis is head congestion and fever.There is little that can be accomplished without medication. Protect the earfrom cold, position the head so that the ear is directed upward, and providewarm packs to the ear. While drops do not help cure this problem, some painrelief may be obtained with drops of warmed sweet oil (or even cooking oil) inthe ear.Treatment will consist of providing decongestant, pain medication, and oralantibiotic. A good decongestant and pain reliever from the Non-Rx OralMedication Module is Percogesic, 2 tablets 4 times daily. Rx pain medication isgiven as needed, as indicated in the previous section. Only the Rx Oral/TopicalModule has the proper antibiotics to treat this condition. Use doxycycline, 1tablet twice daily, or Levaquin, 500 mg daily, generally for 5 to 7 days.If the pressure causes the eardrum to rupture, the pain and fever will cease,but there will be a bloody drainage from the ear. Hearing is always decreasedwith the infection and will remain decreased for some time due to the rupturedeardrum. This generally heals itself quite well, but treat with decongestant todecrease the drainage and allow the eardrum to heal. Avoid placing drops orointments in the ear canal if there is a chance that the eardrum has ruptured,as many medications are damaging to the inner ear mechanisms.FOREIGN BODY EAR INJURY [nav.xhtml#sub70]These are generally of three types: accumulation of wax plugs (cerumen), foreignobjects, and living insects. Wax plugs can usually be softened with gentlywarmed oil. This may have to be placed in the ear canal repeatedly over manydays. Irrigating with room temperature water may be attempted with a bulbsyringe, such as the one recommended for wound irrigation in the TopicalBandaging Module. If a wax-plugged ear becomes painful, treat as indicated inthe section on otitis externa (Outer Ear Infection, page 55[Chapter03.xhtml#page_55]).The danger in trying to remove inanimate objects is the tendency to shove themfarther into the ear canal or to damage the delicate ear canal lining, thusadding bleeding to your troubles. Of course, rupturing the eardrum by shovingagainst it would be an unnecessary disaster. Attempt to grasp a foreign bodywith a pair of tweezers if you can see it. Do not poke blindly with anything.Irrigation may be attempted as indicated above.A popular method of aiding in the management of insects in the ear canal is theinstillation of lidocaine to kill the bug instantly, prior to attemptingremoval. There are reports of lidocaine making a person very dizzy, especiallyif it leaks through a hole in the eardrum into the inner ear. This dizziness isvery distressing and may result in profound vomiting and discomfort. It isself-limiting, however, and should not last more than a day if it doestranspire. An alternative method is to drown the bug with cooking or other oil,then attempt removal. Oil seems to kill bugs quicker than water. The fewerstruggles, the less chance for stinging, biting, or other trauma to the delicateear canal and eardrum. Tilt the ear downward, thus hoping to slide the dead bugtoward the entrance, where it can be grasped. Shining a light at the ear to coaxa bug out is probably futile.RUPTURED EARDRUM [nav.xhtml#sub71]Rupture of the eardrum (tympanic membrane perforation) can result from directpuncture, from explosions, and from the barotrauma of diving deep or rapidascent to high altitude. Being smacked on the ear can also rupture the eardrum,an event that can easily happen during horseplay.If suffering from sinus congestion, avoid diving or rapid ascents of altitude invehicles or airplanes. Congestion can lead to blockage of the eustachian tube.Failure to equilibrate pressure through this tube between the middle ear and thethroat, and thus the outside world, can result in damage to the eardrum. In caseof congestion, take a decongestant and pain medication combination such asPercogesic, 2 tablets every 4 hours, until clear. Cancel any diving plans ifcongested. Also, if a gradual pressure squeeze is causing pain while diving, thedive should be terminated.When flying, blocked eustachian tubes will cause more pain upon descent thanascent. When going up, the pressure in the inner ear will increase and blow outthrough the eustachian tube. When coming down, increased outer atmosphericpressure is much less apt to clear the plugged tube, and a squeeze of airagainst the eardrum will result. Try to equalize this pressure by pinching thenose shut and gently increasing the pressure in your mouth and throat againstclosed lips. This will generally clear the eustachian tube and relieve the airsqueeze on the eardrum. Do not overdo this; that can also be painful. Ifbarotrauma results in eardrum rupture, the pain should instantly cease. Theremay be bloody drainage from the ear canal. Do not place drops in the ear canal,but gently wipe away any drainage or frequently change cotton plugs used tocatch the bloody fluid.TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT (TMJ) SYNDROME [nav.xhtml#sub72]TMJ syndrome is actually a problem of the jaw, but the pain radiates into theear so often that we will consider it primarily as a source of ear pain. Thetemporomandibular joint is the hinge joint of the jaw, located just in front ofthe ear. You can easily feel it move if you place a fingertip into your earcanal. When this joint becomes inflamed, it will frequently cause ear pain. Itwill then be painful to apply fingertip pressure directly on the joint. Noswelling should be noted. Tenderness is increased with chewing, and pain andpopping or locking may be noted when opening the jaw widely. The pain radiatesinto the temple area, and when severe, the entire head hurts.Treatment is with local heat. The use of ibuprofen or Percogesic can be veryhelpful. Do not eat foods that are hard to chew or that require opening themouth widely.MOUTH AND THROAT [nav.xhtml#sub73]SORE THROAT [nav.xhtml#sub74]The most common cause of a sore throat, or pharyngitis, is a viral infection.While uncomfortable, this malady requires no antibiotic treatment—in fact,antibiotics will do no good whatsoever. Strictly speaking, the only sore throatthat needs to be treated is the one caused by a specific bacteria (betahemolytic streptococcus, Lance-field group A), as it has been found thatantibiotic treatment for 10 days will avoid the dreaded complication ofrheumatic fever, which may occur in 1 to 3% of people who contract thisparticular infection. Many purists in the medical profession feel that noantibiotics should be used until the results of a throat culture or antibodyscreen that prove this particular infection have been returned from the lab. Ona short trip the victim can be taken to a doctor for a strep culture todetermine if the sore throat was indeed strep. When off the grid longer than 2weeks, it would be best to commit the patient to a full course of antibiotictherapy, realizing that the symptoms will soon pass and the patient seem well,but that it is essential to continue the medication for the full treatmentregimen. The number of days of treatment differs depending upon which antibioticis being used.There are textbook differences in the general appearance of a viral and strepsore throat. The lymph nodes in the neck are swollen in both cases; they aremore tender with bacterial infections, but people with a low pain threshold willcomplain bitterly about soreness regardless of the source of infection. Thethroat will be quite red in bacterial infections, and a white splotchy coatingover the red tonsils or the back portion of the throat generally means a strepinfection— at least these classic indications are present 20% of the time. Sorethroats caused by some viral infections (namely infectious mononucleosis andadenovirus) may mimic all the above. From the Rx Oral/ Topical MedicationModule, use Zithromax 500 mg as described. The 3-tablet dose provides atherapeutic blood level for 10 days.INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS [nav.xhtml#sub75]Infectious mononucleosis, a disease of young adults (teens through 30 years ofage), generally presents as a terrible sore throat, swollen lymph nodes(normally at the back of the neck and not as tender as with strep infection),and a profound feeling of fatigue. It is self-limited, with total recovery to beexpected after 2 weeks for most victims—some, unfortunately are bedridden forweeks and lethargic for up to 6 months. Spleen enlargement is common. The mostserious aspect of this disease is the possibility of splenic rupture, but thisis rare. Avoid palpating the spleen (shoving on the left upper quadrant of theabdomen) and let the victim rest (no hiking, etc.) until the illness and feelingof lethargy has passed. The first 5 days are the worst, with fever andexcruciating sore throat being the major complaints. Continued physical activityin persons with this disease can contribute to a prolonged convalescent period.Treatment is symptomatic, with medication for fever and pain such as the non-RxPercogesic or ibuprofen, each given 1 or 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours. A mildform of hepatitis frequently occurs with mononucleosis that causes nausea andloss of appetite. This requires no specific treatment other than rest. If severeear pain begins, add a decongestant (or just use the Percogesic), 2 tabletsevery 6 hours, to promote relief of eustachian tube pressure. Due to theuncertainty of diagnosis, treat the severe sore throat as if it were a strepinfection, with an antibiotic for 10 days or with Zithromax as indicated above(see Sore Throat on page 59 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_59]).MOUTH SORES [nav.xhtml#sub76]When mouth sores develop, patients frequently believe they either have cancer orinfection, especially herpes. A common reason for a lesion is the sore called apapilloma, caused from rubbing against a sharp tooth or dental work. They maylook serious but are not. They are raised and normally orange in color. One canusually find an obvious rough area causing the irritation. Treatment is to avoidchewing at the lesion and to apply 1% hydrocortisone cream from the TopicalBandaging Module every 3 hours. If the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module isavailable, use the Topicort 0.25% ointment every 4 hours. An alternativetherapy, which can be used simultaneously, is to apply oil of cloves (eugenol).A canker sore, also called an aphthous ulcer, can appear anywhere in the mouthand be any size. It has the distinctive appearance of a white crater with a red,swollen border. Treatment is as above.If there is generalized tissue swelling, possibly with drainage or whitish coveron the gums, foul-smelling breath, and gums and mouth tissue that bleed easilywhen scraped, it is possible that the victim has trench mouth, or Vincent’sinfection. This is caused by poor hygiene, which is unfortunately common on longexpeditions under adverse circumstances. If the white exudate is located overthe tonsils, one has to be concerned about strep throat (see page 30[Chapter03.xhtml#page_30]), infectious mononucleosis (page 60[Chapter03.xhtml#page_60]), and diphtheria. Treat trench mouth with warm waterrinses, swishing the crud off as much as possible. If the Rx Oral/Topical Moduleis available, give the full dose regimen of Zithromax 500 mg tablets for 3 days,or treat with Levaquin, 500 mg, once daily for 5 days.The mouth lesions of herpes simplex begin as small blisters and leave a raw areaonce they have broken open. The ulceration from herpes is red rather than thewhite of the canker sore. They are very painful. From the Rx Oral/TopicalModule, apply the Denavir cream every 2 hours. This is not approved for useinside of the mouth, but it is perfectly safe and it works.Fever blisters are sores that break out on the vermilion border of the lips,generally as a result of herpes simplex virus eruptions. These lesions can beactivated by fevers (hence the name “fever blister”) or other trauma, evenmental stress. Ultraviolet (UV) light will frequently cause flares of feverblisters. This can be a common problem of mountain travel due to the moreintense UV radiation encountered at higher altitudes. Treat as above for theherpes simplex inner mouth lesions. These lesions can be prevented with adequatesunscreen and/ or by taking an antiviral prescription medication.Gum Pain or Swelling, Tooth Issues, see chapter 5 [Chapter05.xhtml], Dental Care(page 109 [Chapter05.xhtml#page_109]).CHEST [nav.xhtml#sub77]One of the most common reasons for a visit to a physician’s office or emergencydepartment is a problem with the chest. Chest pain and shortness of breath canbe symptoms of serious disorders and cannot be taken lightly. Fortunately, mosttimes the chest pain is benign, generally due to muscle spasm or chest wallinflammation. It can be very difficult to evaluate, even at the emergencydepartment. Chest problems are best evaluated by a physician, but in a remotearea, try to sort out your options with the table on page 5[Chapter02.xhtml#page_5]. In case of trauma, the patient may have suffered tornmuscles between the ribs or broken ribs (see page 191[Chapter07.xhtml#page_191]).BRONCHITIS/PNEUMONIA [nav.xhtml#sub78]Infection of the airways in the lung (bronchitis) or infection in the air sacksof the lung (pneumonia) will cause very high fever, persistent cough thatfrequently produces phlegm stained with blood, and prostration of the victim.From the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module treat the fever with Percogesic, 2tablets every 4 hours, or ibuprofen 200 mg, 2 tablets every 4 hours, and thecough with diphenhydramine 25 mg every 4 hours.Cool the fever with a wet cloth over the forehead as needed. Do not bundle thepatient with a very high fever, as this will only drive the temperature higher.The shivering cold feeling that the patient has is only proof that his thermalcontrol mechanism is out of adjustment; trust the thermometer or the back ofyour hand to follow the patient’s temperature. Encourage the patient to drinkfluids, as fever and coughing lead to dehydration. This causes the mucus in thebronchioles to become thick and tenacious. Force fluid to prevent this sputumfrom plugging up sections of the lung.Provide antibiotic: From the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module, give theLevaquin 500 mg daily until the fever is broken and then for an additional 4days. Alternately give the Zithromax as directed on page 285[Chapter11.xhtml#page_285]. Or from the Rx Injectable Medication Module, you maygive Rocephin, 500 mg twice daily.Prepare a sheltered camp for the victim as best as circumstances permit. Untilthe fever is broken, rest is essential with or without the availability ofantibiotic. Encourage the patient to eat. Even though they are very ill, peoplelose their appetites.PNEUMOTHORAX [nav.xhtml#sub79]Even in very healthy young adults and teenagers, it is possible for an air cellin the lung to break for no apparent reason and fill a portion of the chestcavity with air, thus collapsing part of one lung. A minor pneumothorax willspontaneously take care of itself, with the air being reabsorbed and the lungre-expanding over 3 to 5 days. The classic sign of decreased breath sounds overthe area of the collapse will be very difficult for an examiner to detect, evenwith a stethoscope. But listen first to one side of the chest and then the otherto see if there is a difference. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact thatpatients with chest pain do not breathe deeply, and thus all breath sounds aredecreased. Other parts of the physical exam are even more subtle. In unexplainedsevere chest pain in an otherwise healthy individual, pneumothorax might be thecause.Severe pneumothorax will have to be treated by a physician or trained medic withremoval of the trapped air with a large syringe or flutter valve, or by othermethods currently employed in a hospital setting. If pain is severe andbreathing difficult, the only choice is evacuation of the victim.From the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module, you may give 2 Percogesic for pain every4 hours, or 2 to 4 ibuprofen 200 mg tablets every 6 hours. This can be augmentedwith Atarax, 25 mg every 6 hours. It is possible for the pain to be so severethat the use of injectable Nubain or inhaled Stadol will be necessary (see page289 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_289]).PULMONARY EMBOLUS [nav.xhtml#sub80]A pulmonary embolus is a blood clot breaking loose from its point of origin,normally from a leg or pelvic vein, and then lodging in the lung after passingthrough the heart. When serious, this condition appears as shortness of breathand rapid breathing, with a dull substernal chest pain. There may be cough,bloody sputum, fever, and sharp chest pain. A pulmonary embolus can mimicpneumonia (page 63 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_63]) and high-altitude pulmonary edema(page 266 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_266]). It can be fatal if an embolus largeenough to block off more than 50% of the lung circulation occurs at once. Thiscondition generally resolves within a matter of days. Increased risk is found inolder people who have been sitting a long time (such as on plane flights) oranyone immobilized after injury.The only medication in the suggested Off-Grid Medical Kit that would be of anyhelp is ibuprofen, 200 mg given 4 times daily. Stronger doses of this product(up to 800 mg given 4 times daily) or additional pain medication can be given tohelp with the discomfort. The use of Plavix from the Rx Cardiac MedicationModule is not supported by the literature, but giving a loading dose of 300 mg,and then 75 mg daily, is a possible field technique. Due to the uncertainty ofthe diagnosis, treat with an antibiotic such as Zithromax, as described on page285 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_285], or Levaquin, 500 mg once daily, until the painand/or fever resolves, and then continue for an additional 4 days. This wouldnot help a pulmonary embolus, but it would properly treat pneumonia.ABDOMEN [nav.xhtml#sub81]Even for professionals with years of clinical experience and unlimitedlaboratory and X-ray facilities, abdominal pain can be a diagnostic dilemma. Howserious is it? Should evacuation start, or can it be waited out or safelytreated off the grid? Or what treatment protocol can be followed when there isno grid?ABDOMINAL PAIN [nav.xhtml#sub82]Any abdominal pain that lasts longer than 24 hours is a cause for concern, andprofessional help should be sought if possible. Diagnosis will be determinedfrom the history (type and severity of pain, location, radiation, when itstarted), as well as certain aspects of the physical examination and theclinical course that develops. Some of these aspects are summarized in Table 3-6and in the discussion that follows.A burning sensation in the middle of the upper part of the abdomen(mid-epigastrium) is probably gastritis, or stomach irritation. If allowed topersist, this can develop into an ulcer, a crater eaten into the stomach orduodenal wall. In the latter case the pain may be most notable in the rightupper quadrant. For some reason, ulcers will occasionally feel better if youpress against them with your hand. This supposedly was why Napoleon is seen withhis hand inside his jacket in his favorite pose—he was pressing against hisabdomen to relieve the pain of an ulcer.Severe, persistent mid-epigastric pain that is also frequently burning in naturecan be pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. This is a serious problembut rare. Alcohol consumption can cause pancreatitis, as well as gastritis andulcer formation. Avoid alcohol if pain in this area develops. In fact, any foodthat seems to increase the symptoms should be avoided. Reflux of stomach acid upthe esophagus, caused by a hiatal hernia—protrusion of a part of the stomachthrough a hole in the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes—will causethe same symptoms. The reflux also causes the burning pain to radiate up thecenter of the chest.Treatment for all of the above is aggressive antacid therapy. These conditionscan be made worse by eating spicy food, tomato products, and other foods high inacid content. Milk may temporarily help the burning of an ulcer or gastritis butmay increase the burning sensation later. Avoid any medications containingaspirin and ibuprofen. Acid suppression medication such as Tagamet, Zantac,Pepcid, Axid, Prevacid, Nexium, AcipHex, Dexilant, and Prilosec help greatly,and anyone with a history of these disorders should consider adding such itemsto the medical kit. There is a concern that these medications can make the usermore vulnerable to traveler’s diarrhea, cholera, and other infectious diseasefrom which a normal or high stomach acid level might otherwise provide someprotection. A safer medication for persons afflicted with heartburn notresponsive to antacids, who must travel in a third-world situation, would beCarafate taken 1 gram 4 times daily. This is a prescription medication.Mild nausea may be associated with the above problems, but intense nausea couldindicate gastroenteritis, food poisoning (generally these also cause significantdiarrhea), hepatitis, or gall bladder disorder.Table 3-6.

No burning is associated with gall bladder pain,and this discomfort is typically made worse by eating and sometimes even bysmelling greasy foods. While drinking cream or milk would initially help thepain of gastritis or an ulcer, it causes an immediate increase in symptoms ifthe gall bladder is involved. Treatment is avoidance of fatty foods. Nausea andvomiting can be treated as indicated on page 70 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_70]. Treatfor pain as described on page 31 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_31].The onset of fever is an important indication of infection of the blocked gallbladder. This is a surgical emergency. Treat with the strongest antibioticavailable. If the Rx Injectable Medication Module is available, give Rocephin,500 mg, 2 doses, IM immediately; repeat with 2 doses every 12 hours. Lackingthat medication, give Levaquin, 500 mg, daily. Continue to treat the pain andnausea as required for relief. Offer as much fluid as the patient can tolerate.Gall bladder disease is more common in overweight people over the age of 30. Itis also more common in women.The possibility of appendicitis is a major concern, as it can occur in any agegroup, and that includes healthy individuals. It is fortunately rare. Whilesurgery is the treatment of choice, probably as many as 70% of people nottreated with surgery or antibiotics can survive this problem. The survival rateis over 80% with appropriate IV therapy. Of course, timely surgery provides 100%survival. A 2018 Finnish study confirmed the above statement; unfortunately, italso showed that within 5 years 40% of those not having surgery will have arecurrence.The classic presentation of this illness is a vague feeling of discomfort aroundthe umbilicus (navel). Temperature may be low grade, 99.6 to 100°F (or 37°C) atfirst. Within 12 hours the discomfort turns to pain and localizes in the rightlower quadrant, most frequently at a point two-thirds of the way between thenavel and the very top of the right pelvic bone (anterior-superior iliac crest).Ask the patient two questions: Where did you first start hurting? (Bellybutton.) Now where do you hurt? (Right lower quadrant as described.) Thoseanswers mean appendicitis until it is ruled out.It is possible but unusual to have diarrhea with appendicitis. Diarrhea usuallymeans that the patient does not have appendicitis. I find it helpful to ask thepatient to walk and watch how he does it. A person with appendicitis will walkwith rather careful, short steps, bent slightly forward in pain. They certainlydo not bounce off the examining table and walk down the hall to the bathroom.Anyone with springy steps most likely does not have appendicitis.Sometimes full laboratory and X-ray facilities can do no better in making thisdiagnosis. The ultimate answer will come from surgical exploration. If a surgeonhas doubts, he might wait, with the patient safely in a hospital or at homeunder close supervision. But the patient with those symptoms should certainly betaken to a surgeon as soon as possible.In the examination of the painful abdomen, several maneuvers can indicate theseriousness of the situation. The first is to determine how guarded the area isto palpation. If the patient’s stomach is rigid to gentle pushing, this can meanthat extreme tenderness and irritation of the peritoneum, or abdominal walllining, exists. Use only gentle pushing. If there is an area of the abdomenwhere it does not hurt to push, apply pressure rather deeply. Now, suddenly takeyour hand away! If pain flares over the area of suspect tenderness, this iscalled referred rebound tenderness and means that the irritation has reached anadvanced stage. This person should be evacuated to surgical help at once.What can you do if you are in the deep bush, say the Back River of Canada,without the faintest hope of evacuating the patient? Move the patient as littleas possible. No further prodding of the abdomen should be done, as her only hopeis that the appendix will form an abscess that will be walled-off by the bodilydefense mechanisms. Give no food. Provide small amounts of water, Gatorade, orfruit drinks as tolerated. With advanced disease the intestines will stopworking and the patient will vomit any excess. This will obviously cause adisturbance to the gut and possibly rupture the appendix or the abscess.Treat for pain, nausea, and with antibiotics as indicated in the section on gallbladder infection.The abscess should form 24 to 72 hours following onset of the illness. Manysurgeons would elect to open and drain this abscess as soon as the patient isbrought to them. Other surgeons feel it is best to leave the patient alone atthis time and allow the abscess to continue the walling-off process. They feelthere is so much inflammation present that surgery only complicates thesituation further. Even without surgery, within 2 to 3 weeks the patient may beable to move with minimal discomfort.One form of therapy never to be employed when there is a suspicion ofappendicitis is a laxative. The action of the laxative may cause disruption ofthe appendix abscess with resultant generalized peritonitis (massive abdominalinfection).It is currently thought that there is no justification for the prophylacticremoval of an appendix in an individual, unless he is planning to move to a veryremote area without medical help for an extended period of time and it is knownfrom X-ray that he has a fecalith (or stone) in the colon at the mouth of theappendix. Otherwise, the possible later complications of surgical adhesions maywell outweigh the “benefit” of such a procedure.VOMITING [nav.xhtml#sub84]Nausea and vomiting are frequently caused by infections known asgastroenteritis. Many times these are viral, so antibiotics are of no value.These infections will usually resolve without treatment in 24 to 48 hours. Feveris seldom high but may briefly increase in some cases. Fever should not persistabove 100°F (38°C) longer than 12 hours. Nausea may be treated withdiphenhydramine, 25 mg every 8 hours, from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module, orwith Atarax, 25 mg every 6 hours, from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module. Ifthe Rx Injectable Medication Module is available, severe nausea and vomiting maybe treated with Vistaril, 25 to 50 mg every 6 hours given intramuscularly.Vomiting without diarrhea will not require the use of an antibiotic. If thevomiting is caused by severe illness, such as an ear infection, then use of anantibiotic to treat the underlying cause is justified.Nausea induced by high altitude, see page 265 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_265].Nausea associated with jaundice, see hepatitis, pages 225[Chapter09.xhtml#page_225]–227 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_227].Nausea from ingestion of seafood, see paralytic shellfish poisoning, page 86[Chapter03.xhtml#page_86]; scombroid poisoning, page 85[Chapter03.xhtml#page_85]; and ciguatera poisoning, page 85[Chapter03.xhtml#page_85].See also plant or food poisoning, page 84 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_84], andpetroleum products poisoning, page 84 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_84].MOTION SICKNESS [nav.xhtml#sub85]Motion in any vehicle can induce nausea, hence the many etiologies of thisdisorder, such as sea sickness, air sickness, and the dreaded“tilt-a-whirl”-induced vomiting at the amusement park. After being exposed tomotion for many days—for example, a long nautical trip or train ride—some peoplebecome nauseated when the motion suddenly stops and they are on terra firma. Thenatural method for preventing motion sickness is to look at a point on thehorizon, thus minimizing the motion exaggeration. On a large plane, stare at adistant cloud, or if you’re stuck in a center seat, look as far forward in theplane as possible. Reading tends to increase the symptoms. Avoid alcohol andgreasy foods on bouncy trips. With repeated exposure to the same sort of motionover many days, you may become adapted and experience less discomfort.To medically prevent and treat motion sickness, a very useful medication in theNon-Rx Oral Medication Module is diphenhydramine, 25 mg taken 1 hour prior todeparture and repeated every 6 hours as needed. This is not an indicated use forthis medication, and treatment or prevention of nausea will not be noted on thepackage. But it works, although drowsiness may be a problem for some (see page282 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_282]).Transderm Scop, a patch containing scopolamine, has been developed forprevention of motion sickness and post-operative nausea and vomiting, but itrequires a prescription. Each patch may be worn behind the ear for 3 days. It isfairly expensive but very worthwhile if you are prone to this malady. Theretends to be a higher frequency of side effects in elderly people with thismedication, consisting of visual problems, confusion, and loss of temperatureregulation. It is unlikely that this medicated patch would tolerate long periodsof storage.A valuable drug to prevent and treat motion sickness is Atarax, 25 mg every 4hours as needed, from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module, or Vistaril, 25 mgIM every 4 hours as needed, from the Rx Injectable Medication Module.DIARRHEA [nav.xhtml#sub86]Diarrhea is the expulsion of watery stool. This malady is usually self-limitedbut can be a threat to life, depending upon its cause and extent. Diarrhea canbe the result of bowel disorders such as diver-ticulitis or colitis; infectiousdiseases such as cholera, campylobacter, shigella, or salmonella; and thepresence of many other creatures hiding in contaminated food or water; it isseen rarely with appendicitis and gall bladder disease. The serious infectiousdisease malaria can have diarrhea as a presenting complaint. Obviously,diagnosing the cause of diarrhea can be of importance both in regard to treatingand in estimating the danger to the patient.Diverticulitis is usually found in people over the age of 40 and is generally acondition only of the elderly. Diverticula are little pouches that form on thelarge intestine, or colon, from a weakness that develops over time in themuscles of its wall. These are of no trouble unless they become infected.Infection causes diarrhea, fever, and painful cramping. Pain is usually locatedalong the left side of the abdomen. It tends to be at a constant location,unlike many conditions with diarrhea where the pain migrates. Appendicitis painis in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (see page 67[Chapter03.xhtml#page_67]). Treatment for diverticulitis is with antibioticssuch as Levaquin, 500 mg daily, or Rocephin, 500 mg given by injection twicedaily.Colitis and other inflammations of the bowel cause repeated bouts of diarrhea.At times a fever may be present. These cases are chronic, and likediverticulitis, the diagnosis must be made with CT scan using contrast orcolonoscopy. If in doubt, treat with antibiotics as indicated underdiverticulitis. Both conditions require specific drugs for treatment, such asthe steroids included with the Rx Oral/ Topical and Injectable MedicationModules, but unless the person has a prior history of these diseases, the use ofsuch drugs off the grid is inappropriate.Traveler’s diarrhea is caused by infections, so prevention seems an appropriatepriority. Prevention equates to staying alert. Water sources must be known to bepure or should be treated, as indicated on pages 89 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_89]–94[Chapter03.xhtml#page_94]. Once dehydrated or freeze-dried food has beenreconstituted, it should be stored as carefully as any fresh, unprocessed food.Certain animal products are tainted in various parts of the world, particularlyat specific times of the year. Know the flora and fauna from local sources thatyou can utilize for survival! The primary prevention that has been classicallystressed concerning food safety is “Peel it, boil it, or forget it,” but thishas not been proven to be practical or even accurate. The recognized method ofreducing diarrhea in travelers has been to improve the hygiene of food handlerspreparing the food. Simple measures such as washing hands appropriately, usingclean utensils, and reasonable food-preparation techniques apply critically whenoff the grid as well.Diarrhea is diagnosed when an individual has 2 or 3 times the number ofcustomary bowel movements for that individual. These stools can be either soft,meaning that they will take the shape of a container, or watery, meaning thatthey can be poured. By definition at least one associated symptom of fever,chills, abdominal cramps, nausea, or vomiting must be present. This willgenerally mean 4 unformed stools in a day or 3 unformed stools in an 8-hourperiod accompanied by at least one other symptom listed above.While the disease is generally self-limiting, lasting 2 to 3 days, this illnesscan result in chronic bowel problems in many patients. Initially, as many as 75%of people will have abdominal pain and cramps, 50% will have nausea, and 25%will have vomiting and fever. An acute onset of watery diarrhea usually meansthat an enterotoxigenic E. coli is the cause, but shigellosis will also firstpresent in this manner. Symptoms of bloody diarrhea or mucoid stools arefrequently seen with invasive pathogens such as shigella, campylobacter, orsalmonella. The presence of chronic diarrhea with malabsorption and gasindicates possible giardia. Rotavirus disease starts with vomiting in 80% ofcases.In a study of US students in Mexico, the cause of diarrhea was found to beenterotoxigenic E. coli 40%; enteroadherent E. coli 5%; Giardia lamblia andEntamoeba histolytica 2%; rotavirus 10%; aeromonas 1%; shigella 15%; salmonella7%; campylobacter 3%; and unknown 17%. Studies of traveler’s diarrhea showdifferent frequencies from the above in various other locations of the world,but the cause is always due to infection.Various medications have been shown effective in preventing traveler’s diarrhea,but experts discourage their use due to cost, exposing people to drug sideeffects, and the possible development of resistant germs due to antibioticoveruse. Pepto-Bismol, 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) or 2 tablets taken 4 timesdaily, can prevent this problem. Ugh! About 8 aspirin tablets worth ofsalicylate are in that quantity of Pepto-Bismol. Prevention with antibiotics iseffective, although not usually indicated. Prevention of diarrhea-causingillness is best accomplished in a survival situation with good hygiene.Treating diarrhea with Pepto-Bismol requires 2 tablespoons every 30 minutes for8 doses. As most diarrhea in developing countries is from bacterial causes, theuse of antibiotics can be very effective. A single dose of the antibioticLevaquin, 500 mg, can eliminate diarrhea instantly. Loperamide, 2 mg, from theNon-Rx Oral Medication Module, may not be required if you have access toLevaquin. A dose of loperamide may be given simultaneously with the Levaquin.When using loperamide, give 2 tablets at once, followed by 1 tablet after eachloose stool, with a maximum adult dose of 8 tablets per day. One tablet of thepain medication Norco 10/325 can also stop diarrhea, but it would be best to usethe loperamide and/or Levaquin if they are available. In parts of the worldwhere Levaquin is losing its effectiveness, such as the Indian subcontinent,Southeast Asia, and Africa, Zithromax is a better choice. Since diarrhea inNorth America is seldom caused by bacteria, antibiotics should be used thereonly after stool cultures.CONSTIPATION [nav.xhtml#sub87]One of the popular wilderness medical texts has instructions on how to break upa fecal impaction digitally, that is, using your finger to break up a hard stoolstuck in the rectum. Don’t let it get that far. In healthy young adults(especially teenagers), there may be a reluctance to defecate due to the unusualsurroundings, lack of a toilet, and perhaps swarms of insects or freezing cold.It is the group leader’s responsibility to make sure that a trip member does notfecal hoard by failing to defecate in a reasonable length of time. Certainly,one should be concerned after 3 days without a bowel movement.To prevent this problem, I always include a stewed fruit at breakfast on menus.The use of hot and cold food and water in the morning will frequently wake upthe “gastric-colic reflex” and get things moving perfectly well.If the 5-day mark is approaching, especially if the patient—and the person hasbecome a patient at about this point—is obviously uncomfortable, it will becomenecessary to use a laxative. From the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module, give 15 mgbisacodyl laxative tablet at bedtime. If that fails, the next morning take 2tablets. Under winter conditions, when getting up in subzero weather might proveabominable, or under heavy insect conditions, take these tablets in the morning,rather than at bedtime, to preclude this massive inconvenience occurring in themiddle of the night. Any laxative will cause abdominal cramping, depending uponhow strong it is. Expect this.HEMORRHOIDS [nav.xhtml#sub88]Also called piles, this painful swelling is a cluster of varicose veins aroundthe rectum. External hemorrhoids are small, rounded, purplish masses thatenlarge when straining at stool. Unless a clot forms in them, they are soft andnot tender. When clots form, they can become very painful, actuallyexcruciating. Hemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal bleeding, withblood also appearing on the toilet tissue. The condition can be very painful forabout 5 days, after which the clots start to absorb, the pain decreases, and themass regresses, leaving only small skin tags.Provide the patient with the OTC pain medication Percogesic, 2 tablets every 4hours. The application of heat is helpful during the acute phase. Heat a clothin water and apply for 15 minutes 4 times a day if possible. Avoid constipation,as mentioned above in that section. If you are carrying the Rx Oral/TopicalMedication Module, Topicort 0.25% ointment will provide the anti-inflammationability of a steroid and some local pain relief.HERNIA [nav.xhtml#sub89]The most common hernia in a male is the inguinal hernia, an outpouching of theintestines through a weak area in the abdominal wall located above and on eitherside of the groin. It is through this area that the spermatic cord connects thetestes to the back of the penis. A hernia can be produced while straining orlifting, even coughing or sneezing, when the bowel pushes along the spermaticcord. There will be a sharp pain at the location of the hernia and the patientwill note a bulge. This bulge may disappear when he lies on his back and relaxes(i.e., the hernia has reduced).If the intestine in the hernia is squeezed by the abdominal wall to the pointthat the blood supply is cut off, the hernia is termed a strangulated hernia.This is a medical emergency, as the loop of gut in the hernia will die, turngangrenous, and lead to a generalized peritonitis or abdominal infection(peritonitis is discussed under Gall Bladder Problems and Appendicitis, page 67[Chapter03.xhtml#page_67]). This condition is much worse than appendicitis, anddeath will result if it is not treated surgically.The hernia that fails to reduce or disappear when the victim relaxes in arecumbent position is termed incarcerated. While this may turn into anemergency, it is not one at that point.Most hernias caused by straining in adults will not strangulate. Furtherstraining should be avoided. If lifting items is necessary, or coughing cannotbe prevented, etc., the victim should protect himself from further tissue damageby pressing against the area with one hand, thus holding the hernia inreduction.BLADDER INFECTION [nav.xhtml#sub90]The hallmarks of bladder infection (cystitis) are the urge to urinatefrequently, burning upon urination, small amounts of urine being voided witheach passage, and discomfort in the suprapubic region— the lowest area of theabdomen. Frequently the victim has fever, with its attendant chills and muscleaches. In fact, people can become quite ill with a generalized infection causedby numerous bacteria entering their bloodstream. At times the urine becomescloudy and even bloody. Cloudy urine without the above symptoms does not mean aninfection is present and is frequently normal. The infection can extend to thekidney, at which time the patient also has considerable flank pain, centered atthe bottom edge of the ribs along the lateral aspect of the back on the involvedside (often both sides). While bladder infections are more common in women thanmen, they are not an uncommon problem in either sex. One suffering fromrecurrent infections should be thoroughly evaluated by a physician prior tohaving to leave the grid.Many drugs have been developed for treating infections of the genitourinarysystem. Doxycycline, 100 mg, 1 tablet taken twice daily, is very effective.Levaquin, 500 mg tablet once daily, is ideal to use if the doxycycline seemsineffective. Generally, 3 days is a sufficient length of time for treatment,unless flank pain is involved, in which case provide 10 days of antibiotic.Symptoms should disappear within 24 to 48 hours, or it may mean that thebacteria are resistant to one antibiotic and the other should be substituted.For severe infections with high fever that have not responded within 48 hours tooral antibiotic use, the injectable Rocephin, 500 mg IM given twice daily,provided in place of the oral antibiotic would be a superior choice.Additional treatment should consist of drinking copious amounts of fluid, atleast 8 quarts per day! At times this simple rinsing action may even curecystitis, but I wouldn’t count on it. Use an antibiotic, if it is available.Percogesic or ibuprofen may be needed to treat the fever and pain that accompanysuch problems prior to the start of the antibiotic and during the early stagesof therapy.REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS [nav.xhtml#sub91]VENEREAL DISEASES [nav.xhtml#sub92]Venereal infections are totally preventable by abstention; any other techniquefalls short of being foolproof. Most venereal infections cause symptoms in themale but frequently do not in the female. Either may note increased discomfortwith urination, the development of sores or unusual growths around thegenitalia, and discharge from the portions of the anatomy used in sex (pharynx,penis, vagina, anus). Some venereal diseases can be very difficult to detect,such as syphilis, hepatitis B, and AIDS. Hepatitis B is rampant in many parts ofthe world, with high carrier rates in local population groups. It can beprevented with a vaccine. These are no vaccines against the other venerealdiseases except human papillomavirus (HPV).Gonorrhea is common and easy to detect in the male. Symptoms appear between 2and 8 days from time of contact and basically consist of a copiousgreenish-yellow discharge. The female will frequently not have symptoms. Fromthe Rx Oral/Topical Medical Module provide doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for15 days, to ensure adequate treatment of syphilis, which may have been caught atthe same time. Also give Zithromax, 1 gram at once (4 of the 250 mg tablets), tocure chlamydia, which frequently is a coinfection.Syphilis has an incubation period of 2 to 6 weeks before the characteristic soreappears. The development of a painless ulcer (1/4 to 1/2 inch, or 0.6 to 1.2centimeters in size), generally with enlarged, non-tender lymph nodes in theregion, is a hallmark of this disease. A painful ulcer formation is morecharacteristic of herpes simplex. The lesion may not appear in a syphilisvictim, making the early detection of this disease very difficult. A secondstage consisting of a generalized skin rash (which usually does not itch, doesnot produce blisters, and frequently appears on the soles of the feet and palmsof the hands) appears about 6 weeks after the lesions mentioned above. The thirdphase of the disease may develop in several years, during which nearly any organsystem in the body may be affected. The overall study of syphilis is socomplicated that a great medical instructor (Sir William Osler) once said, “Toknow syphilis is to know medicine.” Treatment of primary-stage syphilis is 15days of antibiotics, as mentioned above. Development of a clear, scantydischarge in the male may be due to chlamydia or other nonspecific urethralinfections. Symptoms appear 7 to 28 days after contact. Women may have nosymptoms. Treat with doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, for 15 days. Blood testsfor syphilis should be performed now (ideally) and again in 3 months. Since 20%of victims with nonspecific urethritis will have a relapse, adequate medicalfollow-up after the trip is essential.Herpes lesions can respond to Denavir 1% cream applied frequently during the dayuntil they disappear in 8 to 10 days. Famvir capsules, 250 mg taken 3 timesdaily for 7 to 10 days, are effective during the acute phase, when the symptomsfirst manifest.Upon returning home, members who may have experienced symptoms of a sexuallytransmitted disease should be seen by their physician for serology tests forsyphilis, hepatitis B tests, chlamydia smears, gonorrheal cultures, herpessimplex titers, and possibly HIV studies. Lesions or growths should be examinedas possible molluscum contagiosum, and venereal warts should be treated.VAGINAL DISCHARGE AND ITCHING [nav.xhtml#sub93]Vaginal discharge and/or itching are often not indicators for venereal disease.The most common cause is a fungal or monilia (candida) infection. This conditionis more common in conditions of high humidity or with the wearing of tightclothes such as pants or pantyhose.A typical monilia infection has a copious white discharge with curds likecottage cheese. From the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module, one can use theclotrimazole 1% cream. This formulation has been designed for foot and otherskin fungal problems, but it will work vaginally as well. From the Rx OralMedication Module, also use 1 Diflucan 150 mg tablet for treatment.A frothy, greenish-yellow, irritating discharge may be due to trichomonasinfection. This can be spread by sexual encounters. The male infected with thisorganism generally has no symptoms, or perhaps a slight mucoid discharge earlyin the morning, noted before urinating. The treatment of choice is Flagyl(metronidazole), 250 mg capsule 3 times a day for 10 days, or 8 capsules givenas 1 dose. This drug cannot be taken with alcohol. Sexual abstention isimportant until medication is finished and a cure is evident clinically. GenericFlagyl is frequently available in third-world countries at pharmacies without aprescription.A copious yellow-green discharge may indicate gonorrhea. Any irritatingdischarge that is not thick and white is best treated with Levaquin, 500 mg oncedaily. If sexual contact may have been the source of the problem, treat for 15days to also kill any syphilis that may have been contracted simultaneously. Adouche of very dilute Hibiclens surgical scrub, or very dilute detergentsolution, can be prepared and may be helpful; very dilute is better than toostrong. Frequent douching is not required, but it may be done for a few days asrequired for comfort and hygiene.MENSTRUAL PROBLEMS [nav.xhtml#sub94]On the move, menstrual flow is best contained with a vaginally inserted tampon,but be sure to have experience with the chosen product prior to heading into thebackcountry. A resealable plastic bag, with perhaps a paper bag liner, should becarried if it is necessary to pack out discarded pads. Many find the use of avaginal cup is the best solution. An excellent blog article that providespre-trip advice is “GirlTalk: How to Handle Your Period in the Backcountry”(blog.rei.com/hike/girl-talk-part-2-handling-your-period-in-the-backcountry/[http://blog.rei.com/hike/girl-talk-part-2-handling-your-period-in-the-backcountry/]).Rolling several Nu-Gauze pads from the Topical Bandaging Module will substituteas an outer sanitary napkin if none is available. Menstrual cramping cangenerally be controlled with ibuprofen, 200 mg, 1 or 2 tablets every 4 to 6hours, from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module. While this medication isgenerally used as an anti-arthritic, its anti-prostaglandin activities make itan ideal medication for the treatment of menstrual pain.Menorrhagia, either excessive flow or long period of flowage, should beevaluated by a physician to determine if there is an underlying pathology thatcould or should be corrected. If the problem is simply one of hormone imbalance,this can frequently be corrected by the use of birth control pills with higheramounts of estrogen and lower progestogen content. Consult a physician well inadvance of a trip, as it takes a least three cycles of the “correct” hormonedose to comfortably predict adequate management.SPONTANEOUS ABORTION [nav.xhtml#sub95]Bleeding during pregnancy is not unusual—20 to 30% of women bleed or crampduring the first 20 weeks of their pregnancies. This is termed threatenedabortion and is treated with bed rest, since this usually decreases the bleedingand cramping. However, 10 to 15% of pregnant women will go on to abort. As longas all products of the abortion pass—a “complete abortion”—the bleeding and painwill stop and the uterus shrinks back to its normal size.An incomplete abortion—the expulsion of only a portion of the fetus or therupture of only the membranes—will often require a surgeon’s care to perform aD&C (dilation and curettage). However, urgent evacuation is always mandatory.Watch for signs of sepsis, such as elevated temperature, and start an antibioticif possible. Give Rocephin, 1 gram IM, followed by 500 mg IM every 12 hours. Thebest oral antibiotic recommended from your Rx Oral/Topical Medication Modulewould be Levaquin, 500 mg given daily. Give pain medication as necessary.ECTOPIC PREGNANCY [nav.xhtml#sub96]In an ectopic pregnancy, spotting and cramping usually begin shortly after thefirst missed period. If a pregnancy test is positive and the woman has severelower abdominal pain lasting more than 24 hours, you probably have a surgicalemergency on your hands. A rupture of the uterine tube usually occurs at 6 to 8weeks of pregnancy, while a rupture of a cornual pregnancy occurs at 12 to 16weeks. The rupture causes massive blood loss with a rapid onset of shock anddeath when it occurs.While other causes of spotting during pregnancy are possible, you are in noposition to handle any of them off the grid. Evacuate this woman immediately.If a woman is having spotting and lower abdominal pain, and the pregnancy testis negative, you are in no position to bet her life that she is not pregnant.Ectopic pregnancies have lower blood levels of ß subunit HCG hormone to detect,and the test may, therefore, be falsely negative.PREGNANCY [nav.xhtml#sub97]If you are approaching a potential off-grid situation and a member of your teamis in advanced pregnancy, you will need to have the supplies and basic knowledgeof delivery. During the second trimester she should receive an additional 340kcal (kilocalorie) and during the third trimester 450 additional kcal of foodper day. She should also have a multivitamin that includes 400 to 600 mcg folicacid, 400 IU vitamin D, 300 mg calcium, 70 mg vitamin C, 3 mg thiamine, 2 mgriboflavin, 20 mg niacin, 6 mg vitamin B-12, 290 mcg iodine (but not more than atotal daily amount of 1,100 mcg), and trace amounts of zinc and copper.Over 94% of deliveries are uncomplicated, but about 10 to 20% of pregnancies endwith a spontaneous abortion before the 20th week; this might be much higher asmany miscarriages occur so early in pregnancy that the woman might not realizeshe was even pregnant. Once pregnancy is advanced and obvious (generally beyondthe 12th to 16th week), care must be taken to make sure that the woman’s diet isappropriate as mentioned above and that she does not develop hypertension (notusual before week 20). This hypertension is best controlled with reduced sodiumintake and the possible use of a diuretic blood pressure medication. Gestationaldiabetes can occur between weeks 24 and 28, and one should ideally check bloodsugars at that time. If the person develops signs of diabetes (frequency ofurination matched with thirst), diet and exercise usually manage 80% of thesecases, while some women will require insulin. Frequency and burning whileurinating small amounts may mean a urinary tract infection. Obstetricians wouldtreat a urinary tract infection usually with nitrofurantoin, 100 mg twice daily,but the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module suggestion of levofloxacin, 500 mgonce daily for 3 days, is safe. Edema in late pregnancy is a serious sign of acondition called preeclampsia (hypertension, protein in urine, and edema). Itmust be treated as a medical emergency. Return to the grid ifpossible—otherwise, bed rest, salt restriction, diuretic. On the grid, the babyis frequently delivered early to prevent this condition from progressing, whichcan otherwise lead to the death of both the mother and child. Seizures fromeclampsia are difficult to treat and are rare in places like the United Statesbut relatively common in areas where I volunteer like Haiti. This is a deadlysituation without help.In general, delivery progresses through various stages without danger to motheror child. However, even basic training for the birthing assistant will provide asafer birth and management of the newborn and will identify issues requiringsometimes very basic maneuvers, or some very desperate ones, to save lives inthe 10% of situations that require help. There is an ideal chapter on birthingin Buck Tilton’s book Wilderness First Responder (Falcon Guides, 2010) coveringbasic principles in detail, including immediate care of the newborn.Survival mode off the grid will require maintaining the mother on her prenatalvitamins and encouraging breastfeeding exclusively for 6 months, then continuecombined with solid food for 2 years.PAINFUL TESTICLE [nav.xhtml#sub98]If pain is severe, provide support by having the victim lie on the insulatedground with a cloth draped over both thighs, forming a sling or cradle on whichthe painful scrotum may rest. If ambulatory, provide support to prevent movementof the scrotum. Cold packs would help initially, and providing adequate pain andnausea medication as available is certainly appropriate. An antibiotic is notrequired unless a fever ensues.Spontaneous pain in the scrotum, with enlargement of a testicle, can be due toan infection of the testicle (orchitis) or more commonly to an infection of thesperm-collecting system called the epididymis (epididymitis). Treatment ofchoice would be to provide an antibiotic such as doxycycline, 100 mg, 1 tablettwice daily, or Levaquin, 500 mg once daily. Pain medication should be providedas necessary.The problem may not be due to an infection at all. It is possible for thetesticle to become twisted, due to a slight congenital defect, with severe painresulting. This testicular torsion, as it is called, is a surgical emergency. Itcan be almost impossible to distinguish from orchitis. In a suspected case oftorsion, it is helpful to try to reduce the torsion. Since the testicle alwaysseems to rotate “inward,” one need only rotate the affected testicle “outward.”This will often result in immediate relief of the pain. If you cannot achievethis, or if you are dealing with orchitis, no harm is done; but if it is atorsion, you have saved the testicle and the trip. A person with severetesticular pain should be evacuated as soon as possible, as infection or torsioncan result in sterility of the involved side. An unreduced testicular torsioncan become gangrenous, with life-threatening infection resulting.POISONING [nav.xhtml#sub99]PLANT OR FOOD POISONING [nav.xhtml#sub100]The ideal treatment after poison plant ingestion is to give the patientactivated charcoal. If that isn’t possible, induce vomiting by gagging thethroat with a finger or spoon. This latter technique may well be the only methodavailable while in the bush.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS POISONING [nav.xhtml#sub101]The danger from accidentally drinking various petroleum products— for example,while siphoning gas from one container to another—is the possibility ofaccidentally inhaling or aspirating this liquid into the lungs. That will kill.The substances are not toxic enough in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract towarrant the danger of inducing vomiting. Do not worry about swallowing severalmouthfuls of any petroleum product. If the person vomits, there is nothing youcan do about it, except position him so that there is less chance of aspirationinto the lungs—sitting while bending forward is probably ideal. The morevolatile the substance, the more the danger of aspiration. In other words,kerosene is less dangerous than Coleman fuel.If organic phosphorous pesticides are dissolved in the fuel, you have a morecomplex problem. These substances are potentially toxic and must be removed. Inthe emergency room this would be accomplished by gastric lavage, or stomachpumping. In the bush, if you cannot evacuate the person within 12 hours, youwill have to take a chance of inducing vomiting, with possible lethalaspiration—to eliminate the poison. Treat by inducing gagging as described aboveunder Plant or Food Poisoning. After vomiting, administer a slurry of activatedcharcoal, if available. This helps bind non-regurgitated toxins. Charcoalpowder, to which you add water to form a slurry, is available at pharmacies. Inthe field you might consider tearing apart a charcoal water filter and crushingthe charcoal granules. Or you can make the slurry from the blackened, partiallyburnt portions of logs from a campfire.CIGUATERA POISONING [nav.xhtml#sub102]Ciguatera poisoning is caused by a toxin released by a small ocean organismcalled a dinoflagellate. As various species of fish eat this small plant, theyacquire the toxin. Larger fish that in turn prey on the smaller fish acquirelarger and larger amounts of the toxin, thus resulting in more severe cases ofciguatera toxin poisoning in humans if these larger fish are consumed. Over 400species of fish from the tropical reefs of Florida, the West Indies, and thePacific have been implicated, but most often it has been barracuda, grouper, andamber-jack that are contaminated. No deep-sea fish, such as tuna, dolphin, orwahoo, have been found contaminated.There is no way to detect contamination—no change in flavor, texture, or colorof the fish flesh. Worse yet, no method of preserving, cooking, or treating fishcan destroy this toxin. One must rely on local knowledge to avoid potentiallypolluted species.Symptoms usually start with numbness and tingling of the lips and tongue, andthen progress to dry mouth, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea thatlasts 6 to 17 hours. Muscle and joint pain, muscle weakness, facial pain, andunusual sensory phenomena such as reversal of hot and cold sensations develop.Occasionally low blood pressure, respiratory depression, and coma can result.Neurological symptoms are made worse by alcohol and exercise. Start rescuebreathing if necessary (see page 17 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_17]). This type ofpoisoning does not result in death.See also Scombroid Poisoning (below) and Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (page 86[Chapter03.xhtml#page_86]).SCOMBROID POISONING [nav.xhtml#sub103]The flesh of dark-meat fish, such as tuna, mackerel, albacore, bonito,amberjack, and mahi-mahi (dolphin), contain large amounts of histi-dine.Improper storage after catching these fish allows bacterial enzymatic changes tothis meat, releasing large amounts of histamine and other toxic by-products thatare not destroyed by cooking.Symptoms of scombroid poisoning include flushing, dizziness, headache, burningof the mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe poisoning cancause significant respiratory distress. Diphenhydramine has been reported tocause an increase in symptoms at times, which is surprising since it is anexcellent antihistamine. Ranitidine (Zantac) 150 mg, from the Non-Rx OralMedication Module, may block the effects of scombroid poisoning; give two 150 mgtablets every 12 hours. While normally a prescription product at 300 mg dosageused to control stomach acid formation, ranitidine’s mode of action is known asa histamine-2 receptor blocker.PUFFER FISH POISONING [nav.xhtml#sub104]Incorrectly prepared puffer fish (fugu) contain tetrodotoxin, which can belethal as it leads to respiratory failure and cardiac collapse. Symptoms may beslow in onset. Provide CPR as necessary (see page 17 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_17]).Probably more people are killed by ingesting poisonous marine creatures than arekilled by any other type of encounter, such as trauma from biting, stinging, orshocking.PARALYTIC SHELLFISH POISONING [nav.xhtml#sub105]Mussels, clams, oysters, and scallops may ingest the poison saxitoxin fromdinoflagellates found in “red tide,” which occurs from June to October along theNew England and Pacific coasts. Numbness around the mouth may occur between 5and 30 minutes after eating. Other symptoms are similar to ciguatera poisoning(page 85 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_85]). These include gastrointestinal illness,loss of coordination, and paralysis progressing to complete respiratoryparalysis with 12 hours in 8% of cases. No specific treatments or antidotes areavailable, but purging of stomach contents should be encouraged. Artificialsupport of respiration is potentially lifesaving.MANAGING DIABETES [nav.xhtml#sub106]Diabetic children and adults can have an active off-grid life, but learning tocontrol their diabetes must first be worked on with their physicians. Theincreased caloric requirement of significant exercise may range above an extra2,000 calories per day, yet insulin dosage requirements may drop as much as 50%.The diabetic, as well as the trip partners, must be able to identify the signsof low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)—staggering gait, slurred speech, moist skin,clumsy movements—and know the proper treatment, for example, oral carbohydratesor sugar candies and, if the patient becomes unconscious, the use of injectableglucagon. The urine of diabetic outdoor travelers should be tested twice dailyto confirm control of sugar. This testing should preclude a gradual accumulationof too much blood sugar, which can result in unconsciousness in its advancedstage. This gradual accumulation would have resulted in massive sugar spill inthe urine and finally the spill of ketone bodies, providing the patient ampleopportunity to increase insulin dosage to prevent hyperglycemia (too high of ablood sugar level). Battery-powered, point-of-care blood sugar test devices(glucometers) must be included in the personal property of anyone takinginsulin.Storage of insulin off the grid, where it forgoes recommended refrigeration, isnot a major problem as long as the supply is fresh and direct sunlight andexcessive heat are avoided. Unopened insulin usually has an expiration date ofone year. With proper storage this might be extended several years, but there isan unknown finite point when it will not be viable. Biologicals such as insulinwill not have long, extended storage times. Syringes, alcohol prep pads,Keto-Diastix urine test strips, insulin, and glucagon are light additions to theOff-Grid Medical Kit. Persons who are insulin dependent will not be able tosurvive without grid contact. Adults whose diabetes started later in life mightdo adequately with oral medications, but they need to have an ideal body massindex and eat no more calories than they are expending. I recommend persons withdiabetes who experience elevating blood sugars should readily accept startinginsulin. Lifestyle changes, weight loss, and healthy diet choices might allowcontrol to be reestablished and diabetes medications reduced, or even stoppedaltogether. It is all a matter of results. Elevated blood sugars require moreaggressive medication management. But just because you start insulin does notmean you will always have to be on it. Start it sooner than later, and try tomodify your life so you can live without insulin. If the grid collapses, you mayhave to get by without it.WATER AND WASTE [nav.xhtml#sub27]ORAL FLUID REPLACEMENT THERAPY [nav.xhtml#sub108]Replacement of fluid loss is required for three different circumstances:diarrhea, heat stress sweat formation, and insensible moisture loss frombreathing and skin respiration (yes, skin must breathe also). The ideal fluidreplacement for each of these losses differs in electrolyte and sugar content.In general, diarrhea replacement fluids should not have a sugar content greaterthan 2.5%, as a higher concentration might cause additional diarrhea. (A highersugar concentration is not a problem in a person who is not ill.) Sweatreplacement solutions should not have a sugar concentration greater than 8.5%;this slows the emptying of the fluid from the stomach. The uptake of water bythe body is decreased, as this occurs in the intestines and not the stomach. Theideal electrolyte composition for these circumstances also differs dramatically.Profound diarrhea from any source may cause severe dehydration and electrolyteimbalance. The non-vomiting patient must receive adequate fluid replacement,equaling his stool loss plus about 2 liters (2 quarts) per day. For a couple ofdays, an adult can replace these losses by drinking enough plain water. A childor less healthy adult will require electrolyte replacement in addition to thewater. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the oralreplacement cocktails for fluid losses caused by profound diarrhea seen in table3-7. Drink alternately from each glass. Supplement with carbonated beverages, orwater and tea made with boiled or carbonated water as desired. Avoid solid foodsand milk until recovery.Throughout the world, the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund(UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO) distribute an electrolytereplacement product called Oralyte. It must be reconstituted with adequatelypurified water.If the patient is maintaining fluid balance with an effective oral rehydrationtherapy, such as with the packets as indicated above, the additional glass ofcarbonated or bicarbonate water is not necessary. Other products that areconsidered safe for rehydration due to diarrheal losses are NaturaLyte,Pedialyte, Enfalyte, and Pediatric. Gatorade is too high in carbohydrate and toolow in sodium, potassium, and base to be considered a safe substitute, even withmodification.Table 3-7. Oral Replacement Cocktails Prepare two separate glasses of thefollowing: Glass 1 Orange, apple, or other fruit juice (rich in potassium). . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 ounces Honey or corn syrup(glucose necessary for absorption of essential salts). . . . . . . . . . . . . ½teaspoon Salt, table (rich in sodium and chloride). . . . . . . . 1 pinch Glass2 Water (carbonated or boiled). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 ounces Soda,baking (sodium bicarbonate). . . . . . . ¼ teaspoonWATER PURIFICATION [nav.xhtml#sub109]Water can be purified adequately for drinking by mechanical, physical, andchemical means.The clearest water possible should be chosen or attempts made to clarify thewater prior to starting any disinfectant process. Water with high particulatecounts of clay or organic debris allows high bacterial counts and tends to bemore heavily contaminated. In preparing potable, or drinkable, water, we areattempting to lower the germ counts to the point that the body can defend itselfagainst the remaining numbers. We are not trying to produce sterile water; thatwould generally be impractical.The use of chlorine-based systems has been effectively used by municipal watersupply systems for years. There are two forms of chlorine readily available tothe outdoors traveler. One is liquid chlorine laundry bleach, and the other ishalazone tablets.Laundry bleach that is 4 to 6% sodium hypochlorite can make clear water safe todrink if 2 drops are added to 1 quart of water. Avoid brands of bleach thatcontain soap or surfactant. Mix this water thoroughly and let it stand for 30minutes before drinking. The resulting blend should have a slight chlorine odor.If not, the original laundry bleach may have lost some of its strength, and youshould repeat the dose and let it stand an additional 15 minutes prior todrinking.Halazone tablets from Abbott Laboratories are also effective. They are quitestable, with a shelf life of 5 years, even when occasionally exposed totemperatures over 100°F (38°C). Recent articles in outdoor literature havestated that halazone has a short shelf life and that it loses 75% of itsactivity when exposed to air for 2 days. Abbott Labs refutes this and has proventhe efficacy of halazone sufficiently to receive FDA approval. A clue to thestability of the tablets is that they turn yellow and have an objectionable odorwhen they decompose. Check for this before use. Add 5 tablets to a quart ofclear water for adequate chlorination.Chlorine-based systems are very effective against viruses and bacteria. Theywork best in neutral or slightly acid waters. As the active form of thechlorine, namely hypochlorous acid (HClO), readily reacts withnitrogen-containing compounds such as ammonia, high levels of organic debrisdecrease its effectiveness. The amount of chlorine bleach or halazone added mustbe increased if the water is alkaline or contaminated with organic debris.Iodine is a fairly effective agent against protozoan contamination such asGiardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica, both of which tend to be resistant tochlorine. Further, iodine is not as reactive to ammonia or other organic debris,thus working better in cloudy water. It is relatively ineffective againstcryptosporidia, which must be destroyed by either filtration or heat (see page92 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_92]). Tincture of iodine, as found in the home medicinechest, may be used as the source of the iodine. Using the commonly available 2%solution, 5 drops should be added to clear water or 10 drops to cloudy water,and the resultant mix should be allowed to stand 30 minutes prior to drinking.An elemental iodine concentration of 3 to 5 ppm (parts per million) is necessaryto kill amoeba and their cysts, algae, bacteria and their spores, andenterovirus. Crystals of iodine can also be used to prepare a saturated iodinewater solution for use in disinfecting drinking water. In a 1-ounce (30 ml)glass bottle, place 4 to 8 grams of USP-grade iodine crystals. Water added tothis bottle will dissolve varying amounts of iodine, based upon the watertemperature. This saturated iodine water solution is then added to a quart ofwater. The amount added to produce a final concentration of 4 ppm will varyaccording to temperature, as indicated in table 3-8.This water should be stored for 15 minutes before drinking. If the water isturbid or otherwise contaminated, the amounts of saturated iodine solutionindicated in table 3-8 should be doubled and the resultant water stored 20minutes before using. This product is now commercially available as Polar Purethrough many outdoor stores and catalog houses.Mechanical filtration methods are also useful in preparing drinking water. Theynormally consist of a screen with sizes down to 6 microns, which are useful inremoving tapeworm eggs (25 microns) or Giardia lamblia (7 to 15 microns). Thesescreens enclose an activated charcoal filter element, which removes manydisagreeable tastes. As most bacteria have a diameter smaller than 1 micron,bacteria and the even smaller viral species are not removed by filtration usingthese units. For water to be safe after using one of these devices, it must bepretreated with chlorine or iodine exactly as indicated above prior to passagethrough the device. While these filters remove clay and organic debris, theywill plug easily if the water is very turbid. A concern with the charcoal filterusage is that the filters may become contaminated with bacteria when they areused the next time. Pretreating the water helps prevent this. I have frequentlyused a charcoal filter system to ensure safe, good-tasting water after chemicaltreatment.Another filtration method is perhaps one of the oldest, namely filtering throughunglazed ceramic material. This was done in large crocks, a slow filtrationmethod popular in tropical countries many years ago. A modern version of thisold system is the development of a pressurized pump method. Made in Switzerland,the Katadyn Pocket filter has a ceramic core enclosed in a tough plastichousing, fitted with an aluminum pump. The built-in pump forces water throughthe ceramic filter at a rate of approximately 3/4 quart (750 ml) per minute.Turbid water will plug the filter, but a brush is provided to easily restorefull flow rates. This filter has a 0.2-micron size, which eliminates allbacteria and larger pathogens. Pretreating of the water is not required. Thereis evidence that viral particles are also killed by this unit, as the ceramicmaterial is silver-impregnated, which appears to denature viruses as they passthrough the filter. The European Union did not approve this claim; as a result,the manufacturer no longer makes this statement in their literature. I haveworked with many groups using this device, however, and they have had manyfavorable comments. These units are not cheap, costing about $370 retail. Theyweigh 23 ounces. There are several less expensive ceramic units now available,but be sure to pretreat the water chemically when using these systems, as theymay be ineffective against viral disease without the silver impregnation.Using the same technology as kidney dialysis systems, Sawyer Products produces amicrotubule filter with a 0.1-micron absolute size (see figure 3-3). Normally afilter with such a small diameter would be very difficult to pump water through,but the microtubules have an effective large surface area allowing one to suckwater or to gravity-feed water through the system easily. I prefer the Sawyerpersonal water bottle filter, as the oral opening is protected by a closing flapmechanism. In dusty areas, especially those with possible fecal contamination,such as trails in developing countries, this is ideal. Sawyer also makes anattachment using this filter system that screws into common commercialdisposable water bottles.If it not only removes particles but has an absorption mechanism to removechemicals, a quality water filter eliminates viruses and bacteria, as well asprotects against chemical contaminants and water-borne parasites. It may requireprefiltering to remove large particles, charcoal or similar filtering to removechemicals, and a microfilter to remove bacteria. Sawyer also produces amicrotubule system with an absolute pore size of 0.02 microns, thus alsoeffective against hepatitis C virus particles.SteriPEN and similar devices use ultraviolet C rays to kill viral, bacterial,and protozoan cysts. The water should be prefiltered if it is turbid, as shadowsfrom particles in the water potentially shield these germs from destruction. Ofcourse, agitation or swirling the wand in the water helps overcome this problem,and the light must stay on longer. Loss of battery power ends the device’susefulness.Another method of water purification has been with us a long time, namely usingour old friend fire. Bringing water to a boil will effectively kill pathogensand make water safe to drink. One reads variously to boil water 5, 10, or even20 minutes, but simply bringing the water temperature to 150°F (65.5°C) isadequate to kill the pathogens discussed above and all others besides. At highaltitude the boiling point of water is reduced. For example, at 25,000 feet(7,600 meters) the boiling point of water is 185°F (85°C). Bringing water to aboil is the minimal safe time for preparation. At times fuel or water may be inshort supply and this minimal time must be used.chpt_fig_008 [../Images/chpt_fig_008.jpg]Figure 3-3.Cutaway photograph of the Sawyer microtubule system. The microtubules are foldedinto the filter apparatus that effectively gives this filter a large surfacearea through which water can drain with minimal squeezing pressure or suckingvacuum.It will never be necessary to boil water longer than 5 minutes, and the shortesttime mentioned (just bringing the water to a boil) will suffice for a safedrinking water. This water will not be sterile, but it will be safe to drink.Water may be obtained by squeezing any freshwater fish and some plants. A solarstill can be prepared for reprocessing urine, water from debris, or any moistmaterial, as indicated in figure 3-4. In water-poor areas, catching rainwatermay be an essential part of routine survival. Be careful, however, of meltingice; treat all meltwater as indicated above. There is a very strong chance ofcontamination in ice deposits. Surprisingly, it is possible to survive quite along time drinking only urine. Seawater is problematic, as the surface water hasvarying amounts of salt concentrations, depending upon currents, melting ice,and even river influxes, which are sometimes hundreds of miles away.Table 3-8.

Unbelievablenumbers of people were killed. Even in our wilderness areas, it is widelyacknowledged that the cleanest-looking streams should still be suspected ofhuman or animal contamination.Most official campsites in the national park system have toilets. These shouldalways be used. Otherwise, human defecation should be buried at least 200 feet(60 meters) from a lakeshore or stream. Waste should be buried in a shallow pit,as this promotes rapid decomposition. Disinfecting waste by adding undilutedbleach or solid bleach powder is a viable alternative. In very dry and seldomtraveled areas, using the smear technique to dispose of feces is advocated. Insome ecosystems all solid waste, including feces, must be carried out. Generalguidelines are available for different ecosystems and various levels of humanusage. The Leave No Trace Foundation curriculum is taught by many outdoor groupsinterested in conservation."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 [nav.xhtml#ch04]RADIATION [nav.xhtml#ch04]Four possible events can trigger significant radiation exposure (beside naturalbackground and medical testing): 1. 1.Nuclear bomb 2. 2.Nuclear power plant disaster 3. 3.Terrorist dirty bomb 4. 4.Accident in transport or storage of nuclear materialWhen selecting a possible survival retreat, it should be possible to avoid beingat a ground-zero location for any of the above. The issue then becomes how tominimize the effects of radiation spreading from one of those locations. It isobvious that many metropolitan areas could be targets for intercontinentalballistic missile attack, and if they are, they would probably receive multiplehits due to redundant targeting. The locations of nuclear power plants arewell-known, and the greatest danger from them is a natural disaster that causesa plant malfunction, or terrorist destruction of an individual plant or massattack via hacking controls. We need to evaluate the extent of the plume danger,including its potential distance and contents, and develop strategies to counterthis danger. Bomb plumes are one thing; continuing plumes from a malfunctioningnuclear plant are another. A dirty bomb, consisting probably of an enrichednuclear material detonated by a conventional explosion, will have a differentisotope danger, with intense local long-lasting radiation, but a minimaldistance to its plume. Transport accidents will be localized along a rail orroad corridor, will have a specific isotope release, and will probably be anisolated incident that will bring the grid authorities scrambling to clean upand cordon off the area, with localized plume and runoff contamination fromsurface water.The isotope release and plume from nuclear bombs has been extensively studiedwith regard to bomb construction, yield, and burst height, including subsurface,ground, and water detonations. The lethality and injury estimates have also beenextensively predicted for various distances from ground zero for ground and airblasts of various yields from nuclear detonations.A nuclear device detonation releases 40 to 50% of its total energy as blastoverpressure, 30 to 40% as thermal heat radiation, 5% as ionizing radiation(more in a neutron bomb, which has much less blast energy), and 5 to 10% remainsas residual radiation.For those victims too close to ground zero, the rates of death and survivableinjuries will be related to blast and heat injury, but if we have chosen ourretreat location well, we will have avoided those immediate injuries, and theconcern for most preppers will be the immediate fallout radiation from the plumeand then managing long-term residual contamination. But if you are caught near adetonation location, the chance for survival increases dramatically by using the1950s technique of “duck and cover” immediately upon the bright light flash, bynot looking in the direction of the blast, and by sheltering. The shock wavewill cause immense physical damage directly and from flying debris. To surviveand minimize the blast energy and the thermal heat and to minimize the ionizingradiation, stay put in the nearest building for 2 to 24 hours. The length oftime to safely leave and evacuate depends upon the ionizing radiation releaseand the protective value of the shelter. During the height of the cold war,buildings were graded by a protective factor up to R20, the ideal protectivecovering for the ionizing radiation phase of the blast, but most buildingsprovide at least some protection, and one should evacuate to a more obviouslyprotective shelter only when the withering initial ionizing irradiation periodhas passed or decreased so that increasing one’s outside exposure briefly tomove to an R20 level building is worth it.There are different antidotes for the various isotopes, and length ofadministration depends upon exposure characteristics. We will focus onminimizing these dangers and radiation illness in this chapter.The topics we need to study therefore include the following: 1. 1.Units of radiation measurement 2. 2.Measuring and estimating safe exposure limits 3. 3.Neutralizing immediate fallout and decontamination of residual contamination 4. 4.Managing long-term radiation exposure 5. 5.Treating radiation sicknessIf someone is caught near a blast location, minimizing damage from overpressuretrauma, flying debris, direct radiation, and thermal burn must be done byfinding immediate physical barrier protection and, if wounded, treating burns(page 139 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_139]), orthopedic injuries (page 154[Chapter07.xhtml#page_154]), lacerations (page 116 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_116]),injury from foreign bodies (page 38 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_38]), and eye injuries(page 36 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_36]). Radiation sickness prevention and treatmentfollows.UNITS OF RADIATION MEASUREMENT [nav.xhtml#sub111]Roentgen is the unit of actual exposure, defined as ionizations per unit volumeof air (measured by Geiger counters and ionization chambers). The rad is theamount of radiation energy absorbed per unit of mass. Neutron radiation causesmore damage than gamma or X-ray radiation. A conversion is made by this degreeof damage to form a unit called the rem, or roentgen equivalent in humans. Theinternational system outside of the United States makes the followingsubstitution: Rad is replaced by the gray (Gy), and rem is replaced by thesievert (Sv).1 Gy = 100 rad1 Sv = 100 remThe quantity of radioactivity is expressed as the number of nucleardisintegrations per second. One disintegration per second is called 1 becquerel(Bq) in the international system. In the United States one curie is 37 billionBq.When describing X-ray, beta, or gamma radiation, the rad and rem (and Gy and Sv)are essentially the same.Ionizing radiation damage (the rem or Sv) is accumulative. When worncontinuously, dosimeters can provide insight into this accumulative dose or,with modern electronic systems, can indicate dose accumulations by various timeframes so that workers in radiation-exposed occupations can be kept below anacceptable accumulative risk (see figure 4-1). A Geiger counter measuresradioactive emissions, mostly beta and gamma rays, in becquerels, and can beused to identify points of contamination. Other devices can measure accumulatedor current dose, and identify the isotope source and type of radiation. Theeffect of radiation on people depends upon the intensity of the dose, howfocused it is, and the duration of exposure. A whole-body dose of 4.5 Gy (450rad) delivered in minutes to hours will cause significant illness and possibledeath, while 10 Gy (1,000 rad) delivered to a focused area over a long period oftime (such as in radiation therapy) might be well tolerated. Thus, while wetolerate easily a normal daily exposure of 0.6 rads, mild symptoms will occur ata sudden exposure to about 30 rads; between 30 and 200 rads, the person maybecome ill; from 200 to 1,000 rads the person will become seriously ill; andabove 1,000 rads the dose will be fatal.chpt_fig_010 [../Images/chpt_fig_010.jpg]Figure 4-1.Graphical Comparison of Electronic Personal Dosimeters Rate range (minimum andmaximum): The range of exposure rate that the product can measure within anaccuracy of ±30%. All quantities in this table are expressed in units ofRoentgen (i.e., of Milliroentgens per hour and Roentgens per hour) to simplifyproduct comparisons. Quantities have been converted by using the approximation 1R ≈ 1 rem ≈ 1 rad. Specifications in Sv were first multiplied by 100 to convertSv to rem. Note: 1,000 mR/h = 1 R/hSource: Radiation for Response and Recovery Market Survey Report. US Departmentof Homeland Security, June 2016.https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/(1)Radiation-Dosimeters-Response-Recovery-MSR_0616-508_0.pdf[https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/(1)Radiation-Dosimeters-Response-Recovery-MSR_0616-508_0.pdf].If people can protect themselves from the immediate irradiation from thedetonation, they next must deal with fallout and radiation from contamination,which may be external or internal.Severe local fallout, extending way beyond the blast and thermal effects, isincreased by larger yield and a near surface burst that will suck up vastamounts of particulate matter. This irradiated material starts to fall in adowndraft even as the cloud rises, but the obvious smaller particles form theclassic oval fallout pattern, mostly down-wind from the blast center.The low yield atomic (fission) bombs used in the Trinity (19 kt), Hiroshima(12.5 kt), and Nagasaki (2 kt) blasts did not produce sizable fallout. Thedamage was all due to blast and immediate radiation effects. Larger tests suchas those at the Bikini Atoll and virtually all of the Chinese above-ground testshave produced sizable fallout.The explosive energy of any fission bomb is about 90% of the actual total yield,leaving 10% as residual radiation composed mostly of fission products. A fusion(hydrogen) bomb will release 95% of its explosive energy. There are no knownbiological effects of the electromagnetic pulse generated by the bomb, but thiscan induce long cables to generate high voltages, destroy unshielded electronicdevices, and cause a short period of radio and radar blackout. Electronics canbe shielded by wrapping them completely in conductive materials such as aluminumfoil.With surface or near-surface bursts, the fission products of the bomb areincorporated into materials scoured from the earth. About 200 differentradioactive substances are formed by fission, with additional ones created byneutron irradiation of weapon parts, soil, and other material drafted into theexplosion. These materials will emit beta and gamma radiation with varioushalf-lives, meaning the length of radioactive decay and danger will differ. Muchof this is carried high into the atmosphere by large fireballs, with the falloutspreading in a downwind oval pattern. Leftover fissionable material from thebomb will be negligible and found only in the immediate vicinity of the blastdowndraft where harm from the heat and previous blast effect will be of muchgreater concern. A homemade dirty bomb, simply a conventional explosion ofradioactive material, will have a very dirty immediate-vicinity effect but aminimal plume. In a large, properly detonated nuclear bomb, there is noimmediate vicinity left.Even hundreds of bombs going off in Europe, Asia, and North America will not bethe end of the world. A 5-megaton bomb surface burst would carry aloft about 2million tons of other materials in the stem and mushroom cloud. The materialthat returns to earth over the next ten years is almost entirely soil with aconcentration of radioactive material of less than one-tenth part per million.Surviving the blast, our job as survivalists is to make sure we increase ourchances of dealing with fallout, and here is how we will do it.An accurate estimator of radioactive decay of mixed fission products is the“7-10 rule.” Radiation intensity will decrease tenfold for each sevenfoldpassage of time. In other words, fallout radiation measured 4 hours after theblast will be one-tenth that reading at 28 hours after the blast. The fissionradiation is a component of initial radiation during the first minute. At onehour after the blast, the radioactivity of the fission-product mixture is about125 times less than it was at one minute.The heavier particles that fall to the earth in a manner of hours contain mostof the radioactivity produced by the explosion, but luckily much of this islocked within glassy particles, shielding or containerizing some of theradiation.A peak dose of 0.5 R/hr, the accepted level above which a fallout threat isrecognized, extends from a distance of 210 to 310 miles downwind from this5-megaton bomb surface burst (a very dirty explosion with the most immediatelydangerous fallout) with a 15 mph wind (figure 4-2).chpt_fig_0011 [../Images/chpt_fig_011.jpg]Figure 4-2.Peak Dose-Rate Pattern (5 MT surface burst)Source: DCPA Attack Environmental Manual, chapter 6 [Chapter06.xhtml], panel 11.Defense Civil Preparedness Agency, US Department of Defense, June 1973.https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=34719[https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=34719].The protection factor is the degree of decreasing radiation exposure offered byvarious substances and buildings. Figure 4-3 illustrates the various levels ofprotection within a metropolitan building.And why is this important?chpt_fig_012 [../Images/chpt_fig_012.jpg]Figure 4-3.Levels of ProtectionNote: Areas near windows and at street level have less protection than innerareas; even basements of frame houses provide between 10 and 20 protectionfactor (PF). This means that a twentyfold decrease in radiation from outsideexposure would be encountered in that position. It is not hard to develop asimple construction that can increase the PF to 100, even higher (see chapter 6[Chapter06.xhtml], DCPA Attack Environmental Manual, Defense Civil PreparednessAgency, US Dept. of Defense, June 1973). Single- story homes with averagebasement wall exposure aboveground of less than 2 feet will provide PF 20throughout the basement. Homes with two or more stories and a basement with nomore than 2 feet exposure will provide at least PF 40 throughout the basement.Source: DCPA Attack Environmental Manual, chap. 6, panel 18.

As can be seen, the damage fromradiation is sustained by both the rate at which exposure occurs and the totalaccumulative dose.Table 4-2. Doses at 30 Miles Downwind 5-MT surface burst; 15 MPH wind Time InOpen In Shelter 46 In Shelter 76 1 Week 11,400 248 150 1 Month 13,500 294 178 4Months 15,000 326 197The shelter with a 46 protective factor shows the one-week calculated dose to be248 R, just short of the 250 R shown in the dose-penalty table, so few if anydeaths would be expected. At one month the dose would be 294 R and that personwould have 56 R “to spare.” Since the dose outside would be nearly 2 R/hour atone month, not much time could be spent outside without exceeding the body’srepair capability (see table 4-2). In certain circumstances, it might be wiserto use the “spare” dose during the second week to move out of the heavy falloutarea. If equipped with measuring equipment one could calculate the real exposurerisks allowing for safer evacuation timing. Improve the protective factor of thelocation by preventing dust from settling inside or rinsing it away. Removingdust-covered clothing and footwear and rinsing dust from the skin and hair willreduce this radiation by 90%. Dust will accumulate beneath belts and waistbands,neck and shirt openings, and on foot-wear and exposed skin anywhere. Removingthis dust reduces the radiation by another 5%.Beta burns occur only if fallout is deposited on skin during the first day ortwo following detonation; otherwise the decay of this form of radiation is sorapid as not to cause issues. These beta burns would appear about 2 weeks afterthe exposure and will generally heal well when treated as described on page 139[Chapter06.xhtml#page_139] (burn care).Of the many residual radioactive components of fallout from a nuclear blast, themost serious are radioactive iodine (131I), strontium (89 Sr, 90Sr), and cesium(137Cs). Due to its short half-life, radioactive iodine could exist as a hazardfor at most a month. It is particularly hazardous to children whose thyroid ismuch more vulnerable to this exposure than in adults. Radioactive iodine is amajor concern of nuclear power plant meltdowns due to the ease by which iodinevaporizes and can escape the reactor and auxiliary buildings, unlike themajority of the other heavier isotopes that remained primarily contained, unlikewith a bomb. (See https://www.nap.edu/read/10868/[https://www.nap.edu/read/10868/], especially Appendix B for a full isotopehazard list).DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF RADIATION EXPOSURE AND ILLNESS [nav.xhtml#sub112]Clearance of iodine is age dependent and proceeds based upon two biologicalhalf-lives: one of 6 hours (elimination of the whole body fraction, about 70%)and one of 100 days (elimination of the thyroid fraction, about 30%); 80% ofthis excretion is via urine. As of 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO)states that risk over 1 cGy (1 rad) is appropriate to initiate iodine blockingtreatment, while the FDA feels it should be 5 cGy (5 rad) from their evaluationof the Chernobyl data. Treatment of radioactive iodine exposure consists ofloading the thyroid with stable iodine as quickly as possible.WHO’s recommended dose is 130 mg of potassium iodide, 65 mg for children ages 3to 12 years (FDA states 65 mg for allschool-age children), 25 mg for infants andchildren ages 1 month to 3 years, and 12.5 mg for neonates from birth to 1month. If using iodine-potassium iodide solution (Lugol’s solution) 1%, adultsneed 80 drops, children 3 to 12 require 40 drops, children less than 3 years olduse 20 drops. The highest priorities for treating are newborn babies,breastfeeding mothers, and children. Dosing before the exposure (immediatelyafter the incident and prior to the arrival of the radioactive contamination)does the most good. A single administration of stable iodine is usuallysufficient.Treatment more than 24 hours after exposure may do more harm than good byprolonging the excretion of the radioactive iodine already absorbed by thethyroid. Similarly, continued dosing does less good than an adequate dosepre-exposure (before the plume hits), as a fully saturated thyroid will notabsorb much additional iodine unless a very large additional supply is offeredto it. And even that additional supply of protective iodine will dislodge whatis already there and sweep some of the radioactive material in with it. Iodinetransfer into the thyroid takes place via complex sodium/iodine sym-porters, ortransmembrane glycoproteins that act as a carrier, transporting the iodineacross the basolateral membrane of the thyroid. The rare exception to requiringadditional iodine would be in the case of continuous high-iodine plume exposurefrom a melting reactor (not bombs during the first few days of attack)—anunlikely scenario that would have to find you just sitting there, notevacuating, and one causing much more difficulty than radioactive iodineisotopes, requiring emergency evacuation regardless. You do not need aprescription to obtain potassium iodide pills (sold under brands names suchIostat, ThyroSafe, ThyroShield), but please note the dosing I discussed asopposed to what you read in much of the prepper literature. Also, the storagelife is virtually unlimited, not 5 to 7 years.Ingestion or inhalation of particulate fallout material is particularlydifficult to treat, so masks sufficient to filter out fine dust during thefallout plume phase are essential, even wads of cloth wrapped around the face asnecessary.Insoluble Prussian blue is a compound that can remove radioactive cesium andthallium from the body, effectively reducing the biological half-life by bindingto these compounds and allowing them to be defecated. Take 3 grams by mouth 3times a day for 30 days (minimal dose). The total duration of therapy wouldideally depend upon measuring residual radiation. It is important to be on ahigh-fiber diet to prevent constipation while on this product, and the tabletscan be taken with food. It can also lead to low potassium levels.Tritium (radioactive hydrogen) is removed internally by increasing the intake ofwater, 3 to 4 liters per day. This can reduce the effective half-life from 10days to 2.4 days, and the increased water intake does not need to extend beyonda week. See page 258 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_258] about the issue regardingoverhydration and hyponatremia.Uranium is chemically toxic to the kidney by itself, but when irradiated, theradiation risk prevails. Uranium speeds through the body fairly quickly, andthis can be increased by the use of sodium bicarbonate, 2 tablets every 4 hoursuntil the urine reaches a pH between 8 and 9, or one acetazolamide 250 mgtablet. Urine pH can be evaluated by common urine test strips, or simply givethese tablets every 4 hours for 2 days.GI tract contamination for americium (241Am), cobalt (57,59,60Co), plutonium(238,239,249Pu), and polonium (210Po) is complementarily treated with aluminumhydroxide 10 mL with 1.2 g, 60 to 100 mL orally or barium sulphate 100 to 300 gin a single oral dose in 250 mL of water.Strontium (85,89,90Sr) requires very rapid early treatment with ammoniumchloride 0.5 g, 4 tablets every 8 hours. Ten grams of magnesium sulfate speedsup digestive tract transit and reduces absorption. Radioactive barium andcalcium are striated similarly, with immediate blockage of absorption andinducing diarrhea to prevent absorption of ingested particles.The above are adjunctive treatments for decontamination, but additionalintravenous medications would normally be given also, such as trisodium calciumdiethylenetriamine-pentaacetate (Ca-DTPA) in advanced treatment centers.Obviously, anyone with access to professional help during a nuclear emergencywould seek it, but the above synopsis of decontamination techniques—of which themost important is the replacement of clothing, the washing of hair and exposedskin and to take actions to prevent inhalation and ingestion of radioactiveparticles and gas—may be all that a prepper has available.When suspecting contamination, the entire body should be surveyed using a thinwindow Gieger-Müller probe attached to a survey meter. Lacking any of theappropriate equipment, the prepper may have to evaluate the amount of illness bypatient symptoms.There are several symptom phases possible. An exposure range of 1 to 2 Gy (100to 200 rad) may have nausea and vomiting onset within 2 to 6 hours, which lastsless than 1 day, no diarrhea, slight headache, no fever, maybe some fatigue andweakness. An onset to vomiting of 1 to 2 hours will occur in 50 to 100% ofpeople exposed to 2 to 6 Gy, and it will last 24 to 48 hours; they may developbruises and hemorrhage and infection about 3 weeks after exposure. Exposure to 3Gy will result in hair loss in about 3 weeks. While death may occur in 5 to 50%of these people within 4 to 6 weeks, this means that most in this exposure rangewill survive. Above 5 Gy (500 rad) of sudden exposure, survival without advancedcare to provide white cell stimulation medications and appropriate IV fluids isunlikely.Then what do you do? You return to the basics of what we always do in a remotearea, practicing medicine in an austere environment. It’s basically down tosupportive care.Nausea/vomiting/gastritis treatment as per protocols, see page 70[Chapter03.xhtml#page_70].Diarrhea as per protocols, see page 72 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_72].Fever as per protocols, see page 29 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_29].Even when developing these symptoms, including infections from temporarysuppression of the white blood cell counts, these people may survive for manyyears in good health once through this rough beginning. Receiving advancedmedical care, including injections of medications that stimulate bloodformation, would, of course, be performed in advanced treatment centers. As withany terrible tragedy, the focus is on supportive care, not making things worse,and not giving up."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 [nav.xhtml#ch05]DENTAL CARE [nav.xhtml#ch05]If your potential time off the grid may be substantial, then planning for dentalemergencies is critical. Keep preventative dental care up to date. Then when offthe grid, brush twice daily. If you run out of toothpaste, use baking soda orsalt as a substitute. Flossing and brushing can prevent needless pain andsuffering.GUM PAIN OR SWELLING [nav.xhtml#sub113]Pain with swelling high on the gum at the base of the tooth usually indicates aninfection and a tooth that may require extraction, or root canal therapy, if adentist can be consulted who has brought a lot more than just his fly rod withhim on the trip. Attempting to treat without either option, have the patient usewarm-water mouth rinses. Start the victim on antibiotics as indicated in theprevious section. If a bulging area can be identified in the mouth, an incisioninto the swollen gum made with a sharp blade may promote drainage. If the painis severe and not relieved with any pain medication that you have, the tooth mayhave to be pulled.Swelling at the gum line, rather than at the base of the tooth, may indicate aperiodontal abscess. The gingiva (or gum) is red, swollen, foul smelling, andoozing. Frequently this represents food particle entrapment and abscessformation along the surface of the tooth and the gums, the so-called gingivalcuff. Considerable relief can often be obtained by probing directly into theabscess area through the gingival cuff using any thin, blunt instrument. Probealong the length of the tooth to break up and drain the abscess. Have thepatient use frequent hot-water mouth rinses to continue the drainage process. Ifa foreign object, such as a piece of food, is causing the swelling, irrigatewith a warm salt solution or warm water, using sufficient force to dislodge theparticle. Probe it loose if necessary. Dental floss may be very helpful. Acutepain and swelling of the tissue behind the third molar usually is caused by anerupting wisdom tooth; technically this is called pericoronitis. A little flapof tissue called the operculum lies over the erupting wisdom tooth, and bitingon this causes it to swell, and it becomes much easier to bite on it again andagain. The result is considerable pain. This can be relieved by surgicallyremoving the operculum. If local anesthetic is available, such as lidocaine,inject it directly into the operculum, and then cut it out with a sharp bladeusing the outline of the erupting tooth as a guideline. The bleeding can soon bestopped by biting down on a gauze or other cloth after the procedure is over.Stitching this wound is not required. If no lidocaine is available, swab thearea with alcohol, as this helps provide some slight anesthesia. Application ofpowder from a crushed diphenhydramine tablet from the Non-Rx Oral MedicationModule might provide some anesthesia.Swelling of the entire side of the face will occur with dental infections thatspread. This condition should ideally be treated in a hospital with intravenousantibiotics. In the bush apply warm compresses to the face. Do not lance theinfection from the skin side, but a peaked, bulging area on the inside of themouth may be lanced to promote drainage. Abscess extension into surroundingfacial tissues generally means that lancing will do little good. This patient isvery ill and rest is mandatory. Provide antibiotic coverage from the RxOral/Topical Medication Module, with levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, Zithromaxas indicated on page 285 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_285], or, from the Rx InjectableMedication Module, Rocephin, giving 500 mg by intramuscular injection every 12hours. Urgent evacuation is mandatory.MOUTH LACERATIONS [nav.xhtml#sub114]Any significant trauma to the mouth causes considerable bleeding and concern.The bleeding initially always seems worse than it is. Rinse the mouth with warmwater to clear away the clots so that you can identify the source of thebleeding.Laceration of the piece of tissue that seems to join the bottom lip or upper lipto the gum line, called the labial frenum, is a common result of trauma to themouth and need not be repaired, even though it initially looks horrible and maybleed considerably. Simply stuff some gauze into the area until the bleedingstops.A laceration of the tongue will not require stitching (suturing) unless an edgeis deeply involved. Fairly deep cuts along the top surface and the bottom can beignored when off the grid. If suturing is to be accomplished and you haveinjectable lidocaine from the Rx Injectable Medication Module, inject into thelower gum behind the teeth on the side of the gum facing the tongue. Technicallythis area is called the median raphe distal to the posterior teeth. This willblock the side of the tongue and be much less painful than directly injectinginto the tongue. Use the 3-0 gut sutures. These sutures will dissolve within afew days. Sutures in the tongue frequently come out within a few hours, evenwhen they are well tied, much to the victim’s and surgeon’s annoyance. If thishappens and the tongue is not bleeding badly, just leave it alone. Minor cutsalong the edge of the tongue can also be ignored.Make sure that cuts on the inside of the mouth do not have foreign bodies, suchas pieces of tooth, inside of them. These must be removed. Inject a small amountof lidocaine into the wound before probing if you have the Rx InjectableMedication Module, then irrigate thoroughly with water. Even without thelidocaine, the inside of the mouth can be stitched with minimal pain. Use the3-0 gut sutures, removing them in 4 days if they have not fallen out already.Refer to page 130 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_130] for discussion of suturing the faceand the outside portion of the lips.DENTAL PAIN [nav.xhtml#sub115]Cavities may be identified by visual examination of the mouth in most cases. Attimes the pain is so severe that the patient cannot tell exactly which tooth isthe offender. It helps to know that a painful tooth will not refer pain to theopposite side of the mouth and painful back teeth normally do not refer pain tofront teeth and vice versa. With the painful area narrowed down, look for anobvious cavity. If none is found, tap each tooth in turn until the offending oneis reached—a tap on it will elicit strong pain.For years, oil of cloves, or eugenol, has been used to deaden dental pain. Avoidtrying to apply an aspirin directly to a painful tooth; it will only make aworse mess of things. Many excellent dental kits that contain topical anestheticagents and temporary fillings are now available without prescription. A daub oftopical anesthetic will work. In your Topical Bandaging Module, you have tripleantibiotic with pramoxine that you can use. It’s the pramoxine component thatprovides the pain relief. Before applying the anesthetic, dry the tooth and tryto clean out any cavity you may find. From the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module,give Percogesic, 2 tablets every 4 hours, or ibuprofen, 200 mg, 2 to 4 tabletsevery 6 hours, for pain. When off the grid and a toothache begins, I would alsostart treating with an antibiotic if the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module isavailable. While not the first choice usually in civilization, use Levaquin, 500mg once daily, until swelling or pain resolves, which indicates the infection isunder control.LOST FILLING [nav.xhtml#sub116]This could turn into a real disaster. An old-fashioned remedy uses powdered zincoxide (not the ointment) and eugenol. Start with the two in equal parts and mixuntil a putty is formed by adding more zinc oxide powder as necessary. Thisalways takes considerably more of the zinc oxide than at first would seemnecessary. Pack this putty into the cavity and allow it to set over the next 24hours.The Cavit dental filling paste in the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module providesa strong temporary filling. Dry the cavity bed thoroughly with a gauze square.Place several drops of anesthetic, such as oil of cloves (eugenol), to deadenthe nerve endings and kill bacteria.The triple antibiotic with pramoxine ointment from the Non-Rx Oral MedicationModule can also be used for this purpose (plain triple antibiotic ointment willnot work). You will have to pack the ointment into the cavity area and allow itto melt. Dry the cavity carefully once again. The Cavit paste should be appliedto the dry cavity and packed firmly into place. Obviously avoid biting on theside of the filling, regardless of the materials used to make your temporaryfilling. The loss of a filling may indicate extension of decay in the underlyingtooth and an underlying cavity.CAVITY [nav.xhtml#sub117]In the event a tooth becomes painful, you may note the formation of a cavity.While in normal dental practice the cavity area would be drilled out, in yoursituation off the grid, you may be able to handle this problem quite wellwithout drilling. Using a dental spoon, you can scrape the edges of the decayarea clean. Be careful not to go too deep as you will hit the nerve in the pulpat the core of the tooth. As long as you seal the area with your filling, youshould prevent further decay. Of course, if an abscess has formed, it is toolate to fill the tooth and it should be extracted. Fill with a temporary fillingas mentioned above under lost filling. A more permanent filling can be achievedwith a glass ionomer compound (an Rx item in the US that requires mixing justbefore using, it hardens to an appropriate stiffness) or something like PrevestDenPro’s Fusion Flo nano hybrid composite, which is available without aprescription but requires an ultraviolet light to cure or harden it; the UVsource can be a blue cobalt penlight.When placing a permanent filling, you have to be particular about yourtechnique. After scraping the decay out of the cavity, dry out the hole or thecement will not stick. Practice with the cement to achieve the right consistencyprior to inserting it or in managing the UV light to harden the material when itis in place. If the cavity extends to the side of the tooth, protect the spacebetween the teeth by placing something thin between them, such as a tooth from acomb. It is also critical to remove extra cement from around the tooth and frombetween the tooth, and to make sure that the filling does not extend so highthat the tooth biting down on it comes into contact with the filling.An excellent description of performing this procedure using the glass ionomer isfound in Where There Is No Dentist by Murray Dickson (2018). You will find itmuch easier to use the UV-cured nano hybrid. You can purchase a simple dentaltool kit online, in addition to any of the products previously mentioned in thissection.LOOSE OR DISLODGED TOOTH [nav.xhtml#sub118]When you examine a traumatized mouth and find a tooth that is rotated ordislocated in any direction, do not push the tooth back into place. Furthermovement may disrupt the tooth’s blood and nerve supply. If the tooth is at allsecure, leave it alone. The musculature of the lips and tongue will generallygently push the tooth back into place and keep it there.A fractured tooth with an exposed pink substance that is bleeding is showing theexposed nerve. This tooth will need protection with eugenol and temporaryfilling as indicated above. This is actually a dental emergency that should betreated by a dentist immediately.If a tooth is knocked out, replace it into the socket immediately. If thiscannot be done, have the victim hold the tooth under their tongue or in theirlower lip until it can be implanted. In any case, speed is a matter of greatimportance. A tooth left out too long will be rejected by the body as a foreignsubstance.All of the above problems mean a soft diet and avoidance of chewing with theaffected tooth for many days will be necessary. Off the grid, start the patienton an antibiotic such as doxycycline, 100 mg daily, for any of the aboveproblems.Trauma that can cause any of the above may also result in fractures of the toothbelow the gum line and of the alveolar ridge affecting several teeth. If this issuspected, start the patient on an antibiotic as mentioned in the paragraphabove. Oral surgical help must be obtained as soon as possible. A soft diet isessential until healing takes place, possibly a matter of 6 to 8 weeks.PULLING A TOOTH [nav.xhtml#sub119]It is best not to pull a tooth from an infected gum, as this might spread theinfection. If an abscess is forming, place the patient on an antibiotic such asLevaquin, 500 mg daily, or doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, and use warm-watermouth rinses to promote drainage. After the infection has subsided, it is saferto pull the tooth. Opening the abscess as described under Gum Pain or Swelling(page 109 [Chapter05.xhtml#page_109]) will be helpful at times. If it appearsnecessary to pull an infected tooth, give the patient an antibiotic pill about 2hours before pulling the tooth to provide some protection against spreading theinfection.Pull a tooth by obtaining a secure hold with either a dental forceps or, evenbetter, a side-cutting bone rongeur. You will have to obtain one from a surgicalsupply house or a friendly orthopedic surgeon. Slowly apply pressure in aback-and-forth, side-to-side motion to rock the tooth free. This loosens thetooth in its socket and will permit its removal. Avoid jerking or pulling thetooth with a straight outward force; it can resist all of the strength that youhave in this direction. Jerking may break off the root. The rongeur will gripthe tooth surface by cutting into the enamel, holding better than even dentalextraction forceps. The Murray Dickson book described above also indicates analternative method of dental extraction using different equipment.If the root breaks off, you may leave it alone rather than trying to dig it out.If the root section is obviously loose, then you can pick it out with a suitableinstrument. Thin fragments of bone may fracture off during the extraction. Thesewill work their way to the surface during healing. Do not attempt to replacethem, but pick them free as they surface.If you do not have the side-cutting dental rongeur or dental forceps, it is bestnot to attempt to pull the tooth with another instrument. Pliers may crush thetooth and the tooth can slip in your grasp. However, even a large, solid toothcan be removed by using your finger to rock it back and forth. This may takedays to accomplish, but it will eventually loosen sufficiently to remove."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 [nav.xhtml#ch06]SOFT TISSUE CARE AND TRAUMA MANAGEMENT [nav.xhtml#ch06]Probably no issue will distress the prepper more than worrying about managingwounds—and with good reason.

Off the grid it will be very appropriate for the party to provide its owndefinitive care.STOP THE BLEEDING [nav.xhtml#sub121]Wound care, whether on or off grid, can be broken into chronological phases. Thefirst phase consists of saving the victim’s life—by stopping the bleeding andtreating for shock. Even if the victim is not bleeding, you will want to treatfor shock. Shock has many medical definitions, but bottom line, it amounts to aninadequate oxygenated blood supply getting to the brain. Lie the patient down,elevate feet above the head, and provide protection from the environment—fromboth the ground and the atmosphere. Grab anything that you can find for this atfirst—use jackets, pack frames, unrolled tents, whatever. Eventually you will beable to pitch a tent, put up a rain fly or sun shield, and prepare materials forfurther wound care. (See also Shock, page 13 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_13].)Direct pressure is the best method to stop bleeding. In fact, pressure alone canstop bleeding from some amputated limbs! When the accident first occurs, you mayeven have to use your bare hand to stem the flow of blood. Ideally, you willhave something to protect yourself from direct contact with blood and to protectthe wound from your dirty hand. The best item to carry would be a pair ofnitrile gloves. These can withstand long-term storage, as well as heat and cold,better than latex gloves. In their absence, grab a piece of cloth (bandanna,clothing article) or other barrier substance (plastic food wrapper) and press.My book Basic Illustrated Wilderness First Aid, 2nd edition (Falcon Guide, 2016)describes the various glove materials and their suitability for long-termstorage. In general, nitrile gloves will prove to be the best solution.Control of blood loss is a priority. This makes the “tourniquet first” approachappropriate if blood loss cannot be controlled by direct pressure on anextremity wound. The military has approved two commercial strap andwindlass-style tourniquets: the Combat Action Tourniquet (CAT) and the SpecialOperations Forces Tactical Tour-niquet Wide (SOFTT-W).The Special Operations Forces Tactical Tourniquet Wide (SOFTT-W) pictured infigure 6-1a is the latest model, specially constructed to give a true 1½-inchcircumference without pinching when tightened using the windlass.Due to the interest in the national “Stop the Bleed” awareness programsprecipitated in the United States by active shooter incidents, the American RedCross is also co-marketing the SOFT-T tourniquet.Once applied, keep the tourniquet in place until definitive care has beenreached. A careful exception might be made for a remote situation. To quote fromthe current Boy Scouts of America Wilderness First Aid (BSA WFA) doctrine:> In a very remote area where care might not be reached for days, continuous> application will result in loss of the limb. It is more important to save a> life than a limb. In all situations, it is better to apply a tourniquet prior> to seeing the signs and symptoms of shock. A rule of thumb is to leave a> tourniquet on an extremity with severe arterial bleeding, not venous bleeding,> no longer than 2 hours, and attempt to transition to wound packing and a> pressure dressing to control severe bleeding. If a tourniquet is left on an> extremity longer than 6 hours then it is recommended to leave on until> definitive care can be reached.

Since theaddition of Combat Gauze (ZMedica LLC, Wallingford, CT, USA; www.quikclot.com[http://www.quikclot.com]) in April 2008 to the Tactical Combat Casualty Care(TCCC) guidelines, based on recent analyses of battlefield results in hemostaticdressings used in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as other special operationscombat areas, Celox Gauze (Medtrade Products Ltd., Crewe, UK;www.celoxmedical.com [http://www.celoxmedical.com]) and ChitoGauze (HemConMedical Technologies, Portland, OR, USA; www.tricolbiomedical.com[http://www.tricolbiomedical.com]) have been added. To use, place the gauze onthe wound on top of the bleeding vessel—not on top of other bandage material.Direct pressure must be applied continuously for a minimum of 5 minutes or asper the manufacturer’s recommendation.If direct pressure does not stop the bleeding, immediately apply a tourniquet.Extensive military experience has indicated that even temporary removal of atourniquet results in a higher loss of life. Additionally, placement of aneffective tourniquet can be difficult. Ineffective placement allows continuedbleeding. Continue applying direct pressure while the tourniquet is on tofacilitate the clotting process. If an inadequate result is obtained,immediately place a second tourniquet about an inch proximal from the first one.If the patient has lost a massive amount of blood, do not attempt to remove thetourniquet. Sometimes bleeding control with direct pressure may require hours ofdirect pressure, but this is unusual.There are three main lessons to remember concerning a tourniquet: First,applying it sooner rather than later is critical; if bleeding is not controlledby pressure on an extremity, apply the tourniquet immediately. Second, a widetourniquet is better than a narrow one. Third, don’t remove the tourniquet.Improvising an adequate tourniquet is difficult to achieve. Belts seldom work;cords and surgical tubing will not adequately stop bleeding, and an appropriatefastening technique is not easy to maintain. The minimum width for a tourniquetis 11/2 inches. Tie a short stick or another rigid object into the tourniquetmaterial to create a wind-lass technique and twist it, tightening the tourniquetuntil bleeding stops—and no more. Attach the stick to the windlass byincorporating it into the knot and fasten one end of the windlass when it hasbeen adequately tightened by tying a square knot over it and the limb.In areas where a tourniquet cannot be applied, plunge two fingers into thebleeding wound. This always stops bleeding and works anywhere on the body, shyof a massive explosive injury. Use your index and middle finger held together.This is the technique used over and over again during surgery when somethingcuts loose and blood wells up in the surgical field.A third technique is an internal pressure packing using a moist piece of sterileor clean cloth. Wet the cloth with sterile or at least drinkable water, wringingit out until it’s practically dry. Then stuff this cloth into the wound firmly,continuing to pack more cloth into the wound until the bleeding is stopped bythe tamponade, or compression. If bleeding continues, do not remove thematerial, but firmly stuff in more. Cover this dressing with a dry, clean cloth.It should be replaced in 24 hours.With the bleeding stopped, even using your hand, and the victim on the ground inthe shock treatment position, the actual emergency is over. Her life is safe.And you have bought time to gather together various items you need to performthe definitive job of caring for this wound. You have also treated forpsychogenic shock—the shock of fear.In the first aid management of this wound, the next step is simply bandaging andthen transporting the victim to professional medical care. For those who areisolated and must provide long-term care for wounds, further management will gothrough several more phases: cleaning, closing, dressing, and treating thepossible complications of infection.CLEAN THE WOUND [nav.xhtml#sub122]Adequate cleansing is the most important aspect of wound management. Especiallywhen in an isolated or survival situation, the prevention of infection is ofcritical importance and can only be assured by aggressive irrigation techniques.There is an adage in nature: “The solution to pollution is dilution.” In woundcare this means copious irrigation. The whole purpose of scrubbing a wound is toreduce the total number of potentially harmful bacteria. You won’t get ’em allout, but if the total number is sufficiently small, the body’s own defensemechanisms can take over and finish the job for the patient.To best provide water for irrigation, prepare sterile water. This can be done byboiling the water for 5 minutes. Lacking the ability to do that, try to usewater that is fit for drinking (see page 89 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_89]–94[Chapter03.xhtml#page_94] for techniques of water purification). In a pinch,clean water from a stream or lake can be used as long as you are not downstreamfrom the sewage pipe of a third-world village, or the bloated, rotting carcassof a moose.To provide adequate force to the irrigation stream, there are two items ofpotential importance. One is the bulb syringe (see figure 6-2). The 1-ouncemodel is adequate for most wounds. The other approach is to use a syringe (10 to35 ml size) with a device attached called a Zerowet Supershield (see figure6-3). With either technique one can increase the velocity of the water to aid indislodging debris and those all-important germs.Forceful water irrigation is the mainstay of wound cleaning. The use of a botabag, a squeezable plastic water cube, or simply a ziplock plastic bag with asmall hole poked in it to bring a stream of water to the wound is very helpful,but the stream generated using them is not fully adequate to provide theirrigation force required. Adding mild surgical scrub solution to the initialbatch of irrigation water is a good step but does not make up for the lack ofadequate forceful irrigation. Adding mechanical abrasion can be helpful andprobably is the only hope of adequate wound cleansing. Several products can beparticularly useful for this technique. The most effective is Hibiclens surgicalscrub. Another is povidone iodine (Betadine) diluted to a 1% solution (the stocksolution is 10%). Another approach is to use a very dilute soap solution. Err onthe side of making the soap solution too weak, because strong soap solutions candamage healthy tissue. Make the solution weak enough that you could drink itwithout purging yourself.Many cleaning techniques and compounds should not be used: Tincture of iodine,Mercurochrome, and alcohol are very harsh, and hydrogen peroxide destroys goodflesh as well as germs. Red-hot branding irons and pouring gun powder into awound and lighting it, while effective in killing germs and among Rambo’sfavorite techniques, also destroy good tissue. And destroyed tissue is notsomething you want when you are off the grid.When stuck with a weak irrigation stream, perhaps being able to pour water intothe wound only from a container, the mechanical abrasion technique saves theday. Besides irrigation, a technique of cleaning used by physicians in theoperating room is called debridement. This amounts to cutting away destroyedtissue. Of course, there is no way a person can do this in the bush—especiallywith inadequate lighting, equipment, and training. But we can safely approximateit by vigorously rubbing the area with a piece of sterile gauze or clean cloth.The rigorous scrubbing action will remove blood clots, torn bits of tissue,pieces of foreign bodies—all items that generally result in higher bacteriacounts or foci for bacterial growth. This scrubbing process has to beaccomplished quickly—it is painful and the victim will not tolerate it for long.Have everything ready: clean, dry dressing to apply afterward; the water supply;an instrument to spread the wound open (a pair of tweezers or the needle holderare ideal); and sterile gauze to use for scrubbing this wound.To sterilize cloth and any instruments, boil for 5 minutes, if necessary in thewater you are preparing to use for irrigation. While having adequate steriledressings would be ideal, you may find yourself slicing and dicing your woolshirt or Polarguard jacket into bandaging material. A rough cloth works betterat wound cleaning than a smooth cloth, such as cotton.Once everything is ready and assistance is at hand (perhaps someone to squirtthe jet of water into the wound and another to assist shooing the black fliesaway or comforting the victim), go to it! If this job is performed well, thefinal outcome will be great. This part of wound care is far more important thanwound closure technique. It will be messy. And it will hurt. But spread thewound apart, blast that water in there the best you can, and scrub briskly withthe gauze pad. This whole process will have to be completed in 20 to 30 seconds.In the operating room, or under local anesthesia in the emergency room, we mighttake 15 minutes or longer. You won’t be able to take that much time, but youmust be thorough and vigorous. You should use at least 1 cup of water for a verysmall wound and 1 quart (1 liter) for most other wounds. When in doubt, domore—if the patient can tolerate it within reason.Once the irrigation is completed, the wound will bleed vigorously again, sincethe blood clots were knocked off during the cleansing process. Apply a steriledressing and use direct pressure as long as necessary to stop bleeding; 5 to 10minutes usually suffice, but if an hour or more is required, keep at it or usethe pressure dressing technique described above. If you fail to adequately cleana wound, the resulting infection could cost the patient his life. It wouldsimply be a slower and more painful demise than bleeding to death.chpt_fig_016 [../Images/chpt_fig_016.jpg]Figure 6-2.The irrigating bulb syringechpt_fig_017 [../Images/chpt_fig_017.jpg]Figure 6-3.The Zerowet Splashield attached to a syringeANTIBIOTIC GUIDELINES [nav.xhtml#sub123]It is always tempting to place a person on antibiotics after a laceration, but Iwould advise against doing this unless the wound was from an animal or humanbite (see pages 143 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_143]–144 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_144]),the wound occurred in contaminated water, or there was an open fracture (seepage 163 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_163]). Bacteria are jealous creatures and do notlike to share their food source with other species. If an infection develops, itwill generally be a pure culture, the other species originally contaminating thewound having been killed off by the body’s defense mechanisms and the winningbacterium. If the patient is on an antibiotic from the beginning, the winningbacterium is guaranteed to resist your medication. If no antibiotic is usedinitially, there is hope that the emergent bacterium will be sensitive to theantibiotic that you are about to employ.If it is necessary to start a prophylactic antibiotic, from the Rx Oral/TopicalMedication Module use Levaquin, 500 mg once daily for 3 days. In case ofinfection, see page 147 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_147].WOUND CLOSURE TECHNIQUES [nav.xhtml#sub124]With direct pressure still applied, dry around the wound. We are now ready toenter the wound-closure phase of wound care. Perhaps more worry and concernexist about this phase of wound care than the others, but it is really theeasiest—and much less important than the first two phases just discussed.TAPE CLOSURE TECHNIQUES [nav.xhtml#sub125]If the laceration can be held together with tape, then by all means use tape asthe definitive treatment. Butterfly bandages are universally available andgenerally work very well. The commercial butterflies are superior to homemade inthat they are packaged sterile with a no-stick center portion. They can be madein the field by cutting and folding in the center edges to cover the adhesive inthe very center of short tape strips, thus avoiding adhesive contact with thewound. Of course, such homemade strips will not be sterile, but in general theywill be very adequate. Steri-Strips and their generic equivalents are nowcommercially available in neighborhood pharmacies. The ideal wound closures,they are lightweight, inexpensive, and easy to apply.When using a tape method of closure, adhere the strips next to each other toopposite sides of the wound, then use them to pull the wound together as youproceed down the wound length, closing it as you go. Even with very sticky tape,there may be times when they cannot hold a wound closed and the wound will haveto be stapled or sutured (stitched).STAPLING [nav.xhtml#sub126]A fast, strong method of holding skin edges together is with the use ofstainless-steel staples. A special disposable device will contain a certainnumber of sterile staples that rapidly staple the wound edges while pinching thewound together. This obviously stings while being used, but the pain is briefand the wound is securely closed. A very useful device is the Precise Five-ShotSkin Stapler by 3M, which obviously contains five staples. A special disposablestaple remover is very handy for removing staples virtually painlessly. The skinstapler and staple remover are nonprescription and shown in figure 6-4. Theycome packaged in sterile, waterproof containers.chpt_fig_018 [../Images/chpt_fig_018.jpg]Figure 6-4.The 3M Precise Five-Shot Skin Stapler and its companion staple extraction deviceSUTURING [nav.xhtml#sub127]Suture (stitching) material is available in many forms and with many types ofneedles. For the expedition medical kit, I would recommend using 3-0 nylonsuture with a curved pre-attached needle, shown in figure 6-5. This comes in asterile packet ready for use. It will be necessary to use a needle holder toproperly hold the suture. The needle holder looks like a pair of scissors, butit has a flat surface with grooves that grab the needle and a lock device thatholds the needle firmly. Hold it as illustrated to steady the hand. Allfly-tying stores sell needle holders.Apply pressure in the direction of the needle, twisting your wrist in such amanner that the needle will pass directly into the skin and cleanly penetrate,following through with the motion to allow the needle to curve through thesubcutaneous tissue and sweep upward and through the skin on the other side ofthe wound; see figure 6-6.chpt_fig_019 [../Images/chpt_fig_019.jpg]Figure 6-5.Grasping the needle holder; this technique decreases hand tremor.chpt_fig_020 [../Images/chpt_fig_020.jpg]Figure 6-6.Proper placement of suture, showing passage of the suture material at an equaldepth on both sides of the cutchpt_fig_021 [../Images/chpt_fig_021.jpg]Figure 6-7.Improper placement of suture, showing that different depths of penetrationresult in tissue puckeringDEPTH OF SUTURESSuture through the skin surface only and avoid important structures underneath.If tendon or nerve damage has occurred, irrigate the wound thoroughly asdescribed previously under “Clean the Wound” and repair the skin either withtape or sutures as necessary. The tendon or other structures can be repaired bya surgeon upon return to the outside—weeks later if necessary.It is important to have the needle enter both sides of the wound at the samedepth or the wound will not pull together evenly, and there will be a pucker ifthe needle took a deep bite on one side and a shallow bite on the other; seefigure 6-7.A square knot is tied with the use of the needle holder in a very easy manner,as in figure 6-8. Frankly, a knot tied in any fashion will do perfectly well.chpt_fig_022 [../Images/chpt_fig_022.jpg]Figure 6-8. How to tie a square knotLoop the suture around the needle holder once, using the long end of the thread.Grasp the short end and pull the wound together.Loop the long end around the needle holder again the opposite way. This willform a square knot.Repeat this process a third time in the original direction to ensure a firmknot. Do not pull too tightly, as this will pucker the skin; just anapproximation is required.SPACING OF STAPLES AND SUTURESThe stitches should not be placed too closely together. Usually, on the limbsand body, 4 stitches per inch will suffice. On the face, however, use 6 perinch; here it is best to use 5-0 nylon, as it will minimize scar formation fromthe needle and suture. I use a 6-0 suture on the face, but it is considerablymore difficult to use than the 5-0.These stitches can be combined with tape strips or butterfly bandages to helphold the wound together and to cut down on the number of stitches required.Once they are in, leave stitches in the limbs for 10 days, in the trunk andscalp for 7 days, and in the face for 4 days. A wound that tends to break opendue to tension, such as over the knee, can be stabilized by splinting the jointso that it cannot move while the wound is healing.SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS [nav.xhtml#sub128]SHAVING THE WOUND AREA [nav.xhtml#sub129]It has been found that shaving an area actually increases the chance of woundinfection. Scalp lacerations are hard to suture when unshaven due to the mattingof hair with blood and accidental incorporation of hair into the wound. However,catching hair in the wound is not detrimental. Just pull it loose from the woundwith a pair of forceps or tweezers when you are through suturing.BLEEDING FROM SUTURE OR STAPLE USE [nav.xhtml#sub130]You will note that entrance and exit points of the needle puncture anywhere onthe body will bleed quite freely. A little pressure always stops the bleeding—itis not necessary to delay your sewing to even worry about it. Just completestitching the wound, then apply pressure until the bleeding from the needlepunctures stops, cleanse the skin when you are done to remove dried blood, anddress the wound.SCALP WOUNDS [nav.xhtml#sub131]Scalp wounds bleed excessively—expect this. Spurting blood vessels can beclamped with the needle holder and tied off with a piece of the 3-0 gut suturefrom the Topical Bandaging Module. To tie, simply place a knot in the flesh tofall beneath the tip of the needle holder. Someone may have to remove the needleholder while you are cinching the first loop of the knot. Or you may simplysuture the scalp wound closed and apply pressure between each suture to minimizeintraoperative bleeding. Apply firm direct pressure after suturing to minimizehematoma (blood pocket formation) from bleeding within the wound.I have read many times that a scalp laceration can be closed by tying the hairon either side into a knot, thus holding the wound together. I have sutured alot of scalp lacerations, and I doubt this technique would work very well. Ascalp laceration bleeds so profusely, blood is so sticky and slippery at thesame time, and the hair would have to be long enough and of the right texture.See the discussion on head injuries on page 165 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_165].EYEBROW AND LIP CLOSURE [nav.xhtml#sub132]If sewing an eyebrow or the vermilion border of the lip, approximate the edgesfirst with a suture before sewing the ends or other portion of the laceration.Never shave an eyebrow. Use 5-0 nylon suture on the face and remove thesesutures in 4 days, replacing them with strips of tape at that time.MOUTH AND TONGUE LACERATIONS [nav.xhtml#sub133]When sewing the inside of the mouth, use the 3-0 gut suture. These sutures tendto unwind very easily, especially if the patient cannot resist touching themwith his tongue. When making the knot, tie it over and over. The mouth healsrapidly, and even if the sutures come out within a day, the laceration hasgenerally stopped bleeding and may heal without further help. These mouthsutures will generally dissolve on their own, but any remaining ones can beremoved within 4 days.Lacerations on the tongue can almost always be left alone. The wound may appearugly for a few days, but within a week or two there will be remarkable healing.Infections in the tongue or mouth from cuts are very rare. If the edge of thetongue is badly lacerated, so that the tongue is cut one-quarter of the wayacross or more, sewing the edge together is warranted. Use the 3-0 gut suture.CONTROL OF PAIN [nav.xhtml#sub134]For anesthesia you will require a prescription to obtain injectable lidocaine 1%and a syringe with needle. Inject into the wound, just under the skin on bothsides of the cut. Cleansing and suturing soon after a cut may help minimize thepain, due to tissue “shock” in the immediate post-trauma period. Ice applied tothe wound area can help numb the pain, but local topical anesthetic agents areof no help in pain control. Two Percogesic or 2 or 3 ibuprofen, 200 mg, givenabout 1 hour prior to surgery may help minimize pain.DRESSINGS [nav.xhtml#sub135]Most sutured lacerations leak a little blood during the first 24 hours.Increased pain or apparent swelling is a reason to remove the dressing to checkfor signs of infection (see page 147 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_147]). The dressingshould be removed, and replaced, when it is time to remove staples or sutures asindicated above. When using a hydrogel dressing system, it is not necessary toremove the dressing, as it facilitates more rapid healing and providesprotection from the environment while in place. There are many brands of thesedressings at local drug stores. Look for a bandage that has a gel padconstruction.Alternative dressings in the Topical Bandaging Module are the Nu Gauze pads andthe Tegaderm and Spenco 2nd Skin dressings. An initial covering that can soak upleaking wounds is the Nu Gauze pad. After the wound becomes dry, the Tegadermdressing will keep the sutures visible and the wound protected even if it mustbe submersed in water. Wounds that continue to leak considerable serum and/orblood should be covered by Spenco 2nd Skin and managed as discussed above.OTHER TYPES OF WOUNDS [nav.xhtml#sub31]ABRASIONS [nav.xhtml#sub137]An abrasion is the loss of surface skin due to a scraping injury. The besttreatment is cleansing with Hibiclens surgical scrub, application of tripleantibiotic ointment, and the use of gel pad dressing, all components of theTopical Bandaging Module. This type of wound leaks profusely, but the abovebandaging allows rapid healing, excellent protection, and considerable painrelief. Avoid the use of alcohol on these wounds as it tends to damage thetissue, to say nothing of causing excessive pain. Lacking first aid supplies,cleanse the wound gently with mild detergent and protect it from dirt, bugs, andother contaminants the best that you can. Tetanus immunization should have beenwithin 10 years; see discussion in chapter 9 [Chapter09.xhtml].A significant question on the mind of the victim and the medic is howaggressively ground-in cinder and dirt should be removed from a road rash.Having raced bicycles for several years on a cinder track (Indiana University’sLittle 500), I have had personal experience with this—which perhaps clouds myperspective. Before I raced, I aggressively cleaned these wounds with a wirebrush. During my racing years my approach changed to simply coating the woundwith a layer of the antibiotic ointment and allowing the resultant scabformation to lift the cinders out of the wound when it fell off. A recentpublication has shown that antibiotic salve, if applied within 3 hours of asurface wound, significantly decreases wound infection in animal studies. I havenot experienced problems with cinder tattoos or wound infection using a gentlescrub (e.g., Hibiclens) with a soft cloth, removing deeply embedded debriscarefully with tweezers, and liberally coating triple antibiotic ointment,reapplied daily or as necessary until the wound heals. I like to avoid abandage, leaving the wound open to the air, or using a gel pad dressing when acovering is required over the ointment.PUNCTURE WOUNDS [nav.xhtml#sub138]Briefly allow a puncture wound to bleed, thus hoping to effect some irrigationof bacteria from the wound. Cleanse the wound area with surgical scrub or soapywater and apply triple antibiotic ointment to the surrounding skin surface. Donot tape it shut, but rather apply a warm compress for 20 minutes every 2 hoursfor the next 1 to 2 days, or until it is apparent that no subsurface infectionhas started. These soaks should be as warm as the patient can tolerate withoutdanger of burning the skin. Larger pieces of cloth, such as undershirts, workbest for compresses, as they hold the heat longer. Infection can be prevented ortreated with antibiotics as described in the section on cellulitis (page 148[Chapter06.xhtml#page_148]). Dress with a clean cloth. If sterile items are inshort supply, they need not be used on this type of wound. Tetanus immunizationshould be current (see chapter 9 [Chapter09.xhtml]).SPLINTER REMOVAL [nav.xhtml#sub139]Wash the wound with Hibiclens surgical scrub or another solution that does notdiscolor the skin. Minute splinters are hard to see. If the splinter is shallow,or the point buried, use a sharp blade to tease the tissue over the splinter toremove this top layer. The splinter can then be pried out more easily.It is best to be aggressive in removing this top layer and obtaining asubstantial bite on the splinter with the tweezers, rather than nibbling off theend when making futile attempts to remove it with inadequate exposure. Whenusing tweezers, grasp the instrument between the thumb and forefinger, restingthe instrument on the middle finger and further resting the entire hand againstthe victim’s skin, if necessary, to prevent tremor. Approach the splinter fromthe side, if exposed, grasping it as low as possible; see figure 6-9. Applytriple antibiotic ointment after removal.chpt_fig_023 [../Images/chpt_fig_023.jpg]Figure 6-9.Hold tweezers parallel to the skin surface and grasp only after obtainingadequate exposure of the splinter.Tetanus immunization should be current (see chapter 9 [Chapter09.xhtml]). If thewound was dirty, scrub it afterward with Hibiclens or soapy water. If deep,treat as indicated above for Puncture Wounds, with hot soaks and antibiotics.FISHHOOK REMOVAL [nav.xhtml#sub140]The first aid approach to an impaled fishhook is to tape it in place and not tryto remove it if there is any danger of causing damage to nearby or underlyingstructures, or if the patient is uncooperative. Cut the fish line off the hook.Destroy triple hooks, but do not cut the hook close to the skin with your wirecutters. This makes subsequent manipulation by the surgeon more difficult.Anyone fishing with barbed hooks needs to include side-cutting wire cutters intheir tackle equipment.If you will be more than 2 days from help, it is important to remove any impaledobject, including a fishhook, as such objects are a high risk for infection.And, since fishhooks are relatively easy to remove anyway, you may wish to do ityourself to prevent a long trip back to town and the doctor’s waiting room.There are three basic methods for removing a fishhook, which I refer to as “thegood, the bad, and the ugly” techniques. I will let you decide which is which:Push through, snip off method: While the technique seems straight forward,consider a few points: 1. Pushing the hook should not endanger underlying or adjacent structures. This limits the technique’s usefulness, but it frequently is still an easy, quick method to employ. 2. Skin is not easy to push through; it is very elastic and will tent up over the barb as you try. Place the side-cutting wire cutters, with jaws spread apart, over the point on the surface where you expect the hook point to punch through to hold the skin down while the barbed point punches to the surface. 3. This is a painful process and skin hurts when being poked from the bottom up, as much as from the top down. Once committed, finish the push-through portion of this technique as quickly as you can. 4. This adds a second puncture wound to the victim’s anatomy. Cleanse the skin at the anticipated penetration site before shoving the hook through, using soap or a surgical scrub. 5. When snipping off the protruding point, cover the wound area with your free hand to protect yourself and others from the flying hook point. Otherwise you may need to refer to the section on removing foreign bodies from the eye on page 38 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_38].The steps are simple: 1. Push the hook through. 2. Snip it off. 3. Back the barbless hook out. 4. Treat the puncture wounds. If you do not have wire cutters, you may still use this technique, but be able to crush the barb flat enough that you will be able to back the hook out.The string jerk method: This is the most elegant of the methods.Fingers are loaded with fibrous tissue that tends to hinder a smooth hookremoval. This technique works best for the back of the head, the shoulder, andmost aspects of the torso, arms, and legs. It is highly useful and can bevirtually painless, causing minimal trauma.See figure 6-10: (A) Loop a line, such as the fish line, around the hook,ensuring that this line is held flush against the skin. Pushing down on the eyeportion of the hook helps disengage the hook barb, so that the quick pull (B)will jerk the hook free with minimal trauma. Many times a victim will ask, “Whenare you going to pull it out?” after the job has been completed.chpt_fig_024 [../Images/chpt_fig_024.jpg]chpt_fig_025 [../Images/chpt_fig_025.jpg]Figure 6-10.Press the shank of the hook against the skin surface. Vigorously jerk the hookalong the skin surface.The dissection method: At times it just seems we are not as lucky, and we mustresort to what will probably be a difficult experience for the victim andsurgeon alike.This is the case with embedded triple hooks, a hook near the eye, or othersituations when the above methods cannot be used. No person in his right mindwould attempt this on his own if evacuation to a physician’s office was at allpossible. It is tedious and, without a local anesthetic, such as injectablelidocaine, extremely painful.The technique employs the use of either a sharp, thin blade or an 18-gauge orlarger bore hypodermic needle. Examine a hook similar to the one that isembedded in the victim to note the bend in the shank and the location of thebarb. You will need to slide the blade along the hook shank, cutting the strandsof connective tissue so that the hook can be backed out. If using the needle,you will have to slide it along the hook and attempt to cover the barb with ahollow tube, thus shielding connective tissue strands from the barb, allowingthe hook to be similarly backed out. This is an elegant method and can result inminimal tissue damage, with only the entry hole left. But it can take time and,without local anesthesia, the victim has to be stoic. If available, inject alittle 1% lidocaine from the Rx Injectable Medication Module. Practice thistechnique using a piece of closed-cell foam sleeping pad, rather than humanskin, prior to your trip in the bush.FRICTION BLISTERS [nav.xhtml#sub141]Blisters can be prevented if immediate care is taken of any hot spot as soon asit develops. Generally, a simple piece of tape placed directly over the hot spotwill eliminate any friction causing the problem. An easily obtainable substancehas revolutionized the prevention and care of friction blisters: Spenco 2ndSkin, available at most athletic supply and drug stores. Made from an inert,breathable gel consisting of 4% polyethylene oxide and 96% water, it has thefeel and consistency of, well, most people would say, snot. It comes invarious-size sheets and is sterile and sealed in watertight packages. It is verycool to the touch; in fact, large sheets are sold to cover infants to reduce afever. Three valuable properties make it so useful: It will remove all frictionbetween two moving surfaces (hence its use in prevention); it cleans anddeodorizes wounds by absorbing blood, serum, or pus; and its cooling effect isvery soothing, which aids in pain relief.2nd Skin comes between two sheets of cellophane. It must be held against thewound, and for that purpose the same company produces an adhesive knit bandage.For prevention, 2nd Skin can be applied with the cellophane attached and securedwith the knit bandaging. For treatment of a hot spot, remove the cellophane fromone side and apply this gooey side against the wound, again securing it with theknit bandaging.If a friction blister has developed, it will have to be lanced. Cleanse it withsoap or surgical scrub and open it along an edge with a sharp blade. There is noadvantage to making a small hole as opposed to a wide incision. Allow the skincovering to collapse by expressing the fluid, and then apply a fully strippedpiece of 2nd Skin. This is best done by removing the cellophane from one side,then applying it to the wound. Once it adheres to the skin surface, remove thecellophane from the outside edge. Over this you will need to place the adhesiveknit. The bandage must be kept moist with clean water. The 2nd Skin should bereplaced daily. If the skin cover is still covering the wound, it should be cutoff after 2 days, as the skin underneath is now less raw and the dead skin willstart to decompose. Until you use it on a friction blister, you’ll find it hardto believe how well 2nd Skin works!It makes good sense to coat all open blisters with triple antibiotic ointment.This acts as a barrier to prevent infection.The old blister-care technique using rings of moleskin is seldom effective.Moleskin should be relegated to the dark ages of medicine. But it is cheap, andfor that reason most commercial first aid kits include it rather than Spenco 2ndSkin.THERMAL BURNS [nav.xhtml#sub142]As soon as possible remove the source of the burn. Quick immersion into coolwater will help eliminate additional heat from scalding water or burning fuelsand clothing. Do not overcool the victim and cause hypothermia. If water is notavailable, suffocate the flames with clothing, sand, or other flame suffocatingmateria. Do not allow a victim to panic and run, as this will fan the flames andincrease the injury.Treatment of burns depends upon the extent (percent of the body covered) and theseverity (degree) of the injury. The percent of the body covered is estimated byreferring to the “rule of nines,” as indicated in figure 6-11. An entire armequals 9% of the body surface area; therefore, the burn of just one side of theforearm would equal about 2%. The chest and back equal 18%, and the abdomen andback equal 18%. The proportions are slightly different for small children, thehead representing a larger percentage (18%) and the legs a smaller percentage(13.5%). Severity of burns is indicated by degree. First degree (superficial)will be red, dry, and painful. Second degree (partial skin thickness) will bemoist and painful, and have blister formation with reddened bases. Third degree(deep) involves the full thickness of the skin and extends into the subcutaneoustissue with char, loss of tissue, or discoloration.For purposes of field management, victims can be divided into three groupsdepending upon a combination of the extent and severity of the burn.First-degree burns, regardless of the extent, rarely require evacuation. Thesevere pain initially encountered in a first-degree burn usually disappearswithin 24 hours. The patient’s requirement for pain medication can range fromibuprofen, 200 mg, 4 tablets every 4 to 6 hours, to Percogesic, 2 tablets every3 to 4 hours. After a few doses, further pain medication is generally notrequired. Surface dressings are not indicated, but soothing relief of smallburns can be obtained by either applying a Spenco 2nd Skin dressing or a dampcloth.chpt_fig_026 [../Images/chpt_fig_026.jpg]Figure 6-11.The “rule of nines” burn chart helps determine the percentage of a body coveredby burns. Note the differences between an adult and an infant.Second-degree burns covering less than 15% and third-degree burns covering lessthan 10% of the body surface area do not require rapid evacuation, but theyshould receive professional care. Provide pain medication as above. Cleanse thearea with either a gently applied surgical scrub or nonmedicated soap. Do notattempt to remove debris that is stuck to the burn site. Gently pat it dry. Thegeneral consensus is to remove skin from blisters that have ruptured or that areblood filled. I find it best to initially leave the skin covering the blister,removing it after 3 days. People generally feel better when you open turgidblisters with a long cut using a sharp blade. Apply Spenco 2nd Skin dressing andchange it twice daily. Second-degree burns will slough off the skin after 3 to 4days. An unopened or covered blister surface will turn white in 3 days, andfrequently an ooze of pus may develop in the underlying blister fluid. If theunderlying skin does not become red and swollen, this is a normal development.White, moist, dead skin should be cut away. If you have no ointment ordressings, leave a second-or third-degree burn alone. The surface of theblister, if it is drained, will dry out and slough off on its own. Either way,healing will take place in 2 weeks or less for a second-degree burn. Athird-degree burn greater than 1/2 square inch will require a skin graft toheal. Red swollen skin under and around the burn site probably indicates aninfection. If this develops, provide antibiotics from the Rx Oral/TopicalMedication Module, such as Levaquin, 500 mg once daily, or from the RxInjectable Module give Rocephin, 500 mg by intramuscular injection twice daily.Elevate the burned area to minimize the swelling.A third-degree burn greater than 10% and second-degree burn greater than 15% ofthe total body surface area, any serious burn to the face, and any third-degreeburn of hands, feet, or genitals require urgent evacuation of the patient. Woundmanagement is the least important part of the care of these patients. Burnwounds are sterile for the first 24 to 48 hours. Burn management is aimed atkeeping the wound clean, reducing pain, and treating for shock.An important aspect of treating for shock will be maintaining adequate fluidreplacement. Generally patients with less than 20% of their body surface areaburned can tolerate oral fluids very well. If they are not vomiting, those withbetween 20 and 30% of their body surface area involved can be resuscitated bydrinking adequate fluids. This individual will be prone to go into shock. If thevictim is vomiting, he will fall behind in fluid replacement.The replacement fluid should initially consist of Gatorade diluted 1:1 withwater, or a mixture consisting of ⅓ teaspoon salt and ⅓ teaspoon baking soda in1 quart (1 liter) of flavored, lightly sweetened water. Avoid the use ofpotassium-rich solutions (orange juice, apple juice), as serum potassium canrise to high levels during the first 24 hours. During the second day the oralfluids should be diluted Gatorade and lightly sweetened, flavored water (such asWyler’s dried fruit crystals or dilute Tang). Push as much fluid during these 2days as the patient can tolerate without becoming nauseous. Attempt to keepurine flow at 1⅔ to 3⅓ ounces (50 to 100 ml) per hour. Nausea can be suppressedwith adequate pain management and the use of Atarax, 25 to 50 mg every 6 hours,from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module, or Vistaril, 25 to 50 mg byintramuscular injection every 4 hours as needed, from the Rx Injectable Module.Pain relief will require Nubain, 10 to 20 mg intramuscular, the nasally inhaledStadol (see page 289 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_289]), or the oral medications astolerated. Patients who lapse into a coma during the first 48 hours will requireintravenous fluids to save their lives. Physicians equipped with IV fluids areaware of the massive doses that are required to succeed at this point.Starting on the third day, the patient should be given a moderately highcarbohydrate diet, rich in protein. Approximately 200 mg of vitamin C andsubstantial vitamin-B complex should be started daily. This would equal about 4each One-A-Day multiple vitamin (Miles Laboratories) or equivalent. Continue topush fluids.Spenco 2nd Skin is the ideal dressing for these severe burns. It provides abreathable cover that is sterile and will exclude bacteria from the environment.It is also easily removed with whirlpool or gentle cleansing. Otherwise, apply atopical dressing such as triple antibiotic ointment. Occlusive dressings mustnot be used. The ointment may be placed on thick gauze dressings that are thenheld against the wound with a single layer of gauze roll dressing. The woundshould be cleaned daily, removing obviously dead tissue. This can be done withgentle scraping using a sterile gauze and clean water with a little Hibiclenssurgical scrub added, about 30 minutes after proper pain medication has beenprovided. Lacking Hibiclens, use a very dilute soap solution. Elevate the burnedarea, if practical. Have the victim gently and regularly move the burned area asmuch as possible to minimize contraction of burn tissue across joints. This willbe a concern only with long-term care lasting many weeks.Avoid the use of oral or injectable antibiotics to prevent wound infection. Ifyou suspect an infection has developed because the underlying tissue is becomingred and swollen, red streaks are traveling from the burn toward the heart, orthe burn was grossly contaminated (such as from an explosion), use antibioticsas described above.HUMAN BITES [nav.xhtml#sub143]Unless group discipline has really degenerated, human bites are due to accidentssuch as falling and puncturing flesh with teeth. Bites within the victim’s ownmouth seldom become infected and are discussed in the section on mouthlacerations (see page 110 [Chapter05.xhtml#page_110]). Human bites to any otherlocation of the body have the highest infection rate of any wound. Scrubvigorously with Hibiclens surgical scrub, soapy water, or any other antisepticthat you can find. Pick out broken teeth or other debris. Coat the wound areawith triple antibiotic ointment. Start the application of hot, wet compresses asdescribed under Puncture Wounds (page 133 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_133]). Startantibiotics with Rocephin, 500 mg IM every 12 hours, or from the Rx Oral/TopicalModule use Levaquin, 500 mg once daily. Bite wounds to the hand are extremelyserious and should be seen by a qualified hand surgeon as soon as possible.ANIMAL BITES [nav.xhtml#sub144]Animal bites tend to be either tearing or crushing injuries. Animal bitelacerations must be vigorously cleaned, but hot soaks need not be startedinitially. Some authorities state that bite lacerations should not be taped orsutured closed due to an increased incidence of wound infection. This has notbeen my personal experience, nor that of many ER physicians with whom I havediscussed this problem. After vigorous wound cleansing I would close gapingwounds as described under Wound Closure Techniques (page 126[Chapter06.xhtml#page_126]). Only gaping wounds should be closed—not puncturewounds. Start antibiotic coverage immediately, as described in the precedingsection on human bites.The massive lacerations from a large animal bite, such as bear or puma injuries,are another matter. The entire goal of treatment is to stop the bleeding, treatfor shock, and evacuate. You may need to close these massive lacerations to helpcontrol bleeding.If an infection seems to start, treat as indicated in the section on woundinfection (page 147 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_147]) by removing the closures andstarting hot soaks and antibiotics.Treat crush injuries with cold packs and compressive dressings. Largelacerations can also be treated with compressive dressings. The ideal item wouldbe a 6-inch elastic bandage. Cold sources can be chemical cold packs or thecoldest water available, safely packaged in poly bottles or similar containers.Refer to Rabies, page 233 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_233].FINGER AND TOE PROBLEMS [nav.xhtml#sub145]INGROWN NAIL [nav.xhtml#sub146]This painful infection along the edge of a nail can, at times, be relieved withwarm soaks. There are several maneuvers that can hasten healing, however. Onetechnique is a taping procedure, shown in figure 6-12. A piece of strong tape(such as waterproof tape) is taped to the inflamed skin edge next to—but nottouching—the nail. The tape is fastened tightly to this skin edge with gentlebut firm pressure. By running the tape under the toe or finger, the skin edgecan be tugged away from the painful nail and thus relieve the pressure.Another method is to shave the top of the nail by scraping it with a sharp bladeuntil it is thin enough that it buckles upward. This “breaks the arch” of thenail and allows the ingrown edge to be forced out of the inflamed groove alongthe side.chpt_fig_027 [../Images/chpt_fig_027.jpg]Figure 6-12.Apply tape to the skin edge next to the nail and tug the skin away from thenail, fastening the tape down under the toe or finger.The above techniques should be implemented at the first sign of irritationrather than once infection has developed, though even then they are effective.Provide antibiotics such as doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, or Levaquin, 500 mgonce daily.PARONYCHIA (NAIL BASE INFECTION) [nav.xhtml#sub147]Paronychia, an infection of the nail base, is a very painful condition thatshould initially be treated with warm soaks, 15 minutes every 2 hours, and theuse of oral antibiotics such as doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, or Levaquin,500 mg daily. Oral pain medication will also be necessary. If the lesion doesnot respond within 2 days, or if it seems to be getting dramatically worse, anaggressive incision with a sharp blade will be necessary, as shown in figure6-13. This wound will bleed freely; allow it to do so. Change bandages asnecessary, and continue the soaks and medications as described under Abscess(page 147 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_147]).chpt_fig_028 [../Images/chpt_fig_028.jpg]Figure 6-13.Paronychia, showing the incision required to drain the abscessFELON [nav.xhtml#sub148]A deep infection of a fingertip is called a felon. It results in a tense, tenderfinger pad. Soaking a felon prior to surgery, unlike other infections, does nothelp and only increases the pain. Treatment is effected by a very aggressiveincision, called a fish-mouth incision, made along the tip of the finger fromone side to the other and extending deep to the bone; see figure 6-14.chpt_fig_029 [../Images/chpt_fig_029.jpg]Figure 6-14.Felon, showing the incision required to drain the abscessAn alternate incision is a through-and-through stab wound going under the fingerbone, from one side to the other. A gauze or sterile plastic strip is theninserted through the wound to promote drainage of the pus from the felon.The pain is severe and not helped by local injection of lidocaine. But relief isquick as pressure from the pus buildup is alleviated. Allow this wound to bleedfreely. Soak in warm water for 15 minutes every 2 hours until drainage ceases(about 3 days). Give pain medication about 1 hour prior to your surgicalprocedure, using the strongest that you have in your kit. Simultaneously startthe victim on an antibiotic such as Levaquin, 500 mg once daily; doxycycline,100 mg twice daily; or Rocephin, 500 mg IM twice daily.BLOOD UNDER THE NAIL [nav.xhtml#sub149]Blood under a fingernail or toenail, called subungual hematoma, is generallycaused by a blow to the digit involved. The accumulation of blood under a nailcan be very painful. Relieve this pressure by twirling the sharp point of ablade through the nail (using the lightest pressure possible) until a hole isproduced and draining effected. This is a painless procedure and the tip of theblade should not enter the nail bed, only the pocket of blood under the nail.Soak in cool water to promote continual drainage of this blood. The finger maystill hurt from the contusion, however, so additional pain treatment withPercogesic, 1 or 2 tablets every 4 hours, or Norco 10/325, 1 tablet every 4 to 6hours, may also be useful. Antibiotic use is not necessary.WOUND INFECTION AND INFLAMMATION [nav.xhtml#sub150]Lacerations that have been cleaned and either sutured, taped, or stapledtogether will generally become slightly inflamed. Inflammation is part of thehealing process and does not indicate infection, yet the appearance is similar;it’s a matter of degree. Inflammation has slight swelling and red color. Thehallmarks of infection are swelling, warmth to touch, reddish color, and pain.Pus oozing out of a wound is another clue. If the cut has a red swelling thatextends beyond 1/4 inch from the wound edge, infection has probably started.The method of treatment of wound infection is quite simple. Remove some of thetapes, sutures, or staples and allow the wound to open and drain. Apply warm,moist compresses for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 hours. This will promote drainageof the wound and increase the local circulation, thus bringing large numbers offriendly white blood cells and fibroblasts into the area. The fibroblast triesto wall off the infection and prevent the further spread of germs. Once aninfection has obviously started, the use of an antibiotic will be helpful but isnot always essential. From the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module, use evaquin,500 mg once daily. If the Rx Injectable Medication Module is available, useRocephin, 500 mg twice daily IM or 1,000 mg once daily IM.ABSCESS [nav.xhtml#sub151]An abscess (boil or furuncle) is a pocket of pus (white blood cells), germs, andred blood cells that have been contained by an envelope of scar tissue producedby fibroblasts. This protects the body from the further spread of germs. It ispart of the body’s strong natural defense against invasion by bacteria.Conversely, many antibiotics cannot penetrate into the abscess cavity very well.The cure for an abscess is surgical. It must be opened and drained.There are two basic ways in which this can happen. First, moist warm soaks willnot only aid in abscess formation but will also aid in bringing the infection tothe surface and cause the infection to “ripen,” even open and drain on its own.An abscess can be very painful and this opening period very prolonged. Once theabscess is on the surface, it is generally better to open it using a techniquecalled incision and drainage, or I&D. The ideal instrument for I&D is a thin,sharp blade. Use the blade to penetrate the surface skin and open the cavitywith minimal pressure on the wound.Abscesses are very painful, primarily because of the pressure within them. Aperson coming into a doctor’s office with a painful abscess would expect to haveit anesthetized before opening. Injections into these areas only add to thepain. The best anesthesia is to cool the wound area. In the field an ice cube orapplication of an instant cold pack will help provide some anesthesia. A personwith a painful abscess will usually let you try the knife, as they can becomedesperate for pain relief. The relief that they get when the pressure is removedis immediate, even without cooling.Coat the skin surface around the abscess with triple antibiotic ointment fromthe Topical Bandaging Module to protect the skin from the bacteria that aredraining from the wound. Spread of infection from these bacteria is unlikely,however, unless the skin is abraded or otherwise broken.CELLULITIS [nav.xhtml#sub152]Cellulitis is a very dangerous and rapidly progressive skin infection thatresults in red, painful swelling of the skin without pus or blister formation.The lesion spreads by the hour, with streaks of red progressing toward the heartahead of the swelling. This represents the travel of infection along thelymphatic system and is frequently called blood poisoning in the vernacular.While lymphatic spread is not strictly blood poisoning, cellulitis doesfrequently lead to generalized blood poisoning (septicemia) and can cause thedevelopment of chills, fever, and other symptoms of generalized profoundinfection, such as lethargy and even shock. Very dangerous and virulent germsare responsible. Strong antibiotics are necessary, and the application of localheat is very helpful.Old-time remedies included the use of various “drawing salves,” but nothingworks better than local hot compresses. Local heat increases the circulation ofblood into the infected area, bringing white cells that will kill the bacteriadirectly and produce antibodies to aid in killing the germs. The infectionfighters, and the walling-off process of the fibroblasts, will hopefully containand destroy the infection. When this walling off process succeeds, an abscess isformed (see preceding section). If the Rx Injectable Medication Module isavailable, give Rocephin, 500 mg IM twice daily. Or, if only the Rx Oral/TopicalMedication Module is available, give doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, orLevaquin, 500 mg once daily.SKIN RASH [nav.xhtml#sub153]A rash is a frequent outdoor problem. At times a rash is associated with certaindiseases and can help in the diagnosis. If the patient is feverish or obviouslyill, review the sections on Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhoidfever, syphilis, meningococcal meningitis, strep throat, measles, andmononucleosis in chapter 9 [Chapter09.xhtml].Many infections that cause rash are viral and will not respond to antibiotics.But, with no professional medical help available, rash associated with symptomsof illness, particularly fever and aching, should be empirically treated with anantibiotic such as doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, for at least 2 days beyondthe defervescence (loss of fever). Some of the above infections require longerantibiotic treatment, so it should be continued as indicated if there is aprobability that you are dealing with one of them.Localized rashes without fever are usually due to superficial skin infections,fungal infections, or allergic reactions. Itch can be treated with antihistamineor any pain medication. The Non-Rx Oral Medication Module has diphenhydramine,25 mg, as an antihistamine. One capsule (2 in severe cases) every 6 hours willhelp with itch from nearly any cause.As itch travels over the same nerves that carry the sensation of pain, any painmedication can also help with itch. Warm soaks generally make itch and rashworse and should be avoided, unless there is evidence of deep infection (seeAbscess and Cellulitis above). It is hard to do better than diphenhydramine withregard to oral anti-histamine effect, but it should be noted that Atarax (in theRx Oral/ Topical Medication Module), and the same medication in injectable form,Vistaril (in the Rx Medication Injectable Module), also have antihistamineaction and can be used for itch. Also soothing to either a non-weeping lesion ora blistered and weeping lesion is the application of a piece of Spenco 2nd Skinfrom the Topical Bandaging Module. Cool compresses will also soothe a rash.For a moist, weeping lesion (this includes poison ivy, poison oak, and poisonsumac), wet soaks of dilute Epsom salts, boric acid, or even table salt willhelp dry it. If it is a dry, scaly rash, an ointment works best, much betterthan a gel, lotion, or cream. Blistered rashes are treated best with creams,lotions, or gels. Specific types of rashes require specific types of topicalmedications, however.FUNGAL INFECTION [nav.xhtml#sub154]A fungal infection is commonly encountered in the groin, in the armpit, in skinfolds, on the scrotum, under a woman’s breasts, and around the rectum. Rashescan range from bright red to almost colorless but are generally at least dullred, and frequently have small satellite spots near the major portion ofconfluent rash. Fungal infections are very slow in spreading, with the lesionsbecoming larger over a period of weeks to months. Body ringworm is a circularrash with a less intense center area (caution: see Lyme Disease, page 228[Chapter09.xhtml#page_228]).Fungal rashes should be treated with a specific antifungal, such as clotrimazole2% cream from the Topical Bandaging Module. Apply a thin coat twice daily. Goodresults should be obtained within 2 weeks for jock itch, but athlete’s foot andbody ringworm may take 4 weeks and need to have continued treatment until allevidence of rash is gone, then treatment continued once daily for an additional3 weeks. If no improvement has been made, the diagnosis may have been wrong, orthe fungus is refractory to your medication. From the Rx Oral Medication Module,Diflucan, 150 mg, daily will destroy most body surface fungal infections, but itis included in only a small quantity for primary use in the treatment ofvaginitis.ALLERGIC DERMATITIS [nav.xhtml#sub155]The hallmarks of allergic dermatitis are vesicles, or small blisters, on red,swollen, and very itchy skin. A line of these blisters clinches the diagnosis ofallergic, or contact, dermatitis. The most common culprits are poison ivy,poison sumac, and poison oak. Contact with caterpillars, millipedes, and manyplants—even such innocent species as various evergreens—can also induce allergicor toxic skin reactions.A toxic reaction to a noxious substance, such as from certain insects andplants, is treated like an allergic dermatitis. First aid treatment is athorough cleansing with soap and water. Further treatment is withdiphenhydramine, 25 mg every 6 hours, from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module,and twice daily applications of hydro-cortisone cream 1% from the TopicalBandaging Module. Weeping lesions can be treated with wet soaks as mentionedabove. An occlusive plastic dressing will allow the rather weak 1%hydrocortisone to work much better.The Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module has two very effective medications totreat this problem. Continue use of the diphenhydramine, but add Decadron, 4 mgtablet, 1 daily for 5 to 7 days, and apply Topicort 0.25% ointment in place ofthe hydrocortisone cream. A thin coat twice daily without an occlusive plasticdressing should work rapidly.Stinging nettle causes a severe irritation that can be instantly eliminated bythe application of “GI jungle juice,” a mixture of 75% DEET insect repellent and25% isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. I discovered this neat trick the hard way(accidentally) while camping in fields of the stuff along the Cape Fear River inNorth Carolina. Since mentioning this in the first edition of my book WildernessMedicine in 1979, many others in contact with this plant have confirmed thetreatment’s instantaneous effectiveness.BACTERIAL SKIN RASH [nav.xhtml#sub156]A common bacterial superficial skin infection causing a rash is impetigo. Thenormal appearance of this condition is reddish areas around pus-filled blisters,which are frequently crusty and scabbed. The lesions spread rapidly over aperiod of days. The skin is generally not swollen underneath the lesions. Itoften starts around the nose and on the buttocks, spreads rapidly fromscratching, and can soon appear anywhere on the body. Early lesions appear assmall pimples, which form crusts within 12 to 24 hours. Lesions should becleaned with surgical soap (or hydrogen peroxide) and then covered with anapplication of triple antibiotic ointment. Avoid placing bandages on theselesions, as the germs can spread under the tape.Bacterial skin infections generally must be treated with prescriptionantibiotics. From the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module, give Levaquin 500 mgonce daily. The Rx Injectable Medication Module contains Rocephin, which wouldbe ideal for this condition; give 500 mg IM once daily.Treatment of abscess and cellulitis, forms of deep skin infections, arediscussed on pages 147 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_147] and 148[Chapter06.xhtml#page_148].See pages 61 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_61]–62 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_62] fortreatment of cold sores and lip or mouth lesions.SEABATHER’S ERUPTION [nav.xhtml#sub157]Seabather’s eruption is the term used for the sudden onset of a very itchy rashassociated with swimming. In south Florida and the Caribbean, it is caused bylarvae of the thimble jellyfish (Linuche unguiculata) or by the larvae of thesea anemone (Edwardsiella lineata). The latter was shown to be responsible forthousands of cases on Long Island, New York. Global warming will probably causethis condition to become a problem much farther north than that.Welts (urticaria) or a fine red or pimply rash appears within 24 hours ofexposure to ocean water, normally in areas covered by bathing suits. The tinylarvae are trapped next to the skin within the bathing suit and dischargenematocysts that cause the disease. Additional symptoms frequently associatedwith this rash include fever, chills, weakness, and headache, as the larvaepenetrate the skin and cause illness. In south Florida the occurrence is fromMarch to August, with a peak of outbreaks in May. In Long Island waters theoutbreaks occur from mid-August until the end of the swimming season in earlySeptember. These outbreaks are episodic, with very few cases some years andthousands of cases during peak years.Treatment consists of topical corticosteroid (1% hydrocortisone cream from theTopical Bandaging Module applied 4 times daily, or 0.25% Topicort ointment fromthe Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module applied twice daily) and antihistamine(diphenhydramine, 25 mg) from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module taken 4 times aday. Swimmers should remove bathing suits and shower as soon as possible afterleaving the water. And swimming at a nude beach doesn’t protect you just becauseyou are not wearing a bathing suit."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 [nav.xhtml#ch07]ORTHOPEDICS – BONE AND JOINT PAIN AND INJURY [nav.xhtml#ch07]MANAGEMENT OFF THE GRID [nav.xhtml#sub158]Orthopedics includes the study of bone, joint, and muscle function anddisorders. This section establishes basic protocols for the assessment and careof orthopedic disorders. General concepts of care will be followed by asystematic evaluation by anatomical region with suggested care plans. Nocondition can be more debilitating or restrict operations more than an injury orsimply the development of pain that interferes with your ability to survive orfunction in the challenging circumstances of living off the grid.While diagnosis and management can be complex, this chapter will provide anapproach to caring for these concerns in a reasonable and often definitivemanner, even in the case of a nonexistent grid!The following chart refers you to general management principles and to diagnosisand treatment plans by anatomical region.Diagnosis and Treatment PlansConcepts of Orthopedic Care • Muscle Pain—No Acute Injury 155 • MusclePain—Acute Injury 156 • Joint Pain—No Acute Injury 158 • Joint Pain—Acute Injury159 • Fractures 161 • Open Fracture 163 Diagnosis and Care Protocols 164 • Head165 • Neck 167 • Spine 168 • Collarbone 170 • Shoulder 172 • Shoulder Blade 174• Upper Arm Fractures (Near the Shoulder) 174 • Upper Arm Fractures (Below theShoulder) 175 • Elbow Trauma 177 • Forearm Fractures 178 • Wrist Fractures andDislocations 180 • Thumb Sprains and Fractures 182 • Hand Fractures 183 • FingerFractures and Sprains 183 • Hip Dislocation and Fracture 185 • Thigh Fractures187 • Kneecap Dislocation 188 • Knee Sprains, Dislocations, and Fractures 189 •Ankle Sprains, Dislocations, and Fractures 190 • Foot Injuries 191 • ChestInjuries 191CONCEPTS OF ORTHOPEDIC CARE [nav.xhtml#sub159]MUSCLE PAIN—NO ACUTE INJURY [nav.xhtml#sub160]Muscle aches can arise from chronic inflammation disorders such as lupus andfibromyalgia, but the discussion here will be limited to those conditions thatmight reasonably arise when performing strenuous or repetitive activities.When associated with a fever, consider an infectious basis for the pain. Withouta reasonable method of diagnosis, it would be best to treat with both anantibiotic and appropriate pain medication. Even in North America, severalserious conditions can present in this manner that require antibiotic treatment,such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Regardless of cause, it is appropriate tostart ibuprofen, 200 mg tablets with 2 to 4 tablets each dose, repeated every 6hours, for fever and muscle aches.While it’s best to have a physician see the patient and to draw the appropriatelab tests before commencing antibiotics (when you are on the grid and can obtaintests), if the pain is localized to a specific area and accompanied by swelling,redness, and especially fever, start doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily. If youmight be treating Lyme disease, this treatment will need to be continued for atleast 2 weeks (see page 228 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_228]).Under conditions of heat stress, heavy exertion causing sweating, or diarrheaand vomiting, or the use of diuretics causing increased urine output, musclecramping may be caused by the resulting electrolyte abnormality. Appropriatefluid and electrolyte replacement is necessary, as discussed on page 88[Chapter03.xhtml#page_88].Overuse syndromes cause pain in muscles that go beyond the mild ache you areaccustomed to feeling after a workout at the gym. While it is possible tosuddenly tear muscles with sudden movements, significant pain that startsgradually or soon after the exercise is over could be tendinitis, spasm causedby a pinched nerve, or significant inflammation in the muscle. The treatment forthese conditions is the same as that employed for tendinitis, as described inthat section on page 158 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_158]. Additionally, the use of amuscle relaxer is of benefit. From the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module, takePercogesic, 2 tablets every 6 hours, or from the Rx Oral/Topical MedicationModule, use Atarax, 25 mg every 6 hours. These medications can be used inaddition to the others prescribed for tendinitis, unless the condition isrelatively mild, when the use of ibuprofen alone should suffice.MUSCLE PAIN—ACUTE INJURY [nav.xhtml#sub161]Pain occurs immediately after a significant muscle injury, a contusion or strainbeing the general cause. RICE is the acronym that applies here: rest,immobilize, cold, elevate or, more classically, rest, ice, compress, andelevate. An elastic bandage, cold stream water, elevation of a limb, and restmay not all be possible, but they comprise the initial treatment. Theapplication of cold is most important as it decreases tissue bleeding fromconstricting blood vessels, though be careful not to cause freezing injury.Compression can provide stability as well as accomplishing much the samebenefit.Contusions cause bleeding into the surrounding muscle tissue through the ruptureof small blood vessels. Using the RICE technique will minimize the bleeding andlocal swelling. Strains on muscles result in either microscopic muscle fibertears or muscle mass tears. These are classified from grade I (microscopic) tograde IV (total tear of a muscle). Grades II and III are partial tears of amuscle mass. A total tear would require surgical repair. All will be treatedsimilarly in an off-grid situation: Initially use RICE, as indicated above. Ifsignificant swelling of the muscle occurs, consider that you are dealing with agrade III or IV tear and continue RICE for 2 days. Otherwise use RICE for thefirst 24 hours.The next step in treating significant muscle injury is to apply local heat. Inthe case of minor injuries, apply it the next day. For more serious injuries,delay the use of heat for 2 days. Continue the use of the compression dressing.Splint or sling as necessary for comfort. Decrease activity to a level where thepain is tolerable.A full rupture of a muscle body will generally result in a bulging of the musclemass and a loss of strength during the late recovery period. This may not benoticeable at first, as the swelling would initially be attributed to localbleeding and pain would restrict use. Once the pain is gone, continued swelling,especially after several weeks have passed, is probably due to a significantmuscle tear or a ruptured tendon. This should be repaired when possible, but donot despair if it is not, as this is a tolerable injury. The acute pain of amuscle belly tear will subside within a few weeks, noticeable discomfort after 6weeks, and then scar tissue forms and the body will replace the primary actionsof the torn muscle (if fully torn) by using accessory muscles to the extent thatit can and the injured individual will have to subsequently adapt to theweakened condition that will result. It is amazing how well we can perform withsome of these injuries, one of the most common being total tear of the bicepsmuscle or tendon. The muscle contracts, which means that it will bulge, but itsmajor action, that of pronation (e.g., turning a screwdriver), will be greatlyweakened. Fortunately, accessory muscles will aid in most function of the upperarm, such as flexion of the elbow.JOINT PAIN—NO ACUTE INJURY [nav.xhtml#sub162]Pain in the joint without history of injury is generally due to arthritis,bursitis, or tendinitis. Without a history of previous arthritis, the latter twoare the more likely diagnosis, but the treatment is the same for all three. Themost common reason for tendon or joint inflammation is overuse. French trappersfrequently complained of Achilles tendinitis while snowshoeing, which theyappropriately termed mal de raquette. Persons hammering, chopping wood, orplaying tennis are familiar with “tennis elbow” (epicondylitis of the elbow).Tendinitis can occur in the thumb and wrist—in fact, any tendon in the body canbecome inflamed with overuse. Joints similarly become inflamed with repetitiousactivity or even unusual compression. Bricklayers and others who must workkneeling will, on occasion, encounter a patellar bursitis of the knee (calledcommonly housemaid’s knee). Many people form bursitis flare-ups in a shoulderafter repetitive arm actions or in the forearm due to the overuse of flexortendons of the wrist.Treatment of these conditions must include adjusting the technique for theactivity that seems to have caused it. By changing a grip on an axe or hoe,using the tool with a different pitch to the blades, or altering a movement inany fashion to avoid generating additional pain, the victim can try to alleviatethe discomfort and avoid inflaming it more. Prior to an activity, theapplication of heat to the sore area helps with prevention. Immediately afteraggravating the condition, applying cold is of benefit. Within an hour, returnto a local heat application and continue this during the evenings.Applying a cream such as Aspercreme (other brand names are Myoflex and Mobisyl)with a dry heat might help a tendinitis, as the active ingredient (trolaminesalicylate 10% concentration) penetrates the skin and provides localanti-inflammatory action. Sports creams that feel warm, such as Icy Hot, simplyirritate the skin surface to cause an increased blood flow and thus providewarmth to the area. They do not have an anti-inflammatory effect, nor do theyprovide any benefit over the application of heat. This does not mean that thesecreams do not have a potentially valuable role here. It is very difficult toapply hot soaks sometimes, and these creams can serve the purpose. Topicalproducts containing diclofenac are now widely available by prescription (brandnames Voltaren 1% gel, Pennsaid, or Flector 1.3% patches). These are the mosteffective topical treatment possible, but the onset of relief takes a few daysof application.If hot compresses seem to aggravate the pain, switch to a cold compress. Avoidmaking any movements that seem to cause the most pain for 5 to 7 days. Splintingmay help during this period. Avoid nonuse of the shoulder for longer than 2weeks, as it is prone to adhesion formation, and loss of function can result.The best medication for chronic joint pain is ibuprofen from the Non-Rx OralMedication Module due to its anti-inflammatory action; 4 tablets every 6 hourswill help with joint and tendon pain. From the Rx Oral/Topical MedicationModule, one could use Decadron, 4 mg, given once daily for 7 days for jointinflammation. Note: See the warning in the discussion of the use of theantibiotic Levaquin with regard to tendonitis and tendon rupture (page 286[Chapter11.xhtml#page_286]).JOINT PAIN—ACUTE INJURY [nav.xhtml#sub163]Immediately after a joint injury, we all want to evaluate the injury, determinehow serious it is, and figure out how or if the injury may affect our wholegroup’s survival situation. Frankly, making a precise diagnosis usually isn’tpossible initially, so our approach to the acute joint injury must be to look atmethods of treatment and potential long-term care. The discussion on orthopedicinjuries in this book considers the body by region, not by precise diagnosis ofinjury. Nevertheless, we must try to have some understanding of what might havehappened, make an accurate prognosis early in the event, and minimize the damagewhile keeping the victim as functional as possible.Unusual stress across a joint can result in damage to supporting ligaments.Ordinarily this is a temporary stretching damage, but in severe cases rupture ofligaments or even fracture of bones or tears of cartilage can result. Theseinjuries are serious problems and may require surgical repair. This is best doneimmediately but can be safely delayed 3 weeks. Fractures entering the jointspace may result in long-term joint pain and subsequent arthritis. Cartilagetears do not heal themselves, unlike ligament, tendon, and bone damage. Thesefrequently cause so much future pain and instability that surgical correction isrequired.Proper care of joint injuries must be started immediately. RICE (Rest, Ice,Compress, Elevate) forms the basis of good first aid management. Cold should beapplied for the first 2 days as continuously as possible. Then apply heat for 20minutes or longer, 4 times daily. Cold decreases the circulation, which lessensbleeding and swelling. Heat increases the circulation, which then aids thehealing process. This technique applies to all injuries, including musclecontusions and bruises.Elevate the involved joint, if possible. Wrap with elastic bandage or cloth tapeto immobilize the joint and provide moderate support once ambulation or use ofthe joint begins. Take care that the wrappings are not so tightly applied thatthey cut off the circulation.Use crutches or other supports to take enough weight off an injured ankle orknee so that increased pain is not experienced. The patient should not use aninjured joint if it causes pain, as this indicates further strain on the alreadystressed ligaments or fracture. Conversely, if use of the injured part does notcause pain, additional damage is not being done even if there is considerableswelling. If the victim must walk on an injured ankle or knee, and doing socauses considerable pain, then support it the best way possible (wrapping,crutches, decreased carrying load, tight boot for ankle injury) and realize thatfurther damage is being done, but that, in your opinion, the situation warrantssuch a sacrifice.While compression is good for an acute injury, too much could cut offcirculation and must be avoided. If an ankle is injured, the boot can provideneeded compression, but remove it if the pain becomes intolerable. A boot canalways be put back on a swollen ankle by undoing the laces and just wrappingthem around the boot circumference rather than using the eyelets.Pain medications may be given as needed, but elevation and decreased use willprovide considerable pain relief. See also Fractures below.FRACTURES [nav.xhtml#sub164]A fracture is a medical term meaning a broken bone. It is not true that “if youcan move the part, it is not broken.” Pain will prevent some movement, but thisdoes not aid in the diagnosis between a fracture and a contusion. Fractures mayconsist of a single crack in the bone and be rather stable, or there may be manycracks and pieces, consequently becoming very unstable. There may be no way oftelling which is present, or even if a fracture is there at all, without anX-ray. Deformity indicates either a fracture or contusion causing swelling withsoft tissue bleeding if located in the middle of a long bone area, or a possibledislocation or severe sprain with or without a fracture if located at a joint.The hallmark of a fracture is point tenderness or pain to touch over the site ofthe break. Swelling over the break site is further evidence of a fracture.Another way to deduce the presence of a fracture is to apply gentle torsion orlongitudinal compression to the bone in question, with either technique causingincreased pain at the fracture site.Each fracture has several critical aspects in its management to consider: (1)correct loss of circulation or nerve damage due to deformity of the fracture;(2) prevent the induction of infection if the skin is broken at or near thefracture site; (3) prevent further soft tissue damage; and (4) obtain reasonablealignment of bone fragments so that adequate healing takes place. The nonskilledpractitioner is limited to the first three management techniques.The first aid approach to a fracture is to “splint them as they lie.” This,however, is not an appropriate response in remote areas. Straighten grossdeformities of angulated fractures with gentle in-line traction, as in figure7-1. Before straightening, check and compare the pulses beyond the fracture siteon the left and right side of the victim and check for any abnormality ofsensation. After correcting the angulation, circulation should improve. Asarteries and veins are hollow tubes, their lumens will stretch and narrow ifthey are forced to bend around a corner, thus decreasing blood flow. When thisbend is eliminated, the vessel will return to its normal size and blood flowwill improve. As the person could be in shock, it might be difficult to feel thepulses on either side. It is much more accurate to evaluate the circulation byexamination of both sides and comparing the results.chpt_fig_030 [../Images/chpt_fig_030.jpg]chpt_fig_031 [../Images/chpt_fig_031.jpg]Figure 7-1.Use in-line traction to straighten grossly angulated fractures. This techniqueis not meant to perfectly align the bone ends; it is only meant to eliminategross deformity.Grossly angulated fractures also allow sharps ends of bone to project againstthe skin surface. Even with careful padding, jostling along during an evacuationmay cause one of these bone spicules to penetrate the skin surface, causing anopen fracture and increasing the chance of serious wound and bone infection.The chance of causing harm while straightening an angulated fracture would beextremely low. It is possible for a blood vessel or nerve to become trappedwithin the fracture site, but gentle repositioning into slight deformity shouldcorrect this.Pad splints well to prevent skin damage. Pneumatic splints are available frommany outfitters. Fracture splinting is generally well covered in first aidcourses. Such a course should be taken before any major expedition into thebush. Improvisation is the name of the game in fracture immobilization, andhaving an adequate first aid course provides one with information upon which toimprovise. In general, splint fractures to immobilize the joint above and belowthe fracture site.Any wound in the skin near a broken bone increases the chance of a boneinfection. Follow the principles of thorough wound cleansing as indicated onpage 122 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_122].With proper splinting, the pain involved with a fracture will decreasedramatically. Provide pain medication when possible. Pain control is discussedon page 31 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_31]. The Rx Atarax can be given to aid inmuscle spasm control. Mild sedation with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may help itssedating effects.At times there will be uncertainty about whether a fracture exists. When indoubt, splint and treat for pain, avoiding use of the involved part. Within afew days the pain will have diminished and the crisis may be over. If not, thesuspicion of a fracture will loom even larger.OPEN FRACTUREEven a laceration or puncture wound near a broken bone is a cause for alarm.Such a wound can allow bacteria into the fracture site, causing a serious boneinfection. This wound requires aggressive cleansing, as indicated on page 123[Chapter06.xhtml#page_123]. The wound should not be closed, as this increasesthe chance of infection. Wet dressings are best over an open wound. Soak thesterile dressing in sterile water, and cover with a clean, dry dressing. Changethis dressing twice daily.If a piece of bone is protruding from the skin, the break is called an openfracture. The first aid approach is to splint in position and cover with asterile dressing. In a remote area this approach will not work. This woundrequires aggressive irrigation with surgical scrub or soap as described on page124 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_124].The aggressiveness of this cleansing action should be done in such a manner asnot to cause further damage, but the area must be free of foreign particulatematter and as antiseptic as possible. Cover the wound with triple antibioticointment. Protect with sterile gauze dressings, with only enough pressure tocontrol bleeding. Straighten the gross angulation of the fracture with gentlein-line traction (see figure 7-1). This will cause the protruding bone todisappear under the skin surface, unless the fragment is loose from the mainbone; allow this wound to remain open and dress as indicated above.In all cases of a laceration or puncture wound near a fracture, place the victimon oral antibiotics when available. From the Rx Oral/ Topical Medication Module,use Levaquin, 500 mg daily. However, if the Rx Injectable Medication Module iscarried, give Rocephin, 500 mg IM twice daily. Continue the medication until thepatient is evacuated or the medication runs out.DIAGNOSIS AND CARE PROTOCOLS [nav.xhtml#sub165]The diagnosis of these injuries will be difficult due to lack of experience orthe benefit of X-ray equipment. Uncertainties of diagnosis will exist, andtherefore a systematic approach to the evaluation and treatment of the injuredpatient has to be developed that will handle most common injuries appropriately.The orthopedic evaluation is made easier because human beings have equal sidesthat can be compared. Take the clothing off both the injured and normal sidesand compare, weather permitting. Look for swelling or different configuration.When examining the injured side, touch lightly. A fracture or sprain is verytender and will not require hard poking to elicit obvious pain. Swelling resultsfrom localized bleeding, which a fracture will almost always cause. Several daysafter the injury, a bruise may appear near it or lower on the person. Gravity,as well as various muscle groups and local anatomy, can cause this spilled bloodto migrate to a place at a different location from the injury site. This doesnot mean that the injury is spreading; it just represents the displacement ofblood and part of the reabsorption process of healing. Don’t be concerned aboutthe appearance of bruising and its spread in the days after the injury.HEAD [nav.xhtml#sub166]Lacerations of the scalp or face result in massive bleeding, the care of whichis discussed on page 131 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_131]. Internal head injuriesrange from insignificant to lethal. Check the level of reponsiveness as per page10 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_10]. Urgent evacuation is necessary for anyone whoexhibits any of the following: * Unconsciousness for more than 2 minutes * Debilitating headache * Loss of coordination or garbled speech * Persistent nausea and vomiting * Bruising behind the ears (sign of skull fracture) * Bruising around the eyes (sign of skull fracture) * Decrease in vision * Clear fluid draining from nose and/or ears (possible spinal fluid) * Seizures * Relapse into unconsciousnessSuspect a neck injury in anyone with a head injury. On most trips it is prudentto seek medical care for anyone who has been knocked unconscious for even abrief moment. The patient can walk and assist in her own evacuation if there isno apparent spine injury. If the patient is not thinking clearly or has any ofthe above signs, immobilize the neck and entire spine. Initially this may haveto be done on the ground, with the patient lying down and using hand traction tostabilize his head and neck.A head-injured patient will frequently vomit. To avoid aspirating this into hislungs, place him face down with his face turned to one side, or sit the patientup with his head elevated to 30 degrees. This position may also decrease some ofthe headache associated with head injury.While the patient is kept awake for neurological assessments of levels ofresponsiveness in civilization, if evacuation will take a long time (severaldays), allow the person to fall asleep. While the person is asleep the brain hasits best chance to control its own swelling.While the use of pain and anti-nausea medication might alter the mental statusand is avoided in urban first aid care, when you are responsible off the gridfor long-term care, it makes sense to use these medications. It is best to usethe mildest medication necessary for relief. Refer to pain management (page 31[Chapter03.xhtml#page_31]) and nausea management (page 24[Chapter02.xhtml#page_24]).If you detect improvement in the symptoms over the next 2 days, the prognosis isvery good. If symptoms increase, rapidly return the patient to the grid ifpossible. If there is no grid, most everything you do will be of no additionalhelp. In the past, large doses of steroid were given (such as dexamethasone, 16to 24 mg per day, from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module). Recent studiesindicate steroids cause more harm than good, although if all you have to offeris death in a deteriorating patient, going back to a widely used old protocol isall you have. Improved results from that therapy may show within 1 day or takeup to 8 days. When this high a dose of dexamethasone is used, it will need to begradually withdrawn (tapered) when concluding the treatment period in order toallow the adrenal glands to recover and produce the normal cortisol levels thathave been suppressed by this therapy. When using low-dose dexamethasone (4 mgper day) less than 10 days, it can be stopped abruptly. But large doses used asindicated above must be tapered no matter how long they are used. Reduce highdose (16 to 24 mg) by halving the dose every few days, until down to 2 mg, thenreduce by 0.5 to 1 mg every 5 to 7 days. A standard method of treating increasedintracranial pressure is the use of hyperosmolar diuretics (such as mannitol)via intravenous infusion. This item is not in your suggested Off- Grid MedicalKit, but another item used is a “loop diuretic,” which is suggested. Usefurosemide, 40 mg daily until consciousness improves, at which time it may bestopped abruptly. If only a milder diuretic is available, such as thehydrochlorothiazide, use 50 mg per day. It also may be stopped abruptly whensymptoms improve. If the patient is conscious, you will need to insert a Foleycatheter.NECK [nav.xhtml#sub167]Examination of the neck is critical to helping preserve the spinal cord frominjury if the neck is unstable. Without moving the neck, gently palpate alongthe spinous process to elicit point tenderness in the conscious patient. Nopoint tenderness will generally mean no significant bone damage to the neck. Inan unconscious patient with head trauma, treat as if the neck is fractured.Splint carefully for maximal immobilization. If the neck is at an odd angle, itshould be straightened with gentle in-line traction, by pulling steadily andslowly on the head along the line in which you find the neck. Move the neck to aneutral position in a line with the spine. This is a maneuver taught bywilderness first aid classes. Practice before attempting.Patients should not be allowed to move, nor should they be lifted or transportedwithout careful immobilization of the neck. The best technique for initialcervical immobilization is gentle but firm control by a person holding thepatient’s head. Remind the victim to remain still. Eventually this firm controlmight be replaced with a cervical collar, or a rolled Ensolite pad or other softmaterial. The SAM Splint can be molded into a cervical collar, as shown infigure 7-2.Neck injuries, when serious as described above, are best treated within thegrid, but without the grid, you will need to move them onto a comfortable bed.Elevate the head to 30 degrees. Pad the neck with pillows on each side todiscourage sideways movement and forward or rearward bending of the neck. Thegreatest challenge to be managed over the 8 weeks of healing is toiletactivities. The neck must be provided adequate padding to prevent movement whenthe patient’s position must change. Treat for pain and muscle spasm (see page 31[Chapter03.xhtml#page_31] for pain management). Numbness, radiating pain, lossof nerve or muscle function possibly could have been prevented with surgery, butlacking on-grid care, the only thing you can do now is to try to relieveswelling around the spinal cord. Use the same treatments as indicated above forhead injury with regard to use of dexamethasone, furosemide, orhydrochlorothiazide.To prevent neck injury, the cervical collar must be augmented with total bodyimmobilization. Current techniques are being promoted that would avoid the useof cervical collars, as even attempting to put them on can cause more necktrauma than they prevent. Most cervical fractures are not unstable, so thecollar adds to airway management difficulty and patient discomfort, and providesno benefit.chpt_fig_032 [../Images/chpt_fig_032.jpg]Figure 7-2.SAM Splint molded into a cervical collar. The vertical creases make the splintrigid.If no point tenderness is claimed by the conscious victim, but generalized painand spasm of the neck muscles are present, the victim may be suffering a severesprain. A neck brace made from a towel or other rolled cloth can help with thelong-term treatment and provides adequate support. Local warmth will help relaxthese muscles. Pain medication and muscle relaxants are useful in curing a necksprain and spasm. It can take weeks for this injury to cease hurting.SPINE [nav.xhtml#sub168]The neurological assessment of potential neck injury includes assessment of theentire spine. For a neurological check, ask the patient if there is numbness ortingling anywhere on the body. Assess grip strength on both sides as well as theability to wiggle toes and flex the feet up and down. Check the entire spine bypalpating along the spinous processes, looking for any point tenderness. If theabove examination is questionable, or even if the trauma seems severe, both neckand spinal immobilization are in order. Having a rescuer maintain firm handcontrol of the victim’s neck will be necessary until the patient has been placedupon a suitable rigid stretcher. Rigid stretchers are very difficult toimprovise, and moving people upon them even more difficult. While Buck Tilton’sWilderness First Responder, 3rd edition (Globe Pequot Press, 2010) goes intogreat detail in describing this technique, these skills require practice.Ensure that the patient has been securely tied into the litter before you securethe head. If the body shifts while the head is tied down, any damage present inthe neck could increase.When on the grid, this is the end of the neck/spine story. The patient remainsfastened rigidly to a stretcher until the emergency department physician hastaken tests and made the determination that she can be removed. This may takeseveral agonizing hours. I say agonizing because even a normal person will hurtlike crazy when attached to a rigid stretcher or backboard. It’s almost aself-fulfilling prophecy. If patients don’t have back trouble before beingfastened down, they will now. A report in the Annals of Emergency Medicinetitled “The Effect of Spinal Immobilization on Healthy Volunteers” placed 21volunteers (who had never experienced any back problems) in standard backboardimmobilization for 30 minutes and found that 100% had pain during that period,with 55% grading it moderate to severe, and after release 29% developedadditional symptoms during the following 48 hours.Especially in a remote location, it is important to reassess the spine to ensurethat continued immobilization is necessary, which is difficult even if healthypeople develop back pain after a short time on the board. You will have to usecommon sense. Inability to move an extremity or loss of sensation, without anorthopedic injury in that limb, must cause a high suspicion of spinal cordinjury. But if these signs and symptoms are not present and you become convincedthat you are only dealing with a sore muscle problem in the back, not a brokenor disrupted spine, then the spine may be cleared—a term meaning let the patientout of the rigid support. Continued partial support with a soft foam pad aroundthe neck, or even a back brace made of Ensolite foam wrapped around the patient,might make sense. Then again, it might not. It’s a judgment call based upon theseverity of the injury and resulting symptoms and, in general, how far off thegrid you are.Point tenderness encountered when carefully palpating the spine indicates apossible fracture. If it is a fracture of the body of the vertebrae, this verypainful condition can heal with only rest, although the healing process willtake 8 weeks. This is a common fracture of elderly people due to osteoporosisand is encountered when they suddenly place a compression on the spine, usuallywhile falling. These seldom are so bad that fragments compress the spinal cord.Fractures of the vertebral process where muscles attach can be stretch injuriesor blows that can be very painful but not neurologically compromising. Nonumbness should result or endanger leg movement. Injuries causing instability ofthe back can result in complete paralysis below the injury. The only thing thatcan be done without proper X-ray evaluation is to pad the patient and preventmovement. This means feeding, toilet activities, and as much pain control as youcan provide. There is no need to discuss here how tragic this injury can becomewithout proper neurosurgical care. Eight weeks will tell the tale. Some painrelief can be attempted with the addition of oral steroid (decadron 4 mg twicedaily) as discussed under head and neck injuries above.COLLARBONE [nav.xhtml#sub169]Evaluate for pain by palpation along the collarbone (clavicle). Separations ofthe clavicle from the sternum (breastbone), fractures of the clavicle, andseparations of the shoulder can all be treated similarly with a sling andswathe, shown in figure 7-3.The clavicle frequently fractures in the midportion. Proper reduction will occurif the shoulders are held back, like those of a Marine at attention. A figureeight (figure 7-4) will maintain this position. A stoop shoulder position willallow too much override of the fracture parts.A fracture of the clavicle at the end near the shoulder may be hard to hold inproper position. In children there is a sleeve of tissue at this location thataids in holding the proper alignment. In adults this tissue is missing, andsurgical pinning may be required for optimal healing. However, even in the adultthis fracture may be treated adequately, usually with a sling.chpt_fig_033 [../Images/chpt_fig_033.jpg]Figure 7-3.A sling and swathe will protect the injured shoulder and decrease pain in therecently fractured clavicle. This system can be duplicated by pinning theforearm to the front of a shirt. Use a sling without swathe if there is a dangerof the person slipping off a hill or falling into water.chpt_fig_034 [../Images/chpt_fig_034.jpg]Figure 7-4.The figure-eight splint will hold a clavicle fracture in the proper position forhealing. Add a sling for maximum pain control.A fracture of the clavicle at the end near the breastbone (sternum) is bestreduced and held in position with a figure-eight splint. In any claviclefracture the use of a sling will aid greatly in decreasing pain. The sling canbe eliminated in 2 weeks, but the figure-eight splint should be kept on for 3 to4 weeks, or until there is no pain over the fracture site with free movement ofthe shoulder.SHOULDER [nav.xhtml#sub170]Shoulder separations are classified as grade I to grade III, depending upon theseverity. Grade I has tenderness over the acromioclavicular joint, representinga strain of the ligaments but with no disruption or tear. A grade II is arupture of the two acromioclavicular ligaments, while a grade III is disruptionof both acromioclavicular ligaments as well as the coracoclavicular ligament.The latter case will allow elevation of the clavicle, as the entire suspensionof the shoulder has been disrupted. There is no strong evidence that grade IIIseparations do better with surgery than without if the patient is willing toaccept slight deformity at the end of the clavicle. Functionally the patientshould do fine from treatment with an arm sling for 3 to 6 weeks for comfort,with mobilization of the shoulder as early as possible and return to activity.Shoulder dislocations are separations of the humerus (the long bone of the upperarm) from the shoulder and are classified as either anterior or posterior.Anterior is by far the most common, at a ratio of 10:1. Fractures of the head,or top part, of the humerus may be associated with dislocations. A replacement(reduction) of the dislocation should be attempted as soon as possible. Musclespasm and pain will continue to increase the longer the dislocation is allowedto remain untreated.Anterior dislocations may be identified by comparison with the opposite side.The normal, smooth, rounded contour of the shoulder, which is convex on thelateral (outside) side, is lost. With anterior displacement the lateral contouris sharply rectangular and the anterior (or front) contour is unusuallyprominent. The arm is held away from the body, and any attempted movement willcause considerable pain. See figure 7–5.chpt_fig_035 [../Images/chpt_fig_035.jpg]Figure 7-5.A person with an anterior shoulder dislocation holds the arm away from the bodyand across the chest. Note the steep shoulder contour.A numb area located at the insertion of the deltoid muscle means that theaxillary nerve has been damaged. Numbness or tingling of the little finger couldmean ulnar nerve damage, while decreased sensation to the thumb, index, andmiddle finger may mean the radial nerve is injured. Th ese findings increase theurgency of attempting a reduction. Th e best method of reducing the anteriordislocation of the shoulder is the Stimson method. While other methods exist,this technique puts less force on the shoulder, which is particularly importantin case a fracture of the head of the humerus coexists with the dislocation. The technique is illustrated in figure 7-6. After reduction has been obtained, thearm is placed in a sling and a swathe is wrapped around the arm and chest tohold the arm against the body for 3 weeks. Mobilization too soon after reductionwill result in a weak, unstable shoulder. In a young person this sling andswathe may be maintained for 4 weeks prior to range-of-motion exercise. Holdingthe position longer than 4 weeks will not reduce the chance of recurrentdislocation, while holding it there longer may result in a frozen shoulder.chpt_fig_036 [../Images/chpt_fig_036.jpg]Figure 7-6.The Stimson method of replacing a dislocated shoulder. Using a wide cloth, wrapthe forearm several times. Attach this wrap to a bucket or bag filled with 10 to15 pounds of rocks and allow gravity to do the rest. It will take 20 minutes.SHOULDER BLADE [nav.xhtml#sub171]Fractures of the shoulder blade (scapula) are generally due to major trauma, andthe patient may also require treatment for multiple fractures of the ribs,punctured lung (pneumothorax), or heart contusion. A direct blow to the scapulamay fracture it without these other injuries. Diagnosis is difficult without anX-ray, but suspicion may be high if there is point tenderness to palpation overthe scapula, particularly several days after the accident. An indication ofscapular fracture is Comolli’s sign, which is a triangular swellingcorresponding to the outline of the scapula. Treatment uses a sling and earlymobilization to prevent stiffening of the shoulder.UPPER ARM FRACTURES (NEAR THE SHOULDER) [nav.xhtml#sub172]The humerus is the upper bone of the arm. Fractures of the upper part (or head)of the humerus are most common in elderly people. Again, the shoulder will bevery painful. The classification of these fractures is made with X-rays, whichindicate that not only has a fracture occurred but also shows the number ofpieces in the fracture and whether angulation or displacement has transpired.Displacement or severe angulation frequently requires surgical repair, but oftenvery conservative measures are followed by the orthopedic specialist. Withoutaccess to X-ray or an orthopedic specialist, we have to treat all injuriesconservatively.Fractures of the upper humerus are associated with swelling and eventualbruising of the shoulder and upper arm, with gravity slowly causing the swellingand bruising to appear lower and lower down the arm. Severe pain will preventnormal movement of the shoulder, but some movement is frequently possible. Asfractures of the upper part of the humerus occur through bone that mends itselfreadily (cancellous bone), the final outcome is often more dependent uponlimiting the length of time of immobilization and starting proper physicaltherapy than it is upon the number of pieces or the separation and angulation.Conservative treatment will consist of a sling and swathe (figure 7-3). It isimportant in older individuals to mobilize the shoulder as soon as possible;otherwise adhesions form and a frozen shoulder will result. An X-ray would helpdetermine how much time should be allowed in the sling. This would range fromonly a few days to 4 or even 6 weeks for a four-part fracture with markeddisplacement. If the patient is over 30, the best rule of thumb when treatingwithout an X-ray is to mobilize and start physical therapy at 2 weeks. Ayoungster’s arm can be left in a sling for 4 weeks. The therapy should consistof range-of-motion movements, such as circular elephant trunk motions whilebending over and raising the arm in front, to the side, and toward the rear.Effort should be made to move the shoulder as if the patient were wiping hisbottom. The patient should do this on his own, without someone forcing his armthrough these motions.UPPER ARM FRACTURES (BELOW THE SHOULDER) [nav.xhtml#sub173]Fractures in the shaft beneath the head of the humerus will result in musclespasm, causing an overriding of the shafts of bone. This is prevented byapplying a hanging cast. This amounts to a weighted cast applied to the forearm,with a loop of cloth supporting much of the weight of the cast from around thevictim’s neck. Mobilization and physical therapy should be started in 2 weeks.It is not practical in a setting without X-ray to properly design and follow theresults of a hanging cast. Pain and apparent fracture of the humerus at theshoulder will probably have to be treated with a sling and swathe, with earlymobilization as mentioned above.Humeral shaft fractures take 2 to 4 months to heal. Located between the shoulderand the elbow, this type of fracture is best splinted with a cast thatorthopedic surgeons call a sugar tong splint. It amounts to a U-shaped plasterextending from the armpit around the elbow back up to the shoulder, molded tothe arm after reduction, and wrapped with an ace bandage. A SAM Splint can beused to construct a sugar tong splint, as in figure 7-7.Complete fractures of the shaft of the humerus will be very painful, making acrunching feel when the bone is gently stressed. Incomplete fractures will beexquisitely tender to touch. Several days after the injury, swelling andbruising will appear at the elbow and forearm. Humeral shaft fractures at apoint one-third of the way up from the elbow may cause damage to the radialnerve, thus causing numbness to the forearm, thumb, and index finger. Thisnumbness generally lasts from 3 to 6 months and will commonly resolve on itsown. Usually developing numbness is a serious consequence that reflects either atear or compression on a nerve. This is an area where the development of such anumb feeling is less cause for panic.chpt_fig_037 [../Images/chpt_fig_037.jpg]Figure 7-7.SAM Splint in sugar tong splint for a humerus midshaft fractureELBOW TRAUMA [nav.xhtml#sub174]Fractures of the humerus above the elbow are very treacherous, as bone fragmentsmay seriously injure the nerves or blood vessels at this location. Fractures ofthe elbow itself are similarly dangerous due to the possible damage to nerve,blood vessel, or articular surfaces of the bones in this joint. The immenseswelling associated with fractures or sprains at the elbow causes compressionthat frequently does more damage than sharp pieces of broken bone.Avoid splinting the elbow near a 90-degree angle. Allow the elbow to droop inthe sling with a posterior padding. Never wrap the elbow joint at the frontaspect—leave this area open to the air. It is compression in the front of theelbow joint, an area called the antecubital fossa, that frequently results inserious injury to the blood vessels and nerves. Surgical intervention with X-rayassistance is required, so back to the grid with you for this one to ensurenormal elbow function. Allowing the injured elbow to freeze into a 120-degreeposition may be the only treatment you can offer under long-term off-gridconditions.Dislocation of the elbow is most common in young adults. Fractures of the tip ofthe elbow (the coronoid process) frequently are involved but generally do notcause future problems.FOREARM FRACTURES [nav.xhtml#sub175]Forearm fractures in children can generally be treated by reducing under X-rayand plaster casting, while in adults they frequently are treated surgically.Neither option is available to the isolated wilderness inhabitant if evacuationis not possible. The position of splinting on forearm fractures differsdepending upon the location along the two bones, due to different forces uponthese bones from tendon and muscle attachments. This positioning can only beheld properly with tight-fitting plaster splints. Bone alignment can only befollowed through repeated X-rays. Therefore, it is obvious that a completelyfractured, unstable condyle can cause severe problems, as indicated above,primarily due to compression from associated bleeding on the neurovascularbundle. Reduction obviously should not be attempted if there is a chance ofbeing treated properly by an orthopedic specialist with X-ray equipment. Theappearance of the dislocated elbow is obvious when compared to that person’sother elbow. Some people have a sharper-looking elbow tip than the averageindividual. However, swelling and a particularly prominent, hard point behindthe elbow would indicate that a dislocation has transpired.Pain medication should be given to the victim to relax the muscles prior toattempting to reduce the dislocation. Figure 7-8 demonstrates the technique ofreducing an elbow dislocation.The ideal position after reduction of the elbow is at 90 degrees with aposterior plaster splint. However a 90-degree position is potentially dangerous,as swelling may compromise the circulation. If the pulses at the wrist aredecreased, then allow the elbow to droop as necessary to relieve thiscompression, possibly to a 120-degree position as described above. The reductionof a simple elbow dislocation is best maintained in the posterior splint for 3weeks, then start range-of-motion exercises. Soaking the elbow in warm waterabout 15 minutes prior to starting a gentle exercise program is helpful. Ifunusual deformity has resulted, or if the elbow is frozen, this may have to beaccepted under survival conditions until definitive surgery can be accomplished.Full and proper use of this elbow will probably never again be reestablished;even after delayed surgery a fracture of the forearm will very likely not healproperly when treated by crude techniques in an off-grid setting.chpt_fig_038 [../Images/chpt_fig_038.jpg]Figure 7-8.The Stimson method for reducing a dislocation of the elbow. This dislocationresults when the ulna is forced backward, so that the tip (olecranon) becomesvery prominent. Besides traction on the wrist, pushing on the olecranon aids inthe reduction.Most fractures of the forearm are not complete and unstable, however. They willheal nicely with protective splinting being the only required therapy. A stablecrack can be suspected from swelling and point tenderness to gentle fingerpalpation by the examiner along the radius and ulna, the two forearm bones.Under this circumstance a splint must be manufactured that will providestability so that this fracture can heal without danger of further trauma, as infigure 7-9. The bone will weaken during the healing process and additionaltrauma may turn this non-displaced fracture into an angulated mess. Pad thesplint well and provide a sling for at least 3 weeks. Keep splinted for a totalof 6 weeks, longer if point tenderness is still present. If point tendernessdisappears within a few days or at most 2 weeks, the injury was not a fracture,but simply a contusion, and the splint may be safely removed at that time.chpt_fig_039 [../Images/chpt_fig_039.jpg]Figure 7-9.Forearm splint technique with the SAM SplintFractures associated with deformity in the forearm provide the physician withtwo challenges: first, reducing the fracture, and second, maintaining itsposition with proper casting. Reduction of forearm fractures is generally doneby traction, increasing the angulation to engage the fracture ends, thenstraightening the bones prior to casting. This is done with anesthesia. Thesurvivalist had best splint deformed fractures of the forearm afterstraightening gross angulation with in-line traction. The splinted position willhave to be maintained for 8 weeks or longer, depending upon the disappearance oflocal tenderness. A well-padded splint may generally be applied in a firmmanner, immobilizing the elbow and wrist joints. Corrective surgery can beperformed later. It is best to avoid a manipulation that will be extremelypainful and unstable anyway.WRIST FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS [nav.xhtml#sub176]Wrist fractures and dislocations are common in young adults who extend theirarms and hands to help break a fall. The three most common problems arefractures of the navicular (or scaphoid) bone, dislocation of the lunate, andperilunate dislocation. (See wrist anatomy in figure 7-10.) Navicular fracturesfrequently do not heal even with appropriate casting.Dislocations of the lunate or of the remaining carpals from the lunate wouldideally be reduced, but without X-ray, experience, or at least local anesthesia,this is not possible. Symptoms of lunate dislocation would be pain in the wristand frequently numbness in the thumb, index, and middle fingers.There is pain with any attempt to move the wrist. An abnormal knob on the palmside of the wrist at the crease, when compared to the other wrist, should beobvious to palpation. The numbness described indicates pressure on the mediannerve from the dislocated navicular bone, and an attempt at reduction should bemade. As in figure 7-11, with the wrist in extreme dorsiflexion, apply tractionwhile attempting to push the lump back into position. The reduction often isaccompanied by an obvious pop.chpt_fig_040 [../Images/chpt_fig_040.jpg]Figure 7-10.Anatomy of the wrist bonesPerilunate dislocation will have similar symptoms and signs, with pain onattempted movement of the wrist and possible median nerve compression causingthumb, index finger, and middle finger numbness. The knob will not be present,but there will be a slight deformity of the back side of the wrist, sometimescalled a modified silver fork deformity, or hump at the upper side (dorsum) ofthe wrist. The technique of reduction is similar; apply traction to the wristand place your thumb firmly over the location of the lunate bone (just beyondthe end of the ulna) to hold the lunate in position as the wrist is thengradually flexed to bring the rest of the carpal bones down into proper positionwith the lunate and the ends of the radius and ulna. There is generally no snapwhen this occurs. The numb feeling should wear off within the next hour if thepressure has been removed from the median nerve.chpt_fig_041 [../Images/chpt_fig_041.jpg]Figure 7-11.Extreme dorsiflexion of the wrist. This is the position of the wrist used to aidin the reduction of lunate bone dislocation.chpt_fig_042 [../Images/chpt_fig_042.jpg]Figure 7-12.The thumb spica wrap and a thumb spica made with a SAM SplintNavicular (scaphoid) fractures will have pain on the thumb side of the wrist,and while the entire wrist will be sore to palpation, it will be particularlysore below the thumb at the wrist. This fracture seldom dislocates, but it oftendoesn’t heal, even after being placed in a tight plaster cast for severalmonths.After attempting to reduce a dislocation of the wrist or treat the possiblefracture of the navicular, splint the wrist and thumb so they are as immobile aspossible. While it is not a rigid dressing, a thick wrap using a 2-inch Aceelastic bandage applied in the manner called a thumb spica, as illustrated infigure 7-12, can do well. Under survival conditions, fusion, arthritis, and evenloss of median nerve function may have to be accepted. This is a terrible lossthat proper orthopedic treatment can almost always avoid. The thumb spica wrapwill also be adequate for sprains of the wrist and thumb.THUMB SPRAINS AND FRACTURES [nav.xhtml#sub177]Injuries causing severe pain and swelling of the thumb may be sprains orfractures. A severe sprain will cause loss of strength of the thumb for manyweeks, even months. Swelling can be substantial with either injury. First aidmanagement is splinting until treatment by a physician can be arranged. In anextended survival situation, reduce any obvious deformity and hold in positionwith a thumb spica wrap, as in figure 7-12. Severe sprains and all fractureswill take 8 weeks to heal. There is risk of arthritis and loss of functiondepending upon the injury, patient’s age, adequacy of reduction, and suitabilityof your splinting technique.HAND FRACTURES [nav.xhtml#sub178]A hand fracture of the first metacarpal can be treated with a thumb spica wrap(see figure 7-12) that immobilizes the entire wrist. The fifth metacarpal is themost commonly broken bone in the hand. The name given to this fracture, a“boxer’s fracture,” indicates its frequent method of origin. Perfect reductionof this fracture is not required; in fact, up to 30 degrees of angulation isacceptable. Only 5 to 10 degrees of angulation is acceptable in the third andfourth metacarpals.Measuring the amount of angulation will be impossible without an X-ray. If youare used to seeing these fractures, before-and-after X-rays become merely alegal maneuver and are not medically necessary. In a survival situation one maybe able to tell if too much angulation has occurred by palpating the palm of thehand. If the nodular head of the metacarpal is felt where it joins the finger,there may be too much angulation. If too much angulation is allowed, a lump inthe palm of the hand will make holding tools and objects uncomfortable for therest of the patient’s life. Unacceptable angulation will have to be snapped backinto place. Splinting should be maintained in a position of function for 6weeks.FINGER FRACTURES AND SPRAINS [nav.xhtml#sub179]Gross lateral or sideways deviations of fingers should be corrected, and thefinger splinted in the position of function. These deviations may be correctedby tugging and thus resetting the fracture, or by placing a pencil or similarobject between fingers and thus getting leverage to snap a deviated finger shaftback into place. Deviations at the joints probably represent dislocations, andgenerally these may be easily reduced by the tugging technique. An alternatetechnique to tugging is to place the dislocated joint into partial flexion; itwill then be easier to lever the joint into position.Swelling associated with “jammed” fingers can become permanent if use of thefinger is allowed before adequate healing has taken place. After the acuteinjury, splinting in the position of function is always appropriate for at least3 weeks, followed by “buddy splinting” to the adjacent finger for another 2 to 3weeks. Fingers should not be splinted straight. Buddy splinting may be usedinitially if the victim must use the hand immediately, as in gardening, woodcutting, or chores that require all hands on deck.Ruptured tendons can be repaired generally by splinting in a position offunction, with the exception of a rupture of the distal extensor tendon of afinger. This injury is rather common and can be caused by an object hitting thetip of the finger or catching the finger in something (often in a sheet whilemaking a bed). While making beds may not be a problem you expect to encounter,this illustrates how easily the injury may occur. Figure 7-13 illustrates theappearance of this injury, commonly called a mallet finger deformity. Thesplinting technique for this injury is not the position of function, but asillustrated in figure 7-14.chpt_fig_043 [../Images/chpt_fig_043.jpg]Figure 7-13.Mallet finger deformity from ruptured distal extensor tendonchpt_fig_044 [../Images/chpt_fig_044.jpg]Figure 7-14.Splint technique for the ruptured distal extensor tendonHIP DISLOCATION AND FRACTURE [nav.xhtml#sub180]Hip injuries are very serious. Tremendous blood loss occurs internally.Fractures of the hip cause pain in the anterior medial aspect (front and side)of the thigh. Dislocations in younger people may be associated with fractures;in older people fractures are very common and are the probable cause of thedeformity. See figure 7-15 for positions of fracture and dislocation.Posterior dislocation of the hip is more common in healthy young adults comparedto central fracture/dislocation and anterior hip dislocation. All these injuriesare infrequent when compared, for instance, with dislocation of the shoulder.Posterior dislocations can cause injury to the sciatic nerve, the main nerve ofthe leg. This can cause shooting pains down the back of the leg and/or numbnessof the lower leg. It is most important that reduction of the dislocation not bedelayed longer than 24 hours. Muscle relaxants and pain medication must begiven. To reduce, place the victim on her back with the knee and hip in a90-degree position. The line of the femur should point vertically upward. Thethigh should be pulled steadily upward while simultaneously rotating the femurexternally, as shown in figure 7-16.If possible, evacuate this patient back to the grid. For evacuation purposes,pad well and buddy splint to the other leg. This victim is a litter case.Continued pressure on, or severe injury to, the sciatic nerve will cause musclewasting and loss of sensation to practically the whole leg. This damage must besurgically repaired as soon as possible. In the extreme case of survival withoutpossible repair, brace the affected leg to allow mobility by the victim and takecare of numb skin areas to prevent sores and infection.Central fracture/dislocations result when the head of the femur is driventhrough the socket into the pelvis. As in all orthopedic injuries, an X-ray isalmost essential for the diagnosis. If the fragments can be replaced surgically,this is the treatment of choice. In the extreme survival situation (when thereis no hope of medical care for many months), this injury can be left alone andstill result in a stable and relatively painless joint. Light traction can beapplied to the lower leg for comfort. After 3 weeks, ambulation with crutches,gradually increasing weight, can be encouraged. Range-of-motion exercises shouldbe started from the beginning to help mold the healing fragments into arelatively smoother joint surface. Sciatic nerve injury should not occur withthis injury, but an arthritic joint will result.chpt_fig_045 [../Images/chpt_fig_045.jpg]Figure 7-15.(A) Typical appearance of a fractured hip, (B) typical appearance of a posteriorhip dislocation, and (C) typical appearance of an anterior hip dislocationAnterior dislocation results from forceful injuries such as airplane crashes andmotorcycle accidents. Examination of the lower leg demonstrates considerablelateral rotation, or outward tilting, of the foot when the victim is lying onhis back. Reduction is as described under posterior dislocation, with tractionon the flexed limb but combined with medial rotation, or rotating the limbinward rather than outward.chpt_fig_046 [../Images/chpt_fig_046.jpg]Figure 7-16.Reduction of the posterior hip dislocation, providing upward traction on the hipwhile flexed to 90 degrees (A) and rotating externally (B)THIGH FRACTURES [nav.xhtml#sub181]Fractures of the thigh (femur) can, of course, occur from the hip to the knee.They are classified and treated by the orthopedic specialist differentlyaccording to the location of the break.First aid treatment consists of treating for shock and immobilizing, initiallyusing hand traction splinting. Start by providing pain relief with gentlehands-on in-line traction. Traction splinting is initially helpful, as spasmsfrom the powerful muscles in this region cause considerable overriding of bonefragments, increasing the extent of the injury. Traction also reestablishes thenormal length and configuration of the musculature and tightens the membranesthat surround the muscle (the fascia), which very importantly decreases thebleeding that occurs with this injury.The amount of pull required is minimal due to Pascal’s law of hydrodynamics. Itindicates that any change in pressure applied at any point in the fluid istransmitted undiminished throughout the fluid. As the thigh is a closedcylinder, the massive bleeding that occurs with a fractured femur will have atamponade applied by lengthening, ever so slightly, the sack of fascia or tissuecovering the muscle and broken bone. This elongation of a slight sphere intomore of a cylinder reduces the surface area of the sphere into that of acylinder, but the volume of blood inside remains the same. Thus, through themagic of Pascal’s law, there is a significant increase in the deep tamponade onthe bleeding bone and muscle tissues with even slight traction. Partial painrelief is the guide by which you will generally know how much pull to exert.This traction is initially performed by pulling on the ankle/foot gently inline, with the patient lying on their back.The patient should do quite well with simple buddy splinting to the other legduring litter transport. The best traction method for the person in a fixed campsituation is to have them on a throughly padded and comfortable bed with a footboard rigged to accept a sash tied around the ankle with an appropriate tug(about 2 pounds [1.6 kilograms] of tug). A person kept in bed with a tractionsplint will be at a higher risk of developing leg blood clots(thrombophlebitis). Initially, bleeding into the leg muscle is your biggestconcern. Coupled with severe pain, this can lead to shock. After a few days,bleeding is less of a concern, but developing a blood clot in an immobilizedpatient is one. At that time, it is appropriate to start aspirin, 81 mg per day.If you have the 325 mg aspirin, give one initially and then 1 every 2 days.After the traction splinting period, buddy splint with non-weight-bearingambulation. A fractured femur will take 8 to 12 weeks to firmly stabilize.KNEECAP DISLOCATION [nav.xhtml#sub182]The kneecap (patella) usually dislocates laterally, or to the outside of theknee. This dislocation results in a locking of the knee with a bump to one side,making the diagnosis obvious. Relocate the patella by flexing the hip and theknee. When straightening the knee, the patella usually snaps back into place byitself. If not, just push it back into place while straightening the knee on thenext try. Splint with a tube splint (closed-cell foam sleeping pad) with theknee slightly flexed. This patient should be able to walk to the base camp. Nofurther care will be necessary in an off-grid situation, except physical therapyperformed by attaching a light weight (4 pounds [1.8 kilograms]) to the ankleand having the person sit with the leg dangling and repeatedly extending theknee. This exercise strengthens the quadriceps muscle, providing the chance fortightening the patella when under actual use stress against the knee joint andallowing less laxity, decreasing the chance of future dislocations. An on-gridorthopedic referral for recurrent patella dislocations is appropriate to repairthe torn capsule for better ensured stability.KNEE SPRAINS, DISLOCATIONS, AND FRACTURES [nav.xhtml#sub183]The initial care of sprains, or acute joint injuries, is described on page 159[Chapter07.xhtml#page_159]. If the pain in the knee is severe, several diagnosesare possible. There may be tears of ligaments, tendon, cartilage, or synovialmembranes. There may be associated dislocations or fractures. All you really canassess is the amount of pain that the patient is experiencing, and you have totake his word for that. You can visually assess the amount of swelling ordeformity and that might tell the tale, but the most important aspect of carewill be handling pain as the patient interprets it.Have the patient lie as comfortably as possible. Apply RICE (see page 160[Chapter07.xhtml#page_160]) to the knee. In case of significant pain orswelling, remove the boot (weather permitting) and check the pulse on top of thefoot (the dorsal pedal pulse); question the victim about sensation in the feet.Check the dorsal pedal pulse on the opposite side for comparison. If the injuryappears minor, this is not necessary.Significant deformity means that a dislocation may have occurred. Seriousdisruption of the blood vessels and nerve damage can happen. Check the pulsesand for sensation in the foot. If these are all right, splint the knee as itlies. If not, have a helper hold the lower thigh while you grip the ankle withone hand and the calf with the other. Use in-line traction while you gently flexthe knee to see if you can reposition it better. If the pain is too great, youmeet resistance, or you cannot do it, splint in the most comfortable positionand evacuate as soon as possible back to the grid. If there is no grid returnpossible, then you MUST succeed with reduction technique just described.Even without obvious deformity, an immediate complaint, or continuing complaint,about significant pain means that you now have a litter case, and you shouldmake plans accordingly. If in 2 hours, the next morning, or 2 days later, thepatient feels better and wishes to walk on the knee, great! Let it happen. Youhad best remove all weight from the patient’s shoulders and provide a cane touse on the side opposite the injury. This places a more natural force vector onthe injured joint. Continue the compressive dressing. After 2 days beginapplying heat packs during rest stops and in the evenings. The patient’sperception of pain should be the key to managing these injuries, although thisapproach can be complicated by varying pain thresholds, from macho to wimp.ANKLE SPRAINS, DISLOCATIONS, AND FRACTURES [nav.xhtml#sub184]Generally, fractures of both sides of the ankle (a tibula-fibula fracture) areassociated with a dislocation. The severe pain associated with the fracture isan early indication that this patient is a litter case. Splint the ankle with asingle SAM Splint, or form a trough of Ensolite foam and tape it on. The latteris not a walking splint, but if the pain is significant enough, the patientisn’t walking anyway. A flail ankle, caused by complete disruption of the ankleligaments, readily slops back into position and can be held in place with atrough splint of Ensolite padding.Allow the patient to rest after the injury, before attempting to walk on theankle. If there is severe pain, it might be broken or badly sprained. Eitherway, if the pain is too severe, the patient won’t be walking—at least not untilit quiets down. As with the knee, if the pain diminishes enough that the victimcan walk, allow him to do so without carrying equipment but using a cane foradded support and decreased weight-bearing.FOOT INJURIES [nav.xhtml#sub185]Stubbed toes can be buddy splinted to provide pain relief. If they have beenstubbed to the extent that they deviate at crazy angles sideways, they should berepositioned before buddy taping. Place a pencil (or a similar-width object) onthe side opposite the bend, and use it as a fulcrum to help snap the toe backinto alignment. Blood under the toenail can be treated as described on page 146[Chapter06.xhtml#page_146].Severe pain in the arch of the foot or in the metatarsals can representfractures or sprains. Apply RICE as described for Knee Sprains, Dislocations,and Fractures on page 189 [Chapter07.xhtml#page_189]). Allowing a little time tolapse before use might result in decreased pain in minor injuries, but it wouldtake weeks for a fracture to decrease in severity. Reduce the patient’s weightload and provide a cane. If the foot swells to the extent that the boot cannotbe placed on the foot, consider cutting it along the sides and taping the bootcircumferentially around the ankle to hold it on. This provides support for thefoot, ankle, and the patient’s favorite on-grid retailer.CHEST INJURIES [nav.xhtml#sub186]Broken ribs may develop after a blow to the chest. Even a severe cough or sneezecan crack ribs! Broken ribs have point tenderness or exquisite pain with thelightest touch over the fracture site. The pain at this site will be reproducedby squeezing the rib cage in such a manner as to put a stress across thefracture site. Deep breathing will also produce pain at that location.It is not necessary to strap or band the chest, except that such a band mightprevent some rib movement and make the patient more comfortable. It is veryimportant for the patient to breathe and have some cough reflex to aid inpulmonary hygiene, namely to prevent the accumulation of fluid in the lungs,which can rapidly lead to pneumonia. For that reason, emergency departments donot discharge patients with compression rib belts. However, if I fracture a rib,I will definitely want one. Simply tying a large towel or undershirt around thevictim’s chest should suffice. A fractured rib takes 6 to 8 weeks to heal. Asimilar pain may initially be present due to a tear of the inter-costal musclesor separation of cartilage from the bone of the rib near the sternum orbreastbone. These problems are treated as above. They heal much more quickly,generally in 3 to 5 weeks.If several adjacent ribs are broken in more than one location, a section of thechest wall is literally detached and held in place by the muscles and skin. Thissection of the chest wall can bulge out when the patient exhales instead ofcontracting as the chest would normally do. It can also move in when the rest ofthe chest expands during inhalation. This paradoxical motion of the chest wallis called a flail chest. Treatment includes placing an adequately sized rolledcloth against the flail portion to stabilize the motion. This cloth roll willhave to be bound in place.Treat all of the above conditions with pain medication as described on page 31[Chapter03.xhtml#page_31]. Avoid unnecessary movement. Have the patient hold hishand or a soft object against his chest when coughing to prevent rib movementand decrease the pain. Allow the patient to assume the most comfortableposition, which is usually sitting up. If a fever starts, treat with anantibiotic such as Levaquin, 750 mg once daily.Broken ribs usually heal well even though considerable movement seems to occurdue to breathing or even flailing of the chest. They are always so painful thatpatients feel like they might puncture a lung at any minute. This does notusually happen, but if it does, there is a chance that air will leak into thechest cavity, causing a pneumothorax. This can lead to significant respiratorydistress, including cyanosis (blue discoloration of the skin due to inadequateoxygen in the blood). Crepitation can form in the skin. This is a cracklingsensation that is very noticeable to the examiner when running the fingers overthe skin in the upper part of the chest. It is not painful, but it indicatesthat air leakage and a pneumothorax have occurred. A pneumothorax can resolve onits own or it can expand, causing death. There is nothing you can do for thisunless you are trained in its management. Similarly, bleeding into lung tissuecan result in a hemothorax, which can either resolve on its own or progress todeath. Cyanosis with difficult breathing may also result due to this condition."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 [nav.xhtml#ch08]BITES AND STINGS [nav.xhtml#ch08]VENEMOUS STINGS [nav.xhtml#sub187]On grid or off grid, these things will find you. Stings from bees, wasps, yellowjackets, hornets, and fire ants—all members of the order Hymenoptera—producelesions that hurt instantly, and the pain lingers. The danger comes from thefact that some people are hyper-sensitive to the venom and can go intoimmediate, life-threatening anaphylactic shock.The pain of the sting can be alleviated by almost anything applied to the skinsurface. Best choices are cold compresses, hydrocortisone 1% cream, or thetriple antibiotic with pramoxine ointment from the Topical Bandaging Module.Oral pain medication—OTC or Rx—can be given as necessary. Delayed swelling canbe prevented and treated with oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, 25 mgtaken 4 times daily, from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module.A generalized rash, asthmatic attack, or shock occurring within 2 hours of asting indicates anaphylaxis, which requires special management.ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK [nav.xhtml#sub188]While most commonly due to insect stings, anaphylactic shock may result from aserious allergic reaction to medications, shellfish, and other foods—in fact,anything to which one has become profoundly allergic. Some non-stinging insectbites can also produce anaphylac tic shock, like bites from the cone-nosedbeetle (a member of the Reduviidae family), which can be found in California andthroughout Central and South America. We are not born sensitive to these thingsbut become allergic with repeated exposure. Those developing anaphylaxisgenerally have warnings of their severe sensitivity in the form of welts(urticaria) forming all over the body immediately after exposure, thedevelopment of an asthmatic attack with respiratory wheezing, or the onset ofsymptoms of shock.While these symptoms normally develop within 2 hours and certainly before 12hours, this deadly form of shock can begin within seconds of exposure. It cannotbe treated as indicated in the section on “normal” shock on page 13[Chapter02.xhtml#page_13]. The antidote for anaphylactic shock is a prescriptiondrug called epinephrine. It is available for emergency use in vials or thespecial automatic injectable syringe called the EpiPen; see figure 8-1.Automatic injection syringes are quite expensive. Vials of epinephrine are lessexpensive but will require an accurate small-barrel (1 cc) syringe to properlymeasure and inject. The normal dose for an adult is 0.3 cc of the 1:1000epinephrine solution given IM. This is quite easy to do, and even if a doselarger than 0.3 cc is administered (even twice that dose), it will cause no harmin either an anaphylaxis or asthma emergency. While it is not necessary to treatthe itchy, generalized rash, the epinephrine should be given if the voicebecomes husky (signifying swelling of the airway) and if wheezing or shockoccurs. This injection may have to be repeated in 15 to 20 minutes if thesymptoms return. The EpiPen Jr is available for use in patients weighing lessthan 66 pounds (30 kilograms) when the dose is 0.15 cc of the same solution.Antihistamines are of no value in treating the shock or asthmatic component ofanaphylaxis, but they can help prevent delayed allergic reactions. If you haveoral or injectable Decadron, give a 4 mg tablet or 4 mg injection for long-termprotection, as each dose of this medication lasts approximately 12 hours.On the grid evacuate anyone experiencing anaphylactic reactions even though theyhave responded to the epinephrine. They are at risk of the condition returning,and they should be monitored carefully over the next 24 hours. People can die ofanaphylaxis very quickly, even in spite of receiving aggressive medical supportin a hospital emergency department. Beyond 24 hours they are no longer at riskof an anaphylactic reaction. If the patient is still alive after that time,vital signs are stable, and there is no manifestation of anaphylaxis, theevacuation can be terminated.USE OF EPIPENThe EpiPen (figure 8-1) is an auto-injection system with two injection unitsavailable per box. It is available in adult and child doses. Using the EpiPeninvolves three simple steps: 1. Pull off the blue safety cap. 2. Place the orange tip on the outer thigh, halfway between the hip and knee (lateral side), preferably against the skin, but it can be used through thin clothing. 3. Push the unit against the thigh until it clicks, and hold it in place for a count of 10.Due to the high cost of this device, I suggest your physician prescribe vials ofepinephrine and appropriate syringes for administration. Vials are sealed glasscontainers or rubber-stopper sealed vials. The glass vial system will requireetching the ampule neck with a glass cutter and then snapping it off. Some glassvials are pre-etched and require only a careful snap to open. I always snapthese vials cuddled in a thin towel. Draw the fluid up in a small-gauge needleand give the shot IM.chpt_fig_047 [../Images/chpt_fig_047.jpg]Figure 8-1.The EpiPen is used to treat severe allergic reactions.SNAKEBITES [nav.xhtml#sub189]IDENTIFYING COMMON NORTH AMERICAN POISONOUS SNAKES [nav.xhtml#sub190]With regard to the visual identification of the most common poisonous snakes inNorth America, pit vipers take their name from the deep pit, a heat-receptororgan, between each eye and nostril. Most of them have triangular heads andcatlike vertical elliptical pupils.While not pit vipers, coral snakes (Micrurus fulvis, family Elapidae) also havevertical elliptical pupils. Some nonpoisonous snakes do as well. Colorvariations in coral snakes make the old saying “red on yellow can kill a fellow,red on black, venom lack” a very treacherous method of identification. This isparticularly true in Central and South America. Coral snake bites should betreated as described below under Neurotoxic Snakebites.The essential steps in treating snakebites are calm the victim, cause noadditional harm, decide about evacuation urgency, and arrange for appropriatelong-term wound care. The field first aid care of snakebites differs fornonpoisonous snakes, pit vipers (including rattlesnakes, cottonmouth/watermoccasins, and copperheads—all in the family Crotalidae), and neurotoxic snakes(coral snakes, cobras, green mambas, kraits, and all poisonous Australiansnakes, all the family Elapidae). That being said, the actual first aid care iseasy to accomplish and will generally depend on where geographically the snakebite occurs. Treat North American pit viper snakebites without compression, andtreat snakebites received elsewhere as neurotoxic bites requiring compressionand immobilization, as indicated below.Regardless of the type of snakebite, the first step is to calm the patient andtreat for shock. How do you calm a person who has just been bitten by a snake?Not surprisingly, just telling him to remain calm won’t work. In a remote areawhen something terrible has happened, it’s only your actions and demeanor thatwill provide comfort. Depending on the individual, you may need to treat forshock immediately, as described on page 13 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_13].All snakebites are puncture wounds, and nonpoisonous bites and “dry” NorthAmerican pit viper bites should be treated as indicated in the puncture woundsection on page 133 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_133]. Studies indicate that 20% ofeastern diamondback rattlesnake bites and 30% of cottonmouth/water moccasinbites are dry, which means no venom has been injected into the victim.SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF PIT VIPER BITE [nav.xhtml#sub191]What are the signs and symptoms of envenomation from pit vipers? The firstindication noted by many is a peculiar tingling in the mouth, often associatedwith a rubbery or metallic taste. This symptom may develop in minutes and longbefore any swelling occurs at the bite site. Envenomation also may produceinstant burning pain. Weakness, sweating, nausea, and fainting may occur witheither poisonous or nonpoisonous snakebites, due simply to the trauma of beingbitten. In case of envenomation, within 1 hour there will generally be swelling,pain, tingling, and/or numbness at the bite site. As several hours pass,bruising (ecchymosis) and discoloration of the skin begin and becomeprogressively worse. Blisters may form, which are sometimes filled with blood.Chills and fever may begin, followed by muscle tremor, decrease in bloodpressure, headache, blurred vision, and bulging eyes. The surface blood vesselsmay fill with blood clots (thromboses), and this can, in turn, lead tosignificant tissue damage after several days.TREATMENT OF PIT VIPER BITE [nav.xhtml#sub192]For rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water moccasins, treat for shock and calm thepatient as indicated above. Remove any constricting objects such as rings.Immobilize the injured part at heart level. And evacuate if you can.It has been said that the best snakebite kit is a set of car keys. The reason isthat envenomation can make a person very ill (on average seven people die yearlyin North America from these bites), and it can cause serious tissue damage thatis best treated with antivenin. There is a golden hour and a half before NorthAmerican pit viper venom causes significant generalized effects that might makethe victim nonambulatory. You might want to start walking the victim toward thenearest road to shorten the length of a litter evacuation, which will becomenecessary if his condition deteriorates. This walk out should be performed in acalm but urgent manner. Attempting to carry any but a very light individual willexcessively prolong it.Do not apply compression or a tourniquet to the swelling associated with thistype of bite because the venom causes considerable tissue damage from squeezingblood vessels, and further compression makes this effect worse. Do not applyice, as this results in increased local tissue destruction. Avoid the use of aconstricting band between the bite site and the heart, as this has never beenshown to be effective and there is a real danger of it being applied tootightly, resulting in a tourniquet effect that increases tissue destruction.If no grid exists, treat as indicated above: immobilization with the injuredpart at heart level. As most bites are dry bites or partial venom loads, thismay be all that one needs to do. If local swelling starts, slightly elevate thelimb to decrease pressure within it. Trunk and facial bites, while rare, areeven more of a challenge. Treat for shock, prevent hypothermia, and provideTylenol for pain, avoiding aspirin and anti-inflammatory medications. While theuse of steroids is not required in an on-grid hospital setting, without accessto care the use of steroids (Decadron, 4 mg every 12 hours for 3 days) probablyreduces inflammation.NEUROTOXIC SNAKEBITES [nav.xhtml#sub193]Coral snakes, all Australian snakes, and most African, Indian, and SouthAmerican snakes are all capable of injecting neurotoxins into their victim’ssystem with their bites. In 1979 Australia adopted pressure and immobilizationas the first aid treatment for the very dangerous snakes found on that continentand dropped their yearly death rate from snakebites to virtually zero. InAustralia the wound is not washed prior to wrapping, as special “snake venomdetection kits” are available at hospitals that can identify the snake fromvenom in the wound. The wound is not manipulated in any way; instead, pressureand immobilization is applied immediately as indicated in figure 8-2. Thepressure dressing works to slow the venom from migrating into the main body,allowing time for the antivenin to be acquired. Without antivenin, treat thepatient for shock (page 13 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_13]) and try to maintainbreathing with respiration-assisted breathing (see page 19[Chapter02.xhtml#page_19]); there is not anything else you can do. If you aremoving off the grid into Australia, India, or South America, poisonous animalencounters add a whole level of risk. (Also read below concerning neurotoxicvenom).chpt_fig_048 [../Images/chpt_fig_048.jpg]Figure 8-2.How to apply pressure/immobilization for neurotoxic snakebites:(A) Apply a broad pressure bandage over the bite site as soon as possible. Donot take off clothing, as any movement helps the venom enter the bloodstream.(B) The elastic bandage should be as tight as you would apply to a sprainedankle.(C) Extend the bandage as high as possible, wrapping over clothing if necessary.(D) Apply a splint to the leg.(E) Bind the splint to as much of the leg as possible.(F) For bites on hands or forearms: 1. Bind to elbow with bandage. 2. Splint toelbow. 3. Use sling.TREATMENT OF CORAL SNAKE BITES [nav.xhtml#sub194]North American coral snakes envenomate by a slow chewing process, so that arapid withdrawal from the attack may result in no envenomation. For treatment:(1) treat for shock as necessary, (2) wash the bitten area promptly to possiblyremove some venom, (3) make no incisions, (4) apply pressure/immobilization, and(5) evacuate to a hospital if possible. Since, like the cobra, the coral snakeis an Elapid family of snake, signs and symptoms of envenomation take time todevelop, and deterioration then proceeds so rapidly that the antivenin may be ofno avail. Without the possibility of evacuation, after initial care of the woundas above, allow the victim to rest with adequate protection from theenvironment. Just leave the compression dressing on, making sure that it is notacting as a tourniquet. If severe pulmonary symptoms develop, see paragraphbelow. Provide breathing assistance as long as possible.Cobra, Russell’s viper, green mamba, and krait bites outside of Australia resultin thousands of deaths yearly. While many areas of the world have a local sourceof antivenin for the species of snakes that are of concern in that locale, oftenthe antivenin may be inaccessible. The use of a class of compounds calledanticholinesterases can be lifesaving when dealing with neurotoxic envenomationsif no anti-venin is available. For physician use only, a suggested protocol isthe administration of 0.6 mg of atropine IV (0.05 mg/kg for children) to controlintestinal cramping, followed by 10 mg of Tensilon (0.25 mg/ kg for children).If there is improvement, further control of symptoms can be obtained bytitration of a dose of neostigmine, 0.025 mg/kg/hr by IV injection or continuousinfusion. Note: These medications are not included in the recommended RxInjectable Medication Module.INSECT BITES AND STINGS [nav.xhtml#sub195]SPIDER BITES [nav.xhtml#sub196]Generally, spiders will make a solitary bite, not several. If you wake withmultiple bites, you have probably collided with some other arthropod. While onlysome spiders are considered poisonous, all spiders have venom that can causelocal tissue inflammation and even slight necrosis or destruction. Most spidersare unable to bite well enough to inject the venom.BLACK WIDOW SPIDERThe black widow (Latrodectus mactans) is usually glossy black with a redhourglass mark on the abdomen. Sometimes the hourglass mark is merely a red dot,the two parts of the hourglass do not connect, or the coat is not shiny and itmay contain white. The bite may be only a pinprick, but generally a dullcramping pain begins at the site within 15 minutes, which may spread graduallyuntil it involves the entire body. The muscles may go into spasms and theabdomen becomes boardlike. Extreme restlessness is typical. The pain can beexcruciating. Nausea, vomiting, swelling of eyelids, weakness, anxiety(naturally), and pain on breathing may all develop. A healthy adult can usuallysurvive, with the pain abating in several hours and the remaining symptomsdisappearing in several days.An ice cube on the bite, if available, may reduce local pain. A specifictreatment for relieving muscle spasms is methocarbamol (Robaxin), 100 mg givenas a bolus into an IV line at 1 ml/min. After the initial bolus, a constantinfusion of 200 mg/hr IV, or 500 mg by mouth every 6 hours, can be used. Thismedication has not been included in the Off-Grid Medical Kit, but adequate painrelief can be given by using medications from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module,or Norco 10/325.Similar spiders are found throughout the world. The South African knoppie, theNew Zealand katipo, and the Australian red black spider bites have the samesymptoms and can all be treated as described above. A specific antivenin isavailable in those countries.BROWN RECLUSE SPIDERA brown coat with a black violin marking on the cephalothorax, or top part,identifies the brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa). The initial bite ismild and may be overlooked at the time. In an hour or two, a slight redness mayappear; by several hours a small bleb appears at the bite site. Sometimes thewound appears as a bull’s eye with several rings of red and blanched circlesaround the bite. The bleb ruptures, forming a crust, which then sloughs off; alarge necrotic ulcer forms, gradually enlarging. Over the first 36 hours,vomiting, fever, skin rash, and joint pain may develop, and hemolysis of theblood may be massive.Apply ice to the wound as soon as possible. Dapsone (a medication used in thetreatment of leprosy), 100 mg twice daily, has been used, but its effectivenessis unlikely. Dapsone, once thought to be effective during the early stages oftreatment to decrease the severity of the inflammation, is not included as aroutine component of the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module. Prophylactic use ofantibiotics does no good. Avoid the application of heat to this wound, eventhough it is inflamed and necrotic.Give ibuprofen, 200 mg, 4 tablets every 6 hours, to help with pain and to reduceinflammation. From the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module give Decadron, 4 mgevery 6 hours. It is doubtful that steroid therapy is of benefit after 24 hours.Apply triple antibiotic ointment from the Topical Bandaging Module and coverwith gel dressing.TICKS [nav.xhtml#sub197]More vector-borne diseases are transmitted in the United States by ticks than byany other agent. Ticks must have blood meals to survive their varioustransformations. It is during these meals that disease can be transmitted tohumans and other animals. Two families of ticks can transmit disease to humans:Ixodidae, or hard ticks, and Argasidae, or soft ticks. The life cycle of thehard tick takes two years to complete: from the egg to the six-legged larva orseed tick, the eight-legged immature nymph, and finally the eight-legged matureadult. They must remain attached for hours to days while obtaining their bloodmeal. Disease will not be transferred if the tick can be removed before 24hours. The soft ticks can live many years without food. They have severalnymphal stages and may take multiple blood meals. They usually stay attachedless than 30 minutes. Of the soft ticks, only the genus Ornithodoros transmitsdisease in the United States, namely relapsing fever. The 24-hour rule does notapply in this case.Preventing attachment is the best defense against tick-borne disease. DEETinsect repellents are very effective against ticks (see page 205[Chapter08.xhtml#page_205]). Permethrin 0.5% spray–treated clothing kills ticksupon contact and remains active on clothing for 2 weeks. Then it’s probablyabout time to wash those camping clothes anyway and respray them. Thecombination of permethrin on clothing and DEET on skin is 100% effective againsttick attachment. Insects are developing some resistance to permethrin and thebest current alternative is resmethrin, which is available for fogging, residualspraying, and clothing application.OK, so you didn’t follow my advice and you find a tick attached. How do youremove it? A tried-and-true method is to grasp the skin around the insertion ofthe tick (not the body) with a pair of fine-point tweezers and pull straightoutward, removing the tick and a chunk of skin. For some reason this doesn’thurt. A recent study has shown the effectiveness of three tick-removal productson the market in the United States, sold under the brand names of the OriginalTicked Off, the Pro-Tick Remedy, and the tick pliers, also sold under the nameTick Nipper. Hot wires, matches, glue, fingernail polish, Vaseline—none of themwork. Burning the tick might cause it to vomit germs right into the victim, yetit will not let go. Again, be careful not to grasp the tick body—crushing itmight cause germs to be injected into the victim.CATERPILLAR REACTIONS [nav.xhtml#sub198]The puss caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis) of the southern United States andthe gypsy moth caterpillar (Lymantria dispar) of the Northeast have bristlesthat cause an almost immediate skin rash and welt formation. Treatment includespatting the victim with a piece of adhesive tape to remove the bristles. Furthertreatment is discussed under Skin Rash on page 149 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_149].MILLIPEDE REACTIONS [nav.xhtml#sub199]Millipedes do not bite, but contact can cause skin irritation. Cold packs canreduce discomfort. Wash thoroughly and treat as indicated on page 149[Chapter06.xhtml#page_149].CENTIPEDE BITES [nav.xhtml#sub200]Some larger centipedes can inflict a painful bite that causes local swelling anda painful red lesion. Treatment with a cold pack is usually sufficient. Somebites are severe, and regional lymph node enlargement may occur, which will be aswelling of the nodes generally at the joints along the blood-flow patterntoward the heart from the bite site. Swelling at the bite location may persistfor weeks. Adequate treatment consists of pain medication. Infiltration of thearea with lidocaine 1% from the Rx Injectable Medication Module provides instantrelief and is justified in severe cases.MOSQUITOES [nav.xhtml#sub201]Mosquitos “see” by three different mechanisms: chemical sensors, visualspectrum, and infrared sensors. Countering these, we can use three protectivestrategies to prevent their bites: behavior, barrier, and chemical.Behavior is the least known, yet very important. Humans produce a carbon dioxideplume that travels up to 150 feet, depending upon the wind speed. If you cancamp where the wind blows your plume into a lake as opposed to the forest, youwill decrease mosquito bites. Once they pick up your plume, they will then use avisual spectrum to locate any brightly colored flower mimics. Avoid Hawaiianshirts when camping! Wear white or light colors. The green of a Scout uniform isOK. Wear long-sleeve shirts, long pants, and socks—all treated with permethrin.Once closer to you, mosquitos activate their chemical sensors to detect theby-product of your oil-gland secretions that are being degraded by common skinbacteria. The highest bacteria content on your skin is located in your armpitsand on your feet. Keeping clean decreases this smell and reduces bitessignificantly. When very near to you, they turn on their infrared sensor andhome in on the juiciest place to successfully chomp and get that delicious humanblood meal. Sounds like a scary campfire story, but it is true. You aresurrounded by tiny insect vampires that want to turn you into—if not the livingdead—real dead people with one of the many mosquito borne diseases of whichthere are many to choose. It has been estimated that simply using the abovetechniques can decrease mosquito bites by 85%.And third, we come to what most people regard as their primary means ofsuppressing insect bites: chemical. Treating your clothing before a trip with0.5% permethrin, a chrysanthemum derivative, is 100% effective in preventingtick bites. A tick crawls around on you before attaching. Treating clothing,including socks and underwear, solves tick disease problems. A single clothingtreatment lasts for 6 weeks. Mosquitos, however, require additional skinprotection for bite prevention. Generally, this can be achieved with 20%picaridin or DEET in concentrations of 30%, repeated as required. Lemoneucalyptus in 30% concentrations works almost as well. Other herbals, wristbands, and electronic devices do not match the effectiveness of those products.The best mosquito repellent invented to date has been DEET (n,ndiethyl-m-toluamide). This product has undergone a revolution since it wasdeveloped in 1946, ranging from the earliest preparations of 12% strength tonumerous products marketing 100% DEET concentration. Between 10 and 15% of DEETapplied to the skin surface is excreted in the user’s urine. This fact, coupledwith a few reports of convulsions in children using DEET (generally whensimultaneously sunburned) indicates we should probably minimize the total amountplaced on the skin.I never use 100% DEET except to soak either my head netting or a “bug jacket.”Bug jackets are a very loose weave of cotton fabric that soaks up DEET. Theloose weave allows air circulation, which is a real lifesaver during hot,mosquito-laden summer days. Buy one with a hood. Avoid buying the tight“no-see-um-proof ” mosquito suits, as you can sweat to death in them. Evenduring monstrous mosquito moments, it is possible to be relatively comfortablein a treated bug jacket. The hood can be pulled over your head when you areeating, and your cup or bowl brought very near your face so that you can gulpdown food that is relatively free of mired insects (except for those that fallinto the pot during the cooking process). Treat the bug jacket by pouring 100%DEET into a ziplock plastic bag and soaking the jacket overnight. Rather thanwearing tight-weave net pants, I find it best to treat my trousers withpermethrin, as indicated above, and my ankles or exposed legs with the DEET.Picaridin in 20% strength provides relatively good black-fly and mosquitoprotection for up to 8 hours.Adequate mosquito netting for the head and for the tent or cot while sleeping isessential. Spraying netting and clothing with 0.5% permethrin increases theeffectiveness of the netting and decreases bug bites enormously. Permethrin isan insecticide, not a repellent. It kills mosquitoes, ticks, and black flies,and does not simply chase them away. It will not work if applied to the skin, asan enzyme in the skin destroys it. Not only is there no absorption through theskin, it is safe to use on both natural and synthetic fibers.Vitamin B-1 (thiamine) is not an effective preventative oral agent. Electronicsound devices to repel these critters have never dented mosquito buzzing orbiting enthusiasm in the far north, in my experience.A considerable number of bites, or sensitivity to bites, may require anantihistamine, such as diphenhydramine, 25 mg capsules every 6 hours, from theNon-Rx Oral Medication Module. Triple antibiotic ointment with pramoxine appliedevery 6 hours can provide local itch relief, but that is only due to thepramoxine component. Triple antibiotic ointment by itself is of no value. Fromthe Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module, use Topicort 0.25% ointment twice daily,or Lanacane cream.BLACK FLIES [nav.xhtml#sub202]DEET compounds will work on black flies, but the concentration must be 30% orgreater, and even the pure formula will work for only a short time. It is bestto use a specific black-fly repellent.For years Skin So Soft, a bath oil marketed by your local Avon representative,has been mentioned as a black-fly repellent. It does work, but only poorly, andit requires frequent applications, approximately every 15 minutes.Netting and heavy clothes that can be sealed at the cuffs may be required. Allblack-fly species like to land and crawl, worming their way under and throughprotective clothing and netting. Spray clothing and netting with 0.5% permethrinas mentioned in the section on mosquitoes.Black-fly bites can result in nasty sores that are usually self-limited,although at times slow healing. If infection is obvious, treat as indicated inthe section on skin infection on page 152 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_152]. Treatsymptoms as indicated under Mosquitoes above.NO-SEE-UMS AND BITING GNATS [nav.xhtml#sub203]These two examples of insect life are the scourge of the north country, or anycountry in which they may be found. Many local people refer to any small blackfly as a “no-see-um,” but the true bug by that name is indeed very hard to see.They usually come out on a hot, sticky night. The attack is sudden and feelslike fire over your entire exposed body surface area. Under the carefulexamination of a flash-light, you will notice an incredibly small gnatstruggling with its head down, merrily chomping away. Make that bug portion ofthe previous sentence plural, please. You may need to resort to a strong productof 35% DEET or greater. Immersion in cold water will help relieve symptomstemporarily. One remedy for the sting, which I understand works quite well buthave never had it along to try, is an application of Absorbine Jr.!Gnats, on the other hand, are small black flies whose bite is seldom felt. Butthese gentle biters leave behind red, pimple-like lesions to remind you of theirvisit. A rash of these pimples around the neck and ankles attests to theirability to sneak through protective clothing. Treat bites as described aboveunder Mosquitoes. Without a head net or treated hooded bug jacket, hordes ofgnats can suffocate you. Treat clothing with permethrin and a bug jacket with100% DEET, as described in the Mosquitoes section.SCORPION STINGS [nav.xhtml#sub204]Most North American scorpion stings are relatively harmless. Stings usuallycause only localized pain and slight swelling. The wound may feel numb.Diphenhydramine, 25 mg 4 times daily, and Percogesic, 2 tablets every 4 hours,may be all that is required for treatment. A cold pack will help relieve localpain.The potentially lethal Centruroides sculpturatus is the exception to this rule.This yellow-colored scorpion lives in Mexico, New Mexico, Arizona, and on theCalifornia side of the Colorado River. The sting causes immediate, severe painwith swelling and subsequent numbness. The neurotoxin injected with this bitemay cause respiratory failure; respiratory assistance may be required (see page19 [Chapter02.xhtml#page_19]). Tapping the wound lightly with your finger willcause the patient to withdraw due to severe pain. This is an unusual reactionand does not occur with most insect stings. A specific antivenin is available inMexico and is also produced by the Poisonous Animals Research Laboratory atArizona State University for local use.In addition to the antivenin, atropine may be needed to reduce muscle cramping,blurred vision, hypertension, respiratory difficulty, and excessive salivation.Methocarbamol may be given, as described in the section on black widow spiderbites (page 200 [Chapter08.xhtml#page_200]). Neither of these medications isincluded in the Off-Grid Medical Kit. Avoid narcotics such as Demerol andmorphine, which can increase the toxicity. Percogesic from the Non-Rx OralMedication Module may be safely given.ANTS/FIRE ANTS [nav.xhtml#sub205]While many ants alert you to their presence with a burning bite, fire ants canproduce an intensely painful bite that pales the bite of any other ant—and manyother bugs—to insignificance. While holding on tightly with a biting pincer andpivoting around, the fire ant stings repeatedly in as many places as the stingercan reach, causing a cluster of small, painful blisters to appear. These cantake 8 to 10 days to heal. Treatment is with cold packs and pain medication.Large local reactions may require use of an antihistamine such asdiphenhydramine, 25 mg, 2 capsules every 6 hours, or even Decadron, 4 mg twicedaily. Local application of Spenco 2nd Skin can provide some relief. Treat withpain medication as required.The greatest danger is to the hypersensitive individual who may go intoanaphylactic shock; see page 193 [Chapter08.xhtml#page_193].AQUATIC STINGS, CUTS, AND RASHES [nav.xhtml#sub206]SEA URCHIN [nav.xhtml#sub207]Punctures from sea urchin spines cause severe pain and burning. Besides traumafrom the sharp spines, some species inject venom. The wound can appear red andswollen, or even blue to black from harmless dye that may be contained in thespines. Generalized symptoms are rare but may include weakness, numbness, musclecramps, nausea, and occasionally shortness of breath.The spines should be removed thoroughly, a very tedious process. Very thinspines may be absorbed by the body without harm, but some may form reactivetissue (granulomas) around them several months later. Spines may migrate intojoints and cause pain and inhibit movement, or lodge against a nerve and causeextreme pain. The discoloration of the dye causes no problems but may bemistaken for a thin spine. Relief may be obtained by soaking in hot water (110to 113°F or 43 to 45°C) for 20 to 30 minutes. Vinegar or acetic acid soaksseveral times a day may help dissolve spines that are not found. Evacuation andtreatment by a physician is also advisable if the grid is available.JELLYFISH [nav.xhtml#sub208]An extensive number of species of jellyfish in the world pose varying degrees ofdanger to people. Jellyfish tentacles in contact with human skin can cause mildpricking to burning, shooting, terrible pain. The worst danger is shock anddrowning.Pouring vinegar on the wound (4 to 6% acetic acid) inhibits the venom from beingfired into the skin. Alcohol (or ideally formalin) poured over the wound mayalso prevent the nematocysts from firing more poison. Avoid the use of hot waterin treating this injury, as water of any temperature activates the nematocysts.Try to remove the tentacles with gloved hands.Dust the area with a dry powder such as flour or baking powder. Gently scrapeoff the mess with a knife, clamshell, or other sharp instrument, but avoidcutting the nematocysts with a sharp blade. Apply hydrocortisone 1% cream 4times daily from the Topical Bandaging Module, or Topicort 0.25% ointment twicedaily from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module for inflammation. Severe stingscan be treated with pressure/immobilization. Provide rescue breathing asrequired.CORAL STINGS [nav.xhtml#sub209]These injuries are treated as indicated above under Jellyfish.CORAL AND BARNACLE CUTS [nav.xhtml#sub210]Clean the wound thoroughly. Trivial wounds can later flare into real disastersthat may go on for years. Scour it thoroughly with a coarse cloth or soft brushand surgical scrub or soapy water. Then apply hydrogen peroxide to help bubbleout fine particles and bacteria. Apply triple antibiotic ointment from theTopical Bandaging Module. Manage this wound as discussed in the section on theBleeding Wound (page 118 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_118]). If an infection ensues,treat as indicated under Cellulitis on page 148 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_148].STINGRAY [nav.xhtml#sub211]The damage is done by the stingray’s barbed tail, which lacerates the skin,embedding pieces of tail material and venom into the wound. The wound bleedsheavily; pain increases over 90 minutes and takes 6 to 48 hours to abate.Immediately rinse the wound with seawater and remove any particles of the tailsheath that are visible, as these particles continue to release venom. Hot wateris the treatment of choice, applied as soon as possible and as hot as thepatient can stand (110 to 113°F, or 43 or 45°C). The heat will destroy the toxinrapidly and remove the pain that the patient is experiencing. After hot waterhas been applied and all tail particles removed, the wound may be closed withtaping techniques (see page 126 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_126]). Elevation of thewound is important. If it’s particularly dirty, leave the wound open andcontinue to use intermittent hot soaks as described on page 134[Chapter06.xhtml#page_134].Questionably dirty wounds should be treated with Levaquin, 750 mg daily, ordoxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module. Asthese are nasty, painful wounds, treat for shock from the onset (see page 13[Chapter02.xhtml#page_13]).CATFISH [nav.xhtml#sub212]Apply hot water as indicated above under Stingray. The wound, caused by apuncture from spines in the fish’s dorsal and pectoral fins protruding near itsmouth, must be properly cleaned and irrigated using surgical scrub, ifavailable, or soap. Place the patient on oral antibiotics for several days todecrease the chance of wound infection, which is common with this injury. Treatan infected wound as described on page 147 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_147].SCORPION FISH [nav.xhtml#sub213]Scorpion fish spines have poisonous venom located in their fins, which usuallycause wounds when unwary individuals step on them or otherwise accidentallycontact them with their hands. Use the same treatment as above under Stingray.SPONGE RASH [nav.xhtml#sub214]Sponges handled directly from the ocean can cause an allergic reaction thatappears immediately. Fine spicules may also break off in the outer layer ofskin, causing inflammation. It will be difficult to tell whether your victim issuffering from the allergic reaction or the spicules, or both. Soak the affectedskin by applying vinegar to a cloth and covering it for 15 minutes. Dry the skinand pat with the adhesive side of tape to remove any sponge spicules. Again,soak in vinegar for 5 minutes. An application of rubbing alcohol for 1 minutehas been suggested. Then apply hydrocortisone 1% cream 4 times a day from theTopical Bandaging Module, or Topicort 0.25% ointment twice daily from the RxOral/Topical Medication Module for several days, until the inflammationsubsides."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 [nav.xhtml#ch09]BIOTERRORISM AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE [nav.xhtml#ch09]While there are many reasons to leave the grid, there are also multiple issuesthat might cause the grid to collapse right out from under you. While we usuallythink of issues like economic collapse, conventional or nuclear war, massivenatural disasters from weather or violent nature, a less considered potential isbioterrorism or natural biological catastrophe.Further, if you are moving into unfamiliar territory in your departure from yournormal habitat, you may be moving into an area with unusual environmental stressand very likely exposure to new endemic (locally available) infectious diseases.Initially you will probably not have immunity to these pathogens, and you mustbe prepared to prevent and/or treat yourself for these dangers. Please studythis section carefully during your planning phase so you can enter your new homebase fully prepared to diagnose and treat, or better yet, prevent, what may wellbe more dangerous than an attack by armed marauders. Of all of the naturalchallenges, the environmental stress issues will be the most dangerous, and theyare covered in chapter 10 [Chapter10.xhtml]. That is not to say that bites,stings, and injuries are not potentially lethal, but these issues are usuallyvery apparent to the survivalist, much more so than the plethora of tinypathogens that can also prove debilitating or lethal.Diagnosing an illness can sometimes be made by noting the time of symptom onsetafter being exposed to the illness in question. This is most feasible when youfirst move into a completely foreign environment and an illness suddenly appearswithin your group. Otherwise, after being in an area for more than severalmonths, or when dealing with indigenous people in that area, you are going torely on knowing what diseases are the most prevalent and evaluate symptoms towork out a probability of what you are treating. Sir William Osler, one of thegreatest teachers of medicine, gave a lecture at the Harvard Medical School inwhich he stated that of the three basic principles of medicine, the mostimportant was diagnosis. After the lecture he was asked, “What are the other twoprinciples?” he answered, “The first is diagnosis, the second is diagnosis, andthe third is diagnosis.” Putting this into perspective, let us say that it ispitch black out and a fierce, deadly enemy of unknown number is approaching ourperimeter. We would probably resort eventually to spreading a vast quantity ofpowerful ammunition in his general direction. The more powerful our ammunition,the greater the chance of our neutralizing this enemy. We have ammunition whenit comes to fighting infectious diseases. We have antibiotics, antivirals,antiparasitics, and medications to treat symptoms, all of which can belifesaving. But the ammunition we use is a two-edged sword: It will not work onthe wrong target, side effects can be more dangerous than some illnesses we aretreating, and we will always have a limited supply. Correctly identifying thediagnosis is as critical as correctly identifying that target.So, what is the approach to infectious disease?Identify the potential geographic risk of the diseases; where are they lurking?Let’s look at the vector that spreads the disease; how do we block it fromattacking us? If someone gets ill, how do we identify the most likely cause andwhat is the best treatment available to us? That is what this chapter is about,and you can see why it is important in your planning, particularly if you areleaving the grid.Tables summarize the diseases of North America (table 9-2) and high-riskillnesses and diseases encountered in world travel (table 9-3) where you findyourself when leaving your normal habitat. The individual sections of thischapter discuss these diseases in greater detail, including treatments whenusing the items suggested for the Off-Grid Medical Kit. Management of issuessuch as pain, fever, vector control, water purification, and other preventativemeasures are covered elsewhere in this book and also must be consideredimportant to preventing and managing these diseases.Bioterrorism is when one of these diseases is brought to you. Some of theseillnesses are rarely seen in North America; others are here but seldomencountered. Some diseases are returning in force due to low immunization rates.The US government classifies potential bioterrorism agents/diseases into threecategories:Category A 1. Can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person 2. Result in high mortality rates 3. Might cause public panic and social disruption 4. Require special action for public health preparationCategory B 1. Are moderately easy to disseminate 2. Result in moderate morbidity and mortality 3. Require special enhancements of CDC’s diagnostic capacity and enhanced surveillanceCategory C 1. Availability 2. Ease of production and dissemination 3. Potential for high morbidity and mortality rates and major health impactDiseases found naturally in North America that are considered category A areplague (page 232 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_232]) and tularemia (page 241[Chapter09.xhtml#page_241]), and in category B are typhus fever (page 242[Chapter09.xhtml#page_242]) and various food and water-borne diseases (pages 218[Chapter09.xhtml#page_218]–242 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_242]). Other category Adiseases such as anthrax (the last case in the US was in 1976), botulism (causedby poor food preservation), and smallpox (now extinct from the world except incertain US and Russian laboratories), are not something you will encounterunless there is a mass bioterrorism release. The viral hemorrhagic fevers arealso in this category (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Machupo viruses). Category Bagents encountered naturally are brucellosis, glanders, melioidosis,psittacosis, and Q fever—again, diseases that are so rare as to be insignificantin the normal experience of a prepper.This takes us back to the issue of a mass terrorism release of the rarediseases. Your greatest risk comes not from the weaponized dispersal of adisease, but from nature effectively accomplishing identical results. Includedin this group are the diseases listed in tables 9-1 and 9-2, below, and thechildhood diseases that are reappearing because decreased immunization rateshave resulted in the loss of “herd immunity,” the percent of a population that,when immune from an illness, will interrupt the spread of that illness throughthe remaining, even nonimmune, population. If a certain percentage of a grouploses its herd immunity, a single case can spread like wildfire through theentire group, infecting even those who have some immunity due to theoverwhelming number of germs that a massive flare in the infection causes.Depending upon how virulent the germ is and how easily it spreads, variouslevels of immunity must be present to prevent this “wildfire” spread.Table 9-1. Importance of Herd Immunity in Preventing Disease Spread within aGroup Transmission Herd immunity required Measles Airborne 92–95% Pertussis(whooping cough) Airborne droplet 92–94% Diphtheria Saliva 83–86% RubellaAirborne droplet 83–86% Smallpox Airborne droplet 80–86% Polio Fecal–oral route80–86% Mumps Airborne droplet 75–86% SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)Airborne droplet 50–80% Ebola Bodily fluids direct contact 33–60% InfluenzaAirborne droplet 33–44%It is interesting that some of the most dangerous diseases have a relatively lowherd immunity required for the group protection from disease acceleration. Ebolahas a high case-fatality rate of 60 to 90% in the case of the Zaire strain and40 to 60% in the Sudan variety. But for potential number of deaths on theplanet, it is hard to beat the danger of influenza. An aggressive strain ofinfluenza could reach a mortality rate of 2 .5%, but as the disease spreadseasily among non-immune persons, where virtually everyone catches it (unlikeEbola, which no one should catch with simple body fluid precautions), the deathtoll can be astounding.Sometimes herd immunity does not protect you from a disease like tetanus, as youcatch this from spores when they enter your body via the skin from theenvironment and not from another person.A bioterrorism release of a germ will not collapse the grid, but a grid collapsefrequently causes a massive infectious breakout of the various waterbornediseases, including typhoid fever and cholera. If the grid is intact during abioterrorist release, it would require and can rely on the expertise of the CDCand US Department of Homeland Security to respond with appropriate guidance andtreatment, including specialized vaccine. In my opinion, the prepper needs toprevent and manage the diseases listed in this book. Prevention is simple,basic, and critical. It consists of proper hygiene (washing hands), proper watersourcing, proper food preparation and storage, proper insect protection, andproper immunizations. Beyond the commonly recommended infant, childhood, andadult immunizations, the prep-per should consider typhoid, as it commonlyexplodes during natural disasters. The grid will withstand a bioterrorism attackbut is vulnerable to many natural and human-made events, including nuclearwarfare (chapter 4 [Chapter04.xhtml]), and it is those issues that the preppermust calculate into the survival equation.Table 9-2.

It is transmitted primarily from theblack-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the western black-legged tick (Ixodespacificus). Symptoms including fever, headache, chills, and muscle aches occurwithin 1 to 2 weeks of a tick bite. Lab tests can eventually confirm thediagnosis, but symptoms are similar to the other tick-borne diseases. Thefirst-line treatment for adults and children of all ages is doxycycline.BABESIOSIS [nav.xhtml#sub217]First discovered in Yugoslavia in 1957 and detected in the United States in1968, this malaria-like illness is caused by a protozoan parasite that invadesred blood cells. Two species have been identified, Babesia microti in thenortheastern United States, and B. equi in California. An unidentified speciescaused this disease in a patient in Washington State. Of the approximately 2,000cases reported in the United States, 95% were reported in Connecticut,Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.Tick-borne transmission of Babesia parasites is well established in thesestates.Symptoms begin gradually 1 week after a tick bite with fatigue and loss ofappetite, giving way in several days to fever, drenching sweats, muscle aches,and headache. The illness ranges from mild to severe, with death occurring inabout 10% of patients. Treatment is available with oral quinine plus clindamycin(not included in the recommended medical kit). Protection from tick bites isbest accomplished by treating clothing with permethrin (see page 202[Chapter08.xhtml#page_202]).BLASTOMYCOSIS [nav.xhtml#sub218]This infectious disease is caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis.Outbreaks usually cluster, with multiple members of a party becoming ill. It isfound in the Mississippi River Valley and the southeastern United States. It isalso found in various parts of Africa. Wisconsin may have the highest incidenceof blastomycosis of any state, with yearly rates ranging from 10 to 40 cases per100,000 persons in some northern counties. In the United States it has beenassociated with beaver lodges and digging in contaminated soil. It can alsoresult from dog bites.Onset of illness is slowly progressive, usually starting with a cough anddeveloping into pneumonia with fevers, shortness of breath, chest pain, anddrenching sweats. The symptoms generally present 3 weeks to 3 months afterbreathing in the fungal spores.Infected blood carries the fungus to the skin and other tissues. Skin lesionsenlarge with a collapsed center, purplish-red border, and frequent ulcerations.Treatment is with specific antifungal medications.CHIKUNGUNYA FEVER [nav.xhtml#sub219]This viral infection is spread by the Aedes mosquito (see Mosquitoes, page 204[Chapter08.xhtml#page_204]). Although not related to dengue fever, it is verysimilar clinically, with particularly miserable, virtually crippling jointaches, particularly of the ankles, wrists, and hands. Since it mimics dengue andZika virus, it is best to avoid treating with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorymedications such as ibuprofen or aspirin, as there can be bleeding complicationswith these diseases. Use Tylenol or Ultram for pain management. The painfuleffects of this disease can last for months.CHOLERA [nav.xhtml#sub220]This intestinal infection, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, producesprofuse, cramping diarrhea. Death can come from dehydration; indeed, the deathtoll can reach the tens of thousands during an epidemic. Ingestion of watercontaminated with the bacteria spreads the disease. Humans are the onlydocumented hosts for this disease.The most important treatment is to use oral rehydration as indicated on page 88[Chapter03.xhtml#page_88]. Antibiotics can reduce the shedding of cholera in thestool and can reduce diarrhea volume and duration by 50% but are not requiredfor treatment, only adequate rehydration. A single dose of 3 doxycycline 100 mgtablets from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module is adequate to treatshedding.COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS [nav.xhtml#sub221]Also called San Joaquin fever or valley fever, coccidioidomycosis is a fungalinfection caused by Coccidiodes immitis. Found in the San Joaquin Valley ofCalifornia and throughout the southwestern United States, this disease is caughtby inhaling the fungal spores in dust.Symptoms can be delayed in travelers, appearing after leaving the endemic area.The primary symptoms are those of an upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, orpneumonia. Incubation time varies and a progressive form may occur weeks,months, or years after the original infection in people with decreased immunity(e.g ., AIDS patients, people on steroids, or those receiving chemotherapy).Treatment is not required for those with upper respiratory infection symptoms.The diagnosis should be made with special blood tests to avoid missing othertreatable pneumonia. Progressive disease must be treated with intravenousantifungal medications.COLORADO TICK FEVER [nav.xhtml#sub222]A viral disease spread by ixodid (hard-shelled) ticks, this disease is twentytimes more common in Colorado than Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It is alsofound in the other states of the western Rocky Mountains and in provinces ofwestern Canada. It is most frequent in April and May at low altitudes, and inJune through July at high altitudes. Onset is abrupt, with chills, fever of 100.4 to 104°F (38 to 40°C), muscle aches, headache, eye pain, and eye sensitivityto light (photophobia). The patient feels weak and nauseated, but vomiting isunusual. During the first 2 days, up to 12% of the victims develop a rash. Inhalf the cases the fever disappears after 2 to 3 days, and the patient feelswell for 2 days. Then a second bout of illness starts, lasting intensely for 2to 4 days. This second phase subsides, with the patient feeling weak for 1 to 2additional weeks.This disease requires no treatment other than bed rest, fluids to preventdehydration, and medications to treat fever and aches. However, as the sameticks can also spread potentially dangerous Rocky Mountain spotted fever,treatment with doxycycline (100 mg twice daily), as described on page 235[Chapter09.xhtml#page_235], should be started immediately and continued for 14days. Do not wait for the characteristic rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever orthe fever pattern of Colorado tick fever to develop, or for a firm diagnosis ofeither to be established by a physician.DENGUE [nav.xhtml#sub223]Dengue—also called breakbone fever or dandy fever—is a viral infection caused bygroup B arbovirus or flavivirus and is spread by bites from the Aedes aegyptimosquito. Dengue is endemic throughout the tropics and subtropics and can beexpected to work its way into the southern United States due to the spread ofthe mosquito vector.After an incubation period of 3 to 15 (usually 5 to 8) days, there is a suddenonset of fever (104°F or 40°C), chills, headache, low back ache, pain behind theeyes with movement of the eyes, and extreme aching in the legs and joints. Theeyes are red and a transient flushing or pale pink rash occurs, mostly on theface. There is a relatively slow pulse rate for the temperature (see page 29[Chapter03.xhtml#page_29]). The fever lasts 48 to 96 hours, followed by 24 hoursof no fever and a sense of well-being. A second rapid temperature increaseoccurs, but generally not as high as the first. A bright rash spreads from thearms and legs to the trunk, but generally not to the face. Palms and soles maybe bright red and swollen. There is a severe headache and other body aches aswell. The fever, rash, and headache constitute the “dengue triad .” The illnesslasts for weeks, but mortality is nil. Treatment is rest and the use of pain andfever medication.A condition called dengue hemorrhagic fever shock syndrome is lethal, however,and usually occurs in patients younger than 10, generally infants under 1 yearof age. Dengue may be confused with Colorado tick fever, typhus, yellow fever,or other hemorrhagic fevers such as the Ebola virus or Rift Valley fever inAfrica. This is a reaction to having had a dengue infection in the past anddeveloping a partial immunity. A second infection of the disease (there are 4serotypes that are closely related) can result in an autoimmune reaction thatattacks the kidneys and causes other evidence of bleeding.ECHINOCOCCUS [nav.xhtml#sub224]Also called hydatid disease, the echinococcus infection is caused by the larvalstage of a tapeworm found in dogs (with sheep as an intermediate host) or inwolves in wilderness areas (with moose as the intermediate host). This diseaseis found worldwide but is most commonly a problem in Europe, Russia, Japan,Alaska, Canada, and the continental United States, particularly Isle Royale inLake Superior. When ingested by sheep, moose, or humans, the eggs form embryosthat pass through the intestinal circulation into the liver and sometimes beyondinto the lungs, brain, kidneys, and other tissue. There a fluid-filled cystforms, which contains scolices, brood capsules, and second-generation (daughter)cysts containing infectious scolices. The hydatid cysts maintain their presence,sometimes bursting and spreading in a malignant fashion, causing destruction ofliver, lung, and other critical tissues. After remaining without symptoms fordecades, abdominal pain, jaundice, or chest pain and coughing may commence.If the intermediate host is eaten by a carnivore (dog, wolf, or man), theinfectious scolices are released into the gastrointestinal tract, where theydevelop into adult worms, and the life cycle continues.Most hydatid disease is from the tapeworm (Echinococcus granulosis), but arapidly progressive form develops when infection is caused by the E.multilocularis tapeworm. This tapeworm is carried primarily by foxes anddomestic dogs and cats. Numerous small cysts form that multiply rapidly. Theresult is often fatal. There is no adequate medical treatment; attempts atsurgical removal of multiple cysts are the only reliable hope for cure.EHRLICHIOSIS [nav.xhtml#sub225]Since its discovery in 1987, the incidence of ehrlichiosis has increased toapproximately 1,000 cases per year. In North America the time of greatest riskis May through July. This is a rickettsial infection caused by Ehrlichiachaffeensis that is spread by several species of ticks.The incubation time ranges from 1 to 21 days (mean 7 days). It presents withhigh fever and headache, with other common symptoms being tiredness, nausea,vomiting, muscle aches, and loss of appetite. Twenty percent of victims developa rash, but this rash is seldom on the feet or hands. This disease can rangefrom mild, flu-like symptoms to its extreme, which can be fatal.The drug of choice is doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for at least 3 days,beyond fever detection and until evidence of clinical improvement, typically 5to 7 days total duration.ENCEPHALITIS [nav.xhtml#sub226]Encephalitis from group A arbovirus (western equine encephalitis, eastern equineencephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis) in the United States and Canada,and from group B arbovirus (St. Louis encephalitis) in the United States can beprevented by liberal use of repellent and covering exposed areas with netting orclothing to prevent bites from infected mosquitoes. Symptoms of these illnessesinclude high fever (104°F, or 40°C) and generally headache, stiff neck,vomiting, and, at times, diarrhea. These cases can be fatal and requireevacuation to medical help.Cool the patient with external means (cool water, fanning), and the use ofaspirin or Mobigesic. The disease occurs in epidemics; be very careful withmosquito exposure when the disease becomes prevalent.GIARDIASIS [nav.xhtml#sub227]Intestinal infection by Giardia lamblia, a single-cell parasite that causesgiardiasis or beaver fever, is becoming a significant problem in wildernesstravel in the United States and is a very common cause of traveler’s diarrhea.The stools of infected individuals contain the infective cyst form of theparasite. These cysts can live in water for longer than 3 months. Othermammalian vectors, such as the beaver, are responsible for much of the spread ofthis disease.In the active disease, the trophozoite form attaches itself to the small bowelby means of a central sucker. Multiplication is by binary fission, or division.Approximately 2 weeks after ingestion of the cysts, there is either a gradual orabrupt onset of persistent watery diarrhea, which usually resolves in 1 to 2weeks, but may persist less severely for several months. Abdominal pain,bloating, nausea, and weight loss from malabsorption may occur. Giardiasis isoften without symptoms at all, and a chronic carrier state exists. In the UnitedStates about 4% of stools submitted for parasitology examination contain G.lamblia cysts.Diagnosis is by finding cysts in stools, or trophozoites from gastric suction,or the “string test” from the duodenum. This latter test is performed by havingthe patient swallow a string, allowing the far end to pass into the first partof the bowel, or duodenum. When the string is pulled out, a microscopicexamination may demonstrate the presence of trophozoites. In active disease thecysts are routinely secreted, but in the chronic carrier state, repeated stoolexaminations (at least three) are required to provide a 95% accuracy of testresults. Treatment is with one of several drugs available in the United States,the most commonly used being Flagyl (metronidazole), 250 mg 3 times daily for 5days. A better drug is tinidazole, 2 grams taken as a single dose. Prevention isby proper filtration of water, adequate chemical treatment, or heating water to150°F (66°C). See page 89 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_89] for a full discussion ofwater treatment.HANTAVIRUS [nav.xhtml#sub228]Hantavirus was the cause of death among members of the Navaho Indian Nation inNew Mexico in 1993. The virus has been identified in serum samples from 690people in twelve states, with the greatest concentration in the western UnitedStates. It is caught by inhaling dust contaminated with feces from an infecteddeer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus).The onset of illness is a period of fever, muscle aches, and cough, followed byan abrupt onset of acute respiratory distress. The mortality rate has been 60%!There is no specific treatment available. Avoiding breathing dust that maycontain the contaminated mouse feces is the preventative measure. When cleaningout cabins, use a wet mop and avoid sweeping dry debris.HEPATITIS A [nav.xhtml#sub229]A viral infection of the liver, hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis) has worldwidedistribution. It is transmitted by ingestion of infected feces, in watersupplies contaminated by human sewage, in food handled by persons with poorhygiene, or in contaminated food such as raw shellfish grown in impure water.Contaminated milk and even infusion of infected blood products (see Hepatitis B,below) can spread this disease.From the time of exposure to the appearance of symptoms takes 15 to 50 days. Thedisease can range from minor flu-like symptoms to fatal liver disease. Mostcases resolve favorably within 6 to 12 weeks. Symptoms start abruptly withfever, lethargy, and nausea. Occasionally a rash develops. A characteristic lossof taste for cigarettes is frequent. In 3 to 10 days the urine turns dark,followed by jaundice, with yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin. Thestool may turn light colored. There is frequently itching and joint pain. Thejaundice peaks within 1 to 2 weeks and fades during the 2-to 4-week recoveryphase. The hepatitis A patient stops shedding virus in the stool prior to thejaundice developing and is therefore not contagious by the time the diagnosis isnormally made. Personal hygiene helps prevent spreading, but isolation of thepatient is not strictly required.In most cases no specific treatment is required. After a few days to 2 weeks,appetite generally returns and bed confinement is no longer required, eventhough jaundice remains. The best guideline is the disappearance of the lethargyand feeling of illness that appeared in the first stages of the disease.Restrictions of diet have no value, but a low-fat diet is generally morepalatable.If profound prostration occurs, the trip should be terminated for the patient,and he should be placed under medical care. If possible, unimmunized contactsshould be immediately given the hepatitis A shot, but the only practicalsolution is to immunize everyone against hepatitis A prior to leaving the grid.HEPATITIS B [nav.xhtml#sub230]Another viral infection of the liver, hepatitis B (serum hepatitis) is alsoworldwide in distribution. Transmission is primarily through infusion ofinfected blood products, sexual contact, use of contaminated needles orsyringes, or even sharing contaminated razor blades. Dental procedures,acupuncture, and ear piercing and tattooing with contaminated equipment willalso spread this disease.Incubation period from time of exposure to the development of symptoms is longerthan with hepatitis A, namely 30 to 180 days. The symptoms are similar, but theonset is less abrupt, and the incidence of fever is lower. There is a greaterchance of developing chronic hepatitis (5 to 10% of cases). Mortality is higher,especially in elderly patients, where it ranges from 10 to 15%.Immunization is available and is very effective.HEPATITIS C [nav.xhtml#sub231]A form of hepatitis, with similar manifestations to hepatitis B, has beendesignated as hepatitis C (formerly “non-A, non-B” since evidence of exposure tothose virus particles was not previously found in blood tests). The transmissionis probably the same as for hepatitis B. Incubation period is from less than 2weeks to more than 25 weeks, with an average of 7 weeks for the development ofclinical disease. Immunization is available. Specific treatment is available forthis disease.HEPATITIS D [nav.xhtml#sub232]Hepatitis D, or the “delta agent,” can only infect a person who has hepatitis B.The presence of this mutated RNA particle causes the infection to be morefulminant. It spreads only by contaminated needle use. No specific treatmentexists. It is considered prudent in persons who have this disease to immunizethem with the only two vaccines now available, injections of vaccines forHepatitis A and Hepatitis B.HEPATITIS E [nav.xhtml#sub233]An epidemic form of hepatitis (that is not A or C) has been termed hepatitis E.Spread by ingestion of contaminated food or water, the incubation period fromtime of contact ranges from 2 to 9 weeks, with a mean of 45 days. The diseasemimics hepatitis A. The fatality rate in pregnant women is highest, about 20%.Outbreaks have been confirmed throughout developing areas of the Old World.There is no immunization or specific treatment available.HEPATITIS G [nav.xhtml#sub234]A new virus has been identified as the hepatitis G virus. A member of the familyFlaviviridae, it can be spread by blood and sexual contact, just as withhepatitis B. There is no immunization or specific treatment available.LEPTOSPIROSIS [nav.xhtml#sub235]This disease is caused by a spirochete, genus Leptospira; a similar organismcauses syphilis and Lyme disease. Like those diseases, this organism can attackvirtually any organ system, yet 90% of those infected have no symptoms. Theorganism can live in damp soil, vegetation, and mud, but dies almost instantlyupon drying. It spreads into the environment due to contaminated urine from illanimals. This germ is located all over the world, including the northern UnitedStates. Cuts and abrasions on the skin increase the risk of illness, whilewearing protective footwear or clothing decreases it.The incubation period is 7 days, with a range of 2 to 29 days. Initially it canpresent with high fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, red eyes, abdominalpain, diarrhea, rash, and jaundice. It may occur in two phases. Recurrent feversof up to 102˚F (38 .9°C). After the first phase, the patient may recover, thenrelapse 6 to 12 days later with similar symptoms. About 200 cases are identifiedin the United States (50% in Hawaii), but this is considered the most widelyspread disease from an animal in the world. Between 1 and 5% of cases are fatal.The most serious form is called Wiel’s disease, which includes jaundice andsevere lung, kidney, and bleeding disorders. It is treated with doxycycline, 100mg twice daily for 2 weeks, but recent studies are unclear if antibioticsactually help. However, I subscribe to the old adage: You should not die in thetropics unless you die on doxycycline.LYME DISEASE [nav.xhtml#sub236]Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The disease livesin various mammals but is transmitted to humans by the bite of several speciesof ticks. The disease is most common in the Northeast, extending throughConnecticut and Massachusetts down to Maryland; in Wisconsin and Minnesota;throughout the states of California and Oregon; and in various south Atlanticand south-central states, with cases reported in 43 of the Lower 48 states. Amap showing the reported incidence of Lyme disease per county by state withinthe United States is located at www.cdc.gov [http://www.cdc.gov]. It has beenfound in the former Soviet Union, China, Australia, and Japan as well as severalEuropean countries.The disease goes through several phases. In stage one, after an incubation of 3days to a month, about 95% of victims develop a circular lesion in the area ofthe bite. It has a clear to pink center, raised border, is painless, and rangesfrom 1 to 23 inches in diameter. There are usually several such patches. Thepatient feels lethargic and has headache, muscle and joint pain, and enlargedlymph nodes. In stage two, 10 to 15% of patients can develop meningitis, andless than 10% develop heart problems. Symptoms may last for months but aregenerally self-limited. Approximately 60% enter stage three, the development ofactual arthritis. Frequently a knee is involved. The swelling can be impressive.Stage three can start abruptly several weeks to 2 years after the onset of theinitial rash.Treatment of stage one Lyme disease is a tetracycline, such as doxycycline, 100mg taken twice daily for 21 days. Alternate drugs are penicillin anderythromycin. Treatment of choice for stage two and three Lyme disease consistsof Rocephin, 2 grams given intravenously (IV) daily for 14 to 21 days.For prevention of Lyme disease after a recognized tick bite, routine use ofantimicrobial prophylaxis or serologic testing is not recommended. A single doseof doxycycline may be offered to adult patients (200 mg) if (a) the attachedtick can be reliably identified as an adult or nymphal deer tick (Ixodesscapularis) that is estimated to have been attached for more than 36 hours onthe basis of the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood or of certaintyabout the time of exposure to the tick; (b) prophylaxis can be started within 72hours of the time that the tick was removed; (c) ecologic information indicatesthat the local rate of infection of these ticks with B. burgdorferi is more than20%; and (d) doxycycline treatment is not contraindicated.One manifestation of Lyme disease is the development of a facial paralysis onone side, called Bell’s palsy. The involved side is expressionless since thepatient is unable to move the muscles of the forehead, around the eye and so on.While there are other causes of Bell’s palsy, in North America this problem mustbe considered a result of Lyme disease until ruled out by a physician. Treatmentof Bell’s palsy caused by Lyme disease is with oral antibiotic for 21 days.MALARIA [nav.xhtml#sub237]Human malaria is caused by five species of a protozoan: Plasmodium falciparum,P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and, rarely, P. knowlesi in Southeast Asia. Theinfection is acquired from the bite of an infected female anopheles mosquito. Itmay also be spread by blood transfusion. Falciparum malaria is the most serious.While all forms of this disease make people ill and may be lethal, P. falciparumis the one that kills.Regions of the world where malaria may be acquired are sub-Saharan Africa, partsof Mexico and Central America, Haiti, parts of South America, the Middle East,the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. Resistance to chloroquine by thedeadly P. falciparum has become widespread. For travelers in resistant areas,there are several prophylactic medications that are currently used: Malarone,Lariam, and doxycycline. To use Lariam (mefloquine), 250 mg, take 1 tabletweekly, starting 1 week prior to departure and continuing for 4 weeks afterreturn. An alternate drug regimen, especially necessary when P. falciparum hasbecome resistant to mefloquine, is the use of doxycycline, 100 mg to be takenonce daily for prevention. This must be started the day before exposure,continued daily and for 4 weeks after exposure.In areas with relapsing malaria (P. vivax and P. ovale), primaquine should betaken 1 tablet daily during the last 2 weeks of chloroquine therapy. This isusually appropriate for anyone faced with long exposure in areas with a highconcentration of these strains of malaria. The International Association forMedical Assistance to Travellers (www.iamat.org [http://www.iamat.org]) providesthe percentage of P. falciparum versus P. vivax and P. ovale, as well as currentinformation on resistance to chloroquine for each country.If you are moving off the grid into an area with malaria, taking a verylong-term (multiple years) of an antimalarial drug, while safe, may beimpractical. Your best approach is strict mosquito protection with permethrintreatment of clothing, bed netting, residual spraying of building interiors, andskin protection—and the use of a treatment dose of medication if someone comesdown with possible malaria. In children malaria frequently presents withdiarrhea and abdominal pain, but in all expect severe fever with profusesweating, headache, nausea, and vomiting. This can lead to convulsions anddeath. A good treatment is to use Malarone (250 mg atovaquone + 100 mgproguanil) 4 tablets once daily (take with food or milk and the same time eachday, repeating the dose if patient vomits within 1 hour of taking it). Apediatric treatment dose is also devised based upon weight. The pediatric tabletis 62 .5 mg atovaquone + 25 mg proguanil.Table 9-4. Pediatric Treatment Dose of Malarone for Malaria (Given for 3 Days)Weight Tablets 11 to 18 pounds (5 to 8 kg) 2 pediatric tabs once daily 19 to 23pounds (9 to 10 kg) 3 pediatric tabs once daily 24 to 44 pounds (11 to 20 kg) 1adult tab once daily 45 to 66 pounds (21 to 30 kg) 2 adult tabs once daily 67 to88 pounds (31 to 40 kg) 3 adult tabs once daily Over 89 pounds (over 41 kg) 4adult tabs once dailyMEASLES (RUBEOLA) [nav.xhtml#sub238]A viral disease, measles spreads easily by inhalation and is one of the mostcontagious viral diseases; 90% of unimmunized persons who are exposed catch it.Occurring 1 to 3 weeks after exposure, usually 2 weeks, onset is with a highfever 105°F (40 .6°C) and typically conjunctivitis, runny nose, and cough.Within 3 to 7 days after the fever, a rash appears on the face, then covers theentire body, lasting for 4 to 7 days. It is contagious 4 days before and 4 daysafter the rash breaks.One per 1,000 cases can develop deadly brain infections. It can cause diarrhea,middle ear infections, and pneumonia, which can also become fatal. Persons withear infections, and pneumonia may have a secondary bacterial infection as welldue to their weakened condition, and these can be treated with antibiotics, butan antibiotic will not help if the cause is just from the measles. There is nospecific treatment. Only use acetaminophen (Tylenol) and not aspirin or NSAIDslike ibuprofen when treating the fever. You can treat cough and runny nosesymptoms. Children who contract this disease should receive 200,000 units ofvitamin A (50 units under 6 months; 100,000 units for 6 to 11 months) with arepeat dose in 2 to 4 weeks. If this breaks out in a group, any nonimmunizedpersons will catch it.Immunization is protective and is provided by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)vaccine.MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS [nav.xhtml#sub239]This acute bacterial infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis results ininflammation of the brain and central nervous system. Many cases are withoutsymptoms or consist of a mild upper respiratory illness. Severe cases begin withsudden fever, sore throat, chills, headache, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting.Within 24 to 48 hours, the victim becomes drowsy and mentally confused, followedby convulsions, coma, and death. Immediate and appropriately large doses of theproper antibiotic are critical to save the patient’s life; the medical kit onlyhas Rocephin, which must be given in large amounts: 1 gram IM twice daily. Thedisease is spread by contact with the nasal secretions of infected persons(sneezing and coughing).While the disease is found worldwide, large epidemics are more common intropical countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa in the dry season, New Delhi(India), and Nepal.In 80% of healthy young adults, bacterial meningitis is caused by themeningococcus bacteria discussed in this section or by a pneumococci bacterium.Vaccines are available against both organisms.MUMPS [nav.xhtml#sub240]This virus infection spreads by respiratory droplets either by inhalation ortouching them on surfaces. The incubation period is 16 to 18 days (range, 12 to25). The disease starts with fever, headache, loss of appetite, and muscleaches. The hallmark of the disease is swelling of one or both parotid (salivary)glands. People are the most contagious from a few days before illness until 5days after the onset of parotid gland swelling. The complications can beinfections of the testicle, hearing loss, meningitis, encephalitis, andpancreatitis. Treat the fever with acetaminophen (Tylenol) and avoid aspirin.Immunization is protective and is provided by the MMR vaccine. Unfortunately,the mumps component of this shot is the least effective and provides only about88% protection, which may gradually decline and, in case of outbreaks, the MMRshould be boosted.PLAGUE [nav.xhtml#sub241]Plague is caused by a bacterium (Yersinia pestis) that infects wild rodents inmany parts of the world, including the western United States and parts of SouthAmerica, Africa, and Asia. Epidemics occur when domestic rats become infectedand spread the disease to humans. Bubonic plague is transmitted by infectedfleas, while pneumonic plague is spread directly to other people by coughing.Plague is accompanied by fever, enlarged lymph nodes (bubonic plague) and, lesscommonly, pneumonia (pneumonic plague).Treatment is with doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily. Treat fever as necessary.Isolate the patient, particularly if coughing. Drainage of abscesses (buboes)may be necessary (see page 147 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_147]). Exposed personsshould be watched for 10 days, but incubation is usually 2 to 6 days.RABIES [nav.xhtml#sub242]Rabies can be transmitted on the North American continent by several species ofmammals, namely skunk, bat, fox, coyote, raccoon, bobcat, and wolf. Obviously,if removing an animal from a trap, jogging past an animal, separating motherfrom child, or taking food from a critter causes an attack, the most likelycause of the attack is not from a rabid animal, but a scared or angry one. Anattack by a wounded animal is cause for concern, as the animal may be woundeddue to loss of coordination from rabies. Any unprovoked attack by one of thesemammals should be considered an attack by a rabid animal. Dogs and cats in theUnited States have a low incidence of rabies. Information from local departmentsof health will indicate if rabies is currently of concern in your area.Animals whose bites have never caused rabies in humans in the United States arelivestock (cattle, sheep, horse), rabbits, gerbils, chipmunks, squirrels, rats,and mice. A significant epidemic of raccoon rabies has now extended from Floridato Connecticut, with isolated reports from New Hampshire and Ohio showing anexpansion of this epidemic north and west. Hawaii is the only rabies-free state.Canada’s rabies occurs mostly in foxes and skunks in the province of Ontario.The rabies vaccine available in the United States is very effective, with lowside effects. It is expensive, but much less expensive than having to acquirepost-exposure rabies immune globulin in addition to the complete series ofshots.The incubation can be brief or take months. It is caused when the virus is ableto reach a peripheral nerve synapse, then penetrates it and moves toward thebrain at the rate of 4 inches (10 cm) per day! Once the virus is in the nerve,the patient is doomed. Rabies is vicious, virtually 100% fatal once it developsclinically. It is sometimes called hydrophobia because the person appears to beafraid of water. They will be very thirsty but will choke when trying toswallow. Spasms, high fever, and terrible headache rapidly progress to death.Because of this, there is generous use of rabies vaccine and rabies-specificimmune globulin to provide immediate, passive immunity until the vaccine cantake effect. Approximately 16,000 to 39,000 people are vaccinated in the UnitedStates yearly to prevent this disease. Persons having to work with potentiallyrabid animal populations can be immunized with the vaccine and given yearlybooster shots. It is possible to obtain the disease by merely being contaminatedwith the saliva or blood of an infected animal if it encounters a break in theskin or mucous membranes, and possibly even by breathing in dust infected withthe virus. The first aid treatment will always be to irrigate the wound area,especially with a virucidal material, such as a saturated iodine water solutionused for water purification (page 90 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_90]), soap and water,or the other methods indicated for wound cleansing (page 122[Chapter06.xhtml#page_122]).RELAPSING FEVER [nav.xhtml#sub243]This bacterial infection is caused by several species of Borrelia spirochete andis spread by body lice in Asia, Africa, and Europe, or by soft-bodied ticks inthe Americas (including the western United States), Asia, Africa, and Europe.Symptoms occur 3 to 11 days from contact with the tick or louse vector and startwith an abrupt onset of chills, headache, muscular pains, and sometimesvomiting. A rash may appear and small hemorrhages present under the skinsurface. The fever remains high from 3 to 5 days, then clears suddenly. After 1to 2 weeks a somewhat milder relapse begins. Jaundice is more common duringrelapse. The illness again clears, but between 2 and 10 similar episodes reoccurat intervals of 1 to 2 weeks until immunity fully develops.Antibiotics are available for effective treatment. Mortality is low, less than5% in healthy adults. Treatment is with doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 5 to10 days. Personal hygiene is effective in preventing louse-borne disease, whilecontrol of ticks with insect repellent and frequent body checks and tick removalminimize the chance of tick-borne disease. Unlike many tick-borne diseases thatwill not spread to humans unless the tick has been attached for longer than 2days, relapsing fever can be caught soon after attachment.ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER [nav.xhtml#sub244]This is an acute and serious infection caused by a microorganism calledRickettsia rickettsii and transmitted by ixodid (hard-shelled) ticks. It is mostcommon in North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, the Rocky Mountain states, and thestate of Washington. The peak incidence of cases is from May to September. Onsetof infection occurs after a 3-to 12-day incubation period (average 7 days fromthe tick bite). Fever reaches 103 to 104°F (40°C) within 2 days. There isconsiderable headache, chills, and muscle pain at the onset. In 4 days a rashappears on the wrists, ankles, soles, and palms and then spreads to the trunk.Initially pink, this rash turns to dark blotches and even ulcers in severecases.Any suspected case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever should be considered amedical emergency. Do not wait for the rash to develop; rather, start thepatient on antibiotics from the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module. Givedoxycycline, 100 mg, 1 tablet every 12 hours, and keep on this dosage schedulefor 14 days. This is the drug of choice, and its early use can cut the deathrate from 20% to nearly zero. Prevention is by the careful removal of ticks andthe use of insect repellent and protective clothing. Obviously, anyone suspectedof having this disease needs to be seen immediately by a physician.RUBELLA (GERMAN MEASLES, 3-DAY MEASLES) [nav.xhtml#sub245]A viral disease (unrelated to measles), this is highly contagious and is spreadby persons between 7 days before and 5 to 7 days after the onset of thecharacteristic rash, which starts on the face and spreads to the body.Frequently there are aching joints, especially in young women. Incubation fromexposure averages 14 days (range is 12 to 23 days). The illness may start with alow-grade fever and lymph node enlargement. Some people will not have symptoms,but they will also be contagious. It is extremely dangerous to a pregnantwoman’s baby, even more so than Zika virus.There is no treatment. Avoid aspirin for fever and use acetaminophen (Tylenol).It is prevented with immunization using the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.SCHISTOSOMIASIS [nav.xhtml#sub246]Blood trematodes or flukes are responsible for schistosomiasis (bilharziasis,safari fever). The eggs are deposited in freshwater and hatch into motilemiracidia, which infect snails. After developing in the snails, active cercariaeemerge, which can penetrate exposed human skin. Swimming, wading, or drinkingfreshwater must be avoided in infected areas.Schistosoma mansoni is found in tropical Africa, part of Venezuela, severalCaribbean islands, the Guianas, Brazil, and the Middle East . S. japonicum isencountered in China, Japan, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia . S.haematobium is in Africa, the Middle East, and small portions of India andislands in the Indian Ocean, all probably pretty far off the grid. The formertwo species are excreted in the stools, and the latter in urine. Shedding mayoccur for years. No isolation is required of patients. Specific treatments forthe various species are available. Initial penetration of the skin causes anitchy rash. After entry, the organism enters the bloodstream, migrates throughthe lungs, and eventually lodges in the blood vessels draining either the gut orthe bladder, depending upon the species. While the worms are maturing, thevictim will have fever, lethargy, cough, rash, abdominal pain, and often nausea.In acute infections caused by S. mansoni and S. japonicum, victims develop amucoid, bloody diarrhea and tender liver enlargement. Chronic infection leads tofibrosis of the liver with distension of the abdomen. In S. haematobiuminfections, the bladder becomes inflamed and eventually fibrotic. Symptomsinclude painful urination, urgency, blood in urine, and pelvic pain.STARI [nav.xhtml#sub247]Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) develops around the site of a lonestar tick bite and develops within 7 days of the bite. It can expand to adiameter of 3 inches (8 centimeters). Patients possibly experience fatigue,headache, fever, and muscle pains. Lone star tick bites almost always cause alocal small inflamed area, but that by itself is not an indication that apatient has STARI. Lone star ticks do not carry Lyme disease. While the CDC doesnot recommend, at the time of this writing, the use of antibiotics in treatingSTARI, since the causative organism is not known, studies have shown taking anantibiotic such as doxycycline clears the symptoms quicker.TAPEWORMS [nav.xhtml#sub248]Three species of tapeworm infect humans: Taenia saginata larvae found in beef,T. solium in pork, and Diphyllobothrium latum in fish. In all three the humaningests undercooked flesh of the host animal, acquiring the infective cysts.The beef tapeworm can be huge, forming lengths of 10 to 30 feet inside the humanhost. It is common in Mexico, South America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East,and Africa. Symptoms can include stomach pain, weight loss, and diarrhea, butfrequently the human host has no clue of the infestation.The pork tapeworm infects victims in South America, eastern Europe, Russia, andAsia. Generally, it is without symptoms; at times vague abdominal complaints arenoted. A complication of this disease is cysticercosis: The tapeworm larvaepenetrate the human intestinal wall—after the human drinks infected water—andinvade body tissues, frequently skeletal muscle and the brain. There they matureinto cystic masses. After several years the cysts degenerate and produce localinflammatory reactions that can then cause convulsions, visual problems, ormental disturbances. In this case the human replaces the pig in the maturationcycle of the tapeworm, and it is the human flesh that is contaminated by thetapeworm cyst. This is an unlucky break for the involved human and any cannibalshe might meet. Any water filtration or purification system can preventcysticercosis.The fish tapeworm occurs worldwide but is a particular hazard in Scandinavia andthe Far East. A single tapeworm, usually without symptoms, develops. The worm’sabsorption of vitamin B-12 may cause pernicious anemia in the host.TETANUS [nav.xhtml#sub249]Although caused by a bacterium (Clostridium tetani) that is located worldwide,most cases of tetanus occur from very minor wounds such as a paper cut, ratherthan from rusty barbed wire, as so many people think. In fact, a hiker on theAppalachian Trail got tetanus from a blister on his heel and inadequateimmunization. Onset is gradual, with an incubation period of 2 to 50 (usually 5to 10) days. The earliest symptom is stiffness of the jaw, then sore throat,stiff muscles, headache, low-grade fever, and muscle spasm. As the diseaseprogresses, the patient is unable to open their jaw, and the facial muscles maybe fixed in a smile with elevated eyebrows. Painful generalized spasms ofmuscles occur with minor disturbances such as drafts, noise, or someone jarringthe patient’s bed. Death from loss of respiratory muscle function, or evenunknown causes, may ensue. The disease is frequently fatal. Prevention isobtained by adequate immunization.TICK PARALYSIS [nav.xhtml#sub250]Five species of ticks in North America produce a neurotoxin in their saliva thatcan paralyze their victims. Most cases are found in the Pacific Northwest, RockyMountain states, and seven southern states, as well as Australia. Spring andsummer are the times of highest risk. The toxin is usually carried by anengorged pregnant tick. Symptoms begin 2 to 7 days after the tick beginsfeeding. Throughout the ordeal the patient’s mental function is usually spared.Symptoms start as weakness in the legs, which progressively ascends until theentire body is paralyzed within several hours to days. At times the conditionpresents as ataxia (loss of coordination) without muscle weakness.The diagnosis is made by finding an embedded tick. After removing the tick,symptoms resolve in hours to days, rarely longer. Untreated tick paralysis canbe fatal, with mortality rates of 10 to 12%.TRICHINOSIS [nav.xhtml#sub251]Trichinosis is caused by eating improperly cooked meat infected with the cystsof this parasite, the roundworm Trichinella spiralis. It is most common in pigs,bears (particularly polar bears), and some marine mammals. Nausea and diarrheaor intestinal cramping may appear within 1 to 2 days, but it generally takes 7days after digestion. Swelling of the eyelids is very characteristic on the 11thday. After that, muscle soreness, fever, pain in the eyes, and subconjunctivalhemorrhage (see page 49 [Chapter03.xhtml#page_49]) develop. If enoughcontaminated food is ingested, this can be a fatal disease. Most symptomsdisappear in 3 months.Treatment is with pain medication (Percogesic from the Non-Rx Oral MedicationModule, or Norco 10/325 from the Rx Oral Medication Module). The use of steroidssuch as Decadron (20 mg/day for 3 or 4 days, followed by reduced dosage over thenext 10 days) is indicated in severe cases. Specific drugs are available fortreatment of this disease (albendazole and, when available, mebendazole). Thebest prevention is cooking suspected meat at 150°F (66°C) for 30 minutes foreach pound of meat.TRYPANOSOMIASIS, AFRICAN (AFRICAN SLEEPING SICKNESS) [nav.xhtml#sub252]While it is very likely that you are not leaving the grid for Africa, theAfrican variety of trypanosomiasis is interesting as it is so different from theAmerican variety, which you may encounter if you are heading to Central Americaor South America. Two species of trypanosomes cause African trypanosomiasis(African sleeping sickness), which is transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly.The severity of the disease depends upon the species encountered. The infectionzone is confined to the area of Africa between 15 degrees north and 20 degreessouth of the equator—the exact distribution of the tsetse fly. Humans are theonly reservoir of Trypanosoma gambiense found in west and central Africa, whilewild game is the principal reservoir of the T. rhodesiense of east Africa.T. gambiense infection starts with a nodule or a chancre that appears briefly atthe site of a tsetse fly bite. Generalized illness appears months to years laterand is characterized by lymph node enlargement at the back of the neck andintermittent fever. Months to years after this development, invasion of thecentral nervous system may occur, noted by behavioral changes, headache, loss ofappetite, backache, hallucinations, delusions, and sleeping too much. In T.rhodesiense infection the generalized illness begins 5 to 14 days after thenodule or chancre develops. It is much more intense than the Gambian variety andmay include acute central nervous system and cardiac symptoms, fever, and rapidweight loss. It has a high rate of mortality. If untreated, death usually occurswithin 1 year. Specific, but frequently toxic, therapy is available.TRYPANOSOMIASIS, AMERICAN (CHAGAS DISEASE) [nav.xhtml#sub253]Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, aprotozoan hemoflagellate, is transmitted through the feces of a brown insectcalled the “kissing bug,” or the “assassin bug” in North America. This bug is amember of the family Reduviidae. The bug’s popular name in South America isvinchuca, derived from a word which means “one who lets himself fall down .”These bugs live in palm trees or the thatching in native huts and like to droponto their sleeping victim’s face or exposed arms. When biting victims, the bugdefecates. The itch of the wound causes bitten patients to scratch the wound,rubbing the feces into the bite site, thus causing the inoculation of theinfectious agent. This disease is found in parts of South and Central America,but the vector for the disease (the kissing bug) is located in the southwesternUnited States. At first this disease may have no symptoms. A chagoma, or rednodule, develops at the site of the original infection. This area may then loseits pigmentation. After 1 to 2 weeks, a firm swelling of one eyelid occurs,known as Romana’s sign. The swelling becomes purplish in color, and lymph nodeswelling in front of the ear on the same side may occur. In a few days a feverdevelops, with generalized lymph node swelling. Rapid heart rate, spleen andliver enlargement, swelling of the legs, and meningitis or encephalitis mayoccur. Serious conditions also can include acute heart failure. In most cases,however, the illness subsides in about 3 months and the patient appears to livea normal life. The disease continues, however, slowly destroying the heart,until 10 to 20 years later, chronic congestive heart failure becomes apparent.The underlying cause may never be known, especially in a traveler who has leftthe endemic area. In some areas of Brazil, the disease attacks the colon,causing flaccid enlargement with profound constipation.This disease is a leading cause of death in South America, generally due toheart failure. As many as 15 million people in South America may be infected.TUBERCULOSIS [nav.xhtml#sub254]Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by one of two bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosisor M. bovis. The infection results in a chronic illness that can reactivate manyyears after it apparently has been killed. In the United States there are 20,000new cases, with 1,800 deaths, yearly. Worldwide there are 8 to 10 million newcases, with 2 to 3 million deaths annually. This disease is spread primarily byinhalation of infected droplets. The disease also spreads by drinking infectedmilk or eating infected dairy products such as butter. If milk cannot bepasteurized, the animals from which it is sourced (cows, goats, etc .) should betuberculin-free. In my practice I once treated an elderly lady from southernIndiana who had widespread tuberculosis, which she had caught from drinkinggoat’s milk.Active pulmonary disease usually develops within a year of contact. The earlysymptoms of fever, night sweats, lethargy, and weight loss can be so gradualthat they are initially ignored. Tuberculosis usually infects the lungs, but itcan spread throughout the body, causing neurological damage, bone infections,and overwhelming infection. Diagnosis is usually made with a chest X-ray.TULAREMIA [nav.xhtml#sub255]Tularemia (rabbit fever, deerfly fever) can be contracted through exposure toticks, deerflies, or mosquitoes. Cuts can be infected when working with rabbitpelts. Eating improperly cooked infected rabbits can result in onset. Similarly,muskrats, foxes, squirrels, mice, and rats can spread the disease via directcontact with their carcasses. Stream water may become contaminated by theseanimals.An ulcer appears when a wound is involved, and lymph nodes become enlarged,first in nearby areas and then throughout the body. Pneumonia normally develops.The disease lasts 4 weeks in untreated cases. Mortality in treated cases isalmost zero, while in untreated cases it ranges from 6 to 30%.Treatment of choice is streptomycin, but the doxycycline suggested for the RxOral/Topical Medication Module works extremely well. The average adult wouldrequire an initial dose of 2 tablets, followed by 1 tablet every 12 hours.Continue therapy for 5 to 7 days after the fever has broken.TYPHOID FEVER [nav.xhtml#sub256]Caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi, typhoid fever is spread bycontaminated food and dairy products. Prevention is proper food storage, thethorough cooking of food, and avoidance of unrefrigerated dairy products.The disease is characterized by headache, chills, loss of appetite, backache,constipation, nosebleed, and tenderness of the abdomen to palpation. Thetemperature rises daily for 7 to 10 days. The fever is maintained at a highlevel for 7 to 19 more days, then drops over the next 10 days. With typhoidfever, a pulse rate of only 84 may occur with a temperature of 104°F (40°C),when one might otherwise expect a pulse rate of over 120. Between the 7th and10th days of the illness, rose-colored splotches, which blanch when pressure isapplied, appear in 10% of patients.The drug of choice for treating this illness is Rocephin, given at 30 mg/kg ofbody weight/day IM in 2 divided doses per day for 2 weeks. An oral drug that canbe used is Levaquin, 500 mg given once daily. Diarrhea may be severe in thelatter stages of this illness. Replacement of fluids is especially importantduring the phases of high fever or diarrhea (see page 88[Chapter03.xhtml#page_88]). Patients with relapses should be given another 5-daycourse of the antibiotic. Immunization prior to departure to endemic areas isuseful in preventing or curtailing the severity of this infection and should betaken by anyone traveling to an endemic area. This disease is very common aftermass disaster situations, and while immunization is not usually indicated forliving in the US, it is a disease to be aware of if the grid collapses.ENDEMIC TYPHUS, FLEA-BORNE [nav.xhtml#sub257]This disease is also known as murine typhus, rat-flea typhus, New World typhus,Malaya typhus, and urban typhus. It is one of several diseases caused byrickettsia, which resemble both viral and bacterial infections. Other diseasescaused by this order are Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Q fever, trench fever,and the various typhus diseases. Endemic typhus is due to Rickettsia typhi,which is located worldwide, including the southern Atlantic and Gulf Coaststates of the United States. It is spread to humans through infected rat fleafeces.After an incubation period of 6 to 18 days (mean 10 days), shaking chills,fever, and headache develop. A rash forms, primarily on the trunk, but fadesfairly rapidly. The fever lasts about 12 days. This is a mild disease andfatalities are rare. Antibiotic treatment with doxycycline, 100 mg given twicedaily, is very effective. Prevention is directed toward vector (rat and flea)control.EPIDEMIC TYPHUS, LOUSE-BORNE [nav.xhtml#sub258]This malady is also called classic typhus, European typhus, and jail fever. Itkilled 3 million people during World War II. On the positive side, no Americantraveler has contracted this disease since 1950. It is most likely to beencountered in mountainous regions of Mexico, Central and South America, theBalkans, eastern Europe, Africa, and many countries of Asia. The causative agentis Rickettsia prowazekii, which is transmitted by infected lice.Following a 7-to 14-day incubation period, there is a sudden onset of high fever(104°F, or 40°C), which remains at a high level, with a usual morning decrease,for about 2 weeks. There is an intense headache. A light pink rash appears onthe 4th to 6th day, soon becoming dark red. There is low blood pressure,pneumonia, mental confusion, and bruising in severe cases. Mortality is rare inchildren less than 10 years of age but may reach greater than 60% in those over50. Antibiotics, such as doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, are very effective ifgiven early in the disease. Prevention is proper hygiene and delousing whenneeded. A vaccine was formerly made in the United States but is no longeravailable and is not needed due to the low incidence observed.WEST NILE VIRUS [nav.xhtml#sub259]This is an arbovirus that primarily infects birds, especially crows, ravens, androbins. Mosquitoes then spread this virus to all mammals, which unfortunatelyincludes humans. A sign of local West Nile virus activity can be dead birds,especially crows, ravens, and robins. In North America the mosquito vector isthe culex, which is unfortunate as these mosquitoes do not usually announcetheir presence by buzzing in your ears or leaving welts when they bite. They aresilent, stealth biters. If you are being buzzed and welt up, you don’t have toworry about it being from a culex mosquito.West Nile virus was first identified in the United States in 1999 and haspresented in all states and in all provinces of Canada (with rare exceptions).The disease is usually without symptoms, but when more severe it results infever, headache, stiff neck, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches and weakness, andeven coma and death. It does not spread from person to person, except via bloodtransfusion. Support is accomplished with adequate pain medication, evacuationif possible, and generally helping with normal body functions.YELLOW FEVER [nav.xhtml#sub260]An arbovirus, yellow fever is found in tropical areas of South and CentralAmerica and Africa. This viral disease is contracted by the bite of the Aedesaegypti mosquito (and other species). Onset, about 2 weeks after the bite, issudden, with a fever of 102 to 104°F (40°C). The pulse is usually rapid thefirst day, but becomes slow by the second day. In mild cases the fever fallssuddenly 2 to 5 days after onset. This remission lasts for hours to severaldays. Next the fever returns, but the pulse remains slow. Jaundice, vomiting ofblack blood, and severe loss of protein in the urine (causing it to becomefoamy) occurs during this stage. Hemorrhages may be noted in the mouth and skin(petechiae). The patient is confused, and the senses are dulled. Delirium,convulsions, and coma occur before death in approximately 10% of cases. If thepatient survives, this last febrile episode lasts from 3 to 9 days. Withremission the patient is well, with no aftereffects from the disease.Immunization is available and required or recommended for travel to manycountries. It was once a common disease in the US, and we have the mosquito herethat can spread it again.ZIKA VIRUS [nav.xhtml#sub261]This is a viral disease spread by a daytime biting mosquito that frequentlylives in human habitats, the Aedes alopictus. As the range of this beast is wellinto the northern areas of the United States, and it can also carry dengue,chikungunya, and West Nile virus, febrile illness associated with muscle andjoint pain, and at times rash and/ or eye irritation, could be any one of thesediseases. Avoid the use of aspirin or meloxicam, but treat instead with Tylenolor Ultram. Due to possible birth defects from this disease, pregnant women willneed to have a careful specialist follow-up. Prevention is the use of mosquitoprotection as indicated on page 204 [Chapter08.xhtml#page_204], and since thisdisease can be spread sexually, use of condoms for at least 6 months afterexposure or illness. Persons traveling into a Zika-infested area should continueto wear mosquito repellant at least 2 weeks after they leave to prevent amosquito in a disease-free area from biting and spreading this illness into thecommunity. Frequently the ache and other symptoms of Zika are very mild, and aperson can contract it without even knowing they have had it or are carrying it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 [nav.xhtml#ch10]ENVIRONMENTAL INJURIES [nav.xhtml#ch10]No matter where you go off the grid, while ankle sprains, blisters, and diarrheaare the most common problems that may bother you, environmental conditions posethe most likely threat to life. In fact, most of prepping goes into preparingfor environmental injuries. The basic skills involving shelters and fire andenergy production are all meant to control environmental challenges. Foremostamong these dangers is hypothermia. Death from heat exposure is still thesecond-leading cause of death among high school athletes (discounting thehighway). Unless you live right on the Pacific Coast, lightning can do more thanscare you. And for those of us forced to suddenly travel vertically,high-altitude illnesses are potentially miserable, even lethal, experiences.This chapter covers injuries that can occur depending on environmentalconditions.Hypothermia 247 Chronic Hypothermia 247 Acute Hypothermia 250 Cold WaterSubmersion 251 Cold-Stress Injuries 252 Frostnip 252 Frostbite 252 Cold-InducedBronchospasm 254 Immersion Foot 254 Chilblains 255 Heat-Stress Injuries 255Dilutional Hyponatremia 258 Heat Cramps 259 Heat Exhaustion 259 Heat Stroke 260Prickly Heat 261 Lightning 261 High-Altitude Illnesses 265 Acute MountainSickness (AMS) 265 High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) 266 High-AltitudeCerebral Edema (HACE) 267HYPOTHERMIA [nav.xhtml#sub262]The term hypothermia refers to the lowering of the body’s core temperature to95°F (35°C); profound hypothermia is a core temperature lower than 90°F (32°C).Another important point is that the term hypothermia applies to two distinctlydifferent diseases. Chronic hypothermia is the slow onset of hypothermia in theoutdoor traveler who is exposed to conditions too cold to be protected by hisequipment. Acute hypothermia, or immersion hypothermia, is the rapid onset ofhypothermia in a person immersed in cold water.In acute hypothermia—when the onset of cold core temperature takes less than 2hours—the body cannot produce the complex physiological responses that it iscapable of when it has more time. In chronic hypothermia—when body temperaturetakes 6 hours or longer to arrive at the cold core—the responses are quitedramatic and include profound dehydration, exhaustion, and complex chemicalchanges in the blood. The ideal treatment is quite different in the hospitalsetting; in the field our treatment options are reduced to basic techniques ofpreventing further heat loss and some passive reheating maneuvers.CHRONIC HYPOTHERMIA [nav.xhtml#sub263]You do not have to be in a bitterly cold setting to die of hypothermia. In fact,most chronic hypothermia deaths occur in the 30°F to 50°F (0 to 10°C) range.This temperature range places almost all of North America in a high-risk statusyear-round. To survive hypothermia, be prepared to prevent it, recognize it ifit occurs, and know how to treat it. Dampness and wind are the most devastatingfactors to be considered: Dampness can reduce the insulation of clothing andcause evaporative heat loss, and the increased convection heat loss caused bywind can readily strip away body energy—the so-called windchill effect.Currently, many television weather forecasters discuss a “feels-liketemperature” to indicate either a coolness noticeable at cold temperatures fromwind or a warmness felt at hot temperatures with associated humidity. Butwindchill is an incredibly important concept in understanding the importanceeven a slight breeze has with regard to stripping body heat away from you and inknowing to immediately consider whatever shelter you can find—even a solitarytree—to minimize this loss if clothing is inadequate. Once, while a small groupof us were waiting for a bus in freezing temperatures in a remote area ofLeningrad, we simply took turns hiding behind each other as a windbreak. Andmany times, in a wilderness, I ducked behind that solitary tree!Factors important in preventing hypothermia are a high level of physicalconditioning, adequate nutritional and hydration status, avoiding exhaustion,and availability of adequate insulation. There is increased risk of “traumahypothermia” in the case of injury, especially shock. Even in mild temperatures,a person in shock can become hypothermic. It is very important to insulatepersons who are injured from the environment, particularly by providing groundinsulation.An initial response to cold is vasoconstriction, or the clamping down of surfaceblood vessels. This prevents heat from being conducted to the surface by theblood, and effectively increases the thickness of the mantle, or outer layerdepth, for increased insulation. Those who become profoundly hypothermic, with acore temperature below 90°F (32 .2°C), have concentrated their blood volume intoa smaller inner core. The amount of dehydration in these persons can beprofound, approaching 5 .8 quarts (5 .5 liters) in someone below 90°F,equivalent to the entire circulatory volume. This fluid loss comes not only fromthe vascular space but also from fluid between the cells and within the cells asthe body slowly adjusts to the continuing heat loss by shrinking bloodcirculation into the core and increasing the thickness of the mantle layer. Colddiuresis, an increased urination, is part of this response. At this point,rapid, sudden rewarming can lead to rewarming shock. Hospital methods ofrewarming must be coupled with tight metabolic control by adjusting bloodfactors such as clotting, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels.In chronic hypothermia, rewarming shock and loss of metabolic control are thecauses of death, not the so-called afterdrop phenomenon. Afterdrop, or thefurther lowering of core temperature after rewarming has started, is due to thecombination of conduction equilibration of heat and a circulation component. Byfar the most important aspect is conduction equilibration. This physicalproperty of conduction results in an equilibration of thermal mass as the higherwarmth of the core leaches into the colder mantle layer. The amount of afterdropthat occurs is primarily dependent upon the rate of cooling prior to therewarming process, not the method of rewarming!The goal of treatment for the chronic hypothermic victim is to prevent furtherloss of heat; this generally means providing shelter and/or more adequateclothing. Persons who are cold may well become hypothermic, and, if they are notexhausted, the best method of warming is to continue exercise. If the victim isexhausted, she will require rest and food. She is dehydrated and requiresfluids. If she can stand, a roaring fire can provide adequate, controlled heat.Since chronic hypothermia victims are usually exhausted, however, they will thennot be able to exercise themselves to warmth. Exercise is a method of generatingheat, as is shivering, but when energy stores are consumed, exhaustion commencesand significant hypothermia will begin unless further heat loss is stopped.Deepening hypothermia will lead to a semicomatose state—and worse. This victimneeds to be evacuated and hospitalized. Obviously, the real salvation of thissituation is a warm shelter, but if you are stuck in the elements, wrap toprevent further heat loss and transport to warmth as soon as possible. Chemicalheat packs and the like can be added to the wrap to help offset further heatloss, but this will not add enough heat to rewarm the patient, and thus havingthese items in your survival kit is practically worthless. If you’re heatingbottles of water to provide external heat, care must be taken not to burn thevictim. If evacuation is not feasible, add heat slowly to avoid rewarming shock.Huddling the victim between two rescuers in an adequate sleeping bag may be theonly alternative.ACUTE HYPOTHERMIA [nav.xhtml#sub264]Afterdrop is, however, a real problem for the acute or immersion hypothermic whohas had a significant exposure to cold water. As a rule of thumb, a person whohas been in water of 50°F (10°C) or less for a period of 20 minutes or longer issuffering from a severe amount of heat loss. That individual’s thermal mass hasbeen so reduced that he is in potentially serious condition. He should not beallowed to move around, as this will increase the blood flow to his very coldskin and facilitate a profound circulatory-induced afterdrop—one so great as tobe potentially lethal. If this same person is simply wrapped in a litter and notprovided with outside heat, there is a real danger his core temperature willcool down to a lethal level because of this profound amount of heat loss.The ideal treatment is rapid rewarming of the acute hypothermic by placing himin hot water (110°F, or 43°C) to allow rapid replacement of heat. The acutehypothermic may have an almost normal core temperature initially, but it isdestined to drop dramatically as his body equilibrates his heat store from hiscore to his very cold mantle. A roaring fire can be a lifesaver. If notavailable, huddling two rescuers with the victim in a large sleeping bag may bethe only answer—the same therapy that might have to be employed in the fieldtreatment of chronic hypothermia under some conditions.The person who has been immersed for less than 20 minutes in cold water can doanything he wants to rewarm. He can run around like crazy, stand by a fire, orjust wrap up in warm, dry insulation. The total body thermal mass is still highenough that the temperature equilibration by both the conductive and circulatorycomponents will not reduce the core temperature to a dangerous level.To review, the person who has been in cold water longer than 20 minutes hasexperienced such a profound heat loss that allowing him to run around or evenwrapping him without additional significant heat will cause a tremendous drop inhis core temperature—into a lethal range. The person who is fished out of coldwater after 2 hours or longer must be considered as approaching chronichypothermia. He has survived long enough that his physiological protectivemechanisms have resulted in dehydration and other changes that are so complexthat rapid rewarming can result in shock and death unless he is carefullymonitored in a hospital setting.COLD WATER SUBMERSION [nav.xhtml#sub265]Cold water submersion is always associated with asphyxiation and simultaneoushypothermia. Note that there is a distinct difference between immersion andsubmersion: Submersion indicates that the victim is entirely underwater;immersion means that the head is above water.Asphyxiation results in brain death, so prompt rescue and immediateimplementation of CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) play an important role inthe survival of the victim. Total submersion in cold water causes a rapid corecooling, which results in a lower oxygen demand by the brain and other bodytissues and increases the chance of survival over that of a victim of warm watersubmersion. Full recovery after 10 to 40 minutes of submersion can occur. CPRmust be continued until the body has been warmed to at least 86°F (30°C). Ifstill unresponsive at that temperature, the victim may be considered dead. Itmay take several hours of CPR while the patient is being properly rewarmed tomake this determination.The rewarming process for immersion victims should not be attempted in thefield. Hospital management of victims of cold water submersion is very complex.They are best transferred to centers experienced with this problem, but theywill never have a chance if rescuers do not implement CPR immediately. In anoff-the-grid situation, the safest approach in rewarming any hypothermia victimis to place them in a warm room, be patient, hydrate if and when they becomeconscious, and know that there are stories of dead, hypothermic people, wakingup after being left for dead in a warm room.COLD-STRESS INJURIES [nav.xhtml#sub266]FROSTNIP [nav.xhtml#sub267]Frostnip, or very light frostbite, can be readily treated in the field, ifrecognized early enough. This term is usually reserved for a form of superficialfrostbite, but I am convinced there really is a separate entity that should beconsidered frostnip: The skin turns pure white in a small patch, generally thetip of the nose or ear edges. When frostnip is detected, cup your hands and blowon the affected parts to effect total rewarming.Under identical exposure conditions, some people are more prone to this thanothers. On one of my trips into subarctic Canada, a companion almost constantlyfrostnipped his nose at rather mild temperatures (20°F, or 7°C). We frequentlyhad to warn him, as he seemed oblivious to the fact that the tip of his nosewould repeatedly frost.FROSTBITE [nav.xhtml#sub268]Frostbite is the freezing of skin tissue. The temperature of the skin must be24°F (4°C) before it will freeze. Risk for frostbite increases if the victim ishypothermic, dehydrated, injured, wearing tight-fitting clothing or boots, or isnot removing boots and changing socks or checking his feet for frozen tissue atleast nightly.Traditionally, several degrees of frostbite are recognized, but the treatmentfor all is the same. The actual degree of severity will not be known until afterthe patient has been treated. In the field, most cases of frostbite are notidentified until the area has already thawed and the blue, discolored skin isfound when finally changing socks or actually looking at the area in question.When superficial frostbite is suspected, thaw immediately so that it does notbecome a more serious, deep frostbite. Warm hands by withdrawing them into theparka through the sleeves—avoid opening the front of the parka to minimize heatloss. Feet should be thawed against a companion or cupped in your hands in aroomy sleeping bag or other insulated environment.The specific therapy for a deeply frozen extremity is rapid thawing in warmwater (approximately 110°F or 43°C). This thawing may take 20 to 30 minutes, butit should be continued until all paleness of the tops of the fingers or toes hasturned to pink or burgundy red, but no longer. This will be very painful andwill require pain medication (Rx: Norco 10/325, 1 tablet; nasal Stadol; orinjectable Nubain will probably be required).Avoid opening the blisters that form. Do not cut skin away but allow the digitsto autoamputate over the next 3 months. Blisters will usually last 2 to 3 weeksand must be treated with care to prevent infections (best done in a hospital bygloved attendants; lacking that, this is handled quite adequately using cleandressings to soak up the fluids).A black carapace will form in severe frostbite. This is a form of dry gangrene.The carapace will gradually fall off with amazingly good healing beneath.Efforts to hasten the carapace removal generally results in infection, delay inhealing, and increased tissue loss. Leave these blackened areas alone. The blackcarapace separation can take over 6 months, but it is worth the wait. Withoutsurgical interference, most frostbite wounds heal in 6 months to a year. Allpersons prior to leaving the grid already should have had their tetanus booster(within the previous 10 years is ideal, but see the discussion underimmunizations, page 215 [Chapter09.xhtml#page_215]). Treat for shock, withelevation of the feet and lowering of the head, as shock will frequently occurwhen these people enter a warm environment.Once the victim has been thawed, very careful management of the thawed part isrequired. Refreezing will result in substantial tissue loss, and this must beavoided. The patient sometimes becomes a stretcher case if the foot is involved,but not always. For that reason, it may be necessary to leave the foot or leg(s)frozen and allow the victim to walk back to the evacuation point or the facilitywhere the thawing will take place, realizing that the amount of damage isincreasing the longer the area remains frozen. Early, rapid thawing is essentialto minimize tissue loss. Do not allow the extremity to remain frozen unless itis essential to preserve life. Peter Freuchen, the great Greenland explorer,once walked days and miles keeping one leg frozen, knowing that when the legthawed, he would be helpless. He lost his leg but saved his life. And that’swhat can also happen to you: If you leave it frozen, you will lose the frozenpart.If a frozen foot has thawed and the patient must be transported, use cottonbetween toes (or fluff sterile gauze from the emergency kit and place it betweentoes) and cover other areas with a loose bandage to protect the skin duringsleeping bag stretcher evacuation. The use of Spenco 2nd Skin for blister carewould be ideal; see page 274 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_274].COLD-INDUCED BRONCHOSPASM [nav.xhtml#sub269]Cold-induced bronchospasm, a form of asthma sometimes called “frozen lung” orpulmonary chilling, occurs when breathing rapidly at very low temperatures,generally below 20°F (29°C). There is burning pain, sometimes coughing of blood,frequently asthmatic wheezing, and, with irritation of the diaphragm, pain inthe shoulder(s) and upper stomach that may last for 1 to 2 weeks. The treatmentis bed rest, steam inhalations, drinking extra water, humidification of theliving area, and no smoking. Avoid this condition by using parka hoods, facemasks, or breathing through mufflers, which result in rebreathing warm,humidified, expired air. The differential diagnosis must include the possibilityof pneumonia. Pneumonia patients will also have high fevers (see page 63[Chapter03.xhtml#page_63] for treatment).IMMERSION FOOT [nav.xhtml#sub270]Immersion foot results from wet, cool conditions with temperature exposures from68°F (20°C) down to freezing. This is an extremely serious injury that can beworse than frostbite. There are two stages to this problem. In the first stagethe foot is cold, swollen, waxy, and mottled with dark burgundy to bluesplotches. This foot is resilient to palpation, whereas the frozen foot is veryhard. The skin is sodden and friable. Loss of feeling makes walking difficult.The second stage lasts from days to weeks. The feet are swollen, red, and hot;blisters form; infection and gangrene are common.To prevent this problem, avoid nonbreathing (rubber) footwear when possible, drythe feet and change wool socks when they get wet or sweaty (certainly everynight), and periodically elevate, air, dry, and massage the feet to promotecirculation. Avoid tight, constricting clothing. At a minimum remove boots andsocks nightly, drying the feet and warming them before sleeping.Treatment differs from frostbite and hypothermia in the following ways: (1) Givethe patient 10 grains (650 mg) of aspirin every 6 hours to help decreaseplatelet adhesion and the clotting ability of the blood; (2) give additionalNorco 10/325 every 4 hours for pain, but discontinue as soon as possible; (3)provide 1 ounce (30 ml) of hard liquor every hour while awake and 2 ounces (60ml) every 2 hours during sleeping hours to vasodilate, or increase the flow ofblood to the feet. There is no data concerning the value of using Plavix as anantiplatelet agent in treating immersion foot, but if you have it in yourcardiac kit, use it. If you are unsure whether you are dealing with immersionfoot or frostbite, or if the victim may have suffered both, treat for frostbite.CHILBLAINS [nav.xhtml#sub271]Chilblains result from the exposure of dry skin to temperatures from 60°F (16°C)to freezing. The skin is red, swollen, frequently tender, and itching. This isthe mildest form of cold injury and no tissue loss results. Treatment is theprevention of further exposure with protective clothing over bare skin and, ifavailable, the use of ointments such as A+D ointment or Vaseline (whitepetrolatum). The hydrocortisone 1% cream from the Topical Bandaging Module willhelp when applied 4 times daily.HEAT-STRESS INJURIES [nav.xhtml#sub272]High environmental temperatures are frequently aggravated by strenuous work;humidity; reflection of heat from rock, sand, or other structures (even snow!);and the lack of air movement. It takes a human approximately 10 days to becomeheat acclimated. Once heat stress adaptation takes place, there will be adecrease in the loss of salt in the sweat produced to conserve electrolytes.Another major change is the rapid production of sweat and the formation oflarger quantities of sweat. Thus, the body is able to start its efficientcooling mechanism—sweating—more fully and with less electrolyte disturbance tothe body.Risk factors for heat-stress injuries include: * •High humidity * •Overweight * •Very young or very old * •Unaccustomed to heat * •Illness with fever or taking drugs such as antihistamines * •Clothing or equipment that interferes with heat loss (certain helmets, too much or restrictive clothing) * •Dehydration (drinking to prevent thirst will keep dehydration above 2%)Salt lost in sweat during work can normally be replaced at mealtimes. Anunacclimated man working an 8-hour shift would sweat 4 to 6 liters. The saltcontent is high, 3 to 5 grams per liter of sweat. With acclimatization, saltconcentration drops (1 to 2 grams per liter). An acclimatized man might lose 6to 16 grams of salt during an 8-hour shift in 6 to 8 liters of sweat. Theunacclimated man could lose 18 to 30 grams of salt in 4 to 6 liters of sweat.The average American diet contains 10 to 15 grams per day of salt. This meansthat an unacclimated worker could suffer from a salt deficit of 3 to 20 gramsper day. In the 10 days that it would take his body to become conditioned toheat stress, the total salt deficit could become substantial.A concern in heat-illness prevention is that a heat-stressed individual mustobtain adequate fluid replacement. If we focus on salt replacement to theexclusion of adequate water intake, the individual may become salt loaded andaccelerate his dehydration. Generally, an excess of salt or water over actualneeds is readily controlled by kidney excretion.Depletion of body salt can lead to progressive dehydration because the body willattempt to maintain a balance between electrolyte concentrations in tissuefluids with that in the cells. Deficient salt intake, with continued intake ofwater, tends to dilute tissue fluid. This suppresses the antidiuretic hormone(ADH; vasopressin) of the pituitary gland, preventing the kidney fromreabsorbing water. The kidney will then excrete a large volume of very diluteurine. The salt concentration of body fluids will be maintained, but at the costof increasing the depletion of body water, with a rapid onset of dehydration.Under heat stress, this can result in symptoms of heat exhaustion similar tothose resulting from water restriction, but with more severe signs ofcirculatory insufficiency and notably little thirst. Absence of chloride in theurine (less than 3 grams per liter) is diagnostic of salt deficiency, a test notperformable in the field.An opposite defect in the regulation of ADH can lead to severe loss of sodium bythe body, resulting in hyponatremia. A deficiency of ADH causes water retentionby the kidney and hyponatremia with rather low amounts of water ingestion.Another cause of hyponatremia would be overhydrating, basically causing waterintoxication. The discovery of hyponatremia as a reason for the collapse ofhikers in the Grand Canyon has been blamed on overhydration. But it is hard toimagine carrying that much water. Their condition may have resulted from ADHdeficiency. Military personnel during training have also suffered fromhyponatremia collapse, but in the case of an individual being allowed multiplebreaks for water whenever he felt like it (unrestricted access to limitlesswater), overhydration as the cause for hyponatremia makes sense.The ideal replacement fluid for the unacclimated worker in heat would be lightlysalted water (0.1%, or 1 teaspoon per gallon or 1 gram per liter) to preventwater or salt depletion. He needs 13 to 20 ounces (400 to 600 milliliters) ofwater before activity, and 3 to 6 ounces (90 to 180 milliliters) of water every10 to 15 minutes during an active period. Do not go longer than 30 minutesbetween drinks of water. Replacement fluids should not contain sugarconcentrations greater than 6 grams per 100 milliliters, as higherconcentrations slow gastric emptying. Acclimatized subjects need only water as areplacement fluid, but need 32 ounces (1 liter) per hour in activity during hotweather. Thirst develops when a person is about 2% dehydrated, so “drinking tothirst”—that is, drinking to satisfy thirst—is a safe way to prevent dehydrationand avoid overhydration.With no water available, how long could a person expect to survive? The answeris generally dependent upon the temperature and the amount of activity. At atemperature of 120°F (49°C) with no water available, the victim would expect tosurvive about 2 days (regardless of activity). This temperature is so high thatsurvival would not be increased beyond 2 days by even 4 quarts (3 .7 liters) ofwater. Ten quarts (9 .5 liters) might provide an extra day. At 90°F (32°C) withno water, the person could survive about 5 days if she walked during the day, 7days if travel was only at night or if no travel was undertaken at all. With 4quarts of water, survival would extend to 6 .5 days with day travel and to 10days with only night travel. With 10 quarts, days of survival would increase to8 and 15 respectively. If the highest temperature was 60°F (15 .5°C) with nowater, the active person could expect to survive 8 days, the inactive person 10days.Recommendations for preventing heat illness include: * •Water to prevent thirst. * •Avoiding alcohol. * •Wearing baggy clothing that promotes evaporation of sweat. * •Covering the head and shading the face. * •Keeping physically fit and allowing time for heat acclimatization. * •Avoiding exercise during the hottest time of the day.DILUTIONAL HYPONATREMIA [nav.xhtml#sub273]This is a condition in which the blood sodium level falls too low to maintainnormal body function, and is typically caused by drinking too much water and notconsuming adequate salt-containing food. Drinking only to treat thirst canprevent overhydration.Symptoms include headache, weakness, fatigue, lightheadedness, muscle cramps,nausea with or without vomiting, sweaty skin, normal core temperature, normal orslightly elevated pulse and respirations, and a rising level of anxiety. Thesepatients appear to have heat exhaustion or heat stroke since the signs andsymptoms overlap. Treating it like heat exhaustion by just adding water willharm the hyponatremia patient, making it worse. Increased severity ofhyponatremia includes disorientation, irritability, and combativeness, whichgives the problem a more common name: water intoxication. Untreated, theultimate result will be seizures, coma, and death.Note that heat-exhausted patients have a typically low output of yellowish tobrown urine (urinating every 6 to 8 hours) combined with thirst. Hyponatremiapatients urinate a clear stream frequently. Hyponatremia patients deny thirstand will admit to drinking lots of water.Patients with mild to moderate symptoms and a normal mental status may betreated in the field: The treatment for this condition is rest in shade with nofluid intake (even sports electrolyte drinks) and a gradual intake of saltyfoods while the kidneys reestablish a sodium balance. The ideal treatment fluidwould be an approximately 9% salt solution, which would be the equivalent of 3to 4 bouillon cubes in 1/2 cup (100 ml) of water. Once a patient develops hungerand thirst combined with normal urine output, the problem is solved. Restrictionof fluids for someone who is well hydrated, fortunately, is harmless. Patientswith an altered mental status require rapid evacuation to a medical facility.HEAT CRAMPS [nav.xhtml#sub274]Salt depletion can result in nausea, twitching of muscle groups, and at timessevere cramping of abdominal muscles, legs, or elsewhere. Treatment of heatcramps consists of stretching the muscles involved (avoid aggressive massage),resting in a cool environment, and replacing salt losses. Generally, 10 to 15grams of salt (a pinch per quart) and drinking to satisfy thirst should beadequate treatment.HEAT EXHAUSTION [nav.xhtml#sub275]Heat exhaustion is a classic example of compensatory shock (see page 13[Chapter02.xhtml#page_13]) and is encountered while working in a hotenvironment. The body has dilated the blood vessels in the skin to divert heatfrom the core to the surface for cooling. However, this dilation is sopronounced, coupled with profuse sweating and loss of fluid (also a part of thecooling process), that the blood pressure to the entire system falls too low toadequately supply the brain and the visceral organs. The patient will have arapid heart rate and other findings associated with the compensatory stage ofshock: pale color, nausea, dizziness, headache, and a lightheaded feeling.Generally, the patient is sweating profusely, but this may not always be thecase. The temperature may be elevated but often is not at all.Treat as for shock. Have the patient lie down immediately, elevate the feet toincrease the blood supply to the head, and restrict direct sunlight and the hotenvironment. Provide copious amounts of water, a minimum of 1 to 2 quarts (0.9to 1 .8 liters); lightly salted water would be best. Obviously, fluids can beadministered only if conscious. If the patient is unconscious, elevate the feet3 feet (1 meter) above head level and protect from aspiration of vomit. Givewater when the patient awakens.HEAT STROKE [nav.xhtml#sub276]Heat stroke (sun stroke) represents the complete breakdown of the heat controlprocess (thermal regulation) in the human body. With the loss of the ability tosweat, core temperatures rise over 105°F (40°C) rapidly and soon exceed 107.6°F(42°C), resulting in death if not treated aggressively. This is a trueemergency. It is a progressive stage of shock. The patient will be confused,very belligerent, and uncooperative, and will rapidly become unconscious.Immediately move into shade or erect a hasty barrier for shade. Spray with wateror other suitable fluid and fan vigorously to lower the core temperature throughevaporative cooling. Lacking other available fluid, this is the one time inmedicine when it may be justifiable to urinate on your patient. Massage thelimbs to allow the cooler blood of the extremities to return to core circulationmore readily, and fan to increase evaporative heat loss. Carefully monitor thecore temperature and cease cooling when it lowers to 102°F (39°C). Thetemperature may continue to fall or suddenly rise again.The most significant finding in heat stroke is the altered mental status of thevictim. While heat exhaustion victims can be confused, this should resolverapidly when they are in the shock treatment position (head down, feet up). Theconfusion and very often belligerent behavior of heat stroke victims make themvery hard to handle. While their skin is normally dry and hot, this is notalways the case. Suspect heat stroke in anyone who becomes confused and erraticin behavior, or unconscious, during exercise in a hot environment.This person should be evacuated as soon as possible, since his thermalregulation mechanism is quite unstable and will remain so for an undeterminablelength of time. He should be placed under a physician’s care as soon aspossible. Return to the grid if possible. Otherwise, treat as above.PRICKLY HEAT [nav.xhtml#sub277]Prickly heat is a heat rash caused by the entrapment of sweat in glands in theskin. This can result in skin irritation and frequently severe itching.Treatment includes cooling and drying the involved area and avoiding conditionsthat may induce sweating for a while. Providing several hours in a cool, dryenvironment daily is the only reliable treatment for prickly heat, but you maytreat for itch as indicated on page 149 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_149].LIGHTNING [nav.xhtml#sub278]Other than being totally toasted, cardiopulmonary arrest is the most significantlightning injury. People who can scream from fright or pain after an electricalbolt has struck are already out of immediate danger. Their wounds may be dressedlater. Those who appear dead must have immediate attention, as they may besaved. Normally, when dealing with mass casualties, the wounded are cared forpreferentially while the dead are left alone. Not in this instance! The victimis highly unlikely to die unless cardiopulmonary arrest occurs. Ifcardiopulmonary arrest does happen, 75% will die unless CPR is performed. As theheart tends to restart itself due to its inherent ability (automaticity), theheartbeat may return spontaneously in a short time. However, the respiratorysystem may be shut down for 5 to 6 hours before being able to resume its normalrhythm. Lack of oxygen will cause a person whose heart has restartedspontaneously to die.When administrating CPR, take precautions with the cervical spine, as theexplosion may have caused fractures of the neck or other portions of the body.While CPR is being performed, check for the pulse periodically. When the heartrestarts, maintain ventilations for the patient until respirations also resume.Attempt to continue this as long as possible; a victim may be revived even aftermany hours with no neurological defects—but only if CPR or respirationventilation has been properly performed. Remember, after a lightning strike thevictim’s eyes may be fixed and dilated, respirations ceased, heart stopped,blood pressure 0/0—all signs of clinical death. Pay no attention to thesefindings and administer CPR as long as physically possible.Lightning strike frequently causes vascular spasms in its victim. This canresult in faint, or even nonpalpable, pulses. When the vaso-spasm clears, whichit generally does within a few hours, the pulses return.Neurological defects are the second major consequence of lightning hits.Approximately 72% of victims suffer loss of consciousness, and three-quarters ofthese people will have a cardiopulmonary arrest. Direct damage to the brain canresult, but frequently the neurological defects, including seizure activity andabnormal brainwave studies, eventually revert to normal. Two-thirds of victimswill have neurological defects in the lower half of their bodies; one-third willsuffer from paralysis of the upper half. Amnesia and confusion of events afterthe accident are common but are usually transient.Most will have amnesia, confusion, and short-term memory loss that may last from2 to 5 days. These effects are similar to those experienced by electroconvulsiveshock therapy patients. The person may be able to talk intelligently but shortlythereafter not remember the conversation had taken place.Burns from lightning itself are generally not severe. Very high voltage iscarried over the surface of conductors; the high voltage of lightning issimilarly carried over the surface of the body with minimal internal burndamage, the so-called flashover effect.Direct electrical burn damage can occur, however, and when it does it usuallyconsists of one of several types. Linear burns start at the head, progress downthe chest, and split to continue down both legs. These burns are usually ½ to 1½inches (1 .3 cm to 3 .8 cm) in width, and are first and second degree. Theyfollow areas of heavy sweat concentration. Punctate burns look like a buckshotwound. These are full thickness, third-degree burns that are discrete, roundwounds, measuring from a few millimeters to a centimeter (¼ inch to ½ inch) inwidth. These seldom require grafting as the area is so small. Feathering orferning burns are diagnostic of lightning injury. They fade within a few hoursto days and require no treatment. This phenomenon is not a true burn but theeffect of electron showers on the skin. They have a characteristic reddish fernappearance that covers the skin surface—especially the trunk. Thermal burns alsoresult from vaporization of surface moisture, combustion of clothing, heatedmetal buckles, and so on. Thermal burns are the most common type oflightning-associated burn, and they can be first, second, or third degree.The flashover effect saves most victims from burn trauma. However, as noted,burns do occur. Persons with head burns are two and a half times more likely todie than those without. Possibly more surprising, persons with leg burns arefive times more likely to die than those who do not have them. This is probablyrelated to a ground or step current phenomenon.The four mechanisms of direct lightning injury are: (1) direct strike, (2)splash, (3) step current, and (4) blunt trauma. To minimize the chance oflightning injury, the following should be noted about these mechanisms: * 1.Direct strikes are most likely to take place in the open, especially if you carry metal or objects above shoulder level. Shelter should be taken within the cone of safety, described as a 45-degree angle down from a tall object, such as a tree or cliff face. But that cone of safety ain’t all that safe. Being too close to the tree or cliff face can result in increased exposure to splash current or ground current; too near the outer edge and the zone of safety simply fails and you have increased exposure to direct strike. * 2.Splash injuries are perhaps the most common mechanism of lightning hit—the current strikes a tree or other object and jumps to a person whose body has less resistance than the object the lightning initially struck. Splash injuries may occur from person to person, when several people are standing close together. It has jumped from fences after having struck the fence some distance away. It has splashed to people from plumbing fixtures inside houses that were struck. Avoid close proximity to walls, fences, plumbing, or other items that could be struck. * 3.Step current is also called stride voltage and ground current. The lightning current spreads out in a wave along the ground from the struck object, with the current strength decreasing as the radius from the strike increases. If the victim’s feet are at different distances from the point of the strike, and the resistance in the ground is greater than through his body, he will complete a circuit. Large groups of people can be injured simultaneously in this manner. Keeping feet and legs together, while squatting down, minimizes the chances of step voltage injury. * 4.Blunt trauma, or the sledgehammer effect, results from the force of the lightning strike, or the explosive shock wave that it produces. The victim may be forcibly knocked to the ground. Over 50% of victims will have their eardrums ruptured in one or both ears. This may result from direct thermal damage, the thunder shock wave, or even skull fractures from the blunt trauma. Barotrauma to the ears may be reduced by keeping the mouth open during times of great danger.In the above scenario a person should squat, with legs together and mouth openin a zone of safety—but not too near the protective tree or cliff face. Spreadparty members out to maximize the chance that there will be survivors, and thusrescuers, if lightning strikes appear imminent. Get boats into a zone of safetynear shore, against the tree line or cliff face. Other than the immediatepresence of lightning, is there any warning? At times there will be the smell ofozone, hair may stand on end, metal climbing equipment may start to vibrate, orSt. Elmo’s fire may be present. Good luck!HIGH ALTITUDE ILLNESSES [nav.xhtml#sub279]You will not need to worry about high altitude illness of any kind unless youmust depart suddenly from a lower attitude and head for the hills—the highhills, that is. High-altitude-related illnesses can generally be avoided bygradual exposure to higher elevation, with the sleeping ascent rate notexceeding 1,000 feet (300 meters) per day when above 9,000 feet (2,800 meters).Alternatively, avoid sleeping at greater than 2,000-foot (600-meter) incrementsevery 2 days when suddenly traveling from near sea level to 10,000 feet (3,000meters). A high carbohydrate diet, consisting of at least 70% carbohydratesstarted 1 to 2 days prior to ascent, remaining well hydrated, and exercisingmoderately until altitude acclimatized, all help prevent high altitude illness.The three major clinical manifestations of this disease complex are acutemountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high altitudecerebral edema (HACE). As will be noted, the symptoms progress ratherinsidiously. They are not clear-cut, separate diseases—they often occurtogether. The essential therapy for each of them is recognition and descent.This is lifesaving and more valuable than the administration of oxygen or drugs.To prevent high altitude illnesses, it is helpful to “climb high but camp low”—that is, spend nights at the lowest camp elevation feasible.ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS (AMS) [nav.xhtml#sub280]Rarely encountered below 6,500 feet (2,000 meters), acute mountain sickness iscommon in persons going above 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) without taking the timeto acclimatize for altitude. Symptoms beginning soon after ascent consist ofheadache (often severe), nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, weakness, sleepdisturbance, and occasionally a periodic breathing known to medical personnel asCheyne-Stokes respiration.Prevention, as with all of the high altitude illnesses, is gradual ascent above9,000 feet (2,800 meters) and light physical activity for the first severaldays. For persons especially prone to AMS, it may be helpful to takeacetazolamide (Diamox) prophylactically, 125 mg every 12 hours starting the dayof ascent and continuing the next 3 to 5 days. This medication helps prevent ortreat the acid base imbalance of the blood that can occur in some people fromthe increased loss of carbon dioxide at high altitudes. The treatment dose ofacetazolamide is 250 mg twice daily for 5 days. This prescription drug should beadded to your medical kit if you expect to encounter elevations above 9,000 feet(2,800 meters) suddenly. See acetazolamide, page 265 [Chapter10.xhtml#page_265].The best AMS treatment is descent, and relief can often be felt even if thedescent is only 2,000 to 3,000 feet (600 to 900 meters). Full relief can beobtained by descending below 6,500 feet (2,000 meters). Stricken individualsshould avoid heavy exercise, but sleep does not help as breathing is slowerduring sleep, making oxygen deprivation worse. Oxygen will help only if takencontinuously for 12 to 48 hours. Aspirin may be used for headache. Percogesic oribuprofen from the Non-Rx Oral Medication Module may be used. In addition todescent, Decadron (dexamethasone), 4 mg tablets every 6 hours until below thealtitude at which symptoms appeared, has been shown to help control the symptomsof AMS. Decadron tablets or injection should be added to your medical kit if youexpect to encounter elevations above 10,000 feet (3000 meters). See Decadron,pages 284 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_284] and 290 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_290].HIGH ALTITUDE PULMONARY EDEMA (HAPE) [nav.xhtml#sub281]High altitude pulmonary edema is rare below 8,000 feet (2,500 meters) but occursat higher altitude in those who are poorly acclimatized. It is more likely inpersons between the ages of 5 and 18 (the incidence is apparently less than 0.4%in persons over 21, and as high as 6% in those younger), in those who have hadthis problem before, and in those who have been altitude acclimatized and whoare returning to high altitude after spending approximately 2 weeks at sealevel.Prevention is altitude acclimatization as discussed in the section on AMS above.Nifedipine (Procardia), 20 mg every 8 hours to be taken during the ascent phaseand for 3 additional days at altitude, has been shown to work prophylactically.Symptoms develop slowly, within 24 to 60 hours of arrival at high altitude, withshortness of breath, irritating cough, weakness, rapid heart rate, and headachethat rapidly progress to intractable cough with bloody sputum, low-grade fever,and increasing chest congestion. Symptoms may progress profoundly at night.Patients should be evaluated by listening to their chests for a fine cracklingsound (called rales) and checking resting pulse rate nightly. A pulse rate ofgreater than 110 per minute, or respirations greater than 16 per minute after a20-minute rest, is an early sign of HAPE. Respirations over 20 per minute andpulse over 130 per minute indicates a medical emergency, and the patient must beevacuated immediately. Without treatment, death usually occurs within 6 to 12hours after onset of coma.Descent to lower altitude is essential and should not be delayed. Treatmentincludes nifedipine, 20 mg sublingual (or chewed and swallowed), given upondiagnosis and repeated every 6 hours. A descent of as little as 2,000 to 3,000feet (600 to 900 meters) may result in prompt improvement.HIGH ALTITUDE CEREBRAL EDEMA (HACE) [nav.xhtml#sub282]High altitude cerebral edema is less common than AMS or HAPE, but it is moredangerous. Death has occurred from HACE at altitudes as low as 8,000 feet (2,500meters); however, HACE is rare below 11,500 feet (3,500 meters). The symptomsare increasingly severe headache, mental confusion, emotional behavior,hallucinations, unstable gait, loss of vision, loss of dexterity, and facialmuscle paralysis. The victim may fall into a restless sleep, followed by a deepcoma and death.Descent is essential. Oxygen should be administered starting at 6 liters/minutefor the first 15 minutes, followed by a flow rate of 2 liters per minute.Decadron (dexamethasone) should be given in large doses, namely 10 mgintravenously, followed by 4 mg every 6 hours intramuscularly until the symptomssubside. Response is usually noted within 12 to 24 hours, and the dosage may bereduced after 2 to 4 days and gradually discontinued over a period of 5 to 7days. Immediate descent and oxygen are recommended to prevent permanentneurological damage or death.It is hard to imagine how a person planning on suddenly leaving the grid wouldrequire such a rapid ascent in altitude as to endanger themselves from analtitude-related injury. But I have included this abbreviated discussion,because that is what prepping is all about, being prepared for any circumstance."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 [nav.xhtml#ch11]THE OFF-GRID MEDICAL KIT [nav.xhtml#ch11]ALTERNATIVE AND HERBAL THERAPY [nav.xhtml#sub283]Alternative therapy in the context of this book is not therapy prescribed by anosteopathic or allopathic physician—in other words, not by the usual medicalsystem you have contact with throughout the grid.It is not so “alternative” for many. Common household remedies that have stoodthe test of time are in this category. Some more ancient, yet probablyeffective, are also included. I am a traditional MD-type of doctor. I preferproven, rigorously studied, outcome-based protocols to the case-study-influencedor historic, traditional healing folklore remedies, but there is a place forboth when off the grid. Depending on the issue of being off the grid, or workingafter there is no grid, even the greatest achievements of big pharma will do usno good when their products are not available. Due to my many years of workingin third-world countries and in remote wilderness situations, certainly off thegrid in many regards, I have studied the best of the traditional remedies, andwhile I prefer many more proven methods, I list them throughout this book asalternative therapies when you are off the grid.First, what can we bring with us from the grid? What is the most valuable? Howdo we obtain them?With each item we must consider if we are doing a grab and go or staying put. Ifthe former, can we reposition or stockpile items in a secure area, or is thisnot practical? What items are perishable, and do items have a realisticshelf-life?To start this process, try to obtain the items in the Off-Grid Medical Kit. Thissection indicates that many are easily obtained over-the-counter medications anditems, but some components of this kit are prescription—when used on humans.Some of these same items are available without prescriptions when purchasedthrough pet stores for use on fish, for example.While it seems it would be of interest to the reader to have a whole chapterdevoted to alternative or folklore therapy, it would be of no real use except asa reassurance that the items you see being used are not something you need toconsider beyond your normal provisioning. In other words, for the alternativetherapies to be of potential use to you, they have got to be something you canimprovise from stuff that is just lying around long after the grid is gone,items you did not consider beyond the normal necessities of life or knew thatyou could scrounge. In fact, herbal medicine is the earliest scrounging thathumankind has endeavored, other than predator-killed carrion that prehumansscavenged.Throughout this book you will be advised when an item from the Off-Grid MedicalKit should be used and how to use it. Additionally, an alternative orfield-expedient technique will be discussed to aid you during those moments whenthe support kit supplies are lacking.The most compact kit will also be the one that contains both multifunctional andcross-functional components. This requires the minimal number of medications butprovides in-depth coverage when a particular medication is consumed.Taking the above into account, study the potential first aid materialrequirements, anticipate the most likely serious events that could conceivablyoccur, and tailor the kit to the medical skill level of the participants.Additional factors to consider are the weight, cost, bulk, and availability ofcomponents. Consider the number in the party, length of survival situation,degree of risk anticipated, and whether or not other people beyond those of theimmediate party will be treated.When companies design commercial kits, two additional factors must also beconsidered. One is what real estate agents call “curb appeal .” It must lookimpressive at first glance. The other is to plan for various price points totarget different markets. These constraints give commercial kits a disadvantageover the kit you put together yourself.Most injuries and conditions described in this book can be treated with verylittle in the way of kit components. But I have included here state-of-the-artitems that would provide ideal treatment aid. As this book has been written forthose who may be isolated without ready access to professional medical care, thetreatments discussed go beyond normal first aid. The kit described in thischapter similarly goes beyond what would be considered a “first aid” kit, butthe initial modules are easily usable under first aid conditions. The Off-Gridkit consists of 5 units: Topical Bandaging Module, Non-Rx Oral MedicationModule, Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module, the Rx Injectable Medication Module,and the Rx Cardiac Medication Module. The Off-Grid kit is further divided withsuggestions for components of a “bug-out bag,” items to carry in an emergencywhen needing to vacate your normal location, and for long-term stockage for your“settlement stock” with both one-year and five-year quantity suggestions.As a minimum, the Topical Bandaging Module and Non-Rx Oral Medication Modulewill generally fulfill the vast majority of emergency treatment requirements.The prescription modules are designed for long-term and more advanced patientcare. All items listed in the kit modules can be obtained without aprescription, except in the modules clearly marked “Rx .”All nonprescription medications have packaging that describes the officialdosages and appropriate warnings or precautions concerning their use.Prescription medications usually have elaborate package inserts with this sameinformation. When obtaining a prescription drug for your medical kit, requestthis insert from your physician or copy the information from the Physicians’Desk Reference (PDR) or from the Tarascon Pharmacopoeia, which are available atlibraries and even as smartphone apps.All items should be obtained in stock bottles, which usually come in 90 or 100count. Stock bottles of the items listed should last at least 5 to 10 yearsbeyond their expiration date. Some medications listed are too expensive for astock bottle or need to be ordered individually, such as the injectionmedications. Obtain what you can; having more than you require could proveuseful if the grid collapses, as these items will be invaluable and might beuseful in barter circumstances.The quantities of all items can be split into minimal amounts that would beincluded in a bug-out bag lasting 2 to 3 weeks. Because the suggested listincludes items with multifunctional capability (i .e ., the item can be used formore than one purpose) and items with cross-functional uses (i .e ., one purposecan be treated by several of the items), the quantities of items in the kit canbe reduced. Cost is also a factor in recommending products. When significanttreatments are required, such as implementing the use of antibiotics, thepatient should be evacuated if possible. A patient with any injury, symptom, orinfection that does not improve within 48 hours should be evacuated todefinitive medical care. For those of you preparing for a situation whereevacuation is unlikely or impossible, evaluate the stock requirements and planaccordingly.Most medications will have an expiration date of 1 to 5 years from the date ofpurchase. The expiration dates have been calculated to guarantee the productwill not have degraded more than 3% of the active ingredient. A study hasreported that an evaluation of eight products stored in their originalcontainers for 28 to 40 years past their expiration date retained greater than90% of their potency. Storage affects shelf-life—generally heat and sunlightdegrade products, but a study released in 2019 in Wilderness & EnvironmentalMedicine evaluated a wide range of items that were stored in very unfavorableconditions over a year beyond expiration date and were found to have lost noneof their potency.Aspirin does degrade rather fast and will soon smell like vinegar, indicating itis losing potency. Epinephrine solution turns brown as it degrades intonorepinephrine, which fortunately is an active metabolite but works to a lesserdegree in treating anaphylaxis. Avoid capsules and choose tablets, since theformer are very sensitive to heat and dampness. Liquids usually degrade fasterthan solids.Brand names have been used to simplify spelling and product recognition or tominimize potential confusion between similar-sounding names and variations ingeneric names among American, Canadian, and British sources. Prepper blogs are agreat avenue to find sourcing of many products that are otherwise available onlyvia traditional physician prescriptions. Some items can be purchased frominternational, agricultural, or aquarium vendors. Always give the Internet ashot at it.chpt_fig_049 [../Images/chpt_fig_049.png] Alternative improvisation.Alternatives to the use of the medications listed below are outlined in thetreatment discussions for various problems throughout the book. Alternatives tomedical supplies are also discussed below and are indicated by a check mark.Further, obtain the book Medicinal Plants of North America, 2nd edition, by JimMeuninck, for a color-illustrated and concise book to help you identify and useherbal and plant remedies.

This inert hydrogel consists of 96%water and 4% polyethylene oxide. It is used on wet, weeping wounds to absorbfluids and protect the injury. This is a perfect prevention or cure for frictionblisters. It revolutionized the field treatment of first-, second-, andthird-degree burns, as it can be applied to all three as a covering and for painrelief. This item should be in every medical kit. The ideal covering pad is theSpenco Adhesive Knit bandage. If used in treating blisters, remove only theouter covering of cellophane from the 2nd Skin, cover with the Adhesive Knitbandage, and occasionally dampen with clean water to maintain the hydrogel’shydration. It will last a lot longer this way when in short supply. There are avariety of similar dressings sold in virtually all drugstores that are labeledas such.chpt_fig_049 [../Images/chpt_fig_049.png] The cooling technique for burns (seepage 139 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_139]) and a piece of tape over hot spots (seepage 138 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_138]) can simulate the benefits of Spenco 2ndSkin. Cellophane, plastic food wrappers, or plastic sheeting of any kind makesan excellent wound covering.

See pages 151 [Chapter06.xhtml#page_151] and 266[Chapter10.xhtml#page_266].ROCEPHIN® (CEFTRIAXONE), 500 MG VIALBug-out bag (2 weeks) Settlement stock (1 year) (5 years) Quantity 0 24 48A broad-spectrum antibiotic of the cephalosporin class, the injectablemedication has a wide range of bactericidal activities, including for pneumoniaand bronchitis, skin infections, urinary tract and kidney infections, gonorrhea,pelvic infection, bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, andsome types of meningitis. Each vial will require 0.9 ml of lidocaine 1% to mixthe contents. The reconstituted medication is stable at room temperature for 3days.VISTARIL 50 MG/ML, 10 ML VIALBug-out bag (2 weeks) Settlement stock (1 year) (5 years) Quantity 0 4 12A brand name of hydroxyzine hydrochloride, uses and dosages are the same asindicated for Atarax in the Rx Oral/Topical Medication Module (page 287[Chapter11.xhtml#page_287]). Obviously, in the treatment of profound vomiting,injections of medication will work better than oral administration. Thissolution can be mixed in the same syringe as the Nubain for administration asone injection.EPIPEN, EPIPEN JR, SYMJEPIThe EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are automatic injection syringes. Use only on oneperson. The EpiPen delivers 0.3 ml (0.3 mg) of 1:1000 epinephrine; the EpiPen Jrdelivers 0.3 ml (0.15 mg) of 1:1000 epinephrine. The EpiPen devicesautomatically give the medication intramuscularly (IM). Due to the high cost ofauto-injection syringes, I suggest that your physician order several vials ofepinephrine 1:10,000 solution for injection, and the appropriate syringes foradministration. See page 292 [Chapter11.xhtml#page_292]. The Symjepi is amanually injected prefilled syringe in 0.3 and 0.15 mg strengths, approved in2019 by the FDA and available commercially in early 2020.Cardiac Medication Module (contains Rx and non-Rx components) [nav.xhtml#sub288]Aspirin 81 mg chewable tabletsNitroglycerin sublingual tablets, 0.4 mg, sealed bottle of 25 or 100 tablets; ornitroglycerin spray, 60-spray canisterClopidogrel 75 mg tabletsAtenolol 25 mg tablets (beta-blocker)ASPIRIN 81 MG CHEWABLE TABLETSBug-out bag (2 weeks) Settlement stock (1 year) (5 years) Quantity 14 400 1,000Do not use enteric-coated (EC) tablets, which are slower to work than chewabletablets. A larger number of aspirin can be carried to treat fever, inflammation,and pain. Not for use in children or during pregnancy. This medication is usedto prevent platelet aggregation during a heart attack. Aspirin treatment reducedmortality by 23% in acute myocardial infarction (MI) in a published trial calledISIS-2. Aspirin is a platelet cycloxygenase inhibitor (see also clopidogrel,below).NITROGLYCERIN SUBLINGUAL TABLETS, 0.4 MGBug-out bag (2 weeks) Settlement stock (1 year) (5 years) Quantity 0 unlesssomeone at risk 100 to 400 100 to 500Once the seal on the bottle is open, the medication must be used within 6months, regardless of its original expiration date. Brand name Nitrostat isstable for 24 months after the bottle is opened, or until the expiration date onthe bottle, whichever is earlier. Nitroglycerin is degraded more rapidly by heatand moisture. In tropical environments it is better to carry nitroglycerinspray. This remains stable for 2 years, even with use. It needs to be primedwith a spray before use. Meta-analysis of pre-thrombolytic-era nitrate trialsfound that nitroglycerin treatment resulted in a 35% reduction in mortality fromacute MI (vasodilator).CLOPIDOGREL (PLAVIX) TABLETS, 75 MGBug-out bag (2 weeks) Settlement stock (1 year) (5 years) Quantity 0 365 perperson with diagnosis 5 x as manyThis is another platelet inhibitor. This medication is very expensive, sostocking a kit with more than 10 becomes an economic challenge. The CURE trialshowed that clopidogrel therapy resulted in an 18% reduction in MI, death, orstroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and non-ST elevated MItreated medically. This medication is a platelet ADP-receptor inhibitor, so itworks differently than aspirin, and the effects are additive when both aretaken.If someone has a history of phlebitis, pulmonary embolism, they should be onthis medication routinely for 6 months from the episode. Persons with cardiacstents need to be on it for life.ATENOLOL (TENORMIN) TABLETS, 25 MGBug-out bag (2 weeks) Settlement stock (1 year) (5 years) Quantity 0 24 24Atenolol is a beta-blocker. ISIS-I and MIAMI trials showed that beta-blockertherapy resulted in a 13% reduction in mortality with either atenolol ormetoprolol. Its use reduces heart rate, blood pressure, and ischemia, raisesventricular fibrillation threshold, and reduces the likelihood of malignantventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Do not give if the person has a slowheart rate (below 60 beats per minute).REPLACEMENT MEDICATIONS [nav.xhtml#sub289]It is very common on wilderness trips and in remote areas for families to tradeone item for another, and sometimes this means bartering items from or for yourmedical kit. Of course, doctors abhor the concept of writing a prescriptionmedication except for a specific person for a specific diagnosis. But we aretalking about a period when and where the grid does not exist. Tradingprescription medications is illegal and can result in serious jail time.Exchanging or providing someone medications is not a trivial issue, and it wouldonly be done in response to a desperate situation. Otherwise your medicationstores are sacrosanct.It is possible to acquire the skills to augment or replace your medications withherbals, and we all know that some of these can also be illegal. And some can bepoisonous. To use herbal supplementation, you have to really know what you aredoing. Identification, storage, and extraction of the useful component are alltechnically challenging.Prepping in general is technically challenging. It may well pay you to rise tothe occasion and learn about herbal medications. These are the most useful,common plants for this purpose in North America: * •Garlic: infection treatment, stimulant * •Rosemary: antioxidants, stimulant * •Basil: antioxidants, infections * •Mint: stimulant, digestive * •Lemon balm: tonic for mild depression, irritability, and anxiety * •Fennel: anti-inflammatory, analgesic, appetite stimulant, antiflatulent * •Lovage: respiratory and digestive tonic, antibronchitic * •Oregano: antiseptic, antiflatulant, stimulant for bile and stomach acid, antiasthmatic * •Cilantro (coriander): antiflatulant, bloating, and cramps * •Horseradish: perspirant, stimulant * •Thyme: antiseptic, antiasthmatic, stimulantThe identification of and uses for these herbs are explained in detail by JimMeuninck in his books Medicinal Plants of North America, 2nd edition (FalconGuides, 2016), Basic Illustrated Medicinal Plants (Falcon Guides, 2019), andEdible Wild Plants and Useful Herbs, 2nd edition (Falcon Guides, 2018). Thesethree books should form the basis of your literary plunge into herbal foraging,but you will want to take lessons from experienced herbalists to safely and moreeffectively use herbals, just as you will need to take advanced first aid andadvanced wilderness first aid courses to effectively form the basis of yourgeneral medical care while off the grid."},{"pageContent":"PREPPER’S MEDICAL RESOURCE BOOKSHELF [nav.xhtml#prepper]I have worked with Buck Tilton, Cliff Jacobson, and Jim Meuninck over the pastthree decades on multiple projects. They have the attributes in common of beingblessed with extraordinary common sense, great technical skills, and immensefirsthand experience. James Green goes into compounding and storing herbals to alevel of expertise like no one else. The honor of knowing which medicinal plantsand herbs make the most sense to understand, how to identify them, and how touse them, goes to Jim Meuninck, whom you need to read as a minimum.Part of being a prepper is acquiring knowledge, skills, and even ideal survivalsupplies. You almost can’t have too much of any of these things, but youcertainly require at least the minimum. These books are part of the “a least theminimum” for your library on medicine and survival. There are many other goodbooks and experts, and I know, love, and respect many others. Frankly, you justcan’t learn too much, so this list is only your starting point.
