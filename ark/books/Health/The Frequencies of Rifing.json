that takes its name from Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, a great scientist, researcher and inventor who, in the early decades of the last century , managed to discover an infallible method to devitalize pathogens (viruses, bacteria and fungi). Rife was one of the first in the world to use electromagnetic frequencies for therapeutic use and certainly the first to use this technology for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"pathogens. More than 80 years after his first successes, the technology invented by Dr. Rife has evolved in an extraordinary way . Today, we can find many modern electronic devices being sold that are programmed with software and provide for an excellent user experience. The modern Rife equipment cannot only apply the frequencies for disabling individual microor ganisms (killing frequencies), but also an immense number of frequencies able to provide health benefits and/or well-being (healing), detoxification (detox) and the application of active ingredients (molecular weight and relative frequencies). Therefore, Rifing means the exposure to electromagnetic fields, characterized by precise frequencies and harmonics, by means of various transmission devices, which are connected to a Rife Machine: i.e., to a frequency generator . This technology offers the most extensive and complete application of electromagnetic waves for therapeutic purposes. In Germany and South Africa, as well as some other countries, frequency devices (such as Rife Machines ) are legally authorized as medical instruments. In all other countries, according to the legislation in force, such frequency systems can be legally used only for testing, energy balancing, life extension, relaxation and"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"experiments on bacterial cultures or laboratory animals. The main purpose of this manual is to facilitate the identification of a Subject and the corresponding program of frequencies, according to criteria of logic and of origin, then be used with a frequency device. Essentially , it aims to remove confusion from the process of choosing the right frequencies to use. More than 7000 frequency programs are listed. They cover the human body organs, pathogens, diseases, homeopathic products, minerals, vitamins, chakras and more. They are sorted and catalogued in a way that makes it much easier to locate the information that will allow the best program choices. Thanks to the Notes and the fact that all of the programs related to a topic are listed together and when necessary , repeated in additional paragraphs, it is possible to deal with a complex situation, following dif ferent logical paths and then experimenting with various programs of frequencies, until reaching satisfactory or conclusive results. Basically , this means that there are many situations you can try . If this does not work, follow an alternative approach, using factors that may be considered mar ginal at the beginning or those that are radical and profound. For this reason, the condition to be treated should always be studied well, with close attention paid to the written Notes. The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"7 Even when it comes to a simple or a limited choice of cases, comparing two programs of nearly identical frequencies or locating an Author that is considered more reliable, the reader will be able to perform choices that with the passage of time will be more and more tar geted and ef fective. The most important novelty introduced in this edition is the one concerning the introduction in the Notes section of the most known pathogens that could cause any kind of health problem. It is in fact now established that fungi, bacteria and viruses are almost always involved in all diseases. Sometimes they are the cause of the same, others may arise or proliferate where a disease is located. Therefore, whatever the cause, the devitalization of the possible pathogens involved, can represent the temporary or permanent solution of the health problem. When you understand and can test the ef fectiveness of this methodology , with a Rife Machine, it is then possible to achieve increasingly satisfactory results. There are thousands of pathogens that can cause very serious damage to an organism. In the Notes section, you will find listed only the best known or those involved in the most common or serious health problems, so the list is not complete and for many diseases it may be missing a precise reference. For this reason, especially when a frequency program does not achieve results, it is always advisable"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"to perform all possible research and techniques (e.g., Biofeedback), in order to identify which pathogens may be present in any condition of discomfort. Y ou may be amazed to discover that even a problem that we cannot even imagine can be caused by pathogens (e.g., mental problems or back pain), which may actually be caused by them. Additionally , the order of the programs have changed compared to the previous edition and we tried to follow a disposition that is much closer to that normally assumed in the Anatomy texts. In conclusion, read carefully and patiently , this manual can very quickly enhance the expert use of a Rife Machine such as Spooky2. 8 The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Dr. Royal Raymond Rife Royal Raymond Rife was born on May 16, 1888, in the state of Nebraska, by Royal Raymond Rife senior of Ohio and Ida May Cheney of Creston, Iowa. From a young age, he devoted all his interests in the field of bacteriology . He worked hard in this field and photographed many species of microor ganisms for the University of Heidelber g. Thanks to the important contributions that Rife provided to the University , he was awarded an honorary doctorate in parasitology in 1914."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Since his studies on bacteria necessitated frequent use of microscopes, Dr. Rife developed a propensity for optics and began studies in this area. From 1915 to 1920, Rife worked in his private laboratory , identifying and classifying the microor ganisms that cause many diseases. By the end of 1920, he had begun to work on cancer , but the limits of the microscopes available at this time hindered him in the discovery of the viral cause of disease. In fact, standard search microscopes built with optical lenses, like those manufactured today , could only enlar ge a microor ganism up to 2,500 times. Rife felt that with this limitation, he could never discover the true cause of many illnesses. In 1920-21 Rife built his first microscope; the famous \"Universal Microscope,\" which was a thousand times more powerful than other traditional microscopes. His microscope used monochromatic light frequencies and quartz prisms instead of electron beams, which kill microbes. Rife was the first man to observe microor ganisms without killing them. By 1938, Rife had built another four models of microscopes, each more precise and powerful than the one before, finally reaching up to 60,000 X magnifications. For the first time in history , photographs and film footage was taken of viruses and bacteria. (See the \"The San Diego Union\" news"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"article). It is in those years that Rife began to work using instruments capable of delivering electromagnetic frequencies. Rife wondered: \"What would happen if I subjected these micro-or ganisms to different electrical frequencies?\" W ith this revolutionary idea, he began to gather all the necessary tools such as standard research microscopes, electronic generators capable of producing the high frequencies with which he would work, bacteriological test tubes and instruments, guinea pig cages and other animals, machines for photographing species and additional equipment to build their own models. Between 1921 and 1922, he built the first machine capable of delivering electromagnetic frequencies, the Rife Ray 1. Rife was assisted by Lee DeForest, the father of modern electronic tubes, which gave an important contribution to the first radio technology . The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition 9"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"In 1933, he began working with Philip Hoyland, who lived in nearby Atladena, California. Hoyland helped Rife to build equipment, equipped with a ray tube that is a kind of plasma antenna consisting of a lamp filled with helium, powered by a very high voltage and driven by precise radiofrequencies. Both in the experiments performed in the laboratory and directly on the persons in care, Rife used this device to emit the frequencies capable of devitalizing the microbes by resonating them with electromagnetic waves. Hoyland built most of the first machines, and in 1938 partnered with Royal Rife, to form Beam Rays Inc. This company produced the Rife Ray 5 or Beam Ray , until it became bankrupt a few years later after a series of vicissitudes and judicial problems. Through arduous experimentation and looking through the microscopes of his invention while applying dif ferent frequencies, Dr . Rife discovered that it was possible in this way to devitalize these"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"microor ganisms. In fact, to determine which frequency would have killed a particular microor ganism, it was absolutely essential to be able to observe them while they were alive, so that they could see the ef fect in real time. His work was based on a basic principle called \"coordinative resonance.\" To explain this principle, one could take as an example that of two tuning forks set to an absolute value: the moment one is stimulated, the other resounds. He thought, therefore, that with the stimulation of an electronic frequency able to pass through the tissues of the body, it was possible to devitalize a bacterium, without damaging in any way the organs or the cells invested, which instead have much higher resonance frequencies. Rife described how he managed to find all the frequencies capable of killing the various microor ganisms. As a crystal glass breaks if invested by its resonance frequency , in the same way the pathogens can be devitalized once their specific frequency has been identified. So these electromagnetic waves, showed to possess the property of devitalizing or \"killing\" the microor ganisms if invested by the exact resonance frequency (dif ferent for each or ganism). T o discover the exact frequency of a pathogen, Rife with infinite patience observed the reactions under the microscope, varying from"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"time to time the frequency of his equipment, until he found the desired effects. Rife called the precise frequency able to kill a microor ganism, MOR (Mortal Oscillatory Rate). In 1922, Rife began to study a way to identify and destroy the viruses that caused cancer . His research on cancer took him ten years later , in 1932, to isolate the responsible pathogen that he called simply the BX virus. In opposition to established medical theories, Rife in 1953 af firmed, that: \"This BX virus can easily turn into different forms during its life cycle according to the environment in which it grew up.\" Thus, its characteristic is pleomorphism (passage to dif ferent forms), causing dif ferent diseases depending on the stage of its development in the or ganism. Another notable discovery was the PH-factor (acid-basic equilibrium). Rife declared that with a neutral PH, he could not produce any culture. On the contrary , with a basic or acid PH, it was able to produce a culture of microor ganisms. Therefore, on the basis of this information, Dr . Rife came to the conclusion that as long as the 10 The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"human body is able to maintain the PH of the dif ferent or ganic systems in the right and natural equilibrium, it becomes impossible for a disease to develop. After conducting thousands of experiments on infected cultures and animals, Rife was joined by some of the most prestigious doctors in the country , who financed him and used his equipment on men, with positive results. In 1931 two people provided the maximum professional support to Dr . Rife: Dr. Arthur I. Kendall, director"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"of medical research at the Northwestern University Medical School of Illinois and Dr . Milbank Johnson, member of the board of directors at Pasadena Hospital in California, very influential in Los Angeles medical circles. Dr . Kendall had invented a protein culture medium, which he called \"K- Medium,\" which allowed a bacterium to remain isolated and to continue reproducing. This became a very important support for Rife's experiments. Rife, Kendall and other scientists demonstrated that it was possible to grow bacteria artificially . The technical discovery that leads to cancer treatment was published in the journal Science in 1931. After the successes obtained by Rife and Kendall Dr. Milbank Johnson on November 20, 1931 or ganized a dinner in his Pasadena estate in honor of the two men, so that the discoveries could be announced and discussed. Forty-four of the most prominent doctors, pathologists and bacteriologists in Los Angeles took part in this historic event advertised as \" the end of all diseases. \" Among those present were Dr . Alvin G. Ford, who 20 years later claimed to know little about Rife and his findings and Dr. George Dock who worked at the University of California Special Research Committee of the South, first supervisor of clinical work, later among"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"opponents of Rife. In 1934, Dr . Johnson began the first successful trials at the Jolla Clinic in California, on a series of patients with cancer and tuberculosis. In this hospital the first clinical cancer work was started, established under a special committee of the Medical Research of the University of Southern California, under the supervision of Johnson himself. The trial involved 16 terminal cancer patients. After 3 months, 14 of these desperate cases were declared as clinically healed by the staf f of five doctors (Dr . Alvin G. Ford was the pathologist of the group), after another 130 days, following a change introduced in the treatment, even the last two patients healed. The treatments consisted in the application of electromagnetic waves for duration of 180 seconds, using a Rife Ray 3 set on the deadly frequency for cancer \"BX,\" at intervals of 3 days. It was found that this time spent between two treatments, led to better results than the cases treated daily. In this way, the lymphatic system was given the opportunity to absorb and eliminate the toxic residues produced by dead microbes. The application of electromagnetic waves did not cause the body temperature to rise, nor were special diets given during the entire clinical treatment. The results of this study showed that the cancer was caused by microor ganisms and that such pathogens"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"could be painlessly destroyed and finally that this disease could be cured. In the years following the clinical success of 1934, the technology and curative treatment of cancer patients with Rife Ray , were discussed in medical conferences and data released in a medical journal. The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition 11 In 1935, Dr . Johnson continued trials with a new machine installed at the Santa Fe Hospital in Los Angeles. In 1936, Johnson realized that Rife needed a new workshop to continue his work and, thanks to the help of some"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"friends, he found the funds for the construction of a new and comfortable structure. In October -November of the same year , Dr. Johnson began using a Ray Machine in the Pasadena Home for the Aged clinic, reporting that he achieved excellent results. Unfortunately , Dr. Johnson, a suf ferer of heart, died in October 1944, while he was preparing a press release on the successes obtained with these machines. In an article dated May 6, 1938 in the Evening Tribune, Rife, through a reporter , reported that he had experienced electrical stimulation on various microor ganisms and he had noticed the individual differences in the chemical constituents of the diseased organisms and had observed the specifications of the electrical characteristics and the polarities in the organisms. In 1939, his device was declared illegal and most of the 44 doctors who had acclaimed him eight years"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"earlier , denied ever having met him. Some incidents such as the destruction of his laboratory , the killing of some people close to him and the destruction of all the documentation in their possession convinced Rife to put an end to his research. Rife with his machines, successfully treated hundreds of patients who were diagnosed with incurable cancer and he received 14 awards and an honorary doctorate from the University of Heidelber g. All this occurred without the use of poisonous medicines, invasive surgery, high medical costs and without the dependence on doctors. 12 The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition Spooky2 The Spooky2 journey started in March 2011 when an experienced Rife user and experimenter Johann Stegmann experienced something that changed the course of his life. After buying a new Rife machine, Johann's friend made the astounding claim that the DNA contained in fingernails or hair could transmit ener gy frequencies directly to the owner of that DNA, simply by placing the samples between the machine's electrodes - without applying the usual contacts to the skin of the person. Johann"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"was skeptical, but together with his friend decided to test this theory on his daughter , Tania, who is particularly sensitive to ener gy. To his astonishment, he discovered that it worked perfectly . How do you explain this phenomenon? Albert Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance.\" Modern physics calls it \"quantum entanglement.\" Simply put, it means that if any part of a single system is removed from that system to a dif ferent location, any action performed on any part of the system, will also be instantaneously performed on the parent system, and vice versa. In this case, the parent system is the body from which the DNA sample is taken. W ith the exception of mature red blood cells, all human cells contain DNA, which is absolutely unique to a single person. So when the energy of the frequencies is transmitted to a small sample containing DNA (like a piece of fingernail), the ef fects will be instantly transmitted to the entire living or ganism from which the sample was taken. Over the following 18 months, Johann continued to experiment and discovered a way to monitor and verify the effects of the frequencies remotely . In every case, his experiments worked perfectly . In the course of his work, Johann discovered that many people couldn't afford to buy their own Rife"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"machines since the costs were prohibitive. So he started to seek out alternative devices. He joined forces with technical designer Hank Gigandet. Together they tested many different instruments. They discovered that the energy transmitted by many of the devices were harsh, unpleasant and ineffective. However , they also found some that emitted soft, pleasant ener gy that not only made the test subjects feel good, but worked just as well as the best commercial Rife machines. The device they decided on was the UDB1 108S DDS frequency generator . These were pretty inexpensive, but the software to run them was written in Chinese and not really suitable for the specialized job of rifing. So Johann and Hank commissioned their own software called RideUSB that would do what they wanted. It had one limitation, however - it could only run one generator per computer . Engineer and software developer John White had been following these developments with increasing interest and excitement. After discussions with Johann and Hank, John decided he would write a new software package that would not only embrace the functionality of RideUSB, but would also allow up to 126 frequency generators to be run by a single PC. That software was the original Spooky . Designed primarily as a remote Rife system, it could also be used as"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"a simple contact or plasma device when coupled with an amplifier . Very quickly , this system attracted an international Team of electronic engineers, technicians, designers, software developers and Rife professionals, whose intention was not profit or self-enrichment, but the worldwide spread of an af fordable system based on the Royal Rife technology . The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition 13 Today's technology allows the generation of frequencies up to 40MHz in a very modestly-priced unit. But the real power of a Rife Machine lies in the software, which creates the waveforms, durations, amplitudes, and other essential parameters. In May 2013, the Spooky team presented their first system, simply called Spooky . The software for this was completely free, while the hardware cost less than a nice evening out. After gaining useful experience with Spooky , the team developed a new system that includes a state of the art frequency generator , the Spooky2-5M and then the new GX, with software designed to allow the best use of all hardware capabilities. To complete or expand the Spooky2 system, you can add: Plasma T ube"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"This was the primary means used by Dr. Rife to devitalize pathogens. The tube acts as an antenna that combines photon emission with electromagnetic waves and frequencies from the generator . Keeping the tube close to the body and using the appropriate frequencies, you can devitalize pathogens responsible for very serious diseases. This plasma device is Spooky Central . It is the quickest, most powerful and effective way to destroy fungi, viruses and bacteria. Electrodes During the years when Royal Rife began working with John Crane, a method of applying frequencies was introduced, which was much simpler and cheaper than the plasma tube: skin electrodes. Using this method of transmission, electromagnetic ener gy is delivered through various types of electrodes: sur gical steel cylinders (or conductive rubber), metal plates or adhesive skin electrodes ( Spooky TENS Pads ). Remote T ransmission Spooky Remote is a device that arouses the greatest surprise in those who hear about it for the first time. So does it work? Well, because DNA has two strands helically coiled around one another , it acts as an antenna that's capable of transmitting and receiving information encoded on scalar ener gy signals via nonlocal"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"space. Spooky sends audio frequency energy to the nail. This energy is received by the DNA it contains, then relayed instantaneously via nonlocal space to the parent DNA. T oday's cell phones use antennas that are the exact same shape as DNA. The current Remote devices use the enormous power of scalar waves to make this form of remote transmission even more ef fective. W ith Spooky Remote, scalar wave, \"bubbles\" are formed right where the DNA is sitting. The waves are dif ficult to measure by orthodox means, as they act as a signal superchar ger both for the audio frequency energy and for the DNA's own transmission capabilities. The net effect is that the signal that reaches the body is clearer and more powerful. Nonlocal space has been referred to as \"dark\" energy (dark because it lies outside the electromagnetic spectrum and so can't be observed or measured). Nikola T esla called it \"the mind of God.\" Scalar W ave Technology The device just described, is not the only one to use Scalar Waves for treatments of any kind. The same Team of researchers that has developed the Remote that has devised an apparatus capable of producing scalar 14 The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"waves for treatments, which are able to give even more ef fective solutions, in case the problems are of a more complex nature. John White’ s idea was to design a machine that could combine the discoveries of the two greatest characters in recent history: Royal Raymond Rife and Nikola T esla. Thus a machine was born that can emit frequencies of care, with pure scalar fields. The system consists of two units, i.e., a transmitter and a receiver . Once the two units have been tuned, the person being treated must be between the transmitter and the receiver . The Spooky2 Scalar is the first scalar treatment device to provide three dif ferent methods of transmission of scalar waves: pure scalar , molecular scalar (in which it is possible to add the effect of a substance) and scalar Rife (making it possible to add a “program” of frequencies). This way you can choose the best treatment to perform for your needs. Complementary Accessories Completing the system are a Radionics apparatus ( Spooky Radionics ), a coil for a magnetotherapy applications ( Spooky Coil ), a biofeedback system to detect pathogens in the body (integrated into the new GX generator), a method for the production of Colloidal Silver and two Laser devices ( Spooky Cold Laser Twin and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Wrist ) for Laser -therapy applications, described in a chapter of this manual. Thanks to the continuous research and experimentation work of John White, we must always expect something new . Spooky2 is already the best Rife system in the world that is truly in a league of its own. The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition 15 Guide to Using this Manual First column , Subject It indicates the name or subject of the frequencies program. Except for a few special applications such as homeopathic remedies, minerals, vitamins, etc., it is almost always the name of a disease or pathogen. The colors of the words have the function of highlighting of special interest subjects, while the colored boxes group together items belonging to the same subject. The items that have subjects in common are repeated several times in different paragraphs or chapters. For example, the subject \"Serotonin\" (neuro transmitter which can also adjust the mood) is located both in the chapter Cells, Amino Acids, Enzymes, etc., that in the one dedicated to the Mind, in the section that includes the disorders related to depression."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Second column , Author Refers to the origin of the programs: Rife are the original frequencies of the Dr .

In the event that the search in both the book and on the software identifies more than one item, you must pay attention to the content of the corresponding Notes, the Author and the execution time of each frequency . You may also decide to: - Set up a program with multiple programs of frequencies (not to exceed 4-5 sets or a total running time of no more than 1.5 to 2 hours - for Remote Mode or Plasma Mode); - If programs are dif ferent from another , regarding one or more frequencies and the rest are identical, you might decide to choose the one that of fers more possibilities; - If two or more programs of frequencies have an identical subject, but Author and Frequencies are different, you could first try the program written by an Author considered more reliable (e.g., CAFL than KHZ); If you are unable to locate the issue in the book, proceed as follows: - Enter the first letters in the \"Search\" box of the software; - Read the results of research and, if you manage to locate the issue that is also in the Manual, compare the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"results to choose the most appropriate program. Database Update Scholars from all over the world continue to provide more and new frequencies and programs. The Spooky2 T eam has the most updates on these topics, so their database is constantly evolving. This should not be a problem for the owners of this Manual: with following the search and comparison criteria above, you can always get the best results. In addition, over the years, several other databases of great interest have been added to the software. The most important concern: - A series of frequency programs related to pathogens, with the initials DNA and BP (Base Pair). In practice, these are frequencies obtained from the genome of microor ganisms, able to devitalize them; - A group of over 9,000 programs in which the molecular weight (MW) of the same number of drugs, supplements, molecules, etc., has been converted into a frequency . These lar ge databases, not listed in this manual, represent a further ef fective means for any health problem, thanks above all to the commitment and intuition of the researcher Manuel Mallo. Similarly to this manual there are some Frequency Programs that are not available in the Spooky 2 software"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"database. However , the Spooky2 software allows you to create and save independently , any Program of frequencies you want to utilize by just using the Create Program command of the File Menu. The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition 17 In recent years the classic database of Spooky2 has been reduced to give space to the new databases mentioned above. Previously it was possible that there were several programs with identical frequency/frequencies (e.g., at 10 Hz that corresponded to the liver , pancreas, gallbladder , pain, migraine, etc.). Currently all programs that have identical frequencies, have been deleted (except for what was considered the most representative: e.g., liver ). All other programs are however mentioned in the Program Description notes ( Other uses: pancr eas, gallbladder , pain, migraine, etc. )."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Therefore, in cases like this, it is possible that when you perform the search for one program reported in this manual on the software, you will not obtain any apparent result. To overcome this problem, dif ferent methods can be used. - The first is to write the entry in the \" Search \" box of the Programs folder . If you do not find it in the list that appears, most likely this word is, as already mentioned, in the Program Description notes. So just use the program corresponding to that (or those) frequency and the problem is solved. Here is an example: assume you want to search for \"nervous system.\" \u0000 Write these two words in \"Search\" and you will not find any results. \u0000 In this book, in the frequency column, you will read \"nervous system\" corresponds to 10 Hz. \u0000 Scroll down the search list, in the software window , until you find 10 Hz and you will see that at this frequency , it corresponds to \"Liver .\" \u0000 By clicking on \"Liver\" you will find in the notes in the box Program Description : Other uses: pancreas, gallbladder , pain, migraine, ADD, alertness increase, nervous system, jet lag, circadian rhythm,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"hangover , relaxation / mood / sleep, nicotine withdrawal, self-healing and spiritual wisdom. \u0000 At this point just click twice on \"Liver\" to be able to use the desired program. Naturally the same method should be applied if the program includes more frequencies. 18 The frequencies of Rifing - III Edition"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"- Another method is to write the frequency (or the first two or three frequencies) shown in the \"Frequencies\" column of the book, in the \"Search\" box. Also in this case you have to scroll through the list of results until you find the same sequence of frequencies written on the book. Taking the example as above, if in the \"Search\" box 10 is right, we must scroll through the list of results until we find the frequency that interests us: In all cases where you cannot find an entry in the Spooky database or in cases of frequencies that certainly are not present ( NEW ), Spooky2 software allows you to create a frequency program without dif ficulty . To do this, just click on the File Menu, then on Create Program, to access the following mask: At this point in the Program Name, you will write the name you want to assign to the Program and in Frequencies the list of frequencies, each followed by a comma (e.g., 10,20,30,).

The nature of light is twofold: wave and particle; as wave is characterized by wavelength or frequency . The dif ferent wavelengths are interpreted by the brain as colors ranging from red with the longest wavelength (lower frequency) to violet of shorter wavelength (higher frequency). The photons, massless, are the elementary particles of light. The therapies that use light and the colors are varied, these are the most known: Heliotherapy: it is a very ancient natural circulation, which is based on exposure to sunlight for the treatment of various kinds of disorders including: dermatologic diseases, osteo-articular (activation of V itamin D), respiratory , hematologic, the system circulatory and mood disorders."},{"pageNumber":2118,"pageContent":"Light Therapy: sunlight stimulates the serotonin and, especially in the Nordic countries where the insolation is very limited, this therapy is frequently used. In the field of chronobiology it is to administer light that plays the best conditions of the entire solar spectrum, through specific lamps, at a specific time, with a few sessions of ten minutes a day . The light through the optic nerve, balance melatonin - serotonin and regulates circadian rhythms sleep - waking, improving mood, appetite and sleep quality . This therapy thus exploits the close connection between the retina and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (nucleus of the hypothalamus, where is located the biological clock of man) to reset the circadian rhythms that are out of phase in certain diseases, such as seasonal depression and the bipolar . This therapy has therefore been found useful for the treatment of depression, bulimia, sleep disorders and circadian rhythm, ADHD, dementia and altered sleep patterns, obsessive - compulsive disorder , headache not migraine and cluster headaches, premenstrual syndrome, Chronic Fatigue syndrome, abnormal sleep patterns to work with night-day shifts, jet lag. PhotodynamicTherapy (PDT) : or Photochemotherapy , is an innovative technique successfully used especially in the treatment of cutaneous af fections for the treatment of various pathological or aesthetic conditions, such as: removal acne, photodamage or injury due to skin aging, actinic or solar keratosis, the pre- cancerous lesions and lesions cancer (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma)."},{"pageNumber":2119,"pageContent":"The therapy is based on the irradiation of light at certain frequencies and the application of a photosensitizing substance in the form of cream or administered intravenously , which triggers an oxidative reaction only in causing pathological cells favoring the elimination and replacement with new cells. Phototherapy: is the use of light to cure a series of especially skin disorders (jaundice, psoriasis, etc.) And as a cosmetic treatment. The patient is exposed to specific light waves for a period of time. Chromotherapy: is an ancient therapeutic technique natural origin, which studies the meaning of the colors and exploit its therapeutic properties to balance the chakras, relieve psychosomatic disorders and bring the body (which is a set of body , mind and spirit) to a condition of well-being. Our body can absorb the colors in many ways (sun, lighting fixtures, clothes, food, etc.). The chromotherapy light irradiation is the most ef fective technique: the electromagnetic waves transmit an ener gy capable of getting deep into cells causing a series biological reactions, as better described hereinafter . Chromopunctur e : fruit of the brilliant idea of German researcher Peter Mandel (the early 70s), is a form of acupuncture that uses instead of needles, colored lights, which are directed on traditional acupuncture points to treat various diseases.

Biophoton : This is a sensational discovery of the German biophysicist Fritz Albert Popp , who was able to show that the cells of any living being, emit very weak light radiation; this light radiation is called biophotons. The emission of electromagnetic ener gy propagates at the speed of light by means of DNA, which acts as a transceiver station allowing a constant electromagnetic communication, both inter -cellular which with the outside world (also long- distance). Popp also discovered that healthy bodies emit very coherent bio-photon. While in poor health, bodies emit less coherent photons. The disease would be an interruption in the biophoton communication lines within the body due to parasites, viruses, fungi, pollutants etc. Furthermore, while investigating a particular light radiation with a wavelength equal to 380 nanometers, he discovered that it is associated with the repair of photo-phenomenon. If in fact a cell is damaged (and even almost totally destroyed) by the ultra violet light, it can repair itself alone in a matter of a day if it is exposed to a radiation of the same frequency but of much lower intensity .

LED and LASER Therapies The technology of laser light applied to the medical field saw its birth in the late '70s. In the years following the technique has evolved more and more. The use of this technology has expanded, including also LED light sources. The main dif ference between the two light sources consists mainly in the fact that while the laser emits a coherent light, ie with all the rays in phase, the LED diodes do not have this characteristic. Both, however , emit monochromatic or single colored light, that is, at a precise wavelength, from infrared to ultraviolet (in the visible range each frequency corresponds to a specific color and vice versa). In terms of frequencies, the visible spectrum varies between 400 and 1200 teraHertz which corresponds to a wave length ranging from 400 to 800 nm (nanometers) or a comparable size to that of human cells. In phototherapy and in many other therapeutic applications of monochromatic light, it appears that the dif ferences between the laser and the LED are not appreciable since coherent light is converted into incoherent light when passed through the body . In practice the therapeutic effect depends on the wavelength, the dose and the intensity and therefore little or not at all on the coherence. The absorption depends on the type of tissue that is irradiated and on the wavelength of the light. Light blue, green and yellow are almost completely"},{"pageNumber":2139,"pageContent":"absorbed by the skin surface. The red light is better transmitted than these and the infrared even better , being able to achieve a penetration depth of up to 10 mm. For therapeutic medical devices (mainly laser), the shades used are light blue, green, yellow , red and infrared, but especially the red/infrared light, between 630 and 900 nm, which are employed in most medical treatments. In this range of frequencies, the photons activate mainly the final vector of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (cytochrome-c-oxidase). Mitochondria are or ganelles present in all animal cells whose main function is that of cell respiration and production of A TP, a coenzyme that can provide power to all cellular reactions and the processes of the body including, for example, the transmission of nerve impulses and muscle contraction. Mitochondria occupy about 10-15 percent of the volume of a living cell. Therefore, the red monochromatic light with a wavelength from 630 to 660 nm acts by interfering with the mitochondrial respiratory chain of cells and more specifically on the enzymatic structures \"cytochrome oxidase\". This process results in an increased production of endogenous energy in the form of A TP (increase of 150%) that the cell will use to improve its functions. From the therapeutic point of view , this will manifest itself as an improvement of the functional activity of that tissue \"photo- stimulated\" and then in a rapid restoration of its integrity . From this knowledge derive many unexpected therapeutic applications. The flow of light penetrating the tissues causes the biochemical reactions that induce several ef fects among which are: - Vasodilation resulting in the increase in local heat, increase in cellular metabolic demands, neuro vegetative stimulation and modification of intra-capillary hydrostatic pressure (lowers blood pressure);"},{"pageNumber":2140,"pageContent":"- Increased lymphatic drainage and activation of microcirculation; - Anti-inflammatory , anti-edema and improvement of the nutritional state of tissues because of the increase in blood flow due to capillary and arteriolar vasodilation; - Significant acceleration of regenerative processes, acceleration of the healing of wounds, increase in the potential of the nerve cells and a greater production of collagen and elastin; - Increased production of endorphins and, consequently , treatment of acute and chronic pain; - Care of trauma , injury to the ligaments, tendons, bones, nerves, skin, dental problems and infections (including herpes). So the applications are used in neurology , dentistry , dermatology (including cosmetic applications), physical therapy and rehabilitation (including the sports field). The light can be applied to any part of the body: blood vessels, skin, soft tissues, muscles, bones, brain and with LED devices, also to the eyes. The correct position of the laser probes or those realized with a matrix of laser diodes or LEDs, it is important to avoid ener gy losses. Normally , the best position is perpendicular to the skin at the point of application and at a distance varying from 1-2 mm to a maximum of 1-5 cm. As already said, the light ener gy absorption primarily depends on the color of the light (or the wavelength of the beam) and on the constitution of the tissues that are invested by the radius (skin, blood, muscles, bones, etc.). The duration of the application depends on the ener gy (Joules / cm2) radiated by the probe as a function of the depth of the tissue to be treated and the type of the beam emission (continuous, pulsating, modulated). The light can be emitted continuously (e.g. to relieve pain), pulsating (e.g. to stimulate healing) or modulated frequency (e.g. for the application of Rife frequencies). Many authors consider the modulated laser light more ef fective in terms of therapeutic ef fects; some combine the continuous emission with frequency modulation by using the patient's reactions."},{"pageNumber":2141,"pageContent":"Finally , there is a wide range of studies (reflex therapy) that examines the effects of frequencies, with the stimulation of the points of acupuncture meridians, chakras, or trigger point (Dr .Nogier , Dr.Bahr, Dr.Reininger , etc. ).

The correct frequency modulation of the laser beam on a point of meridians or acupuncture, stimulates the oscillation of the frequency of the meridian.

Today the results of his work are recognized by the W orld Health Organization (WHO). The low frequencies are used for treatment. The high frequencies are used for laser devices (at a higher harmonic - n°128), with an identical action.
