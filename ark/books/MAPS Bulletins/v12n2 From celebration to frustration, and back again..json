MAPS’ major accomplish- ments at the end of last year led me to believe that our goal of developing psychedelics and marijuana into FDA-approved prescription medicines was moving from distant vision to realistic possibility. Yet immedi- ately after celebrating our achievements, new resistance blocked further progress and for a time our initial excitement was replaced by frustration. Now, after more than half a year of difficult, slow work, we’ve made significant progress overcoming some obstacles and have energetically responded to others. On November 2, 2001, after fifteen years of struggle, FDA approved a MAPS-funded MDMA psycho- therapy protocol, specifically Dr. Michael Mithoefer’s study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treat- ment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (p.4). By November 7, however, senior administrators at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), where we expected to conduct the study, reacted with alarm to the media attention generated by FDA’s approval of the protocol (see www.maps.org/media/). We tried for five months to address their fears and concerns, but were unable to obtain permission to submit the protocol for review to the MUSC’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). We then started negotiating with FDA to move the study to a new location. On June 14, FDA informed us that our request was approved. We’re now in the midst of an independent IRB review, and with luck will be able to begin the study in several months. We also experienced a roller coaster ride in our four-year effort to obtain a license to produce our own supply of FDA-approved marijuana, necessary in order to proceed in a professional manner with a medical marijuana research program. MAPS has partnered with Prof. Lyle Craker, UMass Amherst Dept. of Plant and Soil Sciences, and has pledged a grant to fund all production expenses (p. 3). On December 3, 2001, after reviewing our application for six months, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health informed me that it had no objections in principle to the UMass Amherst facility, as long as the Drug Enforcement Administra- tion (DEA) first approved the project. This major milestone moved the application to the federal level. Progress soon stalled. On December 5, DEA informed me that it had lost our application, which we had submitted six months before. We subsequently faxed a copy to DEA, waited over a month and then were told the application was rejected because it only had a photocopied signature (DEA had lost the application with the original signature). Realizing that we were in for a major struggle, we decided to seek outside support before resubmitting. These last six months have been focused on obtaining two supporting docu- ments; a letter to DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson from several Congressional Representatives endorsing the licensing of private facilities to produce marijuana for medical research (see back cover), and a legal analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union and Covington & Burling explaining why US international treaty obligations do not prevent DEA from licensing the facility. We anticipate filing our application in early July. In December 2001, as a result of a generous grant from a new donor, MAPS and CaNORML were able to start planning for a new round of marijuana vaporizer research. Our intent is to have a vaporizer approved by FDA for use in clinical trials, following the recommendation of the Institute of Medicine for the develop- ment of a non-smoking delivery device. Unfortunately, our search for vaporizers that had a reasonable chance of being approved by the FDA ended up taking longer than anticipated. We’ve recently chosen two promising models, the Volcano (www.vapormed.com), and the Vapir (www.air-2.com), and have finally started a new $35,000 marijuana vaporizer research project, with results to be reported in the next Bulletin. During these difficult times, I’ve been encouraged by the stories I’ve been reading to my kids, particu- larly about the tortoise and the hare. If anything characterizes MAPS’ track record, it’s slow and steady! With your continued support, I’m confident we can win the race, eventually. – Rick Doblin, Ph.D., MAPS President m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Edited by Rick Doblin, Maggie Hall and Brandy Doyle Layout/Design by Mercedes Paulino MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) is a membership-based organization working to assist psyche- delic researchers around the world design, obtain governmen- tal approval, fund, conduct and report on psychedelic research in humans.

One limitation on the conduct of this research is that the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has a monopoly on the supply of marijuana that can be used in FDA-approved research, and has refused to supply mari- juana to two MAPS-supported researchers with FDA-approved protocols. When it does agree to supply marijuana, NIDA sends marijuana of low potency with seeds and stems included. In order to evaluate fairly marijuana’s medi- cal potential, a better quality product is required with definite availability for any FDA-approved protocol. For the last several years, MAPS has partnered with Dr. Lyle Craker, UMass Amherst Dept. of Plant and Soil Sciences, in an effort to obtain permission from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to establish a licensed production facility to grow 25 pounds of high-potency marijuana. This marijuana would be for use exclusively in FDA and DEA-approved re- search protocols and would not be for patients approved under State but not Federal laws. On December 3, 2001, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) indicated that it had no objections in principle to Dr. Craker’s appli- cation to grow marijuana at UMass Amherst, but that DEA would need to issue a permit first. I then inquired of DEA about the status of our applica- tion, which had been submitted on June 25, 2001, the same day as the DPH application. Surprisingly, DEA informed us that the application had been lost. On December 21, 2001, the UMass Amherst Dept. of Grants and Con- tracts faxed me a copy of the application, which I then faxed to DEA. In early February 2002, DEA informed me that our faxed application was not acceptable since there was no original signature on it, only a photocopy. We decided to wait to submit yet another application to DEA until we had two additional documents. The first is a legal analysis of US interna- tional treaty obligations prepared by the American Civil Liberties Union Drug Policy Litigation Group and D.C. law firm Covington & Burling, which explains that DEA can indeed issue the license. The legal analysis will probably be completed before you read this. The second is a letter to DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson from several Congressional Representatives expressing support for privatized production facilities, which exist for all other Schedule 1 drugs except marijuana. The June 6, 2002 letter from five Massachusetts Representatives, whose signatures were gathered by the Mari- juana Policy Project, appears on the back cover. We anticipate refiling our application in July. Although our applica- tion is in harmony with the rhetoric of the Bush Administration, which favors scientific research as the means to resolve the medical marijuana issue, it's too early to tell how DEA will respond.

The IND requested permission to conduct a MAPS-sponsored study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I now have an update about our progress through the approval process since then, including some bumps in the road and at least two pieces of very good news. Once an application is formally submitted to the FDA they have thirty days to reply, so we knew we would hear something by the end of October. We also knew it was possible that this initial reply would be the beginning of a process of discussion and negotiation rather than a final decision. On October 29, Rick Doblin got a call from the FDA to tell us that members of the panel reviewing our application wanted to have a conference call in order to address some concerns about the protocol before they made a decision. On October 31, Rick and I had a teleconference with two doctors from the FDA Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products. We had a useful discussion during which we agreed to make some changes in the protocol. These changes are as follows: 1) We will measure blood pressure and pulse more frequently during the MDMA sessions and will have lower thresh- olds for instituting increased monitoring and considering treatment. 2) There will not be an opportunity for subjects who received placebo to be given “open label” MDMA sessions at the end of the study. Although we would have liked to have been able to include these open label sessions, we felt the FDA position on this was reasonable. Since this is the first Phase II study, we presently don’t have data to support an argument that an open label dose would be beneficial. 3) Subjects will not be able to take any psychiatric medications until after the final evaluation (two months after the second MDMA or placebo session), including medications they had taken before the study. An exception to this would be a “rescue medication” that I could prescribe if a subject were experiencing severe anxiety or insomnia. 4) Subjects who were in ongoing therapy prior to the study will be able to continue that therapy but will not be able to increase the length or fre- quency of the sessions and will not be able to start any new therapy during the study period."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 “There appears to be considerable resistance within the university to having this potentially controversial study take place there.” The FDA physicians also wanted to discuss the possibility of excluding subjects who had not previously taken MDMA. This had been a requirement in all the Phase I studies in this country. We argued successfully against adding that exclusion, because restricting inclusion only to people experienced with MDMA or ecstasy would unnecessarily skew and limit the pool of potential subjects. It was agreed that, as re- quested, we would be allowed to include “MDMA naive” subjects in our study. The following day. we faxed in a formal version of the changes we had discussed. On November 2 nd ,we got a call telling us our appli- cation had been approved and we could pro- ceed with the study. We were extremely grati- fied that the FDA had evaluated our protocol based on the scientific data and had responded accordingly. The process of negotiating with them about some of the details had been straightforward and productive. The next step was to submit an application to the institutional review board (IRB) at The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). In order to do so I needed the signatures of the Acting Chairman and one other full time faculty member from the Department of Psychiatry (I am on the clinical faculty, but not the full time faculty). Although we had elected not to sub- mit a formal application to the IRB until after obtaining FDA approval, I had spoken to a num- ber of people at the Medical University and had found considerable support for the study. Mark Wagner, PhD, a neuropsychologist in the Depart- ment of Neurology at MUSC, had agreed to par- ticipate as my co-investigator and to conduct the neuropsychiatric testing. Two senior pro- fessors of psychiatry had read the protocol and each said they would be willing to sign on as the study “sponsor” for the IRB. I had made an appointment to meet with the Acting Chairman of psychiatry to discuss the study and address any concerns he might have. On the morning of my scheduled meeting with the Chairman, the first media reports about our FDA approval appeared in the Wall Street Journal. As a result of this article and the addi- tional media attention that followed, I suddenly found myself confronted with a much more dif- ficult climate at the Medical University. I coop- erated with the University Press Office in their attempts to deescalate the media response, and hoped that in time my discussions with people at MUSC could get back to addressing matters of science and patient safety rather than media reports. Since November, I have been trying to bring our application before the IRB for a for- mal review of its merits, however I have not made significant progress in that direction. There appears to be considerable resistance within the university to having this potentially controversial study take place there. Although we remain hopeful that we will be able to do MDMA research at MUSC in the future, we de- cided in early March to move ahead with pursu- ing other options in the interest of avoiding further prolonged delays in this project. On March 14th, 2002 we submitted a for- mal request to the FDA to change the location of the study from the MUSC General Clinical Re- search Center to an outpatient setting outside the University. This request provided detailed descriptions of the ways we would handle any potential medical complications, and it included a proposal to have emergency drugs and equip- ment on hand and to hire an experienced ER nurse to be present in the adjoining room dur- ing the MDMA sessions. On May 10 th 2002, we got a phone call from the FDA informing us that a “clinical hold” had been placed on our study because of concerns relating to the provisions for handling medical emergencies outside the hospital. There was some concern about the details of treating hy-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 “If this process goes smoothly we should be in a position to start recruiting subjects in August or September.” pertensive emergencies in particular, and a more general concern that we would not have an emergency response team comparable to what exists in a hospital setting. Rick and I spent the weekend polling a number of practicing ER phy- sicians about our proposal and working out a response to the FDA’s concerns. The ER physi- cians we spoke to concurred with our approach to blood pressure monitoring during an- tihypertensive treat- ment, and Dr. Howard Kornfeld wrote a let- ter of support to the FDA. On May 13 th , we faxed them a re- sponse indicating that we understand and appreciate the issues raised concerning the safety of our subjects, and that we agree that, for this pilot study, we need to provide a level of emergency response in the office setting comparable to that which would be provided in the hospital. In keeping with that intent, we proposed to add some additional monitoring equipment, and to hire a currently practicing, board-certified, emergency physician as well as a currently practicing emergency de- partment nurse to be present in the adjoining room during at least the first five hours of each session. These two staff, along with the two co- therapists (me and my wife, Annie), would give us a team of two experienced emergency physi- cians and two registered nurses. This would al- low us to respond to a medical emergency at least as effectively in an office as in a hospital, and arguably more effectively. In addition, from a psychological standpoint, an office has the advantage of being quieter, more comfortable and more aesthetically appealing than a hospi- tal room. (From a financial standpoint, the ex- tra cost of these precautions would be approxi- mately $40,000, which is almost exactly what we would have had to pay MUSC in indirect costs, so they would not add to the overall cost of the study.) Rick and I had a conference call with the FDA team reviewing our request on May 14 th , and were gratified to find that they were very receptive to our revised proposal. They told us that before making a final decision, they wanted an opinion from their cardiology division. On June 11, we received a fax with several recom- mendations from the FDA Division of Cardiore- nal Drugs. These recommendations demanded some fine-tuning of what we had already agreed upon, but re- quired no major changes in our ap- proach. I felt that what they requested was reasonable and was unlikely to inter- fere with the therapeutic nature of the sessions. Later that day Rick informed the FDA that we would agree to these conditions, thus clearing the way for them to remove the clinical hold on our study. With the help of the rest of the original application team, Ilsa Jerome and Matthew Baggott, we've prepared an application to a pri- vate IRB. On June 14, we received clearance from the FDA to do the study outside the uni- versity. On June 19, we submitted the IRB ap- plication. If this process goes smoothly, we should be in a position to start recruiting sub- jects in August or September. It’s been a sometimes frustrating but al- ways interesting seven months. I’ve learned something about the intensity and the pitfalls of media attention. I’ve been not too surprised, but still very sorry to see the degree to which academic freedom in a university can be con- strained by prejudice and political pressure. I’ve been impressed and heartened by the integrity and professionalism of the FDA. And I’ve really enjoyed the experience of working with Rick and the other people at MAPS to respond to the chal- lenges that have presented themselves. Obvi- ously this project has momentum, and I’m en- joying the ride."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 “It is not an overstatement to say that the sessions I did with the MDMA, in the hands of a skillful analyst, saved my life.” I am a 41-year-old professional woman who has been struggling with a severe eating disorder (bulimia) for over twenty-five years. The eating disorder began to manifest at age nine, following sexual and aban- donment trauma. It is hard to de- scribe the extent to which my inner struggle with pain, self hatred, and feelings of purposelessness have robbed me of living for all of these years. I have been in therapy off and on since age nineteen, with little to no effect. Therapy was better than nothing... but only just. Prozac and similar drugs would elevate my mood initially, then induce a dulled effect that felt unreal. Prozac, Zoloft, etc. did not help the eating disorder. I remained incapable of loving myself or open- ing to others. My life was lost to black, con- tracted cycles of binging and purging. Healing requires some inner kernel of self love. I knew this intellectually (and was brought to this recognition by various therapists) but could not find that space inside myself. I at- tempted suicide twice during my adult years, the second time seriously.

After a year of work with him, he suggested use of MDMA in a contained, safe, retreat setting. Because of my upbringing and professional position, I had reservations about doing “drugs”. Finally, after a further desper- ate cycle with the bulimia, I asked to try it. I am so grateful, so thankful, that I took the risk. It is impossible to overstate how the work I did with this person using the MDMA profoundly changed my life. I was able for the first time to feel a space of love for myself. As my work with the analyst continued, I began to open more towards others and could tolerate work in a group setting (I had difficulty toler- ating group work prior to the MDMA). In all, I did roughly six sessions using the substance over a two year period. I still struggle with the eating disorder, but I have a sense of hope that was completely absent prior to the MDMA sessions. Through meditation, I am now capable of finding the self love that is so crucial for healing. It is not an overstatement to say that the sessions I did with the MDMA, in the hands of a skillful ana- lyst, saved my life. Tragically, the courageous individual who so helped me paid a high price for his work. He was forced to relinquish his license (not in con- nection with his work with me) and has since left the country. I am frustrated and heartbro- ken that the work that made my “opening” pos- sible cannot be available to others. I think that MDMA is a life-saving thera- peutic tool for people such as myself, who are caught in addiction patterns that attempt to replicate nurturing and feeding of the self. Many addicts are simply incapable of self love. MDMA allows one to find this space inside the self. I found that it allowed me to release the defenses and barriers that blocked me from connecting with and loving myself and others. I do think, however, that use of MDMA must be careful and coupled with skillful analysis. It would be easy to abuse this substance in the wrong hands. In my case, it was helpful to pre- pare for the sessions with disciplined ritual work. It was important for me to view the substance as sacred and not for recreational abuse. The analyst required that I commit to a full weekend of ritual work to prepare for the work with the MDMA. A typical schedule, for example, would be a Friday evening at the “re- treat” location of meditation, quiet dinner and a discussion of intentions and issues for focus during the work. On Saturday morning, we would continue with a morning of silence/meditation and prayer, break with a midday lunch, ritual work such as prayer flags, meditative walks, and collecting flowers or things from nature to deco- rate the “altar”. We would begin the work at dusk with an intention circle. After the first two sessions, I worked in"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 small groups (two to four other people). The therapist did not use the MDMA, but worked with me as a guide through the issues I needed to explore. Other techniques used by the therapist included drumming, breath work (during the MDMA session to deepen the experience and reach blocked areas), and body work, including traction and Trager method massage (profoundly moving and extremely helpful in my case). On Sunday morning following the work, we journaled and discussed the experience. In ad- dition, careful music choices were an important part of the experience (ex- pansive, organic sound- scapes). The analyst came to grief when a former pa- tient discussed the work with a new therapist, who either reported or per- suaded the patient to re- port the work to an oversight entity of some kind. I had worked with the patient in group, and observed that the patient was somewhat infatuated with the analyst. Amateur specula- tion here, but I suspect that she projected quite a bit onto the analyst (I saw that happening) and subsequently “punished” him for not return- ing her affection. Other than the obvious, limitations of the work include expense (weekend is a big time commitment for a therapist) and setting. To be as effective as possible, the work really requires a retreat location that is suited to deep, medi- tative inner work. It was my sense that the ana- lyst has to be careful to ensure the serious na- ture of the work, and not to let patients pres- sure him/her into overuse, or to relax the ritual and sacred character of the work. I wish to add that perhaps the single most important aspect of the work with the MDMA is that I opened sufficiently to let myself be held and receive nourishment from an archetype of the “Mother”, i.e., a woman who understood the process and acted as an assistant during several of the sessions. She was available to literally just hold me (if I wanted holding at any point) during the sessions. The holding was very safe; it did not have either a “hungry mother”, a sexual, or a forced, absent quality to it (three very different but damaging things to kids). I would not have been able to tolerate the hold- ing without the MDMA, yet it was the single most important element moving me towards healing. I sobbed for many, many hours. The irony is that people who grow up with emotionally absent mothers/trauma issues desperately crave to be filled by the “Mother”, but cannot tolerate or have difficulty allowing themselves to receive love from others. The experi- ence demonstrated very clearly to me the rela- tionship between my addictions and hunger for the Mother. During the sessions, I was able to see and (in wonderment) release my “defendedness”. The MDMA allowed me to actu- ally feel and go into the grief/loss. It also allowed me to receive healing Mother energy, which in turn made it possible for me to find self-love. This is so important to overcoming certain traumas. It is very important to keep any “holding” work safe and non-sexual. It is also important for the patient to understand the potential for transference, etc. With regard to the patient who reported my analyst, I wonder if he may have started her in the MDMA work too soon, before fully discussing and working through these kinds of issues with her during regular therapy sessions. It’s really a darn shame. “The experience demonstrated very clearly to me the relationship between my addictions and hunger for the Mother.”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 MDMA: A Soothing Balm For A Survivor of Sexual Assault Lisa “If we want meaning in our lives, we can find it in the depth of our questions, the depth of our answers and the necessity to care for one another.” – Carl Sagan (to contact author, email: info@maps.org) MDMA can soothe the pain and terror that still gnaws at a person’s core for years...even decades...after sexual assault. One dose in the right setting improved the rest of my life in profound and subtle ways. I don’t sit with my arms and legs folded tightly as a signal to stay away nearly as much as I used to. I am in love with a man I trust. And my nightmares have finally changed. For over twenty years, the dream scenario was almost always the same. I would frantically struggle with numb fingers to lock multiple locks on one side of a door as my attacker on the other side was unlocking them with superhuman speed. Since I took MDMA with the intention of receiving its therapeutic benefit, I no longer wake up feebly gasping the word, “help,” aloud even though it feels as if I’m screaming my brains out with no hope of anyone arriving in time to save me. Although I had good results with conventional therapy and a short-course of prescription antidepressants, part of me was not fully restored. I’d read accounts of how LSD had been used in therapy before it became illegal, and I’d wondered at times if it might unlock the cogs in my soul that were jammed. The poten- tial of hallucinating—without a firm grasp on reality—that I was again in the presence of the babysitter who molested me when I was seven or the guy who raped me when I was eighteen was too threatening. I just knew I was a bad acid trip waiting to happen, so I turned down a few opportuni- ties to try it when I was younger. Taking MDMA, commonly known as Ecstasy, was my way of securing the help that didn’t arrive when I was little or overpowered. And it worked. For me, Ecstasy was sanctuary—a few hours in the safest place I’d ever been. I had heard a few anecdotal accounts from acquaintances about what the experience was like for them. Like most people probably do at first, I assumed it was a feel-good party drug—a less sinister cousin to cocaine. Something too risky and illegal for me to even consider. I was well into my “One dose in the right setting im- proved the rest of my life in profound and subtle ways.”"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 professional life before I learned that dozens of therapists used MDMA successfully as a supple- ment to therapy in the 70s and 80s for a wide range of clinical applications. So, at the age of thirty-six, after not even being in the same room with any drugs since grad school, I set out to self-treat myself in the best situation available at the time. I wanted so badly to turn the whole evening into an “all about me” therapy session. I had fantasies about the kind of experience I’ve since heard referred to as the “sacramental use of empathic substances.” Something very new-agey and ritualistic. But considering that others in the group had never tried it before and those who had didn’t want to spend the evening get- ting in touch with my feelings (even though they’re all very decent people and supportive friends), I decided it would be far too selfish and actually rude to demand special attention. As unique as the evening seemed at the time, this next part will sound like a bit of a cliché. We took a cab to an underground club. It was my first and only rave. It wasn’t a huge gathering in the desert or in a derelict ware- house. It was just a big basement downtown packed with kids and an enormous sound sys- tem. I had only agreed to go after we made a plan to leave early enough to spend time just talking and listening to music back at home. I knew I’d be half a generation older than most of the other people at the club. So, I wasted a ridiculous amount of time worrying about things like whether or not I’d stick out because I was wearing the wrong shoes. A friend who knew this scene assured me that no one there could care less about my footwear. I had no idea how right she was. I was starting to feel really out of place and somewhat threatened when we descended the first set of stairs to a table where a young girl and a bouncer-type were selling tickets. It was the familiar feeling of losing access to all the exits—of being profoundly trapped. I paid my fifteen bucks, and as she reached out to stamp my hand, the girl gazed up at me and airily sighed, “She’s beautiful.” Her comment was so welcoming. Of course, I suspected it was drug inspired, but nevertheless my self-consciousness began to diminish from that point on. I had a comforting feeling that the people here wouldn’t judge me harshly. After watching the dance floor for a few minutes, we noticed about seven people huddled together in a conspicuous group hug. I turned to my friends and said smugly, “No way in hell that’s going to be us.” Little did I know. I noticed that an organization dedicated to promoting safety in clubs was on duty here making sure water, cooled rooms, and educa- tional literature was available. Feeling reason- ably well-protected by my friends, I went ahead and swallowed one pill from a batch that we brought with us that checked out as okay on an Internet rating site and had passed a chemical screening test. And then I waited... I’m not going to try to describe the sensa- tions of the high. There are lots of other sources for first-hand accounts of what MDMA feels like—especially on the Internet. Some accounts focus on the physical experience while others try to convey the emotional or spiritual signifi- cance they discover. Beyond the high, there are three ways in which the drug helped me cast off some of the lingering trauma I’d been suffering for years. The first new awareness that came to me was social. I noticed a stark contrast between this club scene and the one I knew from my youth. When I went out dancing in high school and college, everyone dressed to “MDMA can create a safe way to confront deep fears with a lasting benefit that extends beyond the high.”"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 impress...usually all in black. We wore pouty scowls, acted coolly indifferent, and danced with self-conscious awareness about whether or not we were “doing it right.” And there was an ever- present “meat market” vibe. With MDMA, the conquest mentality gets replaced with a desire to connect on a much more friendly and dignified level. It was inde- scribably healing to be in a male-dominated crowd and never once have the sensation that I was being ogled, stalked, chatted up, or hit on. And it wasn’t because of my age, either. The male attention I received was gentle and appre- ciative. Periodically, I’d be treated to a fantastical light show when a young man with glow sticks would politely approach me and wait for an in- dication that I would enjoy such a treat. After about one minute of watching whizzing, glow- ing lights all around my field of vision with rap- ture, we’d exchange an appreciative smile, and then he’d move on to share the great sensation. I believe that only a percentage, probably not even the majority, of people at the club that night were on MDMA. But I think that enough of them have experienced its effects in a meaningful way that propagates a lasting re- spect for others who are there to enjoy the mu- sic, the vibe, and each other...regardless of age, race, or gender. I’ve read about theories that suggest that soccer hooliganism in Britain de- clined rapidly with the introduction of MDMA into the scene in England. For the same reasons that sworn enemies from rival soccer clubs be- came peaceful ravers together, I think the preva- lence of male violence against women could di- minish—at least in the short term— as an ef- fect of experiencing the self-love and empathy MDMA can provide. For this reason, I was greatly saddened when I did a Web search using the words “MDMA” and “Rape” and found only two articles related to the therapeutic benefits for rape victims. All the others either directly or indirectly lumped MDMA into the Date Rape Drug category, giving what I believe is a false impression that sexual predators use it to subdue victims. For many, sexual function is not possible under its influ- ence. In normal circumstances, the mind remains quite lucid and blackouts don’t occur. There may be threats—especially to very young women— that I’m simply not aware of. However, I haven’t come across any studies that take a serious look at whether MDMA contributes to increased vio- lence against women or if this drug can actually help diminish it. My second point underscores the validity of the view that MDMA does not impair rational thought. It is not a hallucinogenic drug. And further, it can create a safe way to confront deep fears with a lasting benefit that extends be- “I wasn’t sexual, but I recovered an ability to be extremely intimate and express just what I was thinking....the best sensation was feeling no fear.” Pablo Amaringo Spirits of Stones and Metals"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 yond the high. And here’s how I know: The other woman in our group had done Ecstasy before, so she was an effective guide who could gently enhance the experience for those of us who were new to it. At the begin- ning of the peak, she simply ran the tips of her fingers down the front of my forearm as an en- tirely non-erotic invitation to come out and play. It was her clever way of saying, “See what in- tense pleasure you’re capable of feeling now?” After being locked away in my head, after float- ing somewhat disembodied without the sensa- tion of feeling my feet on the ground, without ever really feeling sexy due to sexual assault, I was suddenly free. I started to dance like a belly-dancer and a goddess, like a teenager and whole mature woman all at once. I had been dancing with my eyes closed, with pleasure and enough abandon to draw attention when I sud- denly felt a hand on my shoulder and stopped. I opened my eyes to see a man’s face inches from mine, and he was shout- ing at me to be heard above the loud music. He could have been the stranger in my nightmares. He had thick furrowed eyebrows, squinty eyes, and a hard set to his jaw. He held one arm behind his back. “Does he have a weapon back there?” I thought. “Is he poised to flash his badge and haul me off to jail?” He continued shouting until I could hear him say, “What are you on?” It’s very hard to lie under the influ- ence of MDMA, and I’ve always been too polite for my own good, so I replied, “No, thank you.” Again, he yelled, “What are you on? E? Acid? Alcohol?” I was afraid of being arrested, so again, I said, “No. Thank you.” Finally, he revealed that he was holding water behind his back, and then I understood that he was probably a volunteer or someone affiliated with the club trying to prevent dehydration. But could I trust that his bottle wasn’t spiked with something dangerous? Knowing I could get water from my friends, I said, “No. Thank you. I’m fine,” just as my friend approached. She’d been accosted by him too and got the same creepy feeling I did. She comforted me and led me back to the rest of our group. This was the hallucination I had feared when I considered taking LSD, only this was real. I was alone in a situation that should have horrified me, but I stayed calm and when I returned to my group of friends, something very unexpected happened as a result of this encounter. By sud- denly being put back into a threatening situa- tion with overtones of the abuse I’d suffered in my youth, I got another chance to ask for heal- ing, loving help. I felt vulnerable, but my ra- tional mind was guiding me the entire time. The third benefit was a sort of temporal cocoon that let me de- termine the personal gain I’d receive from this form of self- therapy. MDMA gave me a second opportunity to metamorphosize in a way. When I got back to the group, we were all experiencing intense sensations, including the common urge to babble. I wanted everybody to stop, be still, and hug me. And I wanted to hug them too and express kind thoughts. I wanted them to listen to me and speak to me in soothing voices. But everyone had impressions and observations to share, and I didn’t want to cause a scene. It felt somewhat similar to not being able to yell out in my nightmares, but without any fear present. It was so loud in the club that we ended up breaking up in little groups of two or three. Even though we drew our faces near to each other in order to be heard over the music, we still had to shout a little. I gradually became aware that I was using a voice that was familiar “My preference would have been to be with my therapist in a safe setting with loved ones who were committed to promoting healing.”"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 and yet unlike my natural speaking voice. It was the voice of a little girl. The seven- year-old me had showed up unexpectedly. The little girl’s voice just came out without inten- tion on my part. She was going to speak even if I wasn’t. My friends didn’t know it, but they were babysitting me for a while there. For a couple of hours, I had a strong sen- sation of being little again. I was curious, sweet, precocious, and imaginative. It felt good to be in my body, and I assumed a child’s posture and gestures. I wasn’t self-conscious at all. I wasn’t sexual, but I recovered an ability to be extremely intimate and express just what I was thinking. I was excited and impulsive and con- fident. I was open to making new friends just because they were people I liked...just like when I was seven. But the best sensation was feeling no fear. The MDMA sensations wore off slowly and gently, and it had a lingering pleasant effect all weekend. But beyond that, my nightmares stopped and then changed. I had the first one a couple of weeks ago. This time, instead of cowering and screaming behind the unlocking door, I grabbed a tool...a hammer...to fight back. I woke up before I attacked my attacker, but with the sensation that I would bash his head in if I had to. Why did I have to break the law to receive this healing? Why did I have to take such risks? My preference would have been to be with my therapist in a safe setting with loved ones who were committed to promoting healing. I would “We can’t know what relief or rehabilitation this drug could offer to schizophrenics, psychotics, rape victims, addicts, gang members, those in chronic pain from disease, grief, or other trauma if scientists and research institutions can not complete credible, unbiased investigations.” want a medical doctor present if rare complica- tions presented. I would want to know with the greatest degree of certainty that I was taking the dose appropriate for my physi- ology. I would want to extend the benefit by having follow-up sessions with my therapist to maximize the therapeutic effect. I don’t plan to take MDMA again, but I have continued to learn as much about it as I can since I made the hard decision to break the law in order to heal myself. Despite all my personal research, I still do not understand why there’s been no responsible, FDA-approved clinical test- ing of MDMA in this country since 1985. The argument that it has no medical purpose is a falsehood. It simply isn’t true. We haven’t taken the steps we need to in order to secure its tre- mendous social and personal humanitarian and pharmacological benefits. We can’t know what relief or rehabilitation this drug could offer to schizophrenics, psychotics, rape victims, addicts, gang members, those in chronic pain from disease, grief, or other trauma if scientists and research institutions can not complete credible, unbiased investigations. We will all find more meaning in our lives when we are finally brave enough to push be- yond our timidity and ignorance...when we choose caring for one another as our highest priority. “Why did I have to break the law to receive this healing?

Francisco Moreno and Chris Wiegand “The MAPS website has been a major source of referral for us, so we encourage the readership to consider promoting study participation for appropriate subjects.” Francisco A. Moreno, M.D. (fmoreno@email.arizona.edu) Approximately one year ago, we reported on the progress of our efforts to study psilocy- bin as a therapeutic agent in patients who suf- fer from obsessive-compul- sive disorder (OCD) and fail to respond to standard anti- obsessional treatment. (http://maps.org/news-let- ters/v11n1/11115mor.html) At that time we reviewed the rationale for this study as well as the series of steps undertaken in order to make this project a reality. We will take this opportunity to share with you our progress since that time. After a number of chal- lenges and delays, we have been able to obtain final Investigational New Drug (IND) approval for research with psilocybin from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with MAPS pay- ing for the synthesis of the psilocybin. We also obtained a certificate of confidentiality from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which is a legal tool that allows us to collect information from potential subjects without an obligation to report to any regulating bodies or criminal authorities, protecting in this manner the confidentiality of study participants. Since then we have been able to obtain additional research support from organizations such as MAPS, who facilitated the training of staff, and the Heffter Research Institute which provided support for the costly inpatient stays required as part of this protocol. We then obtained a special license from the US DEA to prescribe and dispense psilocybin in the context of this research. Once all requirements were completed we obtained the approval of the University of Arizona Human Subjects Committee, to begin recruitment. Our team has enter- tained a large number of in- quiries, and approximately fifteen interested subjects have engaged in several as- pects of screening and con- senting. Out of the subjects that engage in formal screening we are hoping that about 20 to 30% will be eligible to participate in testing.

We have recently developed a contract with our hospital that will allow us to admit subjects overnight for obser- vation in the psychiatric unit as mandated by the FDA. Since testing is very time consuming and requires up to four day-long sessions each sepa- rated by about one week, we hope to continue testing subjects at a rate of one per month. In order to accomplish this we still need to work hard at recruiting patients who meet study en- try criteria. The MAPS website (http:// www.maps.org) has been a major source of re- ferral for us, so we encourage the readership to consider promoting study participation for ap- propriate subjects. Another challenge for our study has been the fact that a number of interested subjects live in distant parts of the country, making it difficult to travel and/or remain in Arizona for several weeks at a time. We hope that in the future we may be able to assist participants with some financial support to make their participa- tion possible. Our group remains very positive about this study, and we hope to be able to share with you exciting results when it is opportune. We are excited to announce that MAPS is launching the Rites of Passage project, aimed at sparking open and honest family dialogue on drugs, and helping families ex- plore ways that psychedelics and marijuana can be better integrated into their lives. We hope to offer an alternative to abstinence- only drug education and raise the possibility that families may benefit from acknowledg- ing the potential contributions of psychedelics in their lives. To do this, MAPS is gathering written contributions, either signed or anonymous, from families who have tried to create a safe and supportive context for psychedelic expe- riences, primarily for the passage into adult- hood, but also for the passage from life to death and other transformations and stages of growth in between. (To see several ac- counts that have already been posted, go to www.maps.org/ritesofpassage.html). We hope that the Rites of Passage project will allow people to share their experiences with oth- ers, discussing the risks, benefits, problems, and rewards of their choice. If you have a story about using psychedelics or marijuana with a member of your family, please share it! Accounts should be between one and five pages long. We would especially like to have accounts written by each family member present. If you or your family member would prefer to record your story, you can send us the tape and we’ll tran- scribe it. You may wish to include details about the preparation and setting you chose, as well as your intentions for the experience. Please also discuss your reflections afterwards. How has this impacted your life? What would you have done differently? What would you tell other families considering the same choice?

My parents had brought me to the doctor because I was having muscle twitches as well as recurrent disturbing thoughts. I couldn’t seem to stop thinking about various ways to harm myself or others, yet I knew that these images in my mind were not truly me. The doctor explained to me what OCD was, and gave me some Prozac. The Prozac was effective for about two years, at which point it stopped working, and I was given a variety of other anti-depressants, as I had developed de- pression as well. Every medication I tried would work for a while and then lose its effectiveness, and by the end of 2000, I was taking no less than four medications at once. Needless to say, I was not happy with this, and I felt that my doctor was making me into a pill junkie. I also began to experience side ef- fects, including an inability to ejaculate. In early 2001, I stopped all medications, and sure enough, the depression and OCD returned full force. After a few months, I gave the medicine another try, but the side effects were even worse this time and I quickly stopped it. I decided that I would simply have to learn how to live with my disorder. In October, 2001, a friend of mine came into possession of a large quantity of “Magic Mushrooms” (I assume they were Psilocybe Cubenisis , but I can’t be sure). For about 6-8 consecutive weeks, my friends and I tripped ev- ery Friday night. My usual dose was between 2 and 3.5g of dried mushrooms. I had used mush- rooms once or twice before, but this was my first time using them regularly, at high doses. My first few trips were absolutely amazing. Dazzling colors, and a general sense of happi- ness, with no significant hangover in the morn- ing. By my second month of weekly tripping, the mushrooms began to lose their magic. The visuals were not as intense, and I began to feel increasingly burnt out after the effects wore off. So, I figured that I had done too much of a good thing, and stopped using mushrooms around the beginning of Decem- ber. It was in early Novem- ber, after I had tripped on four consecutive Fridays, that I noticed that despite being stressed from school and a bit depressed due to a break up (factors that in the past had triggered my obsessive thoughts), I was not experiencing any symptoms of OCD. I did not attribute this to the use of mushrooms, and I was in- trigued as to why my disor- der had vanished. Since then, my symp- toms of OCD have not re- turned. I still experience short episodes of depression, but they are very mild and without the agitation that used to ac- company them in the past. I told my doctor that my symptoms of OCD had gone away, despite being off all medications, and he didn’t know what to make of that. I also told him about my use of mushrooms, and he simply called me an ‘idiot’ (this was the word he used) and told me that I was going to destroy my brain one of these days. I did not make the possible connection be- tween using mushrooms and the remission of the OCD until I visited the MAPS site last week and read about the study that was going on. That is when it all clicked in my brain, and I realized that I had inadvertently cured myself."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Holotropic Breathwork Offered to University of Arizona/Tucson Research Team Diane Haug, M.A., LPCC (dianeh@newmexico.com) “...holotropic breathwork does offer a valuable alternative or adjunct to substance-induced non-ordinary states of consciousness.” S ince 1986, I have been intimately involved with the work of Stanislav Grof, MD. Certified in Grof’s first US three-year training program (along with my friend, Rick Doblin!), I am a longtime practitioner of Holotropic Breathwork and have served as a senior staff member with Grof Transpersonal Training since 1991. Having worked in a training context for over a de- cade, one thing that interests me greatly is the applica- tion of Non-Ordinary States of Consciousness (NOSC) work in a wider variety of settings. In fact, I have always dreamed of one day being involved in the clinical application of psychedelic therapy. For that reason, I was delighted to receive a call from Rick Doblin in October 2001 asking me to be involved in offering holotropic breathwork to the University of Arizona/Tucson research team. As many of you know, the University of Arizona/Tucson won FDA approval in July 2001 for a psilocybin/obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) study led by Francisco Moreno, MD (see this issue for update on the OCD study). With both logistical and financial support from MAPS, Stanislav Grof offered a series of talks and a Grand Rounds lecture at the University of Arizona/Tucson in October 2001. In attendance was the psilocybin/OCD research team. Grof discussed how to conduct psychedelic psychotherapy research and helped the team prepare for their treatment sessions. In addition to issues related to ‘set and setting’, Grof stressed the importance of researchers being committed to their own NOSC work in preparation for working with others. Although there are some major differences between holotropic breathwork and psychedelic sessions, holotropic breathwork does offer a valuable alternative or adjunct to substance- induced non-ordinary states of consciousness. Over the years I have heard many people greatly experienced with psychedelics report that their breathwork sessions rivaled any psychedelic ses- sion they had experienced in terms of depth, intensity, relevance, etc. Because holotropic breathwork sessions are of shorter duration, typi- cally easier to manage, legal, and accessible to a larger number of people, holotropic breathwork is a viable and powerful tool for mobilizing the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 unconscious and introducing people to the in- credible realms of the human psyche. In January, 2002, a colleague (Scotty Johnson of Tucson) and I offered a holotropic breathwork weekend workshop to the Univer- sity of Arizona team. The weekend was orga- nized by Chris Wiegand, MD, psychiatric resi- dent and coordinator of the study. Also in at- tendance was Jean McCreedy, a trained volun- teer ‘sitter’ with the project. Unfortunately, Fran- cisco Moreno was not able to attend. While the Friday night session (introduction/orientation/ preparation) was held at the University of Ari- zona Medical Center, we were blessed with a beautiful retreat setting (thanks to Friends of Tibet/Tucson) for our experiential work on Sat- urday. That day involved two breathwork ses- sions (one in which a participant was the ‘breather’; the other in which he/she was a ‘sit- ter’), and a group process in the evening. Since few people on the research team have had much personal experience in deep non-or- dinary states of consciousness or in conducting psychedelic sessions for others, the workshop was valuable in terms of introducing people to Grof’s theoretical framework, issues related to creating a safe and therapeutically sound ‘set and setting’, and offering participants an op- portunity to step outside their professional roles and responsibilities to spend a day in deep in- ner exploration/personal healing. While this one workshop seemed like a drop in a very large bucket in terms of the kind of training/preparation those involved in psyche- delic research would ideally be offered, it did feel as though we were on the right track. In- spired by the experience, I came home and ex- citedly projected a training model for profes- sionals involved in research or the clinical ap- plication of psychedelic therapy. Conceptualized as four long weekends spread over a year, the focus of the training would be both personal and professional. In addition to the ongoing use of holotropic breathwork for personal explora- tion/healing, participants would be offered a theoretical foundation including the history of psychedelic therapy, review of Grof’s cartogra- “...many people greatly experienced with psychedelics report that their breathwork sessions rivaled any psychedelic session they had experienced.” Diane Haug, M.A., LPCC is a psychotherapist living in rural northern New Mexico.

Most importantly, we are successfully progressing with our MAPS and Heffter-supported study of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of heroin addiction. The double-blind, placebo-controlled study compares multiple v single KPT sessions (more info at http:// www.maps.org/research/ketamine/ ketrussia.html). We have treated 59 subjects in the study to date and are beginning the third year of this five-year project. However, due to changing regulations regarding ketamine in Russia that went into effect recently, we cannot enroll more subjects until we implement new security procedures for the ketamine and obtain a new permit, though follow-up is continuing on subjects previously treated. It will probably take a few months before new patients can be treated.

Our results have been submitted for pub- lication to the Journal of Substance Abuse Treat- ment (see the abstract of our paper below). We Abstract of Paper Presented in Israel Krupitsky, E. et al. Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KPT) for heroin addiction: Immediate effects and two- year follow-up. In press, J. Substance Abuse Treatment . Seventy detoxified heroin addicts were randomly assigned to one of two groups receiving ketamine- assisted psychotherapy (KPT) involving two different doses of ketamine. There were 35 heroin addicts (27 male and 8 female) in the experimental group, and 35 heroin addicts (28 male and 7 female) in the control group. The patients of the experimental group received existentially oriented psychotherapy in combination with a hallucinogenic (“psychedelic”) dose of ketamine (2.0 mg/kg i.m.). The patients of the control group received the same psychotherapy combined with a very low, non-hallucinogenic (non-psychedelic), dose of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg i.m.). This low-dose induces some pharmacological effects without inducing a peak psychedelic experience. Both the psychotherapist and patient were blind to the dose of ketamine. Otherwise, all patients were treated alike and were given the same preparation. The KPT sessions, regardless of dose, also were similar. All patients’ psychological and clinical evaluations during the treatment and follow-up period were performed by a clinician evaluator other than the psychotherapist providing KPT. This rater was also blind to the dose of ketamine. KPT included preparation for the ketamine session, the ketamine session itself, and the post session psychotherapy aimed to help patients to integrate insights from their ketamine session into everyday life. During the ketamine session, the psychotherapist provided emotional support for the subject and carried out psychotherapy. Psychotherapy was existentially oriented, but also took into account the subject’s individual and personality problems. The results of this double-blind, randomized clinical trial of KPT for heroin addiction showed that high- dose (2.0 mg/kg) KPT elicits a full psychedelic experience in heroin addicts as assessed quantitatively by the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. On the other hand, low-dose KPT (0.2 mg/kg) elicits “sub-psychedelic” experiences similar to ketamine-facilitated guided imagery. High-dose KPT produced a significantly greater rate of absti- nence in heroin addicts within the first two years of follow-up than did low-dose KPT. High-dose KPT elicited a greater and longer-lasting reduction in craving for heroin (assessed with the Visual Analog Scale of Craving), as well as greater positive change in nonverbal unconscious emotional attitudes (assessed with the Color Test of Attitudes). Thus, the higher rate of abstinence in the high-dose group may be related to KPT’s effects on craving (similar to other NMDA receptor ligands) and modification of nonverbal unconscious emotional atti- tudes.

These results support the conclusion that high-dose ketamine-assisted psychotherapy may improve abstinence in heroin addicts through reduction in craving. However, it also appears that the acute psychedelic effects induced by psychedelic psychotherapy on the verbal level do not always lead to high rates of abstinence from drugs and alcohol. Further research should explicate how high-dose KPT improves relapse rates, and how to apply more optimally acute drug-induced psychological effects towards therapeutic ends."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 used a single high-dose ketamine-assisted psy- chotherapy session as the experimental condi- tion and a single low-dose ketamine-assisted psychotherapy session as an active placebo.

The study evaluated cognitive, behavioral, and etha- nol-like effects of the interactions between two neuronal calcium channel ligands (blockers) in abstinent alcoholic subjects: ketamine, which is a NMDA-coupled calcium channel blocker, and nimodipine, a dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel blocker.

According to Dr. Haven, “The nitrous oxide stimulates the pleasure receptors in the brain which leads to the replenish- ment of dopamine, a pleasure molecule. Although the effects in the brain last for three days, the feeling of being on nitrous stops shortly after the treatment is over and the patient is safe to drive home. This helps with a patient’s cravings and withdrawal symptoms in the first 72 hours, which can be crucial.” As part of a comprehensive program Dr. Kuhn tells patients that nitrous oxide is a three day cure for a serious three day prob- lem. The statistics indicate that the longer you can keep a person smoke-free the better the long-term odds will be. If patients remain smoke-free for a week, the chances are five times more likely that they will be so at six months. For those that can abstain for a month, 25% will be smoke-free for a year. Some patients use the treatment in conjunction with other methods of smoking cessation, such as hypnotherapy, acupuncture, or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Other patients just utilize the nitrous oxide, along with willpower. The patients are treated once on the day that they decide to quit with a twenty-minute application of nitrous oxide. If withdrawal symptoms persist, they can be retreated in 48-72 hours with another twenty-minute treat- ment. This helps patients overcome the physiological withdrawal from nicotine, which is a huge hurdle for smokers trying to quit the habit. A medical history is taken on each patient before they begin their treatment, and they are given a physical exam. They also re- ceive a lung evaluation with lung age and a carbon monoxide level as additional motivators. Drs. Haven and Kuhn have developed a computer program to evaluate each smoker and determine the best smoking cessation program for that individual.

Overall, Dr. Haven and his associates have found an 85% reduction in the number of ciga- rettes smoked per day in the three days after the patients took the nitrous oxide. Forty per- cent of patients were able to completely ab- stain from smoking during the first three-day period, and 92% said that their craving for to- bacco had “noticeably de- creased”. Haven reports that many of the patients who quit completely have remained cigarette-free for up to six months after the nitrous oxide treatment. He said that smokers who abstain for the first three days are more likely to quit for the long term than those who resume smoking within that first three day period. Dr. Kuhn reports that the spontaneous ‘quit rate’ without nitrous is about 2.5% annually. About 70% of persons who smoke want to quit and 40% try to do so annually. The average num- ber of attempts to quit before being successful is around eight tries. Of the people who have heart attacks, 70% go back to smoking, and of those who survive lung cancer surgery, 40% re- turn to smoking. On a positive note, 1.3 million people quit smoking in the US each year. The quit rates reported on nicotine replacement therapy and Zyban vary depending on the study, but an accepted value is about 18% quit rate at six months. More research is needed to discover what the success rate is for the people who have received nitrous oxide for smoking cessation. Dr. Haven said that nitrous oxide is an ex- tremely safe medication and it has the benefit of making what can be the worst day in an addict’s life into a somewhat more pleasurable experience. “If there is any therapy that helps a few more smokers quit, physicians should be recommending it to their patients. Smoking is proven to take years off of one’s life. The will to quit has to come from within, but anything that makes that mountain you have to climb a little less steep, is definitely a positive thing.” Drs. Haven and Kuhn continue to use ni- trous oxide as an aide for smoking cessation in their respective practices. They did research to- gether that was controlled but not double- blinded or compared to placebo. Initially they tried placebo-controlled research, but found that many of the patients had experience with ‘laughing gas’ from the dentist and could recognize the effects based on that experience. After the first few patients treated responded posi- tively, they decided to treat all patients and then compare to known rates with other agents and published “cold turkey” rates of success. Controlled studies would be helpful to evaluate this new treatment. Dr. Haven and Dr. Kuhn both feel that nitrous oxide is a needed addition to the medications already being used to help patients get the freedom that they want and to live longer and healthier lives. Both doc- tors would be open to conducting more research should the funds become available. Dr. Kuhn explains, “To provide funding for research and treatments that may help patients deal with the number one cause of preventable death in the United States is a worthwhile investment.” For more info, contact Dr. Jesse Haven (jhaven@swfla.rr.com), Dr. Allen Kuhn (akuhn@tampabay.rr.com). “...nitrous oxide is an extremely safe medication and it has the benefit of making what can be the worst day in an addict’s life into a somewhat more pleasurable experience.”"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Abstract Ancestral medical practices are based on a highly sophisticated practi- cal knowledge and view the controlled induction of non-ordinary states of consciousness as potentially beneficial, even in the treatment of the mod- ern phenomena of drug addiction. These ancestral practices stand in con- trast to the clumsiness with which Western peoples induce altered states of consciousness. Drawing from his clinical experience in the High Peruvian Amazonian forest, the author describes the therapeutic benefits of the wise use of medicinal plants, including non-ad- dictive psychoactive preparations, such as the well-known Ayahuasca tea. Within an institutional structure, a therapeutic system combining indigenous practices with contemporary psy- chotherapy yields highly encouraging results (positive in 2/3 of the patients). This invites us to reconsider conventional ap- proaches to drug addiction and the role of the individual’s spiri- tual journey in recovery. The Backwards Approach Moving beyond the strict position that the final objective of drug addiction therapy is complete abstinence, the Western world has responded to its failures and limitations by consider- ing the possibility of merely reducing risks. The notion of substitution, as in methadone therapy for heroin addiction, indicates a certain tolerance towards altered states of consciousness. In this model, which treats these states as “inevitable” in some sense, one would now be satisfied with lim- iting their negative secondary effects. In the face of a Puritanism resigned to an almost constant failure, this attitude opens new possibilities in treat- ing drug addiction. It now seems thinkable that drug addiction is an at- tempt, certainly clumsy and sometimes extremely dangerous, of self-medi- cation.

Some take this new tolerance of drug use further, for example by proposing to ravers that they learn about the drugs they consume, the risks that they run, and the best way to avoid the negative consequences of their conduct 3 . In this model, the drug user is considered a think- ing and consenting subject, who is invited to take responsibility for his actions. The “repres- sive machine” that tends to substitute it- self for the subject, making his decisions, revoking his responsi- bility, and, in the end, reinforcing an internal pattern of dependence, gives way to an approach which appeals to the user’s intelligence. This model accepts the au- thenticity of the user’s quest, even if it is often unconscious, for a true liberty that can be con- fused with caprice. While this attempt at finding meaning by exploring new realms of consciousness can be chaotic and confused outside of a controlled setting, it is reminiscent of more purposeful un- dertakings among traditional peoples. In fact, one finds the induction of altered states of con- sciousness for the purposes of initiation and therapy in all traditions. Such experiences, al- ways guided by a ritual frame, often depend upon a fine understanding of the animal and vegetable substances that serve as their catalysts. One may also affirm that, sometimes, the same sub- stances that serve as the “remedy” in indigenous cultures are the “poison” in Western society. Hence the coca leaf, which is well integrated into daily life in the Andean world, becomes a highly addictive cocaine-based paste when taken out of context. Similarly, cannabis, poppy, and tobacco may generate either remedy or poison according to the mode of consumption and the context of ingestion. It is noteworthy that biologists observe that all animal species consume natural psychoac- tive substances with great eagerness when pos- sible (Siegel, Ronald, 1990). In fact, Siegel con- siders this conduct a fourth instinctual instance of animal biology, as if life tends spontaneously towards a broadening of perceptions and a con- comitant amplification of consciousness. It be- comes difficult, then, to extract man from this vast biological move- ment that embraces all animal life. Indigenous Knowledge Our observations in the Peruvian Amazon yield a supplementary fact: not only do the natural psychoactive substances used by indigenous peoples not generate de- pendence, they are utilized to treat the modern phenomenon of drug addiction. This changes the way we understand toxicity; the Western obses- sion with “substances” (drugs) is replaced, or at least accompanied by, the concepts of the set (the subject, including genetic predisposi- tions, life history, and preparation) and setting (ritualized or not). Indeed, psychoactive sub- stances may be a treatment for “drug addicts,” a fact that still seems paradoxical or impossible even to the specialists in question. And yet, the facts speak for themselves. This phenomenon also works for ethnic groups strongly affected by substances such as alcohol, which represents for them, inversely, an imported product removed from its context. Hence, the healers of the Peruvian coast treat their alcoholics through the ritual use of the mescaline cactus with a high rate of success (around 60 per cent, after five years) (Chiappe, Mario, 1976). The Native North Americans re- duce the incidence of alcoholism on their reser- vations considerably and quite rapidly by reviv- ing their ancestral practices, including the ritual use of peyote and tobacco (Hodgson, Maggi, 1997). The ritualization of induced modifications ...often, the same substances that serve as the “remedy” in indigenous cultures are the “poison” in Western society. 3 Research-action-prevention, new drugs, new uses.

In indigenous groups, then, such ex- periences frequently accompany rites of passage, particularly at adolescence, per- mitting the youth’s appropriation of the discourse, images, and myths generated by the community. It is evident that the fun- damental lack of cul- tural consensus in our fragmented post-mod- ern society, along with the desacralization of the lived interior and exterior, and the disap- pearance of all authentic rites of passage, leaves us without the means to integrate experiences of altered states of consciousness into our daily lives. In other words, the drug user sets off ran- domly with neither compass nor map, often fin- ishing badly. These considerations lead to the following conclusion: not only must we no longer take a position of passive tolerance toward an inevi- table consumption of psychoactive substances, but, on the contrary, we must actively explore the coherent therapeutic use of psychoactive substances without the outcome of dependence. Even more broadly, we must be open to every induction of altered states of consciousness through diverse methods (such as music, dance, fasting, isolation, breathwork, physical exercise, pain, etc.) This calls for the application of thera- peutic techniques that create both a space of temporary containment and an authentic sym- bolic frame which, as in the indigenous ritual space, integrates therapists and users. Tradi- tional peoples also teach us that substances consumed in their natural form, used with re- spect to the body’s digestive natural barriers (that is, orally), do not induce dependence, in spite of their powerful psychoactive effects . The risk of toxicity is also lower because their ac- tive principles are similar, if not identical, to the neuromediators naturally secreted by our bodies. In case of overdose (which is generally difficult to produce given the extremely dis- agreeable flavor of the beverages), these sub- stances are eliminated naturally by vomiting. This self-regulating phe- nomenon provides for safe prescription and is an integral part of the expected effects of in- gestion, as well as those of purgation-detoxifica- tion (hence their special role in the domain of drug addictions). The con- text of ingestion requires rigorous dietary, pos- tural, and sexual regulations. In the course of successive ingestions, sensitivity increases in- stead of creating a habit. As a result, the doses gradually decrease: their use in addiction therapy is not, then, a simple substitution . It is remarkable that no visionary natural substance is addictive. Visions seem to be the proof of sufficient cortical integration, of a “...substances consumed in their natural form, used with respect to the body’s digestive natural barriers (that is, orally) do not induce dependence, in spite of their powerful psychoactive effects.” A ritual at Takiwasi"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 “These explorations touch cross-cultural psychological depths and, hence, may be applied in extremely broad and varied contexts of human life.” metabolization of the symbolic charge revealed during the experience of altered consciousness. Entheogenic substances (also misnamed hallu- cinogens) are hence among the best of those that may be used in a therapeutic setting. This has already been attempted in psychotherapy (LSD, MDMA, Harmaline, DMT, etc.), but gener- ally without an integrating symbolic framework (or ritual space), without engaging the thera- pist in the method, with synthetic or semi-syn- thetic substances or extracts, and through pro- cesses of assimilation that violate physiological barriers (i.e., injections). Ayahuasca This highly psychoactive ancestral bever- age is situated at the heart of both the empiri- cal medicinal practices of Amazonian cultures and, recently, of explorations into the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants, in particular in the domain of psychopathology, including drug addiction therapy. The pharmacological sophis- tication of this preparation reflects the high degree of understanding of the Amazonian peoples, who are proven to have discovered Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) at least three thousand years before Westerners. Tryptamines and beta-Carbolines, the major ac- tive principles of Ayahuasca, are present in many natural secretions as well as in the central ner- vous system (pineal gland) (Mabit, Campos, Arce, 1993). The entheogenic or visionary effects of this beverage have been hastily called “hallucino- genic,” stigmatizing a compound which could be a significant topic of research. Its potential as such risks being dismissed by the academic community due to a stance less indebted to sci- entific rationality than to society's collective fears. We have argued that the images stimu- lated by the use of Ayahuasca in a therapeutic context symbolically manifest the content of the unconscious. Moreover, these images are not without an object, whether it be psychological or otherwise, which differentiates them com- pletely from the “illusions without object” that are by definition “hallucinations” (Mabit, 1988). The exploration of the unconscious through Ayahuasca permits the rapid extraction of ex- tremely rich and highly coherent psychological material, which can then be worked through with various psychotherapeutic methods. Visions, like dreams, indicate the beginning of an integra- tion at the superior cortical level. The effects of Ayahuasca are not merely visual, but embrace the entire perceptual spec- trum, as well as the non-rational functions tied to the right brain and to the paleoencephal or so-called reptilian brain. The patient’s clinical experience fosters the development of not only the projective but also the integrative functions of symbolization, enabling the progressive re- adjustment of personality structures. These ex- plorations touch cross-cultural psychological depths and, hence, may be applied in extremely broad and varied contexts of human life. After the observation for fifteen years of more than eight thousand instances of Ayahuasca ingestion under specific conditions of prepara- tion, prescription, and therapeutic follow-up, we can affirm that the ingestion of these prepara- tions has a wide range of indications, with a total absence of dependence. The expansion of the perceptual spectrum, which simultaneously engages body, sensations, and thoughts, per- mits the de-focalization of the ordinary percep- tion of reality, thus allowing the subject to con- front his habitual problems on his own and from a new angle. The intense acceleration of cogni- tive processes which accompanies this process may permit the subject to conceive of original solutions that fit his unique personality and situation."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 The Takiwasi Center: A Pilot Project Our ignorance in regard to the controlled induction of altered states of consciousness could greatly benefit from ancestral medical knowledge. The master healers of various tradi- tions are ready to transmit their heritage to those willing to learn and to embark upon a path of initiation. Six years of teaching beside Amazo- nian healers has led us to develop a therapeutic method using the controlled modification of states of consciousness. Our system is based on ancestral techniques involving medicinal plants and natural methods of detoxification, sensory stimulation, and sensory deprivation. This pilot project attempts to combine ancestral knowl- edge with contemporary psychotherapeutic prac- tices, working under the guidelines of ethical considerations and the requirements of the West- ern mentality. The program, in which no method of coer- cion is exercised, accepts groups of no more than fifteen voluntary patients. The location is a five acre park bordered by a river, just outside the city of Tarapoto, in the Peruvian High Amazon, in the piedmont of the Andes (Mabit, Giove, Vega, 1996). The therapy is based on a three-part method which includes the use of the plants, psycho- therapy, and community life. The guided experi- ences of altered consciousness generate psycho- logical material which is subsequently discussed and evaluated in the psychotherapy workshops and then directed towards expression in com- munity life. In reverse, everyday activities supplement the therapeutic sessions (with or without plants). The initial use of purifying, sedative, and purgative plants reduces withdrawal syndromes, rendering any return to prescription medication during the stay unnecessary. Then, the psycho- active plants intervene, powerfully facilitating the psychotherapy. From the brief sessions to the eight day isolation in the forest with rigor- ous rules pertaining to food, sex, external con- tacts and daily activities, each ingestion of psy- choactive plants is governed by specific condi- tions. Each session is also facilitated by a trained therapist, and clearly inscribed into a precise and rigorous symbolic frame, which improves the chance of success for the session and its subse- quent integration into the subject’s life. These techniques permit the exploration of buried memories and the re-emergence of cen- sured situations or events. These “revelations” both relieve the addict’s conscience and moti- vate him to face his sickness. A temporary re- duction of critical functions and discriminations facilitates the cathartic expression of emotions. These experiences, with the help of psychothera- peutic work, may then correct the defective for- mation of the subject’s emotional expressions and ideals. By plunging under the veils of ordi- nary consciousness and unblocking the paths of access to the deep Ego, this exploration of the subject’s interior universe brings out rich mate- rial, in contrast to these patients’ often insuffi- cient symbolization. During the subsequent ses- sions, the subject will learn to translate and to interpret this material in order to explore sub- sequent dreams on his own. Dream life is stimu- lated by these practices, also benefiting the pa- tient. One also observes an acceleration of cog- nitive processes and an amplification of the at- tention-span and of the depth of mental con- centration. The clearly defined context, supplemented by a carefully regulated lifestyle, invites the resi- dent to implement the knowledge obtained by this work. Hence, the Takiwasi space constitutes a laboratory in which the residents are at once the observers and the subjects of their observa- tion. The medicinal plants play the central psy- chotherapeutic role, while caretakers offer guid- ance and security. The users are guided into limi- nal, or symbolically transitional, experiences in which they visit their interior gods and demons. These experiences simultaneously involve the subject’s psychological state, the whole range of emotional sensations, and the spectrum of his psychological perceptions. In these experi- ences, existential questions may come to light and demand an engaged response. The guided and cathartic process can help the individual to"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 transcend his or her ordinary mindset and ac- cess somatic memories. In the best cases, the individual is able to transcend the Ego, which can allow a healthy deflation of the Ego, a rec- onciliation with human nature, and an accep- tance of our modest inscription in time and in matter, which is nevertheless exciting because of its perceived meaning. In other words, this is a process of initiation; it is a semantic expe- rience which carries meaning that can respond to the chaotic and disorderly quest of the drug addict, which may be seen as a path of counter- initiation or as a savage initiation (Mabit, 1993). This therapeutic method does not, then, simply focus on abstinence, but also offers an adequate alternative. This alternative method, which respects altered states of consciousness, is able to respond to the drug addict’s quest by furnishing it with clear ends and with non-dan- gerous means to reach them. This process sup- poses an internal structural change which goes beyond the palliative of a simple external be- havioral change, which is never totally satisfy- ing and most often ineffective. The duration of the stay is, in general, nine months, and the follow-up is ideally two years. Takiwasi has received patients of all social and cultural origins. The techniques, which mainly demand self-exploration through the senses, do not require any analytic verbalization or inte- gration, which represents an enormous thera- peutic advantage. One may even say that these experiences of altered consciousness give ac- cess to ineffable, inexpressible trans-verbal spaces, which are as much pre-logical or infra- verbal as they are ecstatic or supra-verbal. Here, the local alcoholic peasant meets the European college student dependent on pot, the urban bourgeois who functions on cocaine, the dealer addicted to a cocaine-based paste, or the delin- quent pathological liar who smokes crack. To the contrary of what certain theorists say, the ex- ploration of the interior universe by these meth- ods does not require that either the therapist or the subject belong to the native culture of these practices. Rather, these practices give access to personal intra-psychical symbols which remain coherent to the subject and which touch depths that could be called transcultural by virtue of reaching universal psychological complexes (love, hate, rejection, abandon, fear, peace, etc.). At the same time, the accompanying psy- chotherapy allows the patient to better under- stand the experience of the session, to inte- grate it, generate new questions, and enrich the following session. We have now mastered these techniques ourselves, and we make use of them with patients from cultures other than our own. They are accessible to any Western therapist will- ing to fulfill the requirements of their long ap- prenticeship. “By plunging under the veils of ordinary consciousness and unblocking the paths of access to the deep Ego, this exploration of the subject’s interior universe brings out rich material....” Patients at Takiwasi"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Results Since its founding in 1992, the Takiwasi Center has received more than 380 patients. One study has just been made (Glove, not yet pub- lished) of the first seven years of activity (1992- 1998), examining drug addicts or alcoholics having completed at least one month of treat- ment and with at least two years of time out of the clinic – a sample of 211 courses of treat- ment (175 first-time patients and 36 returning patients). Note that the results of this study do not include data on the 32% of patients who leave during the first month before the first ayahuasca session, when the treatment is not yet considered to have started. 28% reached the sixth month of treatment, and 23.4% finished the entire treatment. Two-thirds of the patients consumed mainly a highly addictive and debilitating cocaine-based paste. 80% consumed alcohol alone or in addi- tion to other drugs. More than half of the pa- tients (53.5%) had already tried treatment, one- third of which had tried psychiatric services. For 49%, the gateway drug was alcohol, and for 42%, cannabis. The average age was thirty years and the average duration of consumption of psycho- active substances at the time of entrance was 12.5 years. At 31.3%, with a tendency to augmenta- tion, the index of retention (percentage of pre- scribed exits out of total exits) gives proof of the relative acceptance of this therapeutic method. The voluntary exits make up the major- ity (52%) compared to prescribed exits (23%), runaways (23%), and the rare expulsions (3%). The evaluation of the results integrates qualitative givens, as well as the incidence of abstinence or relapse due to poor prognostic criteria. One should note that the patients leave free of any post-residential medication. In ad- dition to evaluating the relation to addictive substances, especially those that the subject consumed before, we consider personal evolu- tion (internal structural change), the indications of social and professional reintegration, and the capacity for familial restructuring. According to these criteria, we may distinguish three categories: • “good”: favorable development, problems apparently resolved thanks to a true struc- tural change manifested upon several life levels. • “better”: favorable development with evi- dent structural changes, but vestiges of the original problem still present. • “same or bad”: relapse of consumption of substances, although often more dis- crete, no convincing structural change, fre- quent abandonment of substances for al- cohol. Out of the total, then, 31% were “good” and 23% “better,” while 23% were the “same or bad” and 23% unknown. With hindsight, we can affirm that about 35% of those who have lost contact with the Center are, in the end, “good” or “better” (that’s 8% of the total), which means that about 62% of the patients have, in the end, positively benefited from the follow-up of the model proposed at the Takiwasi Center. When one only takes into account the sample of the patients with “prescribed exit,” (those who have completed the entire program) the positive re- sults are raised to 67%. When the patients relapse or simply re-of- fend, 55.5% return to Takiwasi and 26% find other local practitioners of traditional medicine, which demonstrates their high opinion of this approach. When this occurs, purgative plants are more solicited than psychoactive plants. This choice demonstrates the absence of dependence on the psychoactive substances. This method, officially recognized by the Peruvian authorities, has expanded into a num- ber of programs including educational programs (for students), psychiatric and anthropological research, and outreach (written and audio-visual media, and seminars for personal development)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Conclusion The mere repression of drug consumption represents a simplistic approach to the prob- lem, with demonstrated ineffectiveness as a therapy. We may well call it illogical and even immoral since it omits the substances that are currently the most deadly (alcohol and tobacco). In addition, the accelerated development of new substances on the market outstrips any repres- sive attempt at control and relegates the game of penal interdictions to failure. We are hence condemned to approach the problem under an- other angle, whether we want to or not. Similarly, if harm reduction and substitu- tion only indicate proof of failure and a last- ditch effort of pure social convenience, they are also, in our view, reprehensible and morally du- bitable. This is because they consecrate a tacit rejection of healing, and the officialization, in a manner of speaking, of a population of sec- ond class citizens tolerated for lack of a thera- peutic alternative. The high degree of diffusion of the drug phenomenon in the 50’s and 60’s was born of the contact between a few intellectuals with traditional peoples, and, in particular, of North Americans with Amazonian Indians (Ginsberg, Leary, Alpert, etc., — see Leary, Metzner, Alpert, 1964). These intellectuals believed that they could appropriate ancestral knowledge while only retaining the physical substance, reducing “the approach of the gods” to the consumption of an active principle, playing neurochemists like ap- prentice sorcerers (see Leary’s delirious work, 1979). This oversimplified view of substances and their potential has generated a terrible drama. The phenomenon of substance addiction is characteristic of Westernized societies and continues to be practically unknown in indig- enous populations or among peoples free from prolonged Western influence. By approaching this ancient knowledge with respect and careful study, it seems possible to reinstate an authentic relation with the Mystery of Life by returning to true paths of initiation. By validating the legitimate quest of the drug user and redirecting it into a structured, mean- ingful experience, perhaps we may avoid the lax defeatism of the “anything goes” attitude as well as the rigid and useless bellicosity of “every- thing is forbidden.” Bibliography Chappe, Mario. 1976.

My partner and I had initially experi- enced Luna’s version of the ayahuasca ceremony at the Psychointegrator Plants Seminar in Manaus in July 2000, and attended the first Wasiwaska intensive in October 2001. The Wasiwaska experience is designed for small groups, and the first group consisted of six people, four of them American, one Canadian, and one Irishman. Our ayahuasca experiences were profound and deeply satis- fying. There were sixteen ayahuasca sessions during the first intensive, a schedule that meant taking ayahuasca every other day, with an occa- sional two-day break that then meant taking the potion several days in succession, something none of us had ever experienced before. Our accommodations were comfortable, in a facility that defies ad- equate description. Originally laid out by Tapani Hietalahti, a Finnish shaman/architect, Wasiwaska encourages the brain to shift to the intui- tive side. There are no right angles, stairs twist and meander, the floor levels change whimsically in unexpected places. The kitchen and dining area are built around a traditional Finnish “Dragonhearth” that seems to have a life of its own when a fire is present. A porch with large tree-like stone columns gives a feeling of the forest to a location where outdoor hammocks let par- ticipants enjoy the soft tropical night air while still enveloped in the ayahuasca dream. Located on the outskirts of the small fish- ing village of Sambaqui on the Island of Florianopolis, Wasiwaska overlooks the bay that lies between the island and the Brazilian mainland. From the house, one hears the sound of waves lapping the beach that is a short walk away, as well as the sounds of the sur- rounding neighborhood — an occasional cho- rus of dogs, the motors of the small boats used by fishermen and those who cultivate mussels and oysters, and the cries of birds. During the A Brazilian Ayahuasca Intensive at Wasiwaska (House of the Vine) Research Center for the Study of Psychointegrator Plants, Visionary Art and Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 day, the air is filled with an enormous variety of colorful butterflies, and dragonflies cruise above the trees in search of mosquitoes. During the October intensive, we took sev- eral excursions that added color and variety to the experience. We took a boat cruise around the island and visited historical sites; we took an overnight trip to a nearby hot springs resort on the mainland; we visited an ecological pre- serve on Campeche Island where there are petroglyphs dated at 4,000-5,000 years old. Of particular interest to our group was the fact that the petroglyphs depicted geometric patterns very similar to those one often sees on ayahuasca. Lectures by anthropologists at the University of Florianopolis (which has a particularly strong Department of Anthropology) enriched our ex- perience as well. Of course, the real reason one comes to Wasiwaska is for the ayahuasca. My partner and I had come in search of healing, and to learn more about this ancient plant medicine. Luna has filled the house with ayahuasca-related art, and has an outstanding collection of written material as well. When one is not immersed in the ayahuasca experience (or recovering from it) there is ample time for reading and discus- sion. The Wasiwaska proto- col includes adherence to a special diet, as well as sexual abstinence. The di- etary prohibitions are salt, sugar, alcohol, and strongly flavored season- ings. During both of our visits, excellent kitchen staff at the facility made adherence to the diet a very delicious experience. They served a wonderful variety of fruits and veg- etables. Fish, very fresh local seafood, and chicken were the protein sources. Coffee was not prohibited, which may have been one reason it was so easy to maintain a schedule that included much less sleep than one would normally get. On the nights we would partake of ayahuasca, meals would end with a light lunch, served about two p.m. in the Brazilian tradi- tion. We would typically drink ayahuasca about eight or nine p.m. The journey would then last until perhaps four or five a.m., with participants retiring to their rooms as the effects diminished. One normally comes out of an ayahuasca ses- sion feeling light and empty, and also very hun- gry. As a result, the kitchen staff was instructed to prepare a large pot of soup on ayahuasca nights, something that was very much appreci- ated by all members of the group. As one rarely sleeps immediately after a session, waiting for breakfast was sometimes difficult until the soup was made a regular part of the ritual. Luna’s ayahuasca ritual is uniquely his own, and allows each participant a great deal of free- dom in the journey. Prior experience with the potion is a prerequisite for the intensives, en- suring that no one in the group is surprised or alarmed by the effects of the brew. As the ritual begins, Luna brings out a beautifully crafted woolen rope that symbolizes the ceremonial circle. As it is passed to each participant, their"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 intent for the session is stated and a knot is tied in the rope. Luna asks each participant how much ayahuasca they wish to take in the ses- sion. It is always possible to ask for a “ booster” later in the session if one wishes. When all have done this, Luna ties the ends of the rope to- gether. The next day, in the “sharing” part of the ritual, each participant describes his expe- rience and unties one knot. The “sharings” are recorded, for archival purposes. After the brew has been poured, each par- ticipant holds his or her portion. (Earlier, every- one has prepared a mat for the journey, bring- ing a pillow, blanket, or whatever else is needed. Containers are issued for possible purging.) There is a moment of silence, for each participant to review her intent, then “Salud!” and the ayahuasca is drunk. Then, participants may go outside or sit quietly on their chosen mats until the music begins. Typically, Luna will sing a few songs that he learned when he was undergoing his ayahuasca apprenticeship, then he chooses from among his large collection of CDs to guide the journey. Each journey is different, with Luna choosing the music as he is inspired by the col- lective energy of the group. At any time, if any- one is having particular difficulty that requires intervention, Luna is available for assistance. He does not claim to be a shaman, but says “I know a few tricks.” In the ayahuasca sessions I have experienced with Luna, no one has had a difficulty that he was unable to mitigate. Luna’s potion is quite strong; after much experimentation, I arrived at an effective dose that was about half of what I was taking earlier in the program. His protocol, with the individual selecting the dose, is effective for those who are sensitive, while also serving the needs of “hardheads.” Every effort has been made to deal with the necessities of the brew — bathroom facilities are ample; people who wish to be out- doors during the experience find comfortable ac- commodation in hammocks close enough to the ritual area to have access to the music. The music itself is highly varied — everything from ambi- ent jungle noises to classical finds its way to the CD player at some time during the inten- sive. Every- one leaves the intensive either having purchased new music (CDs are rela- tively inex- pensive in Brazil, due to favorable ex- change rates) or with lists of music to purchase once home. In my own experience, I was exposed to types of music that I would have found difficult in the past, but for which I now have an appreciation. Why do people come to Wasiwaska to drink a mysterious potion (which some find less than appetizing) many times in close succession? Many come for healing; others come to gain clar- ity on personal issues with which they are hav- ing difficulty. Some come to enhance creativity, others simply to explore previously uncharted territory. Luna also encourages the participation of serious researchers, and the April 2002 inten- sive included a participant who brought a re- search project. Physicians, psychiatrists, and psychologists are attracted to the program to deepen their healing practices, and occasion- ally, in search of their own healing. And judging from Wasiwaska’s guest book, all leave having found what they were seeking. Wasiwaska is ayahuasca without shamans, without dogma, without a “guided tour” of transpersonal space. It is an experience that lets the individual set the goal and navigate his or her way toward that goal, in a totally supported and gentle and healing environment.

Aya huasca tourists are often bewil dered by the fact that al most every shaman claims to be the only person in all of Amazon ia who knows how to properly brew the magic potion. So the quest ion foremost in many peoples’ minds is, “How do I fi nd a good aya huasque ro?” In November 2001, I observed ayahuasca tourism while visiti ng Ucayali, Peru as part of a cactus identifica- tion resea rch project supported by a grant from Bob Wallace to MAPS (an article about this project will appear in the next issue of Entheogen Review). In Peru, the drug war is in full force. Televis ion shows port ray marijuana as a killer weed — although hemp leaf patc hes adorn the clothi ng of many adolesce nts.

A Religion and an Industry Aya huasca is popular a mong t he i ndigenous people a nd among many mestizo s. Pentecostal, Adventist, and (to a lesser extent) Cathol ic miss ion- aries have gained many converts in the indigenous com munit ies. While these Christ ians publ icly disavow shamanism, I met some who still pri- vately co nsume aya huasca and co ntinued other native religious pract ices. Ayahuasca Tourism: A Cautionary Tale R . Stuart (pacayacity@aol.com) “Ayahuasca tourists are often bewildered by the fact that almost every shaman claims to be the only person in all of Amazonia who knows how to properly brew the magic potion.”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Overall, ayahuasca is a valued part of Peruvian spiritual and economic life. The government tour- ist agencies sponsor ayahuasca festivals, the brew and the raw materials for its manufacture are openly sold in markets, and even Peru’s cur- rent president Alejandro Toledo participated in an ayahuasca ceremony. Ayahuasca tourism is popular elsewhere in South America as well. Some tourists visit Bra- zilian ayahuasca churches such as the Santo Daime. Others go on the more expensive Ameri- can-led retreats. While the four-star ayahuasca resorts may feel overly contrived, any tour led by Peter Gorman is almost certainly going to be interesting. For the past decade, many ayahuasca tour- ists in Peru have flocked to Iquitos. Another popular location, although it lacks a hotel, is the Shipibo town of San Francisco, which can be reached by a taxi ride from Yarina. In fact, the enormous sign at the entrance of San Fran- cisco proclaims that the town is the “Centro Cer- emonial del Ayahuasca.” There are at least a couple of ayahuasqueros in almost every Shipibo family. Many of these practitioners are willing to host services both for other Peruvians and also for foreign visitors. A Medical Caution Most shamans are unfamiliar with Western pharmaceuticals, so it is the tourist’s responsi- bility to be aware that ayahuasca can have ad- verse interactions with various prescription medi- cines, particularly some medications used to treat AIDS, depression and psychiatric disorders. For instance, one AIDS patient died during a cer- emony in Bolivia, although he was sufficiently healthy to dance at the beginning of the ser- vice. About The Ceremony Unless a tourist spent a long while getting to know a practitioner, the character of a com- mercialized ayahuasca ceremony would probably be shallower than a ritual conducted solely for the benefit of the shaman’s relatives and com- munity. In a commercialized ceremony, one could observe the ritual procedures and enjoy listen- ing to the chanting of icaros. Probably the dose of ayahuasca would be mild, as the shaman would usually rather err on the side of caution, prefer- ring to give too little rather than too much. Given the linguistic barriers and cultural misun- derstandings that are likely to confound com- munication even in the ordinary state of con- sciousness, it is only prudent for the shaman to take reasonable precautions to prevent problems with foreigners. The Ayahuasqueros I had the opportunity to spend time get- ting to know several ayahuasqueros who per- form ceremonies for tourists. “B” is an elderly shaman in Yarina, a town near the city of Pucallpa. I lived in the ceremonial hut in his back yard for a week, observing the nightly ayahuasca ceremonies that attract up to a couple dozen visitors. I became familiar with B’s lead- ership style because his son, the director of the family religious practice, was giving workshops in the United States. I discovered that B is a frequent liar, a shoplifter, and that he soon asks “Unless a tourist spent a long while getting to know a practitioner, the character of a commercialized ayahuasca ceremony would probably be shallower than a ritual conducted solely for the benefit of the shaman’s relatives and community.”"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 for money or gifts at every opportunity. Two other aya- huasqueros were vis- iting B’s group for a two-week training. One was a sweet and wonderful guy, but his partner always hustled me for spare change. I also met B’s nephew, an enterprising shaman who earns a couple hundred dollars per month catering to tourists while his neighbors can not even afford a thirty cent taxi ride. He charges thirty dollars to give ayahuasca to a tourist, while the going rate for a Peruvian is about two dollars. I met several other ayahuasqueros during my travels, some of whom seemed to be fair, and some who did not. In the town of San Fran- cisco, I met “E,” who was widely regarded as an honorable man. At night I heard icaros being sung in the darkness of his home while he held private services for his family. I believe he charged about ten dollars to give ayahuasca to a tourist. I also met and learned the life history of “A,” whose invitations for rituals I declined after he swindled me on the price of a tobacco pipe. I share these stories to point out that it is a tricky endeavor to travel to a third world coun- try and ask a total stranger for a spiritual expe- rience. While many sha- mans undoubtedly come to their profes- sion to help others, be aware that ayahuasca tourism is a thriving business in Peru, and that you will likely be treated as just that – a tourist. Of course, my personal observations and encounters will be different than those of any other person travelling to Peru. But I would advise prospective tourists to weigh their own motivations to determine if it is worth making a long trip to another continent. If one is inter- ested in learning about many different aspects of another society, and is willing to navigate Peru’s unpolished infrastructure, then it might be interesting to also try ayahuasca while on vacation. If one were specifically interested only in experiencing ayahuasca, it would be more cost- effective to home-brew a batch with ingredi- ents ordered from an ethnobotanical supplier. With the help of an experienced friend as a sit- ter, one could have an intense entheogenic ex- perience in the safety and comfort of home or in an isolated natural setting. This do-it-your- self approach could potentially be far more en- lightening than what one might experience af- ter traveling all the way to South America. “This do-it-yourself approach could potentially be far more enlightening than what one might experience after traveling all the way to South America.” Pablo Amaringo The Three Powers Detail"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 In Search of Ayahuasca in the Netherlands I began my research in Den Haag in January, hosted by Hans Bogers of the Den Haag branch of the Santo Daime church. We met at his house and then pro- ceeded to the location where that night’s ‘work’ was being held. Having navigated our way through several alleys feeding into a larger road in downtown Den Haag, we came upon a gate guarding the door to an old cathedral. Once the home of Catholic nuns, it had now become a multi-purpose building, hosting a variety of activities including children’s day care, yoga sessions, and Santo Daime ‘works’. Having stepped over the brightly colored toys littering the stoop, we passed into the inner room. Inside the cool stone walls, the quiet chatter of the participants changing into their uniforms stood in contrast to the hours of hymns and dancing accompanied by guitars and maracas that followed, all centered upon the Daime sacra- ment. Though the hymns spoke of familiar Catholic figures, the ‘work’, in which the participation of all is essential at every moment, contrasted sharply with the often less-than-engaging Catholic masses of my childhood. This contrast must have been prevalent for members of the church, as many came from Catholic backgrounds. To discover a religion whose only doc- trine is contained in these simple hymns, whose members dance back and forth, creating a spiral up to heaven with their movements must have been truly revolutionary. That the Santo Rational Ecstasy?:Conditions of Possibility of Entheogenic Practice in the Modern US Sarah Hussin (sarahhussin@hotmail.com) I received a one thousand dollar grant from MAPS to support research for my undergraduate thesis relating to entheogens. This funding provided me with the opportunity to visit several groups in Holland who use ayahuasca legally in a religious context. I graduated from New College of Florida in May 2002, and my thesis is available through the MAPS website. “...funding provided me with the opportunity to visit several groups in Holland who use ayahuasca legally in a religious context.”"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Daime hold ‘works’, as opposed to masses or services, reflects this environment in which all actively - and often quite strenuously- partici- pate, forging a collective connection with the divine through every note sung, every step danced. While the Christian must accept the tran- substantiation of the communion wafer on faith, the direct religious experience of these entheogenic users carries its own conviction, directly accessible to all who partake. The Santo Daime and other modern religious revivals - in- cluding Pentecostalism and eastern mystical movements- share Aldous Huxley’s goal of pro- viding individuals with the types of experiences that they could previously only read about in the mystic literature. Such mystical experiences of belonging forge active, participatory, experi- ential forms of religious existence that issue a powerful protest against modern alienation. This embrace of direct experience in the face of alienation necessarily engenders conflict with those in power: ecstatic religious experi- ence often runs counter to modern rational ex- istence. This conflict certainly has a long and often disturbing history; the periodic DEA raids on Santo Daime ‘works’ are part of a much longer, more deeply ingrained struggle, going back to the devastating encounters between Spanish conquistadores and the indigenous peoples whose lands they invaded. The Spaniards deemed mush- rooms “demonic holy communicants,” 1 and sys- tematically repressed native religious use. Mediation and Integration We can see this conflict between modern rationality and ecstatic religious experience be- ing played out ideologically and politically. Con- flict within the political realm is much more prominent for those groups who use entheogens to achieve ecstatic religious states. While political repression is perhaps the primary barrier to entheogenic use, it is cer- tainly not the only one. Individuals exist within and are formed by modern society, so this struggle takes place not merely between reli- gious participants and the government that op- poses them. Indeed, this is a struggle being played out within small groups and individuals; we are simultaneously formed by modern ratio- nality and seek to react against it, so we en- gage in this conflict with ourselves. More ex- plicitly, we exist within this society which is, in some ways, at odds with these experiences, and must find ways to mediate between entheogenic experiences and life within the modern US; here, we are referring to the problem of integration. My project addressed this problem of me- diation and integration by examining the reli- gious use of LSD in the 1960s, the entheogenic use of the Jívaro of Ecuador, and the religious ecstasy of Pentecostalism. I discussed some fac- tors in the dissipation of the religious move- ment centered upon LSD and then attempted to illuminate them through discussions of the Jívaro and Pentecostalism. The Jívaro are useful to ex- amine as a society into which entheogenic use is firmly integrated. They are successful in me- diating between daily life and the entheogenic experience by forging connections between the two realms that embrace virtually all aspects of existence, from the most sacred to the most mun- dane. “One can hardly name any aspect of living or dying, wakefulness or sleep, where caapi hal- lucinations do not play a vital, nay, overwhelm- ing role.” 2 “My project addressed this problem of mediation and integration by examining the religious use of LSD in the 1960s, the entheogenic use of the Jívaro of Ecuador, and the religious ecstasy of Pentecostalism.”"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Like LSD users, Pentecostals were part of a group who embraced ecstatic religious experi- ence marked by altered states of consciousness in the 20 th Century US. Despite their initial con- flicts with established power complexes, they ended up growing and thriving. I examined the means by which they were successful and the ways in which they mediated between both ec- static experience and daily life, and between the religious group and society at large. These three groups provide an opportu- nity to examine systems capable of bridging the chasms between the self and the religious group, the group and the world, inner experience and outer existence. While entheogenic use in the 1960s often exacerbated modern alienation, it is clear that this need not be the case and, through appropriate ritual, such use can pro- vide an opportunity to integrate oneself into the social world, to achieve a more holistic and unified existence. This is precisely what Santo Daime members throughout the world seek to achieve. With this in mind, I analyzed some con- ditions - including practice and belief - that made such integration possible for these groups in the past, with an eye towards the contemporary religious use of entheogens. In the US this con- temporary use is not limited to highly organized Christian groups such as the Santo Daime. The form that religious use takes depends upon the group involved; indeed, some have compared the ritual involved in raves to Native American peyote ceremonies, reflecting the myriad formal possibilities for contemporary entheogenic reli- gious practice. The conditions that I analyzed allow for such diversity. I hope that by taking such conditions into account, contemporary entheogenic practitioners of all types will con- tinue to forge socially integrative, personally ful- filling religious existences, guided by Huxley’s utopian vision of an experience that would “abol- Pablo Amaringo The Sublimity of the Sumiruna Detail ish our solitude as individuals, attune us with our fellows in a glowing exaltation of affection and make life in all its aspects seem not only worth living, but divinely beautiful and signifi- cant.” 3 1 Cited in John Marks, The Manchurian Candidate, Inner Tradi- tions, 1991, p. 113. 2 Schultes, RE, Vine of the Soul: Medicine Men, Their Plants and Rituals in the Colombian Amazon, Synergetic Press, 1992. 3 Horowitz, M, Palmer, C (Eds), Moksha: Aldous Huxley's Classic Writings on Psychedelics and the Visionary Experience, 1999, p. 9. “While entheogenic use in the 1960s often exacerbated modern alienation, it is clear that this need not be the case....”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Touching history is one of the most exciting things you can do. Entering thousands of entries into a database is not. Nor are removing tape, sorting papers, or digging through musty filing cabinets. However, this seemingly uninspiring work gave me the chance to touch both the past and future of psyche- delic research, as I helped in two projects to organize old data for new use. LSD and psilocybin bibliography Since November 2001, I have been helping Earth & Fire Erowid (who run the large and thorough drug information site, www.erowid.org) to digitize the Albert Hofmann Foundation Col- lection, creating an online searchable database of peer-reviewed, published scientific literature on LSD and psilocybin. Originally compiled by the staff of the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation during Albert Hofmann’s resi- dence there, this collection of about four thousand documents represents nearly every research paper on LSD or psilocybin published worldwide be- tween the mid-1940s and the mid-1970s. Medline, the National Institutes of Health database of medical literature, only goes back to about 1966, omitting the majority of the psychedelic research papers. And while Medline contains bibliographic entries, most with abstracts but only a few with links to the entire paper, our database will include bibliographic entries with abstracts and with links to each paper. Albert Hofmann donated the papers to the Albert Hofmann Founda- tion, which lent them to Erowid for the digitizing project. MAPS is sponsor- ing this effort and, in addition to the dona- tion of my labor and the purchase of docu- ment storage materials, has spent about $7200 thus far to create searchable PDF files of the papers.

The collection is composed of about 20 boxes, each containing books of papers, many of which are yellowed and brittle with age. We carefully removed the papers from the books and sorted them, hand-scanning those that were too deli- cate to risk a trip to the scanning company. Earth and Fire have now re- turned the papers to books, which will be sent back to Albert Hofmann in Switzerland. The database will allow students, research- ers, and other interested folks to perform key- word searches to find relevant articles, and then download or print the papers. It will be avail- able on the websites for MAPS (www.maps.org), Erowid (www.erowid.org), and the Albert Hofmann Foundation (www.hofmann.org). In this way, the world’s early scientific literature on LSD and psilocybin will not be lost in dusty libraries but made accessible in perpetuity to anyone with curiosity and a computer.

In addition to requesting sev- eral changes in protocol design, FDA asked for more background information, particularly safety data, from earlier LSD psychotherapy studies with cancer patients. Working with Yensen and Dryer, I reviewed the files of cancer patients treated with LSD in the 1960s and early 1970s by the pioneer psychedelic researcher, Walter Pahnke, MD. I created case report forms with which to record data, and completed forms for the 25 cancer patient files still available after thirty years. I compiled information about each patient’s LSD session, including dosage, concomi- tant medications, and any adverse events. Another volunteer, Jennifer Landis, has com- pleted forms for about 300 other patient files, prima- rily from counselor training sessions and studies with alcoholic or neurotic patients. Handling the actual raw data from these patients’ files was a powerful and convincing experience. I was able to read first-person ac- counts of LSD sessions written by men and women from all walks of life – factory workers and executives, housewives and lawyers, young and old people. These were fascinating, and of- ten described cathartic and transformative ex- periences. Examining the medical records, I noted how patients often voluntarily reduced their dosage of pain medications in the days following the session. I also read letters from patients’ families thanking Dr. Pahnke and the other researchers; many of these reported that after the LSD session, their loved ones had been able to finally accept impending death and fo- cus on enjoying their last days. In both projects, we hope that our efforts to archive history will aid future researchers and students, so that the knowledge of the past will be preserved, and the potential of these sub- stances to help people can be further explored and applied. “Handling the actual raw data from these patients’ files was a powerful and convincing experience.”"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Frederick: After about nine years working on the physical and technical side of neuroscience, a departure from my work as an undergraduate phi- losophy major, the Tucson conference was an inspiring reminder of why I became a scientist. The “hard problem” of biopsychology— how and why subjectively felt qualities are so remotely different from the physi- cal, chemical, and anatomical properties of the brain—is what origi- nally convinced me that I needed to understand both sides of the “bridge equations” I was trying to find. Staffing a MAPS information table, I answered questions about my own research interests that forced me to focus and re-examine my psychedelic-inspired research proposals that I haven’t looked at in many years. I think that psychedelic drugs act as psychophysiological “stains,” enhancing the conscious resolution and contrast of sub- conscious psychological and physiological processes, just like his- tochemical stains allow light microscopists to differentiate subcel- lular organelles from the background in a tissue slice. It is com- monly believed that psychedelics can bring out subconscious con- tent of the Freudian or Jungian variety. I also happen to believe that much of the “noisy” or uninterpretable hallucinatory content results from a sensory cross-over or “synesthesia” from subconscious sensory modalities, such as those detecting changes in the internal organs. I believe that psychedelics like psilocybin, in relatively low doses, could help biofeedback therapists to train patients to more quickly learn physiological self-regulation skills, by allowing them to more readily differentiate the internal source of the subconscious signal that the biofeedback equipment is displaying. Several presentations at the “Toward a Science of Consciousness” con- ference suggested to me that the time is ripe for reintroducing psychedelic drug effects as a variable in experiments studying consciousness. On the first day, a number of speakers talked about the implications of “sensory substitution” experiments. A promising new breed of “sensory prosthetics” are being engineered and marketed that allow, for instance, blind people to “see” the visual world using an auditory or tactile interface. Peter Meijer of Two in Tucson Reports on the “Toward a Science of Consciousness” conference (April 8-12, sponsored by the Center for Consciousness Studies, University of Arizona) and “The Dark Side of Consciousness” conference (April 10-14, the annual conference of the Society for the Anthropology of Consciousness) Jon Frederick, Ph.D (smiile@psynet.net), Alex Gamma (gamma@bli.unizh.ch), and Jon Hanna (JonRHanna@prodigy.net) “...psychedelic drugs act as psychophysio- logical“stains,” enhancing the conscious reso- lution and contrast of subconscious psychological and physiological processes.”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Philips Research Laboratories presented the VOICE interface, which represents the height of an object with pitch, and its position from left to right as a time delay over a 1-second scan (visit www.seeingwithsound.com for examples). The resolution is about 60 x 60 pixels, black- and-white. Interestingly, after sufficient train- ing, blind subjects report experiencing images in space rather than sound, and can also listen to conversations or music without confusion. The phenomenon of sensory substitution lead some philosophers at the conference to suggest that at a fundamental level, the content of perceptual conscious- ness should be con- ceptualized not in terms of the sensory organ involved, but rather in terms of the behavioral goal, and the feedback received in pursuit of that goal. One of the problems with this research is that a considerable amount of training is required to learn the new cross-modal skill. Could psychedelics be used to enhance the rate and extent of learning to represent tactile or auditory signals visually? The phenomenon of synesthesia, “hearing colors” or “seeing sounds,” is often reported by subjects during psychedelic drug experiments. We should also take seriously the developmental differentiat- ing effects of psychedelics—that is, their abil- ity to induce a psychological state in which people report seeing their particular develop- mental path as one reality among many poten- tial realities. While this property of psychedelics is better understood for expanding one’s con- sciousness into alternative emotional and philo- sophical realities, it is an open empirical ques- tion whether psychedelics could help to expand the consciousness of one sensory modality into the practical skills of another. The functional anatomy of rewiring the auditory cortex to perform visual tasks was de- scribed in a presentation by Mriganka Sur of MIT. During development, growing axons from the vi- sual system are usually blocked from forming synapses with the auditory areas of the thala- mus by a protein called Ephrin A. If the growth of axons from the auditory system to the brain is blocked in young mammals, Ephrin A is no longer produced and synapses are formed be- tween the auditory thalamus and axons from the visual track. Interest- ingly, the areas of the auditory cortex to which the auditory thalamus projects then develop columns of cells that selec- tively respond to vi- sual stimuli. Visual space becomes mapped in the audi- tory cortex in a man- ner similar to what is normally seen in the primary visual con- text. A similar re-mapping of the sensory cortex occurs when a person loses a limb. The cortical region that previously responded to sensory in- put from the limb becomes sensitive to tactile input from the face, resulting in “phantom” sen- sations from the missing limb. This is not unlike the general hallucinatory phenomena that hap- pen during sensory deprivation, such as that which can occur in flotation tanks. Deprived of the normal sensory “signal,” the cortex tunes into and imposes order on the background “noise,” which–in this case—is the activity of the adjacent cortex that is processing tactile input from the face. However, the phantom limb cortex maintains “top down” processing, expe- riencing sensations from the face in terms of its previous experience with the limb. Gradually, the perceptual experience of the limb shrinks as the \"Several presentations at the ‘Toward a Science of Consciousness’ conference suggested to me that the time is ripe for reintroducing psychedelic drug effects as a variable in experiments studying consciousness.\""},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 cortex is reprogrammed to the new patterns of input and output. Like the blind patient who needs to attend to the spatial information rather than the sound in Peter Meijer’s VOICE inter- face, the phantom limb patient also needs to suspend the top-down processing of one sen- sory modality to allow it to “re-imprint” the sen- sorimotor contingencies of another. It is not very controversial to say that psy- chedelic drugs cause abnormal sensory associa- tions to occur. When sensory substitution is an essential therapeutic goal ( i.e., as opposed to a very bad idea when operating a motor vehicle), this suggests the hypothesis that psychedelics could help facilitate the cross-modal sensory “permeability” that is needed. Possibly, lower doses may provide this effect during regular training procedures, without excessive distrac- tion to the patient. Hanna: William S. Burroughs said that “language is a virus.” Taking this idea a step further, the English psychologist and writer Susan Blackmore, who presented at the “Toward a Science of Con- sciousness” conference, might feel that “cul- ture—or perhaps even consciousness itself—is a parasite.” Or at least they are symbioses, which hook into our meat puppets and make us dance. A proponent of the “meme” theory (see Gamma below), Blackmore’s name was excitedly men- tioned to me by virtually everyone I met the night before the conference. After checking out her talk on “the contents of consciousness,” I could see what the buzz was about. Following the “Toward a Science of Consciousness” shin- dig, at the Society for the Anthropology of Con- sciousness’ annual conference, I mentioned Blackmore’s name and meme theory to a friend that hadn’t heard of her. Within mere minutes of the end of that conversation, Stanley Krippner joined us and out of the blue asked my friend, “Have you heard of Susan Blackmore?” In the manner in which memes spread from mouth to ear, Blackmore has hitched herself to a powerful concept. Gamma: Susan Blackmore, author of The Meme Machine (Oxford University Press, 1999), headed a workshop on memetics. Memetics is the study of “memes.” So what is a meme? Literally, a meme is “that which is copied,” or “that which is imi- tated.” If I tell you that Rick Doblin’s grand- mother saw a UFO land in her backyard, and you tell this to your friends, and they tell it to their friends and so on, what we’re spreading is a meme. Other examples of memes are the story of the old lady who put her poodle in the micro- wave (with devastating consequences), a hair- cut that becomes popular, a fake computer vi- rus warning that spreads, or the religious belief in life after death (or any other religious idea). It doesn’t matter whether memes are in any sense true or not; it is only important that they spread. While all this may seem like nothing much, the theory of memes gains scientific credibility by obeying the rules of Darwinian evolutionary systems. The home territories of Darwinian evo- lution are genes and organisms. Different or- ganisms will have differential reproductive suc- cess according to how well they are adapted to their current environment: the better adapted an organism is, the more offspring it will have, and the more its genes will spread in the gene pool of the species. The same process is at work in memetics: different memes reproduce or spread with differential success, depending on how well they survive in their natural environ- ment. In this case, the natural environment is of course human minds—or, in some cases, com- puters’ operating systems (preferably “Win- dows”). As in living organisms, where genes can mix up and recombine with other genes, memes in the human mind can mix up and recombine with other memes. We can see that the basic ingredients of Darwinian evolution are present in memetic systems just as they are present in genetic systems. What is memetics supposed to explain? According to Blackmore, the evolution of memes shaped or even created the human mind, in- cluding our language ability. Regarding con-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 sciousness, Blackmore proposes that memes may distort consciousness, and by clearing our minds of them—by meditation, for example—we might see more clearly what consciousness is. The fa- mous American philosopher Daniel Dennett, however, thinks that our memes are our con- sciousness. Despite its apparently sound scientific foun- dation, memetics is not taken seriously by many scientists. What may be the reasons? One pos- sible reason became clear to me during Blackmore’s workshop. The theory as she pre- sented it spoke exclusively about how memes shape human minds, seize control of them, and use them to spread more copies of themselves. Like the “selfish genes” of Richard Dawkins (who popularized the idea of memes), memes are sup- posed to be selfish too—using human minds for their own purposes. Hence, human minds seem to be reduced to mere breeding sites or copying machines for memes. This view is deeply dissatisfying, as it leaves out the active role of the mind in forming beliefs and judgements, shaping our opinions, and making decisions. Moreover, it appears to threaten our dearly-held beliefs about free will, rationality, and being the subjects of our own actions. Some think that if one embraces such a view, the only consequence can be fatalism: the helpless acceptance of one’s life being controlled by alien forces. Blackmore doesn’t agree with this pessimistic conclusion. Nevertheless, Blackmore’s exposition of the sub- ject left crucial questions about the active role of the human mind in creating and manipulat- ing memes unanswered, in the same way that popular views of genetics tend to ignore the importance of non-genetic influences on human mind and behavior. Hanna: Other noteworthy plenary sessions in- cluded the discussion of “Machine Conscious- ness” with Ray Kurzweil and Rodney Brooks— which exposed the current state of artificial in- telligence and robotics and postulated about future directions, and V.S. Ramachandran’s dis- cussion of “Art & the Brain”—which presented a number of fascinating neurological correlations between aesthetics and synesthetic perceptions. My own presentation at “Toward a Science of Consciousness” was to be a slide show of psy- chedelic art during the concurrent session on “altered states of consciousness.” (Susan “there she is again” Blackmore was the discussant of this session.) Unfortunately, the conference pro- ducers failed to provide the slide projector that they had promised, leaving me high and dry. (Charles Tart, who also presented during this session, had to go on sans overhead projector as well). This left me with a fair amount of time to plug MAPS to the 130 folks or so in the audi- ence. It was encouraging to see that nearly 25% of those in attendance at “Toward a Science of Consciousness” showed up for this session, which was the most well-attended concurrent session at the conference. Although people interested in psychedelics are clearly a subgroup of those interested in consciousness studies, I feel that anyone interested in psychedelics would have gained a lot from attending the “Toward a Sci- ence of Consciousness” conference. As well, the Society for the Anthropology of Consciousness conference on the topic of “The Dark Side of Consciousness,” featured a great panel discussion on Datura , numerous presen- tations on aspects of shamanism, a slide show of sacred sites across the world, drum circle workshops, a discussion of the relevance of a Huichol Indian artist’s use of color, and ideas about dream theory, the origins of religion, techno culture, alternative medicine, multidi- mensional mind models, and much more. We heartily encourage more MAPS members to at- tend future conferences produced by “Toward a Science of Consciousness” (http:// www.consciousness. arizona.edu) and the Soci- ety for the Anthropology of Consciousness (http:// sunny.moorparkcollege.edu/~jbaker/sac/ home.html)."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 THE ALBERT HOFMANN FOUNDATION I NTERNATIONAL L IBRARY FOR THE S TUDY OF C ONSCIOUSNESS www.hofmann.org BOARD OF DIRECTORS Oscar Janiger, M.D., Chairman* Kathleen Janiger, MBA, President* John Beresford, M.D., Secretary Myron Stolaroff, M.A., Treasurer Donald Wylie, J.D.

While his body experiences some of the effects of aging, presenting a few aches and pains, this does not prevent his satisfying afternoon walks around the beautiful landscape that surrounds his Swiss home. His mind is clear and his voice is strong and articulate. For some two years now, Dr. Hofmann has not been receiving interviewers or visitors, feeling that he has completely expressed his views in available published material. He did, however, consent to a final documentary, a history of LSD being prepared by the National Film Board of Canada. This documentary promises to be the best treatment of the subject filmed to date. At age 95, Dr. Hofmann gave a very inspirational interview, a portion of which will appear in the initial release. For the balance of this Hofmann Report, we are pleased to introduce our advisor Ralph Metzner. Ralph Metzner obtained a B.A. in Philosophy and Psychology at Oxford Uni- versity, and a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at Harvard University, and also held a postdoctoral fellowship in Psychopharmacology at the Harvard Medical School. As reported in Shaman’s Drum, (Number 51, 1999), Ralph Metzner is world renowned as a pioneer in the study of consciousness and transformative experience. He worked with Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert on psychedelic research, edited the Psyche- delic Review, co-authored The Psychedelic Experience (1964), and edited The Ecstatic Adventure (1968). He is also the author of Maps of Consciousness (1971), Know Your Type (1979), Opening to Inner Light (1986), and The Well of Remembrance (1994). He has pursued research in altered states of consciousness and cross-cultural meth- ods of consciousness expansion, and published more than seventy-five articles on consciousness, shamanism, alchemy, transformation, and mythology. He is a profes- sor of psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, and maintains a private practice of psychotherapy in the Bay Area. He is president and co-founder of the Green Earth Foundation (http://www.rmetzner-greenearth.org/), a non-profit educational organization devoted to healing and harmonizing the hu- man relationship with the Earth. His most recently published book is The Unfolding Self: Varieties of Transformative Experience (Origin Press, 1998 ), and Green Psychology, Transforming Our Relationship to Earth (Inner Traditions International, 1999 ). Dr . Metzner can be contacted via e-mail at rmetzner@svn.net Ralph Metzner has now been active in the field of Consciousness Studies, in- cluding altered states induced by drugs, plants, and other means, for over thirty-five years. Ralph has been one of the most dedicated explorers in investigating various means and methods of producing profoundly altered states. Starting in the 1960s with psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin, his searches led him to non- drug methods used throughout history and around the globe. His investigations cover an extremely wide range of practices that mankind has used to achieve high levels of awareness and the discovery of our true nature. Our soul’s yearning, whether we realize it or not, is to release our Self from our self-made bonds and unfold into the far reaches of the enormous potentials and exciting realizations that are our birthright.

The results of much of his dedicated work are presented in his outstand- ing book, The Unfolding Self (cited above). In this volume, Ralph has gathered an exhaustive num- ber of methods of transformation, so that seekers of almost any persuasion or belief system can find a vehicle which will ignite the flame of desire for further development. He has studied the practices of Shamans and Wise Ones that have been ap- plied throughout history and around the world. He has become thoroughly familiar with the vari- ous stages of progression and levels of achievement; he has recognized those obstacles which appear as hindrances to persons locked in various false be- lief systems or in various states of progress; and he has studied the procedures which can be helpful in freeing one from this spectrum of barriers. I believe that anyone who is seriously seeking self- understanding, achieving profound realization, and freedom from afflictions, will find a great amount of help in this book. In the introduction, Metzner states: “there exists in human experience another kind of trans- formation, a radical restructuring of the entire psyche that has been variously referred to as mys- tical experience, ecstasy, cosmic consciousness, oceanic feeling, oneness, transcendence, union with God, nirvana, satori, liberation, peak experi- ence, and by other names.” In this introduction, many metaphors are given to describe such trans- formation. In the following chapters, various aspects of transformation are dealt with, such as waking up from dreaming to reality, discovering the veils of illusion which prevent us from experiencing our deeper Self, and methods of freeing ourselves to discover our true nature. The latter includes such practices as moving from captivity to liberation; purification by Inner Fire, reconciling with the Inner Enemy; dying and being reborn, integrat- ing the inner Wild Animal, journey to the Place of Vision and Power; returning to the Source. I doubt if anyone can read this book without gain- ing fresh understanding of human possibilities and the enormous potential that lies in waiting when we commit ourselves to the journey of realization. It is clear that in more recent times Ralph’s interests have focused more directly on the use of native plant materials, and specifically Ayahuasca, the subject of his recent book AYAHUASCA: Hu- man Consciousness and the Spirit of Nature, (Thunder’s Mouth Press, NY, 1999). He attributes his move in this direction to several factors (see the Shaman’s Drum interview noted above): an intentional move away from the newly created synthetic psychedelics; the native plants have been thoroughly proven and established over long peri- ods of time by numbers of users in various places in the world, including Africa and South America; their extraordinarily powerful healing and transformitive powers have been very well estab- lished; an analysis of the practices of many differ- ent groups reveal common procedures that effec- tively focus individual experiences and support the participants in having fruitful outcomes. For ex- ample, the bonding of a group and the interchange of energy is of great help to the individual who may be running into difficult or painful areas in his/her unconscious. The group support provides assurance which eases the intensity of the discom- fort and permits the subject to more readily re- solve the situation and rise to the surface. Also, the custom of dancing and singing together that some gatherings employ strengthens the bonds and eases the passageway to higher realization. The final section of Ayahuasca deals with Con- clusions, Reflections, and Speculations. Here are some excerpts from this chapter: “...the drinking of ayahuasca is something like"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 a master cure for all illness...it is clear from the literature and stories recounted in this volume, that remarkable physical healings and resolutions of psychological difficulties can occur with this medi- cine. Early in the twentieth century an extract of the vine was used successfully in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, a possible application that has not to date been followed up. There have been an- ecdotal accounts of complete remission of some cancers after one or two sessions with ayahuasca.” “...The research by Grob, McKenna, Callaway and their associates with the Brazilian hoasca church known as UDV showed that there were sig- nificant differences on several personality trait measures between the long-term use of hoasca and a nonusing group. Psychiatric interviews also con- firmed these differences in that the subjects re- ported making positive changes in their behavior (less drinking and drug use, more responsibility and confidence) as a result of their participation in the hoasca ceremonies...The hoasca users per- formed better than controls on short-term verbal learning tasks—capabilities that usually decline with age.” “From the stories related in this volume, one cannot help but be impressed by the remarkable health-enhancing effects attributed to the purging action of the vine. People describe the liberating, lightening, color-enhancing, strengthening after- effect of la purga in near-rapturous tones...Many first-time ayahuasca users have to overcome an ini- tial inhibition to vomiting, because of its usual as- sociations with sickness. Once this is done, they find that the purging is easy and effortless and not at all accompanied by nausea or queasiness.” “There is an interesting covergence that often happens between physical purging and psychic purging—what seems to be a kind of discharge of negatively toned psychic contents. People who do not have any appreciable physical toxicity in their system may yet find themselves throwing up and thereby releasing the toxic residues of past emo- tional entanglements, the guilt and shame loads of traumatic abuse, or the self-limiting , self-defeat- ing thought-patterns of addictions, compulsions and other neurotic behaviors. Sometimes people might even find that what they are discharging through the vomiting is not so much their per- sonal “stuff,” but some portion of the collective consciousness-bands of humanity.” Metzner completes the Ayahuasca book by ex- amining possible effects on the world situation. “...the unprecedented industrial-technological as- sault on the biosphere we are witnessing in our time is rooted in the mechanistic scientism of the modern world, which deliberately divorced itself from spirituality, values, and consciousness. There exists a vast gulf in common understanding be- tween what we regard as sacred and what we re- gard as natural. And yet, out of the experiences of millions of individuals in the Western world with hallucinogenic sacraments, as well as other shamanic practices, we are seeing the re-emergence of the ancient integrative worldview that sees all of life as an interdependent web of relationships, that needs to be carefully protected and preserved.” After a historical review of how entheogenic and native plant substances have come into use and the impacts they have made up to current times, Metzner associates these developments with an instinctive evolutionary or karmic development to counter the mounting crisis in world civilization. “Certainly, it is not difficult to see the parallels in several cultural movements that seek to correct the dangerous imbalance in humanity’s relation to na- ture: in deep ecology and ecofeminism, which call for a respectful, egalitarian, ecocentric attitude to- wards the natural world; in the organic gardening and farming movements, which seek to return to traditional methods avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides; in the movement to increased use of herbal, nutritional and complementary healing modalities with less reliance on high-tech inter- ventions; and in several other philosophical, sci- entific and religious movements...” In these diverse movements and disciplines toward healthier recognition of interrelatedness, “the respectful use of entheogenic plant medicines in spiritual/therapeutic contexts may yet come to play a highly significant role...Instead of the usual attitude of arrogant and exploitative superiority, those who have experienced ayahuasca and other entheogens are more likely to find themselves humbled and awed by the mysterious powers of nature, and strive to live in a simpler way that mini- mizes environmental harm and celebrates the as- tonishing diversity and beauty of life.” Ralph Metzner is to be congratulated and hon- ored for his dedicated efforts to preserve our planet and to help bring peace and fulfillment to its in- habitants."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Report from the Heffter Research Institute David E. Nichols, Ph.D., President (drdave@pharmacy.purdue.edu) James Thornton, Executive Director (JamesThorntonUK@aol.com) “The Heffter Research Center in Zurich has grown, and there are now eight people working there on the neuroscience of hallucinogens.” F irst, we have just published a new edition of The Heffter Review. I believe it contains articles of real merit. If you enjoy reading about psychedelic research, you’ll want to get a copy! Second: we have selected Dr. George Aghajanian as the winner of the 2001 Heffter Award for Excellence in Research. Dr. Aghajanian is an outstanding senior neu- roscientist at Yale who for nearly three decades has re- searched how hallucinogens affect the actions of single neurons in the brain. His work exemplifies the quality of science that the Heffter Institute seeks to foster. We would also like to update you briefly on what’s happening at the Institute. Our program continues to develop with steady progress. The Heffter Research Center in Zurich has grown, and there are now eight people working there on the neuroscience of hallucinogens. Several clinical research programs are also ma- turing in the United States. Here are some highlights on the work in the US, followed by updates on the Swiss research: • Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Study: The first clinical research study with a hallucinogen in the United States in 30 years has just begun. We’ve funded a study led by Dr. Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona Medical School to look into whether psilocybin can be effi- cacious in the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). MAPS paid for the synthesis of the psilocybin and organized some staff training lectures and workshops. Several anec- dotal reports suggested that acute use of hallucinogens may lead to a pro- found reduction of symptoms. OCD is a relatively common condition, which appears to result from a serotonin dysfunction. Current treatment relies on the Prozac-like “selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI’s).” But these work well only for a relatively small percentage of patients.

Two important ques- tions will be addressed in this study: 1) do po- tent hallucinogens lead to an acute decrease in the symptoms of OCD?; and 2) if so, is a full hallucinogenic dose required to demonstrate sig- nificant reduction in the symptoms of OCD? The first patient was treated on November 27, 2001, (read Francisco Moreno’s article in this issue for a current update), and we look forward to some very interesting data in 2002. • Easing the Anxiety of Death: Early studies in the 1960s and 70s produced profoundly inter- esting results when hallucinogens were given to dying patients. An overwhelming majority of them gained benefit from the treatment. Anxi- ety was reduced, and for many, physical pain was diminished significantly. These results were a prime reason for my original motivation to start up the Heffter Institute, because they were the most well documented evidence of thera- peutic value for hallucinogens. We are on track to re-examine the early results with the best modern clinical techniques available.Dr. Charles Grob of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center has com- pleted the design phase of the study. The proto- col has been peer-reviewed, and has recently been submitted to the FDA. The study focuses on whether anxiety in the dying can be signifi- cantly reduced by the administration of psilocy- bin. Any attendant reduction in pain will also be measured. We hope to see the clinical phase begin in 2002. • Swiss Heffter Research Center: Professor Franz Vollenweider at the University of Zurich continues to build an extensive and elegant pro- gram of research into the nature of conscious- ness, using hallucinogens as research tools. He now has a team of eight people working with him on a series of co-ordinated studies. Let me mention two, so as to give a flavor of his work. Over the next few months the Swiss team will be carrying out a study on the effects of low dose psilocybin on memory in human subjects between 50 and 65 years of age. They should learn a good deal about the effects of seroton- ergic agents in facilitating memory in this popu- lation for whom measurable memory deficits are an everyday fact of life. This study will also be a foundation stone in the Swiss team’s long-term project of investigating how memory is used to construct the human sense of self. Moving to the clinical dimension, the Swiss team is in the process of developing a protocol to test psilo- cybin as a treatment for bulimia and binge eat- ing disorder. These body dysmorphic disorders may have an etiology similar to that of obses- sive compulsive disorder. The thought, there- fore, is that a serotonin agonist may also prove efficacious in their treatment. The design of this eating disorder study opens up the exciting pos- sibility of running clinical studies in Switzer- land in parallel with the powerful basic neuro- science studies that our Swiss colleagues are so adeptly carrying out.

She was sixty-six years old. Born in St. Louis, Missouri on April 26, 1935 into a conservative Baptist environment, Ro, as she was known to her friends, began her psychedelic journey long before her relationship with Dr. Timothy Leary. In the fifties, as one of the early seekers who prefigured America’s emerging counter-culture, she escaped to New York City at a tender age where she became part of the city’s most progressive music (jazz), art and literary (Beat) circles and experimented with psilocybin mushrooms and peyote. From here the course of events brought her to eventually become the ‘accomplice’ of the “most dangerous man in America”. The sheer number of psychedelic luminaries present at her memorial, held on April 20 in Santa Cruz, gave testimony to the fundamental role she played during the psychedelic revolution and beyond. Amongst them were Ralph Metzner, Frank Barron, Peggy Hitchcock, Robert Anton Wilson, Michael and Cindy Horowitz, Chet Helms and many others, including Ram Dass who was at By Martina Hoffmann (art@martinahoffmann.com) With Friends of Rosemary Woodruff Leary Rosemary Woodruff Lea ry Psychedelic Pioneer Photo credit: Robert Altman"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 her hospital bed. In the 50s and early 60s era, because of the pervasive sexism which obscured women’s intellectual contributions, women rebels were viewed mostly as being muses to their male coun- terparts. Rosemary Leary soon transcended this role by becoming Timothy Leary’s partner in creat- ing the setting which shaped LSD experimentation in its formative years. As he describes in Flashbacks: “Rosemary and I shared the work too. I was finishing the work of psychedelic poetry based on the Tao Te Ching. Rosemary edited the manuscript. She joined....me in preparing the slide shows and tapes we used in our weekend workshops in various cities around the East Coast. We tried to stimulate LSD experiences with sounds, strobes and slides, as Ralph, Michael and I alternated murmured narration and Yogic instructions while Rosemary whispered philosophic po- etry, hour upon hour, recapitulating the evolution of the species, taking our astounded partici- pants up the chakras of their bodies.” ( Flashbacks , pp. 232-3.) Her greatest contribution to the psychedelic movement was surely her consistent refusal to cooperate with Fed- eral Authorities. She received thirty days of solitary confine- ment for not testi- fying against Leary after G. Gordon Liddy busted Millbrook in 1966. Then she proceeded to orchestrate Leary’s escape from prison in 1970 with the aid of the Weather Underground and planned for their subsequent escape to Algeria. Most critically, that same year she refused an offer of amnesty from the FBI in exchange for providing names of others who had committed illegal acts in the name of freedom of consciousness. This selfless show of bravery was to define the course of her life. In her own words: “After escaping from Algeria, and suffering through yet another arrest and release in Switzerland, I left Leary, searching for a country that would allow me to find some peace and sanity. What followed were years of adventure and fear in some very far-flung places. I lived underground as a fugitive for twenty-four years in Europe and the Americas, long after Leary was captured again and eventually released from the US prison system.” Because of Rosemary Leary, many founding members of the psychedelic movement lived out their lives in freedom rather than jail cells. She paid a high price for the freedom of others: not until 1995 could she say, “I have regained my freedom and I am free again to write.” But she paid this price willingly because of what psychedelics had taught her: that there are truths more fundamental and significant than the laws of men intoxicated with power. “...there are truths more fundamental and significant than the laws of men intoxicated with power.”"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55 m a p s • v o l u m e x i i n u m b e r 2 • s u m m e r 2 0 0 2 Drawing It Out: Befriending the Unconscious A Contemporary Woman’s Psychedelic Journey The artist/author went through LSD psychotherapy in the 60’s, and ex- pressed this transformational journey in her art.

It adeptly navigates the canon of preced- ing research, answers many novel questions, and excavates much misinformation. The Complete Guide is packed with the confes- sions of 30 researchers who expertly opine on MDMA. In tandem they assert that “the judicious, supervised, and infrequent use of single oral does of MDMA as a psychiatric medicine may be a revolutionary tool to assist in the fields of psychology and psy- chiatry.” Each of the six sections triangulates a facet of MDMA re- search. The first section deals with the history, pharmacokinet- ics, and the molecular structure of MDMA. In the second section the latest findings on the toxicology of MDMA are presented in a reader-friendly manner. The subsequent sections deal with MDMA research, psychotherapy, culture and the role the molecule plays in clinical settings. Through The Complete Guide one can discover the legal and re- search status of MDMA internationally, the effects of MDMA on memory, the claims by clergy of the potential for MDMA to incite rapture, and much more. The Complete Guide displays the wide application of MDMA and the passionate conviction with which its use is supervised. Dr. Holland con- ducted interviews with Ann and Alexander Shulgin, Emanuel Sferios, Dr. George Greer, Dr. Andrew Weil, Dr. Charles Grob, Rabbi Zalman Schachter, and Rick Doblin, Ph.D. The manifold professions represented in the book speak well of both the exemplary scholarship directed at MDMA and the suppleness of this substance. “Pain control” is Dr. Holland’s goal. A psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital, she is adamant about harm-reduction in two forms. The Complete Guide intends to protect those who may hurt themselves through an abuse of MDMA and support the claim that MDMA is a safe and effective medicine for physical and mental pain. Dr. Holland hopes that The Complete Guide will be the “instruction manual” that will train and educate people in the beneficial use of this potent technology to remedy avoidable suffering. If a balance of rigor and compassion is an attribute of medical inquiry, then Dr. Holland of the NYU School of Medicine is an icon.

But because Dr. Holland advo- cates infrequent, efficiently dosed MDMA ses- sions in the treatment of specific illnesses, Baggott and Mendelson’s findings do not dis- credit the ideal forwarded by The Complete Guide . Reading The Complete Guide would be a particularly effective lesson for parents, teach- ers, and physicians who have been misinformed by 60 Minutes, Oprah, MTV and 20/20 . The Com- plete Guide has the potential to reform abusers of MDMA, educate the prejudiced, and stimu- late veteran entheonauts to further explore per- sonal dimensions. By educating the public and state representatives about the therapeutic po- tentials of MDMA to remedy post-traumatic stress disorder, pain, alienation, depression, spiritual bankruptcy, and schizophrenia, The Complete Guide may contribute to the reformation of MDMA laws and the dissolving of Ecstasy myths. When finished with the 450 pages it is pos- sible to re-taste that delicious fragment of the emotional center that MDMA awakens. After reading The Complete Guide , one gets the im- pression that this “soul-penicillin” should be used intentionally and infrequently. Ann Shulgin suggests that one should use MDMA no more then four times a year. Ralph Metzner and Sophia Adamson poetically examine the religious fla- vor of MDMA when used in sacred spaces. Dou- glas Rushkoff explores the links between cogni- tive enhancers, cultural fluorescence, and tribal consciousness.

MAPS is now focused primarily on assist- ing scientists to conduct human studies to generate essential information about the risks and psychothera- peutic benefits of MDMA, other psychedelics, and mari- juana, with the goal of eventually gaining governmental approval for their medical uses. MAPS MEMBERSHIP INFORMATION \"I've seen chronic pain disappear as a result of one session with Ecstasy (MDMA). I've seen allergies disappear. It gives you a chance to experience your body without the chronic tension that we normally impose on it. And although it doesn't teach you to maintain that, it shows you that it's possible and it can motivate you to find out how to make it happen...without the drug.\" - Dr. Andrew Weil ALBERT EINSTEIN WROTE: “ Imagination is more important than knowledge .” If you can even faintly imagine a cultural reintegration of the use of psychedelics and the states of mind they engender, please join MAPS in supporting the expansion of scientific knowledge in this area. Progress is possible with the support of individu- als who care enough to take individual and collective action. The MAPS Bulletin Each Bulletin will report on MAPS research in progress. In addition to reporting on research both in the United States and abroad, the Bulletin can include feature articles, reports on conferences, book reviews, Heffter Research Institute updates, and the Hofmann Report. Issues raised in letters, calls and e-mail from MAPS members may also be addressed, as may political developments that affect psychedelic research and usage.
