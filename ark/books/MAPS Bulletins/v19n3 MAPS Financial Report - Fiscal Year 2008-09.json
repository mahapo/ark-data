Detailed descriptions of most of our research, educational, operational, and capital expenditure line items follow this initial overview report. New for this year, we’re also reporting our actual expenses for FY 09-10 to date (as of October 31), projected expenses for the entire FY 09-10, and closing balance sheet projections under low, medium and high income scenarios. We’re also reporting expenses for FY 08-09 for our international series of MDMA/ PTSD pilot studies, along with projections for these studies for FY 09-10, FY 10-11, and FY 11-12 (see charts 6 & 7). These projections are forecasted to our next major transfor - mative milestone, which is our “End of Phase 2 Meeting” with the FDA and the Euro - pean Medicines Agency (EMEA) to plan our Phase 3 MDMA/PTSD multi-site studies. (Yes, we’re projecting well into 2012!). This multi-year overview of our MDMA/PTSD pilot studies enables us to more effectively communicate the big picture of our top prior - ity research area; we’ve projected expenditures–and need to obtain funding–for about $1.1 million on MDMA/PTSD research over the next three years. The future of MAPS’ research efforts is getting clearer than it’s ever been. We’ve matured to the point of using financial projection tools and we have preliminary data about the effect size and variability of MDMA/PTSD treatment outcomes from both our U.S. and Swiss studies. This doesn’t mean that we can tell how close our projections are going to come to reality. These projections are based on a web of assumptions that we are frequently updating according to new circumstances, some expected and some not. These projections are created to provide useful information for daily financial decision- making, such as designing the size of our new U.S. MDMA/PTSD pilot study for veter - ans of war. We will use these projections to make informed financial decisions in order to maximize progress toward our three-part mission, as recently updated by our Board of Directors: Our mission is, 1) to treat conditions for which conventional medicines provide limited relief—such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), pain, drug dependence, anxiety and depression associated with end-of-life issues—by developing psychedelics and marijuana into prescription medi - cines; 2) to cure many thousands of people by building a network of clinics where treatments can be provided; and 3) to educate the public honestly about the risks and benefits of psychedelics and marijuana. The funds that MAPS members donate to MAPS for our mission are the life-blood of our non-profit organization. This financial report will show you that we are efficiently transforming dollars into research, public education, social change, and evidence of cures. Overview FY 08-09 The big picture for FY 08-09 is that MAPS, like a great many other non-profit organi - zations in financially challenging FY 08-09, experienced a reduction in net assets (18%, or $187,000) as well as a reduction in overall income (29%, or $491,000) and expenses (4% or $53,000) from FY 07-08, which was a record year for MAPS in income, expenses and assets (see chart 1). As in all years past, we’re proud to report that no studies were slowed down due to lack of resources. MAPS’ income in FY 08-09 followed a familiar pattern. Of the donations from in - dividuals and family foundations, 85% of the total amount was from donations of over $1000, from about 44 donors. If you know of someone who might become one of our few donors who empower MAPS with gifts of $1000 or more, please let us know. The remaining 15% of the total amount of donations were from about 1,532 donors. These smaller donations provide an essential base of support that helps cover a substan - tial portion of our operating expenses."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 3 Rick Doblin, Ph.D. Psychedelic Research Overview In terms of our mission, FY 08-09 was our best year to date, MAPS gathered sub - stantially more data than ever before, and gained more experience designing, ob - taining approval for, funding, conducting, monitoring, and evaluating psychedelic psychotherapy clinical trials. Our primary achievement was completing the gather - ing of the data from our U.S. MDMA/ PTSD pilot study. Upon analysis, we found that the study was an outstanding success with statistically and clinically significant results. Dr. Mithoefer present - ed a poster about his results in November 2008, at the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS), the largest organization focused on research and treatment for PTSD. This was covered by CNN. In early June, just days into FY 09-10, he presented his results at the an - nual conference of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Liverpool, England. A TV news feature accompanied this on Chan - nel 4 in England. In October 2009, he presented his results at an international conference on PTSD in Jerusalem, Israel. We’re steadfastly working on a paper about our results for submission to a peer- reviewed scientific journal. We made substantial progress in our Swiss MDMA/PTSD studies, with the 12th of 12 subjects now being treated. We conducted a preliminary data analysis and found that after just nine patients, we were obtaining clinically and statistically significant results, though not to the ex - tent of the U.S. data. We obtained permis - sion for our Canadian study (though we are still waiting to get the approvals to import the MDMA from Switzerland for the study) and made progress toward our Jordanian study. Our Israeli study also moved forward, though slowed by signifi - cant challenges recruiting subjects. We also planned our first MDMA/ PTSD therapist training seminar, with therapists from seven countries, which took place in Austria one month into FY 09-10. Our Swiss LSD/end-of-life study moved forward into the fourth subject (now into the fifth), with a track record of safety and somewhat promising results. Due to serious recruitment challenges for our Swiss LSD/end-of-life study and the MDMA/cancer-anxiety study at Harvard that MAPS helped to start, and the outstanding results from our U.S. and Swiss MDMA/PTSD studies, MAPS’ Board of Directors decided to move for - ward with MDMA/PTSD as our primary drug development project. While our re- search with psychedelic-assisted psycho - therapy for anxiety related to end-of-life issues will move forward as rapidly as it can, the international series of MDMA/ PTSD Phase 2 pilot studies and results represent the most direct route for expan - sion to Phase 3 studies. As projected in Chart 7, we’ll need about $1.1 million and two to three years before we’re designing and pricing the Phase 3 studies. Marijuana Research Overview As can be seen by glancing at our FY 08-09 research expenditures for medical marijuana research, ($8,993 for helping Dr. Abrams recruit and pay for transpor - tation and lodging expenses for subjects from around the country coming to UCSF to enroll in his pain/opiates/marijuana study, and $27,125 for our Israeli medical marijuana projects), our medical mari - juana research expenses are minimal compared to our psychedelic research projects. Yet again, the DEA has been suc - cessful in its efforts to obstruct medical marijuana research. Dr. Abrams’ study was the last study in the U.S. of the medical use of plant marijuana in patients that I am aware of. The study was funded by the State of California’s Center For Medicinal Can - nabis Research (CMCR). His results are promising, showing that the administra - tion of marijuana can further reduce pain in patients using opiates for chronic pain and can reduce the amounts of opiates that are needed. Despite his promising findings his research is ending. In a few months, MAPS’ effort to end the federal monopoly on the supply of marijuana for research under the U.S. FDA will enter its 10th year. It was early 2000 when I started looking for a partner to apply to the DEA to grow medicinal marijuana for research. To all of our good fortune, Prof. Lyle Craker, UMass Amherst, was willing to be our cham - pion and turned out to be an even more effective advocate for medical marijuana science over politics than I could have Our primary achievement was completing the gathering of the data from our U.S. MDMA/PTSD pilot study."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 4 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 imagined. We’re currently waiting for Pres. Obama to appoint new leadership at the DEA. Only then might we be able to reverse the Bush-era DEA’s decision to block FDA drug development research at all costs. Watching the expansion of the number of states approving medical marijuana laws, and the growing public support for both medical marijuana and marijuana legalization in those states, I am curious if some of the DEA officials ponder whether it was really such a good idea for them to block the development of marijuana into an FDA-approved pre- scription medicine. Without a scientific drug development process available, states have been left no choice but to resort to making medical marijuana legal through legislation. Frustratingly, our 6-year struggle to purchase 10 grams of federal marijuana from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) for vaporizer research has ended unsuccessfully. The research laboratory we have been working with for all these years decided it wasn’t worth the effort to continue to negotiate with NIDA. For the foreseeable future, our vaporizer research project is on hold until we locate a new laboratory and find a new source of clinically available marijuana. In Israel, we’ve helped several Ministry of Health-licensed growers cover some of the costs of producing marijuana for Ministry-of-Health-licensed patients. The Ministry’s current policy is to permit the licensed growers to give medical mari - juana to patients for free on a compas- sionate basis, with sales forbidden. MAPS provided some support in the early stages for several producers who are planning to be able to be sustainable if the Minis - try approves sales to patients. However, the Ministry has yet to approve sales, and may not do so for some time, if at all. Fortunately, the producers MAPS helped have found a new strategy for survival. The producers have become for-profit or - ganizations with investors who speculate on possible profits if and when sales are permitted. MAPS has ceased donations to the for-profit Israeli medical marijuana producers. Our efforts in Israel have, for the moment, mostly come to an end. We are still trying to be of some assistance with medical marijuana research studies that may be conducted in Israel. MAPS FY 09-10 budget projects spending almost nothing on medical marijuana research. This will change substantially should the DEA decide to accept the February 12, 2007 recommen - dation of DEA Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner that it would be in the public interest for the DEA to issue a license to Prof. Craker to grow mari - juana for research. MAPS would fund Dr. Craker’s facility and use the marijuana produced for a renewed drug develop - ment effort for smoked and vaporized marijuana. The reality though is that this is not a likely outcome in the next few months. Detailed Expense Reports Research Projects - $514,054 MP-1 MDMA PTSD-US - $194,780 Our largest expenditure on research was for ongoing costs for MAPS’ pilot MDMA-assisted psychotherapy study, conducted in Charleston, South Carolina under the direction of Michael Mithoefer, M.D. and Annie Mithoefer, B.S.N. This study investigated MDMA-assisted psy - chotherapy in subjects with treatment- resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 21st and final subject completed the two-month follow-up in September 2008, concluding the study. Over the years, MAPS has spent approxi - mately $1.2 million on this study. The results of this study are so promising that it was worth every penny. We are now expanding our MDMA/PTSD research to new countries and therapeutic teams, testing different protocol modifications that will ultimately help us in fine-tun - ing the design of the Phase 3 studies. If other therapist teams can get results that are similar to the results obtained by Mi - chael and Annie, we will have sufficient evidence to justify the prescription use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. MP-2 MDMA PTSD-Swiss – $48,073 This item is for ongoing costs related to Peter Oehen M.D.’s MAPS-sponsored MDMA/PTSD study, which has contin - ued to enroll patients this year.

MP-4 MDMA/PTSD-Canada - $22,698 This item is for the protocol develop - ment of a new MAPS-sponsored MDMA/ PTSD study to take place in Vancouver, Canada, with co-therapists Ingrid Pacey M.D. (psychiatrist) and psychologist An - drew Feldmar M.A. A Canadian Institu - tional Review Board (IRB) has approved the study, as has Health Canada. We are currently working to obtain permits for importing the MDMA from Switzerland into Canada. When we obtain a full approval and start the study, it will be the first instance of psychedelic research conducted in Canada in the last 35 years. This study is designed for 12 subjects. MP-5 MDMA/PTSD-France - $2,513 These expenses are for a site visit by MAPS staffers Valerie Mojeiko and Josh Sonstroem, and for initial work on a draft protocol. The French psychiatrists inter - ested in conducting this study have not been able to obtain approval from their institution to submit the protocol to its ethics committee. This study is therefore blocked for the time being.

In 2002, Jose Carlos Bouso’s MAPS-sponsored MDMA/PTSD study was shut down due to political suppression of research. We are now starting the process to conduct a new MDMA/PTSD study in Spain. These expenses went toward bringing Jose Carlos and his potential co-therapist to our Austrian training seminar, and for minimal protocol design work for a grant application that has been submitted to a Span - ish charity. Announcements of successful grant applica - tions will be made in November 2009. MP-7 MDMA/PTSD-Jordan - $3,470 MAPS is working to start MDMA/PTSD research in Amman, Jordan, and we have received a restricted grant of $85,000 for all expenses related to this study. Our initial expenses are for a site visit and early protocol de- velopment work. We expect to obtain approval and start the study in early 2010. MP-8 MDMA/PTSD-US Veterans - $1,573 These expenses are for early protocol development work for our next U.S. MDMA/PTSD study, which will be exclusive to veterans of war with PTSD. There is a growing public concern over veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with serious and untreated PTSD. We believe that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will be able to help heal some of the trauma of war. MDMA Therapist Training - $9,769 MAPS is developing a training program for therapists who we will hire to conduct our Phase 3 research into MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. These costs are for training-program development, which includes evalu - ating and learning from therapists currently conducting MDMA/PTSD studies for MAPS. We’ve found that one of the most effective training tools is analyzing videotapes of actual MDMA/PTSD therapy sessions. MDMA Literature Review - $3,343 MAPS research specialist Ilsa Jerome, Ph.D. is respon - sible for keeping current on the state of the world’s scien - tific, peer-reviewed literature on MDMA. She continued this ongoing review throughout FY 08-09. When ap - plying to the FDA and institutional review boards with a new protocol, it is necessary to have a comprehensive review of all factors related to risk. This literature review is becoming less expensive each year due to the relatively settled state of MDMA research, with the research gener - ating relatively few changes in the risk-benefit estimates. MDMA Research General - $2,234 These are general expenditures in support of our MDMA research efforts that benefit multiple projects. MDMA National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Grant - $641 This year, MAPS didn’t submit an NIMH grant re- quest for funding to develop our treatment manual, even though developing a treatment manual is among our top priorities. Rather, we have focused on completing our U.S. MDMA/PTSD study and our Swiss MDMA/PTSD study so that we would be able to submit solid pilot data as part of our eventual grant application to the NIMH. MDMA/PTSD Researcher Retreat - $7,236 MAPS held its first MDMA/PTSD therapist training seminar in June 2009, with therapists attending from 7 different countries. This training program was a great success and allowed the researchers from our ongo - ing and planned studies to discuss MAPS’ therapeutic method and treatment manual together. This gathering was inspirational, as we are seeing the development of a new field of psychotherapy for PTSD. LDA-1 LSD Swiss End-of-Life Study - $77,045 MAPS worked with Peter Gasser, M.D., a Swiss psy - chiatrist, on the protocol development and approval pro - cess for a pilot study investigating the safety and efficacy of LSD-assisted psychotherapy in reducing anxiety and pain in patients with end-of-life diagnoses. The study gained approval and treated its fourth subject in this fiscal year. When completed, this will become the first study of the therapeutic use of LSD in over 35 years. Psilocybin/Cancer Anxiety Study (Miami) - $1,027 This item is for the protocol development and ap - proval process for a study of psilocybin-assisted therapy in patients with advanced-stage melanoma cancer and anxiety. Sameet Kumar, Ph.D. will conduct the study. The FDA has approved the protocol, but we are still seeking an institution in southern Florida willing to host the study and have its IRB review the protocol. There is no estimated start date for this study at this time. Ayahuasca Integration Study (Grant) - $2,250 MAPS is acting as fiscal sponsor for this study. Univ. of Bristol Drug Usage Survey (Grant) - $1,000 MAPS is also acting as fiscal sponsor for this study. Ibogaine Canada - $478 MAPS was sponsoring a study of the long-term ef - fectiveness of Ibogaine-assisted therapy in the treatment of opiate addiction. This study was located in Vancou - ver, Canada with patients treated at the Iboga Therapy House. Funds were used for enrollment and follow-up for five subjects. Unfortunately, the Iboga Therapy House had to shut its doors for financial reasons and our study has thus ended prematurely. Fortunately, this study has led us to investigate another ibogaine outcome study in Mexico. The Canadian ibogaine study has also helped in - troduce us to therapists in Vancouver with whom we are working to start our aforementioned Canadian MDMA/ PTSD study."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 12 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 Ibogaine Mexico - $9,638 MAPS is sponsoring a study of the long-term effec - tiveness of ibogaine-assisted therapy in the treatment of opiate addiction. This study, located in Mexico, follows patients treated at Pangaea Biomedics. Funds were used for protocol development, training, and the approval process, as well as the actual conduct of the study. Clusterbusters Research - $59,798 MAPS donated some funds that it received from clus - ter headache sufferers back to Clusterbusters, which is a group of people who suffer from cluster headaches and have found psilocybin and LSD to be effective in treating their headaches. Clinical Research General - $13,384 These are expenses for our clinical research that are for all studies. We’ve chosen not to allocate a share of these expenses across all of our research projects but rather to create this special category. MJ Production Facility/UMass Amherst - $70 This fiscal year, MAPS spent almost nothing on a sign-on letter since we were waiting on the Drug En - forcement Agency (DEA) to reply to the February 12, 2007, DEA administrative law judge Mary Ellen Bittner’s findings of fact and recommendation in the case of Prof. Lyle Craker. ALJ Bittner recommended that the DEA issue a license to Prof. Craker for a MAPS-sponsored medical marijuana production facility, which would end the federal monopoly on the supply of marijuana legal for research purposes. The licensing of Prof. Craker would catalyze a serious drug development research program, which is what the DEA is seeking to prevent. After the ALJ ruling, MAPS initiated a major effort to educate members of the U.S. House of Representatives on the ALJ Bittner recommendation. We obtained signatures of 45 congressional representatives on a letter to the DEA urg - ing it to accept the ALJ Bittner recommendation. We also obtained written support from senators Kennedy and Kerry, who sent a letter to the DEA urging it to accept the ALJ Bittner recommendation. On January 14, 2009, the DEA issued what it hoped was a final ruling rejecting the ALJ Bittner recommendation. In this final ruling, the DEA cited new evidence to justify its rejection. The DEA cited evidence that was misleading or in error and which had not been reviewed by Prof. Craker’s legal team. As a result, Prof. Craker’s lawyers have filed a series of requests for reconsideration, delaying the DEA final order from going into effect. There is a reasonable chance that the DEA under an Obama administration will put science first and issue Prof. Craker his license. As of November 2009, Pres. Obama has not yet nominated new leadership for the DEA, which is still run by Bush administration holdovers. If new leadership is appointed and decides to accept the ALJ Bittner recommendation, the controversy over the medical use of marijuana will be decided by the outcome of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sanctioned research. Funds for our congressional educational campaign were donated to MAPS by board member John Gilmore. Dr. Abrams Marijuana Study UCSF - $8,993 Donald Abrams, M.D. is one of a few researchers in the U.S. evaluating the medical use of smoked or vapor - ized marijuana used in conjunction with pain medi - cations in a patient population. MAPS donated staff time and resources to assist with travel and lodging for patients in Dr. Abrams’ study. MAPS helped find the remaining patients for this study, which has been com - pleted and has generated promising results. Israel Medical Marijuana Production Facility - $27,125 The Israeli Ministry of Health has established a policy whereby physicians whose patients have any of a certain limited number of clinical conditions can apply to the ministry requesting that their patient receive a license to use marijuana legally. Since there was no legal supply of marijuana in Israel, the Ministry of Health decided to issue several licenses to produce marijuana for min - istry-approved patients. The license does not permit the producer to sell the marijuana, thus it requires that the marijuana be given away for free. The producers must ob - tain donations to cover their costs. An anonymous donor donated funds to MAPS in order to help subsidize the costs of several growers. Over time, as more patients are approved and subsequently obtain medical benefits from medical marijuana, we think the ministry may reconsid - er the policy of free distribution and permit sales which would be a sustainable model of marijuana distribution. MAPS also brought medical marijuana production and distribution experts, Mike Corral, Val Corral and Mimi Peleg to Israel to consult. MAPS Core Educational Projects - $115,992 MAPS’ educational projects are a key part of our mis - sion. In this financial report we’ve separated MAPS’ core educational projects from the projects for which we are acting as fiscal sponsor for other organizations, such as Erowid, Entheon Village at Burning Man, etc. See Chart #4 for this information. Book - LSD: My Problem Child - $13,817 These expenses were for our publication of the new edition of Albert Hofmann’s “LSD-My Problem Child.” Book - Ayahuasca Religions: A Bibliography and Critical Essays - $7,413 These expenses are for the publication of our first book about Ayahuasca, written by Beatriz Caiuby Labate, Isabel Santana de Rose, and Rafael Guimarães dos Santos. CME Project - $4,447 MAPS is organizing a Continuing Medical Education (CME) conference for physicians, medical and therapeu - tic professionals and the general public about the latest findings from clinical research with psychedelics. This will be an international conference that we will hold in San Jose, California, April 15-18, 2010. Funds were spent"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 13 on staff time for choosing a conference location, obtain - ing CME accreditation, presentation planning, marketing and other administrative matters. MAPS/Dogstar Catering Psychedelicatessen - $7,445 MAPS hired Dogstar Catering to cater several ben - efit functions this fiscal year. The expenses shown here reflect the costs of food and staff time. WWDPE (Difficult Trip Video) - $3,196 MAPS has created an educational video as part of our efforts to prevent a backlash against psychedelic research due to tragedies caused by people having difficult psyche- delic experiences that they are not prepared to handle. Our video presents information explaining how someone can help a friend who is having a difficult psychedelic experience. We created the video in prior fiscal years and these expenditures went toward creating a newer version in this current fiscal year. MAPS Monthly Email Newsletter - $8,273 Each month we send out an electronic newsletter to update our readers about our research projects and other matters of interest to MAPS members and friends. These newsletters take approximately 20 hours of staff time each month. MAPS Bulletin - $55,438 We use our Bulletin as a key educational tool. We take special care to make the Bulletin a magazine that people can proudly show to others. Bulletin costs have been partially subsidized by using the color covers as an op - portunity to display art for sale through the MAPS store. The Bulletin comes out 3 times a year and focuses mostly on articles about MAPS’ various projects with occasional themed issues related in some way to psychedelics. Our themed issue in early 2009 was about psychedelics and ecology. In order to save funds we are sending out smaller issues and will have just one special themed issue per year. In early 2010, we’ll focus on psychedelics, death, and dying. We’re expanding our communications with members through our website and email updates. William Westerfield House Fundraiser SF - $4,308 These expenses were for a successful fundraising event in San Francisco. Burning Man Zendo/Teepee 2008 - $5,000 MAPS received a $5000 restricted grant to cover expenses involved in setting up a zendo and teepee at Entheon Village. These facilities are part of our harm reduction efforts and educational efforts. Conferences and Summer Festivals - $6,655 MAPS member Seth Hollub donated $5,000 to help MAPS set up tables at a number of summer festivals, both for educational and member outreach purposes. Educational Projects Fiscal Sponsorship - $283,187 Basura Segrada (Burning Man) 2008 - $90,694 MAPS served as fiscal sponsor for a team of artists who built, and then burned, the temple structure at Burning Man 2008. The temple structure at Burning Man is a place where people traditionally reflect on loved ones who have died. The ceremony is in a meditative location that offers people the opportunity to experience and express somber and serious emotions--in contrast to the often carnival-like mood elsewhere at the festival. The temple structure offers people a supportive place to experience emotions and therefore adds an important, grounded “harm reduction” element that, in combination with the sanctuary space, makes Burning Man a more psychologically-balanced and healthy environment. Entheon Village (Burning Man) 2008 - $171,387 MAPS handled funds for Entheon Village 2008, which we first helped to create at Burning Man 2006, where we held MAPS’ 20th anniversary. Expenses of Entheon Village were covered by registration fees, for which people did not receive tax receipts as their fees were not a donation but went toward services provided. MAPS organized a lecture series about psychedelic research and culture as part of our educational mission. Participation in Entheon Village helped MAPS fulfill our community outreach goals. Women’s Visionary Congress - $2,968 Organized by Annie Harrison, MAPS was a fiscal sponsor for the first Women’s Visionary Congress, which took place in the summer of 2007. The conference sought to provide a gathering place for women in the psyche- delic movement, providing them with networking and speaking opportunities that are frequently absent or minimal at other psychedelic-related conferences. MAPS also fiscally sponsored the Women’s Entheogen Fund, which supports women who made significant contribu - tions to the psychedelic movement. Annie Harrison and advisors determined allocations. In preparation for the 2008 Women’s Visionary Congress, Annie Harrison created a new non-profit to sponsor the event and the Women’s Entheogen Fund. Women’s Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM) - $1,870 Valerie Corral co-founded WAMM. She has been involved in litigation with the DEA about her medical marijuana cooperative production facility. This grant from MAPS was for her public education efforts. Website EROWID - $16,268 MAPS has served as fiscal sponsor for Erowid since 1999. Erowid is the most popular website of its kind, offering information on a wide range of drugs. It receives roughly 50,000 unique visitors per day. Erowid has now"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 14 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 obtained its own non-profit status and thus MAPS is no longer needed as a fiscal sponsor. However, some donors still send funds to MAPS for Erowid either out of habit or as part of employer matching programs that take time to change. As a result, we still receive some donations for Erowid. Staff Salaries, Benefits & Other Related Direct Expenses All of our groundbreaking research would not be pos - sible without our dedicated core staff. Our main office, located in Santa Cruz, currently employs four full-time staff, two part-time staff and several occasional tempo - rary employees on a project basis throughout the year. MAPS strives to provide a fair and competitive salary and to offer a basic benefit package including healthcare and dental insurance. The gross salary for core staff and contractors attributed to operations in the Santa Cruz office in FY 08-09 was $173,352.94, with benefits and payroll taxes costing MAPS $56,826.08. (These numbers differ from what is seen in Chart 5, because staff salaries are allocated across various projects). In addition, MAPS Executive Director Rick Doblin, Ph.D., earns a total sal - ary of $60,000 per year. Operational Expenses MAPS’ operational expenses are broken out in a series of detailed line items. In these challenging financial times, we’re looking closely at our operational expenses for opportunities to save money without reducing our ability to work toward our mission. One key expense that we’ve identified as ripe for savings is the cost of the MAPS Bulletin. In FY 08-09, we spent $55,000 on the MAPS Bulletin. We’re moving toward two smaller issues and one special themed issue per year. We’re empha - sizing our electronic communications, which have the advantages of speed and economy. We’re still going to produce a beautiful, thoughtful themed issue each year. In April 2010 we will publish a Bulletin about psyche- delics, death and dying, edited by David Jay Brown. MAPS has an ambitious agenda of research and educational projects that we are privileged to work for as a result of donations provided by our members. Our staff work exceptionally hard for competitive salary and benefit packages in the non-profit sector. I’m the major exception, with my below-market salary of $60,000 and no benefits (our family’s health care is provided by my wife through her job). Every day I wake up working for MAPS is such personal satisfaction. However, it is our organizational goal to grow MAPS’ income so that myself and the other MAPS staff can receive appropri - ate compensation commensurate with all of our growing skills and experience. Income Projections for FY 09-10 and Beyond: New Angels Needed MAPS’ success can be traced in large part to the substantial, multi-year donations of unrestricted funds for operational expenses from MAPS Board Members John Gilmore and Ashawna Hailey and to the multiple, $250,000 donations for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy research from Peter Lewis. New Board member Robert Barnhart’s targeted donations for our Swiss LSD/end- of-life study, and other projects, have made the renewal of LSD psychotherapy research possible. Their generous contributions over the years have enabled me to focus more of my attention on MAPS’ mission itself. Their generosity has empowered me to hire staff so we could expand our organizational capacity. MAPS would be a much different and less effective organization without the key support from these three individuals over the years. In FY 09-10, John has already donated $200,000 to MAPS. Ten years ago, John decided to donate $1 million a year for 10 years to try to hasten the end of the Drug War. Earlier this year, he said that among his successes were helping the medical marijuana and medical psyche- delic movements make more progress than they would have otherwise. As a result, he increased his donation to MAPS from $150,000 last year to $200,000 this year. However, FY 09-10 is John’s 10th and final year of his awesome philanthropic effort. John will be staying on MAPS’ Board to share his probing approach to strategiz - ing and contributing his wisdom, which, as the Master - card ads pronounce, is “priceless.” In order for MAPS to meet the challenges of our ex - panding research agenda in the years ahead, we’re going to need to find one or more new angels who will donate generously. If any of our members could arrange for me to meet with potential angels, I’d travel anywhere in the world to meet with them. Meanwhile, every donation helps whatever the amount. These are times of extraor - dinary opportunity. With the combined efforts of MAPS staff, MAPS donors and MAPS volunteers, we can make a unique and valuable contribution to our culture through the mainstreaming of psychedelics and the states of con - sciousness they catalyze. We will accomplish this, not a moment too soon.

We conducted our first database audit on the weekend of October 17-18, 2009 and we passed this audit with an acceptable error rate of .425%. The pharmaceutical indus - try standard is .5%. This level of precision ensures that we do not report any false results due to incorrect data entry, and it creates an auditable trail in case the FDA decides to inspect our records. MAPS Executive Director Rick Dob - lin, Ph.D. said of our flagship study, “It generated remarkably strong results. If we can replicate these results in our other studies, we can obtain approval by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for the prescription use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD.” In Switzerland, Peter Oehen, M.D. and Verena Widmer, R.N. have finished enrollment for their MDMA/PTSD study and are currently treating the 12th of 12 subjects. Back at MAPS headquarters, we have created a database for this study and are currently testing it. We plan to begin data entry for this study in February after our monitoring team conducts a visit to collect the study data. Also in Switzerland, our study inves - MAPS Research: A Year in Review By: Valerie Mojeiko, Deputy Director tigating LSD-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening illnesses has continued to enroll subjects. We hope to pass the halfway point of the treat - ment phase in 2010. The study has been receiving excellent media attention with articles in Der Spiegel and the Guardian. We have been looking at all of our protocols with an eye toward ways to save money. With that in mind, we have removed some outcome measures that we determined were redundant, and we streamlined the materials given to the study sites for data collection. This will save us time and money conducting our studies and then again when we bring the data into our office to be monitored and entered into our database. One of the largest costs for our studies is the therapists’ time. Our psychotherapy model is very time intensive, with two professionals (one of them a medical doctor) spending eight hours or more with the patient during the experimen - tal sessions with MDMA or placebo. We are exploring a new money-saving idea, utilizing a trainee or psychology intern as the study co-therapist, who is willing to work on a volunteer basis in exchange for the experience. We are considering testing this model out for the first time in Jordan, and if it is successful, we may adopt this model for our Phase 3 multi- site studies. In September, we hired two outside contract research organizations (CROs)— In the past year , we have greatly increased our capacity for designing, implementing, and monitoring MAPS’ clinical trials around the world. We have learned that there is much work to be done even after a study is finished treating patients and the raw data arrives at our headquarters. As the end of the year draws to a close, I’d like to review some of the high- lights of the past year, and give you a preview of the year to come in our clinical research department.

We hope that the difficulty of working with a 10-hour time zone difference and of monitor - ing study materials that are in Hebrew and Arabic (both of which not only use different alphabets than English but are read from right to left instead of left to right) will be greatly reduced by employ - ing these CROs, which are each based in the study’s respective country. “We’re also seeing that our local CROs are helping us to understand cultural differences that we would oth - erwise have not noticed, so that we can proceed in a more sensitive manner,” said Rick. “Our international CRO’s work will free up more of MAPS’ clini - cal research staff time, since monitoring studies in the Middle East from our base in Santa Cruz is quite a challenge. This will leave us focused on the primary challenges of protocol design, regulatory approval, locating and training therapist teams, helping to recruit subjects, and fundraising.” On the Horizon for 2010 We are excited to start several new studies in 2010. In the U.S., we are working with Michael Mithoefer, M.D. and Annie Mithoefer, B.S.N. on two new studies in Charleston, South Carolina. We will be expanding on their previous PTSD study with a similar study that will be exclu - sively for veterans of war. Their previ - ous study had enrolled 2 veterans out of a total of 21 survivors of other causes of PTSD (mostly physical and sexual assault). This new protocol will test what is called a “three-arm design” with subjects randomized to low, medium or high doses of MDMA. This may become the study design we use in our Phase 3 multisite studies since we expect it will produce a successful double-blind with the therapists and subject being less certain of which dose they received. The Mithoefers will also be spear - heading an optional part of our standard therapist training program for our other co-therapist teams, under a protocol for which FDA has given us permission to proceed. The protocol will allow the Mithoefers to administer one MDMA session to therapists as part of their preparation for administering MDMA to PTSD subjects in our research protocols. This protocol is designed simultaneously to collect information on the psychologi - cal effects of MDMA in healthy volun - teers who are administered one full dose of MDMA, and to provide an MDMA experience to therapists. Enrollment is limited to therapists who have complet - ed our training program, which consists primarily of analysis of videos of actual MDMA/PTSD therapy sessions and critical discussions about our treatment manual and therapeutic method. At the time of this writing, it looks as if we will begin recruitment in the early part of 2010 for a new MDMA/ PTSD study in Vancouver, BC conducted by psychiatrist Ingrid Pacey, M.D. and therapist Andrew Feldmar, M.A. On October 24, 2009, we hosted a benefit in Vancouver to kick off the start of FDA Clinical Trials Sponsored by MAPS Drug Condition Location Principal investigator Status MDMA PTSD Charleston M.

We expect the study to cost $320,000 over two to three years. In Jordan, our CRO is helping us to finalize the protocol and study materials before submission to regulatory agencies. We are looking forward to the challenge that this particular study will likely pres- ent, given that the two therapists con - ducting it are completely new to the idea of psychedelic psychotherapy and due to the study taking place in a culture much different than our own. “I must say, I was impressed by the people and facilities there,” said MAPS Medical Monitor Dr. Mithoefer, M.D. EARLY a decade since we started our struggle to break the federal govern- ment’s monopoly on the supply of mari - juana for research, the U.S. DEA’s strategy of delay continues to be successful and our efforts continue to leave us frustrated. On February 12, 2007, after extensive testi - mony, DEA Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Mary Ellen Bittner wrote an 87-page ruling finding that it would be in the public interest for the DEA to issue a license to Prof. Lyle Craker, UMass Amherst, to grow marijuana for MAPS-sponsored research. However, the DEA’s ALJ only issues recommenda - tions to the DEA Administrator. On January 14, 2009, after almost two years of delay and just six days before President Obama’s inauguration, the DEA issued a “Final Order” rejecting the recommendation and refusing to issue Prof. Craker a license. Due to some expert pro-bono legal work from the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project and DC law firm Jenner & Block, we’ve challenged DEA’s “Fi - nal Order” and entered a “Motion to Recon- sider”, which the DEA has not responded to at the time this went to press, months after the “Motion to Reconsider” was entered. On the one hand, we see the wisdom in wait - ing for a response to our “Motion to Recon- sider” until after the Obama administration appoints new leadership at the DEA. On the other hand, we are deeply disappointed by the delay of justice and the DEA’s obstruc - tion of studying marijuana’s medicinal risks and benefits. Meanwhile, the DEA’s rejec - tion of medical marijuana research is provid - ing yet more motivation for additional states to move toward approving the medical use of marijuana, since the FDA drug develop - ment route is closed.

We are excited to begin this study in 2010. We now believe that once the MDMA/ PTSD studies that are currently underway or in development are completed, we will have enough data to submit to the U.S. FDA for our End-of-Phase 2 meeting. If this meeting goes well, our next stud - ies will be part of our Phase 3 multi-site trials -- the final round of studies in the quest to put MDMA back into the hands of therapists. • Struggle Continues to Resume Marijuana Research"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 18 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 This coming Spring MAPS will achieve one of our longstanding ambitions by host - ing a continuing medical education (CME) conference -“Psychedelic Science in the 21st Century.” This will be the preeminent conference on psychedelic research and psychedelic psychotherapy. As the largest conference dedicated to psychedelic science in the U.S. in 17 years, “Psychedelic Sci - ence” welcomes physicians, other medical and therapeutic professionals (psychologists, nurses, physician assistants, social workers, etc.) and anyone with an interest in psyche- delics. “Psychedelic Science” is planned in ac - cordance with our mission to “...educate the public honestly about the risks and ben - efits of psychedelics...” All participants are welcome to attend the continuing medical education presentations, where physicians and ancillary medical professionals can earn CME/CE credits. There will also be a concurrent non- CME psychotherapy and cultural track with some fantas - tic presenters, such as Alex and Allyson Grey, Earth and Fire Erowid, Ralph Metzner, Ph.D., and numerous others. The non-CME track will include panels, roundtables, and poster presentations about a variety of psychedelic related topics, as well as a “rising researcher” panel to showcase the work of newcomers in the field. When this article went to press, our conference committee was re- viewing proposal submissions and we plan to announce additional speakers in the psychotherapy and cultural track in late 2009. The conference will bring researchers from across the United States and from England, Canada, Germany, Israel, Jordan, and Switzerland. As far as we are aware, we have a representative from every ongo - ing project that is legally administering psychedelics to human subjects in clinical research. This effort would not be possible without the collaboration of our sister organizations the Heffter Institute, the Beckley Founda - tion, and the Council for Spiritual Practices.

This accreditation is only possible because of the ever-expanding body of current scientific literature that has been compiled over the past several years. “Psychedelic Science” will add new credence to psychedelic research and the untapped healing potential of psychedelic psychotherapy. Potentially hundreds of medical professionals will leave the confer - ence with a better understanding of the value of psychedelic research and the po - tentials of psychedelic psychotherapy. They will share their newfound knowledge with their colleagues and our goal of “...building a network of clinics where treatments can be provided...” will be an evolutionary leap closer to manifestation. Opening Doorways to New Research and Greater Funding An added benefit of “Psychedelic Science” will be to increase the likelihood of receiving major funding for future research. Showcasing the state of the art of psychedelic research will hopefully energize new phi - lanthropists and foundations to support us, our sister or - ganizations and other researchers entering the field. This will be a unique collaborative opportunity for current and future scientists, therapists, and philanthropists. We believe that when we put so many great minds together under one roof, progress is inevitable. It gives us great pleasure to be able to build a confer - ence that will bring together people from around the world. We purposely chose a conference location that is conducive for attendees to network with one another. We hope to hear stories down the road that at the confer - ence great new research projects were incubated, pro - found friendships were started, and romances that were sparked blossomed into lifelong partnerships."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 19 Randolph Hencken, M.A. MAPS Communication and Marketing Director, Conference Coordinator Randolph@maps.org Registration for Psychedelic Science in the 21st Century is available through the MAPS webstore at www.maps.org/conference.

Maybe you’ve been a die-hard, dues-paying member since ’86, or maybe a friend passed this Bulletin along because they thought the pages within would be of interest to you. Whether your Bulletin was delivered through the mail from our dedi- cated staff at MAPS headquar- ters or it was passed along to you at a conference by one of our volunteers, at some point there was a personal exchange. I believe these personal exchanges are what MAPS is built upon. The person who handed you this Bulletin is setting up the building blocks necessary to open the way for psy- chedelic psychotherapy to become available as a prescription medicine for those in need. MAPS is one of the leading orga- nizations working to find a place for psychedelics in society through rigorous clinical research examining their therapeutic applications. With our goal to turn psychedelics into prescrip- tion medications to be used in safe and legal therapeutic con- texts, it is likely that we will need more than just the science to overcome the misinformation and fear so prevalent in our culture around psychedelics. If we are to succeed, we will need each of you to stand with us to re-educate friends, co-workers, and family members on the potential therapeutic applications-- and the potential risks--of these extraordinary tools. With the advent of social networking sites, MAPS has begun several campaigns to increase our presence in the world of “web 2.0”. The idea of web 2.0 is to allow individual Inter- net users to take ownership of what is posted to the web. The beauty of web 2.0 sites is that many of these sites are built to facilitate cross-posting, commenting, and sharing--vital ele- ments of dialogue--not just between strangers but between friends, family, fellow students, and colleagues. While some Twitter users have been known to post updates regarding what they’ve eaten for breakfast, MAPS’ accounts on Facebook, Mys- pace, Twitter, Tribe, Evolver, and Youtube are being continu- ously updated to reflect the psychedelic knowledge renaissance, and the sharing of information indicative of this growing para- digm. We post recent news articles, videos, podcasts, and more. Get started by becoming a “Fan” on Facebook and engaging others in conversation on the Fan Page. Join our “Cause” on Fa- cebook and post it to your profile to show your friends that you care about psychedelic therapy. Follow MAPS on Twitter, and re-tweet (re-post) the information to your own Twitter feed. Regardless of your inclinations to online social network- ing, I encourage you to continue to have these conversations in real life just the same! The idea is that by quoting, citing, or inviting others to view MAPS postings online, you might use one of these topics as an icebreaker to start a conversation about psychedelic therapy. If someone notices you made a post on the latest MAPS fundraising drive, engage them and explain why MAPS’ goals, research, and medicines-in-development are important to you. (One thing that I must mention as I encour- age you to utilize social networking is this: many of these sites do in fact “own” the content you post, so don’t post anything that you wouldn’t want the world to see.) Another venue MAPS has been exploring to foster the sharing of information is running outreach tables at music fes- tivals and conferences. Tables help to support MAPS financially by bringing in donations for books, clothing, and memberships. They also serve to educate people–many of whom have first- hand experience with psychedelics– with informational bro- chures, Bulletins, and a miniature psychedelic library. Like the information shared on our social networking sites, the infor- mation given at the table functions as an incredible contextual reference point for attendees of these events to think of as they go about their weekend. Nothing is better than when someone comes up to the booth that believes LSD stays in your spinal cord for 10 years (false), and walks away having learned about MAPS’ study testing the efficacy of LSD-assisted psychotherapy to alleviate anxiety and depression associated with life-threat- ening illness (true). Replacing outlandish rumors with facts is something all of us can do to reduce negative stigmas around psychedelics. You don’t even need to be tabling at an event for MAPS to do it! I encourage you to “know your source” in the realm of information dealing. In doing so, you might even get the op- portunity to become a credible source of information yourself. So next time someone tells you that Ecstasy “puts holes in your brain,” what can you do? Try referring them to Peter Jennings’ “Ecstasy Rising” (available in MAPS’ online store), which refutes the fraudulent Ricaurte research this rumor is based upon. Even if you don’t go and sign up for a Twitter account when you put this Bulletin down, or I never run into you from the other side of a MAPS table, I hope to have left you with some inspiration to have these conversations in your day-to- day life. You can help pave the way for MDMA, LSD, and other psychedelics to be made into prescription medicines to be used safely, legally, and therapeutically--by sharing this Bulletin with a friend or family member today.

It exists somewhere between the sterile objectivity of clinical psychopharmacology and the passionate creativity of psychedelic counterculture. This strange combination of science and spirituality means that it’s equally at home at academic conferences and music festivals, allowing it to reach all kinds of people in all kinds of places. Reaching across disciplines and making unexpected connec- tions between radically different ways of knowing and being in the world, MAPS and its supporters are making something new. I must have sensed this when I first con- tacted MAPS about the possibility of helping them out over the summer. I was looking for a way to put my writing (such as it was) to use, and there was something about their confi- dent hybridity that pulled me in. I had studied psychology in college, and was somewhat familiar with the meticulous and painstaking process of designing and running clinical re- search studies. But of course there was much more to it than that. My own experiences with psychedelics had been among the most personally transformative and deeply thera- peutic moments I had ever had, and they had shown me how immensely powerful—and, yes, potentially dangerous—such experiences could be. In a famous lecture, philosopher Alan Watts divided the world into two kinds of people. On one hand, there are “prickly” people who insist on there being a precise form and structure to the world and who refuse to budge until all the facts are known. “The prickly people,” Watts observed, “are ad- vocates of intellectual porcupinism: they want rigor, they want precise statistics, and they have a certain clipped attitude in their voices. And you know this very well in academic circles, where there are people who are always edgy like that. And they accuse other people of being disgustingly vague and miasmic and mystical.” Well, I happen to be one of those spiny individuals. I am fascinated by catego- ries, definitions, and differences; and I admire science for its persistent attempts to make sense out of the world. Of course, science to- day has its own problems—money, prejudice, and laziness too often determine what gets examined and what gets left out. Knowledge and politics, it seems, are inseparable in the modern world. Of Prickles and Goo: How MAPS is redefining the science of spirituality Brad Burge, M.A. Ph.D. student, University of California, San Diego, MAPS Intern bburge@ucsd.edu Like any tool, science can be used for good as well as for evil. MAPS proudly acknowledges that it uses the language of statistics and clinical psychiatry to prove a point—not that psychedelics by themselves are a “cure” for anything or that they should be freely available to everyone or even that they are without risk. What MAPS does want to prove is that to exclude certain kinds of research out of fear, to willfully ignore certain ways of thinking about the world simply because they challenge our assumptions, is completely unacceptable and fundamentally detrimental to our health, our society, and our survival as human beings. When it comes to politics, MAPS knows who to call and how to work with them. And when it comes to science, MAPS insists on getting the details right and making sure that everything goes as planned (if you’ve ever read one of their research protocols, you’ll know just what I mean). This is MAPS at its most prickly. Of course, there’s more to the story. Once again, Watts keeps us moving: “But the vague, miasmic, and mystical people accuse the prickly people of being mere skeletons with no flesh on their bones. And they say, ‘You just rattle. You’re not really a human being. You know the words but you don’t know the music.’” These, he tells us, are the “gooey” people. Well, I happen to be one of those people, too. Isn’t science a tool like any other? Of what use are our efforts to understand the world if we don’t have some idea of what we would like to do with it? Call me miasmic, but I’m pretty sure that without a little bit of art and a little bit of music, science is downright boring. This creative restlessness, this perpetual discomfort with static categories, is exactly what sets MAPS apart from other research organizations. What MAPS wants to do is not so much to erase the line between spiritual growth and psychotherapeutic treatment as to point out that there may not have ever been a difference in the first place. After all, what is it that we’re trying to accomplish with all the money and research that we pour into psychiatry and pharmaceutical research? What MAPS does want to prove is that to exclude certain kinds of research out of fear, to willfully ignore certain ways of thinking about the world simply because they challenge our assumptions, is completely unacceptable and fundamentally detrimental to our health, our society, and our survival as human beings."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 23 Why spend billions of dollars and years of work developing new drugs and new treat- ments that may or may not work, and that ultimately end up benefiting only those who make and sell them? MAPS recognizes that the goal of all this is simply to make us hap- pier and healthier human beings, and that in order to accomplish this we may need to look in unexpected places. MAPS knows that science cannot always provide the answers to our most difficult and enduring questions. A person struggling to overcome posttraumatic stress or a person engaged in a life-or-death battle with opiate addiction needs much more than a drug. MAPS is at the center of a closely connected and deeply caring network of artists, sages, shamans, students, professionals, musicians, and revolutionaries who know that real healing can only happen in community with others. To call such a community “countercul- tural” would be to miss the point: MAPS and its supporters have always understood that to achieve new ways of living and better ways of being in relation to others and to our- selves demands that such changes take place throughout our culture, extending far beyond the realm of the merely “scientific” or the merely “medical.” This is MAPS at its most gooey. But we must also ask whether the dis- tinction between reason and art—between science and creativity—is perhaps a false one. Watts, in his uniquely category-confusing style, seemed to think that it was: “But we know very well that this natural universe is neither prickles nor goo exclusively: it’s gooey prickles and prickly goo...and we’re always playing with the two.” Straddling the line between science and counterculture, MAPS operates in a space all its own. It is neither a pharmaceutical company nor a countercul- tural cult, and distances itself from those who would seek to profit from new pharmaceuti- cal treatments as much as from those who would claim that psychedelics and marijuana are without their own risks and their own complicated histories. It’s a new kind of insti- tution and embodies a new way of thinking about the relationship between human beings and their technologies. And that’s exactly why very little stands in the way of MAPS and those who support it financially, spiritually, and politically. MAPS can be open and confident about its mission to open up new avenues of research that not very long ago would have been seen as revolutionary or even dangerous—like giving MDMA (commonly known as Ecstasy) to perfectly healthy therapists in order to teach them something about what their patients might be experiencing during psychedelic psy- chotherapy sessions. MAPS knows that text- book knowledge of the pharmacological effects of psychedelics is not enough, and that a more complete understanding of these drugs and their demonstrated potential to help people suffering from traumatic illnesses demands a more personal and intuitive approach as well. Empathy and science are hardly mutually ex- clusive forms of knowledge—they’re just two complementary ways of looking at the world. For MAPS, science and art go hand in hand, and it’s always playing with the two. • Straddling the line between science and counterculture, MAPS operates in a space all its own.

This well-attended event was part of a global tour that Razam was on to promote his two new books, and he was going around from city to city, leading panel discussions about psyche- delics. Razam was great fun that night; he radiated a lot of enthusiasm, which generated much excitement and fostered the free flow of interesting ideas. Prior to that evening, I was familiar with the delightful anthology of essays and interviews that Razam had edited about psychedelic history and psycho - nautic exploration, “The JourneyBook”– which is jam-packed with fascinat - ing information from the frontiers of consciousness exploration, and provides an especially interesting window into the psychedelic culture of Australia. It’s a treasure chest overflowing with wonderful psychedelic revelations and extraordinary visionary artwork. Beautifully illustrated with dazzling full-color graphics, The JourneyBook includes mind-expanding contributions by Stanislav Grof, Dennis McKenna, Eric Davis, Daniel Pinchbeck, and many Exploring the World of Ayahuasca-Based Tourism and the Globalization of Psychedelics: A Review of Two New Books from Rak Razam By David Jay Brown, M.A. MAPS Guest Editor, Author dajabr@well.com Aya: A Shamanic Odyssey By Rak Razam 444 pages, softcover. Icaro Publishing, 2009 www.ayathebook.com others. Nineteen writers and thirteen artists contribute to this innovatively- designed, back-coverless, flip-upside-in- the-middle book, which draws attention to the fact that--thanks to the internet--a new and sophisticated form of psychedelic culture is emerging on the planet, glob - ally connecting its participants through boundary-dissolving interactions. While visiting California, Razam gave me a copy of his latest book “Aya: A Sha - manic Odyssey.” After reading the first few pages, I was quickly swept up into his deeply inspiring, highly educational journey, which left me with my jaw hang - ing in awe. You really have to hand it to Razam, as this book was quite an ambi - tious undertaking. He did a marvelous job documenting the fascinating cultural phenomenon that’s currently occurring in the Amazon with ayahuasca tourism–as well as his own personal shamanic jour - neys into the hyperdimensional realms of ayahuasca consciousness–for those of us without the courage, time, or resources to head off into the hot, wet jungles of South America, and drink the powerfully hal - lucinogenic jungle brew."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 25 Initially on assignment from Austra - lian Penthouse magazine, Razam trav - eled to Peru, where he immersed himself in the cross-cultural, ayahuasca-based community that flourishes in and around Iquitos. While he was there–amongst the curanderos, spiritual seekers, backpack adventurers, impoverished indigenous people, desperately ill, well-to-do tour - ists, shifty-eyed salesmen, and shaman- entrepreneurs–organically and unex - pectedly, the article that he was writing grew vine-like into a whole book. Razam first attends an international conference about ayahuasca, and then embarks on his own far-flung adventures with the plant brew. He partakes in numerous ayahuasca ceremonies, led by an unusual array of memorable curanderos and curandero mix-breeds, in various culturally-blended settings, amongst a colorful collection of characters, recording every microscopic detail, so that you really feel like you’re there with him, inside of his head. I think that this is the best book avail - able about the strange and intriguing interface between Western culture and traditional ayahuasca-based shamanism. It’s also a true adventure story, written in a very personal, readable style, and it had me turning the pages to find out what happens next. Recounted with un - usual sensitivity, compassionately brutal honesty, high humor, real guts, and an incredible eye for detail, Razam shares his hard-earned shamanic knowledge with us by using Western memes and icons as archetypes, so that Australians and Americans can especially relate to his experiences. Razam does a remarkable job incorporating his own insights and rev - elations, dreams and synchronicties, with the story, and you can sense the symbiot - ic spirit of the ayahuasca vine intertwin - ing with the words in the book. I highly recommend this inspiring and hopeful book to all aspiring ayahuasqueros, as well as anyone interested in the alchemi - cal transformation of consciousness, and I think that it will especially appeal to people interested in plant-based spiritu - ality quests, and the interface between Western and indigenous cultures. • The JourneyBook: Travels on the Frontiers of Consciousness Edited by Rak Razam Art Director: Tim Parish 240 pages, softcover, illustrated Undergrowth Inc., 2009 www.thejourneybook.com Call for Submissions The next MAPS Bulletin will be a special edition about Psychedelics, Death and Dying.

Robert Buelteman is committed to the transcendent qualities of life as reflected in his photographs, which portray the universe as designed and life as purposeful. His print work is a powerful extraction of beauty and substance revealing unrecognized dimensions in the commonplace. He has published 13 photographic portfolios in his thirty-five years in photography, and four of these, “A Vision of Life” (1988), “The Unseen Peninsula” (1994), “Eighteen Days in June” (2000), and “Signs of Life” (2009) were published as books. In 1999, Buelteman left photographic tradition behind in creating “Through the Green Fuse”, a portfolio of extraordinary photograms made without cameras, lenses, or computers. As a result of the success of this new work, Robert served as the artist-in-residence at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico from 2003-2006. His work can be found in public and private collections worldwide, including the Yale Uni- versity Art Museum, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Bank of America, Xerox, and Nikon. Robert writes, “The creative process begins with my selection of a subject, after which I bring the living subject into the studio, where I sculpt it with surgical tools to manage its form and opacity. I then move into the darkroom to manipulate the subject on my imaging easel. The easel is surrounded by a safety fence of wooden 2x4s to avoid electro- cution, is composed of a piece of aluminum sheet metal floated in a solution of liquid sili- cone, and is sandwiched between two sealed pieces of 1/8” thick Plexiglas. I then go into total darkness to build the exposure matrix on top of my easel. First, the 8x10 inch color transparency film is laid flat on the easel with the light-sensitive surface face up. Then the sculpted subject is placed on the film, some- times with and sometimes without layers of diffusion material, which are laid on top when used. The subject is then wired to a grounding source with cable and clamp. The actual pro- cess of imaging begins with the introduction of high frequency, high voltage electricity into the exposure matrix to create the ultraviolet aura of ionized gas that surrounds the subject. Then a variety of light sources including xenon-strobe, tungsten, and fiber-optic light are used to illuminate the subject by hand so the light is scattered through the diffusion screens, through the subject, and onto the film where the exposure energy is recorded.” Back cover image: “Integration” by Autumn Skye Mor- rison, 30x42” acrylic, mixed media, antique frame, 2009.

She considers herself among the blessed of the blessed. “I paint in celebration of this fan- tastic adventure. I paint to inspire and to be inspired. Each canvas takes me on a journey, and as my paintbrush follows, each time I am lead back to my center. Yet, if you step into my art looking for me, you will only find yourself. I offer a reflection of our light and shadow, our feminine essence, and our timeless divinity.” • “Antherium” and “Integration” – Artists’ Statements “Integration” by Autumn Skye, 2009 “Antherium” by Robert Buelteman Robert Buelteman Autumn Skye Morrison"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~1o maps • volume xix number 3 • winter 2oo9~10 27 Rick Doblin, MAPS founder and President , earned his Ph.D. in Public Policy from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
