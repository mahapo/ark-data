Jams typically contain the flesh and juice of a fruit or a vegetable. Sometimes, it’s alsodescribed as a jelled puree. What you have to know about jams is that they are often made by crushingor heating fruits/vegetables and adding sugar into it. Jams can be eaten either on their own or withbread.How to make a home-made jam:1. First, you have to have some jam-making equipment ready. These equipment include:• 1 large pot. 16-20 quart Teflon lined pots are the most recommended ones.• Ladles and large spoons• 1 canner, or the pot used to sanitize the jars where you’ll be putting the jams in• Jar funnel, to help you pour the jams inside the jars• Ball jars. You’ll be placing the jams inside ball jars for proper storage.• Thin metal lids with gum binder• Jar grabber or tongs. These will help you in picking up the jars, especially when they arehot.• Make sure that you have cleaned/sterilized the equipment before using them.2. You have to have the ingredients ready, too. You will need:• Your choice of fruit or vegetable. Usually, strawberries, blueberries, and pineapple, or"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"mangoes are made into jams.• Sugar. About 4 cups of granulated, dry sugar would do the trick. If you’re not very muchinto sugar, you can substitute it with Honey or Agave.• Lemon juice. It is recommended to use no more than ¼ cup of juice for every batch offruits.• Pectin. This is found in apples and makes the jam taste even better and last longer. Addingpectin is optional, though.3. Directions:• Decide which fruits you want to use. You can buy them from the market or the grocery orpick them yourself if you want. Remember that only 6 cups of fruit at a time isrecommended to make a great kind of jam. This will also make sure that the taste staysintact (1 batch = 6 cups).• Wash and hull the fruits.• Mash the fruits. Do not crush them completely so as not to lose their natural juices and tomake sure that there’s still some texture left.• Measure the amount of sugar that you would be using. The amount of sugar you have to usewill depend on the kind of fruit that you’ll be using. Again, the amount of sugar indicatedbelow is in the proportion of a batch for every 6 cups of fruit and not just a cup alone.Here’s a quick guide:o Strawberries/Blackberries/Blueberries – 4 cups of sugaro Apple – 7 cups of sugaro Mango – 6 cups of sugaro Pineapple – 7 cups of sugar• For those who want to use pectin, mix it with ¼ cup of sugar before mixing to the fruits.• Mix everything together and cook to a full boil. It will only take 5 to 10 minutes to getsomething to boil fully.• Add the remaining sugar and bring to a boil for at least 4 more minutes.• Let it stand for at least 5 minutes and then stir until there are no more bubbles left.• Let it cool for a little bit and then pour into the ball jars. Make sure that you seal it well inorder to restore freshness and taste.• Boil the jars in hot water for at least two minutes, then remove them and let them cool.Store in a cool, dry place. That’s it; you have made your own homemade jam!Take note that in order to check the consistency of the jam, you have to keep a tablespoon with youin the kitchen while working. Use the spoon to check if the jam is too rummy, too thick, or just aboutright."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: Fruit ButtersFruit butter is a spread made out of fruit that is cooked to a paste and is lightly sweetened. Fruitbutter/paste is mostly popular in Latin-American countries and is sweeter and more jelled than fruitjams but with less sugar content. Some common examples are:• Pear butter• Apple butter• Pumpkin butter• Mango butter/paste• Guava butter/paste• Fig butter/pasteThe best thing about fruit butter is that it’s easy to make and you do not need pectin or any otherartificial ingredient for it. All you have to do is hull the fruit, mix it with some sugar and you’re allset. You may also choose to cook in small or large batches. They are also perfect as gifts, especiallyduring the holidays.You can make Fruit Butter through different cooking methods. You may use any of thefollowing:• Slow Cooker – Place the pulp inside the cooker with the cooker’s lid partially off in orderfor steam to escape. Set at low fire and cook. Stir occasionally. Leave it at that for around 6 to12 hours overnight or until the butter is thick enough that it doesn’t fall off a spoon.• Stovetop Cooker – In a medium saucepan, place the sweetened pulp and cook over medium-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"low heat.• Microwave – Place the pulp in a microwave bowl and cook for 20 minutes. Stir frequentlyuntil thick.• Oven – Set the oven to 300 degrees and place the sweetened pulp in a roaster or uncoveredcasserole dish. Bake and stir occasionally for 1 to 3 hours or until thick enough. The resultwould be a darker colored butter but what’s good is that it is sturdier than other fruit buttersthat are cooked using a stovetop or a slow cooker.To process the fruit butter, here’s what you have to do:• Place the hot fruit butter in a sterilized jar. Make sure that you leave at least a ¼ inch space atthe top.• Cover the jar with sterilized rings and lids.• Process in a water bath for 10 minutes.• Remove from heat and allow to cool for a bit before storing. Fruit butters can last for monthsand even up to a whole year."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: MarmaladesMarmalades are made from the peel and juice of citrus fruits that are boiled in water with sugar.More often than not, lemon, lime, mandarins, grapefruits, sweet oranges, Seville oranges, andBergamot oranges are used to make marmalades. The difference between a jam and marmalade is thefruit peel that is often found in marmalades.How to make marmalade:• Choose the fruit that you would be using. Again, you have to remember that citrus fruits areoften the best kind of fruits used for marmalades. This is because citrus fruits have a verystrong sharp taste and acidity that makes it easy for them to be turned into a liquefiedsubstance. The peel of citrus fruits is also edible once processed.• Make sure that you wash/sterilize the equipment you will use, such as the jars. This is tomake sure that once you’re done cooking, the place where you’ll be pouring the mixture intowould be clean.• Peel the fruit and make sure that the pith of the peel is not removed.• Chop the peel. You do not have to include all the peel of the fruit, but make sure that you douse some because this would give the marmalade its proper texture and flavor, courtesy of theoil coming from the peel of the fruit.• Squeeze out the juice of the fruit. You can do this with the use of your hands, or with a fruitsqueezer.• Boil the juice, peel, and pulp altogether. Add 500ml or a pint of water to the mixture andboil for between 45 minutes to an hour. Remember, though, that you have to keep theingredients in a mesh bag while boiling so as to make sure that the right consistency isobserved.• Add 1 kilogram of sugar to the mix after 45 minutes to an hour. Do this after squeezing outsome more juice from the mesh bag. Boil the mixture and make sure that all the sugar getsdissolved before bringing it to a hard boil. Ten minutes should do the trick, but if you wantsomething darker, then boil until your desired color and consistency have been achieved.• To check if the marmalade is already in the right consistency, blob it out in a plate andcheck if it’s already thick. If it’s thick and has some texture, then it’s all good, but if it fallsoff the plate or drizzles all over the plate, then you have to boil it again.• Pour the marmalade into the jars. Make sure, though, that you are wearing gloves and thatthere is some cold water nearby in case the hot marmalade falls onto your skin.• Seal the jar while it’s still hot. Keep it warm for at least a day or two before putting it in therefrigerator. A great marmalade would be something glowing or bright with some peel in it."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: JelliesA fruit jelly is a clear or translucent fruit spread that is made from sweetened fruit/vegetable juice.It is naturally preserved through its own pectin, or the substance that makes something sticky and ableto store its natural flavors. However, you may still choose to add more pectin, or the kind of pectinfound in stores/groceries, in case the fruit’s sweetness is not enough for you. This is usually done inthe case of grapes.The difference between a jelly and a jam is that when it comes to jellies, a “jelly bag” is used tofilter extra pulp. This jelly bag also makes stirring easier. Jellies are also more gelatinous or gummierthan jam and are often served on their own as desserts. Sometimes, jellies are also added to fruit orvegetable salads to add more texture to the said dishes.How to make Fruit Jellies:You will need:• 1 1/3 cups fruit juice of your choice• 4 packets powdered gelatin• 2 ½ cups sugar• 2 cups jam or fruit preserves of your choice. It would be best if it’s the same flavor as thatof your fruit juice or at least something close to it.What you have to do:• In a small bowl or measuring cup, place 2/3 cup juice and sprinkle with gelatin. Let it sit forat least 5 minutes.• Combine the remaining 2/3 cup of juice and the 1 ½ cups of sugar.• Bring to a medium-high boil and cook until the sugar dissolves through stirring.• Add fruit preserves and whisk so that all the ingredients would mesh with one another.• Return to a boil and cook until syrupy and thick or for around 2 minutes.• Add the gelatin mixture and whisk until it dissolves.• Place the remaining cup of sugar in a bowl or a pie plate.• Cut the fruit jelly into 1-inch squares and toss sugar to cat the jellies before serving.You can also create different kinds of Jellies for different fruits. Here’s a quick guide as to whatyou will need. Remember to just follow the instructions above in order to make the jellies, and keepthese in mind:• For apple jellies, you will need 3 lbs tart red apples—1/4 under-ripe and ¾ ripe—and 3 cupsof water. You will also need 4 cups fruit juice, 3 cups sugar, and 2 Tbsp strained lemon juice."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"• For blackberry jellies, you need 5 pits blackberries—1/4 under-ripe, ¾ ripe and ¾ cupswater, 4 cups fruit juice and ¾ cups sugar.• Meanwhile, you will need 3 ½ lb grapes for grape jellies. Make sure that ¼ of that is under-ripe and ¾ is ripe. You will also need 4 cups fruit juice and 3 cups sugar.• For plum jellies, you will need 3 lb plums containing ¼ under-ripe ones and ¾ ripe ones,plus 1 ½ cups water. 4 cups fruit juice and 3 cups sugar are also needed.You also have to think of the amount of pectin in a fruit. This will let you know if it’s okay toprocess the fruit with its own pectin or if adding artificial pectin is still needed. You can do thisthrough two types of tests called the Alcohol Test and the Jelmeter Test.For the Alcohol test, you have to add a tablespoon of cooled fruit juice to one tablespoon ofdenatured alcohol. This alcohol is the rubbing alcohol kind, which means that this test is done purelyto check the state of the gelatin and not to eat it. Stir slightly in order for the ingredients to mix. If theresult is a jelly-like mass, then it means that the juice is rich in pectin. However, if the juice is lackingin pectin, then it will only form some small, jelly-like particles.A Jelmeter test is simpler, though. A Jelmeter is actually a glass tube with an opening at each end.You’ll know about how much pectin a juice has or how much Pectin is needed through the flow rate ofthe juice through the tube.To test if the jelly is ready to serve, though, you have to pour a small amount of boiling jelly onto acold surface. Put it in the freezer for a few minutes and when the mixture gels, you’ll know that it’sready. If it doesn’t, bring the mixture back to a boil.That’s it. You can now make your own fruit jelly!"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Curds and ConservesCurds and conserves are two more kinds of preserves. Curds are done by curdling or coagulatingmilk with an edible acidic substance such as vinegar, lemon juice, or rennet, which is often use in theproduction of cheese, and then draining off the liquid portion afterwards. The acidity is what turns themilk proteins into curds, or solid masses.There are different kinds of curd products and some examples are Cottage Cheese, Indian Paneerand Quark. They are usually served with fries and gravy, or some other kinds of chips.There is also another kind of curd called the fruit curd. This is usually a creamy spread that ismade from eggs, sugar, butter, and citrus juice and zest. The most common example would be lemoncurd, but recently, strawberry and cranberry curds have been emerging, too. You can use fruit curds astart fillings and as garnish.To make a fruit curd, you have to:Whisk together the eggs, juice, zest, and sugar in a saucepan. Add the butter and mix then cook overmoderately low heat. Whisk until the mixture turns into something that is thick enough to coat a spoonor for about 6 minutes. Make sure to use a strainer to remove unwanted egg bits or strips.Put the curd into a bowl and cover its surface with plastic wrap. Chill for at least an hour or untilcold.Keep in mind that it’s best to make a curd out of citrus fruits such as lemon, lime, orange, ortangerine as these fruits are naturally acidic and will easily curd.On the other hand, a conserve is usually a mixture of fruit, nuts and raisins. These are mixedtogether and cooked until they become chunky. Almost every kind of fruit is used in making fruitconserves, but some favorites include: strawberry conserves, apple conserves, cantaloupe conserves,cranberry conserves, and rhubarb conserves among others. Sometimes, wine is also used as one ofthe ingredients of a conserve.How to make a conserve:You will need a mix of your choice of fruits and fruit juice. Know that you can mix and match anyfruits that you want, especially if you are adventurous when it comes to concocting recipes.Cook the fruits and sugar with a cup of water in a saucepan over low heat for at least 5 minutes oruntil the skins of the fruit pop open. Add the zest and juice and cook for another 15 minutes. Removefrom heat and then add the nuts or raisins. Let it cool for a bit then serve chilled."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Chapter 6: PicklesPickles are the end product of pickling. Pickling is a fermentation process wherein food ispreserved through the use of brine or edible oils as the pickling agent. Pickles usually taste salty orsour.The process of pickling also uses a pH or acidity level of only 4.6, meaning the bacteria in the foodwould be killed and so the pickled food can last for months. Sometimes, garlic, mustard seeds,cloves, or cinnamon are even added to the mix to give the food a unique taste and texture.Pickles are also often the source of healthy, pro-biotic microbes, or the natural bacteria that thebody needs.

Tomatoes are blanched in hot water, peeled, and then stuffedinto jars, are covered and then boiled again to make sure that the jars are sealed. If you have anyexcess ripe tomatoes lying around the kitchen, then you may want to get them canned so that they’dstay in good condition for a long time.To do this, bring a large pot of water to a boil and then use a sharp knife to make an “X” on thetomatoes. Put the tomatoes in while the water is boiling and then cook them for a minute. Afterwards,you can take out the tomatoes, let them cool for a few minutes, and then remove the skin with the useof a paring knife. Sterilize the jars for around 10 minutes.Put 2 tbsp lemon juice in each sterilized jar and then put the tomatoes in. Put the lids of the jars on,leaving a ½-inch space near the top, and then boil for around 45 minutes. Remove from the boil andlet it cool overnight before storing in a cool, dry place.Make a homemade tomato sauceA tomato sauce can be used for pizza and pasta dishes, plus some other saucy dishes such as beanburrito bowls and cabbage soup. Fleshier tomatoes such as Roman, Early Girl, or Plum are betterused for this.

Sometimes, you buy tomatoes but you are notvery sure where to use them or if you really want to use them right away. You’d also feel likethrowing them away would not be good. When this happens, you have to start freezing the tomatoes tokeep them fresh for a long time.To freeze tomatoes, you’d simply have to put tomatoes inside a resealable plastic bag and then suckthe excess air out with the use of a straw. Seal the container and then freeze. You may also try liningout the tomatoes in a baking tray and then putting them in the freezer. This is best done when you havea lot of tomatoes. Also, there is no need to peel the tomatoes before freezing them.How to dry tomatoesYou may have heard of dried mangoes or dried pineapple, but surprise, surprise; there’s also sucha thing as dried tomatoes. Dried tomatoes can be made through baking the tomatoes in an oven that ispre-heated to 200 degrees.Ingredients:2 lbs tomatoes1 tbsp olive oilProcedure:• Rinse tomatoes and dry thoroughly.
