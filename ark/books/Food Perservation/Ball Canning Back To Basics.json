This high-acid environment is inhospitable to molds, yeasts, bacteria, and enzymes (the spoilers). Here’s How It Works A sealed jar filled with food is submerged in a bath of boiling water long enough to bring the food inside to 212°F. The heat expands the food, pushing out all the air. When the jar is removed from the water bath, it begins to cool and contract, which forms the vacuum seal (and the famous “pinging” sound Ball ® canning lids make). This newly created sealed environment is what makes the contents safe for long-term room temperature storage. It keeps any harmful microorganisms out while killing off any remaining in the food. The Importance of Acidity The most important factor in determining how to safely preserve foods for pantry storage is acidity—the pH level of the food (or recipe). The lower the pH, the higher the acidity. Foods having naturally high levels of acid, or those with a sufficient amount of acid added to decrease the pH level to 4.6 or lower, may be processed in a boiling water canner. As the chart shows, fruits are naturally high in acid, while vegetables are not. While fruits, jams, and jellies are generally classified as high-acid foods, some fruits, such as figs, rhubarb, papaya, melons, and tomatoes require the addition of extra acid, commonly citric acid from lemon or lime juice. This will ensure that a safe pH is maintained throughout and after processing. Mixing high-acid foods with low-acid foods in a recipe requires acidulation. With salsas and chutneys, for instance, the low- acid foods can raise the pH level and cause dangerous conditions"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"once canned, which is why it is necessary to follow thoroughly tested recipes and the safe processing times indicated. Note: The use of fresh lemon or lime juice in some of the recipes in this book is done for the purpose of fresh flavor. Be assured that any recipe that calls for fresh lemon or lime juice has been thoroughly verified as safe by scientific testing. Fruits and Soft Spreads You need four key ingredients to make jams, jellies, preserves, and marmalades successfully: fruit, acid, pectin, and sugar. A balance of all four of these ingredients is necessary to achieve a successful set (or gel). Sugar has preserving properties, as it replaces some of the water in the fruit, helping jams and jellies set and become glossy. It also helps preserve color during storage and delay spoiling by microorganisms and enzymes once jars are opened. Low-sugar/no- sugar fruit jams and jellies preserve just as safely but need to be consumed quickly once opened. Pectin is a natural substance found in fruits, vegetables, and plants that is responsible for cell structure. It is needed in soft spreads to thicken and bind the fruit and juices together. The traditional method of making jams does not use added pectin but requires long cooking before the fruit breaks down enough to thicken and set. (To know when your long-cook recipe is done, refer to Testing the Set or Gel .) Quick-cook recipes use added pectin to help the spread set properly so you can spend less time at the stove. Commercial pectin, such as Ball ® RealFruit ® Classic Pectin, Ball ® RealFruit ® Low or No-Sugar Needed Pectin, Ball ® RealFruit ® Instant Pectin, and Ball ® RealFruit ® Liquid Pectin, is extracted from fruits that have very naturally high levels of pectin. The recipes in this book give complete instructions for the type of pectin to be used, as well as the correct balance of acid, fruit, and sugar needed to"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"achieve a satisfactory set.

Spices or a second fruit or fruit juice may be added for flavor."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Canning Tomatoes Tomatoes are the glorious fruit we use as a vegetable. They are in the danger range on the pH scale, as some varieties are sweet and contain less acid. Some, notably heirloom, tomatoes are 4.6 pH or higher, and as they ripen their pH level rises even higher, which makes it necessary to add acid during canning to ensure a safe pH is maintained. Citric acid, lemon or lime juice, and vinegar have low pH and bring different flavors to tomato recipes. A pinch of sugar can offset the tartness. Canning tomatoes whole, halved, or quartered can be done by either of two methods: raw pack or hot pack. Raw pack refers to raw, peeled tomatoes packed into jars, and then topped off with hot water. With the hot-pack method, the tomatoes are heated through, and then packed into jars and topped off with the hot cooking liquid. Citric acid or lemon juice is always added, along with desired dry seasonings. The recipes in this book give you the option to use either Ball ® Citric Acid or lemon juice to ensure a safe pH. The tomato-based salsas included in the book are loaded with fresh vegetables like onions and chiles and have plenty of added acid, making them safe for water bath preservation. Pickling Pickling is so much more than just cucumbers in a salty vinegar brine. It’s the process of preserving vegetables and fruits in vinegar or with salt by fermentation (which is a whole other book!). Both vinegar and salt have preserving qualities: Salt draws out water from produce, helping it stay crunchy, while vinegar adds the acid needed to help keep preserved vegetables safe to eat. Together with herbs and spices, vinegar and salt create that distinctly tangy “pickled” flavor that can be sweet, spicy, or full of garlic and dill. When pickling, for best results use only granulated salt with no additives, such as Ball ® Salt for Pickling and Preserving. Different vinegars offer unique flavoring options; just be sure the one you’re using has 5% acidity. Anything less than 5% acidity can cause the pH"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"of your pickle to be thrown out of balance, making the pickle potentially unsafe. Pickle brine contains water. Avoid using hard water since it has minerals that can have an adverse effect on your final pickle. Instead, use soft, spring, or distilled water. A great way to ensure extra crispness when making fresh-pack pickles is to use a crisping agent, such as Ball ® Pickle Crisp ® Granules (calcium chloride, a naturally occurring salt found in some mineral deposits). In this book, we include recipes for fresh pack and refrigerator pickles, relishes, and chutneys. Fresh and refrigerator pickles are fresh-pack, meaning the produce is put into jars either raw or quickly heated, usually along with the spices, and then a hot vinegar brine is poured over the pickles, which then can be either preserved in a water bath canner for shelf storage in the pantry, or put in the refrigerator for convenient quick eating. Relish is basically a pickle with ingredients that have been diced or chopped. It’s usually cooked in its brine, which will be thick, before ladling into jars. Chutney refers to a type of relish that usually contains a combination of fruit, vinegar, sugar, and spices, originating from South Asia. As a general rule, keep freshly harvested vegetables very cold and use them within 24 hours. Although they are safe to eat immediately, pickles will develop a uniform flavor and texture if allowed to stand for 3 weeks in the refrigerator after processing in jars."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Basic Gear 1.

Some jars have shoulders while others have straight sides that work best for freezing. (Only use straight-sided jars for freezing.) Your recipe will guide you on the recommended jar sizes. See this chart for some suggestions to get you started. Mouth size The diameter of the jar opening determines the mouth size. Choose from either regular or wide mouth sizes. All jelly jars have a regular mouth. Regular mouth works best with pourable foods, such as jams, jellies, salsas, sauces, and pie fillings, or chopped fruits and vegetables. Wide Mouth works best with whole fruits and vegetables or when you need a large mouth for filling."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Getting Started There are just a few simple steps to follow when water bath canning: prepare ingredients, cook recipe, fill jars, and process jars in a canner. But here are some important things to keep in mind to make sure your efforts are successful. Start with a Good Recipe Home canning does not require any special culinary skills, but factors like jar size, accurate measurements, specific ingredient preparation, and processing times all can affect the temperature and acidity of home canned foods. Be sure to use only reliable recipes that have been tested for home canning to ensure safe, nutritious results. Begin by reading the recipe all the way through before you start. Set aside enough time to prepare and process the recipe without interruption. Each recipe will give specific instructions for coring, peeling, chopping, crushing, or juicing fruits and vegetables. Follow the preparation instructions carefully to ensure that the correct measure of produce is incorporated into the recipe for correct balance of ingredients. The recipe will also indicate if the ingredients need to be raw or cooked, and how much headspace to leave once you fill a jar."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Keep It Clean Wash jars, lids, and bands. Before adding lids (always use new lids) and bands to your filled jar, make sure to clean the rim of the jar of any drips. Food residue can prevent the lid from sealing properly.

This means boiling water and pressure processing methods must be adjusted to ensure the safety of home-canned food. Additional processing time must be added when using the boiling water method. The altitude chart below gives adjustments for various elevations. Processing times and temperatures for recipes in this book are based on canning at an elevation of 1,000 feet above sea level or lower. If you are processing at a higher elevation, refer to the altitude chart for adjustments.

Continue to boil for a few minutes more and retest."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"What to Know About Spoilage Before you can fully understand how food is safely preserved for pantry storage during the home-canning process, it is helpful to become familiar with how and why food spoils in the first place and how spoilage can be prevented. Molds and Yeast Molds are visible and nonvisible fungi that grow in food. Although some mold is relatively harmless, certain molds can produce mycotoxins that are toxic. Yeasts are also a form of fungi that cause fermentation. Both can make for inedible food that may even be harmful to eat. Foods of low pH are largely protected from bacterial growth; however, molds and yeasts are ever-present and, if left untreated, continue to grow. But don’t worry, they are easily destroyed when exposed to high temperatures (between 140° and 190°F. Since boiling water canners heat food to 212°F, high-acid foods can safely be preserved using this method. Bacteria Bacteria are not easily destroyed by heat; in fact, certain bacteria actually thrive at temperatures that destroy molds and yeasts and will continue to survive in the absence of oxygen within a moist environment—exactly the conditions inside a sealed jar of food. As all of the canning recipes in this book have a pH that is well below 4.6, processing the jars using a water bath is sufficient for ensuring a safe result. Sweet, ripe tomatoes, as noted earlier, have a pH that is borderline for water bath processing but the addition of citric acid or lemon juice in our recipes ensures a safe pH is maintained. Enzymes Enzymes are proteins that are present in all living things and are the catalysts that promote organic changes and reactions in our bodies and in food. They promote spoilage if not inactivated. Luckily, enzymes are easily inactivated by temperatures starting at 140°F. Therefore, they are easily inactivated in a boiling water process."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Signs of Spoilage Do not taste food from a jar that comes unsealed or shows signs of spoilage. Examine each jar of food carefully before using it to ensure a vacuum seal is present. Lids that are concave indicate the jar is sealed. Do not use any jar of food that is unsealed, has a bulging lid, or does not require a can opener for the lid to be removed. Food spoilage produces gases that cause the lids to swell and/or break their seals. Visually examine jars of food for other signs of spoilage that might be present. Jars that are suspected of containing spoiled low-acid or tomato products must be handled carefully. They may exhibit different signs of spoilage or no signs of spoilage. If you suspect your jar contains spoiled food, handle carefully. Place jars of sealed home-canned food showing signs of spoilage in a garbage bag. Secure the bag closed and place it in the regular trash container or dispose of it at a landfill. Home-canned food that shows signs of spoilage must be discarded in a manner that ensures no human or animal will come in contact with the product. Contact with botulinum toxin can be fatal whether it is ingested or enters the body through the skin. Avoid contact with suspect food. Indications that the food has spoiled include: • Broken seal • Mold • Gassiness • Cloudiness • Spurting liquid • Bubbles rising in jar • Seepage • Yeast growth • Fermentation • Slime • Unpleasant odor"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"1 Jams, Preserves, and Marmalades"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"These are some of the most iconic and versatile spreads you can make.

The Solution: • Heat process all filled jars using the method and time recommended in the tested recipes for the specific food and jar size. Make sure to adjust processing time for high altitude as required. • Check for the proper headspace. Use the headspace recommended in the recipe for the specific food and jar size. • Check for the proper adjustment of lids and bands. • Check that there are no food particles on the jar rim.

The Solution: • The proportions of sugar, juice, or fruit, acid, and pectin are not in balance. Make sure to follow the recipe instructions exactly. • Fruit used to prepare soft spread is overripe. • The soft spread is not boiled at a rolling boil for the required length of time. Always bring soft spread to a full rolling boil when using commercial pectin or to 220°F when preparing a recipe with no added pectin. • The wrong type or amount of pectin was used. Pectin types are not interchangeable. Use only the type of pectin listed in the recipe and measure powdered pectin carefully. • Some soft spreads may take as long as two weeks before the gel is set. If your jelly or jam won’t set after 2 weeks and you followed the recipe instructions completely and accurately, you may remake it in order to achieve a firmer set."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"The Problem: My jam, jelly, or other soft spread is tough or stiff. The Solution: • This can happen when there’s too much natural pectin in the fruit.

Use standard dry measuring cups and level the sugar even with the top edge of the cup."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The Problem: There are bubbles in my spread.

Always bring soft spread to a full rolling boil when using commercial pectin or to 220°F when preparing a recipe with no added pectin. • If bubbles are stationary when the jar is stationary, air is trapped in the gel.

Mixture gels, but fruit solids and clear jelly separate into layers. Fruit floating in a sealed jar does not affect the flavor or safety of the food, but may not look as pleasing. The Solution: • This can occur when you use immature fruit or porous, textured fruit. Be sure to use fully ripe, freshly picked fruit and berries, either fresh or frozen. Some imported out-of-season fruits are firm textured and tend to float more easily. • Another cause could be that the sugar content of your soft spread was too high. Be sure to measure carefully and cook the mixture at a full rolling boil for the time indicated in the recipe before filling the jars. • The cause could also be air in the fruit, which can be dependent on the growing season.

Completely cover food solids with liquid, making sure headspace is adequate, before applying closures. • Heat process all filled jars using the method and time recommended in a tested recipe for the specific food and jar size. • Excess air sealed in the jar due to improper headspace or bubble removal. Use headspace recommended in the recipe and slide a nonmetallic utensil between the food and the jar to release trapped air before applying the lids and screwing on the bands. • Use the hot pack method when indicated in recipe.

The Solution: • Poor-quality cucumbers may lack crispness. Choose high-quality cucumbers and, if possible, use them within 24 hours of harvest. • You may have used a variety of cucumber that is not recommended for pickling and canning. Use only pickling cucumbers; other varieties may be good choices for relishes or chutneys. • This may be due to not using a crisping agent. Use a crisping agent such as Ball ® Pickle Crisp ® Granules."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"The Problem: Pickles are soft or slippery. The Solution: • Make sure the blossom ends of the cucumbers are removed. Cut 1/16-inch off blossom ends of the cucumbers. The blossom end contains an enzyme that may cause softening. • The brine or vinegar may be too weak. Use Ball ® Salt for Pickling & Preserving and vinegar with 5% acidity. Follow a current, tested recipe for proper ratios of salt to vinegar. • The pickles may have been underprocessed and spoilage is occurring. Discard the pickles. In the future, follow the recommended processing time in a current, tested recipe using a boiling water canner."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"The Problem: Pickles have a strong, bitter taste. The Solution: • This can happen when you use spices that are old, cooked too long in the vinegar, or you used too large a quantity of spice. Use fresh spices—whole spices should be used within 3 to 4 years of purchase. Follow current, tested recipes to ensure that quantities and times are correct. • You may have used vinegar that was too strong. Always use vinegar at 5% acidity for fresh preserving. • Using a salt substitute in place of Ball ® Salt for Pickling & Preserving could be the problem.
