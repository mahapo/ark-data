Their entertainment value alone is about worth k eeping them. Then they can wor k , tilling you r land, debugging the garden and fertilizing all at the same time. But it is the egg that makes chickens so special . Once you’ ve had a fresh, golden - yoked egg from a chicken on pasture , it is hard to ever go back to store bought. P roducing eggs on your homestead creates a challenge that you don’t have when you buy your eggs every week at the g rocery store. It can be summed up in one word: SUPPLY. When you have your own chickens, sometimes you have a lot of eggs... and I mean a whole lot of eggs. And then sometimes you have none. It is part of the reality of seasonality that has been forgot ten because of that ever - full egg case at the supermarket. Not to fear , y ou do not have to eat 5 eggs a day when the hens are laying and none when they aren’t. You have options. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Preserving Eggs ©2018 Homesteading Family Page 3 Types of Eggs for Preservation Some egg preservation options are better for some types of eggs than others. For the purposes of this book, I have divided them up into 4 categories : 1) Fresh, clean, unwashed eggs 2) Fresh but dirty, unwashed eggs, 3)Fresh , washed eggs and 4)Store - bought eggs. TYPE 1: FRESH, CLEAN UNWASHED EGGS These are eggs that come in from the chicken house visibly clean. There are no smudges of barnyard muck or filth on them. These give you the greatest options in usability and storability, so it is worth any ex tra work it takes to be sure they leave the hen house clean. Put clean bedding in the nest boxes everyday if necessary, but make clean eggs a priority in your egg production program. TYPE 2: FRESH, DIRTY UNWASHED EGGS These are the eggs that come in from the hen house dirty. Whether the dirt is mud or muck it contains bacteria that you don’t want to eat. Fresh eggs naturally have a waxy coating on them called a “bloom” which protects them from bacteria entering the egg. Washing or dry"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Preserving Eggs ©2018 Homesteading Family Page 4 buffing eggs rem oves or damages this bloom, allowing bacteria to enter the egg. Using the eggs in the next few days for breakfast is your best option. Wash them off in warm water immediately before use. TYPE 3: FRESH, WASHED EGGS It is best if you don’t wash your eggs u ntil you are ready to use them, for the reason listed above. Sometimes though, a well - meaning friend give s you a few dozen of her fresh but washed eggs. There are still some methods of preserving you can use with these eggs but you’ll want to be sure to use them in applications where all parts of the eggs are well cooked in the final product. TYPE 4 STORE - BOUGHT EGGS Some people don’t have their own chickens but they want to keep a backup supply of eggs in their home. That leaves them with store - bought eggs. By law these eggs are washed. They are also raised in conditions of crowding that really inc rease their chance of elevated pathogenic bacteria counts. Always cook these eggs thoroughly and never store these eggs long - term in their own shells. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Preserving Eggs ©2018 Homesteading Family Page 5 Checking If an Egg is Good Sometimes you need to check if an egg is still good. Either you find a nest of eggs under the hen house or you want to see if your stored eggs are still safe to crack open in your house. If you’ve ever cracked a really bad egg open in your kitchen then you will understand that natural reluctance to ch ance it with a questionable egg ... th e experience scars you. Luckily for us, there is a very simple and reliable test for egg freshness. Just set your egg in a bowl of room temperature water. Fresh eggs will sink all the way to the bottom and lie completely flat on their sides. These are th e eggs that you can use for recipes requiring the freshest eggs... sunny side up eggs, poached eggs, over easy eggs, etc. T ips for best storability  Keep your nest boxes clean so your eggs come into the house unsoiled.  Do not wash eggs that are to be stored.  If eggs are soiled wash them in warm water and use up quickly.  When possible , st ore eggs with their small en d down .  Collect eggs daily... and even more often in hot weather.  De velop a rotation system so you use up the oldest eggs first. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Preserving Eggs ©2018 Homesteading Family Page 6 Slightly aged but still good eggs will sink to the bottom but one end will tip up. These eggs are the best type to use for boiled egg s. These are also good for scrambled eggs and great to bake with. Even older eggs will float suspended in the water. These are usually just fine f or baking with and scrambling but use them up soon. Bad eggs will float to the top... carefu lly remove them from the house! "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Preserving Eggs ©2018 Homesteading Family Page 7 Common Storage Sometimes the simplest solution is the best. Did you know that clean, unwashed eggs can be stored for weeks just out on the counter? Here in the US we always buy our eggs ou t of a refrigerator case in the grocery store so we are under the impression that they must be refrigerated. But in most of the rest of the world, eggs are left unwashed and sold non - refrigerated. You can expect an egg to remain good for at least 4 week s just sitting out on the counter in a fairly cool kitchen; less in a warm kitchen. It is said that a day out on the counter is equal to a week in the refrigerator. What that means is that the cooler you keep those eggs the longer they last. If you have a cool cellar, basement, pantry or other spot that remain a stable cool temperature you can make those eggs last a lot longer. Eggs kept in the refrigerator or in a similarly cool environment can be expected to keep for about 6 months. That’s a long time ! Just be sure to set up a rotation system so that you are using up the oldest eggs first. Space is usually the limiting factor for this t ype of storage. Think of creat ive ways to store the eggs to maximize space, i.e. putting eggs in a bucket or square s haped food storage bin rather than egg cartons... of course you r chances of a mess with a broken egg go way up, so be careful.

It is also a great way to keep those store - bought eggs or dirty eggs that come into the house. These eggs are great for baking with or for making scrambled eggs. Figure out how many eggs you want per container... we usually do 6 per quart sized freezer bag, but we are a large family. Maybe 2 is good for your family. Break your desired number of eggs into a small mixing bowl. Be at eggs just until well mixed, but don’t over incorporate air. Pour into a quart sized freezer bag . Push out all extra air. Freeze flat... many of these bags will store in a small space when stacked on top of each other in this manner. Be sure to label your bag and include the date and number of eggs. To defrost your eggs... just remove from freezer, cut bag open while still frozen and place frozen eggs in a small glass pan. Defrost overnight in a refrigerator.

It does make a mess, either way you do it and oil/fat is fairly pricey for storing eggs in. Not my favorite method, but still a very viable egg preservation method. Place dry, clean, unwashed eggs in a container and pour oil (olive, mineral, canola) or melted lard over eggs until all eggs are covered. Gently jiggle container to remove air bubbles without damaging eggs. Store eggs in the coolest location available that stays above freezing. To Use: S imply remove from container, rinse and use. Discard oil/lard when container is empty. Alte rnately , dip each dry, clean and unwashed egg in melted lard or oil that has cooled to warm. Set on a rack to dry. Store eggs in egg cartons or fill a bucket with a soft material... oats, salt, or sawdust is good, and nestle the coated eggs into the mater ial, layering more packing material and eggs. Store eggs in the coolest location available that stays above freezing. To Use: S imply remove from container, rinse and use. Tip : Eggs stored this way can take on an odd flavor afte r prolonged storage. Th is flavor is usually not noticeable in baked goods.

This method has been around for hundreds of years at least. I love it for it s simplicity. It is cheap to buy the supplies and rea lly quick to preserve the eggs . Y ou can also add more eggs to the solution whenever you get them and take them out as they are needed. You’ll need a large, preferably food grade container, such as a large crock or 5 gallon bucket and a bag of hydrated lime from the hardware store or a bag of pickling lime . Some older sources also call for salt... I’ve never used it personally but can s ee the reasoning for it to keep the eggs even better. Make a solution of 1 quart of water, 1 weight oz . of hydrated lime and ½ oz . of salt (non - iodized). Scale this up according to your container. Be sure that your solution is well mixed, but beware; som e of the lime will settle out... that is normal and ok. Usually you want to start with a container ½ filled with the solution and then add your eggs carefully. Use gloves to add the eggs as the lime solution is very alkaline and can dry your hands out q uickly. It is very important to be sure that the eggs remain covered in this solution at all times, so either cover your container with a tight - fitting lid or pour a layer of oil over the top to restrict evaporation . Store container in the coldest, no n - freezing location possible, c hecking often to be sure that eggs remain under the liquid. If the liquid level drops add more solution mixed at the same strength as the original.

Use as desired. Eggs stored in this way will last a long time... but they will still be slowly aging, so expect the quality to drop the longer they are stored. They can take on a bit of a flavor after being stored for some months; this might make them unpalatable for eating as fried or scrambled eggs, but they are usually completely fine in baked goods. There are reports of eggs being stored in this manner staying in great quality for up to 2 years, but we just store ours in the spring to ge t us through the low - egg season of winter. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Preserving Eggs ©2018 Homesteading Family Page 12 Pickl ed eggs Another great time tested method of preserving eggs is to pickle them... this will limit their final use, but give you a ready - made product, ready to snack on at any time. These pickled eggs can be kept in the refrigerator in a large jar for many months or canned in a w ater - bath canner to be kept on a pantry shelf . Start by hard - b oiling eggs and peeling them... slightly aged eggs that tilt in a freshness test are the best for this. Adding some vinegar to the boiling water makes them peel much easier. Do not poke egg s . In a pot on the stove mix 4 cups vinegar (white or apple cider vinegar), 1 cup water and ½ cup salt (non - iodized), until simmering and salt is completely dissolved . Double the brine as necessary for the amount of eggs you wish to use. In each clean , warmed quart jar add ½ tsp turmeric, 1 clove of garlic and ½ tsp c rushed red pepper (optional). Fill the jar with your peeled eggs and then top with brine. Leave 1 inch headspace. To Can for Pantry Storage: Place cleaned lids on top and place in a boiling water bath canner. Return to a boil. Process for 20 minutes ( adjust for elevation). Cool completely. Let these cure for 10 days before eating. For Refrigerator Storage: Just be sure that you r eggs are submerged under the brine, cap your jar (any size) and keep in refrigerator.

These will last about 3 months in the refrigerator and take u p WAY less space than the equivalent in egg cartons. If you make room for them in the freezer they will last for abou t a year. H olding raw eggs at a warm temperature for several hours , as in the case for dehydrat ing them, invites the multiplication o f bacteria (sa lmonella in this case) . B e sure to only use fresh, clean eggs (NEVER STORE BOUGHT) . Also , make sure their end product i s fully cooked before consuming it ... don’t eat the cookie dough! Beat very fresh eggs thoroughly. Pour eggs on a fruit leather sheet (maximum 1/4in thick). Dehydrate at 145 ° F for about 12 hours or until dry and brittle. Break it into small pieces and dry for 2 more hours. Place into a blender or food processor to powder. Store in a jar or plastic bag in the coldest location available.

This not only preserves your eggs , but al so gives you a quick convenience food throughout the year. Once dry , keep these noodles in any container that you find to hold them... if you make enou gh o f them a 5 gallon food grade bucket is a great option. Store them in the coolest place available. Like many things, there ar e about as ma ny noodle rec ipes as there are cooks... here is the very basic recipe I often use.

Knead this until your dough is smooth and ela stic . Either use a pasta roller to shape the noodles or roll out dough as thin as possible and slice thinly.

Storing about anything in alcohol makes it shelf stable... including milk and eggs (but ke ep it as cool as possible for quality) . T hat’s why you can buy cream liquors. After you store them you need to wait at least 3 weeks before consuming, giving the alcohol time to sterilize the eggs, but sterilize them it will! In addition to keeping the eggs safe to eat, aging eggnog mellows its flavo r, making for a smoother final product. The amount of alcohol needed to keep these eggs is pretty strong for most of us modest alcohol consumers, so just make a base for the eggnog and add the remainder of the ingredients righ t before serving to decrease its final alcohol percentage . In a glass jar, mix 12 eggs, 1 ½ cup bourbon , ½ cup cognac , and 1/3 cups of dark rum with 1 ½ cups sugar. Mix w ell , label and store in a cool location ( cellar or fridge preferably). Age at least 3 weeks and up to 12 months. To Serve: Shake jar well to mix. Add 6 cups whole milk and ½ cup cream and fresh nutmeg . Feel free to add more milk or cream to taste. Refrigerate overnight if desired to chill. To use a favor ite family recipe instead , just add 1 ½ oz. of 80 proof liquor per egg.
