That need is at its peak right now, because not since the “Victory Gardens” of World War II have so many people been raising and preserving so much of their own food as today. And people are not just raising tomatoes and green beans and strawberries, but a whole variety of vegetables and fruits, nuts, grains, and livestock as well. The number of organic gardeners and homesteaders has grown in recent years because people are discover- ing that just about the only way they can control the quality of the food they eat is to grow it themselves. Each year with seas nal -kT regularity, ORGANIC GARDENING AND FARM- INC;‘S Reader Service D partment receives hundreds of letters asking questions about food storage. Spring brings Ietters reql!esting build- ing plans for outdoor storage and ideas for converting basements into root cellars. In early summer readers want information on freezing early vegetable varieties and on making jams and jellies with berries and honey. The letter flow builds through the peach and tomato seasons, and by fall, it has developed into a virtual flood: How can I best keep my squash? Should I ca:l or freeze my corn? Do you have a good recipe for apple butter? How do I make sauerkraut using little or no salt? In the winter, readers want to know how to smoke meats and how to make natural cheese from their goat’s or cow’s milk. To find the information our readers wanted we first turned to modern books on home food preservation. But we found some prob- lems with the information these books had to offer. Those written in the last 30 years or so contain advanced storage techniques that best preserve the taste, appearance, and nutritive value of the fresh foods, but they are far from complete guides to home food storage. Rather, the modern literature available falls into one of two categories: Either it is books on fruit and vegetable storage for the backyard gardener who wants to can or freeze his or her garden surplus, or it is booklets x"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"and manuals on large-scale crop storage for farmers who have scvcral hundred acres in field crops to hold over tht> winter months until they arc put on the market or fed to livestoc-h. 1 hcrc is pitifully littltl information for the person who has more than a backyard garden, but less than a big farm operation. What’s more, we didn’t feel comfortable advising OKC,.,NI~' C;AI< INNING ANI' FARMING Veadcrs to consult any of the books we did find, because none of them expressed our concern for organically grown and naturally preserved and prepared toads. OR(ANIc' (;ARIIENINC, AND FARMING readers are very particular about iheir food. Lots of care, thought, and hard work go into its raising. Organic growers don’t take any shortcuts because thtly know that chtlmicals that do a quich and easy job of fertilizing soil and speeding up animals rate? If growth may increase the quantity of food produced, but only at a sacrifice in- quality, to say nothing of the possible dangers of the chemical residues found in these foods. Organic gardeners and farmers take the time and effort to raise their crops and animals in as natural an environment as possible, because they know ihat the great taste and nutritional value of a tomato or an apple or a chicken that was raised by organic methods is head and shoulders above that of their chemically grown counterparts. These people know that they have high-quality food and they want to keep it that way. They certainly don’t want to preserve it with overprocessed or highly re- fined ingredit!nts or use a method of storage that would unnecessarily dertroy any of their food’s natural qualities. In an attempt to find more complete information on natural ways to preserve homegrown food, we looked to books written years ago, when raising and preserving one’s own food without the aid of chem- ical fertilizers, sprays, hormones, medications, and additives were a real part of life for millions of American families. We found that these books are fairly complete guides to home food storage. They provide information on just about everything that could be raised in rural America. Unfortunately, these books are long out of print, and al- though some copies might exist in small public libraries, secondhand bookstores, and in the homes of rare book collectors, they are hard to find. In addition, a lot of the information in these old books is datrd. Old books don’t include modern methods of food preservation wh.?h have added so much to thp case and safety of home food storage. llampered by a lack of modern equipment, like steam-pressure can- ners and home frcei:crs, and a limited knowledge of nutrition, farmers in the past had to rely on methods of food storage that did not"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xii Intronllctiorl always do the best job of retaining the essential nutrients of the foods they were keeping. We soon realized that if we wanted a book that was a complete guide to food storage-one that had solid information on preserving everything that could be raised on a homestead and one that would express our philosophy about organic foods-we would have to write it ourselves. And this is just what we did. We have combined what we feel to be the best of the new and the traditional methods of food preserva- tion into a book designed to be a complete guide for organic garden- ers, homesteaders, and family f;rrmers who know the satisfaction of raising and preserving their own food as naturally as possible, with- out the use of any chemicals or overprocessed ingredienls. We are grateful to many people for supplying us with informa- tion for this book. We would like to thank the Library of Congress fol helping us locate both new and long out-of-print, rare books; the U.S. Department of Agriculture and local extension stations for pro- viding us with booklets and pamphlets; and Erewhon Trading Com- pany, Walnut Acres, and other food processors and distributors for the information they have given us on the storage of natural and organically grown foods. Our most important source of information, however, was our ORGANIC GARDENING AND FARMING readers, because they are the people who are out there raising and harvesting and storing their own food. Our special thanks go to all the organic growers who contributed ideas for food preservation through the articles they have written for our magazine and through the interviews they granted us especially for this book.

Not only can you :k,oose the fruits and vegetables that you want, but you can also choose the par- ticular zrarieties of fruits and vegetables that best suit you. If you page through any seed catalog you’ll discover that each food is usually available in a YiumLer of varieties. Some of these varieties may be particularly good for freezing; others maintain their quality best when canned. Other varieties have been designed for drying, and some hold their flavor and texture well in underground storage. If you’re planning to preserve a good part of your harvest, you’d do well to decide how you will store your garden surplus before you order your seeds, and then c-hoose those fruit and vegeta- ble varieties developed specifically for your :nethod of storage. Some of the more popular fruits Jnd vegetables, like tomatoes, sweet potatoes, lima beans, bzcts, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, cauliflower, apples, blueberries, and strawberries are available iI1 varieties particularly high in vitamin content.

Vitamins are organic food substances--that is, substances existing only in living things, plant or animal. Ai- though they exist in foods in minute quantities, they are absolutely necessary for proper growth and the maintenance of health. Plants manufacture their own vitamins. Animals manufacture some vita- mins and obtain some from plants or from other animals that eat plants. Vitamins are not foods in the sense that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are foods. They are not needed in bulk to build muscle or tissue. However, they are essen tiai, iikc hormones, in regulating body processes. As in the case of trace minerals (iodine, for instance), the presence or absence of vitamins in very small amounts can mean the difference between good and bad health. Many diseases and seri- ous conditions in both human beings and animals are directly caused by a specific or combined vitanlin deficiency. The green leaves of plants an! the laboratories in which plant vitamins arc manufacturtld. So the green leaves and stalks of plants arc’ full of vitamins. Foods that are seeds (beans, peas, kernels of wheat and corn, etc.) also contain vitamins which the plant has pro- vided to nourish the next generation of plants. The ican meat of animals contains vitamins; the organs (heart, liver, etc.) contain even more, which the animal’s digestive svstcm has stored there. Milk and the yolk of eggs contain vitamins which the mother animal provides for her young. Fish store viLirniiis chietly in their livers.

Researchers have established approximate estimates of the daily allowances of most of the vitamins needed to maintain health. These amounts are usually spoken of in terms of milligrams. (A milligram is 111000 of a gram. A gram is .I/32 of an ounce.) You may also find daily vitamin allowances expressed in terms of International Units, Vegetables are an especially valuable source of many of the vita- mins. Yellow and green leafy vegetables, along with tomatoes, con- tain appreciable amounts of carotene, the plant substance which is changed into vitamin A in the body. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is plentiful in tomatoes, peppers, and many of the raw leafy vegetables. While potatoes have only a fair amount of ascorbic acid, the quan- tities in which they are eaten by many people make them a material source of it. Several of the B vitamins, too, are present il variety of vegetables.

This means that you can harvest fruits and vegetables when they have reached just the right stage of maturity for eating, canning, freezing, drying, or under- ground storage, and you don’t have to lose any time in getting the food from the ground into safe keeping, either. The desired stage of maturity can vary from food to food and depends a great deal on what you intend to do with the produce once you’ve harvested it. In most cases, vegetables have their finest flavor when they are still young and tender: peas and corn while they taste sweet and not starchy; snap beans while the pods are tender and fleshy before the beans inside the pods get plump; summer squash while their skins are still soft. Carrots and beets have a sweeter flavor, and leafy vegetables will be crisp, but not tough and fibrous, when they are young. This is the stage at which you’ll want to preserve their goodness. Fruits, on the other hand, are usually at their best when ripe, for this is when their sugar and vitamin contents are at their peak. If you’re going to can, freeze, dry, or store them, you’ll want them firm and mature. But if you plan to use your fruits for jellies and pre- serves, you will not want them all fullv ripe because their pectin content-which helps them to gel- decreases as the fruit reaches maturity. In order to make better jellies some of the guavas, apples, plums, or currants vou are using should hc less than fully ripe. It is nearly impossible to control just when your peaches, pears, apples, and berries will be mature. Once planted, fruit trees and berry plants will bear their fruit year after year when the time is right. 32"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"You’re at their mercy and must be prepared to harvest just when the pickings are ready if you want to get the fruit at its best. Vegetables are a different story. Because most are annuals and bear several weeks after they are planted, you can plan your garden to allow for succession plantings that extend the harvesting season for you and furnish you with a continued supply of fresh food at the right stage of maturity. This means eating fresh vegetables for the whole time your garden is producing and having vegetables just right for preserving several times-not all at once-for off-season months. By planting three smaller crops of tomatoes instead of one large crop, you won’t be deluged with more tomatoes than you can possi- bly eat and process at one time. Space your three pea plantings ten days apart in early spring and you’ll have three harvests of peas and still plenty of time to plant a later crop of something else in the same plots after all the peas are picked. Vegetables like salad greens that do not keep well should be planted twice. Plant early lettuce about a month before the last frost and follow it with cauliflower. After the onions are out of the ground, put some fall lettuce in iheir place for September salads. If corn is one of your favorites and you’ve been waiting out the long winter for the first ears to come in, by all means, eat all the early-maturing corn you want, but make sure that enough late corn has been planted for freezing later on. Vegetables that keep well stored fresh at low temperatures, like cabbage, squash, and the root crops, should be harvested as late in the season as possible so you won’t have to worry about keeping vegetables cool during a warm September or early October. Some vegetables like carrots, parsnips, and Jerusalem artichokes can be left right in the ground over the winter. It is wise to plant some late crops of these vegetables. Snap beans, planted in early May, can be fol- lowed by cabbage in mid-July. Beets planted in the beginning of Aprii may be t’ollowed by carrots in July that can be stored right in the ground over the winter and into the early spring. The charts that follow will give you a gOOd idea as to the right time to harvest and how best to harvest for good eating and good keeping.

HARVESTING FRUITS Fruit How and When to Harvest Apples Apricots Blackberries and Boysenberries Blueberries Summer apples are picked when ripe, and should be used or preserved at once. They usually do not store well for more than a few days. Pick fall and winter apples at peak ripe- ness for best storage. Pick with the stems; if stems are removed, a break in the skin is left which will let bacteria enter and cause rot. When picking apples, be careful not to break off the fruiting spur, which will bear fruit year after year if undamaged. Apricots should be left on the tree until fully ripe, because once they are picked they do not increase their supply of sugar. For drying, they should be ripe and firm. Berries are ripe when they fall readily from bush into the hand, a day or two after they blacken. Berries should be picked in the cool of the morning, kept out of the sun, and re- frigerated or processed as soon as possible. Blueberries shoulc: be left on the bush several days to a week after they turn blue. When fully ripe they are slightly soft, come easily from the _ bush, and are sweet in flavor."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"38 Vqctnbks rlmf Fruits Cherries Currants Dates Gooseberries Grapes Guavas In order not to damage the fruiting twigs, cherries should be picked without the stems. This will leave a break in the fruit; therefore the picked cherries must be processed at once or else spoilage will begin. If sour cherries are protected from birds with netting, fruit should be allowed to ripen on tree for 2 to 3 weeks. The longer it hangs, the sweeter it becomes. The longer currants hang, the sweeter they be- come, so leave on bush for 4 to 6 weeks, unless you plan to make jelly from them. Then pick some of them when still a little green because they lose their pectin content as they ripen. In dry weather dates should be left on the trees until they dt’c7 thoroughly ripe. If the weather becomes wet, they must be picked before any rain touches them. The ripening process is then finished indoors. Because gooseberries of one variety all mature at the same time, they may be harvested in one day. The picker usually wears heavy leather gloves and strips the branches of their fruit by running his or her hand along the whole branch, catching the berries in an open container, such as a bushel basket. The small pieces of leaf and stern may be separated by rolling the fruit down a gentle incline made by tipping a piece of wood or cardboard. The leaves and stems will be left on the incline alld the moderately clean fruit roils to the bottom. Grapes should be picked when fully ripe. The fruit will be aromatic and sweet, and the stem of the bunch will begin to show brown areas. Grapes that are to be stored should be picked in the coolest part of the day. Clip the bunches from the sterns with sharp shears and handle them by the stems rather than by the fruit. Guavas ripen in a period of about 6 weeks. If they are to be used for jelly or juice, some of them may be picked before they are quite ripe. They contain such a large amount of pectin that a pound of fruit will make more than 3 pounds of jelly."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Oranges Color is not always d sign of maturity in oranges. Their skin contains a mixture of pig- ments: green, orange, and yellow. In the fall the green predominates until the weather turns cool enough to check theit, growth, when the green fades out and the other pigments predominate. But in the spring when growth begins, green pigments will again appear in perfectly ripe fruit as it hangs on the tree. Navel oranges, Valencia, and other varieties with tight skins are picked by pulling away from the stem. Those with loose skins, like mandarins, Temples, and tangerines arc picked cvith clippers which clip the fruit with about a half inch of the stem remaining. Once clipped from the tree, the remaining stub is clipped off. Peaches Peaches ,are ripe when the fruit is yellow. Fully tree-ripened fruit will have more sugar and less acid than fruit which is picked when half ripe. Don’t pull the fruit directly from the tree because it will cause a bruise which will make the fruit spoil quickly. Rather, remove the fruit from the tree by tipping and twisting it sideways. Pears Pears are harvested when they have reached their full size and the skins change to a lighter green. Seeds will be starting to turn brown at this stage, and the stems separate easily from the tree when lifted. The quality of the pears will be much better if they are picked before stony granules are formed through the flesh, during the last few wet>ks of ripening. Persimmons When fully ripe, persimmons arc very soft and are very sweet. American persimmons may be harvested just before they are ripe, or they may be left hanging on the tree into the winter months. Fruit left hanging through January, even though it is frozen on the tree, retains its tlavor when picked and thawed.

Q uinces Quinces may hang on the bush until after the first fall frost. If they are to be stored, they may be picked a few weehs earlier. Raspberries Because they bccomc soft when fully ripe, raspberries must he picked every day, or at least every other day during harvesting time. Rain at harv~sttimc causes berries to become moldy.

Handling the food after the harvest-during the time between picking and processing-is just as important. Although the actual growth of fruits and vegetables stops when they are plucked from the ground and cut off from their food supply, respiration and activity of enzymes continue. The physical and chem- ical clualities of the plants deteriorate rapidly. Not only will there be a deterioration of appearance and flavor as the freshness of food fades, there will also be a loss of nutrients, particularly of vitamin C. Fruits and vegetables should be prepared and canned, put into the freezer, dried, or placed in cold storage as soon as is humanly possible after harvest. If you cannot avoid a delay in preparing and storing, COOL your food as soon as it is picked. Do not keep it at room temperature, or, even worse, expose it to the sun. The quickest way to cool it is to immerse the food in ice water. After draining, keep the food at low temperatures, preferably between 32” and 40°F. Covering the produce with cracked ice is another means of cooling and thereby slowing down the loss of quality. These aids, of course, do not replace the need for prompt processing. Fruits and vegetables are at their best when first picked. Don’t expect any kind of storage to make a great food out of an inferior one. If you’ve taken the effort to grow good food, make the extra effort to harvest it at the right time and get it into proper storage as soon as possible."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"For many, freezing is the best way of preserving the prides of their organic gardens. Because you have to purchase a freezer and keep it running year round, freezing may cost you more money than other ways of preserving, but the money is well spent when you consider food flavor, color, texture, and nutrients, and the time you save by freezing rather than canning or drying your vegetables and fruits. A general rule to remember is that those vegetables most suited for freezing are those which are usually cooked before serving. These include asparagus, lima beans, beets, beet greens, cauliflower, broc- coli, Brussels sprouts, peas, carrots, kohlrabi, rhubarb, squash, sweet corn, spinach, and other vegetable greens. Vegetables that are usually eaten raw, such as celery, cabbage, cucumbers, lettuce, onions, radishes, and tomatoes, are least suited for freezing. Almost all fruits, especially berries, freeze very well. If you are concerned about preserving the vitamin C content in foods, do not can, but freeze those foods that supply us with most of our vitamin C. Fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C include broc- coli, spinach, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, turnip greens, strawberries, grapefruit, lemons, and oranges. The freezing process itself does not destroy any nutrients in food. However, there can be some nutrient loss during blanching of vegetables and the cooling process that takes place right before food is frozen, when food combines with the oxygen of the air and goes through a process called oxidation, or from the “drip” which results from excessive thawing. Nutrient losses can be kept at a minimum if you are quick and efiicient when blanching and freezing.

Vitamin A is lost only when vegetables art’ not blanched.

When foods are removed from freezer storage, their temperatures rise and the dormant microorganisms begin to multi- ply. Even during thawing, the process of spoilage sets in, and the higher the thawing temperature, the faster the growth of spoilage microorganisms. Thus, the microbia! population will increase at a slower rate if food is thawed at a low temperature, such as in a refrigerator, than at room temperature. Frozen foods that need to be thawed, such as those that will be eaten raw or mixed with other foods for casseroles, should be thawed in the refrigerator and not on the kitchen counter or in hot water, whenever possible. !3ecause decomposition of thawed foods is more rapid than fresh foods, they should be used as quickly as possible after thawing. Of course, if frozen food is to be cooked, there is no reason to thaw it first. Just remove it from the freezer and immedi- ately place it in boiling water or in a preheated oven and cook it frozen, before microorganisms become active. Ref reczirzg Foods still partially frozen or even those that are completely thawed but appear to be edib!e may be refrozen.

Ho7i~ nd Why to B1mcI1 Vegetclblcs If you have ever tried to freeze vegetables without first blanching them, you may have discovered the horrible cardboard flavor they acquire after a few months in the freezer. They bear no relation to the succulence of the products you hopefully packed last summer. This is the work of enzymes. Vegetables, as they come from the garden, have enzymes work- ing in them. These break down vitamin C in a short time and convert starch into sugar. They are al! slowed down (not stopped) by cold temperatures, but they are destroyed by heat-by blanching. The blanching idea isn’t new. Methods for scalding or steaming fresh produce in preparation for frcvzing were introduced over forty years ago. Since then, however, food specialists have been discovcr- ing more about the unreca!izcd and subtle effects of using this pre- cold-storage process. They have found, for example, that blanching makes certair enzymes inactive which would otherwisc C’~ILIW unnat-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"40 Vqcrr?ldt*s 17711i Fr1rits ural colors and disagreeable flavors and odors to develop while the foods remain frozen. Then too, they’ve found that blanched vege- tables are somewhat softened, so that they can be packed more easily and solidly into freezer containers. The first and foremost reason for blanching, ot course, is to help frozen produce keep better. What freezing and the right preparation for it do is literally to hold on to as much natural “freshness” as possible. There is another benefit in the blanch-freeze method. Exper- iments have shown that ascorbic acid-or, as it’s more commonly known, vitamin C-is retained in much greater amounts in many of those vegetables blanched before freezing. Some held two, three, and even four times more of this elusive element through periods ranging up to nine months. Aside from maintaining better quality, this nutri- tive advantage over vegetables frozen unblanched (or treated in other ways, such as with sulphur dioxide gas) is significant. Concentrated research on food freezing, blanching, and quality and nutrient retention was carried out at the University of Illinois College of Agriculture for several years. The University’s experiment station quarterly, ILLINUIS RESEA~~CH (Summer 1959), reported extensive experiments on the blanching questions. Five vegetables-broccoli, peas, snap beans, spinach, and corn-were picked fresh, at optimum maturity for freezing, and pro- cessed promptly. Several lots of each were used. Part of these were given preliminary preparation, blanching, cooling, packaging, frccz- ing, cand freezer storage, according to standard directions. The rest were packaged and frozen without blanching. The green vegetables were compared for ascorbic acid retention after freezer storage periods of one, three, six, and nine months. In one instance (broccoli after one month) the amount was equal. In all the others, analyses showed M-W 7jitf7mitz C 71’115 rcfai77t*d ir7 tl7c bl111~ch~~d zJt’,qCt~Illf~ t11fI11 irl flro~ frn,t~l ~~r1l~larlc/lc~tl, ar every period of testing. After three months, for example, blanched broccoli ha_i held (1-I percent of its raw ascorbic acid content, compared to S7 percent for the unblanched samples. At six months, the difference had widened to 60 to 40 percent; and by nine months, 54 to 36 percent. I’eas revealed even greater losses where blanching had been omitted. After a month, blanched specimens tested 71) percent vita- min C retention against 63 percent for the unblanched. By the third month, it was 75 to 55; six months, 71 to 36; and nine months after freezing, 70 percent to 37 percent."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"With snap beans, a larger disparity was found right at the start. Blanched beans had held 85 percent of their initial ascorbic acid after a single month in the freezer, while those unblanched had dropped back to 58 percent. In three months it was 83 to44; at six, 64 to 15; and at nine months the blanched beans still h‘ld 43 percent-and the unblanched just 3 percent. Spinach was tested after two weeks’ freezer storage and showed a 52 to 28 percent advantage for blanching. Corn, which is low in vitamin C to begin with, was not tested for retention, but was in- cluded in the cooking and palatability comparisons since it is one of the more popular vegetables for home freezing. In addition to checking for ascorbic acid variation in the blanched and unblanched produce, the Illinois research soI-lght to compare what is called /7alatal~ilit!/, too. This includes such factors as appearance, color, texture, flavor (or off-flavor), and general accepta- bility. “During the entire nine months,” states the report, “scores of blanched samples were 4.0 to 4.4, corresponding to ratings of good to high good. After cooking, the blanched vegetables were bright green and tender, and had a good flavor. No off-flavors were noted.” On the other hand, unblanched samples that had been stored for only one month received general acceptability scores of 2.4 to 2.9, which corresponds to ratings between poor- and fair. Strong off- flavors developed and unblanched products lost color during the first month in the freezer. Over the longer storage periods, the vegetables that were not blanched deteriorated still further, some of them so much that they were considered inedible. Most became faded, dull, or gray; all be- came tough or fibrous; and some, broccoli especially, developed an objectionable haylike flavor. Tests with the frozen corn disclosed palatability ratings between good and very good for the blanched samples, while none of the unblanched was considered even fair. Although the appearance and color of the unblanchrd corn had held up, its tlavor had become disagreeable and there was deterioration in texture. Steps to Follow for Freezing Vegetables To keep the largest possible amounts of vitamin C in the vf?ge- tables you freeze and to keep them tasty and appetizing, it pays to blanch carefully before frcyzing. Whether you want to store your own surplus for a healthful supply next winter or if you’d like to be sure of putting LIP enough naturally grown produce bought throughout this season, here are some tips on freezing:"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"1.

Plan a family operation deep-freeye; have all hands on deck to help quickly, and arrange equipment and contain- ers in advance for a smooth product.i.on. 3 b. Pick young, tender vegetables for freezer storage; fret&zing doesn’t improve poor-quality produce. As a rule, it is better to choose slightly immature produce over any that is fully ripe; avoid bruised, damaged, or overripe vegetables. Harvest in early morning. Try to include some of the tastiest early-season crops; don’t wait only fol later ones. . . 3 Blanch with care and without delay. Vegetables should be thoroughly cleaned, edible parts cut into pieces if desired, then heated to stop or stow down enzyme action. For scalding, use at least a gallon of water to each pound of vegetable, preheated to boiling point in a covered kettle or utensil (preferably stainless steel, glass, or earthenware). Steaming is better for some vegetables because it helps retain more nutritive value. Use a wire-mesh holder or cheesecloth bag over 1 inch of boiling water in an B-quart pot. The same ar- rangement is handy for plunging vegetables into boiling water, 1 pound at a time. Start timing as soon as basket or bag is immersed or set in place for steaming. If you live in a high altitude area, add $5 minute to blanching time for each 2,000 feet above sea level. 4. Cool quickly to stop cooking at the right point. Vegetables that are overblanched show a loss of color, texture, flavor, and nutri- tive value. Plunge blanched vegetables into cold water (below 60*F.); ice water or cold running water will do best. Organic gardener Ruth Tirrell cools her blanched vegetables by what she calls the waterless freezing method. Instead of placing vegc. tables under running water or soaking them, which can wash away water-soluble vitamins and minerals, she pours her vegetables into a flat pan which is resting on another pan filled with ice cubes and cold water. Once the vegetables are in this top pan, she covers them with an ice bag or plastic bag which is filled with ice cubes. Miss I‘irrcll cautions that this method of cooling blanched vegetables takes a lot of ice, so have a good quantity ready before you begin. - . 5 Package at once in suitable containers. Class jars require a l- to 19’.~-inch headspace; paper and plastic containers call for leaving a %-inch headspace, except for vegetables like asparagus and broccoli that pack Ioosely and need no extra room. Work out air pockets by gently running a knife around the interior sides of the containers.

Potatoes, cabbage, root crops, and squash store well in a root cellar or an outdoor storage area. Beets are preferred canned by most people. Herbs are easy to dry and conven- ient to use in dehydrated form. If your freer.er space is limited, you’d be wise to consider these alternate ways of storage. If you like to freeze mixed vegetables, we suggest that you cut and blanch each vegetable separately. Then mix and freeze them. Since blanching times vary according to the type of vegetable, blanching separately for the required time assures you that each veg- etable is sufficiently precooked.

Just cut down the amount of swectencr you use by one half. This means that % to Ii;? cup of honey is mixed with 1 pint of dry fruit when the recipe calls for I/Z to 1 cup of sugar for each pint of dry fruit. If you want to freeze your fruits in a sweet syrup, make one with honey instead of sugar. A thin to medium honey syrup is best to use with most fruits. A thin syrup can be made by blending 1 cup of honey with 3 cups of very hot water. A medium syrup can be made by blending 2 cups of honey w.ith 2 cups of very hot water. Chili ail syrups before using them. Use enough syrup to completely cover the fruit. If the fruit is packed tightly enough, $5 cup chilled honey syrup should be sufficient for pint containers and 1 cup should be enough for cluart containers. Because honey has a flavor of its own while sugar does not, it is important to use mild-flavored, light honeys for freezing (and can- ning, for that matter) unless you enjoy the taste of light, fruit-flavored honey instead of sweet frozen fruit. Early summer and spring honeys are generally milder than those collected in the fail. Clover, locust, and alfalfa honeys are certainly more suitable for freezing with fruit than dark honeys like buckwheat.

To make certain that all the fruit is submerged, stuff a piece of crumpled wax paper or foil under the container lid. This will keep the fruit below the syrup. The addition of ascorbic acid will also help to prevent discolora- tion. A tablespoon or two of YOSP hip corrctwtmte. in liquid or powder form, may bc added to pure honey or a hontxy syrup before it is poured over the packed fruit. A tablespoon or two of ~PWOH juice can be used in place of the rose hip concentrate or pectin. You can also crush 3 or 4 500-milligram nscorbic llci[f (or vitamin C) tablets in a quart of water and dip each piece of fruit into the solution before packing in honey. Try these natural sources of ascorbic acid with a small quantity of fruit first. Freeze the fruit and, after a few days, thaw it and test it to determine the amount of ascorbic acid you should use to avoid browning. Ascorbic acid has a bitter taste, so use it sparingly. You may find that the amount of honey will have to be adjusted. Thawiq Frozerr Fruits In frozen fruit, the softening of the plant tissue permits a more rapid rate of spoilage after thawing than in the corresponding fresh fruit. Fruit should be thawed at a low temperature in its original container to best retain its nutritive value, appearance, and favor.

In many households, especially in rural areas, canning is still the primary method of storing garden produce. More than 40 percent of all the families in the United States can food at home. An obvious advantage of canning is that there is practically no storage problem. You mCly can until your basement bulges, whereas your freezer space is definitely limited. And you need only invest in a pressure canner and canning jars (unless you plan to use tin cans and a sealer), both of which can be used over and over again, through many harvests. In simple terms, canning food means sterilizing it and keeping it sterile by sealing it in containers made from either glass or tin. Although commercial canning operations use tin cans almost exclu- sively, glass canning jars are preferred for home canning because they require no equipment for sealing. Sterilization is achieved by heating the food and the canning c‘ontaincr sufficiently to kill all pathogenic and spoilage organisms that may be present in raw food. ‘I‘Iw dura- tion of the processing time and the tcmpcraturc at which the food and its container are held during processing depend upon the food being canned.

Such foods must be processed at 2WF. to kill any pos- sible traces of Clostridit4m botdirzurrz. Temperatures above the boil- ing point of water (212°F.) cannot be reached under ordinary condi- tions. A pressure canner must be used to process low-acid foods so that the necessary high temperature can be obtained. Sealing the container immediately after heat processing makes it impossible for destructive organisms to invade the food and reinfect it. In addition, sealing creates a vacuum inside the container. This vacuum protects the color and flavor of the product, helps to retain the vit,lmin content, prevents rancidity LILIC to oxidation, and assists in rctarcling corrosion of tin cans and corrosion of the closures on glass j‘11.5. You can see why the success of preserving the taste, appearance, flavor, nutritional value, and safety of foods by canning depends upon the complete sterilization of foods and their containers and perfect seals.

The Tomato Controversy If you’ve been keeping ~11-7 wit canning in- h the USDA or your State Extension Service you know that in the last few years there has been some controversy about whether or not all tomatoes are acidic enough to be canned bv the tradition‘11 boiling-water bath method. Some people in the know claim that, depending upon you1 soil, climate, and the tomato varieties y0~1 grow, you may liavtt to- matoes that are slightly less acidic than are ideal for this type of processing.

As when freezing, use only fresh food in tip-top condition. Sort foods fol size and maturity so that they will heat LIP evenly and pack well. Don’t bring hot food into contact with copper, iron, or chipped enamelware. If possible, use soft water for syrups. Some foods darken or develop a gray tinge during the canning process. This is a chemical reaction between the food and the minerals in hard water or in metal utensils. Although such a discoloration doe:; not mean that the food is unfit to eat, it may make canned food unattractive. For the best results, focd should be canned quickly, preferably on the day it IS harvested. Thcrtl should bc no time lag bctwtlcn steps, so have all equipment clean and at hand before you begin. Food spoilage called ” tla t sour” can result if vcgctables, particularly starchy ones, like corn, have stood too long between steps. The canned food may look all right and smell fine, but it has an unpleas- ant, sour taste. It is not fit to eat, even though it is not poisonous. Clreckijlg Scds After processing and cooling canned foods, check their seals. Press down on the center of the lids on glass jars. If the lids do not “give” when you press on them, the jar is sealed properly. Check the tin cans by examining all seams and seals. Properly sealed cans should have flat, not bulging, ends, and the seams should be smooth with no buckling. If you suspect a container of having a faulty seal, don’t take any chances. Either discard the food or open the container and process the food over again for the required time. Labeling Co11 taim-s After processing and cooling the jars or cans, the type of food and the canning date should be marked on the top of the containers. Use the foods in the order in which they were canned. If you I~WV canned different varieties of the same food, the variety of the food (for exrlm- ple: Peaches-Elberta, or Peaches-Hale) sl~~~~ld be marked on the label so that you can compare different varieties and determine which ones best retain their taste, flavor, and appearance after canning and storage. Once canned, fruits and vegetables should bc stored in a cool, dry place for best keeping. The higher the temperature of the storage area, the more chance of vitamin loss in the canned prc)duct. The U.S."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"70 Vt~‘~‘tl7blcs 11r11i Fr14ifs Department of Agriculture tells us in the IIANIIH~KK cw A~XIC UI IIJIU~ (199) that canned fruits and vegetables will lose insignificant amounts of vitamin C when stored at 175°F. Losses are about 2 to 7 percent after 4 months and increase slowly to about 10 percent after 1 year’s time. When c,,l7ned fruits and vegetables are stored at 8O“F., however, 15 percent of the vitamin C value can be lost after 4 months, 20 percent after 8 months, and up to 25 percent after 12 months. Dodt Discmf the Liqrrid The liquid in canned fruits and vegetables is an important source of food value. If you discard it, you’re throwing out a good part of the vitamins and minerals found in the can or jar. Normally, fruit and vegetaL>le solids make ~11-7 about two-thirds of the total contents of the container; the rest is water. Soon after canning, the water-soluble vitamins and minerals distribute themselves cvcnly throughout the solids and liquid. It follows, then, that about one-third of the water- soluble nutrients are in the liquid portion. Syaild Fwd If, when opening canned food for use, you suspect that it has spoiled, do not test it by tasting it. Some spoilage bacteria, like those which cause botulism, are so toxic that a taste may be fatal. Boil the suspected food rapidly for a few minutes. If you notice dn un~isual ,lnd unappetizing odor developing, you can be certain that the food is not safe to eat. Burn the food or bury it deep enough so that no animal can uncover it and eat it. C1711lWS Boiling-Water Canner High-acid foods, which include all fruits, tomatoes, and pickled vegetables, should be processed in a boiling- water canner. Any large vessel will do for a boiling-water canner so long as it meets these requirements: It should be deep enough to have at least I inch of water over the top of the iars and an inch or two clxtra space for boiling. It should have a snug-fitting cover. And thcrc should be a rack to keep the jars from touching the bottom of the pot. If your steam-pressure canner is deep enough, you can ~stl it for L,oiling-w‘iter processing. Set the cover in place without fastening it.

Leave the jars in this water for 5 minutes. Then remove them and check for cracks around the bottom and especially along the seams. If the jars are still in perfect shape, they’re safe to use. Jars need only be tested once and, if they pass, can be used over and over. No matter what jars you use, be sure they are in good condition, clean, and sterile before packing food in them. Closures There are three types of closures for glass jars. Be sure to follow the sealing directions that come with each type of closure.

When the first edition of s ICXXI~C; UP came out in 1973, there were only three companies producing lids for the popular two-piece cap. Now, in 1977, after the canning lid shortage of a few years ago, there are at least IS companies producing lids. Most of these new lids are fine and work well, but after testing in our Fitness House exper- imental kitchen, we did discover some types of lids that did not hold the seal as well as they should. We suggest that when buying lids you check the inner scaling ring to see that it is uniform in thichness and covers the entire area of the lid that will come into contact with the jar. One thing to looh fol in d good lid is a series of concentric circles, at different levels. This form of construction allows the vacuum tu pull down the middle part of the lid, forcing the outer ring into good contact with the jar. Lid:, that do not have these rings tend to have the entire lid bow under pressure, still giving q seal, but one that is much more fragile, as less of the lid is in contact with the jar. Another point to look for in ;1 gc~od lid is the quality of the coating on the inside of the lid. Lids that do not havt~ il thil.k, uniform coating ma)’ corrode much more’ cluichl\\r than quality lids. One last feature we found desirabltt is il siii;1ll dimple in the middle of the lid.

If the company lists their name and mailing address on the package you can write them and ask for test results. Ask your local extension service’s home economist if there are any tests results avail- able on the lids. No government agency is responsible for the quality of lids. Several government agencies test the sealant used in lids for safety, but no one agency is responsible for seeing that lids work well. If you buy a new brand; of lid and you aren’t 100 percent sure of its quality, make this simple test to see how (orsif) it works: When shopping for lids pick the kind with a small dimple in the middle that tells you when a proper seal is made.

The theory behind the centers was similar to an old-fashioned barn raising, a quilting bee, or a comhusking party: when people work together using the propel equipment, a lot of work gets done quickly and fairly easily. With backyard gardens becoming popular again as a means of producing food, community canning centers began to be revived a few years ago. Canning centers are modern units designed to preserve foods using the same methods ~011 use at home, only they enable you to do large amounts of food at a time, greatly reducing the total-time and labor involved in large-scale food preservation. The Ball Corporation is one of the two companies that have developed such centers. The Ball people have redesigned their original unit that was popular in the 1940s to both reduce the costs and increase the capacity. Current Ball units (which number over 100 in the United States and several in 10 foreign countries) have the capacity to process from 200 to 2,400 quarts a day. Although estimates vary, the consensus holds that a canning center is about twice as fast as home canning. Ball’s basic community canning center has 4 pressure cookers with a capacity of 16 quarts or 24 pints each, an atmosphere cooker, a blancheristerilizer, a lo-gallon steam-jacketed kettle, a pulper/juicer, cooling tank, table car j and miscellaneous equipment. This is the basic unit, costing anywhere between $4,SOO and $6,000. Larger models are available, with up to I2 pressure cookers. Ball also has a large variety of options, from meat-cutting saws and sausage stuffers to temperature-monitoring devices to .record exact temperatures at which food is processed. (Without such a temperature-recording de- vice, low-acid foods cannot be processed for resale.) It is usually necessary to make an appointment to use the facilities. The disadvantage of lugging your prod:.rce over to the cen- ter may be more than offset by the opportunity to use first-rate equipment under ideal conditions, and, often, to have a good soci- able time, and possibly get some good advice while processing your food. To cover the yearly operating costs, 500 families would need to spend about $13 per year at the center. Most canning centers charge lO# per quart and 74 per pint for all items processed. Finding a means of finance is one of the main topics of discussion among people trying to establish a center. In most cases, it is sponsored by a cooperative, a nonprofit organization, a school, or other neighborhood group. The sponsoring group then has to find a source of financial aid. Usually funds to help purchase the unit and get the center established come"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"from local, state, or federal grants. Church, fraternal, and other local organizations all provide money, as do private industries. In lrlost cases a canning center will serve from 50 to SO0 families. As food costs continue to rise, more and more government offi- cials are looking at food preservation centers as a self-help program to help people secure good food at low prices. In some pilot centers, food stamps are used to buy canning supplies and bulk purchases of food, and canning center use is free. Estimates indicate this more than doubles a person’s food dollar. The other manufacturer of canning units is the Dixie Canner Equipment Company. They make what is actually a small-scale commercial cannery. These units cost more than the Ball units, any- where from $2S,OOO to !IXS,OOO and LIP. This unit uses tin cans instead of glass containers. The Dixie setup is capable of a much higher volume than the Ball system and has monitoring equipment to make resale of processed foods possible. The main use of the Dixie unit is in schools, with the cost being paid by both the county and the school district, and the vocational agriculture teachers instructing and running the centers. The centers are then opened to all community residents for use. The states of Virginia and Georgia both have extensive school programs with the canning centers, their use dating back to the early 1930s. The other main use of the Dixie unit is for privately owned cus- tom canneries, or cooperatively owned canneries. These operations are usually owned either by growers, consumers, or community groups. Their goal is to have more local produce sold and processed in their area instead of selling to brokers, having the food processed in large factories, and resold in the area at a high price. Most attempts at a regional food chain using small canneries are in their infancy, and it will take a few more years before the economics of such a venture are known. Although canning centers are formed for different reasons, the basic goal is always the same. By setting up a small food-processing center, you are able to can a great quantitv of food that you either grow yourself or buy directly from a grower: without a large personal investment in canning equipment.

However, foods may lose some of their food value wher. they are hot-packed because of the additional heating. Both methods are described for individual fruits and vegetables in the charts that follow this section. Canning Fruits Fruits have a tendency to darken in the canning process. To keep apricots, apples, nect,arines, peaches, and pears from darkening, the) may be placed in a solution of 2 tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar and 2 tablespoons salt to 1 gallon of water. The fruits should be dropped in this solution as soon as they are washed and sliced. Let them soak for 20 minutes, then rinse them in cold water before packing. Most people who can fruits pack them in a sweet syrup. How- ever, fruit may be canned without sweetening.

Set jars right side up to cool, making sure that they are far enough apart from one another so that air can circulate freely around them. For better circulation, place them on racks. Do not put them in a cold place or cover them while they are cooling. Keep them out of drafts. ITin cans should be cooled quickly in cold water, using as many changes of water as is necessary. Remove cans from the water while they are slightly warm so that they will dry in the air. 1 Canning Vegetables Pscyarirlg Your Vcgctablcs It is not necessary to precook or blanch vegetables intended for canning as you do for freezing and drying, since the enzymes that would otherwise break down the food are killed by the heat in the canning process. Vegetables may be packed salted or unsalted. The small amount of salt used in canning does not prevent spoilage; it is only used as a seasonins. Can unsalted vegetables just as salted ones.

But in the last several years many people have rediscovered drying fruits, vegetables, and herbs as a perfect and natural storage method, one that is low cost and energy efficient. Nothing is added, and only water is taken away. The drying process removes 80 to 90 percent of the moisture content so that spoilage bacteria can’t develop during storage. Dried food conserves storage space. Four pounds of fresh food will yield approximately 1 pound of dried. You can dry food from your garden .trith what was once common knowledge. Drying is not difficult, but to have a good dried product you must follow directions carefully. The faster you work, the higher will be the vitamin content of the dried food, and the better the flavor and cooking quality. In the drying process, most of the water content is, of course, removed. Dried fruit is sweeter than fresh, due to the high concentra- tion of fruit sugar. On a pound-for-pound basis, the dried food then has a substantially increased concentration of many nutrients, espe- cially minerals. However, there is a loss of vitamins. Some, like vita- mins A, E, and many B vitamins, are broken down by oxygen or light. Vitamin C is destroyed by heat, and heat also hastens thi action of oxygen on other vitamins. Tmp~mtm~ otui VcrM7tioil Temperature is the factor of greatest concern to people concerned about nutrient loss in the drying process. And there is much con- troversy about what is the ideal temperature. The dispute ranges from W to ‘145°F. At the higher temperatures, less oxygen passes over 95"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"the food since drying time is much faster. But at the high tempera- tures, the rate of oxidation is faster, too. Lower temperatures seem to save more vitamins, but at very low temperatures (90°F. or so) mold or bacteria can spoil the food right in the dryer in humid climates. A popular low-medium temperature is 110°F. There’s one more factor to consider in choosing a drying temper- ature. The enzymes naturally present in the foods will continue to work slowly even after drying is finished. Eventually they too will change the color and flavor of the food. Temperatures around 140°F. will destroy a lot of these enzymes and keep palatability high for long-term storage. On short-term storage, however, there’s no argu- ment. Low drying temperatures will keep foods fine for h to 9 months. For fast, efficient drying, good ventilation is essential!. The aim is not to heat the food, but to remove moisture from it. The more warm, dry air moving over the maximum surface area the better. This is why the best drying trays are those that let air through; top and bottom, and also why dryers should be well ventilated. Drying on Trays Outdoors The cheapest and usually easiest way to dry is to let the sun do all the work. But drying outdoors works well only if you live in an area that enjoys long, hot, sunny days of low humidity. And only if you live in an area that has clean, unpolluted air. If you can’t depend upon several good drying days in a row or you live in an industrial area or near a heavily traveled highway, perhaps you ought to move on to the next section and read about indoor drying. If drying is to be done outdoors, plan to set the food out early in the morning so that it won’t be too wet the first night. Place the trays in a comparativelv dust-free location, on racks raised above the ground. Raising the racks permits air to circulate freely under as well as over the food. This free air movement under the racl:s is very important if you’re covering the racks with a solid material, like glass or polyethylene sheeting. Although both glass and plastic don’t allow for much air circulation above the food, they are good in that they allow you to take advantage of the greenhouse effect. That is, captur- ing heat from the sun’s radiation and holding it in. You’ll find that drying under glass or polyethylene is good in areas of higher humid- ity and lower temperature where you need all the help you can get. Be careful, however, when using glass or polyethylene in hot, dry areas,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Window screens Clean window screens also make suitable drying trays. Cover them with paper and then place food only one piece deep on the screens or trays for best results. as the excessive heat buildup around your food could actually cook or burn it! To increase air circulation when using glass or polyethylene, raise the cover slightly with blocks and cover the open- ing gap with screening or netting to keep bugs out. If the trays are not protected by polyethylene or glass, they must be covered at night to prevent dew from settling on the food. Put them in a sheltered place or cover them with cardboard (cartons are fine), heavy towels, an old shower curtain, or anything that will keep moisture out. Obviously, if you expect rain, make sure the cover is really waterproof. And cover tightly, as many insects are nocturnal and will try to get into the food after the sun goes down. Be sure to exclude insects and animals from the drying area. Turn the food often, and dry only on sunny days. When the food is dry enough to bring in, try to do it in the heat of the day, on a hot day. Any insects that might be on the food are driven off by the heat to a shadier, cooler area. Just about anything that has a good-sized flat surface can work ;1s a drying tray, but the best trays are those that have ventilated bot- toms made of cheesecloth or wooden slats. Although convenient, wire mesh or urindow screening shc~uld not he used r~lot~c. The metal can interact with the food (especially high-a,:id foods like fruits and tomatoes) and either destroy some of the vitamins or introduce a questionable metal onto the food itself.

Checse~loth tacked and stretcbhed over wood frame Wood frame 34” x 34” String to add support to cheesecloth You can make a drying tray such as this from spare lumber, string, and cheesecloth or wire mesh. Place food directly on the cheesecloth, but, if you are using wire mesh, put brown paper or freezer wrap over the wire before placing the food on it. Then put the entire tray on rocks or wooden blocks to allow air to circulate over and under the food. If you plan to dry your food outdoors you may want to make vour trays so that they’ll fit into your oven or a food dryer, too, just in case you hit a rainy spell and decide to dry indoors instead or become impatient with the sun and want to speed things LIP with extra, controlled heat. ‘Trays made especially for drying food may be pur- chased, but they are easy to make. Construct wooden frames and stretch fiberglass or nylon mesh or cheesecloth over them. Clean sheeting or other thin material can also be used. While sturdier than checsecioth, it won’t let as much air circulate around the food. If you’re using cheesecloth, make the frames at least an inch or two under 36 inches, as most cheesecloth comes in bolts that are 3 feet wide. ‘Illt~ mesh or cheesecloth should LV reinforced underneath with string that is tacked diagonnllv betwtlcn the corners of each frame.

It does not, however, protect food from moisture. Put trays outside on sunny days after the morning dew has settled, and cover them or bring them indoors at dusk to protect the food from the evening dew. Drying Indoors When the atmosphere is dry and sunny, drying may bc ac- complished outside, but when heavy dews and frequent rains are normal, drying must be done indoors in an oven, in an attic, or in a specially constructed dryer. Drying with controlled heat in dryers or in a kitchen oven has several advantages. The drying goes on day and night, in sunny or cloudy weather. Controlled heat dryers shorten the drying time and extend the drying season to include late-maturing varieties. Vege- tables dried with controlled heat cook LIP into more appetizing dishes than do sun-dried vcgctables and have a higher vitamin A content and a better color and flavor.

Some competitors complain of wood’s tendency to warp and absorb odors, but R and D didn‘t notice these problems during their short testing period. Inefficiently utilizing heat, both sheet metal and aluminum dryers can get as hot as an oven door after the turkey’s been roasting a few hours. But on the positive side, metal won’t warp, it is easy to clean, and it won’t absorb odors. The difference in weights of compa- rable wooden and metal dryers is surprisingly insignificant. Running Cost Choosing a d.ier which makes as efficient use of expended energy as possible saves you money and saves the world some energy. To make that choice you need to know the current price of electricity, the number of watts the dryer draws, and the amount of drying space the dehydrator provides. Here’s a formula which puts all dryers on a fairly equal basis for comparison, assuming drying time is the same: watts y 3.75@kwh + sq. ft. of drving spase = @hr. sq. ft. Using this formula, you will see that a dryer’s size doesn’t au- tomatically tell you how much it will cost to dry your food. Though a small dryer may cost one-fourth as much to run per hour JS a larger dryer, it may take so many more hours to dry the same amount of food that this one will actually cost more to use. Dryers will differ this way, so check the formula on all of them. If you’re going to get an electrically run dryer, we suggest that you try to buy one with a manually operated thermostat. Not only does a thermostat let you dry at your favorite temperature, it lets you keep it there, and that is a help. One dryer R and D worked with didn’t have one. The temperature was controlled by leaving the dryer drawers open a bit. Twice the temperature soared to a scorching 176°F. and burned the food. Even after the testers got used to the unit they still found they couldn’t walk away from the dryer for more than 2 hours at a time. Fans and Air Flow For fast, efficient drying, a fan to improve venti- lation is a must. Your aim in drying is not to hnat the food but remove moisture from it. The way to do that is to get warm, dry air moving across as much surface area of the food as possib!e. You will find"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Elecfriccr!

Here are some of the (:ommerr:ially available electric food dryers Rodale’s Research and Development Group tested."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":". basically two air flow systems to choose from. vertical and horizontal . The horizontal system is preferred from R and D’s point of view because it keeps air moving across both the rap and underside of the food (provided you don’t use SoiA shelves) lnste‘ld of up through the dryer between the pieces of food. You’ll find manufacturers emphasizing air flow recycling sys- tems as a big selling point on their dryers. Such recycling systems are supposed to cut down on the amount of air allowed to leave the unit, retain more heat, put less strain on the heating unit, conserve energy, and improve drying efficiency. Shelf Construction Shopping for shelves you’ll find almost as many different types available as there are dryers. A popular style uses an aluminum frame to support a thin mesh nylon screening without support underneath. Easy to clean and lightweight, these are hot to handle fresh osi of a hot dryer. If consistently overloaded with moist heavy fruits, they will stretch. Wooden frames are a bit harder to clean. Some shelves are made of expanded metal or heavy plastic and have a pattern such as you’d find on a radiator cover. The great thing about these is their sturdiness, but the holes are so big that some foods will fall through. Covering the shelf with plastic yvrap or nylon netting is a big help in such cases. Plastic wrap can be hard lo work with, so plan to have an extra set of hands handy and tape it to the shelf. Other shelves are made of solid wood or metal and are the least desirable. Air has no way of getting to the underside of the food SO the drying process is slowed and the food needs to be turned. Most shelves of this type don’t have turned up edges to keep things like peas and grapes from rolling off. It’s a trick to balance rolling peas on an edgeless shelf, too! Warning: When buying any kind of plastic shelf, make sure it is FDA food quality approved and that it will withstand high tempera- tures. Hardware cloth and aluminum screening will lose some of its metallic finish to the food. Miscellaneous Don’t let cute little extras cloud your evaluation. On-off switches mean nil. Timers are nice, but remember, you are drying by the hour, not the minute. Warranty times are not indicative of the product’s quality.

The unit has s square feet of drying space, small compared to electric dryers but certainly enough for drying odds and ends. With regular use this dryer will provide enough dried food to fill up your pantry in no time. It’ll take a little time until you know just how to regulate heat under the dryer. On R and D’s first trial run, the testers forgot to grease the top and applied enough heat to cook the food in an hour. After that disaster it didn’t take them long to catch on. No gadgets are provided with stove top dryers to improve venti- lation, but then the food isn’t confined within a box either. Left exposed, moisture is carried away by air currents rising from the heat of the stove and by the dry breeze coming in a nearby window. Solnr Dyers Most solar drying units commercially available, including collec- tois, racks, trays, ventilated cold frames, and hoods, are relatively inexpensive, especially compared to electrical units. There’s a reason-a simple design. If you are the least bit handv, you can build your own. A hood dryer is little more than a plastic frame placed over your drying food to intensify the sun’s radiant energy. It keeps dust, rain, and insects away front the food, but the open sides let dampness in if left outside overnight. Use opaque plastic to keep the food out of direct sunlight. Enclosed solar collector dryers with controlled ventilation are about the best you can do going 100 percent solar. The balance be- tween tetnperature and air flow is a delicate one, and success depends a lot on the operator. The frame should be airtight except for vents so you can direct air tlow through the dryer. It will be useful to have a thermometer installed inside. A regular outdoor thermometer doesn’t usually go up high enough, so see if you can find one to handle at least 150°F. (not that you want it that high, but just to keep track if it does). Again, a black cover will encourage warmer temperatures and keep food out of the sun. Make sure that vents can be securely closed overnight so you aren’t bothered moving trays in and out.

The simple materials you’ll need are a topless cardboard oi woodell box at least 8 inches deep; one or more 60-watt bulbs; a socket base and cord; a stainless steel cookie sheet or piece of a stainless steel sheet cut to fit the box; some tinfoil; and a few brush- fuls qf black paint. Start by painting the bottom of the cookie sheet or metal sheet black for maximum heat absorption. While it’s drying, line your box with tinfoil, shiny side up. Then place your bull) setup in the center of the box, angling the bulb at 45”. (To help diffuse heat evenly, you might also ptit a little tinfoil “shade” on the top of the bulb.) After notching the top corner of the box so the cord can exit, place the tray over tile box (black side down) so it is t;uspended a few inches over the light bulb. Then coat the tray with a little vegetable oil to prevent the food from sticking to it (or put a layer of nylon or fiberglass netting or cheesecloth over the tray), fill the tray with a layer of sliced fruit or vegetables, and plug it in. In about 12 hours (more time on a high humidity day; much less time for herbs and foods cut into fairly small pieces; and perhaps longer for high-moisture foods like most fruitsj, you’ll have a trayful of dried goodies for storage or snacking. R and D’s prototype dryer features a cardboard frrllt box i2 x I8 inches and 8% inches deep. The I-inch-deep cookie sheet, which fits the top exactly, was purchased at a hardware store and will hold about 1% pounds of raw prepared food.

Fruits In most commercial drying G;Terations, apricots, apples, and peaches are usually sulphured, but while sulphured fruit will retain more of its original color than unsulphured fruit and feel less leath- ery, the suiphuring prtIcess requires some special equipment and extr.1 time and work. More importantly, sulphured fruit may impart a slightly sour or acid taste and a questionable chemical to the diet. If-you wish to pretreat f uits like apricots, apples, and peaches for drying we suggest that you dip them in an ascorbic acid solution. You can prepare a solution by crushing three or four 500-milligram ascorbic acid (vitamin C) tablets, or 1,500 :o 2,000 milligrams of pow- dered ascorbic acid, into 1 quart of water. You may also dip the fruit into unsweetened lemon or pineapple juice instead if you prefer. You’ll probably be slicing most and petltillg some fruits before you dry them. But there are some fruits-perhaps grapes, prunes, berries, cherries, apricots, and rose hips, to name a few-that you’ll only be pitting or slicing in half. Before you put these uncut fruits out to dry, we suggest that you crack their skins so that moisture inside the fruit can readily escape. There are three ways to do this: 1. Blanch them in either water (for % to 1 minute) or steam (1 to 2 minutes), depending upon the thickness of the skin and the size of the fruit. As in any other blanching procedure (see page 35), blanch only a small amount of fruit a. time and cool it immediately by plunging it in cold water. 2. Make several nicks in the skin with a sharp knife. These two above methods are best for fruits you’ll whole or pitting. For fruits that you’ll be pitting and halv next method: be leaving ing, try the 3. Take one of the halves in both hands and place both thumbs in the middle of the skin side.

Vegetables (except onions, garlic, and leeks, which are used primarily for seasoning, and mushrooms) should be blanched or pre- cooked in steam or boiling water after they are sliced tor drying. T!~is blanching sets the color, hastens drying by softening the tissues, checks the ripening process, and prevents undesirable changes in flavor during drying and storage. Vegetlblcs blanched before drying require less soaking before they are cooked for eating and have a better flavor and coklr when served. Blanching vegetables by steam- ing is preferable to blanching by boiling because nutrients are dis- solved in the boiling water. A pressL:re cooker or a large, heavy pot makes a good steamer. Place a shallow layer of vegetables, not over 2Y2 inches deep, in a wire basket or stainless steel or enamel colander. Have 2 or more inches of boiling water in the pot, set the basket on a rack above the water, cover tightly, and keep the water boiling rapidly. Heat until every piece of vegetable is heated through. If there is no convenient way of steaming, bC>iling is second best. Use a large amount of boiling water and a small amount of food so that the temperature of the water will not appreciably lower when the food is added. About 3 gallons of water to every quart of vegetables is good. Place the vegetables in a wire basket and immerse them in the boiling water for the required time, as suggested below.

Special Techniques for Dryiq Peas, Beans, IzuEmz- _ ~~-- _. ~- _ - -~~ Drying right in the garden on the vine or stock is often the easiest way of drying peas, beans, and corn, provided you have the following: I. A long growing season, so that the food can remain on the vine or stock until the pods are thoroughly dry, but before frost hits. 2. Dry weather, not wet, which might cause some beans, peas, and corn to sprout right in their pods and shatter. 3. Good timing, so that you get out and collect your dried food before the pod splits open and scatters what it’s holding all over the ground. Limas and soybeans should be watched quite carefully as they’re near the dry stage because their pods split easily once dry. Bean and pea pods can be picked when mature and spread out in shallow layers in an attic, a covered porch, or in a spare room to dry. Green or wax beans can be strung on heavy thread or string, about one-third of the way down from one end. Then blanch the whole string in steam for 20 minutes, and hang in a dry, warm place, like attic rafters, to make “leather britches.” They can be kept there until you’re ready to use them so long as the air is dry and warm enough. You can also cut the whole bean or pea plant when most of the pods are mature and hang it upside down in a dry, well-ventilated"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"p!ace, allowing the beans or peas to dry. Pinto beans arc hard to dry this last way because they cling so tighily to the poles on whic.h they climb. To shell dried beans and peas, place them in cloth bags and beat them with a mallet, or else stomp on them. The beans are then easily sorted from the shells. Soybeans and chick-peas are much tougher pods and must be shelled by hand-a lot of work, but these high- protein legumes are well worth the ePort. Before storing beans or peas, place on shallow trays in a 175’F. oven for IO to 15 minutes to kill any insect q;gs they rnav contain. Oven heating also assures that the beans or peas arc thoroughly dry. If they aren’t completely drv when they are put into storage, they ivill build up a great deal of ht*‘lt and either smolder or crumL~le. Store in sterilized glass jars, or you can put them in paper bags which are then packed in plastic bags and sealed with wire twists or in metal cans with snap-on lids. For extra protection trom weevils and other insects try putting a dried hot pepperGcX-j%?%plastic bag 07 dried beans. The husk covering corn won’t allow the kernels to dry completely on the stalk, so you’ll have to pick the corn anil remove this outer husk. Then sun or oven-dry the corn cob until the corn is hard and cannot be squeezed. Corn can be stored on the cob, but it will take up much less space and be more convenient for later use if it is shelled, pasteurized Jr heat treated, and stored lihe beans and peas. The easiest way to shell dried corn is to hold the cob between both hands and twist in opposite directions, allowing the kernels to fall into a container underneath. When Your Food Is Dry Drying is finished when fruit feels dry and leathery on the out- side, but sli&tly moist inside; beans, peas, and corn should be very hard; leafy ‘tnd thin vegetables should he brittle; and larger chunks or slices of vegetables should be leathery. If in doubt, leave the food on the trays a little longer, but reduce the temperature if you’re dry- ing with an oven or indoor dryer. Fruit seems to be moister when it is hot, so remove a few pieces from the tray occasionally and allow them to cool before you determine if they are dry. Since some pieces of food will dry faster than others, it is important to remove pieces as they dry rather than wait until every piece of fruit or vegetable is totally dehydrated to stop the drying process. Food that overheats near the end of drying will scorch easily. As we mentioned earlier,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"you should try to cut up or slice a particular fruit or vegetable as uniformly as possible, so the pieces will take approximately the same time to dry. Pasteurizing Once you think the food is dry, pasteurize it to insure thLlt no insect eggs or harmful spoilage organisms will develop; low heat may have dried the food, but it probably didn’t kill all such contaminants. Spread dried food l-inch thick on cookie sheets or trays, and heat for 10 to 15 minutes in a l75”F. oven. Then cool thoroughly. After you have pasteurized the food, store it in open glass or other open containers in a warm, dry area free of insects and animals. For four successive days stir the contents thoroughly eacll day to bring the drier particles in contact with some that are more moist. In this way the moisture content will be evenly distributed. If at the end of the four days the food seems too moist, return it to the dryer or --l!2a!edinun-iG-Ltik- ckying. s toriig When thoroughly and uniformly dry, the food should be packed in airtight, sterilized glass jars, or in plastic bags or metal cans with snap-on lids that are lined with new brown paper bags to keep food out of contact with potentially harmful compounds in the plastic or metal. If you are storing in clear glass it is very important that the storage area be dark, and if storing in paper bag-lined plastic bags, make sure the area is rodent-proof! It’s generally preferable to pack- age small quantities, enough, say, for one meal. Then if one package spoils, only a small amount of food will be wasted. Several brown paper bags of dried food can be stored inside one larger plastic bag After your food is packaged, place a label on each indicating the kind of food and the date it was packaged. Then store in a dark place in a cool (below 60°F.) dry basement or pantry. During warm, hurnici weather dried foods retain their quality best if they are kept utlder refrigeration. It is a good idea to examine dried food occasionally for mold. The danger of mold is prevented if the dried product can be stored at freezing temperatures or below. Dried foods keep well for six months to a year if they are stored properly, and longer if kept under refrigeration or in the freezer. If you discover bugs or worms in your food in late winter or early spring, don’t throw it out. Spread it in shallow pans and put it in your oven for about 20 to 25 minutes at 300°F. The heat will take care of the vermin and sterilize your food at the same time. You can also heat dried food in a low oven if it becomes too limber and moist during storage."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Rehydrating Water is taken out of tr.uits and vtige\\cibl~s ful y~esctv~~iiv~~, dnd, in most cases, you will want to put the water back in before you eat the food, Dried fruits are quite good eaten just as they are-by them- selves or chopped up in cereals an.1 desserts-but vegetables, and fruits intended for baked products and compotes, should be rehy- drated or given back the water lost during drying. To rehydrate fruits and vegetables pour .l l/2 cups of boiling water over each cup of dried food. Do not add salt to rehydrating vege- tables or sugar to fruits; both cause food to absorb less water than they normally would. Let the mixture stand until all the water is absorbed. Vegetables, except for dried beans and peas, generally ab- sorb all the water they are capable of retaining in about 2 hours. Fruits require a long&- soaking time-anywhere from 2 to several hours. Overnight soaking may be necessary for complete rehydration of some fruits and dried peas and beans. The amount of water dn\\ad foods will absorb and the time it takes for complete rehydration var- ies according to the size of the food and its degree of dryness. If the water is absorbed quickly, add more-a little at a time-until the food will hold no more. Avoid adding more water than the food can ab- sorb, since nutrients will be lost to this extra water. Rehydrated fruits need not be co(>kCd (un!ess, of course, you prefer them that way), but vegetables are always cooked after they have been soaked. To cook the vegetables, put them and any water they did not absorb in a pot. Add only enough extra water to cover the bottom of the pot. Cover and quickly bring the vegetables to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are plump and tender. If the vegetables are still tough after about 5 minutes of cook- ing or all the water is quickly absorbed by the cooking vegetables, thi?y have not been soaked long enough. Next time, extend the soak- ing time so that the vegetables are fully rehydrated before cooking. You’ll find rehydrated dried vegetables taste more like fresh vege- tables than do those’rhat have been canned. Fruits are cooked in the same manner. Soak soybeans overnight in the refrigerator, throw out their soaking water, then cook for 1 tc 2 hours in fresh liquid before using in recipes. Soybeans contain an antinutritional enzyme and should be eaten only after they are completely cooked."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"When measuring out dried foods to use in placr cjf fresh in recipes, keep in mind that one part dried fruits or vtgctablcs equals about four parts of the same fresh food. Freeze-Drying Freeze-drying seems to be an excellent way to store foods. Thz foods are substantially reduced in weii;!tt and volume and they will keep for about 2 years without much ioss in nutrients, color, or flavor. Unfortunately, freeze-drying is a sophisticated process that requires special equipment not available to most people. It is not a technique that can be carried out under normal home situations. Freeze-drying is, simply, a drying method in wl1ic.h water is removed from frozen foods. The food is first sliced, diced, powdered, granulated, or liquefied. Then it is frozen. Once frozen It is spread out on trays and placed in a vacuum cabinet. The door is closed and the pressure is !owered, creatin g a vacuum. Heat is applied, and the ice within the food disappears in the air and is taken out of the cabinet with a pump. Drying takes about IO hours (during drying the food is kept frozen) and almost all of the water is removed from the food. The moisture content is usually 2 percent or lower. The food is taken from the drying chamber and tightly packaged in a can so it will stay dry until used. Fruit Leather A variation on dried fruit slices is fruit leather. Basically, fruit leather is the pulp from juicing peaches, apricots, prunes, and apples that is dried to form a naturally sweet, confectionlike food that will keep in good condition for one year or more. Fruit leather call be made from almost any fruit or any combination of fruits. Here are a few recipes to get you started. Apricot, Peach, or Nectarine Leather 1 gallon pitted apricots, peaches, or nectarines 1 l/2 cups unsweetened pineapple juice honey 3 teaspoons almond extract (optional) Place the pitted fruit and pineapple juice in a large, heavy pot.

The more juice strained out, the quicker the process of “leather-making.” The juice is too good to discard. Can or freeze it for later or drink it fresh. Run the fruit through a blender, food mill, or sieve, removing the skins if you prefer a smooth product, or use the skins as part of the p~llp for the leather. Sweeten the pulp to taste with honey and add the almond extract if you wish. The pulp sl~o~~ld be as thick as apple butter or more so. Spread it on lightly oiled cookie sheets or cookie sheets covered with preferably freezer paper, although clear plastic wrap will do, so that it is l/II inch thick. If it is much thicker than this,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"it will take very long to dry. Cover the cookie sheets with a single layer of cheesecloth or plain brown paper to keep out dust and in- sects, and place them in a warm dry place to dry. Depending upon the weather, the pulp will dry in 1 to 2 weeks. Drying can be has- tened by placing the cookie sheets in a low oven or food dryer. If using an oven, turn the control to warm (120°F.) and leave the oven door slightly open to allow moisture to escape. When the leather is dry enough to be lifted or gently pulled from the cookie sheets, put the leather on cake racks so that it can dry on both sides. Dust the leather lightly with cornstarch or arrowroot powder when all the stickiness has disappeared, then stack the leather in layers with freezer paper, wax paper, or aluminum foil between each sheet. Cover the stack with freezer paper, wax paper, or aluminum foil and store in a cool, dry place. Prune Leather 1 gallon pitted prunes 1% cups water 3 teaspoons almond extract honey (opt ion al) Place the fruit and water in a large, heavy pot and cook over low heat until the fruit is tender. Drain off the juice and save it for a breakfast drink or punch. (It can be diluted with water, half-and-half or more.) Run the pulp through a food mill or sieve. Discard the skins-they are a little too tough to be used in the leather. Add the almond extract and honey to taste.

This mashes a limited number of apple pieces at a time, but there is no need to worry about escaping juice.) Place the ground apples and their juice in a large, heavy pot and add 1 cup of apple cider. Apples are drier than other fruit and will scorch as they are heated if no liquid is added to the pot. Place the pot over low heat and bring the apples to a boil. Add more cider if needed to prevent the apples from sticking to the bottom of the pot. If the apples are tart, add honey when the mixture looks somewhat clear and is boiling well. Then add the spices if you wish. When the mixture reaches the consistency of a very thick apple butter, remove it from the heat and spread the pcllp on oiled cookie sheets, or on cookie sheets lined with freezer paper or plastic wrap, about l/4 inch thick. Dry this apple pulp just as the other pulps were dried until it can be lifted from the cookie sheets. Then place it on cake racks so that it can dry on both sides.

Old-Fashioned Sun-Cooked Preserves Years ago, when Americans were mostly rural dwellers, sun-"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"122 Vegetnbles cd Frzrits cooked preserves were often made by country and farm women. The sweetening (they used sugar, but we’ll use honey) and the fruit were cooked together, and the mixture spread out thinly on platters or shallow trays. The trays of preserves were set out in direct sunlight for about 7 sunny days. The sun’s gentle warmth gradually ten- derized the fruit. Evaporation made the mixture thicker. The result was a thick preserve. In areas where days are sunny and hot, preserves can still be successfully “sun-cooked” in 3 to 7 days. But if weather conditions aren’t favorable, the indoor dryer or stove can take the place of the sun. Indoor drying will probably take considerably less time than 3 to 7 days, but you’ll have to experiment and find out for yourself. To make sun-cooked preserves wash and prepare fresh fruit such as berries, cherries, peaches, or pears. Fruits may be combined, if desired. Berries should be hulled. Peaches and pears should be pared. All pits or seeds should be removed. Berries and cherries, unless very large, can be left whole. Cut other fruit into pieces about the size of medium strawberries. Ctt 4 cups fruit into thin slices and put into a saucepan. Add 1 cup mild-flavored honey. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring con- stantly. Remove from heat and pour mixture irlto shallow trays. It should be about l/2 inch deep. Spreaa out pieces of fruit so they are not on top of each other. Cover the trays with cheesecloth or plastic wrap, stretched taut so it does not touch the fruit, or put a piece of glass over the top. If plastic wrap is used, fold back a small corner of the wrap, taping it securely, to assist in evaporation. If glass is used, leave a %-inch strip of the narrowest side of the pan uncovered by the glass. Put the trays out in the direct sun for 3 to 7 sunny days. Tilt the trays slightly towards the sun. Move the trays during the day, if necessary, so that the direct rays of the sun fall upon the fruit. A sunlit window sill or even the backseat of a car will do-as long as there is direct sun and it is very hot weather. Bring in the trays each night and whenever it rains. When the preserves are as thick as you want them to be, pack into sterilized jars and refrigerate or freeze. Either wild or cultivated berries are excellent for making sun- cooked preserves. This is a good recipe for using up sma!l berries. The smaller berries can be left whole, giving the preserves a nice appearance.

This flour can replace small quan- tities of wheat flour in cookie, pie crust, cake, muffin, bread, and panca kc reci PCS. Vegetable Powders These are made just like pumpkin flour. Dry your vegetables and then grind them up in a blender. Package separately to combine later, or make your own dried mixes, with or without dried herbs. Powdered vegetables, added to boiling water and allowed to dissolve for about I minute, make instarit vegetable broth. They are also good to add flavor to stews, soups, meat loaves, and casseroles. Dried Tomato Paste Drying tomato paste in the sun is a simple and satisfying way of turning a bountiful harvest into a concentrated, flavorful paste. Any tomato sauce recipe can be used, but here’s a suggestion: For every 2 pounds of ripe, cut-up tomatoes, add: l/2 large onion, chopped 1 sprig thyme, chopped 1 stalk celery with leaves, 5’4 bay leaf chopped 5 crushed peppercorns .l garlic clove, minced 2 whole cloves several sprigs chopped parsley .l teaspoon salt I sprig oregano, chopped Italian plum tomatoes are best, but other types can be substi- tuted.

Now, 2 or 3 cups at a time, puree the sauce in the blender, and then put it through a sieve if you wish. Put the pot of strained pulp back on the stove, but turn the heat to low so that it doesn’t scorch. Simmer very slowly, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pulp is reduced by one-half and quite thick. This will take several hours. Next, spread the pulp l/2 inch thick on plates or stainless steel cookie sheets and put out in the sun. As it starts to dry, cut through the paste in a criss-cross pattern, to allow air to penetrate as much as possible. Protect it from insects lvith a storm or screen window, a piece of cheesecloth, or netting. A day or two of hot sun will dry the pulp to the stage where you can scrape it off the plates and form it into nonsticky balls. If you don’t live in a sunny climate, you can dry the paste in a warm oven or even in a light bulb-heated box. (See Drying Indoors, earlier in this chapter.) After the paste is rolled into balls, let them dry for a day more at room temperature, and then store them in a tightly lidded jar. To use, dilute with a little boiling water or stock, or add a couple to a batch of minestrone or spaghetti sauce. Herbs Leaves, seeds, tlowers, and even roots of many plants can be collected and dried in the time-honored way, to add distinctive tlavor and aroma to many foods all year round. Hn rzwsfing nmi Dt-ying Htd Ltwxs Herb leaves are cut when the plant’s stock of essential oils is at its highest. In the leafy herbs-basil, savory, chervil, and marjoram- this occurs just before blossoming time. Lemon balm, basil, parsley, rosemary, and sage can be cut as many as four times during the outdoor growing s&son. Cutting should be dot-w on the morning of a day that promises to be hot and dry. As soon as the dew is off the plants, snip off the top growth-perhaps t-, inches of stem below the flower buds. If the Ir;lves are clean, do not wash them; some of the oils will be lost in the rinsing process. If the leaves are dusty or have been thickly mulched, however, wash them briefly under cold water. Shake off any excess water and hang the herbs, tied in small bunches, in the sun, just until the water evaporates from them."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Before the sun starts to broil them, take them in and hang them in a warm, dry place which is well ventilated and free from strong light. Traditionally, herbs were hung above the mantles of kitchen fireplaces or in attics. Herbs are tied and hung leaves down so that the essential oils in the stems will flow into the leaves. To prevent dust from accumulating on the drying leaves, place a brown paper bag with many holes punched in it for circulation around the leaves. Gather the bag together at the stems and close it with string, a rubber band, or wire tie. A paper bag will also shade the leaves from direct light which would otherwise darken the leaves unnecessarily. Sage, savory, oregano, basil, marjoram, mint, lemon balm, and horehound are best dried in this fashion. The leaves from thyme, parsley, lemon verbena, rosemary, and chervil may be removed from the stems and spread in a single layer to dry in indoor or outdoor dryers used also for fruits and vegetables. Be certain, though, that the screen or netting on the tray is very fine so that no leaves can fall through its openings. For best flavor, the tem- perature inside the dryer should stay under 105°F.

You may spread the pods one layel thick on drying trays just as you do the leaves. When they seem thoroughly dry, rub the pods between the palms of your hands, and the seeds should fall out easily. You can also dry the seeds by hanging the whole plant upside down inside a paper bag to dry. As the seeds dry and fall from the pods, the paper bag will catch them. Hnrzwsfiq ami Dnyirzg Htd Fhws Flowers to be used in cookery are cut on the first day they are opened. If petals alone are used, they are removed from the calyx and spread on a tray. Rose petals should ha.ve their claws-the narrow white portion at the base of each petal-removed. Flower heads used for tea, like camomile, are dried whole. Hwvcstitlg mu-l Dnyiq Roofs The roots of certain plants, particularly angelica, burdock, com- frey, ginseng, ginger, and sassafras, are highly aromatic and can be dried and cut for candy, teas, and cold beverages. These roots are much thicker than the delicate seeds, flowers, and leaves of other plants, and the drying process is a long one. So as not to injure the plant, roots should be dug out and cut off during the plant’s dormant stage, when there is sufficient food stored in the plant cells. This is usually during the fall and winter months. Cut off tender roots -never more than a few from each plant. Scrub them with a vegetable brush to remove all dirt. If the roots are thin, they may be left whole, but for quicker drying, thick roots should be sliced lengthwise. Place one layer deep in any indoor or outdoor dryer. Storifzg the Hc~6s Leaves may be crushed before being stored away, but they retain their oils better if they are kept whole and are crushed right before they are used.

At the end of that time, examine the jars. If there is moisture on the inside of the glass or under the lid, remove the contents and spread it out for further drying. Checking the jars is especially important if you are storing dried roots because it is dif- ficult to know when they are completely dry. If further drying is not done, there is a strong chance that mold will develop, and the leaves, seeds, flowers, or roots will not be fit to use. Do not store herbs in cardboard or paper containers, because these materials absorb the oils and leave the dried herbs tasteless. Ideally, herbs should be stored in a cool place, out of strong light, either in dark glass jars, in tins, or behind cabinet doors. Storing herbs in dried form is so popular because it is a simple means of preservation which produces a product that can be conven- iently used in the kitchen. Dried herbs can be taken from their jars just as they are needed, to be mixed with foods while they are cook- ing or just before they are served. However, the fresh quality of the just-picked herb is lost in the drying process. This is particularly true of chervil, borage, burnet, chives, parsley, and basil. For this reason, some people prefer to preserve some of their herbs by other methods, like freezing (see page 53) and preserving in vinegar (page 248). While herbs are usually stored separately, there are advantages to storing some herbs in combination. During storage, the distinct aromas and flavors of the different herbs are given a chance to blend together and form delightful herb mixtures that can be sprinkled on foods or tied in cheesecloth and plunged in soups and stews while they are simmering. Below you’ll find some recipes for popular herb combinations. It is important that you do not mix fresh herbs with dried herbs when measuring out for recipes unless you remember that 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs equals l/2 teaspoon of dried herbs or l/4 teaspoon of dried powdered herbs. Fines Herbes Fines herbes are a mixture of finely ground fresh or dried herbs that is sprinkled on food in the last few minutes of cooking or added to the food just before it is placed on the dinner table. Fines herbes can be made from equal parts of any of the following herbs: basil, celery seed, chervil, chives, marjoram, mint, sweet savory, parsley, sage, tarragon, and thyme, Fines herbes are usually served in or on sauces, soups, cheese dishes, and t’gg entrees."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"128 Vqehbles mti Fruits Bouquets Garnis Bouquets garnis are a mixture of dried herbs which are tied in a cheesecloth sack or put in a spice ball and plunged into a stew or soup to be left in the food while it is cooking.

Wrapped cabbages should be stored in boxes or bins at a just above freezing temperature in a cool, damp area. When stems and roots are left on, any of the outdoor storage areas that are made all or in part of damp sand or soil are effective. Cab- bage emits a strong odor during storage that is usually not welcome in the house, so most people prefer to store it in one of the many outdoor storage arrangements. Celery Celery is best maintained by pulling the crop. Leave the tops dry, do not wash. The roots should be placed in slightly moist sand or soil, and the plant maintained at 32” to 34°F.

After this period, tem- peratures between 34” and 41°F. are necessary to prevent sprouting. The lower temperatures tend to turn starch to sugar and sweeten the vegetable. Only experience with the crop will enable you to determine proper storage in your area. During the storage period, moisture should remain high. Never store with apples.

Of the ones that do-most notably apples and pears-the varieties vary in keeping quality, and it is best to plan to grow good-keeping varieties if you know that you will be storing many of them. If the fruit you wish to store is not listed here, refer to the chap- ters on canning, freezing, drying, and juicing for alternative preser- vation methods. Apples These are among the better-keeping fruit. The Winesap and Yellow Newton are among the best apples, frequently lasting from 5 to 8 months satisfactorily. Next in keeping quality are the Stayman-Winesap, Northern Spy, York Imperial, Arkansas Black Twig, Baldwin, Ben Davis, and Rome Beauty. Normal storage ranges from 4 to 6 months with these varieties. Jonathan, McIntosh, Cortland, and Delicious (red or golden) can be kept for shorter periods. There are other factors that influence keeping qualities of different apple varieties such as locality (McIntosh apples grown in New En- gland store better than those grown in the Middle Atlantic states), seasonal conditions, maturity when picked, and length of tirnc bc- tween picking and storing. Good keeping qualities are increased with careful handling to prevent bruising.

Grapes should be cooled to 50°F. as soon as possible after picking and spread out in single layers. Allow the fruit to remain in this condi- tion until the stems shrivel slightly. Then place the grapes in trays no more than 4 inches deep in a cellar which is slightly humid and has a temperature of about 40°F. Stored this way, grapes will keep several months. Florida oranges may be kept 8 to 10 weeks at 30” to 32°F. with 85 to 90 percent humidity. California oranges can be kept 6 to 8 weeks at 35” to 37”F., but are subject to rind disorders at lower temperatures. This fruit will keep 2 to 3 months if picked before it is thoroughly ripe and if held in a cool, moist storage area. Peaches are fairly perishable and may be stored only several days to 2 weeks in a cool cellar. These can be held from 8 weeks to several months, depending upon variety.

Where and in What to Store While many of the storage ideas ihat follow art’ suitable for fruit storage, fruit should never be stored with potatoes, turnips, or cab- bagc. The gases released from apples during respiration can cause potatoes to sprout. Cabbage and turnips can transmit their odor to apples and pears. (Wrapping apples and pears in paper or packing them in maple leaves in barrels is recommended if these fruits must be stored with cabbage and turnips, because these materials will prevent absorption of such odors.) Constant air circulation in fruit storage is essential to remove gaseous substances, such as ethylene and volatile esters, which, if they linger, can speed up the ripening process. In most storage areas there is a need for small containers.

Shriveling may be prevented: 1. By keeping the air quite moist throughout the storage room. 2. By protecting the vegetables either by wrapping them or putting them in closed containers. 3. By adding moisture directly to the vegetables now and then. If the first method is used, provide a layer of coarse, well-washed gravel, 3 inches thick, on the basement floor. The pebbles should be about equal in size. The shelves and all other equipment are then placed on the gravel. Whenever the cellar air gets too dry (a hygrome- ter will tell) the gravel is sprinkled with a watering can. Care must be taken, however, that no surplus water is left on the floor. The wet gravel on the floor will evaporate much more water than it \\v:ould if it were on the rloor alone, the gravel having a much greater surface area. This sprinkling has to be repeated when the relative humidity of the air falls below 80 percent, and for this reason a water- ing can should always be kept in the cellar. It must be said that one sprinkling usually goes a long way, especially when the cellar is filled to capacity. Garden-fresh produce releases a considerable amount of humidity, any surplus of which can usually be removed with moder- ate ventilation. However, harsh and prolonged ventilation, open doors, insufficiently insulated walls and doors, or a sudden change of outdoor humidity can disturb this balance and make water sprin- kling necessary. Only those vegetables which require moist conditions may be stored successfully this way. Vegetables like onions, pumpkins, and squash must be stored in some other location where the air is drier. Moist storage rooms are not well suited for canned foods because can lids and metal cans or other metal containers will rust readily. H dry storage room is more satipfactory for canned foods and also vegetables which prefer a dry place. Root crops like carrots, which shrivel easily, may be stored in a dry room by adding water directly to the vegetables when needed or by placing them in closed contain- ers.

If stored in this way, sand or other materials are not needed to prevent shriveling. Those gardeners who prevent excessive shriveling by adding water directly to the vegetables commonly store such crops &carrots in crates, boxes, or baskets which are kept covered with burlap or a piece of old rug or carpet. Water is added by sprinkling as needed, and the covering itself is kept moist. Regardless of the method, stored vegetables should be carefully watched to avoid loss from decay, growth, or excessive shriveling. Decaying vegetables should be taken out as soon as noticed. If vege- tables start to sprout and grow, the temperature is too high. Vegc- tables which begin to shrivel a great deal should be wrapped, placed in closed containers, or sprinkled with water. ln a moist storage room extra moisture may be provided by sprinkling the floor. Cleanliness is one of the first things to be observed in storage cellars. Walls and ceiling should be whitewashed and the floor must be kept clean at all times. Dead leaves, stalks, and the like must be removed from under shelves and planking. Spring cleaning is obliga- tory, and it is best done during dry summer days. Shelves, crates, baskets, and other containers must be brushed in the open air or with all windows open. Basement S forage ldens The cellars in old houses didn’t have dirt floors just because they were cheap and easy to construct. These dirt floors made cellars excellent food storage areas; they helped to keep food cool and moist. These old root cellars have long been used for storage in the colder parts of our country, and some houses without central heating on farms and homesteads are now being built with dirt floor cellars for just this reason. These cellars usually have an outside entrance which can be opened to ventilate the cellars and regulate the temperature inside. Many have insulating material on the ceiling to prevent cold air in the cellar from chilling the whole house. Centrally heLlted homes with concrete floor basements are gener- ally too warm to be used just as they are for food storage. But with a little ingenuity and a minimal expense, part of just about any base- ment can be converted into a storage room. Essentially the storage room is a place where temperature and humidity are held to the proper level for keeping produce. This means lower-than-usual household or basement temperatures, rang- ing from 30” to 40°F. With few exceptions, the most desirable temperature is at or very near 32”F.-the freezing point of water.

It is difficult, however, to keep the temperature as low as 32°F. without danger of it going low enough to cause actual freezing during exceedingly cold weather. It is suggested, therefore, that the storage room temperature be kept be- tween 35” and 40°F. Such temperatures cannot be reached and kept there except in a room separated from the rest of the basement, rea- sonably well insulated, and having adequate ventilation. The size of the basement storage room will vary with the space available and the family’s needs; 8 by 10 feet is suggested for most families who plan to store both vegetables and other foods in the same room; a room this size will hold 60 bushels of produce. A stor- age room, if properly constructed and managed, will be suitable for nearly all foods commonly preserved. Where practical, the storage room should be located either in the northeast or northwest corner of the basement and away from the chimney and heating pipes.

Wood slats lie over the con- crete, and any excess water is pumped out of the cellar automatically. Air circulation is most effective. Intake air entering through a 12-inch-round concrete overhead flue is directed out at the floor through an adjustable grill. The air is cooled as it passes over the water and flows Ihrough the room. Asked why he installed a concrete floor when the water condition was as indicated, Enos explained there could be a muddy condition if he hadn’t used concrete. He is so well satisfied that when he next builds the adjacent 12-by-30-foot room, he will not change this proven method one bit. The flat ceiling created one problem he had not anticipated which will be solved in his new room: condensation on the ceiling causes dripping all over the room. A tentlike installation of plastic sheeting sloping to either side of the room catches the water and di- rects it to the walls, and thence to the floor. Enos Hess has very successfully stored potatoeq, be&s, and car- rots in open boxes, and celery and cabbage in plastic bags well into spring of the following year.

Grace and Tim Lefever of Sunnewald Farm near Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, do. Although they had to chop up and cart away a &inch concrete slab in the process, the Lefevers got an insulated ice-maker box from a supermarket for free. They put it in an unheated area in their house and built a new floor for the box by placing 5-inch-deep Styrofoam between wooden supports that were cut to a uniform slope to the drain in the center. This understructure was covered with plywood and finally faced off with a sheet metal floor. A Concrete Stornge Room Root cellars can be made from scratch by making a concrete structure and then burying it below ground level. For details, see the plans and material specifications that follow. But storage areas need not be so intricate. Many gardeners and small-scale farmers have found that the ground itself can protect vegetables and fruits from winter’s freezing temperatures. They have taken advantage of the ground’s insulating qualities to make small, efficient storage space for their garden products. John Keck, of the Rodale Organic Experimental Farm, didn’t have a cellar to work with, so he con- structed an outdoor, under- ground storage area from an old steel “REA” Ex- press truck body. He sup- ported the roof of the truck body with pipe columns and light beams, imbedded it into a bank and sodded it down with earth. (He found that the steeper the bank and the more earth coverage, the better.) A small stairway down to the truck acts as a door entry.

Soil- Pit S torqc The glacial plain of northwestern Pennsylvania provides excellent conditions-moist soil with a winter temperature around 52”F.-for soil-pit storage like the kind Jane Preston devised: Our pit is neatly cut out, 3 feet wide, 6 feet long, and 2 feet deep. It is on sloping ground, so that excess water promptly drains away. We lined the inside entirely with */J-inch hardware cloth, carefully kept tight-as it roust be-to keep out rodents. The top is finished with a 2-by-4-inch frame and a neat wooden lid. (If mice do get in, they are in trouble!) “clover” and you are in deep At harvest time-late autumn-select carrots, beets, parsnips, potatoes, turnips, and the like. Wash them free of soil, but be careful not to bruise the skin. Put a layer of clean, sharp builder’s sand (washed) on the pit bottom. Then place a neat layer of root vegetables. Do not “dump” vegetables into the pit."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"After the first layer of root crops is in place, cover with a layer of sand, then continue as you fill the pit. A “map” is mighty helpful in keeping account of where different roots are to be found. Finish the pit with a final layer of sand. Four bales of straw can be laid on the cover, and this then is covered with a plastic sheet to keep off snow. The insulation provided by the straw bales not only helps keep things “warm” in winter (avoiding freezing), but also cool in the warm days of early spring. Good-quality vegetables have been taken from the pit as late as May-even early June. Then it is time to clean everything out and let in sunshine and ventilation over the summer. Our pit has been in steady use for over IO years. We have had to replace the wooden parts or mend wire on occasion, but that’s about all. And we’ve been able to supply a homegrown table with good varieties of all root vegetables, plus cabbage and celery as well. The secret, if there is one, resides in 100 percent humidity at a very uniform temperature all winter. A variation of the Prestons’ soil pit storage is the barrel pit, which is made by partially burying a barrel with earth and covering it with straw and used lumber. Hay&k Sfon-~~c In Ohio, gardener John Krill stores his apples and root crops in on-top-of-the-ground storage areas. Building these areas is quite simple, and the materials used may be turned into mulch or compost after the storage season. Here John describes how he built them: Bales of spoiled hay are commonly available nearly everywhere at low cost. Bales average in size about 42 inches long by 18 inches high and 14 inches wide. I lay two bales cnd- to-end. About 14 inches across from them, 1 place two more bales end-to-end parallel to the first two. This is done on a well-"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"252 Vegetables and Fruits drained spot, of course. The ends are closed off by placing a bale across each end. A thin layer of hay is then placed in the bottom of the resulting “box.” Apples, pears, potatoes, or other root crops are then placed inside of this hay-bale enclosure. Do not dump the produce in. Careless handling will cause bruising which will quickly cause rot. Place carefully by handfuls until within several inches of the top. Cover the top with hay. Place hay bales across the opening. Place a stone under each bale on top to keep it from completely sealing the opening. Wait until freezing weather sets in, then remove the stones so that the top bales may completely seal the opening. This al- lows for natural ventilation of the stored crop. When unseason- ably warm weather comes, lift one bale and place a stone under it to permit ventilation until severe cold again sets in. Then remove the stone to again seal the top. The great thickness of the hay bales makes excellent insula- tion against cold. Enough air seeps through to create ventilation without permitting freezing cold to enter. Dig a shallow trench alongside of the bottom bales to carry away rain. These hay-bale enclosures are so quickly and simply made that a number of them may be constructed. No soil is heaped up --Bales of hay r _r-- : _ HAY-BALE STORAGE Top-of-the-ground storage is suitable for most, root crops. Here, a rectangle is made from bales of hay.

A stone can be placed under the top bales for ventilation during mild weather and can be removed when freezing weather prevails."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"around them as in most other methods of storage. Access to the stored produce is quickly and easily gamed. A single top bale is removed to expose the interior. It is easily replaced after removal of a quantity of the contents. After the contents have been used up, the hay bales are converted either into mulch or added to the compost pi!e. Thus the bales play two important parts in the scheme of the organic gardener. But the best appreciated part is the lack of hard physi- cal labor and trouble‘in constructing the hay-bale storage enclo- sures. I have kept tomatoes ripening on their vines long after frosts invaded our area. The method is quite simple and highly effec- tive. I stake my tomatoes and the stake plays an important part in the method. All small tomatoes that have no chance of ripen- ing are removed. Only those showing signs of even the faintest blush color are kept on the vine. The vine is then tied as com- pactly as possible to the stake. Next, old hay is pushed up around and over each tomato plant like the skirt around the waist and legs of a hula dancer. Keep this hay wrap loose and 3 or 4 inches thick, and secure by wrapping with twine arollnd the tomato plant and its stake. The stake makes a support for the entire arrangement. To pick to- matoes, carefully part the hay without pulling it free. Remove the ripened fruit and replace the hay. Tomatoes kept in this fashion are far more trouble-free than by other methods commonly used. Best of all, the tomato tastes like a garden-ripe fruit. They will slowly ripen in this fashion until freezing weather arrives to stay. Stnriug ir? Garbage Pails Gardener Elmer L. Onstott, of St. Louis, Missouri, had a problem keeping his late-summer vegetables garden-fresh over the winter be- cause he had no room for basement storage. A good part of his stor- age problem wa s solved when he discovered that IO-gallon garbage pails can be converted into storage bin. ‘3~ burying them in lo-inch holes, leaving their rims above ground. in addition to being inrxpen- sive and readily accessible, the garbage-pail storage bins are water- and rodent-proof and store easily over the summer as a compact stack of pails.

Then I put the lid on the cans and cover everything with 6 inches of straw, adding more when the ground freezes. I add nothing to the cans, unless the vegetables are dry at the time of storage. If their skins are dry, I sprinkle the vegetables with water as I put them in the cans, being careful not to form a pool of water at the bottom of the cans. During the winter, especially if it is dry, it is a good idea to sprinkle a little water over the vegetables once and a while. Hut I havt> found little dehydration; almrwt all the vtlgr- tables remain firm and fresh until the middle of March. Instead of emptying one pail at a time, I take a little from each in turn, so that the level in each cm is lowered as the winter progresses. The lower the contents are, the less chance of damage from frost. If the vegetables are 6 to 8 inches below the bin cover, with even A little straw, it will take a very severe freezing to cause frost damage because the heat from the earth below the frost line will feed into the bins. ‘While I cannot equal or even duplicate the airtight, atmo- spherically controlled and refrigerated rooms that large commer- Screen -Potatoee A more permanent version of Mr. Onstott’s garbage pail idea is the tile pit storage.

All through the winter months and into early spring, long after the average gardener has all but forgotten his garden, I bring in those garden-fresh, organically grown vegetables from the storage bins of my garden. Red beets, the best keeper of them all, I have enjoyed into May-weeks after the new crop was up and growing. According to Gordon Morrison, of Michigan, garbage cans or similar containers don’t even have to be underground to make good storage bins. He keeps apples, potatoes, carrots, and the like perfectly crisp from fall until early spring just by using watertight wooden or metal barrels, watertight butter tubs, and candy pails. He puts them in a cool basement room, a sheltered back porch or garage- anywhere that thev can safely be protected against freezing. He provides enough ventilation by topping off the contents of the barrel with a well-moistened, but not drippy, 4- or 5-inch head cover of something like burlap or moistened sphagnum moss, which can be rewetted when necessary. By this method he’s kept many kinds of garden crops in good condition in a cement-floored base- ment room next to the furnace room, where temperatures range quite often bc tween 40” to 50°F.

Cover the mound with soil, then boarding. A ventilating pipe can be added by placing stakes or a pipe through the center of the pile. This should be capped in freezing weather to prevent cold temperatures from entering. A trench is then dug around the mound for drainage. Once the pit is opened, all the food should be removed. It is therefore a good idea to build a few of these, each containing a small number of different vegetables. Separate the various vegetables in the mound with mulch. Do not mix fruits with vegetables, but make separate mounds for them. Mounds should be made in different p’laces every year, because leftovers in used mounds are usually spoiled."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Pickles and Relishes Pickles and relishes have been enjoyed by millions throughout the centuries. The Chinese are said to have invented pickling--Chinese laborers who worked on the Great Wall of China carried salted vege- tables to the Wall with them. In the United States, perhaps the ethnic group most famous for its pickles is the Pennsylvania Dutch. Every Pennsylvania Dutch cookbook contains dozens of recipes for both fruit and vegetable pickles, and every meal served by the Pennsylva- nia Dutch is supposed to contain the “seven sweets and seven sours.” (There doesn’t have to be seven of either; the cook picks out the best pickles and relishes to go with the meal he or she is serving.) There are actually four different kinds of pickled products: Brined pickles, which usually include sauerkraut and pickling cucumbers, go through a curing process of about 3 weeks. Most brined pickles are made in a low salt brine (3 to 5 percent salt) and do not require desalting before they are used. Cucumbers may also be cured in a high salt (10 percent salt) brine; these should be soaked in water before they are processed any further. Fresh-pack or quick-process pickles are the easiest to prepare. They are either soaked in a low salt brine for several hours or over- night, then drained and processed with boiling hot vinegar, spices, herbs, or other seasonings, or they are cooked with the spiced vinegar and packed and processed right away. Fruit pickles are usually prepared from whole fruits-pears, peaches, and watermelon rind are good choices-and simmered in spicy, sweet-sour syrup, then packed and processed. Relishes are mixed fruits and vegetables which are chopped, seasoned, and then cooked, packed, and processed. Relishes may be hot and spicy or sweet and spicy, Familiar ones include piccalilli, chutneys, corn relish, catsup, and Pennsylvania Dutch chowchow. 157"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"158 Vtytlzbles mrd Fruits hgwdicnts Fruits and Vegetables Use only tender fruits or vegetables that arc in prime condition. Produce should not be more than 24 hours old and should be refrigerated or cooled immediately after picking. This is especially important for cucumbers, which deteriorate rapidly after picking at room temperature. You may, if you wish, sort the produce for uniform size. Some canners -those who win prizes at county fairs-always sort for uniformity. By using vegetables or fruits of the same size you can be sure that all the food will cook and cure evenly. Do not use any fruits or vegetables for pickling whole that have mold damage or are injured. Damaged ones can be cut up for relishes or, in the G&C of cucumbers, sliced for bread and butter pickles, with the injured or moldy part being cut out and discarded. Although proper processing does kill the spoilage organisms in moldy parts, an off-flavor will develop from the mold growth that cannot be masked by spices or herbs. Fruits and vegetables should be washed thoroughly under run- ning water. Scrub the food with a soft brush or with the palms of your hands. Rinse well so that all soil drains off. It is important that the food be handled gently so that it does not become bruised; this is especially important for cucumbers or for soft fruits like peaches 01 pears (alihough the latter two mav be picked slightly underripe for pickling). Be sure to remove blossoms from cucumbers-the blos- soms may be a source of spoilage enzymes. Produce should never be picked for canning after a heavy rain because it will be waterlogged. Wait 12 hours after the rain to pick your fruits and vegetables. When picking cucumbers, cllt them from the vines, leavim; ;I short bit of stem on the fruit. If pulled off the vines, they are likely to rot where the stem was broken from the skin. Drain your produce on a tea towel or on a dish drain. Wipe them dry if you must, but be careful not to bruise them. Vinegar As practical and self-satisfying as it might be to use yout own homemade vinegar in your pickles, rforl’f. Vinegar should be a good grade of 40 to 60 grain strength (4 to 6 percent acetic acid). The vinegar you make on your homestead may be some of the best you’ve ever had, and it is fine for your salads and other cooking. But homemade vinegars vary in acidity, so you’ll never know what the acidity of your vinegar is unless you test it, or have it tested. It is much safer to rely on commercial vinegar for your pickles. Cider vinegar has a good flavor and aroma, but it is not good for"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Pirklcs nrrd lic~lislrcs 159 white pickles such as onion or cauliflower because it may discolor them. Distilled vinegar is clear so there is no chance of discoloration. ‘rhc fact that it is slightly more acidic than cider vinegar makes little difference. Honey Light honeys, such as clover or alfalfa, are very mild in flavor and are good to use for canning or pickling for that reason. Dark honeys are strongly flavored. If they are used in pickling, you might find that their flavor will overpower the flavors of the other ingre- dients. Therefore, no matter what kind of honey you are using, we suggest that you taste your syrup as you add the honey to it. If you think that the syrup is sweet t~nough, stop adding honey, although you may not have reached the amount suggested in the recipe. Those amounts are intended to be guidelines only, not hard and fast rules. Your best guides are your tastcbuds and a knowledge of your fami- ly’s likes and dislikes. Pickling recipes from most cookbooks suggest that you boil the syrup, consisting of vinegar, spices, and sugar, for a certain amount of time. This allows the sugar to dissolve completely and also allows the spices to flavor the syrup. If you are altering a recipe that you’ve found in another book because you want to use honey in it rather than sugar, remember that the heating of honey tends to break down the sugars in honey and cause a change in flavor and a darkening in color. Honey can be heated to high temperatures for short periods without causing too much damage, but it will not stand sustained boiling. For this reason, never add the honey to the syrup /~ofor~ it is boiled. Instead, boil the vinegar and spices together for the stated time; then add the honey, tasting the syrup as you add it to deter- mine sweetness. (As a general rule of thumb, if you are substituting honey for sugar, cut the amount of sweetener by one-half.) Bring the syrup to a boil and pour it over the pickles. Process as directed. Spices Always use whole, fresh spices or herbs. Whole spices or herbs should be tied in a bag (cheesecloth will do) or a stainless steel spice ball and removed before the pickles are packed. Never use ground herbs or spices; they tend to darken pickles. Whole spices, if left in the jar after the pickies are cc~nncd, may caust‘ an o&flavor in the product. If garlic is used, it should first be blanched for 2 minutes or removed from the jar before it is sealed. The liquid should be tasted first before canning. Spices vary considerably in strength, and you can correct the seasoning by add-"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"160 Vegetables and Fruits ing more spices. Unused spices should be kept in airtight jars in a ~001 place, as heat and humidity tend to sap their quality. Water Soft water is recommended for the best-looking pickles. Iron or sulphur in hard water will darken pickles; calcium and other salts can interfere with the fermentation process. Salt You should use plain salt. Iodized salt may cause darkening, and table salt sometimes causes a cloudy brine. Rock salt, dairy salt, or pickling salt is best. You can also use sea salt. Equipment You shouldn’t need any more specialized equipment for pickling than you already have to do your other canning chores. Use un- chipped enamelware or stainless steel for heating liquids you may be using in your pickling. Do not use copper, brass, galvanized iron, or aluminum utensils. These metals react with acids and salts in the liquids and may cause undesirable color changes in the finished product. For fermenting or brining use a crock, stone jar, plastic container, unchipped enamelware pan, or large glass jar, bowl, or casserole. Use a heavy plate or large glass lid that fits right inside the circumference of the crock and a weight to hold the vegetables in the brine. Clean rocks or a glass jar filled with water can be used as a weight, or a large plastic bag filled with water can serve as both weight and cover (so long as it completely covers the food and is tight against the circum- ference of the brining container). If you are using recipes that specify ingredients by weight, a small household scale is a necessity. It is best to use a scale to make large quantities of sauerkraut to insure the proper proportion of salt and cabbage. Gaming Pickled Foods Jars should be filled, as recommended in the recipes, leaving the necessary headspace. Pack jars firmly and uniformly, but avoid pack- ing so tightly that the brine or syrup is prevented from filling spaces around and over the product. Wipe the rims and threads of the jar with a clean hot cloth, and cap. Pickles are processed in a boiling- water bath. (See the instructions on boiling-water bath processing on page 76.) Processing times in the following recipes are given for altitudes less than 1,000 feet above sea level. At altitudes above 1 000 feet, add"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Pickles ami Relishes 161 1 minute of processing time for each 1,000 feet. For example, at 2,000 feet, process for 2 minutes more than the required time; at 3,000 feet, process for 3 minutes more; at 4,000 feet, process for 4 minutes more Storing Pickles Pickled products should be stored in cool, dark, dry places. Ex- treme fluctuations of temperature may cause a breakdown of texture, resulting in an inferior product. It might also cause enough expan- sion of the product to break the jar or the seal. Light causes products to fade and become less appetizing in appearance. This does not mean that the product is spoiled, however. A storage area in a basement is fine if it is cool, dry, and dark. Do not store canned products with vegetables or fruits that require high concentrations of moisture. Dampness may rust enclosures and cause spoilage. Brine Curing Just about any vegetable can be cured this way: snap or string beans, cucumbers, cauliflower, onions, broccoli, green tomatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, and carrots. By covering such foods with a brine and keeping them in a moderately warm room, you can create ideal conditions for the lactic acid forming bacteria existing on the food surface to feed upon the sugar naturally present in the food. The lactic acid will continue to grow (or ferment) until enough has formed to kill any bacteria present that would otherwise cause the food to spoil. Lactic acid, which aids digestion and helps to kill harmful bacteria in the digestive tract, gives the brined food a slightly acid or mildly vinegar flavor. The following is a general recipe for brine curing that can be used with any one vegetable or mixture of the vegetables mentioned above: ‘1. Choose fresh, perfect vegetables, wash them carefully to avoid bruising, and drain well. 2. Pack vegetables in a crock or other wide-mouthed container, leaving about a 3- or $-inch headspace.

Cover vegetables with a plate or something similar, and place a clean rock or other heavy object on the plate to weight down the vegetables so they are underneath the brine. 4. Place the crock or other container in a moderately warm area-70” to 80°F. is best. 5. Then, or not later than the following morning, add salt at the rate of 1 cup for each 5 pounds of vegetables.

At the end of a week and for each succeeding week, add l/4 cup salt for each 5 pounds of vegetables. Add in same manner as in step number 5. 8. Fermentation resulting in bubble formation should continue for about 2 to 4 weeks. Fermentation time varies depending upon temperatures, so after about 10 days check for bubble formation. If no bubbles rise to the surface after you’ve gently tapped the side of the container, fermentation has stopped. q. When fermentation is complete, you can either remove the food, desalt it, and then pickle it (see recipes later), or keep the food in the brine in the container for future use, If you plan to leave the food in the brine, transfer the con- tainer to a cc01 cellar or store room. There’s no need to ;Idd additional salt, ,but you should cover the surface of the liquid with either a thin layer of hot melted paraffin or % inch of good vegetable oil. This is done to seal the surface so that scum which wolmld otherwise spoil the food cannot form. Ma& sure fermentation has stopped before using the paraffin, or the bubbles that rise to the surface will crack the wax and you’ll have to remove it, melt it down, and re-cover the surface. Remove the paraffin bcforc using the brined vegetables. It can be saved, melted, strained, and used again and again.

Some recipes suggest using alum or lime for crisper pickles. It really isn’t necessary to add either of these if proper procedures are followed. If you do want to add something to your pickles to crisp them, try using grape or cherry leaves during the brining process. To desalt these pickles for further use, soak them in cold water for a few hours. You can hasten the soaking process by using large amounts of water (three to four times volume of water as volume of pickles), changing the water often and stirring often, being careful not to bruise the brined food. Brine-Cured Dill Pickles Euell Gibbons, nationally known author and expert on wild foods, wrote in ORGANIC GARDENING AND FARMING about his own adven- tures with pickled vegetables, using his “dill crock.” This method has great appeal because it not only brines the vegetables, but flavors them as well. Gibbons wrote: Naturally, I got started at this tasty sport with wild foods. A nearby patch of wild Jerusalem artichokes had yielded a bumper crop, and I wanted to preserve some. I used a gallon-size glass jar, getting all of these jars I wanted from a nearby school cafeteria. I’acking a layer of dill on the bottom of the jar, I added several cloves of garlic, a few red tabasco peppers, then some cored and peeled Jerusalem artichokes, plus another layer of dill. With room still left, I looked around for other things to add. The winter onions had great bunches of top sets, so I peeled a few and made a layer of them. Then I dug up some of the surplus onions and used the bottom sets-shaped like huge cloves of garlic-to make still another layer. I then put in a layer of cauliflower picked apart into small florets, and added some red sweet pepper cut in strips, along with a handful or so of nastur- tium buds. This was all covered with a brine made by adding thrce- fourths of a measure of sea salt to 10 measures of water. I added some cider vinegar too, but only i/d clip to the whole gallon.

After 2 weeks I decided it must hc finished. The Jerusalem artichokes were superb, crisp and delicious. The winter onions, both the top and bottom sets, were thtb best pickled onions I ever tasted. The cauliflower florets all disappeared the first time 1 let my grandchildren taste them, while the nasturtium buds make better capers than capers do. The next summer I determined to get started early and keep a huge dill crock running all season. Any size crock can be used, from l-gallon up. I use a IO-gallon one and wish it were bigger. Never try to use a set recipe for a dill crock, but rather let each one be a separate and original “creation.” 1 plant plenty of dill, and keep planting some every few weeks so 1’11 always have some on hand at just the right stage. What is good in a dill crock? Nearly any kind of firm, crisp vegetable. Green beans are perfect, and wax beans also very good. These are the only two things cooked before being added to the brine, and they should be cooked not more than about 3 minutes. And small green tomatoes are great. Nothing else so nice ever happened to a caulitlower. Just break the head LIP into small florets, and drop it into the dilled brine. In a week or two-the finest dilled cauliflower pickle ever tasted. If you have winter onions, clean some sets and put them in the crock. It’s a tedious job, but the results are worth it. Not only do they add to the flavor of all the rest of the ingredients in the jar, but the little onions themselves are superb. If you don’t have winter onions, you can sometimes buy small pickling onions on the market and use them. If not, just take ordinary onions .Ind slice them crosswise into three or four sections. These will come apart after curing, but so what? They are simply great pickled onion rings.

Pickled Nasturtium Buds C Fnlsr capers) If you pride yourself on your gourmet cooking, one recipe you can’t afford to pass up is the following. As Euell Gibbons already noted, “Nasturtium buds make better capers than capers do.” Nas- turtium buds should be gathered while they’re still green-yellow ones are useless. Place the nasturtium buds in a 10 percent brine-made by add- ing 1 cup salt to 2 quarts water-to cover. Weight them, if necessary, to hold them in the brine. Allow them to cure in brine for 24 hours. Remove from brine, and soak in cold water for an hour. Drain the buds. Bring vinegar to a boil. Pack nasturtium buds in hot, sterilized jars, cover with boiling vinegar, leaving a Q-inch headspace. Seal and process 10 minutes in a boiling-water bath. It is best to let your “capers” stand for 6 weeks before you use them, as they will be more Aavorful. You can, however, use them immediately if you wish. Sauerkraut Sauerkraut has been made and enjoyed by millions for hundreds of years. For our ancestors, it was an important winter source of vitamin C and was used as a cure for scurvy on sea voyages. III addition, like other cured vegeta.bles, sauerkraut contains the benefi- cial lactic acid. Sauerkraut, like the brined vegetables discussed earlier, is cured in salt. But it is packed in a dry salt, not covered in a salt water solution, because the cabbage contains a great deal of water and forms its own brine when the salt draws out water in its shredded Icaves. After fermentation, sauerkraut can either be canned in a boiling- water bath or stored in the container in which it was made. If you’re just keeping it in the container, be sure to keep it in a cool place. Temperatures just above freezing arc best. Low temperatures will discourage the growth of surface scum. Still the kraut should be checked periodically and SCLIIII should be removed."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Picklrs urld Rclishcs I67 Tight-forming head lettuces can be used instead of cabbage to make a milder form of “sauerkraut,” and although we’ve never made it ourselves, we have heard of people who have used shredded car- rots and turnips instead of cabbage. Sauerkraut can be made in either large quantities or in small batches. We give instructions for both methods. The recipe below for making small batches, suggested by natural foods writer Beatrice Trum Hunter, has the added advantage of being made with less salt than most other recipes, which might interest those on low-sodium diets. Saltless Sauerkraut (SWl?ll lwfL-/ll’~~ Assemble a few simple items. Loc,lte Cl bowl, pot, or othct wide-mouthed container that will hold 1 gallon of liquid measure. Glass, well-glazed clay, or other impermeable material is suitable. A stoneware crock and cover are ideal for the purpose. If you consider purchasing a used stoneware crock, check its inside. If the crock has been used to store surplus eggs in waterglass, it will have a perma- nent whitish stain. Reject such a crock for sauerkraut production. Next, find a flat plate slightly smaller in diameter than the inner surface of your container. If you plan to use a sloping bowl, measure the plate against the diameter near the top of the bowl. Then locate a few large, smooth stones. Plan to keep the container, plate, and stones reserved exclusively for “Project Sauerkraut.” Depending upon the amount of kraut you want to make, shred a whole or even c7 half of a solid head of cabbage. Place it at the bottom of the container. For each head of cabbage, pulverize a half teaspoon- ful each of dill, celery, and caraway seeds in an electric seed grinder or with mortar and pestle. These seeds can be added whole, but the ground seeds release more flavor. Sprinkle this blend on top of the shredded cabbage.

Put the plate over the shredded cabbage, seasoning, and water. Press down gently, so that the liquid flows over and submerges it. Next, weight it down with the freshly scrubbed stones. Cover the container, place it in a warm room, and let nature take its course. As a precaution against overflow, which rarely occurs with this method, place the crock in a glass pie plate to catch any drippings. Within a few days you will begin to sniff the pleasant fermenta- tion process. Take a peek now and then: Be sure that the plate keeps the cabbage submerged under the liquid. Skim off any scum that develops on the surface, because, as mentioned earlier, it will other- wise grow and cause the cabbage to spoil. One little trick to avoid more scum is to sprinkle a bit of additional salt on the surface of the kraut after you’ve skimmed off the scum. The length of fermentation will be determined by the room’s temperature. Sauerkraut may be ready in as few as 7 days. Sometimes it takes a little longer. Toward the end, check daily. When you’re convinced that the product is well fermented, re- move the stones and plate. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the drained sauerkraut to a bowl. Strain the remaining liquid. The flavor of both the low-salt raw sauerkraut and its juice will be subtle and delicate. If you’re unaccustomed to low-salt, you may find the flavor “flat.” Nothing prevents you from adding a dash of salt. Or, if you wish, simply make the sauerkraut as described, adding salt instead of the kelp. After your family eats its fill of sauerkraut, any remainder can be refrigerated. Although raw, it keeps well, due to its natural preserva- tive, lactic acid.

Inspect the jars every few days. Don’t be alarmed when the zinc lids begin to bulge-that shows the kraut is fermenting properly. If (and it frequently happens) the juice spews between the rubber ring and lid, wipe it off and tighten the jar lid some more. That is why the jars arc set in a container outside-there may be leaks and there will be plenty of kraut odor! This will continue as long as the kraut is work- ing. Never under any circumstances loosen the lids. After about 6 weeks the kraut will have cured and the jars can be washed and brought inside. If you’re going to use the kraut within a month, there’s no reason to process the cans; just store them in a cool place. But if you do plan to keep them longer, place the filled jars in a large pot and cover the jars with water. Put the lid on the pot and bring the water to a boil. Once boiling, process for 20 minutes. What You Did Wrotq If Your Sauerkraut Spoiled Spoilage of sauerkraut is indicated by undesirable color, off- odors, and soft texture. If yc?ur kraut has spoiled, here’s what you might have done wrong: If your sauerkraut is soft, it may be due to insufficient salt. Try using more salt the next time. High temperatures during fermenta- tion may also cause softness. Uneven distribution of salt may also be a cause of softness-be sure that your salt is well mixed with the kraut next time. Air pockets caused by improper packing may also make your kraut soft. Your crock or jar may have had air spaces that caused poor fermentation; this can PC remedied by packing the j,lr or crock tightly and being sure to weight it properly. Pink kraut is caused by the growth of certain types of yeast on the surface of the kraut. These yeasts may grow if there is too much salt, if there is an uneven distribution of salt, or if the kraut is im- properly covered or weighted during fermentation. Rotted kraut is usually found at the surface where the cabbage has not been covered sufficiently to exclude air during fermentation. This scum does not cause trouble as long as you skim it off before it stops fermentation. Remove every day or two. Darkness in kraut may be caused by unwashed and improperly trimmed cabbage. It may also bc caust~d by insufficient brine in the fermenting process. Be sure that the brine completely covers the fer- menting cabbage. Exposure to air or a long storage period in the crock after fermentation is complete may rllso result in darkened kraut. Another cause of darkening may be high temperatures during fcr- mentation, processing, or storage."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"171 VPptllbleS nilii Fmits Fresh Vegetable Pickles These pickles are different from the brine-cured ones discusst>ci cariier in that they are not packed in a salt-water solution for several days or weeks, but take, with few exceptions, from 1 hour to4 days in all to make.

Yield: about 3 pints If Your Pickles Fail If your pickles, for some reason, don’t turn out the way you’d like them to, learn from your mistakes and don’t do the same thing wrong next year. Here are some common causes of pickle failure and how you can correct them: If your pickles are shriveled, you may have used too strong a vinegar or salt solution at the start of the pickling process. In making very sweet or very sour pickles, it is best to start with a dilute solution and increase gradually to the desired strength. Shriveling may also be caused by overcooking or overprocessing. Hollowness in cucumber pickles usually results from one or sev- eral of the following: poorly developed cucumbers, holding the cucumbers too long before pickling, too rapid fermentation, or too strong or too weak a brine during fermentation. Soft or slippery pickles are spoiled pickles. Do not use them. This condition is generally a result of microbial action which caused the spoilage, and it is irreversible. Proper processing should halt microbial activity, but if it results, here are some things you might have done wrong: used too little salt or acid, failed to cover your cucumbers with brine during fermentation, allowed scum to scatter through the brine during fermentation, processed the pickles for too short a time, did not seal the jar airtight, or used moldy garlic or spices. Also, if you failed to remove the blossoms from the cucumbers before fermentation, they may have contained fungi or yeasts res’ponsible for the softening action. Dark pickles are not spoiled pickles; however, if you are one of those people who prides himself on the looks of his home-canned products, darkening can be annoying. Darkening may result from the use of too much spice, iodized salt, overcooking, iron in the water you used, or the use of iron utensils."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"188 Vegetables nnd Fruits Relishes, Chutneys, and Spicy Sauces Chowchow 2 small heads cauliflower, cut into small flowers I large bunch celery, cut into slices 2 pounds onions, sliced, or 2 pounds pearl onions 21/2 quar;: fresh lima beans 1 quart sliced green peppers 2 quarts yellow string beans, cut into small pieces 2 dozen ears corn, kernels removed 2 quarts carrots, chunked 2 to 3 quarts small cucumbers (may be brined) 2 quarts kidney beans salt to taste 2 quarts cider vinegar 5 cups honey (less, if desired) 1 tablespoon mustard seed 1 tablespoon peppercorns 1 tablespoon whole cloves cinnamon stick Sprinkle vegetables with salt and let stand 24 hours.

In fact, if you’ve looked at most books on food preservation, you’ve probably found that the chapter on making jellies and jams is the largest section in the entire book (except, perhaps, for the pickling section). This is because jelly- making offers a chance to be truly creative. As long as you follow some basic rules, you can explore some very interesting flavor com- binations of fresh fruits, dried fruits, and nuts. Perhaps you re- member the pride your mother had in a special jelly, or the smile on your grandmother’s face as she served slabs of homemade bread spread thick with butter and her own peach jam. Jellied fruit prod- ucts have been a mark of pride for farm women for years. Even today, jams and jellies are an important item of show in farm shows and county fairs throughout rural areas of the country. Making jellied fruit products-jams, jellies, conserves, preserves, marmalades, and fruit butters-is an excellent way of using up fruits and berries that can’t be used for other types of canning. When you size your fruit for canning or freezing you’ll most likely have some fruit that is too small or too large. Some pieces may be rejected because they have imperfections, like soft spots or rotten portions. Other pieces may be too ripe for canning. All these fruits can be used for jelly-making, and all of them can make a definite contribution to the finish-l product. Ripe fruit adds to the flavor of the product and should always be used when you are using commercial pectins. And, of course, size or blcmisht~s won’t matter because all the fruit is going to be cut up and peeled ‘jnyway. For the sake of brevity, we refer to jams, jellies, preserves, mar- malades, and conserves as jams and jellies in the next several pages-but there’s a fine line separating each of them."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"jam, Icllie, auri Fruit Butters 199 /pllics are cooked twice: first, the juice is extracted from the fruit (you can freeze the juice, if you wish, and make fresh batches of jelly at will), and then the juice is cooked with sweetening and pectin until it gels. \\arzls are purees made with fruit, sweetening, and pectin. PYL~SC~ZU~S, coIIserz)es, and rrzarr~~aladcs are made with bits of fruit, cooked until translucent with sweetening and pectin. Prt~st3~vtPs are generally made from a single kind of fruit (strawberry preserves contain only strawberries); cOrts4rvcs are made with fresh fruits and dried fruit or nuts, or both; and nlarmaladrs are made most often from one or many kinds of citrus fruit. Fruit butters fall into a category of their own, so we’ll discuss them separately at the end of this chapter. Makiq /am 17rrd Jelly with Horrey As you read on in this section you’ll find that the directions and recipes here are quite different from those in jam and jelly chapters of other books. Recipes for jams and jellies elsewhere call for great quan- tities of sugar, but you won’t find any sugar in our recipes. As we said in the introduction, this book means to provide alternatives to overprocessed and highly refined ingredients. An alternative to sugar is honey, and all the recipes that follow use this natural sweetening instead of sugar. Because of its sweetness, sugar was a highly prized commodity for centuries before its preservative powers were discovered. It was always included with trade goods for the Indians, for example, be- cause Indians prized it so highly. When it was discovered that sugar did a good job of preserving foods, it became even more valuable on farms and homesteads. During World War II, when sugar supplies were low and what little there was had to bc rationed, government researchers began experimenting with alternatives to sugar. Books on preserving written during the war tell how to substitute honey or corn syrup (another refined product) for some of the sugar in jelly and jam recipes. It is becoming more apparent, however, that a serious effort must be made to find a real, workable alternative for sugar for many uses in the home. Evidence is mounting that points to sugar as a real danger to health. For years experts have known the role sugar plays in tooth decay, diabetes, and obesity. Now there are indications that sugar may be responsible, in part, for coronary disease, and it has even been suggested that sugar may be a cause of cancer in some people. There is, in short, growing medical evidence that we would be wise to avoid eating any sugar at all.* * There are several articles and books that cite such cvidcncc. One of the best references is: John Yudkin, SWI:EI‘ AND L)ANGEHOIIS (New York: Peter H. Wyden, Inc., 1972)."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"SL si st th in m Iii ie at bc cc til cc m sl rc tl 01 Ii ai 1 XI Ve,getnbles and Fruits Even though medical experts and nutritionists don’t know pre- sely to what extent sugar does our bodies harm, they do know that lgar does us no good. Sugar, even the so-called “raw” sugar, has no gnificant nutritional value. The complex sugar refining process de- roys almost all of the few original vitamins and minerals found in !e raw sugar cane and sugar beet. Honey, unlike sugar, is subjected to a minimal amount of refin- kg and processing and contains its original vitamins, enzymes, and inerals. Although not a highly significant source of food nutrients, 3ney certainly has more food value than sugar. In its unheated, nfiltered form, it also contains some pollen, a food rich in vitamins, iinerals, and proteins. What’s more, honey can be produced on the 3rnestead; sugar, for all practical purposes, cannot. (Note: Although sorghum, molasses, and maple syrup are all 3tural sweeteners, we don’t recommend you use them in jams and Ilies. They have a strong flavor of their own and will overpower or : least affect the flavor of the fruit.) Before we discuss making jams and jellies with honey we want to e honest and tell you that they are more difficult to make than the )nventional jams and jellies made with sugar. In order for the tradi- onal cooked-down and pectin products to gel, they have to be Joked longer than they would if made with sugar-about 8 to 10 minutes for pectin jellies and jams and even longer for the cooked- own ones that have no extra pectin added. If you have a little patience and follow the recipes carefully, you jould be able to make some fine jelly products this way. The only ?a1 problem with using pectin or the cooked-down method is that le long cooking time required will lessen the food value of both oney and the fruit and alter their flavor and color. If you’re con- 2rned about such things, you may prefer to make jellies and jams 4th low-methoxyl pectin, gelatin, or agar-agar, all of which don’t tquire sweetening or long cooking to gel. Discussions of all these lethods of making jams and jellies follow. Iooked-down and Pectin Jams and Jellies The traditional cooked-down method simply uses fruit, some quid like water or fruit juice, and a sweetening. It should be used nly with fruits that have a good amount of natural pectin in them, ke tart apples and crabapples, blackberries, grapes, lemons, plums, uinces, and raspberries. The fruit must also contain a sufficient mount of acid to achieve a gel. If the fruit you’re working with is low"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"/ms, ]tBll;tBs, nrd Fruit Brrttws 202 in acid, recipes will call for the addition of lemon juice or citric acid. When using this method, select your fruit carefully. A batch of fruit should contain one-fourth just-ripe fruit and three-fourths fully ripe fruit for best pectin and flavor content. Extra pectin should be added to fruits that don’t have much natural pectin in thcitl, like strawberries and apricots. Pectin can also be added to other fruits in order to cut down on cooking time neces- sary to form a gel. When using honey instead of sugar, added pectin can be especially helpful, since, as we said earlier, the cooking time could be quite long. Jellies made with added pectin also require less fruit than the cooked-down type to make the same amount of fin- ished product. Commercial pectin is available in most supermarkets under sev- eral different brand names, and it’s available in both liquid and pow- dered forms. You can also make your own pectin from apples and use it instead of the commercial kind. Hornernnde Pectirl You can make pectin-often called apple jelly stock-ahead of time and preserve it for later use, if you enjoy making combination jellies or blending them with other fruits in season when fresh apples are not available. Or, if you are lucky enough to have the fresh apples at the same time as the other fruits, you can make use of the pectin immediately. “Apple thinnings”-those small, immature green apples sold in the early summertime-are rich in both acid and pectin. They will make good jelly stock and give G snappy tartness to the product. However, if you prize the clarity of the jelly product, be warned that such apples will not produce as clear and transparent a jelly as pectin made from fully mature apples. If you happen to have a bumper crop of apples, you will like the idea of using some of the surplus to make apple stock. It represents one more good use for that large supply. You can use imperfect fruit, even with insect damage, bird pecking, bruises, or cuts from dropping from the trees. Merely cut away the imperfect sections and use the sound parts. Wash the apples carefully, trim, and cut pieces into thin slices. Measure 1 pint of water for every pound of apples. Place the slices in a kettle and boil for 15 minutes. Strain off the free-running juice through one thickness of cheesecloth, without attempting to squeeze the pulp. Return the pulp to the kettle, and add the same measure of water again. This time, cook the mixture at a lower temperature for 15 minutes. Allow it to"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"202 Vegetables mrd Fruits stand for 10 minutes, then strain the second batch of juice through one thickness of cheesecloth. Again, do not attempt to squeeze the pulp. Allow it to cool enough so that you can handle it. Squeeze out the remaining juice, and combine all you have. There should be about 1 quart of juice for every pound of apples you used. You can use this stock immediately for blending with other fruit juices to make jelly or jam, or you can preserve it for future use. If you wish to can the stock, heat it to the boiling point and pour it immedi- ately into hot, stcrilizcd canning jars. Seal, and invert the jars to cool. No further processing is necessary. If you prefer to freeze the stock, allow it to cool and then pour into freezer containers. Allow 1 inch of space at the top for expansion. Four cups of homemade pectin replaces approximately one-half bottle or 3 ounces of commercial liquid pectin in most recipes.

The clearest jelly comes from juice that has dripped through a jelly bag without pressing. If you’re not too concerned with producing a perfectly clear jelly, you can get more juice by twisting the jelly bag slightly and squeezing the juice out, or by using a fruit press. Pressed juice should be re-strained through a damp jelly bag or a double thickness of cheesecloth without squeezing. When you’re finished with the jelly bag wash it out well. The last thing you want is for your next batch of fruit to pick up a sour or musty taste from a jelly bag that had bits of old fruit or juice fermcnt- ing in it. Cookiq the Fruit Mixtuw Commercial pectin is commonly available in both powdered and liquid form. When using powdered pectin, mix it with the unheated fruit juice for jelly, or with the unheated, crushed fruit for jams, conserves, or marmalades before cooking. If you are using liquid pec- tin, add it to the boiling juice and honey mixture when making jelly, and to the cooked fruit and honey mixture immediately after it is removed from the heat. When making jams, preserves, conserves, and marmalades, all products (except, of course, those raw jams and jellies that use gelatin or agar-agar) should be brought to a full boil and cooked for the recommended length of time. A full boil is reached when bubbles form over the entire surface of the jams, mar- malades, or conserves mixture, or when the jelly mixture reaches a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down. It is better to make a small quantity of jelly or jam at a time rather than a large one. Since honey foams when it boils, a large kettle is required. An 8- or lo-quart kettle with a flat, broad bottom will bc fine. Do not use an aluminum pot, as acids in the fruit may react with the aluminum. We suggest you use a light-colored, mild-flavored honey for jams and jellies unless your family likes the taste of darker honeys. Dark honeys will impart a strong flavor to the product in which they are used, and although the taste will not be unpleasant, it probably will be too strong for most people. Clover, alfalfa, or another very light honey is best for making jellied fruit products. The honey should, if possible, be fresh becallcc rhe flavor of honey changes somewhat in storage.

Although jellied foods must be cooked in an open pot, they do not need to be processed in either boiling water or pressure steam like vegetables, meats, and other fruits that are stored in canning jars. You may seal jellied products with paraffin only, if they are firm. Fruit butters, preserves, conserves, and mar- malades are usually too soft to be sealed with paraffin. In warm, humid climates, where there is a chance that paraffin might melt, seal all jellied products in canning jars. Get glasses or jars ready before you start to make the jellied prod- uct. If you are using canning jars, make sure all jars and closures are perfect. Discard cracked or chipped jars. Wash the containers in warm, soapy water and rinse with hot water, so that they will not crack or break when hot liquids ace poured in them. Wash and rinse all lids and bands. Metal lids with sealing compound may need boil- ing or holding in water for a few minutes-follow the manufacturer’s directions. If you are using porcelain-lined zinc caps, have clean, new rings of the right size for jars. Wash the rings in warm, soapy water and rinse them well. Work quickly when packing and sealing jars. To keep fruit pieces from floating to the top, gently shake jars of jam occasionally as they cool. If you are using jars with two-piece lids, fill hot jars to I/S inch of the top with the hot fruit or jelly mixture. Wipe the rim clean, place a hot metal lid on the jar with the sealing compound or rubber next to the glass, screw the metal band down firmly to seal, and stand the jar upright to cool. If you arc using jars with porcelain-lined zinc caps, place a wet rubber ring on the jar, fill the jar to l/s inch of the top, screw the cap down tightly to seal, and stand upright to cool. If you are sealing your jars with paraffin, remember that you can only seal firm products with it. Ur#e only enough paraffin to make a layer l/s inch thick. A single thin layer can expand or contract readily and makes a better seal than one thick layer or two thin ones. Prick air bubbles in paraffin. Heating it over direct heat is dangerous because wax is flammable. Allow paraffined products to stand overnight before moving them about so that the wax can harden completely. Cover paraffined glasses with metal or paper lids. If you make more than one batch in a day, label each jar with the type of jellied product, the day it was made, and its batch number. For best quality, do not keep jellied fruit products for more than h months. Like many canned goods, they lose flavor in storage.

There are two ways you can make a jelly test. To make a spoon or sheet test, dip a cold metal spoon in the boiling jelly mixture. Then raise it at least a foot above the kettle, out of the steam, and turn the spoon so that the syrup runs off to one side. If the syrup forms two drops that flow together and fall off the spoon as one sheet, the jelly should be done. Remember that honey jellies will be slightly softer than jellies made with sugar. You can also use the refrigerator test for your jelly. Pour a small amount of boiling jelly on a cold plate and put it in the freezer com- partment of a refrigerator for a few minutes. If the mixture gels, it should be done. While you’re testing the jelly remove the cooking jelly from the heat.

If Your Jelliecl Fruit Products Failed There are many factors involved in making jellied fruit products. It is often hard to pinpoint one single factor that is responsible for a poor jelly, especially if you have little experience making jellies with honey. If you are using honey and your products are too runny, try using less honey next time. Honey jellies or jams tend to be softer than jams or jellies made with sugar because honey contains so much more moisture. If your jelly was too runny and you used added liquid pectin, use the powdered kind next time. It generally gels better with honey than does the liquid kind.

If you were making a jelly with fruit that rquircd 170 extra pectin, perhaps you cooked it too long. ji’crhaps sonit’ underripe fruit in the batch contributed extra pectin to the product.) If the jelly is gummy, it may have been overcooked. If jelly is improperly sealed, fermentation may occur or mold may develop. Any jelly that has mold on it should be thrown out. Jellied fruit products made with honey are generally a bit darker than those made with sugar; however, if your jellies or jams darken at the top of the jar, it might be because you stored them in too warm a place or because a faulty seal is allowing air to enter the jar. The color of jellied products can fade if they are stored in too warm a placcb or if kept in storage for too long a time. Red fruits, such as straw- berries or red raspberries, are especially likely to fade. If you’ve stirred your jams and preserves yroperly before jarring them, you should have no trouble with fruit floating to the surface. If you find fruit floating in your preserves, stir the preserve mixture gently for 5 minutes after removing it from the heat the next time you make preserves. Also, make sure that you’ve used fully ripe fruit, that it was cooked long enough, and that it was properly crushed or ground. Sometimes part of the liquid will separate from the jellied mass during storage. This could be the result of too much acid in the fruit or keeping the jelly in too warm a place. If there is no evidence of mold or spoilage, the jelly is still safe to eat. Uncooked Jams and Jellies If you miss the fresh flavor, color, and texture of fruit that is cooked away in most jams and jellies, and are concerned about de- stroying some of the fruit’s and the honey’s food value, you might like to try making some that are not cooked. Another nice thing about these jellied products is that all of them gel without sweetening, so you can use as little honey as you’d like. These jellies are not sterilized by boiling, so they must be poured into clean jars with tight-fitting lids and kept in the refrigerator for no more than about 3 weeks, or stored in the freezer, If you’re going to freeze them re- member to have a ‘/z-inch headspacc for expansion. There are recipes later in this chapter for uncooked jams and jellies. Some of these recipes ~132 natural gelatin instead of pectin. Generally, we’ve found that gelatin works better than pectin in rec- ipes that use honey rather than sugar, and this is because gelatin doesn’t require sweetening to make it gel,"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"208 VL~~Ptllblf’s nrrd Fmits Other recipes use agar-agar as the gelling ngcnt. Agar-agar is a transparent dried seaweed, rich in iodine, iron, and other trace cle- merits. To make jellies with ngar-agar, soak one-quarter of a */z-ounce package of dried agar-agar in 5’2 CLIP cold water until it’s soft. Then add to it 1 cup of concentrated fruit juice. Simmer the mixture for a min- ute or two, until the agar-agar dissolves. Sweeten to taste with honey. Pour into a jar, cool it down , and store in refrigerator or freezer. Using Low-Methoxyl Pectin Regular jams and jellies gel through cl11 interaction of pectin, acid, and sugar. Those made with added regular pectin arc not difftar- ent in this respect from cooked-down jellies which gel with the aid of the natural pectin of the fruits. Low-methoxyl pectin differs from both the commercial and natural pectin in fruits because it requires calcium salts (or a bonemeal-lemon juice mixture explained later), not sugar, to form its gel. Euell Gibbons originally discovered !ow- methoxyl pectin through his brother, a diaL,etic, who was exper- imenting with it for use in his own diet, and reported on his own experiments in O~KANIC CM)ENINL AND FAKMINC. At that time, Gib- bons’s big problem was obtaining a small quantity of the low- methoxyl pectin since it was commercially available in large quan- tities only. That problem has been solved for him-and for all of us- since CYalnut Acres, a natural foods store and mail-order com- pany, began handling low-methoxyl pectin and the calcium salts used with it. Using the low-methoxyl pectin and calcium for jr?!!\\,,-n:,:!;illg is very simple. t lere is how it is made: Prepare your fruit or juice. Generally, jam fruit is simmered until soft, then put through a sieve to reduce it to a pulp and to remove skins and seeds. Fruit for jelly is usually crushed, simmered, then dripped through a jelly bag or several thicknesses of cheesecloth to obtain a clear juice. You can also ~132 carliicd, bottled, or frozen juices. Measure your juice or fruit. Put it in a s;a~qm~ over medium heat and bring just to a boil. Next measure 98 cup honey and l/z teaspoon of low-methoxyl pectin to each cup of fruit or juice, c717d mix them wtlll in a mixing bowl. Pour this mixture into the freshly boiling juice or fruit, all at once, and stir, stir, stir until the honey Caned pectin arc completely dissolved. Now add I teaspoon of the calcium solution (% teaspoon"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"jam, ]cllics, nnd Fmit httcrs 209 calcium in VI cup water) for each cup of juice or fruit, and quickly stir until well mixed. The jelly cr jam is done and can be immediately poured into sterilized jars and sealed. However, one can test this jelly before sealing to see if it has exactly the right texture by putting about a tablespoonful in a metal cup and chilling it in the refrigerator. Such a small quantity chills very quickly; and as soon as it is cold, it will be the texture of your finished jelly. lf it is too stiff, add more juice to the pot; if it is too runny, add another teaspoon or so of the calcium solution. It is that simple. (Remember to remove your jelly or jam from the heat while you’re making this test.) This jelly and jam cannot be merely paraffined and set on the shelf. It must be sealed in sterilized jars with sterilized lids, for even the microorganisms that cause spoilage find these products good. The half-point, straight-sided mason jars that seal with two-piece dome lids are ideal. Sterilize jars by boiling them for 10 minutes, then leaving them in hot water until they are used. Heat the jelly or jam just to boiling point and pour it, boiling hot, into the sterilized jars, immediately sealing with the sterilized lids. When opened for use, the jar will keep perfectly well in the refrigerator for several weeks. It should be noted that since the original edition of this book came out, ORGANIC GARDENING AND FARMING food editor Nancy Albright has developed a substitute for the calcium salts used with this pectin. Her more natural and easily made bonemeal and lemon juice mixture works just as well. To make the bonemeal and Iernnll illjpn rr!,;:;,,,, lisle rugether l/4 teaspoon powdered bonemeal, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and Y4 cup water. Let it stand for 30 minutes, or until the bonemeal is completely dissolved, before using. For recipes using this bonemeal-lemon juice mixture and the low-methoxyl pectin, turn to the recipe section later in this chapter. The beauty of using low-methoxyl pectin is, of course, that since sugar isn’t necessary for gelling, you’re free to add as little or as much sweetening as you want. You also don’t have to worry about adding too much liquid (honey or fruit juice) because you can always adjust the gel of the mixture by adding more juice if it’s too stiff or more calcium if it is too runny. Low-methoxyl pectin and the calcium salts that you can use in- stead of the bonemeal-lemon juice mixture gelling action can be or- dered from Walnut Acres, Penns Creek, Pennsylvania 17862."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Recipes for Jams, Jellies, Marmalades, Preserves, and Conserves Apple Jelly Wash apples.

A big advantage of fruit butters is that they can be made in very large quantities. They also aren’t as delicate as jellies are: it isn’t essential to get them off the stove at exactly the right moment for fear they will not gel. Rather, fruit butters will thicken naturally as they cook down, so you won’t have to wcrry about test- ing your fruit for pectin or acid, or do a jelly test every other minute to find out if the mixture is thick or not. The test for thickness of a fruit butter is simple, fast, and easy: Put a dab of the butter on a plate, and let it set for a few minutes. If the dab does not separate, that is, if you don’t notice liquid at the edges of the drop, the butter is ready to be put up. However, there are disadvantages to making fruit butters. They have to be cooked for a long time-far longer than jams or jellies--"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"before they are ready to be put up. If you are making fruit butter on the top of the stove, they must be watched closely and stirled fre- quently so that they don’t burn or scorch. Scorched fruit butter is next to useless, and there are few worse feelings than burning 20 quarts of it. You’ll have to make fruit butter when you can spend the entire day in the kitchen so that you can stir it frequently. If, however, you ;Ire making the butter in a low oven, your constant attention is not needed. See a recipe for this kind of butter later in this chapter. Although fruit butters made with sugar have been known to keep for years without spoiling, it is still best to CON your butters. You can do this by processing both pint and quart jars in a boiling-water bath for 10 minutes. (See page 7h for directions for the boiling-water bath process.) Don’t allow these disadvantages to dissuade you from making at least some fruit butters-they have a long and honorable history. In German, the word LatzLltq originally meant prune or pear butter which the people of the Rhenish Palatinate made to keep their prunes and pears over the winter months. It often took up to 48 hours to prepare these fruit butters, but the time was spent in celebration as the preparation of the butter became the occasion of a folk festival. The descendants of these Germans, the Pennsylvania Dutch, brought Lt7fwtq with them when they came to Am.erica. In this country, the term came to be associated with apple butter because the Pennsylva- nia Dutch made huge quantities of apple butter in the fall, stirring apples and cider in huge kettles over an open fire. As you might imagine, this, too, was a festive event and often used as an “excuse” for courting. Like many other once-regional specialties, apple butter has been made available to most parts of the country by modern transportation and improved marketing facilities; but store-bought I spread just can’t match the taste of real, honest-to-goodness ~ homemade apple butter. I Equip tmwf A large kettle or pot with a heavy bottom is best for making fruit butters. Pennsylvania Dutch families used cast-iron pots slung on tripods over outdoor fires. If you’re making large quantities of fruit butters, you may wish to invest in a large stainless steel stockpot. (These pots also come in handy when you’re making soups, saucr- krauts, and other foods in large quantities.) Stockpots come in vari- ous sizes, from small to huge, and you can choose according to your taste and budget. Many restaurant supply stores will give you a good price on a second-hand stockpot. Aluminum stockpots are consider-"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"ably cheaper than those made from stainless steel, but don’t btl tcmp- ted by the lower price unless you plan to use it only for boiling-water bath processing. The acids in fruits may react with the aluminum and cause both a color and flavor change in your butters. Stainless steel is best because the metals in stainless steel are stable and will not react with acids in fruits and other foods. You may find that the bottum of stainless steel stockpots are thin and do not conduct heat evenly. If this is the case with your pot, buy an asbestos pad for the burner and place it under your pot when you are making fruit butters. This pad will spread the heat evenly over the bottom of the pot and will help to prevent hi-’ spots from developing. Some recipes recommend “baking” fruit butters in the oven. Ag,lin, stainless stet>l is good for this, and you may be able to buy a stainless steel pan from the same place you got YOLII’ stockpot. Glass casserole dishes arc good, too, if they are deep and wide (it is better to have a shallow layer of butter in a pan rather than a thick one-it cooks up faster). Enamel roasting pans are also good. Atldiq Elorlcy to Ymu Bu ttm You will notice that in most of the recipes that follow we recom- mend adding honey to taste when the butter has finished cooking down, rather than adding honey while the fruit is still cooking. If fruits are ripe or slightly overripe, the natural sugars in them are at their peak, and no extra sweetener may be necessary. You mC\\y spoil your butter by making it torj sweet if you add honey before tasting the finished product. The ingredients in most of the recipes below arc’ given in party rather than in actual measurements, like cups or pounds. We have done this so that you can easily adjust the quantities and use just the amount of fruit you have on hand. Apple Butter Some people feel that the best apple butter is made from un- peeled, uncorcd apples. Other people feel that there’s little diffcrenct> in taste between butter made from apples that \\z’erc peeled ‘end cored before they were cooked down, and LJut tcr niad~ from ,1pplt5 that wert‘ ccjokcd whole dnd then put thrtjugh J food mill or fruit prcsb to removt~ the skins and seeds. The choice is up to you, but we offer J little advice: If you’re not concerned about the slight diKt*rcIncc in taste in the finished butter iliid want tu stl\\ e yourself d little time, peel and core vour apples first, bec,&~use it’s more work to rcmovc the shills and seeds later on by using a food mill or fruit press."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"\\nms, lcllies, ~~ut.i Fmi t B1.r ttcrs 229 The recipe below is given for those who are using unpeeled and uncared apples. If you are peeling and coring yours, leave out the step that tells you to run your fruit through the fruit press. 1 part cider 2 parts apples, unpeeled and uncared, sliced thin Put t!ie cider in a big pot and bring ii to a boil. Add the apples slowly, being careful not to splatter yourself when you do. Allow the apples and cider to come to a boil, then simmer, stirring frequently to prevent sticking (and do remember to stir). When the apple butter has begun to thicken considerably, the apple slices will start to fall apart as you stir the butter. At some point after the butter has thickened, remove it from the heat and put every- thing through a fruit press, discarding the peels, seeds.. and stems. (If you have peeled and cored your apples, omit this step.) Put the remaining soupy mixture back in the pot, put the pot back on the heat, and simmer until the apple butter is a thick, dark brown mass. (One old cookbook says, ‘I. . . til the liquid becomes concrete-in other words, till the amalgamated cider and apple become as thick as hasty pudding.“) Test to see if the apple butter has thickened. If it has, you may want to sweeten it. Use honey and sweeten to taste. You may also want to add spices to your apple butter. If so, add cinnamon, allspice, and ground cloves to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil, and jar the apple butter in hot, sterilized jars, leaving a G-inch headspace. Screw the lids on tightly. Process pints and quarts for 10 minutes in a boiling-water bath. Remove from heat and seal jars if necessary. Cool them on a wire rack and store cooled jars in a cool, dark place.

Even though the skins outside of these foods may be in pretty poor shape, the juice locked inside the plant cells can be salvaged, and then canned or frozen for drinking, or for using in soups, desserts, and casseroles later in the year. It’s true, of course, that whole fruits and vegetables ttave a pro- portionately greater food value than their juices; this is because the fiber, pulp, and skin are intact. l-lowever, by making juices from less than perfect produce, you’re capturing many of the vitamins, miner- als, and enzymes that would otherwise be lost if the whole foods were left to spoil.

The delicate flavor of most fruit juices can be spoiled by the high temperatures of a long boiling-water bath.

A steam juicer is a combination of pans that enables water to be boiled, with the steam produced moving to a colanderlike basket holding fruit. When exposed to the hot steam, the fruit easily yields its clear juice, which is caught in a pan below the colander that has a11 6utlet for draining off juice into L>ottles. Thorough washing of the fruits or vegetables is the only preparation 7 necessary except for cut- ting the larger or firmer foods for quicker extraction of the juice. This is a marvelous time saver when juicing elderberries, cherries, or other small foads-fruits go into the juicer stems, seeds, pits, skins, and all. Steam juicers have been around for some time, but until recently they all were made of aluminum. If there is one thing we don’t care for, it’s using aluminlml for preparing foods, especially acid foods that are heated for some time, as juice is. Acids react with aluminum to form an aluminum salt that can then be transferred to food by the liquid.

We poured an inch of Lvatcr into a jar on which the rubber had already been put, stirred in a cup of sugar until it had dissolved (we used brown or m.lple sugar, or hot maple syrup), poured in 1 I!- ‘7 cups of fruit, tilled the jar to brimming with boiling water, screwed on the cap, and that was all.

This will allow proper fermentation without adding the air- borne “vinegar-bug.‘,’ After 3 or 3 days sediment will begin settling on the bottom as fermentation beads rise to the top.

As soon as you feel liquid in your mouth, pinch off this end with your fingers and insert into empty container which should stand well below the filled one. Naturally all this equipment should be scrupulously clean. Rack off only the clear liquid; do not disturb the sediment at the bottom. If you prefer a cider with more zip and on the dry side, allow “must” to keep standing in warm room. In about II) days it will begin frothing and may foam over the top.

With d bushel or more vi fillit tc) grind, it is best to use d fruit press. Be sure it is a Irl7r,lf -frui t press, with a cutting cylincler that minces the toughest apples with no strain at all. The portable presses are hand-operated, though there are power-driven models too. Gather all your fruit together and pick over for decayed or wormy speci mcns, especially if picked from the ground. Hose it down and allow to dry in sun for ab~~ut 3 days, sprc;~d out on rachs or bt~n~hes. A bush~~l of applt~s, thoroughly squrcmd, will yitald 3 galions of iulct>, so g,luge your container needs accordingly. All jugs, bot tlus, and kegs should be scrupulously clean. You will also need a large tub-not metal-to hold crushed pulp, a smaller one to catch juice runoft, and a clean muslin sack for juice pressing of p~11p. Set up vour fruit press outdoors to facilitate easier handling and subsequent cleanup. If it’s raining, or is too cold, work in a garage or shed. Apples should not be used when rain-wet. The operation of the press is so simple and self-evident that no instructions will be needed. With two people at the task-one cranking the grinder, the other feeding the cutting hopper--a bushel of apples can be ground up in 15 minutes. No need to peel or cut up fruit when using a hard-fruit model; the cutting cylinder takes the toughest apple whole in stride. But /7tl :.l~rt’/‘r/l, keep hands and fingers away from rotating blades. As the p~~lp receptacle fills up, transfer the mash into your tub and repeat until all fruit is ground up. Be sure the smaller vessel is placed wIlere it will catch all escaping juice. Now fill the muslin sack with only enough pomace to fit the juicer weil, which is usually built under the mash well. Crank the presser handle until no more juice runs and repeat the process with the rest of the pulp. All sclueczcd juice may be temporarily contained in a wooden tub or a crock.

Turning Your Apple Cider into Vinegar The hard part of making apple cider vinegar is extracting the juice, and if you’ve followed the directions above, you’ve already done that. The rest is simple. It is just a matter of allowing the ex- tracted apple juice to ferment past the stage of sweet cider and dry cider into the vinegar stage. Pour the strained apple juice into a crock, a watertight wooden container, dark-colored glass jars, or jugs. If you don’t want your fermenting juice to run all over the floor, you’d better leave ample headspace-about 2S percent of the container--for the juice to expand during fermentation. Cover your container with something that will keep dust, insects, and animals out, but let air in. A triple layer of cheesecloth, clean sheet material, or a tea towel will dcr nicely. Stretch this material over your crock, jars, or whatever, and tie it tightly with string. Store your brew in a cool, dark place, like an unheated base- ment or garage. Now sit back and wait while the juice does all the rest of the work. Fermentation will take from 4 to 6 months. After about 4 months, remove the cover and taste the vinegar. If it is strong enough for your liking, strain it in a triple layer of cheesecloth, pour it into bottles, and seal with caps or corks. If the vinegar is too weak, let it work longer, testing it everv week or so, until it is strong enough for you. If, when finished, your vinegar is too weak, add some store- bought kind. If it’s too strong, dilute it with a little water. The “scum” or layer that forms on top of the vinegar during fermentation is called t!-,e “mother.” This is what you want to strain off when your vinegar is strong enough so that it stops working. You can save this “mother” to use as a starter for vour next batch of vinegar. Just pour your apple juice-or any other fruit juice or wine-into a crock, wooden container, or dark glass jars, add the “mother” and let it ferment. In a little while you’ll have vinegar. Picklirlg ‘c&h Horntwadt~ Viqm It is a risky business pickling food with homemade vinegar be- cause, unlike store-bought vinegar which has a controlled acid con- tent, the acidity of homemade vinegar varies. If you wish to pickle with your own vinegar, we suggest that you make small batches at a time so that you won’t stand the chance of ruining all your relish or chowchow."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"248 vq1 h7llkS ar11i Fr-llifl; .‘-itv+ Vimy7 I’S While we don’t advise pick nothing wrong with adding a .ling with lir~niemade v incgar, t litare ic few herbs and spices tc) your honit- brew. Herb vinegar is delicious and very t’asy to makh. Just add individual herbs like tarragon or garlic, or r~ combination of voul favorites to your vinegar. Louise and Cyrus Hyde, ol%Vners of Well-Sweep tlerb Farnl in Port Murray, New Jersey, make herb vinegar for friends, lrisitors to their organic farm, and of course for themselves. Although almost any herb can be added to vinegar, they have found a few to be the most popular. The favorites are tarr‘lgon vinegal’, basil and tarragon vinegar, and basil and garlic vinegar. C’)thtBr popular kinds arc’ dill vinegar (made from scleds and It:aves); rosemary vintlgclr, a purple- !illtc\\d vinegar made from opal basil and sweet basil leaves; orange- mf . ,t vinegar for fruit salads; and cucumber-tl‘lvorecl salad burnet vi!7r ,;ar. Because the Hydes like to have herbs floating in their bottled vii: i;ars, they add fresh sprigs of herbs-about a hadhi or 3 or 3 spr ,;s--to each quart of vinegar. ‘The mixture is allowed to set at least You c:an make herb vinegar simply by adding fresh sprigs of herbs to bottles of vinegar, as shown here.

If you prefer herb vinegar without the leaves floating in it, crum- ble about 3 tablespoons of dried leaves in a jar. If you’re ,ldding herb seeds, such as dill or anise, crush them well first. Then warm your vinegar and pour it over the herbs. The warm vinegar decomposes the leaves and extracts oil from the herbs more quickly than cool vinegar. Let the vinegar and herbs set for 2 to 4 weeks in a covered bottle or crock. Stainless steel and porcelain containers are also fine, but never use any other metal because the acid in vinegar will react with it and give your herb vinegar an undesirable appearance and taste. After a few weeks, test your vinegar to see if it is flavorful enough for you. When its flavor is right, strain it into sterilized jars and cap until you’re ready to use it. The Hydes like the distinct flavor of apple cider vinegar, but find that when used alone with herbs, its strong flavor masks the more subtle flavor of the herbs. For this reason they prefer to mix apple cider vinegar with the milder-tasting white, distilled vinegar before they add herbs to it. Here are a few herb and spiced vinegar recipes that you might like to try in addition to the Hyde’s suggestions: Basil and Garlic Wine Vinegar Place a handful of fresh basil leaves in a 4-quart stainless steel 01 enamel pot. Crush the leaves with a spoon or potato masher and add 2l/2 quarts of cider vinegar. Turn heat up high and bring quickly to a boil.

Place another handful of fresh basil leaves in the pot, crock, or wide- mouthed bottle, and pour the strained vinegar, cover, and allow to steep for 10 more days.

There are some very simple things you can do with the excess. You can open a roadside stand (if you can sell raw milk in your state-some don’t allow it unless you have certification, and some don’t allow it at all), or sell it from door-to-door, you can give it away to friends, or you can store it for times when your animal’s milk production is at its lowest. Here, we’d like to spend some time discussing the third alternative: storing milk. Just how do you preserve this highly perishable food? One of the simplest ways is to freeze it. Milk may be frozen whole or skimmed, pasteurized or raw. Even cream can be frozen. To freeze, pour your milk or cream into glass jars or plastic containers, leaving 2 inches headspace for expansion. Seal tightly and place in the coldest part of your freezer so that it freezes quickly. Whole milk will keep safely in the freezer for 4 to 5 months; cream should not be stored frozen for more than 2 or 3 months. Both milk and cream should be thawed for 2 hours at room temperature before using. The only problem you will encounter when freezing cream is that the butterfat tends to separate out during freezing. For this reason, thawed cream has limited uses. It can’t be used successfully as is, poured into coffee or over cereal or fruit. It may not whip properly, but it can be successfully used for frozen desserts, like ice cream. If you want to use it for cooking-to make creamed soups, gravies, custards, and the like-or for baking, beat it a little first just so the butterfat is not floating on top. 275"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Making A time-honored way of preserving cream is to churn it into butter. Although butter is also a perishable food, it will keep longer than milk or cream under refrigeration if all the buttermilk is worked out of it. Because butter is a concentrated form of cream-l gallon of cream will yield about 3 pounds of butter-it takes up a lot less storage space than cream. Separating the Cream The first step in butter-making is to separate the cream from the milk. This is easy to do if you’re using cow’s milk. The butterfat in cream is lighter in weight than the other ingredients in whole milk and will rise to the top naturally by gravity in 24 to 36 hours. There are two simple methods of separating the cream: the shallow-pan method and the deep-setting method. In the shallow- pan method, the milk is drawn from the cow and immediately poured into shallow tubs or pans. These pans or tubs are placed in a cool spot like a refrigerator, basement, or springhouse for at least 24 hours. The cream that has risen to the top is then skimmed off with a flat dipper. Although this is certainly the easiest way to separate cream, some farmers object to this method because during the time it takes for the cream to rise, the surface of the milk is exposed to the air and frequently absorbs or develops objectionable odors and tastes. A more satisfactory method of separating cream is by the deep- setting method. By this method, the milk is drawn from the cow and immediately poured into cans or buckets which are placed in cold water or, preferably, ice water for 12 hours. The quick cooling of the milk causes the cream to rise more rapidly and more completely. The 276"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Making Butter 277 cream can be skimmed in half the time required by the shallow-pan method, and its freshness and sweet flavor are retained. Separating Goat’s Milk If it’s goat’s milk you’re working with, the job is a little more difficult. The fat globules in goat’s milk are small and well emulsified, which means that the cream will take much longer to separate out than cow’s cream. If you let goat’s cream take its time to separate out, it may begin to develop a strong “goaty” flavor that most people find unappetizing. To separate the cream properly and quickly, a cream separator, which separates the cream from the skim milk by centrifugal force, is needed. Warm milk (be- tween 80” and 90°F.) is poured into the separator where it is whirled around. The cream and skim milk are released through separate spouts in minutes, while both are still warm and fresh. Some cow owners like to use a cream separator instead of letting their cow’s cream separate by gravity, because the separator removes almost every drop of the butterfat from the milk very quickly. The skim milk is fat-free and can be used immediately for drinking or for making cottage cheese. A cream separator is a delicate piece of equipment and should be cleaned and operated according to the manufacturer’s directions. For best results, milk poured into the separator should be warm (not below 90°F.) and fresh. Most separators are left in the milk room or other unheated area. In winter, the cold temperatures can chill the instrument, and if the separator is cold enough, it will cool the first milk that is poured in to below 90°F. To prevent this from happening, warm the separator by running warm water through it before pour- ing in the milk. The separator should be cleaned and sterilized immediately after each use. All parts should be rinsed in warm water and then scrub- bed with a brush, warm water and soda ash or a cleansing powder made especially for use in dairies. Soap should not be used because it is difficult to wash off completely and may leave a soapy film on the equipment. All the parts of the separator should be sterilized in a farm sterilizer or in boiling water for 5 minutes. New cream separators aren’t cheap. Most run from $300 to $600. Used ones arc cheaper, of course, but since the popularity of keeping goats for milk has increased in the last few years, the demand for used separators is growing and the supply is diminishing. Chilling and Ripening the Cream It is not very practical to churn a few cups of cream at a time, so many farmers who have just one or two milk-producing animals will"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"278 Dairy Products collect cream over a few days, waiting until they have enough sepa- rated to make churning worthwhile. This is fine, but don’t hold cream for more than 4 days before making butter. Butter made from old cream has an acidic, overripe taste, and it spoils quickly. If you are collecting cream over a few days’ time, keep its temperature below 50°F. and don’t add to it any cream that is not cooled to at least this temperature. The addition of warm cream raises the temperature of the older cream and hastens souring. Mix all the cream together-after it is all chilled- 12 to 20 hours before you churn it, and stir it occasionally with a stirring rod (a smooth rod with a 4- to 5-inch diameter disk on one end) or long-handled spoon so that it will have a uniform thickness. The best way to cool cream rapidly is to cool it in a tub of ice water. Ice water will cool the cream more quickly than will re- frigerator temperatures, providing the water is allowed to circulate on all sides as well as under the cream container. If ice water is not available, use plain water, but change it frequently. If you are fortu- nate enough to have a stream or spring nearby, put your container of cream in it. Its flowing cold water will do a fine job of cooling your cream. Pick a shaded spot-out of direct sunlight-set down your cream container, and cover it with a clean towel or piece of cheese- cloth to keep out dirt, insects, or other contaminants. When the cream has reached a temperature of 50°F. it can be placed in a cool spot until churning. (Get yourself a floating dairy thermometer, available at farm supply and some hardware stores, to measure temperatures accurately.) All cream should be kept at 52” to 60°F. in the summer and 58” to 66°F. in the winter while it is being churned. If the cream is too warm when it is churned, the butter develops too soon and is too soft and greasy. If the cream is too cold when churned, not all of the butterfat will separate out to form butter. This results in creamy buttermilk and less butter. Cow’s cream which is allowed to ripen before it is churned will produce more flavorful butter than that which is made from sweet cream. You can ripen raw cream by allowing it to set at room temper- ature (65” to 75°F.) until it is thick and slightly sour. To ripen milk quickly, add about “2 cup cultured buttermilk or yogurt. Frclsh cream should not be added after ripening begins. Once ripcncd, the cream should be cooled quickly in a container of ice water Gntil it reaches churning temperature.

The wooden churn more commonly found in operation today is the barrel churn. Electrically powered and hand- operated glass churns are also popularly sold. If you want to make just a small amount of butter you don’t even need a real churn. You can improvise with a blender, cake mixer, or even a hand rotary beater. Early American settlers made butter by shaking cream in a deep wooden lidded bowl. You can use a glass jar. Pour cream into a jar until it is one-third full and start shaking. This is a rather tedious way of making butter and it calls for a strong arm, but it does work. Whatever device you use to churn butter, make sure it is thor- oughly clean before any cream is poured into it. If you have a wooden churn that is used only occasionally, it is advisable to fill it with water 24 hours before you plan to use it so that the wood will swell and be watertight. Scald the wooden churn with boiling water and then chill it down to churning temperature by filling it with ice water or placing it in a refrigerator, springhouse, or cool basement before using, Glass churns, mixers, blenders, rotary beaters, and glass jars should be sterilized in boiling water and cooled before using. Pour the cream into your chum, blender, or whatever equipment you are using through a strainer to make sure that there are no lumps in the cream before you begin. Fill your churn only one-third full. Butter made from goat’s cream is white. If you wish to color it, now is the time. Add a few drops of vegetable coloring to attain the desired shade of yellow. (Colonial housewives colored their butter with car- rot juice.) If you are using a hand-operated or electric churn, churn about 10 times and then lift up the lid or remove the plug to permit gas to escape. Chum 20 times more and allow gas to escape again. Then resume churning, at about 60 revolutions per minute, until beads of butter about the size of corn kernels form. The churning process should take about 30 to 40 minutes.

Pour as much clean water as there is buttermilk into the churn after the buttermilk is poured off. Close the churn and churn it a few times to wash the butter.

The churning temperature is too low. Normally, it should be 52” to 60°F. in summer and S8” to 66°F. in the winter, but under exceptional conditions it might be necessary to raise it to 65” to 70°F. This is especially trtie if your churn is very cold and you are churning in an unheated area on an exceptionally cold day. 2. The cream is too thin or too thick. It should be about 30 percent butterfat for best results. 3. The cream is too sweet. Very sweet cream will need to be churned longer than cream which has been ripened until it is thick and slightly sour. Ripening can be speeded up by adding about 112 cup of a starter, like cultured buttermilk or yogurt, to the cream. 4. The churn is too full. The churn should not be more than one-third full, no matter what type of equipment you are using for churning. The extra space allows the butterfat to move about freely. 5. Ropy fermentation of the cream preventing concussion. This may be prevented by sterilizing all the utensils and producing milk and cream under sanitary conditions. If additional measures arc needed, pasteurize the cream, being careful to keep it from contamination after pasteurization. Then ripen the cream with a starter before churning. 6. Individuality of the animal. The only remedy is to obtain cream from a dairy animal recently fresh or cream that is known to churn easily. Before ripening it, mix it with cream that is difficult to churn."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"284 Dniry Products 7. The goat or cow being far advanced in the period of lactation. The effects may at least be partially overcome by adding, before ripening, some cream from another goat or cow that is not far advanced in the period of lactation. 8. Feeds that produce hard fat. Such feeds are cottonseed meal and timothy hay. Linseed meal, gluten feed, and succulent feeds such as silage and roots tend to overcome the condition and make churning the cream into butter easier. 9. Off-flavor of butter. Influenced by cow’s feed. Refrain from giving cows strong-flavored and strong-odored foods like turnips. If off-flavor persists, milk cows before, not after, feeding. Snltiug and Storing tlw Butter Butter which is worked free of all its buttermilk and wash water may be eaten or stored as it is. This is unsalted, sweet butter. Salt, which enhances the flavor and lengthens butter’s keeping quality, may be added at this time, if you wish. If you salt the butter, add 2/3 tablespoon of salt for each pound (2 cups) of butter. Work the salt into the butter by pressing and thinning the butter in the bowl with the wooden paddle, then adding a little salt and folding the butter over. Repeat this process until all the salt is worked in and the butter is firm and waxy. Don’t spread the butter to thin it; this causes the butter t P become oily and lose its firm texture. When the butter is “worked,” it is ready to Lje placed in appro- priate containers and stored. You can roll your butter into a ball (or balls) and wrap it in aluminum foil or heavy-duty plastic wrap. You can press it into small bread pans and cover the pans with wrap. Or you can put the butter into glass jars with lids. It is not a good idea to store butter in plastic containers. These containers are porous and will allow air and strong odors to penetrate their walls. The taste of butter deteriorates the longer it is stored in the refrigerator. Keep it no longer than 2 weeks at refrigerator temperatures. If you wish to keep your butter longer than 2 weeks, freeze it at temperatures of 0°F. or colder. Do not keep it frozen for more than 6 months. Thaw butter for about 3 hours at refrigerator temperatures before using."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Making and Semihar Cheeses Cheese is one of those foods which has a certain mystique as- sociated with it-l -haps because there are so many kinds. Incorpo- rated in this mystique is the idea that making cheese is something not to be attempted by amateurs. This is just not so. There are many amateur cheese-makers around who make some pretty good cheeses. lngredien ts The main ingredient in cheese is of course milk-and you need lots of it. To make 1 pound of hard cheese like cheddar you’ll need 5 quarts of milk, and for 1 pound of cream cheese or about 1% pounds of cottage cheese you’ll need 4 quarts of milk. While a pound or so of cream or cottage cheese is an adequate amount to make at one time, there’s not much sense in making less than 3 to 5 pounds of hard or semihard cheese at a time because smaller cheeses dry out too quickly. So figure you’ll need at least 15 quarts (or 33/4 gallons) of milk to make one batch of hard or semihard cheese. You can make cheese out of fresh raw milk, or homogenized, pasteurized milk. Both will work, and most of the recipes that follow give directions for both. However, if you’re going to buy homogenized, pasteurized milk at supermarket prices, your homemade cheese can turn out to be mighty expensive. Your cheese will be a lot more economical (and many people claim better tasting) if you can find yourself a farmer or homesteader who will sell you fresh raw milk. It goes without saying that if you have your own cow or goat your milk will be the cheapest, freshest, and, in milking sea- son, most plentiful. Most cheese recipes also call for a starter or an activator; some call for two. This is a substance that contains beneficial bacteria that will 285"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"286 Dairy Products make the milk clabber or, in other words, separate the curds from the whey. Raw milk contains the beneficial bacteria that are responsible for making milk clabber, so technically you don’t have to use an activator with raw milk. But in most recipes an activator is used with raw milk because it speeds up the clabbering process and guarantees that the milk won’t sour before it clabbers sufficiently. Pasteurized milk definitely needs an activator to clabber since the beneficial bac- teria have been killed off in the heating process. Cultured buttemilk contains the activating bacteria. Don’t use the kind that you pour off your homemade butter because it doesn’t have the bacteria. The kind to use is the thick supermarket kind-make sure it’s fresh!

Rennirt is an extract made from the lining of unweaned calves’ stomachs, and it can be bought in the form of rennet tablets. Rennet tablets used to be found in almost all grocery and drugstores, but that was when home cheese-making was commonplace. You still might be able to find them in some such stores, but if you can’t, check in a hobby store that sells cheese-making equipment or in one of the catalogs listed on page xiii. There are some herbs, too, that have the milk-clabbering proper- ties of rennet, yogurt, and buttermilk. Nettle, the sorrels (lemon and common), fermitory, and the sap of the unripe fig will all curdle milk. But according to internationally known herbalist Juliette de Ba’iracli Levy, the giant purple thistle is the best of the herbal milk clabberers.

Plain Semihard Cheese Current United States Department of Agriculture publications offer no practical information on making cheese, and few cookbooks give explicit enough directions. The best way to get solid information on cheese is to go to someone who makes a lot of it and ask him or her how it’s done. This is just what we did. David Page is an organic gardener and an assistant professor of biochemistry at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. He is also an amateur cheese-maker who turns out some great-tasting cheeses.

Aipeniq the Milk YcT*r cheese is doomed to failure if your milk is not ripened prope. /T . The idea is to inoculate the milk to be used with a lac- tobacillus culture in order that other strains of bacteria don’t get a chance to grow during aging and thus ruin the cheese. Obtaining a culture is simple-just use cultured buttermilk from the store. Take a quart of fresh cultured buttermilk and add about V4 cup to each of four clean, scalded quart mason jars. Fill up the jars with fresh pasteurized milk. Seal with clean caps, shake, and allow to stand for 24 hours at room temperature. This gives yt u 4 quarts of fresh but- termilk, which you can also use for other things. You can put your culture in the refrigerator and use as needed. The culture can be perpetuated merely by repeating the foregoing process with your last jar of buttermilk at any given time. This is known as better living through bacteriology. Get the biggest canning kettle you can find. David uses a 36- quart kettle which is pretty heavy when it is full. A 24-quart canning kettle is all right, but your cheese will be smaller. The kettle must be enameled. Stainless steel is fine but aluminum is a “no-no.” Add the contents of 1 quart of buttermilk to whichever kettle you are using. Then pour in sufficient milk to fill your kettle to within 2 inches of the top, and mix with a clean spoon. David uses raw milk for making cheese, but pasteurized milk is OK, too. The milk should not be more than 2 days old (having been refrigerated of course) and may be skimmed if desired. Warm the milk up to 86” to 90°F. over low heat and allow to ripen for 1 to 2 hours.

There are vari- ous appliances one can make to do the pressing job, but you may not have the time to make one. Using the erudite method given above, you have to watch out for several things. First, if your bowls are too deep, they will just come together under pressure and the curd won’t get pressed. Also, if the books slip off at an angle, your final wheel of cheese will be lopsided-so be sure to distribute your weights above the curd evenly. A bit of intelligence and ingenuity could come up with a much better way of pressing the curd. After 12 hours, you will have a nice compact wheel of cheese. Strip off the cheesecloth and wind a fresh band of cloth around where the old girdle was. Fasten again with safety pins. The reason for doing this is that the cheese at this point is quite plastic, and if the sides of the wheel are not supported, the cheese will tend to flatten as it forms a rind.

Place the finished cheese in a cool place on a clean surface and turn once every few days. If there is mold growth under the paraffin don’t worry, it won’t invade the cheese. If the cheese starts to swell, you’ve got troubles. Such behavior indicates that your milk was not properly ripened and that a “bad” microorganism is enjoying your cheese. Other than bad bacteria, the other big enemy of ripening cheese is most notably small animals.

The cheese will become sharper the older it gets. This completes the basics of making a good homemade cheese. 01~1 can add vqrious herbs and natural coloring agents to the milk after it has ripened in order to obtain a “different” cheese. Now that you’ve got the basics, here are a few more semihard and halLI cheese recipes sent into ORGANIC GARDENING AND FARMING and tested in our experimental kitchen: Cheddar Cheese “Cheddaring” is a str’p in cheese-making that involves removing whey with dry heat from previously heated and drained curd. In commercial production, cheddaring is accomplished by placing drained curd in a heated chamber. When the steady, gentle heat causes the curd to mat together, it is cut into slabs that are turned for even drainage. Before pressing, the slabs of curd are shredded in a special machine. The moisture content of cheeses made in this way is around 40 percent on a scale where cottage cheese stands at 80 percent and Parmesan cheese at 30 percent. Many cheeses are cheddared besides the ones called “Cheddar” cheese. Monterey Jack and longhorn are examples. Because cheddared cheeses have a lower moisture content than the fresh or semisoft types, they can usually be aged for a longer time. It is largely the bacterial action during the aging of the cheese that leads to a fuller taste, and generally, the older the cheese, the sharper the flavor. Cheddared cheeses usually have a higher butteriat content than fresh cheeses, and this creaminess prevents them from develop- ing a dry or crumbly texture as they age. To add cheddaring to your repertoire no specialized equipment is needed. Think of the heat chamber for drying the curd as a kind of “sauna” for your curd. Then vou will be able to devise any number of arrangements depending upon what colanders, strainers, racks, and kettles arc on hand. As for the shredding, you could take out your grinder, but you will not have too much curd to break up by hand if that st’f2ms easier. Here is a six-step method for cheddaring cheese with equipment normally available in a well-stocked kitchen. The first two steps art’ the same as those followed in making the semihard cheese just dcscribc~d,"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Making Hard and Semihard Cheeses 295 The secret in cheddaring is removing the whey with dry heat from previously heated and drained curd. Do this by making a “sau- na” by placing the colan- der with the curd on a rack inside a larger kettle. Put a small amount of water in the bottom of the pot and allow the whey to drain in a warm place for 2 hours. 1. Prepare about 4 gallons of milk with rennet as explained in the directions on page 287. Cut the curd when it forms and heat it slowly until a firm “popcorn” curd is reached. (It looks uniformly like popcorn, and not like cut-up Jello cubes.) It is all right if the curd is “squeaky.” Let the curd s.it for at least I hour before draining. 2. Drain curd into the colander of an enamel blancher and let stand over a bucket for l/z hour. 3. Make a “sauna” for the curd by placing the colander with the curd on a rack inside a larger kettle with a small amount of hot water in the bottom. Leave kettle in a warm enough place so that whey will continue to drain for 2 hours or so-the back of the wood stove is excellent. The temperature of the curd during this time should ideally be between 100” and l.lO”F. During this time the curds should mat together into a single mass. Turn the whole thing once or twice to insure cvcn heating. Pour off whey if necc:ssary to prevent the curds from soaking in it. At the end of the first hour, slice the mass into 5 or 6 slabs an inch or so wide"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"291; Dairy Prodrlcts and continue heating, turning the slabs occasionally. The whole process need not be rushed. 4. Shred up the curd by hand or by putting it through a grinder of some kind. In a large bowl mix the curd with 2 to 3 tablespoons salt and whatever other seasonings are desired. The curd should have a p!easantly salty taste. Because the curds will not press properly unless warm, and because they coo! off quickly during the shredding step, it is a good idea to put the bowl of salted curd, covered, in a slow oven for I/Z hour or so before pressing. 5. Pack the curd into a press cylinder lined with cheesecloth and press with considerable weight overnight. 6. After pressing, remove cheesecloth, rub the cheese with coarse salt, and allow a natural rind to form over 3 or 4 days. Wax, date, and store the cheese in a cool place, turning once a week or so. If the storage place is between 45” and SO”F. the cheese should keep from 3 to 5 months. Thistlehead Cheese The giant purple thistle, used in the Balearic Islands but also found throughout the United States, is the best of all the herbs for clabbering milk. It is speedy in action (usually curdles milk over- night) and it is sure. The giant purple thistle is a very tall-growing species of thistle, possessing all over very cruel prickles, so that no animals can eat it, and only the bees visit it and the goldfinches carry off the down- topped seeds for their nests and for food. The stems and foliage are grayish, and the flowerheads a rich purple, and of typical thistle shape. The part used are the flowerets when the thistlehead and the flowerets of which it consists have turned brown. When the thistledown begins to appear it is getting too late for the gathering, and the flowerets are less strong and soon will be carried away over the countryside by the wind. The flowerets should be air dried, either in shallow baskets or perforated brown paper bags, and then stored in jars to last until the next summel The herb, in carefully controlled quantity, has to be prepared for adding to the milk.

The herb is then strained and then a heaping teaspoon of the herbal liquid is added to every quart of warm milk. If too much herb is used, it tastes strongly in the cheese, and it will cause indigestion, being a very potent herb. Therefore, be careful not to add too much. (Instead of making a liquid from the herb, you can also dip the whole herb in the milk to make it adhesive, press the flowerets to- gether, and bind them with coarse white cotton thread into a sort of rough plait, leaving the long end of the cotton hanging out of the crock, so you can pull out the herb when the milk curdles, which is approximately overnight. Do not add the herb loose into the milk, as it is then like having hairs in one’s mouth when consuming the delicious soft curds and whey.) When really thick curds have formed in the crock, usually after a few hours to a day or night, depending on the warmth of the weather, finish the rest of the cheese-making process by following the di- rections for semihard cheese, starting with Pressing the Curd. Greek Headcheese Although this is called headcheese, it contains no meat like other headcheeses do. To make a small, round head approximately 6 inches across and 3 inches thick, start with 6 quarts of raw milk in a large pot. Although cow’s milk may be used, to make this cheese the tradi- tional way use goat’s or ewe’s milk. Begin now to soak a straw basket in warm water until it becomes pliable. Make sure it hasn’t been colored in any way or it will bleed onto the cheese. Keep the basket pliable until ready to use. Heat milk until it’s lukewarm to the touch. Add 1 crushed rennet tablet dissolved in ‘14 cup of water and stir briskly for 1 minute. Remove milk from heat and let set. Do not disturb during this time. Leave until milk has thickened like yogurt, about 25 to 30 minutes. Your finger, when poked into the mixture, should come out clean. Put thickened milk back on the stove and heat until just warm. Stir briskly 5 to 10 minutes until the mixture turns back to milk. Remove from heat. Using a perforated spoon, stir slowly in one direc- tion only, around and around the pot. You can start to fee! the lumps of cheese forming after about 3 revolutions. Gather the cheese to one side of the pot with your spoon and scoop it into your hands.

Sprinkle top with 2 teaspoons of salt and leave the basket draining in a colander or on a cookie rack for 7 or 8 hours. When thoroughly drained, remove the cheese from the bashet and salt the exterior thoroughly. Store uncovered in a dry, airy place to ripen. You can eat the cheese at this point or freeze it if you wish, but it will have a much different taste after being stored in a cool (but not freezing) place in a barrel of brine. Before brining, turn cheese every other day and salt again. In 2 to 3 weeks it will form a hard rind and can then be stored in a wooden barrel of salt brine where it will keep indefinitely. To make the brine, dissolve 2 cups of pickling salt in 1 gallon of water. Weight down cheese head with a plate and clean rock so it will stay immersed in the brine. When you want to use your cheese remove it from the brine and rinse well. Storing Cheese Semihard cheese, like the ones David Page and Juliette de Bai’racli Levy make, and others, like cheddar, American, Swiss, and provolone, should be kept under refrigeration after aging. To prevent these cheeses from drying out, they may be wrapped in a thin piece of cloth or cheesecloth which has been moistened with water, a weak salt water solution, or a mild vinegar. Check the cheese occasionally and dampen the cloth when it becomes dry. To prevent the cut edges of a round of cheese from drying out, spread butter or a very light- tlavored oil on the cut ends of the round before wrapping and re- frigerating it. If you plan to keep the cheese for more than a few weeks, it may be frozen. Semihard cheeses do not freeze very well-they become a bit crumbly and begin to lose their flavor after a few months at freezer temperatures -but some people do not mind this slight loss in qual- ity. If you wish to freeze your cheese, cut it into small pieces of about l/z pound each, and wrap each piece well in moisture-proof paper. In small pieces, the cheese will freeze quickly, and there will be little damage done to the cheese’s flavor and texture. Wrapped properly, semihard cheeses will keep for 6 months in the freezer. In order to enjoy the full flavor of the cheese, it should be brought to room temperature before serving. Avoid exposing the cheese to high temperatures which cause the cheese to sweat and lose some of the fat captured in the curd.

As you’ll read there, fires for smoking meats should be made with hardwoods only. This is equally important for smoking cheeses, as softwoods emit a resinous smoke that will give your cheese an off-flavor. Wrap your rounds or bricks of cheese in a few layers of cheesecloth and knot the cloth well. Then run a wire hook or good strong cord through the knot and hang the cheese as far from the fire as possible; it should be in the coolest spot in the smokehouse. Cheese hung in an area that gets above 90°F. might mtlt on you. Check the cheese regularly to make sure that it’s not melting and not getting too dried out. Ten to 15 hours in a cool smokehouse is about right."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Making Soft Cheeses Cottage Cheese Cottage cheese got its name from the fact that it is a cheese that can easily be made in the home -or in the cottage, as the term once was. Traditionally, this soft, perishable cheese was made from the skim milk left after butter-making. After the cream had been taken off the top, the remaining milk was poured into a good-sized crock and set in a warm place (usually on the back of the wood stove in the kitchen) for 2 days or so, until the milk had clabbered and much of the whey had separated from the curd. Then the curd was cut into cubes and heated gently over a low fire to firm it up a little. The warm curd and whey were poured into a cheesecloth sack and hung up over a tub until all the whey had drained off and only the soft curds were left. The cheese was then chilled for a few hours and mixed with a little salt and fresh cream and stored in the springhouse, cellar, or ice chest where it could be kept as long as 5 days without spoiling. Cottage cheese made at home today is made in much the same way as it was one hundred or so years ago. Most of it is made with fresh, raw skim milk, but fresh pasteurized or raw whole milk will do, too. Raw milk contains the beneficial bacteria that are responsible for making milk clabber. Pasteurized milk has been heated to tempera- tures that kill this bacteria, and it will not clabber by itself, no matter how long it sits in a warm place. If you’re using pasteurized milk, you’ll need to add something to activate the curd and start the milk clabbering. You can add a milk product that contains the necessary beneficial bacteria, like cultured buttermilk or plain, unsweetened yogurt, or you can use rennet tablets. .W"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"In addition to the milk and activator, you’ll need an earthenware crock, glass casserole dish, or stainless steel or enamel pot. Also have on hand a dairy thermometer, a long spoon (preferably made from glass, wood, stainless steel, or enamel), a spatula or wide knife, a large pan or shallow pot that is larger than your crock, cheesecloth, and a colander. All your equipment should be scrupulously clean. Wash it with soap and water and rinse well with very hot water before bringing it in contact with the milk. As we said before, cottage cheese is simple to Clnbberirlg the Milk Pour a gallon of frt>sh raw or pnstcurizt4, ski make: mmed, or whole milk into a crock or pot. If thtb milk is cold, bring it to room tempera- ture over very low heat. If you are using pasteurized milk or if you want to speed up the clabbering process of raw milk, add one of the following: 4 tablespoons unflavored fresh yogurt % cup fresh cultured buttermilk l/d tablet rennet, dissolved in l/2 cup warm water (use the kind of rennet you’d use for junket) Mix the milk and the activator together and cover the crock loosely with cheesecloth or a thin towel. Be careful nut to smother the milk by covering it with ;I heavy towel or plate. All you want to do is to cover the milk to keep dust and insects out of it. If air isn’t permit- ted to pass over the milk, the milk can acquire a musty odor and taste which will linger in the finished cheese. Let the covered crock sit in a warm (75” to 85°F.) place until clabbered. If you are using an a~- tivator, the milk should be clabbered in 12 to 18 hours. Raw, inacti- vated milk will need about 48 hours to clabber.

One gallon of milk should make about 11/2 pounds of cottage cheese. Ricotta Ricotta means “cooked once again” and is literally just that. The economical Italian country wife looked for a use for the whey left over from making her famous hard cheeses, and found that with high heat and acid she could precipitate the albumin (protein) in the whey and thereby obtain a delicious fresh cheese. Other cheese-producing countries have created similar types of whey cheese, such as the Swiss Hudelziger and Mascarponc, the latter from goat’s milk whey; and the French Gran de Montagne, made from whey and enriched with cream. Other exotic names ior ricotta-type cheese include Recuit, Broccio, Brocotte, Serac, Ceracee, and Mejette. Ricotta is most often sold fresh. It is rather sweet as opposed to the slightly tangy flavor of cottage cheese; it is crc,lmy and melts beautifully without separating in baked dishes like Italy’s famous lasagne. A less well-known product is dried ricotta, available only in specialized cheese shops, or your own home dairy. This is a piquant grating cheese and does not require the refrigeration niandatory fol fresh ricotta. So if you make too much to consume within a few days, you can always press and dry it.

You can speed up the process by gently squeezing the bag every so often and by changing the cheesecloth once or twice when it gets plugged up with the cream cheese. When the consistency of the cheese is tu your liking, take it out of the cheesecloth and place it in a clean bowl. Salt it if you wish.

Yogurt can be made out of any kind of milk, be it raw or pasteurized, cow’s or goat’s milk, which has been skimmed or left whole. Even dry powdered milk or soy milk (made from soybeans) can be used. The starter bacteria that you introduce into the milk may be commercially prepared yogurt, your own homemade yogurt, or a pure culture, such as Luctohcilhs m’idophilus, from a natural food store. If you buy yogurt, there are several things you’ll have to con- sider. First of all, buy fresh yogurt. That means you should buy a carton with an expiration date as far in the future as possible, a week and a half or two weeks distant, or more. Also, be sure that you are buying real yogurt. Some yogurtlike substances come in similar car- tons and masquerade as yogurt, but don’t be looted-read the ingre- dients and see what you’re buying. It is best to buy plain yogurt or a kind that has the preserves on the bottom of the carton. You will be able to skim enough yogurt off the top of the carton to use as a starter. The kinds of yogurt that have the preserves and flavoring blended through the product can also be used, but even in a small amount the fla’voring can permeate the final product to a surprising degree. About l/2 of a half-pint-sized carton of yogurt is enough to start 1 quart of homemade yogurt. Since there are several ways to encourage fermentation, you might like to experiment with a few methods first and then choose the way that works best for you.

If the yogurt is still rather watery, allow it to incubate for another hour, then check again. The longer the mixture incubates, the stronger and sourer the final result will be. To use powdered milk in the above directions, simply mix up a quart of powdered milk, adding extra if you like the end product thicker. Stir in yogurt culture, strain into containers, and incubate. There is no neeh to sterilize powdered milk. You can also use soy milk in the above recipe if you are a lacto- vegetarian or simply allergic to other types of milk. Substitute a quart of soy milk per quart of whole milk, stir in the yogurt culture, and incubate.

Don’t serve until thoroughly cooled. Mlzking Yogwt ill the Omw One way to get around using a yogurt-maker is to incubate the milk and yogurt mixture in an earthenware bowl (because it retains heat well) which is kept warm in an oven. Pour the lukewarm mix- ture into your bowl, cover, and set the bowl in the oven; heat slowly to 120°F. Turn off oven and let it cool gradually to 90°F. Try to main- tain temperature between 90” and 105°F. by reheating oven if needed (after about 2 to 3 hours) until milk becomes the right consistency. Check frequently during the last 30 minutes. Chill immediately after milk thickens. A Covtwd Casscrolc md n Wmn Plrm Prepare the milk and starter mixture. Then warm a casserole dish by running hot water over it or heating it for a few seconds in a very low oven. Pour the mixture in the warm dish and cover. Wrap the casserole dish in a large towel and set in a quiet, warm spot in the kitchen, as on a warm radiator or the warming shelf of a cookstove. Leave undisturbed for at least 6 hours, or let it set overnight. At the end of this time, check the consistency of the yogurt by unwrapping the towel carefully and tilting gently. If it is solid enough for your liking, refrigerate immediately. Serve only when thoroughly chilled. These last methods of yogurt-making are simple, but not as fool- proof as when using a yogurt-maker, since it is difficult to maintain a constant temperature in the milk mixture. The warmer the spot where the mixture sets, the quicker it will thicken and be ready, providing the area is not over 115°F. If you’re not successful using one of these last two methods the first time, try it again until you find just the right spot in your kitchen and until you know how long to let it set. Yocpurt in II TIwrtr-los An extremely simple way of making yogurt is to use a thermos bottle. A thermos is an excellent heat retainer. Once the starter has been stirred into the lukewarm milk, pour it into a wide-mouthed thermos, put on the lid and let it set 4 to 6 hours before refrigerating. This is practically foolproof, since the temperature is controlled for you. Yogurt-making is a simple procedure. Once you become familiar with the method you have chosen you’ll be able to make perfect yogurt every time."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Properly made yogurt should be rich and custardlike and have a creamy, slightly tart taste. Homemade yogurt will usually be sweeter than any unflavored store-bought variety. If, after refrigeration, there is a little water (whey) on top of the yogurt, don’t worry, you haven’t done anything wrong. This is natural, especially after it has set in the refrigerator for a few days. Open a commercial yogurt and you’ll find water on top, too. Either mix it in or pour it off, but save it for using instead of water in other recipes, since the whey is high in vitamin B,, and minerals. What Cm Go Wroq If you have trouble making yogurt the first time, check for the ing problems: follow 1. 3 Perhaps the milk mixture was disturbed while incubating. Even a few tilts or knocks can cause the whey to separate from the curd (as it does in cottage cheese). Instead of being a thick and smooth yogurt, it may be watery and lumpy and resemble cottage cheese. L. Perhaps your mixture was too hot or too cool. If the mixture is too cool, the growth of bacteria will be retarded. If it’s too hot, the bacteria may be killed. Add more starter, in- cubate longer, and adjust temperature to correct. 3. Perhaps the milk or yogurt starter was not too fresh. The older either is, the longer it will take to incubate and the more starter you should use. For best results, neither should be more than 5 days old. 4. Perhaps you used a pure yogurt culture which takes longer to thicken than prepared yogurt. Storage Yogurt will keep well for about 8 days under refrigeration if it is kept in an airtight container. It can also be frozen for several months, although it may separate and lose its smooth consistency upon thaw- ing. Thawed yogurt is best used in cooking, rather than eating fresh. Make sure that you save some to start your next batch. The new starter should be used before it is 5 days old Yoyurt CrEl7m Cl1ecsc This simple-to-make yogurt product can be used just like regular cream cheese, on crackers for hors d’oeuvres, for sandwiches, and in cookies, pies, and other pastries."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"314 Di7iny Products To make yogurt cream cheese, make your yogurt by following one set of instructions discussed in this section.

The shell is porous enough to permit oxygen and other gases to flow in and out through its walls, but its outer coating or membrane pre- vents bacteria and molds from entering which would otherwise contaminate the egg. Alone, the shell will protect the eggs for a short time, providing it is kept cool. Brush, don’t wash, dirt off eggs before you store them. People who vigorously wash off the dirt are also washing off the egg’s protective membrane. If possible, store your eggs in a covered con- tainer to keep out objectionable odors that travel with gases through the shell’s pores. An egg carton and the egg section in your re- frigerator are both fine places to keep them. Eggs will keep at refrigerator temperatures for a week or two, but after that time their freshness fades. Both the white and the yolk begin to lose their firmness and become watery and runny. The yolk of an old egg will usually break into the white when the shell is cracked open,- making separating the yolk from the white of old eggs a difficult, if not impossible, task. Old- Faslziorzcd Methods Before farmers had access to freezers, they devised some simple (but not always successful) means of preserving their excess eggs. Some farmers relied solely on the use of salt to keep their eggs from rotting. After gathering their eggs, they packed them in a large barrel or crock with plenty of salt and stored them in a cellar or springhouse to keep them cool. .? 1.5"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"376 Drziy Puohck The majority, however, found some way to clog up the pores of the egg shells so that moisture would not escape and air could not enter. Eggs were rubbed with grease, zinc, or boric ointment, or submerged in a solution of lime, salt, cream of tartar, and water. Probably the most popular way to seal egg shells was to waterglass them. By this method a chemical, sodium silicate, was mixed with water and poured in a crock which was filled with eggs that were about 12 hours old. The sodium silicate (which is used today to seal concrete floors and as an adhesive in the paper industry) would clog the pores in the shells and make them airtight. Some people, even today, use waterglassing as a means of pre- serving eggs, but this storage method has its drawbacks. Eggs preserved this way are not good for boiling because their shells be- come very soft in the waterglass solution. The whites will not become stiff and form peaks, no matter how long they are beaten. No SOL.&&, eggnogs, or meringues can be made with waterglassed eggs. There is also a very good possibility that by consuming eggs stored in waterglass you would be consuming some of the undesirable chemi- cal, sodium silicate. If you keep roosters with your hens, waterglass- ing may not be a successful means of preservation for you. The life factor in fertilized eggs makes these eggs deteriorate more quickly than sterile, unfertilized eggs, and waterglassing may not be enough of a preventive against spoilage. Frerzitq Freezing is the only way to keep eggs safely at home for more than 2 weeks. Eggs, both fertile and unfertile, will keep as long as 6 months in the freezer, if you prepare and pack them properly. The rule for selecting the right food for freezing applies for eggs just as it does for fruits and vegetables: choose only the very freshest. Eggs even a day or two old should be stored in the refrigerator and used within a relatively short time, as recipes call for them. Freeze only just-gathered eggs. Eggs in their shell expand under freezing temperatures and split open. For this reason, they must be shelled and stored in appropriate containers. If you are storing eggs in rigid containers, leave a little headspace for expansion. You can separate the white from the yolk and freeze each separately, or you can store the eggs whole. If you are freezing egg whites alone, they can be frozen as is, in airtight containers. For convenience, pack as many eggs together as you will need for your favorite recipes. You can then thaw and use a whole container of egg whites at one time."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Storiq Eggs 317 If you are packing yolks separately or are packing whole eggs, you will need to stabilize the yolks so that they won’t become hard and pasty after thawing. To do this, add 1 teaspoon of salt or I teaspoon of honey to each cup of yolks. Twelve yolks make up 1 cup. Break up the yolks and stir in the salt or honey. Of course, it is necessary to mark on the container whether salt or honey was used as the stabilizer so that you won’t ruin recipes by adding more salt or honey than you had intended. If you are packing your eggs whole, you will also need to stabilize them with salt or honey. Add I teaspoon of salt or honey to each cup of whole eggs. There are about 5 whole eggs in 1 cup. Scramble the eggs with the salt or honey before packing and freezing. Whole eggs can be packed together in one container, or they can be packed individually by using a plastic ice cube tray. To pack eggs separately, measure 3 tablespoons of whole scrambled eggs (which equals 1 whole egg) into each separate compartment of the ice cube tray. Place the filled tray in the freezer, and when the eggs have frozen, pop them out and store all the egg cubes in a plastic bag. By so doing you will be able to take from the bag and thaw just as many eggs as you need at one time. Eggs should be thawed completely before using. They thaw at refrigerator temperatures in about 9 hours and at room temperatures in about 4 hours. If frozen properly, thawed eggs have the taste, texture, and nutritional value of fresh eggs and can be used success- fully in all recipes calling for eggs.

Rural ice cream festivals and family members taking turns at the hand-cranked freezer are vignettes securely cn- shrined in the mythology of American life, and even today’s kids thrill at the thought of ice cream-making, almost as much as they enjoy eating the products of their labors. And finally, despite whatever other rationales one can muster for making ice cream at home, the best reason is because homemade ice cream is usually just plain better than any other kind-if you like ice cream, you’ll love homemade ice cream.

Perhaps the most familiar is the freezer method, using a mechanical ice cream freezer fitted with a metal can and revolving dasher. Modern freezers come in both electrically powered and hand-cranked models. Sears and other mail-order firms sell house brand freezers in a variety of sizes, using either method for power. (See page xiii for equipment sources.) Manually cranked freezers are a lot more appealing to most people than electrically powered models, especially if they intend making ice cream only occasionally. For one thing, the machines are cheaper initially and don’t require electricity-a big plus if you want to make ice cream at your favorite isolated picnic spot (somewhere where the salt runoff won’t kill any vegetation). Hand churning also produces a better ice cream, many aficionados believe, and some of the better methods for making commercial ice creams even call for hand finishing. In addition, manual freezers are available in many sizes -White Mountain, one of the most popular makers of manual freezers, even makes one that turns out 20 quarts of ice cream at a time. Electrically Cranked Ice Cream Others prefer electrically turned freezers. These come in several models.

A second kind of electric freezer is made to fit inside the freezing compartment of your refrigerator or in your freezer. These machines have heavy woven wire cords so that you can close the freezer door without damaging the cord. A motor turns the dashers while cold air from the freezer freezes the mix. Many models feature a shut-off switch so that the machine stops churning when the mixture reaches the proper consistency. One problem with these machines is that they have small capacities. Another drawback for many is that they consume electric- ity. However, if you plan on making ice cream frequently as a means of preserving extra milk, you might decide that using an electric machine will be worth the higher initial cash outlay and the higher operating costs. if you opt for one of these machines, look for a well-made machine with a heavy duty motor and a fairly large capacity . Freezer Ice Cream Another method of making ice cream at home calls for little equipment-and produces a product that is passable, if only barely. In this method, the mix is frozen in ice cube trays in the freezer compartment of a refrigerator or the home freezer. Better recipes for this type of ice cream usually call for whipping the product at some point.

Often the mix is frozen completely and, just before serving, is thawed slightly in the refrigerator and then whipped before being dished up. If you’re planning on using this method of freezing ice cream, it’s best to buy several ice cube trays just for the ice cream, since the dairy products and flavorings tend to impart a taste to the trays which may come out in the ice cubes if the trays are also used for making ice. Directions for making these ice creams are usually given in recipes for them, since the methods vary somewhat. Cranked Ice Cream How-To’s However, the method for making turned ice cream is standard. You should be able to use these directions for any ice cream recipe which calls for hand cranking, whether you’re using a manually cranked freezer or an electrically powered freezer with a bucket. (If you’ve purchased one of the freezers that fits inside your refrigerator freezer, follow the directions that came with your machine.) 1. 2. 3. 4. s - . Prepare the ice cream mix according to directions and cooi in the refrigerator for several hours. (If the mix you’re using does not call for cooking, you can mix it in the freezer can to save bowls, but be sure all ingredients are cold when you mix them. Also be sure that the can is clean, which leads us to Step 2.) Wash the can, cover, and dasher well and scald with boiling water. Drain and cool. (Since dairy products and eggs are both ideal mediums for bacterial growth and since many rec- ipes are entirely uncooked, it’s best not to take chances.) Pour the cooled mix into the can. Never fill the can more than two-thirds full. For example, ne\\ er put more than 4 quarts (1 gallon) of mix in a 6-quart can. Put the dasher in the can (be sure it’s seated properly), cover, and place in the freezer bucket. Place the cranking mechanism on top; make sure it fits tightly and is securely wedged in place. Pack the freezer bucket with ice and salt. The ice and salt both enable the ice to melt quicker, releasing more cold which chills the ice cream mixture. Use only c-mshi ice. If you don’t want to buy crushed ice, freeze ire cubes, place them in a burlap bag, and smash them with a hammer. Don’t hesitate to crush them as much as possible, since pieces of ice that are too large are a common cause of ice cream failures (as is too little salt).

By using fruits, nuts, and natural flavorings-and your imagination- and experimenting with small batches, you can produce an astounding number of ice cream flavors, Baskin and Robbins is the most famous of the commercial ice cream firms for the wide variety of flavors they have produced in their laboratories in Burbank, California, using mostly natural flavors. In 1971 when the company celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary, they had developed 401 flavors. Fruits and nuts should be added to the mix when it is just begin- ning to harden in the can- and is just beginning to get hard to turn. To flavor a gallon of ice cream, add 5 cups of fruit to the mix. Use crushed or purked fruits or cut the fruits into small pieces-ice crys- tals tend to form around large pieces of fruit. A small amount of lemon juice often enhances the flavor of fruits and keeps them from darkening, but don’t add too much. Swirled ice creams can be made by swirling a small amount of fruit into the finished ice cream, rather than mixing it into the ice cream mixture. If you are using fresh fruit, you may want to dribble honey over the fruit and let it set a few hours to bring out the juice. Or, juice or blend some of the fruit to provide a syrup and then mix it with the rest of the whole fruit. If using nuts in your ice cream, roast them lightly first. A small amount of salt added to the mix intensifies the nut flavor, and nuts are best when used with a stronger background flavor-such as maple or vanilla.

A butcher can do all this preliminary work for you, or, if you have the proper equipment and the know-how, you can do the whole job yourself. Doing Your Own Butchering If you’re going to butcher meat yourself, you have a lot of things to consider. First, do ycj~i have a place in which to butcher? It must be clean, cool, dry, and well ventilated, with a ready source of water and ‘1 stove for heating water. A garage, basement, or outbuilding can be converted for this purpose, providing there is enough head room to hoist the carcass. Many farmers do their slaughtering and dressing outdoors and then bring the carcass inside to cut. If they do work outdoors, they usually choose a dry, cool fall day on which to do the job. If you are working indoors and the temperature of the room you are using is higher than WF., a large cooler will be needed in which to chill the meat, ,IIIC~ in the case of beef and lamb, also to age it. The equipment to have 011 lwiid for butchering includt3 some- thing to hoist and suspend the carcass, like strong hc~ohs, a brace extending from an outbuilding or tree (if you’re working outdoors), or a heavy rod suspended from the ceiling. A block and tackle, windlass, or chain hoist would bc very helpful in hoisting the carcass, especially if you’re butchering steer. Rope, buckets, a thcrmomt~ ter to measure the tcmpc‘raturC~ of water, a meat thc~rmomtlter, rl stunning .3-i I"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"342 Meats nnd Fish instrument, cleaver, meat saw, hog scraper, hand hooks, whetstone, steel, and a good set of sharp knives are necessary. You may want to have access to a meat grinder, also. If you’re butchering hogs, you’ll need a scalding vat or watertight barrel. For slaughtering lambs, a low bench or box is necessary. Slaughtering and dressing animals is an exacting job, and space doesn’t allow us to explain the specifics of butchering in this book. For good, detailed information, we refer you to the booklets pub- lished by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the subject. These booklets, which contain lists of equipment, diagrams, and easv-to- foilow directions, can be obtained for a small charge from your state or county agricultural station or the Superintendent of Documents at the U.S. Government Printing Office in Washington, D.C. There are also some good books on butchering meat that you might want to consult. You’ll find a list of these books on page 417. Chillirlg Men t After the animal has been slaughtered and dressed, the carcass must be chilled promptly to rid it of its animal heat. If not chilled, the meat will spoil more rapidly because destructive bacteria thrive at normal body temperatures. Chilling also makes the meat easier to cut. To hasten chilling, cut off excess fat in the crotch and split the carcass. Hang the carcass to chill in a well-ventilated, cold area with a temperature between 32” and 40°F. A lamb or veal carcass kept in an area with a temperature between 32” and 40°F. should be chilled to 40°F. within 24 hours. A beef carcass may require 40 or more hours to chill to this temperature. A meat thermometer inserted into the thick- est part of the carcass will show you when the meat is properly chilled. Slaughtering on the farm is best done on a fall or early spring afternoon so that the carcass can begin to cool down during the night when temperatures just above freezir,g prevail. (If you will be curing and smoking your meat it is better to slaughter in the fall. Cold winter temperatures help to retard growth of bacteria responsible for spoilage.) If night temperatures should rise above 4O”F., cut the car- cass in half and then into a few big pieces and immerse them in clean barrels filled with water, ice, and about 3 pounds of common salt. This solution, which is colder than ice water but warmer than solid ice, will help chill meat, but will not bring it down to freezing temperatures. Never try to chill a carcass quickly by exposing it to freezing temperatures or by packing it in solid ice.

If a carcass should freeze, thaw it slowly at temperatures no greater than 40°F. Aging Beef and Lmb Beef and lamb are aged after chilling. This means holding the meat at a temperature of from 32” to 38°F. for a few days to a few weeks to increase tenderness, and in sonw meats, to bring cjut the flavor. Aging is best done in a refrigerated area where the tempera- ture does not vary a great deal. If a cooler is not available, aging may be done in a clean, cool, and well-ventilated place, free from animals and insects. The length of the time meat should be aged varies. Lamb can be held for 1 to 3 days, while older sheep (mutton) can be aged 5 to 7 days. Beef with little external fat should not be held for more than 5 days after slaughter. Beef with a good amount of external fat can be aged 5 to 18 days. Fat acts as a protection against bacteria in the air that would grow on the meat surface if it were left exposed. People who plan to store much of their lamb or beef in a freezer for more than 6 months should limit the aging period. Experiments at Pennsylvania State University have shown that the length of the aging period has a direct bearing on the storage life of meat because it permits oxygen absorption by the exposed fat.* As we have men- tioned previously, the more oxygen absorbed by the fat, the quicker the rate of rancidity. Aged meat shows higher peroxide values and shorter storage life than 48-hour chilled meat. In addition, the exper- iments at Penn State showed that aging does not influence the ten- derness of meat that is frozen more than a month. Experimenters found that although aged meat is slightly more tender during the first month of storage, this advantage disappears in subsequent months, when the aged and the 4%hour chilled meat are on a par for tender- ness. Pork and veal should never be aged, but frozen, cooked, or cured as soon as the animal heat is gone.

Ask yourself these questions before the cutting begins: Do I want more steaks or chops than roasts, or would I prefer it the other way around and get more roasts? Do I want some meat left around the bones for meaty soup bones, or would I prefer it removed and ground? Do I want some meat cut into stewing chunks or have it ground for hamburger meat? You do have these choices because there are several different ways certain parts of the carcass may be divided. The size of the roasts, the thickness and number of steaks and chops, and the amount of ground beef and stewing beef are deter- mined by the size and preferences of your family as well as your method of storage. For freezing, you’ll want your cuts as regularly square-shaped as possible for easy wrapping and packing. If you’re smoking, keep your hams whole and your bacon in large pieces. Canning requi.res smaller pieces of well-trimmed meat. If you’re canning your meat or freezer space is limited, you should consider boning as much meat as is practical. Boned cuts fit into jars and cans easily. They also wrap better for the freezer and can be packed tighter, with less chance of the wrap’s tearing when no large bones are protruding. Depending upon the cut, boned meat can be rolled and tied, ground for ham- burger meat or sausages, cut for boneless steaks and easy-to-carve roasts, or prepared as stewing meat or bacon.

Instead, they hire a butcher to do all or part of the work for them. Judy and Arnold Voehringer, of Kempton, Pennsylvania, raise their own beef cattle organically, and until recently, also raised hogs. They haven’t found it economical, on their small-scale opera- tion, to butcher their meat themselves. A local butcher comes for the animals and takes them back to his shop in a truck to slaughter, dress, and cut them. The Voehringers take the cut meat home to wrap and freeze. Although wrapping the meat from a 900-pound dressed steer is an all-day job for one person, the Voehringers feel it is enough of a savings, money-wise, to justify all the work; they save 7 cents per pound by wrapping and quick-freezing the meat themselves. Be- sides, there are usually enough friends and family members around on wrapping days to make the job easier. The Voehringers feel that it is very important to take their ani- mals to a butcher with whom they can feel confident.

They’ve learned that small operations will give them-- and their steer-plenty of attention. This personal attention was especially important to the Voehring- ers when their first few steers were slaughtered. The butcher took time to explain the different cuts of meat to them and give them tips for wrapping and freezing at home. Judy still helps the butcher when he is cutting the meat so that she can tell him how she wants the cuts: how thick to make the steaks, what size roasts she wants, how much fat to trim off, and so on. It is against the policy of most larger meat companies to permit customers in the cutting room. Rather, they cut the meat ,-:ccording to order sheets customers fill out when their ani- mals are brought in for slaughter. Typical order sheets might look like the ones here.

For practical purposes, most large meat operations collect the beef to be ground from all the steers butchered that day and put it together in a large meat grinder. What comes out is a mixture of meat from all the carcasses. The butcher makes note of the amount of ground meat belonging to each customer so that each gets his fair share, but certainly the ground meat that each customer gets is not all from his own steer. This doesn’t matter to most farmers because the beef from one steer is almost the same as thrlt from the next, but it does make a difference to the farmer who raises his steers organically. The Voehringers prefer working with small meat operations because their butchers grind the meat from each steer separately. Most small meat companies that do private butchering invite their customers into the cutting room so that the customers can watch the butcher and tell him just how they want their meat cut. Making Headcheese, Liver Sausage, and Scrapple and Rendering Lard Early settlers could not afford to waste any part of their butchered hogs; t-he slaughtered animals were too v;llunblc to them. They ate some of the pork fresh; cured the hams, shoulders, and bacons; and made sausage out of the lean meat scraps. The feet were pickled, the tails were used for stew, the fat was cut off and rendered for lard, and the heads, skins, organs, and bones were boiled to make dishes like headcheese, liver sausage, and scrapple."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Preparing Beef, Veal, lamb, and Pork for Storage 3% Headcheese Prepare the hogs’ heads for boiling by removing any hairs or bristles that remain. Cut out the eyes and quarter the heads. Let the cut-up heads soak in a pot of fresh water at least 7 hours to remove the remaining blood. Then rinse the head thoroughly in running water. Put the heads in a large, heavy pot and add any other scraps you wish, like bones, hearts, and skins. Before putting the skins in the pot, put them in a sack made of a double thickness of cheesecloth so that they can be easily removed when they are tender. Skins are tender when they are easily pierced with your fingers. Cover the head and scraps with water and simmer until meat slips from the bones. Remove the skins and grind them using a %-inch-hole plate. Prick the meat from the bones and grind it with a %-inch-hole plate. Mix the ground meat and ground skin together with enough broth to make the mixture the consistency of a soft cake batter (the remaining broth may be saved to make liver ,sausage or scrapple). Return the mixture to the pot and add your spices. To each hog’s head add the following: 1 tablespoon ground mixed V4 teaspoon red pepper spices (this may include (optional) garlic, savory, and onion 2 tablespoons black pepper powder, or sweet marjoram 1 crushed bay leaf and ground cloves) 2 tablespoons salt Bring the mixture to a boil and then remove from heat. Now you’re ready to form the loaves. Minnesota homesteader Joan Allard shares I with us here her tips for making a loaf easily: Line a container with damp cheesecloth large enough to be tied over the top after it is filled. The bottom layer should be made up of the fattest pieces and skin, with the leaner pieces in the center of the loaf. When the bowl is full, strain boiling broth to the top, gather the edges of the cloth to the center and tie securely. Set this container in a larger one. Place a saucer or lid on the meat and weight it down heavily with cans of food, filled jars, or a cleanly wrapped brick. The excess juices will be pressed out into the larger bowl and can be used in soups or as stock. After unwrapping the pressed meat, rewrap it in aluminum foil or another nonporous material and keep it refrigerated. Headcheese seems to get firmer with time-but it does not keep well beyond a few weeks. One way you can preserve it longer than"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"354 Meats and Fish usual is to soak it in a salt brine for 48 hours after in the cheesecloth to do this, and weight it down all times. it is formed. Keep it I under the liquid at To best preserve headcheese (or any other sausage or loaf meat), can it at 15 pounds pressure for 90 minutes. Ladle the meat mixture into the jars no more than 1 inch from the top before adjusting seals and pressure canning. (See page 387 for complete canning instruc- tions.) Store it in a cool, dark place as you would for any other canned food. When you are ready to use the canned meat, bring it to a boil and simmer it for at least 20 minutes. Then proceed to serve it, or fcrm a neat slicing chilled loaf as directed ‘lbove. Pressed meat dishes similar to headcheese are made using other cuts and types of meat than a hog’s head. All are similar in that they are loaves of chopped and cooked meat jellied with their broth and chilled before slicing. The following recipes were also given to LIS by Joan Allard.

Rendering Lard A 225pound hog will yield ‘Ibout 30 pounds of fat that can be rendered into fine shortening for pastries, biscuits, and frying. The sheet of fat lying just inside the ribs makes the best quality snowy white lard. This “leaf” fat renders most easily, too-and is 90 percent f‘>t. Tl-me “back” fat, a thick layer just under the skin, is almost ds good, giving about 80 percent of its weight in lard. Far inferior is the visceral fat, which is otten dark clnd off-tl,tvor. Since thesca various"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"358 Monk c~rlr-l Fish types of fats render at different rates, melt them separately. You can blend them just before storing if you wish. A slow fire and a heavy pot that conducts heat evenly are most important in making lard. Put % inch of water in the pot to keep the fat from scorching at first. Remove any fibers and blnody spots from the fat and cut it into very small pieces. Put a shallow layer of fat in the pot. Add absolutely no salt or other spices. When the first layer of fat has started to melt, add more. Do not fill the kettle to the top-it can boil over too easily. Stir frequently and keep the fire low. The temperature of the lard will be 2 12°F. at first, but as the water evaporates the temperature will rise. 2SS”F. is the point at which the lard is ready for putting up. Be forewarned that this will take a long time at low heat. As the lard renders, the cracklings (brown bits of crispy fried fat that do not render) will float to the surface. When the lard is almost done and the cracklings have lost the rest of their mois- ture, they will sink to the bottom. At this point, turn off the heat and allow the lard to settle and cool slightly. Then carefully dip the liquid off the top into clean con- tainers. Strain the cracklings and residual liquid through cheesecloth or a fine metal sieve. Fill the containers to the top-the lard will contract quite a bit while cooling. Chill as quicklv as possible for a fine-grained shortening. Air, light, and moisture can make lard rancid and sour. So after it has been thoroughly cooled, cover the containers tightly and store them in a dark, cool area. If the water was completely removed in rendering and the lard was chilled thoroughly before capping there will be no souring. The residual of cracklings are a favorite country treat. Drain them, add salt, and eat the crispy bits as they are. Or make a sprc‘ld by chopping them finely with onion, salt, pepper, and other season- ings and simmering them in V2 cup of white wine or broth until they are thick and t~ubbly.

Sausage Making sausage is much like making meat loaf; both are a thor- oughly mixed combination of meat and seasonings. But sausage also has curing agents and is aged before cooking to bring out its full flavor. Even “fresh” sausage has salt and spices as curing agents and a few dhys’ refrigeration to heighten its taste. You should know that the word “cure” not only refers to variety of spices added to the meat for flavor and preservation, but also to the passage of time that gives those ingredients a chance to do their work. So remember, to make any sausage you need a cure-the type of cure you choose will deter- mine the variety of sausage you will make. Attention to three other basics will insure high quality in your homemade sausage: The Meat Itself For sausage, choose meat scraps with no skin, gris- tle, blood clots, or pieces of bone remaining. Using two parts of lean meat to each part fat is imperative in getting tender, juicy sausage. Too much fat makes a heavy, greasy sausage that shrinks a great rleal during cooking. But do not yield to the temptation of decreasing thtl amount of fat, thinking you will get a leaner sausage that way; you may be disappointed with the dry, tough, surprisingly stringy tcx- ture of the finished product. fiappily, the most inexpensive cuts of meat, like pork shoulder or beef chuck, have this ideal leanifat ratio. Grinding the Meat The coarser the grind, the more slowly the flavors of the cure will develop and permeate the meat. So usually highly spiced sausages, like kielbasa, are coarsely ground to keep the"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Preparirq Beef, Veal, Lad?, and Pork for Storage 359 flavor from becoming overpowering. Mild sausages, like bockwurst, are usually finely ground to be compatible with the delicate flavor of light spicing. Most manual and electric grinders come with blades that chop the meat into l/s- to 3/4-inch pieces. For a finer grind than l/s inch: grind once, add % cup water per pound of meat and free par- tially, regrinding nnd repeating the process until you get the texture you desire. For a c..re coarser than % inch, cut up partially frozen meat with a sharp kl i:e. Curing the Meat Meat is cured for preservation and flavor. The oldest, simplest, and safest cure to use is salt, but even it must be used cautiously. Too little will cause spoilage, too much will dry out and harden the meat. Most recipes call for 1 to 2 teaspoons per pound of meat, and you should be careful in varying this amount. The primary role of peppers, herbs, and spices is to add flavor, but they also improve the keeping qualities of sausage once the cure has been completed. Use them carefully too, since a few days’ curing will intensify their flavor. It’s a good rule to underseason the mixture, then saute and taste a bit before adding more. If you are making a large quantity of sausage, it is a good idea to add seasonings sparingly. More spices can always be added if the meat is too mild, but none can be removed if the meat is too hot. Add your spices, mix them in well, and test the sausage meat by shaping some into a patty and cooking it. Taste the sausage and correct the seasonings. If the sausages are to be smoked, use a little less season- ing, as smoking will slightly dry out the meat and bring out the tlavor of the spices. If you plan to freeze your fresh sausage meat, it is a good idea to add the seasoning after the meat has thawed, rather than before you store it in the freezer. Spices shorten the freezer life of meats. Fresh sausage meats keep safely at freezer temperatures for 1 to 2 months. You will find that the ideal temperature for curing many sausages is that of your refrigerator: 3~” to 4S”F. Warmer, the meat might spoil, and if cooler, the salt penetration would be slowed. Meat can also be cured at room temperature or by cool or hot smoking (see the section on curing and smoking meats on page 393). Usiq Smrsup Crisiqp For professional-lookiI7g results and the real fun of sausage- making, you will want to try using natural casings. Alternatives tcj them arc cheesecloth and the new plastic cooking wraps. There is a different technique for using each."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Plastic Plastic cooking wraps are easy to find and store, and they can be used to make ail sizes of sausages. Some people may object to using them, though, because of the chance that with exposure to heat some of the compounds in the plastic mav permeate the meat. If you do wish to use them, be sure to get the type of plastic wrap meant for cookittly and not the type used for wrapping and storing food. These “oven” wraps are easy to use: tear off a length about eight times the diameter of the sausage you are making. Spoon a strip of the sausage mixture along one end and roll it up tightly. Tie off the ends, twist the roll into links of any desired length, and tie with strong string. Sausages wrapped like this can be baked at 325°F. for about 1 hour or simmered in water for about 2S minutes. Cooking time will vary with the size of the sausage. Don’t forget to prick several small holes in the film of each link to let steam escape while cooking. And of course, remove the plastic film before serving. VoiLi!-homemade skinless sausage! Cheesecloth Cheesecloth or a similar, loosely woven material is a more traditional and ecologically desirable wrapper. It’s often used as a substitute for the big 2- and 3-inch natural casings which are costly and hard to find. You will need a length of cloth about twice the diameter of the sausage to be wrapped. There is a trick to tying large sausages so that they hold together well while cooking: use an extra long piece of string to tie off each end and spiral it down the sides to the opposite end and tie it off again. You’ve probably seen salami or summer sausage wrapped this way. Cheesecloth wrapped sausages can’t be fried or roasted, but should be covered with water and sim- mered for about 31) minutes. Remove the cloth before serving. Animal Casings Natural sheep or hog casings are best for i/2- to I-inch sausages. A pound (or cup) of casings will make 30 yards or more of sausage. You can order them in most supermarkets and they are commonly sold around the holidays when many people use them to make traditional recipes. What you us~inlly get is a tangle of long casings packed in salt. Cut off the lengths you need and soak them in water at least 2 or 3 hours to make them pliable. You can repack whatever you don’t LISC in the salt where they keep well for a year 01 more. The apparatus you use to get the meat into the casing may be as simple as a iw-ml or as complex as an electric meat grinder with a sausage-stuffing attachment.

No specific area is needed to slaughter and clean birds, unless you have a lot of chickens, turkeys, geese, or ducks to process. You can slaughter your birds as you need them or do many at a time for freezing or canning. With just a little improvisation, you can do the entire job outside, in a basement, garage, or outbuilding. Naturally, when dressing poultry your prime concern should be to end up with a bird that is attractive and free from contamination. This means working carefully and quickly, with equipment that is clean and in good working condition. Your pro- cessing area, whatever it may be, sho.dld be a place that is clean and free from flies, with a ready source of water and a stove for boiling water. It should also provide enough clean space where birds may be placed between processing steps. Equipment should be clean and ready to use before you choose your birds for slaughter. Like larger animals, birds also require a device to hoist and suspend thcnl for dressing. T~CI’C &trt’ instruments designed just for this purpose. A hilling cone is like Cl funnel with the pointed end removed. The bird is placed inside this device, with its neck through the narrow opening. Killing cones con-w in various sizes, and it is important that you have one that fits the bird snugly. Shackles are a metal device that suspends birds by their feet. They may be used in place of the killing cone. If neither of thesca art’ nvail- able, you can suspend poultry bv their feet with rope. Tic a short piece of rope to a convenient ceiling beam or support, ceiling hook, or if you’re working outside, to a tree limb. Attach a Z-inch square"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":",366 Mrnts ni~n Fisli block of wood on the free end of this piece of rope so that you can make an adjustable loop to hold the bird’s foot. Suspend the bird by inserting each foot in one of these loops. For slaughtering and dressing you will riced a number of differ- ent tools, including at least one boning knife, small rounded knives without cutting edges for scraping pinfeathers, shears for cleaning giblets, and a lung scraper to remove the lungs. Knives and shears should be kept sharp during the operation with a whetstone and steel. You will also need a few containers. A watertight container that is big enough to hold birds for scalding is necessary. A clean, gal- vanized IO- or 20-gallon garbage pail is ideal for the job. A container will be needed to hold fenthers’and inedible viscera until they can be disposed of. A paper-lined cardboard box or plastic-lined bucket, at least 2 feet square, will work well. You will also need a container to hold the giblets, as they should be kept separate from the rest of the bird during processing. Any clean pot, pail, or bucket will be suffi- cient. A clean pail or bucket big enough to hold dressed birds, ice, and water will be needed for chilling. A work table, big enough to .?llq$/ you to work freely, is also necessary. Pick one that is of a convenient height for you so that you can work comfortably, without having to stoop over unnecessarily. It should be sturdy, with a clean work surface. Have on hand a durable thermometer that will register temperatures between 120” and 212°F. to measure the temperature of the water for scalding. For information on the actual slaughtering and dressing of poul- try, we refer you to the books and pamphlets listed on page 417. Preparing Birds for Slaqhter Twenty-four to 34 hours before slaughter, pen those birds to be slaughtered and fast them. The cage should be clean, so that the birds’ feathers will not get soiled. It should have a wire bottom so that birds cannot touch the ground to pick up feathers and litter. Fasting reduces the chance of contamination of the carcass because it cleans the digestive tract of feed and ingested matter. Birds should be given water during this fasting period however, so that they will not dehydrate. The skin of dehydrated birds is unattractive when the feathers are removed; it appears dark, dry, and scaly.

Frepzing is unquestionably the easiest and safest way to keep meat for long- time storage. Most all meats freeze silccessfully, with the exceptions of pro- cessed and spiced meats, canned hams, and cured and smoked prod- ucts. Luncheon meats, like salami, bologna, and spiced ham should not be frozen, but stored in the refrigerator and used within a week. Cured meats become rancid more quickly than meats that are frozen when fresh because the ingredients used in curing increase meat’s ability to absorb oxygen. These products should not be kept frozen for more than 1 to 2 months (see time chart). The period homemade fresh sausage may be safely stored in the freezer can be lengthened if the spices are added after the meat is thawed. Seasonings and fillings for meat loaves, meatballs, and the like should be added after, not before, freezing and thawing ground meat for extended storage life. Seasonings linii t freezer life. If you are freezing, wrap your meat as soon as possible after it has been cut. Wrapping carefully is extremely important in preserv- ing the flavor, texture, and freshness of all frozen food. Wrapping, weighing, and labeling meat from a large animal, like a steer, will rquire the work of at least two people if it is to be done in less than an g-hour day.

The air in freezers is relatively dry. If the wrapper is porous or poorly sealed, dry air will get in and draw moisture from the meat, dehydrating the surface a:~d causing freezer burn. Al- though these burns are not harmful to meat, the dried area will have an unappetizing color and be tough and tasteless -when cooked. This is particularly detrimental to foods \\tfi th high moisture contents, like meats. Your freezer wrap should ‘i7c pli;,blt~ so that it will mold itself to irregularly shaped meats and eliminate as much air as possible. Oxy- gen from the air which is absorbed by the n!eat will hasten the rate of ranciditv. Th; wrap must also be strong. Wraps not made for freezer stor- age are often too weak to use. These weaker wraps are more likely to tear and ailow oxygen and dry air to enter when meat is put in, taken out, or shuffled around inside the freezer. Take special care with cuts of meat that have sharp corners or protruding bones. These may be protected from tearing by placing a plastic bag, stockinette, or old nylon stocking over the freezer wrap. Meats that are highly perishable, like pork and cured meats, should be wrapped in d double thickness of wrap if they are to be kept longer than 5 months. Beef, veal, and lamb need only be wrap- ped in a single thickness if they are to be used within 1 year’s time. If they are to be kept longer, it is advisable to cover them in wrap of double thickness. It is a good idea to pILice wax paper or plastic wrap between hamburgers, sausage patties, chops, and steaks so that indi- vidual frozen pieces mav be separated and cooked separately. Some people wrap their meats in plastic before they wrap them in freezer paper. This insures an airtight, waterproof seal. All bloody cuts, like the organ meats, should always be wrapped first in plastic and then in freezer paper. After wrapping, every cut should be weighed (a kitchen scale will do nicely), and the weight, type of cut, and date frozen should be marked on the wrapper. With proper labeling, you’ll be abic to go to your freezer a few weeks or months later and choose the size and cut you want at a glance. As with any frozen food, use it in the order in which it was frozen. Cuts labeled with the earliest freezing dates should be used first, whenever practical.

What to do in such emergencies is discussed on page 65. Thnzoincq md Cooking Frozen Mmf Meats need not be thawed before cooking. There is little or no difference between the quality of meat thawed before coohnng and meat cooked frozen. If you do cook meat tihen still frozen, you’ll have to be more patient, because frozen meat takes more time to cook than fresh or thawed. While thin steaks take about the same time to broil or panbroil, frozen or thawed, larger cuts like roasts take almost twice as long to cook. When you do thaw meat, it is best to t-haw it in its original freezer wrapper. In order to insure uniform defrosting throughout your piece of meat, defrost it at low temperatures-in the refrigerator if possible. You can also thaw meat in cold water, provided it is in a watertight wrapping. If you must thaw poultry at room temperature, take special precautions to keep the surface of the bird cool during thawing. Place the bird, still in its original wrapper, in a closed double bag until it is pliable. Don’t let frozen meats, especially poul- try or pork, thaw on surfaces or trays where other foods are kept. Thawed meats that have not reached temperatures above re- frigerator temperatures (35” to 40°F.) may be refrozen, although each time meat is refrozen, there is some deterioration of quality; the ice crystals tend to rupture the fibers, breaking down the textl!re and letting more juices escape.

Although more time, work, ar,d equipment is needed to can, canning has some advantages over freezing. There is no freezer to maintain year round at 0°F. and no damage done to the food if there should be a power failure or freezer breakdown. Because meat is much more vulnerable to destructive enzymes and toxic bacteria than are fruits and vegetables, great care must be taken during the preparation and process of canning meats. Before considering canning meat, please read the section on preparing meat for storage. Use only good quality meat. Fresh meat should be chilled to 40°F. after butchering. I.amb and beef should not be aged more than 48 hours. If meat cannot be processed right after the animal heat is gone, store it at temperatures of (Y’F. or-lower until canning time.

It also means king careful not to add anything to our stored !ds that is harmful to our bodies, like adding artificiai preserva- \\-t‘s or any other questionable chemical additives. For this last rea- .l!, we must begin this chapter on curing and smoking meats with a 1t1w words of caution. There are a number of things that we find objectionable in cured and smoked products. Basically, curing meat means salting it so much that it will resist the bacteria that wouid otherwise cause the meat to spoil. Anyone who has ever tasted bacon, dried beef, or country ham knows that a lot of salt has been absorbed by the prod- uct. And salt, especially in the great quantities that you’ll find in cured products, doesn’t do our bodies any good. Too much salt can be the cause of hyperacidity, high blood pressure, and excessive water retention. It may interfere with the absorption and utilization of food by overstimulating the digestive tract, and it can aggravate heart disease. Salt is the basic curing ingredient, but if used by itself it tends to make meat oversalty, dry, and tough. So along with salt, most cures contain sugar. Our objections to sugar, discussed elsewhere (see page 199), hold true for cured and smoked meats also. Beef and pork cures may contain saltpeter as a color fixative. We object to the consumption of saltpeter because it has been proven to be toxic to man. The nitrate in saltpeter combines easily with amincs in food, drugs, alcohol, and tobacco smoke to produce ni trosamines, and these compounds have been found to cause cancer.” * ~3~~dtrict~ I‘ri~m tjuntcar, “Nitrite Adciitivcs in Mtaat I’rodt~cts,” c’c)~st’\\tl I<\\ 1~1 SI ,IIH II r\\l.r\\c.vl~I 5X:5 (M,jy l%‘!i), pp. 14. 15.

Smoked meat tastes smoky because the meat has actually ab- sorbed smoke emitted from slow-burning hardwoods. The smoke is a coal-tar derivative, and coal-tar derivatives have long been known as cancer-causing substances. We recommend freezing, canning, or even drying meat before we advise curing and smoking it. But if your homestead doesn’t have the facilities for freezing or canning meat, you'll have to rely on curing, and maybe smoking it too, if you want to keep it for any length of time. The salt in the cure extracts water and c!lecks the growth of most spoilage organisms. The smoke colors and flavors the meat, dehydrates the cured meat further, and slows down the devel- opment of rancidity in the fat. blowever, meat that has been cured properly does not also need to be smoked to insure good preservation. There aren’t too many old-time butchers ,md smokers left; they’ve gone out with the introduction of commercially prepared cures and automatic smokehouses. Luckily, here in Pennsylvania Dutch country you can still find a few country butchers who are doing their own smoking-just as it’s been done fol jne hundred and more years. Thomas Meyers, of Fleetwood, Pennsylvania, is one of Before you decide if you are going to cure and smoke your own meat, ask yourself if’ you can build, buy, or borrow a smokehouse.

Some 60 years ago his father taught him the art of smok- ing, and he’s been smoking meats the same way ever since. His smoked bacon, ham, beef, and chicken have an aroma and taste distinctively different from the smoked foods sold by the bigger, modern operations that forced him to give up his business a few years ago. Now he has a small shop and smokehouse which serves customers of a popular country restaurant. Mr. Meyers is a friendly man and was glad to talk to us about his trade, but when we asked him just how he smokes his products he had a difficult time explaining the procedures to us. “I can’t tell you; I just do it,” was his reply. “You’d have to see for yourself.” He didn’t learn how to smoke from a book; he learned by working with his father zlld practicing on his own until he developed a real eye and feel for his work. And this is just what you’ll have to do if you want to produce a good smoked product. We can give you fine old, traditional recipes for cures, tell you how to build smokehouses, and provide you with a set of general instructions, but the thing that we can’t give you here in this book is the practice and know-how that can make the differ- ence between a fair-tasting ham or sile of bacon and a great-tasting one. This will have to come f,om you. If you’re serious about curing and smoking your own meats, find yourself a small country butcher-one who takes great pride in his own meats-and work with him at least once when he’s curing and smoking. building the Smokehouse The first thing that we’re going to discuss is the smokehouse because a smokehouse is the most important and most compiic&ted piece of equipment that you’ll need if you intend to preserve meat by both curing and smokinb. You can build a smokehouse out of just about anything -an old refrigerator, a packing crate, a barrei- providing it has four csscntial things: a source of smoke, an area in which to confine the smoke, racks to hold the meat, and a draft. The smoke is usually produced by bunling hardwood, a charcoal fire with hardwood chips or sawdust sprinkled over it, or even by burning corncobs. Never use softwoods; their pitch gives an off-odor and taste to the food. A draft is absolutely essential to the smoking operation; without it the smoke will stagnate in :he smokehouse, and the smoked meat will have an objectionable, sooty taste. in a barrel smokehouse, the draft can be created by a piywoocl cover with a hole cut in it.

Place the barrel, with the top removed and a hole cut in the bottom, over it. A fire pit si~ouid be dug 10 to 12 feet away from the barrel in the direction of the prevailing winds. The pit should be deep enough so that it can be covered. The intensity of the fire in the pit and the amount of draft can ‘be controlled by placing a piece of sheet metal over the pit. The pit should be connected to the bottom of the barrel with a trench made from a stovepipe or sewer tile. It is important that this trench be airtight so that little smoke will be lost.

Dig the fire pit at least 10 inches from the barrel and connect the two with a pipe or tile trench. A lid for the barrel should be made from plywood. Strips of wood or broom handles to support the hanging meat should be placed across the top of the barrel, as shown in the diagram below. The wooden cover is then placed over the wood strips. The openings made by the wood strips provide draft holes for escaping smoke. Couzwrtiq 1’1 kfrigcrn tar ill to a Smokd:om~ An old refrigerator can also be converted into a smokehouse. Because it is more durable than a barrel and is insulated, it will provide a more permanent smokehouse that retains heat well. In addition, its removable metal racks and full door make it very con- venient for hanging and removing meat. Although the heat can be placed directly underneath the re- frigerator, or even inside it, this arrangement is not advisable because the insulating material inside the refrigerator walls may catcll on fire if it is subjected to direct heat. Rather, it is best to dig a fire pit several feet from the refrigerator unit and direct the heat to it by using an underground trench, as we recommended for the barrel smokehouse. If the motor and compressor are contained in the bottom of the refrigerator, rtimove these. Place the unit on follr cinder blocks, cut a hole in the bottom, and attach a tight-fitting stovepipe or sewer tile leading to the fire pit from this hole to prevent smoke from escaping."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":",398 Mpats md Fish Provide a draft at the top of the unit by cutting a 3-inch hole in the top and attaching a Z-foot length of stovepipe with a butterfly damper.

It is also possible to modify an existing shed by adding a firebox at one end of the building. If a frame shed is used, it is advisable to construct a firebox outside the shed for safety.

Most farmers, if given the choice, do their butchering in the fall and curing and smoking in the early winter. Cool weather helps to keep meat chilled when it is most important. By the time warm weather rolls around again, the meat is well aged. Eqrliy JJJrJJt for cr1 riJJg For curing you’ll need a sturdy container for holding the meat. Glass or earthenware containers are excellent. Many farmers use large crocks. Never LISA aluminum containers. Wood containers aren’t ac- ccptablc unless you are using a dry cure. A hardwood barrtxl will be all right, so long as it is watertight. If the barrel is new or has not been filled with a liquid for a long time, fill it with water and allow the water to set in it for at least 24 hours before you pour it out and use it for brining. The water will cause the wooden boards to swell and make the barrel watertight. If you are brine curing, the containtl1 should be large enough to hold the meat and brine. Curing There are two types of cures: the dry cure and the brint> cure. Either (or sometimes both) cure is used to mildly preserve, tenderize, and flavor 1neat intended for smoking or drying. Brine curing, sonic’- times called pickling or (when used with some cuts of beef) coming, may also be u sed as a means of preserving meat all by itself, without additional smoking or drying. In such cases the meat is left com- pletely covered by the brine and kept in a cool, dark place until it is eaten. Brining like this is not the best means of keeping meat, and meat should not be stored this way for more than a few wt!eks, and perhaps less, depending upon the recipe and the weather. If you wish to make a brine cure, bc certain that your water is clean and has a pleasant taste. If it is heavily chlorinated, we suggest that you boil the chlorine out of it first. Don’t LISA bleach or any other chemicals to purify water; use bottled water instead. If you arc un- able to get good-tasting, clean water, you’d do better to use the dry cure. Dry curing is usually the more successful of the two methods fat the beginner and the person who does not have a refrigerated curing room. Since the dry cure is applied directly to the meat in its full strength, the rate of cure is more rapid than the brine cure. This is especially important in the southern parts of our country where the"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Clrrirr,y 17i11i Sulc)kirl,y R/I1~17!5 401 weather is warm most of the vear. With this cure thert~ is less chance of spoilage if the ttmperaturc should vary somewhat during the cur- ing period. Curing time is not as exacting as it is with the brine curt‘, and there is no need for a brine pump or watertight barrel or crock in which to soak the meat. Commercially prepared cures are available from some salt corn- panies and chemical manufacturers. Although these ready-made mixes are easy to use because they are premeasured and premixed, they generally contain antioxidants. Most companies offer a choice of cures, but you have much more control over taste and degree of saltiness when ~OLI mix your own bccausc you can regulate the amount of each ingredient. Many recipes for CLIIVS, i’vcn old-time recipt’s, use both sugar and sal’tpeter. Some use mc~lasses instead of sugar, and some require both sugar and molasses. We haven’t found anyone yet who uses honey, but the butchers that we have questioned see no reason why honey couldn’t be used instead of sugar and molasses. The only drawback may be its high price (unless you keep your own bees). Most people agree that one-half the amount of honey may be substi- tuted for sugar. That is, if a formula calls for 2 pounds of sugar, replace it with 1 pound of honey. One Poland of honey can be substi- tuted for 1 pound of molasses. Molasses and honey should only be used in the place of or in addition to sugar when the temperature during curing can be kept between 38” and 40°F;. Warmer tempera- tures may make your brine ropy. Before you decide what cure you are going to use, consider what each ingredient does. Salt preserves the meat; there’s no way to get around using it. Sugar is generally added to tenderize and flavor the finished product, but it plays no actual part in preserving the meat. Saltpeter is added primarily to preserve the color of pork and beef; it is not an essential ingredient, if VOLI don’t mind vour meats a little darker in color. In other words, yclu can get away with just using salt. As a matter of fact, many old-timers did. Make sure that all your meat is chilled to 38” to UF. before curing. Keep it at this temperature during curing. Don’t let it freeze bccausc the cure won’t work when the meat is frozen. If the meat does happen to freeze, extend the curing time for as manv days as the . . meat is frozen. For example, if the curing time is 28 days, and the mclnt freczcs for 2 days, cure the meat for a total of 30 days. Follow the suggested times carefully until you develop a feel fur curing.

It’s very important to use the right kind of salt. Never use iodized salt. Good salts art‘ marketed under such names as rock salt (the hind you use for freezing homemade ice cream and melting ice on sidewalks), dairy salt. or water softener salt. It might be necessary to crush or grind the crys- tals, since a medium-grind salt is best for curing meats. (Fish, how- ever, are best cured with a very fine salt, as noted in the section on fish.) A small hand-operated grain mill, like a Corona or a Quaker City mill, will do a good job elf grinding the crystals. The following directions fo: dry and brine curing are intcndtld for pork. If you are interested in curing (Corning) beef, see page 406. Dry curing involves rubbing the curt’ on the outside surfaces of the meat and allowing it time to penetrate. Remember, even though we give the original formulas for cures, it is possible to produce a good cured product without using either the saltpeter or sugar. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends the following dry cure formula for 100 pounds of ham or shoulder: 8 pounds pickling salt 2 pounds white or light brown sugar or syrup 2 ounces saltpeter (we think this is optional) , Use 1 ounce of this mix per pound of ham and “,.I to 1 OLI~KC per pound of bacon. Rub this mixture into the meat to be cured. Rub the required amount of cure into bacons all at once; rub shoulders twice, with one-half the amount each time; and rub hams with one-third the amount three times. Resalt hams and shoulders 6 to 8 days after the last salting. Be sure that the mixture covers the surface; avoid breaking outside membranes or meat will become hard and dry dur- ing aging.

Brim Cifriqy Brine curing means soaking the meat in a mixture of salt and water. A brine that also contains sugar is called a sweet pickle. There are several methods for testing the strength of the brine. The old way was to add salt to water until there was enough salt in the water tcl float an egg or potato. The modern method is to use a salimeter, which will measure the strength of the brine very accurately and allow you to make a brine as strong or as weak as you like. The degree of salinity in n brine or pickle ranges frcjm 60’ to 95“. The higher the degree, the greater the concentration of salt. The standard brine formula for each 100 pounds of meat is: 8 pounJ salt 2 ounces saltpeter loption,ll) 2 pouncls sugar 4 to b gallons wnttbr Once the brine is made, the chilled meat is packed into a vat OI watertight bnrrc’l.

After curing, the melIt may be smoked, if desired. In the brine cure it is extremely important that all parts of the meat be exposed to the brine. Special care should be taken if the brine container is packed tightly. Stir the contents every third day; or remove all the meat once a week, pour off the brine, and repack the meat, pouring thr sdmc brine, which has been stirred well, over it. The stirring counteracts the tendency for the brine to separate and become stronger at the bottimi as ttle hrlLivicr ingredients settle out. This process is called overhauling. There is a chanct’ that the brine III~I~ become sour (or ropy, as it is sometimes called). This results when the temperature of the room is too high. If the brine has an objectionable odor or adheres to your fingers in long strings when you dip your hand in it, change the brine immediately, wash the meat well, and add new brine. Throw out the old brine. Some meats, such as bacon, will cure faster than larger pieces, such as hams. Remove the smaller pieces from the brine when they have been cured for the required time , and hold them in a cold place until the rest of the meat is finished curing. A variation on brining is injecting some of the brine directly into the meat tissues with the aid of a brine pump.

The meat is still allowed to soak in brine, but the pump’is used to assure penetration to r711d around the bone. If the meat is to be pumped, it should be chilled and given about four guns, or cylinders, of the brine mixture. The brine is generally a little stronger, perhaps 5” to 10” stronger, when it is to be pumped. When pumping, drive the needle into the thickest part of the meat, slowly, but with steady pressure. Insert the needle close to the bone if there is a bone. Release the brine slowly as you plunge in and also as you draw the needle out so as to distribute the brine evenly around the path of the needle. Remove the needle when it is empty and hold your finger over the hole that the needle has made for a few seconds to prevent any brine from oozing out of the meat. Repeat this proce- dure in the thickest parts with the remaining cylinders. Curing time is shortt ned almost one-third for pumped meats because the brine has already penetrated the meat. co?nbim7tioil my l-lid B?irw Curt? I’. Thomas Ziegler, in 1’tiE MEAT‘ WE EAT (Interstate Printers and Publishers, Inc.), recommends gixping hams cured on the farm, where temperature during curing and curing time may vary, a combination dry cure and brine or sweet pickle. This method hastens salt penetra- tion, and the quicker the salt gets to the center of the ham, the less danger there is of loss from spoilage. Experiments hL1ve shuwn that where I l,‘z to 2 pounds of salt for each 100 pounds of pork are rubbed into) hams 24 to 48 hours before they are pl,lced in a 75’ brine, they will cure in c) days per inch thickness of meat.

Jerky Jerky is meat that is cut in narrow strips and allowed to dry and become somewhat leathery. Traditionally it is made from beef, vcni- son, or other game meat.

When the meat has been salted, arrange on racks in a warm (150” to -175°F.) o ven. Do not let the oven temperature rise above 175°F. Lower is actually better. Turn the meat at least once during the drying process, which should take about 4 to 6 hours. The salted strips may also be laid over dowels or green sticks that are supported by forked branches, or other setup over a coal fire made from hardwood. The coals should not be hot enough to cook the meat, just hot enough to provide a drying warmth. This method should dry the meat in about 24 hours. You’ll know that it’s done when it bends before breaking. Let it cool before testing, as it will seem more flexible than it really is while it’s still warm. It is better to have jerky a bit overdry than underdry, as too much moisture will encourage bacterial growth. Once cool and dry, wrap jerky in moisture-proof material and either freeze or refrigerate, or store it in a lidded container in a cool, dry place. Dried Beef Dried beef, also called chipped beef, is usually made from the rollnci.

Smoking Hmrgirzg the Mm t Cuts of meat that are to be smoked should have a strong cord strung through them so that they will be easy to hang. Hams and >houlders should be strung through the shanks. If you don’t have a regular stringing needle, make a hole in the shank with a boning knife and run a strong cord through the opening. In order to have your bacon hang straight and smooth without wrinkles (wrinkled bacon is unattractive and difficult to cut), it is best to insert a skewer thmllg!l the f!ank end of the bacon strip and insert two cords, ant’ on -*.. -- each side of the center of the bacon, just below the skewer. GIK~ the meat is strung, it should be scrubbed with water and a stiff brush to remove excess surface salt and grease. Rinse thtl meat and allow it to dry overnight before smoking. If not dry before smok- ing, the meat will come out of the smokehouse streaky. Hang the meat in the smokehouse so that no two pieces arc touching one another. if you’re hanging your meat in two levels, hang it so that the top pieces will not drip on the ones below and makr them streaky.

This is called a cool smoke and is used to smoke meat that is to be aged or held for many months. This smoking and gradual drying process helps to preserve the meat and give it a mellow smoked flavor. Hot Smoking There is another method of smoking meats-with a hot fire, one that brings the smokehouse up to a temperature of .130”F. or more. Hot smoking is often done to meats that have not been cured, and if this is the case, the meats should be eaten immediately or soon after they have been smoked because this method does not preserve them. This method cooks the meat and gives it a smoky flavor at the same time. Poultry and fish are often smoked at high temperatures this way. Meats that arc first cured and then hot smoked usually can be wrapped and hung. Dried beef (see page 410) is one such meat. For hot smoking, your fire has to be hot and you may want to build your fire right in the smokehouse itself. Check it often to make sure that the fire doesn’t get too hot and that the meat does not catch on fire. Hozo Loug to Smoke Mcnts Old-timers held their meat in the smokehouse for long p&=iods of time. This long smoking considerably reduced moisture in the meat and provided for extended periods of keeeing. We prefer our meats much moister now. A good average smoking time for hams is 2 around-the-clock days, or 5 to h hours each day on 6 consecutive days. Good-sized pieces of meat will generally need 48 to 72 hours of smoking. Small pieces of meat, like sausages and bacons, must be watched carefully to avoid oversmoking. Color is one guide to length of smoking time. Meat should be amber to chestnut brown in color. You’ll have to be the judge here because a lot depends on your tastes. and also on the length of time you intend to keep your meat. The agricultural extension service at the University of Minnesota makes a suggestion to thr,se people who arc’ using smoking as a means of preserving their meat. They suggest smoking meats lightly at first and leaving them to hang in the smokehouse. Pieces art’ p~~lled out, cooked, and eaten as thcv are nccdt’d.

Fish is the most perishable of all foods, and it must be frozen, canned, or dried, or eaten very soon after it is caught to prevent rapid deterioration. You can tell fresh fish by its bulging eyes and the reddish tint of its gills. The scales are shiny and are firmly attached to the skin, and the flesh is taut. One of the easiest ways to tell a fresh fish is by its odor-actually, it’s lack of a “fishy” smell, especially around the gill: and belly. The final test of a fresh fish is to place it in a tub or sink of clean water. If it’s very fresh it will float. Kill the fish (except shellfish) as soon as it is taken from the water. If the fish is allowed to tlop around until it suffocates, the flesh may become bruised, inviting quicker deterioration. Keep shellfish alive by putting it in clean salted water if you can (see page 422). If you can’t eat or process your fish right away, pack it in ice and keep it well packed until you can dress and store it properly. Fish not held at temperatures below 70°F. will spoil in 1 or 2 hours. Drain off water from melting ice often so that the fish doesn’t become “water- logged” and lose some of its flavor to the melting ice. Retter yet, clean the fish immediately after killing it and wash the body cavity clean with fresh potable water. ‘spoilage will not set in as quickly if the entrails and body wastes are removed. Then pack the body cavity with ice and cover the fish with more ice. If for some reason ice is not available, wrap the fish in damp moss, ferns, wet newspapers, or burlap and keep it out of the s~rn.

You need not scale, eviscerate, or trim a fish that you plan to fillet. Begin by laying the fish on a flat surface. With a sharp knife cut above the tail just to, but not through, the bone. Then place the tip of the knife in this incision and cut all along the back ridge. Lift up one edge of the fillet and cut along the backbone, loosen- ing the fillet. Continue cutting the entire side of the fish away from the body so that it can bc rcmovcd in one piece, then free it from the tail. Turn the fish over and remove the other fillet. To skin the fillet, place it skin side down on ;1 flat surface and grasp it at the tail end. Cut through the flesh about ?‘z inch above the tail.

In addition, it is necessary to first cook fish-filled jars to exhaust air and then process for a relatively long time. If you have a choice, we suggest that you freeze it instead. However, if you decide to can it, work carefully and quickly. Please read the previous sections on preparing fin fish and/or shellfish, and the discussion of canning meats for ncccssary equip- ment and general procedures before you attempt to can fish. As in any other means of storing fish, be sure the product is as fresh r~s possi- ble. Lobsters, crabs, crayfish, and clams sl~ould be alive and ,111 fin fish kept on ice until you prepare them for canning.

Drying Fin Fish As with all other methods of processing fish, drying should be done with great care. Read about selecting, keeping, and cleaning fish on page 418 before you attempt to dry any fish. Only lean fin fish (see the listing on page 423) are recommended for drying. The greater amount of oil in fatty fish makes drying them difficult. Shellfish are not suitable for drying, either.

I The directions here are for drying fish that you intend to store dry, but not smoked. Fish prepared for smoking are dried for a much shorter time first, since the smoking process further dries them. For directions for smoking fish, see page 433. Clean, scale, and dress fish according to earlier directions. If you’re drying large fish, fillet, but do not skin them. Medium and small fish should be split and spread open in one piece. To do this, insert your knife in the neck opening made by removing the head alld bring the knife down along the back, cutting the fish in half right along the backbone all the way to the tail. Do not cut along the belly, but lust spread the fish apart so that it lies flat in one piece. Then ~v,~sh the fish in a mild brine made from: I cup pickling salt to each gallon of ccl!d, Lit’aIl water. Check the fish carefuiiy to make sure that there are no traces of blood and no dirt, insects, or other foreign matter. Weigh the fish, and tien rub pickling salt into each piece of fish, using 1 pound of pickling salt for each 4 po~lnds of fish. Finely grained pickling salt is best for this because it quickly penetrates into the pores of the fish and readily forms a brine. Stack the fish skin side down in a long, flat ccJntCliner. A wooden box with holes in the bottom for drainage of thtl tush juices and the brine they form is ideal. Stagger the layers of fish, sprinkling salt generouslv between layers, using another pound for each 4 pounds of fish. Keep the fish indoors in a cool, dry place for 2 to 7 days. The thinner the fish, the fewer stacked layers, and the drier the weather, the shorter this first drying period. Wait for a good drying day and then remove the fish and scrub it well so that there are no traces of pickling salt remaining. If the weather is rainy, leave the fish in the salt until the weather improves. Choose a drying area thrlt is shaded and out of reach of ,Inimals and is as insect-free as possible. Stack the fish on clean wooden racks. Lav the pieces skin side down in a single layer. If you have only a few fish to dry they may be hung up under an overhang where there is good air circulation. Run an S-hook through the collarbone and attach a strong string to this, or thread the string right through ~hc bony neck. Hopefully, the weather on the days you plan to dry fish will be wrlrrn (but not hot), dry, and breezy. Turn the fish three or four times the first day. Bring the fish in at night before dush (and dew) cc)mcs nnci Iav out again the next day.

Smoking Fin Fish Before you attempt to smoke any fish, read about cleaning, dress- ing, and keeping fresh fish on page 418. Since fish are smoked much like meats, rend about smokehouses and smokehouse fires starting on page 3%. Prepare fillets or split open the fish and spread flat as you would for drying (see page 430), but be sure to leave the collarbone on split fish that are spread open in one piece so that you have a handy place through which to insert an S-hook or thread a heavy string for hanging in the smokehouse. For best results choose one variety of fish to smoke at a time and try to cut them to approximatel\\* the same size. Fish to be smoked must first be cured and then dried slightly before being placed in the smokehouse. The salt cure acts as a preser- vative, and the drving produces a protective sheen over the surfact> of the fish called a pellicle which will seal in the fish juices and prevent the protein in the tlesh from coagulating and forming harmless but unattractive white curds on the surface. Fish for smoking may be either just held in brine or brined for a shorter time and then dry salt cured.

Then rinse and drain them for a few minutes and dredge in fine pickling salt. Layer them in a wooden or crockery container, placing layers of salt between each layer of fish, staggering the fish one layer on top of another. Place the top layer skin side up. Leave the fish in this dry cure for-on the average-8 hours, but longer if the day is humid and the fish are thick, and less if the day is dry and the fish are thin. Drying Both brine and brine- and dry-cured fish must then be dried to form the pellicle we spoke of earlier. See the directions for drying fish in a shady, outdoor place on page 431. Dry only for 3 hours or until the pellicle forms. The smoking process will further dry the iis~-.~~ic:-~~?--ake_i_t__ready for storing.

Be sure that no two pieces are touching and that no fish is against a wall of the smokehouse for good smoke circulation and even drying and smoking. As mentioned in the section on smoking meats, the fire should be kept cool and at as constant a temperature as possible throughout the smoking period. It should not get hotter than 70°F. Fish should be smoked for at least one entire day-day and night-and longer if it is to be kept more than a couple of weeks. If you plan to keep for a year, you’ll have to smoke continuously for 1 week. Once the smoking has begun, it sl~o~~ld not be interrupted until it is completed. This will mean feeding the fire if necessary in the middle of the night. Storing When finished smoking, cool the fish completely and store it in jx~o~s packaging that allows the smoked fish to “breathe,” and keep in a dry, cool place. Smoked fish should not he canned or fro- zen. Fish smoked in this manner can be eaten without furthrlr cooking."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"ea Baked Stuffed Apples h large cooking apples 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup sausage meat honey (optional) Clean out the center of the apples by scooping out the cores and p7ulp (be careful not to cut through to the bottom of the apples).

Some growers, because they are impatient or want to make the harvesting easier, shake the trees to get the nuts to fall. Shake the tree if you wish, but shake gently. Harsh jolts may cause immature nuts to fall, and rough handling can damage the branches. Whatever method you use to get the nuts to the ground, be sure to gather them as soon as possible. Nuts left on the ground mold quickly, especiali! in damp weather This is particularly true with the Persian walnut (also known as English or Chinese walnut) and chestnut. It you don’t gather and hull the nuts of the black walnut promptly, the bitter tluid secreted in their hulls penetrates to the kernels and this discolors them and impairs their flavor. The nuts of the Persian walnut, if infested with husk maggots, will not open on the tree. Rather, the nuts will fall to the ground with the hulls still on them. In such casch, Persian walnuts should be picked from the ground soon after they fall and hulled like the black walnuts (see below) before the dark, bitter fluid of the hulls penetrates the nut meats. Black walnuts should be hulled before thtl hull turn5 black to secure ‘1 light-colored, high qunli ty nut. ‘T‘ht~ importance of hulling was proven to Spencer B.

These nuts produced “darker kt-mels and suffered considerably in flavor and overall quality.” Most comnlercial walnut operations dip their nuts in a bleaching solution to get the light co101 which can be obtained naturally just by hulling the nuts as soon as they are mature.

It is this staining agent which also penetrates the hulls and-stains the delicate kernels and otherwise impairs their quality and flavor.

Not all nut varieties, however, will give yo~~ <IS n1~1ch trouble <IS the black walnuts. The> hulls of pecans, hickory nuts, Persian walnuts (if not infested with husk maggot), filberts, and chestnuts obligingly open on the tree and ict the nuts fall to the ground, so harvesting is merely a matter of picking the nuts off the ground. Once gathered (and hulled and washed, if need be), nuts should be placed in water, and the rotten and diseased nuts which float to the top should be discarded. The nuts must then be dried or cured. Green, uncured nuts are bitter and unpalatable. To dry the nuts, spread them out rattler thinly on a dry, clean surface and allow them to dry gradually by expt~sure to a gentle, but steady, movcmcnt of air. A clr~an, &I, darkened, well-ventilated attic or porch is ideal. Nuts dried this way will not be attacked by fungus or mildew. When done properly, such drying will make for light-flavored, light-colored nut kernels. The nuts may also be spread thinly on wire trays or window screens. Nuts should not be more than twa nuts deep 011 such trays and screens. Deep wire baskets are \\~sed by some nut growers, but growers are careful to pour the nuts every 4 days from one basket into another to prevent mildew from forming. Drying time varies with nut variety. All nuts tlxcept chestnuts contain a great amount of oil. This oil prevents nuts frc.,m drying out completely dnd from becoming hard and bri tttc. Chestnuts contain little oil, but they do contain much water and c;Irbohydr,ltt~s. 13ecausta of their high water and carbohydrate contents, chtbstnuts dry out easily and become hard and inedible.

Avoid excessive drying which will cause the nut shells to crack. After drying, nuts still in their shells may be stored in attics for up to a year, but cool underground cellars are preferable for longer storage. Storage containers for nuts may be made from large plastic bags with ventilation holes punched in them to allow air to circulate and excess moisture to escape. Then put these bags in tin cans lined with paper. Keep them tightly closed, but punch a small hole in the can below the lid. Store the nuts at 34” to 40°F. and check regularly for mold and mildew. Some nut growers store their nuts in peat moss and other moisture-absorbing materials. By so doing, there is no need to allow for ventilation because the peat moss takes care of excess moisture that would cause mildew. Prepare peat moss for nut storage by mois- tening it with just enough water to prevent its being dusty. The peat moss should be damp, but not wet. Add about one-third as much peat moss as nuts by volume when packing nuts in lidded cans or plastic bags. Nuts may also be pdcked in clean, dry sand and then stored in a coo1 area. Stored this way, nuts will retain their germinating powers (should you wish to plant them to start new trees), but may lose some of their flavor. ~ Crnckiq the Nuts You can crack a nut with almost anything that does the job. You can use a hammer with a block of wood or metal. Or you can swing a heavy iron like your grandmother used to iron shirts. Every nut fan has his or her own method. Take wild foods gourmet Euell Gibbons, for example. Here are his instructions for shelling black walnuts, especially hard nuts to crack: If you stand the nut-pointed end up-on a solid surface and hit it with a sharp blow with a hammer, it will crack into two halves. Stand each half, again pointed end up, and strike it again, which will break it into quarters. Strike each quarter again on the pointed end, and it will break into eighths-at which point the nut meats fall out. When the nuts are well dried, 1 have been able to completely empty shell after shell without resorting to a nutpick with this method. And his secret for shelling hickory nuts:"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"458 Ni{ts, Sctds, dilli Grdim Put the unshelled nuts in the deep-frcezc for a day, then remove a few handfuls at a time and shell them while they art still frozen and brittle. The nuts are narrower one way than the other, so hold them LIP edgewise and strike tlach a sharp blow with the hammer, just hard enough to crack the shell but not smash the kernel. Cracked this way, many entire halves can be removed while the others usually have to come out in quarters. Hard-shelled nuts are more easily shelled if the shells are soft- ened first, This may be done by pouring boiling water over the nuts and allowing them to stand for 15 to 21) minutes before shelling. Another method of softening the nuts is to place them in a container, sprinkle them with water, and cover them first with a damp cloth and then the container cover. Let them stand this way for 12 to 2-I hours. The shells will be easier to crack, and the nut meats will not splinter when the shells are cracked. Soft-shelled nuts, like chestnuts, can have their shells peeled off with a knife. To do so, first cut across the base of the nut to allow steam to escape so that the nut won’t explode, and then place the nut in boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. The shell will then pull off easily. Hmzwstiq nmi Cwincg Penntr ts To get the most out of your peanut crop, allow plants to remain undisturbed until heavy frost completely destroys the tops. This would be around the last of October or in November in most peanut-growing areas. Most of the pods are formed as early as the middle of Septembe;, but they are empty. The kernels will need another month or 6 weeks to develop fully. Early frost may darken the leaves of the plants, but the stems will continue to provide food for the nuts to develop. When harvesttime arrives, lift each bush carefully out of the soil with a garden fork, and shake free of all dirt. YOLI might w‘lnt to run your finger through the dirt left in the hole to rt’scut’ any peanuts that have broken off. Pluck the pods from the roots immediately, and drop in shallow trays for drying.

Then you would run the grain through a mechanical fan scled cleaner to remove the wild plants and seeds that were harvested with the grain.

If the day you pick is windless, use an electric fan to generate a winnowing wind; it works like a charm. Repeat this process until the grain is clean, or nearly so. A few grains may not hull out completely, but this will not affect the flour. Storing the Grain If you harvested your grain when it was almost ripe and allowed it to dry in the field for at least a week or so, the moisture content of your grain is probably somewhere between 12 and 15 percent. If this is the case, your grain is dry enough to store as is, although it should be cured for at least 1 month before you try to mill it for flour. Green grain heats up and gums up a flour mill, and the tlour is difficult to work with. Grain makes much better bread if it is allowed to cure longer than a month. If the weather should be damp when you harvest the grain, and it rains while the grain is curing in the field, there is a good chance that its moisture content is somewhere above IS percent. If you store high-moisture grain you are inviting all kinds of trouble. Mold, fungi, beetles, and mites thrive in moist grain. \\Yct grain should be dried before it is stored. I‘hc drier tht> gr,lin, the less susceptible it is to damage by bacteria, fungi and inst>c~ts.

I 111on t h L~t’hrtn Dry grain keeps best when stored in a cool, dry place. It may be stored in bags on slats, so long as precautions are taken against rat infestation. Rats are capable of doing scvcrc damage to stored foods. Not only can they consume many pounds of food in I year, they can also contaminate foods by carrving into the storage artla insects and bacteria. You’ll know you have a rat problem when you set drop- pings, tracks, and grease marks. In dusty locations you may notice tracks left by the trail cjf a tail ,lnd the four-totId front paws and the five-toed rear paws. Storing bags of grains in a ct4lar or outbuilding that has double walls and space bctwccn floors and ceilings invites rat problems because such structures provide ideal homes for these rodents. Choose a storage area that is rat-tight and provides no hid- den areas in which rats.can nest. Many commercial warehouses take care of rat problems by using rodenticides. These poisons are not only toxic to rats, but to domestic animals and humans as well. For the homesteader, rat infestation can be prevented by making sun* the storage arca is clean and rodent- proof. Having a couple of good-working felines around to patrol the area is also a good idea.

Rcfrigevntccl Stoqy At Walnut Acres, organic grower Paul Keene keeps all his grains under refrigeration. This not only assures him of fresh grains, but also makes insect and rodent damage nonexistent. Once, when hu spotted some grain moths flying about in the refrigerator as grain was coming in from the weeding out process, he became worried. But the moths settled on the refrigerator wall, only to faI1 dead on the floor. The 40°F. temperature did it. Refrigeration of grains is a good idea, cqxx-idly if you want to hold grain over the sunl;~lcr, when the cool wcathcr is gone. Insects that attack grains multiply at temperatures greater than 70°F. Insect infestations of this type are controlled at the commercial level with fumigants like methyl bromide and methyl parathion, both deadly poisons that are pumped into airtight sealed bins. Experiments are being done with carbon dioxide fumigation, which, while deadly to insects and rodents, will leave no toxic residues. But, like all fumi- gants, it requires sealed storage bins, and these are not very practica! for the grower with small grain acreage because they are usually too ‘; ,:a 3:2, r~:!!,p,$sfi~{ You can keep unmilled grain in glass jam for up to one year.

The same insects that multiply at 70°F. lie dormant at 35T. and will eventually be killed by extended periods of low temperatures. Refrigeration also aids in controlling fungus attack: fungus grows very slowly at temperatures of 45°F. and below. Organic growers may be happy to learn that Paul Hawkin, pres- ident of Erewhc.)n Trading Company, which is one of the country’s largest distributors of organic grains, claims that organic grains have a higher resistance to heat and humidity than chemically Grown grains: For example, if you fill a pint jar half full with organically grown and produced rice, fill it with water and cap it tightly and then do the same thing with the chemically grown rice, you’ll discover a strange thing. After a period of several months the rice that was not grown organically will have dissolved and turned into a white powder, whereas the organically grown rice has not. Now, I have no scientific explanation for this, but it is pretty graphic. I spent a year in Japan studying natural foods and farm- ing methods, and one of the most stunning demonstrations I saw was this rice experiment done by the Mcssian people in Shikoku. They periormc4 ~o~~I.w~ of siinifar experiments, using other grains as well. Grinding for flour is best done just before baking, for grinding will expose the germ which will turn rancid in the presence of oxygen and warm temperatures. Rancidity destroys vitamins E, A, and K in the human body and has been found to destrov several of the B vitamins. Ground flour should be stored in the refrigerator or freeze1 if kept for any extended length of time. t-lowc>vtlr, do not use cold flour when you’re baking with Yeast. Leave the cold tlour at room temperature for a few hours before you use it for baking so that the yeast will not be chilled and become inactivated.

On that day, the baker of the household would rise before dawn and build a roaring fire in the brick oven. By midmorning, when the oven’s inner walls were thoroughly heated, the glowing embers would be shoveled out. Then the bread, which had been mixed, kneaded, left to rise, shaped into loaves, and left to rise again, would be placed in the oven. The heavy iron oven door would be closed and sealed tightly with clay so that no heat could escape, and the bread would be left to bake for tfle rest of the morning and afternoon. The farmhouse soon would be filled with the sweet yeasty smell of baking bread, and by early evening there would be enough loaves cooling in the kitchen to last a family of ten or twelve for a week, until the next bread-baking day came around again. It made good sense then-and still does today-to bake a number of loaves at one time. Although we’re spared the chore of building a fire in the brick oven, we stiff must mix and knead the dough, let it rise twice, and bake it. It takes just about as long to prepare and bake a double or triple bread batter as it does a single one. Once you have the kneading board out, the bread pans fined up, and your hands covered with flour, you might as well go ahead and bake enough bread to fast your family at least a week. What do you do with the eight or twelve loaves after they’re baked? Farmwives used to put them in a wooden box especially made for keeping bread, cover them with a clean towel, and store them in a cool place. The bread tasted just great for the first few days, but as the week wore on the bread started to get a little stale-no preservatives to keep bread “tasting” fresh forever, then. Fwezing Baked Bred Today we’re more fortunate. We have a way of keeping bread fresh for months, not by adding sodium or calcium propionatc OI another bread freshener to our breads, but by using the freezer. Baked yeast breads retain their just-baked quality at freezer temperatures for (1 months and more if they are stored properly. Pre- pare and bake your loaves according to the recipe. Allow them to cool in a draft-free place (drafts tend to shrink baked goods) thoroughly before wrapping for the freezer.

This moisture can lead to the growth of mold even under the most sanitary of conditions. Wrap the breads intended for the freezer after they are cool in aluminum foil or heavy-duty plastic bags. Then freeze them. Frozen breads should be thawed while still in their wrappers. If you like to thaw your breads in a low oven, your freezer wrap should be aluminum foil. Otherwise, let your bread thaw at room tempera- tur:. It should take at least an hour to thaw normal-sized loaves. Allow extra thawing time for large, heavy loaves. If you’re toasting your bread, thcrr’s no reason to thaw it first. Slice it (you’ll need a good sharp knife to get through a loaf of bread which is frozen solid) and place it still frozen in the toaster. Tfle slices will thaw and toast at the same time and taste just as good as fresh toasted bread, Sflzrf with Moisf Brerzds Bread should be eaten soon after it has thawed, for thawed bread dries out quickly. To keep your bread from becoming stale too rapidly after thawing , begin with a recipe that makes a moist bread. One that calls for honey will make a moister loaf than one that uses sugar, corn syrup, cane syrup, maple sugar, or molasses as a sweetener. The more honey you use, the moister vour bread will be and the longer it will keep. Honev is hygroscopic. It absorbs moisture from the air and holds this moisture in bread. Rccipcs that calf for a good amount of oil or butter will also make a moist bread that will keep for a longer time because shortening doesn’t dry out. Don’t freeze French and Italian breads unless you know that you’re going to finish off the entire loaf soon after it is thawed, or unless you have a use for stale, dried-out bread. French and Italian breads do not con- tain oil or butter, so they dry out very quickly. Foods with a high oil content, like nuts, sunflower and sesame seeds, and soybeans, can be ground in a grinder or blender and used to replace some of the flour in your bread. In addition to making your bread moister, these foods will make your bread more nutritious because tfiey are good sources of protein and the B vi tamins. You can replace about one-eighth of the flour in any dark bread recipe with ground nuts, seeds, or soybeans without making an appreciable change in the taste or texture of the finished product. In placc~ of the ground nuts or seeds, you can add a few tablespoons of a nut or seed butter (like peanut butter or tnhini) to your bread ingredients. Another way to make your bread moister is to replace sorntl of tht> flour in the recipe with cooked cereal, like oatmeal or farina."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"GYflillS 47s Softefli~?~ Dsied-Out Bscrzd If your thawed bread starts to dry out and get stale, do what the farm wives used to do with their O-day-old bread: rejuvenate it by sprinkling a little water on it and putting it in the oven for a few minutes. You can also lay a flat strainer above a pot of boiling water or cooking vegetables or soup or anything you’ve got on the stove, and place slices of bread in the strainer. Put the lid over the bread. The steam rising from the pot below will moisten and warm your dry pieces of bread. Frtwiyq Lhbrrkd Bwad Dou~~$r If you’re the kind of person who goes crazy over the tastes and smells of bread right from the oven and would rather take the time to bake every day just so that you can enjoy just-baked bread all the time, don’t despair; there is a shortcut for you, too. Just freeze your bread bcfnrt? it’s baked, and then when you’re ready for a loaf, let it thaw and rise, and bake it as you would freshly risen dough. Your kitchen can smell like it’s bread-baking day every day even though you only get your hands and the kneading board floury once a week. Unbaked yeast dough can only be stored in the freezer for 2 to 3 weeks. Mix and knead it the way you usually do, then allow it to rise once. When it’s risen to double its bulk, punch it down, shape it into loaves, and freeze It. Your loaves should be thinner than usual. They should be no more than 2 inches deep so that they will thaw quickly when taken from the freezer. When you’re ready for a fresh loaf, thaw the dough in a low oven (250°F.) for 45 minutes, then reset the oven for the normal baking temperature and bake as usual. Once cooked, this bread will also dry out quickly, so eat it soon after baking. Rcfujyvtiu~~ Udwktvi Bstwd Doqh Floss and Stan Dworkin, in their book BAKE YOUR OWN BREAD (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, lc)72), recommend storing unbaked bread dough in the refrigerator instead of the freezer.

In the refrigerator you can get the dough to rise an extra time because the yeast is still working at refrigerator tcmperaturcs, cvcn thtjugh ii does worh slower when it is chilled.

Kidney and marrow beans take almost an hour to cook. The others take about 30 minutes. There are so many ways you can use or cook sprouted beans.
