Canning is a way to keep food fresh for a long time in jars by heating them to high temperatures for a long time. This kills microorganisms and stops enzymes that cause food to go wrong. As the food cools, the air is pushed out of the jar by heating, making a vacuum seal."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"HOW DOES CANNING WORK? When you heat up filled and sealed jars, the food inside expands and gives of f steam, which pushes air out of the jars. When it cools, it makes a seal on the jar that keeps air out. The amount of sugar and acidity can af fect canning and the food's shelf life. When you're just starting, it's best to follow a canning recipe to figure out which method is best for the food you'll be canning. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2 HOME CANNING METHODS 1. Water bath canning. This method is a way to can food at a lower temperature. It works well for acidic foods and recipes that use the right amount of acid. It is suitable for fruits, jams, jellies, salsa, tomatoes, pickles, chutneys, sauces, pie fillings, and condiments. 2. Pressure canning. Low-acid foods need to be kept safe by using this high-temperature method. It's suitable for meats, poultry , vegetables, chili, and seafood. The USDA says you shouldn't can with a pressure cooker because there are too many dif ferent kinds with dif ferent results."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"WHAT DO YOU NEED TO CAN AT HOME? 1.

But foods that aren't acidic, like soup stocks, vegetables that haven't been pickled, and meat, must be canned in a pressure canner . 3. Put the food in the jars while they're still hot. Pack hot food into jars one at a time, leaving enough space at the top to seal them. Once it's complete, put it back in the water that's just about to boil. 4. Listen for popping sounds. Once the jar is sealed correctly , you should hear a \"pop,\" and the lid shouldn't pop up. 5. Overfilling jars. A good recipe will tell you to leave some room between the top of the food and the edge of the jar . The lids won't seal properly if you put too much in the jars.

Put clean jars in a canner with a water bath or in another deep, large pot. Cover with hot water from the tap, and let it cook for 10 minutes over medium heat. Keep them in simmering hot water until you are ready to use them. Pour hot water from the sterilizing pot over the lids in a bowl. When ready , take one clean jar out of the water and set it on a clean kitchen towel. 2. Use a ladle and funnel to put food in the jar . Leave a headspace of 14 inches at the top. 3. Poke the food with a clean chopstick or wooden skewer to release any trapped air bubbles. 4. Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean, damp cloth, and screw on the lids. 5. Use a jar lifter to gently put each jar in the canner after you've filled and sealed it. 6. Make sure the jars don't touch each other . As you add jars to the pot, you may need to drain some water . 7. Put all the jars inside and cover them with an inch of water . 8. Put the lid on the canner and bring the water to a full boil. 9. Boil jars for 10 minutes (length of processing time may vary from recipe to recipe). T ake the jars out and set them on a towel-covered counter to cool down to room temperature. The jars should ping as soon as they are taken out of the pot. The sound comes from the seals being made. As the vacuum seal takes hold, the center of the lids will go down, creating an airtight seal. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"10. When the jars have cooled down, test the seals by pressing the middle of the lids. The pot isn't sealed if the top pops up and down.
