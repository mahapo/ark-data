D. Rockefeller Jr. and others anxiously ask.It will, if this book is read and its message spread.It surely will not, if this book is trampled upon!Count Okuma, the farsighted and clever statesman ofJapan,, affirmed this war will lead to the death of Aryan civiliza-tion. Though he knows how it will be destroyed, he, as a Mongol,did not reveal it.Therefore, I shall do it.Why did a score of the best British (among them the famousPresident of the British Empire's Press, Mr Robert Donald)French, Slav and other editors call me \"Prophetic Genius\" or\"Prophet\" with \"astounding,\" \"marvelous,\" \"preter-natural,\"\"miraculous\" foresight and intuition?*Because they found in my 7 pre-war books 80-odd politicalpredictions all of which were later realized, as if prophecies.Why have I been so successful in all my predictions?Only because I most humbly agreed with the warnings ofOUR SAVIOUR(St. John VIII, 44, St. Matthew XXIII, 15 etc.).Never did I think that I \"know better,\" or that I ought to, be\"less prejudiced\" or not so \"full of racial hatred,\" as He.That is why everything concerning World affairs and thefuture of America and of the Aryan Race is clear to me, whileall the statesmen writers, preachers and politiciansare puzzled.Here are some samples of this. Mussolini in perplexity said\"Yet, thewhyof war,whichhasfollowedhumansocietysinceitsorigin, never has been explained, and apparently must be put into the domainof unexplained matters.\"(NewYorkAmerican, April 3, 1925).If Mussolini were a Christian, he would not thus blunder. ..Because CHRIST said clearly that there is a \"Satan'slust ofmurder and that the Jews-his sons-will do it.\" And History,as we shall see, daily confirms this OUR SAVIOUR'S warningwhichmeans:\"Gentiles, keep far away from the Jews!\"The Talmudis todaypreached in every synagogue!Itteaches\"Thou (Jew) shalt smite the other nations, which the Lorddelivers in your (Jewish) hands\". ..\"kill the best goym\" (gentiles.)*In the New York Times of April 17, 1907, was published my predictionabout the two Balkan and this wars.1a"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"A WAR IS BUT A \"LEGALIZED MASS-MURDER.\"A war is only a \"legalized mass murder.\"Thus CHRISTpointed out those, who arrange all wars and revolutions, and thattheir chief cause is Satan's and his sons'\"lust of murder.\"But \"Christians\" never seem to agree with CHRIST.The same with ex-Premier of France Joseph Caillaux.Whenasked how to save France, he wrongly answered\"The public seems to believe that there exists some half secret remediesas yet unemployed to cure the impecuniosity of States. Work and economy.That is the regimen.Such are the only remedies.\"If France follows Caillaux's advice and works and economizeswithout following CHRIST'S indication, then in five or ten yearsshe will become rich again.Then Rothschild V-th or VI-th willorder his Lloyd Georges, Clemenceaus, Woodrow Wilsons,*Beth-mann-Hollweg-Rothschilds,Aerenthals,Sazonovs, SonninosKemal-Pashas, Venizelos, Masaryks, et al, to start a new world war.And all that the French nation would have earned according toCaillaux's advice, would be spent in silly mutual self-extermina-tion of the Aryan race, or in payment of indemnity to Germany.Edouard Rothschild V-th in Paris and the 300 Judeo-Mongols,who are composing the World Government (the Hidden Hand),made 100 billions out of this First World War.Of course, notmounting their \"lust of murder,\" they are willing to stage a SecondWorld War.They are preparing it against rich America.Controlling the World press, they can easily stage any war.\"If Wall Street should say the word tomorrow,all the editors and preach-erswould be for the war\" (Eugene V. Debs, The Sun, May 4, 1925).One needs not to be a prophet to foresee such imminent an issueif the French follow the Caillaux way of salvation.Thus the Dictator of Italy and the presumed Dictator of Franceshow the same serious lack of judgement.But the necessity of growing statesmen is most vital.What is a difference between a statesman and a politician?Demosthenes and Edmund Burke explained it:\"A statesman must know how to foresee the future.,A polit-ician grasps only the present\" (which is already the past).\"To govern-means to foresee,\" says a wise old proverb.Otherwise-\"without foreseeing one cannot govern.\"As soon as one agrees with CHRIST, one becomes more bright.*As ex-Senator R.

It is not my in-tention to claim any merit of discovery, for the facts themselvesprove day by day how amazingly right CHRIST is.To follow HIS commands is hard and irksome.**The leastthat we could do would be to recognize HIS Wisdom and HIS de-sire to guide us safely even here-on: earth. But, as I said, our rul-ing classes refuse, perhaps unconsciously, to believe HIS warnings.\"When a nation forgets God, God sends an earthquake,\" saidthe French genius, Victor Hugo.We are witnessing a politicalearthquake in Russia, in fact on one-sixth of the surface of ourglobe.By the news from that country we get daily informationthat \"numerous people convicted of counter-revolutionary activitywere shot to death today.\" The reason why so many persons arebeing killed is not because of their counter-revolutionary activity,but is nothing more or less than the deliberate murder of the in-telligent Aryan classes in order to substitute the Asiatics.*The murder may be moral, mental and physical.\"*The Jews deceived many of us, that CHRIST has never said, thatthe authors of the Talmud (now followed by a whole race) are the \"sonsof the devil.\"CHRISTcould not fail to warn thus, because otherwise,the above truth is so obviously proved by the true history, that we wouldhave the right to reproachOUR SAVIOURfor not having thus warnedus.The Jews lied that the Gospel of St. John was written later on, andeven might be apocryphal.

T. R. Marshall:\"The World Government will not per-mit the establishment of peace,\"asking them,\"What is the WorldGovernment\" and \"why will it not permit the establishmentofpeace,\"they became confused andcould find no answer!How astoundingly right was Professor Charles E. Merriamofthe University of Chicago, when he exclaimed in a lecture\"What advantages will we reap if science conquers all the world, exceptthe World Government.\"-(TheChicago Tribune, Jan. 24, 1924).*History proves, and the Jewish Encyclopaedia confirms it, that the so-called \"German, Russian, Polish and Eastern Jews\" are Mongols, who acceptedthe Jewish Talmud, which is not the creed given to Moses. The Talmud seemsmore like the by-laws of a gang of murderers than a religion, yet it is strictlyfollowed by the so-called \"Jews.\"Among others things the Talmud teaches: \"The best Gentiles must bedestroyed,\" and similar commands. However, many politicians have the ef-frontery to declare that this \"religion\" ought also to be \"respected,\" whileit ought to be exposed in the Courts, as inciting to murder.4"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MY SCIENCE SAVED FIVE MILLION ARYANSI said that the Christian Civilization could still survive, if thisbook be read and its message widely spread. Why? Because itillustrates my \"Science of Political Foresight,\" which has provedits value insuch numerous cases and verifying all of my eightyand more predictions in my seven pre-war books.*Here is one of the proofs of the usefulness of my science: Aftera long discussion with General McDonough, the Chief of the WarIntelligence Department in London, and with the British ForeignOffice, I submitted on September 17, 1918, a report advising thesigning of peace with Bulgaria, which, as I foretold in the abovereport, would provoke an uprising of the Slavs in Austria and apanic in Germany and the immediate surrender of her armies. Myadvice was accepted and two weeks later peace with Bulgaria wassigned; two weeks still later the Slavs in Austria rose, and Austriawas prostrated: and two weeks after the Austrian defection, Ger-many was thrown into a panic and surrender forced upon her.The First World War was thus ended, thanks to my advice!The self-extermination of the Aryans was stopped. Otherwise,fighting would have continued for many months more and at leastsome five million more Aryans would have lost their lives in vain,of whom not less than two millions would have been Americans.Asiatic Bolshevism would have jumped from Russia into Ger-many, then all over Europe, and eventually to America. Furtherthe thousand million Mongols of China, Japan and other Asiaticsand Africans would have found the moment propitious to have re-peated the historic invasions of Attila (defeated near Paris in 471),and of Baty, who lost his army in 1240 at Fiume.These two possibilities were not taken into consideration bythose who thought that the Allies should have fought longer,-thatGermany should have been crushed and peace signed in Berlin.I did not advise the Allies not to go to Berlin!The above has remained an\"unrevealed\" fact in history!The only publication in Great Britain confirming it was theChristian Commonwealth which published it in February, 1919.The only newspaper in America was the New York Staats Zeitung,which, although furiously attacking me (April 29, 1921), provedthat it was my advice to England to sign peace with Bulgaria thatbrought about the prompt surrender of Germany.*See my \"Vers La Debacle (Towards the Debacle). Dangers et Reme-des,\" published in October, 1913,.in which I warned Russia about what sincehas happened and offered \"the Remedies,\" which could have saved her.5"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ALL HISTORIES AND THE PRESS ARE \"BUNK\"The Staats Zeitung blamed me for Germany's disaster, for-getting that if Germany had not surrendered, Europe by nowwould have been drowned in an ocean of blood, spilt by the Bol-sheviks, or perhaps even by the Mongol invaders.Why was this fact of my saving some five million Aryans socarefully silenced by the press? Because, if by one report I wereable to save five million Aryans one would reasonably expect that Ieould save many more.But that is precisely what the WorldGovernment does not want. Its aim is bloodshed.Why? As the 300 Judeo-Mongols6 who compose it, are convert-ed Mongols, they are \"twofold more the children of hell\" than theregular ancient Jews (St. Matthew XXIII, 15).The \"mystery\" of this silencing by the press of such vital factsis explained by the Hon.

Because the press is controlled by the\"sons of the devil\"!Men of genius, such as Voltaire, Napoleon, Lamartine, HenryFord, have warned us that history is \"untrue,\" still it seems that,with the exception perhaps of Washington Irving and the Presi-dent Emeritus of Leland University, Dr. Starr Jordan, nobody hasdemanded that \"History be rewritten and revised,\" thus to expose\"the organizers of all wars.\" On the contrary, when Mr. HenryFord placed incontrovertible facts, bearing on the causes of theworld's unrest, before the public, newspapers generally trampledupon his words and endeavored to discredit him.For fifty years history has been my beloved \"hobby.\"When, thanks tomyadvice, the Armistice was signed, I went tothe Library of the British Museum and practically lived there forthirty months, reading, studying and copying much of the sub-stance of this \"Unrevealed in History.\" It took me forty monthsmore to create theONLY \"HistoryWith Conscience.\"6"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"AMERICA FACING THREE UNITED MONGOL FOESThe crushing of our civilization, predicted by Count Okuma,may be undertaken even to-day, probably beginning with a Judeo-Mongol attack upon the United States or a Judeo-Mongol attackupon Europe, as it is being now done in Bulgaria, in China, etc.Even the best informed Americans-ignore the fact that they are'today facingsimultaneouslythreeMongolianfoes(1)-The Judeo-Mongolian World Government\"the HiddenHand,\" which controls in 1925: (a) three hundred billion dollars ofavailable capital; (b) the world's press, and (c) many governments.(2)Mongolian Japan,whose assault is inevitable, as Mr. H.

America must, therefore, recognize andface the danger and prepare for any eventuality.Americans are somewhat intoxicated by the laurels of the FirstWorld War, when fate gave Americafifteen monthsof interval andabsolute security at home, between her declaration of war and herreal entrance upon the battlefields, where the American troopsmet the Germans, worn out by four years fighting.In the Second World War which is being staged by the WorldGovernmentagainst America,she will not be given evenfifteenminutesfor her preparations; this war will not be declared.. . .All of the above mentioned three Mongolian groups of foes ofthe United States were \"pro-American\" in 1918.

The husband and hiswife occupied the first floor and had a shop, where they boughtand sold wares. Outside on the pavement lay all kinds of secondhand objects. This miserable shop remains historic as the birth placeof to-day's proud \"barons\"-rulers of the world. On the shopwas placed a red ensign or a \"red schield\", in German \"rothschild\".All the children of Amschel adopted the name of Rothschild.Born in 1743 at Frankfort, Amschel was destined to become arabbi and entered a school, in which a good dose of Talmudicpoisonous hatred against evbvything Christian was instilled intohim. This done, he was sent to the bank of Oppepheim at Hanover,where he remained three years as an apprentice.There he made the acquaintance of Lieutenant-General baronvon Estorff the man nearest to Landgrave Frederick II. of HesseCassel (1760-1785).In 1770 Amschel returned to Frankfort and was married to GuttaShnapper. They had 5 sons and 5 daughters. They started verymodestly; the wife took care of the shop and the husband wentaround the town with a trunk full of goods, but especially to visitthe Jewish patriots and to inform himself.Soon baron von Estorff, to whom Amschel rendered some servicesat the expense of Oppenheim, introduced the young Jew to theLandgrave Frederic II, whose fortune was then evalued at 70-100million florins, an unheard of figure in those times. As this princewas very greedy and stingy, he did not care much concerning themeans through which his fortune, left to him by his father WilhelmVIII (the brother of theKingof Sweden) was increased.. .Frederic II, hearing from baron von Estorff about the abilityand the unscrupulousness of Amschel, became interested in procur-ing a \"cursed soul\" a \"man of straw\" for all his doubtful ope-rations.49"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE SELLING OF HUMAN \"GUN-FODDER\"The first Rothschild started on a gigantic scale the enrollingofyoung men, intoxicating them with liquors and with the glamor offame, equipping them for the role assigned them, then selling their:services to whatever powers anxious to make wars.

Through theLandgrave's influence, and, always working hand in hand withthe Secret World Jewish Covernrnent, located in Frankfort,Am-schel began to control all the Lodges of the Free Masonsand toguide them.France then was the most Christian country and the venomoushatred of the Jews (satanists, according toCHRIST HIMSELF)turned against her first of all.Amschel co-ordinated the hostilityof England and Germany against France, (because she helped theUnited States and because of their jealousy) with the Satan's leg-acy to the Jews-to destroy the Christians.Thus Pan-Judaismgripped once more the necks of Pan-Britanism andof Pan-Ger-manism for its own ends and our destruction.\"To the public the archives of the family, which could throw so muchlight upon history are a profound secret, a sealedbook, kepthidden\"(J.

From the timethat Amschel became the all powerful manager of the tremendousfortune of Wilhelm, it ceased to increase, while the wealth ofAmschel grew day by day, and at his death in September, 1812,he left to his sons ONE BILLION FRANKS, some authors say.In 1794, the famous French General Hoche took Coblentz.

But the claim was especiallyset forth at the International Masonic Congress in 1889 by thefree masons Amiable and Colfavru at a lecture on July 16 at theGrand Orient. They asserted that all the work had been done bythe masons and that the plan of the Revolution had been elaboratedby them before 1778: It is also significant that the Masonic Congresswas held in 1889, exactly 100 years after the outbreak of the Rev-olution of 1789...\t!Yes!But, however, all the leading (seemingly) masons:Robes-pierre, Danton, et al. were later on executed, after having accompli-shed the \"dirty work\"...

When Gustavus decided to interfere againstthe French Revolution, he was stabbed at a court ball by the freemasons.Joseph, also at a court ball, took some candy from a maskedwoman and died the next day (February 20, 1790):When Mirabeau could have prevented the murders, by takingthe side of the King, he was given coffee and \"suddenly\" died,while his two companions, who drank some of it with him (Fellencand Frochot) became gravely ill.*)Mirabeau died in great, but well deserved suffering...By murdering King Louis XVI., the Free-Masons were revengedfor the execution in 1314, by King Phillipe le Bel of their satanic,\"judaized\" Grand Master, Jacques Molai.*)''La Revolution, La Terreure, Le Direetoire\", by Despatys.69"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE \"MYSTERIES\" OF THE \"FRENCH\" REVOLUTION.\"ThepartythatpushedtheRevolutiontoviolencewasdirectedbyaHidden Hand,* which until today could not be surmised\".

At the same time the \"Great Assassin\" Amschel, disgusted with the inability of his Weisshaupt tocontinue wholesale murders, was searching for a talented fighter,and Talleyrand found him Napoleon.His fiery Corsican temperament and the declaration of hisreadiness to shoot down any number of people during peace or war,made him the favorite champion of the newly born Jewish Dynasty,So much the more so because the population began to be tired ofkilling one another. Mass-murdering ought to be done on some oth-er pretext besides \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\".Even the very shrewd Amschel, from his centre in Frankfort'sghetto, could not foresee that the hungry officer, whose chief ambi-tion was to obtain some stuff gratis for his uniform thru JosephineBeauharnais, might later on become a powerful monarch.The possibility of executing Satan's legacy, i. e. to murder mil-lions of Christians through Napoleon's talent and also the satanicdesire to upset the Christian Church, simply inebriated Amschel.In the 5 great powers later granted to Amschel to his sons, he or-dered the Jewish bankers and all the Secret Societies to help Napo-leonin everyway.So much so that Bonaparte showed himself, or was consideredby his supporters to be agnostic and very anti-Catholic. He simulatedthis to please the Free-Masons.To ruin the Universal Christian Church, to humiliate the HolyFather through Napoleon, became the most ardent desire of all theJews in all countries as \"conditio sine qua non\" for obtaining \"allthe kingdoms\" from Satan.

Napoleon obtained this just as the Jews:Gambettaobtained it in 1870 and Kerensky and Trotsky in 1917. Those \"over-whehning votes\" were paid by a Rothschild.Wells childishly says\"Now surely here was opportunity such as never came to man before.Here was a position in which a man might well bow himself in fear (1) ofhimself and search his heart and serve God to the utmost.\"How could a Weisshaupt, Napoleon, Gambetta, Disraeli,Bis-marck, Kerensky, Trotsky, Poincare, Lloyd George, W. Rathenau,et al, \"serve God and man\", when they were selected, bribed andsupported by the satanist who wished them to \"boreGod,\" asVictor Hugo said, and to murder the Christians.Napoleon's marriage to Josephine, themistress of Barras,was arranged by Barras in order to quit with her amiably,and, asdower, Napoleon received the command of the Frencharmy inItaly, which meant not so much fighting as plundering.And allthe Free-Masonry in Italy was supporting the invaders.Amscheland Free-Masonry had one chief aim-to destroy the ChurchatRome.All this helped Napoleon to develop his militarygeniusand to acquire the fame of \"invincible,\" which aided him later on.Even foes helped him.What is the \"mystery\"? Why does H. G.

Nathanbought it and increased its price. He \"cornered\" gold in London.He knew the Duke of Wellington needed it.Nathan also boughtthe Duke's bills at a large discount.The Government asked Nathanfor the loan of his gold and he transferred it to Portugal.Nathanloaned and had his gold returned but compelled the repaymentof the bills of the Duke at their full value.Thus he made 50%.Then he again loaned his gold at 15% and received it back to betransported to Portugal with a huge commission.The Duke needed this gold to pay the outfitters of his Army,who were all Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Jews. Thus not asingle pound of gold was sent. Wellington received only orders tothese Jews in Portugal, who were paid by Rothschild,Chief andTreasurer of the Jewish World Government in Frankfort later on.This operation netted Nathan 100%.Thus the Rothschilds madecolossal profits with the money of the Landgrave, but took all theprofits for themselves.Meanwhile, in Russia reigned, since 1796, Tsar Paul I.\"Poroshin(Paul's tutor) was learned and accomplished, a sound mathe-matician and a fine linguist.

Amschel hated nothing onearth more than the word \"Roma,\" because there lived the leaderof the Christians.\"Rome isthegreat foe of Bolshevism\"(A. Mond).The Pope in Rome, the King of Rome (Napoleon II) and the RomaNova (the Romanovs) in Russia, all of these made Amschel mad withsatanic fury. He delegated agents to ruin all of them.Amschelcreated an Empire of Gold and Usury, more durable than the Em-pires of Charlemagne, of Napoleon I, and of the Romanovs.Around a dirty table in the Judengasse, Amschel explained to hiswife, the most greedy of all the Jewesses of Frankfort, Gutta Shnap-per, and to his five sons and five daughters, the \"lust of murder\"and of making money out of plundering the Christians.Having learned in the rabbinic school all the satanic program,known as the \"Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,\" Amschelknew ahead of the assault on the royalty of race and its substitutionby the royalty of gold. He preached to his children how to rob andnot to be \"pinched,\" and all the devilish tricks of the Kabbalah (see\"The Kabbalah Unveiled,\" translated by S. L.

The power to bargainaway two of their number was not among the powers grantedto the Confederate States, either with or without the consentof the two.But the alternative was to lose all or to save theother nine States by perhaps the temporary sacrifice of two of theoriginal eleven.The hatred of the Southerners was so inflamedby the Hidden Hand's agents, that it was decided to appeal toNapoleon.He accepted the bargain and the author of the plot,Disraeli, assured the support of England, overexcited by the\"Alabama\" incident, exaggerated by the Rothschilds' agents.Numerous \"historians\" have written the History of the CivilWar, but none dared to reveal the Truth, which seems to be prac-tically ignored by the historians of the United States.170"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"CZAR THREATENS THE FOES OF THE U.

The $100billion should be distributed to the nations which took part in theWorld War, according to the number of their populations. Thiswould restore Europe.
