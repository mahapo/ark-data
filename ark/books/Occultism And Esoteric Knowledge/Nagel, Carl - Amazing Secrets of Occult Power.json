I have taught the secrets of how to cast Spells and work Rituals to scores of people in person, by mail, over the phone, and even over the Internet with equal success. I have taken those very same Spells and Rituals that have proved so successful for others, and included them in this book. You can use them yourself to make things easier. In this unusual book, you’re going to see how to “awaken” the magic power of witchcraft. In simple, plain language you’ll discover what witchcraft really is, how you can master it and how you can use it in lots of different ways for such things as attracting a steady flow of cash, winning perfect love, invoking the secret forces of nature, and much more.

Secrets of Witchcraft You have a power within you that can be woken. It is the same power that you can use to work any magic you want. Many witches work alone and with just as good results using the magic power of witchcraft as if they were working with a group. Using this magical power is simplicity itself. In Chapter 2 you will learn a simple Ritual that will summon the magical energy within you. When this Ritual has been completed, you will have made a very definite contact with the magic power of witchcraft. The old grimoires, hand-written books of magic, were most specific in what they said about the art and practice of magic. Dark forests, secluded caves, abandoned ruins, or upon the seashore beneath a full moon were considered as ideal places to work magic. You do not have to do anything so elaborate. Some space and a few minutes of your time each day is all that is required for you to work magic. Secrets of Money Magic This aspect of the occult is one of the most popular. When you use it, in effect, you bring money out of thin air. You can begin to receive a seemingly endless flow of cash into your life and start money flowing to you faster than you can spend it. In chapter 3, you are going to discover the secret of practical witchcraft and see how you can use spells and rituals to obtain money and material possessions. These Spells have proven"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"extremely successful in bringing money to meet financial needs. The effects of these money spells may not be as dramatic as finding a bundle of cash in an old shoebox, but things will become generally better for you as needs are met and financial limitations fade away. Here, too, is the secret of how to cast Spells that really work. A spell simply defined, is a set of words spoken that are believed to exert a magical effect on a situation that the person casting the spell seeks to change. The casting of Spells is based upon the ancient Wiccan belief that to speak a desire is to cause the desire to be fulfilled. Secrets of Sex Magic Have you ever seen a beautiful woman in the company of a real nerd, and wondered how he got so lucky? Maybe it was Sex Magic. In the eternal story of men chasing women, and vice versa, it should always be remembered that Witchcraft and Sex Magic have seduced more members of the opposite sex than any amount of good looks, intelligence or position. Sex Magic can influence and attract the opposite sex like nothing else can. It can compel a girl to introduce herself to a man in whom she had no previous interest. The secret of occult ribaldry is revealed in Chapter 4. There you will see how to cause any young girl, however prudent she may be, to become maddened and inflamed with lust. Secrets of the Cabala A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" It is said that God created the world by pronouncing the Tetragrammaton correctly and it is regarded as the ultimate magical word of power. The Tetragrammaton is an essential part of the Cabala, a form of mysticism that evolved from Judaism. One tradition surrounding the Cabala is that magic Spells and Rituals based upon its system possesses an extremely potent effect over all forms of matter. Chapter 5 tells you exactly how to use the magical power of the Cabala to increase your money supply. Secrets of the Spirit World Is there a place of coming together between the living and the dead? An essential part of the esoteric arts is communicating with the spirit world. This is something that occultists have been doing since the beginning of time, and now you can join their ranks. The secret of contacting the spirit world is disclosed in Chapter 6. There you’ll see how you can make a powerful occult tool in minutes, and use it to make direct contact with the invisible inhabitants of the next dimension to get fast, truthful answers about what lies ahead. Here, too, is the meaning of signs and omens, divining the future with dice, and a most unusual psychic technique that will enable you to actually “see” the invisible world around you.

A naked young girl lays outstretched on an altar, her loose blond hair rippling over her shoulders and across the cold altar stones. Her pale flesh bathed in the glow of the full moon above. Her breasts rise and fall to the fear inside her, as hooded figures draw close to the altar and a low-pitched chant begins to fill the night air. Standing before her, the Coven Master takes up the chant as, with head bowed, an assistant hands him the sacrificial knife, its blade shining in the silver moonlight. From out of the darkened wood another figure appears leading a goat that he takes to the side of the altar as the priest begins his litany. He calls out a list of demonic names and to them he addresses his earnest plea for them to bear witness to what is about to take place. \"Astaroth, help us!” he intones. \"Demons, Dagon, Azazel, Pan help us! Asmodeus, we beseech thee! We are gathered here in thy honor, O Great God, Baal! We offer unto thee the body of the virgin, so that we may live eternally in the darkness of thy womb.\" Then, with knife raised high, he walks slowly towards the goat and with quick, neat thrust slits its throat. An expectant hush falls as three hooded figures step forward to catch the blood in a golden chalice and pass it round the coven, each of whom takes a sip, then bows his"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"head. Finally it is the Coven Master’s turn. He raises the chalice, drinks part of its contents and uses the still-warm blood to draw numerous occult symbols on the belly of the naked girl. An excited wail rises up from the coven, and is quickly stilled. And so begins a typical witchcraft ceremony. Or perhaps I should say Hollywood's idea of a typical witchcraft ceremony. Truth is, most witches are involved in rather mundane things like ceremonies to ensure that the sun comes up every morning. You can't help feeling that there must be more to it than this. The Gray Man There are two sides, or faces, to witchcraft: the pagan worship of Nature, and the manipulative side, i.e. that of deliberately influencing chance and coincidence for one’s own end. This book is about the second, hidden face. But before I continue let me tell you something about myself. I first became involved with the occult arts as such through the now defunct Psychic Research Society of Australia. Thinking it involved actual research, you can imagine my dismay that it seemed to have been taken over completely by little old ladies with blue rinses trying to make contact with a loved one recently departed, i.e. Spiritualism! All was not lost however; I remember a day in December 1978 when something uninvited came to visit. I had become a member a member of the Society a mere four weeks earlier to study the mysteries of the soul and the universe, only to find the subject bewildering and full of apparent contradictions. The weekly meetings were confined to exercises in ESP and lectures on the limitless virtues of spiritualism which Ivan, the psychic who ran the class, believed were of main interest to the sitters. I had joined the organization in the hope of gaining an insight into the benefits, material and spiritual, that could be quickly gained by the study and application of occultism and one's own higher instincts, A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"only to find the weekly classes both repetitive and dull. We had gathered together in the small room that served as a meeting place; discussing things beyond the physical touch, of seeing the future with our unseeing eyes, when a ghostly figure walked right through a closed door into the room where we were seated. It shuffled across the room towards a somewhat sinister looking man. Slowly raised its arm and pointed at him. Then abruptly it was gone. There was something special and very familiar about the mysterious entity and its actions. But from the view of the people who were with me that day, something very unusual (unusual, that is, for them) had happened. They had never before been confronted in the middle of the afternoon by a tall gray entity of apparently supernatural origin. They knew nothing about it or the reasons for its presence so they were forced to speculate. Why would a ghostlike apparition suddenly appear in their midst? The Society was like a second home to me in those days. I had a few friends there. One of them, Ralph a government employee with an interest in paranormal phenomena was with me that day. He had been given the task of running the class whilst Ivan was away on vacation, and as we talked on into the late afternoon it was difficult to know if we had really seen something in the room. We had to consider that it could have been a shadow cast by something going past the window. I had been sitting facing the window with my eyes closed when the entity came and stood in front of me, blocking out the sunlight shining in through the window. I had an interesting emotional reaction (interesting, that is, to me) to this event. I felt a strange sensation. Something indefinite, haunting, something half-forgotten, a far away memory returning again. When I was six or seven years old, one bright sunny day, I was playing in the backyard of the family home when I happened to look up and saw a tall, gray colored entity standing over me. It made no sound and had no eyes, ears, nose, mouth, or anything like that it was just like a solid gray form. I screamed aloud and shouted for my parents, but the entity vanished before anyone else"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"had time to see it. I would prefer to believe that my presence in the class that December did not cause the strange entity to appear. I certainly had no inclination of what was to come. The Society no longer exists, now. But I remember. I remember the Gray Man, as I have come to call him and the effect his brief presence had upon the people gathered in the small room that fateful day. After leaving the society, I read as many books as I could on the subject of mind power, magic, witchcraft and the occult. I learnt a lot from those books on the basics of how Rituals are formed and the format for applying one's mental abilities. However, they were not of the type you would normally associate with magical practice. I tried to read Aleister Crowley’s Magick in Theory and Practice; but it was written in such a convoluted manner that it was, to me, almost like trying to read Latin without ever having learned the language. As a consequence, I began forming my own Spells and Rituals based on occult tradition. Black Magic, Sex Magic, Mind Power and, of course, Witchcraft. What Witches Do The cornerstone of witchcraft is the coven. A coven is just a fancy name for a group of people who like to get together every so often, take all their clothes off, and dance about in a circle, in the open air. It is lead by a Coven Master. The purpose of the coven is to build magical energy amongst its members to achieve the coven's common objectives, such as ensuring that there is a full moon every month and that summer returns after winter. Covens hold great feasts on certain nights each year, February 2 (Candlemas), April 30 (Walpurgis Night), August 1 (Lammas), and October 31 (Halloween). These four dates are the main witch Sabots of the year. Special nights on which white witches gather to celebrate their devotion to the moon goddess Diana, and the goat-footed god of fertility, Pan, indulging in drink, laughter, love, and song. The more interesting covens, on the other hand, indulge in an orgy of A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"wickedness where all the instincts are given free reign. The dark forces, pleased by the perversions performed for them, then pursue obtaining the tasks asked of them by the participants. Welcome to the Coven There are various forms of secret initiation ceremonies depending on the type of coven one seeks to join. In most instances the initiate is a woman; though, in some cases a man will be initiated into the coven. The Coven Master enters the room and draws a magic circle on the floor. The spirits of the North are called upon to witness the ceremony with the words, “I summon, serve, and call Ye up Mighty Ones of the North to guard the Circle and to witness our rites.” The initiate is led naked to the center of the circle with her hands tied behind her back, and blindfolded. At the center of the circle she repeats a solemn vow, then she is presented to each member of the coven who greet her with a kiss. Next she is introduced to the spirits of the four cardinal points. She then kneels in the center of the circle and repeats another vow. She is asked what she most desires, and answers “To serve the Old Ones.” Finally she is asked if she realizes that before she can be accepted her body must first be purified, and answers “I do.” She is then whipped forty times across the quivering flesh of her naked behind. The blindfold is removed with the words, “So be it.” Her bonds are removed with the words, “Now you are free.” Once again she is presented to each member of the coven who greet her with a kiss. The coven is now free to spend the evening in whatever way they wish. Anyone Can Be A Witch"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Contrary to popular belief not all witches belong to covens. I certainly don’t, though I do live in close proximity to an area of parkland once used by a coven to hold its meetings during the Second World War. Many work alone and with just as good results using the magic power of witchcraft as if they were working with a group. There is nothing special that you have to be or no one special you have to know, in order for you to work witchcraft. Those who would wish you not to know how easy it is to use the magic power of witchcraft have fostered this commonly held belief. As you are reading this, the essence of that power is sinking deep into your inner mind. This book has been written in a special way. No matter whether you believe me or not, the magic behind the words is awakening racial memories of a time long ago when this power was free to every man and woman who sought it. Using this magical power is simplicity itself. In detail, I’ll be explaining how to do it later in this book. The Circle of Protection In reading these words you will learn many ancient secrets of the occult. This will cause you to “glow” in a metaphysical sense; spirits can see this glow and are drawn to it, and some will try to mislead you. You can protect yourself from this by taking a handful of salt and, walking in a clockwise direction, sprinkle the salt in a circle around the room all the while saying: “Let mischievous spirits touch me not.” A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" It's a good idea to work this protection Ritual on a regular basis. The circle begins and ends at the doorway of the room. The Sign of the Elder Gods The pentagram (five-pointed star) is another tool used by both witches and magicians to keep evil forces at bay. The more complicated forms of magic require the magician to create a Cabalistic circle of protection - in which a pentagram is visualized at each of the cardinal points, joined one to the other by a fiery circle with the magician at its center. There is more to it than this, of course. The protection of the four archangels is requested, along with the visualization of the archangels and the elemental forces associated with them. In detail, I’ll be explaining how to do it later in this book. The pentagram represents man - the five points being his head, two arms, and two legs. Inverted it becomes the symbol of Baphomet, the Goat of a Thousand Young. Now to understand what Baphomet represents, I need to give you a little lesson on the Knights Templar, a debased Christian sect that practiced occult Rituals. King Phillipe of France had them burnt at the stake in the 14th century for worshipping Baphomet - an idol with the head and feet of a goat, the breasts of a woman, and the wings of an angel. Inverted the pentagram becomes the symbol of Baphomet - the five points being two horns, two ears, and the beard. So now you know! Love and Witchcraft Love has always been a problem. Witches and witchcraft have long been associated with the search for love. The warlock of medieval"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"times, desiring to arouse love and passion in another, was required to make a figure of wax to represent the woman whose company he desired above all else. The preliminaries included burning frankincense, and the solemn lighting of two candles. The figure of wax, on which were inscribed the names of assorted demons, was passed back and forth through the fumes, while reciting the conjuration: “I conjure and command thee, thou spirits, who have the power to disturb the hearts of women! By Him who created thee and by this image, I conjure thee this night into my presence, so I may have the power to compel whomsoever I desire to love me.” After this the figure of wax was taken to a place where three ways met, and buried. In the old days those who had committed suicide, or those who had been executed for any kind of witchcraft, were buried at a crossing. Crossings were also considered as ideal places to summon Satan, or start toward a sabot. Another powerful love spell still secretly practiced today, required the warlock to watch for a crescent or waning moon between 11pm and midnight. Before casting the spell he would write, on parchment, the name of the young girl he desired to attract, and draw a circle around it. As soon as he saw the moon, he would seek out the brightest star in the night sky and recite a solemn conjuration so powerful it was believed capable of drawing any young girl the warlock desired to him. The conjuration was repeated three times and the parchment burned. The ashes were placed in the warlock’s left shoe and were left there until the young girl either came to the warlock or faded away. The Black Pullet The warlock of medieval times did not confine his witchery to the securing of love alone; he also lusted after buried treasure and its possession. Imagine if you will Egypt in 1740. A young officer is sent A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"on an expedition to the Pyramids. The party of explorers lunch in the shadow of the great stone mountains of the desert, and are attacked by a horde of Arabs. The comrades of the young officer are slain, and he himself is left for dead upon the ground. On returning to consciousness, he surrenders himself to the immediate anticipation of his end, and delivers a farewell address to the setting sun. A stone is rolled back in the Pyramid, and a venerable old man issues forth. The old man does not fail to discover the corpses that are strewn about the desert, or to identify their country of origin. When the young officer in his turn is examined, the ancient man takes pity on him, and gives him a magical liqueur that puts the wounded man back on his feet. He follows the old man into the Pyramid, and discovers a world of magic. There are vast halls and endless galleries, subterranean chambers piled high with treasures, apparitions of blazing lamps, legions of familiar spirits and there, also, is the Black Pullet. It is a supernatural version of Aladdin with an inner meaning of Astaroth. The sage himself proves to be the sole heir of the ancient magi and is himself, in quest of an heir for he feels he is about to pass away. In time the French officer, seeing that his protector possesses a talisman that confers immediate proficiency in all tongues, is instructed in the powers and wonders of twenty-two talismanic figures and magical rings, as well as in the secret of the manufacture of the Black Pullet. After these instructions, and in spite of many prayers, the Old Man of the Pyramids expires upon a sofa, while his apprentice in the esoteric arts swoons at the feet of his mentor. In due course, accompanied by the familiar spirits that have been transferred to his service, laden with treasures, and with the ashes of the sage in a costly urn, the French officer returns to his native country. He makes his abode in Provence, spending his days in experiments with the Black Pullet. Such is the legend of The Black Pullet, a handbook of magic written in Egypt in 1740, and how one may acquire riches through the application of magical rites and ceremonies. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Magic of Herbs Herbs have always been a staple item in the witch’s world of chants, spells and rituals. They have a long Wiccan tradition, being used for all kinds of weird and wonderful purposes. The historical record shows that they were part of the Wiccan tradition amongst the Ancient Egyptians, Celts, Druids, Romans and Greeks. Herbs can be obtained in one of two ways. From the countryside where they grow in abundance, or ready-packed for sale in occult supply stores. Witches have also been known to employ the humble lemon in their spellcasting. A traditional formula for ascertaining if the man on a woman’s mind is going to be hers or not is the following: Carry all day in a pocket or purse two lemon peels. One peel can be put in the purse the other in a pocket or each peel in a separate pocket. At night before retiring to bed rub the legs of the bed with the peels thinking intently on what you seek to know. Place the peels under pillow and that night, if she is to have him, he will appear in a dream. If no dream of him comes he is not to be hers. The Children of the Night The art and practice of witchcraft goes hand in hand with eerie legends of mysterious, evil creatures that are seen by the light of a full moon. These legends have existed through the centuries and are as old as man. It is difficult to separate the two. They are all part of the same thing: the unknown world of supernatural forces. I have included here three of the most enduring of these legends. Zombies, the dead that walk, raised from their graves to work as mindless slaves for powerful voodoo exponents who, in order to obtain their wishes, would call upon Baron Samedi, the voodoo god of the dead, to summon the zombies into their presence. Zombies A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"were afraid of fire and were destroyed when their master died. The mediaeval vampires living in the remote regions of Transylvania who, in order to sustain their monstrous existence, would leave their tombs at midnight to drink the blood of young virgins. A girl, once bitten, would become a virgin of the undead and, her eyes burning with a dark desire, was forever more drawn back to the vampire’s embrace. The only way to kill a vampire was to drive a sharp, pointed stake through its heart. The werewolf, a man who was transformed into a gigantic wolf under the influence of the full moon; tearing out the throats of his victims, and feasting on their blood. Another name for this was lycanthropy. The werewolf was both man and monster...the paradox. The Fear of Witchcraft Most people are paranoid that you will use witchcraft either to gain control of them or place a curse upon their heads, and will know that sympathetic magic requires either an item of clothing etc., or a photo to make it work. It is for this reason that no-one will willingly hand over, or send you, anything which could in some way be used to work magic against them. The basis of sympathetic magic is that there is a connection between an object and a symbol. For example, make a doll in the likeness of someone you don't like, stick pins in it and the victim gets stabbing pains in his back. Or gather together hair and nail clippings, burn them and the person in question gets a fever. It’s not always to do something unpleasant. The best way to win the love of a maiden is to chant an incantation three times over an apple, give the fruit to the young girl to eat, and she will surely come to you. The best example of sympathetic magic in witchcraft is the mandrake plant. A rather mysterious plant whose main use in the Middle Ages was as an aphrodisiac due to its shape, which resembles a certain"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"part of the male anatomy. The powdered root of the mandrake was burned over a fire with some of the witch’s pubic hair. At the same time, the witch’s lustful desires were spoken, invoking a demon to draw the desired person to the witch’s embrace. Occult tradition has it that you can’t harvest the mandrake plant in the normal way as the scream it gives as it leaves the ground will kill you or drive you mad. The shriek is supposedly the cry of jealous spirits who dwell within. Instead you tie it to a dog’s collar and, when out of earshot, whistle the dog to come to you. Witchcraft Made Easy During my twenty plus years of studying and practicing the occult sciences, I have come to find that much of witchcraft is unnecessarily complicated. Witchcraft is an act of celebration and freedom, and to me it seems pointless that it should get bogged down with rules and regulations. However, even when you reach the point when you realize that much of the paraphernalia associated with witchcraft, i.e.. Candles, incense and so forth, can be dispensed with you will find that the moon still holds sway over certain things. The ancient witch cults knew this and timed their activities to the different phases of the moon. Positive magic is worked from the first quarter until a full moon, and black magic from the last quarter until a new moon. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Creating Your Personal Grimoire Once the magic begins to flow, things are going to happen so fast and so often that it will be difficult to keep track of them by mere memory alone. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" The easiest way to remember all the practical expressions of your magical workings is to keep a small notebook in which you write your occult experiences. Call this notebook your Personal Grimoire. I use a small pocket diary, although you may wish to purchase something more ornate for this your first occult tool. This is the time to be specific, and your notebook is a handy reminder that a certain Spell will produce a certain result. You will get your first inkling of the power you are in touch with as you see the magical happenings in your life recorded in your notebook. Chapter 2 YOU CAN AWAKEN YOUR MAGIC POWER You have a power within you that can be woken. It is what the Ancient Avatars of the Mystic East use to call “the Fiery Serpent”...” the Great Body of Radiance”...and “the Immutable Light.” It is the same power that you can now use to work any magic you want. You may have expected that at this stage you would be told to obtain mystic robes, magic wands, bat’s wings, eye of newt, and cauldrons, or to indulge in blood drinking and human sacrifice. Such occult paraphernalia and activities are not only out of date, but also totally unnecessary to make your magic power work for you. The first, very simple step in waking your “fiery serpent” from its ancient slumber is to find a place where you can create a witching circle. The old grimoires, hand-written books of magic Spells, invocations,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"herbal recipes, incantations and other magical lore were most specific in what they said about the location of a witching circle. Dark forests, secluded caves, abandoned ruins, or upon the seashore beneath a full moon were considered as ideal places to work magic. You do not have to do anything so elaborate. Preparations are simple, but you need to ensure silence with no interruptions. First, make a physical space to stand in without being obstructed or cluttered. That means that when you stand at the center of your cleared area, you can stretch your hands and arms out all around you. This is your personal Witching Circle. If you wish you can burn a stick of incense and have the room illuminated by candles placed at the four cardinal points. And, until you are confident in your power to keep mischievous spirits at bay, a circle of protection marked on the floor in salt. The Ritual That Will Awaken Your Fiery Serpent Here now is a Ritual to summon the magic power within you. This requires only a few minutes of your time each day and privacy. When Witches work their Rituals, they work naked. The absence of clothing leaves them completely free and unrestricted, not only in body, but also in mind and spirit. You should work the Spells and Rituals that follow in this manner. Stand at the center of your witching circle, with your feet apart. Face north. Raise your arms to each side until they are between horizontal and pointing up. Close your eyes and take ten deep breaths. Slowly sweep your arms up until your palms are together above your head arms as straight as possible. Move your hands back, lift your chin, inhale and arch your back as much as you can. Begin to breathe out, straighten up, and bring your hands slowly down to your sides. Take three deep breaths after your hands reach your sides, bring your feet together and open your eyes. End of Ritual. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"When this Ritual has been completed, you have made a very definite contact with the magic power of witchcraft. Your life will never again be the same. Whenever a specific area of your life is in need of help, work the whole of the Ritual, and as you finish taking the three breaths cast whatever Spell is appropriate to your desire. It is the Spell that draws out your power and sends it on its way. For easy reference, think of the entire Ritual as “the awakening of magic power” up to the point where you open your eyes again. I shall be referring to that description later in this book. The instructions will say, “Awaken your magic power” and this tells you that you should prepare for the Ritual and carry it out from beginning to end. Note: If your doctor advises you that deep breathing is dangerous for you; or if at any time during this magic working you become dizzy or see spots before your eyes, do not continue. Physical Sensations of Occult Power Here you should know about different sensations that often accompany the awakening of your magic power. I mention it because you may be worried by it until you are told it is perfectly normal. As you bring your hands down a tingling, or warmth or both, may be felt around them. A strong itching or tickling may begin in your forehead, well below the skin. These are all signs that your magic power is flooding to the surface.

"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Seeing Your Invisible Power Perhaps you are thinking: “How can something I can’t see possibly help me?” I will now show you how to see the magic power within you. Once this happens, you will be above any doubt, and no amount of argument or ridicule from others who have yet to understand will ever be able to convince you that invisible occult forces do not exist. I learnt this particular technique during my days at the Psychic Research Society of Australian. No special equipment is required for this simple psychic experience. Switch off the TV and radio. Place an ordinary padded kitchen chair in the center of your witching circle. Once your chair is positioned, darken the room by drawing the drapes or hanging a blanket at the window. Ideally, the room should be dim enough so that you cannot read the fine print of a newspaper. Now arrange a single light to shine gently over your shoulder so that you are able to see your hands in front of you. Awaken your magic power. Sit down in your chair and relax. Make yourself comfortable with your back straight, but not stiff. Tuck your buttocks into the back of the chair so that your spine is upright, with your chin held level without straining to hold the position. Place your feet flat on the floor, almost touching. Lay your hands in one of two ways, whichever feels easier, either palms upward on your thighs or palms downward on your lap. You are now ready to begin. Hold up your right hand so that the light shining gently over your shoulder illuminates it, and bring your fingers together so that your thumb and forefinger are touching, in the shape of an “O”. Now separate your fingers a little moving the tips a fraction of an inch apart. Look past your fingers at a spot in front of you. Between your fingers, a hazy light should be visible. This is your magic power circulating around you.

Here’s my situation. I have several health problems I’m using an occult ritual to heal. It seems to be working somewhat for me. It appeals to the Spirits Beings Zoroel and Sabriel, who govern health, for healing. Naturally, I’m thankful for their assistance. I do a self-hypnosis/relaxation induction and then perform the ritual. I feel this is helping me. Somehow, I intuit that my progress is artificially slow, like I'’ somehow standing in my own way. I’ve tried many things over the past few years to help. My question is: are you aware of any ways of strengthening a ritual?” I replied to his email, explaining that the simplest way of strengthening a ritual is to align with the elemental forces of Earth, Air, Fire and Water. I suggested he should continue with the relaxation technique and add the elemental ritual to his magical workings. I ended the email by asking him to keep me informed of his progress. Another email arrived from Paul a few days later. “Since you asked,” he wrote. “Last night I performed the elemental rite you sent me for the first time. It was a very positive experience! I put off starting it for a couple of days, as I could not find my trusty compass to make sure I was facing the four directions. I did a best guess even though my sense of direction could have been slightly off.

Chapter 3 WICCAN MONEY SPELLS In Chapter Two you learned that the magic power of witchcraft can be woken through the study and practice of the Fiery Serpent Ritual. If you never learned another thing about the occult world, the knowledge that you already possess marks you as a genuine witch. But there is more, much more. Obtaining money through the use of Magic Spells and Rituals is just one more amazing secret that is revealed to you in the pages of this remarkable book. How to Cast Spells That Really Work Spells are the fun part of what we call witchcraft; simple gestures, uttered words, seemingly illogical actions, frowned upon by the scientific mind nevertheless make strange and wonderful things happen for the person who casts them. The casting of Spells is based upon the Wiccan belief that to speak a desire is to cause the A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"desire to be fulfilled. When it comes to spellcasting, there's always a chance of first time success if the desire is strong, though it usually does take time and practice to achieve results. The thing that makes most Spells work is the emotion you invest in them. Get involved with the Spell, in this way you will turn it from a simple unemotional act into a genuine Spell. Use these Spells to obtain only one desire at a time. If you go after a whole string of desires, the magical power is spread thinly over all of them, and takes longer. Better to achieve one at a time in order of importance. If you find yourself constantly interrupted when you attempt to cast a Spell, you should know that occult reasons are the cause. Probably you should attempt some other means of obtaining what you seek (take a look at another Spell), or reconsider your actions.

Practical Witchcraft "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Having now defined our subject let us progress to the practical uses for which it can be employed. Let us first take a look at Spells that will appeal to many readers, Spells to bring money. The effects of these Spells may not be as dramatic as finding a bundle of cash in an old shoebox or winning the lottery. But everything will become generally better for you as needs are met and financial limitations melt away. And if you are in the least bit worried that the practical application of witchcraft in some way breaks one of the basic Wiccan laws, don’t be. Let me assure you that witches won’t admit that they are using witchcraft to do what everyone would want to use it for - to gain money, power and sex. The Magic Word That Will Bring Money to You There is an ancient magic word used in the Orient, which is said to have remarkable powers. You may recognize this word, for it has been around for thousands of years. Yet it still retains all its power and potency. The word is “OM,” and it represents the Hidden Truths and Secrets of the Universe. The repeated utterance of this one word can bring many of your desires to pass. The word is not important. It is the vibrations that count. Try it. Say “OM” slowly, over and over, making it rhyme with “home.” Say the word aloud a few times, so that you can listen to yourself saying it. After you have said the word four or five times, you will feel the vibration from it starting to build up in your body, getting stronger and stronger.

It is concerned with bringing moderate amounts of money to meet financial needs. Before beginning, write down on a piece of paper what bills need paying or what you want the money for.

Put out all lights except the candle and read your piece of paper once more. Awaken your magic power and then close your eyes and see exactly what it is that you want, i.e. see the money appearing in your hands. Get involved with the money. Use your imagination to touch and feel the money, it is real. Having visualized for a few minutes open your eyes and gaze into the candle flame. Say “OM,” the magical word seven times, slowly. Close your eyes again and visualize the money in your hands. Now sit back, and wait for the money to come to you. You will notice the use of the color green for this Spell. Green is the traditional color used by witches in money matters. Green is the color of Mother Nature and is also the color of paper money; dollar bills are green.

The Magic Power of Chants Ask any witch worth their broomstick, and they will tell you that certain sounds (chants) create unique magical vibrations. They will also tell you that these magical vibrations seek similar vibrations within the Astral World, becoming a single creative force of energy that goes to work to make a physical manifestation of its power. This physical manifestation is called magic. The secret chant I will soon reveal to you is so effective that it should be used with caution. I discovered it in a long out of print book of magic. I began using it, idly, without thinking and as I did, a strange sequence of events followed that even I am at a loss to explain. In the days and weeks ahead, everything I wanted I received with this secret chant. New friends, rare books, money, and more. I felt a strange sensation envelop me, a feeling of power and protection. The chant should be spoken aloud in a sort of “up and down” rhythm. Before you begin saying the chant, practice aloud by counting from one to seven in the same voice that you will use when using the chant to influence chance and coincidence to bring you whatever it is you seek. As you practice, you will notice that you are developing a very definite rhythm as you pronounce the numbers. This same rhythm should be used as you use the chant.

I would suggest you begin the chant on a Sunday, at or near the Full Moon. The Golden Square Spell Gnomes are the elemental spirits of the earth. They have the general appearance of grotesquely deformed dwarfs, but despite their appearance gnomes are benevolent in nature. One occult belief is that gnomes are the guardians of buried treasure, and inhabit the darkest depths of mines. Their essence can be found in the earth, wood and metals. This Spell will help you to enlist their aid in your affairs. Before you begin, go outside and pick up a pinch of earth and take it inside with you. Enter your witching circle.

Spell Brings Needed Money This particular case history was told to me over the telephone, so I will have to relate it using my own words. Laura D. was by no means rich, and when she received a phone bill for $300 had no idea where she could get the needed money. She was at her wit’s end. So when I suggested that she use the Golden Square to draw money to her, she was only too happy to give it a try. She followed my instructions. One week later, Laura’s mother-in-law came to visit and handed her an envelope. A gift, she told Laura. It contained $300 in cash. The Elemental Forces worked for Laura, and they will work for you. The Devil’s Treasurer This is a very potent Black Magic Spell to bring money. If Black Magic didn’t work, there would be no reason for me to include this Spell in this chapter or for you to try it. But Black Magic really works. Not the old fashioned kind with bats and black cats, but an entirely new magical system based on principles thousands of years old that, under the correct conditions, works every time. This Spell is the result of years of research into arcane magical texts and documents. All the confusing parts of the old texts have been discarded. The remaining wisdom has been sorted out, de-fantasized and re-integrated into a proven system that works. This Spell can yield regular financial gains if performed correctly.

Not a lot, there will be no sudden puffs of green smoke, rolls of thunder, or flashes of lightning. Neither will an unclean spirit appear dressed in a scarlet coat, yellow vest, and pale green breeches, with a head resembling a dog, the ears of an ass, two horns, and the legs and hoofs of a calf. Nor anything else that the old grimoires would have us believe are necessary when magic is being worked.

Chapter 4 SEX MAGIC TODAY Modern day witches make loud noises about how straight-laced there ceremonies are, but witches from all times and all places have always recognized the enormous level of magical power contained in the sex act. The idea behind the wide and traditional uses of sex in witchcraft is that at the moment of sexual climax you release a power that can be tapped for magical ends. The practice of sex magic is widespread. Generally, something along these lines: The flickering light of candles illuminates the room.

Its chief ornament is a well-oiled artificial phallus of marble or wood, tall black candles and a chalice. Beside it is a small whip. If the ceremony is an all-night affair, sensuous music is played to heighten the atmosphere. The Coven Master wears a red robe and the others black cloaks to cover their nakedness, their faces hidden behind small black ‘domino’ masks. As the ceremony begins the coven renounces all other religions, vows to serve the dark forces, and pledges to keep its activities secret. Sexual offerings are made to the dark spirits attracted to the ceremony. The coven removes their masks and cloaks, and turns their attentions to the gratification of the senses. Each member is encouraged to indulge in his or her own perversions to ensure the excitement reaches a fever pitch. And when the Coven Master considers the orgy of wickedness is reaching a climax of excitement, he begins to work the magic, harnessing the sexual energy liberated by the lowering of inhibitions. Once the initial ceremony is completed, a ‘Queen of the Night’ (usually a recently initiated member of the coven) is elected to satisfy the sexual demands of the Coven Master. She is carried to the altar, laid down and surrounded by black candles, and ‘worshipped’ by the more virile men of the coven. She is stroked, kissed and otherwise stimulated until her passions are aroused. Only then is she brought before the Coven Master who copulates with her, until he is exhausted.

He was, for a short time, a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, but his true interest lie in the OTO (Ordo Templis Orientis), a German order involved in sexual magic. He took this and adapted it into a new religion, Thelema. A magical system dedicated to the enlightenment of one’s soul via sex rituals held in honor of Pan, the god of earthly existence and often portrayed as the carnal side of man’s nature. In 1920 Crowley established his ‘Abbey of Thelema’ on a small island off the coast of Sicily, the walls of which were covered with an incredible collection of Crowley’s artistic expertise. Frescoes and paintings depicting every conceivable form of sexual deviation adorned the walls. The Temple of the Abbey (the central hall) contained an altar at the center of a magic circle, a throne upon which Crowley would sit during the rituals dedicated to magic and sexuality, and various other occult paraphernalia such as an artificial phallus and a whip. From time to time, Crowley would nominate a willing female disciple to be his idea of the Scarlet Woman, a particularly wanton prostitute. And subject her to every form of humiliation and degradation his fertile mind could come up with – including branding between the breasts! After his death at Hastings, England in 1947, his erotic poem ‘Hymn to Pan’, was recited during the funeral services by his remaining few disciples, and an occult ceremony held at his grave.

The Demon of Lust The Clavis Magica Artium describes Asmodeus as a demon of sensuality and luxury. He is also well versed in the sexy art of occult ribaldry, i.e. how to cause a young girl, however prudent she may be, to become maddened and inflamed with lust. Here is an arcane truth: More people have been seduced and influenced by the occult without their knowledge than by any amount of good looks, wealth, or intelligence.

She got into my car when meeting her she asked for a kiss, after a drink she wanted me to make love to her which she asked me, and I didn’t have to say or do a thing.

There must be nothing left hanging, nor must there be anything left crosswise. Then, after supper, go there secretly, light a good fire, put a white cloth on the table and set three places, with a chair, a roll, and a glass of water at each. Put a chair and a settee beside the bed and, when you retire to bed, recite a conjuration. When the three spirits appear, they will draw lots as to which keeps you company, and the other two will sit at the table beside the fire. The chosen spirit will sit by the bed and talk to you answering questions on any subject you care to ask about, and telling you where to find hidden treasure if there is any in the locality. Before departing at midnight, he or she will give you a ring that will assure you of success in love and luck at cards. What makes this ancient Spell so interesting is the conjuration, for I have discovered that it acts as a kind of secret code of communication between us and the incubi and succubi – sexual spirits that visit us by night to tempt us with all manner of lusts and depravities. Repeating the conjuration will cause you to have intercourse with them in the reality of an erotic dream.

Magical Aphrodisiacs Another tradition of sexual magic and practice is the custom of feeding your partner with certain foods imbued with aphrodisiac properties that will arouse his or her passions.

Thus by compliance with the Laws of Astrology a witch can gain better results from his or her actions. Here is a list of the most suitable aphrodisiac foods for the various astrological signs: "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" Aries: Cinnamon, pepper, and chestnuts. Taurus: Grapes and sage. Gemini: Carrots and fennel. Cancer: Garlic and peppermint. Leo: Almonds and celery seed. Virgo: Apples and thyme. Scorpio: Ginger, mustard, and onions. Sagittarius: Sesame seed and nutmeg. Capricorn: Dates and wintergreen. Aquarius: Bananas and rye. Pisces: Mint and oranges. The word “aphrodisiac” is derived from “Aphrodite”, the Love Goddess of the Ancient Greeks whom the Romans called “Venus”. Of all the goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome, none was more widely venerated than the goddess of love was. Every god -even Zeus himself - wanted the beautiful, golden Aphrodite as his wife, but she was too proud and rejected them all. One of her children was Eros, the winged god of love.

Chapter 5 ANCIENT SECRETS OF THE CABALA It is said that God created the world by pronouncing the Tetragrammaton correctly and it is regarded as the ultimate magical word of power. The Tetragrammaton is an essential part of the Cabala, a form of mysticism that evolved from Judaism. It is the four letter name of God – Yod, He, Vau, He – and is normally pronounced Jehovah or Yahweh, and sometimes Adonai. Please do not try to understand it now, you will not be able to until you have mastered the Middle Pillar Ritual revealed in this chapter. But once you are ready for it, I think you will find it to be one of the most profound and rewarding experiences in your life. Here, too, are the Secret Names of God that magical adepts have used for centuries to invoke the hidden powers of the Cabala, and a most powerful Ritual that will send any unfriendly spirits back where they came from in short order, never to return. One tradition surrounding the Cabala is that magic Spells and Rituals based upon its system possesses an extremely potent effect over all forms of matter. Such magical formulae are naturally much sought after and books containing them are hard to come by. The Tree of Life "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Cabala is the secret teaching of the ancient Hebrews concerning the inner meaning to the simplistic doctrines and philosophy of the Old Testament, and forms the basis of modern occult thought. It is immensely complex, and it takes many years of earnest study and practice to master the merest fraction of it. The central symbol in Cabalism is the Tree of Life, giving the path to perfection. The idea is that you follow a complex path of spiritual enlightenment up the tree passing through each Sepher (divine emanation) until you achieve union with God in Kether the Crown. An interesting aspect of the Cabala is that the achieving of knowledge is likened to sexual union with Shekinah, a female personification of wisdom. This is similar to the Gnostic Sophia, wisdom given a female personification, only with a much stronger sexual connection since she was a prostitute. Gnosticism was the main competitor to Christianity in ancient Rome. The Gnostics believed that the Christian Jehovah was not the real God but an evil creator of an evil world.

When the stream of light reaches the Sphere of Earth at your feet, begin to inhale slowly and pretend that the stream of light is moving up the right side of your body, back to the Sphere of Spirit.

Late one evening, Derek K. was in his study preparing for an exam and chatting with friends online, when something evil came to visit. The lights in the room started flickering, the temperature dropped, and he felt the presence of something unseen in the room with him. He panicked, and could feel the invisible entity begin to drawn near to him. Very quickly he left the room thinking, “this can’t be happening.” Upon entering the anteroom, he saw a transparent being looking directly at him. It began to move forward, and as it did the lights began to flicker and eventually went out. By now Derek was scared out of his wits, he went back into his study and located an incantation given to him by a friend. He read the incantation repeatedly, but could still feel the entity getting closer and closer. Then suddenly, it was gone.

Divining the future is something that occultists have done since the beginning of time, and is an essential part of the esoteric arts. In the pages of this powerful chapter, you’ll find traditional ways to look ahead in time and get an idea of what is going to happen by means of signs and omens, occult visions and other means. Here, too, is the secret of spirit contact. You’ll see how spirits communicate with us through dreams, visions and omens, and can see the future with their unseeing eyes. You’ll see how to build a spirit communication device for less than a dollar, and use it to get fast, precise information on forthcoming events. Spirit contact is perfectly safe, and you will never come to any harm using these arcane methods of communicating with the spirit world. Secrets of the Spirit World Spirits, of whom there are millions, reside in what is known as the astral world, an invisible sphere of existence that duplicates the physical world we live in. It is with the inhabitants of this unseen world that mediums make their contacts at seances. Until now, access to this unseen world was only possible with astral travel. This is the phenomenon of consciously projecting your ‘astral body’ from its physical counterpart. The astral body is an exact duplicate of the physical body. It regularly leaves the body during sleep although there is no memory or sensation of this when you awake. To consciously leave the physical body requires practice and understanding of basic occult laws. Once you are out of your body you are, in effect, invisible and the laws of physics no longer have meaning. There are many, many books on the market explaining the “how to” of astral travel, but if you have ever tried any of the many varied techniques to induce astral travel, you will know that it’s a very hard thing to do.

Does that surprise you? It shouldn’t, spirits surround us 24 hours a day. You need to become aware of the unseen forces that cluster around you.

Have you ever had an advance warning that something was about to happen in your life and then, later that day, found that you had an unusually good or unusually bad experience? Although you may not be aware of it at the time, you had received an omen – a direct message from the invisible inhabitants of the astral world. There is a way that you can spot these signs and omens and know what they mean. The signs and omens most people receive are simple everyday occurrences, but the act of noticing them is what makes them significant. The signs and omens that are noticed have a definite relation to the character of the events to come. The key here is you – what your normal reaction is. No one can tell you if anything you see is pleasant or unpleasant. Only you can decide. What this means to you is simply this: if you notice something out of the ordinary – a strange bird, a peculiar looking cloud, a door that suddenly jams, odd actions of a family pet, be prepared. Something unusual, either very good or very bad is going to happen to you in the near future. How One Man Used Visions to Receive $300"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" During the early spring of 1981, I conducted a series of occult experiments with arcane symbols to trigger trance-vision experiences. I can think of no better example of visions experienced by a student of the occult arts, than that of Barry M. Polish psychic and one time acquaintance of mine, who on October 2 1981, at 1:40 p.m. in the afternoon, placed himself into a transcendental state to receive visions of a future not yet born. A future that held the promise of easing the financial hardship he was experiencing at the time. Earlier that day, I had entertained Barry at my apartment. Over a cup of coffee the discussion turned to his problems. I bombarded him with questions about it and, in self-defense I suspect, he agreed to an experiment in trance-vision. The time was now 1:35 p.m., and as an aid to his concentration I darkened the room. Barry’s body became totally relaxed, and his breathing deepened. He described the visions as he experienced them, speaking slowly and carefully. His visions were vivid, and he was fully conscious of his physical environment. Barry would occasionally pause; these moments are indicated by three periods (...) in the text. Almost instantly he began to describe a small circular object moving through the time-field. The visions continued: “It has got a little chute underneath. It’s now producing a sort of shovel yet not a shovel but a telescopic-type thing coming out from the bottom of it similar to a u-junction. “It appears like water coming out of it in drops, or it could even be coins...I’m not sure. I’m watching it. It’s red in color. It’s dripping into some pool, something liquid. Whatever it’s going into, it’s a ring of sorts. It is dripping something like candle wax and it sets. Possibly melted gold, I don’t know. I’m trying to make sense of it. “Now the u-pipe is being drawn back into this little gadget, and there is a yellow light coming through, as if shining on this thing it’s spilt out. I see it change into a pair of hands. There seems to be a growth, or change of paper notes of some sort. Paper. A lot of paper A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"in this pair of hands in this yellow light. “I’m getting a lot of mumbo jumbo. I’m trying to sift through it. I take it a lot of interference. “A door opened and there’s a hell of a lot of multiple, glittering colors in this doorway. I am at the moment seeing what appears to be a volcano, or a dead volcano, surrounded by clouds. And a sort of cavity in the center of this mountain peak. Still looking for the key back here. “The volcano has not erupted, but sprang a leak, and something is pouring out of it and running down the side of the mountain. I’m following it through the clouds. That’s odd, I’m seeing a helicopter at the moment. “All I’m seeing are hands, at the moment. A lot of hands, as if a lot of people are trying to get a piece of this action.” Barry began to rub his hand back and forth across his forehead. “Across my forehead here,” he continued, “I feel a pressure. Has my face changed?” I told him that I could see a strange kind of psychic energy, similar to heat waves generated by asphalt highways, rising up from the floor in front of him. “I see what appears to be a knight on a horse bringing me something. That’s what you saw.” I had earlier in the day experienced a vision of my own, of a knight on horseback. “Someone just tipped a vase, or a container, and pieces of eight, gold coins spread everywhere.” Barry began to rub the thumb and forefinger of his right hand together. I asked him why he was doing that. “I’m feeling the coins, they’re real. The vase would have been about"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"two feet tall. I’m going to do something I’ve not done before. I’m going to put the coins back in the vase and I’m going to bring it back done here. “I am at the moment seeing a hole in the floor and right directly below it is Earth. I’m going to drop the money through there...and I’m going to hold on to it as it comes down. “I’m in a paddock. The money is here. I’m trying to find it. I’m looking around. There are mountains in the...in the distance. Not too far away from mountains...or the...ah...I don’t know...the Springwood Hills (NSW, Australia). The feeling here is Elizabeth Drive. On the backroads of Liverpool...no, Rooty Hill there used to be an army barracks. The only thing I’m getting, an ex army barracks. Along Elizabeth Drive there is, or used to be, an army barracks.” By 2:30 p.m. the visions had ceased. As Barry slowly opened his eyes to the familiar surroundings of the living room, he knew he’d had a unique psychic experience. Now we had to decide what it all meant – particularly what the vase was that had held the gold coins. As far as we knew it could all be the wildest fantasy, though it seemed unlikely. The visions had been too clear, too vivid. As we talked into the late afternoon, I suggested that a trip to the Elizabeth Drive area would either confirm or deny the validity of the visions. Barry agreed. We both felt a mixture of excitement and anticipation as we drove along the main road leading to the area seen in the visions. Leaving the densely populated areas behind us it was if we had driven into a rural landscape. Ahead the road disappeared into the horizon and to either side cows grazed peacefully in paddocks dotted with vegetable gardens and solitary houses. “Look,” said Barry, pointing to a tin can on the opposite side of the A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"road. “That’s what I saw. I’m sure of it.” I glanced out the window as we pulled over to the side of the road. I was not so sure. The container Barry had seen in his visions was at least two feet tall, and filled to the brim with gold coins, so if this was the right place, the visions had been more symbolic in nature than specific. I watched Barry walk across the road towards the old tin can. He picked it up, looked inside and threw it back down to the ground. I remained silent as he got back into the car. “That’s what I saw,” he said emphatically. I nodded. We sat quietly watching the occasional car speed past. Barry was confused. The psychic impression, fascinating as it was, was false. Or so it seemed. He found it difficult to believe that his psychic powers were beginning to fail him, not after all these years. A truck rumbled past, its raucous noise shattering the oppressive silence of the car, and a thought drifted into my mind. What if the visions represented an event in the immediate future, and not in the here and now? Barry was the first to speak. “Let’s go,” he said. “There’s nothing for us here, nothing at all.” As we drove back to my apartment, we arranged to meet again the following Tuesday. That would give the money three days to arrive, and enough time to prove the visions weren’t totally worthless. Barry arrived on the appointed day and at the appointed hour, and I wasted no time in asking if he had succeeded in locating the money source. He smiled, and told me how on the Saturday following the visions, he had received $300 from various people for instruction in the occult sciences. The visions had been vindicated. I never saw Barry again after that day, but I’ll always remember our strange adventure together in every detail."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" How to Make a Spirit Communication Device In contact with the invisible world, when precise information is desired you can turn to a scrying device. This device is a pendulum, and consists of any small object tied to one end of a piece of string. It is easy to set up a code of communication with any spirit by means of this device. Many stores that deal in occult supplies will sell you a pendulum, consisting of a small clear plastic ball on the end of a chain. Making such a device for your own use is a simple procedure, and you will get far better results if you make your own pendulum. It is a valid magical tradition that the tools that you make with your own hands are the ones that will bring the best results. All you need to do is to tie a piece of string about 12 inches long to a favorite ring or a button that you have worn many times, and your pendulum is made. You are now ready to begin. Between the Living and the Dead Sit at a table, rest your elbow comfortably and hold the string of your pendulum between your thumb and first finger, allowing your hand to hang limply from the wrist. Use the hand that you normally write with. Adjust the length of the string until the weight of the pendulum is an inch or so above the center of the table. Be sure to work on a firm table because an unsteady one may contribute a motion of its own and deceive you into misinterpreting the information you receive. When everything is set, hold your hands still until the pendulum has stopped swinging.

If it does not respond put it away and try again later, when you are more relaxed. Some people wonder how anything so simple as this can work. These are the people who have never tried it. Some, however, try it and do not get results. Usually their inbuilt skepticism, doubt or tension foils their effort. But when these conditions are absent success is almost always instant and automatic. Getting Answers from Your Pendulum Once you receive a positive answer, you can proceed to set up an actual code of communication. To do so, hold the pendulum perfectly still, and say: “Will this spirit please select a motion of the pendulum that is to mean ‘Yes.’” The pendulum should move in one of four directions. Follow the same procedure for “No,” “I don’t know,” and “I don’t want to answer that question.” There are only four directions in which this pendulum can move. By moving the pendulum, a spirit will show you which direction means “Yes,” which direction means “No,” which means “I don’t know,” and which means, “I don’t want to answer that question.” At this point, you may ask the spirit any question you desire. Ask only one question at a time and each time wait for an answer. Needless to say, it should be phrased for a simple “Yes” or “No” answer."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" How to Ensure the Spirit Force Will Not Lead You Astray Occasionally you may suspect that some spirit of malicious intent is controlling your pendulum because the answers seem to be gibberish. At such a time it is well to carry out the Cabalistic Cross Ritual as described in Chapter 5. Then, as you sit assured that all is good and positive around you, ask that a new spirit step forward; then ask it questions to which you do not know the answer. Check the answers later and judge the validity of the communicating entity from how well it has responded to you. Advanced Pendulum Work Once you are expert at receiving “Yes” and “No” answers, you can proceed to a more precise method that will spell out specific answers to your questions. Arrange the 26 letters of the alphabet in a semi- circle on your usual scrying table, and the words “Yes” and “No,” as on a ouija board. The Ouija board was very popular in the twenties, and many people made their own ouija boards simply by writing all the letters of the alphabet across a flat surface, and under this all the numbers from one to nine. Together with the words “Yes” and “No,” as on a real Ouija board. Any smooth object that could slide around was used to spell out messages, such as a wineglass. Some of my earliest childhood memories are of Sunday afternoon Ouija board sessions with family members, the kitchen table acting as a makeshift talking board. A lot of what came through was, on reflection, gibberish. Of course it was gibberish, 90% of spirits contacted in this manner are mischievous by nature and delight in leading us astray. It takes patience to make sense of what comes through, to sift the grains of gold from the sands of nonsense. Now by holding the instrument over the chart, you can divine precise answers to your questions. As an example, let us. Using your magical A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"divining instrument, ask first, then ask, in this manner you can pinpoint the dog’s location. As you become more adept, you may even ask for a house number. These early contacts between you and the spirit force are important. Keep your first contact with the spirit world fairly brief. Your obsession with it can be the real danger. If you succeed in contacting the same spirit a number of times, the spirit will become ‘familiar’, sense your needs, take instruction readily, and help to bring your wishes into the here and now. A Secret Code of Communication Dreams, intuitions and hunches, visions and thoughts that will be sent to you from the depths of the Astral World during your Spells and Rituals will show you the future with great accuracy but, like Barry, at times you will doubt the impressions of your mind. Until you are perfectly sure and confident of the messages the invisible inhabitants of the next dimension send to you, you can employ a powerful occult tool that will give visible evidence of the future, and reveal its secrets to you. The occult arts offers many unique tools that can be used to get in touch with the future, but none is more accurate than the secret code of communication concealed in an ordinary set of dice. Your Psychic Legacy from the Past Divining the future with dice is done by a mere handful of people. Millions of others look upon dice as merely familiar components of most board games, yet their history is very much involved with divination. The use of dice as a fortune telling tool was widespread and far-reaching. The Ancient Egyptians, Romans, Greeks and Arabs have all, at one time or another employed dice of various shapes,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"markings and materials for divination. The earliest known examples were made from astragali – small, uneven, four-sided bones found within the joints of hoofed animals such as sheep and goats. Dice are perhaps the only method of divination that the Bible does not frown upon, and are referred to by their other name of ‘lots’. In the words of St Thomas, ‘If there is need, it is lawful with all due reverence to seek judgement of God by lots.’ Dice have remained unchanged over the centuries since the arrangement of the dots we still use today was developed around 1,400 BC. And it is the secret arrangement of the dots upon the dice that allows you to see what fate has in store for you. The Ritual of Yog-Sothoth You need three dice to foretell the future. The three dice can be purchased from any toy store. The material that they are constructed of makes no difference in fortune telling power. To charge your dice with prophetic power, take them into your personal witching circle on a day when you are feeling particularly good. Place the dice upon a small table at the center of your circle, and begin stirring them with your right hand. The stirring motion should always be sunwise, or clockwise. Continue stirring for approximately two minutes. The remainder of the ritual is very important, and it is absolutely essential that it be followed exactly in the manner that I will reveal to you. After the dice have been stirred thoroughly, pick up one of the dice with your right hand. Hold it in the palm of your hand, and speak these words: I invoke thee, Yog-Sothoth, Guardian of the Mysteries, to hear and accept this offering. I hold in my hand the instrument through which A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"thy power, virtue and authority shall manifest. It will forever reveal the truth of what shall come to pass in future times. So mote it be. Recite this invocation with each dice, placing them in a neat stack on your left. When the ritual has been completed, you have made a very definite contact with the Astral World. Your dice are ready to spell out exactly what the future holds in their unique, prophetic code. Your dice need no special care, but they should be reserved for divining purposes only. They should never be used for the playing of any board game if they are to be used for divining. How to Use Your Dice to Foretell the Future This method is for short-term forecasts and the results achieved are basic and uncomplicated. The three dice should be cast into a circle measuring approximately 7 inches in diameter drawn on a piece of paper. The spots on the uppermost faces of the dice, which have fallen within the circle, should now be totaled and the following interpretations apply. A total of one or two mean the dice have nothing to say at the present. Three...signifies a very happy surprise. Four...an unpleasant letter will be received. Five...a new friendship will be formed. Six...a friend will ask a favor of you. Seven...foretells a new romance."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Eight...a gift of clothing will be received. Nine...a gambling win Ten...a legal action in which you will become involved. Eleven...denotes a journey to a place of entertainment. Twelve...a large sum of money will be received. Thirteen...a period of unhappiness is foretold. Fourteen...signifies a new love. Fifteen...a warning of approaching troubles. Sixteen...denotes a sudden, pleasant journey. Seventeen...signifies an involvement with persons at, or from a distance. Eighteen...foretells a great rise in life. On average, the predicted events will come to pass within seven days of the dice being cast. Some, however, will occur almost instantaneously, while others may take a little longer.

You are on the threshold of working genuine magic for yourself to bring money, love, power, success, happiness and contentment. You will find the Secret Names of 72 different spirits on the following pages. These are the spirits of the Lemegeton. One essential occult belief is that if you know the real name of a spirit you have control over it. Pronounce the names exactly as I have written them. If you stumble over a name the first few times, don’t worry, but practice it until you can say it clearly Treat these Names with care. They are ultimately powerful, and should be respected. Keep them secret from people who do not know about the magic power of the occult. The word ‘spirit’, which is derived from the Latin spiritus, refers to any disembodied entity, devil, demon or angel; invoked, coerced or otherwise called forth by the magician through the application of those things which are harmonious with it and reflect certain parts of its nature. And if all is propitious assume an aerial body, be visible to sight and reply to questions. The difference between those spirits willing to help you and those that won’t, is invariably fear. If spirit invocation is to work, you must do it without any mental reservations. As you begin to use this Power in your daily life, it will seem as if you are dreaming a strange dream.

Wins $1,000 With the Magic of Goetia Some cases of fantastic success have been reported from people using the Powers of Goetia to work magic. I can say this truthfully because I have first hand knowledge of what I write. We will take the case of Adam F., a young man of my acquaintance. He scored a handsome windfall after I told him about the Goetia. One weekend he visited a large casino to try his luck at roulette. He found a place at the table and, with a few low denomination chips, placed his bets and watched the roll of the little ball. He let the magic of Goetia work for him, silently and effectively. The spins of the wheel he was going to bet on were the ones that “felt right.” He placed his bets and, much to his amazement, won over $1,000. The magic of Goetia worked for Adam, as it will for you.

You may choose to burn a single black candle, inscribed with the Name and Power of the Spirit. Loosen any tight clothing, and remove any footwear that you may be wearing. Sit and relax your body in a comfortable chair with your back supported. If you are using your witching circle, stand at its center and face North. Take the phone off the hook to avoid any sudden interruption, and switch off the television. You are now ready to begin. Close your eyes for a few minutes and think only of your desire, and how the Ritual will help you to receive it. You are now ready to begin the conjuration. Light the candle and offer a short prayer to the Dark Spirit. Thank him for all his help to others in days gone by. Thank him for being with you on this day and at this hour, and ask him for his kindness and favor at this Ritual. Once the prayer has been spoken, you will need to see through and past the everyday world. Do not peer anxiously, let the stare become vacant. You will then experience a feeling of a “clearing mist” followed by a feeling akin to excitement as the dark spirit manifests. The spirit has no power to harm or influence you. The spirit can not influence you to do anything, you would not do of your own free will. At this point take a mind journey, and show the spirit in pictures what must be accomplished. You may also use words and gestures if you wish. You must get involved. Once the ritual intention has been completed, thank the dark spirit for its help and bid it farewell. Very quickly, leave the room, closing the door behind you. Do not enter the room for three hours, your ability to stay outside is proof that you are in control.
