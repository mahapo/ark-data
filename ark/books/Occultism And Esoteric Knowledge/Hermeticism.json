Today, magick is cons idered by many to be an art and not a science. Perhaps the word \"scie nce\" scares people and makes them think that the \"mystery\" of magick w ill be taken away if scientific principle is applied. And yet, e verything in the physical plane operates in accordance with some \"la w\" or method. For instance, if we throw a ball up in the air it will come down because of the force of gravity. Magick also follows a series of rules in how it operates. These rules are referred to by some as He rmetic Philosophy and are part of the Hermetic Teachings. Hermetic Philosophy is discussed in detail in \"The Kybalion: Hermetic Philosophy\" by Three Initiates. This book was written in 1912 and published initially by the Yogi Publicatio n Society, Masonic Temple, Chicago IL. The book is still available, bu t usually must be ordered. A word of warning: the book was written in the flowery style common at the turn of the century. It can sometimes be easy to get lost in the language, or to fall prey to the idea t hat \"most of you are not worthy or ready for this information.\" Just kee p your attention focused on the real message—the sharing of knowledge ."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The roots of Hermetic Philosophy lie within ancient Egypt. The ideas were passed to mankind through the \"Master of Maste rs,\" who dwelt in Egypt from the earliest days. His name was Herme s Trismegistus, the father of Occult Wisdom, the founder of Astrolo gy, and the discoverer of Alchemy. The title \"Trismegistus\" mea ns \"thrice great.\" Some believe that the Egyptians deified Hermes and made him one of their gods, Thoth. Many years later, he was adopted by the Greeks and known as Hermes, Messenger (or Scribe) of the Gods. The teachings of Hermes Trismegistus were reserved for a select few who had proven themselves worthy to seek the knowle dge. Those who did learn the knowledge were sworn to secrecy. In those days, most people were believed to be incapable of learni ng. \"Do not cast pearls before swine. Give milk to the babes, but gi ve meat to the strong men.\" Throughout history, this belief has be en held by many organizations. I personally believe that at the tim e of Hermes it was true. Humans as a species are still in an early sta ge of evolution. At any one time there are always a few humans who are more advanced than others, but for the most part the majority of the populace is just beginning the journey to find knowledge. However, i n the past 8,000 years, mankind as a whole has grown, and there are more people who are beginning to become ready for this information. The teachings of Hermetic Philosophy are really par t of Hermetic Alchemy. Alchemy is the mastery of mental forces ra ther than material elements. It deals with the transmutation of mental vibrations into others, as opposed to the classic idea of chan ging lead into gold. The common belief is really allegory, shadowing the truth in symbols to hide the knowledge from those who are not yet re ady, and to preserve it from those who would destroy it. The Principles of Hermetic Philosophy This system not only describes how the universe ope rates, but it also describes the fundamental principles that govern th e operation of magick—it is the \"physics\" of magick. There are seve n principles that form the core of the system: \u0001 The Principle of Mentalism \u0001 The Principle of Correspondence"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\u0001 The Principle of Vibration \u0001 The Principle of Polarity \u0001 The Principle of Rhythm \u0001 The Principle of Cause and Effect \u0001 The Principle of Gender The Principle of Mentalism begins with the belief that everything is mental. \"We are but a thought in the mind of the AL L.\" The ALL is everything that was, is and will be, and at the sam e time it is nothing. At the highest level, there is the underlying creat ive force of the universe. This force cannot be described in human t erms and cannot be truly understood by humans. The ALL is everythin g and everything is part of the ALL. In magick, nothing can occur without first occurring as a thought; once the thought occu rs, the rest follows. The Principle of Correspondence says that there is always a correspondence between the laws of the various plan es of existence. The phrase, \"As above so below; as below so above\" is an application of this principle. Since everything is mental, and everything is part of the ALL, then everything is interconnected. Therefo re, the higher planes of existence have correspondences to the low er planes of existence. We are microcosms of the universe, and t he universe is a macrocosm within which we are contained. This idea is one of the most influential of all the principles. This principle allows us to influence the higher planes and shows how the highe r planes influence us. The Principle of Vibration states that \"everything is in constant motion.\" Everything is constantly changing, growing , moving, in a state of flux. Let us examine our physical existenc e for a moment. All matter is composed of smaller particles, atoms. At one time we thought that the atom was the smallest unit of matt er. Atoms are always in motion. As such, we are constantly in mot ion on some level, even when we appear to be at rest. In this century, we have discovered that the atom is comprised of smaller building bloc ks called protons, neutrons, and electrons. We have recently proven th at there are even smaller particles such as quarks, leptons, muons, a nd many others. Until the turn of the century (1900s), the general thought was that"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"objects were solid and did not move. Note that the Principle of Vibration, which has been around for thousands of y ears, states otherwise. Science is just now catching up with wha t magick has known for a very long time. If we look at matter, w e see that it is composed of energy. Energy is simply a force moving at a certain rate of vibration. Take, for instance, light: light that we can see—the visible spectrum—appears in the colors we know as re d, orange, yellow, blue, green, indigo, and violet. All the co lors are actually comprised of the same discrete units of energy (pho tons), but they vibrate at different rates. The different rates of vibration cause us to see the different colors. The Principle of Vibration allows us to see how to transform or transmute energy states. The Principle of Polarity contains the idea that \"everything is dualistic in nature.\" Another way to say this is th at everything has its opposite. An easy illustration of this is heat and cold. Heat and cold are both descriptions of temperature (a measure of amount of energy contained by an object), but where does one draw th e line between hot and cold? The human body cannot tell the difference between extremes of heat and cold. For example, if you have a wart removed with liquid nitrogen, the spot will first feel cool and then will feel as if someone is burning you with a match or flame. Heat and cold are merely degrees, differing only in the rate of vibra tion. We see polarity all around us and refer to it every day: light and dark, hard and soft, large and small, loud and quiet, black and white, p ositive and negative. These are all common manifestations of po larity. All these pairs are related and differ only by degree. This p rinciple is very important to the concept of mental transmutation. If we wish to change something from negative to positive, then we must r ecognize that negative and positive are the same thing, but vibra ting at different rates. Once this is realized, then all that must be done is to raise the vibrational rate of the negative. Mental transmutat ion will be discussed in more detail later in this lesson. The Principle of Rhythm states that everything moves in cycles. \"Everything flows out and in; everything has tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum swing manifests in everything; t he measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to t he left; rhythm compensates.\"— The Kybalion . We cannot cause a principle or law not to work, but it can be neutralized. The Mental Law of Neutralization allows one to see the swing or rhythm, to locate a point in the swing at"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"which they wish to be, and then to move themselves to it, thus nullifying the effect of the swing. The Principle of Cause and Effect states that \"there is a cause for every effect.\" If a ball rolls down a hill (effect) , then there must have been some cause (something moved it) to precipitate the rolling down the hill. In science, this is known as the Newton's First Law of Motion: \"an object at rest tends to stay at rest un less acted upon by an external force, and an object in motion tends to re main in motion unless acted upon by an external force.\" The law of cause and effect applies to both physical and non-physical manifesta tions. This principle, in part, incorporates the idea that YOU are responsible for your actions. YOU have the power to change the cour se of your life— it is YOUR ultimate decision to take any action. Th e power of this principle can be seen in everyday life, especially in interpersonal relationships. If someone yells at you, what is you r honest and immediate reaction? For most people, it is to respo nd in kind. Now, it is up to you to decide if you wish to take that act ion (yelling back). If a person smiles at you what is your initial reactio n? Usually it is to smile back. These are simple examples of this princ iple at work. For everything that happens, something had to cause tha t event to occur. The Principle of Gender states that there is gender in everything. On the physical plane, gender manifests as sex. On the higher planes, gender refers to the duality, the polarity of activ e and passive forces, the Yin and the Yang, the Male and the Female. Ever y individual contains both aspects of male and female, Yin and Y ang. Sexually, all humans start out as females; it is not until the th ird week of gestation that the fetus begins to take on either male or fem ale aspects. This illustrates that both aspects of Being are present within everyone. The principle of Gender works in the direction of gener ation, regeneration, and creation. Without this principle there can be no creation. Hopefully, by this point you are already beginning to see application of these principles on many levels. The highest app lication of these ideas is in Mental Transmutation. Transmutation is the process of changing one thing into another. Mental Transmutati on is the art of changing and transforming mental states, forms, and conditions into others. The key to mental transmutation is that everything is mental . Since everything is mental, we can effect change by applying mental"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"force—if our force (Will and energy) is strong enoug h, we can effect the change we want to make. Mental transmutation ta kes place on the mental plane, thereby causing change to occur on th e physical plane (remember the Principle of Correspondence). Only th e most advanced masters can manifest large-scale change, in the gro ssest sense, on the physical plane. Even then, there are limits to what can be accomplished in physical incarnations. Before going further, I wish to switch tracks for a moment and discuss a little of what is and is not possible. Many peopl e like to spout the idea that \"everything is possible.\" Well, everythin g is possible, depending on your level of ability and spiritual ma turity. When we develop to the point where we rejoin the ALL or the TAO or the \"universe,\" then all things will be possible. However, we are not yet there. We operate on the physical plane, the lower astral planes, and the lower mental planes. Everything is energy. To transform energy, we must be able to \"grasp\" and shape the energy. Th e physical body, much like a piece of copper wire, can handle only a limited amount of energy. If you have ever looked inside a light bulb while it is off, you will see two posts with a small piece of coiled wir e inside. When electricity is applied, the small coil of metal beg ins to glow, because it is resisting the flow of energy. If too much energy is applied, then the coil will become too hot and explode or melt. To some degree, the same process occurs within peop le, because the physical body is subject to physical laws. One of t hese is that there is a limit to what can be contained or channeled. Anot her way to see this is to look at the human body as the small end of th e funnel. What happens when you attempt to pour a gallon of water into a funnel? Well, if you pour too much, it overflows—the small end cannot handle the physical volume of water. The use of energy is also governed by mental and sp iritual maturity. Remember the first two hermetic principles: Mentali sm and Correspondence. How many of us can truly control ou r thoughts? If the body could manipulate unlimited power, then we could manifest anything that our minds could create. For those of you who watch science fiction, cast your mind back to the movie \" Forbidden Planet,\" or remember the \"Alice in Wonderland\" episode of or iginal \"Star Trek,\" or the episode of \"Star Trek: The Next Gener ation\" where The Traveler appeared. In each of these shows, mankind was given the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ability to create anything that he/she could imagin e. At our stage of development, mankind could easily destroy the fabri c of creation if we were able to wield limitless energy. Still don't believe me? As an experiment, picture an apple in as much detail as y ou can. See the round shape, the stem, a few leaves on the stem; se e the shading on the apple, its texture, the shading on the stem, an d the textures of the stem; see the veins in the leaves. Now, see the ent ire apple in all its detail. Hold the image in your mind. Think of nothi ng but the apple. Hold the image in your mind for five seconds. Try i t for 10 seconds. Hold it for a minute. Ten minutes. Hold the image f or an hour, five hours, a whole day. Continue to hold the image unti l you can no longer hold it. Be honest: could you see the apple? How long did you manage to hold the image before it changed or befor e other thoughts intruded on what you were seeing? If you cannot mai ntain perfect control of your mind for even a limited time period , then what would happen if you could create anything in your mind? I magine your worst nightmare being made manifest. Now, image the worst nightmares of an entire planet being made manifest on the physical. Just because we do not have access or control over limitless energy does not mean that we cannot effect change on a sma ller, more personal scale. Our ability to effect change is lim ited to the amount of energy we can manipulate and the strength of our wi lls. There is an upper limit to what the human body can handle, but very few people operate anywhere near that level. The ability to ma nipulate energy is tied to the energy channels and system of the body (the chakras are part of this system and will be discussed in a late r lesson). These channels are like muscles and must be \"exercised\" i n order to increase the amount of energy they can handle. The more an i ndividual works with energy, the more energy he/she will be able to manipulate it, and the longer he/she will be able to manipulate it wit hout tiring. With enough dedication and exercise, you can reach your physical limitation, but it does not happen overnight, just as lifting weights for a week will not allow you to lift a car over your h ead. Magick takes practice and work. In short, you have to train for it. The Planes of Existence (Matter and Energy) So far, we have spoken only with regard to the phys ical planes. To some extent, the limitations are lessened on the as tral and mental planes, but there are still limitations. This is du e partly to the spiritual maturity level and partly to the chakra systems. (T he chakras exist on"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"more than one plane.) In short, if you are reading this, then you are not at the level needed to manifest excessive chang e on a global scale. (And, no, neither am I. However, one \"day\" I will b e able to this; eventually everyone will be able to do it.) Let us look at how Hermetic Philosophy perceives th e \"planes of existence.\" This term is a bit misleading, since al l planes simultaneously exist and overlap. To some extent, i t is like a building with three major sections. Each section occupies mu ltiple floors. Again, this is a separation that exists only in the human mind for the sake of clarity. The planes are really groupings of degree (or vibration) within the manifestation of \"like.\" Each of the major planes is divided into seven minor planes. Each of the min or planes is divided into seven sub-planes. The major planes of existence are: The Physical Plane The Physical Plane is comprised of matter and is the realm of physical existence. The Mental Plane The Mental Plane is the real of th ought and consciousness. The Spiritual Plane The Spiritual Plane is the real m of deity and The ALL. The physical plane is divided into seven minor plan es: The Plane of Matter (A) The Plane of Matter (A) is comprised of the grossest forms of matter such as solids, liquids an d gasses. The Plane of Matter (B) The Plane of Matter (B) is composed of the more subtle forms of matter such as the radiant matter (radium, etc). The Plane of Matter (C) The Plane of Matter (C) is composed of the finest forms of physical matter. The Plane of Ethereal Substance The Plane of Ether eal Substance is composed of the \"ether,\" the unifying element of the universe. The ether connects the grosser forms of matter and energy. The Plane of Energy (A) The Plane of Energy (A) is composed of the gross forms of energy such as light, sound, heat, electricity, gravitation, cohesive force, etc. The Plane of Energy (B) The Plane of Energy (B) is comprised of the more complex energy forms such as plasmas. The Plane of Energy (C) The Plane of Energy (C) is comprised of the energy of the \"gods.\" This form of energy is accessible only to those operating exclusively on the spiritual planes. It is the stuff of creation. And it, too, is comprised of seven sub-planes."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Mental Plane comprises the forms of living thin gs, or life as we understand it, and is divided into seven minor plan es: The Plane of the Mineral Mind The Plane of The Mine ral Mind comprises the states of units or entities that animate the forms of minerals. The Plane of the Elemental Mind (A) The Plane of Th e Elemental Mind (A) is the realm of the lower level elemental forces of nature. The Plane of the Plant Mind The Plane of The Plant Mind is the realm of the plant kingdom and plant consciousness. The Plane of the Elemental Mind (B) The Plane of T he Elemental Mind (B) is comprised of the higher elemental forces or entities such as gnomes, sylphs, salamanders, and undines—those who control the lower level elementals. The Plane of the Animal Mind The Plane of The Anim al Mind is comprised of the animal level consciousness. The Plane of the Elemental Mind (C) The Plane of Th e Elemental Mind (C) is the realm of the more evolved elemental entities. The Plane of the Human mind The Plane of The Human Mind is comprised of the manifestations of life and existence. The Spiritual Plane is composed of those entities t hat exist in spiritual form (non-corporeal). This is the plane of the asce nded beings and of deity. This is the realm of angels and guides, arch angels, demigods, and other such entities. This plane is so far remov ed from ours that it is difficult to say much about the seven sub-planes . Until we reach a further stage of development, it is useless even to attempt to speculate about a plane populated by beings who are at a leve l of existence as far advanced over ours as we are over that of the c ommon amoeba. The last paragraph is paraphrased from The Kybalion . We must remember that this information was imparted a very long time ago and has been handed down for centuries. The book itself was put together at the beginning of the 20th century. Since that ti me, I believe that there have been great strides made in understanding a little more of \"that which is not knowable.\" I would, therefore, s uggest the following division of the Plane of Spirit: Plane of Spirit Guides (A) The Spiritual Plane is a plane of development, just as are the Physical and Mental Planes. The eventual goal is a return to the ALL, a return to TAO, to become \"one\" with everything. Before we can achieve that state, we must first experience \"everything.\" Part of the experience must include helping and guiding others along the spiritual path . This is something done at all levels of existence, but at some point in our spiritual evolution we transcend the need for physical form and exist as"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"pure spirit or essence. Accordingly, I would propose that the first spiritual plane is that of t he spirit guide. The spirit guides are those entities that have just begun their existence in the spiritual form. They are able to help and protect physical beings and impart some of their knowledge. This existence allows them to understand better how the spiritual level interacts with the physical. Plane of Guardian Spirits and Angels: Cherubim (A) The second level of the spiritual plane would be inhabited by the guardian spirits and/or the lesser angels, the Cherubim. These entities are more advanced than the spirit guide and are allowed more interaction with the physical. Plane of Spirit Guides (B) The third plane of spiri tual existence would be reserved for the second level spirit guides. This level of guide has become used to the spiritual level, has integrated more information, and normally interacts with those on the physical plane who are closer to transcending physical existence. Plane of Guardian Spirits and Angels: Seraphim (B) The fourth plane would be the home of the second level guardian spirit and/or Seraphim. These enlightened souls are able to interact on the physical plane to a higher degree than the others and usually are more concerned with those just crossing over or those who have just crossed over to spiritual existence (even spiritual entities wil l need help from time to time). Plane of Archangels The fifth level of spiritual ex istence would be the level of archangels, those entities who are just about to rejoin with the ALL or TAO. Plane of Demigods The sixth level of spiritual exis tence is that of the demigod, those who are on the verge of transcending spiritual individuality and rejoining with the ALL or the TAO. TAO, ALL The last level of spiritual existence is t he TAO or the ALL. Let me stress that these are best guesses on my part. Further, I am using several terms familiar to humans to provide s ome point of reference. Since many people do have some backgroun d in Christianity or Catholicism, I chose to use the ter ms Cherubim and Seraphim as a level reference only. Whether there a re actually entities classified as this is better left to other discussi ons. Further, I am not positive about the fifth and sixth levels, for they very well could be reversed. However, I do believe that, in time, as w e are more ready to understand, these levels will be revealed in more d etail. At this point, we move into a discussion of the are a of Mental Transmutation. The idea of transmutation is to chan ge one form of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"energy into another (after all, \"everything is ener gy\"). The theory of mental transmutation is simple: use a higher princi ple to overcome the effects of a lower principle. While the idea is sim ple, it could not (and cannot) be fully explored until the seven principle s are understood. \"To change your mood or mental state, change your v ibration.\"— The Kybalion Everything is mental. Everything is energy. Everyth ing vibrates. YOU are the master of your own mood and mental state. Another person may do something that angers you, but they do NOT f orce you to lose your temper—YOU lose control of your temper because of YOUR reaction to something they said or did. The baser n egative emotions (hate, envy, jealousy) are all states of low-vibrat ing energy. To change your mood, raise your mental vibrational level. \"To destroy an undesirable rate of mental vibration , put into operation the Principle of Polarity and concentrate upon the opposite pole to that which you desire to suppress. Kill out the undesira ble by changing its polarity.\"— The Kybalion Polarity is in everything; everything has its oppos ite. Love and hate are the same thing vibrating at different ends of t he spectrum. Happiness and sorrow are the same, but vibrating at different rates. To counter something, use its opposite. From chemistry , we know that if we mix bases and acids in equal strengths, they wil l cancel each other out to form a neutral substance. To see this in eve ryday life, try being very positive and cheerful around someone who is in a bad mood. The bad mood cannot survive for long when confronted by a positive mood. It is also possible use a bad mood to cancel a positive mood. Watch the people around you. Someone will come into the office in a bad mood and snap at someone; later on, that person will be short with another, etc. The chain goes on and on. Polarity and vibration are key elements to mental transmutation. \"Rhythm may be neutralized by the application of th e Art of Polarization.\"— The Kybalion Everything is in constant motion, and there is a rh ythm to the motion. The swing of the pendulum to the left is equal to t he swing of the pendulum to the right. To avoid being caught in an undesirable swing, we use polarity or vibration to move ourselves abov e or below the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"oncoming swing, thereby moving ourselves outside of the effect. The higher Hermetic Master will polarize or move him/he rself to the very positive side of the \"I AM\" pole and vibrate to a r ate at which the backwards swing of the pendulum will not affect him /her. This is done to some extent by all who understand this prin ciple. They simply refuse to be swayed by the reverse swing. \"Nothing escapes the Principle of Cause and Effect, but there are many planes of Causation and one may use the laws o f a higher to overcome the laws of a lower.\"— The Kybalion For every cause there is an effect, and for every e ffect there is a cause. For every event there must be some initial action, and there is some reaction for every event. For an idea to manif est on the physical plane, it must first exist as thought; then it must take form on the mental plane and eventually be made manifest back o n the physical plane. There are many planes on which we operate. T he principle of causation exists on all planes. Just as one plane m ay influence another, causation on one plane may influence other planes. \"True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art.\"— The Kybalion Everything is mental; we are but a thought in the m ind of the ALL. Influencing the physical and mental planes are brou ght about by control of your mental power and abilities in confo rmity of the laws of existence. \"The ALL is MIND. The Universe is Mental.\"— The Kybalion Magickal Ethics Before delving further into the principles and idea s of magick, it is critical to begin our exploration of the subject of magickal ethics. The foundation of this discussion will be that YOU are responsible for YOUR actions. Everything that you do has influence or effect on something else. Magickal ethics follow the same principles as physi cal and mental ethics. Ethics can be broken into three broad categ ories: • Ethical Objectivism holds that there are moral and ethical absolutes that can be known. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"• Ethical Relativism holds that the ethics of a situa tion depend on the situation, the time, and the culture in which t he event occurs. • There is a third system that combines the two belie fs, saying that there are some fundamental ethical truths, but that they must be applied in consideration to the situation i n which the event occurs. Magickal Ethics is based on standard ethics. Magick is an ability that everyone possesses; everyone has the potential to use it, but few rarely learn to use it. You must consider magick to be another skill, like martial arts or cooking, that can be developed by any individual. Many ethical situations will resolve themselves to the question of, \"Would I want someone to take this action without m y permission?\" and \"What actions would I consider appropriate for someone to take on my behalf?\" We must be cautious of attempting to rationalize ou r actions by claiming that we would really want someo ne to do something for us if we were in a situation. Let’s look at a few examples of magickal ethics and \"regular\" ethics. Magickal: Can I cast a spell to make John Smith want to sleep with me? Can I cast a spell to make John Smith fall in love with me? These questions are often rationalized by the follo wing types of ideas: But I just \"know\" that we are soul-mates. But I just \"know\" that if he realized his true feel ings he would want this. But I just \"know\" that I could make him the happies t person in the world if he would let me. And the list goes on! Physical: Can I physically force John Smith to have sex with me?"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Can I coerce John Smith to have sex with me? Could I put something in John Smith’s drink so that I could have sex with him? These situations are clear-cut examples of an actio n that will cause harm to another individual. Magickal: Can I ask someone to attack me magickally? This could be a useful learning tool if the people know what they are doing. Physical: Can I ask a friend to spar with me in some contact sport? Notice that this situation involves mutual consent between two individuals . Mutual consent changes the ethical picture. While it is possible that bad things can happen as a result of the actions, both participants understand the risk before the actions are begun . There appears to be a conflict with the basic Wicca n belief of, \"An it harm none, do as you will.\" The actions could resul t in harm being doing to one or more people by the action ; the important thing to remember here is that it is a risk that is mutually agreed upon . In this type of situation, I believe that the concept of mu tual consent should be applied. I also believe that this idea should be applied in situations involving pain as part of the sexual act—if the acti on is mutually agreed upon by both parties, then the basic belief is not violated. Many forms of magick work on influencing other peop le. Magickal: Can I put up a ward or shield around my property to deter thieves? Physical: Can I put up signs that say, \"Thieves keep out!\" Depending on the construction of the ward or shield , a certain idea can be projected to those crossing the boundary. Th is idea does"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"influence another individual. This becomes a two-fo ld question: \"Would you want someone to try to influence you?\" a nd \"Since the individual has made a conscious choice to interfere with my free will, then am I allowed to try to keep him from taking an action?\" Magickal: Can I put up a ward or shield around my property to cause a thief’s heart to stop when he crosses intending to steal my property? Physical: Can I shoot someone who is stealing my property? Most people will agree that they should have the ri ght to defend themselves and their property. However, the taking of a life in any situation will have Karmic repercussions that must be faced—even in the instance of self-preservation. Is a piece of pr operty really worth the taking of a life? A similar issue is whether yo u could incorporate a \"death action\" into a ward to be triggered on the o ccurrence of an event such as someone’s breaking into your house to kill you. How far will you go, and where will you draw the lines? Magickal: Can I work a spell to raise the awareness of a pers on or group of people regarding a specific subject? Physical: Can I force someone to accept an idea with which th ey do not agree, even if the idea is considered \"wrong\" by society? Every individual must develop at his/her own rate. The spiritual development cannot be rushed or pushed forward. Whi le the idea of raising someone’s awareness may be appealing, would you want someone to force awareness on you? Notice that the issue is really one of consent. Magickal: Can I work a spell to raise the awareness of a pers on or group of people regarding a specific subject, provided that they are willing? Physical:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Can I talk to someone on the street who agrees to t he discussion, or to someone who asks me about a specific topic? Notice that the situation has changed such that the other individual now has the choice to be made aware of a situation. Many situations in magick involve consent and free will. In most situations, magick should not be worked on or for a person without his/her express permission. Also remember that permission for one action does not imply permission for anothe r . Permission usually must come from the individual. There are, h owever, exceptions. Before the age of consent, children usu ally may not give permission for magickal actions, since they may not understand the ramifications of what they desire. In the instance of working on or for children, permission from the parent or guardian is usually required. The same holds true for those who are mentally inco mpetent or those who cannot communicate for themselves. In a perfect world, we would have the time to obtai n permission before doing any work for others. However, this is not always the case. There are instances where time is of the esse nce, and there is not time to obtain formal permission. Magickal: Can I use my healing abilities to keep someone who has been struck by a car alive until emergency medical teams arrive ? Physical: Can I use my knowledge of how to stop bleeding to k eep someone who has been struck by a car alive until emergency medical teams arrive? In these cases, it may be impossible to obtain perm ission. Some would advocate doing nothing, since, if you take no actio n, then there would not be any repercussions. Are there repercussions f or not taking action to prevent something when you could? That is a good question, and one that is not easily answered.

Most people would like to believe that \"untimely\" d eath couldn’t happen for a specific reason. This is incorrect. Be fore a soul incarnates, the major life tasks are decided upon a nd set in motion. This does not say that everything is predestined, b ut there are some events that can be prearranged. One of these is \"un timely\" death. Death itself is a critical experience in the soul’s development. The question remains, then, do you take action to s ave the individual? In these situations, we do not have the luxury of c onsulting the Akashic records to see if this event was supposed t o happen . If an event was predetermined, there is no way to change the event. If the person was meant to die in the accident, then they will die. Just as \"untimely\" death is a possibility, living through a near-death experience is also a possibility. Before taking any action, especially magickal, you should consider the ramifications of those actions. Also, you must be prepared to accept responsibility for your actions, or your lac k of actions. Many situations where the ethics of an action is questio ned come about because one or more of the individuals involved doe s not want to take responsibility for their actions. The following ideas can help resolve ethical proble ms: • Always take responsibility for your actions. • Always consider the consequences of your actions. • Always consider the options available to you (if th ere is time). • Always remember that every individual has free will . • Always remember that you should try not to harm oth ers."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"• Always remember that every cause has an effect and that every effect has a cause.

THE CORPUS HERMETICA By Secretum Secretorum © The Corpus Hermeticum is a collection of texts from the second and third centuries of our era that survived from a more exte nsive literature. Reflecting the generalized spiritual orientation of late Hellenistic gnosis rather than a tradition in any organized sense, the se sometimes contradictory texts share only their claim to a com mon source of revelation, Hermes Trismegistus. In most of the texts his revel ations are presented as a dialogue with one of three pupils: Tat, Asclepius, or Ammon. According to Augustine[115], Asclepius was the grandson of the g reat Greek god of the same name, and Tat was likewise the grandson of his divine namesake (the Roman deity Mercurius, the same as the Greek god He rmes). The Hermetic texts are often cited as examples of t he extent of late Hellenistic syncretism, for they exhibit traits of magic, astrology, alchemy, Platonism and Stoicism, and the Mysteries, as well as Judaism and gnostic thought. Such influences are not arbitrary borrowin gs but express the systemic assumptions of the late Hellenistic age ge nerally: the Ptolemaic delineation of a hierarchical cosmos under the rule of heimarmene , the sympathetic parallel between macrocosm and microcos m, the attendant understanding of the consubstantial nature of all e xistent entities, the devoted or fallen feminine nature of reality, and t he masculine redemptive possibility of cosmic and temporal reversal and thu s of the effects of fall by means of a spiritual participation in the golden an tiquity of origin. Hermeticism may be illustrated from the Poimandres, the first and most well known of the tractates. The Poimandres opens w ith the visionary account of an unnamed seeker: "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"One day, when I began to reflect on existence, and my thoughts had soared, and my bodily senses were held down like people heavy w ith sleep through surfeit of food or physical exhaustion, it seemed to me that a giant creature of immeasurable dimensions approached, called me by name, and said: \"What do you wish to hear and to see and to learn and to know with understand ing?\" And I said: \"Who are you then?\" \"I,\" he said, \"am Poimandres, the Nous ( Intellect) of the Absolute Sovereignty. I know what you wish, and I am with yo u everywhere.\" And I said: \"I desire to learn the things that exist, to understan d their nature and to know God. How much I do desire to hear!\" Again he said to me: \"Hold fast in your mind what you wish to learn and I will teach you.\" The passage is characterized by a dualistic distinc tion between the corporeality of the \"bodily senses\" and Nous, the i nner-thought or intellect of the seer, which soars aloft to receive spiritual revelation. The redemptive knowledge of \"the things that exist,\" of their natu re, and of (what was the same thing) the knowledge of God, is revealed in th is noncorporeal vision by Poimandres. Let us look at the dramatis personae before going further. The Hermetica are presented as revelations of divine truth, not as th e product of human reason; and in the philosophical texts as in the te chnical texts those who do the revealing are the typical deities of Graeco-Egy ptian syncretism.[116] Alongside Hermes Trismegistus himself and Isis, who had long been associated in the Egyptian as well as the Greek tra dition,[117] we find Asclepius, identified with the Egyptian Imhotep/Imo uthes;[118] Ammon, the Egyptian god Amun, euhmeristically regarded by some as one of the country's early kings;[119] Horus, the son of Isis; [120] and Agathos Daimon. Rather more unusually, the Kore kosmou alludes to Kamephis as an intermediary between Hermes and Isis, while S.H . XXVI.9 identifies the god of philosophy as Arnebeschenis, a Greek transcr iption for 'Horus of Letopolis. Both of these divinities are attested el sewhere in Greek literature of or on Egypt, but they were considerably less wel l known than the other figures mentioned, and their presence can be taken to indicate more than a superficial familiarity with the native milieu. The re are also figures unique to the Hermetica: Poimandres, Tat and the priest Bi tys. The origin and meaning of the name Poimandres is unclear, though i t may be Egyptian.[121] As for Tat, he began humbly enough a s a Greek misspelling of Thoth, but ended up taking on an identity of his own as Thoth-Hermes's son, both bodily and spiritual. The Hermetists appa rently saw nothing"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"inconsistent in this-an indication that philosophic al Hermetism is not just a haphazard accumulation of separate elements, but a self-validating structure with its own conventions. Most modern experts on the Hermetica distinguish the \"popular\" occultist writings attributed to Hermes from the \"learned\" or \"philosophical\" treatises. Garth Fowden, in his The Egyptian Hermes , argues persuasively that all the Hermetica , whether practical or theoretical, magical or philosophical, can be understood as responses to th e same milieu, the very complex Graeco-Egyptian culture of Ptolemaic, Roman and early Christian times.[122] With regard to origins and interrelation s, the claim that both types of Hermetica come from a common environment r ings true, yet two other facts also bear consideration: first, that th e seventeen Greek treatises of the Corpus Hermeticum came to be treated as a distinct body of writing, though perhaps for no better reason than the accide nts of textual transmission or the prejudices of Byzantine compile rs; and second, that these seventeen Greek logoi are not much concerned with astrology, very little with magic and not at all with alchemy. They deal with theological, or, in some loose sense, philosophical issues: they reveal to man knowledge of the origins, nature and moral properties of divi ne, human and material being so that humanity can use this knowledge to sa ve themselves. The same pious philosophy or philosophical piety-a blen d of theology, cosmogony, anthropogony, ethics, soteriology and es chatology-also characterizes the Latin Asclepius , the forty Hermetic texts and fragments collected in the Anthology of Stobaeus, the three Hermetica found with the Nag Hammadi Codices , the Armenian Definitions and the Vienna fragments. Although traces of occult belief, astrology especia lly, is evident in many of these works, even dominant in some, their central p hilosophical and theological concerns do, in fact, distinguish the f rom what Festugiere called \"popular Hermetism.\"[123] Around 200 CE the Christian writer Clement of Alexa ndria knew of \"forty- two books of Hermes\" considered indispensable for t he rituals of Egyptian priests; the list, four of whose items he calls \"th e astrological books of Hermes,\" somewhat resembles a description of sacred writings inscribed in the second century BCE on the wall of an Egyptian t emple in Edfu.[124] Clement's report accords with our fragmentary knowl edge of the Graeco- Egyptian astrology that began to develop as early a s the third century BCE. Although it was a Greek work of the third or second century BCE,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"composed perhaps in Alexandria and dealing with con figurations of stars regarded as divinities, the title and other feature s of the Salmeschiniaka hint of Babylonian origins, though nothing proves such a connection. In the middle of the second century BCE, the unknown autho r of an astrology manual fathered his work on a pharaoh who ruled fiv e centuries earlier, Nechepso, and on the high priest Petosiris, who rep utedly took his revelation from Hermes and may correspond to an his torical figure of the fourth century. The fragments of the handbook beari ng the names of Nechepso and Petosiris survive mainly in the Anthology of Vettius Valens, a Roman astrologer who wrote in Greek in the second c entury CE. The most important of the astrological Hermetica known to us is the Liber Hermetis , a Latin text whose Greek original contained elements traceable to the third century BCE. This Book of Hermes describes the decans, a peculiarly Egyptian way of dividing the zodiacal circle into t hirty-six compartments, each with its own complex of astrological attribute s. Some Hermetic texts were tight in their focus, applying astrological th eory to special circumstances: a Brontologion analyzed the significance of thunder as it was heard in various months, and a treatise Peri seismon related earthquakes to astrological signs. Of broader use were the Iatromathematika or tracts on astrological medicine, such as the Book of Asclepius Called Myriogenesis that discussed medical consequences of the theory of cor respondence between human microcosm and universal macrocosm. Astrologic al botany and mineralogy were also favored topics. The Holy Book of Hermes to Asclepis based its botanical prescriptions on the relations between plants and decans, while the Fifteen Stars, Stones, Plants and Images singled out particular stars as determinants of pharmaceutical power.[125] Another kind of occult wisdom attractive to Hermeti c authors was alchemy, which made its first literary mark on Egyp t after 200 BCE in the writings of Bolos Democritus of Mendes: the vestige s of his work show that Bolos described processes involving gold, silver, g ems, dyes and other substances that became the main ingredients of the alchemical work. After Bolos but before the Christian era, a number of alc hemical treatises began to appear under the names of Hermes, Agathodaimon, Isis and others. The latest date from the second or third century CE, an d today we know them only as fragments - no more than thirty or so - fro m later alchemical treatises that mention either Hermes or another Her metic figure. One of the larger remains of this literature, the Anepigraphos , cites the authority of"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Hermes and Agathodaimon for an allegory on the maki ng of silver, called \"the moon,\" by cooking and melting various substanc es. In another, entitled Isis the Prophetess to her Son Horus , the angel Amnael reveals the alchemical mystery: that just as wheat engenders wh eat or person begets person so gold breeds gold. These alchemical Hermet ica were known to Zosimus, a native of Panopolis who lived in Alexand ria around 300 CE. Zosimus is of great interest because he mingled Her metic theosophy with the alchemist's pragmatic aims and left at least tw o works that shed light on the larger Hermetic project, especially on the k inship between the technical and philosophical texts.[126] The collection of the first book of the collection called Kuranides says that \"the god Hermes Trismegistus received this book fro m the angels as god's greatest gift and passed it on to all individuals f it to receive secrets.\" The book also claims to be a compilation from two other s by Kuranos, which may be a version of the Persian name Cyrus, and by Harpocration, an otherwise unknown author of late imperial times; th e same work refers to an Archaikos Biblos , probably an early bestiary. This first of the six surviving Kuranides has twenty-four chapters, one each for the letter of the Greek alphabet that begins the names of the plant, bird fish and stone treated in the chapter. The second Kuranis has forty-seven alphabetized chapters on quadrupeds and their medical properties ; the four others handle birds, fish plants and stones in the same wa y. Manuscripts of all but the last two books carry ascriptions to Hermes Tris megistus, but philology has traced them to the same Bolos Democritus who wa s a fountainhead of alchemical wisdom. If Bolos was their progenitor, t he Kuranides represent the largest survival in Greek of a literature initi ated by him that treated a wide range of natural phenomena and emphasized thei r medical and magical uses.[127] If Fowden is right to claim that \"the technical and philosophical books...are related aspects of...a practical spiritual 'way,'\" then in the philosophical treatises one expects to find the theory behind the praxis of the technical Hermetica . When one looks, however, in the Corpus Hermeticum , the Asclepius , the Stobaeus excerpts or the Nag Hammadi Hermetica for a theory of magic, something like what Proclus wrote On the Hieratic Art according to the Greeks , this seems not to be the case, although there are passages that assume such a theoretical framework f or remarks on astrology, demonology or related topics. Instead of a theory of magic, the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"theoretical Hermetica present a theory of salvation through knowledge or gnosis , yet this theory was the product of a culture that made no clear, rigid distinction between religion as the province of suc h lofty concerns as the fate of the soul and magic as a merely instrumental device of humbler intent.[128] In the Papyri many spells have as thei r goal enpneumatosis or \"inspiration,\" literally, filling with pneuma or spirit. Was it a religious or a practical aim to seek such inspiration from Hermes? What we know of the role of pneuma in Gnostic and early Christian religion and of its place in Stoic physics and Galenic medicine should convince us that the question implies a false, unhistorical dichotomy.[129] Salva tion in the largest sense - the resolution of man's fate wherever it finds him - was a common concern of theoretical and technical Hermetica alike, thoug h the latter texts generally advertised a quotidian deliverance from b anal misfortunes of disease, poverty and social strife, while the forme r offered a grander view of salvation through knowledge of God, the other an d the self. This distinction, as Fowden and others have shown, gives us only rough, provisional categories better suited to some texts than to others. Although the excerpts in the Anthology of Stobaeus have commonly been treated as \"philosophical,\" a term that fits most of them as w ell as it suits the Corpus Hermeticum proper, some of the Stobaean material clearly qual ifies as technical. Excerpt VI deals with astrology, in particular with the de cans and their \"sons,\" the star demons. Festugiere highlight ed the conclusion of this treatise, which promises that \"one who has not igno red these things can understand god precisely and, if one dare say so, e ven see god with his own eyes and, having seen god, become blessed.\" In other words, the Hermetic authors found technical information on the decan stars a suitable prelude to gnosis .[130] The longest and most interesting of the Stob aean excerpts, the Kore Kosmou , or \"Daughter of the Cosmos,\" forthrightly declares that \"no prophet about to raise his hands to the gods has ever ignored any of the things that are, so that philoso phy and magic may nourish the soul and medicine heal the body\"; this suggests that all knowledge - magical, medical and any other - bears on the quest for gnostic salvation. Magic comes closest to philosophy, perha ps, in the famous \"god- making\" passages of the Asclepius (23-4, 37-8) which shows that material objects can be manipulated to draw a god down into a statue and thus ensoul it.[131] "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The writings of Zosimus, like the contrary advice o f the Kore kosmou , show that categories roughly to modern usage of such ter ms as \"magic,\" \"philosophy\" and \"religion\" were available to the v ery people who so frequently mixed them. Mixed aims and methods are e vident in the sixth tractate of the sixth Nag Hammadi Codex , the \"Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth.\" This work is a leading example of what Fowd encalls an \"initiatory\" hermetic text concerned with the final phases of a \"philosophical paideia ,\" the last steps that the initiate takes to recognize his true nature and then, in knowing God, to attain godhood. NHC VI.6 shares these sublime intentions with some parts of the Corpus Hermeticum, especiall y C.H . I and XIII, but most of the other seventeen Greek treatises are \"pr eparatory\" in Fowden's taxonomy. The describe various lower stages in the progress toward wisdom that the initiate must acquire before enjoyi ng the rebirth offered in C.H. XIII or NHC VI.6.[132] If the preliminary states of spiritual growth diffe red from one another, the changes among them may explain a striking feature o f the Corpus , the apparently great divergences in doctrine between it s component treatises and even within an individual logos . Scholars have taken pains to analyze and schematize parts of the Corpus as monist or dua list, optimist or pessimist, but Fowden proposes to see such variatio ns as sequential rather than contradictory. Thus, a positive view of the co smos as good and worth understanding would suit an earlier stage of the in itiate's labors and, hence, a treatise focusing on a time when the body' s needs were still great, while a negative treatment of the world as evil and unworthy of thought might befit a farther station in the spirit's journ ey and a different treatise on topics closer to the culmination of gnosis , which entailed liberation from the body. In any event, the texts themselves show that the Hermetic authors felt no obligation to respect the boundaries drawn around their writings by modern critics. NHC VI.6, for example, seeks nothing less than \"the gr eat divine vision,\" but it also contains two ritual pas sages that would not be out of place in the Magical Papyri (one of which in cludes the same prayer that concludes the Asclepius ). In the second such passage, the initiate says, I give thanks by singing a hymn to you. For I have received life from you, when you made me wise. I praise you. I call your name that i s hidden within me: a ö ee ö ëë öö ii öööö oooo ööö uuuuu öööööööööööö. You are the one who exists with the spirit. I sing a hymn to you reverently. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Hermes, the mystagogue, then directs his \"son to wr ite this book for the temple at Diospolis in hieroglyphic characters, ent itling it 'The Eighth Reveals the Ninth.'\"[133] This exchange between Tri smegistus and his disciple confirms what Iamblichus said about Egypti an theology, that they certainly do not just speculate about these th ings. They recommend rising up through priestly theurgy toward the higher and more universal levels above fate, to the god and craftsman, and without material attachm ent or any other help at all except observing the proper time. Hermes also gave instruction in this way, which Bitus the prophet translated for King Ammon after f inding it carved in hieroglyphic letters in shrines of Sais in Egypt. Although Iamblichus seems to exclude any \"material attachment\" from Hermetic theurgy, the same cannot be said of the Asclepius , which in its \"art of making gods\" permitted \"a comformable power aris ing from the nature of matter\" and even mentioned \"a mixture of plants, stones and spices, in describing the nature of the gods called down to an imate their statues. PGM IV.475-829, formerly known as the \"Mithras Liturgy ,\" begins by calling for \"the juices of herbs and spices,\" and i t addresses the elementary powers of spirit, fire, water and earth with mystic al noises like those that appear on almost every page of the Magical papyri: \"EY EIA EE, water of water, the first of the water in me, OOO AAA EEE, e arthy material, the first of the earthy material in me, YE YOE, my complete b ody.\" The same invocation seeks deliverance beyond the bodily elem ents \"to immortal birth and...to my underlying nature, so that...I may gaze upon the immortal.\" Just as Iamblichus said, this famous document exhor ts the initiate to rise up through theurgy to a divine rebirth; its devices ar e concrete and technical, but it sets those procedures in a matrix of theory explored more thoroughly in the Corpus Hermeticum and the Asclepius .[134] Hermetic Collections When A.D. Nock edited the Corpus , he used twenty-eight manuscripts dating from the fourteenth through the seventeenth centuries, but fifteen of them contain only the first fourteen treatises, or in some cases, even fewer. Two manuscripts that include all seventeen logoi also preserve a comment on C.H. I.18 written by Michael Psellus, an important Byza ntine scholar of the eleventh century. Finding the words of the bibl ical Genesis in this heathen cosmogony, Psellus remarked of its author t hat \"this wizard seems to have had more than a passing acquaintance with h oly writ. Making an eager go of it, he tries his hand at the creation o f the world, not scrupling to"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"record the cherished Mosaic expressions themselves. \" It is noteworthy that a Byzantine Christian learned in Neoplatonism wishe d to defame the Bible- reading Hermes as a goes or \"wizard,\" especially since the seventeen Greek treatises say so little about occult topics. Passag es on astrology and magic in the theoretical Hermetica are even scarcer in C.H. I-XIV than in XVI-XVIII and the Asclepius . Could it be, then, that what we call the Corpus Hermeticum took shape just as a consequence of the abhorrence of magic expressed by Psellus? If so, it is worth noting the likelihood t hat he shared this pious loathing with other Byzantine scholars who transmit ted the Corpus from his time to the fourteenth century, when the earlie st extant manuscripts were written.[135] Byzantine editors and copyists, then, may have immo rtalized their prejudices by selecting and redacting our Corpus from a larger body of Hermetica that certainly gave much attention to the occultis m that is so inconspicuous in the theoretical treatises, especia lly the first fourteen. For Christian readers f the Latin West and Greek East al ike, a Corpus purged of magic would better befit the authorship of the paga n sage described in the Suda around the year 1000: \"Hermes Trismegistus....was an Egyptian wise man who flourished before Pharaoh's time. He was ca lled Trismegistus on account of his praise of the trinity,[136] saying t hat there is one divine nature in the trinity.\" The Hermetica are full of r andom pieties, which is why Christians from patristic times onward so much admired them. Before the eleventh century - when Psellus seems to have known the Corpus in roughly its present form, around the same time when the first collections of technical Hermetica were assembled b y Byzantine scholars - there is no sign of the Corpus as such, although in dividual treatises were evidently in use as early as the third century CE. John of Stobi, or Stobaeus, seems not to have known the Corpus as a whole, but he compiled an Anthology around the year 500 that contains forty e xcerpts of varying lengths from hermetic writings, including parts of C.H. II, IV, IX, and the Asclepius. Excerpts that do not give partial texts (texts that represent a separate and sounder tradition than other manuscrip ts of the Corpus , which just on that account would seem to have been assemb led after Stobaeus) or the Corpus or the Asclepius fall into four groups: Hermes, Hermes to Tat, Hermes to Ammon, and Isis to Horus.[137] Earlier th an Stobaeus is an interesting remark from Cyril of Alexandria, who kn ew C.H. XI and XIV as well as other treatises now lost; he died around th e middle of the fifth"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"century. Much like Psellus, Cyril disapproved of He rmes as a magus and idolater, but he was fascinated by biblical and oth er resonances in his works, writing that this Hermes of Egypt, although he was a theurgist ( telestes ), ever sitting in the temple precincts near the idols, had the good sense to acquire the writings of Moses, even if he did not use them at all blameless ly or correctly, having but a part of them....The one in Athens who collected the fift een books called \"Hermetic\" ( Hermaika ) made himself a record of this in his own writings . [138] Although Cyril apparently knew a Hermetic collectio n, his other references to Hermetic writings do not show that these \"fiftee n books\" were a form of our Corpus . However, the earliest possible data, which comes from the texts themselves (sometimes referring to one another and to Hermetica outside the Corpus ), indicate that Hermetic collections of some kind circulated as early as the second or third centuries. A scribe wh o copied the Nag Hammadi Hermetica , part of a mid-fourth \"library,\" apologized for no t adding more Hermetic materials to his codex because \"the discourses of that one, which have come to me, are numerous,\" imp lying that he had access to more Hermetica than he had transcribed, c onceivably to a collection. Authors of NHC VI, C.H . V,X,XII and XIV, S.H. III and VI and the Asclepius recognized groups of treatises by name, although t he meanings of their labels to their original users remain unclear .[139] THE AMBIGUOUS BODY OF THE CORPUS HERMETICUM By Author Currently Unknown Presented as the closing paper for the Bodies Conference Welcome to this, the tail end of the conference.

All of our ideas are inscrib ed within a body of practice which mandates (which is to say embodies) publication, conferences, dissertations, and other modes of disc ourse which allow the graduate student to secure a place within the b ody of scholarship and the body of scholars. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Yet I intend to tell a tale, and to present that st ory as a body of evidence. Twenty years before Columbus set off on h is journey, a new world was discovered, and revealed to Europe. No me re land mass, this New World was the Body of Man, revealed as the World itself, the world in miniature, as Man himself was a small God. This revelation came through a peculiar body of Greek te xts, themselves claiming to be translations from an Egyptian sage/m an/god: Hermes the Thrice Greatest. This revelation came through t he translation of this \"Corpus Hermeticum\" from Greek into Latin by M arsilio Ficino in the fifteenth century and his efforts at establi shing an Academy in Florence which would renovate the World, both the l ittle and the big. A rather impressive text. What then was this Corpus Hermeticum? Here I am confounded by the same problem which it i s my intention in this paper to claim confronted Ficino. The ambig uity of the Corpus Hermeticum lies not in some particular interpretati on, but rather it is incumbent upon any interpretation of these strange texts, even to their description, and especially to an explanation of th eir origins. I hope to make this clearer further on. For now, perhaps, I s hould start as the Corpus Hermeticum begins itself, that is: \"Once upo n a time.\" Once upon a time, in the ancient land of Egypt the God Thoth, or Tehuti was worshipped. Tehuti was a moon-god, the p atron of science and literature, of wisdom and inventions, the spoke sman of the gods and the keeper of their records. If the Egyptian pa ntheon were an English department, Tehuti would be the Fullbright scholar who returns with an endowed chair. He isn't the Head of the department, but he's always snapping up the best students. Egyp tian theologians claimed that Thoth was the demiurge who created the universe with the sound of his voice. Thoth invented arithmetic, surveying, geometry, astronomy, soothsaying, magic, metallurgy , music, and writing. He was an inventive chap. Once upon a little later time, say the fifth centur y b.c.e., the Greeks discovered the Egyptians and began mapping the Hell enic pantheon onto the Theban. Their homegrown Greek god of messa ges and messengers, Hermes, was equated with Thoth. One of the Egyptian titles of respect for Tehuti was aa-aa or twice-gre at. The Greeks seem to have done one better by talking about a mysterio us Hermes Trismegistus, or Hermes the Thrice-great. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Now our once upon a time falls into history, so tha t nothing is very clear. Some Greek writers claimed that Hermes Trime sgistos was a human. Some held him to be a sage. Others a god. An d others some combination of all three. Galen knew of the writing s of \"Hermes the Egyptian\". Athenagoras in the second century A.D. k nows of Hermes Trismegistus whose family is linked with the gods. And both Clement of Alexandria and Iamblicus gave thumbnail sketches of the books of Hermes Trismegistus. Magic, astronomy, alchemy, cos mology and theosophy seemed to have been his especial topics. Iamblicus informs us, or mis-informs us, that Hermes wrote his works in Egyptian, in hieroglyphics (after all he did invent them) then t hey were translated into Greek. Also, Iamblicus claims, many other book s were being circulated under the name of Hermes which were not written by him. No such Greek works survived through to Christian E urope. By the fourteenth century Greek was operationally an unkno wn language, even to the educated monk or scholar. A single work , which claims to be a sort of seminar session between Hermes and the god of healing, Asclepius, did get translated into Latin some time in late antiquity and survived in an eleventh century codex. There our tale would end. Except that its plot was thickened, as are so many human stories, by war. The Turks were threaten ing to conquer Constantinople, seat of the Eastern Roman Empire an d center of Orthodox Greek Christianity. Negotiations were held in 1439 in Florence between representatives of the Metropolita n and the Pope, an attempt to smooth over theological differences betw een the two Catholic and Universal versions of the Christian fa ith, so that political aid might follow. Among the Greek priests and schol ars sent to negotiate with the Italians was one Gemisthus Pleth o. Pletho knew his Aristotle as the Europeans did not, he knew the ori ginal Greek. Pletho also knew Plato's works, none of which save the Tim aeus were in common use in Latin translation. Pletho was winning theological arguments using an erudition the Europeans lacked. Lacked but were soon to win for themselves. Just as the Soviet laun ch of Sputnik galvanized America's effort in aerospace, so this e mbarrassing show of Greeks with Greek scholarship hastened the study of Greek language, literature and philosophy in Europe. One of the members in the audience in 1439 who hear d Pletho and saw that Greek could be a strategic advantage for F lorence was Cosimo Medici. It took Cosimo a couple of decades b ut he found the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"perfect young scholar to learn this new Greek and t ranslate the works of Plato and the neoPlatonists. That scholar was Ma rsilio Ficino. Cosimo set Ficino up in a villa in Careggi and supp lied him with greek manuscripts. In the 1460's in the midst of tr anslating Plato, Ficino was told by Medici himself to stop work and begin immediately translating a newly acquired manuscript , a collection of little booklets or tractates, attributed to some sa ge or man or god mentioned by Clement and Iamblicus. In short, Ficin o set about translating the Corpus Hermeticum. Ficino knew his ancient authors, so he \"knew\" that Hermes Trimegistus was more ancient than any of them. By t he ancients' own testimony these lectures and revelations of Hermes were an original fountain of wisdom from which Moses and Plato were separate, though related, streams of thought. And what Ficino found in these tractates was that t he body, the cosmos, the human being, and God, were intimately r elated, were magically connected. The cosmos was a body, and the human was a little version of the cosmic. Ficino would later wr ite in his Commentary on the Symposium \"The parts of this worl d, members of one living being, all originating from the same mak er, are joined together in the communion of one nature. Therefore, just as our brain, lungs, heart, liver and other organs act on one ano ther, assist each other to some extent, and suffer together when any one of them suffers, in just this way the organs of this enormo us living being, all the bodies of the world joined together in like man ner, borrow and lend each other's natures.\" And through what agency is this borrowing accomplished?...through love. \"Because\" as Ficino s ays, \"all the power of magic consists in love.\" But this coherent, ordered, beautifully symmetrical system of interrelationships was not so much found in the rea ding as created by that reading. In a very real sense, the Renaissance version of this Hermetical philosophy which became one of the sourc es for the 17th and 18th century's political and scientific revolut ions, this orderly philosophy of the cosmic body and cosmic eros was t he result of Ficino's misreading across the corpus hermeticum. Ficino's manuscript consisted of fourteen tractates . Who put these little booklets together into a single collection, and when this might"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"have been done are questions to which neither Ficin o nor we now have answers. There were other manuscript tradition s, however, than Ficino's, which contained four more tractates appen ded at the end. One of these additional tractates which Ficino did not have at his disposal, could have warned him of the dangers of r eading and translations. This little book is written as a lett er from Asclepius to King Ammon and says in part: \"For my teacher Hermes used to say...that those who read my writings with the righ t mind will think them to be quite simply and clearly written, but th ose who hold the opposite principles to start with will say that the style is obscure, and conceals the meaning. And it will be thought still more obscure in time to come, when the Greeks think fit to translat e these writings from our tongue into theirs. Translations will grea tly distort the sense of the writings, and cause much obscurity. Expresse d in our native tongue, the teaching conveys its meaning clearly, b y the very quality of its sound, and when the Egyptian words are spoke n, the force of the things signified works in them... [But] the speech of the Greeks, my King, is devoid of power to convince, and the Greek philosophy is nothing but a noise of talk. But our speech is not mere talk; it is an utterance replete with workings.\" In this utterly unstructuralist theory of language the sign is the very working, the ergos, or organ of the signified. And the process of reading is a magical act which makes manifest, not the writing, but the principles held in the mind which reads. It is not, as with Harold Bloom, that every reading is necessarily a misreadi ng, but rather that reading is a magical act of evocation in which the presence of the text as speech, its embodiment in sound, summons forth t he spirit, the foreheld thought of the reader who is thus a magus transforming thought to action through the body of a text. Then what did the fourteen tractates which Ficino p ossessed actually say about man, the body, the cosmos and God? The an swer varies with each tractate. Let me read excerpts of a few a nd determine what sort of influence seems to be at work in that passa ge. The first tractate is titled Poimandres. This book relates a vision where once upon a time while the speaker was pondering on first principles he fell into a strange sleep and was addressed by a Being of vast and boundless magnitude, Poimandres. Poimandres shows t he speaker the creation of the world out of the four elements. Bei ng merely"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"elemental, the stuff of the world is vastly inferio r to God. But \"Mind, the Father of All, he who is Life and Light, gave b irth to Man, a Being like to Himself. And He took delight in Man, as bei ng His own offspring; for Man was very goodly to look on, bear ing the likeness of his Father. With good reason then did God take deli ght in Man; for it was God's own form that God took delight in. And Go d delivered over to Man all things that had been made.\" Here we cert ainly seem to be dealing with a writer who is familiar with the Gene sis account of man's creation. But this account is made more probl ematic. Poimandres continues \"And Nature, seeing the beauty of the form of God, smiled with insatiate love of Man, showing the reflection of that most beautiful form in the water, a form like to hi s own, in earth and water, loved it, and willed to dwell there. And the deed followed close on the design; and he took up his abode in matter d evoid of reason. And Nature, when she had got him with whom she was in love, wrapped him in her clasp, and they were mingled in one; for they were in love with one another. [14]\" Man's body is forced upon him by a feminine Nature who has a wild crush on the Masculine idea of man. This sort of re lationship bears close resemblance to Gnostic myths current in the s econd century C.E. Obviously, the cosmos as related by Poimandres is a nasty, grasping Lady who drags everything she touches, literally, i nto the mud. So the Cosmos is not such a great thing, eh? Yet the very next tractate contains this exchange between Hermes and Asclepius . \"Herm. And the Kosmos is a body, is it not? Ascl. Yes. Herm. Now this Kosmos is great; there is no body gr eater than the Kosmos.\" This cosmic body is not mere dross, for bound up wi th it is a spiritual principle: \"That which is within the body, and whic h moves the soulless thing, is not a body; and that is what mov es both the body of him who carries a thing and the body of the thing c arried; for a soulless thing cannot of itself move anything. Thus it is that you see the soul distressed by the weight of its burden, wh en it bears two bodies at once.\" "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"So the body is not mere mass, but rather it is matt er which is moved by soul. This soul is essential and of a piece with all created bodies. This concept will be found later by another reader of the Hermetica, Isaac Newton, and will be the seed of Newton's conc ept of mass/force as Betti Jo Dobbs has shown us. So only looking at the first two tractates, a great deal of smoothing over is necessary if the Hermetica are to present a coherent philosophy, or even point of view. But there are tw elve other books, each as varied. In one we read: \"And God is the Goo d, and nothing but the Good. Call nothing else good then, nothing but God.\" And the influence here of Gospel of John seems palpable. Ye t elsewhere in the same booklet we have: \"And the other name of God is 'Father'. He is called the Father, because he is the maker of beget ter of all things; for it is the part of a father to beget. And for this r eason the begetting of children is held by those who think aright to be th e most weighty concern in human life, and the most pius of deeds. That a man should depart from life and leave no child is a great misf ortune, and a great sin; it is a thing accursed in the sight of the Sun . Such a one is punished by the daemons after death; and the punish ment is this, that the soul of the man who has no child is condemned t o enter a body that is neither that of a man nor that of a woman. Therefore, Asclepius, never be glad on behalf of any man that he is childless, but pity his misfortune, knowing what manner of punishm ent awaits him. This certainly neither Christian nor Gnostic, both tending towards the encratic and ascetic. An Egyptian hold over? or a l ate Hellenic theory of homosexuality? Nor are the Hermetica democratic in their perceptio ns, the fourth tractate tells us \"But man has this advantage over all other living beings, that he possesses speech and mind {ton logo n kai ton noun} Now speech, my son, God imparted to all men; but mi nd he did not impart to all.\" Everyone yammers, this seems to say , even the Greeks. But only the few have the knowledge of true mind. S o we would think these writers had little use for the common man or for the mere body, that material sludge of Nature who is after all onl y a sort of lusting Sadie Hawkins of souls. Yet the fifth tractate spea ks of the body as movingly as the Book of Job. \"Think, my son, how ma n is fashioned in the womb; investigate with care the skill shown in that work, and find out what craftsman it is that makes this fair and godlike image. Who is it that has traced the circle of the eyes, t hat has pierced the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"orifices of the nostrils and the ears, and made the opening of the mouth? Who is it that has stretched the sinews out and tied them fast, and dug out the channels of the veins? Who is it th at has made the bones hard, and covered the flesh with skin? Who is it that has separated the fingers, and shaped the broad surface of the soles of the feet? Who is it that has bored the ducts? Who is it that has shaped the heart into a cone, and joined the sinews to it, tha t has made the liver broad, and the spleen long, and hollowed out the ca vities of the lungs, and made the belly capacious? Who is it that has so fashioned the most honorable parts that all may see them, and con cealed the parts that are unseemly? See how many crafts have been em ployed on one material, and how many works of art are enclosed in one compass! All are beautiful, all true to measure, yet all are div erse one from the other.\" And it doesn't seem far fetched to imagine acquaintance with Job for this writer. For the most part, though, the philosophy presented in the majority of the tractates is good old fashioned Middle Platonis m. \"The Good, Asclepius, must be a thing that is devoid of all mo vement and all becoming, and has a motionless activity that is cen tered in itself; a thing that lacks nothing, and is not assailed by pa ssions....\" these sorts of Platonic quotations could be given for hours. What then attracted Ficino? Where did he the find e vidence for the wisdom he assumed lay in these texts? There are som e passages worthy of a sage/god/man. This one in particular pr esents a idealized humanism not to be matched, not in Pico's own De ho minus dignitate, nor in Hamlet's magnificent \"What a piece of work i s man..\" The following speech was written, not in the Renais sance, but in that misty antiquity which spawned Renaissance humanism: \"If then you do not make yourself equal to God, you cannot apprehend God; for like is known to like. Leap clear of all t hat is corporeal, and make yourself grow to a like expanse with that grea tness which is beyond all measure; rise above all time, and become eternal; then you will apprehend God. Think that for you too nothing is impossible; deem that you too are immortal, and that you are ab le to grasp al things in your thought, to know every craft and eve ry science; find your home in the haunts of every living creature; m ake yourself higher than all heights, and lower than all depths; bring together in"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"yourself all opposites of quality, heat and cold, d ryness and fluidity; think that you are everywhere at once, on land, at sea, in heaven; think that you are not yet begotten, that you are in the womb, that you are young,m that you are old, that you have died, that you are in the world beyond the grave;' grasp in your thought all this a rt once, all times and places, all substances and qualities and magnitudes together; then you can apprehend God. ...[20b] For it is the height of evil not to know God; but to be capable of knowing God, and to wish and hope to know him, is the road which leads straight to the G ood; and it is an easy road to travel. Everywhere God will come to me et you, everywhere he will appear to you, at places and tim es at which you look not for it,, in your waking hours and in your sleep, when you are journeying by water and by land, in the night-time and in the day- time, when you are speaking and when you are silent ; for there is nothing which is not God...Nothing is invisible, no t even an incorporeal thing; mind is seen in its thinking, an d God in his working.\" [22] I apologize for so extensively quoting the text I'm supposed to be talking about. I offer only two defenses. First, as long drawn as the preceding quotations were, the Hermetica themselves are much longer and far more complex in their apparent borrowings a nd syncretism than even this florilegium could make evident. And secondly, when I get started talking about gnosticism and Hermeticis m I tend to forget that the Corpus Hermeticum and the Nag Hammadi text s really aren't as widely read as Shakespeare, or even Tennyson. So now that we at least we have a basic idea of wha t these texts contain, let's examine Ficino's concept of the magi cal body. Besides his Commentary to the Symposium, Ficino included mu ch of his magical theory in the Three Book on Life, and it is especially in the third of these that we see him explaining the idea of a cosmic body where signals are sent, something like our own nerv ous impulses, through astral influence. Each of our bodies, just as the bodies of gems and plants and animals, replicates, mirror in some way that cosmic body, so the influence of the stars influenc es us. Also, since Christ is the image of man and the person of God, w e are in our bodies reflections of godhood itself. But that concept itself, the body, has not been exh austed even after this two day conference. Our own contemporary notio n of what a"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"body is is still for the most part inscribed within a structuralist paradigm, a sort of structuralism which Foucaultian , Derridean or Irrigaric theories might consider dated, if not in fact outdated (wherein \"my body\" is defined as the sum total of all that i s not \"my body\", or my body ends where some other body begins). Or else we locate our bodies through a pure and privative capitalist crit ique (in this case \"my body\" is all that I own, my body is property an d that property is mine). That these are not merely academic questions , of where bodies end or where proprietary rights begin, is obvious f rom the current deadly abortion question. But for the Hermetic revolution to make sense to us here, now; for the notion of world as body, we must locate the boundar ies between world and body in a wholly unmodern fashion. In the modern epoch, say since Descartes, between self and world there i s a originary division inscribed, the primal slash is envisioned as being situated between my \"self\" and my \"world\". Yet other times h ad other bodies, and that slash was placed differently so that, in f act, the world was a body, and the body was a world. It might help, at this point, to examine the origin s of these words I am tossing about as \"body\" and \"world\". For it is the Greek \"soma\" which reflects the equally Greek \"kosmos\". And we find th at the move towards translation, the move, first, from Greek to Latin so that \"kosmos\" becomes \"mundus\"; and then this present tr anslation of \"mundus\" to world blurs essential origins. As the C orpus Hermeticum warned us, translation has brought confusion and ap parent senselessness. Let us then examine these words in a proper, modern, scholarly way. Let us examine their etymologies. The Greek soma meant at first, or as early as Homer , \"mere\" body, the physical stuff, as opposed to demas, the living bod y. Later \"soma\" designated both the living and the dead body, with the distinction that the living \"soma\" was imbued with \"psyche\" or the a nimating vital spirit. And this word \"soma\" can be traced back to an earlier Proto- Indo European root which developed related words in Greek meaning \"swelling\", \"thumb\", \"tumor\" and \"tumulus\". This is an unexpectedly troublesome etymology. How is the body like the thu mb or the burial tumulus? The image this etymology suggests is of a thumby, tumorous, tumulous-bound swelling about the soul. T he body is considered a swelling. We might examine this deriva tion of \"body\" as"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"swelling from a male point of view, as a metonomy f or that urgent singular swollen member around which the body pivot s and manifests as mere supplement to thrust. Or, on the other hand , from the feminine perspective the body can be seen as the swelling wi thin the womb, the tumescence beneath the mystery of her pregnant bell y, the body as a vital tumor in the hidden uterus. The bodily metaphor makes assumptions of a certain anal retentive neediness for surroundings. The swelling which is t he body finds its end in the swelling that is the grave. The grave is seen as a marker, a sign of the body buried beneath it. The tomb is lit erally in Greek a \"seme\", a sign; so that even semantics finds its or igin in the somatic. And I would return to my first toilet joke and remi nd us that the Latin mundus in a phrase such as mundus mulieribus meant the toilet of the women, their decorations, their ornamentation, much as we could imagine some supermarket magazine called Ladies' Wo rld, replete with ads and articles about perfumes, shampoos and feminine hygeine products. Originally the Latin mundus had the prima ry meaning of cleansing methods or primping, so that Cicero tells us if he had guest coming over he would make sure his furniture was mu nda. This word for tidiness or a women's toilet became \"world\" onl y through a borrowing of the Greek word 'kosmos\", order, which could mean \"putting oneself in order\", \"arranging one's face\" powdering one's nose\" \"making one's toilet\" along with more general , ideal, and Greek notions of order in the \"big picture\" kosmos. Becau se the Latin word fit one of the meanings of the Greek word it took o n all of the other meanings too, in a sort of etymological act of impe rialism which we call a calque. The idea of kosmos, then, as order or ornament is a t least as old as the Pythagoreans. For them kosmos generated out of numb er hence possesses harmony and beauty, and is the opposite o f chaos. Perhaps ultimately the word \"kosmos\" must be derived from t he Proto-Indo European *kens \"to proclaim\", so that the idea of o rder is found etymologically to be not a given, but a product of discourse. So that voice or breath, the \"anima\" or \"psyche\" as the ver y stuff of discourse constitues the \"kosmos\", while the body, the \"soma\" , is the swelling stuff that surrounds the voice, and acts as both si gn and tomb of that indwelling breath. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The argument from etymology which is transparent to us as modern scholars (so that in fact our scholarship can de de fined as the set of practices which we use whose use is transparent to us) is a move towards the originary which is also of necessity im aginary. (all moves towards the originary must be imaginary: the Eden o f Christian historiography locates a first spot by inventing it , the primal protoplast of evolutionary theory cannot be found but it is th at datum supplied by the theory which founds the theory itself, the Big Bang of cosmology is not derived from data, the Oedipal complex of Fr eudian ego- formation). The origin we find through our scholarship is a pro duct of that scholarship. The transparency of this imaginary ori gin is surety of our scholarship; that is, we all understand the methods of scholarship, we can look through them transparently as through a wi ndow onto the world, and these methods are the givens, what is un derstood by the practicing community of scholars as the condition o f their scholarship, so that we do not ask \"meaningless questions\" or \"s tupid questions\" -- that is, those questions which reveal an ignorance of method, and also those which reveal a perception of the non-transpar ency of that method. The perceptive question of the New Historic ist is the stupid question of the New Critic. The etymological move towards PIE roots is one such gesture towards the originary and the imaginary. These roots, these origins, are \"found\" by looking through the words, \"past\" and \"b ehind\" them to an origin which our etymologies perceive by supplying. Ficino's move with the Hermetical texts is identica l, or at least congruent. He is also making a move toward the orig inary which is imaginary. Ficino sees through the Hermetical text to a originary point in some authoring, and authorizing, Hermes Trismegi stos who precedes the texts, from which the text derives, ra ther than seeing Hermes himself derived from the texts, an author wh o arises after the fact of his work. Ficino's renaissance scholarly attitude is distinct from our modern scholarly attitude in that he sees the Hermetica as originary rather than derived, as authored rather than anthologized, and as teaching and revealing a new order rather than repeating a recei ved world of thought. Since the texts reveal relationships with or knowledge of"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Babylonian astrology, Egyptian magic, Platonic cosm ology, Christian theology, Pythagorean number theory, Gnosticism, an d Cabalism this originary move fixes the diversity of opinion in a first source, a prisca theologica in which all of its diversity is resolve d into a primary unity, that is, truth, a truth which can be recaptured for Fifteenth century Europe and late Medieval Christianity, making room for Plato, and Humanism (along with a rediscovered and re-rational ized occultism) in the Ark of Mother Church. The Hermetica provided the possibility that Christi anity might be freshened (as we say of cows) by pagan wisdom which does not contradict either Moses (hence the Church) or Pytha goras (hence Plato and the Western philosophical tradition), sin ce both sprang from the originary fount of Hermes Trismegistos. This mushy, messy mystical world/body view is the b ody of my speech. If it were a science fiction story this wou ld be the tale of the irresistible force of ideas working upon all too mo vable bodies or \"When Worlds Collude\", of how mundus met kosmos aft er years of separation. How the world as decorative get up of i ts maker collided with world as grand, discursive ordering, and of ho w there was hell to pay for it, taken out in bodies, quite corporeally tied to stakes and burned. Ficino's reading elides authorship, so that in fact the entire collection of disparate tractates was called by the name of th e first libellus, Poimandres. It would be as though the whole New Tes tament were to be called the Book of Matthew, so that the Acts of the Apostles were called the fifth chapter of the book of Matthew. Ju st as he elides difference in the text, Ficino eludes diversity in his audience. Florence in the fifteenth century had become much more elite , more controlled by the Medici. Similarly, Ficino holds his symposia -- an essentially elitist movement of knowledge with those few schola rs who have learned Greek, some who learned Hebrew, and members of the powerful political families of Florence. These few men would act as the leaven to raise the loafing level of discourse in Europe. As Van Pelt has described for us, the image of the sacred Temple, itself, which before this time w as conceived to have an entrance but no exit, now develops an exit, apparently thorugh the influence of these Hermetical texts. Th e adept, after he"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"attains wisdom does not remain in the Temple, or as cend to the heavens, he returns to help mankind. The renaissanc e Hermeticists become involved in the Reformation. The end is near, the time is apocalyptic, but as it keeps not coming the urge to perfect the world for Christ's return becom es a reform movement, as in Rosicrucianism, a renovatio through the 17th century on into the end of the 18th century. Those who are gaining power through the occult, those who are discovering their magical bodies are turning around to help the world. The philosophical texts which were ascribed to the ancient Egyptian demigod/sage Hermes Trismegistus provided Europe wi th a new and invigorating philosophical tradition when these tex ts were first translated by Ficino in 1471. But the body of the H ermetical texts was problematized from that very first translation thro ugh Ficino's ascription of all 14 tractates to a single author, \"Poimandres\". Throughout the Renaissance these writings were \"mar ked\" in the Derridean sense to form a spurious unity which elid ed the differences between the Neo-Platonic, Gnostic, Greek magico-phi losophical, and Christian elements. Each of these strands of tradit ion has its unique view of the body, both as the human corpus and (thr ough metalepsis) as the cosmic body. The Renaissance developed tradi tions of the \"mesocosmos\" mediating between these two bodies in the form of churches, villas and public buildings which were se en in the sixteenth century \"Hermetic\" architectural tradition as talis manic temples, replicating in brick and mortar the very form of th e body of the cosmos. And truth can be recaptured for early modern Europe , making room for Plato, and Humanism. And Christianity might be freshened (as we say of cows) by a pagan wisdom which does not contr adict the Church. Yet within this very celebration of the hum anist conception of cosmic unity and human potential there is inscri bed the ineradicable mark of the anti-cosmic, the gnostic, which finds its provenance within the very body of these texts of l iberation. The Church, of course, did not put up with this. Ficino's translation is a tale of how mundus met ko smos after centuries of separation. It was a translation which would incite new insights in thousands, including Newton, Copernicus , and Gallileo.

The humanistic tradition which did eventually win o ut against such cannonical destruction of bodies, grounded itself, in part, on these Hermetical texts and was similarly \"marked\" with th e contradictions implicit among the various tractates, which manefes ted in a spurious, invented, and essential unity of the \"body\".

HERMETICA - KEY TO UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE By Joost R. Ritman © Translation of Joost R. Ritman's response to the laudatio delivered by prof. dr. Maria A. Schenkeveld-van der Dussen, chairwoman of the Arts Department of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, on being awarded the Academy's Silver Medal on 13 May 2002. Honourable chairman, governors, and members of the Academy, ladies and gentlemen, 'He who knows himself, knows the All' says the lege ndary Hermes Trismegistus. 'Nosce te ipsum - know thyself' is al so the motto over one of the entrance gates of a Greek temple at Delp hi. As the founder of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Herm etica, the international centre of research on the sources of the Hermetica, 'The Ritman Institute' and the publishing house 'In de P elikaan', I can assure you that for me the motto 'He who knows hims elf, knows the All' has been the impulse of my life work, for whic h today I gratefully receive the Silver Medal which you have so kindly a warded me on behalf of the Royal Netherlands Acadamy of Arts and Sciences."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" We live in times of great social change and of deep social problems, times in which millions of people flee impending da ngers of war, times in which shortages of food and water supplies are a major threat to our world and our natural resources are close to being exhausted. Standing on the brink of a threatening world confli ct which draws a sharp divide between millions of people living in s ickness and poverty and a relatively small group living in prosperity, the question is justified whether now is not the time to take renew ed control and counter a pending global catastrophe. According to Michele Ciliberto in his recently publ ished study on Giordano Bruno, the rediscovery of the Hermetica be yond any doubt was one of the most important contributions to hist orical studies in Humanism and the Renaissance in the last fifty year s. The discovery in 1945 of the gnostic Library of Nag Hammadi, consisting of some 42 gnostic, Hermetic and early C hristian texts, justifies a re-evaluation of the first four centuri es CE. The find of the by now famous Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran in the sam e period has sharpened our insight into the pre-Christian Jewish communities from which we are told came Jesus the Nazarene. Add to t hese discoveries the earlier one in the Egyptian Fayum in 1930 of at least four Coptic texts attributed to Mani, the founder of the worldw ide movement of Manichaeism, who called himself the apostle of Jesu s, and we may conclude that the influence of gnosis - a third com ponent next to religion and philosophy - on Western cultural histo ry has been truly great. This conclusion, formulated by the Nestor of Gnosis, Professor Gilles Quispel, has determined the infrastructure a nd the path of my life. It is not without reason when of the library of Ale xandria was officially re-opened on 23 April, an initiative led by Mrs. S. Muhbarak, wife of Egyptian president Muhbarak, in c ollaboration with an international group of scholars and support ed by the World Bank, the central theme was Thoth, the Egyptian dei ty who, it is said, as the precursor of Hermes Trismegistus expounded a nd put down in writing the initiation mysteries of Osiris, Isis an d Horus. When in 1985 the four main collecting areas of my l ibrary had been"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"defined and the library was opened to the public, t he axiom 'Ad Fontes - Back to the Sources' led me - in imitation of the Greek philosopher Plato and inspired by the foundation of the Florentine Academy by Marsilio Ficino in 1462 - to found an ac ademy that would focus entirely on conducting research into th e hidden relation God - Cosmos - Man; or in the words of the ancient Rosicrucians 'Why mortal man is also called a microcosm'. In 1985 Professor Quispel crossed my path and he in troduced me to a circle of European scholars who have since given ne w impetus and direction to research in Hermetica, Gnosis and earl y Christendom. The translations of the Hermetic Corpus Hermeticum and the Asclepius were carried out with great enthusiasm by Gilles Q uispel and Roel van den Broek and were foundation texts on the list of publications of the publishing house 'In de Pelikaa n', which by now contains some thirty titles, including conferences proceedings and exhibition catalogues. A new addition to the series will be a translation by Professor Roel van den Broek, now in progress, of the fragments of Stobaeus and the Hermetic Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus. The translation of the world-famous M ani Codex by Professor Hans van Oort and Gilles Quispel is also nearing completion. The placing of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermeti ca on the list coming under the Cultural Heritage Act on 25 Novemb er 1994 by then State Secretary, Mr. Aad Nuis, meant that part of our cultural heritage was rescued from dispersal. This decision also guaranteed the flourishing of the Europe-orientated Ritman Institu te under the guidance of two eminent scholars, Dr. Carlos Gilly, head of the Institute, and prof. dr. F.A. Janssen, professor of Book History at the University of Amsterdam. the Ritman Institute is as sociated with a group of prominent researchers. The Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica and its staf f aim, first, to collect important founding texts relating to Hermet ica, mysticism, alchemy, Rosicrucians and comparative religion, sec ondly, to make available these texts through historical research a nd the organization of international conferences, exhibitions, symposiu ms and other activities, and, thirdly, to publish the results of this research through"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"its own publishing house 'In de Pelikaan'. These th ree initiatives have been developed in the last forty years independentl y of each other, and can be seen as models of three central points of de parture: Ideality - Vitality - Reality The power of the imagination, the pursuit of an ide al, the quest after the origin of life, to transform the dynamics freed by these forces and activities into an accessible scientific structure, the fulfilling (or making real) of an ideal has resulted, forty years after the founding of the library in 1957, in frequent exchanges with som e 400 representatives of research institutes, spiritual m ovements and last but not least university libraries. Their combined effo rts have led to a return of the Hermetica to the centre of scholarshi p, guaranteeing its continued significance. Today we witness a renewal within the sciences and humanities. New disciplines for young scholars are being formed, e. g. through the foundation of university chairs such as that of the History of Hermetic Philosophy and related Currents at the University o f Amsterdam and the chair for Christendom and Gnosis at the Univers ity of Nijmegen. Articles and books appear explaining the origin and the true meaning of the main Hermetic and gnostic texts. Studies tha t one by one return true meaning to the early origins of European cultu ral history. Church power, scholarly power, political power, as appears from the chronicles written in blood, were never without dis honourable motives. One need only take a brief look at the lon g register of those convicted because they fought for freedom of religi on, freedom of expression, freedom of action. It is for this reaso n especially that I regard the award of the Silver Academy Medal by you as the governing body of the Royal Netherlands Society of Arts and Sciences as evidence of your defence of democratic liberties, for which the leaders of this country and its foremost representatives in this part of Europe have fought successfully for fo ur hundred years.

Let me conclude this word of thanks with words of H ermes Trismegistus from the Tabula Smaragdina : It is true! It is certain! It is the whole truth! That which is below is equal to that which is above and that which is above is equal to that which is b elow, in order that the wonders of the One shall be accom plished. As all things are accomplished out of the One, through one mediatorship, so they are all born out of the One by transmission .

HERMETICISM AND THE GOLDEN FLEECE By Joseph Caezza © Every century and upon every continent a handful of exceptional men are born who possess the innate ability to read the signatures of nature directly, to see immediately into the mystery of co ntinuous creation and to know pristine reality revealed by the power of imaginal identification. Such vision differs radically from twentieth century pedestrian academic mentality. These sages have beq ueathed us a legacy of artifacts fine as the thread of Ariadne i n the form of the good texts of Hermetic Alchemy. These tomes speak f rom the vein of the forge and the crucible, a mother load in the va st mine of collective imagination about mankind's origin and ultimate des tiny. They articulate with artful genius the same message of t he hero's journey embodied in the great world myths. A generation ahe ad of mythic Cadmus, a generation behind Homer's Ulysses, Jason' s quest for the Golden Fleece constitutes a fabulous example of the archetypal process of Nature referred to in the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Tristmegistus as \"the operation of the Sun\". The greatest alchemical adepts, Artephius, Nicholas Flamel, Salomon Trismosen, Michael Maier, Philalethes, Dom Pernety and Fulcanelli among many others have spoken at once with pornogra phic explicitness and again with exasperating obliquenes s about the bench- top laboratory manipulations revealed in the circum stances of Jason's voyage. Joscelyn Godwin in his brilliant forward to Antoine Faivre's contemporary survey, The Golden Fleece and Alchemy remarks that C. G. Jung anchors Jason's argo along with the Herm etic great work solely to the psychic level of personality integrat ion while ignoring how, why, what and with what, adepts actually do in their laboratories. Faivre too, pays gross negligence to this central aspect of the royal art which concerns itself with a combinat ion of prayer, study and working hands-on directly with matter. \"ORA, LE GE, LEGE, LEGE, RELEGE, LABORA ET INVENIES\", declares the mot to of the Mutus Liber of 1677, \"Pray, Read, Read, Read, Read Again and You Shall Find\"."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Western alchemy represents a highly specialized ver sion of the age old quest for mystical communion with the essential archetypal process of Nature. Adepts seek to recapitulate this process with symbolically affective laboratory gestures, chemica l manipulations and of course, with the indispensable cooperation o f providence. But what do they actually do in their laboratories? Betty Dobbs in her monumental study, The Foundations of Newton's Alchemy or The Hunting of the Green Lyon , addresses this central issue of laboratory procedures in their 17th centur y European context better than any modern professional scholar. She ex plains that adepts worked their methodologies with simple manipulation s and a few key materials. She provides an excellent translation of Sir Isaac Newton's Clavis, a recipe that entails the chief substances symbolized in the Jason myth. According to the myth, Chrysomellos, the winged ram sent by beneficent Olympian deities rescues a child from th e homicidal plot of his stepmother, carrying him safely to the eastern shores of the Black sea. Here the miraculous ram becomes a sacrifice, i ts fleece hung upon an oak tree in a grove sacred to Ares and guar ded by a dragon. The scenario refers metaphorically to the descent o f the Divine from above the highest sepheroth, Kether, down the Kabba listic tree of life to the lowest sepheroth, Malkuth, Earth in the pres ence of the element Antimony, who's vital spirit, philosophic mercury, remains still in tact. Matter has become the prison of spirit. Insig htful wisdom and artful alchemical manipulation may release it. Renaissance alchemists represented antimony by the symbolic rams horns that also identify the zodiac constellation A res. Antimony, a metalloid or semi-metal was perceived as below lead in an infant or childhood state in the natural process of metallic evolution fully mature in the element gold. It was also symbolized as a cross above a circle which additionally identified Earth, the div inely perfect circle of gold buried under the cross of nature upon which ma n is crucified. Gold, more than a metaphor, blatantly and beautiful ly bears the solar signature. Its perfect state defies oxidation or at tack by any single acid giving way only to aqua regia, a combination of nit ric and hydrochloric acid. Luster and permanence testify to its Divinity within the confines of the metallic realm."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Ares, known to the Romans as Mars, also indicates t he element Iron, rich in philosophical sulfur, the source principle of the luminous animating functional fire of Nature. It comprises t he compliment of philosophic mercury. Iron finds use in purifying st ibnite, the chief ore of antimony in the classic reduction process: Sb2S3 + 2 Fe = 2Sb + Fe2S3 . Newton spent years of study and labor working out t he details of this reaction and its product at the root of animated ph ilosophic mercury. Small iron nails are heated red hot in a crucible. Powdered antimony ore is added along with saltpeter and tartar to ser ve as fluxing agents. After several fulminating episodes sponsored by rep eated additions of saltpeter the molten material is poured into a coni cal mold. Pure antimony sinks to the bottom topped off by a layer of scoria which easily separates after cooling. Signs of correct cr ystal purity include a star pattern on the surface of the antimony, hence the name star martial regulus. In a major episode exactly reminiscent of Cadmus, J ason must sow serpents teeth into a field. From these seeds sprin g an army of ghost warriors who fight each other to death. The seed of gold, the serpent teeth are extracted from the layer of scoria above the purified antimony, the mercurial serpent, using sal ammoniac , ammonium chloride in the procedure of sublimation. This seed after purification is then sewn into meticulously prepared philosophic al mercury. This metallic mixture then sealed hermetically in a flas k undergoes a long gradually heated fermentation. Color changes clearl y mark the major stages of this incubation along with the emergence and dissolution from the molten mass of many strange forms describe d metaphorically in the Jason myth as a battle of gho st warriors. Newton and other adept authors describe these forms as fas t growing metallic trees. An anonymous contemporary operator recently perceived these forms as rapidly sprouting heads of cauliflower tha t soon dissolved back into the putrefying chaos contained in his her metic flask. The ultimate product of this labor mythically known as the golden fleece refers to the philosopher's stone. This red powder projected into molten base metal effects an apparently miraculous transmutation into gold. Recent discoveries by Stan Tenen and others, ( Gnosis No. 3 and 28) of the geometric revelation hidden in the Torah 's Hebrew letter code that model mathematically the fractal process of a seeds"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"germination into fruit containing self propagating seed within itself, illuminates this alchemical gesture of projection. During this gesture rearrangement of base metal subatomic particles cat alyzed by the propagated potency of Divine Presence unfolding flo wer-like from the philosopher's stone, creates a well known wonder of alchemy. This wonder of alchemy testifies with unquestionabl e proof to the level of personality integration achieved by the op erator. Unlike the vague proofs of successful psychotherapy the adept has a tangible token artifact. Alchemy of the forge and crucible v ariety thus embodies the profound idea of sacred science. Our l ate twentieth century civilization moves ever closer to the redis covery of this tradition. Yet the only way to exhaustively underst and the symbolic implications of the Jason myth in its alchemical co ntext is to become an alchemist and to execute the great work. But does salvation require a laboratory? The archet ypes projected into external substance may be manipulated at a strictly internal level. The symbols of western alchemy occur in familiar forms in Tantric Yoga. The European \"Royal Art\" of alchemy pursues the sam e goal as the Royal Raja Yoga of India. In the most remote past E uropean and Hindu cultures sprang from a single root whose core experience of Gnosis presented itself in myths and related esoter ic disciplines of spiritual reintegration. J. Nigro Sansonese, a contemporary yogin as well as professor of math and physics delivers a brilliantly argued thes is in his recent The Body of Myth . Expanding the tradition of C.G. Jung and Joseph Campbell he explicates the anatomic, physiologic an d neurologic basis of the great world myths. Such myths trek out the physical geography of man's body as the spiritual current mo ves up the spinal ladder of ascending attention to culminate in the e cstatic rapture of gnosis. According to Sansonese myths reveal in esoteric lan guage the stages of bodily transformation leading to contemplative t rance. He includes an entire chapter on Jason and the Argonauts. Jason 's ship, the argo refers to the cranium. The fifty argonauts represen t the five senses withdrawn from fragmented external experience yet f ocused on the inward journey into trance. Two of these argonauts, the Dioscuri,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Castor and Pollux are esoteric descriptions of alte rnate nostril breathing. The rowing contest between Jason and Hercules const itutes a further example of alternate nostril breathing just previou s to the experience of trance symbolized as the heros collapse from exh austion into unconsciousness. The author speaks from his own exp erience of meditative absorption when he describes minutely pe rceptible changes in the sutures and sinuses of the skull during brea thing which correlate to elements of the stages in the argonauts' journey . Finally Sansonese dissects the name \"Jason\" to reve al its two syllable nature as an onomatopoeic rendering for the physica l gesture of respiration. Convincing evidence appears in the anc estral lineage of Jason. His great-grandfather was Aeolus, god of the wind. Also relevant are yogic breathing exercises that assign onomatopoeic syllables to inspiration and expiration such as HAM -SA, SO-HAM or SI-VA. These arguments might seem eccentric and vag ue. Perhaps only another yogin could appreciate their depth and profoundness. Contemporary scholars have barely touched the pheno menological relationship between yoga and alchemy. Certainly th ey pursue identical goals. Mircea Eliade in his now classic e ncyclopedic survey, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom , includes a brief chapter on yoga and alchemy. He notes that there are certain moments wh en the \"osmosis\" between these two disciplines is perfect. The Hermetic scholar, Manly Palmer Hall speculates on the etymology of the symbolic rose of the Rosicrucians derived from Ras, wisdom or Ros, dew which recall Rasayana,the Ayurve dic science of longevity involving alchemically produced herbal an d metallic medicines but more specifically \"rasum\", the nectar of immortality produced in the brain. Normally this secretion is d estroyed by normal body function but yogic manipulations such as the h eadstand and kerchari mudra preserve and cultivate this substanc e. During kerchari mudra, the tongue, artificially len gthened over years of ardent discipline inserts back and up into the n asal passage to block the normal flow of rasum. Such a practice is though t to function like the golden fleece to preserve health and even resto re lost youth."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The greatest Hindu sages write about the spiritual accomplishment of Gnosis using the metaphor of the philosopher's ston e. Jnaneshwar (1275-1296) certainly one of the foremost saints of the past millennium wrote an exquisite commentary on the Bha gavad Gita, Hinduism's central scripture. He composed this work at the age of fourteen, without formal education by direct knowle dge resulting from Divine grace. He describes with unparalleled d epth the symptoms of bodily transformation effected by the y ogic process of spiritual awakening. His commentary contains no les s than 17 references to the philosopher's stone that explicit ly transmutes base metal into gold. Often these references describe th e way divine grace transforms its recipient. The seventh century South Indian sage, Thirumoolar in his classic, Thirumandiram , an esoteric masterpiece of 3000 verses, explains man's path to immortal divinity. In verse 2709 he d eclares that the name of God, Siva, is an alchemical vehicle that tu rns the body into immortal gold. His poetry resonates with the deathl ess nature of spiritual attainment. Another great South Indian saint, Ramalinga Swamiga l (1823-1874) dissolved his perfected body into blinding white li ght just as another earlier sage, Manickavasagar had done in the sevent h century. As a child Ramalingar delivered brilliant scriptural dis courses and commentaries without any formal education. He too c laimed direct knowledge bestowed by divine grace. In his classic testimony, The Divine Song of Grace , Ramalinga describes the transmutation of his dense physical body into a body of light: \"Oh God! The Eternal Love, just to bestow upon me t he golden body, You, Universal Love, have merged with my heart, allowing yourself to be infused in me. Oh Supreme Love, You with the Light of Grace have a lchemised my body\". Canto 6, Chapter 1, Verse 480 This verse resounds with the import of the gesture of alchemical projection where a minute quantity of the philosoph er's stone transmutes molten base metal into gold. Ramalinga's body cast no shadow and attempts to photograph him revealed only his clothing."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The esoteric level of such accomplishment defies an y attempt at vain academic analysis. So too, a deeper understanding of the quest of Jaso n and the Argonauts defies the limit of ivory tower scholarsh ip. The golden fleece beckons to every man as a road map of the so ul's origin and ultimate destiny. Exhaustive study of the map will always be an optional first step. Genuine accomplishment emerges only when we take up the quest and join Jason on his hero's jour ney.

THE HERMETIC PATH by Author Unknown When the call of spiritual evolution is strong enou gh, ordinary life among the masses becomes less than enough. One begins to see the activities and motives of himself and others as meaningless trappings, caught in the ebb and flow of nature. We wonder how we have gotten so caught up in pursui ng things that we don't really want. It may begin to dawn that there is a w ay out of this twilight existence, and subsequently there is a quiet call to action. T he way that one charts, if he is brave enough to heed the silent voice, will always be of his own choice. There are many systems that aid in spiritual self discovery, and some pitfalls as well. This paper concerns the Hermetic path, the general appro ach of the Western Esoteric Tradition."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The discipline of the path of Hermes is aided by ac tivity that is very formal and heavily aided by structure. There are definite rule s set down, presumably by those who have made it through the discipline, and they a re followed meticulously. It therefore involves particularly intellectual study and formal ritual. Picture as an example here the magician, such as Faust, in his st udy, conducting scientific experiments. The idea is that the appearance and su bstance of this world are not to be ignored but can be so structured and utilized as to steer one toward inner experience of the Divine. The intellect is used sci entifically to mold and reshape unenlightened and misguided perceptions. Naturally this requires a teacher who has already m ade some success for himself on the path. Otherwise the aspirant would at first be flying blind, having only vague and misguided notions about what to do. He wo uld likely just stumble blindly in the dark , following advice from both cr edible and bogus sources, not making much progress. Unlike the Mystic, the Hermetic practitioner does n ot abstain from participating in the outside world of physical laws and other illusi ons. He instead uses them to steer a course toward inner realization. On the Her metic path, a person's natural ability to organize the mateiral world with symbols is used as a tool to bring about enlightenment. That which is frequently regarded as evil and illus ion by mystics, the world we create with our five senses, is consciously shaped and utilized with symbolic correspondences to create a vehicle of consciousnes s. Habits formed and modes of perceiption established are actually experienced as a structure that extends beyond the physical realm. This \"chariot,\" so to speak, ca rries the aspiring ceremonial magician to his goal. Symbolism The ability to symbolize is the key factor for the path of Hermes. As the Golden Dawn's Neophyte ritual says, \"By names and images a re all powers awakened and re-awakened.\" Symbols properly ustilized point beyo nd themselves into a realm where symbolism and thought are inapplicable. From this realm comes the magician's power, and likewise the power that perpe tuates the physical realm. The magician uses symbolism to tap into this realm and then checks his symbols at the door. Once contact is made, his tools can be dispen sed with if desired. The big question is: What would we see if the abili ty to symbolize were not operative? If we didn't attach significance to occu rrences in our environment via labels, meaning, conditioned responses, and associa tions, how would they appear to us? If we discard our opinions, notions, and ass ociations regarding things seen, what then do we see? The same thing? A seamless who le? Nothing? This can be a very difficult question to answer, and yet it is es sential that anyone on a spiritual"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"path be able to eventually do just that, to see and experience without symbolizing, conceptualizing, and compartmentalizing their world . When this is possible, at least in some shaky fashi on, then true knowledge of how the world is created begins to emerge. The magician discovers that perception is the foundation of his reality. All forms are mental forms, whether they be physical, imagined, or seemingly independent spiritual entiti es. That which we experience when we turn off our autom atic ability to symbolize is really not conceivable in verbal consciousness. Tha t's why mystics end up rambling, why Quantum physicists end up spouting po etry, and why Hermeticists come up with bizarre occult systems which are of li ttle use to anyone but themselves. But still, this being a Hermetic paper, we will here use the word \"Chaos\" for the time being in order to label what c annot be labeled (As the Hermeticist does, we will using verbal \"training wh eels\" until we do not need them anymore). When one is able to set aside the natural human abi lity to symbolize, one experiences reality face to face, and it's appearan ce is chaos. It is devoid of categories, labels, and verbal boxes. It has no bar rier and no structure--at least not in any way that we are able to comprehend--and ther efore, for our purposes here, we call it Chaos. Why would the Hermeticist, so well known for his us e of labels, be fond of setting them aside? One answer is that when one actually do es this, he gains the realization that his symbolizing ability is extreme ly powerful. It only is required that he use it consciously. For most people this ab ility is unrecognised and seemingly independent of the personality. It create s a threatening reality for them. Like the fundamentalist who sees sexual images in D isney cartoons, they may end up blaming others for things that they themselves a re responsible for perceiving. Statements like, \"You make me feel. . . ,\" are typi cal of people who do not claim their own perception of others as an ability that i s under their own control. The Hermeticist works with this ability consciously and therefore discovers that his own happiness is largely under his influence. Using a reference with the knowledge that it isn't real, makes for great power , because he can move without fear of loss. Since nothing in the mind is real, th en nothing that he perceives can be lost. Since there is nothing to loose, he can creat e anything he needs (since it doesn't exist anyway). One discovers that all aroun d is a sea of chaos and pure potentiality, waiting for him to organize and shape it via symbolism and mental frameworks into a reality that expresses ones innat e happiness. This is a key point. The magician stops believing i n the world he creates. He no longer takes so seriously the thoughts that ramble through his mind. The thoughts are the creators of his reality, but they are not t he reality itself. One of the most effective ways to be miserable is for him to believ e them. One of the most effective"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"ways to be miserable is to believe the words that c ome out of his own mouth or out of the mouths of others. So he simply stops. Verbal consciousness, one of the mediums of symboli sm, is very often mistaken for the reality to which it refers. It is only a mi rror and therefore a tool. In other words, the map is not the territory. It can take mu ch, much work on a spiritual path to finally turn this indicative axiom into a true r ealization. Once we realize through and through that the map of reality in our heads is not the reality to which it refers, we are more free to change that map and use it more effectively. We work from the inside out instead of from the outside in. Rather t han waiting for our physical world to change our reality map for us, we change o ur reality map at will. Why wait for permission? Just do it. This point is so obvious that it is almost ludicrou s to mention it, but still, time and time again, we find ourselves miserable because we habitually mistake our personal versions of the universe for the universe itself. Imagine the frustration inherent in such a scheme. But then again we don't have to imagine it--we know what it is like. So why do we do it? The best answer we can give her e is that it is a natural ability to create imaginative frameworks in our minds that represent reality. It is an ability that is almost always up and running because the fi ve senses, its chief assets, are constantly at work. Out of habit we continuously al low our senses to create miniturized versions of reality in our own minds. I t is virtually unavoidable to stop this from happening, and there is no reason to loat he it or to utterly stop it. This automatic symbolizing and perceiving is the ch ief instrument we use to cause suffering for ourselves, but that doesn't mean that it inherently causes suffering. In reality it is the unconscious misuse of the ability that causes suffering, nothing more. The task of the spiritual aspirant is to see through the phantasm of his own reality-map, to catch himself in the act of creatin g it, and to consciously take control of the ability to do so. With training, he changes from a man whose map is created by external conditions into a man whose rea lity map is changed by his own will. When that will is free of conditioning, when the map in his head no longer controlled by physical cercumstance, but it is cont rolled by the inner Will. He is empowered to create his own beliefs, symbols, and m aps--and correspondingly to create his own reality! I have mentioned above that the ability to symboliz e is almost always active. So if it is, then what are we doing with it now, right at this moment? Look at people around you. Look at the local government, the news, TV commercials, and coworkers. Look at yourself. Do you like what we ar e collectively creating? Do the people around you enjoy the world in which they are participating? Another question: If our own faculties are constantly at wo rk in our lives creating an overall unhappy scheme, who is in control of those facultie s? Who is running the show? It"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"is like a runaway phenomena, the reigns of which ar e dangling. It is a power unharnessed, undirected by the one who is gifted wi th it. We are left at the whim of undirected forces whirling in the ebb and flow of n ature. Science With the advent of science, and the scientific meth od, the world was introduced full-force to the essence of Hermeticism. The scien tific method involves formulating explanations of how things happen--mirr ors of reality--testing them thoroughly, and then adjusting or discarding them b ased on the evidence. In other words, it acknowledges that we all have versions of reality up and running in our minds, but it mandates that we test and adjust them to be more accurate and to get them to yield desirable results. Imagine turning th is amazing discipline toward the goal of happiness and spiritual attainment. That is the Hermetic path. It is not surprising that our world today barely at all uses the scientific method for spiritual pursuits. It is usually instead geared to ward just the physical life, toward creating utopia exclusively on Earth. This world is full of luxury and conveniences that modern technology have provided. We try to enj oy these fruits of science, but there is always something nagging us from within. T he real issues are continuously unaddressed. The resulting uneasiness is the result of trying to escape from problems by avoiding them or suppressing them--by f ixing the outsides of things rather than dealing with the behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and complexes that create them. Just look at Western medicine. It speaks almo st completely in terms of the suppression of symptoms, discomfort and suffering. Anti-depressants, anti- histamines, anti-inflammatory, anti-etc.. The downfall of science as it is currently practice d is that it almost never uses its discipline to delve deeply into how ailments emerge . It tends to ignore how we create our reality with our beliefs and correspondi ng behaviors. What good does it do you to combat physical suffering if, at the same time, you are still creating it? Worse yet, the very things that need science applie d to them--beliefs, complexes, and behaviors--are the very things that are in char ge of scientific pursuits. Not surprisingly, the world is filled with high tech we apons and drugs that numb us to reality. What we do with modern science pales in si gnificance to what the original inventors of the scientific method intended for it. We put it in the service of desires and needs which do not produce a desirable reality. In other words, the world we are creating today with science is largely created by our own demons. When you do not take ownership of your ability to create you r own version of reality, that ability fall into that hands of psychological compl exes. Fear and desire are still the strongest motives for research and progress. As individuals, it is up to each one of us to break this chain. Before we use our Hermetic abilities to create a \"comfortable\" life f or ourselves here on the physical, we must first use it to weed out those things in ou r own personal programming that"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"are blindly causing us suffering. If we cannot do t his, then the awesome power of science falls into the hands of our blind, infantil e subconscious complexes. The first step then is to find a system of symbols which encompasses and explains our demons and how they arise. That way, they can b e dealt with. There are many such schemes of the cosmos. The Golden Dawn, for in stance, uses the Kabbalah and the Tree of Life as a map of the interior make- up of man. The Glyph of the Tree charts the recesses of his body, mind, and spi rit supposedly all the way to the source of existence. Placing symbols on this diagra m he can personally identify how his mind works by how the symbols relate to eac h other. He discovers painfully how he creates suffering for himself. He applies symbols and various symbolic techniques, such as in ritual, to restruct ure his interior and exterior make- up. Gradually, with the assistance of a teacher, he undoes the automatic complexes that hold prisoner his creativity. Hermes/Mercury A way to better get a handle on our ability to perc eptualize is to recognize this faculty with a new label. Let's call it Mercury. We will use both the planet and god, Mercury, to delineate what it is we are talking abo ut. Mercury is a agile god who represents the power of the intellect. Under Mercur y comes the mind, mediation, transmission, and translation--mental and nervous p rocesses, speech and writing, dexterity, ambivalence, and the distribution of ene rgies. Mercury is superficial. It is the moving ego mind that is capable of knowing abou t things externally. It shapes itself to whatever subject or stimulus is presented before it, creating therefrom all kinds of corresponding conclusions and belief syste ms in the blink of an eye. Likewise, the chameleon quality of Mercury, the pla net, makes it take on whatever zodiac sign it is in and enhance it with intelligen ce. Moreover, if it is close to another planet in a chart it will adopt that planet s function and add a sharpness to it. Mercury represents the mutable aspects of man's nature. It is the intelligence that is book-learned. It covers its subjects, but it doe s not really live them or become one with them. By its very nature of superficiality and ability to cover things, our Mercury-nature is the very thing which lies to us a bout reality. Because it so readily assumes the shape of our experiences, creat ing dysfunctional maps of reality based on them, it is the very thing that ke eps us isolated and apart from creation. Our experiences prod our Mercurial intell igence and fashion from it beliefs, complexes, fears, and patterns of behavior that keep us locked up in the fantasy world of the ego. It is interesting to note that the Sephirah that corresponds to Mercury is Hod whose virtue is truth and whose v ice is falsehood. Our maps of reality may be truthful and serve us well or they m ay be deceitful and lead us time and again into suffering. We have a choice. The god Mercury is regarded as the psychopompus, th e soul conductor of heaven, the messenger of the gods, the instructor and guide to the Hermetic mysteries."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Thought of as an initiator into occult schools, esp ecially ritualistic ones involving full ceremonial. Our Mercurial quality when properl y utilized becomes not an imprisoning pattern but a vehicle by which we exper ience deeper and more liberated states of consciousness. Language Hermes Trismegistus, a historical/mythical magus th at is identified with both the gods Thoth and Mercury, is fancifully celebrated as the inventor of language and writing. Language is the biggest and foremost outgr owth of the hermetic mind. Some say that human beings have a natural instinct to form language. What would humans be like without language? It is a lmost impossible to say, since we would imagine it most likely by using concepts a nd mental descriptions involving language. Language has the power to shape our mercurial mind in a way that allows us to create fixed areas or concepts. C oncepts help us to organized knowledge, to pull facts together in meaningful way s which explain things. We all develop, knowingly or unknowingly, conceptual frame works which help us understand the world. Language is a Hermetic skill very much mis-used by the unenlightened mind. We tend to actually believe words as if they were the very object to which they refer. We tend to actually believe the things that we say. The Mercurial mind is so mutable that it jumps to conclusions based on very little experience. We start saying things like \"Men are pigs!\" or \"He always. . .\" and we end up believing it. We end up treating ourselves and others accordingly , running into misunderstandings and conflicts when our word-versions of reality do not match with experience. The next man you meet may have bru te-like qualities mixed with a very gentle, artistic soul. But will you notice, if \"Men are pigs.\"? On the Hermetic path to enlightenment, the aspirant develops what S. I. Hayakawa calls extensional orientation . Extensional orientation is the state of mind that is prone to use words that refer to the environment wi thout any interpretations or judgments about it. It maintains language reflectin g the environment, rather than language imposing meanings on things and then wrest ling with the meanings as if they were the things themselves. There are no such things as good and bad, nigger or Jew. There are no such things as human being and love. No such things as angels and demons. There is just what is and the la bels we use to get by. Nothing more. And, of course, that which actually is cannot be conveyed by speech or image or label. It can only be referred to in that way by the Hermetic mind, and then that which is beyond mind will do the rest. So, by employing language to refer to that which is beyond language, we are on the Hermetic path. The activity of the mind is turned a gainst itself. It examines itself and modifies its ability to perceive. It undoes its elf so that that which is beyond it can become the locus of control. The ego relinquish es its position and becomes an"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"aggregate of biological and psychological traits ce ntered, as it were, around the influence of that which is beyond the known. The mind finally then matures and becomes humble. T he mature mind knows that words never say all about anything, and such a mind is therefore adjusted to uncertainty. Whatever challenges the world thrusts upon us, we are then at least free from those of our own making. THOTH AND HERMETICISM IN CHRISTIANITY Copyright © 2003, Michael Claire S tudies in comparative religion, pioneered by such s cholars as Gerald Massey, have yielded a wealth of data connecting Eg yptian mythology and mysticism to Christianity, demonstrat ing that the former contributed a great deal to the latter. Natu rally, most research has focused upon mythology involving Osiris, Isis, Horus, and Ra. This has been for good reason – these chief deities of ancient Egypt provide a firm, and in many cases detailed, underpi nning of Christian mythology. However, rather than dwell upon these fi gures, about whom so much has been written in terms of compariti ve mythology, we shall turn to a lesser-discussed (although still a very prominent) Egyptian god, Thoth. In actuality, we will concentr ate upon a late Hellenistic version of Thoth – Hermes Trismegistus – who represents Thoth amalgamated with the early Hellenistic figure of Hermes. While doing so, we shall explore many parallels bet ween traditions involving Thoth (principally as Hermes Trismegistus ) and Christian mythology. This will suggest that the Hermetic trad ition contributed a number of elements to Christianity, as the latter e merged. Given the complexity of comparitive studies in general, worse ned considerably by the antiquity of the period and the massive loss of documentation, it will be virtually impossible to ‘prove’ that Chr istianity directly lifted elements from the Hermetic system. Rather, t his article is merely an exploration, hopefully adding to the gene ral intellectual milieu of thought and discussion, and providing som e possible directions for further research. Thoth and Hermes Trismegistus In ancient Egypt, Thoth was the god of wisdom and w riting; through being identified with Hermes by the Greeks, he evol ved into Hermes Trismegistus. Thoth is described as a scribe and me ssenger of the gods, and in this capacity is usually shown as a ma n with the head of an ibis. 1 Owing to the sapiential and scribal nature of Thot h, a large"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"number of books were attributed to Hermes Trismegis tus, thus adding to the corpus of “Hermetic literature.” In addition to the ibis image, the hawk’s head was also associated with Thoth. The idea of a winged spirit messenger is comparable to the Holy Spirit i n the form of a dove, acting as a heavenly messenger at Jesus’ bapt ism, and also as the Paraclete offering testimony (John 16:7-8, 13-1 4). According to Egyptian mythology, Thoth had another important role: Thoth ... was frequently represented recording impo rtant proceedings, such as at the ‘Weighing of the Heart’ ceremony whi ch was believed to take place after death. 2 The “weighing of the heart,” or similar judgement, appeared within, and may have been partly subsumed by, the Isian-Sop hian tradition. The transferral of motifs from Thoth/Hermes to Soph ia would be quite natural, since both were “wisdom” deities. Alluding to the way in which such transferral can easily take place, Dr St ephan Hoeller explains: Who, then, actually wrote the “books of Hermes,” wh ich, since their rediscovery in the fifteenth century, have played s uch a significant role in our culture? The writings are all anonymous : their mythic author is considered to be Hermes himself. The reas oning behind this pseudonymous approach is simple. Hermes is Wisdom, and thus anything written through the inspiration of true wi sdom is in actuality written by Hermes. The human scribe does not matter ; certainly his name is of no significance. 3 The “weighing of the heart” or similar near-death j udgement issues, associated as they were with the Goddess (Isian-Sop hian) tradition, naturally reappeared under the guise of Marian inte rcession (as in the Roman Catholic Hail Mary: “Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.”) Thoth’s role as an intercessor is n oted by Dr. Hoeller: Thoth ... was the principal pleader for the soul at the judgment of the dead. 4 The notion of an intercessor in death is often mirr ored by the idea of intervention in sickness, i.e. healing. Since Thoth was regarded as a wise deity of learning, naturally he became associa ted with the arts, and with sciences (including medicine). Spells and healing were also"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"identified with Isis (and later with Mary; to this day Christians attend Marian shrines, seeking healing), and it is possibl e that the Alexandrian Therapeutae (i.e. “Healers”) – who vene rated Isis or at least the “Queen of Heaven” (cf. Jeremiah 44:17-19) – borrowed spells, chants, etc. from the Isian tradition, whic h could easily have encompassed a healing tradition stemming from Thoth . In the latter regard, the legendary healer Asclepius is closely a ssociated with Hermetic literature. And certainly, if Eusebius’ cl aim that the Therapeutae were the earliest Christians is accurat e, the existence of a closely-associated Hermetic medical tradition would help explain early Christianity’s intense interest in miraculous healing. Like Hermetic healing in relation to the Isian-Mari an tradition, the motif of the winged “Mercurial” messenger spirit, a ssociated with Thoth/Hermes, was also apparently subsumed, in this case being identified with the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, the dove, and to a lesser extent, Mary. Alluding to Thoth’s link to the Parac lete, Dr. Hoeller notes that “Thoth was also the teacher and helper of the ancient Egyptian trinity of Isis, Osiris,and Horus.”(emphas is added) 5 Likewise, providing a link from Mary to the Paracle te (and hence to Thoth), the Coptic Liturgy of St. Basil, used by th e Coptic Orthodox church in Egypt, preserves a reference to Mary as “ the fair dove.” The possibility that Mary attracted symbols and motifs previously associated with Thoth/Hermes is enhanced by Hermes’ mother being named Maia; 6 there may also be a link to the mother of Adonis, Myrrha, whose mythology is Syrian (n.b. that Ignatius, from this region, is one of the earliest Christian letter-wri ters to mention Mary). The goddess Isis, often seen as a ‘proto-Mary,’ may have facilitated the transferral of aspects of Thoth/Hermes to Mary, since Thoth helped Isis resurrect the slain Osiris. 7 Thoth’s role as a scribe – and recorder of judgemen t proceedings – is echoed in Revelation 20:12-15 and 21:27, where the Lamb (representing Christ) apportions judgement based up on records in his “book of life.” In addition to the Christological e lements, Thoth/Hermes (like Christ) was identified by Greeks with “God” himself, since the name Theos derives from Theuth/Thoth. Addressing both this derivation, and a variety of primitive Ch ristological motifs, Dr. Everard states:"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The titles appropriated to HERMES MERCURIUS TRISMEG ISTUS were, in part, the titles of the DEITY. THEUTH, THO TH, TAUT, TAANTES, are the same title diversified, and they b elong to the chief god of Egypt. Eusebius speaks of him as HERMES. Fro m Theuth the Greeks formed QEOS, or Theos, which with that natio n was the general name of the Deity. Plato, in his treatise n amed “Philebus,” mentions him by the name of Qeuq, or Theuth. He was looked upon as a great benefactor, and the first cultivator of the vine. ... In one hand Hermes holds the crux ansata, the symbol of life—a master symbol which is the most persistent and dete rmined in its appearance (and in its re-appearance) in all the sc ulptures of Egypt :— in the other hand the figure grasps a staff, associ ated with which are a serpent, a scorpion, a hawk’s head, and above all a circle surrounded by an asp, each with its special symbolical signifi cance. ... The T, Tau, was the instrument of death, but it was also what Ezekiel ordered the people in Jerusalem to be marked with, who were to be saved from the destroyer. It was also the emblem of the Taranis or the Thoth, or Teutates, or TAT, or Hermes, or Buddha am ong the druids. It was called the Crux Hermis. The old Hebrew, the Bastulan, and the Pelasgian, have the letter Tau thus,—X ; the Etrusca n, + × ; the Coptic, + ; the Punic, ÉÌ ÉÌ. [emphasis original] 8 In the above passage, Dr. Everard mentions a number of motifs that have Christological applications. Like Thoth/Hermes , Jesus is associated with the vine (John 15:1), and the alleg edly life-saving cross – a clear inheritance from the crux ansata or ankh (the symbol of life), and the Tau – the latter of which, as Dr. Everard notes, was a symbol of death, and often took the form of a cross . Thus the ankh /Tau/cross, and the Crux Hermis, simultaneously encompassed motifs of life, death, and accordingly, rebirth. In Christian mythology, birth and death motifs are prominent: the nativity of Jesus continues to fascinate Christians, at least as much as his death /resurrection. The rebirth process is pictured by Jesus’ baptism in th e Jordan (cf. John 3:3-5). A more opaque aspect of the above passage deals wit h the relationship between Thoth, the scorpion, and Jesus. The scorpio n motif – owing to the scorpion’s tail – was viewed as a ‘backbiter ’ or betrayer, and is suggestive of an archetypal Judas-figure. Thus, all uding to the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"scorpion’s sting, Jesus describes Judas as one who has “lifted up his heel against me.” (John 13:18) Since the name Judas means “twin,” from an allegorical perspective Judas is Jesus’ ‘ev il twin’ or his darker/lower self, sometimes identified with Satan (cf. Luke 22:3; Matthew 16:23). In the quotation above, Dr. Everard mentions some a dditional motifs. Like Thoth/Hermes, Jesus has a staff or sceptre (Ps alm 2:9; Revelation 12:5); similarly, an early catacomb pain ting depicts Jesus with a wand, raising Lazarus. 9 (John 11) Also, with regard to the serpent/asp motif, although this motif has come to be frequently associated with the Devil, the Jesus figure has ser pentine connotations. Referring to the copper healing serpe nt made by Moses (in Numbers 21:9), John 3:14 declares: “And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of m an be lifted up.” Moses – who is often viewed as a “type” of Jesus – links together the staff and serpent motifs: his first miracle is turn ing his staff into a snake (Exodus 4:2-4). The parallel between Moses an d Jesus is often underlined by both functioning as high priests or m ediators. Regarding such a mediatorial role (as well as the C hristological “first- born” status), Dr. Everard presents the chief Scand inavian god, Thor, as being derived from Thoth, and notes that “THOR i s represented as the first-born of the SUPREME GOD, and is styled in the Edda ‘the eldest of Sons.’ ... He was esteemed in Scandinavia as a middle divinity, a mediator between God and man.”(emphasis original) 10 This appears to derive from Hermes as a Mercurial ‘go-be tween,’ and hence also a ‘mediator.’ Dr. Hoeller elucidates upo n this role: While Hermes is regarded as one of the earliest and most primitive gods of the Greeks, he enjoys so much subsequent pr ominence that he must be recognized as an archetype devoted to media ting between, and unifying, the opposites. This foreshadows his l ater role as master magician and alchemist, as he was regarded both in Egypt and in Renaissance Europe. ... [Similarly,] Thoth acted as an emissary between the contending armies of Horus and Seth and eventually came to negotiate the peace treaty between these tw o gods. His role as a mediator between the opposites is thus made evide nt, perhaps prefiguring the role of the alchemical Mercury as t he “medium of the conjunction.” 11 Hermes Trismegistus and the Divine Pymander"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Divine Pymander of Hermes Trismegistus is a major source of Hermetic teachings, and incorporates sapiential tra ditions, mysticism, and philosophical views akin to Neoplatonism. Its s tyle and contents bear a striking similarity to many of the texts dis covered at Nag Hammadi, indicating that the Christian Gnostic trad ition, in Egypt, evolved from, or coalesced with, an earlier Hermeti c tradition. The extent to which the Hermetic writings preserve pre- Hellenic, Egyptian teachings specifically associated with Thoth is dif ficult to determine; nevertheless, “Hermes Trismegistus” offers some ass urance of continuity in the Divine Pymander (IV:1): this day it is fit to dedicate [this speech] to Tat [Thoth], because it is an Epitome of those general Speeches which were spo ken to him. Issues of continuity in the Hermetic tradition, and similar problems of analysis, are considerably worsened by the destruct ion of many Hermetic writings. Dr Hoeller observes: The original number of Hermetic writings must have been considerable. A good many of these were lost during the systematic destruction of non-Christian literature that took p lace between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D. ... Church Father C lement of Alexandria says that the books of Hermes treat of E gyptian religion; and Tertullian, Iamblichus, and Porphyry all seem t o be acquainted with Hermetic literature. 12 Another problem in analysis is that Hermeticism was a secret tradition. As instructed in the Divine Pymander: Avoid all conversation with the multitude or common people; for I would not have thee subject to Envy, much less to b e ridiculous unto the many. ... it behoveth to avoid the multitude, a nd take heed of them as not understanding the virtue and power of the th ings that are said. [I:83-5] Likewise, Jesus instructs his disciples concerning secret teachings, not to be revealed to the “common people” (whom Jesus r efers to as “dogs” and “swine”): Do not give what is holy to dogs, neither throw you r pearls before swine, that they may never trample them underfoot, then turn around"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"and rip you open. ... Many are called, but few chos en. [Matthew 7:6; 22:14] To you is has been granted to know [ gn ō nai ] the mysteries [ myst ē ria ] of the kingdom of God, but for the rest it is in pa rables, in order that, though looking, they look in vain, and though heari ng, they may not comprehend. [Luke 8:10] Evidently, whatever these “mysteries” are, Jesus do es not want them preached unto the “ends of the earth.” Here, Jesus is speaking as a Hermetic sage, teaching secrets to his inner circle of followers. Thoth/Hermes as the Word, or Logos As a divine messenger, Thoth/Hermes becomes associa ted with the idea of the divine Word (the Logos), the Mind of Go d, God’s image or manifestation, and the “Son of God.” In the Divine Pymander, the Mind of God speaks: I am that Light, the Mind, thy God ... and that bri ght and lightful Word from the mind is the Son of God. ... That whic h in thee seeth and heareth, the Word of the Lord, and the Mind the Father, God, differ not one from the other; and the union of the se is Life. [II:8-9] Later, we read: But the Father of all things, the Mind being Life a nd Light, brought forth Man like unto himself, whom he loved as his p roper Birth; for he was all beauteous, having the image of his Father. ... Holy is God, the Father of all things. ... Holy art thou, that by th y Word hast established all things. Holy art thou, of whom all Nature is th e Image. [II:18; 86- 90] Such expressions are very reminiscent of the views of Philo, who was very probably exposed to some form of Hermetic trad ition. Of course, the above-mentioned concepts of the Word’s identity with God, the Word being the creative agency of God, the Word bei ng the “Son of God,” and the Word’s “Life” and “Light” being refle cted as a divine quality in humanity, all reappear at the beginning of the Gospel of John. This strongly suggests that the writer of thi s gospel was familiar with some form of Hermetic tradition. (The frequent references to the Gospel of John, in the present article, provide fur ther clues as to Hermetic influences in the Johannine tradition.)"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"As John’s gospel continues, the writer refers to Jo hn the Baptist as bearing witness or offering proclamation concerning the “light.” Elsewhere, John is the voice “crying out” in the wi lderness, who instructs his hearers to get baptized. Similarly, t he Divine Pymander mentions, along with a “Cup” motif (which is both E ucharistic and representative of the baptismal font): Filling a large Cup or Bowl therewith, [God] sent i t down, giving also a Cryer or Proclaimer. And he commanded him to proc laim these things to the souls of men. Dip and wash thyself, t hou that art able in this Cup or Bowl: Thou that believeth that thou sha lt return to him that sent this Cup; thou that acknowledgest whereun to thou wert made. As many, therefore, as understood the Proclam ation, and were baptized, or dowsed into the Mind, these were made partakers of knowledge, and became perfect men, receiving the Mi nd. [XII:13-16] Closely echoing the latter part of this passage, Jo hn’s gospel records: But as many as did receive him [the Word / the ligh t], to them he gave authority to become children of God, because they w ere believing in his name; and they were born, not from blood or fro m man’s will, but from God. [1:12-13] Providing more detail on the original, Hermetic bap tismal tradition, Dr. Hoeller states: The Hermeticists had their own sacraments as well. These appear to have consisted primarily of a form of baptism with water and an anointing resembling “a baptism and a chrism” as me ntioned in the Gnostic Gospel of Philip. The Corpus Hermeticum mentions an anointing with “ambrosial water” and a self-adminis tered baptism in a sacred vessel, the krater, sent down by Hermes from the heavenly realms. 13 Thoth/Hermes and the Sign of the Fish The idea of baptism, since it involves being “born of water,” naturally invokes the image of a fish – just as early Christi ans symbolized Christ using the ichthus (fish) symbol – also known as the vesica piscis (sign of the fish). As noted by Freke & Gandy, 14 the vesica piscis symbol was well known to the Pythagoreans, who form ed it by intersecting two circles so that the circumference of each touches the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"centre of the other circle. (Measurements based on these two circles then produce the sacred ratio 153:265; interestingl y, the number 153 is specifically mentioned in relation to fish, at J ohn 21:11.) The two intersecting circles were seen as a unification of spirit and matter – as echoed in the simultaneous “human and divine” natur e of Christ, and in the idea that the soul/spirit has entered into ( or, become entombed in) flesh, or in Nature. Thanks to Hermes Trismegis tus, the Divine Pymander gives a complex account of divinity ‘separating’ in to seven primal Circles (emanated aspects of divinity) to ac hieve self-reflective Gnosis, and apparently recognizing the vesica piscis or fish shape – representing humanity’s inherent divinity – now for med within the intersecting Circles, or, like fish, “in the Water” : For indeed God was exceedingly enamoured of his own form or shape, and delivered unto it all his own Workmanshi ps. ... he considered the Operations or Workmanships of the Se ven; but they loved him, and every one made him partaker of his o wn order. And he learning diligently, and understanding their Essenc e, and partaking their Nature, resolved to pierce through the Circum ference of the Circles, and to understand the power of him that si ts upon the Fire. And having already all power ... [he] peeped throug h the Harmony, and breaking through the strength of the Circles, s o shewed and made manifest the downward-born Nature, the fair and bea utiful Shape or Form of God. ... he smiled for love, as if he had s een the shape or likeness in the Water, or the shadow upon the Earth , of the fairest Human form. And seeing in the Water a Shape, a Shap e unto himself, in himself he loved it, and would cohabit with it . .. Nature presently laying hold of what it so much loved, did wholly wr ap herself about it, and they were mingled, for they loved one another. And from this cause Man above all things that live upon earth is double: Mortal, because of his body, and Immortal, because of the s ubstantial Man. For being immortal, and having power of all things, he yet suffers mortal things, and such as are subject to Fate or D estiny. [II:19-26] Rethinking Early Christianity The way ‘traditional’ Christianity (that is, Christ ianity as modified and promoted by the Roman Church from the time of I renaeus) has been presented would lead us to think that the proc ess of its development was one of progressive enlargement and deepening of theology. This view begins with the simple life and maxims of Jesus,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"as recorded in the canonical gospels, and then expa nds into the theological musings of Paul, to be advanced by the ante-Nicene Fathers, and to blossom into the fully-developed th eology of Augustine et al. However, the discovery that Paul’s letters are the earliest canonical writings began to destabilize th is picture within scholarly circles. Pauline theology emerges as if s uddenly, as a complex and profound edifice of theological specula tion; some years later (up to a century later, according to some lib eral scholars) gospels of “Jesus’ life” emerge – and there is no evidence that Paul knew of any such gospels (indeed, many scholars have conclu sively determined that he cannot possibly have been aware of them, nor could he have relied upon some much-touted “oral” b iography of Jesus, which is clearly wishful thinking on the par t of certain orthodox scholars). What is strange here is that Christianit y, far from blossoming from simple sayings and traditions into a complex and profound theological system, appears to be evolving backwards (i.e. devolving): first the sophisticated theology, then the simple ‘wise teachings’ of the Master, a few details of his life , and so on. Of course, the written gospel tradition did develop – but was this a matter of progress, or a case of acute romanticizing, wher e the profound theological musings of Paul et al gave way to romantic fictions about Jesus, replete with dazzling miracles to entertain the pious, ignorant masses? Many liberal scholars are, nowadays, leaning toward s the latter outlook. With the discovery of the Nag Hammadi gosp els in the twentieth century, the traditional picture is falli ng apart; every indication is that, at the earliest stage, Christia nity was a profound, complex, metaphysical system. However, with the pas sage of time, “votes” by unenlightened bishops as to what the tru th should be, and the intervention of politics in particular, Christi anity collapsed into a puerile system of blind faith in mythology, unquest ioning appeal to human authority, belief in sacramental magic, and s uperstitions involving such things as virginity, rubbing crucifi xes, and worrying about when to eat fish. (So much for the vesica piscis... ) Hermeticism, as previously discussed, provides anot her dimension to our understanding of the rise (or, fall ) of Christianity; like its counterpart, Gnosticism, Hermeticism reflects an ad vanced stage in late Hellenistic thought. But, like Gnosticism, Her meticism was not to survive (except as a secret, underground movement); forces of"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"ignorance, superstition and fanaticism would wreak havoc upon the sublime, Hellenistic vision, one which had helped c arry the flame of Gnosis from ancient Egypt. Perhaps, like Icarus who flew too near the sun, the Hellenistic vision had become too profound , too complex. In humanity’s desire to reach up and touch the divine, to express the inexpressible, perhaps humanity ‘flew too near the sun,’ and came crashing down. This appears to have happened as onl y the most highly learned and profoundly spiritual individuals could grapple with the sophisticated theology they had developed; increasi ngly, they found themselves in the minority, and subject to persecut ion. The common people, who were largely illiterate, had no toleran ce for theological and philosophical musings; they wanted a scapegod w ho “died for them,” magically washing their sins away. They want ed firm leadership from priests, dressed in colorful finery to titillate the visual faculty – priests who could, with a sacred hand ges ture here, or a flick of magical oil there, expel demons, and bless the f aithful (evidently, even the “atoning blood” of the murdered God incarn ate was not quite enough to assuage the wretched parishioners’ troubl ed consciences). Perhaps most of all, the common people wanted assur ance of a prime location in the Elysian fields; they were not parti cularly interested in knowing God, in touching the face of the divine. It is little wonder, then, that the Christian world descended into a mir e of crass superstition, its citizens barely held in check fro m total anarchy even by the threat of eternal torment. Thus, the Dark Ag es began – a thousand years in which the manifestations of the d ivine human spirit, the most ecstatic heights of philosophy and knowled ge, were eclipsed. A thousand years, in which all noble individuals wh o tried to relight the flame of ancient wisdom were summarily tortured , and executed at the stake. But in the darkness, in secret, enlighte ned monks, nuns and assorted intellectuals – risking their lives at eve ry turn – hid their precious manuscripts, trained apprentices in absolu te secrecy, and helped keep alive the weakened spiritual pulse of h umanity. Those who were found out by the Church often paid the ult imate penalty. However, their sacrifices have not been in vain, fo r the divine human spirit lives on; yet we are mindful of how much has been lost.
