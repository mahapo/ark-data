McGrath Copyright @ 1994 FINBARR INTERNATIONAL Fl74 ,1,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Material Success Practical Magick is designed to change the physical plane, in order to bring it under your 'will'. By using magick, and changing the physical, we can enjoy all the material coinforts that life has to offer. Be it a new car, a bigger house or just fists full ofcash, the occult and magick can bring them to you. Follow my instructions with sincerity and you will not be disappointed. Take your life in your hands, reshape your future, only you have the power to do this. By using confidence and belief you will succeed. There is nothing evil or selfish about wanting the good things in life. Why shouldn't you have a new car? Don't sit around watching other people succeed while you scrape and save just to make 'ends meet'. It's time to take your destiny in both hands and force it in the direction that you wish to go. Study the spells that I give and perform one, or even perform all of them! If you wish for more money choose an adequate sum, asking for five million pounds is only being greedy. Make sure that you truly want the thing that you are performing a spell to get. Sometimes it can take what seems like a long time for a spell to manifest, but be patient and don't lose heart, it once took two months for a particularly delicate spell to manifest for me. 2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Although this has been known to happen on a few other occasions it is not typical, most spells will manifest within two days to about three weeks. Some spells may rnanifest within hours, although this is also rare. So now on to some practical spellwork. Money Spell Decide on a sum of money that would fulfil your immediate financial needs and write it down on a piece of green or white paper. On the back of the paper write your name and your full address, if you have not currently got a permanent address, then write your date of birth. This is to ensure the spirits do not get you mixed up with someone else by the same name. Take the paper and soak it in pure orange juice and then leave it to dry. Once it has dried take it in your hands and place it at your heart. Say aloud: \"I open up this centre and twin my talisman with it.\" Around your heart area there is a psychic centre ofpower known as a Chakra. Your heart Chakra has direct influence over your finances. Place your piece of paper on a table and beside it place an ashtray or even better would be a bowl. Also have a lighter or some matches handy. In a commanding voice call aloud: \"Oh spirits of the lands beyond, come here to me this day. Stretch time and traverse the universe to be here. Spirits of money I call to thee do my bidding, Hear my cry and harken to my words. Money spirits whose power is great, give to me this thing I ask. By the power of the money spirits So Mote It Be!\" Take the paper in your hand and light it at the corner. Once it starts to burn place it in the bowl and wait for it to burn out. Then take the ashes and spread them over your front path or iust outside your front door. It will not be too long before the spirits of money give what you have asked."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Money from the Gods In this next short spell you will be asking two powerful entities to help you in your quest for financial security. This spell is designed to give you increased luck in money matters and will also greatly increase your chances of winning in gambling and games of chance. You are going to call on Ra the mighty God of the sun and Venus the Goddess of love and money. By combining the power of these two omnipotent beings you will be given the'Midas touch'. The spell should be performed on a Friday as early in the day as possible, dawn is the best but any time will do, as long as the sun is still out. This spell should not be performed at night. Stand facing the direction of the sun and call out aloud the following: \"Oh Ra, send down your rays that I may bathe in your glory. Send to me your blessings that from this day forth I may have financial security and all the riches I deserve. Oh lovely Venus hear me call to you. Let me wash away my imperfections with your beauty. Give to me all the money that I wish for and by your power it shall be done. By the mighty God Ra, and by the lovely Goddess Venus It SHAI-L be so.\" Go about your normal business and forget about the spell until the following Sunday. On Sunday perform the spell again in exactly the same way. Constant Cash If you are in a position where you have no income or need a steady flow of money coming to you) then this spell is for you. It will bring money to you on a regular basis, usually every couple of days, although it could bring a large windfall and bring nothing else for about two weeks. For this spell you will need to obtain some spring water' a clear glass and an A,4 (large) size piece of green paper on which you should print clearly \"M M I M\". \"M M I M\" simply stands for \"Money Magnetism Is Mine\". On the back of the paper write your name and on each side of your name draw a picture of your idea of having constant cash, this will take a little imagination on your part. 4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Pour some spring water into your clear glass, lift this high above your head, and looking at it say: \"This water shall purify from the negative energy which stops money from flowing to me. From here on this negativity shall never return.\" Take a drink of the water and repeat the above affirmation. Then drink the rest of the water in one go. Refill the glass and once more hold it above your head saying: \"Ra, fill this glass with the life-force that is yours. Once I have tasted of this life-force and have consumed it, the flow of riches shall once again be mine.\" Once again take a drink of the water and then repeat the above affirmation. After this drink the rest of the water in one go. The spell does not need to be repeated. Passion and Love I Magick, as I have already stated, can cause change to occur in the physical plane. This change can occur on any level, not just material, it can also change your own or another person's emotional state. By causing change to occur in another person's emotions, we can make them hate or love any individual or group of people. That is what this chapter is all about. As I have already said earlier, there is nothing wrong with wanting the good things in life like a new home or car, but you should always seriously consider your motives before undertaking a spell or ritual that will change another person, be it for good or bad. Once you use magick to change a person, you have taken away their free-will in that situation. If you are going to perform a love spell on a girl for instance, you should consider, do you really love her? or is this a passing infatuation? By performing a love spell on the girl in question, you will leave her head over heels for you. Then what would happen if you suddenly found you no longer wanted her after a time? Think carefully before undertaking any spell which affects other people, but if you feel that you cannot live without your dream woman or man, as the case may be, then by all means go ahead."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Love Spell For this spell you will need to go out and pick a fresh rose. Ifthere are no roses, because of the time of year, then any flower will do. Take a pink candle and on it inscribe your name and the name of your prospective partner. Beside the candle place two small pieces of paper, one with your name on it and the other with the name of your prospective lover. Light the candle and say: \"You and I we shall be one, By love's true power this spell's begun. You'lI give your love, I'11 give mine too, By love's true power it cometh true. You'll give your love from thee to me, By love's true power So Mote It Be. Let love and light from in you shine, By love's true power you now are mine.\" Repeat the above spell three times and after every time visualise the woman/man running towards you. At the end of the third time, visualise the person hugging you and hear them say'I love you (state your name) for always'. I.et the candle burn out. Then go outside anywhere where there is soil. Have with you the rose and the pieces of paper. The pieces of paper with your names written on them should be wrapped up, take one of them and crumple it up tightly, and around this wrap the other one. Place this inside the flower and close over its petals. Now dig a small hole and into this place the flower and say: \"As this flower withers so do your defences against me. From this day forth we shall be together in deepest love.\" This spell should not take long to become a reality, but you may have to wait the full length of time that it takes for the flower to wither. Sex Spell There may be a time when you meet a member of the opposite sex and she/he is, to you, incredibly sexy. You find later that this person is 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"much too shallow for you to have a relationship with, therefore a love spell is out of the question. So what do you do? Simply perform a sex spell. This will enable you to have a physical liaison with the person, without getting emotionally involved. For this spell you will need to acquire a red candle and a black one. Upon the black candle inscribe the name of the person and the word 'sex'. IJpon the red candle inscribe the words 'sexual pleasure'. Light both the candles and visualise all your sexual desires coming true with this person. Build up as much passion as you can. Imagine all the sexual pleasure you would have with this person. Say aloud, and with as much sexual desire as you can muster: \"I call upon energies from Mars, To all you spirits of sex and pleasure. Fulfil my wish and make all my sexual desires a reality. Give unto me the pleasures of (state name of desired person), That I may taste of her/his fruits. I shall have my way, for by the power of the spirits of Mars It is so!'? Again, visualise yourself having passionate sex with the person and know that this will become a reality. Now lift the black candle, and with a pin or knife, inscribe the name of your desired lover on it. N7hile doing this try not to let the candle go out. Say: \"Spirits of Fire I have shown you my desire, Now you must bring it to me by the holy name, YUD-HEY-VAH-HEY. By his name the earth shakes and all spirits are at my command, Do this deed then go in peace. SO MOTE IT BE!\" You can now snuff out the candles or you may wish to let them burn down, for you cannot use them again anyway. This spell should manifest very quickly, for the spirits are very good at their job. Expect to see a great deal ofchange in the person's attitude towards you, the next time you meet. The person will go into a sexual heat over you and you may be surprised at how obvious they make it to you."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Personal Magnetism For this spell you will need to buy some essential oil. Any oil that is ruled by Venus will do. Patchouli oil or Ylang-Ylang oil would be a good choice. These oils can be picked up in health shops, and are easily obtainable. The next step is to run a bath with warm water. Make sure the water isn't too warm. Into the bath add some oil, add the oil while the bath is running, a few drops is all you need. Once the bath has been filled, immerse yourself in the water. This will be very relaxing. Now take a cloth and dip it in the water, so that it is fully soaked. With this cloth start at the top half of your body and rub yourself with down strokes. \\While you are doing this imagine that you are washing away all your doubts and troubles. Say aloud in a tone like a robot: \"I wash away all the negative energies which cling to me. I am pure and I am free.\" Once you have finished cleansing your whole body lie back in the bath. Close your eyes and try to picture yourself in the bath, as if you are looking from the ceiling down. Visualise your whole being glowing with a soft green colour. Once you have achieved this, say to yourself: \"From this day forward I shall convey the light of love.\" At this stage you should get out of the bath and iet the water out. lVhile the water slowly disappears down the plug hole, affirm to yourself, that with it goes all your negativity. 'fhe spell is complete and you should allow yourself to dry naturally. You will find that people will start to seek your company and the opposite sex will begin to find you more attractive. The spell should be repeated whenever you feel the need or feel you need a boost of confidence. Breaking Up a Love Affair This spell is designed for the person whose partner is having an affair. I warn you now, be very iareful, this spell should not be used for personal spite, if it were to back-fire you would be very sorry. 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Obtain a piece of clothing from one of the two lovers, it makes no difference which one. Go out and pick a nettle, be careful you don't get stung by it. Place the nettle on the piece of clothing and wrap the cloth around it. Then tie this with a bit of black cord or thread. Take a bowl of water and to this add salt, the water should be heavily salted, once the salt has been added put some pepper in the mixture also. Over this substance say: \"This will wash away love from all I choose.\" Go into your garden and dig a small hole, large enough to fit the piece of clothing in. Should you not trave a garden dig a hole in a wood, park or graveyard - any place where you can dig a hole. Obviously take care not to be seen. Once the cloth is in place pour the salted water over it and say: \"For you (name the owner of the piece of clothing) all love for (name of the person's lover) is dead, and as your love dies so too does his/her's. There is nothing between you now but distrust.\" Fill in the hole and over it say: ..SO MOTE IT BE.'' Go about your normal business and forget all about the spell. As with all spells that use negative energies, this spell should work very quickly indeed. The two lovers will most probably start to argue and will split-up in a matter of days. Hexing This spell is similar to the one given above and will cause your enemy to have extreme bad luck in all his/her endeavours. Again you will need to obtain a piece of clothing from your enemy, if you cannot acquire a piece of clothing, then try to get anything which belongs to him. On this piece of clothing write hisiher name in block capitals. Take a bowl and put in it some heavily salted water, to this add some pepper and tobacco from a used cigarette. Mix this substance well and over it say:"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"\"Demons and spirits of hell, Charge this with your venomous spit. Fill it with the negativity of your realm, Make him suffer slowly, no, not too quick. Take my hatred from whence it spawned, Bad luck is his from dusk to dawn. SO MOTE IT BE.'' Go to the garden and dig a hole, place the piece of clothing in the hole and over it pour the liquid substance. Say: \"From this day and hour (name of enemy)'s life will change. Heishe will have no peace till he/she changes ways. Negativity engulfs you and it is what you deserve.\" Cover the hole. The spell is finished. Repel Obtain some ordinary talcum powder, and to this add some dried tobacco. Hold your hands over the talcum and imagine a stream of red energy flowing into it. Think of this energy as having the power to keep unwanted guests at bay. After about 20 seconds say: \"This I form into a mystical talismanic powder, This has the power to repel (name the person). rWhen (name the person) steps near a place where this lands, He shall feel compelled to leave. As I will it, it is so. SO MOTE IT BE.\" Take the powder to your front door and throw some over your path. Go to the back and do the same. If you have access to the side of your house, then you should throw some there also. This substance will keep away the person you charged it for, and once they approach your home they will feel a strong desire to leave, without actually knowing why. 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Psychic Attack I am sure you have heard stories of the dangers of becoming involved with the occult. Many of these so-called dangers are imaginary, or totally exaggerated. They tell of demonic possessions, and satanic rituals. Such things hold no place within the arr of true Magick. However having said this, there is a real danger that a magician may face, on his/her long journey through occult training, and sometimes even after. This very real threat is called \"Psychic Attack\". Thankfully these are very rare, for most skilled magicians or witches would never send an attack. Once they have taken the time required to learn methods of sending a psychic attack they learn that it is very unwise to actually send one. Protecting Yourself To ensure that you never suffer under a psychic attack, you must protect yourself and your aura. There are many methods of self defence in this field, from a full blown ceremonial ritual to evocation, but the one I give requires only a few seconds and should be performed every thre€ days. Sit down, somewhere that has as little noise and distraction as possible. Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Calm both your mind and body. As you breathe imagine a brilliant white light travelling through your body and surrounding you. \\Within this light see small clouds of blackness. See them floating around this white force field. Now take a deep breath and hold it for longer than normal, as you do this see all the small black clouds forming into one. Now breathe out and as you do this imagine the black cloud shooting away into the distance, leaving only the white energy behind. This short ritual will keep you safe from pyschic attack ar all rimes, but it also has the added advantage ofcleansing your aura ofeveryday negativity that you may pick-up. As I stated before this short ritual should be performed every three days. Ifit is not possible to perform it this regularly then it should be performed at least once a week. You may, if you wish perform it everyday as your aura is constantly picking up negativity. ll"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Other Forms of Protection As well as protecting yourself, you may also wish to surround your personal belongings with psychic energy. This will ensure that they are free from negativity, and can protect them from vandals and thieves. Some of the things that you may want to protect are your bed - this will help rebound a psychic attack sent at night, jewellery, and other small personal possessions that have sentimental value, your home and your car. The method is much like the one to protect yourself. Sit down somewhere quiet and peaceful. Close your eyes and picture a beautiful pacific island, totally uninhabited. See yourself surrounded by palm trees and imagine that you are seated on a large rock by a small water-fall. \\fhere the water falls see it form into a small deep pool. In this pool see the most beautiful flowers you can imagine, floating. This exercise will calm you and build up the psychic energy you need to protect your valuables. Rise from your seat and breathe deeply for a few seconds. Now lift your hands, so that they are directly over the object to be protected. Say aloud, in a confident voice: \"I bless this (name object) that it may be free from negativity and all harm. \\Tithin my energy it is safe.\" Imagine white energy passing through your hands into the object. Once this happens see it glow. \\7ith small things like jewellery there is no need to take each item individually, they can all be charged together. When you are protect- ing your home and car you may be unable to pass your hands over them (in case someone sees you and thinks you have gone'out of your head'), so these will need to be charged with protective energy, by visualisation. Sit down, as you did before, and visualise the small island already mentioned. Then breathe deeply and feel psychic energy passing into your body. Visualise this energy as pure white. See it surrounding you and projecting its light all around the room in which you sit. Sit quietly for a few seconds and then visualise your car. See it in as much detail as possible. Now imagine that the energy which surrounds you is starting to make its way to your car. t2"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Start by imagining it flowing around the outside body work, and as it does this see the car start to glow. Now visualise the energy seeping through the car and swirling around inside it. Make the energy touch everything in the car such as the radio, steering wheel, gear-stick, leave nothing untouched. As it touches each item in turn see the item glow with the same light. Say in your head: \"Bless this car and everything in it. I bless this car with my life force that it may protect all who travel in it. Keep it free from accidents and theft, take all negativity from it. My \\fill Be Done.\" The car will now be protected from thieves and should keep you safe while driving in it. It is wise to perform the above mind ritual at least once a month, as this will build up a strong psychic barrier which will protect should an accident ever occur. To ensure your home is well protected you should use the same formula as given above. After building up the required amount of energy start by visualising it seeping through the walls and doors.and making its way all through the building. Make sure that you visualise the energy surrounding all the openings in your home such as doors and windows. This will stop any burglaries and unwanted visitors. This affirmation should be recited. in vour head. after vou finish with each room: \"Let this room be free from evil and filled with deepest love. Let only the true of heart enter and dwell within these walls. Negativity has no place here, for the light of love is lit.\" The above affirmation will cleanse the room and leave a peaceful, pleasant feeling in the room. After performing the ritual go around your home and feel the difference in the atmosphere, you may be pleasantly surprised. Once you have cleansed each room you must make another affirmation. Firstly visualise the outside of your home. See it glowing with the white psychic energy of protection and say to yourself: \"\\Tithin these walls all shall be safe. No one shall enter past their field ofprotection for evil or violent action. Theft and damage have no place within this protective vortex. My Vill Be Done.\" l3"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"This will protect your home for as long as you live there, but may be wise to perform the ritual every six months to ensure effectiveness and strengthen the psychic wall that encompasses it' The above ritual will protect your home from thieves and people with a violent nature. The riiual can be extended to encompass a garden if rebounds it increases in strength threefold! Evocation Through the centuries magicians have used magical evocation to .n--ott and command demons to do their bidding. These demons, once called, must obey a human such is the law of the universe' These are not from hetl. The occult teaches us that the demons are representations of our own psyches. They are in fact 'demons of the mind'. Each demon is a representation of a certain part of you' By means of evocation, we conjure up and control these demons, and by controlling these demons we in fact control that part of us which and love. Their whole purpose of being is to serve man, and if you perform the evocations correctly then they will serve you. But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself. The Place You will need what magicians call a temple. This can be any room in your home, but for the use of evocation it should be spacious. t4 it its"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Take a table and place it in the cenrre of the room. This is your altar. On the table you must place drawings of the demon's sigil and keep this book there also, open at the page with the summoning on it. All the relevant occult equipment should also be placed here. . On the table, anywhere that is handy, you should place some lncense. The Circle For evocation you will be using two kinds of circles, a physical one, made from salt, and an astral one. Readers of my other books may already know of an astral circle, and will already be aware of the fact that it cannot be used on its own, for evocational work. A magical circle is supposed to be 9 feet, for most of us this is impractical, so you will have to make your circle as big as you can. Take some salt and with it form a circle that encloses you. Before closing the circle off completely, you will need to place some burning incense about a foot outside it, this is where the demon will appear. Close off your circle and slowly walk around the inside of it, from now until the end of the evocation do not step outside the circle. As you walk around the inside circumference of the circle, say: I cleanse and bless you.\" You should at this stage also throw some water inside the circle, as this is a cleansing agent. Now you must surround yourself with an astral circle. Stand by your altar and breathe deeply, take in psychic energy through your breath. Hold out your first and second fingers as if you were pointing ar some- one. Visualise a strong golden beam streaming from them. Now walk around the inside circumference of your circle, in a clock-wise direction. All the time you are doing this try to see the circle forming as you walk round. Once you have completed the full circle, stop your visualisation. You are now fully protected by two powerful circles, so do not fear when you are performing the evocational rites. Once the evocation has finished and the demon has departed, you must take back your astral circle. Stand with your hand out in a stop gesture, and visualise the golden stream of energy returning to you, as you retrace your steps around the inside circumference of the salt circle. t5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"You should note that when you ask a demon a question, it will most probably answer you using psychic means. That is, the answer will be given in your head - don't think that this is fust your imagination, it isn't, but you can prove that for yourself. Love \\Xrith the evocation given next, any man can make himself more attractive to women, or he can ensure the love of a certain one he is after. The spirit to be conjured is known as \"Aseliel\". This demon is said to come from the south-east. This demon always proves to be effective, for he, himself, has 40 slave spirits to help him. His sigil is thus >----r. These sigils are the signs of demons and if the demon is evocated while holding his sign, he cannot refuse to come. There are various methods for controlling demons, and if you are intending to go on to study demonology, you will need to obtain magical weapons) especially the wand! Make a circle, in the usual way. Now take your wand (if you do not have a wand, use your index and middle fingers), visualise a blue glow from it. Now see it take on the shape of a triangle. Force this triangle to get bigger, until it is big enough for a man to stand in. Visualise this triangle floating down to the ground and landing there. Note that the triangle should not be inside your circle, under any circumstances. This is the place where your demon will appear. At the edge of your circle, as near to the triangle as is possible, place some incense, real incense is the best but stick incense will do. On the altar in front of you place a drawing of the demon's sigil. Take this sigil in your hand. Face south-east' and say, in a commanding voice: \"I call to thee, Oh spirit Aseliel, by the power of almighty God, I conjure thee, and command thee by Adonay, Agla, Jehova. I conjure thee and I command thee oh spirit Aseliel, by him who spoke and his word was law, and his law was done. I conjure thee by the most holy and powerfui names, El, Elohim, Tetragrammaton, Saday, Adonay, appear to me now outside this circle, within the triangle of art, in fair and human shape, without deformity, horror or delay. l6"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Come now from whatever part of the universe you hide and do my will. Appear before me I say, in pleasant and visible form. I conjure thee to do whatever I ask of thee, thou wilt yield to my will. I conjure thee by the name of our true and ever-living God Heliorem, and by the real name of God, to whom thou owes obedience, Yud-Hey-Vah-Hey. I coniure thee by the name of the prince who rules over thee. Come speak to me visibly and without delay. The most Holy God, the ruler of the mighty Universe, in which we all survive, commands thee, in his most holy name, at which the earth shakes man and beasts alike, at which hell would crumble and the Angels bow, by his name I command thee to appear. YUD-HEY-VAH-HEY.\" At this time the demon should have appeared. Look for a misty shape within the triangle, this shape will take on more definite form as time passes. If you can see nothing, and the demon refuses to appear, then you must give it a warning. Say: \"Oh Spirit Aseliel, thou art disobedient and most wicked, because thou hast not obeyed me and the names of your creator the one and true God, by these same names I curse thee and send thee into the bottomless pit of the abyss, there thou will remain in fire and brimstone until the day of wrath, unless thou forthwith appear in the triangle of art, in fair and human shape. YUD-HEY-VAH-HEY, King of King commands thee.\" Now take the demon's sigil and onto it pour some salt, take a match and be ready to strike it. Say: \"I conjure thee, fire, by him whom all other creatures of this world and thee to burn, torture and consume this spirit Aseliel now and forever.\" The spirit will now appear, if it does not burn the sigil. Once the sigil starts to burn, be ready to put it out straight away, for the spirit will appear, rather than burn in hell. t7"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Once the spirit has appeared before you, you must make him pledge allegiance to you. If you have a wand hold it so that the tip of it is outside your circle, make sure that your hand does not move outside it. If you do not have a wand then just command the demon to swear it. Say: \"By my will, swear to do all I say and ask of thee, from this day until the end of time.\" Now give your instructions to the spirit and always tell him to finish his work as fast as possible. Once you have finished instructing the demon, you must give him license to depart. NOTE: Even if after all the evocations are given, you still cannot see the demon, you must still give the license to depart, this is very important, do not forget it. Evocation is serious business and not to be messed with. Sometimes demons refuse to show themselves, or cannot find enough power or incense to manifest, but make no mistake, these creatures are still very much there!l! So even if you do not see them still instruct them with your desires, you will find that they will become reality. The License to Depart \"Oh spirit Aseliel, because thou hast answered my demands I hereby license thee to depart, without injury to man or beast. GO I tell you) go, but come thee back whenever I summon thee by the force of holy magick! I conjure thee to withdraw this moment. Go in peace) and that peace be forever between thee and me. So Mote It Bel\" The spirit will leave, if it does not do not panic, keep repeating the license to depart. Demons very rarely refuse to go, they hate being trapped by a human and are only too glad to get away. If a demon does refuse to go, which is very, very un- likely with the ones I give, repeat the most holy name of God, \"YUD-HEY-VAH-HEY\", and keep commanding it to leave. It will be unable to resist. The formula I have given should be used with all the evocations; the only thing that should change is the name of the spirit. l8"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Secrets If you have a desire to find out more occult secrets then there is a demon you can conjure up. He will teach you occult techniques and keep you one step ahead of other magicians. This may give you that well needed advantage, possibly in years to come. He has 20 servants, and once he is under your control, these slaves will be under your command also. His sigil is thus J-\", L, and his name is \"Bydiel\". Follow the instructions as you would for the love evocation, and substitute \"Aseliel\" with \"Bydiel\". The rest remains the same. It should be noted by the budding magician that these spirits will not be able'to develop things for yiu oritside their field. That is a money spirit cannot make a woman fall in love with you, and vice-versa. Treasure \"Emoniel\" is the spirit who will do anything asked of him, one of the very few. He has 100 servants and belongs to no place. His sigil is thus ..')^ .He is ideal for usingwhen you can find no demon to suit your purposes. As with all the evocational rites, follow the instructions given in the love section, substituting the name \"Aseliel\" with the name \"Emoniel\". He will probably come in very handy, when you are taken by surprise and want to perform a rite, but have no time to plan. \"Usiel\" - although he is said to show where there is buried treasure, he can also show you where there is hidden money, and personally valuable things to you. He has 40 slaves, and as with all the demons these are also at your command. His sigil is \\Z . Spirit - Slave This spirit will act as your slave and do all your bidding.
