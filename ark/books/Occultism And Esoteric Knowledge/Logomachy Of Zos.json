[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE LOGOMACHY OF ZOS By Austin Osman Spare Wisdom is a stasis: Knowledge is like the 'snake of eternity', constantly eating itself and never finishing. More bathos: connexity of all our bloody selves to Ego is a nightmare commanded by the overlooked, u nobeyed latencies of return, essential for re - union. Ego expands by that which evokes mutual effluxes; therefore look for the Theocentric in the Egocentric. If God personalizes our deficiencies, then, we thus personify his? Subject understanding object by 'as if' may become, with courage, an ingressive emotional experience giving mutual expression. Falsehood, and all sham conceits, are the reflected memory of the de - related and forgotten event resurging, re - exhibiting for validation; for whatever you pr etend, holds a misplaced Truth, i.e., inaccurately related time and place. This also is true of the future. Time here is long... Of whom do we ask forgiveness when we hate ourselves? Our urges are ever ubiquitous, affinities change, and Knowledge becomes r edundant. Never too old to learn, always too old to be taught. If all realization is by our relatability to different co - existences, then making the more variable is one purpose of being. The Life - force and the Ids have their logic, which does not precl ude our having our own diversity of will. There is virtue in all non - conformity because it makes new forms. Ecstasy is our out - span touching Reality.

O utstanding ability shows affective psychic union. Art alone having the gift of tongues has universal understanding, hence to know its fundaments is the initial path to Wisdom and Knowledge. However great your reach, whatever you touch, shall touch flesh. We cannot love love too much when we find it. There is a self - revelation by a simple cryptic symbol: the meaning of all meanings. Think well before you drain this Cup of intoxicating possibilities. When our aspirations become as inexorable as affection , the mind will divulge techniques and media. Heaven makes no moral laws, but gives us instincts towards rightness and virtue.

However incompatible dis coveries may be they always conform to the processes of ultimate inductions from our inherent designing ability. The mind has no known purpose except that which it surmises from previous conations; all our motives are thus related processes springing from a basic urge deep within us and manifesting as Self - love. Thinking is an inverse reflection of emotional needs, its resultants being changed by some other immediacy. Abortive and extreme metamorphoses occur when Man slips into excessive evil or good. Th ere is that theurgy in Will when all desires focus into one meanness or greatness. Reversion is often the road to perversion, and the disused or abused degenerates unless transposed to another purpose. Love shall cease when copulation is abjured. Things more excellent than themselves are expressed through Art when our selves are expressed in them. The artist illumines unseen beauties and awakens us to the utility of beauty as pleasure of a more permanent kind. We conceive from the whole until detail de stroys. To know the fundaments of Art is to know the path of all wisdom. What does not exist Man will invent or imagine. Much is realized and so seldom expressed that when it might be told it is already forgotten. The self - glory of our forgiveness of o urselves and others — these are our failures.

Vicious circle: Fear as the offspring of fearing to face things. Our near relatives are the greatest insurance against belief in ourselves. When Art is wanting the beast is superior.

Soul permitted Mind — the first form, and spatial. Imagination and rhythm, the machinery of this high er basic harmony is — by our ecstasy — contiguous because it is a flash of reality. All our transference is by the harmony and imagination granted us.

Whatever we invite and accept of our thoughts must gather me into metaphor by a known tautology revealing our lesser - known attitudes to things. Character is the measurable result of modified or controlled de sires. Ability exhibits our affective psychic unions. The conjugation of a priori and a pos teriori crated the Anoëtic.

There is no escape by escapism — a labour of forging more chains to prevent suicide. If I cannot believe in the eternity of Ego, whatever its fluctuations, in what shall I believe? There is no whole without our particular parts and our efforts to become essential and more extensive. Our positiveness convinces others who have little of it; suggestion being more powerful to convey it than formal instructions. None of us knows our lim itations without full articulation; wrong application, media, and idioms are more to blame than any lack of ability. We should solicit extensively to procreate our thought - forms: the final phase — criticism, revision, rejection.

Thought is a reflection and all ideas in thought are possible only from a prototype. Constant self - refor mation is essential for higher attitudes. When we identify our desire with an object it is our nearest conception of reality. Procreation is a more adequate realization than other relationships, so reality is suffered only as fleeting and limited. Our sho rtcomings of memory, plus imagination, produce factors which tend to reveal symbolically more inwrought things. It is not futile to strive for reality in the unsubstantiated things of mind and, when fearless, it becomes great artistry. Man is an infinite aptitude of possibility: apart from his media, necessity is the limiting factor. Diverse knowledge is unnecessary, but aptitude for it is essential to wisdom. Fundamental simplicity has an infallibility. All things are linked by a bi - sexual corresponde nce, and aloneness is an impossibility. The essential predisposition to love all things for a while is intoxication. We fail to understand the mysterious lives we live, the plurality of things and the singularity of Ego. Whatever stage we reach is throug h unities. In relating ourselves — the unknown, the receding — everything that escapes the geocentric seems more significant. The reality we know is interconnected with the unseen by some design of thought we have yet to know. The superman becomes idiot sayi ng \" I am the Law\".

Life, growth, change, into and out of things to all possible transmutations. All things serve each other, willingly or otherwise.
