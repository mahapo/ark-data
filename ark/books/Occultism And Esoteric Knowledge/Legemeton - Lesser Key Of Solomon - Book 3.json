First these genijs that belong to the Fiery Region, that is \r \u0010 and gov- erned by Michael the great Angel who is one of the Chief Messengers of God, who is toward the South, therefore these genijs are to be observed in the first hour of a Sunday & at the 8th. hour, also at the 3rd. & 10th. at night, directing yourself toward that quarter, they appear in Royal Apparel holding scepters in their hands, and riding on a Lyon or a Cock, their robes are of red & saffron color & most comely, they assume the shape Crowned Queen & very beautiful to behold. Secondly these genijs that are attributed to \u0004 \u000e & \u0011 are of the Earthly Regions & are governed by Vriel who hath 3 Princes to attend him (viz) Asaiel, Sochiel & Cassiel. Therefore the genijs that are Attributed to him & these signs are to be observed in the West. They appear like Kings, having green & silver robes, or like little children or women delighting in hunting, & they are to be observed on Saturday in the 1st. & 8th. hours of the day & the 3rd. & 10th. of the night, in those hours you are with privacy to obtain your desires directing yourself towards the west as aforesaid. Thirdly those genijs that are attributed to \u000b \u0005 & \u0012 are of the Airy Region whose soverign is called Raphiel, who hath under him 2 princes called Seraphiel & Miel. Therefore these genijs are attributed to him & those signs are to be observed towards the East, on a Wednesday the 1st. hour of the day & 8th., at night the 3rd. & 10th. hours. They appear as Kings or beautiful young men in robes of diverse col- ors but mostly like women transcendently handsome by reason of their admirable whiteness & beauty. Fourthly & lastly, these genijs that are attributed to \f \u000f & \u0013 are of the Watery Regions & are governed by Gabriel who hath under him Samael, Madiel & Mael. Therefore these Genijs that are under these signs & are governed by Gabriel are to be observed on Mondays, towards the North at the 1st. & 8th. hours of the day & at night at the 3rd. & 10th. hours. They appear like Kings having green & sil- ver robes or like little children or women delighting in hunting. So in the next place, we are to observe the season of the year according to the constellations of the Celestial Bodies, otherwise we shall loose our labor, for if a genijs be of the Igneal Hierarchy its in vain to observe him in any other season but when the \u0003 enters these signs which is of his nature, that is \r & \u0010 . So if it be a genij of the Earth, he is to be observed when the \u0003 enters \u0004 \u000e & \u0011 , & so the like in the rest. Otherwise thus: those genijs that are of the order of Fire are to be observed in the Summer Quarter & those of the Earth in Autumn, those of the Air in Spring, & those of the Water in Winter quarter. Their offices is to do all things that are just & lawful in the sight of the great God Jehovah & what is for our good & what shall concern the protection of our lives or beings or wellbeings & the doing good to our neighbors."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Ars Paulina 21 Now he that hath a desire to see his genijs ought to prepare himself accordingly. Now if his genijs be of the Fire, his demands must be for the conservation of his body or person, that he receive no hurt from or by any fire, arms or guns or the like. & having a seal suitable ready prepared he is to wear it when he hath a desire to see his genijs that he may confirm it to him, that for the time to come he may not fail of his assistance & protection upon any occasion. But if his genijs be Aireal, he reconci- leth mens natures, increaseth love & affection between them & causeth the desired love of Kings & Princes & secretly promotes Marriages. & therefore he that hath such a genius before he observes him shall prepare a seal suitable to his order, that he may have it confirmed by him in the day & hour of observation, whereof he shall see strange & wonderful effects. & so the like of the other 2 hierarchies. & when the time is come that you would see your genijs, turn your face to that quarter the sign there is. & that, with prayer to God (they being composed to your fancy but suitable to the matter at hand) there thou shalt find him & having found him, sincerely acknowledge him, do your duty. Then will he, as being benign & sociable, illuminate your mind, taking away all that is obscure & dark in thy memory & make you knowing in all Sciences sacred & divine in an instant. [Below is] A form of prayer which ought to be said upon that coast or quarter where the genijs is several times, it being an Exorcism to call the genij into the Crys- tal Stone. Note this prayer may be altered to the mind of the worker, for it is here sett for an example. The Prayer “ O thou great & blessed N my Angel Guardian, vouchsafe to descend from thy Holy mansion which is Celestial with thy holy influence & presence into this Crystal Stone, that I may behold thy glory & enjoy thy society, Aid & Assistance both now & forever hereafter, O thou that art higher than the 4th. heaven & knowest the secrets of Elanel , thou that rid- est upon the wings of the wind & art mighty & potent in thy Celestial & supersublunary motion, do thou descend & be present I pray thee, I humbly desire & Intreat thee that if ever I have merited thy society or if any of my actions or intentions be real & pure & sanc- tified before thee, bring thy external presence hither & converse with me, one of thy submis- sive pupils, in & by the name of the great God Jehovah , whereunto the whole choir of heaven sings continually O Alappa-la-man Hallelujah , Amen .” When you have said this prayer over several times, as occasion serveth, you will at last see strange lights & passages in the stone & at last you will see your genius, then give him a kind entertainment as you were before directed, declaring unto him your mind & what you would have done. So Endeth The Book Pauline"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Lemegeton: Clavicula Salomonis 22 Afterword by the Editor The text and diagrams of this book were taken directly from a copy of Sloane Manu- script 2731. The handwriting in this section was small and cramped, even in com- parison with the rest of the manuscript. It is very difficult to distinguish between the copyist ’ s \"o\", \"e\", and \"a\"; thus there is some variation from other published editions in the names of various angels. They are as accurate as I can make them, given the state of the original materials. Punctuation marks and capitalization are virtually non-existent in the manuscript, particularly in the parts describing the individual angels and their subordinates. The punctuation in this edition represents my own best guess as to how the run-on strings of words are divided into sentences. The Ars Paulina is, in one way, the most sophisticated of the books of the Lemegeton . Unlike the other books, effective practice of its methods required a detailed knowledge of both mathematics and astronomy, possessed in those days only by those who could afford the full course of the traditional Liberal Arts educa- tion. As well, a tremendous amount of effort went into the preparations for any sin- gle operation of the Art. Calculating a single astrological chart by hand, without even the aid of a pre-calculated ephemeris, could consume many hours. There is one flaw in this sophistication, and it appears in the first paragraph of the book. There the author describes how the power governed by the angels ruling the dawn hour varies according to the day; Lunar on Monday, Martial on Tuesday, etc. Presumably the angels of the remaining hours either govern the same power, or follow something akin to the traditional cabalistic system of planetary hours, described in the Greater Key of Solomon and many other places. The problem with this is that the procedures described in the remainder of the book suggest that an entirely different system is being used to determine the invoked powers. To create the seal for the angels of a particular hour, the magician first casts the astrological chart for that hour in the day the work is to be done. The planetary glyph to be drawn in the center of the seal is the planet ruling the sign on the Ascen- dant of the chart. The glyphs of the remaining planets are drawn counterclockwise around the rim of the seal, starting with the fastest planet and ending with the slow- est. Finally, for reasons not explained, the sign that is on the cusp of the twelfth astrological house is drawn in the center next to the ruler of the Ascendant. Therefore the planet emphasized in the seal may be different from the planet ruling the day of the week. For example, the date of the author ’ s examples fell on a Wednesday, but since Aries was rising at dawn, the central planet in the seal for that hour is Mars. The planet ruling the day only shows up in the seals when a sign it rules is rising at the beginning of an hour. To invoke the angel of the hour, the magician is instructed to lay the Seal upon the Table of Practice. But he lays it upon the sigil of the planet ruling the rising sign, not upon the sigil of the Planet ruling the day and hour according to the cabalistic system of hours."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Ars Paulina 23 Further, the invocation used makes no mention of the cabalistic ruler of the Day and Hour. It does mention elements of the Seals, and also refers to the angels ’ “ rays ” ; this term is frequently used in medieval documents when discussing the action of the planets on the world, but I have never seen it used in relation to the cabalistic system of attributes. So every symbolic and operational element of this magick seems geared towards using the Lord of the Ascendant as the power ruling the hour. The preliminary mention of the Ruler of the Day, with its implied reference to the cabalistic method of rulership, is not supported by anything that comes afterwards. For the Seals shown in Part 1 of the book, the author chose the date of his example carefully. March 10, 1641 in the Old Style calendar ( “ according to the old account ” ) is March 21 in the New Style, the first full day after the Spring Equinox. This was no doubt done to ease the process of calculations, since this is one of only two days during the year when the magickal \"hours\" of the day and night are of equal length, and are almost exactly one clock hour in length. At any other time of the year the day and night hours are longer or shorter, and this would have made the process of calculating the astrological charts for each hour rather more tedious and error-prone. Even so, it seems that he made a few small errors in his calculations, which show up in the example seals. A modern magician, with the assistance of a good computer and astrology software, can easily avoid this. The author calculated his charts for the date specified, and for a place at approximately the latitude of London, England. Comparing his seals with calculated charts for that date, it appears that he used a system of house calculations resembling the old Meridian or Porphyry systems. The Placidus house system more commonly used today produces results substantially different from those shown in the seals. It should also be noted that, despite the assertions of one commentator on this book, the author used the Tropical, precession-adjusted zodiac for his calculations, not any version of a sidereal or constellation-oriented zodiac. The example seals can only be produced if the Tropical zodiac is used. Benjamin Rowe June 22, 1999"}]
