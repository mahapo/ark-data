[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 IS OUR EARTH REALLY HOLLOW ? Why are “Hollow Earthers” simply not getting anywhere in their sincere quest for the fabled “Inner Earth”, which is believed to exist within Earth’s 800-miles thick outer crustal shell? Can it be because orthodox science is correct in believing that our planet (like all the other terrestrial planets) is a solid-crusted and semi-molten ball of rock, through to its central core? Or is it because they have no possible way of knowing if it is actually solid, or not? Or could it, as many have suggested, be due to some world-wide secretive “Cover-Up” by powerful global political power groups and all the scientific organizations which they control? Here, acting as an alternative-science investigator, I will endeavour to present a even-handed but critical examination of the prevailing concepts in an effort to discover if there is any basis of real truth behind the present-day revival of all the time-honoured “Hollow Earth” reports,myths, legends and theories. Read on and decide for yourself what is the real truth behind the whole concept of a hollow inner earth, and what a political and mercenary power-group on the surface might stand to gain or lose by the honest revelation or admission of the existence of such a vast new territory, which would immediately become available for all manner of exploitation and territorial annexation by the nation who discovered it - if it were proved to actually exist!

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea. So twice five miles of fertile ground with walls and towers were girded round And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, enfolding sunny spots of greenery. But O, that deep romantic chasm which slanted down the green hill athwart a cedern grove! A savage place! As holy and enchanted as e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover! And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, as if this earth in thick fast pants was breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced; amid whose swift half-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail: And ‘mid these dancing rocks at once and ever it flung up momently the sacred river Five miles meandering with a mazy motion through wood and dale the sacred river ran, Then reached the caverns measureless to man and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean And ‘mid this tumult Kubla heard from afar ancestral voices prophesying war! The shadow of the dome of pleasure floated midway on the waves; Where was heard the mingled measure from the fountains and the caves. It was a miracle of rare device, a sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice! A damsel with a dulcimer in a vision once I saw: It was an Abyssinian maid, and on her dulcimer she played, Singing of Mount Abora. Could I revive within me, her symphony and song, To such a deep delight ‘twould win me, that with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air, that sunny dome! Those caves of ice! And all who heard should see them there, and all should cry Beware! Beware! His flashing teeth his floating hair!

GF.)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 Is Our Earth Hollow? A Hypothetical Dissertation by Gerry Forster . Since so much has been written and discussed on this allegedly “Far-Out”topic, I feel it is worth examining the concept of a Hollow Earth a little further, if for no other reason than to satisfy the curiosity of any readers who may find this idea of interest. That it is an interesting concept, cannot be denied, even though it may well be scoffed and sneered at by my more learned scientific thinkers and scholars. However, since these same people also deride the concept of God and Jesus Christ, I am not terribly concerned about making their lips curl a tad more. Obviously those extremely profound words of Shakespeare, uttered by his Danish Prince, Hamlet: “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy” carry no particular meaning for the “omniscient sages” such scholars imagine themselves to be! Hyperborea And Ultima Thule. Before we actually look into the actual Hollow Earth theory itself, I think we should perhaps first consider the ancient and subsequent North Polar mythos that led to the Hollow Earth theory being propounded. We will need to begin by studying some of the legendary lands which have been perpetuated in the folk-history of the Scandinavian and Germanic peoples, even though these legends owe some of their origins to the ancient Greeks and the Aryans of Central Asia. Two major mystic and magical lands spring to mind here; Hyperborea and Ultima Thule - which both feature greatly in Nordic mythology, besides having, from all accounts, actually existed somewhere within the Arctic regions of the world in ancient times. However, before we go in search of concrete evidence, let’s examine some of the legendary background for both of these places - which might well, in fact, have been one and the same ! Hyperborea. the first mention we find of the Hyperboreans, is in the mythos of ancient Greece, before the time of Homer. However, Herodotus mentions them as being part of the legendary Theban epic, as being in some way connected with the cult of Apollo, the sun- god, and that their homeland was in a paradise-like country “beyond the North Wind”, which indicates a region that may now lie within the Arctic Circle , or certainly in the North Atlantic! The Hyperborians according to this same source, were alleged to live for a thousand years, but they had a tradition that any who tired of such a long life could end it in a ritual suicide ceremony, whereby the person involved was decked with floral garlands and allowed to jump off a high pinnacle into the sea! Other legends seem to indicate that it was “that happy land lying to the west, towards the setting sun”. The anciently-famed Garden of the Hesperides , where trees bore golden fruit. The Elysian Fields , or even the Happy Isles ! Generally, it is believed to have been a veritable paradise on earth, and may perhaps have been an island"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 lying somewhere between the Azores and Iceland , which, like Atlantis , sank beneath the waves after some great catastrophe. There are some scholars who directly connect the two, and claim that Hyperborea was , in fact, the lost continent of Atlantis ! My own view, after scanning some of the mythology surrounding Hyperborea and Thule, is that it’s possible that they could have been the same place ! It really all depends upon how far back the original legends go. If they are traceable to the time of the establishment of the Egyptian nation (since they figure in the Theban epic), then it is possible that they go far back in time to the period prior to the last polar shift. In which case, much of the land which now lies within the Arctic Circle was then a warm to temperate country, richly carpeted with grasslands and forests and all of Nature’s bounty, both vegetable and animal. It’s even possible that we need look no farther than the British Isles , since these would have been well to the “far north-west” of both Egypt and Greece! (We have to avoid the pitfall of allowing a north European concept of the “north-west” to cloud our geographic thinking!) However, at that distant point in time, both Britain and Ireland would have been the most north-westerly part of the European land-mass , since the English Channel and the North Sea were both dry land then. There seems to be a distinct hint in the legends that both Hyperborea and Ultima Thule were always islands , so perhaps this would tend to rule out Britain and Ireland, since they were once part of the continent of Europe. My first conclusion, then, is that both were actually the same place , with Greenland as Ultima Thule and Iceland as Thule . Ultima Thule and Thule seem to be separated in mythology into two distinct islands, and, since “Ultima” Thule implies the furthest away, then Thule must have been closer to Europe than it. The obvious candidate for Thule then, must be Iceland. According to Pytheas , a famous Greek navigator of the 4th century BC, Thule was a six-day voyage north of Britain, though whether by sail or by oar-power isn’t stated, but it seems to set the location of Thule as modern Iceland . Common sense suggests that Ultima Thule had to be Greenland. However, what if both were once united as one largely-submerged land-mass - the continent of Hyperborea? The Arctic Homeland: Hyperborea. To discover more about the mythos surrounding Hyperborea, we must look briefly at the works of various older authorities on such somewhat esoteric mysteries. Jean-Sylvain Bailly , 1736-1793), who was an astronomer and a mystic, comments that: It is a very remarkable thing that enlightenment appears to have come from the North, against the common prejudice that the earth was enlightened, as it was populated, from the South...” He then goes on to point out that, according to all the legends and ancient wisdom, “as humanity began to reconstitute itself after the Noahic Deluge, the purest stream of civilization descended from Northern Asia into India, which to this day carries evidence of having the most ancient astronomical system on earth”. He continues on to point out that, in most of the ancient mythologies of the world, there appears to be a race- memory of a racial origin in the far North and a gradual migration southward."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Another great scientific mind of the same era, the Comte de Buffon , located the first civilizations in northern and central Asia , east of the Caspian Sea, but he seemed to generally agree with Bailly about a northern origin for mankind, rather than a Middle Eastern or Southern one. Rev. Dr. W.F. Warren, who was president of Boston University and belonged to several learned societies, revived the polar origin theory for mankind in a book published in 1885: “Paradise Found”, of which the thesis was “That the cradle of the human race...was situated at the North Pole, in a country submerged at the time of the Deluge.” His theory compared very well with all the relevant sciences and comparative mythology - especially that of Germany. Warren was a Christian and an avowed anti- Darwinist, and he utterly rejected the concept of man having evolved from the ape, through a period of primitive savagery. He believed that the earliest men were the noblest and the longest-lived , ”and it was only after the Deluge, that humanity began to take on the feeble lineaments of ourselves.” At least, in his work he reveals some amazing insight into what could have caused the Deluge, through God’s Hand, by pointing out that, after the survivors of the polar flood settled in their north Asian exile, “they found the skies tilted in respect to the way they had known them: the North Star was no longer overhead” , and he mentions that “they perfectly understood why this was so” .... ”but their rude descendants, unfavoured with the treasures of antediluvian science, and born only to a savage, nomadic life.... might easily have forgotten the explanation” - which was that, “instead of the human horizon, it was the earth that had shifted”! * Here, at last, we get the first oblique mention of a polar shift! (*Accents are mine. GF) Support from India. Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920), a renowned pioneer protagonist of Indian Independence at the turn of the century, was also a scholar in astronomy and Vedic antiquities, who among other feats, was able to place the oldest Indian Vedic civilization at around 4500 BC. Tilak was jailed by the British for his anti-British writings for several years, and this time he put to good use in studying the Veda scripts, in relation to known astronomical and geological events. He published his findings in a work: “The Arctic Home of The Vedas”, in 1903. In this he stated that, according to his readings of the Vedas, the original Arctic home of humanity was destroyed around 10,000 - 8,000 BC by the last Ice Age, and that from 8,000 - 3000 BC , was the “Age of Wandering” , before they Vedic people finally settled in India between 5,000 - 3000 BC. By then, he went on to add, they had already begun to forget their Arctic origins , and their traditions had begun to go downhill. As we have seen in earlier accounts, his timing of this cataclysm fits in very closely with what we know of the destruction of Atlantis and Mu , so we can attribute it to the same cause - a sudden polar shift, resulting in both tidal waves and tectonic upheavals followed by a very rapid relocation of the polar ice-caps: the so-called “Ice Age”. So, we have the destruction of Mu , dated very approximately at 12,000 years ago, that of Atlantis around 10,000 years ago, and, according to best estimates, the destruction of Hyperborea also at around the same time-frame of 10,000 years ago. Could this then, be also the time of the Biblical ”Flood” too? As far as I’m able to determine by reading sundry authorities, this would seem to be the case. So it’s up to my"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 readers to resolve for themselves whether this is a pure coincidental matter, or whether God chose to bring about the cleansing of an evil and disobedient world by means of a purely natural catastrophic event - which would seem to be a logical thing to do if One were the Supreme Intellect, who created the entire Universe along purely logical lines! Land of The Midnight Sun. Ancient Indian texts seem to point most clearly to the fact that the Arctic region was the “realm of the ancient gods” since they specifically mention that it is where the sun rises and sets only once a year - which demonstrates that the writers had a clear knowledge of the astronomical and seasonal situation at the North Pole. Of course, they were quite right, since the sun only appears above the horizon for six months of the year, and is below it for the remaining six months! The question here is how did those ancient Indians know this? The obvious answer is because it was recorded in the Vedic Hymns , which speak of “The Dawn of Many Days” and “The Thirty Dawn Sisters Circling Like A Wheel” . When applied to the Pole, these terms make good sense, since the sun takes exactly a month to actually appear above the horizon after the four -month night. I say four -month rather than six here, because the sun also takes a further month each year, to set . So there’s a polar twilight of one month, followed by a night of four months. then a dawn of one month, followed by a day of four months! The Vedas are correct in every detail, even though written thousands of years ago! Obviously, these ancient forebears of the Indian people, the Aryans, knew this from first-hand experience! The oldest Vedic year had only two divisions, which were called devas and pitras ; names which correlated with the “Day of The Gods” and the “ Night of The Gods” . This, curiously enough, is very reminiscent of another dramatic piece of Germanic Aryan mythology - “Gottdammerung” - “ The Twilight of The Gods” - which is a strangely apt connection with the Vedic-Aryan Polar Year! The Advent of The Big Freeze. We learn from the Zoroastrian scholar, H. S. Spencer’s “ Aryan Ecliptic Cycle” (1965) that the “Aryan ecliptic cycle” ran from approximately 25,500 BC to 300 BC - from their residence in the polar homeland during the “ Interglacial Age ” (or “ Inter Pole-Shifts Age ”, depending on one’s persuasion), to their being compelled to leave it because of the presence firstly, of giant reptiles (dinosaurs!), and then the advent of intense cold and snow! ( It is important to bear in mind that the same effect would be taking place at the South Pole , also.) The Big Freeze occurred about 10,000 BC - and was just one of several natural cataclysms of that period which destroyed Atlantis , Lemuria (Mu) , and the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert) . From the Pole, the Aryans had to fight their way against the forces of nature, as well as those of the indigenous Asian tribes, including a term of enslavement by the Turanians (Turks). Religious Influences of the Aryans . However, by 8,500 BC they ruled their own empire in Bactria , where they continued to worship their god, Mazda , whom they had apparently held as their chief deity among several, for at least 19,000 years BC. It was Zoroaster (better known as"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 Zarathustra ) who introduced Mazdan monotheism around 7100 BC. The Persian Aryans stayed true to their faith, but the Indian branch joined in the local polytheism, only changing to Hinduism when they believed Zarathustra had been reincarnated as Krishna around 4000 BC. It is also interesting to note that (according to Spencer), the European Aryans accepted this very same reincarnated spirit as Jesus Christ ! The religious influence of these Aryans was to have a great impact upon all the surrounding religions in promoting the supremacy of a male concept of God over the female , which had hitherto dominated Egypt , Babylon , Sumeria , and the Semites , who had all previously worshipped predominantly female gods. Atlantis and Thule. As has been gleaned from Plato’s “Discourses”, Atlantis was thought to have arisen in the middle of the Atlantic, opposite the Pillars of Hercules - The Straights of Gibraltar. And so it was always believed for centuries, until this was challenged in the 18th century by Olaf Rudbeck, who claimed the lost kingdom as having been his native land of Sweden. This started a new trend of thought among the scholars, and Bailly , whom we met earlier, became convinced that Atlantis had been much further north than had hitherto been supposed, and suggested either Spitzbergen , Greenland or Nova Zemlya as possible sites. He rationalised that because the rotary movement of the planet close to the poles was so much less, the atmosphere might well have been less agitated, thus making it in reality a place of eternal spring . Through this idea, he identified his Altlanteans as actually being the legendary Hyperboreans , living in their golden “Garden of the Hesperides” close to the North Pole! A Place of Perpetual Spring near The Pole? Despite the original report by the Greek, Pytheas , around 300 BC, that he had reached a sea of ice just one day north of Thule - which he evidently thought was , in fact, Iceland - he was disbelieved, and the myth still persisted that a warm polar sea existed around the Pole, with a very clement and temperate land environment surrounding it. Even Columbus believed it, and he sailed 300 miles north beyond Iceland before reaching ice-bound waters. Most of his critics discredited this feat, as they firmly believed the northern Atlantic to be quite impassable. (However, it was Columbus’ feat which caused later explorers to search those northerly Arctic oceans for the legendary North West Passage into the Pacific!) However, I am digressing!. Atlantean Nazis? It was the Roman historian, Tacitus, who started the Germanic people believing that they were the descendants of these Atlantean-Hyperborean Aryans from the North Pole. He had already remarked that he could hardly believe that people would choose to live in such a rigorous climate as that of Germany, let alone anywhere further north, but it was he who later agreed with those who believed the Germans to be a pure race , who had never intermarried with any other, and that this was shown by their distinct familial likeness, both physically and in character, even though they were a numerous race. They all had stern blue eyes, fair ruddy hair and large physiques. It was this Nordic Aryan, tall, blond image - projected by Tacitus - that was later to become the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 racial ideal of the Hitlerian Nazis - despite Hitler himself and many of his Nazi colleagues, being short and dark-haired and typically Southern European in general appearance! This led to the concept of a Nazi Thule , the three godfathers of which were Von List , Von Liebenfels , and Von Sebottendorff . All three were pretenders to grandeur and had added the nobly-suggestive “Von” to their plain family names. This in itself was a classical symptom of master-race delusion, as they all firmly believed themselves to be of this chosen aristocratic Aryan race. I could pursue this Nazi- Aryan association and their Thule Society at great length, but, whilst it is of great significance in terms of racial distinction and discrimination - as witnessed by their subsequent anti-Semitism - it has relatively little to do with the actual racial origins of mankind as a whole or of the Polar entrance to the Hollow Earth! The Nazi attempt at world domination is now relegated to the political history of the world, which is not the province of this work. Readers wishing to learn more of the Nazi-Thule mythos should read Joscelyn Godwin’s absorbing book: “Arktos - The Polar Myth”. However, it’s in that same book, that Godwin does unearth many interesting points regarding the Boreal Race , whether Altlanteans or whatever. He says that two major and distinct streams issued forth from these people during their migrations, one from north to south, and the other at a later time from west to east. The Hyperboreans took with them the same spirit, bloodline and system of communication, symbolic, written or spoken, first to North America, and then to the Northern Eurasia. Tens of thousands of years later, a second wave of Hyperborean migrants appear “to have thrust as far south as Central America, and to have settled principally in a vanished land situated in the Atlantic region , founding there a centre in the image of the polar one *”. (*The emphasis is mine). “In this regard,” he continues, quoting Evola, ”one should properly speak of a “Nordic-Atlantic” race and civilization”. Decline and Fall. “In Evola’s view”, says Godwin, “the latter, Atlantean stream, became polluted with telluric (earthy) and demonic elements from the even more ancient Lemurians, (the Muvians) whose distant descendants survive in the dark races. From this blending came the cults of the Mother and of the Earth, which would forever remain in opposition to the original cult of the Sun, preserving the purer Nordic stream.” We have already seen how the Atlanteans were far more concerned with aggression and sorcery than those nations they tried to dominate, so they do not really deserve to be compared with the still-pure Nordic Aryans. However, as history shows, even the most pure and racially- clean nations eventually succumb to their own glory and go into moral decline. As, much later on, would the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Romans do also. What Became of Hyperborea? One would imagine that after the Hyperborean region became a frozen waste of ice and snow that it would cease to feature in world mythology, except perhaps as a fondly-remembered homeland in the race-memory of the Aryans and perhaps the Atlanteans. However, this appeard to be far from the case! As mentioned earlier, that first group of Hyperboreans who migrated to Atlantis were very much given to sorcery"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 and conquest, whilst those who went to Asia, retained much of their pure character. Could this signify a division of the Hyperboreans into two moral factions? Those who chose the Left-Hand Path and those who preferred to follow the Right? Perhaps this might account for the first contingent (the Atlanteans) leaving Thule so much earlier than those who became the Aryans. Obviously, if there was a gap of thousands of years between the two groups leaving the Pole, it seems to infer that perhaps the first group (the Atlanteans), were expelled from their homeland by the rest of the inhabitants. Clearly, the second, Aryan group, only left because of the ice cataclysm which overtook their homeland and didn’t initially seek anything other than a place to live in peace. This would seem to indicate that they were of quite a different and more peaceable nature to their Atlantean cousins. Maybe, in this expulsion of the first group from this “Garden of The Hesperides” we are seeing some sort of parallel to the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the “Garden of Eden” ? Shambhala, Agartha, and “The Hole at The Pole”. That there was some further mystery related to the Boreal region, is indicated in the myth of Shambhala , which is supposed to have emanated from the early lamas of Tibet. It is thought to have been an ancient realm once located somewhere in Asia - possibly in the Gobi - when it was still the Gobi Sea. It was thought to have been an island realm, called the “Sacred Island” which, in many respects seems to have been curiously similar to Thule or Hyperborea ! The mystery deepens when we learn that its inhabitants were the last survivors of the “White Island” which had perished long ages earlier! According to Madame Blavatsky , the inhabitants were descended from the Lemurians , but, since her information was alleged to be from a Theosophist, spiritual origin, we might be wiser in concluding that they were more likely to have been from Hyperboria-Thule! Shambhala. From some of the accounts available, Shambhala appears to have been a centre of spiritual enlightenment, very reminiscent of James Hilton’s “Shangri-La” , but others say that it was a centre of occult power and arcane teaching. Its leader was thought variously to be either an evil, tyrannical Sorcerer-King or a God-like “Lord of The World”. We seem to be left with a choice of which story we prefer to follow, and evidently which Path one desires to follow, too. The evil Left , or the good Right ! Apparently there were two factions (as in Hyperborea) , one of which followed the Golden Sun , and the other the Black Sun . (The “Black Sun”, incidentally, was as prominent an emblem of the Nazi mythos as was the Swastika !) According to Jean-Claude Frére, author of “Nazisme et Sociétiés Secretès”, the people of Hyperborea, after migrating to the Gobi Desert over 6000 years ago, founded a new centre, which they named Agartha. It became a great centre of world learning, and people flocked there from all over the world to enjoy its culture and civilization. However, a huge catastrophe supervened, and the earth’s surface was devastated, but the realm of Agartha somehow survived, under the earth. The legend continues to relate that, as with the original Hyperboreans, the Aryans now split into two factions:"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 one group heading north-west, hoping to return to their lost Hyperborea, and the second going south, where they founded a new secret centre under the Himalayas . Jean-Claude Frére concludes: The sons of the Outer Intellegences split into two groups, one following the “Right Hand Path” under the “Wheel of The Golden Sun”, the other the “Left Hand Path” under the “Wheel of the Black Sun”. The first preserved the centre of Agartha, that undefined place of contemplation, of the Good, and of the Vril force. The second supposedly created a new place of initiation at Shambhala, the city of violence in command of the elements and human masses, hastening the arrival of the “charnel-house of time.” A portent of the Jewish Holocaust in World War Two? The Aryan Swastika. As a matter of passing interest, in this connection of Right and Left Hand Paths, it’s intriguing to note that the swastika , which is a true Aryan symbol and represents a “square wheel”, has a duality in its symbolism. The right-handed swastika represents the “Wheel of the Golden Sun” and the Right Hand Path of Good, whereas the opposite applies to the left-handed swastika. Hitler chose the right-handed swastika as the emblem of his Nazi Party because it was the Aryan symbol of power and good fortune . The left-handed and far more appropriate one, he rejected, fearing that it might bring him evil and misfortune! That he was in error on both counts, is matter of history! Asgaard -Agartha. “Asgaard” in Norse mythology, is the Home of the Gods - rather like Olympus is to the Greeks, and strangely, a French student of Indian mythology, named Louis Jacolliot , tells us in one of his books on the subject, “Le Fils de Dieu” (“The Sons of God”), how local Brahmin priests in Villenoor told him the story of a place called “Asgartha”. It was known as the “City of The Sun”, and was the ancient seat of Brahmatma. It appeared to date back to 13,000 BC, and Jacolliot claimed it was there long before the advent of the Aryans. He completely discredited the Aryans, saying that they were merely a break-away caste of Brahmins . In 10,000 BC, these “Aryan Brahmins” rebelled against their priestly masters and took over Asgartha, forging an alliance with the other priests, who under their leadership became a warrior caste , instead. Later, in 5,000 BC, two Norse brothers, Ioda and Skandah, who invaded Hindustan from the Himalaya region, finally destroyed Asgartha, before being driven away by the Brahmin warrior-priests. These two, continued northward, back to their homeland, the land of the Norsemen. Here they became immortalised as “Odin” and “Scandinavia”. The Norse remembered the story so well, that when they set off to pillage Rome, they cried: “We go to sack Asgaard , the City of The Sun!” Thus the legend of Agartha was born, and it continued to crop up in legends always connected with the Aryans, the Brahmahatma , and various mysterious Mahatmas - including those who communicated with Madame Blavatsky and her Theosophists! Eventually, another French mystic investigator, Saint-Yves d’Alveydre , in 1886 revealed in his book, “Mission of India”, that Agartha is a hidden land beneath the surface of the earth , ruled over by a black sovereign Pontiff, called the Brahmatma. He goes on to say that the realm was shifted underground around 3,200 BC, at the beginning"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 of the Kali Yuga (or Golden Age) and that Agartha has known technology such as artificial lighting, mechanised transport, and even air-travel, far in advance of our own modern technology, for millennia! Periodically, Agartha sends emissaries to the upper world , about which it keeps well informed. Agartha also has huge libraries which enshrine the whole wisdom of the ages, engraved in stone. Many great secrets lie there, regarding many esoteric and spiritual subjects, including amazing skills and abilities long-forgotten by those who dwell on the surface. Fiction, Fantasy or Fact? His book, which reads like pure science-fantasy, bears a great resemblance to Bulwer-Lytton’s book “The Coming Race”, which also tells of an underground world of high-tech beings possessed of that mysterious “Vril” force , so keenly sought by the Nazis in World War II, and who will one day emerge from their subterranean realm to take over the surface! Saint-Yves insists that such a day really is coming, and that we will be totally defenceless against these super-beings, who will become the true world- rulers. Nor is he the only one to insist that this is true! Many other authors, mystics and investigators have attempted to solve this whole mystery, with varying degrees of success or failure. However, most seem to agree that Agharta and Shambhala seem to be closely connected, either as being one and the same place, or as two totally opposed realms, one of light and goodness the other of darkness and evil. The Holes at the Poles. However, it is only comparatively recently that they have again captured public attention through the alleged NASA photographs of the so-called “Hole at the Pole”, which seem to lend some positive evidence of what had been suspected for centuries. Namely, that there has always been a hole at either pole giving access to an inner earth , somewhat akin to Rice-Burroughs famous “Pellucidar ”, but with a highly advanced people and technology, instead of the wild, prehistoric surroundings, savages and animals with which Burroughs furnished his subterranean world! Scholars have written about these polar holes for centuries, and it would take several pages to go through their theories and notions, so I will avoid retelling the many legends of these “ entrances to the underworld ”. Some suggested giant maelstroms, down which careless sailors could be swept,. Others spoke of them as the portals of Hell itself. Yet others went so far as to describe fantastic voyages, whereby sailors entered at one pole and emerged safely at the other, after sailing an internal ocean and seeing a whole new world within, lit by a central sun! Science-fiction is not a new thing! However, to return to our subject. Let us now consider some of the more much modern views on this fascinating concept. In 1926, a young New England student, named Amadeo Giannini, had an “epiphanous experience” during which he was taken upon an angelically-conducted tour of a land beyond the polar regions, and shown the great, magical secret of the earth. That instead of us being dwellers upon the outside shell of the globe, we are in fact, living inside it ! The stars of the interior sky are actually simply distorted visions of the underside of the heavenly sky, although the sun actually exists in the centre of the earth"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 - though he does not present a coherent account of why (or how ) it sets at night, or rises in the morning! Giannini’s cosmology is, to say the least, unique, in that he is able to shift the inner earth’s shape to suit every difficulty he encounters. Sometimes it seems flat , and at others it’s like a doughnut ! Often his picture is of an infinite flattened disc with the earth surrounded by a polar-style ice barrier. Above, below and beyond all this disc- world the heavens extend into infinity. He even supported his wild fantasies with the discovery of land beyond the South Pole by Sir George Wilkin’s 1928 expedition, and also with Rear-Admiral Richard Byrd’s polar fights in 1947 . Then, later still, he alleged that the U.S. expedition of 1956 had flown over 2000 miles beyond the South Pole! Naturally, Giannini’s ideas were ridiculed by science, although he did attract a lot of attention from the “flying-saucer” fraternity. There have been several other claimants to “indisputable knowledge”of the existence of these polar holes, and some have even heard first-hand accounts of trips in flying-saucers into their depths! However, here we are getting into another realm altogether, as there are those“UFOlogists” who believe that “flying-saucers” are not from outer space at all, but are actually “Vimana” craft sent from the inner earth, to keep watch upon our outer surface activities. The King of The World. Whilst this entire business of Shambala and/or Agharta might appear to be merely a fantasy, there are many who believe that they really exist, either as an underground realm, or as a lost city, hidden away somewhere in the Himalayas. It is also called “ Paradesa ”, the University of Esoteric Knowledge , and a large number of travellers and mystics claim to have visited the city over the past century, in search of spiritual and occult enlightenment. The leader of the Aghartans, by the way, is claimed to be “The King Of The World”, the Metraton and the “High Lord of Agharta”, and, according to Ray Palmer and Richard Shaver ( who wrote the “Shaver Mysteries”, published in “Amazing Stories” in the 1940s), he is said to be a Venusian , who came here thousands of years ago from the planet Venus (then orbiting between Mars and Jupiter) to instruct and guide our then dawn-age humanity. According to “witnesses”, notwithstanding his enormous age, he still appears youthful and very well-developed! However, despite this seemingly altruistic desire to help humanity, there are other accounts which say that Agartha is really a centre for evil occult forces bent upon our destruction, and Metraton is identified with Set , the Egyptian god of the Underworld and Evil, who is, in fact, none other than Satan. (The name “Satan” was originally derived from “Set . ” ) It would seem appropriate then that, if this were so, that this Satan should be from the very planet which now so closely resembles the real hell which Venus has now become, according to Russian “Venera” lander photos! Also if this person were Satan, his incalculable age yet continuing youth would also be accounted for, as would his title of “Prince, or Ruler of This World”, since Satan is thus styled by no less an authority than Jesus Christ , in the New Testament of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 the Christian Bible ! There is some additional support for this concept in the earlier comment that Venus was also referred to as Lucifer , The Morning Star. “Lucifer” was, of course, the original Archangelic name of Satan! And, let us not forget the the coming World Dictator prophesied in the Biblical Book of Revelation , the so-called seven-headed Beast , whose name will add up to 666 . The number of all evil incarnate The Switched Swastika? Thus we are faced with the possibility that the alleged Right-Hand Path / Left Hand Path positions as they relate to Agharta and Shambala , respectively, might well have been deliberately switched , and that the opposite may be the truth. This could also apply to the direction of “rotation” of the swastika, to right or left, since, when we compare a swastika with a spiral galaxy - with regard to its “arms” and direction of rotation - the swastika-emblem of the Nazis then really does becomes a left-handed one! The Aryan symbol of Evil and Misfortune! . Oddly enough, and whilst we are discussing all these curious coincidences, it is worth remembering that Hell was always believed, even when I was a youngster, to be a huge underworld region deep inside our own earth! Modernist Christian thinking has since come up with the concept of a Planet Heaven and a Planet Hell , but perhaps the old beliefs might have had some reasonable foundation in fact - if such an evil inner realm of Agartha does exist. Nicholas Roerich. Before I close this brief introduction to the Inner Earth mythos, I should perhaps make mention of Nicholas Roerich , who was a famous Russian explorer, artist and mystic, who traversed these mysterious regions during the 1920s and 30s in search of adventure and enlightenment. Roerich was particularly interested in the lost realm of Shambala, about which he later wrote a book, entitled simply enough “Shambhala” published in 1930, along with “Himalayas: Abode of Light” and “Heart of Asia”, among others. At one time, Roerich had possession of a “magical stone from another world” which was known as the Chintamani Stone. It was supposed to have come from the Sirius star system, and ancient Asian chronicles said it been given to Tazlavoo , the Emperor of Atlantis , by an angelic messenger from the skies. Legend says that it was sent from Tibet to King Solomon in Israel on a vimana airship (one of which he was also believed to have owned)! The stone, which is said to have had magical properties, is believed to have been Moldavite, a magnetic stone which is sold in many crystal shops, and is thought to have fallen in a shower of meteors some 15 million years ago. (The sacred black stone inside the Kabah at Mecca, which all Muslims venerate, is also a fragment of meteorite, and could well be of the same Moldavite stone). Roerich wrote of Shambala in his book that: “Shambhala itself is the Holy Place, where the earthly world links with the higher states of consciousness...many speculations have been made about the location of the earthly Shambhala. Certain indications put this place in the extreme North, explaining that the rays of Aurora Borealis are the rays of Shambhala.... but this"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 is incorrect, Shambhala is only north in relation to India , being perhaps on the Pamir, in Turkestan, or in the Central Gobi...” He associates it with the underground city of “Agharti” and with the “White Island”, and that its “Splendid Valley” is reached via subterranean passages from the Himalayas. He further adds that “the underground caverns of Central Asia are inhabited to this day by the people called the Agharti, or Chud, and that when the time of purification comes, say the legends, they will emerge in their glory”. The Religion of Shambala. If one can properly describe it as a religion, according to Roerich, that of Shambala is of Fire. He relates it to the old cults of Fire and Sun , and the Swastika is its emblem, found carved or painted everywhere. He definitely associates it with the Aryan Race . However, it was not only confined to Buddhist temples. He found it also connected to Bön-Po , a pre-Buddhist Black Faith “which reveres some mysterious gods of the Swastika.” He said that they drew the symbol counter-clockwise or left- handed - which, as we’ve seen, was the version chosen by the Nazis ! (There seems to also be some confirmation here that “Bön-Po” was adopted by the Aghartis.) Flying Saucers and Atom Power. It was on August 5th, 1927, that Roerich and his party had a typical UFO sighting, 20 years before Kenneth Arnold saw his in 1947. “We saw, in a direction from north to south, something big and shiny reflecting the sun, like a huge oval moving at great speed. Crossing our camp, this thing changed in its direction from south to south west. And we saw how it dis-appeared in the intense blue sky. We even had time to take our field glasses and saw quite distinctly an oval form with a shiny surface, one side of which was brilliant from the sun.” According to a lama who was travelling with Roerich’s group, this was a good omen ”A very good sign.” he said . “We are protected. Rigden-Jyepo himself is looking after us!” He was referring to the prophesied “Lord of Shambala’s New Era” . The “Ruler of The World”, “Maitreya”, the “Last Avatar of the Kali Yuga”, who was to herald in a New Age - somewhat as Christ is to bring in the new Millennium of Peace upon the earth. however, there is reference to an esoteric college of astrology, which was to be established in Urga (Ulan Bator, Mongolia) “as a centre from which comes the impulse for the imminent renewal of humanity, and to a Lord, King or Ruler of the World who is neither Christ nor Lucifer”. It’s of interest to note that in the mid-1980s, a full-page advertisement appeared in all the world’s leading daily newspapers announcing the imminent revelation of the “Maitreya”, who would appear to everyone in the world simultaneously, whether by direct sight or by television. I personally still have a copy, in my files of this advertisement! (But, as I write this, almost twenty years later, he still hasn’t put in an appearance!) Roerich’s wife, Helena, herself a mystic, wrote in her own book, ”Agni Yoga” about the Agni or Fire of Shambhala , and how it will be used in the New Age, describing it as “ the great eternal energy, this fine imponderable matter which is"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 scattered everywhere and which is within our use at any moment”. Roerich himself said of this same power in the 1940s: “energies of cosmic fire will approach the earth and create many new conditions of life”. Joscelyn Godwin comments in his book, “Arktos, The Polar Myth”, “This could be a definition of Bulwer-Lytton’s Vril force .....if Nicholas Roerich, the indefatigable worker for world peace, had known the form in which Agni would be compelled to manifest in 1945, he might have been more cautious in recommending it...” It seems patently clear that this Agni fire , or Vril force, (which appear to be the same thing) could only have been what we nowadays describe as atomic energy! Anyhow, the foregoing should more than suffice for the historic background to the Hollow or Inner Earth concept, so I shall now pass on to the theory itself. Whence The “Hollow Earth” Theory? It was Sir Edmund Halley , the 17th century astronomer who discovered Halley’s Comet, who first suggested a hollow earth. His idea was that it comprised three concentric spheres, that each supported life and which had at their centre a white-hot shining core. He ascribed the shifting of the earth’s magnetic poles to their movements one within another. This might sound rather crackpot, until one considers that other reputable scientists have deduced that “polar wander” might be due to slippage of the mesosphere within the lithosphere, or the slippage of the latter over the former, as hypothesised by people like Wegener and Hapgood. A theological dabbler in Science, Thomas Burnet , in his book “Sacred Theory of the Earth”, proposed that the waters of the oceans came out of a hole at the North Pole , but only in accordance with Divine Will, as and when required for Deluges and suchlike Heaven-sent catastrophes, but not as a continuous, self-sustained process of replenishment. Alexander Colcott of Bristol subscribed somewhat to Burnet’s idea, in 1768, but he chose to posit a hollow sphere , with an inner surface covered by a vast ocean. In his view, the biblical Flood was caused when this welled up to the outer surface through a polar gap. However, none of these thought of a hollow earth that had land and a central sun , which could be the habitation of humanoid and animal life. Nor did they conceive of any connection between holes at both ends of the earth. (Perhaps this was because the South Polar land-mass had still to be discovered.) This expansion of possibilities was left, as I have mentioned earlier, to the writers of popular fantasy- fiction, from the 17th century to the present-day. Particularly writers of the so-called Romantic Era , like Edgar Allen Poe , with his great story, “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym”, and Bulwer-Lytton’s “The Coming Race”, not to mention Jules Verne’s immortal classics: ”Voyage To The Centre Of The Earth” and “The Sphinx of the Ice”. Plus, of course, the unrivalled Edgar Rice Burroughs series of adventure"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 tales of “Pellucidar” and “At The Earth’s Core” , etc; which I shall be mentioning again later in this article. Three Possible Kinds of Hollow Earth... Before I go on to describe and discuss this intriguing subject, I must point out that there are really three types of subterranean “world” which are implied under the general heading “Hollow Earth”. The first of these is really just what it says - a planetary outer rocky crust, or “shell”, of variable thickness (600 to 800 miles), surrounding a vast, open or hollow spherical centre that is usually said to be illuminated by a small central “sun” of some kind. This inner world, which has a largely similar surface to the outer one - except that the ratio of the amount of dry land to ocean is generally reversed (i.e: four-fifths of land to one-fifth of ocean) - is usually described as being accessible by means of polar- openings or “holes” through the axial regions of the Earth’s crust, as well as by means of extremely deep cavern-systems which connect both the outer and inner surfaces. It is supposed to be the home of a highly intellectual humanoid race which fled there many millennia ago to avoid an external world-catastrophe, and who now have no wish to contact present surface-dwellers because of their experimenting with nuclear devices and other stupidly dangerous technologies, which are bringing about the general destruction of the surface environment and atmosphere. It is also thought that these same “Inner-Earth” dwellers are responsible for the so-called UFOs, which are said to exit and re-enter the Inner-Earth through the polar-openings, and are used simply to monitor our activities - especially those which threaten the global safety and integrity of the Earth. The second “Inner-Earth” theory actually refers to extensive systems of either natural or “engineered” caverns and tunnels , deep within the Earth’s crust, which are claimed to be occupied by very ancient “alien” humanoid races, somewhat akin to our own, but not particularly well-disposed toward modern humans on the outer surface. These peoples are said to subsist on hydroponically-grown vegetables, fungi, and subterranean animals of various kinds (as well as, in some cases, captured surface- animals (including humans ), and have developed their own mysterious societies along with strange forms of technology to suit their trogloditic environment. Their caverns are usually lit by some form of electrical or natural fluorescent energy, which possesses the same life-giving as, but more benevolent qualities than naked sunlight. They, too, are often said to have retreated underground in very ancient times to escape catastrophes that were about to envelope the Earth’s surface. However, some accounts claim them to be variously either extraterrestrials, fallen-angels, demons, hominid reptoids or the more esoteric creatures of human fable, such as trolls, dwarfs, elves - or even yetis and sasquatch! But Don’t Laugh Just Yet! Before we laughingly dismiss any possible existence of such mythical creatures, let us pause for a moment, and recall that all of the nations, both current and archaic, of the surface-world possess ancient legendary traditions regarding weird and eldritch"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 dwellers in the “Underworld”, and the continuing persistence of such tales implies that there must have once been at least some substance to such fables for them to crop up so universally and often identically in world folklore! Many ancient folk-legends claim that our own human race originated in just such a subterranean world - and that many of the wicked among us will probably end up in one, too. Hell , perhaps? The third inner-earth hypothesis is perhaps the most utterly incredible-sounding theory of the three - except that it embodies several key elements of the accepted modern laws of physics and relativity, which, strangely enough, render it beyond all repudiation by anyone who considers themselves to be true disciples of modern academic science! I will not expand on this curious mystery at this stage, lest I might inadvertently reveal too much of this quite astounding concept too early in the piece! I think I shall save this one for the last, in the much the same manner as a dinner-host might reserve an irresistable dessert to add the final fillip to an already sumptuous banquet! A Matter of Considerable Gravity. One final point I should perhaps raise (before my critics do) is the scientific feasibility of such a thing as a hollow earth being able to even exist under what we currently understand to be the natural physical laws that govern our universe! I cannot undertake to answer these likely objections or questions in highly technical detail, since I do not possess a university doctorate, or even a plain degree in physics. All I can rely upon is simple common-sense and what basic science and physics I learned in school - or have picked up since (which fortunately amounts to considerably more !) One of the first considerations is that of pure gravity . Could such a hollow Earth ever have formed in the first place, under the generally-accepted theory of cosmic-dust accretion ascribed by modern science to the planets of the solar system? The immediate academic, orthodox scientific answer would seem to be an emphatic “ No! ” That is, until we look more closely into possible ways in which it could have become hollow since its original accretion into a spherical mass! This could have happened in two or three different ways, but I will focus here on the one which sounds the more feasible to most lay-persons. And that is by an axial spin- induced centrifuging effect upon the heavy material and elements that lie underneath the Earth’s crust, together with a corresponding hollowing of the planet’s centre and the shrinkage of its hypothetical radioactive core to form a central internal luminary. Orthodox science, of course, confidently continues to assert that the Earth’s core is probably made up of highly-compressed nickel-iron ; in either a heated solid or a white- hot liquid state - even though there is no possible way of actually knowing or proving that such truly is the case! Note how the word “probably ” tends to crop up with alarming frequency in “Cast-In-Stone”scientific text-books, but, in my view, it really stands for “ theoretically ”. And, since anyone is perfectly entitled to formulate a theory about anything , I will now exercise that entitled freedom to set forth my own hypothesis regarding the possibility of the Earth being hollow!"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 Some Basically Acceptable Precepts Let us accept, for the sake of argument, the general notion that the sun and the planets was formed out of a swirling mass of cosmic dust and gas in one of the far-flung “limbs” of matter trailing out from our spiralling Milky Way galaxy. Because everything in the universe is demonstrably in motion, and all nebulae and galaxies rotate about their “hubs” or axes, so also had the mass of cosmic material which was to form our solar system itself been imparted with a swirling motion. As it swirled, the amorphous mass of space-debris, dust and gas began to steadily coalesce into a central lump of matter, and, as the lump increased in size and mass, its gravity also grew, attracting more and more material by accretion into its growing and rotating bulk. Soon this gestating star, our Sun, had begun to form into a dimly-glowing ball, steadily developing greater heat as its material rapidly became compacted by the ever- increasing pressure of its mass. And, as its rotation increased more and more, eddies began to develop in the wide, circular “skirt” or disc of residual matter which swung around with it. Now these swirling eddies themselves began to attract and accrete matter also, and to rotate ever faster as they grew in mass. These proto-planetary masses were, of course, still orbiting in the same basic plane as the original disc of dust and gas, at a 90º angle to the solar axis and parallel with the equator of the burgeoning Sun, which held them firmly in place, almost perfectly-balanced, through the opposition of strong gravitational and centrifugal forces. These rotating proto-planets, now having settled into steady orbits, gradually accelerated their rates of axial revolution as they grew in size and mass, building themselves up into individual, roughly-globular bodies. They steadily continued to pack themselves tighter and denser as they swiftly accreted more and more dust, gas and debris from the last remnants of the original cloud of matter. Eventually, instead of sporting a swirling ‘skirt’ of disorganised cosmic material, the already-luminous Sun now turned swiftly upon its axis, pulling along with it a burgeoning family of developing planets . Each of these was now becoming spherical in shape* and rotating rapidly about their own axes, and they had now begun to glow redly, to varying degrees, according to their size and distance from their parent. This was due to the enormous internal heat produced by their own gravitational compression and consequential friction of particles of matter. Because of this increasing, self-generated heat, the cosmic debris of which the fledgling planets were composed now began to turn from glowing cindery clinker into molten magma - a thick cosmic “hot-pot” of assorted elements. (*However, I have since come to another likely conclusion re the formation of planets and stars, which is included later in this article as a “Speculative Discourse on Hollow Planet Formation” GF) So Far, So Good! But it is here that we must part company with the accepted orthodox view of the development of the planets, and consider certain natural physical laws which had by now come into play - and which orthodox science appears to have overlooked in its complacency! Also, let it be clearly understood that, even among those of us who do not blindly accept all the dogmas of orthodox science and physics, there are certain groups who do not accept the concept of “gravity” and other kindred “forces” as such, preferring"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 instead, to substitute the attraction and repulsion effects of electro-magnetism, the pressure of light-photons, “soft-ether” particles and other such natural phenomena and photo-electrical effects, in their stead. However, for the express benefit of those who are newcomers to this “Hollow Earth” theory, rather than cloud the basic “Hollow Earth and Planets” issue with any internecine wranglings over what are really secondary issues in the fundamental debate, I will couch my argument in terms of the more commonly-understood Newtonian physical “Laws” and science. Gravity Versus Centrifugal Force. Orthodox science has thus far worked upon the assumption that, because the planets were once molten balls of magma, and because all of the terrestrial planets (with the possible sole exception of Venus) now possess solid surfaces, they must have cooled gradually, from the outside inwards, until a hard crust of rock (the lithosphere) had formed and that this cooling process is still gradually advancing inwards toward their cores. Mercury and Mars are assumed , in scientific circles, to have already solidified right through. Thus, it is plain that the main bulk of scientists assume that these planets are all basically solid or solidifying bodies. (Science makes many assumptions !) Hidden Effects Inside the Earth. However, what seems to have been overlooked (perhaps because there has been no reason to think of the terrestrial planets otherwise than simply as balls of once-molten magma which are all in the process of cooling to a completely solid state) , is exactly how they were formed, and what hidden effects that formative process might well have produced internally. I’ve mentioned above that the two principal forces which caused the planets to form as Science claims they have, are gravity and centrifugal force. We have noted how, as the eddying matter which formed each planet gathered together and accreted, first into an amorphous mass, then into a discrete body, and then - partly because of the Sun’s own rotation, but largely because all such forming bodies of accreting matter in the universe, whether they be planets, stars, or nebulae - seems to acquire a self-imparted rotary motion in obedience to an as yet ill-defined set of physical laws which govern this universal tendency in all celestial objects toward rotation . This phenomenon can best be understood if one visualises an ice-skater who slowly starts to rotate his body on a particular spot, with his arms outstretched. Then, as he draws his arms in toward his body, his rotation (or angular momentum ) begins to increase, until he is spinning around very rapidly indeed. This angular momentum is actually the product of inertia (which is the tendency of a body to retain its state of “rest” or uniform motion in a straight line) and angular velocity (which is the rate of its motion through an angle , about an axis ). The accreting planets are already locked in a struggle between the forces of angular momentum and inertia, since they are already in motion around the Sun, but they are also held in orbit as its gravitational prisoners, so that their tendency to fly off in a straight line is prevented. It’s this paradoxical combination and opposition of physical forces that sets up the angular momentum to begin with, and as the accreting mass of matter forms rapidly into a highly-compressed shape, the angular momentum ( axial spin) increases considerably, just like that of our body-hugging skater.."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 I guess this may all sound fairly technical, but if you can imagine our skater spinning faster and faster as he draws himself together into a tightly-compacted form, you can likewise imagine the Earth picking up rotary speed as it becomes more and more ball-shaped. However, let us return to the orthodox mechanics of the matter. What happened inside the rapidly-rotating Earth as it spun so rapidly upon its axis? (Remember that, although its cooling crust, under the deep cold of space may have swiftly begun to solidify into rock, the underlying highly-heated magma inside the Earth would still have been in a molten, semi-fluid and mobile state). Again, perhaps we can use another imaginary illustration from our own everyday experience, to illustrate this interesting point. By Way of Illustration. If we picture the Earth at that stage of its development to be a sort of gigantic vertical washing-machine doing its “Spin” cycle, with its solidifying crust as the wall of the washing-machine’s tub - or its gravitational “shell” , if you like - we can imagine how the heavy molten matter and elements would be thrown up against the inside of the solidified crust , in very much the same way that the wet clothes in the washer-tub are plastered around its drum-wall - by centrifugal force ! This would leave an empty space or hollow core around the central or vertical axis of the tub, just as we discover upon opening it, although the centrifugal force would be virtually none existent along the whole central axis of rotation of both the tub and the Earth! This effect is demonstrably true of any naturally (or mechanically) rotating body of matter. Also, since the mass of the tub’s contents would no longer be in the centre of the tub, the location of the centre of gravity would be moved away from the central area, and instead of being a single focal point, the gravitational locus would now form a circular configuration or field. A typical example of this effect would be the vortex created when one removes the plug from a wash-basin or bath full of water. The centrifugal effect comes into play very swiftly and the centre of the vortex is left open and clear of water. The same phenomenon is also seen in any revolving storm, such as a hurricane, cyclone, or a spinning tornado, where the centre of the vortex is the open “eye”. And the same rule is true of all naturally-revolving objects throughout the universe, whether nebulae or galaxies (or even black-holes ) , where the main central bulk of the object has not yet compacted into a solid mass. It appears that, wherever this particular clash of natural physical forces occurs, the phenomenon of rotation is always the natural outcome, and with such a rotation comes centrifugal (or centripetal ) force, and this invariably produces a central vortex-tube or core-aperture of some kind! The centre of gravitational force in such a vortex would be somewhere in the walls of its tube – not down the open centre of the tube’s axis, which would be gravity free. (Hence Dorothy’s home being lifted up the “eye” of the whirlwind in “The Wizard of Oz” ! There was no gravity inside the vortex to hold it down!) Get the picture? (If not - get the video and see for yourself!)"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 Another (rather messy) Example. The same effect as that found inside the spinning washing-machine would apply if we were to fill a child’s educational “Globe of the World” with piping-hot, sloppy mashed-potato or milky porridge, then spin it at high speed for a while until it cooled off. Upon opening it up, we would (hopefully) find the mushy mashed potato or porridge now tightly compacted around the inside of the globe, with its thickest deposit plastered around the inside of the equatorial region of the globe and a sizeable empty space in the centre. We would probably also be surprised to discover that, at the polar ends of the globe’s axis, there would be only a very thin deposit - if, in fact, any at all ! (You can test this for yourself - but don’t sue me for a new World Globe!) This same effect, incidentally, can also be observed in any DIY concrete-mixer, as many of us may have perhaps already discovered to our cost – especially if we forgot to sluice the drum out with water and left its contents to set overnight! Agreed? The reason why there is little or no matter deposited at the poles of the toy Globe’s axis is the same as that applicable to our “Spin-Cycled” washing-machine tub - and it is my contention (along with that of many others more knowledgeable than I) , that this same phenomenon could equally well, and quite logically, apply to the Earth and the other planets, (even the stars, too) due precisely to the same set of circumstances, physical laws and mechanics being brought into play! Unfortunately many scholars who draw diagrams of hollow planets forget to take into account this added effect of the centrifugal force caused by the planet’s rotation, so their diagrams are not entirely accurate. Incidentally, I should make some mention of the known fact that it is this same centrifugal force which causes the Earth to bulge outward to some extent at the equator, and to flatten somewhat at the poles. In short, its exterior is more of a horizontally oblate shape. This means that the Earth’s crustal shell is markedly thicker around the equator than it is at the axial poles. Thus the interior of a hollow rotating Earth would not be so much spherical as vertically oblate in shape. But apart from this added centrifugal force acting upon its interior, and making objects or people around the inner equator a shade heavier, the general overall effect, gravity-wise, would be fundamentally similar to that in a non-rotating planet. Any gravity-free zone at the axial centre would, of course, be similarly vertically oblate. Still Have Any Doubts? I would suggest to anyone who may have any reservations about this “internal- centrifuge” concept that they really ought to go and fully load up their washing-machine, do the washing, then carefully observe the Spin-Cycle and its subsequent effect upon the articles washed. The laundry items, (which represent the accreted cosmic material or magma inside the developing planet), are flung outwards against the rotating drum, and the centre remains open and clear. The fact that the rotating-drum of the washing- machine is a cylinder , whilst the Earth is a sphere , really makes little difference. Obviously, if the machine continued to operate on “Spin Dry” indefinitely ( as is the case with our Earth) , the washed items (or magma) would eventually solidify around"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 the sides, just as would happen to the mashed potato in our child’s World Globe experiment, or the hard-setting mixture of cement, sand and gravel, in the concrete-mixer. But the centre , in all three cases - as with our hypothetical Hollow Earth - would always remain hollow to some greater or lesser degree! However. Don’t forget to make mental allowances for the actual downward pull of our Earth’s gravity, in these experiments . (Unfortunately, you and I cannot try them out in the free-fall “zero-G” of a space orbit!) If nothing else, this exercise (beside getting some of the washing done, ruining a perfectly good toy Globe, or gunking up a concrete-mixer) , should give any “Doubting Thomases” good cause to reflect upon the implications of this combination of simple and observable physical laws when applied to such a situation on so vast a scale as the formation of a planet! However, I believe that I’ve laboured this particular point far enough for the moment, so I will leave it there for the time being and move on to those other very closely-associated phenomena of our Hollow Earth theory - the “ Holes at the Poles” and the “Central Sun”! The Holes at The Poles. Most accounts and descriptions of these entrances to the Earth’s interior include huge holes, apertures, or suchlike anomalies at either or both polar caps. These have been “reported” and hinted at in some of the more dubious accounts of otherwise reputable polar explorers and adventurers as being anything between 100 and 1400 miles in diameter! Among the notable people who are claimed to have encountered these strange phenomena is the renowned American, Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd , who flew all over the northern polar icecap in 1947, and over Antarctica in 1956, on aerial exploratory expeditions. His astonishing reported accounts of the strange phenomena he met with, are a matter of uncertainty, but I refer my reader to the many accounts of his alleged findings in works by other authors. Other famous explorers who encountered similar (but more verifiable) baffling anomalies in the vicinity of the North Pole include Dr. Frederick Cook , in 1908, and Rear Admiral Peary , in 1909. And long before any of these, the famous Norwegian polar explorer, Fridtjof Nansen , had some extremely eerie experiences during his Arctic expedition in search of the North Pole in 1885-86. Many other explorers have had the same sort of uncanny experiences at the poles since, but I will again have to refer the reader to the multitudinous accounts, on the Internet and elsewhere, of their astonishing discoveries, in order to save myself having to write down page after repetitive page of these very similar amazing and often quite incredible reports. However, first things first ! I think I should explain a few salient background points about the poles before going any further! Some Background. In his famous book: “ The Hollow Earth ” , Dr. R. W. Bernard , B.A., M.A., PhD. went into some considerable detail about the widely-held belief in the Earth being"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 hollow, and he was able to unearth some intriguing data to support his own support for this belief. I will quote a few notable extracts from his engrossing work. First, he deals with the scientific assumption that the Earth is a solid body by saying this - and I quote: “ The belief in the Earth having a fiery center probably arose from the fact that the deeper one penetrates into the Earth, the warmer it gets. But it is a far-fetched assumption to suppose that this increase in temperature continues until the center of the Earth. There is no evidence to support this view. It is more probable that the increase of temperature continues only until we reach the level where volcanic lava and earthquakes originate, probably due to the existence of much radioactive substances there. But after we pass through this layer of maximum heat, there is no reason why it should not get cooler and cooler as we get nearer and nearer to the Earth’s center. “The total surface of the Earth is 197 million square miles and its estimated weight is six sextillion tons. If the Earth was a solid sphere, its weight would be much greater. this is one of the scientific evidences that the Earth has a hollow interior. The author believes that the truest conception of the structure of the Earth is based on the idea that when it was in a molten state during its formation, centrifugal force caused the heavier substances to be thrown outward, toward its periphery, in the form of rocks and metals to form its outer crust, leaving its interior hollow, with openings at the poles, where centrifugal force was less (or none existent) and where there was a lesser tendency to throw materials outward, which was greater at the equator, causing the bulging of the earth in this region. It has been estimated that as a result of the Earth’s rotation on its axis during its formative state, polar depressions and openings thus formed would measure about 1,400 miles in diameter. “Also we shall present below evidence to indicate that some of the original fire and incandescent (possibly atomic) materials (may have) remained in the center of the Earth to form a central sun, much smaller, of course, than our sun , (in fact quite miniscule by comparison) but capable of emitting light and supporting plant growth. We shall also see that the Aurora Borealis or streaming lights that illuminate the Arctic sky at night come from this central sun whose rays shine through the polar opening. “Thus, if the Earth was originally a ball of fire and molten metal, some of this fire remained in its center, while centrifugal force as a result of its rotation on its axis caused its solid matter to be thrown toward the surface, forming a solid crust and leaving its interior hollow, with a fiery ball in its center, forming the central sun, which provides illumination (and heat!) for plant, animal and human life”.    (Parenthetical comments and emphases are mine. GF) Bernard goes on to mention that the first person to present this theory of a hollow earth with holes at its poles was an American philosopher, William Reed , author of the book: “ Phantom of the Poles ” , which was published in 1906. A book which provides the first compilation of scientific knowledge, based on the reports of Arctic explorers, supporting the theory of a hollow earth with polar openings. Reed apparently estimated the crust of the Earth to be around 800 miles thick at the equator, and that its hollow"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 interior is 6,400 miles in diameter. Reed summarised his revolutionary theory thus – and again I quote: “The earth is hollow. The poles, so long sought, are phantoms. There are openings at the northern and southern extremities. In the interior there are vast continents, oceans, mountains and rivers. Vegetable and animal life are evident in this New World, and it is probably peopled by races unknown to dwellers on the Earth’s surface”. He also pointed out that the Earth is not a true sphere, but is flattened at the poles, or rather it begins to flatten out as one approaches the hypothetical North or South Pole - which really do not exist because the openings to its hollow interior occur there. Hence the (imaginary) Poles are really positioned in mid-air, in the centres of these polar openings, and are not actually on the surface, as would-be discoverers of the Poles suppose. He goes on to add that the Poles cannot be discovered because the Earth is hollow at its Pole points, “which exist in mid-air, due to the existence there of the polar openings leading into its interior”. Then Reed goes on to stress that, when explorers believed they had reached the Poles, they were actually misled by the eccentric behaviour of the compass in high latitudes, both north and south . He claims that this was what happened in the case of Peary and Cook , neither of whom really reached the North Pole. Let us just take a few moments off and examine this particular problem in greater depth. Problems with Compasses. According to all the evidence I have discovered thus far, virtually all the great polar explorers experienced serious problems with their magnetic compasses once they had passed the 80º to 85º latitudes, and found that their compass-needles performed all sorts of erratic swings, dips and rises. As we have noted, this happened to both Peary and Cook, and caused them to miss the North Pole completely, just as it did to many others, before them and since. Admiral Byrd’s aerial expedition certainly had problems with their instruments, as he noted in his log how both his magnetic and gyroscopic compasses began to “gyrate and wobble” so much that they were “unable to hold our heading by instrumentation”. However, being fairly high up in an aircraft, he managed to take bearings with a sun- compass , and this told him he was approaching the pole. (But I shall have to return later to Byrd’s polar flight, since it proved to be such a totally amazing one!) A famous Russian polar explorer, Snegirev , told how the magnetic pole “made some kind of tricky curve ” making it “inconvenient to travel by compass alone. The arrow would point northward, then it would veer to the west, and then almost reluctantly it would return to its former position”. Dr. Raymond writes in his book: “ The Hollow Earth ”, how this weird action of the compass had “been observed by many Arctic explorers, who, after reaching high latitudes near to 90 degrees, were dumbfounded by the inexplicable action of the compass and its tendency to point vertically upward ”. He then goes on to add, by way of explanation, that: “They were then inside the polar opening and the compass pointed to the North Magnetic Pole which was along the rim of the opening ”! (Emphases are again mine. GF.)"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 Ray Palmer , American author and editor of several sensational magazines connected with mysterious phenomena, mentioned in an editorial article entitled “ The North Pole - Russian Style ” , in which he described “remarkable discoveries made by Russian Arctic explorers, which confirm the theory of a hollow earth and polar openings, as do the observations of Arctic explorers to which we shall refer below”. I cannot quote his article in full here, but I will quote an extract from it which is pertinent in this age of daily over-flights of the pole by commercial and military aircraft. It says this: “One of the things we have been most insistent about is that no one has yet been to the North Pole, all claims to having done so being false, because the Pole is not a ‘point’ and cannot be ‘ reached ’ in the accepted sense of the word. We have successfully challenged those military and civilian pilots who have claimed that they fly ‘daily’ over the north Pole. In the case of the military flyer, we have pointed out the maneuver which is standard, which automatically makes it impossible for him to fly beyond the Pole by flying straight across it. (That is across the polar opening, instead of going into it - Author.) Because of navigating difficulties stemming from compasses of all kinds”. “A ‘lost’ flyer (whose compass doesn’t work as it should) regains his bearings by making a turn in any direction, until his compasses again resume function. In the case of commercial airlines, whose advertised boast is that they fly twice daily over the Pole , they are simply stretching the truth.....(They simply cross over the magnetic rim of the polar opening , where the compass registers the highest degree north, but do not actually reach the North Pole , which is the central point of the polar opening inside this rim - Author.)”  (The emphases placed on parts of the foregoing extracts, incidentally, are my own – GF.) However - A Word of Caution... I should point out that, according to reported past geological surveys in the Arctic Ocean, the ocean was said to deepen considerably as the 85-degree latitude was approached. Nansen himself sounded it at that latitude and found it to be over 2,000 fathoms (12,000 feet), and he noted that it continued to deepen as he ventured further. (The latest official bathymetric depth-figure for the estimated North Pole ocean-bed position is 13,600 feet). However, I must also add that more recent bathymetric oceanographic charts of the Arctic sea-bed show two large and parallel ridges enclosing the polar abyssal plain, where the North Pole is believed to be. (Though no one can really be certain , even today, because of persistent magnetic-compass aberrations). These are the Lomonosov Ridge and the Nansen Cordillera (also known as the Gakkel Ridge on some maps) , which are 400 or 500 km apart, and would thus seem to considerably limit the largest size or diameter of any possible polar-hole to a maximum of less than 400 kilometres or so, rather than the earlier claims for holes over 1000 kilometres or more across! (Personally, after studying data and computer-images based upon satellite Earth- topography radar scans, I think that the “polar hole” (if it exists at all) may prove to be less than 100 km in diameter.)"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 As a matter of special interest; I only recently stumbled upon an Internet report concerning a Swedish polar research expedition which departed upon 12 July, 1996 , in the ice-breaker, Oden , to study climatic and environmental developments around the innermost circumpolar regions of the Arctic. Oden was to be accompanied by the German research-vessel, Polarstern . These two ships had cooperated very successfully before, during the 1991 IAOE (International Arctic Ocean Research Expedition) , when they claimed to have actually reached the North Pole - by water ! I was particularly interested to learn that one of their geological objectives was to study the Arctic Polar Basin sea-bed by using remote-sensing apparatus and to deep core-drill parts of it and the surrounding Lomonosov Ridge and Nansen Cordillera. I have yet to locate the ultimate findings of this expedition, but will include them in these notes if and when they eventually come to hand! They should make interesting reading! ...And a Few Words of Optimism, too! But, we should not lose sight of the fact that some of these polar depths could very well have been “guesstimates” or “fudged” figures, due simply to the patently obvious impossibility of taking an oceanic-survey vessel right around, let alone through , the central, solidly-frozen Arctic ice-pack, and even nuclear submarines would still be dependent upon magnetic- compass bearings for their precise positions! Perhaps, if the same sort of satellite-mounted, Martian orbiting laser-altimeter (or MOLA ) - such as was used to map the depths, heights and general topography of the Martian surface - could be employed to try and resolve this and many other strange mysteries of our own terrestrial ocean-depths - such as the notorious Bermuda Triangle (for explanation of vanished ships and planes) , the south western Pacific Ocean (for traces of the lost continent of Mu ), the Indian Ocean (for evidences of Lemuria ), and the Antarctic continent (for some signs of a possible southern polar-hole , and perhaps even of a lost Atlantis there, beneath the huge icecap) , we just might begin to learn a lot more about our own planet, and, also in this way, a lot more about the actual internal structure of the other terrestrial planets, also! It is my own humble opinion that there is still a vast amount of exploration and discovery left to be done both upon and inside our own planet, which would involve infinitely less cost in money, time, and effort than that which is currently being expended on the apparently fruitless exploration of space! (Of which more later.) Not that I have the slightest objection to our exploring our neighbouring planets, of course, but I think we should find out all we can about our own still very mysterious and enigmatic planet first ! Some Relevant Points to Consider..... Before passing on to other interesting aspects of this “ Hollow Earth ” concept, let me point out that the North Pole is frequently covered by cloud and/or fog, and thus, from high-altitude jet planes and earth-orbiting satellites, any such phenomena as a large hole in the ice (if not in the underlying ocean) might be concealed from view for a great part of the time - although, given the presence of a bright central “sun” within the earth, it would probably not appear as a dark hole, but rather one which would emit light. (Perhaps some sort of a shining patch?)"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 During the daytime, one could well envisage that the external sunlight on the surrounding ice and the brightness of any inner luminary might well cancel each other out, especially since the sun’s rays reflect back quite brilliantly off the ice and water during the six-month Arctic summer, when the cloud-blanket would often be very patchy or even totally absent in some areas, from time to time. The Aurora? During the Arctic spring, and autumn, another phenomenon can often be observed at either pole; this is the auroral spectacle known as the “ Northern or Southern Lights ” - the Aurora Borealis and the Aurora Australis , respectively. Science has explained these vertical and beautiful curtain-like effects as being “caused by charged particles from the Sun striking rarefied gases high in the ionosphere and illuminating them” - in much the same way as an electrical charge illuminates the gas in a neon tube. However, if we think about an internal “ sun ” shining out through apertures in the Earth’s crust at the poles, might we not expect to observe something very similar on suitable, comparatively cloud-free nights - much like the effect of a battery of diffused searchlight- beams shining upwards from the icecap? Hmmm...Possibly! Another official explanation seems to be that the aurora are actually due to solar protons and electrons being drawn down toward the Earth’s magnetic poles and changing colour in relation to “the altitudes at which these collisions occur and on the wavelengths of the particles involved”. However, what if the situation were to be reversed , and the particles were being discharged upwards instead, by the “inner sun” (also perhaps a moderately radioactive body) through the polar apertures? Would we not expect to observe a very similar phenomenon? Again, possibly. Orthodox science would probably reject such an idea as totally preposterous - but is it such a ridiculous idea? Well, after much careful thought, I reluctantly have to admit that this idea is a bit of a stretch, and find that I have to agree with the scientific explanation that such auroral phenomena are most likely caused by cosmic and solar particles impinging upon, and being “braked” by the earth’s ionosphere causing photonic excitation which makes them fluoresce, and then possibly being subsequently burned up in the stratosphere. The discharge of great amounts of light upwards from “polar holes” in both the Arctic and the Antarctic would surely have been remarked upon by many polar aircraft pilots long before this! Thus the “upward-shining” theory clearly isn’t true. It’s also well worth remembering that the North Magnetic Pole is reckoned by geological science to be located in northern Canada, near Bathurst Island, at about latitude 78º North - which is some 750 kilometres south of the geographical North Pole, whilst the South Magnetic Pole is claimed to be off the coast of Wilkes Land, at latitude 64º South, which is over 2700 kilometres north of the geographic South Pole, and apparently, these magnetic poles are inclined to change their positions from year to year! One would surely expect the magnetic poles to be located upon a magnetic axis running through the north-south middle of the Earth , just as the true polar axis does - if the Earth truly is a gigantic spherical magnet - which it is generally assumed to be, and"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 which I always thought it was? However, I have since learned that the magnetosphere - which includes the Van Allen Belts - is really more in the shape of a very fat “doughnut” that girdles around the main bulk of the Earth, but leaves the polar regions more or less open to solar EMF fluxes. So why then do we find this strange anomaly, which indicates that the magnetic axis of the Earth does not run through its actual geocentric point, but instead runs out from 90ºN to 64ºS , and is thus angled away and aberrated from the north-south geographic polar axis by a whopping 36 degrees? I hasten to add that I myself can offer no concrete answer to this riddle, beyond the possibility of heavier concentrations of copper or iron ore being present in the Earth’s crust in these regions, and thus playing some major part in the mystery - but I’d be extremely interested to hear what the geological fraternity have to say about it! One could be forgiven for thinking that perhaps the magnetic and geographical poles might have no actual physical bearing upon each other at all! Whatever. I have yet to be convinced that the auroral phenomena actually does focus directly upon either magnetic pole - in which case, the true reason for the auroral effects may be related to the Earth’s own magnetosphere in the way I suggested earlier, and are simply related to solar and cosmic particles fluorescing in the ionosphere. I recall very clearly seeing the Aurora Borealis many times myself, as a boy in northern Britain, and it always appeared to be towards true north to me, and according to the Pole Star, Polaris . Otherwise I would have had to look somewhat away to one side, toward the north-north-west ! (I should perhaps add that I was a Boy Scout at the time, so I was possessed of an excellently-developed sense of direction!) Another possibility regarding this “ Earth Magnetism ” is that it may very well prove to be only a sub-surface, localised phenomenon which is confined entirely to the crustal lithosphere of the Earth - a phenomenon which may be applicable to the other terrestrial-type planets also - and that it may be of no particularly vital importance to our planet’s mechanics or “well-being” - apart from providing a useful “orienting-guide” for such migratory animals as caribou, musk-oxen and reindeer, as well as birds, which can all apparently utilise the natural earth-magnetic force via some sensory-faculty that we humans seem to have lost - or, in our case, via mechanisms like the magnetic-compass. However, some new information may yet be forthcoming about all of this, in due course, which might radically change current scientific thinking about the Earth’s so- called “Magnetic Poles”! A Late Update on Geo-Magnetism. Further to my comments above regarding “ Earth-Magnetism ”. I discovered a fairly recent report from the Geological Survey of Canada (within whose territory the North Magnetic Pole is located), which indicates that the Earth’s geomagnetism , as manifested in the Magnetic Poles, is now believed to be produced by electrical currents"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 that originate in the super-heated magma of the Earth’s (assumed) liquid outer core, or even in the large subterranean “seas or lakes” of molten magma - which I personally believe, would most likely be principally concentrated beneath the tectonic plate-edges, in between the deeper crustal layers . This flow of electrical currents is believed to be in a constant state of flux, and thus implies that the magnetic field which they produce is also continually changing. This phenomenon has been born out by a study of reported locations of the North Magnetic Pole harking back to 1829. Subsequent locations of the magnetic pole in 1831, 1903, 1945, 1962, 1973, 1984 and 1994, have shown that, over this period of 165 years, the North Magnetic Pole has “wandered” along a somewhat weaving path from the Boothia Peninsula (70ºN) to the Noice Peninsula (77ºN), some 1100 kilometres northward , roughly along the 105º line of longitude, and continues to move northwards, at a steadily accelerating rate, from an earlier 10 kilometres per year, now up to 15 kilometres per year! One might perhaps be forgiven for expecting that there would have also been a similar shifting of the South Magnetic Pole towards the south , but thus far, the opposite seems to be true, with a much slower migration of the South Magnetic Pole northward of about only 200 km along the 140º line of longitude! It’s precisely because of this constant shifting of the magnetic poles, and their consequential dubious value as precise charting-loci when using a magnetic-compass, that I am inclined to suspect that the estimated position of the true North Pole could easily have varied quite considerably since the time of the earlier explorers - a margin of error which might conceivably still persist in many currently-charted calculations of the Pole’s actual position! Latest News on IAOE Findings. Since writing the above “Latest Update”, I have learned some preliminary results of the 1996 International Arctic Ocean Expedition . No less than 29 sedimentary piston-cores were extracted from the Lomnosov Ridge between the latitudes of 85º N to 89º N, and, at the time of the new report in May, 1997, these were still being evaluated. A comprehensive computerised, visual geological-model of the Arctic Basin should soon be forthcoming of both the Lomonosov Ridge and the adjacent Arctic Basin. Nonetheless, this highly-detailed research seems to indicate that the possible existence of a hole in the seabed at the North Pole is now, (alas) rather less likely! Otherwise, despite any alleged official security “Cover-Up Conspiracies” , I feel sure such a discovery would have been “leaked” by now, and would long since have become headline-news in the world-media. However, after some deep consideration of this “Polar Hole” idea, I feel that whilst there might conceivably be an axial aperture at each pole, if we accept the notion that a “shell”planet’s centre of gravity would take the form of a spherical gravitational field around midway through the thickness of the Earth’s shell, then it is logically to be expected that over the millennia, the sediment from the polar oceans, or airborne dust and other general detritus, will have long ago filled up these holes, either partially or entirely."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 This is simply because the gravitational-zone halfway through the rocky shell, will have created an invisible “floor” of electromagnetic force which would prevent any of this sediment from falling through into the inner earth. This would also work the other way round, too, since exactly the same effect would apply within the planetary shell as outside it. Thus any holes would be filled in with firmly stable “plugs” on either side! Because of this simple “spherical centre of gravity” pheneomenon, it would be virtually impossible to detect the locations of any holes in the Earth’s shell, using any of the side-scan radar, laser, or other ground-penetrating scanning methods currently in use. Also, there is no logically sound reason to think that the axial poles would be the only locations for such apertures. They could have occurred in many other places around the globe for a variety of reasons, including extremely forceful penetration by bolides and meteors travelling at vast speeds. Even a gravitational force-field can’t stop everything! This leaves us with a lot more room for speculation as to where such concealed holes could lie hidden, and might even permit some speculation about notorious areas of sea and land where many inexplicable disappearances have occurred, expecially of large objects, such as ships and aircraft, or even ancient buildings and cities! Think of the Bermuda Triangle, and of cities like Atlantis! Nor is it entirely inconceivable that the “plugs” of such apertures might sometimes be rendered penetrable by powerful hi-tech means, such as a directional antigravity beam, operated from the interior. For those who believe in such things, these apertures could even be the means of ingress and egress for UFOs, to and from the interior We simply have no way of guessing at the degree of technology such an ancient and isolated race might have reached. All we can do, in our present ignorance of real clues regarding such fantastic matters, is speculate and theorise. However, let’s always bear in mind that even the wildest imaginative speculation and theorising has frequently led mankind to making astonishing scientific discoveries in the past, so we should continue to pursue this objective zealously and relentlessly. The only possible glimmer of hope for those who still seriously believe in the existence of open polar holes, twinkles dimly in the very faint chance of some kind of official and extremely-tight “Security Lid” having been clamped down upon any true findings of this nature by the US-led New World Order hierarchy; as would appear may have have happened in connection with several other important scientific discoveries which have attracted NWO covert attention, and have subsequently been suppressed and classified as Red Label “Top-Secret”! “Pro Bono Publici” - as the American CIA, FBI, and other Military Intelligence agencies would probably describe such clamp-downs! One really can’t ignore such undercover and clandestine activities as those which occasionally come to light, relating to hush-hush operations such as “ Roswell ”, “ Area 51 ”, Dulce, Cheyenne Mountain , and other alleged Government “Conspiracies, Cover- Ups, and Secret Facilities”, not just in the USA, but also in Europe, Russia, China, and even in Australia, too!

We have all seen those “Armageddon- type” movies (usually American) where some great and unstoppable catastrophe or other threatens to destroy the world, and the scientists and politicians struggle to keep the awful fact secret because of the predictable chaotic consequences such news would have upon the populace at large. Perhaps they are actually prophetic ! However, if concrete proof did (or does ) exist that there is another race within the Earth’s interior, possessed of technology far in advance of our own, and of which “surveillance-UFOs” are merely an example - how do you think the “ New World Order ” chieftains would react - particularly in view of their apparently obsessive penchant for secrecy and covert operations, agendas and activities? It is a sad commentary on the times in which we live today that the duly-elected politicians of most countries in the developed world, seem to feel it is their bounden duty to keep such vital matters covertly hidden from the public, rather than the opposite!

And I don’t need to remind my readers of what Power does to politicians! However, I fear I’m digressing! Getting back to Cases... I apologise if I’ve been forced a tad “Off Course” for a while by the Magnetic- Poles and Polar Holes issue, plus the IAOE seabed and seamount survey-results, but I am duty-bound to lay all the scientifically-proven facts before my readers (disappointing as they may, alas, very often be), as well as the much more exciting (but largely speculative) concepts of internal worlds and underground cities hidden deep within our planet. The Central Sun. Now I will return to our original “ Hollow Earth ” discussion, as promised, and, having spoken about the Polar Holes , let us now consider the Central Sun, which is thought by many alternative-science writers to illuminate the “interior earth” - or “ Agharta ” - as it is more widely referred to by some of the more enlightened souls who claim to be “In-The-Know” concerning such mysteries! As we have already noted in previous pages, the “washing-machine”- style centrifugal action of the Earth’s spin could have pushed all the heavier elements of cosmic matter it contained outward toward the solidifying crust of the forming planet. However, the lighter gaseous elements, such as hydrogen or helium, etcetera, would have remained floating in the vicinity of the axial-hub region (previously mentioned under the heading“By Way of Illustration” on an earlier page) close to the region of zero-gravity, and thus would not have been affected by the centrifuging-effect of Earth’s rotation. Thus, as a consequence (although I described the center then as being virtually empty and clear of cosmic material), such extremely light elements as neon, hydrogen, helium, and so forth, would most likely tend to aggregate together around the central"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 locus of the hollow region. There they would be held locked in place as a gaseous globe in a completely gravity-free zone by either the Earth’s own gravitational effect, or by seeking the furthest place away from it. The rest would, in all probability, be a miniature re-enactment of the Sun’s own birth from gaseous elements at the centre of a coalescing mass of cosmic dust and other space debris. The gases would then heat up under their own gravitational compression, thus causing atomic action and interaction, which would in turn, trigger off a sustained nuclear fusion reaction such as we see on an infinitely more gigantic scale, in our own Sun. In essence, for the purposes of this exercise, we can reasonably imagine that the Central Sun of the internal earth would function in very much the same way as the Sun itself, but on a greatly miniaturized scale, both in terms of heat, light, overall radioactivity and solar output. This point is an extremely important one to consider, with regard to its assumed proximity to the inner surface of the thick solid shell of the planet. The radiation of both heat and light from this tiny “sun” (especially ultraviolet, actinic, and nuclear) would have to be at a sufficiently low level as to permit lifeforms to develop and flourish in safety, without being subjected to harmful levels of atomic or ultraviolet radiation. (Although it mightn’t be entirely too unreasonable to hypothesize that the inner-earth inhabitants may perhaps, have developed a natural capacity to cope with higher levels of radiation than we can, here on the surface – though I seriously doubt it). However, since this whole concept is purely speculative (nobody in the 20th century having been there and come back to tell us about - with the possibly dubious exception of Rear-Admiral Richard Byrd , of course!) - we can only assume that any radiations from an interior “sun” would have to be perfectly within safe-limits for humans, since so many accounts claim that the occupants of the Hollow Earth originally fled there in order to avoid catastrophic events that affected the outer surface of the planet, including massive solar-flares – and, more than likely, periodically recurrent depletions of the ozone-layer! ( Quite frankly, I don’t subscribe to the alleged cause of the current ozone-layer holes being due to the over-use of aerosol-sprays. Surely we would need to pump out literally billions of litres of the actual undiluted fluorocarbon propellant to cause such enormously deleterious effects upon the ozone-layer?) ...Or Perhaps Another Light Source? But there is another possible means of illuminating the “Inner Earth” – or any of the suspected enormous caverns which are believed to exist deep in the Earth’s crust. This alternative is natural phospherescence which occurs in many places – even the sea ! I have seen for myself huge areas of this oceanic phosphorescence during the long sea- voyage from the UK to Australia on board an ocean-going liner. It’s astonishing how much one can see from the uppermost deck of a large passenger-ship, and particularly after dark, when I was able to see these eerie but quite brilliantly shining phenomena for myself. Someone told me that it was thought to be caused by a specific type of plankton which secreted this glowworm-like phosphoresence. However, I’ve since learned that the same effect is frequently"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 encountered in deep and otherwise pitch-dark cavern systems. Some of this is actually bioluminesence , which is a cold green-blue light found in many living organisms, including plankton, algae, and of course, fireflies and glow-worms which inhabit dark caves in vast numbers. In living creatures it is due to the secretion of a substance known as luciferin , but there are also other naturally occurring causes for luminescence in nature and physics. It is the nature of atoms to emit photons when they are excited, and we see this in many forms of natural radiation, including polar auroral light displays. Without going to any great lengths in explaining all this in a high-flown scientific way, let it suffice to say that, when such an emission of photons occurs immediately the atoms are excited by an energy-source, this is called fluorescence . But when this glow of light or illumination persists for some length of time following the cessation of the stimulation , it is then referred to as phosphorecence . An electric current passed through a gas is a common method of creating luminescence , and we see this all around us in fluorescent -light tubes. It is fast-moving electrons which produce the bright pictures on a television screen, when they strike the coating of phosphorus on the inner surface of the picture- tube. Thus it isn’t hard to imagine a scenario in which the very atoms of the atmosphere itself might be made to glow inside a hollow planet or a vast cavern, by means of some perfectly natural electrical-excitation phenomena which may occur there. The odd thing is that, despite the far-fetchedness of the whole concept, there are many aspects of it which make perfectly sound and logical scientific sense. Take for example, the circumstances which would follow a gigantic meteor strike in the Pacific Ocean - such as that which some claim to have destroyed the ancient civilization of Mu - or perhaps a sudden polar tilt of the Earth itself - both of which would send enormous tidal waves as high as mountains sweeping around the globe. Given the powerful centrifugal effect of Earth’s rotation, which we have considered earlier, and the fact that its effects would be virtually zero along the polar axis , it isn’t hard to figure out that these highly destructive tidal-wave effects would barely affect the polar regions - if at all . So even if there were polar openings into this Inner Earth, the tidal waves would not come crashing in through them. Nor would a polar-shift affect such an inner world to anything like the same extent as that on the exterior of the thick crust. Certainly there would be some sort of upheaval of oceanic water - but since the interior sea is claimed in some circles to be only one-fourth the size of the landmass (virtually the opposite of our external surface ratio of four-fifths ocean to one-fifth land) it would not create anything like the havoc that would be wreaked upon the outer surface. Incidentally, whilst on the subject of such catastrophes as 1000-foot tidal waves, or comet-strike dust-cloud “blackouts” lasting for decades, wouldn’t it be handy if the creatures of the outer crust, both men and animals, were freely able to seek refuge within the interior of the Earth! This is another possiblilty that I shall be examining more closely at a later stage of this hypothesis!"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 Admiral Byrd and “The Land Beyond the Poles”. Referring back briefly to this issue of polar openings , before I leave it for the present. It’s always possible that there might conceivably be a secret agenda of some sort (probably of the “Government Cover-up Conspiracy” kind) to keep their existence a carefully-guarded secret from the general population, whilst the government-agencies concerned acquire and exploit the advanced technology of any such advanced race as may dwell inside the Earth, for their own nefarious “Defense” purposes. If this were to turn out be the case, it might perhaps explain the curious “will’o’ the whisp” virtually-mythical log-diaries of Rear-Admiral Richard Byrd , in which he is reported to have claimed to have actually visited the land beyond the Poles (i.e; entered a polar hole into a green, warm land beyond) and been escorted in by “strange, disc- shaped type of aircraft ” bearing oddly-familiar “ swastika ” markings, to a landing-place, from whence he and his radio-man were escorted, via a “moving-platform without wheels” by several tall, blond men into a highly-futuristic and wonderful “Buck Rogers”- type city. There, as Byrd is alleged to have written, he met the seemingly ageless patriarchal Master of this inner world (apparently called “ Arianni ”.*) The Master’s bodyguard, whom Byrd is said to have claimed in his account, spoke English with a Nordic or German accent , then guided him and his colleague, Howie, into a guest apartment, where they were left alone for a short while. Then two of their “wondrous-looking hosts” allegedly came and escorted Byrd, on his own, down below ground in some kind of silently-operating open elevator - informing him that he was being taken to have an audience with the Master. The lift stopped and Byrd was now ushered into a great, palatial room, the luxuriant and wondrous beauty of which “defied his powers of description”. *(Note: The crafts’ insignia, the blond super-beings, and the very name of their inner world “Arianni,” leaves the reader in little doubt as to the “ Pure Germano-Nordic Aryan ” nature of this race! GF.) Here, as Byrd is alleged to have said, he was greeted warmly and entertained politely by this individual, who then conversed with him at length about all the pointless wars and other stupid destructive activities of the external race, and their foolish technological weaponry developments, like the atomic bomb, which he insisted would lead to ultimate disaster for humanity. “It was at that alarming time we sent our flying- machines, the “ flugelrads ”*, to your surface world to investigate what your race had done” the Master told Byrd. The “Master” then went on to add that he had already been in touch with the great leaders of the outer world to warn them of the terrible peril in which they were placing the Earth, but they appear to have chosen to ignore him. Byrd had been especially chosen to witness and attest to the fact that the inner world of the Arianni really did exist , and that their culture and science was many thousands of years beyond those of the surface-race. The Master was now giving Byrd this final warning message to deliver personally to his nation’s leaders, to alert them to this approaching disaster:- “Your race has now reached the point of no return, for there are those among you who would destroy your very world rather than relinquish their power...” he was told. “there is a great storm gathering in your world, a black fury that will not spend itself for many years.... the dark ages that will come now for your race will cover the Earth like a"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 pall, but I believe that some of your race will live through the storm. We see at a great distance a new world stirring from the ruins of your race....when that time arrives, we shall we shall come forward again to help you revive your culture and your race!” After this astounding audience, Byrd rejoined his equally-stunned companion, Howie , and they were taken back by the two blond supermen, via the moving-platform, to their plane, where they found its engines already idling. They boarded, and as soon as the cargo-door was closed, the aircraft was immediately lifted by an unseen force to an altitude of 2700 feet, where two of the strange, circular-winged aircraft guided them, with their plane’s controls mysteriously locked, on a return flight through the entrance- aperture by means of some unknown power or force-field, - “at a very rapid rate ”, as Byrd allegedly wrote . Once outside, the “flugelrads” took their leave, with this final parting message over the plane’s radio: “We are leaving you now, Admiral, your controls are free. Auf Wiedersehen !” From there onward, Byrd and his companion, the radio- man, Howie, (of whom, alas, we find no further mention in Byrd’s mysterious diaries), flew back without incident over Arctic snow and ice to their base-camp at the edge of the north polar icecap. On March 11th, 1947, Byrd attended a staff meeting at the Pentagon, where he is said to have stated in full the whole of his amazing discovery and experience. Everything was duly recorded and the President was advised. Byrd was then detained for several hours, and was subsequently interviewed very closely by Top Security officers and physically checked over by a Government medical team. Following this drawn-out ordeal, he found himself placed under strict control by the National Security Provisions of the USA, and was ordered, rather incredibly, to “ remain silent in regard to all that I had learned, on the behalf of Humanity ” ! The reports allege that he was strongly reminded that he was a military man and that he must obey orders. According to all available accounts, Byrd faithfully concealed his discovery for nine long years until December, 1956, when ill-health finally overtook him, and he resolved to reveal his long-kept secret, so securely hidden away in his private diaries and log-book. During the intervening years, since his return from the inner-earth, he had continued to conduct and supervise aerial polar-surveys over both the Arctic and the Antarctic, despite the staggering secret knowledge that he nursed in his heart. We don’t know if he ever re-discovered the entrance to the inner world, since he never mentioned it again. But he was showered with honours and acclaim by a grateful nation for his many courageous known flights of exploration. Byrd’s last polar flight - this time over the Antarctic - was in January, 1956, when he had been appointed senior US Government Officer in Charge of US Antarctic Affairs. He died early in March, 1957, and was buried with full military honours in Arlington Military Cemetery. The Big Question! I suppose that what we have to ask ourselves is this. Could an eminently sound and rational military officer of such high standing in US official circles - including in the White House itself - as well as in the hearts of the American people - really have simply dreamt up or fabricated such an amazingly incredible scenario as this? Would he"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 really have risked writing it down, in such minute detail, in his carefully-noted secret diary, even if he had invented it all? And, if it was all merely the “fantasy of a twisted mind” , as some sceptics have remarked, what possible personal gain or kudos could he have hoped to achieve from it, in view of the fact that he was already revered and venerated, almost as a god-like hero , by the President and the population of his own country? Alas, Rear - Admiral Richard E. Byrd has taken that particular secret - if secret there still was - to his grave with him - as have those who were his Pentagon superiors and interviewers back in 1947. All we have today are his reported “ secret diaries ”, allegedly discovered after his death, to offer in evidence - as well as thousands upon thousands of alleged “sightings” of the mysterious “ Flugelrads ”* (or UFOs) described therein! * (“Radial-Flyers or Wheel-Wings” in English. GF) Thus ends the enigmatic and challenging mystery of Byrd’s discovery of what he himself described as “The Land Beyond the Poles” . Or does it? To quote Byrd’s own words: “Just as the long night of the Arctic ends, the brilliant sunshine of Truth shall come forth again, and those who are of Darkness shall fall in its Light ”. However, despite all this touching rhetoric and technical detail, one feels inclined to wonder whether all those “ secret-diary entries ” were, in actual fact, really penned by Richard E. Byrd, or whether they are all part of a gigantic hoax, perpetrated merely to sell quasi- scientific books? I must confess that, after reading a lot of what has been written about the Hollow Earth, I find it would be so very easy to be totally sceptical of the whole idea, and of the feasible-sounding “science” in which it seems to be cleverly enveloped. Arriving at a Conclusion? My first general feeling, after initially looking into the“Hollow Earth” idea was that it could very possibly be the elaborate invention of several, if not many, clever minds, triggered off by the brilliant tales penned by such ingenious science-fiction writers as Jules Verne, Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Thus, it might have proved, for many creative thinkers, to be far too exciting and enticing an hypothesis to be simply left lying around without being pseudo-scientifically exploited, even if only in the high-flown Arthur C. Clarkean realms of super-science-fiction, or, at best, perhaps taken up and elaborated upon as an intriguing and challenging exercise in abstract philosophy by some bored intellectual. Perhaps the “New Age” thinkers are right, in that such seeming “sci-fi fantasies” (as this may even yet turn out to be), are often worth testing out by proper scientific methods. We already owe so many true-life major scientific advances in all fields of cosmic and technological discovery and invention to the initial vivid imaginations of inspired science-fiction visionaries like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke! Sober Afterthoughts... But still, however much one tries to airily dismiss the whole idea as pure nonsense, there is a certain inescapable “ something ” in all of this “Hollow Earth” concept that draws otherwise perfectly rational “feet-on-the-ground” scientific thinkers to"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 it like iron-filings to a magnet. I, for one, feel inexplicably loathe to simply walk away from it all and return to more pragmatic mental pursuits. No matter how one tries to rationalize it away with sound scientific argument, the whole idea lingers on in the back of one’s consciousness as a gigantic shadowy mystery, still worthy of yet further consideration and investigation! My own “gut-feeling” today, after very carefully considering all the clues and inferred evidence is that all planets and stars, including the Earth, are hollow. Not only that, but I also tend toward the concept that our human race might perhaps have actually originated there! I do not make this statement lightly, or off the top of my head. Such an origin for our particular species would account for our apparently total lack of any natural protection from the rigours of the external Earth, both as it is today, and even more so, as it probably was a couple of hundred thousand years ago, when the solar radiation was far more powerful, and would have burned naked human skin quite mercilessly, not to mention its effect upon our eyes. One has only to consider that humanity is probably the only species on the face of our planet which has had to resort to artificial protection for our tender skin, not only from the UV radiation of the sun, but from all the elements as well - extremes of cold and heat, windburn, sand-blasting, general cuts and tears from thorny trees and sharp rocks, etcetera. Most of the animals of the world have been naturally protected from such hazards by thick pelts of fur, thick scaly skins or hard, leathery carapaces, as well as possessing eyes capable of seeing in the dark. So why hasn’t Man? True, some men have hirsute bodies and can grow thick beards and long head- hair, but they are in the minority. Most men in the world, especially Negroes and Asiatics, tend to be virtually free of body-hair by comparison. And all of the women are generally smooth-skinned. (Head-hair, however, would be an essential protective-cover for cave-dwellers - against cracking their skulls upon tunnel roofs and other overhead projections, like stalactites!) There has no doubt been a lot of adaptation, especially in peoples from cold climates, to compensate for this lack, principally in the men, since women, both prehistorically and to this day, have generally been largely confined to the interiors of caves, huts or houses by their natural roles as mothers and home-makers. The men in ancient times, were the hunters and providers of sustenance, as well as the warrior-guardians of women and children. Thus, because of this role, they had to adapt, as well as they could, to the direct rigours of the outdoor world, by developing what little protection they had in terms of beards and head and body-hair. Where this was still not enough, they soon learned to wrap themselves in the pelts of the animals they hunted and killed. In hot sunny climates, where the warmth of animal furs would have made life intolerable, humans had to adapt to some extent, by secreting extra melanin pigmentation to protect their naked skins from the Sun’s UV radiation – often to the saturation point of becoming indigo-black. However, despite all of this adaptation and artificial protection, we humans are still naked and vulnerable creatures, struggling to survive in our fabricated clothing and"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 sunglasses and hiding from the sun and elements as much as possible inside our air- conditioned, artificially-constructed “cave-houses”. It should, therefore, be patently obvious that we are a species battling to survive in an alien environment. Even though its elements, such as air, water, earth and even fire, are natural to us, this cannot be the original environment of our ancient progenitors. We are creatures of the shadows and the half-light, not of the open plains or the blazing sunshine. Nor are we truly safe in forest or jungle, since our skins are not thick enough to withstand the constant scratches and rips of sharp thorns and rough branches, or contact with poisonous plant-leaves – not to mention all the dangerous lurking denizens of the jungle! If we were, we would possess thick pelts or tough leathery hides, as well as effective natural weapons of defence, such as powerful claws and fangs - as well as powerful night-vision! Regardless of all the claims of anthropologists that we have evolved into a tool and weapon-making species, and have thus lost all need for such natural defences, so that these have now atrophied completely, I remain totally unconvinced. The domestic dog, which was once a ferocious wolfish or dingo-like carnivore and needed these attributes to stay alive, has now been domesticated by Man for more than a hundred thousand years – or even ten times that – yet it still possesses all of its original attack and defence- equipment, even down to the bone-crunching molars and premolars! Surely, one would have expected the dog – or any of the domesticated animals – to have at least begun to shed some of this unnecessary ancient “survival-equipment” , after so many thousands of generations in Man’s company and care? But this is simply not the case. All dogs can become ferocious, ravening beasts in the twinkling of an eye, should the occasion demand, and can return to their original feral condition and appearance within just a couple of generations, if released or dumped into the wild. This says little for Darwin’s “Evolutionary Theory” , since even genetic modification, artificial cross- breeding, and behavioural conditioning should neverthless bring about some measurable degree of “evolution” , if Darwin’s theory really works. Quite evidently, it doesn’t - as has been proved more than adequately by many other modern researchers, far better educated and learned in such matters than I. Thus I completely reject the concept that humans have evolved from some lower mammalian order, such as the progenitor of the great apes. I would rather champion Creationism - except that those of my readers who are of an atheistic inclination might be put off by such a theistic belief – so I’ll simply leave it lie as a plain repudiation of Darwinian evolution as a genuinely viable theory. Instead, I put forward for the reader’s consideration, the suggestion that, in view of all the contraindications for Man having evolved or developed upon the open surface of this planet, that his origins must lie elsewhere, in one of two possible locations:- 1) Within the gloomy caverns and layrinthine tunnels of the earth’s crust – or even from deep inside the actual hollow centre of the Earth itself – or:"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 2) Upon some extraterrestrial home-world, preferably within our Solar System than that of some other far-away star. (Perhaps Mars - or its parent planet, now long defunct - might qualify, since neither Mercury or Venus are, in my opinion, remotely capable of sustaining life as we understand it, and since the great gas-giants seem equally untenable to Earthly types of lifeforms, as also do their satellites – at least, as far as we know!) Much as I would love to develop this “We’re From Elsewhere” concept here and now, and speculate upon which option is the more tenable, I feel I must resist the urge, and stay with the basic question of “Is Our Earth Really Hollow?” However, I shall pursue it much more vigorously in another closely-related hypothesis concerning Mars . Back To the Main Question... I guess I shall now have to continue on with my investigations and theorizing upon the possibility - however unlikely - of there actually being another realm hidden deep inside our earth. There are so many facets to the idea, that it holds one in its thrall like a spinning golden trinket in the hands of a hypnotist. One feels totally compelled to follow it through to the end, wherever it may lead! I suspect that there’s more than a dash of the “ Indiana Jones ” mentality inside the minds of most imaginative thinkers. And what greater adventure can our present well-trodden and thoroughly known surface world offer us now - having yielded up so many of its jealously guarded but superficial secrets to those earlier intrepid explorers - than such a vast and last greatest secret of all; that there is another totally new and wonderous living world inside our own! Further Issues and Revisions... Below, I have taken the liberty of included part of a letter I wrote some time ago to an old friend overseas, which I believe is worth repeating here, since it both qualifies and supports many of the points raised above, as well as incorporating other associated current scientific issues. I hope that some of my readers will find it both entertaining and edifying! It goes like this..... A Speculative Discourse on Hollow Planet Formation abstracted from a long letter written by Gerry Forster to a friend overseas “Dear D...., ...I’m still enjoying my studies on the Internet, by the way, and I recently joined a couple of discussion-egroups on the Net, who were talking about the possibility of the Earth actually being hollow inside (rather similar to a tennis-ball , with the centre of gravity actually being in the form of a sphere and lying midway through the thickness of the “tennis-ball” Earth’s crust, which they claim to be around 600-800 miles thick!) “I know that it may all sound a bit far-fetched to you, but the fact is that nobody - not even the world’s greatest geologist - can possibly know if the Earth is actually solid or not! Nor can they deny that it could be hollow ! The deepest borehole that has yet"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 been drilled is in South America, and they’re currently down to around 17.5 kilometres deep at the time of writing – and still drilling! The last I heard was that they’d struck a thick layer of basalt, which came as a totally surprise, as they’d been expecting to tap into the upper semi-molten magma layer several kilometres earlier. Also the temperature down the bore has long since stopped rising, and has instead begun to fall again! So clearly, something is radically wrong with current geological textbook knowledge. “This “Hollow Earth” concept would certainly help to clear up a great many anomalies regarding gravitation, and especially in connection with the newly-discovered fact that the Earth as a globe has actually been expanding since Jurassic (Dinosaur) times - 260,000,000 years ago! This excitingly new “Expanding Earth” geology supports the continental-drift theory extremely well, and with it, one can now demonstrate that all the continents once fitted together perfectly and entirely covered an Earth only one-third the size that we see it today. Tectonic plates are the culprits, since, where their rough edges meet and grate together, they cause the thrusting apart of the world’s continental plates by extruding molten lava – which is produced either from substrata of underlying foundational rock, melted by the heat of constant unimaginable friction, or directly from the mantle of semimolten matter – and which has emerged and solidified continuously along and between the plate-edges for hundreds of millions of years. “Thus, by the simple continuous accretion of solidified lava upon their edges, the plates carrying their respective continents have been slowly thrust further and further apart. It also explains how identical species of dinosaurs were able to spread out on to different continents all over the globe - especially since so many of them were so large and enormously heavy and cumbersome that they couldn’t possibly swim. If this great new “Expanding Earth” concept is correct, then 260 million years ago the gigantic dinosaurs would have simply been able to amble across from one future continent to another upon dry land, because Africa, Europe and South America would then have been snugly nestled in close conjunction against each other! “It has been discovered that the Atlantic Ocean is currently widening at the rate of some 2 –3 centimetres a year – thus pushing the Americas ever further away from Africa and Europe! It might not sound like much , but one has only to do the necessary math calculation (as I did) to discover that this amounts to around an average distance of 4,500 kilometres over the past 260 million years - which is what we find to be the current actual average width of the Atlantic Ocean! The “ engine ” that is providing all this thrust is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which is known to be an 8,000 mile-long volcanic rift in the ocean floor, and which is still constantly extruding new molten lava to this very day! The globe of the Earth’s crust is criss-crossed by such plate-rifts, so all of the continents are being pushed apart from each other – with the obvious result that the Earth itself has to be steadily expanding in size !"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 “The old concept of the “subduction” of plate-edges down beneath each other into the inner molten magma, is no longer a puzzle, since it simply doesn’t happen ! From what I can discover and deduce, there’s really no need to assume that the tectonic plates which carry the continents around are floating upon a sea of molten magma, at all. These lava catchments may simply occur in deep subterranean “reservoirs” or “lakes” here and there, principally beneath the plate-boundaries, where most of the tectonic activity is largely concentrated. “But here’s the real “kicker” ! The Earth could only have expanded like this if it was hollow like a tennis-ball ! Despite their apparent solidity and hardness (to us , at any rate), the rocks, on a global scale, are surprisingly plastic and bendable. Interesting notion to contemplate, isn’t it! Thus, it logically follows that, if the Earth is a hollow spheroid, then so also must all the other planets be! In fact, if you think about this a little more carefully, the hollow sphere is extremely common in nature and in physics right across the universe. Consider the simple bubble , then think about ball-lightning . “It isn’t hard to envisage that most so-called “solid” particles, photons and electrons, and even atoms themselves, which carry electrical charges are merely miniature“ bubbles of energy ”. From there it’s an easy mental step to scale the whole thing up to something of star proportions, and onward further still to galactic and even universal dimensions! “If you then think of the Earth as being at its outset a sort of “ balloon ” of electrical energy, which gradually (due to natural electromagnetism or static electricity), became coated with fine particles of cosmic dust. This continued to build up to such an extent that eventually it had formed into a solid thick spherical shell of rocky matter. Then, because of the accreted mass of matter, the original EMF sphere became one of gravitation - you can then see that there is a far simpler way in which the solar system, or even the entire universe , became formed! I recall as a youngster having the expansion of the universe explained to me, with my teacher using this imaginary, “self-inflating invisible balloon” concept, upon which all the nebulae and galaxies were represented by tiny dabs of paint equidistantly marked upon the invisible balloon’s skin. I was able to grasp his meaning instantly, and to comprehend why all the nebulae are seen by astronomers to be fleeing away, not only from a common centre of origin, but also from each other! The old “ Red Shift ” effect! “As far as the solar system is concerned. I used to think the sun was a spinning ball of conglomerated cosmic matter or space-dust, which trailed a wide wheel-like disc of dusty matter around its equator like a ballet dancer’s swirling skirt, and that the planets were formed out of eddying clumps of clotting dust within this rotating “skirt”. But now I’m tempted to believe completely that the planets could possibly all have been free-travelling spheres or balls of energy that were “captured” by the sun’s rotating gravitational field, and that they are now held at their orbital distances simply by the conflict of opposing electromagnetism between themselves and the Sun, dependent upon how strong their own individual EMF fields are."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 “If it were simply a combination of gravity and centrifugal force alone which held us in orbit around the Sun, one or the other would surely have won out eventually, since our Sun is far from being gravitationally or electromagnetically stable, and its power- output waxes and wanes quite fitfully according to the varying phenomena of “sunspot”- EMF activity (vast magnetic storms and vortices) which flare up at spasmodic intervals. “Ergo, the orbits of the planets could be extremely erratic and our orbital distance from the Sun could vary beyond highly lethal parameters for all life upon them, particularly Earth, where a matter of 20-30 ° C variation could either freeze or scorch all life from the surface almost instantaneously. I believe that electromagnetic-force is inextricably intertwined with what we call “ gravitation ”, so such violent fluctuations of the Sun’s EMF should, in the ordinary course of events, have long since either drawn our planet into itself during an upsurgence of its EMF power. Or, alternatively, during a waning of such solar EMF power, the Earth’s orbital centrifugal force could well have carried it free upon a tangent, out of the Sun’s range of influence! “Therefore, I can only conclude that my earlier premise of opposing EMF fields must be a correct one, and that Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity operates exactly as he predicted it would. (You can check out his theory for yourself – if you’re game!) “Incidentally, before I leave this subject of uttermost “ Gravity ”, I ought to point out that, if the Earth were a huge “rock-coated energy-bubble” with a carapace or shell of around 600-800 miles thick, the centre of gravity would not be a focal point located at the centre of the globe. It would much more likely prove to be a completely spherical “focus” , probably located around the midway-point through the crustal coating, since that is where the hollow earth’s mass (and therefore its gravitational attraction) would be at its strongest, and from which, if we continued onward inside the hollow earth, the gravity would grow steadily weaker again until we reached the central locus of the globe, at which point it would effectively be cancelled out by conflicting weak gravitational “pulls” from every direction. I would expect this to be more or less a gravity-free zone. “Soft Particle” and “Non-Gravitational Push” Concepts. “I simply can’t bring myself to subscribe to any of the complicated alternatives to mass-based gravity – such as Euler’s Impulsation Theory of invisible etheric particle- pressure exerting an unseen “ pushing ” effect which more or less pins us, and all other massy objects, down upon the Earth - or Cater’s Soft-Particle Physics , which imply a very similar effect. I simply do not believe it is necessary to step outside currently- accepted and proven physical laws to demonstrate why the Earth, its sister-planets, and most celestial bodies could be hollow. “Whilst I am quite happy to accept the concept of a universal “ ether ” which acts as a non-intervening carrier for all forms of radiant energy, I cannot contemplate such an unseen and insubstantial impulsation as Euler proposes as being any alternative to straightforward, plain and honest Newtonian gravitation, which has served us well"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 enough in all of our space-endeavours thus far – and should also serve equally well in proving the Hollow Planet theory! The familiar, widely-accepted laws of nature and physics tend to support the “Occam’s Razor” view: “The Simplest Answer is Generally the Right One” - so why try to complicate it further? “Incidentally, before I leave this proposition of planetary globes being hollow shells, let me mention the curious anomaly of the Asteroid Belt , which circles between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Many physicists and astronomers have tried to determine the origin of these orbiting rock fragments – which to my mind, at any rate, can have only come from the explosive shattering of a planet which once occupied that same orbit. But sadly, most astronomers seem to agree that this cannot be the case, because all the fragments added together would not make up a planet even as small as our Moon! They tend to believe, as I do myself, that any planet located in that orbit must have been quite a sizeable one - certainly the largest of all the terrestrial planets - even if only to comply with the basic requirements of Bode’s Law ! Dr. Tom Van Flandern, astrophysics-doyen (in my opinion) of the Internet, evidently shares this same view. “However, if that planet, instead of being a solid ball of rock, had actually been a spherical rocky shell – as I’ve suggested that all the remaining terrestrial planets are - then the rocky matter of which it was originally comprised may pretty well be accounted for by the remaining asteroid fragments - even though quite a number of those fragments may have been flung far out into space by the explosion, to return periodically on very long orbits as meteors and meteorites. I feel that, if one were only able to retrieve all the asteroids and meteorites, and the debris dumped upon Mars, one could virtually reassemble the original fragments and matter into a semi-giant terrestrial shell-planet , of which the planet Mars may well have been a major moon. Our own familiar Moon might conceivably also have been one of this super-terrestrial planet’s satellites, as might several of those which now circle Jupiter and Neptune. “As to the rotation of stars or planetary bodies. This appears to be a universal law which mysteriously comes into play as a celestial body accretes matter to a certain critical mass and reaches a corresponding compressive heat from the increasing friction between and within the accreted particles of its shell. You will never get an adequate explanation for the causes of rotation, spin or revolution from any orthodox scientist, because they simply don’t have any to offer! Nebulae, galaxies and solar systems all rotate about central hubs, and all stars and planets revolve about their individual axial centres. It seems to be simply an immutable law of the universe, which starts with the humble atom, and ends with the universe itself, that all such bodies of matter must rotate and orbit. “I myself can only describe this phenomenon as a natural consequence of the acquisition of mass and heat to a certain critical degree. I believe it all comes down to simple kinetic energy, which is produced by chemical reactions releasing infinitesimal electrical charges (photons) from atoms. Although orthodox physicists may dispute this, I believe that all atomic nuclei carry electrical charges within electrostatic dipoles, and thus possess their own tiny magnetic fields, no matter how miniscule these may be. Their"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 accompanying electrons are similarly equipped with electrostatically-charged dipoles, both negative and positive. Therefore, the repulsion and attraction between adjacent atoms (including their orbiting “satellite” electrons), must cause some form of general electromagnetic agitation which produces a basic EMF tumbling or spinning motion through their dipoles – a fundamental rotation , if you like! “If one considers the cumulative effect of trillions upon trillions of such magnetically-charged atoms in mass-motion, the prime cause of such a generalised overall motion in large masses of matter becomes clear. It can only be initiated by the generation of a collective electromagnectic field after a certain large amount of kinetic energy has been attained through the combination of mass and heat. Let us bear it firmly in mind that, if even the tiniest molecule, particle, atom, or even electron, already inherently possesses such a potential for agitation or motion, then it logically follows that a vast aggregation of such self-motivated, negatively-and positively-charged particles will further combine their effects into an infinitely greater rotary motion of the whole body or mass of aggregated particles. Whilst as a mere amateur, I can’t be entirely certain about all of this, I suspect that atomic reactions are produced in a somewhat similar sort of manner, after a certain “critical mass” of radioactive matter has been brought together. “But, again, no atomic scientist seems to be able to clearly explain just why a critical mass should combust, explode, or otherwise react with such instant spontaneity. From what I’ve read on the subject, they only discovered that there was such a thing as a “critical mass” by simple trial and error – more often the latter , alas! (I believe it’s loftily called “Experimentation” . ) “I guess that this is just another of those uncanny things which makes us poor fumbling mortals look marvellingly towards that Higher Inventive Authority who laid down so many other similarly astonishingly simple Universal Rules (which we so ponderously and grandly refer to as the “ Laws of Nature and Physics ”), when He designed this whole original “Box of Tricks” which we call the Universe! “I think I’ll leave it at that for now, old son, and get down to a bit more hard thinking! One doesn’t really require a Doctorate in Mathematics or to be a whizz-kid genius in Applied Celestial Physics to find sensible answers to these sorts of conundrums. Remember that it was through the actions of his tremendously-gifted (even if fictitious) detective, Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , who was a total duffer at maths, showed us that his own common-sense, down-to-earth logic and deductive reasoning- powers were flawless. It took a real live genius to invent an imaginary one of Sherlock Holmes’ astounding calibre! “It’s also worth noting, en passant, that Sherlock Holmes was probably one of the greatest exponents of lateral-thinking ; an ability which is a wonderful asset to any armchair-philosoper or amateur scientific theorist. By the way. The dictionary definition of “ Science ” is simply stated as follows: “The study of the nature and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 behaviour of the physical universe, based on observation, experiment, and measurement.” Then it goes on to say: “Systematic and formulated knowledge ; the pursuit or principles of this.” Alas ! I’m no good at either of these disciplines - systems or formulae ! But then again, if we delve a little deeper, we discover that the real answer lies in the etymology of the Latin word “ Scientia ”, that plainly and simply means “ Knowledge ” – which is something that we can all freely acquire if we set our minds to it! “ The foregoing rambling diatribe is probably more than a trifle rough-hewn and disconnected. I tend to write on the run! But maybe a better disciplined mind than mine might be able to glean something worthwhile out of it all! Anyhow, I’ll catch up with you later on, after I’ve done a bit more mental digging and delving in the cerebral back- garden! I’ll let you know what else I’ve turned up, next time I write! As always, your good friend,    Gerry Forster  Gerry Forster. 2000 And there the abstraction ends, but my readers might find the thoughts and conclusions aired therein of some use in extending their own cogitations upon the subject-matter of this paper. Now I will move on to some of the other possible aspects of whatever curious realm may lie concealed inside the earth beneath our feet! The Second Inner Earth. As I mentioned at the outset, there are three possible “inner worlds” to contemplate, when we speak of a Hollow or Inner Earth. We have already taken a cursory look at the classic prime example, about which so much has been written and fantasized over during the past two centuries. However, there still remain two other possibilities to consider. The second inner world is the terrifying, gloomy, redly-glowing hellish realm of devils and demons, and other fearsome creatures which love the darkness. It is the lurking-place of the bogeys and ghosts of our infantile nightmares, and the grisly ghouls, trolls, goblins, dwarfs and dragons that haunted our later childhood. This is the dreaded Stygian habitation of those horrific beasts and monsters which still fill the of annals of ancient, classic legend - the vampires, zombies and undead corpses from Gothic tales of terror. (Speaking of vampires , by the way, it’s interesting to note that they are said to shun the UV-laden sunlight, are of pallid white skin colour, and subsist directly upon human and animal blood. These same characteristics appear to be shared by the so-called alien “Greys”, who also appear to venture forth only at night, who are renowned for their abduction and “experimentation” upon humans and large animals - from whom they remove organs and body fluids - and, according to purported autopsy-reports, possess only the most rudimentary of digestive systems - which would be ideally compatible with a diet of such direct nutritional value as fresh blood ! Could there be some relationship?) However, according to some of the myriad stories about this uncanny underworld , all is not entirely gloom and doom. It is also the daytime hiding-place of fairies, pixies and elves; the enchanted domain of wizards and witches and their enslaved princesses"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 and changeling frog-princes. It is also the time-honoured shadowy resting-place where Britain’s once and future King Arthur and his valiant, virtuous knights, slumber together with their great snow-white chargers, awaiting Merlin’s great Clarion Call to Arms to join in the final battle of Armageddon! The Awsome Underworld. The eerie subterranean world underneath our feet, of which we first learned in our childhood; a weird and frightening place of labyrinthine tunnels, caverns and chasms, which are the alleged home of goblins, dwarfs and trolls, of demons, devils and other fearsome creatures of the darkness, has long been greatly feared by most of mankind. Yet, despite our inherent dread of deep, dark underground places, they have always held a strange fascination for mankind, and have ever been a continuing source of great wonder, excitement and interest to us. Perhaps there may be some atavistic racial memory within us all, of such places having once provided our first surface ancestors with the only really safe and secure shelter from a violent and vicious world of giant carnivores, volcanic and tectonic upheavals, and appalling storms, despite the ferocious cave-bears and mountain-lions (aye, and even dragons!) with which they shared such fearsome and dangerous underground lodgings. Today, daring young adventurers boldly go down such awsome chasms and tunnels, at great risk of life and limb, purely in the name of spelaeology , both as a science and a sport, since it has rapidly become very popular among fit young men and women over the past fifty years or so. “ Spelunkers ”, as they are called, were once fairly thin on the ground – or rather under it - and many, alas, remained under it, too, fifty or sixty years back, when proper caving equipment was either non-existent or, at best, extremely flimsy and clumsy. However, since the advent of suitable and lightweight safety-headgear, easily portable powerful electric lights and equipment, body-harness and virtually unbreakable nylon ropes, the sport has taken off in quite a big way, and many previously quite inacessible caves and tunnel-systems have now surrendered their long-guarded secrets to these daring latter-day “Cave-Men and Cave-Women”. They have brought back many thousands of excellent colour-photographs of the often incredibly lovely and awsome chambers and vaults which they entered underground, their high ceilings often filled with amazing hanging stalactites and equally astonishing stalagmites rising up to meet them. Nature’s Hidden Sculpture Galleries... Some of these pieces of Nature’s artistry are quite spectacular, as also are some of the wonderfully delicate traceries of varicoloured limestone, which adorn the caverns. One really has to marvel at the handiwork that has been so intricately and gloriously moulded and woven, entirely by the relentless drip-dropping of tiny droplets of calcite- laden water, filtering down through the porous limestone for long millennia of time! I myself as a boy was a great fan of Norbert Casteret , a long-departed French speleologist, who wrote a series of excellent books about his amazing adventures and discoveries in the deep caverns and gulfs of the Pyranees and other mountainous regions"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 of France. I collected several of his fascinating books, profuse with old flash-photos, and I grew up with this awareness of that terribly dangerous yet wonderously-sculpted subterrannean world beneath our feet. Casteret’s almost poetical descriptions of his finds really fired my imagination with marvellous visions of the incredible fragile natural beauty which he was privileged to be the first to discover. If this is (as I for one, most truly believe) God’s marvellous craftsmanship, one wonders why He has allowed it to grow and blossom forth unseen for so long! Then, one realises that Man , by and large, is a terribly destructive creature, who loves nothing better than to tear down and destroy his natural surroundings, rather than leave them to thrive in their original natural beauty. If it were not so, we would have no need for National Parks, National Trusts, or Preservation Orders to save our surroundings from being vandalised or falling victim to commercial devastation. However, this is not the proper forum for airing such environmental preservation sentiments, no matter how heartfelt, even though my reader may fully endorse my views, so I must proceed apace with my main discourse. The Hollowness of The Earth’s Crust. One of the major outcomes of all this spelaeological interest in the labyrinthine underworld has been the amazing revelation of how much the apparently solid ground beneath us is literally honeycombed with caverns, tunnels, and gargantuan shafts and grottos like some gigantic Swiss cheese! No wonder our far-distant forefathers believed that it was a veritable gloomy world of darkness and death, filled with all kinds of lurking, frightful creatures! However, one might expect that ancient concept to have died the death in today’s enlightened world, where there is hardly a corner which has not been explored by men and illuminated by his electric lighting. But this apparently, is not the case at all! If we are to believe all the plethora of disturbing reports which today flood the Internet - primarily from American sources - the ancient and fearsome reptilian hominid inhabitants of that realm of darkness have returned in strength to threaten modern man in his underground mining activities, his subterranean geological explorations, and his construction of deep underground military facilities and radiation-proof shelters for the political, financial and military élite. We’re constantly reading of reported encounters with these demonic denizens of the abyss, and their threatening activities toward those who dare to poach upon their underground preserves - not to mention their alleged horrific predilection for human flesh and blood! It’s from these alleged encounters that a whole new mythos appears to have sprung up, particularly in the USA (though not exclusively so), positing that these vile creatures – and their “Gray” helpers, who are humanoid in form – are in fact aliens from outer space , who have set up secret hive-like subterranean headquarters, in preparation for a massive world-wide take-over of the surface of this planet!"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 “Non Alienus, Sed Terrestris!” My own personal view of all this is that, whilst most of it is probably pure hype and sensationalism – not unmixed with a liberal measure of hysteria on the part of those who believe themselves to be under threat – there must be some basis for such a notion, just as all world-mythology has a certain measure of foundation in factual events and occurrences in the ancient past. However, given the extremely long history of encounters with such subterranean dwellers in the myths and legends of most countries in the world, I feel strongly inclined to discount the idea of them being “aliens from some other star-system”. If such humanoid subterrannean races do indeed exist at all, then they are far more likely to be as anciently native to Planet Earth as are we ourselves – and perhaps even more so! In such an event, does it not seem far more likely that they have been shunning the surface-dwellers for millennia, and have only lately come out of hiding to confront the threat of modern man’s high-handed technological intrusions into their territory? But let us now pass on to the third alternative inner world. The Third Inner Earth Concept. The third and final Inner-World scenario, however, is really a comparatively old but recently-revisited concept, in which all of our present comprehensions of the Earth and the universe are turned completely and literally inside out. Yet it is still a virtual Inner Earth , which, if we were not made aware of it, would never affect our normal daily lives or our global perceptions in the slightest degree! This one is by far the most controversial notion of the three, since it implies that we are actually already residing (right at this very moment!) upon the inner surface of a hollow sphere! This particularly “far-out” concept is known as the Celestro-Centric model, and it is part of a universal “ Cellular Cosmogeny ” in which Heaven and Earth are both considered to be parts of a single hugely gigantic cell-like organism. One of the principal promulgators of this seemingly curious notion was an American named Cyrus Teed , and he developed the concept principally for the satisfaction of his own personal religious beliefs, and strangely, they appear to fit perfectly within God’s framework of Creative order, exactly as set out in the first chapter of the Bible Book of Genesis! Naturally, one would expect that Teed would have factored all the events of the six creative days into his theory, but what is particularly astonishing about the whole concept as he described it, is that, even with all the enormous modern knowledge of physics that they now have available to utterly destroy Teed’s theory, our modern physicists and other scientists simply cannot scientifically disprove the theory – no matter how hard they might try! It has been described as “A Maddening Theory That Can’t Be Disproved” , and this is no idle statement on their part. Needless to say, Teed’s concept of cosmology appealed especially well to those who held fundamentalist religious views, and it was received gladly by them, since it restored the status of our Earth from whence it had been relegated by cosmologists as being a minute dust-mote in enormity of the Universe, back into a position of primary cosmic importance again. Just as is set forth in Genesis 1 . In Teed’s view, all that we consider to be the great external infinity of space and all the scattered nebulae, galaxies"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 and star systems, are actually contained within an amorphous, dark spherical mass at the very centre of our inverted world-globe, the focal point of which is, of course, Infinity . Our sun and moon orbit around inside the earth-sphere, somewhere in between this “Heavenly or Celestial region” and the concave inner surface of our hollow world. Even Albert Einstein would not have been able to find any scientific fault with this concept, since he himself proved that all space is curved , as are all light-rays, thus, according to his Relativity theory, even a ray of light must eventually return to its starting-point! This concept itself implies that the Universe is as spherical and finite as our hollow globe. Einstein’s famous Theory of Relativity fits this idea of Teed’s to perfection, so if Einstein had ever examined Cyrus Teed’s inverted world-view, he would have had little choice but to accept it, since all of his own much-cherished cosmological ideas are demonstrated in it! This is why Teed’s theory is well-nigh impossible to disprove by the application of modern geometry and rules and laws of physical science. In Teed’s world (or “Hollow Cosmos”), science as currently taught, is turned completely on its head. We are held to the inner surface of this hollow globe not by gravity , but by simple centrifugal force ! Any stunt motor-cyclist who has ridden around that spectacular vertical fairground cylinder or spherical cage called the “Wall Of Death” , will attest to the exact similarity to gravity of this force - which also applies in a like manner when the cylinder rotates as at an amusement-park and people who take rides on it, are held firmly “glued” in place anywhere upon its inner surface. Many of my readers have no doubt experienced this for themselves during their childhood or youth. This same centrifugal force is what used to prevent old-time flyers from falling out of their open cockpits as they “looped the loop” in their old biplanes, unhampered by seat- belts and with their heads pointed towards the ground! The Curious Cosmogony of an Inversed World. Apparently (and being no certificated scientist, I must accept the words of others on this) , what happens is that all the laws of geometry and physics become inversed , and, following Einsteinian relativity , everything slows down and shrinks as one approaches the centre of the cosmic globe – including oneself and whatever measuring-device one might be using – thus, because of the circular bending of light rays, if one were to look back, one would get a “fish-eye lens” view of that portion of the inner-earth shell immediately below, which - due to a common photographical phenomenon called “spherical abberation” - would appear exactly as a NASA astronaut currently sees the Earth when viewing it the from his space-shuttle! Thus, for all intents and purposes, there is simply no scientific way in which we can demonstrate that Teed’s world isn’t our own! From the ground, we would see the inner sun in the sky as it passed over our region, and its brightness would naturally prevent us from seeing the central dark globular cosmic mass, dotted with stars, just as the glare of our external sun stops us from seeing the blackness of the cosmos and its stars. As the inner sun passed behind this mass, light would begin to fade and the stars would become visible in the ensuing darkness. Because of the spherical-abberation effect I mentioned earlier, and which works both ways, we would appear to see stars scattered"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 to all the limits of our visual horizon – which, incidentally, is also an optical illusion! During daytime hours, one would not be able to see the antipodal region of the Earth directly overhead, for the following reasons. Firstly , the density of the air – which has a misty blue opacity, due to oxygen and ozone – would prevent us from seeing through two thick densities of atmosphere – above us, and above that other, opposite area. Secondly , even if we were able to see across a distance of six or seven thousand miles (the assumed diameter of the inner Earth) - the brightness of the inner sun’s light would pretty well preclude us from doing so, since it would be scattered by the atomic particles that compose the atmosphere, thus effectively obscuring distant views. This same effect would also limit our horizontal range of vision even more, due to our looking through a much denser layer of atmosphere, thus creating the effect of a hazy circular “horizon” all around our viewpoint. If the reader has ever travelled across a wide ocean on board a ship, he or she will probably recall this effect clearly. It is as though the ship is alone in a circular ocean which appears to cut off rather abruptly at the limit of horizontal vision where the density of the atmosphere “fogs” out the distance. As to the “horizon” itself. Teed himself invented and constructed a very long and horizontally movable apparatus called a “rectilineator” , with which he was able to demonstrate that a dead-straight beam, exactly parallel to the surface of a perfectly still stretch of water, such as a long lake, and projected onward visually as a straight line from its end, would vanish into the water within a mere four miles distance! This same experiment has on several occasions since been duplicated by different groups of scientists with exactly similar results! How can we possibly refute this by any other scientific methodology? A leading Canadian Professor of mathematics, H.S.M. Coxeter , has already stated that he could think of no scientific way he could prove that we aren’t currently living inside a hollow world sphere, since, to use his own words: “any observation we can make on the outside of the Earth has an exact duplicate version inside. There would be no way to tell which was the truth.” A popular Egyptian science-writer, Mostafa A. Abdelkader , wrote a recent article which seriously considered the proposition that we are actually living inside a hollow Earth. In it he said that the only way for us to test the theory’s validity is to drill a tunnel straight through the Earth, from one side to the other. He wrote that “until such an experiment is performed, it seems that the odds are strongly in favour of a hollow earth being our actual universe.” Religious Aspects. Teed stated that the earth shell beneath our feet (as occupants of this inner-Earth) was around 50–150 miles thick, and what lies outside it is really only known to the Creator. But in view of the fact that all major religions teach that beneath our feet lies an Underworld of thick darkness, from which God is absent, this would seem to be the place that Jesus referred to when he said “But the children of the kingdom shall be cast into"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 outer darkness : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” (Matthew: 8:12) Jesus also spoke of the end of the world when angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just: “ and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth” (Matthew: 13:50) (Emphases are mine. GF.) So what does this tell us but that on the outside of our earth-shell lies a region of both darkness and fire! Some sort of vast, stygian region, in which the pitch-dark blackness is relieved only the dull red glow of raging volcanoes, and lakes of lava, springs instantly to mind. Thus, what we seem to draw from this is that what lies beyond the Earth’s shell is either Hell or the Lake of Fire . However, since Jesus will one day cast even Hell itself into the Lake of Fire (complete with its occupants?) Hell has to be a separate place – possibly in the bowels of the Underworld? Also the idea that the Earth is a “contained” world, in the sense of it being enclosed in some way, is inferred many times in the Bible when it speaks of things and personages “ entering , or coming into the world, or the Earth” – just as one might come into a room or a building. Also there are some Biblical references to Christ having visited the interior of the earth (in a spirit-body), during the three days His body was entombed, after His Crucifixion. Could this mean He had perhaps been ministering to the Inner World inhabitants - or does this simply describe a “rescue-mission” to those trapped in Hell? However, there are, of course, also many references to people being “ upon the Earth”, too - which, to my mind, at least, implies standing upon the outside of the Earth’s crust, so, perhaps this particular line of interesting semantics may not appear as productive as it could be! Other Noteworthy Points. Perhaps, in considering all the foregoing, one might well bear in mind that scholars and academics are, by their very nature , conservative , and will fiercely resist any and all changes in “orthodox knowledge” when new truths are revealed. Unfortunately, it is in their academic interests to do so, since there’s always the chance they might find an entire lifetime of study and academic achievement instantly vanishing down the pan with the discovery of an entirely new and different foundation for a particular science than that on which they erected their own splendid intellectual concepts! Unfortunately, academics seldom propose tentative theories. Once a theory is proposed and hailed by their colleagues, they at once endeavour by every means in their power to transmute it speedily into a “scientific truth” . Hitler’s publicity henchman, silver-tongued Dr. Joseph Goebbels, developed this skill to a fine art during the frightful Nazi reign of totalitarianism and terror. Under his clever administration of propaganda and disinformation, black could be conclusively proved to be white , beyond any shadow of doubt. At his command, turning theory into undeniable fact became a science in itself, by a little glib talking and a few airy waves of his hand! This spirit, alas, still lurks in the hallowed halls of learning. So we must always be very vigilantly suspicious of anything that scientists present to us as “validated and attested fact”. Remember that, as simple laymen, we only have their word for it – and they, by and large, do tend to believe themselves to possess a sort of scientific “Papal infalliblity”!"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 Questions of Proof. Pontius Pilate once asked the question : “What is Truth?” He was probably right to do so, since most of us simply can’t tell truth from nonsense. We have to depend upon “reliable authorities”. (Poor Pilate had the very Author of All Truth standing before him at the time he asked this rhetorical question, but sadly, he was totally ignorant of the fact!) A classic case of the misplaced trust we have in seemingly “unimpeachable authorities” is demonstrated by the Western World’s utter blind faith in all the acts and pronouncements of NASA. Most of us accept without question every scrap of information they feed to us regarding their satellites and space-missions. Why would they ever want to lie? However, since the advent of the Internet, there has been a major public reviewal and revisiting of their Apollo Missions to the Moon. Many of the photographs which NASA released as having been taken by the Apollo astronauts, upon the Moon’s surface, are now being reappraised by private experts and called into question. Why? Simply because it would seem that many of these Moon-photographs can now apparently be demonstrated, even by amateur astronomers and armchair physics students, to be palpable fakes ! Without going into great detail - which readers can easily study for themselves upon various websites that are dedicated to this particular search for scientific veracity – the photos are claimed to be full of strange anomalies, such as wrong shadows, backlighting, the absence of stars in the background skies, clearly impossible activities and images on a world where everything should be starkly lit and blackly shadowed, due to the complete absence of any lunar atmosphere whatsoever – that should totally preclude any possibility of the softly-graduated, reflected light and shade that is depicted so clearly in NASA’s photographs of astronauts or craft on the Moon. Apollo - A Hoax That Backfired? It seems to be the belief of a growing number of very intelligent, professional people – including trained photographers and astronomers – that many of these pictures could only have been shot by earth-bound cameramen on a Earth-based movie-lot – whether inside a studio, or out on a suitably arid and deserted location - in a dense, earthlike atmosphere ! So many apparently simple yet blatant visual “errors” seem to have crept past the final inspection of the finished pictures that they would be laughable – if it were not for the absolutely vast amounts of American tax-dollars that are claimed to have gone into perpetrating such an alleged massive exercise in “kidology”. But why on Earth ( literally!) would the US Government wish to go to such enormous and deceitful lengths to fool people all over the world into thinking they had landed men on the Moon? The answer may be right there: “people all over the world” ! Especially those who were then regarded as the sworn enemies of the USA, such as the former communist Russians and the present Chinese! If such a charade really had happened, it must essentially have been just a huge “P.R.-Sabre-Rattling” propaganda-exercise designed to impress them with good old"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 State-of–the-Art, American technological wizardry and “Know-how” and to indicate that the United States of America was not a nation one should tangle with! However, I must stress that it is also equally credible that NASA may conceivably have made a studio version of the “Lunar landing” just in case anything went radically wrong on the actual mission, or even as a “backstop” in the event that relayed television picture quality from the Moon might prove so poor and blurry as to be virtually indecipherable to the eagerly-watching world viewing audience The Van Allen Belts. However, the Russians already knew about (and studiously avoided) the dangers of the Van Allen Radiation Belts and the magnetosphere, which lie largely between 50 to 200,000 miles above the Earth and protect all life on its surface by shielding it from deadly solar and cosmic radiations. As far as is known, their magnetic layers trap almost all harmful radioactive particles before they can approach near the Earth. Thus the two layers, which act as filters, are densely-clogged with captured highly dangerous particles, and represent an extremely deadly region for any kind of terrestrial lifeforms which may conceivably try to pass through it, en route to the Moon, or to anywhere else in space. However, the Moon and outer space can be reached without passing through these radioactive belts, since they form a thick, “inflated-doughnut” shaped region around most of the Earth, but leave clear openings over the polar and subpolar regions. Thus space isn’t quite as “Off Limits” to humans or other lifeforms, as many debunkers think. Nevertheless, it’s certainly odd that US astronauts haven’t revisited the Moon since December, 1972. Orbiting Space Satellites. The various Earth-orbiting satellites and space-stations generally orbit at no higher an altitude than around 180 to 240 miles, so there is relatively little risk to their crews from this source. But it is unlikely that any actual attempt has ever yet been made to orbit manned craft within the first Van Allen Belt. And therein lies the reason for all the “Apollo Hoax” outcry – which was based on the assumption that those in authority had underestimated the true measure of knowledge of such space-matters among the general lay public. This alleged “conspiracy” is regarded as the real reason why there have been no “Follow-Up Trips” to the Moon during the 30 years that have elapsed since. Conspiracists believe that NASA authorities were made suddenly and painfully aware that their bit of alleged “illicit movie-making” had been badly compromised, and had to scramble to find something else to distract attention away from it – like Skylab ! Thus we had the “Viking” and “Voyager” programmes, and others of a similar ilk, including the Mars “MOLA” missions, none of which required live crews on board their craft. Personally however, I find all of these missions, manned and unmanned , to be perfectly credible, since they are well within the bounds of modern space-technology. Nontheless, the Van Allen Belts must still pose a major stumbling-block to manned space-exploration, certainly in the immediate future, since neither the Russians or the Europeans have attempted to, or plan on, send a manned spacecraft to the Moon."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 Why they couldn’t use the North polar-aperture, as NASA must have done with the Apollo missions, is difficult to understand. Perhaps even that is still quite risky, although I don’t suppose it will remain an insurmountable danger for very much longer. I believe that NASA will soon evolve a fully effective lightweight radiation-shielding for their spacecraft and astronauts, or perhaps even a magnetic-repulsion field against both radiation and the hull-puncturing micro-meteorites - which represents a very major, though much down-played threat, far beyond the Van Allen-Magnetosphere region. So much then for my potted study of human fallibility! (Even among the Olympian godlike NASA scientists!) Now, having discussed the nature of proof , let us move on or perhaps return to another very pertinent question concerning our previous subject. The curious matter of clear scientific proof for Teed’s Concave World theory! The Strange Business With Plumb-Bobs. Around 1901, whilst attempting to discover with greater accuracy the size of the Earth, so that they could then make better calculations about our distance from the Sun, the French Government’s geological boffins came up with a novel idea. They found a way to measure the distances apart (at both ends) of two very-elongated, vertical parallel lines. Since no structure of the length they needed could be erected upon the surface, some bright Gallic spark had the brilliant brainwave of using a mile-deep mineshaft , down which two long plumb-lines could be hung, side by side a couple of feet apart, and they were thus able to measure the difference in the distance apart between both ends of the two lines - at the surface, and at a mile below the surface. Naturally, they expected to find the lines to be somewhat closer together at the bottom of the shaft than at the top, and from this they could then calculate with some considerable precision, by projecting the lines geometrically, the exact point inside the Earth at which the lines would finally meet. This would mark the exact centre of gravity , and would give a very accurate radius for our planet. But, surprisingly, the result of the experiment proved to be quite weird. The plumb-bobs were found to be further apart at the bottom of the mineshaft than they were at the top ! Further trials produced the same results, so, in desperation, they contacted a famed professor of physics, a Dr. MacNair, of the Michigan College of Mines, USA. McNair repeated the experiment, but upon gaining the same curious result, he suggested that the plumb-bobs might be magnetically repelling each other, and that lead weights should be used. However, this didn’t change a thing - the results were still exactly the same. By this time the matter had attracted the attention of another American professor at the Columbia University, Professor Hallock. He believed that it was the two lines of piano-wire used to suspend the weights that were attracting each other, and arranged for a fresh experiment to be conducted in the Tamarack mines at Calumet, in Michigan. Of course, none of this made a scrap of difference, and despite the lines being hung down two widely-separate mile-deep mineshafts, that were connected by a perfectly horizontal tunnel at their bottoms, the results still gave the same incrediblely illogical and"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 incomprehensible result! By being farther apart at their bottom ends than at their tops, the plumblines indicated that, if the lines were geometrically extended upward instead of down, they would actually meet at a point 4,000 miles up in space ! A Maddening Implication! The implication of this was that the earth’s centre of gravity was not at a single point 4,000 miles down inside the Earth, but was instead located at any point that same distance up in the sky! This meant that the Earth’s centre of gravity must actually be in a spherical configuration of around 16,000 miles diameter, which surrounded the Earth like an invisible, globular gravitational shield! This whole strange business caused a great uproar in geophysical circles, and the US Geodetic Survey team spent a further two years in further experiments, one of which involved the measurement of the surface of a lengthy Florida lake, on the assumption that its calm flat water must conform to the precise curvature of the Earth, and would therefore demonstrate that curvature perfectly, if a long enough and gunbarrel-straight level were used to for sighting and projecting a true sightline. Alas, this also produced a very strange result, in that the lake’s unruffled surface appeared to curve upward in all directions, instead of downward , as they had expected! They appear to have retired completely baffled by this result, probably trying to forget the whole maddening exercise. Enter Koresh. It was at this point that Cyrus Teed made his appearance, now having adopted the role of a religious mystic, under the name of Koresh (the Hebrew version of his first name). Despite his mystic guise, Koresh was completely practical in his own application of the same experiments which had so mystified the academics. He repeated them all in true engineering fashion, and then proceeded to build an entirely new religious concept of the Earth to fit the same scientifically-inexplicable results. In fact he used them to excellent effect in scientifically proving the Earth to actually be a concave sphere, with all of humanity - and everything else, including the sun, moon and stars - inside it - instead of an imagined convex one, where all creatures and plants appeared to live on its outer surface, and the heavens and celestial bodies seemed to be visible high above and around it, floating in the infinite space of the Universe. From there on, Teed was able to attract a large following of convinced disciples and to create a brand-new Koreshan religion, founded entirely upon his incredible new theory. Teed-Koresh might have gone considerably further with this entirely new world- vision, but unfortunately, he now began to see himself as the returned Christ , and whilst his congregation accepted this blasphemy and remained faithful to their newfound “faith”, Koresh decided that only true celibacy would get them into Heaven. Thus, without properly considering the later effects of his actions, Koresh/Teed unwittingly built a natural “Run-Out” or “Self-Destruct” period into his organization, and in due course, all of his ardent followers simply died off, leaving the movement to fade into complete self-extinction. And there, if only for the sake of conserving page-space, I must finally conclude the curious fragment ofbackground history to this third and extremely weird variation of a “Hollow Earth” – the Cellestrocentric, Inversed Earth !"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 In Conclusion. What Can One Conclude? What, if anything can be offered in rebuttal of this apparently undisprovable theory? Sadly not a great deal, other than plain observation and commonsense. One idea is that, if we are held to the inside of a rotating sphere by centrifugal force , surely that force would diminish to zero at the axial poles of its rotation , with the result that anyone venturing to the poles would cease to be affected by that force and would begin to float upwards as they neared the poles. Thus far, there don’t appear to have been any reports of such weird anomalies from either the Eskimos and surveyors of the Arctic region, nor from the weather scientists based at or around the Antarctic pole! Also, one has to wonder, if this Earth-Cosmos is spinning, the laws of mechanics (if they actually apply to such an Earth) dictate that it has to spin about an axis. But why would it need to spin, if all the Universe is already in here, with us? And what could it be spinning in ? If there is nothing beyond the crust we live on, what would be making it spin – and for what reason ? Just to hold us to the inside of its shell? Maybe these are questions we should be asking the One who allegedly designed it thus! However, one of the most interesting and telling points that I’ve not yet heard mention of, is the plain fact that, when at sea, the first sighting of an approaching vessel on the horizon , is the tip of its foremast, then its funnel comes into view, then gradually the superstructure and the hull eventually appear to emerge from the edge of the ocean. This is surely crystal-clear evidence that the sea curves upwards over the horizon line and then runs down toward the viewer, in a convex manner! Also, I gather that, in the Teed model of a concave Earth, the focal centre of the globe is alleged to be occupied by a dark, inky-black mass which contains an Einsteinian “relative universe” , where every celestial body we see in outer space is to be found, whether with our own eyes, or through the telescopes of our astronomers. The Sun and the Moon are claimed to orbit around this mass, between the inner surface and the cloud of starry darkness, and it is when they orbit beyond and behind its edge, away from our position, they appear to set and rise again. However, again, just as in the case of the distant ship approaching over the rim of the ocean, simple observation shows that we always see the Sun (and the Moon) drop down (or “set” beyond the western horizon, to rise again out of the eastern horizon. What further proof do we require that the Earth’s suface upon which we live is truly convex? But why should the Sun and Moon need to orbit, if the earth-shell itself is rotating? But modern Koreshans would answer this by flatly stating that the Earth does not move at all. It is, they declare, perfectly static and is surrounded by some dense and tangible plasma of Stygian “Outer Darkness” (to which, as we’ve seen, the Christian Bible makes several enigmatic references). However, if the Earth did not rotate , in the absence of gravity within its spherical shell (which is implied by the cloud-universe at its centre, which, QED, should surely possess staggeringly enormous mass) , the only other thing which would hold us to the surface – centripetal force – just couldn’t exist! Thus,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 upon a fairly superficial examination by even the humblest scientific layman, the entire Koreshan Cellular Cosmonogy theory simply collapses like a house of cards! The Religious Component. One might well wonder how so many millions of people are so easily persuaded to accept often quite ridiculous concepts such as this, in the name of God. However, the answer is quite simply that virtually all sentient human beings require some form of external “Benevolent Entity” to cling to and to pin their hopes upon. Whether it be a miraculous “God”- figure, humanoid or animistic, a magic talisman of some sort, or even just plain Lady Luck , this aching need for some kind of supernatural guardianship and protection is felt by the vast majority of our species. If we were devoid of sapient intellect, as are most of the common animals, we would have no thought or concern for anything beyond the immediate here and now. So, as creatures of pure instinct, we wouldn’t worry about what harm might befall us, or concern ourselves over spiritual matters, or a possible Hereafter. But we humans are sapient creatures who are also endowed with active, vivid imaginations, and thus we often feel defenceless and vulnerable in the face of a frightening Unknown – especially Death. Hence the great power, and, in fact, pressing need of “religion” in some form or other among most of our species. A Relative Cosmos? Harking back to the concept of the cosmos being located in a relativistic form around the earth’s focal centre, then surely - were a suitable spacecraft available - one might be able to travel past or through the aforementioned “ Infinity-Point ” and out again on the other side, back down to Earth again, increasing in size and mass again, en route? Or would the spaceship and its crew perhaps simply continue to diminish in size, according to Einstein’s Law of Relativity , until it disappeared entirely into infinity? Or could it perhaps be that there is some sort of “worm-hole” at that point, which connects with the very Ultimate Infinity of Heaven itself? As The Immortal Bard of Avon described it, in his customary, poetic way: “The undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns.” Perhaps both scenarios might, in the end, amount to the same final result! And perhaps only a great genius of the intellectual stature of Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein or Stephen Hawking might, some day be able to furnish us with a sensible answer to this conundrum! Alas, I certainly cannot, although that still doesn’t prevent me from having my own instinctive and entirely unscientific “gut-feeling” about the actual veracity or falsety of this theory - or from getting the unpleasantly ominous sensation that the Koreshan concave Earth was perhaps initially conceived as a sincere theory, but was subsequently adapted and elaborated upon in order to create another quasi-scientific , religious hoax , perpetrated to extort large sums of money from a crowd of earnest but gullible followers! Sadly, we will never know, and at this point, my ever-patient reader, I really must wind up this rambling discussion of something which – after all is said and done - really doesn’t makes one single tangible scrap of difference whatsoever, one way or the other to us , the occupants of this planet, as we go about our daily lives and affairs!"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 A Final Question. There is one final question that we should all ask ourselves should any of these three theoretic cases, by some strange perchance, turn out to be true. What would be the reaction of the governments of the powerful nations of the world be to the affirmation of such a discovery? Would they hasten to pass on to their citizens the exciting news of the discovery of another world – or worlds - within the globe we live upon? Or would they covertly rush to be the first to enter such an hitherto hidden world and plant their national flag upon its soil, and perhaps claim it as extra “lebensraum” for their excess population? Or, worse still, if it were found to be already inhabited , would they wage a merciless war to exterminate its inhabitants, so as to be able to utilise such a secret inner world for their own nefarious purposes - and, if it were found (as would seem likely) to be rich in precious minerals and ores – exploit it mercilessly and profit from a seemingly endless supply of oil or gold, or other scarce commodity, on the outer-world markets? Given the appalling track-records in such matters of the richer or more powerful nations like the USA, the Europe Community and China, I believe that we should all be able to answer this question for ourselves. If such a discovery is ever made, and a powerful government learns of it, then we can rest assured that we, the humble citizens of the surface world, will probably never get to hear about it! And there, dear readers, I will finally rest my case! The End  Gerry Forster. 2001. Recommended reading on these Hollow and inversed Earth theories . “Hollow Planets” by Jan Lamprecht.
